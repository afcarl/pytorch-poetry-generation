With One Bee, 

 Till a lesson stealing wine away, 
 And changing prospect bends and thumb 
 
 Going the face down The ground 
 She textscape. at the eminence; 
 
 Her, with the piteous bells 
 Began rock ering 
 Through the arc of the night, 
 Stand on the tree, and show one brake, 
 well-heeled two stern lives; 
 But white-robed 
 By the rich shroud of breath'd, slowworm 
 Great forms of happy love! 
 
 Here her voice, that roses, hills,
