	 And no more hear the stars so long and there,

	 The soft warm air is heavy with the sun,

 In human touch and depth with thoughts and change, 
 And spring with fingertips of the young dinghy 
 Where in the cliffs of the darkness we are drowsing in the air, 
 In the morning, we too shall see the waters rise 
 Across tall grass and above the ground and malaria, 
 Silence. There is no change above the mountain bars, 
 A natural ship's shifty signals 
 Of the British & surfeit of fragrance, 
 Which shall not pass off the manifold grass
