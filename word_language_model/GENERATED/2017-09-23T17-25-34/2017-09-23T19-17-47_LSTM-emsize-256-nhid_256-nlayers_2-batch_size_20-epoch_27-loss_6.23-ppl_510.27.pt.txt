The Sky Cursing Death, Now: 

 peeling banks of towns 
 
 
 
 Round poets last day's league, 
 And the wind and nearly green, 
 teocallis to sea, 
 From the far spheres the traveller whole. 
 
 Out of a field within the strangest air 
 When the crickets rolled up the hill. 
 
 And danced inside the latches edge 
 By the sole moor-hens Bay, 
 Came themselves in the salt o' light-- 
 
 Along the face of menâ€™s flowers, 
 Woven
