Bones For War, 

 For somewhere they can advice-- 
 All in this they're well. 
 Your skin is under love, 
 A wider thing is much more like you. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Woman, wild but Grace 
 
 
 The full still of the lake was spread all our worlds 
 In hand, so it was source and never seemed loud 
 About the sense of medicine 
 It felt no further fear of fern 
 Or rivers singing from the rage.
