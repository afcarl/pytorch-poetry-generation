Heartstrings Kinsman 

 In a smile, and shook and laughing all over 
 Plus the fowls that no man like 
 Should shad'st it in place, 
 
 Not link than I can glow a glow, 
 I never see one old dawn of the movelessness 
 And each start another for the moment 
 Ladies and shelter, the fireworks in the gutter, 
 
 The glory of the elephant is heard of the light, 
 
 And the boughs above my broken stem 
 
 The flow
