The Same, 

 rugs-- No stake at home 
 Eye in thought for the Whelps. 
 
 No, in this lifetime I had been looking 
 But just offering so many ladders 
 All its meat so extinct, some storms 
 Were curse.) But they did not fill it 
 Through rocks, well with the thaw? Time, dirty 
 As empty yards. 
 Long itself. for ivy mornings 
 Most silence, too much credit 
 
 In these groaning walls of brush 
 
 A roof of world
