 he was & 
 there's a rope 
 a blond, wonder 
 
 he misheard it because 
 he is atom; 
 
 Warmwell coins straight guys, 
 
 They begin 
 
 the rest the healing & body 
 of himself dead 
 beaver 
 along the stage 
 
 ever for a walk 
 worst 
 the whales 
 sing the shape of 
 Light 
 blue pasture 
 burns 
 
 dust wheels 
 single 
 
 wind
