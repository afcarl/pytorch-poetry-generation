 happened—a elephant: screaming. 
 Lorca would come, strive for a place 
 that can hardly break into the mythocryptic body 
 
 forever well. I suffer with it, 
 the garden guards me like a dark notebooks 
 and lightning that has finally been 
 blown through with white. Its words 
 are drawn and laughing with own) 
 by the frothings of my metaphor. 
 
 chortle shop immerses me. 
 I have to tell that that which is dead or plaintive—he else.
