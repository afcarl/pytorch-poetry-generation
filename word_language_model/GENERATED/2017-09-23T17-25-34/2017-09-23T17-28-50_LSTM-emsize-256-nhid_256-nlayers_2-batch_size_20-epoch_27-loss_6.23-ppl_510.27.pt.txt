Of Love-- 

 The birds that watch the streams and the sky 
 Make under flowers the secret of the universe 
 Has sharp, and in death's time, the kindness seems 
 Of joy? This is the afterlife of young things. 
 
 IV. 
 The six surviving years I call 
 An month's book of bread 
 As sweeter discovery. 
 Ten million hearse are so completely 
 Out of the forests questions 
 Of passing inspiration off and down.
