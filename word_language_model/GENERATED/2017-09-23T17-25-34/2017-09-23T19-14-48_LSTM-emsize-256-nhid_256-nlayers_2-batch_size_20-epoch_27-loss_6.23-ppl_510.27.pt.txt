The Gauzes 

 Foam-flanked along a road in the stump, 
 But though looking for the obsession of winter, 
 keep still again; 
 Nothing a shift in the window 
 Does hope come too frightened to. 
 There are beautiful people lost all ahead 
 Through the past lonely, relative 
 A place of out the world, the animal steps from the east 
 A perfumed bag 
 
 A coiled purple fingernail spill ... 
 The Sons of death inside days are not to the trees.
