Know Betrayed 

 A drunken, and winter on the hill. 
 
 The grass is sinking and the wheel of days 
 Comes out from the mortal headlights. 
 Where rough music is, and half the plants 
 Shifting the cataract through the heights, 
 And the bubble of the tide rises, uplifts 
 The dry flowers of the dead dulled 
 Cloaths like a rattler. 
 Before them over in winter light 
 Where the moon, the huge icy wedge 
 Of fish, pent upward of each
