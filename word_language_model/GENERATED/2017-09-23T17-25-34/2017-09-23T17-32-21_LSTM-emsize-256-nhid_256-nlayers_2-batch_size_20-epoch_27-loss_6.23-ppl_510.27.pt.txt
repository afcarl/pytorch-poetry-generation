That It Leans, And So Is Lie. 

 As on these shadowy shore, swallows 
 Ocean and observed, thereâ€™s a breeze, 
 Looking through the fields, 
 Light as deep as a beechen showers 
 coin flower and legs and furnished with tongues, 
 And there in the flesh a myriad dust Convivio, 
 These from enemies: we coughed 
 Toward the dark light, the hour of paradise. 
 
 But only yet, I know she could not find 
 What's small to just the Delta clod,
