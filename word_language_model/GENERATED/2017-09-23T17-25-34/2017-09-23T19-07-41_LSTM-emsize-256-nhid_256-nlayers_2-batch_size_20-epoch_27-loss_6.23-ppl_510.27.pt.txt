Phonographs And Soul And Gone By, 

 
 Like the last of extreme Radar 
 On tantalize the road that round me sit; 
 Behold! this Mornings of all the world; 
 
 A marble woman floats the last piece 
 Of day and day, and the spider winds to their door. 
 
 That fence it is the light of the ocean 
 When a horse sweats and hay-rick 
 Take him to spilt his untimely smile. 
 
 I'm not stolen waving her darling there?
