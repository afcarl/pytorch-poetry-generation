Little Mind ... 

 And in this years have found 
 A voice clear to her lover, flaring 
 In swallow's apples showing 
 
 A splendid breath to get your arm in the line. 
 
 The white nights 
 That make thoughts, I could think of, 
 Who knows us. What the path does depend 
 By the other side. 
 
 Speak, sweet and beautiful was the lyrical dish â€” 
 The of old nuns who sees at a steamer on 
 While the lamp;
