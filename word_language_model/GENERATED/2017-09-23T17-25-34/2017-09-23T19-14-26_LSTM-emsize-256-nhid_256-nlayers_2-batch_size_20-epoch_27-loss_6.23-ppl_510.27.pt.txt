Your New Soul Waits. 

 
 And round my body is my dead, 
 Stealthily and chaste glass, there is no ground, 
 That though flowers, night unto me aprons due, 
 Whatever pinkish meditation, 
 Once on the mundgripe 
 
 Well some majestic slopes 
 Of red and I yet D'Anjou, 
 Then turn within them is dragged black; 
 The parting burden of the sun and smoke 
 In the bedding Wood among the lolling of shipwrecked. 
 
 O, which the Giant burning, and
