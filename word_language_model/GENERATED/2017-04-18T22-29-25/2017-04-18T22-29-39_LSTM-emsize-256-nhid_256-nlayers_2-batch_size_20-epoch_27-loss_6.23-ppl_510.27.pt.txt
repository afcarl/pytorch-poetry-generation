Promiscuous Food 

 For a pleading, was that sitting on the wall. 
 The pain was in the woods; through white, 
 A fort in its shape of a man. 
 
 The phone's been backlit to me, 
 The cruel trade of the roarin race and the ways of desire, 
 The birds' shrieking hand in beaching, 
 Hold forth for the valley above my door! 
 Falling over again! 
 
 Over me there comes my palm home for me and never left my fire,
