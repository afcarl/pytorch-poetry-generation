 a shadow of ringing, giving 
 the rest behind, 
 
 until ah, we'll be sending out 
 all the colors of 
 incense, dying at the rainy house; 
 the word equally yearned to spit for art 
 on zero of the Atlantic Oak 
 Square under the barrier, 
 unburied! at indigo and shorts 
 At the small foot cyst 
 goat's lion in tune to another, 
 to their elaborate planes 
 
 comes and go-- when 
 they must delight 
 as
