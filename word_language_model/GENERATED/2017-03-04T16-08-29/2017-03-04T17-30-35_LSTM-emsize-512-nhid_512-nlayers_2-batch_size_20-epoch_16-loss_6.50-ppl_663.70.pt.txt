 You will hear the winds of the moon notes that dwells abroad 
 
 Sometimes around the face grow your face 
 
 And stay upon the gold talk, 
 You can see the top, or past the deer Buddhas 
 And the forest's upturned cry in the hill. 
 
 And your sighs. 
 
 You who were surprised to think of a tobacco weeping, 
 Ever a noisy girl, having regained it. 
 Deep in the middle of her sheer Vlatva 
 Tiny toils. Fire
