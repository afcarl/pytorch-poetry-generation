 Into a rustling stone, 
 breathing, mist and ice moon falling 
 My right mild bosom:...she lost 
 
 Some little light and sighs 
 At yonder Pole. 
 
 So the ritual fly from the door. 
 Sit on the country noon, I come, 
 Passing with the cold and stone; 
 And in the days are out with spring and weather 
 now?-- dry plants, pure ceasing and hope; 
 My father, tells me what he feels is done. 
 Even in another moment,
