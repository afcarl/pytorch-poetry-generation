To The Moon Of Day: 

 murk in the changing shapes of force; 
 Mesozoic riches come at school. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Garden of Children 
 
 
 With Memory needs a done!" 
 snailsdeath, perhaps. 
 The Bird-song, Wonder-Wielder, 
 Over the pines, a tuffet, 
 The silver, hanging in the evening's nest, 
 Red tables, the curious earth 
 Till evening turns away? 
 
 A darkness clear honeysuckle 
 unsnare sound of wine. 
 Let me gaze upon the loom,
