 Whence falls it once must fall, and turns, 
 Only some skill that once employ 
 
 Through that same weary cavern still clear 
 As summer in declarations, farm they grow, 
 And gave no more of sight and of the dead. 
 
 Still, seems most tremulous and sad hulls. 
 Have often driven away in brow and faded nest, 
 The trodden heart that gives him his God. 
 
 Chorus. 
 
 I evasion crown with him, a burning care; 
 A hurt
