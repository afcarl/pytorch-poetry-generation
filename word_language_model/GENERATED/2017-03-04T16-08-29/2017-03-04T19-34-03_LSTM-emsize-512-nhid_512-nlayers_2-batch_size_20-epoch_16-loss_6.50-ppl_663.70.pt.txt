Carried A Irresistible: 

 On a large horizon lights a fan, 
 A silent army come by the past. 
 
 Lifted and fresh, the mass fell from the wind 
 Up to the stove ... I watched the black wall 
 And yellow glove bites, staring at the sun, 
 
 The round waters needs curled from a inch unfulfill'd 
 spirited) it sucks there, in the arteries 
 Of light blown by cadence of many moons 
 By banquet of things cleaner of silence, 
 Conspire
