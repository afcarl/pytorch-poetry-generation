To Thought 

 except she'd fallen, but more. 
 In the land we're strong; 
 size of bright refracting hair, 
 Eyes of blood, the sun. 
 
 But let us slow for our swords were these. 
 
 caressing the anthem with one hand 
 set and desponds Disemboweled 
 echoes among walls and temples 
 that bear us a bridge jitters 
 Into a small film, ditches. 
 Hey, what? 
 
 I can't hear myself choose too 
 
 what I may have to do
