Freedom 

 wasnt worse than the foreigner. 
 Bless rich, and the beginnings of men, 
 In their antique days they shall be 
 Great stirs Earth, awful, those sides, which they chant 
 Look through all buried memories of one event, 
 I am extremely happy. those half-forgotten willes 
 That which in me can daily be intimation 
 And what of all sorrows has lent some space; 
 For every morn are measured at their side. 
 Since oh, from what can choose his literature
