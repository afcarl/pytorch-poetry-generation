At His Feet, And Holds Their Eyes 

 Been lashed to some hillock for the middle of the mare, 
 Come inside, consider the trip. Why will they do this? 
 Look down and throw some Personage in Frightened of cold; 
 Dying in their horror. Now, some are true men ! 
 regrettable whose thieves find upward, fade as loud 
 Have shown a record wall to be permitted away; 
 Sleeping in summah, owl! May 
 As shadows roadhouses down among the repose. 
 For dark
