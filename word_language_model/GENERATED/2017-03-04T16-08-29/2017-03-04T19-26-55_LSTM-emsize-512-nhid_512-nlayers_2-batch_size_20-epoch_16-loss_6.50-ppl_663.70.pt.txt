I Forsake Our Flours 

 Species lose. We can afford the devil. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Oxford Poem 
 
 
 The question or the scent of trees 
 and what they feel in that cold rash stiff field of grass 
 We wake down to the top of nowhere in arms to climb with the birds. 
 I walk at the tall carapace for the sides. 
 Who will continue mean blood to lose the earth 
 to the Above myself, To them
