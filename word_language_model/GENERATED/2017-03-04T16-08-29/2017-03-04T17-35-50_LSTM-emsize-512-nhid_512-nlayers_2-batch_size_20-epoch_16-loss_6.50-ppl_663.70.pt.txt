Shyly At Last 

 Roustabouts her wine in that red chamber 
 An enclosure like a hides. 
 A soaked dragon tortured 
 Its garlands clear for northern valley. 
 After the slightest years, 
 Not to understand. On the shade 
 The darkening world holds her. 
 And when the months of one blade Plaths 
 Most slender and brown pollen, 
 Is neither of the birds that shorter are. 
 
 Who made singing once the hour 
 Of the gardens and of death.
