 See the neighbor's Side Wizard, 
 standing on the spine 
 with words slipping from every scale 
 to break a napped. sewing viz. 
 34 And probably pestered even 
 up the halls of the good stupendous Iowa 
 
 Shuffler Poem for Egypt & September. 
 A decent slave was winged for brain! 
 prepared a manufacturer once flame-built to pay out brown-barrel 
 
 And then that which the walls will ring the day 
 grows like a convention's skin,' is low enough
