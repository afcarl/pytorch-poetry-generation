Out; 

 crisply in and out, 
 A mother leaning like a hood on a dream-- 
 A whole horizon was Carrie, 
 And as though she were stronger together 
 Came with her round in; do not sleep in board, 
 
 Just as though between withheld hands she took it steers 
 As though an transparent, heart she could not look, 
 Still dead, and answer 
 The way she stunned was pleas'd. 
 
 Because she would never have been reading
