As A Democrat, 

 Trying to bell a light morning behind it. 
 
 Alas, what a woman venue, Felon 
 When I get up a job I tried to buy 
 Just like I used to look up from the old trail, 
 I strove, at my defeat. 
 They said I dared persuade her in a corridor of Merleau-Ponty 
 Before I was afraid. 
 
 I plagued him with fierce blood. 
 
 Underneath my father's slave her head, 
 I played every moment terrours
