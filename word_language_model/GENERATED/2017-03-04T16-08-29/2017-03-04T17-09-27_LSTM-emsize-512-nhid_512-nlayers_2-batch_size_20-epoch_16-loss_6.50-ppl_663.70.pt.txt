It 

 Has been Messiah at the world. 
 A Tuesday, a Roman dissect, Etrurian 
 From its mute dei cable in labor, 
 By the dark clarity of that human youth 
 That fought against the silent Beetles 
 An unwelcome Cave, the news serene 
 By no wisdom nurser in earth's sleep; 
 
 The wind that blows round the earth would stand, 
 Live at its rest"? brushing the slipp'ry leaf 
 Like wings. A frolic single matchboxes, 
 Dark as a still thread drops
