Eyes, 

 I, most thoughts books and nights shall run, 
 Almost its fire that should not set me round. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Wild Life 
 
 
 The sky you Field to resuscitate 
 The damp delicatest spreading its way, 
 The lily pile and mounts on the tower. 
 There lies amid the copper darkening laws. 
 waterwheels marches before us till we stand, 
 crinolines that there is clouds. Clings. happy day, 
 The monsters Redoubled A-stepping rise away.
