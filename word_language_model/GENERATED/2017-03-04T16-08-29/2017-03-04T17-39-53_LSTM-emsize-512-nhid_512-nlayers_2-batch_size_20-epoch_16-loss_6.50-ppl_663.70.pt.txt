 Ever! folds; dispatched 
 Coffee billboard, children, man letters 
 Are Beloved, sad as a che gold, 
 Kissing with her black trim. 
 
 Memory example have no daughters, 
 When she alone goes, as she learns 
 His father's body o'er us; hold what 
 Will help you touch the bitter sight somehow 
 Equally dirty to devour themselves. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Non-Action 
 
 
 Coming down over sweet:-- 
 July squirrels O H. pencils, 
 walls? paneled pikes Square
