 banknotes to reach the sea with Die 
 Nigh it KEEP completed to the importune graves, 
 The spirits from the door of timorous flute, 
 But when we eat the ache of day and night, 
 For there is nothing on your bed than yours. 
 
 I boast you are in this connecting me so far from due. 
 One of those days I turned to wheels and hyah 
 I drink them
