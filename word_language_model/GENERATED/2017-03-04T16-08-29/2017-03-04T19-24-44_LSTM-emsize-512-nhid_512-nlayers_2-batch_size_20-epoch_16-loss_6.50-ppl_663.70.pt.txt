Manic, Of Love 

 
 "To remember that brittle form my father 
 spiraling to me; the mercury run back 
 
 to meet the ocean; the press 
 roaring into the rafters 
 and the lake of mud fills the room out. 
 I call the slaves--only tips about my head. 
 It is talking about the del 1968-69. 
 I place may it plane hold a bed, 
 and gently build the girl. 
 What I said: Keep it? you do not suckle your form.
