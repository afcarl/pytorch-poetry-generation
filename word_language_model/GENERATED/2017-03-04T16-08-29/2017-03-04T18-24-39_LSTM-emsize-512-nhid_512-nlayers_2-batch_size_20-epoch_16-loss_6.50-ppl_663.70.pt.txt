 Valentine 
 
 
 In September we entered snow and sea, 
 Three fields on flesh, ships and bodies in our hearts 
 And shadowy birds while with careless sweet form. 
 investigations. silent, spent, red-brown Yeats. spray-gunned? 
 within." Marks and toiles doorbells. 
 Here lowers the Dream-daughter of the Northern Weeping, 
 Ten mile off a planet shaped like a high display 
 On a rock, dropping sharply from sweet plants, 
 Its substance Weeded and buys things
