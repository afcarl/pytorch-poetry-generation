 
 For the while I would not stand again, 
 Only the suffering run, or the text 
 To make us suffer as we shall prevent, 
 For I, to Hell I'll not forget 
 That my resort to, to seek the use. 
 
 Isn't this your routhe Fly to account. 
 Let me mark this country, whence tho' any, 
 Aught just as we've belie a fragrance; 
 Is there Saint beauty t' let someone 
 Make up out those sad garlanded 
 Like words,
