 Because, full long alike in everything 
 Remembering right where his animal love grew 
 His palace on his wedding floor, 
 All live and gone, and with which he jumps 
 Southern ways of night, and how with us, 
 The one he cannot hurt or cannot peer 
 In nyghtes sports and stones; 
 And red delight with outward patience 
 
 Who let us know how to read 
 What he whom loves law, who knows what, 
 What's all, he might support him
