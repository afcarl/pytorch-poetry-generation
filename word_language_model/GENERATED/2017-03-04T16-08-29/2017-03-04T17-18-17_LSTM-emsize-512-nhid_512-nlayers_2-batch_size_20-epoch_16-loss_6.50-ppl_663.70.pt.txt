Gave Me 

 A shadow shadows--What (I cut her up 
 Down in the water beside him evening ... 
 
 a-drain, for the catch-basins 
 His everybody's riding paroxysm 
 drifting down on the east twinkle, 
 
 "What glory is specializes slept; no sense Voicy 
 'Twere got any. But the thicket of Florence, 
 A band of metal ~~ Prison, cell? beef and gentian-flower'd 
 Haunt in our Alley. In the first drafty day of gash gapes: 
 Lepisosteus Cupid. . . .
