Spikes, 

 the couple of women, all that 
 
 in a leafy mindless 
 Gallery--Velzquez, 
 dream of the wasted swingset, 
 Esperanto soft, 
 Sounds edge 
 and the lithe leaves, aging, roar 
 of their doo, 
 persecution 
 Goes joys! 
 Past soul?--had 
 Sea floors and sea. All 
 
 was scattered blue and thin and torn 
 in that night, in my face trees 
 where humming fall 
 like draft dreams not in or scary 
 I came back from north,
