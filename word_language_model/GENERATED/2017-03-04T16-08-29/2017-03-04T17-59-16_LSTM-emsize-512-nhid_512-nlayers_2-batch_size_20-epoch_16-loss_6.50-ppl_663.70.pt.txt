Him Gibraltar Tread, 

 Home for his descry: he very late. 
 So sternly had thir awful cost 
 The borders which attack him in the trait: 
 "On such a lover if it would be less 
 To be seen us by other than a slave 
 Not too high in the back, than spy. 
 This coward and one woman who had often known, 
 Seek a bullet at a lady's face. 
 
 The lamplight already bent from the prairies hot 
 Into solitary space
