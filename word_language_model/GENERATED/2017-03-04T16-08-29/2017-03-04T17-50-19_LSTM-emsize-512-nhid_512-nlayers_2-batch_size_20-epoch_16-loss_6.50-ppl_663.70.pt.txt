 They'd never be born, being removed 
 That we are briefly thinking: 
 The child brings out the fallen gates, 
 The quarrels, the leaves the crowded verge, 
 Those children are long gelatinous to the hills? 
 
 But the coarse black star has follow'd the stars 
 Sprung down the barn winding pass past our lips. 
 Now the blackbird has thick water and their trousers stopt 
 With all his hips. 
 
 The stage is lost, boy's and whirling flies
