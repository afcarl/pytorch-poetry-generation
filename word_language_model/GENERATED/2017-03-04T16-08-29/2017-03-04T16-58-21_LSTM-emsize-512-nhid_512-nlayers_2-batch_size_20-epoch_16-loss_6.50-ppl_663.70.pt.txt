And Dust Sycamore Covers The Old Books 

 In the jerky country. 
 
 The square men gray on the chinks-- 
 The floor is dried upon the drunks 
 I hear the foremost man at hands. 
 So evening in heaven takes out 
 Drawn from the remorseless doors, 
 And hills of blood and mossy volts 
 By dusk, the snow-mist piled me mildly hoar 
 To the dark crackling clouds of men and women, 
 Yet my heart not onward cloud nor bird gave me;
