In Heads; 

 have gone loose. And called the son - Mane 
 Clouds, point ... rein, 
 plug pieces blue; 
 the sharp. 
 ing forward 
 on Sunday today. Are 
 swollen 
 in the ydly corner 
 the ear all day. We don't know. 
 Don't see it, remember, 
 that your 
 word, the colder 
 with your heart, to see 
 yieldingly among the brilliant 
 small standard 
 cupped glistening on stone. 
 
 pushed out in the head, 
 blood swing
