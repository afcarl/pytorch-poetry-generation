Whirlpool Tolled. 

 And tho' it is my mother's Grani 
 It is almost near, and then it is. 
 
 
 
 
 The Eight Market at the Late End 
 
 
 On the closet at battered afternoons 
 I saw tribe. 
 
 The fog is still gauge out of sight, 
 The spray falls and reds and the swamp 
 fisted into the cafeteria 
 And not in flame it must end. 
 Not in the thicket of birds 
 The wind ascended bars.
