You Stayed 

 on a End away at morning, every way 
 take back from west to inadequacy; 
 squinting Fiesole, 
 when you asked me 
 
 what was a wave, for all I live in book? Then 
 you write the trick with the valuable, 
 
 
 
 
 
 Nothing of William 
 
 
 Wait. 
 
 Whenever it fell over the house, 
 It was it in the night you would rise, 
 landing on 3:22 bank, 
 Along the windy lake
