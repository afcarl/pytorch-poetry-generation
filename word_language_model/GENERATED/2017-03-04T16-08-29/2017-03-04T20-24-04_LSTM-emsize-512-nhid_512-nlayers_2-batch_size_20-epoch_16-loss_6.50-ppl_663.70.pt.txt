To Birthright 

 Lord, who will not go on and leave it Andy 
 Unto the tenth heart of the stars 
 Where the other fathers eat Duck 
 And the turning "Captain, yet the fun! 
 The stars go bare to the base of the couple, 
 
 And the wheels that are apt to gather their bodies 
 Out of their corruption after the sea & way. 
 
 The sonne here is dead, the light 
 Is made of all its murder and grown free.
