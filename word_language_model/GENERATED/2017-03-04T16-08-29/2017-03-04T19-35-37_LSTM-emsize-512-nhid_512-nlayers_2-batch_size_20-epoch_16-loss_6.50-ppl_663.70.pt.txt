Thin-Rankt Universe. 

 
 thirtieth lonely would ever be. 
 
 My children fade sideways. 
 I am the patient man, lake's man. 
 The cows are Flud But Murphy's altar cruise 
 snude air stacks down fading 
 or plastic as hard stone, cool snow bones 
 tear over Discipline. bucket wilde, 
 the radiator toilet leaf descends 
 upon a wing that glides the dark 
 despight; and lift past Lingering--and 
 boarded by the high asphalt clusters of a Cave 
 that is his glass
