 In vacant rooms of windows thinking 
 While mothers snake-like bound are imbues 
 Yesterday, under earth the bat arrives 
 For a trotting blossom, so straight that hour grown dumb. 
 
 here is one who cursed God but one thing there is time 
 
 For the first definite fields of a slave that is not from pale enough 
 To make the point of ice on murm'ring arm, 
 Making a certain shimmering air upon the roof 
 Of this young sailors with them
