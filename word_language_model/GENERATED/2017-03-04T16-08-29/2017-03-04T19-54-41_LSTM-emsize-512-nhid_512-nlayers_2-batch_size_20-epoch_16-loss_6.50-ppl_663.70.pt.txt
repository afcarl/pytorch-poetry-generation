 hawking tiers against flood, sifting 
 On the vines and leaves, and the outlet men, 
 Pursuing their Black lungs, Oft 
 Seas of flicker: the birds crawl back, 
 The hounded growth of houses blow the street.

 Wait for now permeated and drear, 
 Poised in the hall, with its song of rites 
 Fix from white: at night 
 And
