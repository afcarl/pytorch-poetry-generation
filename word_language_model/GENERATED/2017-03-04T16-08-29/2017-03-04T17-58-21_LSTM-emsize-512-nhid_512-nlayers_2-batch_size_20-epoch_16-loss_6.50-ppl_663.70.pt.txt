The Asphalt. 

 
 Give me the Lady in all the night again. 
 
 Still my soul 
 Persists, my face with the smallest prize 
 he does not know he has something to do. 
 And you're thought 
 though I don't feel His friends -- 
 yesterday people come 
 at losing what you wrong 
 or that you are now. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Aura.' 
 
 
 To San Ply 
 cotton de aumbulance 
 wear the Books and toes.
