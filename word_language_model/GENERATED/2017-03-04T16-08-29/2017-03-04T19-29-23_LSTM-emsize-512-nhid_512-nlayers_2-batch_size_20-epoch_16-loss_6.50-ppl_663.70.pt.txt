Squad Suturing Her 

 My skin is her very trumpery sorrow 
 The sweet face of my life ... 
 The grass a moth has drawn. 
 Round the sunlight her breast is white with iron, 
 And the grandmothers ascended bang sunset 
 And the sunlit flukes of Christmas streams, 
 Shine at their deep notebook. 
 
 And then their acquaintance found 
 How their eyes sigh and slept by the spring 
 Among one's feet. 
 I hear many birds well lying down. 
 Hope
