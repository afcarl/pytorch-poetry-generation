 
 With arms open to morn; the rest of 
 
 ukuleles at night 
 seems vast, into the sun, in its diamond 
 place where it's held beautiful. Five phlox 
 weeds toward cool Hall. What shapes are you? 
 
 Coming and make 
 
 broken vestige 
 
 of Napper tangled brick in a cone 
 of persuade; words and whining of flaw, 
 earth's drawl of marble. sustainability, musk of constant lead-whites, 
 
 earth, all auctioning. 
 
 Raptures from the crater
