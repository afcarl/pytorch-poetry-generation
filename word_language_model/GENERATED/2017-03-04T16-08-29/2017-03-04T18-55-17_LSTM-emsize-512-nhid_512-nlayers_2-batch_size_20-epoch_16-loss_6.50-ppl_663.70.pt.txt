 How did the subtle winter Surrounding 
 
 Few lapis of days to imp 
 Fingers and melodies, 
 Fair Derbyshire. 
 
 Make canaries bride in apologizes, 
 Hail, minds of pears and cock, 
 Wherever all are governed by the diamond 
 And their horses to the infants who feed and upon them, 
 Said their last white tops come out from afar 
 Expressionless, columns, dead within things.
