Now, 

 That premises of careening ... and CORRECTION: 
 The way score: 
 A woman as these. 
 
 Look, much in sight. 
 I felt my family dying. 
 When she was drowning 
 Out I sat on her bed like a lover 
 I dreamt you didn't want me blackness 
 They walked through the fog 
 Moving onto the public street 
 At the morning stopping 
 To level on singing hands 
 ill-knit red moons and lemons 
 Black shapes of sorrow
