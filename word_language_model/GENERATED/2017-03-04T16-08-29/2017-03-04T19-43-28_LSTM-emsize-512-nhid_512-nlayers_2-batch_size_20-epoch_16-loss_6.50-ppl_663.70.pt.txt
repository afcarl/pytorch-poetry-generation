 catapulting sticks and hooves and amber columns 
 hookers--who'd butter! napkins, wine wood-bine relishing Pine,

 Ask me this very weather. Home is the deepest 
 And Possibility of three foolish loves 
 The Declamation lie.

 linger'd on the cold surf of your path. 
 This high darkness with no lock of night? 
 There are no foolish music, properly (and Swans 
 Sore sultry Nation
