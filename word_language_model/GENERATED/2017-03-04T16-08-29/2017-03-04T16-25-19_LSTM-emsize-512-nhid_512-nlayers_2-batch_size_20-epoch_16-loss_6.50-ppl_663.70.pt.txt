All That Hoped 

 Hart's lit deep by his best, 
 
 And remembers no division 
 Not hers, but will." Attic 
 Young amphorae. Madonnas de Unfortunate 
 blacking whose destin'd poems were for 
 Most sacred sweetness, where both that? 
 Is me a better duty to kill ... 
 Say it be despair 
 To me to forsake it! 
 
 I was not told by pity 
 Where I would be the stars' take 
 The world means he does not think before.
