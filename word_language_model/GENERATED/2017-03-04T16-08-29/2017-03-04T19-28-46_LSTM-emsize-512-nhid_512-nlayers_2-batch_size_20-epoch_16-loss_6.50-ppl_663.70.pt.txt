Tunnels In Her Ears, 

 skin against a parked wall, terrifying quiet 
 Than a scrap of the river and rain up the west 
 waywardness, back in the street. Or when 
 The tree is lights--out and the stray 
 Heavy midnight, and the city 
 20 words have no dominion. 
 
 3 
 West days, hiding in hand, 
 Smoothing the names we wrestled 
 To the fire we carved 
 In needs. I had to say what 
 Coming 
 For lunch or rain.
