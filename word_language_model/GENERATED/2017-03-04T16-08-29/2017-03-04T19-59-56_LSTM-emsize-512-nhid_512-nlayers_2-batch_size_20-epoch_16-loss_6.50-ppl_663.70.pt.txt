 For they who give life less than this 
 To do the darker throat of the wind! 
 Than a fan. 
 In the clustered rivers, 
 And in the valley evening night, 
 All we have heard in the decanter's erreth; 
 Here expand one- like flakes of hay, 
 Where the starv'd willow wing. 
 
 Dead times with a laden sound: 
 The ragged spires of the forgiv'n. 
 Lights rather pen, the wakeful care, 
 Buy their right limbs, and Christabel 
 Called
