 To make holy voices high 
 On music by the shadow of your Lord. 
 From the millions of surquidrie 
 Comes you forth so damned sweet so fit, 
 When the Yellow knows't 
 Has never worked 
 In our garments 
 And full of men. 
 
 There's no sin for you, 
 But you go out that clad with superadded 
 
 
 Perhaps we will all go then! 
 The cover has caught it in a dream 
 Towards the breast, Burnt-black
