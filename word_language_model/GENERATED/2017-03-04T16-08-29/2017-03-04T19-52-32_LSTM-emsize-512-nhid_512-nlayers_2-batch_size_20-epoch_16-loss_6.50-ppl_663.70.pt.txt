Horse'S Body Float, Farmland, 

 Why wilt thou give it late for us to hear the yoke, 
 And make a fearful kiss it lord of to-morrow 
 And, rising and from the snows of gargle I perish me. 
 
 
 
 
 
 that/coin-flip/either 
 
 
 The sun's martial eyes do Parkdale, 
 fear: A crop of lifeless more, 
 The terrible sea is its glorious corn; 
 And the shrill hairs of the tangled schools, 
 The lily reflecting the stir of brink.
