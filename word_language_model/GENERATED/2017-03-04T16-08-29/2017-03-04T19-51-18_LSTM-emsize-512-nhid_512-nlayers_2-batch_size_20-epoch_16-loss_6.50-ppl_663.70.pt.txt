Let Be. 

 
 That somewhere had a heart to tell 
 The tale of Palm-tree furniture, 
 pausing while it was: it became healed, 
 sterres, nuts grow Selihot 
 A dime, burning through his trunk 
 And blackening his surest trunk 
 Up to the vaulted current cools 
 As many sharp buds as a prey; 
 In which, on every shady rock 
 Far off, far rest, tinged with crown, 
 Newton: wings: Ideolog an O! 
 blush never lost on civil place.
