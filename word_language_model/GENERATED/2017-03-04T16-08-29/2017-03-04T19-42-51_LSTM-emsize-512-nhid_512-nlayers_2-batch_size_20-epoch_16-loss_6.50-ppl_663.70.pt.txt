Then When I Do, 

 Fell up by children, and behold, 
 Bearing so bright, that, cold, by sweet love; 
 spankings. Upon the hill, on Baden-Baden, 
 To tickle the noons with the running calm 
 Over the waterfall. Which through 
 The pointing casts away 
 A pensive road, a visible flower. 
 As the wind trees blowing from the boughs 
 Of the sea go to down; Death is not John? 
 
 Red sails pass leaves-- 
 XXIV 
 After blind horn, came--a pie;
