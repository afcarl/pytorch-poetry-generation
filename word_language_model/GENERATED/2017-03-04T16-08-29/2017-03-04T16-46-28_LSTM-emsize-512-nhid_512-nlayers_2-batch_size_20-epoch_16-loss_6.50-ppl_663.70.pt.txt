The March 

 Turn back to rise. 
 The cattle have nobility of flowers, 
 The stubble of noble hearts, half lifted out 
 The spray of Holland is the merest doom. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Mowing 
 
 
 They have visited under room 
 Or left off inside it. 
 You'd blame me wrote and don't ask, 
 Let us touch the Green chinks for three days 
 I met 'em with a lighter plant, 
 Which I heard them sleepless and was seen.
