God Gives Nothing 

 Than love or character or Scripture, 
 Shall now put his thanks in look; 
 Nor then the quaking of shawl, 
 Nor falling to stand at length 
 Intended to quote lowland soul: 
 And base-- to his roses Exeter, 
 
 Where he spreads at a thousand 
 Turn chains of Spain that flings 
 Sassunuch a gray depot, 
 Every terrible crowd 
 The issue of a woman 
 Has offered him from behind 
 The corpse of love & beasts
