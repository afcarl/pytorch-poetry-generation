A White Record Lamp In Frenchroll: 

 studied light, open and high. Tonight, 
 the next thing I am pigiron "Prelude 
 
 I want to turn my coat. 
 
 The sea is enough, the windows scraped back 
 is steaming like a flower, moving up into mine. 
 
 After all, even my senses, 
 
 seeing something else. 
 
 
 It seems like a plainclothesman. 
 the You've done by, I negate the lines 
 and saying to forgive. Last week I saw you.
