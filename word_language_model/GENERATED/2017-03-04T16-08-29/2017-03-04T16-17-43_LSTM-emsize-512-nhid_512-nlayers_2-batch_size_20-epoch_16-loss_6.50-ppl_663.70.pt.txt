No, You Cannot Admit Beauty 

 In Arctic gates . . . Why ? as this foolish man, 
 For do the woodman ring of fuller. 
 And silk-and-georgette with excellent terror 
 sold's but entire it is bond to do? 
 
 oh if your crew be a Pediatrics 
 To be borne, and then my heels will drink, 
 While you try from the window, not ugly, 
 But handled, in a sleep 
 For everything. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 girl--don't Morning, Dan
