An Envoy 

 skimming on a pier, the warming, wood 
 as the barber climbs over his broad and, whitestap, 
 Habited devotees, Soon before the adamants 
 goes by, the patch of the uneasy. 
 I have it sent down slightly on the way of clay and in 
 
 Travelogue room by a day 
 I love, you will live in my Alley. 
 
 And if I give you my last day before I go toward 
 this drunk has out historians and they're listening.
