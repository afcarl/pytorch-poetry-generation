 by the mother who wore her tongue to the side 
 of her son on the platform like a ashen cairn, 
 Covered with armour of northern bombing 
 
 I am a insouciant Beauty, I will love you with 
 my love into the innocence of her righteous 
 story, 
 
 I can't even lie back. 
 It is swollen with groceries 
 her shining nipples are void of you? 
 Go to Monday by blacktop. 
 
 sheets mares to sheets, 
 drops. cellar-stone?
