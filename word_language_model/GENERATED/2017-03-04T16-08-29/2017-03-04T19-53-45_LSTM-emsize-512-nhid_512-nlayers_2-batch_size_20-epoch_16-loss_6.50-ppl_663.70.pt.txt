From The World 

 to teach her how these hills arguing 
 on the earth, far off, men gazed in, 
 never cross them, and, in trees, they come, 
 like girls or father. And the other pain 
 is about enough, inside the blades 
 going warmer; they swoop greedily 
 onto the pavements underside under a rope. 
 All afternoon at a wheel 
 they snow-edged staked to sleep.

 snack. weeping. 
 His own skin heavenward, 
 as my father wears in
