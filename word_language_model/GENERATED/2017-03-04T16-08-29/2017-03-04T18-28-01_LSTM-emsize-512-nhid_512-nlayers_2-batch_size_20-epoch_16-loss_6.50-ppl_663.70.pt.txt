Play'D: 

 But not for that this plant, it sits yet there, 
 And tells the tall standard dead, 
 And listens to the bard and with the enemy 
 humanly "call and still before favorably 
 A gift. A pleasant large, brown cowhide free, 
 A glimpse of crawling nerves at all-- 
 Some only last, the nation's steps to the lawn: 
 They are of gods that have cursed the world to boys or moments, no more with. 
 The true slapping, the curious and world"
