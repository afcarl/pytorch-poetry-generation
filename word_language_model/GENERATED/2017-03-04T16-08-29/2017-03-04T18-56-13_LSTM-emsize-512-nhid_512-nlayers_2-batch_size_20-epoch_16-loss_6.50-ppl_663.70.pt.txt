They A Cloud 

 I hear that unreach'd, Hand by hair, 
 Almost with a kiss, seven or twenty simplicity 
 Of spent subtly-smiling poems. Here, here 
 This too I only wrote, being homesick in all, 
 The many-colour'd fears, I've heard myself ours? 
 
 As he leaves the big beggar from the keyboard, 
 And it makes a new charred, on the confirm'd floor. 
 No one carved in his mind O image with me 
 Or she, since there is no place of going
