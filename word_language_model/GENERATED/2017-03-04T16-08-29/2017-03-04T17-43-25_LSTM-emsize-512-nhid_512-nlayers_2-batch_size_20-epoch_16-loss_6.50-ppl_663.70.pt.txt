Receave. 

 Tall grass turnd out looking for the flood, 
 insignificance, and cours lay. 
 Against at dawn the retired owl, 
 To whom they share the Twelve years 
 And memory burning loaded in Rockland 
 In clover in the Hen-docks will be prest 
 From far away from fields into replyes, 
 The light snow presses in that thought 
 Thought though bees must hang blackened 
 Such lives yearned touch, that is not so day's 
 That lasts up to San Frown 
 picked-clean
