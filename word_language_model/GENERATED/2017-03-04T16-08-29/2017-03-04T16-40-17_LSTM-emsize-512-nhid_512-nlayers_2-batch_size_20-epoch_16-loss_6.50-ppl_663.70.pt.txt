A Dividing 

 waves. 
 
 6 
 The names of love, the miner's bones, the crows 
 Recalling my wobble eyes. 
 
 What is that 130. 
 That leads to the witch, to bearing up the light. 
 I find the seas 
 O waters, midwife say 
 What immediately ships will take it now: 
 If the world let day itself, 
 And the wind grows looked upon me like this tree, 
 Seem'd in secret power 
 In blissful motion growing 
 Of summer
