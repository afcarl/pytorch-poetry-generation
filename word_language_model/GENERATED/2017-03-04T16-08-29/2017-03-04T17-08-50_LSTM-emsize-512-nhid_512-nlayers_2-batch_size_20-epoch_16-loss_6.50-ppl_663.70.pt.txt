 a perfect brethren wishing it 
 in being turn, since 
 nothing is born ... 
 
 So nights here, so like this: 
 
 The current has cheeses 
 the sparks 
 by the mouth of Electricity 
 I know what it is 
 my name, my life. It is as that 
 this offering-up of the watchman's 
 weaponry-- grows in they 
 worship the green design. 
 And only in an silent smile 
 something the sea's knife is 
 faster umbrella, but
