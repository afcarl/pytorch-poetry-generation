 And hold it as a venison, zone in a corner. 
 
 Till the March before it 
 Is a stone born 
 
 The night is like old sheep, 
 The beat roof tastes careful 
 On a mountain leaf and brown and soft in tears 
 Like summer's cool doors of sand 
 reminiscences, past wild insects rent 
 And the cut, a ponders turn-- 
 The hammers remains 
 The gray sea of dawn the steam air and deep of roots 
 May be
