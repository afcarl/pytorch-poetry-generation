High Cave 

 above the sacred immense fields. 
 And above the bidding Mesquite, 
 shedding miles slurried 
 rocking to the bounding wheat 
 purer, veering roof from the road 
 where the goats 1959. 
 and hissing landing tobacco 
 
 till afar put just to the way 
 just below that bend sink: 
 
 "How old is pyramid-- 
 it's unconnected to you. 
 You say, seeing him somewhere. 
 thumbnail, foot in hand, 
 five girls stand 
 struggling his word.--Oscar!
