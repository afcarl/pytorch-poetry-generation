To Them 

 With a returneth burning and lugged 
 Two hands of wings in one limbo of life. 
 
 Adam's faces themselves 
 Saying gods cannot change Bennie 
 "I'm not ready past with the great men 
 But thought it must be namde: 
 Be not a man. Why they're visited 
 To the cranberries, Servant's 
 Two minutes, politic, or intricate, 
 For the smart dream ... swatches of Gods. 
 While a child's mend bright tremulous--snap--and 
 Let us go, Let us ask
