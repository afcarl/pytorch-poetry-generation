Love Is Kind. 

 Touched impatient by strain, the best will 
 afford them now, and they do not know 
 what time was occurred, 
 in the eyes of old writer 
 drives the people on Friday five 
 locking bread and amor water 
 a brother word sticky as Two 
 but as that, you waited for saying 
 much less than a raccoon menac't 
 weaves the hat, or possibly thankful, 
 or you, little not different. 
 You scratch your glasses, 
 the jetties
