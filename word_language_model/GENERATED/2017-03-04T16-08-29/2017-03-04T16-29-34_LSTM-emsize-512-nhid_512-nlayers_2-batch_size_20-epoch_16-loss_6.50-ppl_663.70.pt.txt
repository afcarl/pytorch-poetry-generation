 
 I open strangely to his grave, 
 
 In the many-coloured spheres of the locker year, 
 
 I heard the water in the sky, 
 
 I heard the sleeping stars 
 
 A gallant insect drums--so 
 
 junctions and rolling ! 
 
 yonder: crowned. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A Ground of All Drives 
 
 
 
 The jewel is of his Livelier age and cares, 
 contestant's straits and sleepless lore! 
 
 O knarred and evade thee,
