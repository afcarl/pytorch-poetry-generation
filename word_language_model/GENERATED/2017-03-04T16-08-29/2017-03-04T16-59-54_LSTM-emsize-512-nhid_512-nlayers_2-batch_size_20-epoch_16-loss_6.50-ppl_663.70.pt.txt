And Streams 

 adamant and bare, as soft as drear God: 
 We stand so low and sings! 
 
 On him by time, the piping lily 
 Are shepherd's works, least-prized 
 To such a chapel in soper sphere. 
 My Mother's lamp reneges o'er those 
 That even heaves the deep-sea world; 
 Pass down at length these streets come down. 
 Upstream his prophetess with the breast 
 He sounded them laughing to the ground. 
 
 And then, if law in battle place
