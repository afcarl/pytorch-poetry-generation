(Our Will. And The Farmer'S Carlos 

 Was kissed without any hour? 
 And then, both dead until their lives came up 
 To the train contract, that was by all the ports 
 That bore the bosoms with memory of a scowl. 
 But I could turn a grey-out through my dreams. 
 But I may gain the streets I dare to steer 
 My eyes awhile till all the ghosts are plank 
 And yet they are not Almost so much: 
 And they have exhalations
