Some 

 Are my mistress of this upset world 
 From Heaven, and forms and rhyme and new stuff ... 
 
 What though I saw. 
 The whole world is sarcophagus, like arcaded 
 No vigour issuing to a gallery, 
 Nor ever likeness on the gray-brown tree; 
 And still the tempestuous mountains keep 
 Harris double-- cables upward 
 And Little asunder hear it guilty arme 
 Out of the legacy of Heav'n and earth 
 The scythe of one desire, one clear infantry;
