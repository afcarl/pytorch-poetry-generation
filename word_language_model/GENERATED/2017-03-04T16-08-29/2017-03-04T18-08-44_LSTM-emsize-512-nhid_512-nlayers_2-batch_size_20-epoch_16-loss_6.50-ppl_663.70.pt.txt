 With whistling beers & oceans, 
 And firelight, at a short time, 
 The hand of turns freezes 
 Your character says, 
 
 
 
 
 
 Eight Romance 
 
 
 Today we talked about serious? 
 We could be two for the mutter on us. Long years, 
 It flutters and suddenly started to deal with it; 
 faith) of the dearest eye getting left of rest 
 Far bitter enough, dark eyes of heart 
 And tears would be the deep wind.
