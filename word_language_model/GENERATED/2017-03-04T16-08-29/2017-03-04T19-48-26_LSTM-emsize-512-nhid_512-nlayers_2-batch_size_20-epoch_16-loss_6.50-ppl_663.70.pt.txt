Occupation Of Cloudless Groves, 

 And thus the cloudes their ancient insect lay: 
 I plunged the grown-up faithful taper dancing 
 Will tell me what did dug, transcends my eyes. 
 
 From amazement, Hermes wing-tipped Agnes 
 Seek beguil'd; blodde that in silver taile 
 scruff. and peering at the marsh, 
 Flew broad bleeding hands and ceased, 
 And crept between them like bread, and ambassadors 
 In midst of drum; inwardly, daunce of air: 
 The Tree! Here strew the feathers of an Vale!
