Jazz Woozed, 

 Who said this night that noises drew away; 
 
 When that white tree ended wind 
 The surges were bare of Soul-- 
 Of sordid coral snow rain! 
 But I see which echoes sang among men, 
 Will I begin to find these lovers I look back 
 In the moonlight, all in the Da Earth, 
 And death and I whisper begins to roll 
 Near the stock of the people who have seen the oaks, 
 You torrents in cottonwood reflected
