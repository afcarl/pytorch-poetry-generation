Cure, 

 Where they remain must be Appointed, who sent like them might 
 Pleasures of peculiar motion as was that slope 
 If yours had ever tramped and heard the race 
 Of God: labouring at years, and fools that whine 
 On the crescent window, and thence combine, 
 And then I'd known the weary spirit came. 
 
 All it is written, the mortal and dark foot-step 
 As though some doom by which the mind so bow'd, 
 Shall deadweight said, To shake down
