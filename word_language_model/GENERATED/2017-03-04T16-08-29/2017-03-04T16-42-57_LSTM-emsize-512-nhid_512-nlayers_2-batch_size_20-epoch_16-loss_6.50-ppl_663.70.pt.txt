The First Beautiful Woman 

 and she shut her chunks of speech 
 down the front door. 
 
 The birch man, the screen 
 her along the window, household. 
 
 He tries no repeating The darkness 
 above the door. In weeks miles he came 
 goes / on the stool. In the childhood--oh, 
 colored houses below 
 the Thames' scenes and the wheel avenue I heard to see 
 your voice inside you, my mother's voice 
 glowing under the javelins tall train
