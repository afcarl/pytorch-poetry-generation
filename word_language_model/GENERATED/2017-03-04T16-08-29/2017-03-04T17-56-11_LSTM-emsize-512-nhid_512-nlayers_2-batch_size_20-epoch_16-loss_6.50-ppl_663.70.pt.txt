Stopped Brownie 

 No, my vice is an end of wood. 
 You were taught me to get that nothing is. 
 Oh yes, then you are losing so? 
 Ask me afterwards depend; Arabs starve them? 
 No further for me if you don't like to me 
 Fate's and waxwings when a cashier who meets me long; 
 But John came on to help me somebody said indeed, 
 Thank you B. dickerous, may be Suburbiton 
 Or leave the difference, and the puny mask pine-boughs
