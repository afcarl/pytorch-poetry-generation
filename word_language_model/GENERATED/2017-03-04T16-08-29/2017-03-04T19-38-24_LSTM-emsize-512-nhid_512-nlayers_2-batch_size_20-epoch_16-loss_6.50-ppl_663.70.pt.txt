 Galen, 'Tis the place of blindness 
 Of one who means mass and man; 
 Give it to the centre and the sky, 
 And the voice that his marriage shed 
 And close we start to rake on dog, 
 Too like teeth of one sweetheart, 
 I am a man of subtracting 
 Man is in the flesh seems! 
 A subtle laugh, shoes and fee, 
 "And Lord I, this can--. 
 
 Weenie divine,
