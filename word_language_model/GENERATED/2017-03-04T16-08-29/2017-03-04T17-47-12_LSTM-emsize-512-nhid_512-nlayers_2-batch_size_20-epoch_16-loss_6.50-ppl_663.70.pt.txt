 For the earth's first perfect choir we confuse 
 Cry down mine, and now the will die. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 For Doctor Weddings, You 
 
 
 Don ha, George rocks driven from the Eastern Atheists of men after me, 
 freedom, tonight, who jumped into her stream. 
 Vandergast and her sekki approached me, the fringe shall cast out deep against my blood, 
 Laid my hatred, breathing looking up. The forced look of the rest out of the loss.
