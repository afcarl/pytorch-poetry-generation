Candle-Flames And Talk, 

 Or lips, by the THEM? we found 
 Perhaps, like that Lou. But now we stood gauchos 
 Discovery and flat, dwelling after a year, 
 gemearcod, impaird. lush blue, languishment. general 
 criminal. And yet, in all turn hills under the sun and west, 
 Almost little animals whose coats lengthen where they fought of laughter, 
 Burns to passage and fell in the brilliant race of night Tamalpais 
 In shells lost in thirty-six, also time after year is before. 
 Bizarre!
