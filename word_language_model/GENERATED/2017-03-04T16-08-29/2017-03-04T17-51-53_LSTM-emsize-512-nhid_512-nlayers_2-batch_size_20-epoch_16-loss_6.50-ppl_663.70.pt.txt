That Barns, Like The Winds In Them. 

 And later, as in the one earth's spotting one drum 
 before the hour have treated in its suits 
 its network of untainted, 
 and sashes, of melting folly? 
 wire, birds all animals in glint of sky 
 to buy the whisper of the horizon 
 to the island's broken glare of cars, 
 a branching wheel, dispatched 
 hacked forbidden or heft by the Anarchists 
 and westward back. A ebbing darkening.
