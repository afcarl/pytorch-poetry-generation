Box. 

 
 The arms, all loose and half lyfe, 
 As some 40's boarding one side 
 She drags one heavy life through glowing palm scum, 
 Sister Helen, 
 She sighs and run in small and pale 
 Until what the sun lights shone on death; 
 Where changes of delight is my lady gone 
 
 The day of summer's stars I love you; 
 Beneath this lightning caverns there is found. 
 
 Thy head kindled at windows may. 
 A pity neural then
