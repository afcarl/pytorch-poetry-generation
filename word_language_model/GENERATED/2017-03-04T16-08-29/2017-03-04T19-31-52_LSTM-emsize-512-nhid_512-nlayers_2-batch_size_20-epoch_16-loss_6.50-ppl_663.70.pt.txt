Sees Choked, 

 Jewels suffers in old men's graves and men who hate it not; 
 People give breath, and boredom a quench for their bowels and their losses and their hearts. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Three Destiny 
 
 
 I 
 I ponder that experience of mornings gins to keep their place, 
 Why should they dream alone; that so we like, we will rob the mayfly ever a mystery, 
 And a blessed start will be Happiness? as much as this is meant
