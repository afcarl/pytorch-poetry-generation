 With a glacial knot to the window. 
 I will return to speak of it, 
 Now something is dead, the demon said. 
 In fact it wasn't power, a word of change 
 But for Demurest that's not that tree: 
 Permitted out behind Else like the mousetraps? 
 And only meanly spoke about the world 
 It was as if the body were no shrine, 
 Sure my life's life is as if it were not in. 
 It was a method between things.
