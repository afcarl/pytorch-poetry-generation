 Where the soul, and the ruffled fires of darkness 
 Grass! I had surely seen all things, 
 And might 'mid gift of day and night? 
 
 From far above the world's Hesperides, 
 Flutter in many a happy hour; 
 I hear the petty ends, 
 Fair famishing fountains; 
 And still look obscure, passport, 
 They shall not fail. 
 
 I hope to see one word bow fast, 
 But No, let you, lie there: 
 I've forgot that I could love.
