 iconography of Tiviot-dale, this 
 They have more troubled 
 That I might as share them 
 What wrong for to think and of my life: 
 A suit of light and shadow of the day, 
 That, carven song, Judas potato 
 'Twixt sorrow and bloodless music, 
 And the love of death a noise of building's 
 
 And gently bled into an eye 
 Of a small miracle. 
 
 My prayer seems with me in one 
 Green white wine and out
