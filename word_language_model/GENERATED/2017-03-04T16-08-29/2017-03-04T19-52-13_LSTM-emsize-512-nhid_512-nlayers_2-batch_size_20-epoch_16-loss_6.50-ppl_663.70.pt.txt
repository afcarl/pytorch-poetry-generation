 
 And opposite very shallow waters 
 From dark rivers faint by tides of summer fair. 
 
 How many feet into the crystal 
 Winds nectar & to sea. 
 
 eye-lashed through and of sleep, not loud, 
 At search and light somehow, thy sunken breath, 
 The treasures of the ancient root. 
 The lustrous fins is peopled surgeons' 
 third, the stream, all monsters innocence 
 The body's shadow strikes thy heart. 
 
 IX. 
 In the heart, Valley of sadness.
