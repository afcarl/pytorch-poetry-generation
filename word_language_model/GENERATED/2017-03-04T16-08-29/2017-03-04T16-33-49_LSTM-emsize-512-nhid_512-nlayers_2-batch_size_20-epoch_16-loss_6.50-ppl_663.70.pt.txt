The New Hell With The Future Garland 

 your hold to Porque 
 from cloudless bikini, 
 there is also just a prey to you, 
 a imaginary supreme, a slight ring or a Caillebotte 
 a plucked troubadour down to the last holding-her-breath 
 
 and into the other familiar desert we wandered, tumbled Moonlit 
 
 on the girder the raw, reaching the front door down. 
 The nails went with environment... they still opening over 
 as though no difference of symptom ages later,
