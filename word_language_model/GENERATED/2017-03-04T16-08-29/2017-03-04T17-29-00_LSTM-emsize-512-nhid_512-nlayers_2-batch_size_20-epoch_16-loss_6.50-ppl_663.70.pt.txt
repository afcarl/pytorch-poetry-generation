His Tickets, Tigued 

 nurtured with burnished eling/ and throat! 
 There, comes the bath, the Gorging care, 
 But Greece or other looks for scopes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Dream and Women 
 
 
 We are born under these seasons 
 When, losing the Glissen'd inner greenhouses, 
 Of a day lying like the summer tree 
 To snap it, sitting from the Cuddies eye, 
 And spread its clothes in the wind. 
 
 Words of men, year life, going here;
