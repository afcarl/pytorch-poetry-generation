 That thus terms, each bursting blast, 
 To draw the images and catch my pretence 
 Blind twig. 
 But I build, with horrid dreadlocked 
 Brave invention to crestings, storms, 
 And all their murders I have begot 
 A better name!

 And drowsy pitying grains, alwaysing and brow, 
 And little instinct shall be men; 
 And each must end my plaything 
 I will not
