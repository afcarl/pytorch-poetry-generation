Bright 

 Years when I'm stars 
 
 And it will be far out of late longing, voice! 
 Meet out most quiet vandal in every dearth of moral fear, 
 I am but whence, and, safe in a sieve, will dip my shadow'd 
 Its future in real lane; an ambling picture, 
 On a face it rises from my hands, a thousand bronze reply. 
 
 subtract bees, and the men 
 Would emerge, I might attend with a finger .... 
 
 Even winter turned
