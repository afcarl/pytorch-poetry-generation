Of Honor 

 That lost--a Shamanism Hotel. 
 Slicing hlifade, 
 red sticks and trousers 
 The drink echoes on breathe. 
 
 Manayunk prunes, sincgestreona. 
 Don porridge in winter, 
 learning's Cross the yellow tide 
 And the chalked sea-birds host 
 Over going down. From blue desperation, 
 The voices of soil are nailed to the wall, 
 The crows from the tower. 
 
 O indeed the bright affections 
 exist in the air like violet Day 
 Is the river-quick anarchist Pan
