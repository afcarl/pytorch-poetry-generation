Flame; 

 How he did, good, and by he loved her Vivant 
 In love and health, by that would teach him him, 
 Destroying spirit, right to the Devil and the 
 winner. and all the monster of the effects 
 Of the competent, doing going right right, with money, he recedes, 
 And there was an invitation. 
 clobbered and pausing in the juicy autumn, locks! 
 Slow seven months old. 
 Kneeling on its royal stone the ends of silk 
 
 Jebusites to teach
