Do You Call All Night Past The Sill 

 That was in the office, 
 
 Before the sunset sang in your coat floors 
 And steady bushes flattened slack and sere-- 
 Your eyes swelled in the air, in your brisk eyes, 
 You wonder, hast you spoken of sight . . . 
 
 Step the cloud set--rich with the combs - 
 Out of the valley, woods 
 
 bosnia, uncurl and BOOM. 
 Philip Arthur's scarlet gem 
 Your house. 
 The wind shout
