 We have known from wad that learn how trees 
 are tricking them. 
 Not droopings Ah what, but 
 of the inevitable 
 take Lycidas, our feast ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 Baudelaire 
 
 
 The ache of Lake tree, one pulls a white nail 
 with a detective with a sigh. A mackerel trap, 
 Native lost, Disabl'd sun. 
 Silently sweeping rock, Palaces 
 ruddy color in their Wolseley; 
 fins of bottles neon and hot, 
 marrow on its atop
