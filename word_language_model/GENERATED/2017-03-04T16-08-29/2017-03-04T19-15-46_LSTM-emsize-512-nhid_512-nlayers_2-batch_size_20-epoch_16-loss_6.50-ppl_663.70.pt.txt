Its Own Casket, 

 Its canvas voyages as arrows 
 Were out, and the Good, to nothing came 
 And as on the morning Yiddish (Stone-coloured chains, 
 The two eye dripping up for new ago; 
 Work by peace is free, without its end 
 About itself here and then, one lunch. 
 
 Suppose it was a hardly sea, but he, 
 In the light there are the holy waves, 
 And among a hundred corpses dwelt down, 
 The moon, breaking from acquires, 
 Day
