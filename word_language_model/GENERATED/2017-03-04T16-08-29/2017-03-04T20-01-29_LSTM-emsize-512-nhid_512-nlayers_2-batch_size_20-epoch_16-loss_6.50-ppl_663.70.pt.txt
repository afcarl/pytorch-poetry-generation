To Bard 

 I painted its tired and clean strayned, 
 That faded men around clothes and rapture 
 And bending slowly into seas 
 That trembled from the splintered rasping brain, 
 The loud rhyme, that bull the sick, 
 Was like the sage in breadth of faith. 
 
 And turned through tears and drifted paths 
 To live with them, prophesied, 
 Any motion of the eye 
 Nor to Alvaro but battle-line, 
 Would detect these locks, that meets them morrows 
 And human
