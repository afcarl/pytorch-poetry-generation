 
 I hold for the world's speak, and sang to know, 
 Whereon I had no flesh{"e}s place 
 For gold. . . . no king now knows 
 With what guilt they saw in one hand me mar 
 My mind's health. We might Tel 
 Go with them into them as they were, 
 Holding records to the wind's meniscus, 
 You've heard this, I see order before, 
 And with my care I'll wander here, 
 Lest there's me to come out in human
