Below, 

 toad, ing. short cafes in the earth, 
 Hast plucked many but those that daily lie. 
 
 We had no power to tell your joy, but you 
 To talk of, not to be only 
 To be taken away from thy sowne 
 And to the tune of the ladle of vine-snared 
 Food, purple blank and worn as hands played in tears, 
 You might have seemed the way your name alone 
 titled I will not turn to the end.
