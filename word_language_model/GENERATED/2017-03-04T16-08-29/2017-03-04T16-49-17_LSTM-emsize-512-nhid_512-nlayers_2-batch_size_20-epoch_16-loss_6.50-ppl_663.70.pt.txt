To Mind Me Again, It'S Persuaded, 

 for flow'rs or dirty wing, everywhere, 
 short love or lack of enterprise. 
 My own lion, Achilles, 
 rather than my Lordship's "took 
 struggling against the macaronis 
 calls intolerable rags as it 
 must, every sky- tile terracing 
 And--the Stories arrived 
 through mattes city. There I didn't 
 hear her kneels downstairs and beside me, 
 to the objects of tusk; 
 Taiwan. Border obituaries 
 hauling up my magic cause. 
 
 She wants to.
