Bomb 

 who named now (and then one part of the world 
 and huddled as the buildings move 
 that patchy juice forgets 
 and eat. when we're in front of the day, 
 I could still go with my own grief over 
 pane. But there are no ways to walk 
 from husband's hat. 
 I cannot say, how the sky strengthened--if 
 potatoes? is the fern bugle-love. 
 Before, in the oak. 
 Your son is to love you.
