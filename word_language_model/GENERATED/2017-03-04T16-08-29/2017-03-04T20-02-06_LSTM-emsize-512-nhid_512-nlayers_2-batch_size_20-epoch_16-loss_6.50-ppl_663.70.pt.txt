To Be. 

 What may they do These 
 That there are fond 
 August, on Sunday nights, 
 Let us went back to last. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Holy Magic ! Madam, 
 
 
 In my eyes I see the freezing sun, 
 the massive body of my mind. 
 Big ruins, over the heights of my Jersey 
 mouth and face, the mouth fixed DINNER, 
 packed like mirrors buying the shape. 
 Queen long, December trunks are mine. 
 Straight flies below
