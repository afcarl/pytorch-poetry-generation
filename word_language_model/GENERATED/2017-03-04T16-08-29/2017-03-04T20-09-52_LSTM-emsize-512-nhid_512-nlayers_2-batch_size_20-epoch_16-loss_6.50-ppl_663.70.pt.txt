These Thousand Newspapers 

 Buy all communion with the hearts 
 Of an open cage, like nothing in a loss, 
 From a happy mirrors of pride, 
 Whose sound drawn out beyond Dublin flies 
 From childhood's hour of lost slain suns 
 
 That screen the train with its own alter. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Night of Mountains 
 
 
 1 
 
 In the distance pile prepares. 
 
 1. The oaths at her paws, 
 
 looks narrow up from enjoying
