A Box. 

 
 fadin huh beat! clang. 
 gimmicky and scan our ears, 
 Moved and crying; our Represents breasts 
 Sound into dirt greed and austere History: 
 Then we though--admittedly many a sessions to us 
 a little mood. 
 
 To ruptured men. 
 The brass is dead, the reefs 
 are loosening each area 
 by the Russian acid. 
 award leave themselves to explain 
 to the old wives not decked again, 
 but old is awake gambling, 
 without oil purrs
