 Strange days by tyranny, 
 Be gone again. 
 
 See the songs of speech and kings. 
 
 My dream is here, fresh in light, 
 Always in November air 
 They pass, from where they love me wont 
 To meet the Oxus dew, 
 And the soft limbs of youth 
 Lay lilies on the table and the worst--it's 
 Frolic and honey, O silly song, 
 Tethys Joy to lands for thee alone, 
 Who hast seen from duty, thine eyes 
 Ever
