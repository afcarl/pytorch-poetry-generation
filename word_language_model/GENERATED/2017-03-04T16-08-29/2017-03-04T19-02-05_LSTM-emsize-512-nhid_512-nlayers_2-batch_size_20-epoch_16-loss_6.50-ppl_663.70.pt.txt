I Am Swinging Like To Swim 

 into a quiet and darkness of Deo. 
 
 I have two got on 
 my head 
 means something of a young woman. 
 evaporations? blooie does size, 
 the tiniest trunk 
 where waves prick the ocean 
 into withered stone or 
 scratching low patches wings, 
 head of lilies onesweeping 
 ruined through stones, 
 stilettoes combed doors 
 a soft blue belt 
 still stirring the throat of the ash, 
 light marked them, honey-colored overnight
