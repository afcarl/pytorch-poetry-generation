Made From West. 

 The streets were open and the time 
 filled with decision in long spring. 
 These were the songbirds 
 where all the things leapt to rise 
 from many brittle, thousand years 
 
 following into wait the body caught 
 in between them, thin and eight, 
 
 the Coming as they seem, 
 and the three-and-a- infamous atter 
 with meaning, a antlers to swell 
 like the bouquet of plenty, they entered 
 each other's gestures to its mind.
