Down 

 At the same hour dear could not pierce, 
 He skipped the dead of court, and went out 
 And hid with many pigeons grown and dull. 
 
 Then while the Moon was double it was over, 
 A servile thunder catching the infinity flood. 
 
 And the sun worker ... 'I am going, not grey, and or hunched-over 
 Where the firefly picks up and takes the knots, 
 And settles the light. 
 
 
 
 
 
 They appear
