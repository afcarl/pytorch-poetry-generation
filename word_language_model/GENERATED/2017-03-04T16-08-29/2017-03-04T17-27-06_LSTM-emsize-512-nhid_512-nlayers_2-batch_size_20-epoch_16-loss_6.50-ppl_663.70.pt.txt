A Weekend Special Pin. 

 Yet is not what is most fair she has been, 
 That one is free to see. 
 
 
 
 
 
 At the Edge 
 
 
 FOR threatened-- Woman over Light, the sea, Tranquilizes world on the breast of heaven that empties the land of soul, forever sleeping where the stunned iron floor winter; your first is prepared to an end, is our own memory equal then the wind, or whether they die of cold, or wholly wholly flowers together--circle
