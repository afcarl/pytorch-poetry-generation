On Town And Sea, 

 A pattern whose shapes so well we felt, 
 Small faith, too terribly thought, we will 
 Too soon to try to strike the briars 
 Of whitethorn dale the sacred elm-tree 
 
 Sisters, down the plank that badge may rise 
 Through air on docks, while pushing down the breeze. 
 If it could heal its hero's change Wint, 
 An octopus, suspicious own or ill, 
 To exist at thy will. 
 My tomb is heard; I love.
