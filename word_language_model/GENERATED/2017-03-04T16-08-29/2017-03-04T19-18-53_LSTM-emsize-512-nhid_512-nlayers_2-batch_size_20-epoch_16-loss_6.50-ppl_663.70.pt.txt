Whispered? Pain And 

 wastes pom-poms, over her straining head 
 one fabulous fancy; her train, slurping 
 like a destroyed squall 
 sucking in her mouth like a siren's 
 cornflowers. 
 Its sweat-stained dahlias. 
 Gewat a picture purpose 
 
 as Eagerness does dying, almost 
 make too little of her study. They names 
 which whatever they carry voting from her only 
 sympathy. 
 
 * 
 
 in it, she says. "Bounded teeth 
 loaded with ureters, 
 not too far.
