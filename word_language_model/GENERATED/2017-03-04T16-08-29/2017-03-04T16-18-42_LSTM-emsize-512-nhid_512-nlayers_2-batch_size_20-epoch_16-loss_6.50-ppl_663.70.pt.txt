To Dance, 

 Bathing in college, 
 As Myth, and waited. 
 
 Ah, ah, bowls, we may maverick. 
 fuckin in the in's zeal, 
 We would die it well idiosyncracy 
 But put not crimson from the shelf. 
 
 percussion, in Directed Nature's style 
 Is told, returned on deeper hands 
 Beat man's ears before it dust, 
 here--heaving, and dip like little pints 
 From Cook? blackwhi-te- among the pines, 
 And cities then with deeds to gales 
 Through the vast weeds,
