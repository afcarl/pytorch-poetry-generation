And Showers 

 praying-mantis river on the earth, earning. 
 
 There was a peanut somehow play'd 
 From a huge spot to blister, 
 
 Close a rose down, 
 suffer'd. 
 As we clean it, 
 It was a little sad 
 dentist dressed in a girl's face. 
 
 
 
 
 
 After the Fireweed, trellises 
 
 
 I've wandered there, for Baboon 
 wants nineteenth-century paddle-poled, mee problem. 
 I fear then, it's my last time; 
 
 I bag: kidney salts
