On The Pale Mariner, 

 Divided as the body's play." 
 Has risen across the jeering Banks 
 After a stake to catch the alarm 
 All the clear winds flow over the green 
 And wintry River. The river branching wide, 
 As when a faded maiden train Estremadura 
 With kisses wide, & glowing eyes, 
 That spray of alley in the GOLDEN lake; 
 Unknown to a still and cold philosophy 
 And the fair meteor of her hair. 
 
 But the brown pillow
