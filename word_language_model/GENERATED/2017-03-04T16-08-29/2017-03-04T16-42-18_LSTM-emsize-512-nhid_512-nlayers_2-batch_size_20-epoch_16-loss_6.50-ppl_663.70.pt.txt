To Hopeless? 

 mildest doors like flags, nobody can 
 take love or place in love or fear. 
 
 I give my way to myself 
 behind people in a scene of corn 
 where wound-up begins them, 
 cypresses boarded up 
 and knees and muscle among 
 the nettle whispers the covers 
 with the Sancti weal-- 
 let me take my first work. 
 
 Devonshire. 
 An Atlantic corner, a calm stretcht 
 stretches a book holding Blind 
 unwound invisibly lockboxes
