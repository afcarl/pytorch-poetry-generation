Air 

 to lie on the bottom of the moon 
 and warmed the jaws of my ribs 
 and I followed to the groove 
 to speed and crawled 
 over six mile down, 
 calling the fourth crazy line, 
 the acids of sweat 
 rising up through the blackness 
 that shines by the side 
 of transition for someone 
 and rolled the bones in a corner 
 of letting answer the ambiguous thanks! 
 
 whether to open on rising 
 the Hudson
