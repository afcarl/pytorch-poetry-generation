Had You Saw. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 It Was Not a block: 
 
 
 Frost is icy 
 
 grapes that are extravagant, 
 do not fly. 
 
 No so Trouble else. 
 The snake is always alive. 
 They examine Rome 
 we'd never be built together, 
 not driving; the one 
 is so meager 
 the dress is tinder 
 and footsteps 
 
 of brilliance that buries 
 his form a dozen will 
 
 breaking that dark untrodden
