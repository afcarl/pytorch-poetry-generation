Slight It Move Past Going, 

 A two-foot circular seed, 
 As smoky to the other His warp of lip made the gift, splintered with desires and the bosom. 
 
 (Mary) 
 fresh-poured lamp, muttering, far away! On the shell away, lullay. clean, 
 Another jesus yes, that pause, not convincing; whom I do know 
 Go with me. There's not much in any room or streamas, 
 Whatever I want, I'd just say? 
 Even yet there's nothing about the path that is merely sport,
