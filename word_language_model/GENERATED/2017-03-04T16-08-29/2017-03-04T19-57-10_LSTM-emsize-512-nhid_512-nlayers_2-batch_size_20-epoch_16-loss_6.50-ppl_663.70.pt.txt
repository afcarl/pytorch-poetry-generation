Our Choice: 

 Together I hear your 
 silent will hammered so craving 
 to make the wish it does, a nervous scrap 
 and a horse & gegongen Your eyes were unkissed, 
 though it does, led us back to Santa 
 
 Open your ears and closed your cape, we ate 
 the short Sally. office icicle from the riverbank 
 worlds salute double blood, you crossing 
 the whorls of palm collapse for roses, 
 frozen to collapse for places. 
 One could does.
