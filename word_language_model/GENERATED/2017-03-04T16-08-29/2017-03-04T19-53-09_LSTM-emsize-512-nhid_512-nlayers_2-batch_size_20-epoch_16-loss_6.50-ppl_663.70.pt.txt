 
 Who are needed really shaping for all things, 
 
 And of joy the one poured low. 
 
 A fine old word in a loud fashion, 
 
 Has cloacal all profound, 
 
 Can't give me bend, 
 
 Green and Sybil 
 
 Giving a chunk of bone books 
 
 With a dark or cold Ivy weight 
 
 Into his outstretched winds. I should try 
 
 To see my ease be magic 
 
 To dight from his wounds horror.
