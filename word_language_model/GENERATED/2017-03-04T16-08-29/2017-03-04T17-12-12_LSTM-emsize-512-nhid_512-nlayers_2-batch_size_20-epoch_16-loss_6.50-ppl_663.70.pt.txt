 
 seventh, all the night! This Poet bears 
 The poem among all, Dogg'd what time is 
 Of grassy hounds and hair in Sunday years. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Sixhiboux Vincents The Mouse at East accuser. The River Story 
 
 
 Ye telephone embroidering a shamel d'insomnie chest and vibrate gold 
 deep from the limb, 
 radiant as a ash lamp 
 Hearts hard, on the gravel. 
 Words of some country change the soul there 
 
 native-- dulness,
