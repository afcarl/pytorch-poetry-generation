And Another Way. 

 
 upstaid; 
 I dancing in a mass nearly caroled a friend 
 Holding out the fear of Florence 
 That measures you at the cage 
 Who marks me close 
 Your tooth of sunlight and shame. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Legend 
 
 
 15 
 
 As the threads have been 
 yellow and opened, 
 driving toward the trees. 
 4-way naked, naked, 
 right in egg and coughed in the parlor, 
 a young woman whines
