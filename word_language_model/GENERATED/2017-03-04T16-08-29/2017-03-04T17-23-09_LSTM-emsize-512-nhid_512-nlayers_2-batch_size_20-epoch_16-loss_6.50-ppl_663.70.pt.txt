A New Ham 

 Incorporated's game: 
 Below the highway table and laying 
 A barrel-organ belt over the brim, 
 And there in amorous cloud the watches Isles 
 medlee thundered, and all about a war. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sonnet 
 
 
 I behold as my father died my ghastly self 
 In love in his hand, I'm not able to admit myself 
 yet. I move up and say braw intimate immigrant snares, 
 And send them back in a hundred years
