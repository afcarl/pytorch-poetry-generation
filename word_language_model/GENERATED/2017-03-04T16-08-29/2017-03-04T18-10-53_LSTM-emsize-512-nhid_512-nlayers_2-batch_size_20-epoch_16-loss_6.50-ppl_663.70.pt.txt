Coals, 

 Reminded they could whirr as they have more than these, 
 The evil is as silent as ever. 
 On them you are and grant me, you had not heard -- 
 There's never a place to be wrought by the spring; 
 But now I am still among you, 
 Spirits that have hushed all you will have slain, 
 Not me you shall make of all the world 
 As I dream and sleep in my hands! 
 
 Yet only your own heolde,
