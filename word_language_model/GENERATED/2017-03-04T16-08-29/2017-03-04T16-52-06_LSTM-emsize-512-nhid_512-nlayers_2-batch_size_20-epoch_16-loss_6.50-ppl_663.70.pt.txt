Company, 

 live? 
 
 When they tasted my guilt their steeple, their shoots, 
 That only invented the gasoline flex 
 With Sweet-smelling, pales and blacke faces spread 
 Round every canvas, and nan 
 In dust they could not speak: 
 
 When they got out to blow, 
 Who fell in the charlatan 
 And eyes lance in stone white as gold: 
 A Poet's song fell for me when I drink, 
 Teach me to speak, and made the share. 
 
 Her head
