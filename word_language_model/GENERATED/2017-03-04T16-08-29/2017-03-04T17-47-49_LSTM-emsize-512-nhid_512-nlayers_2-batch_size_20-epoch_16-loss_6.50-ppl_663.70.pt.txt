Nerve, One Had Fled 

 Most Million and the engine was torn from him.

 The beast of his teeth were broken to embrace 
 He gave us the sin that he would be old. 
 He'd leap, as we slept in the chaos of curb, 
 We gave them some new Dominations 
 To change our newspapers. The effect is the tidings dine. 
 We have express the struggle which is his mind 
 Tore in it, just as underground as sea.
