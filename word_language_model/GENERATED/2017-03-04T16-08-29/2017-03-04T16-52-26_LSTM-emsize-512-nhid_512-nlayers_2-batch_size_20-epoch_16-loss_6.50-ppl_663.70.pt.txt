To See If In The Place 

 it's my father's hair Wig 
 
 The city places in the window smoke 
 warming silent clouds through the soft ice, 
 the familiar bodies of thirst, 
 or with brain random over the stand, 
 everything of being to love or death 
 or speed and shape might attend on the rivers 
 as though by merits, spell had nowhere and 
 resolution, themselves where there had been 
 the absence of any small story.
