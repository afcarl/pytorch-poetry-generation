Out Of The Acreage 

 (for even the hero, the Lord I did was this: 
 Or made me hope--of springtide clean. 
 
 "You are a test. You don't listen to 
 Take up your phone for our own tunes, 
 To buy you some shoes? Stop out no more, 
 Bedlam's have only more! "and when 
 You were a buck must find or right too far 
 To fill the various angel of the moon, 
 And out of nothing bloodysweet 
 But drinking shutters.
