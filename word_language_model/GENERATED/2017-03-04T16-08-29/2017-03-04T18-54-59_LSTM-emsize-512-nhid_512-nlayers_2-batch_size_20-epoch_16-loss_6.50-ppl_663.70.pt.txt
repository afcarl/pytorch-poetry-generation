 
 The smell of violets through your throat. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 For Love 
 
 
 Oh, do not dare to go? 
 
 XVI 
 As though when men were free. 
 
 After the silent: said nothing more than many, 
 No softer than a Cincinnati. 
 Why does he rest if so, 
 Give us off those million o' a coin 
 I don't care no more. 
 You are placed in the gravest of Chinese 
 Angel: suburban oceans
