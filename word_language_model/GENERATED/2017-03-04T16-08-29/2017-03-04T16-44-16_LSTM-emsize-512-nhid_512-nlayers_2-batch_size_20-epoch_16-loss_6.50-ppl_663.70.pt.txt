It Would Be 

 God marks out of pure sunshine 
 Though she lives ready in eight, here 
 And by all descends very familiar 
 It yearns to be made inside it 
 A pretty space for my family naf. 
 Not while you talk of the steam that drives you awhile 
 Like a exposed fright inside a book 
 That moves certain star fresh as childhood 
 Beyond the low newspaper's 
 Winds cover your side. This is the nighttime 
 B-52's at resting in
