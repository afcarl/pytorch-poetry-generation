Ears How Confetti 

 There the peace of blessings in the heart can ply 
 O beauty and hate and kisses for pleasure, 
 Even whose warm will splendid and wild 
 I'll be alive and my heart's loves past, 
 Do not look to me from afar 
 Witness it before I set and fish, 
 You serve the squirell. 
 
 O the soul, vain natures? 
 Leaving your prayers, and all are gone. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Mutability Then back!
