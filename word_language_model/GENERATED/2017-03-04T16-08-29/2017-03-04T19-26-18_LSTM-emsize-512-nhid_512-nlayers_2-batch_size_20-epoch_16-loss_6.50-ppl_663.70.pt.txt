Lady, 

 Are not my love, my feeble childhood years, 
 Nor any youth in me? Day is then I come. 
 
 Well is the fantasy, it refines! at the ends 
 That here calls boy/man seeing the ground itself 
 Have been thrown quickly, till they are perversion, 
 Sunk after life or not having in them, 
 And the form of Bub: 1946), and rears 
 Their painful bones to climb down; 
 Into the hollow ghostly crescent 
 Of tempest shouting the breadfruit barks
