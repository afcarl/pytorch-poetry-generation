Why. 

 
 To parks with their latter daughters, 
 Some planted in an animate row 
 tendre fishermen 
 Where God has set all his heart is to discover, 
 Now his monks are in half places Naming 
 A feature they brought still back to the sea. 
 I may swap the fashion for which he sings, 
 Coupled in the newscast's eyebrow 
 Arrives like a rabbit cast off death-lament. 
 The scum of such snows at your short toll muster 
 ebbe, suspended out
