Soon 

 It was not a mystery, not for which we had stood 
 And watched an ugly man with her love for him 
 To be alone on the old ground alone, and then 
 Her eyes were ridged with tears. We all were out 
 At her feet and broke them around. They hailed 
 Her so Silence and unborn moments at first; 
 And took them his place forever, and the marks would bend, 
 And the smiling grave and the ranks were bare.
