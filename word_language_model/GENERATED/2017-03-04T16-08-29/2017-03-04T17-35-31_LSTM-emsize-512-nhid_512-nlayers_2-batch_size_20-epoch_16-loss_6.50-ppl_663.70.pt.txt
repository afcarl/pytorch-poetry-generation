Soft, 

 Down the fly, the beautiful glade fell; 
 
 But through old days the pilots of old men, 
 And feathered transparent roots await even the culture of Life, 
 The cruel and the far-off woes are things that it's to be kind, 
 And the pale slant aside inward and hungry of the night, 
 The tops that the fume of the lovers, the last, 
 The cow, The ringed foaming as peace! 
 
 How idle they came to scour out a wall,
