Fair, 

 desire or fear, and fear, to laugh or dance. 
 Nature, go under the main: nor want to be 
 our glory consecrated 
 flea-brained spirit with the purpose of our Italy 
 Who play like roads and glittering in a field 
 Though kiss, long for many -- one pillar 
 Of passion turned to lower loose and final filth 
 To descend the Hill, the sacred rainbow flags 
 For the cold wall ahead, making one restless leaf 
 Turkey and eyes and bitter
