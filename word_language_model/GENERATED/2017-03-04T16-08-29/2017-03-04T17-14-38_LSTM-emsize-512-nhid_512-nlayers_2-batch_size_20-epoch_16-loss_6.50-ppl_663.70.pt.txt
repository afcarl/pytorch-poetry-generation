Me Now, 

 as if this were an fetters Milwaukee, 
 and he was made vast by the cloud. 
 Small friends, of living soldiers in corners 
 of their own long fate 
 now hold them so hard and dead. 
 The burden of people what spirit 
 draws to the land of monks must enter, 
 and the push'd, and latest breath, were missing 
 for their daily ends, such years as old 
 Gamen in slow silence, 
 the fields of cliffs and cattle
