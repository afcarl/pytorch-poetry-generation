 
 Wind (who the great Hours, hopes; blow, Moloch, Queen, 
 
 Spirit of the gin at one chopsticks. 
 
 And a parcel of a woman whose bank was equal 
 
 For her lips and fingers, 
 
 nuque, with masks and Patting 
 
 What the methods of war 
 
 May the power of their breathless adolescent faces, 
 
 Clear their idle lips or legs to her hands 
 
 Half they descend in alley grey and broad, 
 
 
 --anyway--jesus
