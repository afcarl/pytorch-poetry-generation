They Loved Me To Know, Tap, Was Still Children. 

 The wonderful songs that the Daemon have finished the summer 
 World with pavement: in their zinc cold moon, and bespake, 
 I confess I would have told you. I would mount around my head, 
 And offer them wind enough the same ways and rules and stink. 
 O dearest lass, and deliver you down; lean me up with the gold of day and night, 
 Every night, even the rest is cards, and the past heroes.
