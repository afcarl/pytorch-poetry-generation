Shook The Path. 

 
 "I hardly stir, Didn't exchange my pecker 
 for it for the next place, Dido's headfirst, 
 a leg of immaculate strips at my chest. 
 Nobody can remember whether 
 the smell of birds 105 whiter 
 than pay-dirt else, say shame; 
 The wife of the sky, 
 the major Duchess painted on the Hudson, 
 had cut it for my mother. Mother 
 carried the platoon by the orange 
 that dropped red, silver 
 and box on the ground
