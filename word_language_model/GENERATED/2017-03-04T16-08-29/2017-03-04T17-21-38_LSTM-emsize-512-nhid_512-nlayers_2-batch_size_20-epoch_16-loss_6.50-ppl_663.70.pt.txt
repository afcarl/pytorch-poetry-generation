Brows-- Scrambles To Stay. 

 He Wears at four wings and panting tetchy 
 And soon they smile, in his garden hands 
 Of strangers near length of Myrtle; 
 
 A thousand eloquence by the palace shed 
 And scatters a leprous smile for stroke, 
 And here they change and destroy again. 
 Some separate rugs unsay, beneath. 
 
 Over a hapless midnight bogged. 
 Along the flooring and slowly clotted 
 Received the high sheet of grain, 
 To move for the loose dust
