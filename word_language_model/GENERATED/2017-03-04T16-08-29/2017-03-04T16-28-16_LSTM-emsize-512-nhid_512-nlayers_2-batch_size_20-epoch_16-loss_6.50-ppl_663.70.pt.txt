 Up the street with whips and evening. 
 And when below. It smiled at an hour of dreams 
 
 This passion fell from the body -- 
 And am not song's millennium 
 And there is a secret clearer in the river 
 And trees from pages, 
 And I'll drop, if I could not. 
 Amun romantic eyes; 
 capricorns and laid away revamped 
 Above its dim stream; 
 
 And then the soldier and the bed 
 moon-blanch'd wept in his kayak,
