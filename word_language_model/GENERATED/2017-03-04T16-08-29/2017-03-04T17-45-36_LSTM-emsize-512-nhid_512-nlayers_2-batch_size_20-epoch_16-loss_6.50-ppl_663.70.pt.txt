 Turchestan-born; for ever the Captain! 
 Only the night's will, and drained 
 As this: and now held in your ofspring, sweet, 
 To endure the flesh with colour, gloved heart 
 And rare effects of many enchantment; 
 Love first dreams a soul of one new dreams, 
 And not as any thing on you or me.

 Your mother sits alone in the dusk hatbrim 
 Sister Helen, O bao! Headlong 
 Prithee what would you be back-up, 
 But think
