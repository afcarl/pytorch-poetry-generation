 
 every time at which the vessel passes 
 
 into the lower yard, the ache of creation 
 
 lit up as someone else. And as I 
 
 myself leaned on under it, 
 
 although I came to the womb, & waited for a 
 Village unexampl'd to leave internally & Falanga 
 
 told them the whole scene such as spent 
 
 all the times they wheeled 
 
 and slit my drink soiled as secret, roamed 
 
 in clogged stream
