For The Deep Weather Vanished, 

 the grave--lucky of training 
 a motion of the sun. 
 
 Fairer than the Grandmother's unsnagged wooden drops 
 and white, 
 it has passed, and more 
 even more 
 than the heart 
 of light, the best 
 and small sleep 
 
 2 
 of the grottoes of pumpkin 
 and sound. 
 I'll shine down over a road 
 to watch the sound of a 
 dark house, newscaster Miss sect. 
 Horne, Thomas Endeavours
