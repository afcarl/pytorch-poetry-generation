Hanger Below. 

 avenue, still, move in the kitchen, 
 how won the people coast and bawl 
 Thomas and a thumb 
 If down the body girdle it crouch 
 And you wonder by one 
 
 wile. amid whose eye 
 We read in autumn Angeles from a vacant hour, 
 Most will appear to breadth and sleep. 
 Our natures, Sass at the heart 
 Of Sion's beauty and off-rhyme 
 A sinister form, learning to feel, 
 Of indented in the golden
