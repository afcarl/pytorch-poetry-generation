Quite Quaick," 

 Hellenic about themselves. 
 It is too late to rise in sorrow--sorrow 
 As the silence passes 
 That swells the sea to the fall; 
 How shall I know the means. 
 
 And though it is hard I know 
 That David's lot is all to die 
 I am an open if you knew it, 
 As once you were in a knife-sharp Jogs. 
 Was it awkward or why I save, 
 As if my songs would not look Tow'rd
