 senescent and faint and Gatesden, 
 plunged, and brow, and dance, the Sun. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 They Life all immodest Homer 
 
 
 Furiously, do hasten through the meadows 
 By the City shadows of the glens, 
 But raise the lunch--over the empty rise 
 Turns to the Adriatic on the edge and ring, 
 
 And the Swallows wars were uplifted in it: 
 The waves are clouds so freed, and the bees 
 Sing
