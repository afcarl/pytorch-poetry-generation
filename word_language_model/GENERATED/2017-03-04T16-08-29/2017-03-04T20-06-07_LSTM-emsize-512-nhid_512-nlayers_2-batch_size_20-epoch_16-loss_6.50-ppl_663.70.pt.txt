 
 Art to kiss me by touching me 
 The humble President? 
 
 I had no form, all the good crowd extinction: 
 And even so trembled from the wharves 
 In heroic days in summer square 
 I seemed to sleeplessness. and then had a great Morn; 
 Yet as his tongue had a dub shout 
 Upon the ruined velvet chambers of the world 
 -- till the twine of it were they not fled, 
 Unless aught saw the other lay the same,
