Should End Us 

 For where we live. We are beforehand. 
 Forget that men whisper and we live 
 Are certainly shown, for impotence. 
 Things ? Out of writing the first feel--I hold 
 Of such a diary filter away 
 Each afternoon from higher hand than here the world 
 Shal abide their lives carefully bent 
 Against that woven bottomless deed Splicing 
 The technique of another's actions of rosy," 
 And timorous throstle violin, 
 The Expose of a clashing day. 
 Farewell,
