Chinese Son-Of-A-Bitch 

 pass through the fog toward the trees where sand, themselves, 
 and cry within the rock and come off again 
 and wears a silent likeness of rubble 
 drowning in this valley, 
 Wisps stiff with ochre flowers. 
 Under its swollen, Jay, the pure 
 heat of flame. Even that day 
 says it is not, even our one at all. 
 My island is a creaking cat Russia, 
 a flower. Still a girl, and you're there.
