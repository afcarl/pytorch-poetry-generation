Brought Them Home, 

 kiddies up like a calf which hath told you 
 
 I passed my way from where you went 
 
 you've cried the Mile-wide broke back, padpad. School, 
 Says cogs about how you have no way or now, 
 And your whole address is a strange dream upon that general glance 
 That to tell why the stories you cannot go. 
 
 Here in the fairies of Men and women there ten-ton 
 sexes. Children stop, nor even your own use
