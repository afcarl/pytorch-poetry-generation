 Some others' conceit, one greets two years: 
 What matters first, literature to like- 
 affaires of critics with all their powers 
 And they who fear to come is a word, 
 And that the march of something may issue 
 Seemed here in Appian life may make no power. 
 
 Dear scholarly pride: 
 
 Underneath kick-ass hands, that touches them, 
 Who, into wet hair; or hay, or Books. 
 He is yelling to dreames, 
 And Reason looks his black-eyed exile
