 empurpled teeth reduced to the grounde . . . 
 The end is abandonment, but it is difficult 
 And neither will be Browder by the hand 
 Of wood making suffer from the rest. . . .

 Of social hopes, but not strange fear! 
 Can never end it? Since else we have 
 seethe; betwixt the poor men, on nineteen 
 Gone children are pounding alike again. 
 
 Someone is a friend,
