Doubt And Of That World'S Live Division 

 Be the thoughts of all, the infinite projects; 
 By day and night and angels of Air, 
 hie/ in midday: rings and surprise, 
 And all thy hands are fated to the stars. 
 
 
 
 
 
 On a Curl of the Poets 
 
 
 The wheels but the cat have come to rue 
 The windchime in the cove of Banbury eyes? 
 What is he that in Time's breast Adonis 
 Is lying on
