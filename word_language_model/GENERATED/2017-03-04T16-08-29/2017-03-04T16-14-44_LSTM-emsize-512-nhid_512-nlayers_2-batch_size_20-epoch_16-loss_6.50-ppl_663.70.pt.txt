Holy--Thus 

 
 Love never walks for much more moving. 
 The face is inspiring. and wine.' shaken, 
 spills together, dripping from the brim, the bank 
 gorse-bush into the surf, the color of living laughter, 
 And the celebrations Bear white, the Feeling the city: the Palatine! 
 All are the suns that are among them. 
 It seems far out, small labor by the fields, they crawl 
 Between the flowers and statues fell from and blowing truck 
 Up ... The catch and Kennedy.
