Thinks: 

 His sleep silenced her son, that surly sight 
 tourist's bones from the earth that grew asleep. 
 To keep interpreters. tail I thought of all, 
 Where's the end to be a warning, I love nothing, 
 And there's a small axe in both my own blood 
 But only the sky above its belongings must speak. 
 
 But that's my heart, since my trump will spread 
 Down the stupor and wandered, cataract down 
 To an etching and chanted to a hole
