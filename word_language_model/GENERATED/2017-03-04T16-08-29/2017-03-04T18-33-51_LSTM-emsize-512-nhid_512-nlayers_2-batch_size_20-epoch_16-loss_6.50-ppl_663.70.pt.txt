Gone. 

 It is like that of the simple past, Vermeer, 
 or a man in the Apollo, and balks miscarried, 
 I have seen strong local rag Hydrogen 
 and bled from a parchment chair to watch me die. 
 
 With a lone fresh hairs last breeze of ice 
 and cold in the ochre heat, the fresh sun. 
 I have seen a way to rise. 
 I can feel the delicate escape 
 of the orchestra Defac't, when I spend 
 in my back
