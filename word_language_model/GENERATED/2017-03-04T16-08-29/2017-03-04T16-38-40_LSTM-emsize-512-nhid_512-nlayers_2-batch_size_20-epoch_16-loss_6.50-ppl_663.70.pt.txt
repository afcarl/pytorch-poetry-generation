The Giant Poet Too 

 spills through the fingernails & dust from the cradle 
 
 We panted, among rackkle -- 
 they were solid . . . At the kitchen bones clouds bless us. 
 
 We have parked for charity 
 to lung-colored as shrouds of the rain; 
 we could see the birds. 
 
 We even fear our lives. 
 
 You promised for me 
 and I was rewarded with death. 
 I was still sure especially an price.
