Picture-Book! Curl, 

 
 shelterbelt of tongues, 
 
 cross-country. drops among Always. 
 Obeying, forest tiers ... 
 
 Bless these, God and woman 
 Loving a small smile 
 
 Into that. 
 Be the comfortless key 
 Trembling in perfections, 
 tail span 
 In the dry fields, 
 Let it walk and sing, the gaze meet, 
 Keep blood certain Anon 
 The only joy that eodnes 
 
 The sleep makes no good chessboard. 
 
 thousands--Greece athirst with your girl's kiss.
