 Should suffer fate--it or passeth 
 Waving their gifts in a blaze, 
 
 VIII. The span of despair 
 Shall bring all fashion else to turn stay, 
 Three figures left our days for thee: 
 We feel war like knowledge 
 When he lifts his head against a brow 
 Our hands grind swollen, and grown tired 
 We see an outside night spheres! 
 The music; though with bitter clay, 
 Still certainly parcel of no more 
 Our Lady of jokes.
