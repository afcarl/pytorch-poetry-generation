All What We Mean, 

 where we were to us, are schemes to age. 
 
 Being light of country. 
 the streets are screaming hard, 
 in the ninth breaking from the scorpions. 
 There are so small open moments in these together, 
 makes reason for ourselves where 
 they can be found seats and a blow like the rose, and flies 
 off apple-blossoms, 
 
 Thousands are covered with homes 
 and drift in the womb, 
 then disappears. religions 
 
 ask blizzards,
