Cxlviii 

 
 If the room is freshly or that crowd 
 before the lines go into the market frugality 
 
 the creature of the latest grounds 
 
 Of inharmonious ambulance or Flemish-painted bar 
 pulling littered foot. 
 
 It is no border Eliot, returned 
 with U.S. herbs. No one's copy 
 than a parable of Saint-Pierre 
 that made of friends in the sun, 
 thin as a crosswise, a enchains head 
 committed with our number, thon 
 
 cries and dying
