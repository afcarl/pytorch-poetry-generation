 Had it been born for pretty wine. 
 
 When I woke with them, I spoke them free, 
 And I crown with their flying fingers increase, 
 Where I lie fetch them in the rivers. 
 
 But at last they bear a pas 
 And Leisure, to lead liking proofs, 
 Or revolutions like Descending on afar 
 After to such a vision. 
 
 oh, what art thou beautiful art, 
 How Then my grief, with bleeding hand 
 Is answer leave fierceness still
