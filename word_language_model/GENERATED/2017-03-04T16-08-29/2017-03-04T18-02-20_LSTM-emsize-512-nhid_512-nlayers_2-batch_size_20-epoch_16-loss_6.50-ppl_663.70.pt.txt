To Watch The Lil'S Blow 

 War up and sing the night. 
 
 In the uncertain light of trees. 
 Even now, does it still shine again! 
 God is entirely stands, 
 The young climbing yellow feet where people 
 cartilage up and again, when 
 Eastward long, even exquisite. 
 Sweet is under the open edge 
 Of the secular desert wall 
 Of quickening rooms and leaves 
 And acrid malls to the skies-- 
 I should increase it seems, 
 And in swarm.
