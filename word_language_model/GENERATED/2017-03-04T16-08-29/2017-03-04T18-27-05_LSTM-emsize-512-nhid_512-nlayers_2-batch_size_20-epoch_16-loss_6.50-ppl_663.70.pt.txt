Into Life, 

 and am under an ancient two-and-a-half 
 I put a feather to the horse's head 
 
 on the Look--the died together, 
 riverman took the white side of the waist, 
 who drove off the chalk beside me, 
 arms wrapped in their eyes like I 
 had with a outlet, but a puddle 
 of leftover light, and praying in the air. 
 And then a couple were full battles since 
 Kissd dissolves, over the hair, my cheekbones 
 as they worry
