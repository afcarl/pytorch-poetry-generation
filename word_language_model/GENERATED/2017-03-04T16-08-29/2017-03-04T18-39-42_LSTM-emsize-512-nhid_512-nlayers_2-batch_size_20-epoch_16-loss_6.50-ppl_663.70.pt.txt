And Life Calibrations-- 

 
 We were the crank-and-cable whet our newspapers. 
 
 Take up, my knife, my honour, leaning hair, 
 
 'I have willed ! ' by whom I wept, 
 
 I remember my name I could not weigh 
 
 Its hurry in the morning door. 
 
 
 V. 
 
 This is the house that I can find, 
 
 For I must bomb as corners of snow; 
 
 entertainment of the colours, 
 
 To straighten in unplucked
