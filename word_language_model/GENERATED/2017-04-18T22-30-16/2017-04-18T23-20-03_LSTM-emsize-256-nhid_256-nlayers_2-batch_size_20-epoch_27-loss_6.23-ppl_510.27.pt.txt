America'S Name? 

 What is he 
 That has become a man who believes 
 These wonders would confess 
 none better gaze; but time fountains; 
 The meaning is the merciful preacher Congressional forty-one question. 
 Sounds of the body's beauty eat 
 Is . . ." 
 Jove that looks like a fat straight passion there is no 
 head? 
 Slipped from the silence that goes as beneath the brooks, and reeds, 
 And you touch all the whole dark bells.
