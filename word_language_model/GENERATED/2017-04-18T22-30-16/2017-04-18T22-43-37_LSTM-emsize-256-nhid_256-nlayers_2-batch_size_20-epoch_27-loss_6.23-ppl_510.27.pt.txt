It. 

 
 Until it seems to go 
 Home in beat, 
 Perhaps, in every place 
 I'm 
 born gone. I pull back 
 St.-Jeannet, my discarding 
 the silence of Byzantium 
 and hard time before, to step across bronze-rimmed 
 tenor's lucky passages for Ted 
 humped and disjointed 
 at Willie; 
 chaste. 
 
 Pray for their sin 
 to be as heavy as a clearest walk. 
 Or you see, the approach of the dead, 
 
 hearing my voice understands
