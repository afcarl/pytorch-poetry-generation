Its Least Fear. 

 
 Noght for five loves, 
 elongated by wars and Anger 
 To for yourself, Harp got, 
 hammer only the brains of men, 
 That maimed chivalry's gales; 
 
 And yet, maybe no love so precisely she begins, 
 And such sight of a friable storm would know 
 
 There will be war, as fire for her father, 
 In that poor shroud. This is uxorious, 
 Deign with Fays, hearty heavenly seed a way 
 To make glad and turns
