Of Me 

 ('twas within the windows of the sea. 
 pleasures like meat dirt, 
 put out his shoulders, lightning listening drunk?--his 
 luminous, off it from anguish, rocks; 
 my sister like a woman, in a distance, 
 I still use all of them swim 
 before Reflected, and I come down before; 
 -- too wishing to tax the wind. 
 Off again in a music of hotel failure. 
 
 At the end I return, This is the night 
 it takes that north
