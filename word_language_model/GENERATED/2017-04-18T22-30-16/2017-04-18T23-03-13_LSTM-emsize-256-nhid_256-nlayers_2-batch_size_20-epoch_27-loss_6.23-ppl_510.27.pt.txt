Is Hard To See, 

 
 but hope that we have left 
 
 and on any continent or shall 
 feel it 
 As I feel 
 asserteth with Our 
 sail? uprears— 
 
 a metaphysical Father's 
 displacement for me) 
 Spoken an old man 
 waiting for checkbook; being 
 bigger than anyone 
 
 who cares for in you— 
 didn't walk on match! Margaret 
 
 We are giving anything, says 
 the borrowed chariot 
 holding son of family masks
