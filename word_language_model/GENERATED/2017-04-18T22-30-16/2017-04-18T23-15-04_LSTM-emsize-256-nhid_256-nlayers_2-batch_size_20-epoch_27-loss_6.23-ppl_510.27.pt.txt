 Which took so much for so much terror 
 Milkweed and eyes gone wheresoe'er they have 
 Ungod. and wholly "the counter that made shop for 
 Of news of fits, and doorknobs.

 Because no one in a feeble cloud 
 thank-you, with dreams of Bethlehem scaring breath 
 In shaving, but opposite the ex-wife 
 Of the young dully Teena 
 For your soul will always be
