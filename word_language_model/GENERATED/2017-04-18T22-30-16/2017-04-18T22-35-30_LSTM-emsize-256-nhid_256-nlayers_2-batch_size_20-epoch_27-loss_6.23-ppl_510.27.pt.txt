 The warty intoxication of the new manners, 
 The memory of five hundred souls 
 
 Some souse for name;-- which to the fluent place 
 Which silently more steep and desire 
 And a white cupboard. chamois faint 
 Still with an lamb-- 
 In the twice-- Siever 
 Loon, by the noisy signs 
 
 Of year greete? gate; 
 A nearby wave in the backseat 
 
 No unready tooth dropp'd not even gloom! 
 
 We sang and heard the purple roar
