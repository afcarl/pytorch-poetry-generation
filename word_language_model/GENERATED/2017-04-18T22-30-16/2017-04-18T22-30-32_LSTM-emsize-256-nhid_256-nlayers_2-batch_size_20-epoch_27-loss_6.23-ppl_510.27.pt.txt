 Says nothing, Wallace has its look 
 Slow outside the stones of the Wabash 
 So I'll be a foolish house all day, 
 When time, in sighs I am!

 To look on the next day 
 By significance: these inspiration are the same 
 I see there in the way 
 To the soul the world is swamp; 
 And all the years I sink, the moon 
 Is crowned,
