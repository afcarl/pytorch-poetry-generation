And Their Ravaged Breath 

 and no longer hidden land. 
 I used to read you in a crossword ball. 
 
 Praise lurching from town to mark of writing. 
 I hurt my mother 
 tossed me out of my left. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Native Disease 
 
 
 The right is simple and bloody and strong. 
 Singing that divide, the world in dimensions, the latest thing: 
 of the hourly. and seven blocks, and the which we are most young without man.
