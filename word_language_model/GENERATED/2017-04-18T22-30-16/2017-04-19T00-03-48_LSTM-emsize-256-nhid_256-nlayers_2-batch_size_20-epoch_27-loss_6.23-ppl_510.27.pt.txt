Howling 

 By the other sleeping world, 
 They are all waiting for 
 One hundred hand in the yard, 
 Behind the floors, 
 Hot scents and slay; 
 Victim after sleep kinsman will capt'n, 
 Encamp their Cola 
 In a green T-shirt with tenth-of-an-inch bright 
 Tinkled in these Bible. 
 
 This is a long failure, grazing and 
 Spreads away the video form, 
 It goes across the rising water, unfeard 
 by the wish we would be.
