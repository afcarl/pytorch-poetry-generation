And Their Prey. 

 
 They dazzled and with with his son, 
 
 Their long thin race, her leaping eyesâ€” 
 
 When air was awake, my love, there hid no peace, 
 
 Whence, on her locker where our curious, would bind, 
 
 How often in the blest due reach leads 
 To know your sharp in knowledge and a taste 
 Who, lying there, till these white nights are served. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Man of his Dirge
