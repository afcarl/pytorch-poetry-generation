Gust-Fists, Lost. 

 It was not the sin to fall back 
 hoping a French Heart. 
 
 But sometimes the fire sent concerned. 
 But if you can love again 
 what must have been 
 why the hope may count. 
 Even the other did know in the word 
 we know only getting the home of words. 
 Some guy 
 will come home and come up for that. 
 
 Night had been back, that 
 the maniac two stones live up 
 taking
