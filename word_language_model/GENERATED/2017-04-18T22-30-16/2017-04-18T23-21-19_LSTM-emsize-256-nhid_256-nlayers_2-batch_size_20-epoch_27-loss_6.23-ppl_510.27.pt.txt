 The blurred bark: 
 And all are the arms of the visible. 
 Yet do you not hear, it's not yet, 
 Than regarding gladness 
 In the face of memory. 
 
 If you warn me for, and did a taint 
 That you may want but will to divide, 
 But song also the clash 
 And you hearing your martial rhyme. 
 
 Now I will depart. 
 Do you know so, 
 Face you at last! 
 
 A long spell you'll hear
