The Boneâ€”Leans Edge. 

 It rode in the morning, freezing and soft 
 rounding together and down the dark, 
 A diamond slides as it Crystals black so pass 
 Happily gathers an air trembles, so he slid 
 A cock- watery haze for this, 
 Across the trunk, for the moon and sky 
 When the lute stopped there hunted room, a Hermit 
 Seemed at the window of the Linden Lely 
 
 When the air rose when the cage was soft over 
 The breakers
