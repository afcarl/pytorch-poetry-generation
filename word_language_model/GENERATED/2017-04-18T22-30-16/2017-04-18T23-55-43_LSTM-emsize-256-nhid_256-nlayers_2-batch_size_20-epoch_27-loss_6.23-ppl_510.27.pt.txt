 I kneel in eyes tall, 
 and set it melting through the light of you 
 and sliced in, the open arms of thighs. 
 Nothing was you at all that time 
 you thought that you were looking for what might I make, the dog 
 in my watery ignored, and suddenly our grief. 
 In the land you look on the coach, listening to beach lattice; 
 
 At five forwards, is gone, 
 you tell the TV. I know, what I meant to do
