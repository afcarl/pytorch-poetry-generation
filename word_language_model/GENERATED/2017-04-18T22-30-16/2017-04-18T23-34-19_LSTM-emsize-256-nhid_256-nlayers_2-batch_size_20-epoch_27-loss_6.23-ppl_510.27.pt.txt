Thoughts Never Laid Fierce Hands, 

 And hopes, and nothing both, but only see, 
 Not the voice of London or the flames, 
 Two straying sprouting in from a claw, 
 Great mocking baubles, served them all. 
 
 In our love, that when they spend the Mediterranean, 
 Flossing before their safe bones resemble 
 Ready to be found in prudence to 
 Where they honoured in a blind language. 
 
 They cry too early equal to save 
 Whether linksto where are useless paths
