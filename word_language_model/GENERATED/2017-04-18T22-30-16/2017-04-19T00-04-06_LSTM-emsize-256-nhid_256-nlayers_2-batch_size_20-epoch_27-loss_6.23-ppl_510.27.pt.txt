To Sail, 

 With flowers. In the alcove, 
 With too much art. 
 
 Oh, cold, deep fire on the gloomy line; 
 Petrarch. inexhaustible morn: waters flow 
 Monarchs boil through all our blazing corn. 
 
 Rejoice we stay asleep. 
 
 Are we the fuel you see: 
 Dreamlike, 
 When you have been dead, 
 breathe like a secret, two forlorn: 
 I'd like to feel another game, 
 Swylc/ lordliest, Dies 
 Wen binds his face in the scale 
 Hoover.
