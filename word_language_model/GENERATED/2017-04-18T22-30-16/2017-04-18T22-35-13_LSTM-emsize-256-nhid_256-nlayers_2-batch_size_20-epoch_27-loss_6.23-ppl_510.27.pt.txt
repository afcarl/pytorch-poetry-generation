Pleased One After Another, Away. 

 
 I like to watch it waiting like the stars 
 their skulls behind the holes under my neck, 
 the freshly accountant daughter, the blister extreme, 
 the leaping streaming sounds. 
 
 This is the world I am like 
 To be here, lynchers languor, minted 
 static. What there is 
 Jew in the first conversation because he 
 has a great presence to empty..., 
 Next day a agent died out. Come all 
 to the wind, salt
