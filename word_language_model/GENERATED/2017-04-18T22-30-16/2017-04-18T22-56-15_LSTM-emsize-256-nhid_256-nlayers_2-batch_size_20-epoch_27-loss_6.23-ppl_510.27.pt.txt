To The Moon 

 The clouds pale harmed. enough 
 into the shadow! Even ahead of the Ivy astonished 
 
 for the water we left, as if now under the wide streets 
 we stands, fern: there 
 is someone in the adult world in crystal air, 
 as a nun thrown from a sign 
 a fist inch out of broken fire to summ'd 
 monthly music from the sluggish lungs, festering 
 as tirelessly, graceful; 
 digest. beat, its edges of the flesh 
 runs
