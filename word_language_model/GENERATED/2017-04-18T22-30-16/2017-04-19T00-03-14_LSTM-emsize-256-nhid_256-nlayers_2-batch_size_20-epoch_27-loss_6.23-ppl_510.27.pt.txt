It Is Snowing In The Deep Photograph 

 here? The almond-tree, is lit. 
 Each in this direction is hotter and sure, 
 Late as this ending for moon. 
 Then fog, I clean the hand 
 Of some new aunt flying 
 Out of the wind brightness; 
 I was gold, but I know to myself 
 To embrace one's wild mask as the bulbs 
 Or stem of the voice of a girlfriend's 
 Return before me and he is alone.
