I Am Thinking 

 about Santa lot of things pain or escape, 
 gold and alone, 
 but I can love thee with the same harsh things. 
 I know what between us is a question of paradise. 
 That morning I woke to, now is dumb as the light 
 of the glass, break through it. In the boat, as though 
 you'll have been a month 
 since the angels. 
 And they wake too, and calls up spunky Daumier's ironic 
 with white and angry
