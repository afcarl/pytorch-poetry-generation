We Know What To Say Is Yet That Only 

 What to have been, never been lost in all: 
 
 This is what there is that sadder report 
 Than the mind, and the fleeting star; 
 and the Bellman, can survive, however soon 
 
 too equal to touch their minds, 
 
 this mystery of summer's scars. 
 All the authority, up here 
 Is nothing Mizzentop, 
 
 Beyond the years of time 
 I must tell you better, hast we been? 
 So
