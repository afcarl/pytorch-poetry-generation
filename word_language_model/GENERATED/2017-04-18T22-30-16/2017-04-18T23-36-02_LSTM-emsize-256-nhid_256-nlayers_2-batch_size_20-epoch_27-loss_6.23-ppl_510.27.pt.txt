 A walk behind the house of cars 
 concave- against king that on our bus 
 Not, and so deep like existence 
 The Bore!' or the seed Paradigm itself 
 spirts of featherweight belly and dance-floor 
 EGBDF: 
 To a body Mdard. mixt with oil, 
 Proust, solid sifts toward the credulous 
 Man's Garner name, a lunar cake would identify 
 the Bread of matter: 
 Theirs to there is over as they should rise.
