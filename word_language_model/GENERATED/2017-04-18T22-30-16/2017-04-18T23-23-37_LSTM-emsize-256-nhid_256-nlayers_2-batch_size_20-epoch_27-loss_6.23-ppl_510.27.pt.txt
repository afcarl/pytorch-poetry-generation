They Have Been, 

 They lie upon the blast. 
 
 And that sings which these fading days 
 Could come to despise the trade, 
 For we've existed, dance on extension. 
 
 steepest years that have done their awe 
 And besides that's A. tormented wise, 
 When all things are spent in love before. 
 
 Love bears not for the few men's barks of language dying, 
 Yet all was dried; our guide, they dreamed, 
 Men's earth, whatever the sick life becomes
