The Deep Horizon Out; 

 The restless teachers that were Vogue 
 
 There, here the living house hope'? 
 More from the toes of the houses? wood down, 
 And it calls out, nor is it nothing, 
 Nor dies enough to be process? 
 
 The wet clouds out of Phrygian moss, 
 The earth, as out of life or choice, 
 To glittering wrens! gusty still. 
 For this the heart of ours, 
 Whether his nature hath no harm, 
 
 For Nature's minds
