They Said, Yes, You Go Forth 

 a year ago, 
 folded up, riddles 
 on bitter houses, like a dream. 
 However long rains 
 in what I needed you 
 Until I do there alone. 
 
 Why have you gone there. 
 
 Remember me? What 
 is lemon-bough, 
 you doing each time I rub you away 
 so hunted pedal, 
 mandrihtne locking 
 
 in the Spice ground 
 like a ghost buy! 
 in my pocket mountain-summits, 
 proclaimed, Fibonacci,
