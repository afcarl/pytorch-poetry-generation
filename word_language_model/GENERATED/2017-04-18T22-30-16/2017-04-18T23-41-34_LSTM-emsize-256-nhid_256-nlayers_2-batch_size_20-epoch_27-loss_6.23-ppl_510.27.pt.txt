A Lantern 

 Up across a sunless Atlantic. 
 Light gliding forward through stars. 
 Why do we load our heads, 
 What shall we ask it how we be, 
 But you gave up and have wept 
 When you pick me down; 
 To see where I console to the earth, 
 
 Thick red tips. It seems 
 To cure you at night, your veil is black. 
 But even the Future, feed me 
 Old wooden cloths 
 My neat palms deal around six
