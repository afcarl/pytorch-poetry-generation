Now Consum'D, 

 That thence may be of its Snark 
 With the force of that gigantic mind, thy sound draw mine 
 And its face isn't big-mouth power, not let the Light die, 
 And mark you again. Now doth I quite retire 
 A sleep of the stars where the splendour blows away 
 As the sea pulses down with us, horn, 
 It cannot sleep, perhaps, to be clearer in the flower; as it flies, 
 days,â€”'tis the sound of the soul is, children too,
