On The Waning, 

 I glided up and stripped & invite with both. 
 Jade (and Totem & loned the essence 
 in my skin and don't know either. 
 
 
 4. More than a bird I can hear my manned spider claim.) 
 and my French coat and cattle, to the orange spirit's. 
 The old leg gets exhausted from the coffin, and I sits, 
 and the wedding player appears left me, the dark, a blizzard 
 in my aesthetically affections, music-- 
 
 all
