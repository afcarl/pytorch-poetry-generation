 The song that is more than a child 
 I shape the foot this pack you move 
 
 It will be full again you like to know 
 What cheers you & there 
 
 We fall 
 Another morning 
 The rain fell down in a sapphire 
 
 Of the grey Heuch bearing rising, 
 
 shalt, for an intensity in ourselves, 
 There are things in its eye 
 
 Wakes our threads 
 Away above summer 
 In a sunny car
