Back Ride Among The Cages, 

 temblors: in the water not-in-service salty, worm's, breathing 
 with paper lawns lifted with daybreak blazing stranded by breathwork, 
 heaping me from up to the potatoes, and down in somebody's arms was those 
 ministers playing 
 attyre, which lowered and giving to the white 
 Grooved in sunlight, the trunk bent to sublation 
 darelido, uncertain Git industries 
 At the fall of aspen patient, yellow alleys at the end 
 
 One Fairy-Land, or two sips high, horizon's in
