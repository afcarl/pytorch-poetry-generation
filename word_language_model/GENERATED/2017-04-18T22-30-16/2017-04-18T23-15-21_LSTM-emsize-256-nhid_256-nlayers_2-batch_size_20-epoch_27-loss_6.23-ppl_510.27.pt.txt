Lilies, 

 Save caves and beads of silk and tarts 
 To the poor damn shapes that shall twist their heads, 
 Weeping to nothing's caustics; a time to shut it 
 And again begin on that dish. For the priests live 
 With the dash of the Resurrection, 
 That lie stiff in the hay building 
 With quickened hooks where they tried to swing 
 Against the table appear sometimes 
 Their nails like small bodies. It can still be 
 Self-love, and now the lines
