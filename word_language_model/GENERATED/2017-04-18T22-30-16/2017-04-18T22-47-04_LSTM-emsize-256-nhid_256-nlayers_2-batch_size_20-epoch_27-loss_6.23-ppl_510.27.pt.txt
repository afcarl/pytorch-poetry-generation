 I am a rope in the Moore. 
 Storm is the pity! squeezed up it. 
 Below, the van goggles I sing-along. 
 I watch you in the mud, 
 Trying to stare at the grasses. 
 Thus I watched the swallows, on night. 
 
 Is Evangeline's loud hair stairs on your dresser 
 And the fields do send me in. 
 
 At the huts of the river! 
 There stroller, so worn, 
 I said to the word which has failed this way,
