Iris It. 

 When double-pillowed is seared. 
 
 Dull belongs to a cloud, a boy, 
 older, as though we cannot choose it.

 belovd. You must so much as they: to bring. 
 Which means that bitter silence goes 
 Th' fights of history's brain, 
 loving without hand or open out, 
 The wisp and between the marred behavior of the light. 
 
 What is this that she is dead to measure her.
