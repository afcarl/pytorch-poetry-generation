The Small Man Carlos: 

 "United creatures cry, wine-dark, 
 Let them go upon impersonates, brink; 
 I pray to think that silence will burrow 
 Till a Smile kind of shore-trees, there is 
 Where surfaces have settled the strangeness 
 That is, morning, a sunny party pays 
 This baby of mock-suns, -- he moaned the man 
 Who thinks that so, with these words 
 Of the fourth world, learning not to hear him. 
 For the ruining drawn, is the color of earth.
