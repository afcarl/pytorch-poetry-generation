Land. 

 Proud and bread and wounds. What though this 
 Good thing for nothing is there. They have strange 
 
 Only to do but die now, they seem 
 To leave the cure but can't remain 
 If most things can't want to feel our Tonkawa 
 Else would we look like the mare behind us, 
 Lest dreamily ceilings. We watch your monument 
 
 Administrative Anything when the light 
 Gives us beast-teeming faster than the laugh: 
 Is overflowing with our passionate isle
