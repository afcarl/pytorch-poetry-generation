At The Wind'S Bars And Tucked-In 

 Men when I was embarrassed, whatever I found 
 They made me lean into citherns unlap 
 A coarser boy that would not be doing, fox; 
 I came all over as she old brothers 
 Tenants in Sons Horner paltry love, 
 And for earth I had carried for a past 
 
 Where is called off a bridge and a sheer field of lily 
 Words and mysterious towns and fights, and bullet-pocked 
 Doe the sound farce!
