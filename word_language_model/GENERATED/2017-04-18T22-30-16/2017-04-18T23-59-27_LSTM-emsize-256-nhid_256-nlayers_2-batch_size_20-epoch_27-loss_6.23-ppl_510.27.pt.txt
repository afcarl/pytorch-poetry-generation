 
 And woke in launch'd and fade about, 
 
 Scare bored, tracing their hands 
 
 On follow by. A Day 
 Enjoys the last. 
 Lost in a motor seconds. 
 A butcher Palestinian made light his finger 
 In an instant of youth; 
 review the ocean of the past. 
 What was it that makes the songs that made 
 Of the poor mother and the aim of resolution 
 All the vexed caverns hide the years, 
 We know happily we hear?
