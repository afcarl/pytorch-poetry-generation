Shall I Mean. 

 
 
 
 
 
 To the Hour 
 
 
 Under the hour of November Contributions 
 I wonder how to make it of suburban land, 
 and loaded with a flitting green, 
 and all the windows whence you were gold and so many lambs 
 at the edge of the Ear, 
 a rain rattling through the sand so lively 
 you can't taste the ache of pure cypress in mine 
 
 once from that source we grew far from
