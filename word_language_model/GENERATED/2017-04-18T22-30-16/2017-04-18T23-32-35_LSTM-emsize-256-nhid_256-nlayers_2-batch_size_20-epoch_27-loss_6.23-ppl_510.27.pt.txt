 
 I shall not deny my turn? 
 I'm afraid of ghosts fairseeming Tom, 
 each pierced with a daisy sure at hand, 
 
 all depends on the belfry-arch 
 of oxygen. War 
 with a silver leak 
 of perfect lambs, the smell of granite, 
 the dog with a traveled, 
 uplifting, and then I 
 can read it off this threadbare flower, 
 a brown girl like a hood and a pole turn up 
 let him sit saying that I am startled
