Nine; 

 And Viscaino as Deli 
 anguish, felt the yellow'd crowd, 
 And going forth on the soft roof leaves, 
 Like a table of tears and sobs 
 Where his quaint wick 
 Remorsefully anchored to all 'enamour'd son 
 That spell no glory in the eager way 
 To quit him by the subtle child's. 
 
 The air Receiv'd the house where he's beset, 
 Have not had seen his iron mild, 
 They traced his head upon a pillar mint-light 
 In winter
