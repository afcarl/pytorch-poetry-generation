 The little woman in grey waters 
 Are quivering as they tried to wear, 
 The sunshine light goes over, 
 His sole faltered is dressed with snow. 
 
 Autumn grasses it bloomed 
 After three in the keels; 
 All that time sea-floor. 
 Finally to suffer the bend. 
 On the cold spot with the little lights 
 That he lifts, redeem'd or by, 
 Bred room, as Sting; 
 The gold horse propped up, 
 He sees his long, 
 And shaped before
