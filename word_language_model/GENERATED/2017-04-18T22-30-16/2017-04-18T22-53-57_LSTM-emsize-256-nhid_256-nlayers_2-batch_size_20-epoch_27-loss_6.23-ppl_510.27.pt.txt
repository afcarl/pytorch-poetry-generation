 Between the feet of the seasons, 
 (rarely screams, plunging overhead, 
 crown of pale night. 
 
 "Zodiac plunge in moss 
 on a page, a color too got on water 
 
 crows drag a muzzle against 
 polished heaven; says 
 the one of traffic Fletcher. 
 
 Count's came to the fleeting, 
 two thousand children 
 in ribands, and watched the faces 
 in the field, of on hands 
 hung down to the ground and offered it 
 
 to ring
