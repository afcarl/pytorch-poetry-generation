 I keep of sight a moment like irate 
 And a vast feature, without veins! 
 
 
 I see you when you change, ever, 
 I am a little boy in hay today. 
 Years ago you ask to imagine the daycare 
 Little littered jaundice in the Honey cages, 
 Either, the weight of sentiment to which you were caught 
 So sad, It was the windy night of the sea. 
 
 So sweet is the place that peace has passed, 
 And all
