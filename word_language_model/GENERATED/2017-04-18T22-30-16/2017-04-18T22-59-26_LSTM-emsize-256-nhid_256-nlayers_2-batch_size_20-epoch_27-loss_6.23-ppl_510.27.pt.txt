 And is none, for I am, and not 
 Her crowning daughter's priest and me. 
 
 The fallen sunlight from a tidemark. 
 She's our caw," 
 Their breasts and saucers, drops, 
 dripping, crystals blow over shoulders, 
 And your mother and her oar 
 Is deserts one and the crimson 
 Of her on her shorn mat 
 And cannot produce on her dreaming Monday 
 And would almost grant her. 
 
 And she is like a nest in the sable bursal
