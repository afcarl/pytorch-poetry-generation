Should Not Be Of Thee! 

 
 But cease not till the glory down 
 A hidden urn with tears in prayer; 
 But leave a white peace nearer 
 To slip across my limbs a rock 
 But binds some smokes, sentry thrust 
 Down through the sand, water, turning, stick-figures 
 Of children like the moon doth vote, 
 In my mind's picture, and the timbrels sings; 
 And so I love a song of bygone desire? 
 And if I too, and worshipp'st at first
