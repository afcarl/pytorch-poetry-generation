Now 

 
 Missed I watched the marsh creatures—men. 
 When I arrived it would see myself 
 tomorrow, smoke open, needles and miles away from rock 
 that were not made of fairer art— 
 But golden, I've trailed at years and nothing happens. 
 The lines love once irrepressible; . . . . street? 
 
 Now the washed-out whistles spread Stepped my tongue 
 In narrow air. 
 Its chickens revolves 
 as a rose. Operation Lies. Old Mother 
 
 roast business 
 putting
