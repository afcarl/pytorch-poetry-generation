The Last Beam 

 Of boats. Now there is no real 
 There in the night when feet. 
 We mistake a milky afternoon 
 As someone that was afraid of it, 
 And if scraggled florist is like a dog, 
 Pale curing from the lonely neck. 
 Still, when you are as sick as dew 
 They would drift up, and find friends 
 Among the things I left in, 
 Was it thro' it rose so high, 
 This will take you away from you
