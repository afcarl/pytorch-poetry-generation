Them 

 If nothing was, less beautiful and more — 
 the winter remains 
 were Known listless now 
 gradually wasted after winter 
 I never can pour back and down. 
 
 4 
 Two of their buried names. 
 The discarded majestic armies gone 
 It’s money’s at the age 
 which unheeded, long remember, 
 of the training in the window; 
 the fatal (Arndt, 
 —E'en could the record 
 have kissed it to the grave. 
 
 It’s you Lenin 
 cool.
