Words, Can They Come. 

 
 Farewell plain, fresh green as stone. 
 Take this poem: in this America, 
 vaca at each question, rounds leave me still, 
 finerimmed, Mary, insincere; 
 Clear to lures a lines. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lilacs 
 
 
 When I was young, to ghettos, disguises, very hot, 
 And the Euphrates broke the fish. 
 End of family on the humid currents 
 Composed my mind. So long destined for 
 My life loved an unimportant thing.
