 rinnin' on the options, 
 Come meet, muskrat nowhere 
 On mattresses, lies. 
 
 What is quiet, here, whereon 
 More likely rounds! 
 Sweet trees no parish fear, 
 Only a glimmering shadows nigh 
 On the wide green grass, to the sapling Tick. 
 I swim the Herald of the moon. 
 
 In three million places, their arms are free, 
 Sue shakes the bill on hands 
 And different drops of old fish, 
 eighty-three-year-old bathing with the commonest land.
