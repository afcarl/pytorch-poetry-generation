T'Undo; 

 Away in their own bedroom, all-state scribbled 
 from the boot of angels and gulls which, though water 
 was young-- I sip my anger to a tree, 
 an chopped away to squeezed the door. 
 I'll hear him tremble as a ghosts of torpid bread, 
 and a kitchen that has been disappearing into college, 
 
 Bright bronze impending Surged, that they have not been in empty attention, 
 who, in any times; he said, whatnot, with his passions 
 must be poudre-marchant
