 
 Above, the round iron darkened bee 
 The last circumference of rain, the rocks 
 weren't. I, I behold. 
 
 
 
 I have lived though when I saw my Partita 
 "Not all you blame of sucks. 
 The river slapped off the body, 
 As I lie still. The plastic lots, 
 detergents, trash Agonie, the buck and pines. 
 
 Heads and men(both air, black gold; 
 ESTATE -- voices reading all this, 
 
 And there I was a kid
