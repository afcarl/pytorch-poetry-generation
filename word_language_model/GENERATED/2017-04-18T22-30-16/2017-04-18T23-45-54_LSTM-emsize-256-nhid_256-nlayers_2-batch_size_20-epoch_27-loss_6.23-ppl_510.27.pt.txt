Accompanied; Builds The Boards 

 Into summer, thick eggs as frown, 
 And with those ruined eyelids in the clouds.

 Drunk for canaan between thickets and reflecting legs 
 All in murder harvest from godlike Mount sky bend, 
 Ascend the fog within the darkness itself, 
 Its eyes that flashing open their silent green sides, 
 And Hopefully tears through the morning walls. 
 
 So I the tangles of one dream. 
 Here they are mongst the bridge, the dragon-fly
