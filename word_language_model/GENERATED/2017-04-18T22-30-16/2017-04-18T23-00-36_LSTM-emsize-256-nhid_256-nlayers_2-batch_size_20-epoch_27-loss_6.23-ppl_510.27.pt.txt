At Me, 

 But still in the room your cowslip hair over our shoulders, 
 Mortal, mind for you, 
 Stiff, lying, what queer days and 
 I ever had pregnant: 
 
 You were a man, I stayed in a red bed. 
 It seems to think things permanent, them. 
 Is this proof that you say, feast I Trouble. you get disruption 
 curb-- 
 Never urgent and enthrall'd 
 enough, made of love you've sung young 
 
 For you tickle profundo at The Oblivion's
