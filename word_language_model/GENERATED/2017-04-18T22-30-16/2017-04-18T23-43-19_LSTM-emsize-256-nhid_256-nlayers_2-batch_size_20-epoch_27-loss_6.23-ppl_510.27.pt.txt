How It Occurred For The Record, 

 
 that is in her anger, 
 the which pitch prepare? 
 
 
 
 
 
 Native Song 
 
 
 Little Robin and wonderful ... 
 Love trump huh fat - finery--tied-back 
 In passing bushes, two bright summer, 
 The mists already shone, half old; 
 The sods, against eyes, cities, star-spangled haggard gum, 
 Fresh barefoot sobbing from the slaughter, scratched 
 Their fruit is newly frosted wastes--the 
 By grains that prayers on tabernacle found
