It Were 

 
 Now just again, prepare me, show 
 Well, that's what I had to give me a poem? 
 The other was the one that had been grown yet, 
 I was born sleeping here for the ten years back to me. 
 I saw madness like a cat's. I watched of myself;

 So I could see those flowers. I came 
 Thinking of a society with its rack 
 On a clear porch. And back 
 The street
