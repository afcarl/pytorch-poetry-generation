American, 

 So the quiet line of it is still, 
 touch the oozing engines deep 
 From an hoary Ear, 
 foe-wards, shining roared the wave 
 With dew under the wintry sea. 
 
 There are calm streets of snow and mist, 
 Pure as the endless leaf. 
 
 Within this scene of poplar and night 
 Rode down and star-unfolding miles 
 prank, amid the million throstles hill." 
 Hear the rejoicing of the sun, 
 Fair breaths thrown off, now on the roof,
