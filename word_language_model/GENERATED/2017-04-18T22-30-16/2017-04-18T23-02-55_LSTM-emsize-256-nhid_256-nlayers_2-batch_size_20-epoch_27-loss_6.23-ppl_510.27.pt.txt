 is until it is, it's a cold time shut 
 and settles outside how many butterflies 
 we've managed like a master. Like some small one other 
 frightening and strong here up to sad 
 
 something intently 
 to pile them up

 similar, "She says 
 anyone opens my clothing, 
 through the etchings of fetal skin; 
 my broken drapes snow legs crying, candy 
 steep and tomato naked, striking the distance.
