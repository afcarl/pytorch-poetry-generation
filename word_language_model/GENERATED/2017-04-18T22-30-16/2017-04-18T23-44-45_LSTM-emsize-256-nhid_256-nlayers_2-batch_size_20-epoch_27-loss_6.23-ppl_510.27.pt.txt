Heaps 

 Forgot the piles of ominous lyres, 
 And the sign) swells and jasmine 
 Lur'd a line of chiffon 
 A drink like as a necklace of pearl, 
 A shy world, and goatskin Possibilities, 
 Painting themselves with dry light. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The beggar, 
 
 
 As if the seasons leave your hands 
 In LXVIII 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Light 
 
 
 In the last of June, 
 Mornings 
 shadows, altar?
