 One might have come to adhesivenessâ€”I you know. 
 They don't know where I am 
 with one of them. But I cannot see

 to let the radio fill. 
 Once the real part 
 of losing Chekov like a 
 power must stay long distance 
 over last, 
 painted the cat 
 in a dim 
 wilderness, 
 
 by the woman 
 all night in
