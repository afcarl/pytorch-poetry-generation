 honey, someone said. 
 Don't you read, why you say? 
 I do it once bundled a more clearly 
 balls on zero but it controls 
 into a vacuum of chicken wool, 
 and there is nothing I can 
 climb into my own, I want to discover 
 how I hold the changing tree, 
 walk back into the tree's music 
 where there is always a glow, I 
 am where I am not angry, though
