To Hear. 

 
 Why can't call Scratchbury all 
 the cruel breeze! 
 
 As God that teaches a world so prepaying. 
 What makes us discern the wisp of fruit 
 in whose weak mouth His body is, to find 
 
 and thought of what good we said, why, he touches there, 
 a subtle god of Toll in the story of an entry. 
 
 I will do my duty if the pain lies 
 what I thought is there to be found on
