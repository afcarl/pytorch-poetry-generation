Alarm, 

 With jealous eyes them back a bud, 
 Entering a thin ebb with amber skies, 
 And then a ghost upon the wrath of witness. 
 
 That well how Sharon reticence are fled, and saw 
 How good Simply the realm of Morn, 
 These time and time may call; what then--one 
 That squinting with thi own ten boys, 
 A bounteous bird, which led to home in thanksgiving) 
 That, like a tombstone of the painless sun, 
 Because in that still rubbed.
