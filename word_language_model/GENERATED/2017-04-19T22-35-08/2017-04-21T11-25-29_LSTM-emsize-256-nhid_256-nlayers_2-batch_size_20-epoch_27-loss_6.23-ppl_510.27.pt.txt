Boom 

 Cross on the lofts, 
 Night still casts him down, 
 A round blue-struck a lamp. 
 But it's always very cold 
 To put Heav'nlie down flambeau 
 And never wait at any time. 
 She'll unclose out the years they'll go 
 repeat. You know what is right. 
 I will leave you all to be sleeping 
 Patrizia knows not this 
 
 In the Gold bullchested 
 bulwarked askew tangent 
 Enslaved with sweat, 
 
 From 10 
 In the latitudes
