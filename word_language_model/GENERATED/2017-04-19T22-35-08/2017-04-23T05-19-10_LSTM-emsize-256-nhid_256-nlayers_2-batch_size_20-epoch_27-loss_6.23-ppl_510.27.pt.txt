Me? 

 
 
 
 Lay your wings,â€” Come and grow blind, 
 As a river of hatch-marked 
 Marching through earth, the red and valleys 
 Thou fiercer care your glorious priest, 
 Till Love pervades her still man's Long accord, 
 And when Spring departs, 
 As fit to make other notes 
 But to the moon's delight I cannot see; 
 For those such plumes and robins saw, 
 You e'er are done, with wills. 
 
 Passion or lady, no one exists ever more!
