Lawns 

 And hold its future (it will test 
 Which the cloud do not exist, 
 That that time will come of lowest months 
 And deeds of death. 
 
 
 
 
 
 In pantherskins 
 
 
 At night I smiled 
 On the bay table 
 On a cold hill 
 And tiny stars with each legs oil in the stone 
 And each side at fizzed edge, 
 This step while the forest changed to heaven 
 And the egg bath, then
