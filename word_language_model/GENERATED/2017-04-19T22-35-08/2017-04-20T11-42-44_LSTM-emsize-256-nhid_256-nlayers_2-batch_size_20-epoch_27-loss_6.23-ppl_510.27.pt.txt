One Here In Exile 

 Without our wish. 
 It has only clearly, like gold whose feet 
 Throb elsewhere like a deathblow! 
 This white, the body, vast, and bright, 
 Into the regions of this world. 
 
 Did, as you returnd up the streets 
 Of life in the body of Austrian dolls 
 whose marriage is, the old Nymph, that keeps 
 the soft recedes of thirty- 
 with deaf hands come from the stem 
 and made it that air was entirely parley,
