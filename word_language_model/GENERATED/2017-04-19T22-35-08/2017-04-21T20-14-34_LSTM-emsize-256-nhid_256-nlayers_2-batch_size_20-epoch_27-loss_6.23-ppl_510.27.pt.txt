Cannot Take, 

 Till life's great horned river sings so blue, 
 Its smiles peep like beating upon stones 
 Over the ball. Inside the smoke-wreaths seas. 
 Then dreaming give way to the shepherd's fraud. 
 Come shun o'er Arthur dying thirty years old, 
 By the pure wind alone in the dim waves, 
 No braver man shall now be past; 
 And in death he'll cry, by absence flows 
 Unto my neighbourhood cheek: then, yet I know 
 Himself now, as they led mine
