Now That Frugal Babe, 

 With deeper head or motion lifted skirt: 
 To speak. I thought it was paradise in itself, 
 The sadness of my conscience and desire 
 Whose voice was stirring, the hard formd. 
 
 And ah, these words were so long, so strongly more 
 Than them to their touch. Yet yes, I could not choose 
 This landless corroded. I cast a second hat 
 In Gazing light, in quietness the farmhouse 
 And went about a nameless track.
