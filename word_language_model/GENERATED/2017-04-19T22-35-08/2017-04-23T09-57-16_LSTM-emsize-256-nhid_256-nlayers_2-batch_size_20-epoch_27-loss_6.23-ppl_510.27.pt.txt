 When the panther now 
 measur'd and great beef came back in the grass 
 and danced in the fire. I figured 
 weather supposed to serve my mind. 
 
 When I was thinking he was saying? 
 
 The honking zipped me in his head, 
 I bade him touch his mitt 
 In my cheeks and lust 
 And waved them back to kisses. 
 I slept before smelts 
 Found all beneath the sky 
 Where I would only see 
 When broken
