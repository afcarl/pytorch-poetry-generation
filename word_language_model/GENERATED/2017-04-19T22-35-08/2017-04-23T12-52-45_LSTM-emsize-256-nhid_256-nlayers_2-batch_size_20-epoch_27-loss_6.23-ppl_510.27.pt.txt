Weir-- 

 As my nights go again away. 
 The sea has size with me, 
 But I like to study claws, 
 I lay field and put the twig 
 
 schnitzel 
 
 By what remains will sustain 
 Our pain below us able 
 To shine with no Regiment's of ourselves, 
 A curious reverence's drowns 
 With coral bolts and lizards 
 
 Days of God's cryptic shore can settle 
 A friendship: watch with enrich a tomb, 
 A swamp:-- ship's formed.
