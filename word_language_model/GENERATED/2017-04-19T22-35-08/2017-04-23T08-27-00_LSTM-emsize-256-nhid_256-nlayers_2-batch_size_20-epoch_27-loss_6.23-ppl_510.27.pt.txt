Again Alphard, The Visions, So Like, 

 and I suppose I have handed myself 
 up. Can you hear after my whom, a knell 
 you're in every voice or return and play 
 along, I think I won't touch it while you 
 ate. In a depths of voile some rounds, 
 the moon, who'd suits my hand. You need a blue-green hat, 
 There's no gay land. Was the sea the transformation had bend. 
 There was never a dream: no only flesh and lives,
