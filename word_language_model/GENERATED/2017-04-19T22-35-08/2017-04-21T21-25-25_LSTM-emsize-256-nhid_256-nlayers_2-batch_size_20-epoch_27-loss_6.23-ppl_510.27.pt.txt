Strings 

 While sails a blooming bowl still leans, 
 And held wild stars animal. 
 
 She pulled along a brow . . . 
 It was a scarf for him, 
 Like the chopped rivers seem to go, 
 Long voices visibly called to go. 
 The hoarse green flowing rocks, 
 Its smooth hair bearded like cheap 
 # and whirl, 
 Like foam hummed drifting 
 Into a overripe veil 
 shillelaghs racks sharpening dropped 
 We, allotted door and measuring bells.
