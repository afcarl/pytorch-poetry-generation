 So look about things write? 
 
 I have seen before the west 
 Visit'st the darkness and spar 
 that stir by blood the paw 
 of black trees like the tide 
 that can knowledge to pull on, 
 and murmur upwards 
 from the minivan as she calls 
 to move off to the boredom of a steer 
 through the waves of york time, 
 the flamingo kicking a gleam 
 of gunny and broken money- 
 
 bric-a-brac-- and cedars arose
