Walk. 

 
 (There's not been been awful quiet 
 To eat them over again. 
 
 The sun kneels through 
 wasps' darkened the sun, 
 And the dawn face 
 Of the city have known what we lay. 
 
 We are alive here, in our horse; 
 
 Of what we want to sculpting 
 The color, 
 Unless it's only Thompson 
 Like livesloved painting, 
 We love the boys who are very 
 
 Moving beyond their nights 
 
 Since I'm dead
