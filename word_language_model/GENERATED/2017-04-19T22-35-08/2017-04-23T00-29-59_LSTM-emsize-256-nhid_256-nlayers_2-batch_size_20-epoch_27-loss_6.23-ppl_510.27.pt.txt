 
 
 
 The tide 
 Was spun off on. 
 The horse dirty and my mother 
 Gathered a thousand pounds 
 
 In autumn when I play 
 Your courage Epist. deities, 
 I wish all ends its thoughts, 
 Always only once read: 
 By the swift place I would go to the souls 
 Beside a pathless floor. 
 
 
 
 The Loneliness 
 as he moves between India 
 stroke his broken body heal-all, he moves 
 like a Frisco black-and-white
