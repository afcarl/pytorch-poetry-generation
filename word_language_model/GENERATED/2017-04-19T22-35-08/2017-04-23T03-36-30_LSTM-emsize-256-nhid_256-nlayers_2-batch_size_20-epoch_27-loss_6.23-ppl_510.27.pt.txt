Up, Straight To Messe, 

 there now I remember gold, to me whinnys 
 Michael alone and James Crop dance Hispahan, 
 And thinly his delight. 
 Between the trees. 
 
 And I will him transform my ice after last 
 Of my pecker 
 And shave the bottle with strange permission 
 To please the sky-barracks the soon points 
 Out of me the hour, the old said I also feel Ynn 
 
 
 
 
 
 molehills the 24 Falls 
 
 
 wing-pits,
