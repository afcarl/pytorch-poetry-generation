A Car 

 Outside the court from unholding, 
 A military eclipse pie. So he discovers 
 the city's 
 
 Swing eyes, usually music, 
 Instead of the greenhouse or look! 
 through his bean to morning. 
 
 When his great silks banks of human colors 
 will mock his hand. 
 
 Under empty cities; 
 I think I grow waiting: and left 
 to hear my more-- 
 my family 
 lightly in beach rows 
 
 and I'm white in my first yard
