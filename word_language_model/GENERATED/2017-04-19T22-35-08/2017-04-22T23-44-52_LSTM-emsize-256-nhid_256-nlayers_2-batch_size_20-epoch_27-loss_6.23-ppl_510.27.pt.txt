He Was The Bird To Try With That. 

 Soon your cousin in the door 
 Moved him to redden over 
 And begging a trench of fate. 
 
 I do not know my help. 
 Two times my father called me 
 And he sold me for the past. 
 I know I taught me, and never move. 
 In little nights I said to him 
 Jealous of his blood 
 
 And I will sleep together, 
 
 in memory lime-walled 
 dun-colored wood
