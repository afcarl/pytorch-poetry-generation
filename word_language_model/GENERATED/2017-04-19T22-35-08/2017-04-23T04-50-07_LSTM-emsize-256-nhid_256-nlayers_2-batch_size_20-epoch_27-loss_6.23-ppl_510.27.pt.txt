Tityrus 

 
 May the world prove nothing like 
 A holding round and stuns a smooth flat silent lips, 
 And blowing, and when depraved to a East again. 
 Let us shine. If only the sea will happen Runty 
 Take off the Trojan patterns for they should leave me 
 With his own work day-labour, nose, a critic in the sky. 
 The paint is over 
 The Lord since tell them, would not be good. 
 
 Itâ€™s up, my mother, not I. according
