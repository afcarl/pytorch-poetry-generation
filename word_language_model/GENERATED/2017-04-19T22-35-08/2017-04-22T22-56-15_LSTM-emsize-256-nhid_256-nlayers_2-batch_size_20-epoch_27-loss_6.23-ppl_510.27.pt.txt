 Was it when pluck'd, have been imitation. 
 
 But let the day no more bare iron blows, 
 But while immortal god, 
 See fair motion, sank, the North swirled. 
 Bid a merry penny sound, 
 That warms by a sudden pool that tells 
 
 The blest weak scythe of shadows. 
 But as one thing like weed was lost, 
 Which makes us fair and lost fool-like 
 When they piss o'er the dreaming deep, grave fountainheads. 
 When droop like nursery cowslip
