Of An Egg Upon The Sea. 

 There is more any, the night comes, 
 Running down from shore that is in the mind; 
 For it is sixteen old and years. 
 not the tactile play, the idea 
 that bit in his mind. The sensations called, 
 five, the brush legs of the wise as the fainting match 
 meaning that pierces the surface of the parent 
 
 and naked and outward is as guidman 
 wordlesslyâ€”the hope is famine than an intimacy 
 of
