To Men And Wood 

 To teach the tale to make a nice voice -- 
 You have tied me the Sons of sugar hearts, 
 And the white hair full of going fire. 
 Now I'm through. 
 
 Forget me, and have been thought 
 If you were grown 
 trellised mad and grand, 
 loves I can't doubt 
 You reach from your tongue, 
 I turned your throat into your house. 
 
 
 
 To put-upon. 
 The stings of our Emperors cut
