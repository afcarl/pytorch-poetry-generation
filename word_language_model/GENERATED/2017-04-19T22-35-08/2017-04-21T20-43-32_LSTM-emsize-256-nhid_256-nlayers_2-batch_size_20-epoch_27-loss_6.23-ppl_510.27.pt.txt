Drapes Like A Wedge 

 Through a blue mound of wine, each soul a good event, 
 As slowly at the edge of the town, 
 Swiftly as it sounds like liberty. 
 
 What is the retrofit sign 
 That ever thundered of the stars that use the stars 
 That fly and water gently deep, 
 And the Sunday work is, and the will of time Mercury 
 In what fair strength goes down to all that swim; 
 Our meeting women are copious, style
