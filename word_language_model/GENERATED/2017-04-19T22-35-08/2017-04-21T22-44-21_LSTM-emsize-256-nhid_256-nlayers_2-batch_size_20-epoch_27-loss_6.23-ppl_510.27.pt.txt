 
 thral is the masks that are not and keepsakes. 
 But nature's diverse prison doth blow, 
 Keep life o' Spain and urine and men? 
 It's come too late and hawthorn in time. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Dream 
 
 
 Sometimes 
 not single mirled on a lonely load, 
 king of a sunset as a day, 
 blood sundered on Earth 
 and what is point is 
 . . . 
 O let the fires again 
 come black
