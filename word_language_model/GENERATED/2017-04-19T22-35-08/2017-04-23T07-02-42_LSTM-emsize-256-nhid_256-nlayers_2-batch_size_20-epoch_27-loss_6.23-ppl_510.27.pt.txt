 Out of a leafy lantern 
 Where doors were armed with the apple - 
 With ocean, plunging sculpture 
 And tilting forever: it rode the shell, 
 And faint sweet tones the waves Covered 
 With rounded doors 
 
 Like sails profound & cow 
 Cut in chalk, 
 A (dis?)guises; did not scold -- 
 A little way the world has will, 
 Nor Jews, but lddon like State's 
 
 Then, as the wall was round, the river 
 Received on the midnight
