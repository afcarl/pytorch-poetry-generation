 ELEGIES and bobble and inventing day; 
 
 And as we ride, exposed to the hour 
 Of America, the marshy bass replacements, 
 Blown like a message in the trees, 
 And hurried up the Bay of snow. 
 
 We tore our echoes on, and we fuddle 
 In the wavering tree. 
 A madness: clever man. Eight men buried 
 Are doubled pitching out of the high leaves, 
 bick keen by sky; 
 rounds-- and shrimp fan.
