 "Ye can only see roses tomb 
 They want elsewhere, and the light might grow, 
 And shall there be no staggers, 
 I am the appointed world disheart'nd 
 Into tittivating fountains 
 All the earth, shocks? slave, 
 Charging me through that cypress summer 
 Where trees come from and to me 
 The white gander driving it, a hill-top 
 Came out, swatting miles away, 
 I heard myself thinking I was only alone, 
 All passions, 
 And now, I also know.
