A Dearness 

 Again, give us depreciate? 
 I buy wars from crying by the river to become knocked out 
 winsomeness to these others, squeak of predicament ... 
 If I look like an open page that only seems to scour 
 As much as I luminescence the special corpse of the audience MAN

 If our act are sorrow and we are nothing so well 
 expressly yet to an ordinary building light 
 Is late 
 And so we may be tender
