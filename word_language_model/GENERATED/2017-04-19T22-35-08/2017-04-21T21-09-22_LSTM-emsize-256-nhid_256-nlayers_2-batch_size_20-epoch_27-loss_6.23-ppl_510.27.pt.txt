Night-Mare 

 What name of itself serve it, but here; 
 When I came when it falls to the chin, 
 With its fat teeth to shades. How far 
 And seasons, thought the scroll, bean-blossoms 
 Close the sky to the slit the pallor of a gorge. 
 
 Wrapping his birds, dance, drowsy from its west, 
 Hinting we watch other winds Gebad the notes of her 
 hearts) though the merciful heaven die 
 To rage the woods in winter at dawn rain make Strutted
