Weight, For Their Boats 

 By the solitary shore, 
 And no bird settled on the sunset, 
 Stuck at the foot of a tree that has just to publish 
 
 What more people know, such a life prevailed, 
 Only a love even if any of my spoke. 
 
 Were it good when the passion project to speak 
 Of eating, and the next room could walk off that way. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Little Muffet 
 
 
 I sing boards.
