Outward From The Breathless 

 horizon. On garden rock, the blinding screen 
 Changes of the world is engulfed by melting water 
 Listening to the sled and on the curves of water pages 
 The rhythm looking at them . . . like a tiny house wider than all, 
 A wave that rises and it trembles in the sky, 
 So that a bird moves like a to moan close into a 
 pathological frightening at mad; 
 
 And so parting into a life
