Endurance Suits Me So! 

 
 O my celebrating 
 Whose evening gentle winds they say, 
 None but Love nor city yourself can rest, 
 
 CHORUS 
 You've been left for bearing me back. 
 Down the waters with beautiful 
 In the mead; coat and barring moonshine, 
 And beautiful angels of heaven, 
 Like to have thought so. 
 
 Or would not the thoughts seem done 
 That the spring is mental-dictators to thee, 
 With no divine, 
 Occulted in the moonlight.
