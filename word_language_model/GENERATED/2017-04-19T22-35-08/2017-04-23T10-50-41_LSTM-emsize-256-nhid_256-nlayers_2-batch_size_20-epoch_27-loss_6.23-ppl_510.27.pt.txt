The Teats, Dim, Memory 

 Makest the hard-mouthed light. 
 
 It were the morning. As we led a goose, 
 Drunk with all the clouds and clay, and then the 
 shops creaks on both sides and autumn, 
 In the wag!" I dreamt 
 I'd felt Clams, 
 
 Looking at starlight. Our arms grazed in dust, 
 You guess: but you 
 Is this o'clock. 
 
 Give another long time. 
 Though I listen, we defy youâ€” 
 Let us never have our life
