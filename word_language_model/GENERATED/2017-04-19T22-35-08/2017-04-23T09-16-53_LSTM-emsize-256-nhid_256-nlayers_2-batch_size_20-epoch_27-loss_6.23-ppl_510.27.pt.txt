 that use which all is to my son 
 What am I to do with my name? 
 A crowd dosvedanya, from my knee 
 Such a weight can die to. 
 
 
 
 
 She beats the dead 
 Wires and all she was born. 
 My eyes, stirring her and you head up and down 
 To her to it sat inside her arm, 
 She was wild and shifted to the stake -- 
 My toes keep her hand in ears' ecstasy.
