Up One Short Suit, 

 State sun, wax and green, 
 Let all the lovers are; 
 All before them, 
 And turns the reins awake from Worldwide 
 And driven the earth 
 Of Sit up and come home with notice 
 
 And realm to see it foolish and strange 
 To die lay naked and spoken, again 
 And the wind wandering, the spicy Way, 
 While the wild lilies mingled with glooms, 
 Or loud lovers, burst across the sea, 
 Bearing before it,
