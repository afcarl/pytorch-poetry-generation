 And the whole house falls with these smiling 
 And hearing the voice furrows: one of the ancient 
 Last star in my head 
 Makes it come and perhaps my hole high through my jaundiced waters 
 Eyeing space & warm rain firm & steadily; 
 Forty-seventh spikes carefully rising from the red linking 
 Of dollhouse-size, but hopes? never fill 
 A body of Arkwright and violet, (Dale, innocent and kind 
 cross. 
 I live like a minute, and see it yes!
