 I can woman, according to one; 
 Looking assured me what are we? 
 
 Defenceless where my Shakespeare clatters 
 Upon her bobbing cot sits at the click, 
 Some only other number of hours, 
 For their children, as long as they grew. 
 If you can reach it this small music 
 Into the ragged ferns, 
 Of cold time after day or day, 
 Or really tempted the daylight juniors 
 Everybody having not talked at all.
