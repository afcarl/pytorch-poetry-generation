Complaint, 

 The dead to give the truth worlds, 
 And is not the weather to our proper good. 
 
 This is the next fishing to be on a bench, 
 above these rooms we visited the source 
 of remotest misery; 
 most delicious is the fruit's prays; 
 who, dark and high, the ruinous passes, 
 the heavens' rock, where the leaves are 
 particular cyclone like knives in the dress, 
 that every fragment is a clear, which at night, 
 the entire pearl
