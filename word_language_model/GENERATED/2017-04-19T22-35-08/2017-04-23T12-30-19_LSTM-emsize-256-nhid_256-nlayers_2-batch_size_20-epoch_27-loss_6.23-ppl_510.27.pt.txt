Pastorals Men? 

 I knew no words. I'm sure it was important 
 For people that never said something else 
 That I hoped to do without terrors, yet I have thrilled 
 What I 
 must not have proved when that flicks on with a man, 
 and what they are in it, 
 nothing will screen or happen. 
 All those are published and high and yellow 
 as they sink in light, 
 they seem like to be the cool- 
 nourished where they move,
