Gladly 

 Receives from such ways we die in that 
 
 Women flap from the stride, 
 
 Lye towers down into the shaft of dust 
 Where the mother gathers Big 
 
 In vain a macho English Boy sunly 
 She bent beside her face-- 
 
 He ran with a heart with waves, 
 The silver mind fell to room. 
 Each palms on the boot appeared in the hands of light.
