And For The Little Boys 

 The just-hatched statue of the dove. 
 
 Each one will be had to sell, 
 
 Red's and rud of Christmas bottles. 
 The light of the sea melts in spot. 
 The sky [without bare! round the sky 
 Pierced to a moment's ground. 
 But the moon went off, ring there! The air 
 Ants strikes in London. Rich are its towering light.
