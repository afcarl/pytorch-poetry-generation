Human Gain. 

 They'd raise us from the mountains, 
 And all the way our baby 
 
 In the sky: the story 
 Too, its little evil. 
 
 
 
 When Angel lived in the world 
 Is the slope of a reappearance 
 To some buried Christmas tower, 
 On a stroke as the house. 
 The garden opens in its laptop. 
 
 Let me sleep down forever. 
 The journey house go to! 
 Then we'll look from his privacy.
