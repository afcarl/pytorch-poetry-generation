Endless Air, 

 Stealing the sweat of a young age. 
 
 But it is far away for it still, 
 And for more, a bird's joy, 
 Times play like a sinking dream. 
 
 From a ethical thoughtless strand 
 As a naked appears; 
 The steps of private children gather 
 For the dreams that played than dergestalt, 
 I, a member of me. 
 
 I have never prayed for one more 
 Till they strive and weep to it. 
 Is how far
