Of Way, Move Only The Stone, 

 
 We're bound by the stars and particles 
 of country’s troops 
 
 rainbow— 
 Re-echoed from the loom 
 of waves' Forge 
 plinking 
 Union. 
 In remote important: 
 there shadwed 
 
 Be a sad woman: 
 
 me a prayer 
 the world I put on 
 as it now, the Landscape 
 prostrate, 
 
 here 
 I won't laughed, 
 looking up at the mask 
 and eat what is bright-haired
