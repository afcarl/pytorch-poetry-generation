Tall Mountains And That 

 Lost cold and page-- 
 Down in night's dark where the snow 
 Comes a narrow blue. 
 
 Then the bridge, familiar against 
 The vines crying, lightning leaped & wat, 
 The pedantic stillness beat 
 An ironical definition of duty. 
 
 We plug in a tunnel full of air; 
 A man who must discern the power 
 Of the men on the battle cup 
 Two dead and blank. 
 
 I know my fascist neighbor said
