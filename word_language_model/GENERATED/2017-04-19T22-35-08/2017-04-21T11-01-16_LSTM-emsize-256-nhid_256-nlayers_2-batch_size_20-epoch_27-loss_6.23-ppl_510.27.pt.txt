Picture There, 

 Four-footed not wearing things. 
 
 
 
 I sat pressed around my left window, 
 I nod in my wrists as it was, 
 Below the Sunday shadows triggered 
 By the river. So close it was, 
 It sea!" 
 I have seen the tread of the fickle grave, 
 I hope to see m√≠. spread up 
 And grow evill too 
 To look up where it's lilies 
 On the lake like a walrus, 
 Clothed with the siege, and pious
