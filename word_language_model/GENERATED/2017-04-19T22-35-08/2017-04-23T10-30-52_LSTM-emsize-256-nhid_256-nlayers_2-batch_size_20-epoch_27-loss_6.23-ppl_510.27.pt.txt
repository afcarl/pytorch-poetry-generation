Cam, Of Brown 

 Is convinc'd to the form of the womanâ€™s God youth: 
 Both of them were under touching ledge 
 In the arms and anglosaxon sunlight. 
 
 And this still has wrought to our place there is attention. 
 The old dog washes her lips to his tyranny, 
 And press his finger to his shore. 
 
 His eyes are shallow on the grass, 
 He is the waiter as he used to go. 
 
 Members of the north merrymaking possibility,
