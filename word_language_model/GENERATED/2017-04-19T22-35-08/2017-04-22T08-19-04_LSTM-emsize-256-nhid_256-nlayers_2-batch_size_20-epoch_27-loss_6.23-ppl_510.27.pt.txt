And Though Yet It Higher: 

 A friend you will not trust 
 The manly ones. What have I muttered for. 
 Better that put me grown. 
 Our common knowledge is brother-thief 
 More familiar than a girl's. 
 
 After now beyond the fields 
 For weariness of duplex 
 Sylvan orphans come, the agate cups, the jest, 
 Follow her in boots tonight. 
 
 When she went tumbling by, 
 A king in her door was flying, 
 She thinks no more she had.
