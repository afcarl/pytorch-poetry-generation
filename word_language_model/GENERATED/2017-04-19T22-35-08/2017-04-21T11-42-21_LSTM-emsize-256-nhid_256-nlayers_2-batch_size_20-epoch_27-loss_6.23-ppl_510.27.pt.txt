The Festive Fence 

 By Henry jacket playing through 
 The stench of love and clouds grazing a head. 
 
 A brothers, a body broken from rivers of the water; 
 Cyriack, all, with joy, lifted off your heart, 
 The Wabash of the dark, in whose bourn 
 The passion that everyday this town and the river 
 In which all rest may be fools. The salt welcome to come. 
 
 
 
 That is not a wound, though in love is not managed
