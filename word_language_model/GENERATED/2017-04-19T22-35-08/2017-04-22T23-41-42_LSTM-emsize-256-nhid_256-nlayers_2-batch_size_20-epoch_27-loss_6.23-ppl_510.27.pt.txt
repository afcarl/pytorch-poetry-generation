 communion: snowballing; 
 Chill in distress. 
 How to prohibition, stone 
 ringlets of those lost 
 stuttering of maps the wood 
 Of the wish! 
 The six gray yellow lights 
 hanging like an infant's leaf 
 Or the proud boat, you discovered this skull, 
 His feet I broke behold a juke 
 In Seats; 
 Inside that dust 
 I give stronger more 
 On you listening. 
 In the dark air, I cross the hall 
 Lost by the waters I counted
