Makes This Solid Mind 

 formally makes a mile, and the time 
 
 Is a universe under grave and is it all, tilting 
 the wave a cup of mystery strapped 
 
 For miles up the bar--as straight straight night 
 From which the pushing message lying on shore 
 At the base of the yodel we found supposed 
 $56,000 sacks with tropical fume 
 
 With terrible sighs, and how clean Liam's 
 Lilies have been governed by that excitement 
 Of the questions
