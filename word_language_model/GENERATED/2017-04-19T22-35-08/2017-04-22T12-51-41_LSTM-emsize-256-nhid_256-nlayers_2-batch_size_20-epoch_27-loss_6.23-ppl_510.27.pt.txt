Tall In Cloth, 

 I shall not burn the tune 
 And lodge you to continue to the bones of need? 
 Now I see thee, I perceive you, and so it goes, 
 I a lily's kind of true-love-knot and Jack, 
 Play the thing that shall be crying patiently 
 When I visitors watch my house shall not be crying with. 
 
 
 
 I've outlived you seem to speak their way 
 a child's pipe through a silent year. The legless 
 apple tree,
