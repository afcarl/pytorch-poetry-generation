 These that rings through a cloud 
 Of Eros underneath the face, 
 Here to the dead and cold a winter pain 
 Where tiny swan together may be shown, 
 There afterward 
 A phantom much tends to fatten 
 Their close due brightness undone our own. 
 
 The grackle lifts his father's head, 
 And whistles in my wings. 
 Sander sad in me! dreamt of all of them, 
 Daily falters and other body. 
 He must don the ache of every knife.
