 Leaning over the city's onslaught 
 Covered by the sun 
 Or station. 
 
 The ropes tug like stars 
 And branches tanned 
 With meadows, airs and woes, 
 Eyes that leap to grasp, 
 And by their graves a white rock 
 Cut in into a glare 
 That sits when the others tread 
 With the fresh clove of self-blessing; 
 And they taste a rising Flag, 
 Grim whatever girl says now -- 
 No longer could be, and tears go.
