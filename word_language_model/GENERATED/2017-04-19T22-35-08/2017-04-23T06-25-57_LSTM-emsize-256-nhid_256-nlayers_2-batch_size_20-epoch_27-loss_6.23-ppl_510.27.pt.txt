Friend, 

 And in me sleep for floures year, 
 And on the corner of the Crumpetty day, 
 The alterations will reach their eyes, 
 Care red to look at fall, Marie, glide 
 The madness like plum sets in the waist! 
 
 Sore silent waves are rustling round at table, 
 london. softly, politics, loving, blue, 
 Farmers do you love me, even too, 
 To xed empty cages. 
 
 
 
 
 
 To the Task, Book Death that Son of Time
