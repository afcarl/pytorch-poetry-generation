 With leaves the vines sweep the empty heart. 
 There's no feast to our irony. 
 I slept danced where the embers 
 speaks, I send you 
 Amid the arctic land. 
 I think acting Determind, Greek mines once planted 
 In this doorway we can wrestle all night 
 At the top of the shore even as you shake our own lot. 
 Beat on her for the light of the child's bright maples 
 Let go loud under the break of cold silk trees.
