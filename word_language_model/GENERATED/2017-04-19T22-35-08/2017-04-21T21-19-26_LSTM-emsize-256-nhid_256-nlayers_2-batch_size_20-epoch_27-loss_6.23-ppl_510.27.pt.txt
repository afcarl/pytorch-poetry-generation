 But perhaps the ear is 
 Like the mourning 
 Cana caused 
 That mirror--no exhibition of life, 
 Dead grams, truest root from America 
 fairs, to these 
 Dim lives in watered rooms, silver-flecked 
 unutterably at them not 
 Nor a meadow. 
 So looks on the wrong words. 
 
 
 
 I can see till the excitement of its pan, 
 Has no dream to hold from pain; 
 Of paie. cotton and revolv'd 
 My dreaming foul, the familiar out,
