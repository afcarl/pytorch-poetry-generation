All People, Lone And Cool, 

 Lest so, pianos and trembles at once, 
 in one on the glowing dew-locks of a knife, 
 
 the Minstrel of Heaven so pressured. 
 
 Why should I sleep all, 
 think I should know rebellion did. 
 
 
 
 Sonnets around a school 
 
 everyone 
 
 is converted 
 
 "compassion on 
 joints at ease 
 
 they sway after them 
 
 one section of Lincoln, 
 
 Black S. moon 
 swims edges
