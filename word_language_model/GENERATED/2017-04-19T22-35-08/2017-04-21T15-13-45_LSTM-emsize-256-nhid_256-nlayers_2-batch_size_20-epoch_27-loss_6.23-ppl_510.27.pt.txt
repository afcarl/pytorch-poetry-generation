 
 At night they pause where all the noise 
 Are shadows on the street completed. 
 
 Not clearly in silent Day. 
 Still it seemed shifts to a tree. 
 This too could be, just as it was. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Little Way 
 
 
 The romantic bird calls him 
 Conversing, hair," 
 
 And hesitates on the fence to silence, 
 
 naked at the breasts 
 inside us 
 
 DRESSED mankind.
