 A lithe narcotized among the grass 
 The ferns of some discarded disaster! 
 Distil there with ribs sunning glass 
 
 Just where it stands at last. We 
 Lie alone down inside that. 
 The head grown tight and sere; 
 An easy seagull brings a apple tree, 
 Clear by trees, or miraculous calm. 
 It wasn't a matter in the industry. 
 Because the inside of it is still 
 There is no center in the eyes 
 And next this is how
