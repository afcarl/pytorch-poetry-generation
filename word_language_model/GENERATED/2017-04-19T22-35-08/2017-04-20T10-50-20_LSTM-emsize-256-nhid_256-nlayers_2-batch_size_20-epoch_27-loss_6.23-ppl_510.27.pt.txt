Any Where, 

 Young, waiting for these days to be free -- 
 Witness against the people intense and angry 
 Around the sawmills and the Eagleâ€™s bulbs seat... 
 Thoughts like himself, as breakfast as dog. 
 
 My children 
 Are as bad as lovers and sturdy. 
 The fields, the birds, the dogs, the earth. 
 
 The Eternity. Served in their illusion, but turns 
 As death) and under. They make the sky, where, 
 In last few years of this hour, "second"?
