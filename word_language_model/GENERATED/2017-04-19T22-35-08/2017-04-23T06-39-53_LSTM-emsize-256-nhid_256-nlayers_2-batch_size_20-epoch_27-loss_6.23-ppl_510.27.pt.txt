 drudge at hunger's 12 
 Both of how to structure a while 
 Till the last wind lapping its rock, 
 And landing in April for wanting weather, 
 And female worms are fleeing.

 Some light high; I think, I loved my dearest Shrilly 
 Surrounded deep and strange I see is sure I loved 
 Sure. fluids, till I confront divine!
