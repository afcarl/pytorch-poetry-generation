Like Lozenge, Cries At The 

 crossroads 
 Sweet steel?" 
 
 Over the river, and through my marsh 
 seem'd to start quieter, work, holy; 
 Names blow up my stationery, 
 I am when you are all you 
 do not feel this. 
 
 
 
 1. About Escape 
 innocence 
 by God 
 
 my favorite morning 
 
 is a 
 gold of desire lost in the street 
 
 upon the continent of a mineral looming in the elevator
