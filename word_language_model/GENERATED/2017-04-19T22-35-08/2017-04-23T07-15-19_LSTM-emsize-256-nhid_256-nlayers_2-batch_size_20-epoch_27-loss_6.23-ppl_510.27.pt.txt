Know. 

 
 He spoke not by the soul, Stars traveled 
 Into the kitchen, like a laughter normally, 
 Like he swirls for the life that bears his wife 
 In his presence, the fluted coloring of a collar 
 sprinkled slipping into a wilderness,

 with his arm's fires amongst the clouds 
 and danced, toys behind the junk counter, 
 have carried their food, beyond the kitchen 
 the woods on the holes
