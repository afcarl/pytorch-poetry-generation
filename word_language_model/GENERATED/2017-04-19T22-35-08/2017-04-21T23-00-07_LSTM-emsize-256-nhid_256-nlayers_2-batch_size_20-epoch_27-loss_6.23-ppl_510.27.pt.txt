As It Was, 

 and I will have over-familiar splendor 
 who set him in all his hand 
 or regards personnel 
 and continually trails on, 
 Wasted, loud, and lifting his swollen 
 ridges without a shred of stranger. 
 
 When the upstairs bull appears, 
 he fumbles for a trade, 
 Until the dead had been driven into head 
 or gurgle like narrowing papers, 
 a minor tongue stuck up 
 
 broke down the spot 
 where his head had been afloat,
