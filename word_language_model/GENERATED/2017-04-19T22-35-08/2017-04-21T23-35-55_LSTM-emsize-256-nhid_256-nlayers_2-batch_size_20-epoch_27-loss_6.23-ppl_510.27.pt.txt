You 

 Deserters take it 
 Into my home. 
 
 ... And this black day 
 Is drowned in the ferry. 
 But, oh, another star 
 For all alone that stirs 
 Wild dazzling night, 
 And the seasons pursue 
 A child who does not know. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Superior children 
 
 
 And we are sitting at a tear-shaped 
 The weight of which we walk, 
 Meaning how to live with it, 
 It dies in silence hurried
