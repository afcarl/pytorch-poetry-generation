Here; Rejoice! 

 Need so gentle the storm he vanished, 
 And all the latches rolled off, 
 Gives him Longnose and why, 
 Near the zephyr-sigh forego; 
 His drouthy strip√©d bill 
 weighted him, despite 
 His sweetness at the corpse. 
 
 From the barge I do?" hear 
 The Stillness in his Hao, 
 Who met the weed-choked duck 
 To burd'nd moue from the Night opaline. 
 Yes, slow labor and dreams. 
 A gentle fountain of time: 
 shock of fog; then
