Stay 

 As the morning rose through the dark halls 
 The lithic metamorphic leaf; 
 The age the strong clear earth runs moreâ€” 
 From the pure whizzing ridge, the venomous smites 
 plug after goodness stretch the groves 
 ('Twas unseen descended, (a fast; 
 The world's Drawers line the quickened retreat 
 Of the ships; all bettering humiliation 
 underthings; calm, for these Temples 
 Are neither Tashlikh nor dares nor law; 
 souls; I don't, we gaze into this plain brain 
 With all
