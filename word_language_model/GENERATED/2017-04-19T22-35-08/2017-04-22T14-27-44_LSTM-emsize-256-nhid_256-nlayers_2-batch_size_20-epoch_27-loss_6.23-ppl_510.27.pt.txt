Do Not Still, 

 Slams and stars; 
 Behold me, east, and Sunday June 
 Fled until I remember 
 This place that exists in your end, 
 I live ere doubting wakes the labouring prayer 
 
 If I bid stillness, or saying keep. 
 Behold, there's nothing unsubdu'd. 
 Let thing be well to me? 
 
 But when the world was not before 
 When I was one-and-twenty 
 I love thee best what thou hast done 
 By knowing and for a' me,
