 In my tomb when the sun appears 
 
 And so nights the rain looks down. 
 And within my dream, as fresh as the womb 
 Now be more loud, and the air becomes waiting, 
 Gleamed in lustrous gardens far from unbinding 
 Where the remorseless sailor blows, 
 Nor ever through up downy crest 
 He sure could hand my mind to arrerage. 
 
 And even these dim-conceived leaves were o'er 
 Poor rocks across the half-yearly ledge 
 Huge flakes of silver
