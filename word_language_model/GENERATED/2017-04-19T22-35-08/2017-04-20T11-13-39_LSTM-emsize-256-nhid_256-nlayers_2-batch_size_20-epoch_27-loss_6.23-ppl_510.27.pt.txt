When I Saw The Skull 

 In the wood, where I was crack upon the 
 bush with one black birth; I was a name 
 decaf. allowed. Then they read 
 In the filthy circles, people set out to the surface 
 As they draw out into new bracken-rooft, each new River, confess 
 I didn't need no other hands: and how I called you too well. 
 It was the language of argument 
 For the helicopter that is equal and Pancho 
 Like a man
