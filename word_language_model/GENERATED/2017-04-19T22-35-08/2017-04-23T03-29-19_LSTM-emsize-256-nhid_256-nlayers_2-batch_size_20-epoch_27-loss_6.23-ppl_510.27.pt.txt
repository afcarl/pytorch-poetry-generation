Down 

 Into the growing Peak, 
 But century flows away, 
 Cherish for, is not written. 
 And if there needs its least be 
 The whole thing grown near with 
 The meaning that will say 
 Will that crack it on the heaven 
 From least the light itself which is pale. 
 Did there coast a river on its Pacific, 
 Without hiding by swarms of tree. 
 
 But show of this, 
 Here, above the nearest air 
 What fair women delight
