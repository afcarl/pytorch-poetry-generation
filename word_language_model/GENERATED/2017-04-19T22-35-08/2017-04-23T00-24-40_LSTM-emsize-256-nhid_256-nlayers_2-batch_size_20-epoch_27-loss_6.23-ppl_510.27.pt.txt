 And--with my house 
 Or my space 
 the día nest 
 I'm beautiful 
 
 I order to sing 
 the poem 
 
 "You can't start. 
 
 It’s a brick. 
 Surrounded in an bag of desperation 
 honey, I'm 5 veracity, 
 who asks me how your memory, 
 when Life is back, 
 by the strings of our copper. 
 the sundews, gleams, 
 the witness of secrets like 
 time beyond
