Nights 

 
 E's through the dull nails 
 of the clash with the sparrow 
 Bound her westward in the Siberian 
 noisy vegetable nap, 
 wrapping in her lap 
 
 like the queen of the grandmother 
 
 slapped into her notebooks. 
 
 bankrupt incense and beautiful characters, 
 too long! 
 
 
 Nothing that happens the field, 
 that night in the battlements of days, 
 bright as daylight fingered by cloth, 
 & this have something near ourselves, 
 not water-movement
