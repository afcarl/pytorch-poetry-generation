Que My Divorce. 

 
 
 
 
 
 One Day Where are Loves in threesâ€” 
 
 
 Fair hopes, unpleasant pen-scribbled o'er us; 
 As out of allayed, threats the vault 
 Shoots smelling of wit, and crews turn

 For yet those two divine 
 Will change the souls o' watching, 
 A single view, repuls'd, its task, 
 Our greedy
