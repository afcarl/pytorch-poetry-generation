I Know 

 I undress a handful 
 of one of all that's dead. 
 
 
 
 I ha' read the time to go up 
 and imagine terrible 
 truths which finds those 
 have lacking themselves 
 the meat of me 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sunny Day North 
 
 
 Is there only the silence of the world 
 With the odors of the sea of the young 
 
 The hulking we passed together in the dark 
 And sliding from
