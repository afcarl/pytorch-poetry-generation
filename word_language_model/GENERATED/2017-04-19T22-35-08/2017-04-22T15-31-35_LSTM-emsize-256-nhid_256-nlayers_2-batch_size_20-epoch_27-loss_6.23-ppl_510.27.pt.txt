 
 Here looking them straight 
 With music another window 
 With a drum at his step, 
 pebbled, killed by cold. 
 
 Yes, it comes from town. 
 When I am more toes 
 Than from the rain 
 He asked, robbed or silent. 
 For a bottle of cloud burns cold. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Double Garden 
 
 
 So war of love, and yet no such things, 
 The cavernous joys, the public thought, 
 The running spell obtains.
