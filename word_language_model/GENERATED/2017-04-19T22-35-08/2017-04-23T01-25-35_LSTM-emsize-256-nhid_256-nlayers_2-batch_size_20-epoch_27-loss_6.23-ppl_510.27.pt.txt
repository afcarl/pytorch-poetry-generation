Way Lynch, 

 The pains they know hear Christ? 
 Here it is hard as the sea 
 Hangs to my song and my brackish hand 
 cutting off the border, Strobe side. 
 I run to a little frenzy wrong in stern, 
 a woman's voice back in under the window, 
 moonlight strewn with cake the lights of the knife. 
 Be not as child based up one side near the house beside the eschar 
 or insoluble girdle beneath the tree darkening the way or
