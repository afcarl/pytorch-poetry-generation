Given, 

 Iâ€™m reading her cleverness 
 And look like little marriage, here's a terrific 
 crab one afternoon, [1748] butter 
 
 transcribe living in the branches of the tide for 
 How movement held you too long inch apart. 
 You have to turn, you trouble you as well 
 As begin to know 
 Something and death 
 
 If I were having that strange her--princess, 
 Because your father is braver than the arms 
 Of the instinct of guile and fallen novel
