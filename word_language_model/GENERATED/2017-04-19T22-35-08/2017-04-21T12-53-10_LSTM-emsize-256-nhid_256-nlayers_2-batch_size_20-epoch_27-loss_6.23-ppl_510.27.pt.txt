Boasting 

 Heavy and young are wide with fire; 
 The adultery, lifts the hooks that tear 
 
 The moon, as merry as an ape. 
 The plants down the little town 
 And the land lies o'er, life's is desperate 
 And I've never been there 
 But it Cut the scalp 
 
 Of how once so showrd 
 In Lawrence shadow rich or 
 
 And uneasy by the magazine, 
 In riot or in a language 
 For the fixed untrammeled hall
