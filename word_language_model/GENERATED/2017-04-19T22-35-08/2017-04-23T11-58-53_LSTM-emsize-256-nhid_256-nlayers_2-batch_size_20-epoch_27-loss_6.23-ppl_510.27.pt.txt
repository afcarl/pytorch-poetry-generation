I Sat 

 While none went out from 
 The garden until I could. 
 The radio drew down to lift me back down 
 From the center sky I fell off 
 In the middle of my ten 
 It was bar'd: and never was there 
 For his Civility of whiteness, 
 But God's guilt would be 
 For the sound of all who was carried on a spinal wire 
 Of fine, and the heart of violets and bone 
 Had never been gathered in
