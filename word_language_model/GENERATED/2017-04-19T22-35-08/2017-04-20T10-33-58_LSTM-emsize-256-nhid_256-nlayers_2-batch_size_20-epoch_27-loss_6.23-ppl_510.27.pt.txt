Fades 

 And for the object, and I am born. 
 
 O troubled me, I permit my throbbing allotted: 
 illiteracy, like is yon blushed--"are named 
 Into the mist you married lay. 
 O Heaven-born city of earth's steps, You sit on the waist 
 And take at your husband's touch all day. 
 An octave counterfeit. 
 
 You lie there watching two silent objects 
 Of sparrows, even born to leave the orange 
 And feel wrong that will be a form of fun,
