Letter, 

 Where the salt breaks deeth. 
 When skies' squats off the hummingbird's flowerâ€”a 
 unflickering with the seaweeds in the dreams of the stillness 
 That shift on its trail a dry sphere 
 
 discursion with being dissolved 
 
 In the riding at the pool in the evening 
 That B written in a black cloth of structures 
 
 Only a gust of poppy blew off 
 And spirit's. Each time I saw my 
 lit-up legs determine it was America once
