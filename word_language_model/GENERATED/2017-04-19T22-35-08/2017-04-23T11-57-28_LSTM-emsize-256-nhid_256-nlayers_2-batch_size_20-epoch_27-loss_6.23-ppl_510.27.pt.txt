Nodding 

 Frozen in the ocean, till the 20th throws 
 The Mattocks of a clump from a low log, the centre 
 Of a seal crop. Small remembers 
 The technical heavens; 
 Too human, lettuce, boldly wing, consort's 
 Shakespeare and death with, love, forever and death, 
 oh give America in words and only till I feel 
 Always the dumb bond of the world.' 
 
 Here is a street or a guitar. No, here is a bathrobe 
 Who realizes what lies me
