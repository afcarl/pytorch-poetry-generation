 Is it's hard to spare, 
 Unless that things have left, 
 Let them not rise nor beg their Gate; 
 And the Dean since God in a nursery, 
 Who, a proud, or a weak? 
 Then could it be so true so far, 
 And the realm hearkened in the total shoot; 
 Yet when they stand by side.

 Yet in the bitter spring-tide my 
 verge of summer that when you meets 
 And
