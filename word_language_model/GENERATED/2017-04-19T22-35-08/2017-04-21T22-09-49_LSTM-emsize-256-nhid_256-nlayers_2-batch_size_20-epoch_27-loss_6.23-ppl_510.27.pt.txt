 tonight, drunken; 
 pays only to Shem, 
 Society is this: 
 
 the old world 
 
 is the source 
 of the words. 
 
 
 Have you make. 
 
 
 
 The force of rotten bear 
 sweeten its odd-pinnate, 
 A precise crab fly, 
 A shifty heart for itself 
 Came in nightlong, Night, 
 flood-tide? an ageless treatment 
 In impressions; Christmas awareness, 
 Underneath the horse's hair. 
 
 
 
 Below the purple roses, 
 twigs of rain
