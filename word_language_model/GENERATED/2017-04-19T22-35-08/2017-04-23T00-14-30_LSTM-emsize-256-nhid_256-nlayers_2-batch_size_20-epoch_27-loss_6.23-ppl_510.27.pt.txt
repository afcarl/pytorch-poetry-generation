After Trees 

 Uncertain and shone, and should at lunchtime 
 And conscience used colder, light to conclusions 
 Out of the darkness, I see where I go, all gone, 
 
 Remembering feeble-pointed madly bondslave 
 Through the endwise fields of green speche, 
 choke-mitts upon high spurs of Shamash 
 The winter girls god help in the sea, 
 In their coats in the field and brow of fire. 
 Weighs away, with love-knot of time and heart come out, 
 The invention of life now
