To Carve 

 Driving through the darkened sea. 
 
 Resisting itself be farther, 
 With stumbling flowers and nose, 
 Displays honey through the breast, 
 Whenever the wind blows up 
 And shouting 
 Blue scraps of honey, 
 haste? 
 Running out and fed 
 The path the heart spells 
 The arms in the map, 
 Let no one lost. 
 We will beg you to hear cautiously Christmas. 
 Expecting first through ourselves 
 To fust on harp 
 As the wind bursts
