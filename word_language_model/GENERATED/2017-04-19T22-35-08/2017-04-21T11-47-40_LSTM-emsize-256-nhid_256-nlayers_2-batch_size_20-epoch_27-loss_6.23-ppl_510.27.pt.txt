Often Scentless, 

 Or everybody expected to shave on the bonds, 
 
 If friendship should leave the noise of the sun as fish. 
 The corpse would be filled with fruit or new? 
 
 Having afraid remembrance of heart of desire 
 To keep peace with what we dare them. 
 Is it so, O male California, 
 Coming back. 
 
 Find me no certain age greater than the ace of birth, oar, praise to the men, 
 So my heart never crosses the open
