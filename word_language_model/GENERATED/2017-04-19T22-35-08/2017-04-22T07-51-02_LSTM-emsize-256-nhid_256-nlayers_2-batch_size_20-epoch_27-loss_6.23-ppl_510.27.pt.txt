Sin, 

 Never to die in that word. 
 
 Love became with my shame. 
 I have laid over the bars 
 And dance upon my heights. 
 
 Over the river, 
 I made me laugh 
 Even beyond making sense of summer. 
 Varsity dreams,

 Of a long line 
 That's a water I too. 
 Stockings, love is potato 
 To all Extract 
 Because all rational things have replaced 
 The earth like storm marks 
 With
