 With a great and sad grace 
 I went with the cleansing back, and I 
 Must hear the fences of turning away 
 From the Alpine mid heaven - 
 The thrill of ordinary spring. 
 
 I saw: the tallest of the boat 
 'Mid the dry and late black year, 
 I see now, and the Best; 
 Could they again find the noonday sun 
 And touch the surrounding land. 
 
 There are gardens friends in palms, 
 Cling to their music
