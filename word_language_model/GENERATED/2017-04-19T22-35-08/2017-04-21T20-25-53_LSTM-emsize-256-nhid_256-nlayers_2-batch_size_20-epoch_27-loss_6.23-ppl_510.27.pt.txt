 Low rooted in its own moorings home 
 To the top and morning, a white and small music or though-- 
 More piles. with friendship is scared and no more

 May keep them, there others may not be brighter inexactitude. 
 Some shall forget their Zeilein) nothing lest it 
 Might a world to be unwrought to light, 
 Light again to the cushions searching
