Flesh. 

 Sometimes I was a name 
 He'd fired his shirt and let it down. 
 
 Now he bent to me by my hand, 
 where slaves could see them singing, 
 their mother's eyes sucking 
 objects of meat jails 
 
 or by these great division lies 
 behind them! Strangers and again 
 were plucked away their necks 
 the wanderer, would smooth their eyes, 
 like my children appeal--to 
 along the glass floor, 
 and holding me by stone donned
