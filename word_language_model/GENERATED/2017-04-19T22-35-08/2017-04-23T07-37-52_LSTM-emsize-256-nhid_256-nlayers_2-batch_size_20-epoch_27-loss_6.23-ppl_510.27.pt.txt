At Home 

 dedicators, 
 townspeople! 
 
 The stalk at the town returned. 
 It stands as if false sound, 
 The third face, the parade 
 Beyond black snow. 
 
 Ring out the body's footsteps 
 Moses has seen its cyclopic hands 
 Locked in saffron streets, 
 Coral watches of the scene! 
 
 No; certain for the abstract century 
 Not as a sperm tree. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Prodigal, 
 
 
 I shall scream up this tune. 
 treacly
