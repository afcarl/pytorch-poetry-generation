Tradition Movement Away 

 The frail and fresh, that was limbic 
 
 And rolled my throbbing bones to green-rooted 
 into the days-- Sich 
 slovenly, rend your tides 
 
 See what you supposed, and newly old. 
 amiss; find me what comfort was done 
 Everyone else will happen to your senses, 
 You eyes like real sleep of fissures 
 recall their cells. Even now. 
 
 But I'm sorry at the door.
