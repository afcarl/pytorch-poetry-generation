All Night The Victor Hour 

 And saw a bee desire at dawn 
 
 Through all the world within it. 
 
 
 
 Dark old duties made the shining curtain 
 wills: in the water, jellies and rhyme 
 And never let up death that were early-to-bedth 
 By a fair melody she dwells and knew. 
 With a gauze dovelike ladled across 
 An ivory sole pregnancy, others, couldn't do, 
 With no step by raccoon's sea-air 
 And doing! and soaring with hopes;
