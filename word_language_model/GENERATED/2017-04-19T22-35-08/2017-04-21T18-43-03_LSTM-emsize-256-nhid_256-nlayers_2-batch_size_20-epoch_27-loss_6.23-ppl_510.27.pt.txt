Boy'S, 

 With their white faces all that make! 
 A brave who hiding by a lot 
 
 salted the pronghorn 
 gamut, what, lapped. 
 Finely pre-replicated indecision 
 mostly commemorative edge 
 Church or acne, gold, 
 
 Transmitted water stand drums 
 
 Their dresses oragne 
 
 unpolished, 
 The sea circles like 
 
 drops out like yoga fastidious 
 
 and long cull like one 
 Prepares to be icy, here 
 
 into the memory of 
 
 free things
