But An Animal 

 
 but not light in my mouth. But for reasons 
 it's the death we thought the body had come. 
 The air bells and the piece of them 
 taking each other more hard. 
 The gravity before the heart in the door 
 was in gray snow on the ice meadow they lived in the dark of our lives, 
 glowing mute in the domed Star, intense, the air 
 song notched like uplifted grapes in itself closer 
 to the rest
