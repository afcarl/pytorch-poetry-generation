 This is the landscape's black seaâ€” 
 love-lore or is there no person, no hinge trust. 
 Three times and this morning I have stood them, 
 The days are stirring, 
 I go on the tow-headed feathered lot of them, 
 Hoping to go interlacing I'll find some new event 
 hanging's half the dimm'd, true verses of the son of balm or 'thine'; 
 next-to-last, of parts, which was certain. 
 It was thick-stalked, and divine
