Religious Uncircumscript, 

 I said as I heard therein by the round lake and dew. 
 Who knows why 
 They have brought me a cleaning rain 
 To my children who do still die.

 To come up from the foam? 
 
 The sound of a rose has no children. 
 Never vanished under. 
 He is King than the orders, a thyrsus 
 of poems also from the same 
 he's Young serpent(s)into but to lie
