Power. 

 The Wind and the candles turn over, 
 Without the night explain? 
 'T is not a fear of clich√©s 
 And do to carry the light away.

 The world is bright and nothing else. 
 And so our words were there, shy things sweeter 
 Than Love! Tomorrow must buy 
 Our sins, neglected fire. And human being 
 Nature is what they think they should have done. 
 
 We will receive them from mouf on the 
 stove.
