Rejoice One Night 

 As the man who charts through the ground, 
 Until the wind found it. 
 
 For the house that sings 
 It is that far away. 
 
 Kind I see the grass 
 Of the earth's knowledge in the service 
 Of dying, but the lips 
 Of cold winds in the shade. 
 
 
 
 In Santa Country 
 The sallied bar 
 Making in hail-stones 
 The green of the curving littering 
 creation, I could have lived
