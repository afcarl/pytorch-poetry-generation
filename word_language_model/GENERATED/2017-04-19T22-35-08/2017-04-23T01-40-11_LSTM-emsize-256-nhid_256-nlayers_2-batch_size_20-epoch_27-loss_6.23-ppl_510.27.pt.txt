Of The Sky 

 stands in open corner 
 of a slim fairway broom, 
 a moving sound over the sound of its stars. 
 
 In the grip of the sea) we feel gone up. 
 It seems a breath of request 
 in the wake float open 
 to hold every silence. 
 We builds, inexplicably rank and elves 
 about Bolivia and free 
 one's tail on Wantond she has cared grief 
 but will transcend a metaphor for means 
 that nothing are but
