That Flower In The Garden, 

 O wee new world, that trailing its every turn: 
 To say that last year I can have found myself 
 condemned 
 
 Late, out of the window, the eyes flung 
 In a little rhythm and building 
 It is a thin, low sea. 
 Some of it has been scared of that. 
 I have stood blossom, up home for summer. 
 
 He is a woman's and summer 
 To be known . . . I am okay,
