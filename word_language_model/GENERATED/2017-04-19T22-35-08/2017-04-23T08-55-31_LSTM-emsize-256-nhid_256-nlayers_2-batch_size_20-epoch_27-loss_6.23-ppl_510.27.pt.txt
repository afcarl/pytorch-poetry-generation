 The white sheep that lie down bright roads. 
 
 I think like this, an honest peace 
 In the earthquake gloom to heaven. 
 
 You hear the ocean shop, 
 The singer strap on St. alder rocks, 
 Where trees and wars are night. 
 There are three women, those that shoal 
 When tigers are Imitating to heaven's contingencies, 
 The music that has floated wide, 
 And her web is running home about, 
 All the sacked makes stream and the hairâ€”
