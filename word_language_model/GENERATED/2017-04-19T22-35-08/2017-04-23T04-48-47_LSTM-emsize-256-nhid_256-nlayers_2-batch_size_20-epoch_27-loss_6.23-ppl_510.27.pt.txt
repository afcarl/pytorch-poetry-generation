Above Him 

 Until it was real and touched, 
 When it said he took a bed, 
 Yes, he lay it made, and there looked dear 
 Till chains flew with them. 
 Then one side knotted on the ground 
 Beloved outdid the gestures 
 She had not heard of us birthplace: 
 But let the woes began. 
 We cut above, in hand, as though we knew 
 We prayed the fluttering & dumb ulu 
 When they woke, and moan.
