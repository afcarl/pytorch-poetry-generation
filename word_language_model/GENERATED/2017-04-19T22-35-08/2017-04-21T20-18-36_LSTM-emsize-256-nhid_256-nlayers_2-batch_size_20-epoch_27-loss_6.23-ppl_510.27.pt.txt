The Girl 

 Knows how the objects get a frail birth 
 Love withdraws and lurches to early-laurelled 
 A salt for half something bitter 
 As if waiting for his splintered journal 
 From his long pure grief opens out a post, 
 And throat's in each America! 
 
 Alas, it's in the guise of life, 
 Since our days less clear sea narrows in air, 
 Or where a shadow was closer by the sun 
 Who [19] 
 Can't touch two mule of choice
