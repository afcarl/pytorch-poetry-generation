 
 Over our Sierras itself there was 
 A patrol full-hearted Poetry there were 
 A place I'd accept the world 
 Would blindly yet as sowkand, 
 A record of deep snake. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Little Poems 
 
 
 Don't forget how it strange. 
 gatherers so die too blind for me! 
 It wants to be colored and flings 
 So that they should have shut their fruit. 
 What strange things should tell you? 
 The protea of You.
