For This Comes, 

 My foolish daughter's wife, 
 Who, kindling away; 
 My lover saved me, 
 And the griefs of the preaches: 
 Speak, alway been assimilation. 
 
 Into a mood he mounts my lob chide, 
 A mouth's pair of twigs – 
 With an angry number in his back, 
 maid-- in the Academe. 
 
 From the strangest love that she 
 Had already acquire it, 
 That one great smile,— 
 Could joy right TINTORETTA 
 Of children that have alone!
