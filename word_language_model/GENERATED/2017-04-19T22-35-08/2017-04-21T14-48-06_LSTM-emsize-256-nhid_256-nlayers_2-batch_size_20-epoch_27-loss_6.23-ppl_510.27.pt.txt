. . . This Is That Heaven In The Evening, 

 alone, and that huge blue leaf, 
 you have always built many a new story: 
 you think I would weep on my kidney 
 so that you are a small light's like squirmed 
 by a dry sky, burnt where lightning quilts 
 melodramatic-- 
 in ocean. Pervert you can see the guy, 
 this Diurnal brilliance swims 
 self made new sick, before in bed, doors drop 
 that pave persuasively. in conversations.
