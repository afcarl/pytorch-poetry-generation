 And the garden light blew open by the river, 
 vines: flow'rs, and fuel a spiral of urban light. 
 
 She heeded her, and you held, 
 God that he was chewing everything 
 To adorn the invisible water, growing 
 And so i might not care to trace his hat now, 
 But sends him to his exasperated youth! 
 The dog sat careless on my head, 
 And though I knew I took down a dream, 
 And changed my attention. . . .
