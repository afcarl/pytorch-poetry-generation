As A Beast 

 Which rises and thrust it back from us 
 But since she would kiss flesh catch 
 The plays spirit, making depth rise. 
 
 tuning. 
 Art is the blossom and rings 
 Until mutant song is rope, 
 There will be a space of love or shame, 
 Give man to the people, 
 Who must say did it come . . . 
 He finds somewhere in death's arms, 
 creating for a duty, 
 That life is cold and dead,
