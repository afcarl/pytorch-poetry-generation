 It was the garden of fanfares 
 Across the darksome river dead 
 It lived, I hold its single shroud. 
 
 And then the wind still lived, and the sky 
 scans the pale, flying sparks 
 That swells the hearts on high; 
 The picture of the leaf is part, 
 The children become golden stars 
 For some dead things. 
 
 And mute, moon, sun, lean and Sachs, 
 The slowly sun and moaning wind: 
 The mountain light is dry, 
 And
