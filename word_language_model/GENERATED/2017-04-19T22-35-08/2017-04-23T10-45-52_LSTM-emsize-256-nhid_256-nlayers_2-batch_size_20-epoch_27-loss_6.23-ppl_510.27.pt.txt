Stone Night 

 Are bright and sere, 
 And leaves stood, and when among the crimson wind 
 Their brown legs come out of the sphere, 
 their silver, sounds all faces, single north 
 And faint strips of them in the bushes 
 And like a wild old house, 
 And twilight elevators nip 
 By the azure and green grass and pines. 
 And there is a pair of oars, just whispering 
 All the complete pulses of the rotting sun 
 Against the place of
