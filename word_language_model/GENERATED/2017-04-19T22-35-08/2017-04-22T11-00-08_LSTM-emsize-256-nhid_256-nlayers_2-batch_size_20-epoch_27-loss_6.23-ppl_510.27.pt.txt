Laggard Beauty, Name) 

 
 
 
 Dear Son of birds, loved! ancient South, 
 Heart like converse, the tale of rain, 
 The air, a box, a wat enter every rack, 
 A Pussy a fever give to that, and an hour! 
 No sight: I beg to breathe nor frown, 
 But watch him down-trodden scent. 
 
 As thro' the brackish gates fell sudden cypresses 
 And listens through the pools of neglect, 
 Seeing the lingering feast of tins, and fucks 
 Each line
