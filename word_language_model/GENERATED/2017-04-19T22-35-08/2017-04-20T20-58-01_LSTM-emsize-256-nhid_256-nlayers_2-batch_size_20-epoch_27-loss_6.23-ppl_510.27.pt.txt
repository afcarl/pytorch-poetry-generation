 The long man will awake again 
 at rest like a fine switching-signals 
 a door in a hazy wallet in a tree 
 
 and a lovelight raising a hat off the red 
 couch. The head flow like a child's neck. Diaghilev 
 who echoes this cabinet 
 that tells him 
 a lion Still--shall he counted 
 a pane of battered light.
