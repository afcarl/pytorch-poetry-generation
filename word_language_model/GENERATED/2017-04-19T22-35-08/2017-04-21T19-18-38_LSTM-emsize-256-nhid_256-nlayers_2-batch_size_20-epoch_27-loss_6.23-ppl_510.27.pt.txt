Wonder 

 
 Singing and Turret on Earth and dreams, 
 
 I must die and wish 
 All me like is sleeping, having always loved me 
 
 Something now, just time? Under and out of focus 
 Some can love watching when I shall blaze by 
 him, where I Gentile, I know 
 How a glove traversed my head 
 
 I do see easily middle on you 
 The road road, New old faces between, 
 They all inside stars by the Night
