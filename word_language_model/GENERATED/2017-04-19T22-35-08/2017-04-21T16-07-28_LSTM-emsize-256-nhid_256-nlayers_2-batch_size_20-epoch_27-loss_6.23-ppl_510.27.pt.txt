 With the echoes it revolution, 
 The sun is watching a steady flame 
 Like a veil of Accompanist roses 
 As summer and snow, 
 much as our teachers stand arrogant, 
 Deer lure the long standing on the table. 
 Then it is quiet to strike with the surface. 
 A song of sin, Perhaps this screen of earth: 
 appears aloof and there shall draw 
 the loveliest day. The diesel copies 
 Have nothing
