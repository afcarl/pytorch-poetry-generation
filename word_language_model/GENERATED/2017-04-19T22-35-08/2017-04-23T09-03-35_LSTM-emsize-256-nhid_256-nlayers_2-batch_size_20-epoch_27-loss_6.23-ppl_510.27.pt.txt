Abstained 

 The back chambers folly,-- 
 The soul that knows not once was free. 
 
 slashes of Life: guiding and Volumes 
 In memory's rill something slowly swept 
 The broad corners, and green broke, 
 And stiff with wrath and outrage for death, 
 They (they lie with rapturous anguish, 
 In the long mill, the torrent saddens 
 
 As it eats through the smothering strife, 
 Throwing seeds, and the tramp of sand, 
 A mist on turf that follows as it grew,
