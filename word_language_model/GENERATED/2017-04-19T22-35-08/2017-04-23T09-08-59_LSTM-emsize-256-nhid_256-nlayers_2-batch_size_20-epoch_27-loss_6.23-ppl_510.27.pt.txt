Here Under The Jealous 

 sweet women, 
 The sun and the moon 
 hens; the dark, 
 Tell one. Let me dream anymore. 
 If you've begun to know 
 The hammock's boring 
 In hell agrees by nothing else 
 Now not even forgotten. 
 I'd give money a prize, 
 That all men have a time of summer 
 To go down 
 For fear of Georgia tuned and screams, 
 Two dolls or more townish 
 Black spirits, and old deaths 
 Who can
