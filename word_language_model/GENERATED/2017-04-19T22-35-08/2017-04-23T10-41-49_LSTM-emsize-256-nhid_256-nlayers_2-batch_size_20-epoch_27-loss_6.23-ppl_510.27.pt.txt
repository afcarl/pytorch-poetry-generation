Small Mind Fills, 

 And vow'd the last night light kill'd 
 The sun, the ice and air of beach Footnote 
 Under its peak the desert blooms weathering 
 Over the still sea of the river, 
 And the broad oranges that flicker weeping 
 toward the belt and roots. We have kissed 
 the children most animals find us 
 were carried in your crooked stasis 
 
 an oversize tongue sprung against 
 the wheel until its body touched each 
 
 a lesser dutifully,
