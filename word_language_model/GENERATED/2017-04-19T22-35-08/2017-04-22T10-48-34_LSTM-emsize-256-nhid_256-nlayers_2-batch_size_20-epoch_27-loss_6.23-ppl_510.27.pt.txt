 a. then you never wait upon 
 the point of children 
 with you, 
 
 grey and long, uncertain without thoughtful, Koreans 
 
 Take perennial things adrift like plastic rockets 
 With the weight of green fingers that can contain

 To create Jerusalem, won by my warfare 
 The bare white gloves of the earliest waters 
 And singing like a winter winter white 
 In to bat that belated khaki
