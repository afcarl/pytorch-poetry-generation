To The Sky. 

 
 There is a shining face of pale hut in his hand 
 Toward far off looking at that inevitable storm 
 As a boy pulls out for two days 
 A God, where Christ sat, will grow on to amaze 
 Some faint complete fork telling us dead. 
 
 High beneath life, crowned with amber & thatch and brown, 
 Brown and ebony, her glowing thumb, her long response. 
 Returning from the beach, on the head, 
 King hurry together through
