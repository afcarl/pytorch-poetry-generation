 This I think of a stick 
 beat-up burning at her smelling 
 Asking ardour. O foolish music, 
 searchest away from careful heaven

 Turn 3 lots of misshapen sheaves 
 got--a from shore to patch, 
 Another on them! Your maker is beyond my 
 heels, the air, broken stream of examining the cockfight 
 
 Is your child salesman. I stand in my washbowl,
