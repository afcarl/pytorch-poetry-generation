Hands That Can Eat, 

 Which might have to prepare late enough to see, 
 
 How the land like running plants, the dust 
 Grow high with life. 
 It has not happened here returne: 
 And when one day I look too fat 
 I think I will end of the earth with you, 
 Then trimmed with my fires, and look into a stone, 
 I'll meet you there in the air of hollow roses 
 Revelations in the moonlight the spring-coloured name?
