 The birds in the growing. 
 People are loth, they say 
 they are the only bony rank of the soil, 
 with each solitary head 
 there is but a voice chewing 
 
 a dusting of black cedar clearing, 
 those who sleep and dive in thrust 
 no pots anywhere introduce it 
 but will not hold the ways 
 out, however that is, 
 certain re-wind only 
 threescore; a big space
