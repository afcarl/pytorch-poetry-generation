Old Summits Bloomed 

 Through flowering streets, and burn wide awake, 
 As an earthworm grey in his eclipse, 
 Some Kubla hawk hav him this rain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The cheese/wrap Drive to Milton 
 
 
 Women are always made. 
 I want no brightness from the newspaper 
 A cypress blue-banded on his ebon 
 shoulder, I'm pouring 
 A painting. 
 
 This tree is terrible, a world that Natural god 
 The garland to the mind.
