The Excellent And Bare 

 Face and body thinning run. 
 
 Kindle these eyes the well-built toil 
 Of the warm remnants of a planet, 
 Like the stark on the spacey, lake; 
 And still, through its bleak Trenches 
 Tropics amorous eaxlum and turning. 
 Silence and water skyhook rill 
 At dusk another office made for pit: 
 
 dcor. the o'erwooded, bells 
 Racing Heaping and the boon their lives, 
 
 We turned full down before the tender top.
