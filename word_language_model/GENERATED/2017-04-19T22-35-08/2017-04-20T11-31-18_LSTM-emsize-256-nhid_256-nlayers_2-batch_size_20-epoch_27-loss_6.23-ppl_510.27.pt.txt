Huger 

 Between the bitter burden of the moonlight; 
 And now they press her horse in hue, 
 Until the pretty glare, the clear Doom 
 The beast of paradise. The beams and higher sweeter 
 sister? The brother and the Angels drunk, 
 Who lifted, all the thousand tropic pounds, 
 After a dream of which he writ on fire. 
 
 
 
 mooring, 
 tenon, pisses 
 Like a hand quite afraid; 
 
 Long still. 
 
 But why 
 taxes.
