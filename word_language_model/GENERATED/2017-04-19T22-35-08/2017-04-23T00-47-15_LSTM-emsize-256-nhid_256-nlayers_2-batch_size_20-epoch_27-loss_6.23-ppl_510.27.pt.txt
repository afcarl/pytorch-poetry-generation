 Eolian every color of lung in mass 
 First breasts sparred by the world 
 What's late about drown. 
 
 I held myself in a bowl 
 
 Tender to any burnt day, the short 
 
 Hit peace as it makes time for a moment 
 So plain pass all night 
 And remained by less piddling 
 Than too bitter and andor poetry 
 Were Franco bright 
 A vein to be it!) at, 
 But one light hangman's eye 
 Requires us off
