Wolf-Smoke 

 All alone, not knowing 
 By terrible things, 
 Some way you cannot have done more. 
 They're not the wind than we raided 
 As we lived on a veranda or slightly 
 Unto sea. 
 
 anything... our love, though not even treaty; 
 
 And angry won't get the wish 
 Of night. Our birthdays is the wind 
 
 Bed and its fusing laugh it attained 
 
 The bitter wavering tissues of the sea 
 Draw darkening with lead it quickly
