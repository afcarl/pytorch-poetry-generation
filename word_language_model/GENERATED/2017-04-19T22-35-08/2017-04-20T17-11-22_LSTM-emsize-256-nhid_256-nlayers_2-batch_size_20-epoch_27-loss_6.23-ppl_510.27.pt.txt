And Tails 

 Out its inner ear, an apple, closed, 
 and on this was nothing like my play, 
 I could pretend it was cinquefoil, 
 
 And I have not come back to look Tut-tut! 
 I knew all things who were mope 
 I could write them merely wrong? 
 I have taught forgetting to kill them 
 and keep back poems too full 
 to keep up them only, but I carry them down. 
 
 And my horse Danube sits on the grass
