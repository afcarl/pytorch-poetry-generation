Fitful Dance Cut Like A Fawn, 

 Nor a glory a Morn could spare. 
 Yet often turned a line from the heart, 
 Anxiety a diving down to inquire 
 Till a mist in the fog might reach 
 Its eyes upon once, as curl beneath 
 Or locked into itself, until it goes 
 Like a little ocean. 
 
 
 
 It used to quiet the window 
 and about a steady flame. 
 A stone is born. 
 It is the same 
 hems
