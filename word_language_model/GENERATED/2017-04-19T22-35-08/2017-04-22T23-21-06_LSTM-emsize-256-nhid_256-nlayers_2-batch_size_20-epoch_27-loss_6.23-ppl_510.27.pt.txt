And Organ Silences, 

 The song that when the Eagle dies, the East 
 Shall sweep, raindrop fashioned from its orchard hour, 
 A volcanic wave, with each sweet light embrace. 
 
 Is this the bar, the guiltless of the lays; 
 The despairing song, 'tis all too great to sunder 
 Watching the shepherd sky. Oh ring the hours 
 In some false language, kind of mute bold, 
 And expectation of the Sun. 
 
 The listening of Means are flesh, 
 The spreaded lives,
