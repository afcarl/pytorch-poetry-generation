The Parade Tunnel 

 Dragging the cemetery to swallow, 
 And he left the window to the cutting-in. 
 
 II 
 He is the guards rush of age 
 1945: horses. 
 (The wheels as they perch in heaven 
 Lifted on land!" Is: 
 His feet again, and then their own 
 Efface the glut, 
 Great-souled, lies picked up in a foam 
 Swung like a leash against 
 As shit on the bridge. 
 
 The jailer get to be pointless 
 To describe
