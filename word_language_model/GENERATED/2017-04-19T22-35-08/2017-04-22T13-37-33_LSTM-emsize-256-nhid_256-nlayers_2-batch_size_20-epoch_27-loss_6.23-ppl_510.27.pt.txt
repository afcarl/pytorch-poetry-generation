To Rest. 

 Still then, these seasons, and apples, far goes down. 
 Bright unspoken creed while I drink from me 
 The land is dressed beneath the sky, my mouth 
 May feel like you, behold the cunning horse 
 That lifts the bond to crown on me. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Trade tread Danbury Eye to Her Name which proved showre upon the dead by righteous Left on signs.
