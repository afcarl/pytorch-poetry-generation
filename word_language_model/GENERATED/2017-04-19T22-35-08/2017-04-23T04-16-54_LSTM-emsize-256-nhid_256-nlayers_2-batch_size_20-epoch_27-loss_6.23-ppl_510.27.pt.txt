Silhouetted Along The Bones. 

 
 bonavista Passions sweep the graced; 
 "Frost!" spelled the woman kind--while bongo you 
 Cold loving Titan, to the bed of his president 
 Where she abhorr'd about the next window 
 A good new world with Christmas of suspense. 
 
 Have cut her self-concerns, she survived. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lime 
 
 
 Where I meet you without silks 
 Through flat shelves sail and leaves, 
 Rippled, swish unseen, 
 Pleiads eat me by coyote's lily.
