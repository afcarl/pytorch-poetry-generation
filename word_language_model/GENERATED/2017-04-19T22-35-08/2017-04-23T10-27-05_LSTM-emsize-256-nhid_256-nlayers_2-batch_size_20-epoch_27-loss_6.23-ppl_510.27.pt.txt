 the steaming wool of my face 
 and the Ohio claw wall 
 of smaller ways on heads & knees 
 or the stiffness in the sidewalk 
 where the customary eye 
 puts on a wall 
 outward, vast ugly guns. 
 And the lady Rifled 
 almond-trees. and strength, 
 with half the others separateness; 
 A green berserks gleaming, 
 bugs. The dog sees life. 
 He runs, I come from school mirrors 
 the dazed tangled lines of grins. 
 
 Your arms
