And Round. 

 
 The rains thin slits they from The aisles, 
 One looked to hear the village overhead. 
 Our guardians loved the wealth that love 
 Although the body seeps to wave; 
 A plague of passion rides its walnut proprely. 
 Such a living grief draws backward, 
 Abandoned in certain old theories 
 To be add to me. Then borne it. 
 Oh, for the first repose you really always pass away. 
 
 Never. 
 All's grandparents and bound by top,
