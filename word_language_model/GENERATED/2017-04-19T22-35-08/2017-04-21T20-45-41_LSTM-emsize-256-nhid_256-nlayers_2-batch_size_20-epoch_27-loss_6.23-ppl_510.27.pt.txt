On A Ground To Dream 

 A little Noble dish. yes, it seems that is 
 A clear school. I would only be tired of 
 My poems, I write out only forever 
 In a space of love and prince.

 You're flashing and blessed me and I am prone with love. 
 Whether I would eat food so much I feel and bless it. 
 
 His limp shoes just now like blues --
