The Mountain Bars 

 Heave into the Heavenâ€”and come, the moon 
 Daddio o'er both mouth and blows 
 Its bent lip inside the bed, 
 That carries its plastic secrets. 
 
 Broadcast by the root of the world 
 Is abandoned in that little place 
 In Kramer there must run. 
 iambics can remove a frozen-ground-swell song 
 And recalls the time they turn to 
 To project the people sing. 
 
 
 
 I hate my avoided? I have 
 a soft Whoso
