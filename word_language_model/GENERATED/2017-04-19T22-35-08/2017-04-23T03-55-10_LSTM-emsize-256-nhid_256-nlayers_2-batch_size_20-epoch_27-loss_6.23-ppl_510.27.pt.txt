Hold My Love To Die: 

 I could not find where the saints have found it, 
 Would get lock!" where the point is beautiful? 
 If I rummaged in my mood, she's realized, 
 Ours! but **!star!**, . . . 
 The eye experience... 
 Fifty years ago laying out the door, 
 I touch them into twigs 
 By a living, and God that they can of fear 
 Shut me to the ground. 
 
 Please always Deciding waxen wells, 
 Groveling and gold--
