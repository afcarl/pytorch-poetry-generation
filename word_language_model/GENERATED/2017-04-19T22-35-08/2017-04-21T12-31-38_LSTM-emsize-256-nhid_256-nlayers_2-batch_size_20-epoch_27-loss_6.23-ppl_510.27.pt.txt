To Throw The Dice Fly 

 pulse-changing through me Sorrow under 
 road--they the chaste and Sweety embrace 
 Of a topaz, and the death of my sons 
 Were denied flowers in all the way at least, 
 The wind still knocked out, 
 Beyond the crash of clouds and quiet reason, 
 There is a terror in the infinite Spring. 
 And having just known to have a boarding known flamingo 
 Or a Unmask'd, believed at the seed of the rifle 
 Or a space
