Zoloft. 

 
 In practice everyone 
 enters on its strand 
 sometimes with step 
 like across the ocean 
 The whole past 
 
 coming from to birth to the source 
 of warm lumps of idea, 
 how a tiny horse of quartz sticks 
 raw: below his little face, 
 
 and kisses pitch raining 
 for dogs with sweat, 
 my mother left you" 
 played from senseless contact 
 and what obeys those you love 
 you've survived, too 
 
 always,
