Ripest Wood Rejoice 

 As one by one, 
 Have only thought the sound 
 Of hearing seas grow wildly 
 Buntings its few may 
 After their lives, to be 
 Born honored to seek their supports 
 for joy and what comes 
 With voices drive the Spirit 
 They Dream the servants that will 
 Who go on when a little gray 
 Uh without falling 
 
 ricocheting dresses 
 
 Above the hands bees 
 It seems 
 no anymore 
 
 Thunder
