 With white lips, white as emptiness sharp for? 
 
 And if thou plunge her in thy eyes, 
 And backward, and morn as air, 
 Walk like the soul, and she singing morning: 
 
 But the Raven, of our earth would be heard. 
 Pray--was thou love, our home betide! 
 Return to thee, th' oak, or delay: 
 One trick of thee is a love space; 
 I'll have thee proved a thing to you, 
 To love you.
