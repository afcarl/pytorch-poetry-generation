 That feeling of my flesh, where 
 Your angels Attila the almond blew, 
 
 What the eyes going here to me 
 
 Has more light, 
 Not from the faint sand 
 Within the life-giving heavens 
 Jackhammers do not such word as this; 
 
 And would not be hurt with sight, 
 I fairly know 
 
 Or any loving lands 
 Have stirred them all away. 
 
 
 unreal, 
 
 Whate'er it is possible 
 You heav'd justice and endure.
