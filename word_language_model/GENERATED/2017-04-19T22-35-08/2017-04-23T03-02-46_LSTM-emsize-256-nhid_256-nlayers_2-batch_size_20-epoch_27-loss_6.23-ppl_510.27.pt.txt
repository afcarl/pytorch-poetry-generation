Designes 

 In a thin meteor bunch 
 Of art men passing words-- 
 Amor Milkman. 
 These lost fragments of craftily 
 attachment, swarms by Humanity's spiral 
 Over the crag like the wound 
 Of a sleepy dagger in the beauty of snow 
 And slips at the sight of a glimpse of the tail, 
 Runs a safe bone and count campestrial 
 
 Lady stormie spurred at last FROM each. 
 
 Meg glide too sailboat to town. 
 The hangman knows it's not
