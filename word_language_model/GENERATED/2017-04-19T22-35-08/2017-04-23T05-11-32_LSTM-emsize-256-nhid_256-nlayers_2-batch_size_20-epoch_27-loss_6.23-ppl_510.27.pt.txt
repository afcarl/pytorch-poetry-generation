From Its Chalice To The Ceiling. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Astrophil and Stella Landscape 
 
 
 I'm weary of Wet, 
 deputies, the restaurants, September: melting; me 
 
 is idle; i Sweetly know: 
 
 So, people diverged as well as well 
 As Quivers suggesting when they came 
 
 And never hit my sinister race 
 At Woodstock unto the Night 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 My Wife 
 
 
 Black loves such a year is left
