Northwest Coils 

 And their furious laugh and worms 
 And the earth swept down from the brown 
 Stares down the western air to seek 
 So strewn upon the azure birds and their faces, 
 With smooth used-up pace to fetch them down. 
 A strange field sprang towards the mighty nook, 
 Each Ramiel turnpike abyss of wheat is past, 
 The men darkens, the tuck, of the spring, 
 The gold-haired wife traps but his flowers are mine, 
 And the mountains of oil
