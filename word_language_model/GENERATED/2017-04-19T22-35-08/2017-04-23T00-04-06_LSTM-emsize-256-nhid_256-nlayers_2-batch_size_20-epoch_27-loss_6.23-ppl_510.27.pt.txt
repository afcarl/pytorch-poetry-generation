Why Am I This Power That Looks 

 So desolate on my birth, 
 I love a sigh so weak, 
 For it so stand and sprouting 
 Each drop of me to hand, and makes me 
 praise the memory of the soul. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Children for The Night 
 
 
 I am not as old Iâ€™m loaded. 
 Oh, there was real congeal'd, 
 
 As a falcon 
 probing Going, apple.
