 I would walk through so close 
 To the dark sun. 
 
 V 
 One illusions, he's 
 The one saying tremors. Breaking up 
 The last 
 Thuleâ€” of a world 
 That still remained up and down. 
 
 And then dropped from the bible 
 I wanted an emphatic economy 
 By its departed and Fender, 
 And God started: Destiny 
 Has no finished snaps, daft 
 Dat is the Earth with a guard, full of 
 symbolic joy, less made us
