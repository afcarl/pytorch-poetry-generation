Either By Knowing How Evolution, 

 And he naked rings ache and goes away. 
 
 But I and the master asks for his own mate 
 It is different, it has clasp 
 For his day's courage 
 And Find the bleating from his breast 
 It is not absolutely got a quarter out? 
 
 I cannot enter every farther place 
 But I'll be right enough all the same, that youngest face 
 Than love in my wine nor depth of pain tale!
