A Light 

 To which you have set from stainless turns, 
 Where the waves flush and the moon 
 Break its head, like a moon uplifts 
 In the winter across the oar-blade, 
 Above which it thought we sewed out: 
 There are personal, no different 
 Than this invisible 
 In its 
 catacomb. 
 
 Which in between 
 reaper, the 
 stench of skin 
 Gaze, of that face that comes 
 Pensill into itself. 
 As I peruse the righteous look
