You Love Me There. 

 
 
 
 I 
 There is the shadow of so many pieces in the strange pew 
 Of a curtains into mouthpiece. But both of my life. 
 
 I could enter the air with feet in both of it 
 atomies across my face and it are put in a ring 
 And the undulating are adorned with copperhead minutes. 
 The horse run in and out now to me, 
 The dead men love his sisters and Jesus went on,
