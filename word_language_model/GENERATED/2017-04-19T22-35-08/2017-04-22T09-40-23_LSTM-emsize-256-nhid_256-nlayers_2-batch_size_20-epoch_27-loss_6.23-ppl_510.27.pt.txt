Of Food Out 

 nibble of waves, trying the cheese 
 almost warm as the first clouds that rode 
 in an evening between us, 
 the river suits for must fold 
 to a Throne, lifting up the nest, shivering 
 by the clean cliff Prides 
 
 and if an argument were left in the second time.

 They have heard the hosts a man with a connect. 
 Can they make him swallow take them sans the angel.
