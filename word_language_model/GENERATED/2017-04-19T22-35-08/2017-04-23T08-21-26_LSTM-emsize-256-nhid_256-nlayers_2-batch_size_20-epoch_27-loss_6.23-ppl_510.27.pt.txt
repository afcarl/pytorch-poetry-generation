Weeds That Never Cutâ€” 

 In the spring-time at every corner of the forgotten cooling 
 There's been tricks by a pond Daulis, that yellow river's blood 
 Seems at all. 
 
 Bearded, into the small sunrise rain 
 fades like a canvas mother' 
 Besiege the axis into the mind 
 As if it were a human life was drawn to eternity 
 And only what was become. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Balm in the Firmly 
 
 
 Fresh evening and the museum.
