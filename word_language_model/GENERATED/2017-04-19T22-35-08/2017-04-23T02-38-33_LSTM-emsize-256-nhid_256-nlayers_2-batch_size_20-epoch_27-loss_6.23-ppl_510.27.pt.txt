 Of night and thumb, and lived in a bed 
 Because fire-shotted, knew the air. 
 guises together in our sun 
 And rubbed the shore.

 Besides, 
 The Brought walls gone in the boat and the steam dies. 
 And seer of forty-five scrolls. 
 On the same room, ragged with the doves, 
 Seem'd love of the soul, and knew that long dark oblivion 
 To matter. Last day, at night we stand 
 Shave to the withered surface
