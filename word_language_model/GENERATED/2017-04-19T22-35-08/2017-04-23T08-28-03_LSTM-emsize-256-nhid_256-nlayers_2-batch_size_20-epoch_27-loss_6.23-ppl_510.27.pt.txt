 Oh good! 
 Though I drop the hill with a seal on the air, 
 Ah honey Christ, encounters, wrap us here again, 
 doubleness? O hands, time lay 
 And swinging my heart together for a death. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 If I Know Me 
 
 
 my dear nurse has a hard smile 
 of cloth, who says 
 the cat may sail all away 
 
 misrule, craving, 
 turn,â€”Why hidden, and forgot.
