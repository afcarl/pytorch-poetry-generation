To Find 

 A silent flow'r telling up & down. 
 There's no difference but we've got Mexican. 
 Pierced to the beauties of balls-- 
 But since it is as possible to haul in; 
 The ceiling refugie 
 War loved, helpless to clear the high land. 
 And electric, too, do anyone glimpse 
 Of that death they went to say as 
 The rabbit behind 
 A clean, like the ropes across a cloud, 
 He woke to see but strike him back again.
