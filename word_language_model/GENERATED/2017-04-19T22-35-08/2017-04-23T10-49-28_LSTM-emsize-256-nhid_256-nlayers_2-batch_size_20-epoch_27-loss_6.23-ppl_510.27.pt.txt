 
 My bed was lined with placid, whispering, 
 bowline drouth; 
 It misses often and not hunger! 
 You know there's somebody more riot 
 than something you are safe to the bishop, 
 and you lack the table. 
 The book is that--broken man's, boats, we 
 slid out into a portable souvenir jug 
 in our starched house, and lonely, watched by 
 high tales we groan. 
 
 Small witch wild-flower her sharp mediatrix, 
 As white as memory. Things turn away.
