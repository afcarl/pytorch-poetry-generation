"Hurry, Downdrifting 

 
 pausefully on a Requiescat 
 It comes to the eye of the world. 
 It stirs. No the wind there, the moon's sweet blocks, 
 
 when the sound was at all. 
 Feeling this. lashes: sure, 
 Thanks to sea and fire 
 
 Birds smoke hair against vegetables, water. 
 
 And it shines like fish made 
 by clay or trines 
 by concentration Heavenâ€” 
 
 our path. 
 We and knew the Falanga 
 of our bird." yell
