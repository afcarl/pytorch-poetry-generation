Lion'S Stone-- 

 And made the gap strung on the dry brightness. 
 These hills of light and field overflow 
 Their kings and fishes together, 
 Beyond the tall mountain, turns across the shore; 
 To the sweet field of parchment at their distant Lake, 
 And sweet inhabitants of ivy pause to be trouble. 
 
 Out of sudden growth in the great dusk they bar 
 Not clear has half Firmament: 
 Now they swirl then roll by their brains with which 
 They wander'd
