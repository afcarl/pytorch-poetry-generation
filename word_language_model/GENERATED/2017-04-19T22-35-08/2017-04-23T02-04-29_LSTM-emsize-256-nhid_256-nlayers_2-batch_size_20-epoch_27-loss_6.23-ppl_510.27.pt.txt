Course 

 So Drapers, is without sense, but a fool to bring 
 With a kiss, like the light that wakes the town, 
 When I shut my childhood. 
 
 The Spirit not yet of their young bonnie oldest store, 
 But the breeze is just sun-burning 
 Her dying look two times her ass like me, 
 Would I love you to me alive. 
 By then, hunger, breathes still quivering in endless light, 
 Listen: the fruit behind boulder the little leaves, 
 The garland
