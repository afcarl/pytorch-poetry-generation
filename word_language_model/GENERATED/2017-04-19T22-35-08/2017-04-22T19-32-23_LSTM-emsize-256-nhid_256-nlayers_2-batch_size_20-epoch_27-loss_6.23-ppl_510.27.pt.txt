To Their Hearts Be 

 Some one that is not swallowed on the same stranger's town 
 And then the sad burden of animals, 
 Nothing ever do build, but opening 
 Ask make love, love and remorse. 
 So, one hath done unto it, 
 Not all the miracle. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Little T. Yet Old Gilfillan . . I don't shmooze, 
 
 
 When I come the streets are buried, 
 Let thee speak for my friends to wrack, 
 Little elsewhere,
