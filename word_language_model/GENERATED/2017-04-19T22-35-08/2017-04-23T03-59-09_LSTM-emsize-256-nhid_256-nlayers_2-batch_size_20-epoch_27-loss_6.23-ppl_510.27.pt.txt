Like A Reflection In A Rain, 

 demi-rep, its face suckled on the sea; 
 Being made up from the sky it stands, 
 And shines in darkness till its season moan 
 There to our warnings in that strange sea. 
 It seems as if we could not answer thee 
 By the world's taint of what we may not see 
 But with the harmonies of us sleep, vain to their estates. 
 
 The reviveth; faces of talk and repose 
 Is strange to Prevention
