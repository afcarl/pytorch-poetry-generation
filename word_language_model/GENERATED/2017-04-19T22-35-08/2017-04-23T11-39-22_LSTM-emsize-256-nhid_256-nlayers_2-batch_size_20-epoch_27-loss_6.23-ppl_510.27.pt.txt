Down, 

 Night after day, that all that was just a storm I think. 
 
 The blood finally balanced, 
 The passage, the ward out shopping town 
 On the heavy bars. 
 
 Lured to where my mirror, and my running, 
 These raced away Cha'am. 
 I gave go looking at a massive wreath for the county's best 
 When it went. And it was there, to be not a wash 
 And so I could choose to read back to where I looked in.
