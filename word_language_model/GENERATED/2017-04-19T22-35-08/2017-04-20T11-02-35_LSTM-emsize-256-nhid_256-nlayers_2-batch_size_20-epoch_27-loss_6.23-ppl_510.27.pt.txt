 
 
 It is sliding by the columns. 
 The dove's no more quiet grows 
 from left the urban earth in the classic 
 exhilaration for years ago 
 in that game of clicks and dendrites 
 
 stripped beyond the coop and 
 
 flaring boiling shears from ancient space 
 
 and the light of Africa, marching 
 toward the neon Hotel, the flat kitchen. 
 
 The parade swaying 
 through the darkness, the phone on the rack, 
 the rivulet red rifles
