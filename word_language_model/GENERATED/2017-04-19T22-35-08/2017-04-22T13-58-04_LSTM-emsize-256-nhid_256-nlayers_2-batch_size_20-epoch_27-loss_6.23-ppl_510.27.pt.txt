Blue Elements. 

 
 Soldiers are worms and occupied; 
 In my nerve one room you trust, 
 Trying to peer out in the speeding cheek.

 It's stunned, diminished again by those fingers. 
 
 Some love in the body we do not make any rejoice 
 Through any homestead and for the world to be separated a 
 way.
