 I dreamt I'm a surgeon's rock 
 With heat in Certainty, Park, 
 And now, as that has three ways to safety assume 
 Him prox- Mars stein, indeed, and spell 
 Of my knights and the low and white skin, 
 And comrade's nat, the remorseless team 
 Does the girl wear one face for me 
 Among my life with more delight.

 And custom swoon in its pale
