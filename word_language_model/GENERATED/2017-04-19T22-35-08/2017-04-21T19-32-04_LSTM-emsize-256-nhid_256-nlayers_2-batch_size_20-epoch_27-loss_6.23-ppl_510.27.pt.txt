Whispered Numbers Just Counted, 

 And lies 
 The whole gray winter and the light 
 Of this happy office 
 After galauntyne I look 
 A choiring delirium 
 Begging the soul; 
 
 Fly the marvelous diminished life 
 Before it dies chains 
 Of country; in mine, a maiden, 
 "No, though I have been a long lass, 
 Yet 'tis that motley and bank 
 
 And may I seem to sleep when she sees you 
 
 Knees gently safely gives 
 Year
