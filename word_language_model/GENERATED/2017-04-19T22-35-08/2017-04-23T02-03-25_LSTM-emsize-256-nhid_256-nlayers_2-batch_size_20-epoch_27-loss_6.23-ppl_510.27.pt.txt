 To the Crying's of silence, 
 Slips through Desiray shoots, 
 
 Silence, you its golf. 
 
 canaries. 
 
 At this hour, in their minds 
 and hands, and to that 
 small structure of the old Mans unbidden 
 criminal cup trembles out hose, 
 its lighthouse, the demon strength, 
 which recalls our falling touch 
 so that those buildings dare 
 to be no satisfye 
 a gibbous fragment of dunes 
 and a featuresâ€” a sudden grace. 
 
 But weep
