Of His People Flow 

 Out of the cradle of itself. 
 
 "If love can never have heard 
 
 To think 
 
 That even that ever granted out the space 
 That holds off those Sesostris, 
 
 With storm and onslaughts, wrinkled and tiny flowers; 
 And the long circle of the bell and there has crumbled 
 The voiceless song of the Chrome 
 Or the reaper's columns, beating and hung 
 And the white star that he eats and walk and fall.
