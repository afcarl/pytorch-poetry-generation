Not Believe Of Him, 

 
 Enough for grey-- 
 
 No more would freedom, come alone to hear it. 
 
 There were moments that I mistake as long as possible. 
 
 
 
 Never at 4 a.m. but a shipwrecked waterfall. 
 
 Last August Beatrice gets a little new fish. 
 I conveyed stars from the West booth waves 
 spread out its dreaming pool until 
 
 the trucks are plainly, suddenly, 
 
 I'm having the meaningful meaning, I said, 
 shudder.
