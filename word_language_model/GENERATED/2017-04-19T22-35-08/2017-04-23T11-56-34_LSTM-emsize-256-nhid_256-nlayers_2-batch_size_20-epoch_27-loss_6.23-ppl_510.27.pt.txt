 
 To salvage what does it mean that we seem shed; 
 it is there any blossom from its windows 
 though the rains went on to sleep in a moment, 
 
 so we get known only a day, a far time 
 How miss that you were tied is still. 
 They fear you were the George's crying. 
 
 How shall I die in my waking grave. 
 So they'll walk back before me, 
 And I am long after that I am greatly
