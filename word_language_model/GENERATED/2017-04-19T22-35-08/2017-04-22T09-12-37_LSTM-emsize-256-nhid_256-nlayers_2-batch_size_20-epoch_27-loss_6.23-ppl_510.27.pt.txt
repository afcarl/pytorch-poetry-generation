Depositedâ€”Yet 

 A lying Sparowe, 
 With a heel of bright water seemed; 
 It moves to higher to-day, 
 
 Out of a picture. 
 On the right side of the cliff 
 I arrived away 
 The lamp 
 
 acquiescent, 
 priest; bob 
 
 In a neighborhood 
 
 Woman 
 
 
 an August 
 follow 
 
 secret crusher 
 
 a moon God-riddling 
 above and above 
 
 at windows 
 
 Mme. sleepily 
 weeping with a wing
