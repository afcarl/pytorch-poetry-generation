With Muscles Like Rocks 

 In a locked tower, mist and wing the water, 
 A gleaming can and Doubts it might be there. 
 
 She crooned her breast and curse her those red 
 Preferring and be at home a day of land. 
 
 
 
 Back into the cold 
 it appeared and it won't love 
 so far off advantage 
 she will put in the universe 
 the left tongue says she won't pay 
 for prey.
