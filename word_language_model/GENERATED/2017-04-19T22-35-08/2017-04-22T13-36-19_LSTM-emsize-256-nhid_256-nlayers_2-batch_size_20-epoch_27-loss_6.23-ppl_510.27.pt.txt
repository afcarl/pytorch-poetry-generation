Ground, 

 
 In the seven days the possibilities love. 
 We suffered one teacher for order 
 And stood not in the 2nd 
 
 When boats in a blue town 
 Blowing over the glimmers up 
 From the sunset threading salt, geldings, 
 
 And faint wonder as icy blooms 
 Are higher a heart which can no less 
 
 Than wars and lives along the century, 
 
 Or drop at hunger into the circling evening.
