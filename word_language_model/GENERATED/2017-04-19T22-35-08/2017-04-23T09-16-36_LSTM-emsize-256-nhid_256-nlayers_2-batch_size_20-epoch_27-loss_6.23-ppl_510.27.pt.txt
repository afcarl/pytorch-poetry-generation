 Prophet and cooled where your machine-gun carols 
 Turn arriving from scales. O hand and mouth, 
 gales! that late the hope and heart may be 
 That cast its abstraction, like nature's pale embrace 
 And keep and lived its women's nyght, 
 And all the mighty siege of time! 
 Like a bettre beauty from 
 Burned temples to the throne of World; 
 Will hear the inconstant hollo! 
 
 Love with a bullet is at foot
