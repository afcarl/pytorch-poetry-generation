And We Were Waiting With Them 

 
 The night we walked through you 
 worth a dead dress in the forest 
 The marble air tilts off. 
 prieth And the music's flew in, the 
 rapt lines, Ignatow on the side Morristown-- 
 
 Before you see.' 
 The house has no mouth that will be heard. 
 The water is (one night. 
 The promise of the racing dawn, 
 Where the trees who moil 
 Bearded children and fall. 
 Your housemaid dart in.
