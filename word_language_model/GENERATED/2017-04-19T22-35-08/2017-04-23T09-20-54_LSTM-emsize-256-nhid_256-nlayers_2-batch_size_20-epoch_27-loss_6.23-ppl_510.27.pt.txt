Or Mugged Them Or Never Less, 

 I am so different, there is a place where settle-down and disgusting 
 Stars are floating in the parterre, 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sunlight 
 
 
 I went my trunk to, I said to whatâ€™s the way 
 And I talk about longs in the world California 
 
 
 
 I have been stolen 
 forward to, my life out on hill, 
 Veiled as a bridge grow up and down there the hay uses a field,
