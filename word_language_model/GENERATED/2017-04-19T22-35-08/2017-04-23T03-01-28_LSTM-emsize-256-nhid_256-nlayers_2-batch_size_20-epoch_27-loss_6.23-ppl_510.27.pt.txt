Brown Sacks Of Memory, 

 The wrinkled flukes of shade where 
 She approach, hinting and bathes 
 The heart snapped back cool, up, 
 And all richest breasts of animals, 
 And one pressed leaf gave her to the hills. 
 She must sent trees toward morning 
 Faint she said sensual till it sees 
 In winter with its fingers filld 
 
 That Lion not in his face -- between 
 His trail in the far morning -- 
 I was angry.
