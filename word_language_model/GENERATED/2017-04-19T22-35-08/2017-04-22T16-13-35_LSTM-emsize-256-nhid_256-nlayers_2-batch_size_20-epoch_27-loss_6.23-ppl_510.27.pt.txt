Life Is End-Twists 

 Hell climax: 
 A song of no poet's "real-life" grace 
 
 As the dark note 
 we collect it, listen to the title of the Racine, 
 
 Might the girl suddenly count, 
 The pulse of this story crowd 
 Why her child if within the door released by the river, 
 Cities and bureau, her a small and varied obstacle 
 and tablets Rudolph sown 
 
 and slammed each night before our teachers prepare for us, 
 with the homesteads
