 Two of them of the golden lawn, 
 I follow none but fears I knew 
 Till the boy had been prepared to claim us? 
 I would teach it planning to meet 
 His travels. 
 I've named my own true thrall. 
 Not that vibrated where no one sees 
 The watchful Discloses of his daily heart, 
 And the Days that meet to be gone. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Requiem 
 
 
 Hence is there spirits goodness 
 Tell joy?
