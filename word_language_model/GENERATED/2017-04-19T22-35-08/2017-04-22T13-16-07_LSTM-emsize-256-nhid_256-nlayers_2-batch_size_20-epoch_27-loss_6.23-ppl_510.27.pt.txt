 he has no incomplete 
 and dealing at him, 
 with a thin finger and tar 
 and sooty; So aimed up, 
 
 when he at last coat fade, 
 "and his notes got up like the vine or swirling 
 Like thumb and stars, 
 list'nin' as a birdâ€™s sous-chef 
 
 He tried up the clouds. 
 His neighbor's good to me men 
 who could have but taken up the rafters 
 when he leapt around the bath.
