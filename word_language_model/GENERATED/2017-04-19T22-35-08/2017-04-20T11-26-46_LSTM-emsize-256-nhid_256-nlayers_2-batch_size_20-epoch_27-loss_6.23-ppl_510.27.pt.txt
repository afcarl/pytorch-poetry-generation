Till A Live One Holt, 

 And a thunderbolt will forgive, I'll wake an' go. 
 
 
 
 I remember those black ghosts that bled 
 from cook's warfare back to dust traveled, 
 viewing the bone heads of Paganini 
 and they said 
 Of the heart of the operating hill. 
 I bring myself to the bone. 
 What do you come from, is instead, 
 nodding on blouse, behind you over, neighbors 
 in the flooded glass of the sweaters that could 
 rip
