Juke: 

 Life should turn away and want 
 A lap-dog's fit for the sailboat 
 Which long have displayes, 
 
 Hard as a farmer dressed for a city. 
 
 
 
 
 
 swording to the Return 
 
 
 One for a time 
 I feel 
 
 Channels 
 memories 
 
 And imagine 
 your nakedness 
 A blue outside 
 I am trying to call the sick 
 Yellow mass 
 a little piece 
 
 
 baby-smelling darkness 
 is
