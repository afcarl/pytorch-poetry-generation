 
 A light mirrored a tawny step, a hole 
 unmove on the edge of his tower, 
 
 Then he grew up the second day; 
 Its Sewers, or synchronized" mousetraps. 
 He liked here as well. 
 The Moon was idling on the rise and freezing earth. 
 
 The poor beat of sand, his hands, the slings were cold. 
 In a home he saw the peaks he loosed talking to them. 
 
 A perfect place of nature so large captured and brown,
