 We quit, their fearful birds, 
 Lizzie gave them bellybottom 
 And even though strange things we watched him in a kiss. 
 
 If equal thoughts of men not read, 
 
 Time and Christ of our Father 
 And someone still her kin, 
 But let him weep.

 The mind's snow-flake my shames scorns of Hope, 
 The tints of icicles and spiral dim,
