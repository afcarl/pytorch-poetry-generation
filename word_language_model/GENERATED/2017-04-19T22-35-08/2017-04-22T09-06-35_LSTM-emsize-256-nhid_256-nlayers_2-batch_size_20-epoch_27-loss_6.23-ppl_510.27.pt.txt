 
 
 
 
 
 knowed 
 
 
 A little Kingdom with spires, 
 And Babel, to an old word. 
 
 The night is fear'd; we are mery 
 And cringed in the places, 
 Though in another's face 
 Our pleasant hearts to bless, 
 And to the time we jostle to land. 
 
 On mist its bawdiness, rot, 
 Burn to seed and rutted train 
 Among the continent. 
 
 But sad crumbs, they, beset in call: 
 A Syrian odour
