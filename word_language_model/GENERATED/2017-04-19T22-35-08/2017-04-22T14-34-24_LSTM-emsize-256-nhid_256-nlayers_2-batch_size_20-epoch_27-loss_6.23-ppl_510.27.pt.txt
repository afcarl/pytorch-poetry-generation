 Reason's tarn of pennants 
 Wayward as the cradle—. We were the same; 
 
 The cat's mouth, bending toward its soft touch. 
 But I had a good darker face. 
 All deep in the walls of their speckled graves. 
 
 dect by pain and Beads of human eye— 
 To be in grace, draws out in earnest voucher 
 Or freely are hardness, from beats, 
 
 Not their masters, troublous offices 
 On pandanus, or white wheels are grieve--
