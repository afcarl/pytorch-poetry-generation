 We feed two bundles of the boys. 
 Prythee, why don't that move 
 
 Down in the open line 
 Our twilight

 When our home they put under their skin, 
 our children best...; 
 
 when they die from board to year 
 they get four thousand roads, 
 the only ones 
 to be free in need 
 to recall, the body 
 so terrible now in
