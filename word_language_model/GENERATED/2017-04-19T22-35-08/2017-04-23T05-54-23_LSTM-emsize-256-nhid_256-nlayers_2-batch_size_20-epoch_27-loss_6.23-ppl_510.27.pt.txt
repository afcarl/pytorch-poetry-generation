Is Grown, 

 He is the bridge that is not dribbd 
 the mother is found to her by son, 
 as to the hissing Refugio, of her sister 
 we can't carry the two grins in a coat 
 so helicopter so batons 
 there is something teaching the boundaries 
 of our son as coffee, moon-monster 
 Conceiv'd on the salted group, 
 He said the best to war windowsill, 
 the wind shows not mosaics 
 Bestirs the whips that runs 
 in and in
