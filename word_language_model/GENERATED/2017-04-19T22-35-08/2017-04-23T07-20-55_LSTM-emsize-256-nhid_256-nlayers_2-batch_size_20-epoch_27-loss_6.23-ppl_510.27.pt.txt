Quickly Is So Mind— 

 For I know there is still starting to die. 
 Hail to me is the vault 
 Of the beautiful city, it is the crooked gold 
 Who dreams that smell of water are the letters 
 That come from sight under the sun 
 With a bouncing of maple leaves 
 
 (For the roots of this ships 
 and the qu’il and the man's ersatz: 
 
 Or, the red rose of the tree 
 
 Now the hair quiver;
