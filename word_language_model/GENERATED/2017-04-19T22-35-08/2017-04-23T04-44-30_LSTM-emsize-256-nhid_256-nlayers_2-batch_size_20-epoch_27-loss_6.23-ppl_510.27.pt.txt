And Doves, 

 A cacophony of speaking Charles 
 ex-wives, yet for you to fling 
 After the outer wind 
 To hung the fluttering, 
 Accompany reabsorbs 
 By those fresh flukes 
 But the pavement. 
 Through the mixed waters stood, 
 geogoe. in Dismal's rage 
 As I moved home to my wife 
 In the sun's churches of them, 
 Weeps at all that foliage, them 
 In those, and space? 
 All through the sigefolca animals' stand naked 
 Against us, I apart,--Lord,
