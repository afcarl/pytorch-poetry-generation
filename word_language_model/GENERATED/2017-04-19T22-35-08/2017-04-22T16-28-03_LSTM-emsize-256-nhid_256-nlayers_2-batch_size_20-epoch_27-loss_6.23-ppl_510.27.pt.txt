To Stain 

 Their stone at the station 
 
 When they are careful 
 They arrive in a mosaic like the river of 
 Which, can be not, him 
 
 Of a man once more 
 What has dead; 
 And God his illegal style to pass 
 With bricks but he goat's-meat 
 Its coursers that caps! 
 Round each separate stress the weak, 
 If none of it than dress'd, 
 Late as the flame and drowned cornfield, 
 Sweet as knowledge is Achilles's
