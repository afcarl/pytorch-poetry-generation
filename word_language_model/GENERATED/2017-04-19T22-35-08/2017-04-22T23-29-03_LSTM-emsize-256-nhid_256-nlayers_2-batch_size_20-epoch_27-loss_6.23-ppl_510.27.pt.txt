It Is 

 Born when the two of them seems birdshit 
 And when they buzz and saw, and catch their future 
 
 And pointing they touch the Thomists, cry 
 That makes them heed on others and be dusty cars, 
 They fill the water with travelers and widening, 
 The old, uncertain talk of the House for their king. 
 
 The past in the house along, one evening, refuge still, 
 trebly unto death, or ships pass, for the last of those thin heold,
