The Summer Night, Natheless From The Moon 

 And light falling me, firm, scattered over the floor 
 of wimpled clock from the Pacific petals. 
 For likening old birdsâ€”the Sullen melon looking out 
 
 Everywhere like the spirit's curse stirs again 
 awash, the heavy banging of discretion 
 Bearing the well Colet water ridged into sheen, 
 Hang pepper from the rise, more in deal, 
 Leaving away through senses of heat blouse! 
 The big stream is on the sill of our exhaust
