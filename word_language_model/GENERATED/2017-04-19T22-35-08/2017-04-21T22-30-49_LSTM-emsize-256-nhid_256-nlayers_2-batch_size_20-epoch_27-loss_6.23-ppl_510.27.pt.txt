Eunuch Aims 

 
 Until the music grows 
 And drives a palace star, 
 And far away from clouds 
 The constant leaves of paradise, 
 The duller jewelled heart 
 Came scattered through the blank weeds, 
 And as beautiful Eden 
 
 It stings like a tube 
 For the merry one's mother made 
 It never long ago. 
 
 
 
 I have been the quaint indoor king, 
 Whose wishes is its pleasure of evolution, 
 Vitality of incipient lied.
