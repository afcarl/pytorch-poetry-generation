 And there are only stars, 
 Feeling grebes, lips, 
 The Owl that turns through treats 
 To be small and light be 
 No one dared to continue at, 
 To love the living smile-buttons. 
 
 That day the day was under. 
 It had bright riders close, 
 And strew the air. 
 
 And below 
 How the depth with salt sodas 
 holidayâ€”or kirk, 
 Pour in the leafy thunder; 
 And noiselessly the huge tales overhead, 
 And pathwaie tongues against
