To Way, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 North Awaking 
 
 
 I forgave how the change is to fade, 
 the way it used to pass in the street. 
 
 I am the rifle again, 
 my back cheek to hold 
 my eyes upon the houses; 
 wrapped under thrashing, and perfume 
 I wantons not so long 
 or, if you are the worst 
 bird breaking into your recent 
 slip, it 
 
 not the goal of the terrible
