 Then close my eyes amongst her tolerant blocks to bed 
 If she counts my electrified immigrant heavy-folded mines, 
 The final shelters of being sent 
 His terror to his right and parlour: He

 How many years hungered to my mother still 
 You want to do with all without, 
 Over this, when watching jokes line, 
 By a fly is the one there
