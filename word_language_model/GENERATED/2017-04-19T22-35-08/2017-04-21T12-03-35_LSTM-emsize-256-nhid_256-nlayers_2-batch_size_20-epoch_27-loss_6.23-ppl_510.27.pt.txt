That Comes Only 

 As it is, lit by metaphor. 
 
 And as its judgment has, 
 Has fallen Wheat to re- 
 Second nieces have been died for, 
 A single-engine stump of torch, 
 
 Petersburg, 
 A staff sometimes tips of progress--masters 
 
 Or upon an honest body 
 In the rigging than dog, 
 A wind on its hoary green 
 Moving and wheat hauls the shell. 
 All asleep in lawn still choppy and low, 
 Comes round the bend chanting
