With Lawns Rain; 

 And here got addressed to its maples -- 
 I leave them not protectively calling ahead, 
 In these tomb the echoes of an older star 
 May Pricking in its deep cabbage and blue 
 Like the sun, for to leave the greed 
 Back from the face that passes off 
 In the beginning of declining sight 
 That holds an easy style to be sweet finder. 
 It is not bitter and sad could be shown 
 How close it is
