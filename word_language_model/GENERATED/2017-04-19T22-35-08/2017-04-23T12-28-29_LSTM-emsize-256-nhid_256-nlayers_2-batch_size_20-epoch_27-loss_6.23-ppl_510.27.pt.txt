 That the endless essence is seeking by its way, 
 I only know that your mouth is divine; 
 When you see that you, but you hear the smoke of the eye 
 And your death will cry.

 And yes it would be; the soul is 
 hast, 
 Methought we share, we go,i 
 True to our salience, we anecdotal things, 
 Not an individual hour's
