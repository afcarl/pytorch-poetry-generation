Day 

 Looking down the hill until he goes sphere, 
 Don there's one side taken. 'a agree it's burned. 
 
 But I'm going to pick you up into my faith. 
 My mother died and got on your slices of snow. 
 There were moonlight through the tent where your feet 
 Called home the moment of the desert. 
 My friend and man had grown blades. 
 Love our alphabet and me, 
 
 day-star, last use for spring and day, 
 Then and so
