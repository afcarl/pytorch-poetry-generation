 
 Put for bloody barges strove 
 with knives. 
 
 Praise 
 on television or from summer, 
 sometimes they didn't hug 
 in a fern or powder 
 at action or rust. 
 One merged years at the end, 
 to Name. 
 In cast-iron recesses, 
 they flashing their unsteady leaves, 
 flap themselves forever 
 in an ecstasy! 
 
 As the globe they looked 
 Asekoff were entering 
 were the same harsh 
 Quickly in excited heat of air
