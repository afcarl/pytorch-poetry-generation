 But there's something to remain. 
 
 
 
 The truth can never try to miss. 
 Since at hand and perched all over the stove 
 The muzzle is empty, 
 The cats, the Oka is lilting by itself, 
 The sweet, brown fires of plenty, 
 Twenty does not fuck 
 The happy Christ that emerging out 
 Like a Copious, without refusal 
 To exist with a star-faced 
 Six of one poets and one another 
 When underground, and comes on late
