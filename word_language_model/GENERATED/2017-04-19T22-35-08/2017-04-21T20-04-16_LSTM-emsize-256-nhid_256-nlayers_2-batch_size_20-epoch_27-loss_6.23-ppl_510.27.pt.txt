Under It, & Some Portioned Words 

 Again, if it tries to dare 
 To lie still, for this huge warmth 
 blew salvation together. 
 
 
 
 
 
 A Poem in The Cape 
 
 
 When the repossess'd of Lowell 
 Can fall through ever! 
 
 The wonder is everywhere 
 nineteen-feet-two-inches thin, consideration 
 No singular covering; 
 In capable of lovers, 
 Than befriended a honours, 
 
 No matter where he seeks 
 
 A fibre for a smear
