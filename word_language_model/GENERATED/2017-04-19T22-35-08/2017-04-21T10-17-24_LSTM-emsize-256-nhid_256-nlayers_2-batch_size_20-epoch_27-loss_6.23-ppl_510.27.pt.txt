 How should I get to be a part of the afterthought, 
 Outside, by dim pointed wood, 
 I slept before all downpour, fell 
 I smelt the wild more rope, 
 non-plussed the various arrows of the power 
 The eyes are beetles crushed with grass 
 On the Testament who buildings Cuddie, 
 Or else to show the planet's day. 
 
 They stripped their eyes like halls long fresh, 
 And glory and their Heart, 
 Bound they seemed to be a part:
