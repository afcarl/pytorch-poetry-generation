 The low walls of the obsolete said the glory of snow is 
 Death being gone like the bitten poet by the foot of it 
 When the time first bubble's over to finger us one side for hours. 
 Like that lumps of envelopes in further conversation which is new use 
 we've watched us perceive the darkness in gum 
 
 Smoke starts to gather about
