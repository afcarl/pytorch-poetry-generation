Donkeys Mixed 

 With dust. Especially at tangible funnels-- 
 miniature synchesis: 
 
 
 But Voice deserves everything. 
 Childhood is bench. 
 The sun's balloons rise in the bone. 
 The press of sweat is so strong yet is 
 less. Not marble because vanishes 
 My lioness burn and catching 
 My ankles poke and eases 
 Should I lie down 
 Among the American Ages, 
 hungry with my husband's 
 horse encouraged a fortune to want 
 To bow away in the corner
