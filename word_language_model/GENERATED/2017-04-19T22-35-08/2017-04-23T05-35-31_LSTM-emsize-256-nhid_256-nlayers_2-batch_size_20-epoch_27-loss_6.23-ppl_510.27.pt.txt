Out To Back Mood. 

 
 They are the greatest fall world 
 among you, 
 I think of steam 
 On the darkest afternoon 
 You shall not meet ashes 
 Joining my cell ... 
 
 
 
 
 They had at the statue 
 just because they were weak 
 and thought. 
 
 
 
 The ineffectual thought is not written. 
 
 Let it serve out morning the touches 
 
 Or dance to joy, sore or close, the other, 
 
 And
