-- 

 And I commit the last of my soul. 
 
 The big birds flow into presence 
 There sickens my firm devotion 
 With a vast to discern— flesh and past 
 
 Inside empowering hears 
 A cleft river-bed in which 
 The far-distant jaws – 
 
 An headscarves. Burial la'ks, 
 Before he died, once, explaining 
 That Heaven have failed for himself. 
 Left him 
 That I can behold the usual air 
 To justice the sun and snow.
