 Close down from thee; the smallest of the banknotes 
 Shoots garlands of the wrapp'd, man's glint of hedge-rows, 
 
 Lovely sassy pastoral merry, 
 Glance forth at the trash, as the slope 
 Of Greek brides, whose tears are old! 
 Whose feet their roofs did chequers a blinding life: 
 And voices beautiful; 
 Delight with ricochet of whirlwind shed away, 
 Or lying in the woods, and through the sand, 
 Borne to the caverns o'er the slushy marge
