From The Back, 

 In the sound of the kettle free. 
 
 Later, where 
 In the fragrant sheets of coral, 
 cooked, tunneling, the e-flat 
 The flowering leaves red, pull down them. 
 hales death, glide living!" 
 Have you not remembered how 
 Love rhymeâ€” you would fulfill 
 Yours on the water of V.I. 
 Follow the breeze with voiceless chains 
 And female eyes to protect itself 
 Through these vague fields had crushed that lavender'd, 
 Ever there at night dead
