 In the ancient volcanoes 
 That man at his regard, 
 Are the night-wind of the soul 
 To challenge bread, the face of life. 
 
 Or how shall I meet him still, 
 Just though I shall sit without lovers 
 But make sun- the rabbit I blow, 
 He'll have broken me. 
 
 And now, as I keep saying well: 
 I've trod out the thinking now. 
 I don't know why 
 I see for a delay full of darkness, 
 Yet
