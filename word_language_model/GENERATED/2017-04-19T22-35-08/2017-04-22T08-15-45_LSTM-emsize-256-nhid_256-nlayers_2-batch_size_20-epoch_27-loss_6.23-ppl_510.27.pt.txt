The Trip Said; 

 
 The good wind gave everything in the crowd; 
 
 And as two directions from the past blackness 
 Brute up heart with the wind where the dog stand: 
 
 So, sick of the feverish things we see; 
 
 Into our lonely hours: the more standin-on-the-corner 
 
 I work again again to see what to see but well mixed in my ears and take it 
 
 While the Lord is more than mines. 
 
 self-assured us like cots,
