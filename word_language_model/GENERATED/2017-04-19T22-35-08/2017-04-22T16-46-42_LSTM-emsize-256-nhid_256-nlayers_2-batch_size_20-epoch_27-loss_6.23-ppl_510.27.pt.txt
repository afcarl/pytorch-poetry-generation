Eglantine Shining In The Flesh 

 Commences, leaves.

 Out on Lyfe on warm streams. 
 There is a meadow, the color of carelessness, 
 Comes not like a faint idea from above 
 An island figure with its eternal slow 
 betwixen sea and flower, birds. Sweet on its dreary motorbike 
 Steps 
 In a corner of fire that weigh us; grope 
 In tatters to hyacinth through ruined grass 
 And talking at night, without space or wood.
