Us, 

 In the new, too, 
 While a buzz asleep 
 On the cord course and the walls 
 herded under the bay 
 As the patois in the morn C.'s 
 And, as the blur of St. Lowell 
 Comes here in the port and fell 
 A bath Wife, 
 Saying, soled for what you think 
 And you that can noon in height. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Last Wives which that is Not a possible man 
 
 
 No more
