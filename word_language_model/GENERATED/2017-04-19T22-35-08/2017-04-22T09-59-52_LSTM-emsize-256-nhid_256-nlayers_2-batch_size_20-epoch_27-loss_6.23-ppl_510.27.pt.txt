Bit Of Remorse And By Hope, 

 
 Through a large thing name, being wide, pouring peach-tree canal based ice, 
 sympathyâ€” my shirt and I drink pulls my fishmarkets and settlings, my rump in mind. 
 You bring your songs under shore. 
 Not even unless in that you and I leave you 
 Diverted on a tree.

 moonshine; horses in the face of a statement 
 
 Tears, Shabine banquet andor come
