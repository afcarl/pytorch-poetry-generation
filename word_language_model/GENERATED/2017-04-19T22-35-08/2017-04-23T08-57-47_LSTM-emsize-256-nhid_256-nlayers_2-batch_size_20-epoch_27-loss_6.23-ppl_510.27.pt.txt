I Seen The Fold 

 Of iron hands sipping snow to cover 
 My life 
 I watched of the men smoother, 
 And I heard the mice opening down 
 And all I saw themselves, brings! 
 
 Cloth of God, 
 The stumps that lit the ends of life. 
 
 
 
 Light still burned in the dark 
 And there lay in a message. 
 Were it late that go the troubled day, 
 A murderer's eye, has wound that glass, 
 Frail as
