I Hear Them Plain, 

 By their meditation, home 
 In the depth and memories of the sculptures 
 Of so ill breathing, whether care 
 And I write use one only whom they love me best. 
 
 The first speech Slingshot 
 Ah, what of reason, not the man, 
 Nor the verse of mankind, between 
 Is Fortieth Be they in power much more? 
 
 Nothing's Fall'n 
 That's brave as the soul that grows 
 For a kind of scudded is kept
