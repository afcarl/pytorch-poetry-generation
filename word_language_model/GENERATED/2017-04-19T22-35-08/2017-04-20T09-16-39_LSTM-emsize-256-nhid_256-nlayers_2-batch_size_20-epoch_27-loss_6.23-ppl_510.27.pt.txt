Upward, Wake Around 

 and silently, from the minds of the world. 
 Down next street the plant booth against 
 a crash of green, somebody's nose, 
 eyes crossing pattern sicknesses. 
 
 Fire and hard salt spine marking the air 
 
 
 
 I can nod to an E about my fists. 
 Thou kid pauper in the sun, 
 To drink you. 
 In the deep air the day 
 I have crossed the rim along the Grotto 
 To empty my way by
