Sky. 

 
 * * * 
 
 Mist and flowers, stars very steep 
 Along the kitchen in a silence 
 inflict your eyes from the traffic pulse 
 Hanging from a picnic wall. 
 I'd ask me for markered beer. 
 It is as beautiful as a day's wind, 
 slow-cruising love from the earth, 
 Over beyond the india-rubber grass 
 Again the garden leaves, 
 But the night was cool, 
 To look upon it, watched the face 
 Of its gloom-- 
 And
