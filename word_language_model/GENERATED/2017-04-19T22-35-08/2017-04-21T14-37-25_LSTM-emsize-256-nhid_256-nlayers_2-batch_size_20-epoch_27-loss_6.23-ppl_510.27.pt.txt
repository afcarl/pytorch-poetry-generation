No, I Wish 

 Any envied praise 
 or that some 
 original 
 evil 
 credit 
 acceptance, 
 that would die, 
 And when they turned and move. 
 
 Is it hot and 
 maybe if 
 they seem like 
 letters two 
 to rip 
 
 famous for 
 minutes to feed 
 Cheerfull unguarded 
 Their stickshifting blood 
 Are all good and are 
 The timid cars themselves 
 unbalance their plucking faces 
 In blue boards 
 Breaking the Bride
