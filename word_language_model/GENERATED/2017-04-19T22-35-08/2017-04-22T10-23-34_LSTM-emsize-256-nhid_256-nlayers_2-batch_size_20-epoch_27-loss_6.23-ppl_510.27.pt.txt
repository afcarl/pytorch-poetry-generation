Nothing. 

 This morning, and the house of railroad 
 saves its stains and white as dusk gathers 
 into signals pushed up and outside, 
 
 down the chain of dirt 
 crag; 
 
 This is a homage . 
 a loving prayer 
 to page this bread, too hard to rise 
 with the Final awkwardness and haunted, 
 inspiring Murano, the physical patriarchal 
 word of local pleasure-giving 
 
 that collapses, when China 
 center open all 
 
 leaves and love it
