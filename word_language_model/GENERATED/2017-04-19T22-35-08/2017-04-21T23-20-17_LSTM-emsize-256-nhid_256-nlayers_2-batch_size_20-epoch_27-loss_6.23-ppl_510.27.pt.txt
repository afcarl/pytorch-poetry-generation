 The grass was yellow and stones 
 Put down my orchard. 
 When I came to where I knelt alone, 
 I shut the window back to spray 
 that Caucasus; where I stand. 
 
 And now tension then, smirked, 
 I shot its arching floor. 
 I wonder if the sea is into" 
 I have no desire, though I have no aim 
 Just what I do best fear slow. 
 I will pursue myself with breath. 
 
 
 
 "Nature"; my heart
