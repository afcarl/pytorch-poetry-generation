To Harm The Tune. 

 Space comes onward in the air 
 And in my feet your soul answered, 
 We loved the day again, 
 We loved our way at Hall 
 Or begging in a Bases 
 
 Sick of ours. We can hear 
 If that we spring long killed. 
 
 Then I shall find them alone; 
 drums--you and untroubled free 
 In grass and foam, 
 Come ever out of sight, 
 While in mouths green and bright 
 Beneath her briny
