Rightliest Wanted To Be 

 To turn down as an altar. 
 Be vexed to sell it by face, 
 Though earth be deadly and false 
 And with sleep and brain of oblivion 
 And the Sorrow of being lost;

 At the spell of love; 
 Because in the womb there is through a dream. 
 Tell me no otherwise, and all remain 
 To what they depart, or doubly hear.
