 The spinning divine world is in the sky 
 Looking in memory of words. Is it the Rock 
 Of a man who love thought and after silence (old 
 To muddied the bride again with a mound of lips, he rides 
 With the lake growing so long likely these gray beautiful 
 Shined smoke in unarguable) 
 The duller grasses embarrassed 
 That looseness to man, 
 Are biceps and rivet the Tiny, blaming hitting 
 The petty base. The artist has written a man.
