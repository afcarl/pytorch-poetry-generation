 
 In winter evening, renown 
 Toad, that grim and tall. 
 
 A Christmas trees arose Groom-porter's, 
 Duncan swept onto the rocks.

 And the undiscovered majority kept watch 
 The Nimrod. Hardly we have stopped 
 By the fight for the feast," 
 The bailey cap, the little fall – 
 The white – from the Yahoos of the beast. 
 Think again that most does them sit 
 on naked side by those below.
