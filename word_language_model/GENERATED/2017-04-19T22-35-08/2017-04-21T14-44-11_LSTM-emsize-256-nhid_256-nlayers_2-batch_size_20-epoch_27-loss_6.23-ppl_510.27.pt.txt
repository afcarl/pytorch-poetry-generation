City Death, 

 Negress. . . I love? 
 
 That the gravity goes on, 
 And it the games, picnic--today the face 
 That could be flame-white in that looking-up 
 It lulled animal to decay: 
 And has been a serious statue in a does little girl 
 Which learned your insides from the sun, and Studebakers, 
 That other years body will undo 
 severe to ruined," never go to designing, 
 It is, itself. 
 I've liked it to have a good place.
