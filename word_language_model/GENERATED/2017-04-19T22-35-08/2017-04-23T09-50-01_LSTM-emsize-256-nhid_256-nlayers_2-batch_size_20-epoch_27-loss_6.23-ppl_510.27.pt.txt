Dominus To The World 

 I call them up and crying, you can go. 
 
 
 
 Droning a Dilation beat 
 In prose, or a thousand years, 
 a mile above the sea, 
 eels shed in Newton. 
 ravin’d hind crowns to that ripe bubble 
 dreamed— Oh, I gibe-- "A June 
 lights" Steps of spring. 
 My ponders. 
 This is my home. 
 
 When the tide 
 Without not fish and distance, 
 my parakeet handbag 
 boiling hungry with this
