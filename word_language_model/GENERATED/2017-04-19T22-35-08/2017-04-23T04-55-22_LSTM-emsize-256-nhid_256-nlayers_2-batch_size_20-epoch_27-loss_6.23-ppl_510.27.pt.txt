 Thou hast made me the same, pucker. 
 Your birth, my brother, light, a breast-- 
 God filled, but noblest sense should be beste; 
 "The Fiend lov'd in her arms, the Queen, 
 Now never take. 
 
 headlights; wind he spoke, lay me lightly, 
 Down me across apprenticeship flake. 
 
 My body with my dear blues-tune weary for madness, 
 From the far side of the hill again; he fastens me
