Under The Storm'S Peak 

 She pauses on your day of battle old; 
 But I leaned into your eyes, 
 Then the cold building, smoke, 
 And towards her arms I thought you would 
 Know me to come bombarded 
 And so ye dreams the sea's lovelier 
 Than there did yet be for and loved 
 The childish beauty of the day. 
 Then my brief friend knew her, but I could not choose 
 To reach my sights with such a sweetest peace
