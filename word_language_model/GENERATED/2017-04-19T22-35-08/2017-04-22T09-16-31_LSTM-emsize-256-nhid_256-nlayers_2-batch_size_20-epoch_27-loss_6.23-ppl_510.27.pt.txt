 
 Documentaries on nine, chewing a door 
 Made of Emergency! 
 
 In its Shelf 
 The Corner swarm and success 
 
 Are heoe in without 
 An particular ain glow 
 Just one dirty, missing town 
 Inside a battered beam, 
 
 The right thrush turns from miles 
 No blade arranged at its hide, 
 
 Or separate, true that feeling 
 Or choose the mean 
 
 Since it shall not return, 
 And nothing born down at us.
