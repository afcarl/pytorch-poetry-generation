You Are Almost Quite Wise, 

 So shall the stars wring down 
 With embassies which I raffle you, 
 Except you're a chance that I will say. 
 
 And though this remained "loves," you run 
 From the things still, too cold to roam, 
 With his hands in her long day's gray chair, 
 Remove a dead life as long as the day 
 That settled down the globe and closed the kill. 
 Bloom that Arden may hate you all.
