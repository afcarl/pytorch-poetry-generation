Died Gone, And Such As Before, 

 I have some saved Texas bodies, buried in covetousness, 
 On a mountain, 
 I cremated lives the pulsation of the account, the master . . . to whisper. 
 
 I heart that I see my father wholly, 
 All this Chaucer hath the holy way: 
 And she says, "the beasts, and stand in a tree. 
 
 No one has slept at the folds down the mountain-winds 
 And to me at the stillness of the world:
