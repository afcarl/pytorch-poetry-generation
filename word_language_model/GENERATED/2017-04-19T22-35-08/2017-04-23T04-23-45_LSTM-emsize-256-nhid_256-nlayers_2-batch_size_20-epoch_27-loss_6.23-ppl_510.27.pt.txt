Eyes: By Observation Inglehook, 

 They better dug together in the night 
 unavoidable 
 
 For yes I felt not yet so fast 
 By you, in what a braunch, 
 Depends on the crocus at the night, 
 Unseen, the Pond by the walls 
 When I felt among the blessed horses 
 Of Unpaid, Willunga leofost 
 
 And they ate my ears to whole-person-boxer to live 
 cosmic- Death, still sitting 
 With most constancy. and I'm 
 Not half so tired they care
