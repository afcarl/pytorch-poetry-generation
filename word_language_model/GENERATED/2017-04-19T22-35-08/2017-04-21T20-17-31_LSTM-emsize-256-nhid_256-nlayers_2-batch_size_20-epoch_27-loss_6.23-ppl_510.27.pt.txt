 I swathed in the greening world 
 And heath? reflecting 
 My blasted heart 
 
 Of the little dead 
 Straight down a plane 
 
 It should have a heart, 
 For don't marry. 
 So what is death, 
 This one hath dreamed moss glides 
 To rust from a forest small, 
 Or keep a moon-white 
 For dying things a while 
 
 But some nomadic clown 
 Inscribed to fraternity 
 In hell or laughter short 
 And worse to think
