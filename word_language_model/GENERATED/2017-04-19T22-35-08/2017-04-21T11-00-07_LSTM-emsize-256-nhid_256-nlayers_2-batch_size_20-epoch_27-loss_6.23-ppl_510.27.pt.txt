And Arm That Brought Us Out; 

 Truth will not stand on Earth, for any spring or day, 
 Shall only ever be quite feast-- 
 Pinned the burden of Ivie passing sad where the salmon dims 
 
 That the white ship pulls off the gradual steel, 
 But the universe trembles to read. 
 
 Take you out with the kings rest; 
 To pumice solemn swimmer beautiful 
 That sleepless 
 The sweet water of our living pliant find.
