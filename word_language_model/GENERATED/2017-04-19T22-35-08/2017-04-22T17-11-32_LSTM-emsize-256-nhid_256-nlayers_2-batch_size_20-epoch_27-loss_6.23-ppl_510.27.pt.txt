Of Bees. 

 I turn out to snow with number, 
 My come--to night, time swelling came! 
 
 The medieval peaks travel and the hills wet, 
 Longer than set, crawling along a tree 
 One earth is cool, for one hundred years 
 Change grown fast in its flashing sheets. 
 If the sun does grow and the smoke falls 
 And stink lined up with ceaseless tread, 
 Mark'd how many things to wring it in 
 And stands into straw-like we have candor's
