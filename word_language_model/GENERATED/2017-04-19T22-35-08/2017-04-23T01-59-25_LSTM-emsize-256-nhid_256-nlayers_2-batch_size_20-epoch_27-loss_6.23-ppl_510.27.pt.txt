We Must 

 We look up; you and the trees and gains 
 The snows which loves the day to err 
 Or till the usable Judge shall live so long. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Why Altoids Go, Kind 
 
 
 'Twas when it goes to grief. 
 No hurt be late, when one rose, 
 Pour faint too high, from joys to preach. 
 
 dea told thee what you pass with you and high, 
 Was not; since neither strange nor great.
