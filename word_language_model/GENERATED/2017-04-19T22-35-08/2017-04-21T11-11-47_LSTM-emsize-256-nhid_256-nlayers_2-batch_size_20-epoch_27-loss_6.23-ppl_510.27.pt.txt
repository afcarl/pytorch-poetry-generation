 
 While the child stood good as that mold, 
 Er how often does he quit right still, 
 have to drop the fuse 
 between His eyes as he galloped 
 into his head in hand half pees in the kitchen 
 between his face, the cloth quivering 
 in a hole in the stove, 
 and filling his location 
 into Christmas streets, somewhere 
 rampant at mouthing herbs who dumbly work 
 
 with his right hand biting and runs 
 his horns with
