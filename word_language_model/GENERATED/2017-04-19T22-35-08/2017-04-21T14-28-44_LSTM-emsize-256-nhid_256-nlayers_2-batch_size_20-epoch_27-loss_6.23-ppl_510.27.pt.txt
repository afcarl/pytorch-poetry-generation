Dry'D Baaa From Sleep 

 On woldon stripped and miles go, 
 Vincentians nothing! 
 And now in such bees, 
 Clos'd oars or led 
 to my block of death's 
 cantuccini... for lumber flares 
 under one in the muddy bow, 
 
 drowning thinking the word moves clearly the sun 
 and face its tail 
 brushed into love, try 
 to whisper, rather regular poetry 
 
 hung on your shoulders in wonder they'll 
 know that road is a free kiss
