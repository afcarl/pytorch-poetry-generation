 You caught the spider or popped the switch, 
 The boot in heavy town, 
 And the ruptured dirt tears of sunbathing 
 mingled as a sund tree? 
 withdrawn. Brautigan with all so much 
 In a ship and greener up and down 
 The skeletal deer, away; the woodsâ€”let 
 Of martial love. The millions 
 Of grab the Prime 
 
 Herbs 
 Through the chairs. 
 
 In heaven and the canal, 
 Walk on the money--those edge,
