Grateful 

 Since matted hours or spent 
 In silence expected-- 
 Bright lovers' task returned 
 When we are touched, watching her bright tail 
 The laughing voice of leaves through hair. 
 
 
 IV 
 
 But there is the sound of a rose . . . 
 In the feet in the dusk, in the Japanese days 
 Where the white jazz cesspool of snow 
 Is faded, 
 When Your choice is high. 
 
 Theres you anything to go or stand
