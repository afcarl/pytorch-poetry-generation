 Woof. When there was boundless glue 
 Time and bed of Earth, of light, horizons. 
 
 The week's fantastic silence for the rocks 
 colour. for, throughout its thermoses, it had quit 
 Our forms Bottlesford like spec. thrown on 
 To such a monkey sleeping rear'd our doors 
 Arbitress, and abandoned at no hand 
 Unsunn'd till our new murderous lives, 
 So long a moment's space Walrus, abundance is to 
 Our bodies, so what Love can Arise 
 Of sunflower holding us
