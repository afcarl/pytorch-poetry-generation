Way ... 

 To hope to get some to action, 
 Like abstraction. 
 
 And once after liveliest pools that sunlight 
 Had been traveled to the sides of Faces great-grandfathers 
 The cushion upon the plate in exchange 
 The verb frantic 
 
 When the other henchmen ever chose to bring back on my 
 wagon until your children both coming back in your baffled being 
 
 leaving me about yourself. Hold the Movie along you 
 
 shriving chicken everywhere late stall
