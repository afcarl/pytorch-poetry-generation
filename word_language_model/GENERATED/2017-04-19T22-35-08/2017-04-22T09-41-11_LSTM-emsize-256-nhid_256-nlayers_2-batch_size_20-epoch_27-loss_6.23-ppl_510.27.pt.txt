 
 Having left the sun 
 West in the shadow 
 of a forest of remarked. 
 like a fountain that 
 that loosely down the tomb. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Falling Through a Variation or a Lower strain? 
 
 
 That one trains instead of old men 
 Had grown sent from houses, 
 A thousand including nine trash 
 How shall we come round 
 Up a little back for lunch, 
 A cloud that picks up the road
