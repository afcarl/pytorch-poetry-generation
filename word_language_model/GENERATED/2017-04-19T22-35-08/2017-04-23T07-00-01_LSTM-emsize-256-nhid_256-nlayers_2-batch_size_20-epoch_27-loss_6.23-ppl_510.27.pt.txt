The Dead 

 Who speaks to them with music 
 No man they contrived & others or grow scores, 
 
 Except the color where it enjoys Oblivion-- 
 Why would he only know that he was a party. 
 If ever else he was 
 real) but there are breath bouncing 
 To a note so much of the lions are born. 
 
 Cities of lilac towers from behind sunflowers, 
 More thought he sang in the middle of leaf 
 In a lonely rain
