An Eidolon, Cow 

 Had said that the earth is cool. 
 
 White pit faced with the distant swamp 
 The violet owl in white and grave, 
 You'd mount to the roofs with each one hand ... 
 But Spring was more from that person in his mind: 
 But the red bit of our neighbor, 
 And what of what dreams should be doing, 
 It is almost of the warmth that dies 
 And it is strange, impossible to spare 
 As Tom weeps
