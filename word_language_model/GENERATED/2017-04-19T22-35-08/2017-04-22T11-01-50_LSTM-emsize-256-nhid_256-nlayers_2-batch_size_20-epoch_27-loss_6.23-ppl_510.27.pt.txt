 Round that foolish Blazon 
 Did the miles and the rats 
 Swinging themselves, 
 For they creak them down to receive it here with their master, 
 Making in waters, a reindeer-sled, Nimbly 
 Show'd distorts pavement, fist!â€” 
 In face back past the silt, and now for sunset 
 Over their warm voices fall out 
 With the flashes until the bay is shifted 
 After a season, my mind slides stone, 
 And them not to see the Pacific with trees, among layers
