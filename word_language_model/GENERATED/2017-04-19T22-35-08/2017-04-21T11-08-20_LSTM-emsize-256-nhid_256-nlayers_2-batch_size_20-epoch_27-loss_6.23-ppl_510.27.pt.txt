 After the rest. 
 
 And as they swerves in re-routed 
 fathomed one's life, with light and fire 
 3rd, through in Gothic sea-hawk's 
 Woods, they raise aside a faint tapering string. 
 In the wet light 
 In hoop of portentous, 
 I went to work of whatâ€™s not so much 
 To where the sudden flies within 
 Its breath static. 
 With losing us breathing 
 The way up, the halflight 
 Masses and stone were cherub's 
 In an unfamiliar rooms
