Dividing By This 

 Like me, by sleeping, one day, leopard? face. 
 
 
 
 Everything but death 
 Is a chilled expression, but my voice, 
 The pleasure that walks 
 Under my dreaming face, 
 
 We cant listen. 
 
 Be but the radiator 
 That takes shape the grass 
 For the sun's grey force of the fruits 
 And the leaves of the clock 
 Would look like the others--it 
 Or the waves push home out of sight.
