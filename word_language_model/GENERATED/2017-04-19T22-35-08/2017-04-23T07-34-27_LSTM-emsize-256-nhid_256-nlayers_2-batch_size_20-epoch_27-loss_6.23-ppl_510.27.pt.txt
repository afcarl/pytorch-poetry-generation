From The First Clear Night 

 The night sun covers objects 
 
 And the molasses of leaps, 
 The green maze lies, 
 The breakers lay on the pier 
 Knight of azure and perfume 
 And among them bleak as fire, 
 beheaded in white, wars, chaos and woeâ€” 
 Each evening. 
 
 They finish our daughters of things! 
 Nor have the music of your teeming face; 
 Come or fly, sick things we all must understand. 
 Come, Ryoanji: riper than she, rock)
