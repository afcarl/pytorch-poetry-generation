Wake; 

 God's Reader! is toward it all, but she's 
 aware or interested in hand on view. 
 
 So late the heavy Jumblies pop 
 Blasts a labyrinth of the mountain lunatics, 
 And rolls silently upon their eyes like hurried light. 
 
 Oh, old companions were old, and not the dayâ€” 
 Since I fear God, I could conquer the virgin, 
 I seem to pick them up from out that farm side 
 To a burgum when they played everything at rest
