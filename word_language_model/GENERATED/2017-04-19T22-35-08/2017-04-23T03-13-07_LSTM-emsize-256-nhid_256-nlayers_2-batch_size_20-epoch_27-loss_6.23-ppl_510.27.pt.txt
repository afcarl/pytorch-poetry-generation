 But Batture 
 I'll still be a complete 
 keys 
 Looking 
 Down 
 And leave you here 
 I shoot you in words 
 And death strapped to you. 
 
 The search of your hope 
 I call you in 
 Our bones 
 
 Of time up 
 Write life 
 Be singing from something and coming through 
 Its pain 
 Not seeing the county 
 Your watery, sneakers and 
 Red natives are here 
 And it's right in love.
