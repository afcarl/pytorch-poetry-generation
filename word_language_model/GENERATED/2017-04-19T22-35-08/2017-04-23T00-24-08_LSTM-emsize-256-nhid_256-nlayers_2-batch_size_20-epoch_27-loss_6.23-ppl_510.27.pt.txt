 Let me Tuesday sort of birds come down 
 To your house like a swamp shouther; 
 Or keep the sun to all. 
 
 
 
 Are you younger, make you garden, 
 A Temptation between two legs, 
 Kept you under the mariners' Kneeling 
 from what grey and I can read 
 Like something to say to us 
 As well as winter sails 
 Can bite in the light of peace, 
 And forget it not to be wakened.
