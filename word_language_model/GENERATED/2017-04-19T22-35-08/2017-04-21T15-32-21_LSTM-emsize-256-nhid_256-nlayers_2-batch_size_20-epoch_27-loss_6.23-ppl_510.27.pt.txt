Exchange, 

 Since the dead man was all was dead. 
 The only man on the leaking beard. 
 Hail the song o' being printing from oils, 
 Till the ship bind to the seas. 
 But the kids have haul out last grief 
 And the rivers where the sheep run. 
 Come clear the night and night we there, 
 While the earth bow through us, as it kneels on 
 Till it comes in Santa houses, and truck, 
 And settling out the hideous flood.
