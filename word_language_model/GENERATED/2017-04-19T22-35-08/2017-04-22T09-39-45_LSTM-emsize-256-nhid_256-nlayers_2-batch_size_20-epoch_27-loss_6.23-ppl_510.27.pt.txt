Amphora 

 The couples must call out 
 My mother discovered very dead ... 
 
 You don't know how to do a lot of beauty 
 But what I want to have to you, and leave, to all 
 The dreams you once will know; I'm silver-suited on, 
 
 In your books you see a polka of light, 
 That when I notice how your dark breeze clings 
 And danced there like a wind. 
 
 
 
 
 
 apprehend Us You razored hopefilled,
