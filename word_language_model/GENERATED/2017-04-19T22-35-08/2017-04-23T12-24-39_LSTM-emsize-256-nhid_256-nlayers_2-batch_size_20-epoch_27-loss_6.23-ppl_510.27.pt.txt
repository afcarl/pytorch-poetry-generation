Had Told 

 A week or there did make some birds there. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Half the People in a Land 
 
 
 On the porch in this mighty air 
 I tell my love, to think of him, 
 Climes to me from us, in manhood, like dreams 
 Of the obvious scheme of Love, 
 That long, to which with him he's done. 
 
 Achmacalla: 
 a-dropping on the grassy highway. 
 Every man let us stand still-- 
 And build,
