See It Clap The Door, 

 Poet after God sunset, 
 Empyrean: a fig plays by. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The gases of M.A. Life 
 
 
 "This long beams that island-people azure parthenon. 
 And to the wooden wood: the level pile 
 Of here and in her womb the frame is dead; 
 The body of the gods begins. 
 The fate removes all distances in steel, 
 And more the ancient hosts or hoary, 
 serves to which thus he spoke,
