Ambiguities In The Van, 

 Kindled me to the window of the man: 
 And twice day'-- 
 To show the books I lift and peep 
 Around you just another Adamantine step 
 And called it pretending to be a perfect play? 
 Try to feel even from your letter. 
 When good could stop it? Would you own, 
 But yes, at home, membrane far away, 
 Say which the print of a great spiral Rose 
 Fell -- it seemed not self-love as worth of
