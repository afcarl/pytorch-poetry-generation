Did Undesired. 

 The songs and the jangle o' their officious tops 
 waving, tea by moss, and the Red Ghost 
 Gift upon his tender fillet like a cutlass, 
 From whence a black bird touches so large a hunter's orange, 
 A white flamingo far all on its folds pane of gold, 
 And the stars lifted, day and morning bliss in Boogey 
 Sunlight with high murmurs wrought a junkyard of occult elf, 
 And some with not a charm that never more."
