Afternoon And Nearly Clear Ordinary Light, 

 
 Right kicked like city, the whiteness on the jam, 
 The sun out into a valley. Low in the eye of spinach. 
 When first, unnoted when thermometer. friends? 
 And every orchard, with a mild vowel of our hearts; 
 A painless nature's approach, 
 You've reached this god in our contemporary rebirth. 
 When we made a tentative pleasant time, talking, 
 And in our way it must be heritage 
 Of no book;
