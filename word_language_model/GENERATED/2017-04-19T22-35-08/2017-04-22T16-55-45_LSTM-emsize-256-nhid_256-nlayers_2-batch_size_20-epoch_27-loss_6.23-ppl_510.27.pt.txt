I Give, 

 hit-or-miss, the power of life, 
 A brute or any man. 
 What would I have say? 
 I've got it short, and in mind, 
 I put on my right hand, 
 And ran on back, 
 And wait Joan 
 With empty stones in a snug gown 
 Like thunder, waiting for air 
 And tremble for a few men Ruy 
 So rich in them I once dealt 
 And see the third have singing this life. 
 
 And the men
