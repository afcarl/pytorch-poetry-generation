 And music and fire superstitions, 
 Whenever the Methusalem! blasts 
 Lives on the sashes, 
 Finding peace, and no child! 
 All sisters and his way. 
 
 The drenched and white torrent 
 Stirs that! serves him: 
 
 Delicate peas on his lips 
 Have made of little pale exaltation 
 Whose pictures bathe their pillow 
 From where they see, surveys, 
 By the corners of their fixt, 
 Red Poet perched in his tent 
 armed at casting him safely with him.
