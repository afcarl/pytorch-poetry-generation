Of Half-Impelled, 

 And the sharp pallor of a tactical wind's hair. Even emerg'd, 
 Was the lost God, that his lust o'er the Man? 
 
 Stanza 3 
 The magnet of the farmer's man pursued the land, 
 And signed the whole Morse. Blues his face down, 
 Like a sentinel's sun... 
 Joyful feathers and his tears-- 
 With his chin he leaned upon his shirt. 
 
 The causes soul was all now slain as good as the stock 
 He never could deliver.
