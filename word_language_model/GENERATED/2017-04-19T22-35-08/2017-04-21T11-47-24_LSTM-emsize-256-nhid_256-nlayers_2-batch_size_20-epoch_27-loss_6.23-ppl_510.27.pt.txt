 And evil; wisdom is virgin's 
 Cadavarena. And, marched, and two moons breathe: No prayers 
 
 And still there is nothing left to come. 
 There is nothing to you in hell. 
 All those traces are perpetual chicks 
 Running through the compass of the City for rain. 
 
 
 
 
 I saw one creaked 
 That one could see itself a tune. 
 O how I rest! 
 
 I like to stumble at a mosquito. 
 I'm tired of the city,
