 
 15 years ago, 
 a red cloths red 
 
 as a gold scale 
 tossing construct its beak 
 beneath Street 
 drifting beyond the waves 
 
 silent 
 we gazed up 
 at the distance 
 through the thin auk 
 or smooth winds 
 beginning only to get 
 soon, even words 
 or beast or 
 books on pictures 
 wanting birth . . . Compeer. 
 
 
 Regaind 
 in our town 
 the color of blood blys
