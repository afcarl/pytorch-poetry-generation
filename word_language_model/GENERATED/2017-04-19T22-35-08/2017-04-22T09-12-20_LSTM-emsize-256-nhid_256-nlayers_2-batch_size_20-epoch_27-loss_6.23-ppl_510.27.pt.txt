 Wielder of joy and lost bands, 
 Though sadly he went he; 
 Set loneliness intense â€” 
 All that the cot in a world 
 Are Father safe from Noms 
 bedclothes of a venomous man 
 And made his help of granite here 
 In frozen meadows of street. 
 There are where her breath is gone so bright, 
 Where she should'st work divine 
 Three loved too low again. I shrieked 
 To be unknown. I was wroth 
 slit that laboratory from
