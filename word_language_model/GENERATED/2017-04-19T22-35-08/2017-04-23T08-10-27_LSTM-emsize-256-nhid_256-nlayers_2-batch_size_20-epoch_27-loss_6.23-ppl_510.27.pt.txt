 
 In speech I lie & bring the walls, 
 
 All those of other pride 
 
 And means it is molten. 
 They are happy to float by the darkness. 
 Perhaps one mortal sort of being; 
 Delight brighter than the earth, 
 Since they backed me. 
 
 
 
 If it rhymes with a woman's and rare navigation; 
 
 gallops, by wash'd FLEE 
 Tho' I will my fascist name:â€” No, quick, no mistake.
