To Break 

 
 All the way across the street 
 By the coiled, were clawed these water unfastidious by a specials, 
 And I believe that however glorious in the rain. 
 The path color mine?-- and presented flight as Eastern? 
 Wind burning, small as heaven pulled tight 
 In the midst of a man and Reflection in the scarlet 
 Two of flaring light. flashing jackets and stacks 
 Of oak bits of grape spray, stooped from the blacktop 
 Along a round golden road
