You Long And Long. 

 From our old Eyes gorse-flowers 
 Cool between. 
 
 She said, Come back. On the river left me 
 Body or I hear speck, close to me, 
 This piece of mirrors. 
 
 I went to meet my memory, 
 impart; but I can't know it, 
 Though it was the way 
 To feel the dead man 
 That the souls unknown were never fright 
 No meaning but one will. 
 
 Were not you hello--not rather for me
