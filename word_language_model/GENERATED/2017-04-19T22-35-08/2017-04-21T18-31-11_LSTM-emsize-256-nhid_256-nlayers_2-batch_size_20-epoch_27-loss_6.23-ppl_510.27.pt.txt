It Periods Sink At The Foot Of The Tide; 

 A bending ragged leaf, and a roar now 
 renewing, sweetly asleep. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Delia 31: Us is my motherâ€”my Friend, 
 
 
 And now a man might not harm you; 
 Thou pissily, batter'd and Fame, -- 
 When woman's pleached fruits faded own. 
 For gathering on salt thy Belly oft-times afloat 
 By truovar and the glassy wounds, 
 Which mine the tiptoe, creation's all. 
 
 So the hours
