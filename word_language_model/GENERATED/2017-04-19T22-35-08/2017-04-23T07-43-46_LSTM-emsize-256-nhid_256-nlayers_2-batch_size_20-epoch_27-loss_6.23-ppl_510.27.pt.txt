Of The Sea, 

 And unloved again a walk 
 To a man as merciful, reviled; 
 
 I must be for sitting creeping far 
 At evening rate? 
 And the sheen on the pen with a young 
 Found hand that knew no good old man 
 But still fled to the vault 
 Of tortured people from where 
 What were his kisses, never duteous admir'd, 
 If forests were full of load and stuck them. 
 Darkly he sighs at hoom with bullets peer,
