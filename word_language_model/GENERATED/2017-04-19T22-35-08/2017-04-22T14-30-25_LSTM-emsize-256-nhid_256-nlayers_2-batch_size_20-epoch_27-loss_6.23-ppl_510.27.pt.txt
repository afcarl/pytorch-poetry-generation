 Wild milk of garments stand, 
 And misty lilies play, 
 There felt a thousand whirring berries, 
 Out flew by, there was was no evil. 
 
 God of his mind, is gone, 
 And the tears that froze about, 
 The cowslips round his fields, 
 And the sweet eyes of youth not lie 
 Nor birds nor stars nor snow.

 The island comes, the shadowy air 
 I saw, the dust with snow: 
 The darkness of the night.
