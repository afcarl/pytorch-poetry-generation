 Because in their nights: died. 
 We believe the illusion of a small 
 massed teeth and stuck for the Cresting 
 To revolted towers, belonging to the shape 
 Of all its frozen struggle. 
 You pointed up to the vine, 
 And they choose your nose 
 And what you can't climb up to the door, this. 
 Steadily at last, pine-air, graying 
 Over the (jasmine gnarled trays 
 With the Congo grow hunter Sequoia hardtop 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Savior
