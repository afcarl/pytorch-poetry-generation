The Wanderer 

 Is that? For instance, there is a Freud 
 Who never lived in a little spinach 
 Or was looking to my dog in my arms, 
 You understood that it was a mountain of the months of your life. 
 Not about your distant mouth, but it was that possible 
 For the picture of summer. You play 
 â€”And Deep in heaven 
 The days have come to me as men on men. 
 And if a whisper is like a carnation
