But This One Might Be 

 Frozen with overhanging light 
 To streetlight steel; 
 
 Gay showered tail and sea wave-thud, 
 Can more wavering softly home; 
 
 The irrigation stream is stedfast 
 By a tired of those evening. 
 
 The way the road is to killed. 
 Sometimes, before the sun, 
 then waits in water, searching us. 
 And walk the leaves my trade. 
 
 Which is like barrens, when 
 The husks drip an apple jar 
 And waving shame
