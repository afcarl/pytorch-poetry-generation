 At his secret Gate once ended. 
 Relieved and tails, 
 As to the face of battle, 
 And they silently bought unto us: 
 The chopped rigours of the birth of song, 
 The error of the dead, with more squally

 And for themselves of so much melancholy.

 Match'd with the gentle domes of so many rude 
 From all they read ... or what are rot.
