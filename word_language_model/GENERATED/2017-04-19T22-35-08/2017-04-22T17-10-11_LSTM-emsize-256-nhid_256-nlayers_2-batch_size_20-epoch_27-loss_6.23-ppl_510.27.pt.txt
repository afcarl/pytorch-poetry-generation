Murder-Plots--Later 

 And in passions they are all un-scrolled 
 Then our music and hands are tending sometimes away, 
 We thank not believe loaded by the sleep; 
 some lost, too, lean-- Have we great time to calve 
 Who should not guess to be free of America but to protect. 
 
 
 
 
 Rain and nights into her, 
 Expecting back by corn 
 the swaddle of the sky 
 dull as enshrouds 
 
 I watched the Aurora brushed 
 his halved doors.
