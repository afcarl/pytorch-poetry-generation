Signs Or Weed 

 As if in fire, the water broke. 
 
 The lapping self not (4 whiskers disperse in the solar Atlantic souse 
 And geese came down into the falling extremis. 
 The wind ended. It was bucking a grass colors repentance, 
 A party frozen like sand, 
 an analeptic tree? 
 The fog sets 
 
 Shining 
 The zebragrass waits spred and disappear 
 Wrapped in antique shoelace to cognac or sheet, 
 Dayblind, smoke 
 With the disattiring and beard,
