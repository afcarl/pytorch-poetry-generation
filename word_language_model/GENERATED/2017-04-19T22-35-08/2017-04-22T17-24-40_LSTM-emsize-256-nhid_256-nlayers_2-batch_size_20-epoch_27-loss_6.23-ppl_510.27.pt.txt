Between Ash. 

 Pictures of the skeleton longbows, 
 Sleep behind till's blinding wing 
 Toil after Dinak'i, 
 Walking windless threads

 Bloodaxe, taught" music, 
 The rockstone month, Villette 
 Reading nothing in grass and light; 
 Mountains Apollo's fetlocks world, 
 marked 
 afreshâ€” grant the song of the otherwise-only-probable 
 I think of fear as hard as text 
 of Almond-tree 
 
 Because of these books no more 
 scanning the sunlighted trees 
 and fighting broken grass
