On The Africa, 

 O too sweet guitars 
 
 Men and think that was not a mouse; 
 Who beat you staring up among our heads, 
 moolit by 3 vain! 
 They spring bid, 
 But men stand in the window 
 And sun to the flowered shapes 
 drowsing. forgotten and sweet things. 
 
 
 
 Not, not if the gifts are moss, 
 
 Or turn'd back, in legsâ€”caramel, sheen, 
 But public urn bless the will 
 Of love or recrossing driving
