Dc, 

 Of clustered blue signal, stone breaking, 
 Naked in the madhouse silent, 
 With high scum 
 Or carved white with nails 
 Or moves through the spate of the day, 
 Where they perforated cities 
 To the howling end of a dead machine 
 Against the branches. 
 
 But now the turn of it took 
 Last light. 
 
 
 
 To the cattail scoop the yellow pavement 
 bannister, above room in sight. The 
 waters taken from wheels and shoulder,
