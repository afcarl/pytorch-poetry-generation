 Under the mouth of the desert in windy and arc 
 Of a Respite, plant, they should come ... 
 They crossing the hills then eat their rings, 
 But I, here, they chatter and sing us, 
 The New Chinese World steps ahead, 
 Artificer of the twist has brought him home. 
 
 Slow where the merest point you grosbeak, 
 So the timbrels look not! 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sheep 
 clowned 
 enigma 
 The harvesters. 
 Tossed to catch
