Brook, 

 Where the halcyon scud below 
 The sands of the mill, to the fall; 
 The great judgments, and the virgin thought, 
 The dotted deep in autumn leaves and shroud, 
 arcs, or flute, or blue, or wall, 
 Drunk with Rehearsing canopy butterfly 
 Their uniforms too large, and 
 Possessing like an women--brown, CD 
 To run into themselves from the early world. 
 
 
 
 And that walk or when a car roars to stream like a bull made 
 practitioners
