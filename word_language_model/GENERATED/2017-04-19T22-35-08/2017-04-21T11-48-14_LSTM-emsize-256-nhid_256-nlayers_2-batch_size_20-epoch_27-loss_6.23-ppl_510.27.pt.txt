 
 
 The sky is a cave of a cloud 
 I can barely contain 
 an ice crowd upon my arm 
 comes and filling me 
 
 my wash of rut 
 in my stomach, touches my step, 
 enough my popping to death. 
 
 You barbed finale 
 an empty alcoholic 
 woman eating my hair 
 into her rooms between red tomatoes, 
 the blush of Chopin 
 among them in my room, 
 
 sweet horse, hairy 
 devouring shells and
