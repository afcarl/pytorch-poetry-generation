 In baskets. 
 
 
 
 My darling, with you, song! 
 There are many ways to make my point. 
 An sleep's his mask was discussed 
 To smiles at the bar. Tell it. This interglinting 
 His great nightgown. 
 
 Ah, dear, for my lover at twain, 
 The rising throat of a tree, 
 That its body is June. 
 She wears the finger on her torn lap, 
 The delicate glare is deaf -- 
 She find a song of failing joy,
