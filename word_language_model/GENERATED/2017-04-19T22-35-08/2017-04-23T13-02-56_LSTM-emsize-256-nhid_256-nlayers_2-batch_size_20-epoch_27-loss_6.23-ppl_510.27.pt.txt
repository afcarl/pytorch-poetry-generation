Air Of Night, 

 And a dancing bone, hardly broken. 
 A spine of sandhill birds, then trembles, but clear. 
 It flutters at their fathers, and in a moment 
 The act of its abandoned dream will be itself 
 A complex shape, less audible than a chant of shape. 
 These days, and your dreams are naughty, simple, brothers, 
 Someone is taking each a bead of broken eyes 
 
 And one hand that lit sea above the opened rock, 
 
 Over our chins
