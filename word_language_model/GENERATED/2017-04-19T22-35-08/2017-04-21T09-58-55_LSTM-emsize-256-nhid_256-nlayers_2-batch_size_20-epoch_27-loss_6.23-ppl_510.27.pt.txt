To Sills. 

 
 
 
 
 The globe. And the coming-out-of-nowhere moment 
 I grew hiding on either side of the people 
 We used to borrow the perfect florescent: 
 I have failed. 
 
 
 
 gulf: we are all born when we are. 
 We Varus' have come to our rain: 
 We know how second they feel, Hercules 
 In an undreamt book that has performed 
 men-slugs and did we know 
 That might destroy. We know silvering.
