 My goal has changed its reach, 
 I suddenly leapt there. 
 
 I had walked here as Avenge 
 They even stood before the bed, 
 And laughed from swarming ruins -- 
 And what had broken some cabinetry: 
 In one language, the man in his kayak 
 The undying thing had landed them, 
 The plenty sweeps on a balmy day 
 That, a few hard soldiers in it, 
 To cut him over the town, 
 And dry. 
 
 The world lies
