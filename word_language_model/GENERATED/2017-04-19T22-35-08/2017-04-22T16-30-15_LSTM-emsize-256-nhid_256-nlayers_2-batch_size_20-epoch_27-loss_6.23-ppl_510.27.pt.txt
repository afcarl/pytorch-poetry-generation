 Lord little singers, I shall learn, 
 There's no ore for ever new; 
 Pluck'd for thee. 
 
 Loud the proud earth that God may bar 
 heartstrings o'er thy difficult grave; 
 Glory to end him from the tree. 
 
 
 
 Bright star! O deep hast thou dost love and gloom; 
 Let me not feel this night, and faint, 
 And make my land in our mirages to seem. 
 
 To lift thy feet upon the thorn 
 Of incense halls,
