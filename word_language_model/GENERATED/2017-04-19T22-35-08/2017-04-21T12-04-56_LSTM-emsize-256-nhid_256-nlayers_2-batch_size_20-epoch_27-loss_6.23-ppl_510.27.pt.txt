Wish 

 A number hung in darkness 
 Or nothing is like you, without speed 
 Of silent logic. 
 
 Almost touching you, newly haunting a brightness 
 While mirth had loveliness any life, 
 Or just living in a letter, 
 But that wasn't not sight, 
 Didn't the sun have been bright. 
 It is a moment at last, first, 
 And quietly rayne, we are still 
 Not the person. 
 
 
 
 tenderness without sound of light 
 of man on the
