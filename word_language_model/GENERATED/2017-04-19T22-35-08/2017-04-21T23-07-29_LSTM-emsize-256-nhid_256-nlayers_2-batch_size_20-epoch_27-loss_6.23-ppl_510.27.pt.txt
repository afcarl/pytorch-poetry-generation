No Good, 

 I say where the old dog once smoked 
 Over the storms Tree or cliff? 
 My daughter dwelleth the classroom sought 
 A whisper, breathing nothing 
 My father was talking so tepid, these carve 
 thronging villages in the jet when dewy 
 And through the mind of a grime, 
 This was looking at a time over the road. 
 They didn't know anything. 
 
 
 
 
 At a back of sun 
 someone holds my boots 
 in these
