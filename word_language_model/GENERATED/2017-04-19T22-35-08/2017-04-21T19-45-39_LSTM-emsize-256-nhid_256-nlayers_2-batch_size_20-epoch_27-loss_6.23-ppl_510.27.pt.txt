Sebastian Kept, 

 Weaving on the silent Christmas constellations, 
 parenthesis, nearly heavier 
 by yet clouds written in the scene & the 
 more Deer pass away. To have perhaps 
 a sense of longing, bones, the other tree, the wildest 
 redfoots of flesh and in visor's brain." 
 
 Or the blank shell, or the death of a lone pony 
 now,forever, nor a girl with a wheel shout 
 off dead limbs off through our ballot 
 like those words, open Sunday to snow
