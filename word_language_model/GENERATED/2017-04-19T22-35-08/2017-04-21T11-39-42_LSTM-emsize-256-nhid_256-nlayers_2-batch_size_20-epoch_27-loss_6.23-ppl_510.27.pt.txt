A Rock Conflate 

 Last noon, to another poor Bd 
 Of cuff wave the stars toll the derricks 
 sideslip at the grapes of the midnight 
 bull becomes black and darkest 
 $1,000 to call up flowers as cold grain, 
 bands deep with fighting leaf; 
 From icy rivers of dulled mortality 
 Go nothings. The river commences 
 Gongorism with overawe; Attention and force; 
 White Distil yawns over the town, 
 As though the city jar apart, 
 Capricious Somewhere, Job? 
 Beautiful
