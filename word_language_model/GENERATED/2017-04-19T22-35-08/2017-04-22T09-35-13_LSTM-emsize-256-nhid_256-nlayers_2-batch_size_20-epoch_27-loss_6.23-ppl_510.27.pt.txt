Sunday Day I Go, 

 He always dared to see the more. 
 I hear more beautiful and a bubble 
 I will have to get on the small hill. 
 
 Would my head go? I'm at the far again 
 Where the wind blows so the ash rolled out, 
 Infinite wet, wide, blooms to keep it dear; 
 And there is whole one hour, you desire. 
 What want me to pluck a young overflow, 
 Faint globes in a pool below all things,
