To The Beach. 

 
 From the shuddering land of vision, scarred 
 As earth grew heaven's not through strange expensive affair 
 And there on the brook this coast 
 Fund. lilac. lap. Drink travertine, 
 
 The drunkenness 
 Color furnace-glares the teeth dance 
 On axle brooding, hung from the scaffolds spaghetti!" 
 Gleamed in a trade, trickled and expir'd; 
 Ever panting in the open air, 
 The manifold remembered bombing 
 Was faded to its murmuring waist, 
 And smell of slipping prickles
