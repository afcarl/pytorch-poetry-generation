Death. Let It Come Away. 

 
 
 
 
 Snow draw back the lute, 
 And take off to the path, 
 I'll exercise this way? 
 Blinding white-blank went Mist 
 On finding a man can't find it. 
 
 I want to see I see the sea 
 scream. It makes him Farm," 
 It is as if 
 it's been written light. 
 He gets out with his eyes 
 open, catching white 
 and UP twine, 
 a phonograph, a whirlpool of boats.
