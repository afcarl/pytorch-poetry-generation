Rocks And There, It Is On: 

 vanish? filling with daisies 
 With open and back & hold water 
 As the worms long in the sun's sight 
 And Between them wider than the wild page is, afternoon; pollen 
 Mirrors forming in their rales afternoon, 
 The way the ripples make strong by grey, 
 So the grey tree starts; smothered, and atlas 
 Float into a writer. 
 
 But where the cotton and Quick! blow 
 All night heavy and making go down.
