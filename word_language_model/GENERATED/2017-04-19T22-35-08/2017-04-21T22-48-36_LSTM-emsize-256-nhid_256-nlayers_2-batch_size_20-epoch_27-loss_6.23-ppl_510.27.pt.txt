Above Me 

 basks by a chilly lake, 
 People now changed in the heck! 
 equating clouds and eve, smiling, 
 mass-man big in bed Paris--you 
 Or soaring below the disquieted, 
 Between occasion, and spruce. 
 There park a vase, 
 Full and plastic smell learned 
 
 To have done those were outdoors in successful longest. 
 BONO--SOME troops and smoking above 
 With green drift of the rock-beating new-fall'n 
 beyond. Then there all those past men, 
 A phonograph, an Salty 217.
