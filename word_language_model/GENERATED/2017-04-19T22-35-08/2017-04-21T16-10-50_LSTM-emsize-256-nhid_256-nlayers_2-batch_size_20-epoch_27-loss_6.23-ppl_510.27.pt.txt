 And in that very distant place 
 Suddenly I will drink to required, 
 And Death rightly will not speak, 
 And bring you back and take my hand 
 And wept as long as we are young? 
 In down is hunger! Lowenstein 
 Your blood met deceiving all my winnings 
 pair. The death would pass so well 
 For ever taken by the crowning door, 
 That nymph or you, yields your love your care, 
 In the boil you come, thy blood.
