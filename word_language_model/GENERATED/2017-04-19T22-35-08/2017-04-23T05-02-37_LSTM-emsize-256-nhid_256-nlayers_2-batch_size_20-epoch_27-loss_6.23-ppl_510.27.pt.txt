Petersburg. Meeting. 

 I sit in bed by the Atlantic. 
 
 I have always loved a fiction and stare at the piano, 
 Because I wander through the river for speech I cannot write in the yard, 
 Rings in the change in my world Pointed upon its drive 
 
 And away from the feeling of farm in joy, 
 Beyond the bright faces that is drawn in a hurry 
 Of men sleeping in his floating sail. 
 And those rotten broken eyes of light,
