 to sound the nightingale, 
 and pile across the red, 
 sun crying, then softer 
 than perch on high 
 grass 
 whistles out there spin 
 
 patches of empty powers; 
 
 I fade into design 
 of roads, a thin, 
 bow with a tooth 
 of disaster as intricate 
 as audible quartz 
 seems (Christmas 
 the courtiers 
 lived among all 
 those blank bluff! 
 undressing the children 
 at night 
 will roll up leg and log.
