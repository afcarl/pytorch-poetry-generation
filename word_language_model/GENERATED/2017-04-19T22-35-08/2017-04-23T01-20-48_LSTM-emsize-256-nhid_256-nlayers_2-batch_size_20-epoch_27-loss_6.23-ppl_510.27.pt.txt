Parties, 

 The children of the sailor 
 Whatever they are to bestow. 
 In the world's narrativesâ€” 
 Theirs beauty learn, 
 In a contrite word, 
 And a different line, 
 Is a god, but a pitcher, a woman! 
 But what besides what fathomless sleep 
 Is living every Morn or stylus 
 Of Life and widow's art; 
 With city vote its brother; 
 The Winners Face, the weevil 
 That echoed to the forest burnished with frost, 
 Till, softer than a blue-green
