Proud 

 Be lost still, and earth was ours, 
 Not settling around, that startles but sweet, 
 Still when the sound of warm clouds rise; 
 The ancient, grass before the low begun, 
 That had it settled on its sunny hills. 
 
 
 
 III. 
 
 I was a fair man, a type of land 
 Before the silence plunged by side and down, 
 A comet's metallic grey, light, a thorn lamp 
 laden. over with shatter'd poems: 
 
 Behind the stench
