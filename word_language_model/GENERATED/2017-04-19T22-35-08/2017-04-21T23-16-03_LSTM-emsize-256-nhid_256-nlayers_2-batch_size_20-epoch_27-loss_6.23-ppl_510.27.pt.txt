 All the chimera of God account a note, 
 Some thing each day and none to see this. 
 
 The peering snows 
 seers of green and yellow ys. 
 
 On my First bare unloved hand, 
 Old fields, 
 
 Where are you going like? 
 It was long day. 
 I built in a circle, as usual 
 as my mother's fat moustache 
 Kindling him from the mango, lighter, 
 From the ministrations of moths that glint 
 With its flash in
