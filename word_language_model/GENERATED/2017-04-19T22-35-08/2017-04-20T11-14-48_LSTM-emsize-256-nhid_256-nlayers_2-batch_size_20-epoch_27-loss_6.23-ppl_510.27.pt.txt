Have It Followed 

 In the frozen hut with toast and rivers 
 That in the night, and Palmyra-- 
 Care it's my dreaming while sight that is twenty-five years 
 That sometimes I'd live in peaceful circles 
 The gold I understand 
 musk howl 
 My mind empty of the ocean 
 
 Of day and my bed comes the wind. 
 
 
 
 He is not sure that at Awake 
 be there to be. 
 
 Yea, silence is his eyes, the corn
