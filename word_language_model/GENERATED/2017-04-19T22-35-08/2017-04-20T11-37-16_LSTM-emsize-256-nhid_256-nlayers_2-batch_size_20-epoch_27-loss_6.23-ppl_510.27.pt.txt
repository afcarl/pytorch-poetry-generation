 My gentle flippers avalanching 
 Like cherries with the willows who weep. 
 
 Fallen busses riding west from Unbreachable 
 Miles and high grasses, come not one with me, 
 One on this windy horizon wind, 
 By rest and bright traveller, 
 Full of the dripping sky. 
 Hail! land! 
 Damn'd my girl! 
 Briefly not her weather. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sonnet absolved at the grand Funeral 
 
 
 Mothers and Walker 
 
 Light feeds from Santa commands,
