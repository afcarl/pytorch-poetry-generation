 Once in the dusk of silent there 
 Through which the meadows he could forget, 
 That sometimes perforce, 
 With him who grinned 
 In hemlock he renews the room, 
 Craves what he sings without God's name? 
 
 He asks whether the world is his, 
 
 The land smells in the darkness 
 That crawls about in air: 
 
 The night is come, 
 
 Think it is
