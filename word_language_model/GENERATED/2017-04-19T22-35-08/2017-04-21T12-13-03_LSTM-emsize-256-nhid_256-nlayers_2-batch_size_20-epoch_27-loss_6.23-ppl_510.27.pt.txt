Desire, 

 With rooms what I forgot on thee for thee, 
 It is hav of the life of things. 
 
 This condition is always here -- 
 The theme is not a kind of heart, 
 The attempt to let pass 
 Beneath your eyes like moving blasts together, 
 To keep away now calling at home, 
 In a bottle, neither faint nor free, 
 Be not enough, that to wash them 
 Sitting on their way to save it. 
 
 No great ghostly
