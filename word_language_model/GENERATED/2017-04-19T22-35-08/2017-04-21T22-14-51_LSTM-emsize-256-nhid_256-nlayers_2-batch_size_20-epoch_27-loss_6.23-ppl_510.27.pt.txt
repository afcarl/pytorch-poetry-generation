Lemon, You Drive 

 That smooth onward on the edge of a Cedar 
 Joy is the top of the south. 
 
 Over the river, you stare like a bank of wine 
 And ladde, Round rest with your hair 
 Like a owl on a wordless slugger 
 Or Great childish actress, for the next afternoon 
 In the kinsmen! tall and blue, 
 Show you breath of your own life. 
 What is least you are born 
 
 You don't know such to be
