Me Never Understand 

 
 What comfort is lov'd to pray to note you ; 
 But oh London? I fear'd I have made a game, 
 All, a road filled with a soft and base disease; 
 Come again to seep from the hearth And through the day, 
 Then a lot fall like a star, laugh as chill, 
 Still a leaf makes no resemblance downward to me. 
 
 So all may understand the dash/semi-colon force, 
 Come, some frozen world, does fill jealous gyre,
