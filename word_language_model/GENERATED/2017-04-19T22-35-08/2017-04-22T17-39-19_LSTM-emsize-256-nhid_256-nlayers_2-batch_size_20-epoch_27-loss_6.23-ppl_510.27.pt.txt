The Lesson: Blue 

 Saying, A dream is round of this, a puff of sun 
 That tent at a private heaven and every man 
 And lovers wake to face or to a gas. 
 
 In the first air I will go to bed, weep in my uniform, 
 I see the tree at whirr of his forests, 
 Like the feet of my trembling nest. The stain went later, 
 And the girls have seen no passion in the Dominican heat.
