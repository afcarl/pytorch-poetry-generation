Like A Gang-Boss Angel; 

 Who denies him, an' mostly do pass 
 I cannot sustain until he looks at him 
 In himself a verse of part drank many days: 
 In the middle of an evening tone. 
 
 So shall I stand with the women, like those broad array 
 Of pathways flowers that rise those honey roads once told, 
 As they out of see 
 Of the ten possession of one who sings a way, 
 And with men in the joy, may
