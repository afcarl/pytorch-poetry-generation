For Silence,) 

 I hope I am waiting to be hurt 
 And be with home demons 
 To do, which are my poems to be waiting for, 
 tourism, another sleepless moon, no flowing, 
 Apples? It is just one 
 Of this lucky life, but that is true. 
 How small they strove for any delight 
 There would be reason of the deathâ€” 
 
 From this marble month we grew more night 
 For their study-door, sidewalkspage 
 Or lovers with one taste scatter
