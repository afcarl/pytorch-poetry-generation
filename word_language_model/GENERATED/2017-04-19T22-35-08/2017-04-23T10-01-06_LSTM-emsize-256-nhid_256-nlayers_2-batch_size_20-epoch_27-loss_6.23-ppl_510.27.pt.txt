Out The Moon. 

 
 With everything and woman. 
 
 They stare more easy, there is no spot 
 Outside, in drain unto the hill; 
 To the prison before a little age 
 About the War armament, pushed â€“ 
 The poor three sparsely Stone. Outside, like the midnight 
 soaking stillness under the tightness 
 A swan dines to the secret nose, 
 The bricks of earthen Gart 
 While the filing gales of the rough bass Theer's 
 Over the choirs of the T'ang;
