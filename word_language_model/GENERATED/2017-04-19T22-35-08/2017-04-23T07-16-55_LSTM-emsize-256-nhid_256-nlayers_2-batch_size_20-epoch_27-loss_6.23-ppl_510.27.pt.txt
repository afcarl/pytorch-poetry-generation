After All. 

 In an island 
 I watched by the right window shed 
 wrapping my way back to the window. 
 I am adored the darker kind of desire, 
 receivership, I failed them, or you with another voice 
 The millennium; from the last chapter is placed 
 Into the clear pain of root 
 And rain retell out, 
 Everywhere as my days Prick, 
 Is weeping in this dark face. 
 
 imperfections. boarded-up rimshot 
 In hand, they were perpetually birds
