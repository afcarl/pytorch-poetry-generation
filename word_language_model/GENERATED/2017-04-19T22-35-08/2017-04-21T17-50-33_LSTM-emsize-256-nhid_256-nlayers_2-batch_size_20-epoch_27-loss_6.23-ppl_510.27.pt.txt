Smoke. 

 
 Behind me when some evenings inherits 
 To chafe, a song for fifty years again! 
 That with no music all's to be 
 prevented. silence, I think 
 Sanctus that cooks at the ice 
 Full of cleanly Quakers 
 And a leaf's telling me the city 
 In a kind lots of two lives and drinks 
 At least having a promising way up the day 
 Two miles of corn . . . Oh . . . 
 Now Marmalade no more
