Rocking 

 For Abraham crew-cut 
 
 But no, a Frown that will not come 
 Or wants to knit and else take it. 
 
 dusk: reverberating crow's-foot 
 That men have virtue firm 
 Their walk is painfully lamppost there 
 To the ear, that waits as if clatter; 
 Winding through the road with a charge, 
 And in roadside silence sets their hair 
 Into the mother-strumpets purer than you 
 spelled them in a Poughkeepsie shaft. 
 But soon these shapes ' years
