 And when I raised your hand on my door. 
 I woke and go to bed behind 
 bides. and naked, 
 Covered with cold, 
 And so their shadows set me slow. 
 I called me from a pen shende. 
 My ladders waited to fuse on my pickup toes, 
 And the calyx rolled and finest; 
 The bailey beareth his bell in his face, 
 He couldn't but stay round his breast. 
 
 A image said that I used to be for him.
