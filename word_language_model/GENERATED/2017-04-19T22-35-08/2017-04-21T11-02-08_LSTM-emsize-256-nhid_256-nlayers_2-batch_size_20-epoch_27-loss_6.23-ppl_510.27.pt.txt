A Sacred Place, 

 Nothing but men and food, 
 And because they would express 
 
 Upon the gardens of the statue 
 They sail the darken'd sounds, and fall 
 For long before they have forgotten the world. 
 It comes alive against the rabbit's ice-cube nest 
 Is drawn. The big boats laugh like those access 
 With flying Pacific-- 
 But I say, De and hate 
 No one or old, history; 
 Give me, honey some-body 
 And said there's nothing to use
