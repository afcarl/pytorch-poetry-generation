Too Great To Go 

 Summer Blis. Under the wide bed. 
 
 And I shall not land, but if that I thought 
 I could not be weak. What should I have to know 
 What I could do from from my way aright. 
 I don't dance and be just so white but myself 
 And we drive quite daily forward as nothing. 
 A sixth itchy on me too noisy, wind over me.
