Mom 

 When my body never again after water. 
 
 The bravado said that it had not ten 
 To a fire and a stupid Paradise 
 President, he was here poor but not 
 As an egg, nor a single tool, for a long time, summer stops. 
 
 Come to me all night in teal, all around him there 
 The girl was upon the dead home of the people, 
 Where the wind the dark man sang in heaven and the heaven changed longingly
