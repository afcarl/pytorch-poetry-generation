 
 And even the strange, part of the world 
 Fold the stones that held up from 
 those living walls, their hands filled 
 With candles and unclouded shades, 
 And only out all night night. 
 
 And still I walked along with backs, 
 With carrion blood, the glad tree cries, 
 The whole balm grow in its cadence 
 When climbing light began to refrain 
 Far down, come down with what place 
 Are the chestnut flesh of the light 
 Still
