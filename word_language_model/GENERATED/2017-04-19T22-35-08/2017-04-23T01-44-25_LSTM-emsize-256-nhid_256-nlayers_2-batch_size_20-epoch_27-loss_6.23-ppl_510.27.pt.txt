Lets It Rest To Be 

 Stuck and hammer next to anger and be given, 
 illimitable, 
 Each step near thee; wherever it is I. 
 The Great moments are going home. 
 
 sortaient charity beautiful honored, and bedazzling numbers, 
 Welcome to furnish home your intensity, 
 A small weak library for the skinned new vision suspicion 
 Like all the truthfulness of vinyl against and CEOs. 
 But I, come, Covetous or is my fate, Get 
 My explorer this way out of it,
