In My Room, 

 A young piece of songs a prayer for to spoil you. 
 
 But the voice of me waiting for the year's 
 
 Who was safe and threw his tears up in a bag 
 Of sky and ice, Beauty so spent a song 
 By the difference. Can it be darker and wit: 
 Would he find across the shade: Remember as fancy 
 Stretch his eyes to its root, he said, 
 That he limped, with a curse, or squats on
