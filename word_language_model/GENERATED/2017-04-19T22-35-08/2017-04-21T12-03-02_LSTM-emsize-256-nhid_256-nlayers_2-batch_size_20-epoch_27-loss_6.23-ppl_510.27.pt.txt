 For I have discussed through the woods 
 Up to the side of his wonder: 
 I know men wove, Jesus for grid. 
 The first rushing always in my twenties, 
 gather's like a jewel, 
 That we affords from our own horizontal hands, 
 A scrap of reeds and lights it shriek'd, 
 Strong creeping from its Night, and felt 
 lillyes and clothes— blowing ether 
 Till light, by games and light—angelic, 
 A falcon for cargoes. 
 
 And who, in fiery folds
