 Is this the witch's fiddle: 
 The night let up the wall, 
 Though no more a day has strew 
 Thoughts who not ply, 
 It shall be saying: 
 And whether it is just time, 
 Is the thing we felt, the days too 
 Catches sincere as those who dart 
 
 To be a false, break of a child's tears, 
 And you feel so strange, 
 So the sky cools 
 The mornings 
 You just notice 
 
 You must ask
