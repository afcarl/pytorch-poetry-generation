 
 How the gift of the dawn loves its prey 
 
 Mazoue, image of the good earth, 
 
 Be as a token of the alms of the dog, 
 
 Like the quarry-slave of your sphere, 
 
 The sweet disease. - this the house 
 
 Plainer You, lord and soul, 
 
 And - in plantes 
 Laughed on either bed when you gaze, 
 
 Don't you be so haunted corydon -- 
 
 The sun shudders overâ€”namelessly.
