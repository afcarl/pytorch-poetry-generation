 Leave it, the Milk but the mouthing of my graces; 
 None will be they truly sore, I am Debauchee 
 Of life and the continent of cool, 
 A wonderful gray entity that but not far 
 As beyond the outer night, 
 Not a small drop of stones nor broken, 
 a single breath of lettuce light 
 
 And time remain a time to object to hell. 
 
 
 
 Awakened too early 
 
 they can think they were easy, just as
