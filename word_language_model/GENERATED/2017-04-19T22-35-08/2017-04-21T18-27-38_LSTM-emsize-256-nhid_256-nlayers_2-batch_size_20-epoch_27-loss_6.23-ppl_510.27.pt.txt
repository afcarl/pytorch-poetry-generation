For The Fact. 

 Wise tales I've odd, minutes of sleep 
 you shall pray, 
 You will hurt you 
 of you and donâ€™t understand. 
 
 I'll never let you out 
 the poet's pictures on your jutting hand. 
 But the two of strangers, too, have you been very bitter, 
 but as to rise or go; 
 so do you make. 
 
 Flow yourself into Contempts, 
 distrest cat 
 grace 
 
 your accompaniment your blessing 
 will keep the same
