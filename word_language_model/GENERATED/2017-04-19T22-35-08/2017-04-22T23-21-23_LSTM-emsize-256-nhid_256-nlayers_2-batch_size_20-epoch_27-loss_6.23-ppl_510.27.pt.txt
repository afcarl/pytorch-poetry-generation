Love? 

 
 Be the ibuprofen and the Pacific teacher 
 From the cop AirWaterEarthFire 
 He sank. Me, a few bread slipped over 
 A smaller stump of cows. No lack 
 Of the coil one day, matter not to die 
 Before engrossed by a voice to sow 
 They're like the stream that rubs 
 The ocean all along the hall. 
 Looking below. A oar sunk to ground 
 sorcerors them. We'll 
 be as spirited up by, knowing 
 ten-ton blue in waves
