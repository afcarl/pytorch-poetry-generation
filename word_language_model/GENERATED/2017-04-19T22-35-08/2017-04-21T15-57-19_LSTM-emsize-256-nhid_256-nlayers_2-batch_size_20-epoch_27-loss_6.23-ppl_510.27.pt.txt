 Your old man, trees, hurrying dew, 
 Out long stuff of beach and woods, 
 A handful of rocks, and heard there is light. 
 
 
 
 As we look beneath the dying spaces. 
 What kind of dog wants can be loved 
 To make the journey Satellite 
 As children carry on the road 
 Gladys really" 
 Would not dread the chance of view? 
 Where bears you in with a affronted places 
 Rings and hum. 
 
 But the beautiful rebuff
