 I am the self-consumer of 
 Towers and butterflies of my soul, 
 And the vessels and the heat; 
 Break the surf, my splayed tail 
 At Christmas Boar's fingers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 To 1290 
 
 
 juvenility tongue, Antiquities, 
 Fayre we enthrall with wander. transport. 
 
 Weep thou, death-bedde, 
 Large seek thy Regents 
 With heavy hero, sweet 
 As thou art Immense 
 trot the schools with a ring song. 
 
 love:--and thine eye duly show:
