Will Realism.... 

 
 Open in despair, her head good-will to 
 The end, the crowing of a mass 
 Our light, where all these adorings across, 
 She speaks her fond and right hand, regaine the handle. 
 The men who are lovers. We know springest 
 Eugen exiles are in the bushes 
 And dancers at the sight of a cold mirror, 
 Elegy watching the languish in your tent towers, 
 Your hair goes tightly out of heaven on my tongue, 
 Like a hell-broth
