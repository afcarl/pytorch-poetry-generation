Towards Deeper Than We Should Go On It, 

 So that we're dead remembering what I have won alone 
 This afternoon to do the war on your way, 
 
 God, how our great oars seek us a week to hear 
 In the reflected lake of forties and good-doers of color, 
 nobbut retreatâ€” and his posts have shine, 
 That's more than any other man, the world is lord, 
 They should have been, but it must seeche to take the sight 
 Of justice,
