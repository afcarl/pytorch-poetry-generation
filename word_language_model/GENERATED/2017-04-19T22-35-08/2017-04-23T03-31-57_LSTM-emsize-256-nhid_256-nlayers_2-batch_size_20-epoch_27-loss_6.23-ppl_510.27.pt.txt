Puts It Away: 

 
 Hot in the water, held from creeping hands without hand; 
 nifty. fruitage of tropical Austria Quips 
 Make you leave the rifle thru the factories, 
 "I've got the smell of rice. 
 The phosphorescent green grape, 
 Soft nuts to ease me from Baal; 
 And Saint . . . 
 
 Over the plane sky 
 
 The moon comes 
 It resembles itself 
 from the cockpit 
 
 a table in the street 
 
 Scotch, the neighborhood
