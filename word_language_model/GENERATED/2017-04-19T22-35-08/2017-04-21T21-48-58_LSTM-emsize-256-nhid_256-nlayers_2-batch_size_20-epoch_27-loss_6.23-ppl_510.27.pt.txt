A Lie. 

 But if no bomb turned groome, 
 Though maps before a mission 
 All might be sunk from life. 
 
 
 
 Don't put your substance down, 
 bare electric Leon lots, 
 not it read, it looks so long 
 to reconciling our other 
 while how the steam glistens 
 in our foreheads store 
 
 my eyes set by the wall 
 which contains only the blindness. 
 How strange is I never won 
 than us hate what you know
