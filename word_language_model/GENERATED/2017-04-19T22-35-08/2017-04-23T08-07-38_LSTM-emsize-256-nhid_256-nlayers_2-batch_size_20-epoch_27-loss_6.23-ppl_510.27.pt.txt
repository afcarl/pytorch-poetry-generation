 
 In the long, great days of summer, 
 The world flares on the rising earth, 
 It was sweet and dumb with the sea, 
 And the memory of men and women, 
 Sits sturdy in the barns of our graves, 
 And the sombre tract of soaking length 
 Poured on the long hearse and is gone. 
 There must be gaining time, blocks out 
 The beach of the woof of a pool in the sky. 
 
 That will arise and checked stumps
