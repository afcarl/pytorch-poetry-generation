On The Head-- 

 
 The same o'clock life now says ballads 
 are far by love 
 elsewhere, 
 draperies and dead man 
 
 holds a path so white 
 but somehow in the arms of the forest's 
 chalk laughter 
 he's stirring, it's 
 
 so content to be been 
 lying on and back over glass for weeks 
 which can 
 never have seemed up, not 
 afraid or was it nothing but simply did 
 
 you have come away
