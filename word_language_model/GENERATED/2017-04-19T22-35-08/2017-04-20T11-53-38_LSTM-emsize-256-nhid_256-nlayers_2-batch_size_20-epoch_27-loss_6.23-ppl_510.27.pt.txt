 This is an owl of snow 
 While maple leaves 
 Gleam toward us 
 Hovers like impact 
 No eye of lakes 
 Like the earth on excluding despair, 
 simile. O Lord, 
 That has broken night) 
 All vast dead trees 
 Doth the flow in the west turn Pride. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Astrophil to cow-pasture. 
 
 
 Shadow that mend the braes, 
 We passed her garments roos a votive flood, 
 Iron feathers destroy.
