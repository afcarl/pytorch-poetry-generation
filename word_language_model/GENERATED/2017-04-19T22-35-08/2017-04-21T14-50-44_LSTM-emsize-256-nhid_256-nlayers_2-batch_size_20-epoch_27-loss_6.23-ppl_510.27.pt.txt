Escapes Far -- 

 I do not sleep in wolde, 
 The witty knocked up me for days. 
 
 Maybe your excuse are so beautiful or grey; 
 Knowing your face good and gypsum, 
 bluegill: can bring the light 
 MOLE, from any stem, 
 For the bulging face of the open end. 
 Nor if the heart of her, 
 Not for any time of years, 
 And to the tenant of your mother 
 In which we and then you met; 
 The stone
