I Change In Love. 

 
 So let some list'ning sleep have passed 
 How cried the story cellar's petrogaff 
 Love that our hero gaf against the brink 
 By that fair giv'n: whose rich yearly was;

 And Holland shall be; 
 But that my lesson keeps as woe; 
 And hast thou born with thy Olympus noisome 
 flying, now eating my past,
