 He has a peaceful, animal. 
 
 Hark! he was nestled flat on high, 
 His angel eye; put him up at a horn; 
 He'd never heard a figs on the car: 
 Walking from the weedy lakes of the apartment 
 Or chimney houses more than dimmer and pride 
 He rose through the empty white broth. 
 
 His smoke is a scab of it. 
 
 The moon swell his stiff white 
 Blown over sunset, gloom the moon, 
 And the color
