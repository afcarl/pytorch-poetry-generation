 His tongue over my face, 
 He has brushed a hand out at the door 
 Just armed and so softly toll ... 
 I had balance my tune and stopping, 
 placard as he cannot speak, but it would reveald, 
 Smooth in a bitter bliss, as with a plashy beard 
 As he began 
 Yet he holds everything, a dark boy 
 Counts the ni flower in the eyes 
 That makes my heart and their true race 
 Over skis. fields of working
