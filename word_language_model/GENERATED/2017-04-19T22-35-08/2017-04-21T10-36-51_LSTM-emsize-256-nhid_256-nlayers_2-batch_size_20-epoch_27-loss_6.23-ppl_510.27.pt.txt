To Flee Upon The Halls; 

 And we wound so kiss, and the good samples sometimes 
 Acoctes, responsible for the time of things. 
 
 Or we lie to hear not where what they do. 
 
 When he was struck by the river 
 And their parents were dead; 
 The dogs poured high in the trash, 
 And the fireflies grew wild as spears. 
 
 They were buttoned in up and stayed. 
 We have used it to live 
 And consecrate the rain.
