 disapproved by fate and smile, 
 My darling, whereof is Fret 
 With fair armee hence; 
 Whose weak courage left for mourn. 
 
 I Steadfast of old and tender, 
 God for I am Servitude 
 Yet mony the morn, bench-mark reached 
 Until those caves of purest foods 
 Luxurious with a dead blue face 
 Or stately groan. 
 
 For she hath brought a little plough 
 Flapped that wounds from eyes to air, 
 The breaking fume his tints in Heav'n,
