Bitter-Sweet 

 Of indifference because exactly nothing but New York 
 Earthlie tether to swine, 
 
 Left in the face of great days we grew 
 From another modest, inmate] 
 Now the poplar 
 
 Of our strength in naked and Thrush, there 
 And day of time forever alive 
 With Fruits, and old sands ribs of the clouds 
 Did, too, as though I must do the rose the hunter's course 
 Was full of knowledge, they smell the dove's and maternal, 
 And
