 And Little minorities. 
 To-night 
 
 When the sun is dry, 
 I kissed 
 It is lost 
 Yet pain, 
 With the fountain-- 
 And a heart that goes on. 
 With a short lift round window the leaves 
 Of a right hand 
 And the bright broken image 
 Of my dejection 
 God is beating in, 
 
 I should have loved my sister, 
 And afterward I lie 
 Down across the headlights 
 And the shout of my carols
