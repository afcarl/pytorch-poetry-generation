Came West. 

 
 The block ran, the last needles huge hands framed 
 on halved living edge sours 
 
 salamanders, 
 
 Look! my perfect totems dug, 
 
 I saw; detested sounds am biting on the sore, 
 
 fingers seen like weather down. I am gone. 
 I remember my seraphim, past that possible 
 
 freaked, 
 And spirit bash Epigrams Gone 
 
 As I walk by my soul. Now passing on the walls, 
 
 my hair 
 
 & cracks,
