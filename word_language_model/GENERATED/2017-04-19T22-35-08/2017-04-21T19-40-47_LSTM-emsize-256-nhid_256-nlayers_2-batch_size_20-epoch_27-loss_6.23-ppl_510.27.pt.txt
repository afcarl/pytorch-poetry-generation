Blood! 

 A bustle of sorts is bright with its peers, 
 And the angels spotted their husky arms 
 Of thine. 
 
 He laid in a power 
 Who saw the black sea's boom in the eye 
 And the sun its robes. follow, 
 The ladies of love, the throbbing things, 
 May be dealt as the trim-coifed Robes 
 Green, the proud man the soldier die in a restaurant, 
 Who brings him to us in with his well-known mate 
 And the clouds
