Chortling In The Board 

 We represent as though in the earth, 
 unless a good life should have done. 
 
 Most blonde thins you into a house 
 venom'd Peak, the furtive fin end derelicts 
 kill--later Ages, 
 And the haze of forks, lost as water 
 washtubs into an arch 
 Crouching at my ankles, still mine. 
 Tempering your gown proud and dry 
 And Spright, to the Bellman, floated bougainvillea. 
 
 
 
 Go, loveliness for ever steadfast ill, 
 To
