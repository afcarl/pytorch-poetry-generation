And Lonesome-Like 

 at the end of his head, 
 Amadis, 
 gone, the cold wry concentration 
 applied to the dr√°w gate. 
 
 My mouth 
 army: hands, soft as sunlight 
 waxed as glass, thick-banded delivery 
 male stones turned to each breath. 
 
 
 And then, to the woods are there 
 in those vortex places 
 dripping thru yours, where 
 evening comes my fill 
 
 the imperceptible trees 
 go straight to cheer my mouth 
 and split my breast
