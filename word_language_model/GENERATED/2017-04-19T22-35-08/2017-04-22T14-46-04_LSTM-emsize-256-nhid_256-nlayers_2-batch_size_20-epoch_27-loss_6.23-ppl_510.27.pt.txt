Brother Is Always A Single Sunny. 

 I find away the first lessons 
 of my sleeping brothers and light 
 hunting on the cedar. I dreamed 
 of eight thousand years later I met 
 at my knees, 
 nostril. Antiochus, above 
 leaf, pale walls as I sit 
 above this new signal 
 
 in electric darkness: I would 
 eat since sweat their acted babies 
 yammering through themselves, 
 as ever they unfold 
 the wedding price of every straw, 
 and it's
