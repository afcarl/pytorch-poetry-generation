Porches 

 And Penelope to their human parts. 
 
 And the man tremble up to Paris, 
 The Palms of his bearnum, 
 The Childs trees, the falling-back 
 Of the rack that cheered arcs and 
 
 Resting windows, over blind to care. 
 
 He looks like a distant tree. 
 
 The vessel of light 
 Lay up to sleep without a hand 
 We make vestments in the waters 
 From a pulse so tight and tilted still. 
 Its light is hard
