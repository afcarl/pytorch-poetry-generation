 Who is sure, over the last, and thus, 
 Sighs for yuchi laces 
 alike in bank." 
 
 This is all literary comfort, 
 The sweet man pulse's Palette 
 And eat his eye & drip 
 Their heads with man's chevyssaunce. 
 
 The queen of saints is dead. 
 
 The faceless feeling from the poor 
 Who wait for thee, though they are buried. 
 
 And moving turbulence the perfect one! 
 Look at the house.
