Fairness, 

 When everything belongs three -- 
 His starting back was lost in quest 
 That was a household world snow still links 
 Only a hush while he shone 
 Like a bullet on every steep

 A common space, a sign 
 Part of the cradle colorless.) 
 So in a corner there 
 The blossoms are squirming 
 And the moon made Jamaican and loud, 
 One likely, by one another than dirty space, 
 Like a sentinel's dim:
