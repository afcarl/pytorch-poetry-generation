The Ice. 

 
 When with ants come at this corner 
 I wove old trunk dominoes. 
 
 Downhill and pink as a turnip rose, 
 Which rushes, lord, no wind, skyline. 
 Well do you wanna go? 
 enamel as gleams waved, wane, 
 Dark night of spring Street bathrobe, 
 On the sterile Sabbath threshold 
 Near belt as it could have been Sewing as blood. 
 
 Something in the house distance but life! enkindled, 
 prurience to what? Where is my heart
