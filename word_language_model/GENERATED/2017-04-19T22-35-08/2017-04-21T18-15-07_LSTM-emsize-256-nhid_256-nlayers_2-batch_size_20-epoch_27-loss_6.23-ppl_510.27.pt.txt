 The pestilence of crocus, I have no place to tell 
 Or be your startling choice is strange. 
 And it is Slow, you forget what you happen for, 
 Is this the cloak of my husband's maelode, life. 
 What the little: has been fouled wind-enamoured carmines, Dante 
 And afterward I twinkled! it on water without bull. 
 
 
 
 
 
 A Smile and Bat of the maiden 
 
 
 False vast branches 
 I play to lower where I would answer.
