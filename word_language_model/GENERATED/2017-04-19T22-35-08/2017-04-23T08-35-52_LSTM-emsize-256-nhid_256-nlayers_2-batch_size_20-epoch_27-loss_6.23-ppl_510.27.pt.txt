 The system, courage moves 
 Cantatas, him. It doesnâ€™t place for loss 
 Or do. Here is the giant mouths 
 Of the war. I sit. The hand has stopped. 
 
 Robinson is made of blood 
 Singing in the amber air, 
 A speck behind unawares, 
 And twist abruptly 
 Her coat over her. 
 As we wave someone out of it 
 A light darkens upon 
 With a devil clothed no one.
