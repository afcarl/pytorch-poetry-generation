The Perfect 

 shirts and calves, and bald beers, warm 
 In a brown cone of white cubes fresh from waking, 
 disc through silk limits of the sea that slid 
 Soon first, and straight 107

 Infinite veiled in winter's great region 
 Enormous up the sky. 
 
 Under a stretch as polished planet, 
 Small warning and quick cane; 
 The low finger of her ears so restlessly 
 Had exhalant;
