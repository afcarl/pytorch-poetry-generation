Or Return, Or Could Break Across Our Hands, 

 And speak between us all of them to our wives 
 As the white tree swings and made a dead hum alone; 
 As we lose the smooth steps, autopiloted, 
 To describe the shell of drowning animals 
 And streaks the thick blood is darker out in Fushimi 
 Or edges noise phlegm shimmer themselves in our broken chairs, 
 
 And 
 Except the grass rose below the mountain. 
 The mounds Quality: cracked and lords,
