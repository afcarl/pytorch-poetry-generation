 
 You sunk in the wind boors 
 And brandished an inch. 
 Poor woman fears 
 Midway to big dry nails, 
 Feeling 
 On a reel like dust. 
 
 
 
 There is no other silence, nothing for me is behind, 
 but not to feed you now, and be beautiful. 
 Get me just. 
 Here is an arrow from the stubble 
 And each evening a number of life, 
 A deep act of the feeling than you do, 
 Sad as
