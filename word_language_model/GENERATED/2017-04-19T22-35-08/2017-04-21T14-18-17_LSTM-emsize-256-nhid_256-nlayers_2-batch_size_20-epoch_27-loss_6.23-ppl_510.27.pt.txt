Cut Each 

 In my hand gently for a rain. 
 
 I saw them first go out and look at me, 
 And I went to sleep about the house, capital 
 Besides the guns in the fields, 
 I held a sneer on my arm 
 And lay it tenderly, and I grew 
 to my right and listening 
 
 For the last thing in the background 
 Of the island or grazing water 
 Which the bird might not have taken rid of his
