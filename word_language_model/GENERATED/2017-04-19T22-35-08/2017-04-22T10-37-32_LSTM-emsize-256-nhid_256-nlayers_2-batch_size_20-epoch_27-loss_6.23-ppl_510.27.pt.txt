 
 Sometimes I guess that is dust 
 crispd with sun & cattail request: 
 And he glides along the baker's cellar 
 In walls and set up my hands, 
 In the shape of my Greek life. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Hunting 
 
 
 gowns; true pleasure 
 painting other shape, 
 
 that separation 
 It 
 
 scorned with hands; 
 log! 
 young 
 men in this city! 
 
 I cut dry 
 and sweet left in spotted
