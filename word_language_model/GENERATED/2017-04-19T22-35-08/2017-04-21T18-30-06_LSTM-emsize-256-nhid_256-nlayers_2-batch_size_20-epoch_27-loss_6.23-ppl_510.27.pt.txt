The Grape Pale Pearly Bow. 

 So, I'll make a dance and not be rest, 
 Dreaming in the late air, 
 In me every night is a dream; 
 Not to be warned for her, not the care of Whereto 
 Nor me feel me alone at the charge of my spirit! 
 
 Roaming 
 This chilly child, high-laced love of the guilt, 
 This solitude sings as it goes. 
 I will never scorn his mate ago: 
 No more I fool how cold berserkness.
