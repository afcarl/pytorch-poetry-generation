 
 Conqueror old palace and the heard frame. 
 The dream of the choir swathed in tie, 
 The snows of the wind-mill--only clown, 
 But unknown to the chalice of men 
 Kick on death's labor, facing between 
 The fruit-tree silver leaves of owls 
 Red and serene, the patient shuttle, 
 Swathed by the golden moon, from home, 
 By whose arches there to cold memory 
 Love's tinsel horn upon the crest 
 Smiles through the shallows of the sea.
