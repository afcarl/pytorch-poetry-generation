Sell Ted Not 

 What I know 
 By all, all the rude laws that remain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 To Mississippi Century Park 
 
 
 Awake, live in the sky toilets 
 Mysterious upon ourselves, 
 Unseen the bright weeds of the skies, 
 And the car-edge phantoms kind, 
 And the laughing shore which in sunlight, under the rim 
 Of the ocean's roundish seek the phrase 
 Go and mare with the sand, the rifle on the beach, 
 With rapid dew
