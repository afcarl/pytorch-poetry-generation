Pseudo- 

 
 That the soul donâ€™t send me further, 
 I am not by young forehead: I sing. 
 At door I see a broken face, and then 
 emitted across the islands at random, 
 Some windy gates of crush things still have been, 
 May there be beautiful music would go on mine. 
 
 Where there are little gardens above, 
 And women more than Guatemala. . . . 
 
 Oh, these were women and ones 
 The Poet, poor sheep and geese
