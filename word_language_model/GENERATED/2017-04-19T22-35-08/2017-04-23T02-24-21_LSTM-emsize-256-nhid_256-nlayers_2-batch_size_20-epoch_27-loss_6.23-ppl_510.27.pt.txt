Wroth; 

 
 And the queen continues to town that mechanism 
 About the heavens can grow as faces or 
 wish. 
 
 But canal evening West, 
 pointing to Jesus? 
 When the body swirls through the streets. 
 An eagle tail and justified. And the party 
 
 Keeps the shadow of birches 
 And the umpire stood in a Field 
 For the tunes, sang for such delight, 
 Oversleep, before his laughter 
 Has come to the mariner's Church, 
 Another pleasant frame
