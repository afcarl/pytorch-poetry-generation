 Like the north through a deep gray 
 And one quite little bird, knowing 
 How in the dry room grew comfort. 
 secretly: scatted . . . 
 But three girls banked at themselves. 
 For time we lay for choosy, tears 
 Could the stars surround us, but they there, 
 deep falls into the blackening air. 
 
 Far out Hippogrif tall and bate-breeding 
 Names aching and great, 
 With plums. 
 Winds bring grot on over unknown eternity. 
 
 gullah nuts
