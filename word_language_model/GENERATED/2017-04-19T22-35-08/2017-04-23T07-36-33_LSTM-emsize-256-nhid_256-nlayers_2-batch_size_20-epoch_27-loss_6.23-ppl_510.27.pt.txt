 furze, everyone's distinctions 
 In London, but to rain, 
 And leave their stick 
 Is nighs; 
 
 
 
 
 
 I 
 
 And the 7, Horror sent me both by a horde in my hand and it is 
 bioluminescence to me, dirty with Santa degradation. 
 How the cats flash and did obey his name in April 
 When the ice eat, and the children, touch of yellow smoke, 
 And the frivolous time air drives cliffs o'er the eternal hold.
