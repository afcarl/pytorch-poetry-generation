Voices Like Eagles Addrest. 

 
 How could my love came Therefore 
 I expose me now, for it is late, 
 This is the dream of my death, 
 In every wind the nebulous lands 
 And shade their wings and howl'd: the corn 
 And so mournful many a feeling. 
 
 
 
 The smoke runs, though in the morning trees. 
 It seemed to turn amid the liquid 
 Where lines shoot out in scream and flank of ridgepole, 
 Inspired ran in miles
