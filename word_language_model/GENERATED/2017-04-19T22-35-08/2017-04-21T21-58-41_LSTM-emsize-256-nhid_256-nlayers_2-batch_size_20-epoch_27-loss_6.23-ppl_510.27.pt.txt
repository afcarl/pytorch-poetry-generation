Shuttle 

 dulcimer; simple, peach. 
 
 
 It is always that as though 
 it’s how of the beloved, the shadows 
 of dove-wings the Eyelash may pray. 
 I ask why I see only dream 
 
 I'm going to a team perfectly put 
 beneath my heels, thinking about worse, 
 wondering if without my parents’ dog, 
 Good I've got to destroy 
 every frills and Illinois. 
 
 How that directly goes out, 
 how a crack can go off 
 the shuttle
