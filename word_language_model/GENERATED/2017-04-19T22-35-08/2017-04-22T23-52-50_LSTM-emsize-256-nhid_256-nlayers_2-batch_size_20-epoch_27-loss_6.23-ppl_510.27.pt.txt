The Same; 

 A naked thing, present, which may be good. 
 We have to wake the music today 
 
 And so that spurn them are falling friends 
 Who surely must let each man blow, 
 
 And then his gushing face, and then poppies, 
 
 Will never last, as history. His lips are fluttered-- 
 
 With ice and silver half-distinguished 
 
 Lend his eyes onward from shut, 
 Close, go toward the sea by groise 
 Up and on the broken valleys.
