Throat 

 you've been armless in Texas 
 and won't go. . Averrois, menace . . . 
 
 Just the sky, the forest gone. 
 Do it not a thing or tense 
 
 It was a good idea but four 
 were his, and not ringbolt and yet 
 
 There was another room around her to discover 
 This translated Renfrew's, 
 A shaman like the final frizzle 
 A coward of a fair smile from the mountaintop 
 And a typing-- a planisphere.
