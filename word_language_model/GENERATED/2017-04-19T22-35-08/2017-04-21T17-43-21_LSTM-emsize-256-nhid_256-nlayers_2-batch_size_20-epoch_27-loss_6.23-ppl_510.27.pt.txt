The Huts Of 

 New Davis loves to a stolid walk, 
 dimeless the heart, like a former sign. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Giant Images 
 
 
 In mercy of space, 
 The Pilgrim and the star-spangled Same mates 
 Are ready, as six uniforms, 
 It is full of law. 
 I wish I didn't know what they knew 
 To love what I owe you here? 
 But --Now to what could you? 
 There his most people, soon be kind.
