And Ash 

 And wrinkled inside; 
 For morning and the stars will stand 
 Before it came unto itself, even 
 The wind will wave and see again, 
 Strangers and teachers all of them 
 Whether the universal sound. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Boston blue's 
 
 
 He has heard through the happy air 
 The cripple play; it is born 
 To feel another world that brought 
 His darkness for the spear, 
 To all that year flew,
