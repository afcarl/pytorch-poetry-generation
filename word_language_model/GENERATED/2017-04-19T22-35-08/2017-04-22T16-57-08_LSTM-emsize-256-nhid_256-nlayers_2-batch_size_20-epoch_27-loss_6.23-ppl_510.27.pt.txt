Pleased To Make Me 

 calm but another so deep would be read. 
 
 I am painful with Lynn gentle!) mire: 
 I shall forget the human being 
 wrought. 
 O little book, no fire in my mouth, 
 But I am happy, remote, clear and green 
 Quick as an aging bird for Sondayes 
 (and as I shouteth: I drop back 
 To the winds and flower whence you roll a picture of pleasure, 
 And the world has whispered more from the invents).
