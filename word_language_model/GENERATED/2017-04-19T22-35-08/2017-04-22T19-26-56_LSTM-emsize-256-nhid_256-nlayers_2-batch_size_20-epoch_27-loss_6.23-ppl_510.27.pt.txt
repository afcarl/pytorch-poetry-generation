Long After White, 

 & no one was searching for for the moment. 
 Still mad, wasn't just to breathe 
 you have given Labrers you the scare, 
 the red and red waist which my eyes 
 are hers gone slippers, trailing 
 indistinguishably remains only life; childishly, 
 and shaking your face 
 and shapes into the words, behind me 
 dry faring among your inches from them 
 sweet as a clinging to curling off 
 a door for flight, and know not yet.
