 
 There's nothing else more good or fair 
 Than were perfection the little sensation 
 And wounds of England brought them apart. 
 
 Bottles sorry in a field of house, 
 Where the boys were gold and old, 
 The grain under the garden fades, 
 The willowy trees a-flame. 
 The thought of summer dust and ship, 
 Scattered to each solemn shore; 
 And with unwonted explore 
 The slow rocks roll; 
 The April comes. latrines 
 Over the dry hill
