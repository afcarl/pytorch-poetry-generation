And I Left, 

 He by the cry of love is gone. 
 
 All earth is closed and lonely, 
 In washing velvet doughty-in-combat 
 An armature on the reef, 
 Shakes & blurred as a dark wood. 
 Meaning that when I gaze out inside. 
 
 When I set out our voices, 
 Amid the narrow long-stemmed rain, 
 I sat so long again; 
 And at the rainbow blowing the swift 
 Runs out its eyes. 
 
 attainâ€™d, See how it lost
