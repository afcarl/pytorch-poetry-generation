The Red Chime Swoop 

 probing Lizzie: It is my life, 
 Someplace is rushed into case and sleep? 
 Then sir, I grill love and light is becoming, 
 I have written somewhere in the grainâ€”pig 
 decorations and begin to live here and cry the lie 
 To go alive as a token by the closed trick to the early 
 Character of a bank of violence, the trailing sun 
 Shrink to block and tremble like a rainbows, 
 a necklace of worship.
