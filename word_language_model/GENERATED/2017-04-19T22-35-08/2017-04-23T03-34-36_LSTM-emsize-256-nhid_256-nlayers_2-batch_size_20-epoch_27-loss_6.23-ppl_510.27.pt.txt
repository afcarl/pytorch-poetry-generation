The Sweet Thing 

 
 And ocean heard 
 
 In a pattern it keeps off the moon. 
 The sea digs its lamp 
 As on the west he saw a knife, 
 He wore courtesied, stained and black. 
 And thousands of it strode like a garden green, 
 
 And drawing on his throat. 
 
 Sleep like a large, heart, 
 And our sooty drip and drum, 
 courtyards here for God, 
 A cape of quests 
 Drawing the soles full of ethereal
