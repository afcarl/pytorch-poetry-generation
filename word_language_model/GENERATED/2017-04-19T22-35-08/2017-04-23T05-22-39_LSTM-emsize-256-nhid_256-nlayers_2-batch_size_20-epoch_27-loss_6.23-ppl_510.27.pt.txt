Beginnings, 

 'The party at the moon, in such a tone 
 To kitchens, and Farmington, white. He walks out 
 With two white bleached ridges and tackle, gripped 
 With fear and dread, lanterns dwell, but the lizards. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Evening 
 
 
 He walks out into the street then with snow. 
 His jacket now, his hair speeds to him, 
 And now they have sent it away. There is no end, 
 A life without an apparent thing, or rags
