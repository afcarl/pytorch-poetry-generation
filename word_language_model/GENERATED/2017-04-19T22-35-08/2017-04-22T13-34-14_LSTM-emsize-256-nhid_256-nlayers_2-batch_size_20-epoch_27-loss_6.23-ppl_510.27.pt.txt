 It cannot be like fear by drop. 
 They don't speak the favor, or the hoc. 
 Barely the yeah, and the pain 
 Of the hope that hits repairing borrow 
 It is popular and something clearly for our childhood 
 
 Through the day, one part of it; the solid fields 
 
 Where is the reflection of the sun that falls 
 Life knows long, dumfounding life still shows 
 What I can even have
