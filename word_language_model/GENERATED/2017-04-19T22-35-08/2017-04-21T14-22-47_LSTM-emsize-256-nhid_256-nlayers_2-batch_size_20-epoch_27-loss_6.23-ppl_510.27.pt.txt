 
 Remembered, it's more higher, 
 Black I inmated, 
 Down home to the miles of overcast wood. 
 For now I saw the village trees, 
 And with the yellow faces snaps the brush, 
 The spring was haunted with the full noon-day South, 
 The ship was bathed by earth and Earth, 
 And the wild waters broad 
 And the fireshine stirred in an Eagle continent. 
 
 The ditch and moon and flowers of all, 
 Flies from its fall man Snow and
