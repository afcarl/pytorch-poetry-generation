Hands 

 In fibres of cloud philosophers. 
 
 And scrawls the world out home. 
 Someday 
 I know 
 We are real without looking around with you 
 Past the map, which means 
 You draw mercy here. 
 There is you? 
 No where I believe at most, 
 This most only flaring 
 Deep and brooding in among us. 
 Are you Ã  facts know, 
 Which genius, alas, knowing night's separate tear.
