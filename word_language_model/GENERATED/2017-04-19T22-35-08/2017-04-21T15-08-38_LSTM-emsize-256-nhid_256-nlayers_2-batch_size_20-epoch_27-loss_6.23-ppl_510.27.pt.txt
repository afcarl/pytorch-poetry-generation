 
 To the esprit Storm of these 
 down--still pass the rain 
 White and juniors-â€”aye, 
 And the sparse gleams receding 
 Sharp as fleet above; 
 Yet their talent is known for feasts 
 All powers are eaten. 
 
 Twice in its starlight, river-water 
 
 April prickly power, threading cabbage, 
 Pitifully ours for spirit? 
 For what good light we call 
 Joy and skill, 
 Come now 
 With my foolish love 
 Rather wider, 
 bury your lakes, 
 And
