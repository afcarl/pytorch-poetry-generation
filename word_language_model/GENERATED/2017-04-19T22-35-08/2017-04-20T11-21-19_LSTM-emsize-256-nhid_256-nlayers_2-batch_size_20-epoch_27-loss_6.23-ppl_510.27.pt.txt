I Read Is 

 Whoever or a roughness-- 
 He has left me a slot 
 with the impending woman who will 
 beware vacuity over an afternoon 
 in my own smiling body are 
 spectrums from being with the woman 
 that beckons with the same stuff. 
 
 Sudden and absolute wiser than seeds 
 look not for the long impossibility 
 of this time the seeds of summer 
 this afternoon of common things 
 these images winter long, 
 the locked lips rooted
