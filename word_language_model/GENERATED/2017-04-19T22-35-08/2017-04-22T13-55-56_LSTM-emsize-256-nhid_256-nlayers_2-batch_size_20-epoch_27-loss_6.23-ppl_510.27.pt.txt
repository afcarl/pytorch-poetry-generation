 The winds flick their flanks and closed 
 Your face down just on hoods and legs 
 Trail with rivulets painted 
 Down the calendars in banks 
 Their shadows cloy'd, 
 Didn’t turn in the cold. 
 
 Do not turn and fail for me; 
 And no flower can choose— 
 (For I perceive into my breath, 
 Yet he should seem so quaint 
 For him that most my friends do make, 
 So the sweet season, 
 
 Was a shame of 1879,
