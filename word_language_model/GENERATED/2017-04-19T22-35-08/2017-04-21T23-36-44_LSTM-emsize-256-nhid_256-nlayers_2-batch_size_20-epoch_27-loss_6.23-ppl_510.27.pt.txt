For Space, 

 Wonder that angels shed soft moons 
 Where the gravid cool or pale, 
 Yet not far above, love's receipts her nights to raise; 
 read: love struggling in bitter chains and Denied: 
 Thou queen, primary still smiles, oh Autumn's grace 
 For thee the gaps no trade for all bright weather 
 Doth fold mine lips my side by evening, 
 My legion wild waters nauseous. 
 Who touches tears in me dream of many shoe 
 As soon as we have breathed
