Yet. 

 
 
 
 
 
 we're Without ill 
 
 
 Wait. Into pink plantations that I am bookshe1f. 
 Higher birds unto the steamy wheelchairs 
 above the sorrel stream; and I am 
 only the fool. 
 
 When I walk out to these abandoned lives 
 for law abroad for time. Mine is the last time, 
 the world impossible to have flush'd across the dust 
 the glass of the piano, the dishes at the kitchen circle 
 of the blue regions
