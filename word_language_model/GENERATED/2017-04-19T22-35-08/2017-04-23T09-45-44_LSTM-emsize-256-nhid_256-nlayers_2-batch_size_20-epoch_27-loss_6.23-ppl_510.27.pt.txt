Someday Not. This Is Neither Hard Luck, 

 
 'Tis you, am I? the sweet world, 
 
 Would people say what does you, 
 
 These things have ever heard or can; 
 
 They speak and have no paradise, 
 
 The sky in which life window red; 
 Why should a living other only hope 
 
 And feel no interest in the hand. 
 
 
 The flowers of this dividing the king have found 
 
 The Lamb most dread of proudly; too.
