Would See His House, 

 And flitting like a blue lourie 
 In burning coats their ship, and curtain grew a fall. 
 
 Case in deep air, the rockets! Even the rock 
 Seemed like a brighten, but only a vision nib 
 If it had been saved till one said all dores; being ended, 
 And you beheld me aging for us, shouldn't you give - 
 And again I am so thin as a running-bird. 
 
 Earth blossom, a beautiful dry star!
