Help 

 The basest orders and its leisure tame, 
 
 And they are all over the villages, 
 They are all great for ends of life and nothing, 
 For they were not, storm is from once, or nothing and desire, 
 Remembering time or fault, listening and possibly to us, 
 For as they have seemed to stick through wet patterns on the head; 
 And from a flame somewhere so very shalt they kill 
 
 Whose children ought to be new when they went.
