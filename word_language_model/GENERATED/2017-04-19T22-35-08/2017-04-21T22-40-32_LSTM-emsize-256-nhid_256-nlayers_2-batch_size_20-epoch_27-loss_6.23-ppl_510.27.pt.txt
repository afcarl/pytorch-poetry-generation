Over The Floor By Range In The Face 

 Breaking floating spring, blue and Cyclads 
 
 And, chrysalis puffed appliances now driven by renown, 
 A table of majestic elm bells shiver 
 Framing the curtains of the infernal spot, 
 Sitting perfectly close together at night 
 In sunny flags and invitations for all; 
 Now mark'd how the summer forms of other 
 Which that sinners should be in the right-hand star. 
 The air is raised, weighing life in one thing, 
 Increases or
