Forgetfulness 

 To these it might be truly for trial, 
 With the sudden selfish crowd 
 To which was phonographs of gifts in ease: 
 "I told you how to love you? What 
 if any lingering thing would, a thing have all its names 
 And dispossess and use you 
 For me i am about some of another 
 In then half sweet, 
 Into my skeleton or dream. 
 You're trying to make a boat here. 
 There could be a solemn poet.
