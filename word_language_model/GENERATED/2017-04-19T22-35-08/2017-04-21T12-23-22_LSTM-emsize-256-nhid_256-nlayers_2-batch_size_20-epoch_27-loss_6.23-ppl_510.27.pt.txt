The Bordring Strings, 

 Left all his talk in the graced creek. 
 Here goes the Bibles, Yankee boy light-dark. 
 From the window in the whirl of silence lay. 
 A red row, waiting on the high pool that the head vales and cleave 
 Until he knelt out over the window, and it takes 
 Down on the deep strand, 
 Raised his fingers for the prey. 
 
 'My notes are let," 
 For there is no thought in beyond Milan 
 Steps without gone?
