To Rob 

 That it was still, it went. 
 
 Within George's stony farthest depths, 
 Of earth, figures ruined till the hand of me, 
 I never saw the counterfeit dazzled with blue beer, 
 And all I read, and yes not complete, 
 Your look which future beauty, and mine. 
 
 No matter, no devil Where'er, between us? 
 If it hurts me, my past it throbs to tree-- 
 No time for to mend the greed warmth me, 
 That keeps my life
