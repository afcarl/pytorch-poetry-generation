 
 She met like an old Mother 
 And asks under smeared nakedness 
 When drop away. 
 
 Eve? 
 Washington will do! 
 
 Imagination tries to teach me 
 The rabbit 
 She lit herself and wand; 
 I got out of her. 
 
 eyebeams burning 
 That night, I saw this old 
 man every one sayâ€” 
 I rolled the blue sheet in his hair. 
 
 Bending a move 
 above the earthquake. To a dog 
 he swings colored
