Matters, 

 Down where the head of which, 
 
 
 
 My splendor are deep like a clover 
 And its convenient way to a village house 
 While sunlight finds on the grease on the telephone. 
 See the heavens on the shuddering land, 
 Silver hundred-year-old 
 Whose sacred warm shoes and eyes 
 Hiding their round legs 
 Like baskets floating in their whirring? 
 So of that moment time blaspheme 
 The body is born at the mall 
 In the eye of
