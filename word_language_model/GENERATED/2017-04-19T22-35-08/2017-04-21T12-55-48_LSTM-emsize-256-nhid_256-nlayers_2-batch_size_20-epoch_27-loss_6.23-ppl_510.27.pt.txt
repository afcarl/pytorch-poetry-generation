 
 On Sunday space, 
 In the coolness where the sea 
 Turned up and down the grass. 
 As if the flutter of were shades 
 And all the cars drank rave and air. 
 
 I ceased; and I warm the sage, too; 
 I speak where I was half asleep. 
 I cannot see my father again. 
 I cannot sleep aloud, except that I forever," 
 When I lie listening to love the ways of yo, 
 And then I climb a gentian
