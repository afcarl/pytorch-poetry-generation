 I will grow euphoria with art, 
 I leave amid the yellow 
 opening. 
 
 How much were leaped in the snowsoft blacktop 
 The poor icy, diaper moved up, 
 And learned he went and cupped all 
 Her pearly guts on its lip.

 Bob struck him, cried 
 
 And it's no doubt 
 That another night, but not that. 
 
 Nor was your voice, I must kill her, 
 My love, understanding
