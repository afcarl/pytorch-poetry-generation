Buried. 

 
 That's how it grows, you acquire up nowhere and looking 
 For something to cut you away. 
 We walked the stairs with Quee!" 
 Got in our feet the mountain trees, 
 Till perfect, hasten'd. Instead, our house 
 Hold forth the stairs away like salt 
 Fat and open-handed lying in homes - 
 Keeping themselves without drives, 
 In Him we knew it only an underhand 
 Burned at. But thorn'd leaves marked 
 
 A box at bells swung carpet up
