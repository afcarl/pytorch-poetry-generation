Guidesman You Can Abide 

 And never have your coat 
 For a cupped soul. 
 
 My brother agreed 
 I cannot get her 
 Down by the old country 
 But she's turned off at your head, I drink 
 Your Throne: pointing 
 Freezing harvest iris, 
 As unisex invention! 
 
 And that suffering, don't death be 
 So bad a lot of how, 
 Seems lak to rights â€“ 
 Why did the moon take out, 
 Dreams of notes; 
 Different Tom,
