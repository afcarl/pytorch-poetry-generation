 One of morphine, a boy on the garage gown, 
 propped on the door, and faint like sparks 
 
 shouting and height. 
 
 The penalty as big 
 as the windshield half old 
 
 until the Black Rio Black seminal stops. 
 He welcomes them as when tall as ocean sits 
 barefoot on the summer class, 
 Only a thin bliss goes down a stick, 
 Fal the sparrow he heard 
 Change pine by the board 
 
 And the high creatures
