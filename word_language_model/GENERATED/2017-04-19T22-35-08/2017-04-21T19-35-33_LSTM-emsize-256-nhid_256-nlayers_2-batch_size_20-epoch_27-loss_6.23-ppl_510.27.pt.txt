I Deaf And Sad, 

 mill him singing on the shining screen, 
 His mantle spell he gave his weak accord, 
 And beats in history the grave of unbottom'd 
 
 Perhaps clothes upon the level idle cloth, 
 A child might travel at the wind's neck 
 By-cause that forwards would Parson head-shape, 
 For him, alone on drede of sense, 
 That made a sign to write, for love takes death 
 My year! Nor so I deplore 
 A bond with equal and purity
