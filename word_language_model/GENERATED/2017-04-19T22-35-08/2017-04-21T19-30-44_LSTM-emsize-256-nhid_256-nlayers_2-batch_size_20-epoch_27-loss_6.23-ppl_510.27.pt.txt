Slain With My Father'S Face 

 Obsessed, by our murderous body; 
 What the young pulse we planned us, 
 The beginning of our months is trimmed us, 
 Round that moose of Arno and shade to state, 
 Facing by the sunny winds build lenguas 
 On the beach all the sun had pulling 
 From the memories of the shape of that bud 
 Blowing over the ship, 
 And all those ruins, retreat in folly chairs 
 Behold the astounding remaining sky.
