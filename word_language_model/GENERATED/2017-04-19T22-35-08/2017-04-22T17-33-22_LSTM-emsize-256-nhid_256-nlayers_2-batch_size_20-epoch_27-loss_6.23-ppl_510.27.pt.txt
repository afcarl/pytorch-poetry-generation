Extremely Red 

 In the door, their bare bright straw breasts 
 are worn by the stars of the snow worn on 
 To see that one friend up a little track. 
 The next day I could, no one's will move. 
 What do I see, an air of gutters) 
 Where those who speak were made by adolescence 
 If directly is absurd: 
 I see iron blues 
 Now 
 
 I like to sit here here and walk with you, 
 --I cannot heal
