The Shadow Of Death, 

 To be released by a death 
 Something like this hushed thing 
 Will move again to the southern place 
 As though it ever had years to mourn if I do 
 There are still reeds to frost. 
 
 
 
 
 
 journeyest Morning 
 
 
 At the end of the year of my long 
 Father 
 It was shrunken white, on a pale island. 
 Your face fill the house into 
 Where the daughter dies down
