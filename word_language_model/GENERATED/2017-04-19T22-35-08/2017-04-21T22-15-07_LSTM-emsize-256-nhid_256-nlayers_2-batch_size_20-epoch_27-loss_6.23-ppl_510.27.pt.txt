Orchard 

 And rocked to the ceiling 
 In a boat of books, 
 non-intervention mad in comforts in 
 laces, father, splinter, 
 Sounds like song and marrow 
 Are you not doorways. 
 The dogs Railroad exiles fall 
 In the strange room? 
 
 Beneath them there, rakes. 
 stairwells, none: 
 No Wally turned morning, and cry; 
 We must live dimly on scarfer 
 And Time itself slows us. 
 The easy porridges of the Turtle 
 Have passed, and hammer-heads, the slap
