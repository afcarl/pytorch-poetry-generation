& Poet Aren'T Afraid, 

 Like the roe, the calling of 
 You are joyous lass, 
 And in each lights a singing explore 
 A light wind through them is not as heard. 
 
 See that black lumbers blow 
 Like a little motion from a roof. 
 A song of judgments, a vision snow-flake 
 Out of a cell as in a pale form 
 In a cloud of spiral grain, 
 A line-ship moth, and thaw, 
 A gown of love and bone
