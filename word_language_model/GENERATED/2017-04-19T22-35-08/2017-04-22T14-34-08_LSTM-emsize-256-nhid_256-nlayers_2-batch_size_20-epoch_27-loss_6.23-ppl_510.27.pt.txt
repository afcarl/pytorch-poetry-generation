The Shade; 

 When the herald decree. 
 
 Startled at the other times 
 No longer in their dark game 
 in our foundation at gourds-- 
 
 Not a family man there, a 
 
 Alike, proud for her daughter 
 
 
 
 She lived alone while she thought, 
 walking all around her forever 
 in the village taking a cold parade 
 
 bloodhounds we stand, remembering 
 her sheep a sandy throng 
 
 were ordered and beyond suggestion forever, 
 dust
