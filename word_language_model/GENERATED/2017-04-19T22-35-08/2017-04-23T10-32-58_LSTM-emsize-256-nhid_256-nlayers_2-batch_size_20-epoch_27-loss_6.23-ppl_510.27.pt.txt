 On the sand the trickled stone, 
 
 Look'd in the wood that sends me strength and chin. 
 Here is my heart in the ground and night, 
 Time with all its song, O song, 
 I've stepped so Open and unseen, 
 Betok'ning, I will say to them, till I and again 
 The King of years is dead. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Nocturnal and spun 
 
 
 millions. disasters. Nightmare cuddling the white-wash'd dying--and seat. 
 Stand in.
