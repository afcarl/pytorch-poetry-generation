 The ventures falls 
 On my feet. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Double Voice? 
 
 In this way on the thick bay 
 it is the rain so warm and cold 
 its breath thinks never Up... 
 Listen and something begun. 
 And it melts down me, like a screen. 
 The day is blue, you'll bend against the meat. 
 Early spring blooms down the bridge 
 I had an empty aperture 
 learn its way in 
 around the pool 
 and
