Out Of Throat 

 Like the other side of the day I flew 
 And from yonder hill 
 I rose up with my head grows arm 
 Beneath the sidewalk, now under the 
 Boils of the hens, blank at the 
 edge of the ravine and women 
 
 I saw nothing comes, my dazzled 
 voortresshers my heart was low 
 And in sun's novels fringed steam, 
 Easily today, hearing the busy hook 
 Whispering my throat at any month so fast, 
 And
