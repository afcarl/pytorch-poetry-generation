On The Stairs: 

 And post-spouse, in a basket where we are old. 
 
 Don't blown us if you eat before ourselves. 
 myopia: Fresh in ashes, we were thrifty. 
 
 Best talk-- men always fight to cross the beaches, 
 sunrises of does, four jets teach it, blood takes ice 
 and human dates of rainbow clumps of liquor, 
 some ironic trees behind your jacket, 
 a l.a., a debutante on worn outhowl 
 and unasked in the Public skin.
