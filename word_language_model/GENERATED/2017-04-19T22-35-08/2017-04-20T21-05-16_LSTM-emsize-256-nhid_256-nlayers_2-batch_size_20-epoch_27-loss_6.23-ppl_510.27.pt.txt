 
 The vulgar is the skeleton. 
 Newscast 
 Wait for an eight mornings clearly, 
 That time will stay for afloat 
 By their changing bodies. 
 
 Not 
 Far away 
 You can reach the darkness 
 And take its supper to love me. 
 The bull is sucked in a green row, 
 And too still. 
 
 A voice from a cloud stroke 
 Ash in the grass. 
 Within that week, 
 
 What shapes of land 
 Could rise in
