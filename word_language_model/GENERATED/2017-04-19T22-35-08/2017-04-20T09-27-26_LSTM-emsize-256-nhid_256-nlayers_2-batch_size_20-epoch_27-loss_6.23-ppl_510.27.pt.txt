 Elate in the trade eye of the wound 
 sky-blue inside a small dart 
 throwing commission filigree [as] 
 
 we sing never, choose Donatello. 
 
 canoers settles among 
 the fishermen and the dogs 
 with their sighing shores, 
 dropping hands from the garden 
 the long scent of okra 
 put in running. The house 
 broken to 
 hides, splitting to me 
 
 my skull a piece of flowers.
