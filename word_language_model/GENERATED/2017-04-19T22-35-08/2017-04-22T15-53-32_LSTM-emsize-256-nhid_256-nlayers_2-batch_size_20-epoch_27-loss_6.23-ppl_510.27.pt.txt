 When I agreed, I danced beside it, 
 As I had a man felt, 
 Didst guess when my lady's heart 
 Was dry, I have no flowers, 
 But those who were not all that sweetness. 
 
 
 
 It's not mine, like bus overture 
 we swell money, beside 
 the god whose mother has built 
 the buildings, sweet doors 
 of amniotic! 
 
 Disney speed, 
 the taste, thus 
 bitter, death for 
 the infinite "Will 
 both wrapped up,
