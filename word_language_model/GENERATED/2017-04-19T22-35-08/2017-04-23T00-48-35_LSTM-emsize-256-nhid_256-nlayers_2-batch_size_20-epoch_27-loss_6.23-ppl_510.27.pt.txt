Child, Not I? 

 I see you only 
 Frank Bostonians. 
 I kiss through the air 
 Like a bird in the door 
 you'll be less much, don't have been, 
 I'll scale my pain, my ears 
 Were free as men now, 
 Had received longer less 
 Set the meat of night 
 Month. toward the empty lands 
 Where the clouds gather out 
 territories, Springs. 
 More terrible small 
 Than one tender one. 
 
 I know that I am
