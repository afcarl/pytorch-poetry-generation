You Won'T Say, 

 Heav'n? battling with women's ear. 
 
 Five figures sung by a side, 
 A thicket of lies? 
 Here I do but to stand, 
 Wherever man has died, I was better, to die. 
 
 And then the princess for a tiny Man 
 At least came wiped â€“ and McGrew, 
 And lay his quivering arms to graze his chin, 
 He sat, by every pierced and every way 
 In Pope the repetitions of a hallway element, 
 Or from
