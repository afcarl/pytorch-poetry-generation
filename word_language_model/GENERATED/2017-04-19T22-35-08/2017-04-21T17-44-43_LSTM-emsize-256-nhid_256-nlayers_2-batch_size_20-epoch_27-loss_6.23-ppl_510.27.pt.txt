Slamming Cups. 

 
 
 
 
 
 If Life is Snow 
 
 
 Although it is cool and yellow with sweat, 
 Whenever the trees blow, singing Gull 
 And there are clouds halfway along 
 From the visage in soft sand: 
 I have imagined no one who tell me yet, 
 Under ungrown lands of slender seas. 
 There shall always be done and act to rotation. 
 Now all I breathe, 
 And gather in my mind the bliss 
 That, strangely far
