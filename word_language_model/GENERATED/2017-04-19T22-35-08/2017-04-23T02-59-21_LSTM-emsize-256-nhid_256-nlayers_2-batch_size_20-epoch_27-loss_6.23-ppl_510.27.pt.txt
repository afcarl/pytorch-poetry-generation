To The Nick Of The Street 

 With the thrash of the gushing palm 
 With their bare wings. 
 
 Sayeth A dream of another's birds, Met: 
 A phantom of German throats. 
 If he bring? This learned 
 The iron life remains 
 Less enough, more than his own. 
 He lifts it off a mirthful dim 
 chanticleer and beard the spinning color 
 There is plug. velleity, mast? 
 a monster Dave. Fender-chrome, retribution distancing, the globe, 
 Which in wondering, touched it
