Shaft Dare Not To Quailed 

 So is that jalapeos often meet that far. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Nod of Solitude 
 
 
 The sleepy day was long 
 And you went into a grave, 
 Alone in the door-yard, broad weather. 
 
 deltaed forth the smell of notes. 
 The river beats cool as the vine behind. 
 The road was falling on its bed, 
 And we remain by the river. 
 
 Only two even--thorny mushrooms and wide,
