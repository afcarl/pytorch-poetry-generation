Seen, Evenings, Nothing Will That Take 

 The brown trees on sways or pine, 
 And the wind blows the cold wind was bare, 
 Beloveds, where clouds will roar the nostril firefly's 
 As once it goes. Let the sun come out 
 joys? and all gone high too. 
 
 
 
 
 
 A Lad for the Dead House 
 
 
 Who didst lack your rock ones my weeping love 
 Your unearthly sighs of power in vain 
 To wreck it in old
