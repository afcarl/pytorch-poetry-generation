 The heart's events with them be found already, 
 And the loves arise. 
 
 Giving me, my lover hears him still, in all group; 
 To give me so or say out of embrace 
 Of glory or regret, or by the seen, 
 De in temperate Camelot; 
 But the dream have, perhaps when angry 
 His life appeared, he'd broke his knees. 
 He says his love is Atlantis.-- and, to all, too. 
 For show a man in sighs, I know, or two.
