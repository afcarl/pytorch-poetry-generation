 Across the floor 
 As an irritant, circling Village 
 And a pane, a soup 
 Or a glass step, 
 Infinite dark rings stitched from the 
 cabbage twigs, read 
 So wet, and just one 
 
 Drifting down sand 
 At geese seeking 
 The remembered--and their joys, 
 Time loses our rings 
 
 We 
 know it 
 God bless us is still to 
 Pequod's light 
 The house-tops Conquistadores, 
 Se√±or chip 
 Three 
 World's books 
 The megaphone
