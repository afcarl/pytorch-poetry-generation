That Battle 

 Have been so found; and everywhere 
 unborn, to the ear of itself 
 And itself the part of God 
 
 Began to rent away 
 The day of night 
 New England lurking on the sea, 
 Into a room 
 even for that dead dance 
 Jew as if I were asking since valuable, 
 
 didn't I have death to love. All the light 
 gangrene, even as I was Decrees 
 & crushed in the dust toward the windfall
