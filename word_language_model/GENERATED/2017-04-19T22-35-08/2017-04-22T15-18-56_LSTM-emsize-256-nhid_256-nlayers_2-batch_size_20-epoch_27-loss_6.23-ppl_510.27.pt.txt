 The flicker, holding me in two pairs of mussels 
 Growing like a hound in Unseemly . . . 
 I had always spoke unfollow'd, they felt all 
 After that morning six prepared, a brown hawk 
 tied body to and fro like he's an old Man 
 
 Who salt--you please i advise 
 My luck in the war of those men at sea, 
 Found the cure for death, I couldn't taste them, 
 But I either, and wondered that they were gone.
