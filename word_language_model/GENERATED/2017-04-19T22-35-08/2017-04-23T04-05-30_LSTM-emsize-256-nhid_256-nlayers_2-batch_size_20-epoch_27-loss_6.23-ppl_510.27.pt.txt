Way Of "Mistah Exile; 

 As to possible. 
 
 
 
 
 
 A transcendentally Dream 
 
 
 Lie this isn't all right, a sea-horse, 
 Not just as a woman's eye to death 
 In brainless promises of greater wounds; 
 All calm for us to go, choppers 
 Running through people into which schoolhouse, 
 Bold bean. O Sky, 
 Struck us at Asleep door to bed on. 
 Some call tables agree, soliloquy of nations given, 
 For these drink you're sleeping out
