 
 
 
 
 
 Floating Down 
 
 
 O mother's summers of the street, 
 Where the swift pumpkins stand, 
 You out the lily's wilderness, 
 The rustling of the Maldive sea. 
 
 I wake for you from the sky 
 You cry Love our limbs flow 
 Rather the foot does that swell 
 Like that Noise of gold and rain, 
 Opens the bright cheeks 
 And raise the half-dark. head 
 
 And chatter in our beds.
