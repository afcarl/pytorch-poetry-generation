York 

 The hour of others everything 
 slung over me, part of the world 
 Then the worst Poles 
 Of trying to destroy 
 Voices of the careering history, 
 The best day 
 In life. You have passed 
 The quiet twilight you two 
 Found angry accident 
 Like metallic cotta, 
 Under a lattice 
 
 
 
 And did you ever find no friend 
 And ascend at her own table, and eat. 
 She says she is only my dollar!
