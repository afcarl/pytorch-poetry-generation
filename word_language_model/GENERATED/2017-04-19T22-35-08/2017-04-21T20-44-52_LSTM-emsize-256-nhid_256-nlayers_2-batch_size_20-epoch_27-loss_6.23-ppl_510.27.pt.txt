A Charging And Red Tongue 

 And water high 
 And left the old wolves of the mgenes wind 
 As longs to follow the pig, or catch 
 Our boats with autumn bread begin to rot 
 In this whitewash; solemn city, 
 Of ring that in the circle at 
 Sunday sky 
 Across fizzied city 
 All life we watched the thunder 
 Sending weight 
 Of passionate simultaneous. 
 But I could never hope of it. 
 No words. I am 
 The ewe
