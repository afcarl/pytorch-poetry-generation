 Or by grey voice in the summer, that still! 
 
 
 I was almost a Stratford 
 And he feels to laugh and workers 
 And wondered how they take on word. 
 pray'r fly out from behind 
 Such songs to him. 
 I think I will reconstruct its language 
 Broken from the pond scrub 
 And by the fragrant windows of time 
 And look into the heat of ocean; 
 
 That I wishing I am I so. 
 
 Our stars
