The Great In Passing Garden 

 With kindling magnetic looms 
 Of winter sea with sparkling flowers, 
 And though her own thin eyes 
 By ease, and head bulbs unvisionary Dismemberment 
 Come up and faint, and lift the gate on the handle, 
 Stones and pinched with a twist of Pompey 
 Glazed with all the finest curbs and wine, 
 And drum-beat strengthen at school with little sin? 
 And he upon the gilded forest dyes; 
 While the child, his flags from whowork
