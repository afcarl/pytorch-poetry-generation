Deceas'D, I 

 
 there on the white table, 
 the bees meek people 
 cuts, their flag now, 
 
 and on they like 
 all the women 
 
 the history hemmed them to them 
 I tore their fingertips from these eyes 
 Frost flew apart. 
 Toll for me, 
 What I should 
 Lazily and lightning. 
 What do you do? 
 There is a Sundays of you, 
 and the Indian gets dark 
 in the window. 
 My tongue shattered
