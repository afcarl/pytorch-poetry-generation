Shtand 

 hall? through! 
 
 
 
 awd, The last position, 
 A row of exile as a candle 
 Styx a chequer'd cloud 
 He* the way we could find 
 no offer in the pit 
 
 
 
 The man will go demanding 
 the big shark 
 holds his cap & 
 hers is under-leaf-vein worth 
 each eye 
 with deceit 
 and the bareness 
 of sunrise, 
 passion, lovers 
 and of the hundreds 
 of grass long dogs
