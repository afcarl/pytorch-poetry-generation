In The Dark Leaves, 

 years--taught an alphabet under the distant smoke. 
 Now a)s he wants to sound it, and say he. 
 
 VIII. 
 
 Something about that knot 
 Which runs through the broken sun, 
 The telephone from which is always unspoken, 
 double-slit naming like notes 
 Were the only sex that has cut it from out an idea 
 Like the watcher by which he is, 
 Caught in a Vegas farm my thoughts 
 Making forgetting. Take the sweat in
