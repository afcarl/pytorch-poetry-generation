 corn-shucking, caning scourge; 
 Don woman said: 
 
 How this boat once, there though one raiment 
 Created voice from the next, of course, 
 "pig" around the bases then 
 violet-blue and ever replaced the land, 
 punches from nowhere that her life let cry. 
 
 Time's virtue is not arguing too, 
 He deserves the passion as Death's flesh 
 But from our graves the summer fading tear 
 Without ease upon her feet?
