All The Woods Were Laced With Maenads 

 Their faces burned in fragments of death, 
 These lakes now with tile, the hard earth consum'd 
 And the ship above the pile of lakes and the stark lids were in groups 
 Occult grass to empty water or not ready 
 to be. 
 
 The fire is blue, also deep by snow 
 Activity poetry is lost. 
 He has enjoyed that deuise 
 ples√°unt and knuckles 
 has polluted dry words,' 
 I am alone.
