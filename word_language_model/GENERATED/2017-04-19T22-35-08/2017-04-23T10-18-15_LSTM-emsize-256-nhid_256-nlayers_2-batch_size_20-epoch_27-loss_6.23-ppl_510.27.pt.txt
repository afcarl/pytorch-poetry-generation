 glorious,-- 
 The hairy stripes are behind us, 
 They shan't turn forth at the shadows. 
 
 When now they confess, your cries 
 And your fancy baked 
 Us before winds cast their young 
 With their blossoms and their plaza.

 In other class, when hearts flung faded 
 Poured you thrown along my desert walls 
 And all will bear such directions 
 As hand-sized soul to and fro
