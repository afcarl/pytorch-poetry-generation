 Two ginger, three 
 leaf-wing. In a place 
 I saw a shade 
 sheen, it seems to meet 
 marrying me. 
 Two 
 
 I have not scraped 
 the fevered overgrown 
 spider, 
 
 The story thems, 
 the old daughters 
 women tent in his fist 
 and let them come 
 wishing young men at elbow, 
 
 Duly lords and moan, 
 While the dead goes near. 
 
 She wears insatiate heart, 
 And give them the lover
