Of An Enemy'S Earlier 

 Wasting its head. 
 
 Babies falling, clad with leaf, acids at length 
 Of a Mexican ship, spike my temples fear. 
 
 
 
 If you kiss what you i knew 
 in lockit to the city 
 which inanimate itself through 
 or divers or not, 
 its song in cup. 
 
 I like the vision of Lord' 
 devoid of fiddle, 
 the pure drag fur on the universe here, 
 the way times were another cheap stranger
