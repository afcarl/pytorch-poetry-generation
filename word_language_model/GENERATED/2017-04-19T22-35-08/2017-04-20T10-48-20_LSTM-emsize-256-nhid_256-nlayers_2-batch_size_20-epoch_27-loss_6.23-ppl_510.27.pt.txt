Simulated Gray Flesh, 

 Her palms guilt-time purple, Reminiscence 
 And your neck sings the dark sloping noon, 
 The trouble backward in your brain, 
 Four desert they forecast my hair. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Vision of her Sol. 
 
 
 Her dew 
 takes a grasshopper in 
 on your way 
 into the rain? 
 
 I am valiant, 
 Washington spreads a decapitated, 
 a gold car 
 drawn to a Susquehanna.
