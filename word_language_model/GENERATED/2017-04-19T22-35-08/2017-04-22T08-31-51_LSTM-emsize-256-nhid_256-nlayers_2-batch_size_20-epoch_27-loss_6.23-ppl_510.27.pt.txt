Grounded Limbs, 

 Over almost afternoon. 
 Silas is 'bout magnified by: 
 You have wont your change. 
 
 
 
 'In Summer lanes are everywhere, hovering, 
 O lumps of fire and burning ball,

 And in the streams of mingle on the bushes, or gulph'd 
 In miniature poisoned vales by billow's stiff. 
 
 Surrounded by the stillness, that glow, ye, breasted fit,leonine.
