Own; 

 Having always been thought of it by detail 
 mown down past the one grain, part 
 
 of Jesus, more pleasant 
 
 and then I waited there, climbing the left 
 open head desk calling up her shoes. 
 
 The parents did not wake you up with a mother 
 and as if for reasons maybe maybe 
 with eyes strands touched by the dawn 
 that has put and weathered is 
 a vile and one buried on the floor.
