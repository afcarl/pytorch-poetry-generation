 The sun Italian. the noon remains 
 "As young and loud in shining foam, 
 Autumn had taken off the Tartar moan 
 And all a little bit of life and nothing joins for me." 
 
 If the leaves with the river lapping upon the sword, 
 trees, the long gales Cloris upon the dusk. 
 
 A dawn is over quested harper snow, 
 A thought goes by, and it's only one part 
 To have criticized in deeper plantations 
 with each motion and
