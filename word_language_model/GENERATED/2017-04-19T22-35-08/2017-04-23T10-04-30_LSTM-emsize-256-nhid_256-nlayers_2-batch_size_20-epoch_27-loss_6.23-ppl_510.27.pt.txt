Mountains? 

 
 I am the target? threading 
 to the shore my mother 
 is not a swooning curved 
 
 anything is 
 as if you want me a mind taking me 
 to a pain Indiscretion does not come to I!) 
 
 Someone 
 
 was wrapped in a certain god, in this old-world film 
 and a cramful of white stars 
 wrapped in mountain windows 
 tensed for relent: very Hibernicum 
 receptive. 
 
 I hear she doing the mistake
