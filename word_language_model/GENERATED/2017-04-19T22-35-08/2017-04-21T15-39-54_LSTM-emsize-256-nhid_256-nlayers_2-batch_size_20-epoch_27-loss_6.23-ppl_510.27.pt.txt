Now My Friend 

 struck my skull, his hot face 
 
 will flash in my hair 
 hunting these crumbled links 
 around my head. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Eden 3 
 
 
 Between the river my wino, lips 
 beat each true mutilated day, 
 where I too have the story to carry elapse 
 sketches, bass of laureled, Fabrik 
 & advance; how some inserts gulp 
 without class, sometimes, without Jersey 
 
 however different, and ignorance and poetry
