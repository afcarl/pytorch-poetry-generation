Aloud From Door To You: 

 North came again: it saint 
 
 When it's the light 
 A early horse takes a music 
 and--there the final animal 
 Comes from what is of it, is hungry. 
 
 The windshield of an age up to the beach 
 Or that just anonymous shadow inexpressible 
 In a block of fretted mosaic water 
 moaned, they know, Waves come back 
 And see a broken figure where 
 Maybe the sky has weathered spring.
