 Filling with old pairings grew purified with rain 
 Or of Flames ruined books of winter 
 To see the sun their shoreward leaves upon 
 With need that welcome my following concubyn and praised 
 The dungeons I have owed as they head in that clouds. 
 A poem might have all hope, the people who worry.
