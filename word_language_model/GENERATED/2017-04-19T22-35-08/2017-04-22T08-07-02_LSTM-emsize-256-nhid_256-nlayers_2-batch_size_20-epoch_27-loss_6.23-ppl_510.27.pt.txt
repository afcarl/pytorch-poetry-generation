 As he hoist hugged himself, 
 In sweet and cool like the novelty 
 With the amol code that flies, eyes--invisible 
 Rage, sister's bones, congealed with all colors. 
 
 While you think your body Wolfe into your hand 
 And you see the dying of my heart, as if you new images 
 Of the old stranglehold. 
 And again I have torn my coat bread 
 And beat that trunk that calls your hair. 
 
 I apologized to your temples and recross her
