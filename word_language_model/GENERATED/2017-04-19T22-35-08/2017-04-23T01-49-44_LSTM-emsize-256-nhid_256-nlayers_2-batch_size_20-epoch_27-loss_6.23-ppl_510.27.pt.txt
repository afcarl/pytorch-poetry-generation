And Twisting Down 

 and the river all day. 
 
 First this is not a death, it is not a myth 
 or a love of anything. To die, is a moment and 
 hurt, the children step, 
 if it were a fisherman when the other May 
 thinks, the brother awake to us from the saw. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Elegy in the Border Not with the Snake and the septic ealobence 
 
 
 What finally sweetly, now a lover overlook.
