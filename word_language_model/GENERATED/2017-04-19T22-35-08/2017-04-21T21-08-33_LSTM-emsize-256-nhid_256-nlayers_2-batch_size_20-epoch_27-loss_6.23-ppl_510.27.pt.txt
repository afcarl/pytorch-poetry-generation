Distinguish The Sound. 

 
 Come home with love and this for sitting 
 irish. on the edge of your face, 
 You've come, and you are glad to change, 
 For you, surely house will rise, 
 Root or Preserver; ever yours; 
 The day is nearer safe upon the seas 
 That shall run and I have often told them more; 
 And often speaking shan't find the danger, 
 Who hears at you an early Church, 
 With four ideas stand and talk.
