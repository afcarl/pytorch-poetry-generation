In St. Luke'S 

 Like a crossing deepening horns 
 hautgout, that twin smile caught 
 A blanket of sorts at each great table. 
 
 I knew people who would 
 Be changed, for my poor friends I say. 
 In summer, all was falling, the same storm 
 Exploding toward the beach. I am. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Together Song 
 
 
 You are a woman also. 
 You will almost turn a boat 
 in some arid far-surrounding May 
 her hooves
