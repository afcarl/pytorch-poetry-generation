The Expiring Moon Pregnant 

 by flushing mountain, cope to the world 
 Where are the tombstones of these seasons ... 
 Their boys, the tangled Desdichada 
 Out in a long storm of pleasant piazza, 
 Other and hearts draw in blood & light, 
 
 Felt by seventy years of time. All 
 Content mine, O cloud of blood O fair 
 metered fair, O bird of green, 
 And beechen light, honed by dust. 
 
 From our first sign to the west, 
 Clouds
