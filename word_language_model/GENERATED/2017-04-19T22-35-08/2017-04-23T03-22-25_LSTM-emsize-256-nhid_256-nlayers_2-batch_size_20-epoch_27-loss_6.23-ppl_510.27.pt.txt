 To him the filial weapon firm, 
 'Tis decapitation. Neither should you be; 
 And wol ye sle me soon with fright, 
 And hope it for your foresight has, 
 And better value than I know; 
 And keep beneath my Heavens game: 
 Friendly to articulate your "work," 
 Be all) that I may not miss, 
 But that you mighty reckoning can off? 
 I think of you as hymns-- as I tell
