I Saw It From My Sight 

 Jump back, from the butt-ends of the shore: 
 Low raising memories or the livelong lanes, 
 I am afraid to be having yet to remember, 
 Sure of the exiles, and the plain of death. 
 
 I loved the pride of new girls wars, 
 And, given motion with wings of milk 
 To be higher music in the soil 
 Of shadowy intensity. And from within love 
 The music of clergymen 
 The universal refuse of time
