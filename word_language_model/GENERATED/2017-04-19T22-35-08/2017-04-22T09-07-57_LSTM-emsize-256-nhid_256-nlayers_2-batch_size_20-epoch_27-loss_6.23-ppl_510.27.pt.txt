They Should Be Otherwise. 

 
 
 
 
 I 
 
 In my long, room, in spite of success: 
 Come ricocheted and stout, 
 To the spears; at dawn on the way, 
 Cow-tending afternoons, what will be doing. 
 
 O night in the early hours in day; 
 Through that water'd forest, glittering with the dew, 
 And for a jovial delight, 
 Now and is whose presence shorn other kind. 
 
 
 
 Only trolls. 
 They came to the stream.
