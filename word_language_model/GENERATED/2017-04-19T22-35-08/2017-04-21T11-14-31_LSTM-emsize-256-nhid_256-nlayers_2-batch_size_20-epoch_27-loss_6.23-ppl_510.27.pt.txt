 Alas! the dawn is enchanting to 
 The night-lamp as pluckest hand discerned 
 From Chicago. Oh it is clear. 
 Its mists the little toe extend 
 Sluggishly sweetly out all hair.

 Its tireless scent 
 Its footing clomp. 
 With dread, and all the fire 
 Is woven and the shed. 
 
 
 
 The light was late as ashes, never 
 ever who knew mitt. pains: 
 down the bowl and laid it off,
