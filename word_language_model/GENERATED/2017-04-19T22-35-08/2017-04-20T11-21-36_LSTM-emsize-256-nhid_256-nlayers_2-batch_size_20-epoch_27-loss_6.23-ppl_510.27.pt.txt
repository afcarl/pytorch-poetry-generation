 Without neighbor--not and love 
 
 Even 
 If anything 
 Were you not trying to call by 
 The banks, water, 
 
 You hear your oil monastery 
 The star must be 
 horrorstruck. 
 You watch 
 the thick slipping white 
 
 between two. Over my wrists, 
 I'll take forever back to sea, 
 and call to the night snow. 
 Let them be India. You shall find 
 before bestial can 
 still be scorning 
 the names of love.
