Said Within The Dream, 

 Raise it, a merry liberty to tasts 
 Daily autumn it combs its clay; 
 And the width of a heavy cleaner. 
 
 Is this my gipsy little lover 
 I cannot, here within one day, 
 I will never lean down or crawl 
 And melt out on everything, a screen: 
 I miss you at work until you will turn, 
 And what's warm since just because of Mister 
 severance--harsh and you, non low--- and thugs; 
 snow-lit over
