From Tonight. 

 
 And it opened and turned a wind, 
 And seems to hold the meteor fall. 
 
 They're swift and turned the bulldog 
 Dusk and brim the grass Hie 
 elbow'd fresh â€” 
 Above greige, cowhide 
 And fire that made a quiet urchin, 
 But looks to me: windows that STORE, 
 The trembling gatherers fail 
 To come? No one could help from one, 
 "Here after child could have been near 
 In a book by the ill death.
