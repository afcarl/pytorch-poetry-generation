To See No Rusty Plant Rose 

 With you, say, or light. 
 
 The scenario: the tourist rook on the stove 
 Stands the flower of equal Day, and the sights 
 Of love and lover, of happiness. 
 
 To themselves, the children, 
 Wants he was in his childhood, 
 From his higher, 
 And there the souls of friend have gone again 
 Till he turns, dead, while a hundred 
 stay--not ones with shouts that brought the world 
 With all their lip
