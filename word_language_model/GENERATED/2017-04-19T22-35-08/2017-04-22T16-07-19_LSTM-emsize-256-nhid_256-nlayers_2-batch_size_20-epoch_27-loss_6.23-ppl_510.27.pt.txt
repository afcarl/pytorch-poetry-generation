The Rest. 

 
 And a cat in a bush like the skirts of a tree, 
 Nor a response, it turn, 
 at his wheel of calm Rogers people

 they mourned in the life of home, 
 the sort of David all with still laths 
 call spring--Heave, Sprouting liquids askew 
 battered churches, spinning at the twenty-five 
 quelld, isolates Pedro peering 
 out
