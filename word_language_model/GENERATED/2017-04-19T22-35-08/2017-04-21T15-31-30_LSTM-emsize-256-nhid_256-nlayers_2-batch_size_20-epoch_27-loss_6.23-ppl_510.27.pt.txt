 
 You also in my thirties, 
 ripple wrapped inside me and black 
 sauce, and turn them everywhere 
 
 Praise the fruit of coolie, girls 
 and grow them watching all the people 
 who died from broken chance, 
 in which suicide held in order 
 to share them, and invention 
 who never 
 in condition of you, employ. 
 
 I would have seen an oven 
 look in, not hungry yet 
 but I used to call it equally.
