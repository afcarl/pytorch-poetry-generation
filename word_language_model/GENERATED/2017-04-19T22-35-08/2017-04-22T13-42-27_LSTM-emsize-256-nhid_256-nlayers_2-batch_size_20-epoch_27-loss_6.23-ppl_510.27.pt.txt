 The townsfolk dance â€” 
 The play; the Sphinx 
 trout-leap in mannan where yesterday 
 May be quiet, and dancer; 
 A leg in sundered, 
 Is strewn by one. 
 
 Almost this, 
 A gladness perform a Spleen, 
 Twelve million ravens fixed 
 Across an apple, 
 With a crowd start up 
 The dead vibrations 
 
 Out they are gone, 
 Over & through bars. 
 
 
 
 All the Indian, the letter mingled with pumpkins 
 across the church's
