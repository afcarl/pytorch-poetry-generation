Them Right Away. 

 A dime, stems. 
 
 
 II. The city of a tree 
 and the bay, 
 
 with its pace of olive is some 
 designed of memory. 
 
 One from briar will break his dress 
 arm at the stopped dew. The last roads 
 are left, in the middle of the world. 
 
 Ah what wrong heaven remember please, 
 would I have lain our dance in dark against my heart 
 my weeping Olympos.
