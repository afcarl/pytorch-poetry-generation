 
 Playing at traipsings so high set 
 repeatedly opposite, and then 
 
 men bow the mantel, fingering the valley, 
 illuminated by X & in white 
 minds only by wind and snow on the mountain 
 the tablets lost to do with that morning 
 below the tinny schoolyards behind the ships by our descent 
 
 they stacked their heads, and the face of the bread 
 
 make the surf suddenly smoke painted 
 
 ago as low memory.
