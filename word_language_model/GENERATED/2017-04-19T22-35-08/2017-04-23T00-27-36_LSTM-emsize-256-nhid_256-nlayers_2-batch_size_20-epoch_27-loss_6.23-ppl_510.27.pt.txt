The Road 

 To shine so late-arising,â€”to too rape 
 thoughtful lives had no weekly smell. 
 
 Alike 
 That I have visited for My own. 
 The pallor of hoofs 
 Falls on, the deep sun blooms dry, 
 The year that one world, in this room, 
 them?" on the pure body, 
 Smile head or saucers 
 
 Or walk twice the hill, 
 I would not now be back. 
 As if the stars sang, 
 I've grown quiet in the hollow
