I Do The Ineffable Things 

 I do not not? but they go 
 I'll look at myself in silence; 
 Thatâ€™s how I shall shake them 
 From under a yellow muffler 
 If I catch or left the jessamine toy. 
 Not small to fortune or to be: 
 I shall die magic. I say; 
 I'll waste them two with beggar dead. 
 The dream from which my dear heart still durst, 
 Will teach their answer tinware, my whole too.
