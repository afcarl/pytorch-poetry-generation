 What good hogs do, use so easy? 
 
 Am we worried to a sensitive 
 It cut, just a howl could never expect 
 To cry without speech--

 Second castles, must descend 
 
 In the cavernous habits, 
 
 But the buildings fall through her hard 
 Cov'nant, taking shining 
 Up the street and feed on fleas 
 
 Maybe her own weight, of the gold 
 bird went on in a dark
