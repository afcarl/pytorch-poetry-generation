Know. 

 
 Oh you so kissed me by unapparent snakes; 
 the Jabberwock, the working-man's pledge, the face, 
 exhausted and dead, that if one thing were time, 
 like a ghost that was never met; 
 Hear my Pilot for my prayer, 
 that purple fish, rain-soaked and terrific 
 upon My husband's brow, 
 as yesterday's fungus as newly lonely, 
 singe my plane, empty and brighter 
 than sunset or a face, 
 that grit itself is dark,
