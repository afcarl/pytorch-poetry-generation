Air And Blossoms 

 Over gloom: temples cutting west around 
 heels, the moving and angered if looking 
 Keeping them, expecting small clouds. 
 
 happy, dead friends, that music will shine like ours. 
 
 And theory more boring, loves 
 Or shun what measures to make an end? 
 Strong man knows this, I have to stop and fall; 
 They're wonderful to the Judgment room. 
 Just by me: my foe: but not be musical. 
 Soon he can't do most often regal Paradyse,
