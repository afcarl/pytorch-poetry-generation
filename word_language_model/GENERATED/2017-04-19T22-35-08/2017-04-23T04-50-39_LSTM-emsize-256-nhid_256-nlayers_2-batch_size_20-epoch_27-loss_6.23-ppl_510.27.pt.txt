All Fleet And No More Than Looking 

 Love's life on sandy feet like blackerthanyourmomma 
 Only in memory like the upper lip of 
 Seated Seraphim 
 Before the weathercock. 
 
 For a few essential sparrow in real kin 
 Which is, how their echoes through them silent, 
 I hold my hand the wall of blazes 
 Out of the head of a mockingbird 
 prome- across the waves, 
 I hold it sailing into yellow smoke. 
 
 I have surely dreamed at any
