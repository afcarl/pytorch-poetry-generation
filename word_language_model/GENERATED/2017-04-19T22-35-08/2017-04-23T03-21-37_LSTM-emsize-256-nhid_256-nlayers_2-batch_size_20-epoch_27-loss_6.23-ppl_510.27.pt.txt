Of Misery, 

 Alone till a ship of flowering leaves, 
 A sight broke in the center of us. 
 
 Days of darkness round at its mouth was a wide, 
 Blood bearing them low and bruised as a lover's ring -- 
 The dead man is the fancy's lesson gay, 
 The language that binds him as he goes. 
 
 Miniver sat deep like some wilderness, came, 
 And every man was riding, a man Waving his head, 
 And he shifts his calloused length
