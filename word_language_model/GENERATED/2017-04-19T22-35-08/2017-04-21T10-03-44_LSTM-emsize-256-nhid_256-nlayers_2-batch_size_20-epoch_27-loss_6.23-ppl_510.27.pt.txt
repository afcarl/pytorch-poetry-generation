Plenty, And Now 

 Like birches freckle and gray, 
 Calling up, then, slowly 
 
 In the reach'd of the spring Fishermen. 
 
 The mildest stars Gowned 
 In a spiral cloud the moon, 
 A wind tilted motion of a half, 
 Watching the motion of an breaths, 
 Like the rocks on the ground, 
 The lonely tiles of the bird 
 Et And the min'. We sank with asleep; 
 Frail and sad and higher tender, 
 Till the lips that chanted them.
