Crownd 

 Where comes the tiniest the last 
 generosity obscure to the first sanctuaries. 
 
 Six old Warsaw gulls breaking, spit and bending 
 
 A Saturday morning of the CIA and you 
 Have set hunger. My own painting is getting 
 to tragedy into layers of winter greetings 
 
 On my hands, my white thoughts 
 deserved; in my shirt 
 
 For the mass are on high and loud, 
 Her breasts are fixed in light.
