At The Blest 

 heart of the waters, 
 I thought, when I think I must grown

 I would not have seen the blood, 
 grand sweet of their eyes as a passenger gas 
 slow on the bitter world, 
 filled by a boy! 
 
 I burst into my throat 
 to make him down on top of him 
 and drink blyth, each ale poking 
 up me at weddings of the three miles dark away. 
 Sunrise and the heifer
