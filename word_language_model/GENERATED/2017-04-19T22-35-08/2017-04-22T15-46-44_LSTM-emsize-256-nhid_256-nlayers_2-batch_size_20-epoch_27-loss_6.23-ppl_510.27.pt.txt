Them Shouldering Their Heads 

 against their improper, mouth 
 sweet snout, 
 Wangle bits again 
 
 contrive to view 
 so entirely that with the small 
 row. harness legs 
 edging from the primal dream 
 is not its need, 
 swinging slack, others: 
 can still not life; for years 
 screaming themselves, 
 
 someone up 
 to the shadow 
 from some wood, 
 others has her room 
 
 Let the North-wind be cottonwoods. 
 The beach will be bankteller
