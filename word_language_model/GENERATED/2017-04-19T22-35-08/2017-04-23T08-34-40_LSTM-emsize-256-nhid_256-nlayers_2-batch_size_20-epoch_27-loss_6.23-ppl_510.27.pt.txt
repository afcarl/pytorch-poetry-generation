Before, 

 A paper black and shipwrecked 
 I lifted a blanket of a window. 
 And though you would never know embrace. 
 When you put it over with babies 
 and echoes pushed into the old willows. 
 
 
 
 In the Field in the faraway version, 
 a large peace of its fewer. 
 a soul-bewitching wind from its gale; 
 lipid clandestine clean, 
 balloon that gave a way from here. 
 
 
 
 An old maker, their echo of woods,
