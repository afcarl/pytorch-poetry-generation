 Quintana half a short time, 
 But crouches with weg burned 
 To anger on stretch of trees they thrive. 
 And even the only dog was heavy like Compiling 
 My cousin lay wrapped to snap 
 With a braids. 
 Who stuffs it, 
 Only a smile in a dream 
 That the movie had suddenly 
 Came red in the wilderness. 
 
 Now on the beach they have passed 
 One roaring afternoon between 
 The plain in the south, 
 And nothing
