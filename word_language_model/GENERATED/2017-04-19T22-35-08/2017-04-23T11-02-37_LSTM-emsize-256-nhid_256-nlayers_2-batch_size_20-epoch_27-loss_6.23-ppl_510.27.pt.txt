Ornaments, 

 I saw the old man speakâ€” 
 He took a book around me, 
 concerned snare 
 Jeoffry little cooking teeth 
 
 oarsmen darkness 
 
 A god in a roof 
 Arachosia, under 
 Its ache 
 For men who can't listen 
 to the ground 
 where one cannot change 
 dread, she can't touch with the 
 balmie white 
 bolts weariedly, 
 shut-eye 
 each broidery, 
 
 time 
 a god 
 
 
 
 
 You don't sing to-day,
