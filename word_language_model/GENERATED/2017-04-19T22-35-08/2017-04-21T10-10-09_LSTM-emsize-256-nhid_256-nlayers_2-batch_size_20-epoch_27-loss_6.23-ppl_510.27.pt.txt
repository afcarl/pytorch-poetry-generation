 
 A great mutate, garden once, this time 
 Of men on the stiff Atlantic far 
 So fully polished round the tent, and spring 
 And torn and frozen, is the beer 
 Of grandmother'd getting in. 
 
 Soon as a Eden grew, the sound 
 Of black scarred grass, the a, the shriek 
 
 supplee: and the truck, and the flecked leaves 
 Are shed. The backhoe lights are shiny yours. 
 
 With snow, the wind Seed finally converted over the haunters.
