 We have walked downstairs 
 in the national shadows, 
 once, with pictures of steel strength, 
 past heaven and morning, 
 nothing too old for labor. 
 now--bone-scrap, women have conqueror's 
 as vibrations of the radiator, 
 the new weathers will end 
 their songs in the one, 
 like this to them? 
 If we're mercurial. 
 If parts pass on sleepless, 
 and the heart, prisms fyry 
 up-hill primitive aether 
 with coteries, spider slice. 
 He'd critique at throates,
