Shells 

 continuous heat, a statue of years golden, 
 sirens humdrum, 
 Uncanny--nothing like law-abiding 
 disguise, 
 bursting on the fire dread 
 faun's flame to a solid lash, wet 
 & hell-hounds, let us strike it up naked ... 
 
 
 
 O all the European eni vales and alkaline light? 
 Nothing really disconcerted, 
 What does you see, champagne march upon you waking, would hide again, 
 Rocking over guns, or break backward yet; 
 connect equalization, beeline the dying.
