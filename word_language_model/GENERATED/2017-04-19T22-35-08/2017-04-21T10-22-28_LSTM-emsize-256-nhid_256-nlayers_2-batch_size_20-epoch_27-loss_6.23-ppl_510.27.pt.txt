Not From Me. 

 
 Iles or curious 
 I do not know the truth 
 So ago, 
 D. As at imperfect windows, 
 I hang side wider. 
 
 I was young 
 Like each company on hill to the street. 
 I put it on my porch, where I stood, 
 First hurried by, through all the night 
 Look'd in the rooms of youth -- 
 
 From solemn rain which lifted me 
 Into the wild northern fever. 
 
 The summer's sun
