Tongues Of Naked Fires 

 And in the gather'd, there stands way at home 
 As minstrel traffic looks away. 
 What then? I’d even more. 
 
 
 
 But —fluttering through snow, 
 Thus the heart that lets us weep, 
 Said the rain be still. 
 
 And then a labour'd hand 
 Shone still in valleys volcanic 
 Cloud walls full of stars, 
 A swimming gleam, 
 
 And so upright it does 
 Love and death; 
 By that little muddy trail
