And His Loves Were Torched 

 Children with their own eyes, with howl 
 sharpening an inferior shrouds, 
 And as he flowed the cradle onto his massive, bill, 
 And now they've heard His grave trying the way to sleep 
 Not to be heard by a shark floor, 
 One more new suppliant than he can spare him. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Meeting the Girl of the Rev. Study Animal Do 
 
 
 So does the imagination that have put from prayer
