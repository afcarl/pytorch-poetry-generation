 
 And back the rain's Ewe and lily, 
 And laughter little melodies under the green. 
 
 I hear the garden for blowing, 
 And the accompaniment, perch upon the green: 
 Like a deathbed from his Mouse-Tower of violets 
 At the mouth of his arrows. 
 
 Off opposite side the day was to flower; 
 That I had nothing but in it, 
 That the night past, and there stood 
 A hawk beneath my sight: 
 groping auditor into water 
 blue-blazes,
