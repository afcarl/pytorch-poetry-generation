 How long hold it run warm and orphaned 
 The air comes down as he asks his heart 
 
 He's so much in the universe 
 
 Of the recession, as he sings this farm 
 To hear a nation and possible sense good to be. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sonnets on the Water

 confest you must ever catch supper forever. 
 As I went to tangle it. On the way,
