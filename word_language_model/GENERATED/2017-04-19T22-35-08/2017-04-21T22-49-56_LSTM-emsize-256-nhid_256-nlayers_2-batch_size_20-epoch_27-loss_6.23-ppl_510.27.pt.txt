 I shall see you, I thought, 
 While shadows are fissuring Size: 
 Cherish to go my Patrols 
 Then exactly, they 
 Donâ€™t Seeking a black shock, 
 And some will miss my own. 
 I will eat the lord, or call, 
 With ever-returning voice, without you. 
 
 I ceased, as I drink, looked predecessions, 
 Upon the ground is smiling yet. 
 I feel so hard in twilight, 
 For many an angelic nest 
 I need no tear, 
 Nor freedom but
