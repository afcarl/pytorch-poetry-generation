Cannot Make My Father So: 

 My bones may keep the numbers lightly to be deadâ€” 
 Man must meet at once anything you like your duty, 
 Which, but what remained can of your will take forced 
 Me for a pulse to touch and take out your heels 
 And to accept our fancy who lives libations 
 And help yourself. The little labor or the cataleptic oscillating 
 A song through which the white device insists Aquila, 
 Where the echoes of F are singing
