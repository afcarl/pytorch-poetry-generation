 In killers and credit, 
 Lingering as the judges, those rocks 
 To make their attaching drink, 
 
 water-ski. They lay on wart. 
 I saw the push off and loosen a board 
 To telle a loss plow's 
 wellâ€“at say, Carpenter can you wish 
 Your homage to iZation. 
 Poor smiles have come to recover you. 
 
 Looking joining here on your phone? 
 I too am I, like the fits at brine, 
 You crept after the rest by time.
