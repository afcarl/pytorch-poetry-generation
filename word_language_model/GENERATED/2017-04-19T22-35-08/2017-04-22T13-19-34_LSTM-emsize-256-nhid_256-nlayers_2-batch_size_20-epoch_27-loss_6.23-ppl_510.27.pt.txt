 
 
 When every morning I was given. 
 The thicket was mixed for sail 
 And tears on eleventh Sicily, to reef, 
 That could have seen and round a crowd 
 Circulate under the pole; 
 By those shoreline: those fitful eyes 
 Seemed carefully to be undone. 
 What okay; Tightened loves above, 
 Why must now make eye, 
 Whilst it seems to be here, 
 And many a meed of Joseph wert 
 To guard his guilty life in life.
