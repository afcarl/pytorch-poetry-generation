Too Many Diamonds 

 That how in the hollow it is, how wind-ripped 
 I think I shall rest in our sleep 
 Mark the picture, whether I look at each a step 
 
 
 
 
 
 for Ecstasy 
 
 
 Nothing's done towards life all wet and great denounces, 
 all dumb heat as waters, 
 eaves through childhood 
 and the dirt leaves sound forehead, 
 but the milk takes its own life 
 when itâ€™s mute, too percheth 
 Such, limbs desire
