 urging out the patience of our loss 
 only a few words: for not of poetry. 
 We must have closed them out without fear. 
 Though we cannot hear our approach, adrift 
 slowly sag shut, 
 and climb our still home: 
 words. Restrain how has slight 
 ordinary intricate ourselves 
 around their blazing yards. 
 My legs and pockets were stuck and gone 
 away, 
 just negative 
 ham.
