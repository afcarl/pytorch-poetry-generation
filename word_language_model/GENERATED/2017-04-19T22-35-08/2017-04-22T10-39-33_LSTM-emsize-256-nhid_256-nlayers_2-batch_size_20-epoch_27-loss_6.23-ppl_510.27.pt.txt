Daughters. 

 
 Because that song is not or there at self-portratiure, 
 So fill in hate that taught from time 
 The Absolute dreaming from that grave, 
 Whose courage calls you've sworn to die: 
 If it be Gorgon, I flock it out long, 
 
 After destruction I'll hurl out trousers 
 Of His own darts, for clay; and a sea morgue. 
 Later, when, as he rode again, 
 I closed my eyes and murmur his arms clings, 
 And aye a hundred toys
