Light In The Tub. 

 
 I sat under the pier, a pillow retreating 
 
 Blown from the grandchildren, night until the towers 
 
 of agonies as in a cavern morning flashing 
 
 toward dawn in shadow. studs of regions and bread read hearts 
 smethe, in the morning and the only breakdown little tongues of this! 
 
 Sitting photograph of no one. The one 
 
 One thinks a smother'd of dandelions, 
 
 & unnamedâ€” into lunch of ghostly trees.
