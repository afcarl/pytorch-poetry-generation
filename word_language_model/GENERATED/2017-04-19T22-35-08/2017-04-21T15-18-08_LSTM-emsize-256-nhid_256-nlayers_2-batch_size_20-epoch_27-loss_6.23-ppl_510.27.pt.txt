 dwelling-place from muddy caverns chemistries 
 tree-tops; Then I drove the cards back 
 Over our way. 
 All day, by such a shimmering tongue.

 Of gardens quiver and paradise.

 The telephone walls 
 range through the blown leaves. 
 Never so put stranger-smiles, 
 
 Sex, memory, turning the mountains
