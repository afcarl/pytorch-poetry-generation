 And sumac-- why are we now 
 Pure as a necessity of song. 
 
 Is it dangerous for silence and so 
 smugly shaded like the shade, 
 dirt,-- 
 Someone sifts through rocks again 
 to the dust writes in that green 
 field of brick flowers, dropping 
 together the tongues shield past the storm? 
 He lies here 
 a great wind that will fall from Sunday 
 and turn wished, as though it comes 
 into a space gore-stained, reject'st: 
 that's
