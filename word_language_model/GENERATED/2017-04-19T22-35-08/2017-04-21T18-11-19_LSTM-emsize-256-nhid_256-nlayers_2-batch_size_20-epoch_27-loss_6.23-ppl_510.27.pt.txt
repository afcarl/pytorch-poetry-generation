Now, Tea And Time, 

 the voice of the piano and defile the Horseshoes 
 Calling to his wife and woman on the sea. 
 
 
 
 This arm is past! he walks on his cheek. 
 He tosses himself himself into his way? 
 The rule is especially a mask. 
 He is killed for air, the sky sits singing 
 in sensitive water, frightened cave 
 
 in the ice, background as his hunger 
 we've written his false jaundice of woe; 
 ravens deeper
