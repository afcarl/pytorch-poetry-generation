Night 

 From wind to rock overhead; 
 unpeoples, and beauty who bred her solemn soul! 
 
 O man closed up, cloven there in the land. 
 Later, at the gallop he sells all curious; 
 Doing the charge of a dying morn? 
 The old man will be injured, and helpless. 
 
 I see the Baker bend him while he isâ€” 
 He wiped his wreaths; and he cleared, his grace, 
 And up the green white hearse that rules him from drowning, 
 spake,
