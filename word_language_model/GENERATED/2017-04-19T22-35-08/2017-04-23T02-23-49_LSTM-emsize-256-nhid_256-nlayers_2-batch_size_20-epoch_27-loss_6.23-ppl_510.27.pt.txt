Spot, 

 The hands and incense filling with weeds, 
 And rich dwelling, clear of the ice, 
 When moonlight light brings only to the hills. 
 
 And blood is thin. The world of as a violet twisted 
 In unswept kite by the farther sprout, 
 Into a cloud, divided in the city's combos 
 Of the boreal moon than the coming use 
 Of a dry song I received on a stone, 
 And in the vast moonlight the foundry flow 
 Of all flowering
