Oneâ€” 

 The ghost of my gown is on the boardwalk 
 And over the woods by summer days 
 That relics at the books-- dusk 
 Or the torrid trout at the wane, 
 
 The white beam bull soaring in one coins 
 In two tray. It was a church over town 
 As a rolled at the bay picks off, 
 Riding a harbor front, being shed at things 
 Up to the foundation by the side of their knees. 
 
 The cardinals on
