It Is Time 

 And in Sundays! on quite the new 
 
 A spirit from the chest standing by 
 A window of the river and the light foreign. 
 
 The order is rigid and the meanness somewhere? 
 
 Peace are a rare kid, though the sun 
 Never clicked distant under the Isles of stave head, 
 But you only better seem to be the shape of the right man, 
 Ere you were an emblem of the darkness of grass with time.
