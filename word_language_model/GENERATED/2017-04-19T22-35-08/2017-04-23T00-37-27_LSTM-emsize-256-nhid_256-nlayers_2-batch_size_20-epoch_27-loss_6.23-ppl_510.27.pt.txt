 In the long, cave of the dead, 
 In its tomb I heard it, 
 Four thoughts that seemed to appear 
 And my heart's esteems; 
 my brown ring of oil in the skies 
 I speak from the poppy wailing 
 now that my father would pull thro' 
 the dark close station 
 Pungent. ruptured the pedagogy, 
 where my son loves there I her escape 
 my window with her wails 
 against the light away 
 this belief with my thoughts
