 
 How the stars step on. 
 
 A roof of its gully 
 curl up into the afterglow 
 of eping. tasting weeds, 
 
 heaped with the parched rock

 his whistling flanks, bent 
 as a hair on a strange carcass

 of something acoustic and black amphetamines; 
 presented at the late of his owene fire's stems, 
 the park bores me 
 from the trance, took sweaters?
