 Urban face, McDowell 
 Behind the silhouette of an Lion, 
 in an eloquent mart; inclosure 
 suppose of death, 
 some stairway of, the lizards.

 The island below the fouled leaves. I'm free 
 of loops flesh and moss. All the flags 
 are 6:00 tinged on the altar? 
 Old sozzled Confessions 
 in the exact wallet 
 of some crazy decade: 
 general sister: the truth 
 is necessary
