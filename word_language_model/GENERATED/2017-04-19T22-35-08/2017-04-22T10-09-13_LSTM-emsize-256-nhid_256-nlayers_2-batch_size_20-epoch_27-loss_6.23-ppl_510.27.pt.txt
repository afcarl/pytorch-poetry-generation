 How is he often who 
 Standing among these politeâ€” 
 Is the hest and the police 
 Who thinks, hearing how damned 
 
 emerges like a topic, here 
 Where I have spent failing 
 Taking to death? 
 Even a joy is then, 
 A admiration forgets 
 To set at wild-- 
 And go to be left 
 Only His flew; 
 Before he has finally forgotten 
 He left on aching statues 
 A little woman 
 Analysed him by certain
