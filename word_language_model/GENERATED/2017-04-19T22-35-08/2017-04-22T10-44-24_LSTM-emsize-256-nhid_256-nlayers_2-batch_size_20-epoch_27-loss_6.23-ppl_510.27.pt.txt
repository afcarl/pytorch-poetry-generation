 Until the years behind 
 Will be one, the harsh-tongued winds 
 Brings merry stones to Heaven! 
 He brings the song of pepper years 
 On the decaying rocks, 
 How often thundered he has engraft 
 A poet's distance to wenden on the earth 
 And a pipe stirs upon his question, 
 And the stars with stars and women, 
 And the Spanish tongue 
 Returns a morning 
 For a hundred corridors 
 And a skinny gaze and lies 
 Beyond a thousand
