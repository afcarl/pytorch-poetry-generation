May Cast Their Blight His Head 

 From red flakes. high and red. 
 And in its pose the moon was wafted by, 
 The sunbeam bakers till, upon Highway, 
 Between the Dong and Faith, again, 
 His sunlit city, 
 He stretched ceorl after a drunk 
 Into the bodies' head of shapes entirely. 
 
 Oh God, how cheerfully what it is. 
 
 
 
 
 55 fell. His hooves sores, 
 Oh spirit turn from turning-point 
 And trace the tattoo around.
