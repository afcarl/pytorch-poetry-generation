 
 The process of the tiny silver Sebasti√£o 
 gulp, regalia maple, it 
 passes across the coast onto invention, 
 
 
 
 
 
 The cincture from Night 
 
 
 The huge England marked and stopped, 
 Ridges, held the soul's shining shapes to beat Naive, 
 aspire; an eager from heaven and saw June or Salem mountains? 
 
 And he played pushed around 
 He was when he saw the foxes on his bike, 
 The little boy pointed against the bowl,
