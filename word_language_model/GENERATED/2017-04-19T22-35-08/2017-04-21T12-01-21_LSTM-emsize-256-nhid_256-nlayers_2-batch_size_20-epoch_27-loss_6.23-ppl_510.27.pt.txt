Fleshed 

 On the country with white cries 
 Above suppli'd 
 A bridge girl, a yellow stone star. 
 (The story remains, and the shade of this blue, 
 The small wind dying, the true one, 
 The insolent woman, the good contemplated, 
 
 Of a red fragment that grows too passionately 
 The sensitive sea we carried him at night, 
 Had the kings who struggled and outspread there, 
 Letting the earth be sweet to the lunchcounter 
 
 Our bodies, still or after,
