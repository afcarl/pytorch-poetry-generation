Plays On; 

 "And when my father is powerless to see? 
 
 Force I hear you" trowe, the day? 
 Too late. We are our sins in years, 
 Baskets of human conquest, all I have. 
 In the good best I wrote account and sing: 
 Fresh as their standards want, by greedy tears! 
 I would not find things which, you can keep or beâ€” 
 But is a curious thing, when, happy, still 
 Comfort my thoght are not as dreams they present know,
