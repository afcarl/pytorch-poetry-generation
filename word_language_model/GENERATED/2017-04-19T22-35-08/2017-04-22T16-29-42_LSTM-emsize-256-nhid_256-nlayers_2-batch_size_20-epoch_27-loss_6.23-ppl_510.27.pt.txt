 
 I loved a God, by two corners from within, 
 Only like a net that would have this heartens hollow-- 
 Words are drawn up like creatures doing two Armie of the 
 failures, at me. 
 
 But you are the pattern? Sex between you and women, 
 All the way it unearthly loves them. 
 
 May you think the house other-worldly its radiance ends 
 
 Into the belly, far behind us better than that. 
 Nothing was idea. Be your mind again
