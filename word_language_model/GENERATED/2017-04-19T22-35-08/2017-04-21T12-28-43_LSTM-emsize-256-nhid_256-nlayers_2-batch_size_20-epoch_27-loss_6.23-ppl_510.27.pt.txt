To Laying Out A There; 

 Usury, Midwest & father, 
 Others have forbid they now do. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Working by a eorla River Laundry, 
 
 
 Night unguessable ruby, the Sunday spring; 
 Drinking the virtue flush with dew, 
 Rest in a howling sound at noon, but not now. 
 These speaking true, not to mankind. 
 To his grave in that germ. 
 
 And the letter trembling in the Fence now, 
 The Minho shuts the Atlantic coast,
