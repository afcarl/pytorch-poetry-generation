Of All My Life 

 Stand still and singing but clean on my lips 
 Until I grabbed him like a black hair ...) 
 And young as a breath for that color 
 I cut off with something more revisited delight 
 Than the sea powerful for it pudding-- 
 It cannot better be the torture of homesteads, 
 Gives it --there You will soon no more 
 Throned in humanity they see whether in the air 
 There slithers an earthen ghostly beast
