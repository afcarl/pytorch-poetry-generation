 I am a friend I have to-day cloud 
 With medals.

 In the rocky silence of the creation, 
 fort, a palsied maidenhead. 
 
 
 6. 
 
 Nary you, for a moment I will drive to the dark? 
 And with what my soul never did be roux 
 Itâ€™s all the ages of stage, yet singing 
 The gift of the underground scholar is by one connection 
 To the world, to the poor
