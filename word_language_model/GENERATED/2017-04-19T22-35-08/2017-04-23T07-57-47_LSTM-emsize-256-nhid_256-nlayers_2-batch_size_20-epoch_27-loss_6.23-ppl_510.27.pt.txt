Down The River, 

 But I see our little boys wouldn't see: 
 goal. Whereof it can't. 
 
 I wanted this to turn. No climate 
 To happen about the skies-- but has 
 A few evening. My sleeves and fingers grow 
 Are tough buttocks on the yellowing touch?) 
 
 Come down on the old mountainous sky, 
 
 The children in their chests 
 The theme of childhood, as he arrived, and fly, 
 
 Eyes falling, toss their dresses, 
 summe in mosaic
