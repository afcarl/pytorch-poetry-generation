The Garden Light 

 meadow lit by a crowd of daybreak in the 
 belly. The night I am so fishing, 
 smoak'd; Expatiate and fed with anticipation 
 to my father's lips, sprung out into our hands. 
 Even in an hour of women, a fish 
 along my watch More: in the middle I stand 
 Aerial heaven, too long across the boot 
 of its own life and sadness 
 as mistake me a distinct Garlic 
 nacre-nucleus 
 and sparked the cracking chisel
