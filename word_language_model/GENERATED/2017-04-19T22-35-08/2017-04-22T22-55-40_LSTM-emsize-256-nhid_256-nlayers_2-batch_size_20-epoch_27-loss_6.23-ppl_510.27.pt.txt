Onto A Glacial Mountain. 

 
 One night I watched the reflection on a bridge, 
 like the children of people 
 immerded. but a little box 
 there was more white than Breaststrokes 
 ends up that house in the air towns, 
 and tumble from their scholars. 
 
 How buttes and frozen, and not a word 
 that was operation, burning in the fire. soon-to-be-toothless around, 
 what would happen to fall by, to which they must ebb, 
 so what? It's yellow. syrinx, paw,
