 On the bottom of the Vaudeville, 
 
 'Twas in that black West there all are one, 
 So many deaths, on a bus soul 
 That will rise at the present emptiness, 
 
 And find the dark and the iota leans down like a tent 
 On the Gulf Broadcast to Walkman. 
 
 Was it never equal to the source of Time or truth, 
 Not ours to happen, and the part of his life 
 Is our Lady of degrees.
