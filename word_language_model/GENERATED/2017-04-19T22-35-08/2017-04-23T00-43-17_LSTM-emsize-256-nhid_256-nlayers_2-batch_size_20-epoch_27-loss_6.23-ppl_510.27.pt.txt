 boots, bitter and perfect 
 and farther than laughter 
 as they or shifting...nor 
 I want that little love to find 
 my life in another's love, 
 polished in hope to find your quality 
 that seems required to love, 
 but just certain wherever else I want to know: 
 If we can't know sure that this young "No," 
 does her breathe in the cold of his footsteps 
 and anything but bells cling to you. 
 You are climbed ...
