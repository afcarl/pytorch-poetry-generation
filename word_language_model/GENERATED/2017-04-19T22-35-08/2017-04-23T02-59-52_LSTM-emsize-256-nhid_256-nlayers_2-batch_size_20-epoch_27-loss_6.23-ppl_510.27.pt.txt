But, Wake To Me I Thought. 

 
 "I didn't know how to look wall--I 
 I am lovely on my mother's face, 
 Fallen by deer, two chance, and there I see. 
 There is no sign from every case. 
 I know you must be tired, 
 Hear me once enough to know." 
 
 
 
 When at night the screen cuts down the park. 
 We all see us come down; 
 We'll fold the brimming land.
