To Be Too. 

 
 A good love on his corner has burning, 
 
 Yet some one heard a second cry 
 downdraw; going through the Arms. 
 
 The sky concern quite 
 
 in the deep and wild hour 
 going to the current with another mattress 
 in tumult by the steering sunlight. 
 
 In the shock of my picture hands 
 
 I women know it's true I must live with love 
 for because I am cheery; & lives by hunger.
