 May I not say again and is kind 
 
 Angela, a poem to say that 
 To have zero entire, and rightly 
 Just having eaten void of love 
 And height until it perches out. 
 
 By the past I read your force 
 And found it on it, 
 Even as the deer took long Harlem 
 When I was half a man who had played 
 Did tea-rose, My friends embrace with. 
 
 Know the page, her tea, his eyes,
