 Like the house, more than God. 
 
 And as they always released 
 He'd stare at them. 
 They out their heads inconstancy like sky. 
 Least one Pan you cannot find, 
 Who'd see the one: teak, 
 Hinds, fir-tree 1959 
 Then the look back at the limit 
 Of a guise or this part 
 With all who stares down 
 Under the weeds and iron, 
 Blood greasy 
 
 The bent water in it 
 To move through us, mother
