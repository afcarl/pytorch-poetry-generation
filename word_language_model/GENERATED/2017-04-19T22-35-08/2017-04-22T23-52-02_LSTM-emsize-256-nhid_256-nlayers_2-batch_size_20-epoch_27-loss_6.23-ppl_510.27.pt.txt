The Coppelburg White Men 

 All the way beyond the idiot 
 When gazing on turn together 
 Heavy against the void. Electric hard 
 Ambiguity If you lock out Grandma, 
 The great dream isn't safe to match it 
 denied! and did the things i can do as you besmear 
 ...to buzz over my finger vegetable, 
 Covering my arms. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 from Midnight 
 
 
 One pop-ups in his crib a disappeared, 
 timid and willow beads seat
