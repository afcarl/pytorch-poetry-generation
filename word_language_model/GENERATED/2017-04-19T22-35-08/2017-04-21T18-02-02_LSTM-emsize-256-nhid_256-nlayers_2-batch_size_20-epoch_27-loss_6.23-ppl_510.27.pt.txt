Like A Wedding Grace. 

 The clasp is all weakness' 
 But no one ever draws pig--pardon 
 Yet, though it bleeds over no mountain or Warsaw 
 Who watches the bells. Is this the whole thing 
 
 That we happen. The stranger 
 Return the life: someone proves your bloody person 
 
 Who knows where I won't need to count him 
 not even about to write his dead 
 for cheap thinking his friends 
 made run with my hands to flip the head
