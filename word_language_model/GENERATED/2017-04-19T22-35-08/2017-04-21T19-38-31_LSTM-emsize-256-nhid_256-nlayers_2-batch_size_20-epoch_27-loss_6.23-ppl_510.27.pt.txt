From The Shoaling The Wing 

 That moved into a hierarchy goes by. 
 
 When it was the sunbeam, in a circumstantial sky 
 
 And a window knot in his heart 
 Round he said, within my steady head; 
 Freckling a book with tiers and startling slits 
 There running through men's water; 
 A low look boredom, but the sea has been 
 To work to jollity, 
 And the proud explosion of cheese, where 
 He trembles at what I am in time
