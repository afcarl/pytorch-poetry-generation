Like The Blind Town 

 "Born for a sentence to split different, 
 You get out of me from the doors that are old 
 Leaning against the grave and you thought it's a life. 
 Now we will pass down seeing and to move the darker place. 
 I'm thinking the lungs in the skeletons of bodies should stray, 
 half of all the width of the fruit, to shelter as like the shadow of a ship, 
 O of the morning ring or soft, large-windowed
