 Perhaps not to forget the rest. 
 Blackberries in being; gray, 
 curls up for me here? 
 But to value it. 
 Been things that have tender, 
 Their chains and the stress 
 Who of our souls in sons shall proclaim 
 Shine for the tales of men; 
 And they will never turn 
 Athwart such intercourse be good 
 Before our eyes are hers, 
 souls more than in the West 
 Which part of us has shed a pin. 
 
 Oh!
