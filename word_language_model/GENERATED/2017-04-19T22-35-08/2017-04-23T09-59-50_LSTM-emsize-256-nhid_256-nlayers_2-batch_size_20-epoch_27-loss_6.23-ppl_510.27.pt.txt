Allied: She Died, 

 I would know I should have acted Gladiators: 
 I believe, I have made compacted the meadow. 
 "In the night my heart bends and quicken, 
 Words and great isolation are remembers." 
 They run in the doorways. 
 I also study them, would wear his own; 
 The room is not open. 
 
 It is my time, my verse is weeping. 
 I never spoke, especially to question 
 Office and love or despair 
 Buy their forgetting. 
 Yet madness
