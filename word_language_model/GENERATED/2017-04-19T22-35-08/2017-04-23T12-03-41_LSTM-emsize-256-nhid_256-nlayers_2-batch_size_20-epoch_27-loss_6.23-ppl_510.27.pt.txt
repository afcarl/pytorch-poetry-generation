Down 

 Usually, rolled too tall for the day. 
 No wind was bright in the moonlight, 
 Outside the floor of sky nor wide. 
 Ah, later day, or moon or day. 
 And rain blades like gently green 
 Since my mother will ever end. 
 In them I come to the appointed imm, 
 Looking a pretty culture, for hours. 
 Two together! 
 Their stars went through. 
 
 
 tirelessly, 
 
 The snow-fields and we are long and so hot 
 too
