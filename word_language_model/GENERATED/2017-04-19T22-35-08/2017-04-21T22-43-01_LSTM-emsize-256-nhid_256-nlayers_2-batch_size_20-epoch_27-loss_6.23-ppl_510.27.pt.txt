Underwater Lunatics, 

 I planted your side 
 Changing one living ghost 
 From the private man-in-the-street 
 Yet arrives to clasped them now, 
 That huge thread of memory 
 Quaalude dark for cards, 
 A little woman on fresh rocks, 
 thinned to the sky. 
 
 XI. 
 I wrapped the lamp 
 And looked at the root, 
 Murmured to her, looked up, 
 Still set the blood, 
 Into the courtyard 
 I think I came later. 
 
 And one greet me
