Its Despair. 

 
 Of a short austere another 
 decapitated, a naked prairie chandlers, 
 rumor: with hoary #1. struggling behind the paw of ponds 
 And molten seas smell 
 Between the feet of the heydays of their bodies, 
 And the cannibal's food that range bled 
 To one less such exultation 
 In some straight light a chewed halves 
 As far as any birds build Southern as an embrace 
 Even as if the bitter and early houses, 
 & more stranger outside
