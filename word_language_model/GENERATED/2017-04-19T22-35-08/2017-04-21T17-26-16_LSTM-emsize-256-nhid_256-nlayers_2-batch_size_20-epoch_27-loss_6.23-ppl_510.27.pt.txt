 That from afar, 
 appear the time 
 churning, with darkness 
 
 Lawrence runs again that low bee 
 reads: and evermore 
 The mimicking by that, 
 
 The next winter of this hour 
 Fragrant with bricks with respect. 
 
 defiantly by the rhododendrons dance 
 High like a double shrine. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Song 
 
 
 Privation mighty Time, when, still, has harsher 
 By mirth and pool of love, and Nature written 
 With Cool-hearted in cut-offs,
