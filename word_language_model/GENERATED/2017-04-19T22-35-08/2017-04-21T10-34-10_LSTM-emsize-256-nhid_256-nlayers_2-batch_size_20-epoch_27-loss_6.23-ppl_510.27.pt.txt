 And frown, that he's far. 
 
 The snuffles sent a tiger in flags 
 And a child crying, a Alfonso's splatters 
 Over node looked off. 
 
 Pretty soon, though, may I say 
 I'll think no Surgeryâ€” 
 Of the faith, in those days I love you. 
 
 If I didn't change my curls up in a sumac 
 Yet they brought you lying 
 In a helpless prison 
 In three days adore you.
