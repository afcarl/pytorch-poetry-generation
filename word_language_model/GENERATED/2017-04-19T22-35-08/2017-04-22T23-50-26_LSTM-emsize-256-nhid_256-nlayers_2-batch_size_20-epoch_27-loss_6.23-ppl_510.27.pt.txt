 And the rain in track of flame 
 Wave the green cold and white dew-drop 
 With tire on the water, 
 The best racked to have them left 
 
 You can discover you still 
 I love you as feeling anything 
 Lives in your hair while where 
 award for its sake 
 more womanly 
 than anything else, 
 
 I who am afraid 
 how easy it unasked had been turned 
 
 Broch i wish I were not entirely empty,
