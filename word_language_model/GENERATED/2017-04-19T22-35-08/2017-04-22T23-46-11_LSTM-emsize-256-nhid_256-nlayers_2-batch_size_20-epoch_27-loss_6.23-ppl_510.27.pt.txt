Called One Of His Terrible Speech. 

 
 His grandfather runs Remark at the audience: with all the lights 
 between them. 
 He opens the flag for the chalkboard in the scent of his nursie 
 inside. From the wire of the blood

 No one, shouted as she is red fish file away for 
 the woolly lips formalist, the asphalt drifts to the skin of trash 
 she stands at the same imagined time, 
 while nothing else.
