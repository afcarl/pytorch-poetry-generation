Notes 

 In the arms of some memory 
 In all these idyll, holes 
 I come in this dark poem 
 And learn to be mad 
 "Saginaw, Aledon 
 
 With rosy-white, 
 Mother of hurting breath, 
 Lie here 
 Without fire 
 To hear 
 The swallows on 
 To leave him forever 
 Childhood so searching 
 I should speak from, at last 
 
 The night will shut itself 
 
 And the rain 
 Built rolling.
