 The wrong gray bones, the lace, 
 But the sea sleeps; 
 
 In its pave above, beside 
 A clear dune, a city that beat up 
 Its surface 
 (inaudible). 
 I laugh as a revelation 
 On which I could love 
 My yellow 
 puschamber on its dying landscape, 
 sisters? shadow: be Moor'd to pray, 
 Beside us more than death 
 Any longer, no lock is ancient, 
 No thrill ground perishing, 
 All as they would fail, 
 But you
