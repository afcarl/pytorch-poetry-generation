Into Jokers 

 By Mistress' heroes. 
 
 And it's very happy! I'm truly free! 
 What's that the uncontrollable guy played with his boot, 
 He has seen him impartiality 
 Oh, bills. 
 
 jigging a king's lord he's like a gold man. 
 The same wonders in the bathroom, 
 Its glory almost went back 
 Or shake a volume of clay, 
 
 In the pine evening where I bargained: 
 And I knew my wyrd cause vision, 
 And turn your Flutter'd again?
