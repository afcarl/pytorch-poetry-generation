 
 
 Upon the steamer thro' the Coast of night, 
 Night drops through night and night. 
 Now suddenly as the ripple blow 
 Which to the silence should seeâ€” 
 At the shallop announcements of Soweto 
 A pulse-beat of light, the solemn eye of sky 
 Flashed high at flowers so full of midnight 
 When sleet is disquieted, 
 The silent drops upon the Plow blanket. 
 
 Bring me a fear, or a flash of chicken 
 Or maybe passing, a fragment
