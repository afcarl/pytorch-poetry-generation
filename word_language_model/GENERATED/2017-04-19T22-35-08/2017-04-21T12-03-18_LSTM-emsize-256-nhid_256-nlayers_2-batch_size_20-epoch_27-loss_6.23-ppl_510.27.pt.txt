 
 Into the valley of tar 
 In the great blast omnipotent knot 
 Out of the brush, new-found trees; 
 Crowned with Nature's spots 
 On the sad last and cold 
 Looking and gaze they fought dance 
 In a paper and distant mesh 
 Of the balm, by the grunsel sun, 
 When the sun strikes in his peaceful sight, 
 The mate the mosses, pages, 
 In the lazy belfry of the days, 
 Felt in the gardens of the sea.
