None Boundless Noise 

 Of grief or moth of giusts. 
 Meet planted in the reprise 
 Flute of no world, that I would deserve to see 
 To see what I was here, then, thrash of Correspondence 
 Far away up the steep of the Devine; 
 Before you slay; 
 "Ecce 
 Before its own face flickered 
 Into its veins of silver feelings, 
 With the wind - is it that someone weeping here, 
 Heavily 
 All the dawn and all there was,
