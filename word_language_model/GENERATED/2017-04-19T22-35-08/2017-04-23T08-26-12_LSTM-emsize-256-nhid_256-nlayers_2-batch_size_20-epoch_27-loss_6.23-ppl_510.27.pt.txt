To Labor Forever 

 Over their loves; and at distance the line, 
 
 I thought, by the young centers 
 Of the earth's own language, 
 That beside me 
 writing, like a sharp wire 
 
 Best once the coyly will, 
 
 Your youngest love . . . foliage, me 
 Not to my fortress I should keep 
 
 Wiltshire 
 Not if 
 Your road we have to live and be 
 Past stots, loneliness 
 But his sisters to be said
