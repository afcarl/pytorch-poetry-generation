Hirata Is, 

 suppositions and actsâ€” 
 creamy, human, 
 When they do this house pepper-speckled 
 
 Dead and lovers Drawcansir, 
 I gained, 
 And I look hard for good. 
 Milton, the blind old king, 
 Till I see how a field twitch 
 With a tooth of green and red. 
 Under gates, but of earlier days; 
 Ye wander up, till the dawn be blind, 
 And he remarked that it was a dust? 
 And world a marriage of the touch;
