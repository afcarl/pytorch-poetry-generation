The Strife 

 The strength of night and the brightness flow 
 To try to show, the greedy eyes 
 Shall shut underneath. He would have strove 
 for something in Ahmednagar, 
 
 Now, if they were small, and never saw, 
 Would never really let us rest the plain 
 To want to spring or evening, 
 or married to the topaz--and 
 If blowing grass as a swan would cease 
 
 So patiently to persevere. 
 
 And as we live in our autumn
