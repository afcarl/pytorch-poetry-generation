 What makes me feel less benedight. 
 In your loneliness is a freshness, 
 I do not know whether it could, 
 Sodom reads: 
 To the love of poetical; 
 And the long fluid. 
 
 
 
 If these were those words forbidden 
 Like stethoscopes else 
 
 
 
 
 * 
 
 
 A crew to himself yeux 
 Loveliest of wrath and Tongue, 
 Wafts below buckets of sand. 
 
 
 
 Pride is a story then a half silent
