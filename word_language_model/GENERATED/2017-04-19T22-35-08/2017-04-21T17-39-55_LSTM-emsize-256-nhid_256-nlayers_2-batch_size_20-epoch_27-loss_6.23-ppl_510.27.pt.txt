Back-Lit, Never Seen. 

 
 Here stands those live 
 
 neighbors heard from the edge 
 of the exhaust grey Umbrian kulaks, 
 a drink touch, the early paper 
 Cloth of the western coal, anthropology, 
 streamers. it was housed, alone, 
 With Godâ€™s gripe reality- 
 The blind crops rolls, a primary cake, 
 Heat at a time to miss our dearth 
 For other second we clasp the night in, 
 & didn't say. 
 
 We saw of knyght. The mountains Snow
