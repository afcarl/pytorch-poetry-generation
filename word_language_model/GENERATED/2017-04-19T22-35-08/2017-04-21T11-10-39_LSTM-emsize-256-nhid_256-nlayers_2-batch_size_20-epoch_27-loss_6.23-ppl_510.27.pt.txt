 
 adorn'd, each other 
 
 To abandon earth's time 
 --Can't I know 
 The wild and broken thousand leaves, 
 Listening to me with that which most since? 
 
 Does you dread me, thou layest me. 
 Savoring the joyous deaf night 
 By standing dull upon the scroll, 
 Then all rest all the long and best. 
 Is where I fold you apart 
 At my gentle throat 
 The waves of song and anguish, overgrown, 
 Strange Simulacra through this place;
