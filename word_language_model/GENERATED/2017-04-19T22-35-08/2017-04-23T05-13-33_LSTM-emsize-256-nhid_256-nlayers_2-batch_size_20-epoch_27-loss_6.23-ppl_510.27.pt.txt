Grace: 

 The only sound of the lily's body, 
 Drifting atop his hands to lemons, 
 
 And ever a feel she will sought; 
 It's a bit of one rose. 
 
 
 
 "Where is the Victory man of the Way 
 That hath been used aside since I run. 
 
 For unseen I am not cut this same star as I do 
 To lift the freshened, wine, break down against the heights, 
 Or the flowers start free; 
 Eager to home
