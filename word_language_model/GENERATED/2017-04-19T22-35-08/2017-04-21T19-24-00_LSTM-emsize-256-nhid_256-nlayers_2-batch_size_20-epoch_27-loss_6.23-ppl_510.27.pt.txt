 In the forgotten despair 
 Of the breath of Chinatown 
 Goes on tingles. 
 Who is glazed, so all wasteful 
 As order often might she so Caravan us, 
 The world of death and heaven, 
 
 In man no pulse in another's pride 
 Than us to wash it all challenge: 
 Popped in the other's ear, 
 What cannot plummet as toss, 
 Make them last Unmeditated, 
 The under-lying hour 
 What all together 
 From superb hand is done, 
 And
