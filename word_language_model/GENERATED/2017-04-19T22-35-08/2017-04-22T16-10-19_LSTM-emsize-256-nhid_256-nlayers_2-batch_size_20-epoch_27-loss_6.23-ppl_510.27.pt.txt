In A Day Fall, 

 I heard death in a world of plain reassembling the forms of truth. 
 
 In the year of old Paul stormy grief 
 apple-blossoms receive you in winter kitchen. 
 
 Lay my leg out at my feet, and the spark said 
 To have it no force; I might have nine and strange. 
 And what does it take him forth with so many precedent 
 
 But hearing what he dreams he would like it. 
 I'll be sure of
