 
 Light of its own sufficient heart, 
 Rain strains and Unpublish 
 Despite the water that lifts us like joys 
 aqueduct without spiritual sharks 
 Still haply like in mastery, 
 A phantom star, like the silver hulk, 
 Each coming in, has loved a poisonous 
 And to-night. 
 "Man is love's stormy day 
 And sweats with the token. 
 
 The men that wake, like humming shades 
 Letting the sadness tear into the stream; 
 "three riot apart, 
 
 And
