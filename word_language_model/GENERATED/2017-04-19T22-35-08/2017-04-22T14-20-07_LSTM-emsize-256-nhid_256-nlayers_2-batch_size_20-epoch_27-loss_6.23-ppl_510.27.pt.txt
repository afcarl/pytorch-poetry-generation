Of My Gaunt-- 

 With a hand feather the same 
 black brain is gripping a hook 
 somewhere now she hears its arms 
 black shots on her voice 
 lying on the edge of her neck, 
 and as her blossoms, her arm, want you 
 to leap to her tighter 
 I was now she left you richly ravage, 
 while Crosby bird grieves, poised down 
 into the cool sun, on my cheeks, in 
 gray laurel silk trees 
 beside an electrical ache
