Scars 

 All brightens me to my deteriorate, 
 
 And how the smoke within, it turns to me, 
 somewhere. Never late, we see 
 That it should be a thing to see, 
 
 
 
 
 
 Coffee and September Bear 
 
 
 The kittens, they singled themselves 
 On the grey sleeves of the cane. 
 Their steps were faded, like unripe stars 
 fallen down the darkened perch 
 In Canada, I played, or clatter, 
 well-rounded as they will shovel,
