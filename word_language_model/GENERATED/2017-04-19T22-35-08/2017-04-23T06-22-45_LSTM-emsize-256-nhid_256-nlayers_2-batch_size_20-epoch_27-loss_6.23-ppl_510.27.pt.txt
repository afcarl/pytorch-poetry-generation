 For what shall I do to look at oh 
 The other man in the open past 
 The Crab-apples, axe me suddenly 
 In cheap the aim of books. But now 
 My tongue stand on my heart, firebreaks. 
 Sarkozy: not at least beyond my neck, 
 My friend thought the idea, and then that plainly bore, 
 
 Slight is the skullcap garage.
