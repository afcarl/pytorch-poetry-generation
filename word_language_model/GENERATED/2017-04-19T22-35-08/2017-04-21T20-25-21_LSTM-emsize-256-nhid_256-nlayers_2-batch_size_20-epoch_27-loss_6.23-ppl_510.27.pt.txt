But Everything Else'S Thoughts 

 have sleeps; off to the earth's trellis'd glass 
 more-- 
 its straw 
 and the plantation, 
 and the bones of the teahead God-Our-Daddy's robin's-egg-blue 
 
 Istanbul mowing the gull? 
 
 Hail God, for instance, 
 the Repairing makes us rue 
 the Latin skin-tight treads spinning at us. 
 The white cotton Street welcomes in her gold 
 gold smooth! 
 These fiddler officers 
 all jingling in the black, 
 toxic upside through the other side of hills.
