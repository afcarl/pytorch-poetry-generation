Daddy 

 Fly visible, all night on taking seem . . 
 And so I'm all free. 
 
 googling lips, do you love and worship 
 The fiddle into an abandoned Sun! 
 
 
 
 He did not wring studios, face 
 As he minimum team. 
 When I crouch and bend 
 to weave him plane, 
 And olive at his head, 
 And I could see his rabbi 
 Startled me, his face was vain, 
 A wise was sorry.
