 To stroke the whole; upcurled paw 
 Sang with a shred of trees 
 All night long after winter's 
 seigneurial, reader, 
 Maybe. Potentate 
 I am jealous on the waste shore 
 Staring out the window above me 
 Sleep on the eucalyptus, I see 
 The full voice of your desire 
 In those narrowed hours 
 May be in the world around 
 The world is nothing, it 
 Never won, 
 
 And then otherwise 
 I tell him what intertwisted
