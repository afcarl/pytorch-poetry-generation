Blue; 

 precepts coming dislodged from pine-boughs feathers. 
 the rest of the future begins, and I've 
 delivered fingers, sweet feet in my palm brain 
 with the other crazy Pocono families 
 
 rain scrawled over the ocean. 
 
 
 Your new-comers left her revenge 
 in a unhappy novel, 
 we had a sleepers, 
 and I with never a Saints, or a rag or a talking. 
 You never fit your judgment-hour 
 I did remember only a stone with you, 
 you.
