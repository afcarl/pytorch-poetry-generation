Litany 

 That rustle from the bush of root, 
 Where Brooklyn, underneath the floor 
 Comes like pain around, 
 Till through the glimmering houses 
 The quiet fleeces down 
 Across the stump, turns 
 cheer: a wider necklace 
 Of leaves that saws and POETS? 
 And sets, that fetched an empty sound; 
 And Fergus calls a flight; 
 And will not fly as we say sight 
 Is what they ever do, anyway? 
 The souls of nobody ne'er 
 Can make her
