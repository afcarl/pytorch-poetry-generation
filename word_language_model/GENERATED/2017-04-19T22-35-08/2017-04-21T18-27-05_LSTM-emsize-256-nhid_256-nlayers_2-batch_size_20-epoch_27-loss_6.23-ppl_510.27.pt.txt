Know The Child, 

 And the Magdalene says it's right, 
 Nor we want to know in the past, 
 But in ten long squares of crossing town, the dancer 
 The blue earth has lured a thoughtful, bell. 
 
 We sat in certain line: It was Century's pure. 
 
 So, the years were past waterfall works 
 Over the pages and the moisture were flying up. 
 In our neighborhood, how can I turn on 
 A sheer claw, maybe English in one did.
