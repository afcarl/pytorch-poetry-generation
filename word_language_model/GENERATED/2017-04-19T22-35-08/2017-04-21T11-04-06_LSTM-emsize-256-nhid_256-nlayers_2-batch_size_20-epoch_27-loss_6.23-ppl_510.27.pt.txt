Name 

 But poured no spheres, 
 No yearning for new books 
 No matter that where you are; 
 I hid a cigarette lamp for you 
 But scarce was heard of any beer 
 Then let me hold that light foyls it. 
 And even love moves in a narrow twinkle, 
 No language can keep less sweet than air, 
 Nor strove and mad yet wholly meet; 
 The world of Roses and foam, 
 Bowed not to the platter of sleep, 
 Abandoned with
