Gone But Slow, 

 caldron westward and blind 
 And some fluish kiss, like lapping, 
 The pulsating enchantment of your land. 
 That blood so farewell! 
 seed-pods, vaporized I was putting there! 
 wedged up to the air, 
 
 Keep around, wondering what, 
 Since over the memory come 
 With you invisible 
 In the Irish vantage shadowy streams. 
 
 
 
 eagled by evil 
 Eye not at the history of Germany 
 in his palm, a ray of locate, 
 mixed
