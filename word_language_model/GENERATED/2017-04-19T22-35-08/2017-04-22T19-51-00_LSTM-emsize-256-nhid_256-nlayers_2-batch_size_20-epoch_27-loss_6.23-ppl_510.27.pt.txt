 Brother yet never seen candy 
 of the victorious idea. 
 
 Fretted dog. 
 
 I am running the history of the phone stick these verses 
 as a soft and white as a vapour drunk, at night, 
 a brown pine flamingo 
 floating through morning, which 
 every station is more wronged for the same. 
 The lines to settle like a soul stirs treasure 
 in the pinot position making wild things, 
 and it is not the coldest work, the world
