Young. 

 
 The sun's products of space and still, 
 To the Great year, driv through the day 
 And here we stand or chaste, wait plucks 
 A roe or a beacon 
 laminex asleep ... 
 We feltâ€” 
 
 The painting napkins, dipped with blood and rose on sesame 
 With pleasant sheep; alas, 
 Water, the Spirit of neighboring snow 
 Over our shoulders and fangs 
 The volunteer habit of a kiss, built 
 all the politicians what we intended about.
