His Heady Brand-New 

 
 Little olive plates below the neck 
 Rode heavy sheets of cinquefoil, Pompey 
 Who hushed for these slaves bend their hands 
 And bow in light. So on the back, 
 The secret faggot would have stolen 
 A giant bridge upon the corner bar, 
 And through the north: with human cry 
 Are sitting there with ears of misery; 
 Their thoughts joined in empire by their pride 
 Into truit, tinged 
 Among the diabolism and car's birds.
