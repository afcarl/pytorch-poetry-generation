Leaves Invisibly Appeer'D 

 Lost fishing over clouds, eating at the stars, velour; 
 As of Autumn all that first were on the earth 
 Something quivering as a perfume, 
 But with blackness in their loveliness 
 As at March and from an island drawing toward brilliantly, 
 The western sheet in which they bought dry with the summer stream, 
 All other suicidal horses dance 
 And strangers, lay their breath for ruin, fresh hair 
 Of each one spirit in threshold under them 
 prurience
