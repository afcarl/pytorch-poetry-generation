Or Perhaps, 

 The shouting grace of women's hair. 
 
 The muskrats grow together. 
 Plant la interline 
 The elevated lyre 
 lichen. A sort of wheat 
 Is sand & its peppers 
 Children in a almost ring. 
 In my study is my depths 
 Of dirt grass that is tall for sleighing 
 Circled into day lights for time, 
 Blue rain move back from me. 
 There is an old elementsâ€”a hound or bitter, 
 A very trifling scarf is a die."
