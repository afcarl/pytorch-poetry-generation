I Say, God Did All The Rest, 

 and give me my Desert flowing, 
 apologize-- furious: sea-tides, 
 I see the heartbreaking pitchfork 
 Solipsism from Downs, porkrind and pants, 
 my knots? 
 
 Suddenly the old tract of one died 
 you can make of pictures 
 Dismal's 
 in the wringer, 
 
 your feet lie tangled 
 on they?! Campo Unwitting 
 red d'origine 
 
 stars pick 
 its stomachs colder 
 from your flames and refrain 
 like a broker box,
