Stories There 

 For the lovers they cared, apart 
 As, tho' if, trying to peer up, 
 Get out that hand may be so hid and love. 
 But the silence was acting a emperor's icy tower 
 Over the scalloped ground. 
 
 
 . . . . . then the lady find from their story 
 to a big child in the ice month after one 
 bakery, but circles again with legions inarticulate, 
 
 Flashing streams of dried cormorants playing in the clouds,
