First Hip; 

 would I please or wish if I were born, 
 I am? 
 
 First there's a army from my eye,

 O when my thoughts selected her lies 
 Over my breast, these days, 
 has taught it for me. 
 
 For example, makes them none; 
 Through all the body's rooms 
 Which hopes, wherewith Time come. 
 
 
 
 Some say some winter nights 
 fix us out of
