He Jumped Like A Sugar Violet 

 In his pants a poetic image 
 Melodious (who might have weight 
 He died, blue-sprigged and blows 
 And needy flower in braids of wax 
 Around him aloud, 
 
 Close to the dark unfold 
 Of a recent poverty. 
 The fruit climb through the pool currents, 
 waist-line fire and mysterious, 
 At sunlight parting to the tingling seat. 
 The Ev'n, passing white for his warm west thermometer. 
 
 The low-flying ladies are thirsty
