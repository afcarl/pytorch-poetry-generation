Serpent 

 cornice, the street have 
 sear his heart 
 when one does not believed 
 to be passed again 
 I can get it good to here 
 where my horse is noon 
 swimmerâ€™s in a robe of shreds 
 and hard conceivd, wrestle to boink, That morning 
 
 it is almost very 
 veiled forever 
 on desire 
 is only a bottle home-deep to exceed 
 the call of the rest 
 of these broken hearts to take a cloud 
 water
