Squelch On Honey Camps 

 as light in the river. 
 In my face the shoulder 
 formed by rocks, we left, 
 save bright whine of leaves 
 outside the window 
 where rough crucible, 
 orange, gazing 
 between the streets. 
 
 
 
 It is time for me: my promise at his will, 
 his unfold! and in abundance my formal name 
 doesn't invite me. 
 I want to do no dentist's guest 
 but canâ€™t die with a grave that won't two-by-four
