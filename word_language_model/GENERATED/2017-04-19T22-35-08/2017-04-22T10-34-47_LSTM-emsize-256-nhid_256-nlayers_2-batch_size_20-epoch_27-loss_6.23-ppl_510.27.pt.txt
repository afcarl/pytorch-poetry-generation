Now White As It Was, 

 the rabbit circling from the grave 
 to the door 
 mostly the rain smelled 
 when he cleanly kissed me being called this woman on the eardrum wrong 
 I have thought to walk clean in realized her head today is hard to get 
 your name. I am stolen asphalt 
 closer to you and open your hands. 
 
 This year when you're going, I know what does conviction, 
 not like this beast in pictures or ocean or
