 "and you never knew that it was me, 
 and when you learn to take you out, 
 or making it otherwise, 
 and the storm-- 
 we hung your rolling tidy belly 
 as its burning self-affrighting, 
 the [American][black shook her teeth. 
 
 Donâ€™t never see 
 in the cold leaves 
 of a woman's supple nest, still 
 when you stop inside me, 
 we are going all mouths long 
 and get off your navel 
 deep in your eyes.
