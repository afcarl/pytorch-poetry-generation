This One Would Grow And Hate 

 a mighty transportâ€”Oh! to whom 
 He wore the inlet of my neck 
 I put him off to fail, 
 the crooked air 
 seemed to hide his brother's lover. 
 And summer, the chipped soldier's caramels 
 wrapped in rugs, oxygen pumped with flaming canvas, 
 their names was ruffling open 
 and smoke and shook up all hills, 
 in the last streets of brothers moving 
 animals out of hiding streets 
 to blur dry satisfactions
