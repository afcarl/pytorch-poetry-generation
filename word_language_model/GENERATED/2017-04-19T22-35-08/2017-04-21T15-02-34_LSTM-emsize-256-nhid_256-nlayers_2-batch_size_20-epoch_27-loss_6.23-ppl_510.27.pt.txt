The Face Of Snow In The Dark. 

 
 When good furnace, hold the highborn coupled clouds 
 And see effect in my blood? giggles, I hear my own voice 
 Like a swan, I sit in the dusk of the east where I approach 
 Wild zoo. 
 
 
 These owls celebrate with stars, 
 That all the places in trees his nostrils are their lungful 
 Of their high forms, I know I would be 
 Of hunger, to undo him by however dead.
