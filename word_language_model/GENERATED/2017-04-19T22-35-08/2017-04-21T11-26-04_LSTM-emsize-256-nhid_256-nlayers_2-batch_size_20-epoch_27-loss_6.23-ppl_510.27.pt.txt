 Rapt in the old pressure. 
 
 
 
 This is the world I nest at the car's 
 My terminal: I stare. 
 
 Am they maps of me for all the effect 
 I have not lived alone or not yet 
 align for a flying to my grave. 
 My habit is very forbidden, 
 I said I'll write it." 
 
 Just when me left it 
 And you drank the seeds,
