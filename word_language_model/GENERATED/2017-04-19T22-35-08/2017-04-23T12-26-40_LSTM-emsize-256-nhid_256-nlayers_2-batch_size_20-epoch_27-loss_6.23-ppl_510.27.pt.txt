The Grin. 

 Down the dank road 
 Beneath the summer 
 I was dreaming 
 A world of rage or golf turmoil 
 off ease, 
 And as I turned 
 And night at noon 
 Across the burning flickering bridge 
 
 birch-bark, my voice: 
 Green, the echoes of Light 
 Becomes a lost, letters tied 
 gap-toothed lordly waste,â€” 
 Of streams or waver." 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Stars in the Standup the Of the Vale to the Field
