 Play how I did see the light shining, 
 I see the writhing breath of whatever 
 has put to it again. 
 
 It was a musk that money; 
 It followed. At my side, where drives the wind 
 From spices and clover, 
 A shell upon the sky 
 Here's a spirit, when no one lost me 
 Beside the cranium hanging among 
 The mountains and the Ocean Pole; 
 The cliff and the heart's â€œinteresting 
 marble . . . to imagine
