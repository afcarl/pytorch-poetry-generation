When On Californians 

 When the lamp-light trees reclaimed these grasses, 
 Those ashes are still above 
 The growing strength of cruel grate 
 To the harvest warbling jewels of the hair 
 & before there is a sequence of news, 
 
 scarcely to every golden moth 
 trembles at evening, one hole sound vvagina 
 
 Not bashing 
 The bird was distracted in sleep 
 dimming. and felt a composure 
 We'll always be my duty 
 
 This was the call of God.
