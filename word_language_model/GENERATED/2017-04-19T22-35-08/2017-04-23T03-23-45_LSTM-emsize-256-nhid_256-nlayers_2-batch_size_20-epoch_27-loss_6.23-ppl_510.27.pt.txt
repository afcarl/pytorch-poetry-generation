Den 

 For both the seasons. 
 
 Sitting on somewhere when transparent bright 
 ringed like a peddler that whispers everything, 
 Then write that age the sound to guide 
 Alone through sunny fire, and coil 
 From the cold water near the granite moor, 
 The glittering cut-off and the slow caverns shook 
 From gray horizons, tears shouting his brow; 
 So long like voices sighed: she heard 
 How the armies, that in that life is there, 
 A summer Fays; he feels
