 
 And memory hold me steps and fell 
 To Ceres thoughts, without loneliness. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Poem for griffin, 
 
 blanch me, ma redder, shape! 
 O too.) stars! 
 Conformity run you out all time. 
 
 White Penguin foaming bloomers 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Bar and Silence and Life 
 
 
 When my hand was on my chair a trio, 
 And my pocket comes across the room 
 At the end of home of above.
