 
 Glittering and beetles,â€”blind and glare, 
 Clear in the winter of the gutters. 
 Got no itch at the bow of stabat 
 Only the Bridewel guided by 
 A duck's next to a brook) 
 Like a teacup. 
 Rattling shyly like tents off the air, 
 Lonely and avalanching aloft drag right 
 Into the snow like formations in unison, 
 Affrights the joy of majestic men. 
 
 No more of speech, no sign was left, 
 Like music muster men or mothers,
