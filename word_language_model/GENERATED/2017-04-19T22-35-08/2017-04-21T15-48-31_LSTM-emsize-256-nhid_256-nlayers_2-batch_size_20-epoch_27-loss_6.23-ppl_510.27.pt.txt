 O Hie forever!" 
 
 O braver kind and free 
 
 By him thou hast laid him before, 
 And that her Life doth fall as all 
 As someone grows as her. 
 
 
 
 There are strange people 
 I am an 
 mestizo old mother 
 coming away, 
 A hand that flows from days 
 if I was a nervous 
 
 daughter 
 
 It's egg to tell 
 we go 
 five 
 
 stolen? 
 Do you know
