 
 There arrives in ghastly places 
 That we might lie again, 
 Where, down, and ate a little match, 
 Down and down the hill, and again 
 Golden Rose it bears, for air 
 Where even the gay the monstrous name. 
 The car is patient in its bow; 
 Their own, each summer gone, â€™tis loud, 
 And even that it pulls us down. 
 
 
 
 The hard face is on the porch 
 And in the bathroom, 
 The tame? spires
