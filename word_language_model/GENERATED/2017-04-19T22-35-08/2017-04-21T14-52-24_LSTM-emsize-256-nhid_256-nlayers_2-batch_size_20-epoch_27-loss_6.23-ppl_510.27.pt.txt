And At Night 

 lest the west be strewn with therewith 
 Spiders and Bayona's glee, 
 And stop, the disturbing lines of telephonepoles 
 
 No, I shall see 
 With a pocked tail, beloveds, as is the rock and the falcon 
 Shall fold my forehead with the fierce Kings: 
 The loot of brilliances--sunlight on a beauteous ear, 
 Warned eyes) for me some haunt, soiled, and half-envelop'd 
 Never on this awful isle 
 Saving and blazing they return to the centre.
