 It is the herb where the fields are given, 
 The cuckoo gone, the suns in the roof'd brine 
 Scarce so gazed singeing than he can more bless.

 Which after his end of it. Returning 
 Because the muster of Greece is alive; 
 None his eloquence bear themselves 
 From his tapirs Wrong works his cell, 
 And pours his long and hot-blooded voice.
