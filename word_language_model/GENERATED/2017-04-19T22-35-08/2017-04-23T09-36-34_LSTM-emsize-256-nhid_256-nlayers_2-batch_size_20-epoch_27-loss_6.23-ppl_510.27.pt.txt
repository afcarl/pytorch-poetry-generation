Happier Hands 

 That smash with their cry: 
 Of Oxus, first not but 
 Our dreadful place 
 Before stains the stress 
 The tarnished fruitage of 
 Shalott. 
 
 * * * 
 
 The laughing gates they have swirl 
 Their pygmy locks 
 With pleasant hairdos 
 And strengthen up grave 
 To lead the rock on earth 
 All the wind below a match. 
 
 The poles quiver 
 Did I return to the impulses 
 By nothing to gather
