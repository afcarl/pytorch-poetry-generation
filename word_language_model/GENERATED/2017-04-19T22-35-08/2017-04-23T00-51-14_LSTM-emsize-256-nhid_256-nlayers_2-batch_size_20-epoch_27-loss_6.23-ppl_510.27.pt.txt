 
 
 
 
 
 The Destruction of Light! 
 
 
 A purple and gold of solid foam 
 That is braided like rain dive from the trees of the earth, 
 Or the thin tufts of any wallpaper where no wind shall be, 
 Who, barter with clover or calm, so scream not; 
 The sweet leap lifeless at the wrens, 
 The Salado the light is running from the clay, gentle and unkindly, 
 
 Me you have said-- 
 On the giants' bay
