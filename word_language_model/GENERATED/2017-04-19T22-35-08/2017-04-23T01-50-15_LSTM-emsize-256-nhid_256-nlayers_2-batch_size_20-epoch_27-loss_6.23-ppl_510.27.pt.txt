 I walk there, turned 
 bollard dust from machine, 
 I two, I was blind and still? 
 
 the soul I knew, you called 
 the tiny air, the swirl 
 to my ends, 
 
 and into the root repeatedly, 
 from the low cloudy blue 
 here, one by one, 
 and I'm closing lurching and build 
 a cup of death like a crazed 
 odor that fills me with a child's 
 watery fingers called 
 
 because my window, my black
