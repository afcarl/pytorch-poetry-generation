In The Empty Space 

 To the forgotten stream where the grave is going, 
 disfigured, stare again, 
 cup-shaped wreath and crevices by the hard side this side, 
 Flowing blown from the great forest over the door; 
 What the perfume more began. With its gloom 
 The echo of a torch, can bear an eye submission 
 To a breadth and crackle of a hundred strands of grave: 
 A single hawk in one another's arms, 
 And the dark laugh of the soul, light
