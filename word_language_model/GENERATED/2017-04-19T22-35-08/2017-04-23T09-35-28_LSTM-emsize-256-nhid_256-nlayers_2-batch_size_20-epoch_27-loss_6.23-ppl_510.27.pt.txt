Promise 

 About scissors. 
 They called machine-gunning 
 And there were together in length'nd hail 
 And the dark of history 
 same!â€”For, Yonne 
 And they sons were tough, emptiness; grew 
 As a storm from the farm 
 Speaks it is my food, the eyes 
 Of calm souls & tears, 
 Lay, you may lie here 
 
 When you turn most to get me spring, 
 Will all begin this native land. 
 
 
 The wooden majority have on tilting wings,
