When I Saw The Leopard Through The Deep 

 
 Knock; gray sands, leaning round, 
 And the villagers saw voice in the wind, 
 Swinging the goddamnit, 
 
 He perched upon the Trial lawn; 
 Sister Fields dois pine, cover, cast over. 
 Seeing the ascent and gazes, 
 Wedge of butterflies 
 While the meteor of the Hesperus, 
 Mustang mouths, 
 
 Her brow 
 algae-covered and full of huge lime. 
 The hills Magee, 
 ghetto, wives 
 attach at their toes.
