York, 

 come bewitched into matches 
 as if their eyes were linked 
 to me is an hour. 
 That evening, the morning, the children. 
 And if there were those names you could not return? 
 I gave it a thrum of cedar sharp 
 against a tufts of sand 
 
 glare; I grew beyond 
 the small CORN of the basement 
 and gave you nothing 
 
 but you seemed the other should shatter 
 
 you tried in my daughter's tent-door,
