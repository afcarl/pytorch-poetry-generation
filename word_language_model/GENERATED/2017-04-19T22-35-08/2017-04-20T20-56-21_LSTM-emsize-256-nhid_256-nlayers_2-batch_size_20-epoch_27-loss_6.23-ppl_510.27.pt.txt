Can My Eyes 

 jevellouris or the feathery hail, 
 Lonely to flow the voice of the sun 
 Fixed in the hand of the hoard 
 
 Of the old loved parties to be vain, 
 To the beginning with the wine of the earth. 
 
 
 
 
 Yet I want it to go on inside it thin-leafed hard. 
 Breaking in creatures that lie with me, as I looked on for rum 
 and high cuneiforms and the eyes of wrath and songs height
