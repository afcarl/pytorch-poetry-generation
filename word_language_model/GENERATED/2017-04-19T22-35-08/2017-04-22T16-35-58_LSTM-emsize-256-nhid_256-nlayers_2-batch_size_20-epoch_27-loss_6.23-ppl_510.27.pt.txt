Make This Fuss Of Movement Time 

 And known a prince's Genevieve; 
 
 Cold and sunny and bathed without a devout or bush. 
 By this the wound is given. 
 
 I could know you loved me, 
 To make it your task as to me 
 As if I'd warm. 
 If you should die aboard 
 That it must be accounted for you for, 
 Then everyone is through: 
 'Cause you mustn't stop after death. 
 What? May I not . . ."
