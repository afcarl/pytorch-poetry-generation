On A Deeper Relentment 

 For thorough mole's sake and on setting roof. 
 And I think it glows 
 Like a broad," Do you like 
 Existence by ideas of weary flowers, 
 For I am good I would teach you thee 
 That I understand the last. 
 
 You could remember how it must be my behavior 
 And say nothing to say, 
 
 I see her there as she rises with the grave 
 For a terrible word that my shrink had made
