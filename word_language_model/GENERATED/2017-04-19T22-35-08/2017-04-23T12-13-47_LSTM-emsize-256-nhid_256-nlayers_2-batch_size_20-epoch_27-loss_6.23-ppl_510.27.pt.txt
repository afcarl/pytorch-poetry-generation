 
 
 
 You sat in the winter, plays. 
 On the blue River outliv'd the sky 
 Yesterday above its snow breathing, compounded 
 of sun, and clouds and 
 robes high within flowers 
 Come back: polished Sunday; 
 
 I heard a nail. 
 
 The horse looked out like a three-years' ghost, 
 Till he licks the dried white bell, 
 With a fire-lit sheet of leaves. 
 
 The fields I must be apples frolic 
 Around the mountains called him.
