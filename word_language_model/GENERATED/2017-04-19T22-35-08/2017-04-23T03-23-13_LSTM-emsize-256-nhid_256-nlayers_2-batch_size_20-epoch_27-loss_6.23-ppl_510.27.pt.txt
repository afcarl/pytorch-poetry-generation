Want To Love. 

 
 State Sennik 
 Fear hither; 
 Not Cratoids, uncreates 
 A haunted spring thing 
 In a latent prayer 
 That amplefeysts and bloom; 
 And the pulse exchange 
 In a new drab singing? 
 
 And veins of Amaro. 
 There's a feast to-night, 
 To those who mean. 
 
 
 
 Why will see? backlit 
 As if to order or say out of two roan free 
 daughters, regarding love, they've perceived 
 How little answers all
