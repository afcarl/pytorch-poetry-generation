Achilles. 

 
 Do not return again. 
 When it's a week or a piano. 
 
 When did I see you, hear the mice run back and down 
 As here I painted the open house. "Forward, 
 
 Go away, do that surprise what it will happen spring 
 Where the other will not go? 
 The place is right, you seek, both your soul is lee-lang 
 September is sliding off cell then into winter 
 We don't know the planet again.
