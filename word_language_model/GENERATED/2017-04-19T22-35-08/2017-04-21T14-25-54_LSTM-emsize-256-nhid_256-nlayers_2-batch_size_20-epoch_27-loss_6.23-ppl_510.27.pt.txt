 All I have never seen 
 the alphabet staid, 
 like my own enemy 
 I drank the moment thereâ€” 
 contagions perish; 
 content -- the runned-over plan 
 
 to be poor. How can they 
 fall at hands on a little blackboard 
 that keeps us so wide 
 they are saying ourselves 
 in search solid, they abandon 
 the body, 
 the nerve as we survive 
 
 497. dawdling billows from grit
