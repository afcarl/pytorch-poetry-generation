Ideas!

 Cold human bones beneath about dead hills 
 spasm in front of him on glistening cutlery, 
 marsupial sand. Hebrew. Mo! 
 
 Down to a village, I climbed a rinsed cape, shambles-ward 
 Nothing is better than there is nothing 
 To see a stranger's voice, the following tip 
 Of two long years. A final canvas Negroes gasp 
 And gone white lilies— 
 Frequently. The guns on calico Square, 
 Their throats hang in the void ascends— 
 And
