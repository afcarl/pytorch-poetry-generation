A Question. 

 A dead man has just seen any rooting light 
 So that no one's homestretch, whose rich thoughts have fallen. 
 He is told distribution. 
 
 The angry cup of a tint that hides us? 
 She will run the breath of damage out 
 Of kindness into the act, the spark involved--no, 
 
 Then most of all the others in hell I fortune does 
 Do frustration, the spirit from the cross that holds 
 To glance on writing measure of all
