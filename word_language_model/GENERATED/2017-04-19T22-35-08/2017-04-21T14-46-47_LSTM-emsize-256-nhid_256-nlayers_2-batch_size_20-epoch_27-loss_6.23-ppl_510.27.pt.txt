 Praying and sendâ€”our 
 Forth flicks on the street 
 in the 
 retreating leaves 
 Thorough images 
 "to cry each coming 
 aboon; till doors 
 Fill again the hills 
 Snow-fairies avenues 
 Unnumbered girls 
 uppe their colors 
 happens; 
 as schon 
 courteous, unfolding 
 poems 
 quiet sterile 
 is absolutely broken 
 in their gardens. 
 
 Perhaps moves us apart 
 
 Age will love me 
 let me prize 
 work, 
 
 and lifting 
 away
