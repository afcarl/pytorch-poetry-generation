To Penetrate Him 

 
 Incinerated lost by weariness of deciduous gardens 
 
 He has kept stone in the city, in that glow the grass dances 
 As the fall of an old man is on his head when he sells the earth's lute-laden 
 He'll not be surprised where the party's beats his head over the plate 
 The lizard. He comes back, and only 
 the sound of an awesome curtain 
 When the rains swing through his hand 
 and my mother is unfold;
