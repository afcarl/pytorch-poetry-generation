 With that which cockroach-corpsed amused, 
 secg. at least monuments, 
 No guarantee then says 
 What now is buried in the dark, 
 (The place beyond a room-sized, of stomach 
 Took clearer spirits to perfect peace and life 
 Of certain horse the while the summer moon; porcelain. 
 Each might turn to Gershwin and hermane.

 A white-hair'd shadow raw with turtle chairs 
 Pent in pink current stains the sky, 
 
 And flap Hames picked out of heads,
