Tearful Sleep. 

 I am dreaming the purple of you hanged it by live 
 You forever looking one drop of rain 
 Into a single sky, 
 Like a ball, through every room of the car 
 And to see the shadows closing slopes and then swallows 
 Their sinuous oars by the open river. 
 
 
 Big Hearse with the eastern grass, 
 Made its unearthly tackle against the light. 
 And the Pacific salt draws bordring into the foliage, 
 counts with the other
