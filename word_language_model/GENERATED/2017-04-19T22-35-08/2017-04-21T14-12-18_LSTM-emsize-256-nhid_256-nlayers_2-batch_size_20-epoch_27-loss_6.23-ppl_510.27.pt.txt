 Looking out for mid-May's warning 
 At the triggersâ€”who as I go 
 To the hopeless field; 
 And the iron monster of white today 
 Is claims to make zones 
 And never to lie on the bus 
 To save them from what happened for. 
 Break, build your kind and sweeting, 
 Work in the fluid of the year, 
 
 And the Genius of my asking is a part of it. 
 
 I leave my mind next roar'd: once one look
