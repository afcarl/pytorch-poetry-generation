What I Think Is Rearing. 

 I am sick, Try now, 
 not to forget any real thing 
 about some little starve wings 
 stitched to a raised flower; it comes 
 into burial; Undergrowths neatly 
 busy. Or, a pimp's pours like load the appliance 
 beneath the woolen sofa and fingers 
 gehleod, the crust of factories on leaf, 
 that day I glimpse and sleep at night. 
 
 My young supper brass burps 
 oozings at their black poles. 
 I see you
