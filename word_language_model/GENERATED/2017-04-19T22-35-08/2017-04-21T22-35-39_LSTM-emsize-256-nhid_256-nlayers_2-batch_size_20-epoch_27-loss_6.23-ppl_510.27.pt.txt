Us Look A Little, 

 mozambican forever forever through 
 Sin' turbans or large, and on.... 
 
 Or off from some great pathway of a cliff. 
 The air is steady, and you too attempt to feed will 
 Mingling my face with your own toe. 
 
 And 'tis like to have begun to keep joys, 
 I seek perfect noise with the mockery of the world. 
 
 Vulgar 
 investigation, supposed to move: 
 
 What are you? Your dreams are another?
