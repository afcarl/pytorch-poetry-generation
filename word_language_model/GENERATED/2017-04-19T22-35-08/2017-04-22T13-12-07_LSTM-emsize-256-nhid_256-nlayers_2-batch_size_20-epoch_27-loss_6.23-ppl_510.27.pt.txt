A Stone Gold 

 
 To be thought of it, however fortunate 
 Or like lip or mine mind 
 Or a small impulse out of the stove for breath. 
 My sculptures inspired, this kind of painting matters. 
 
 The air is heavily and the door is dark, 
 
 What the sky remains motions shadow 
 Of the thirsty note, in this dark place 
 Of joy and time is screaming in some grass. 
 There is a fire in the crystal forest all things
