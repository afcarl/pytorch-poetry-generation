Forsake. Island I Am Waiting 

 With all of those who have gone tightly 
 In hot zones and beautiful; 
 Don't tell of this one's face. I was you. 
 My signature is my sunbathers. 
 
 Epigrams been me, grew here 
 With narrow flesh and cattle in the room and pines. 
 
 The sun through-holes by your precious hat, 
 The ceiling just as smooth as daddy, the sun is near, 
 The denouement sails from the desk with a silent cockfight 
 benefactor;
