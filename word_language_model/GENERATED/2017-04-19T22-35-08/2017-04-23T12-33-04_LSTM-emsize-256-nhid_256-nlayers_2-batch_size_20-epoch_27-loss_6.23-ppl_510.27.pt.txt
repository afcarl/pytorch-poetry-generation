Song, But Now 

 I leave at once throughout my car, 
 and to these stars give me meaning 
 of angelic things; 
 
 the gentleness are dawning 
 
 and the maid. 
 
 
 
 She was shoveling the dead women 
 beside her only those 
 do not and be shrew 
 who would be able to fear? 
 
 She says how sweet as remains 
 new paintings who loveth 
 from defending? 
 indignant poets ready 
 to lose our aura
