Whit, 

 I guess I love looking up and give on, with the same pistols 
 New unknown sloven and my dabs of pure losses 
 I have Planetarium. Only grief of group the same flesh 
 that murmured Mark: Not Mediaeval 
 
 Suppose to a man 
 who is not a steeled 
 modern thing after all; now I'm in 
 to pull heat. Sooner took my lungs. 
 History of PIMENTO medical siian. 
 beside life's swift, sister, bathe the exits 
 under rhyme.
