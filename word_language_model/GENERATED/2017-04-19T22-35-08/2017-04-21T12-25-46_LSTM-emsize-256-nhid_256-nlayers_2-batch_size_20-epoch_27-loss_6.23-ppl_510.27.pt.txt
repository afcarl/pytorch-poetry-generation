 Two: to the right man I 
 had struck my goods to lurching. 
 I didn't know how cloud-breaths in hell 
 
 I saw the history of my motion.

 Could I love little truth. 
 When I've knit me with my mother 
 stringy pose. 
 
 fending-off-- yellow, decorative p.m. 
 The name of laborers she that failed 
 Near dreams that build her out of him. 
 The song of the National Haven 
 Follow upon
