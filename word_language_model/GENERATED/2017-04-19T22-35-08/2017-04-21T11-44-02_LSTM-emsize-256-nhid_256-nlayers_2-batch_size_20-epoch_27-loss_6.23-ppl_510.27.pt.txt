Outside The Road, Career 

 
 Down into the green wood 
 looking only one looking 
 dafter for the other's 
 paper: mountains flags 
 spread down 
 wide. If it's late 
 
 I have forgotten with you as much 
 roofs, that's what it is for a moment, 
 If happiness is suspiciousâ€”the preserve. 
 
 
 
 I was much like only having a ghost 
 Still deadlock, It slips around us. 
 But it was when it were only a fiction in it,
