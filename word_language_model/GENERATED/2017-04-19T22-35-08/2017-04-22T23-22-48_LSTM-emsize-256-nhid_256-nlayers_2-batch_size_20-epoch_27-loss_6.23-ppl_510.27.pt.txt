In My Life 

 I know that's not how often for the least to be 
 patrons, 
 That it is, is the type, 
 
 A picture of leaves turbid amidst the schooner spit. 
 
 It was my brother joined him. 
 It was expensive. 
 In July with his scissors Gaped 
 In The grass. With fruit; 
 In extremity, a game 
 I don't know how 
 could I elude you. 
 I painted a party.
