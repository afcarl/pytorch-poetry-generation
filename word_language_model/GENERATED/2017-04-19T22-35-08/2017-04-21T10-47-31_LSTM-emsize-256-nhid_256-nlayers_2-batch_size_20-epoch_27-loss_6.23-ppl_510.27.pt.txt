 
 They have seen man, that invents the same. 
 They wake up silent inside. 
 With voices cool, and round and round Ofspring; 
 And things that use across the present river like pink castles 
 Of molten axe locks filled with orange towers, 
 Downward, in a far ocean, sunshine plays under 
 
 manqu√©, copper dome, hermit along the road 
 
 Past the seasons of the orchard, 
 Just like they lose a strain; 
 
 Lay there, sweet men in the mercy
