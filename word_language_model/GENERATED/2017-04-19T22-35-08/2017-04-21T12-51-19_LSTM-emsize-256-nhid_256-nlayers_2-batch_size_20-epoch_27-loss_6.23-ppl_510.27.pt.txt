 The singer too game. Love recovers the trap, 
 intentionalize softly, bigynne what I am 
 You Matthews, for, then, men and fathers of things? 
 
 I cannot feel my own race for your breath— 
 
 or the echo of a marrow in mind and there, 
 no intruder but no account, no palace of bliss: 
 who are shattered and crack? and withers, or 
 focus in the city fading on the Ku'damm— 
 
 All of them flowing from its vaulted walls,
