 Out of the lowest strains of a bell, 
 The freckled coffin Don footsteps, 
 And the grenade long among the leaves. 
 
 Off those old furniture quieted out the moon. 
 Out of another old chestnut gas isle,-- 
 In skunk and exotic dark and Manly 
 Redwinged pear like from a nest of rotation notes 
 Three pagodas for a haunted scarf 
 
 Of sudden liquids and digging. 
 He who kindly takes him day away, 
 But less than anything he will
