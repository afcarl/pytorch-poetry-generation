 Can you now forgive the boys, 
 grabbing the Cyndi revenge! 
 Fire may not be as lanterns and soothsayer, 
 with what the poet whitterick 
 
 How would I be a swinger of art, 
 My mother there may be a will. 
 
 reprieve, thus Adam in his mercy grew, 
 The air, the silver lily, the clear play. 
 I am more pleasant and sometimes Stone 
 To hear the mournful singing singing signs; 
 Where--for fast upon the pores that shine,
