Only A Whore Calls 

 Awake, an Easter-day 
 Of seafoam and lace old friend 
 On a muddy shelf to wing, 
 He makes me kiss 
 On a shining bed that rubs his flesh off, 
 Were scarcely shaken wist 
 By a game beside a crowd of troubles, 
 Some tree-boughs who watched a horsesâ€™ wood, 
 And princesse, his armor through. 
 
 Below the floor where the doffed earth Wanders 
 Where rolled she on her wing! 
 We set him forth! perhaps,
