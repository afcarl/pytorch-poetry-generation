 
 As though a king could postpone 
 His soul opening Tydings 
 Of Galilean laughter where the spirit came: 
 Full shivering in the belfry sight, 
 Bending "zero" that thou and proved. 
 
 There nothing is his thread of high gold, 
 His royal Bride. 
 
 Alas! I fear not well to see again 
 In those on dreams shalt fall beside him. 
 
 light my voice, those red spring lawn 
 Waits with knives after kings. 
 But in my dividing
