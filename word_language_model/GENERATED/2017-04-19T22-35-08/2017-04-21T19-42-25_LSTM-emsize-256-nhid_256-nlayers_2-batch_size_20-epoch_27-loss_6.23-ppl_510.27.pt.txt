 For the sweetest, thought! 
 And that he's Delusions and Elbow'd 
 And Edith with white stalks, 
 
 On the opposite wires below. 
 
 The garden wipes a single sun 
 To where he jerks the violin 
 From his small, gray shoulder a gentle, 
 And eased the dry, 
 He'd have to look at. At the moment 
 And enhancing our murderous grief, 
 Born in his hand, he was his toes, 
 He had no burning round him, nod to the stars;
