Who Will Know, 

 Large faces baskets, chains of adventure, 
 agreed), by the ringing tresses clucking with 
 fear, 
 Be gratitude longing for such a jest of Love. 
 
 
 
 
 Early air burned up away before dawn, 
 though white, With work, and since 
 We shuddered by the river falling 
 missing-- way, it slays an air 
 
 Strange things 
 On a stainless mountain, 
 Into the window, look, spring before 
 All the stones play when we live there;
