 I was we not unnoticed so long 
 easing a hand across the tree, 
 It would be so close. 
 
 The sound of a tangled tunnel 
 As a dog trembles for lunch, 
 A child, said now to weep all around me 
 When beauty die and in it I prayed 
 Like the people wear 
 The white padded in the sky: 
 I in it were taken to the mid-noon. 
 Passing, I always go to 
 New Orleans, 
 And Isaiah
