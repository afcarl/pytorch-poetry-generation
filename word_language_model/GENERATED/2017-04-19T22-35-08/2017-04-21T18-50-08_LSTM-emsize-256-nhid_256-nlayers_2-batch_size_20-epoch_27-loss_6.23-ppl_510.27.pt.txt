 for it was all that belly 
 let us sail into the writhing lakes, 
 in the strange double of a vanished Room 
 that men you played best though it ever had, 
 squinting their legs in a band to lose you, 
 but the verses that we painted hallway again 
 even for love, these days soon are all death 
 
 but barely in the day looking in the future 
 and there are days of winter, once door outside 
 of tracks and
