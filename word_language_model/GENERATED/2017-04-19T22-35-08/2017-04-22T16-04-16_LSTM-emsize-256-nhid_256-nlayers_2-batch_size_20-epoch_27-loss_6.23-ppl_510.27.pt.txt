Some Meat 

 An once-dissolute solitude 
 Did raise the sky to ashes. 
 I should catch an tissuelike squall 
 And strengthens to looking up at the day 
 As in alone the house was flung out 
 Of a crystalline room: which seemed to path! 
 Beaten by darkness 
 Even after the white detours 
 Ward slung on his bench, heat shaking 
 
 Between themselves and one by one, 
 State; new days carefully, under his fingers grey; 
 Their meaning urged up fireworks:
