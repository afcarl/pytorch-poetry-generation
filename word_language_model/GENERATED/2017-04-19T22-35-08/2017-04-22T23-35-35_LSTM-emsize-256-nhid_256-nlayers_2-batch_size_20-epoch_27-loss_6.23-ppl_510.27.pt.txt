Office, 

 Ready to be brought by thread, 
 While the world is breaking from the eyes of the perfect sinking light and running from the brown baskets 
 of poppy when water ships and plants 
 Its star lies over into the winter earth, 
 â€”What like a single bubble over a silver trail of space 
 I am painted with the waiting of greed, I remember with no dream of 
 Terrestrial flesh I ever loved it! 
 I can sit in one letter.
