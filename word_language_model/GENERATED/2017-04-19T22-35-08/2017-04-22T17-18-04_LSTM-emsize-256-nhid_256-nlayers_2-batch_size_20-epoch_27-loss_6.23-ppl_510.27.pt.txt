 And a few days braid out 
 Among the people; 
 highrises, their bells see, 
 Each hour come have fought the earth 
 credulous, through ground or shreds off 
 Against the curst water 
 From the first scarf of space, 
 With the rattling eagle which 
 pottage, its sandy shadows 
 On the solid psyche 
 
 stained, or ridge of a bunch 
 Of autumn's sunken man, 
 And the Pride of darkness, and the life 
 Increasingly no its witchery! 
 No
