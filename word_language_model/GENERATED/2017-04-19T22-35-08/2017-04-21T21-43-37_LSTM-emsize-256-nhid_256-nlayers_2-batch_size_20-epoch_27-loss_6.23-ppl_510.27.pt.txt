 I stand in arm of beer. 
 You'd think what happened to my heed, 
 him who would leave me back, 
 silver-stream March, and I lost 
 my citizen watch. 
 
 A young man in his chin 
 swims out to sink. 
 What's easier to be, 
 I should make hand so near, 
 I solve my father all call out, 
 so that it glittered like a comma 
 and he knew it was himself Melt-in-the-mouth 
 or so they brought me from
