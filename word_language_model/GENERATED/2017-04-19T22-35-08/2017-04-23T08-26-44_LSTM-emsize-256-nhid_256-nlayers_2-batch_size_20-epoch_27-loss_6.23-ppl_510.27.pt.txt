Sons Have Been, 

 
 And cheer them on, to flower-bells at least, 
 The law that melted, and thy death 
 Shall come the wall which doth not ever ebb, 
 Around new shadows, our tears are deep, 
 
 And when the young moon waits. 
 
 Our mountains we met at their husbands' corners, too 
 Rockies, mourn. 
 Dost thou surely hear themselves ways to worry 
 Why should I hear my whole hurt thee, 
 When I shall die.
