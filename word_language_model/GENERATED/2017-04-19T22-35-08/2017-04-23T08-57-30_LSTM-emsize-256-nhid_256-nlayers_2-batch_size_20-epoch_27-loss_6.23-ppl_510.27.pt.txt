Not Heav'N Cwealdest 

 
 Those who go looking at me wasted more clear 
 
 And they shall break the wild bodies 
 
 Or if they always were a girl 
 
 And her flock gone.

 You know how to say something that's 
 searching for me when I peril’s 
 in dream, I'll don’t believe 
 in the way we could never write: 
 
 we were going to hear the muddy orange perch 
 carrying our cedar roots
