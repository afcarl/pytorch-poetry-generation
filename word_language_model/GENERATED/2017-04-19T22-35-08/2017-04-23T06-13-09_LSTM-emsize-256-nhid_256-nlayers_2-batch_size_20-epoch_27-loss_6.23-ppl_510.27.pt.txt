Down, Sun-Searched With Spoons, 

 clichgrotesque at bathroom-stall 
 miles; and popped from it by the river, 
 Jumping cold and threads 
 And on passes a sun at center 
 And little lovers resinous through the coil 
 Of sand, a carrot pressed to water, 
 And woke your bigger, but for a while 
 
 The road goes to the lightning. 
 
 To the haven of Delaying among black, 
 
 We made no voice in the line of life, 
 Nor ships that quiver
