String Drift Up, 

 All the same inch on us 
 
 The heavy bull. 
 So many years at home 
 Because it is early morning 
 & when the river 
 best of the each? 
 
 No question we can hear 
 beneath the stars, red water 
 a twisted mesh 
 that opened us 
 around the lighthouse 
 and ozone jawed Caressed 
 
 gesse L'expansive 
 was subterranean fairy 
 tools that creep no 
 
 direction next door, unpeopled airs
