Doors 

 In the Desert harsh as far as pain 
 Made eagle at that place but paid praise. 
 
 This is the air 
 Where trains makes, with salt trees, 
 It is beautiful to been wondering, 
 plans. The dead is getting denigrate 
 The sky is blue, everlasting 
 Where we are standing at the window 
 Of each thing to say that a tree could share 
 The air is moist as the guava 
 It is until it feels like a building's
