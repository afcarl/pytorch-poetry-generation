The Forests 

 In ignorant and crystal sun; 
 And, sleep, O elegy 
 Such a grateful title has ravager 
 That even the childhood of a vaunt, 
 He was commended to someone himself, 
 Pale hand perplexed and whittled from her bench, 
 Simple our daughter, 
 And we'd left them to the seas in the limitations 
 We have tied the last of our long breath. 
 However, I think such many animals might eat; 
 They hurt me and you are more and great
