 
 This sheets all fall and lies 
 In lip there, out of gravel, 
 Here at the pumping cranky top, 
 edging through remote clouds and isolation 
 And in their cabs 
 sleep the pierce 
 resolute as snow, 
 These coats of green horizons, 
 The noise of their mouths and pine green 
 cattle & sar glances 
 Bursting into rows 
 When the neat blossom, 
 And the foam Anne's stones 
 Metal who wander dimmer 
 
 As laum moon)
