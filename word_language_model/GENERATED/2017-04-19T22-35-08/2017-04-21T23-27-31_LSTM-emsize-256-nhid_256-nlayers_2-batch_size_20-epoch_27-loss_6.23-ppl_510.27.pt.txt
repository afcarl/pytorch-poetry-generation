 I tell you what you did is coming, next to me! 
 One year we met upon it, 
 
 The nights studied and chum 
 That is possible to question they are 
 Had you happy? Like a woman fed us from the rest: 
 Across the heads of goldenrod and shattering, shadow darkening 
 blighted, of a nest of rigid lace in a park, 
 park!" to privacy, limitâ€” digging in the mouth. 
 Birds morning trees and dreamed a summer rank, 
 luminous,
