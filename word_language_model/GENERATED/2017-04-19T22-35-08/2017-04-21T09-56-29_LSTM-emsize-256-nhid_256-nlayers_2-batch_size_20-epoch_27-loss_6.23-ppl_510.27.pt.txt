 
 Yet neither are things who lived long, 
 syllables that receive the Lad their King. 
 O Tribune and cities, uniform, 
 coverts content to see, 
 Drunk dreaming of the Damascien, 
 Of libraries that wandered through the hill; 
 All one, beneath their unconscious limbs, 
 And slowly return'd the frosty year, 
 Men with gold, turns, bells, and planets run and sing 
 As fury, as lookt through tears from pole; 
 Those smile with polish'd forms of excellence 
 From all men
