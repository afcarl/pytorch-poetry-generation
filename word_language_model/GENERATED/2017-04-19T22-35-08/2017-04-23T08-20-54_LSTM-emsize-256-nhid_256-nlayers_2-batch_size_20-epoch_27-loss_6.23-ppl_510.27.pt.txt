 There was more the vale than that passed 
 Breaking to the floor my brain, 
 Fairer than the rain, sweet winds, pressed with sky. 
 
 In sudden meadows, that bends 
 Between the wild leaves of the madhouse 
 Jesu, Edward chased it, 
 Educated and followed clear. 
 No Nightingale was fraught with tobacco; 
 He stood at me. 
 Vaporous, wineglasses y grace; 
 A Silas, in the dark; 
 A clearing in a perfect fire. 
 This is a glorious instrument.
