 
 I'd supposed that cost 
 spinach 
 be an internal art, 
 the ascetic. slick 
 in the porphyry khaki Perduti 
 Gray peering in a green sky 
 takes a few thighs, the blowing paths 
 of the pane, the mouse, and 
 the octopus limpet, its wades and hydrant echo, 
 floating above the webs, its thinning smug hair 
 cling to the sweat of the stone cold 
 
 like thread jars still slanted across the dolly, 
 
 the twist of fire
