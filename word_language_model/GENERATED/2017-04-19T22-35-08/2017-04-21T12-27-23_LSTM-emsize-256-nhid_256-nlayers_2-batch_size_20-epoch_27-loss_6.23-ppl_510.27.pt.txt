 I'm running, a telephone what's head 
 With stiff juices or a wardrobe of ordinary shoots 
 Embrace a stony indoor drowning then reassure us 
 at harold edge like a tear on a Street 
 and then ask for the same life, and yes, if 
 someone have waited for others and gives it up the day 
 when he sits too close to the mysteries. 
 
 I didn't make but dead Kilman, 
 in love with solitude, or flower, that flows 
 through the
