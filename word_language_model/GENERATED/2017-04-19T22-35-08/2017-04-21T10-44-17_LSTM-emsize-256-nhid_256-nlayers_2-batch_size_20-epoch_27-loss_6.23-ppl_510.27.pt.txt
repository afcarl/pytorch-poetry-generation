Starlight. 

 
 So each gate says you want like this, to the pyres 
 of depart: and I needed from the Lord's 
 odor of separation into heaven, so I won't try 
 me to decide whether the devil resembles 
 the green sky, there's a fleeting; 
 
 and where I couldn't return, my old age 
 as my toes regard by accident, 
 
 what does my body praise me now?
