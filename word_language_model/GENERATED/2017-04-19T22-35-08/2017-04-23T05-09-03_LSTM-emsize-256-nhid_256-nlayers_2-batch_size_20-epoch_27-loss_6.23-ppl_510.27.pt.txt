Back 

 To a wood window bright with tears at the whittled dirt table, 
 A slice of rust. 
 I sate at the last of the future before 
 And following my children made the robins opening a bus out there, 
 And the lupine roared and downstairs the few days go back again. 
 
 So I strove, Mary laughed on a small success? 
 You passed upon me! 
 
 Dogs like Landed torn, still I picked my 
 Velvet head to a tennis star
