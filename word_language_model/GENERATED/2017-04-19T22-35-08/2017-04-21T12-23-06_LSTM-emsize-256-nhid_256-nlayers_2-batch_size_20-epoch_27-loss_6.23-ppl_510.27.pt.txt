Reach; Long-Cherished 

 
 A steambath. No, leave in Nebraska 
 There's nothing here to make us sun; 
 The weak have slime and they might fare for ever. 
 
 Fit it was sensual planted. it was 
 Not like this, as if from this world of islands, 
 But more true in the field elders--or 
 Not by danger, but how far includes an eye 
 O'er the fair one's side, just emerged-- 
 A rose Carpaccio, in the moon that lies 
 In danger, and
