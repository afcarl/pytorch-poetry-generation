Sure To Lie And Writing Tooke, 

 To lick if their banks bobbed open by their dock, 
 clogging the Closet where it's nothing but an hour, 
 Caught on it, like a moon, machinery 
 To dislike the skirmish on the boulevard sea. 
 Judean He'd put the hand beside 
 New York Christian, wil you hear 
 That thirty voices folks had lately built 
 Like childhood bang. 
 
 Now for a lifetime, I heard the signs, 
 Making no one for a ship,
