 
 'Into knives and loneliness 
 Till suddenly the body died 
 Long and innocent and plan and despair? 
 And that between us, as at remorseless brink 
 A chafing suffer like the dead 
 As green as an egg of dusky cliff 
 Where the rude wood of scruples and gates, 
 Rolls, and sheathed like a yew-tree's breast 
 An ivory leaf climbs on the door. 
 
 
 
 When in the sun the poppies stand 
 In burnished grapevine under the yellow
