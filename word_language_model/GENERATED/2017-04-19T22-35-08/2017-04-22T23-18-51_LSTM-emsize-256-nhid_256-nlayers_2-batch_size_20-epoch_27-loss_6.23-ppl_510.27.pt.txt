His Paper. . . . It Is 

 The day I am back in the sweat by trying to chant beaverboard 
 
 toil. The blonde walk along against the mineworks 
 well-known grass 
 Made millions of some more deep aequales 
 Singing from the spring shining foxes and holes, the wild 
 Jew dog rises and brighten in his mouth, 
 
 stop renewd. 
 
 And who can mean and lie at the bottom of his sleep, 
 he looks as if he'd had anything
