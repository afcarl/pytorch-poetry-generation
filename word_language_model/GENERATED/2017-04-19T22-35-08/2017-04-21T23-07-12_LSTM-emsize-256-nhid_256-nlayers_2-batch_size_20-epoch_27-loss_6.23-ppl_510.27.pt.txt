 
 The day I changed I loved today 
 And the startled thunder surrender cloister, 
 Warm faces run in black, 
 St. yoke baby. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Kings They Queen 
 
 
 On a bank in the trappings, stark in the Ph{oe}be 
 It never noticed nothing. You were hungry 
 To find phony aches with your tongue - 
 You have spill me down and go to the bathroom. 
 Light begins to roll a froth and stairs.
