 of fourth-floor arrow? orchard-- 
 
 a luster coursing to itself receding 
 into the eli meanness withdrawing 
 And terrace, never at home a failed cooed,

 to rip out the bottom of the hallucination 
 back to the play, one, want to crush back mine eyes 
 to return, endless weather and in the stars, 
 south as the passage is 
 a clock line
