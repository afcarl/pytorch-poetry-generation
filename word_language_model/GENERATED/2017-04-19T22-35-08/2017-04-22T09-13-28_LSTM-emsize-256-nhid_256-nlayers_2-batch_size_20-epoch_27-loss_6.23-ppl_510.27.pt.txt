 
 Capricious virile, Again I branch, 
 The virgin's robe broke in the waves, 
 And try to meet you unsealed 
 With losing pattering confidence 
 The slipped-between 
 The body's meditation in the axisâ€” 
 And cows, when Time is loosed 
 Road him, nothing else is pure to rage, 
 A stone hang-- shape, with no sky, in its breeze. 
 O'er the stones of the auctioning. 
 We can somehow all have left that island, 
 reeds: 
 Quoth our hairiness, 
 Life
