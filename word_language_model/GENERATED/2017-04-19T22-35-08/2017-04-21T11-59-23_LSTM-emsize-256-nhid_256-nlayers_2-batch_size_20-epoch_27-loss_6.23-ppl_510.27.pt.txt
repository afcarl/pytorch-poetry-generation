 
 In the Spring where foxes and beans. 
 That equal shower; Augustine's 
 Path fresh for our love 
 
 Like West! 
 Taut salt 
 
 Light 
 Grew like a tree 
 Only a mower 
 Like the shade of a long life 
 In which the shifting workings of 
 Let them wake their inarticulate creeds, 
 And Praise with their success as they have done, 
 Who should have come to come and sing. 
 How will that peace or trudge
