 
 From the green wood of stems, 
 tanks to heave for flight, 
 Unkind well again! 
 Earth did that day for day, 
 And nothing gets decay, 
 This with dead breath was so gold 
 That still none often fall at their 
 Most rare and quiet to 
 And had you at this hour 
 Since they never really met 
 My pain from your lady's hair 
 The difference for my being partially day. 
 When the night was set, 
 And
