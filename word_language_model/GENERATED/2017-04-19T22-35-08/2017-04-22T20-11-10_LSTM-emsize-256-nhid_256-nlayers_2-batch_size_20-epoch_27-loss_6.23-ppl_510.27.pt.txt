Back Stink Eye 

 Among them people read further down, fade toward images 
 
 And we drove home from all of; collects 
 behind them drinking as if they were a pathless stone 
 foothills around the house both dried hands. 
 They sang, our pencil wildly. yet mostly in strangers, 
 A Lindbergh, just a failed yard a delicate balloon 
 Beyond the meal of our ancient War, this family of holy beech, 
 A feather. A man saying thatâ€™s love 
 To act the air
