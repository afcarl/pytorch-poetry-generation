From From Heaven, 

 the other's frosting gray. 
 
 It breaks home. As if for a moment I'm 
 a best in a small place. Out of my face 
 the sun clipped down his brush 
 and I sat up conjugated 
 years round, floating low in time 
 that my wheels are, onlyâ€”and of earth. 
 
 The sea is passing low 
 light meets the fled: 
 left behind him victim gone home, 
 beyond himself to jeweled simultaneously 
 steel undulating streets with
