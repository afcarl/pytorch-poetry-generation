 Proud to the god do tell, having Live, 
 
 VI 
 
 Skies together for the ache to flame 
 The nameless heart may all be found, 
 And Westerne cowslips with the boughs 
 Lifted imaginary spoils. 
 
 The child of signs is fromâ€” doth the lioness retained 
 The famous Thames. The moans send their priest, 
 But to thee from out their fancy'd happy kindly goodnesse 
 Those are that blessed wings of ages all.
