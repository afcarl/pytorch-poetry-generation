 This is not the source of excellence 
 
 Either out of fear. 
 That morning men may dance to pull out, and they have 
 Just loved, distort till we fail it 
 In both their families, little joy: wasn't kept 
 The hundred of us in black faces. 
 
 God bless them for health 
 The beings," twinkling, on their roots, 
 And they can see rids 
 The risen--we y-knowe, and fill at us with the ebb-tide!
