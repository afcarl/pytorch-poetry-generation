Blue Light 

 Had beaten away more room, 
 Silent, over the moon." 
 
 And the world has little had left; 
 And sail the dreamers out again, 
 And midst too small, and far apart, 
 Because all rest a crime is whate'er 
 To begin, and not to recall; 
 All grave's the serious restless love, 
 
 The air we built our fearful home: 
 In nature lifts the water without a gust, 
 Its name more pleasing and its mind 
 Is lost,
