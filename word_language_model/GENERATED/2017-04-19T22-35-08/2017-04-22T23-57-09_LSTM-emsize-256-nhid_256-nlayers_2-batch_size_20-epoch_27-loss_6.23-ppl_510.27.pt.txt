Not The Accurate. 

 Oh death is my heart to be indifferent 
 If you must know if you could. 
 
 
 This Saskatoon; for its victim's crime 
 The eastern wheel in the crag. 
 
 Too far from either world in bands: 
 
 That ruin no journey can see. 
 What tic me with the devil toppling pack, 
 Whose charter'd trees, the unclean glow 
 Of loss is earthly of grass and the space, 
 The country when the patient flower is red,
