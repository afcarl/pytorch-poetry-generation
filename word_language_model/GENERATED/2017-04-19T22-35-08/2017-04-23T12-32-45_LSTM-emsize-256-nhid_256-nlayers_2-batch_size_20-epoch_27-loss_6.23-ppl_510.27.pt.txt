The Third Few Sacks Would 

 drive beneath our faces, trailing it 
 Below implosion of Collective licks fall. 
 
 When thoâ€™ rests safe into the wind, 
 
 To-be-forgotten palms trembled sloop. this 
 Four holy road glowing in profile 
 
 leaves across the highway near where 
 
 its double smile colors--all light in the heavens. 
 
 
 
 I dreamed I had never been in the mirror 
 for an trinity but a bit of it, and a loaf of distortion
