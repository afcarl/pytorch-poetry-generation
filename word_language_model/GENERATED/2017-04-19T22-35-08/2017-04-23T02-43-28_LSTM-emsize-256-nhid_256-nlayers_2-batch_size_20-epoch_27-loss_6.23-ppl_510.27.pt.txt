 He talks with waves, 
 he was there familiar, 
 beaten underneath her: 
 the photograph was 
 expiations from a far crayon 
 and found a little v

 was deep in ligature. 
 sweet place so cold, his mop, 
 
 his voice, three others wear the lanes 
 on their knees without pain. 
 The wind above them had burst the sky.
