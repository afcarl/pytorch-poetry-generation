That Unwandered Reveries. 

 
 As winds decay, we sleep, the blameless nation, 
 They look like pearl upon the wood or May, 
 Poured softly over the great fire, 
 Over the milken mound that surely mourn. 
 
 Let not the loud Leader take it in! 
 I sep'rate, and thou Epiphany stormful 
 Before its brave and secret kind of breath, 
 With the throned coat of the shaven shore; 
 The all-beholding cloaks of flame. 
 
 Day after night by Time's deep bed
