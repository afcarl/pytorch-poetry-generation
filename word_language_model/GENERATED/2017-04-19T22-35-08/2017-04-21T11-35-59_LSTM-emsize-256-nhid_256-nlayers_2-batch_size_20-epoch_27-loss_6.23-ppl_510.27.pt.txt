Proximity 

 To that little creature 
 I can last in these poems 
 Or else by shame because it will open 
 Your face is very weak 
 And they say your problems then please. 
 
 The dream which is patient, 
 The poem is nearly salt, 
 And I am living, am you all examiner, 
 You are the blossom I am sick, 
 Like Atad brown and blue I hearbs 
 
 From the accused of boy-king 
 Not ever. For you, 
 Oh
