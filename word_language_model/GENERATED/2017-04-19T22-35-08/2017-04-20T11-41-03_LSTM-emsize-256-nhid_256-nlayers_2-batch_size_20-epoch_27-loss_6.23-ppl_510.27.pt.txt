Drone: 

 
 
 
 stubble-fields, cripple voices resides, 
 Wrapped up in soothes the night, and silvery streams, 
 Wrung from the wood, the haze above the lounge 
 of distance, the godsbody, cloths and spreading, Vajra 
 crystals bob and quiver in the palm of sky shall fall, 
 and listens in rising in the lovely acres 
 of gravel, distant hills of hete, blood. 
 Nothing like danger is a river toward 
 the tree tuition scraped the murmurs of its eyes.
