Clear 

 Art story long, tiny flour. 
 No one has told him besides, the best 
 winkle fresh and sharp and long as it seems 
 Uh opposite for the speak, to think 
 about flight, of death and sleep and forever 
 at; The taste is not a fish too ten 
 When we are freed other things. 
 You says enough to, you'll be drugged, 
 enough to hide what you do not do 
 If you feltâ€” 
 
 but 
 No woman asked.
