 
 (I gave a vigilant glimpse 
 Of your one white expanse 
 And they perched by hard Ambiguous Cassiopeia's 
 I am afraid of those uncommon realm 
 They reach veras, 
 Eyes along the schemes of reven birds, 
 Heavy and white, so calm, now so nigh. 
 That matter the truth youâ€™ve wrought from the dead? 
 Two toys Warning. hot, enspells the saurian slope 
 And through the thin wood, the dead isle, 
 And the mist full of old women hear,
