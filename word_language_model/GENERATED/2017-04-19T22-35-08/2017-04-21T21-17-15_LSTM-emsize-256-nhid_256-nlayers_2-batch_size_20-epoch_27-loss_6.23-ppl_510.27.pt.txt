 Maximus, in every spirit 
 You cut your eyes to catch my death. 
 
 No cow has begun the leaves 
 Of water in white wind, transaxle, 
 parch; once a night connecting me from her memories 
 You spaces yourself and tying up a swagger 
 Or i searched you to try, about two years. 
 At the fibrous streak the railroad all you 
 Over the skin 
 Paused like a man 
 disturbed her like a salve 
 exhumation Rule 
 
 And
