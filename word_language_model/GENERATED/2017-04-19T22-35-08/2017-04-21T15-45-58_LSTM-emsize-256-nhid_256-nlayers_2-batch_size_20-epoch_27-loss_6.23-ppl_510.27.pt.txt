 A chance, open with the first half of the song. 
 Wisdom is the sea and is whispering on asbestos 
 And oats and repulsion and oil arise, looking up. 
 They prepare for children unto Analysed and need, 
 Go back into the stillness of the old swimmin'-hole. 
 
 The leaves shut behind great growths between corn, panels of self- 
 portrait with a Red bow of scarlet bulbs chipware in trucks 
 And garlic spurned by words crack by their schools the roar
