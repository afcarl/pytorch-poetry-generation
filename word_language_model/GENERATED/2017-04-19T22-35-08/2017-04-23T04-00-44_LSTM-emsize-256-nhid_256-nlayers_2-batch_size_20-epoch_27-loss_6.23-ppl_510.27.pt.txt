Dining Rapt 

 
 Light of an antique waveless crazy-quilt 
 Of dates, in double prime 
 The darkness of flesh was softer, and yet 
 
 The flakes of water rounded into empty snow 
 
 The bars were all free of a parrot, 
 black as two hills lifted, taking them out 
 
 The flap of heads whispered for: 
 The years spread like bucket; though it 
 
 Must excitable, an angel, no fear 
 natureâ€™s faceless garner'd to raise, 
 
 She herself
