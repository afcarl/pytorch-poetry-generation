From Blood-Red And Fleets 

 Paul will find the burden of horses, 
 no one can ever come again. 
 
 Eons would make water fruit cold. 
 Whilst the clouds go rolling in, 
 circling the gold sea; 
 he's digging into a black wood, 
 fire, therefore, as an egg dispense 
 the gliding cottage on the deep table 
 without sight. 
 
 
 
 The seasonals then surround them 
 their tinsel ash. 
 Their fathers play like bees, having got change?
