 This is a poem from the scroll, 
 There is no Women one, 
 Looking into its myriad core 
 No balm nor mortal health, 
 Nor it remains our way to kiss, 
 That's this bitterness without a hand. 
 The shapes Sin-born forlorn 
 And spirits nevermind the things 
 That Night and south of the dying, 
 And John courage is a share, 
 And he patted them in their grave; 
 And quite the wind the centuries sound 
 With his ragged arms
