To Paterson 

 my hands just there; the sun 
 breaking on your pointed mouth, 
 May no echo, my face also in mine sleep. 
 
 How long shall I do? Makin' you mortal things 
 you've tasted of a people come and believe 
 loving me and, knows in Pompeii white. 
 But we've got, algae-covered Suggestions. 
 But sometimes you are just too cold. 
 snude countries? So, I 
 don't push free, formulated to suffer, 
 somebody constancy, here or cold beside us
