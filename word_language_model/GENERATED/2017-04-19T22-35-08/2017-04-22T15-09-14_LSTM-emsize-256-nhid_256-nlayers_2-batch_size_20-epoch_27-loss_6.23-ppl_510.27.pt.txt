 My friends, don't do-- 
 By the dozen slumbers, and one has lie. 
 I know what I have known and wrong? 
 
 Don't turn, a foot so wistfully 
 Upon this stony side! 
 Damn it everything to me. 
 
 Wines wheel and hawks 
 Slide up from dreams to William, stars, 
 That never been a farmhouse high, 
 Yet many a anus. 
 
 The organ comes, the wide wind, 
 When the thirsty dawn it was glad, 
 The hospital road,
