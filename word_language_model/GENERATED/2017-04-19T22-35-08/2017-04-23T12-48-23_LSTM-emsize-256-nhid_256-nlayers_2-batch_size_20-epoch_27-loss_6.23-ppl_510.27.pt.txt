The Tires 

 Are secretive, maybe more beautiful 
 Quite already, and the best 
 
 Not keeping death, hearing 
 The letter. Now don't care had 
 prior to a day's blow,â€” 
 the turret is beautiful. 
 Quotes from the metal River, 
 Gave out the songs of Patience, 
 
 The rule opens down and break. 
 
 The rapt place 
 Is summer 
 The pretend is seen, 
 The real life is not pines: 
 The merely sound, 
 Thy love in span,
