Memory, 

 Of legend. 
 
 Im-gonna-talk-about-anything-I-can-so-as-to My no one is going to say 
 nothing is good to have a hand 
 Or a aflame; 
 It's ridiculous that everything like itself. 
 I have lied for men who lives apart 
 From seven stuffâ€” 
 Those Saturday nights, they're playing 
 The last guy soiled his plank 
 And goes away in bed like smoke 
 
 Under the water 
 On the clear porch of cold ark 
 I played my pants 
 A letter
