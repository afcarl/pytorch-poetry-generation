And Son 

 stingless at the old young men stop. 
 
 III. 
 
 When the cathedral speak the executioner's arm 
 With the intertwine, 
 leans out 
 The steaming pageantry of a human 
 account: 
 The man who looks around the surface, 
 His outer breathing, then spread 
 Devine, out of a tooth of frost. 
 Farther away in his bed, at his door in the day, 
 In the sterile black Radio station, he pulled it from his eyes.
