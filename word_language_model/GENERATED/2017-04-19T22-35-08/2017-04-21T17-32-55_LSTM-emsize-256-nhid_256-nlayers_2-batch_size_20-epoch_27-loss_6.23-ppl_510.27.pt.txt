 
 From outlook, or half-chewed or Gates-Ajar, 
 
 Read his form of a broom MacKie, 
 Later the rain slide down 
 The splashed stream is astringent-- 
 And bursting the dark reappearance 
 Of its ignorance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Autumn broke 
 
 
 Once I was an instrument 
 The apple in sunshine 
 Like some goose lights on the raindrops 
 Downstairs I knelt for my flecked shoes 
 Before my eyes 
 â€” 
 Sleep; cling to my extremities.
