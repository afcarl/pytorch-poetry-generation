In The Black House 

 Of Greek gold to sackcloth else with 
 And other prone women 
 KÃ©eps Eye survived browses, 
 
 A skin is meant 
 Must always erased with flame 
 Oh weak-sung like a bee, is organic. 
 
 "In fact we can do. 
 Come on; we go on in God's hands, 
 betray, and try to pray; 
 Out whole for fear of generation, 
 The immense, face of her hair; 
 But now it's cold, it's hard to eat.
