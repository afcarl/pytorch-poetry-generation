 
 In a cave of trees, toward the assembled time, 
 in the west, trying to be older. 
 As under a slab of light goes between the roof 
 that's where the clouds split on. 
 Maybe it is whole as the people singing 
 as the fathers return to the moist acre of those flowers 
 whine inside the moon-sparked surface 
 of high passing debating flowers officer, 
 women and girls with animals and men. 
 There is no longer a label 
 after
