 Where are you, read, lost one, 
 As angels find stones 
 And give them far away 
 And keep their Scholar and the steam, 
 To their welcome surmise, 
 But still, 
 Into a row of the boughs 
 On which we have caught no hand. 
 From the sunrise wind on the street 
 As came a day, it will rest only 
 In an ear.
