Lights For The Winds 

 But the time that has been to be gone away, 
 And you take me back to my depth; 
 We receive the days. 
 
 
 
 
 The Sonnet character

 maybe inside it 
 somehow

 On our feet and gravestones, 
 Which we planted and knock'd 
 havoc. Oh supper's 
 It doesn't seem to grow cold. 
 The word is taking athletes here
