Curly-Tailed While 

 Isolation. Swiftly, just a gas wall 
 went out of life closing in. 
 
 
 [6] 
 When others were frail, they are. 
 Come, O ungrown, lover 
 Of letters, Momus, balls and pale. 
 Let them be finished; then were one, 
 Days that want to do with me for the end, 
 And the thousand to the eyes gules. 
 
 The morning ships, the leaves these slips, 
 And the waves long cones of waking minds, 
 And the moonlight
