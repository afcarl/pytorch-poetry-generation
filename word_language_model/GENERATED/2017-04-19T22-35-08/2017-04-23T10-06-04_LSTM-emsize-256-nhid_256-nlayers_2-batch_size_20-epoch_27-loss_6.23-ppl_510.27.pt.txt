 That flow and design 
 For us her funerals 
 so that she would still gore. 
 
 The grace of common cause 
 thrashes and answered let him shut her head 
 
 With your "ray shot away, 
 Her face breaks third-string 
 
 Bless her, with his fists. 
 
 She saw through an eagle 
 Who set on high-pitched; down 
 To thought her curtsies to-night.
