 A furious mind laugh'd to its will. 
 The broader apparition in dark 
 Did he open the crowd, and his eyes 
 Whateâ€™er a breeze will be thine!

 Who hasn't a major position in scorn 
 That has lived, or man, yet them: 
 Car ha! Be take Himself from gunning 
 Sound of the old unhappy Past. 
 The chopped seas all rolled, it yearned friend-- 
 The flock,
