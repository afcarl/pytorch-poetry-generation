Plain 

 And beside the trail redbirds 
 It felt the port, and its flowers 
 Shall be dim and dim in Prate 
 And in that sad fiery fruit; 
 
 By the long air that outlasts any word. 
 And when then forsaken it went around before thousands of our 
 family. 
 Right back again, night, 
 And here the worlds are ageless women: 
 It is orange, tugs the laurels â€“ 
 No kind to-morrow paperboys loves, 
 The suns are seamed and almost
