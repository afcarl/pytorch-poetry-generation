 The world, the swan-necked hole and years 
 mosses, blind man. 
 
 Because they were or really 
 having fallen 
 away miles me slowly . . . 
 scalpels 
 On the old ground 
 In a hat the sleeping order 
 darklit not, as if this had a brief noise 
 At musicâ€”not goodbye me to be many. Older than the man 
 squeezes the fire over swaddled fingers on three yards 
 Until the teenage lifted sign 
 Buon guard with quill)
