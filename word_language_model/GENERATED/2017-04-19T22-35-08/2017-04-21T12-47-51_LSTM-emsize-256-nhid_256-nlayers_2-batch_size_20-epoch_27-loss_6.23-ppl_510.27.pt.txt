 
 The trip conceal'd, 
 Is like no one can end 
 In the frail days than leaves 
 stowaway like a seeker regret, 
 
 breather Home and register 
 As among them, 
 Though engravers while the continents' clouds 
 The glories intense as Improvise. 
 
 What shall my teeth do when I have 
 One human trace, one momentary body 
 The subject is but as a lover 
 Of course does not exist, O Child radiating. 
 Where is the blessed devil
