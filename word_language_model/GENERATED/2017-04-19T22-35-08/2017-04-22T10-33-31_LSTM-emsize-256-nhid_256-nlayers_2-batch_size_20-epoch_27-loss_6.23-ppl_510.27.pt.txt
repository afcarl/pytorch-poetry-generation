Friends, 

 
 And found the swallow -- 
 
 Now cooked as though to go on off over, 
 Look'd for eight little children to seek, 
 And volatile, our daughters as the guns began 
 
 More better than the winds rest and they, 
 When joyless joy and shadows grow, -- 
 Bees like a mountain's dying mien 
 
 A happy year--& in the Desires 
 
 Got hide.' though with no rim 
 
 The veil Would first be luckier. Met enough
