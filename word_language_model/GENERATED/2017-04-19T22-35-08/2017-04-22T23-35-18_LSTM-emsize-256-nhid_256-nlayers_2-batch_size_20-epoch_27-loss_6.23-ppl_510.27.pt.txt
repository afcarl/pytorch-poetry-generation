 That I could get a bride; 
 I shall take a somewhat soul to be above: 
 I will wear out my fortunate jazz, 
 In each house a sparrow she says, 
 behind-- my soul from the earth there, 
 smiling; my son, year in the storm, 
 You will hold your purity at a pan. 
 
 III 
 A clasp, butterfly, a fig note: 
 An axis of shapesâ€”the abused us 
 shuffling through make? 
 A barge caught in the east place.
