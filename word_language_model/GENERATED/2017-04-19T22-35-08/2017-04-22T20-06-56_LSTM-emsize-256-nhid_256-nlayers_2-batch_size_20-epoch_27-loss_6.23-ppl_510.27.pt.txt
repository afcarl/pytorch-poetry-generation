Dan Dilate, 

 Content to be sent away 
 Under the stem- when we shaved the moon 
 Gazing over the island at San a.m. 
 Stooping o'er the river, among all the pine-trees 
 Inside your face and a day threading the moon. 
 
 Through the valley under the flower of the field, 
 Wandering below it trembles to rest 
 On the sands of boomlay, oak. The game's curses magical, death 
 Something filthy and enterprises and breathing. 
 Full of persons seems trotting on
