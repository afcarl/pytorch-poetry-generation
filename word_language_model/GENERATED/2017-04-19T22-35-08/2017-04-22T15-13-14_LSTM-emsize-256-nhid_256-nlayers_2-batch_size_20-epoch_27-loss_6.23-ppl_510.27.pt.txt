In My Eye 

 Mr. glut, the dog without pack of what I were, 
 But I know that it is true to be in my talent or shown all, 
 Not even a tear, it, so take up the cliff as 
 I can fuse in a novel, I will taste Bruising two done, 
 But as I in it, I cannot tell for my dear sake 
 Itself and so is the comrade. 
 
 So, trip your life back a moment made in love love
