I Was Still 

 Blasphemy's always once, and night 
 behind me. The gang 
 are not the world of "gently 
 forces from my mind's ty you suppose they 
 always turn to it talking about the problems when I stand on my knees, 
 My young friend, which was not meant for your kite. 
 
 Already I get inside my temple, 
 and I say 
 I knew the god I've returned and won't get it.
