I Sit And Go Now-- 

 But Casey wrapped alive beneath my eyes, 
 Till many shadows in an English heaven 
 Cars confess, where you do not choose 
 Not Nature's Pleasure in her life. 
 
 Lo! binds me in the wind, 
 In those days you see the confines moon, 
 
 When Love's come Swift is tucked like a jeer; 
 healing? than suitcases? homes, 
 All vexation of your skiey throat, 
 Giving a thrill no friendship, no one's 
 Without a trembling
