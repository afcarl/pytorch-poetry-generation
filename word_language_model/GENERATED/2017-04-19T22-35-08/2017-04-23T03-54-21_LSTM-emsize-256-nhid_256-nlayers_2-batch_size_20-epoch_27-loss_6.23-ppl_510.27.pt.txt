 
 Farewell to the moon 
 In the crowded garden there, 
 Four garlands of an high-back'd saxophone stem, a dresser. 
 Yet only a child carves a tiny sheath, 
 And sheds her gently in the dog's free. 
 Happy her, bandy-legged black young gossip, 
 Leading the ground by the spirit's mirth 
 She sent to meet the death-bed more bitter anodynes. 
 
 Closing my vermilion course, had I not done, 
 And bear in Summer's grief to hoar-frost, 
 And honour wonder'd and
