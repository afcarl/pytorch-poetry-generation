From The Barbed Town, 

 He's falling, and bright biographers 
 Did also serve a memory with language 
 Which loves in it. One hour expressed 
 Where frequent lights of cloud is long. 
 
 Then, damned leaving. I walk 
 With sour thighs and young witness 
 Doth pine before weight would lead 
 The new inner man's lungs by the ends 
 Of the desert faces called off build. 
 
 
 
 They go to shoot forgotten, 
 especially if they lie saying
