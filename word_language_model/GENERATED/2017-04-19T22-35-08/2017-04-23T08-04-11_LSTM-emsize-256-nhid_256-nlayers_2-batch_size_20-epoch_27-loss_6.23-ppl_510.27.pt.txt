Ground, 

 We morningâ€”and after death, and even, 
 While the harsh breasts, and the tender breeze 
 Went back to pore and the wild flower spoke 
 Of a great star that in its shadow did wound; 
 With its wavering lone Largest hungry refrain. 
 Laugh like these, each tossed-up air dimmed heel 
 of soffit and cream, waving the still away. 
 
 
 
 The persona intelligence (the proctors and Chamber in the chorus. 
 Don't never open nor be precise. 
 
 Please
