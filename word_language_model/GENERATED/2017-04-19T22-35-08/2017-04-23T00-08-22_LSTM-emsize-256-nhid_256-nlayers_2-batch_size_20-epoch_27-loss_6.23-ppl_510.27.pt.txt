The Great Seas, And The Door 

 Is folded and coming from its planisphere. 
 
 If only a child is a woman only, 
 The hangman keeps singing 
 Again she opens her hands and rumbled 
 
 Already go chambers on or over. 
 She sings music in 
 Shadows all morning, 
 Its wide fill to enrich 
 Her eyes so mute 
 Are she cured with her hand 
 Upon this small harbor slit 
 Every singing of surprise, 
 Could touch their cast
