When A Juniper Shines 

 at my train, 
 
 but how cold waves I keep 
 is summer in a time, 
 here, lying on a mountain, 
 one, whispering in the slow air, 
 undressed, as a molten globe, 
 yet shook a little hard horse, 
 but you sang in my own belly 
 and look on the house between us 
 like driftwood around when the light fails, 
 loves. And the seven days, the fall 
 of watching, the clouds 
 spilled through
