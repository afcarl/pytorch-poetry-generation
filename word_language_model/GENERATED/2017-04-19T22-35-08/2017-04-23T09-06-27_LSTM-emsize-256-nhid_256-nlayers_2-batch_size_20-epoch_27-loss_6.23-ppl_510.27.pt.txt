On A Log, 

 And walked from the trunks, 
 
 And soon the rest undressed, 
 stuns the rainy light of matters. 
 We will be stench of petals, pure 
 Frame safe to our graves. 
 
 Hope us your bed on the earth, 
 Hear your eyelids feed as rare 
 As stone, the leaf that rushes, 
 That evening shall prove the sun 
 Falling a little music through, 
 To your dearest child will spare, 
 What though my soul should hear;
