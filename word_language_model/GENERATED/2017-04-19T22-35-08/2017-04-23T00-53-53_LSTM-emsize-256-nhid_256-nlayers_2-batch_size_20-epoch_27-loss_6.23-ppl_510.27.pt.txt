But What Could You Be 

 You saved into Venice 
 Say not looking for once she was, 
 And what will darkness tell you to do, 
 And you do not remember that part of a death 
 Some difference communion 
 Twenty o'clock 
 Succumbed to 
 A love without a taste, 
 
 Till somewhere the time 
 This, when you go again 
 
 All you have but cannot be 
 Krasnystaw 
 stopping the slow 
 love widening 
 To be close
