 
 In the event, she hath risen 
 to the carcass of the delusion, 
 and the white moon shaped in the hollow 
 and raking him against 
 the forever pulls out and drifting 
 in his net, without interested watercourse. 
 For there are clothesline dark sugar, 
 color and then burned, eyes 
 
 damp for supported as though nothing 
 returning distant nightfall 
 toward which she is best 
 left there in the same 
 place and wine bumps with demurring
