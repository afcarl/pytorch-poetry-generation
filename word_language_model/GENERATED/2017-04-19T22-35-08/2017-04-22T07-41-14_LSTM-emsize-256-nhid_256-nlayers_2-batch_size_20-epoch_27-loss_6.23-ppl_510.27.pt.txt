The Battle 

 That part, once squeezes from town, 
 And Womens statues, pause 
 And just as it might be unraveling. 
 
 I weep to find talk again. 
 
 I have proved ground surprise, 
 And peering down between us. 
 Well, what's it for? explain-- 
 One, carrying himself? 
 Much and you once heard 
 You hold your pose, your banner, 
 For you died in Tidings 
 Like can the people 
 Say Griboedovs – and has been – 
 Lie so
