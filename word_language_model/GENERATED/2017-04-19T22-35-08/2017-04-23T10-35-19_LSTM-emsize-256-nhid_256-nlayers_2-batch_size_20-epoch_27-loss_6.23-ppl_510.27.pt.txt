Up To The Bells. 

 
 His faceless face would be caught. 
 The wooden seeds brought up again 
 All have an unearthly fate 
 Of a great Broadway greed!

 White feet of a continent. 
 Three nine years' coral, lakes and main, 
 A neighborhood crackling and wide. 
 Two strings so high, the rocks dies. 
 The fragments with a willow hardly workshirt
