 
 For the soul set over my head 
 And the meaningâ€”little Spanish bull 
 Still down the hill again, the night 
 Tipped as a swatter shades. 
 There the bright sun glaze, the shadow 
 Of leaves and resonated 
 Returning to the string 
 Of gravel hissing slightly by. 
 You, the shadow of the swivel 
 Ever falls right to the trees 
 
 The siege in being design; 
 
 A firecat trembles forward, 
 An old crab in the hour
