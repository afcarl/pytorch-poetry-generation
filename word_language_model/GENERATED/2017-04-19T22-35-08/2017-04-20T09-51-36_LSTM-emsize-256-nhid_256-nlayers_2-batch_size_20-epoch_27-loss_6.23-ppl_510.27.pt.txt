Merriment 

 The seven of them 
 Standing in flesh 
 To cry 
 
 Like a flame, 
 waters.... 
 
 'You do not duty 
 I might have noticed nothing 
 I do not am heard. 
 
 I am; I am lonely. 
 No, am there come up to the time! 
 Their best goes in and right 
 And keeps my work to us. 
 I cannot get away. 
 They were buried and killing 
 That they could procure 
 On other town
