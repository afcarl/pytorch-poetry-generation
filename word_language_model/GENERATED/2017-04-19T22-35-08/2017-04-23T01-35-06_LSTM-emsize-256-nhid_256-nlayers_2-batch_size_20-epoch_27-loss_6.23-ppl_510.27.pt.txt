 Seeds were lashed by night 
 
 The Lethe of its Electroshock 
 tolerated a gesture, into each station 
 
 Looking in large 
 
 Now, 
 
 bogles fountain went, 
 
 Snow summer's clouds caught 
 
 On my hands and poisoned my head, 
 
 My species. now I am shining 
 unconfessed out, stay issued as it slowly dies. 
 
 
 
 
 Who carries light and bone 
 And Eye and Stella turn to cover 
 With the great pleasure,
