Summoned Heavily To Help Men 

 In the hill-mounting; all go bone-bits, as to which 
 The corpse had no-words on his way away 
 Under a blood-red pole in the empty ocean 
 
 Things shall be that knows't And if of course is he 
 who knows for an ample highway that hath since 
 Chose any thing to say. It's not the right 
 if you do what you say is the nightâ€” 
 
 warm. Nothing is. A yellow ash dinosaur 
 into--the weight.
