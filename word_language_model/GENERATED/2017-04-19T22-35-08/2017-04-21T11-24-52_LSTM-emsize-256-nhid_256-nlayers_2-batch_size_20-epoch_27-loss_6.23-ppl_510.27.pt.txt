Turtle. 

 We ripped into the rim of the hall 
 On itself with its holders shot the beach one fall on the fingertips 
 And a staring into the desert, or a spy 
 Or the fist over the diesels telling deer-dancer's 
 The tremor against a tree painted in the air, 
 Townsman of those green energy. Which, 
 From this land where we gather out there our head, the narrow 
 shell of cloud which worked the long way, yet 
 And no fools watch
