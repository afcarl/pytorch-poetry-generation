In Hand, Like An Easter 

 summer as the river passed, 
 
 Which even sincere, 
 though I didn't know it, nor do you see 
 
 bold!" loved me must not send 
 
 God That come off. I guess at haven't 
 
 seen on me, nothing blue-gray and strange 
 
 ever kind ties to be stolen 
 
 we'll fall up among the hemlock, 
 
 you, whatever do we wish to be wears 
 and late winter losing rehearsal or what,
