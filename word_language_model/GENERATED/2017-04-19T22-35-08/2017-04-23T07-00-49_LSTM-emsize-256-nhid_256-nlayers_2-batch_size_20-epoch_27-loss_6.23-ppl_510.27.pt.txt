 9. I sit down all the rest 
 
 mother 
 
 Wreathed on Babel's villagers 
 buckled against the first future 
 thousandes their night & is 
 comfortable morsels of things 
 To be true. Believing is 
 instantly 
 Kind there is still pain with the glow 
 The forest of time's hair beneath the crack and burrowing inside our stars. 
 
 The car wall turning, 
 The sun, blowing at night like a dance,
