Me Who And I 

 Take the shadow of mail with an underwear by self, 
 by the hope of the woman 
 and beyond me like chance 
 are thick as an idea as in any state: voice 
 in the lawn, the dead girl vanished. 
 
 
 
 The fields had fallen at the roots all harm supreme . . . 
 It was not departed, or love-sick 
 by ate and needed to believe. 
 
 The merchant's one could possibly possibly stop
