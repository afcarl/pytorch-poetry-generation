 No a myself: perhaps Thoughts tramped 
 Singing through the mindâ€™s petals. 
 
 As for me I sing, 
 My love, against vanity, 
 Of fully wishes, who sighed: 
 From my mother this cannot be the last. 
 So so is the downward of the dank 
 Though I led you again 
 On the living day of the possessed landscape 
 I laugh and being carried at last 
 And ease a bit, and unseen 
 Of rooms by what alone: 
 Too much
