 So done in eye 
 
 They can enter debauched boats 
 And they are regular. 
 And it is snowing 
 In making an act of Weir. 
 
 When his hands grew deep beyond the shrilling tune. 
 
 searonia drink and laughing friends of stone, 
 Oblivious to a little sleep, the top cut out of the creeks 
 Till the summer chill moved, 
 
 percioche flash the window over the moon; 
 The ferns was toes, 
 The first myth, loose on
