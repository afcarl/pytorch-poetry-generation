He Ended By The Core, 

 Through these little pieces of shells. 
 
 A little tired of a forest, and a breath 
 Took the brush in that meadow, the plaster. 
 I had scared a tiny worker 
 After an old photo, named in his prison clay. 
 But it was an angel better than a dream. 
 One is sick of the woman who whispers, 
 Strange think I did live with the first, 
 A judgment, of a very calm and girl's.
