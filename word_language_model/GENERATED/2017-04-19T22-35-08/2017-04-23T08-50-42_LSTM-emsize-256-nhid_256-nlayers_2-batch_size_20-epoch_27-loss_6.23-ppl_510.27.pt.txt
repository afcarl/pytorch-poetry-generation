 Silent, towards arid miles 
 And elegy very restless 
 Inside the water of the coming 
 Not yet to come, but soon must be, 
 
 While dodo-driven, or spilt blue growth hell 
 And all the waves gushed and still to be 
 
 finished. spiking pod, then bobbed off the cliffs, 
 The mounds and bums together when voyeur and his tectonic paws 
 Hung with us towards it. It comes to us green.
