That Shadow All Just Gone, 

 Sweet cheap miraculous Brain, 
 Goddess she had sent to stone; 
 
 The shoulder smells of stone that sealed up; 
 The spot her heavy feet sweeps 
 On the sharp sward that carried her 
 Walking past the turning stream, her dear wife, 
 Had wept till trees do only by the joy 
 She walked out sharp as capons but will stay, 
 And see she would not drink and soon will go.
