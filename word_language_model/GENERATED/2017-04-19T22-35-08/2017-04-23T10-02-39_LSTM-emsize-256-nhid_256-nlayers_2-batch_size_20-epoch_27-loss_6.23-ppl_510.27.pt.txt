And Musing In Shades Manger 

 Go running up from in his throat. 
 
 Yesterday every morning, I remember when I guess'd. 
 I know the story of a child. 
 And now I suspected now too, 
 And what is done. 
 The day is beginning to attack 
 
 Your golden elements 
 Goes upon us, like that 
 
 That comes when Earth is gone. 
 
 The watchers flew out with them. 
 
 She sleeps in a swifter room, 
 
 And
