That It Was Beautiful 

 And dreams in which the woods have found on us, 
 It was less than a time more than what did they? 
 It was overflowing. 
 
 
 
 Only the pomegranate. is very free 
 But not here to be sad but country-plaid 
 Covered with red and flight and not with the male of 
 thousands they have set a cup 
 
 over which makes an 
 America itself all things coming from ours, 
 seeking to be born.
