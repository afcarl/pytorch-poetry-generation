 
 For agony, yeast, pond, done 
 Closing? Where is the house 
 Or really that--what?--that weather cozy gold iron. 
 
 And the walls around me there are pines in the skirts beyond 
 The ocean bamboo, Easie, pure, under dusk in taste 
 From where abstract, bear the last of stoppered and wares of sunlight, 
 Keeping wisdom for a few small container 
 Beyond the sharp coral and wild no more 
 spirituous webs than a rare boy. Only 
 The ladies to run
