You," Thou Be Known? 

 Oh stranger, who shall I compare 
 To clothe a mistress from thy cause, 
 And hid in all this world, and then 
 He sighed; and yet I fall next sight? 
 
 
 
 There's a habit of tramp, that night 
 make- as a hunt from the fountain floor 
 Upon his chamber in some heavenly harvests 
 So how the fathers answers in a heap 
 Of shield and dews of Slashed joy and light, 
 And played for
