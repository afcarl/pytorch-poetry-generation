Only It Feels That We Had All, 

 and the Rock yawns with its unlikely best big 
 pockets. 
 First every day grew morning o'er the sea. 
 Take it off from a fishhook 
 On our knees, lizards held it close forever. 
 
 The century was shed in a dream. 
 All time they made comes forth, 
 The small consciousness, and the swamp did harness! 
 The sudden tales of their bones, their flat 
 Pillows their heads like birds' heads on 
 Meaning.
