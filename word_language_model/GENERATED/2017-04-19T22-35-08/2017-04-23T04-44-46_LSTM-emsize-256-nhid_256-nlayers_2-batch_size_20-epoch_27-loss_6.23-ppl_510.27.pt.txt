Too 

 Those chains that pieces of crashes. 
 
 While the van shut windows 
 invade the threshold, and the Deconstructionists, 
 Fall asleep. He's a little boys 
 I wear hard shoes? All this is afraid 
 I leave the weather whole,' 
 
 Two eyes, insects filled with delicate tips, 
 
 And design, rock roar 
 
 And night and time 
 And the Blood of it 
 
 When the farmers blink summer, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Funeral Problem
