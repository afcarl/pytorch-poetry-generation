 When we smile at the end of the Whale. 
 Of pictures and extinguished --Like 
 James howled through an empty washâ€” 
 yawns, drinking wine and glass 
 behind him finding a peasant journalist 
 thought he had a nose or two apartment 
 up Logan, there is a hunter, 
 flames sprawl feeling all the discarded hands... 
 
 I will go forth and see segesta grappling-hook 
 & Dove-hauled orange, cracks.
