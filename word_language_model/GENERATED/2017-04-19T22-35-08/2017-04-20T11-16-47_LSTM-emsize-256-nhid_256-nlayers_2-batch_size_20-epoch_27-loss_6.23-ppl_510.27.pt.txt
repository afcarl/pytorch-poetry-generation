 
 Already the flick of his chest was white, 
 the flags flowed out on the sill 
 the wings of goblin blades 
 are Peona's corn, it 
 whose two wood-grain are clear 
 
 they are headlong 
 above a sunny night 
 edge of the god? 
 
 The cold breath leaving sight gnaw 
 like needles pro tipped to the west 
 
 row for the rendering I remember. 
 Feeling crackling green 
 on the super- blue 
 bright trunks of winter
