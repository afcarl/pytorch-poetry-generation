On Your Belly'S Brand-Name Gray Dahlias, 

 Mothers than night or under rain till the dawn was visible 
 Of the frozen purple erratic of houses; 
 They were all going over the woods flying from fighting drops 
 Up the fields of the night moist, when the seed was unbroken, 
 His quivering dump, and the strangled wind and toes, 
 described; its gold arms cold and hereafter sing 
 Of the girls with their golden heat. 
 The children were best when you are dullard
