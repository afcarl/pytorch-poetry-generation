Is A Man 

 And dream song to the man watering 
 His hygrometer mien, and when 
 Letting the plans, listen and set 
 Through the very sharp-edged musk, 
 fireballs ] province, ungrown, trays and melancholy.

 And wake to the tropics, 
 Nor starched curbs reeling down, 
 Send up to the durable; 
 The seats in his ear, Mixcoac colors, 
 birdtracks to the steady prayer. 
 
 The hoe is of river,
