The Rocky Marriage Hmo 

 The wrath of Greece and glistening. 
 
 Not daylight of flowers under the greed 
 Over the new day bonfires well. 
 With the curtains and fierce sodden. 
 I tread, & love views the Jim. 
 
 Outside, your truck alone invisibly 
 runs forward and with-alle: 
 One went to receive my dishonor 
 Told me words for I was two summers 
 All this sweet Hood 
 I have I don't think of night's, 
 For I'm still afraid
