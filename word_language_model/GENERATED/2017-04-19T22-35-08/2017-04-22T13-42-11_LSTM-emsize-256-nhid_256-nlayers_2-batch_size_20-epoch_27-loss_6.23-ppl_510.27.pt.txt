 What was the man who cannot know the banknotes 
 For the young furnace, this old god can, 
 That lives again, as on a refugee of rente 
 On the torn stones, and else Magnets 
 A dome! the swollen leaves; 
 A grain of a voice that cradles him, 
 Has still tough ivory, CHRONOS 
 On sluggish hushed mountains shark, 
 The desert slips of phenomena and information 
 Into ballerinas, hanging deep on the chimneys, 
 The wild warbler blights as the spirit
