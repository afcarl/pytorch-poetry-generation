 You all know of your time 
 Who suffers home among gentle things, 
 Which beauty is to hear my face. 
 
 
 
 
 
 projecting 
 
 
 Thy mother draws the fire ; with tulips that are stars 
 My sister and the moon are covered with gold, 
 Oh life is many-moving import me, 
 You will find the grape of the rain; 
 And you to be my life thin-thrown death, 
 Making your soul pris'ner in a faery end:
