I Did Meet, 

 and thrills that century: all the birds and women 
 mingled like sound. I owe them some such gold. 
 
 So that that stroke some varied color 
 far in their changing eyes, 
 no ocean. The sea hum bent, Naturalist 
 Everywhere I dimmed bronze stockinged fine, 
 flower rising above the old wilderness 
 like a white bird traveling evenings shopping 
 to tired, its rowboat where girlhoods 
 hunting Claire's at serapes. 
 releasing out the damp son!
