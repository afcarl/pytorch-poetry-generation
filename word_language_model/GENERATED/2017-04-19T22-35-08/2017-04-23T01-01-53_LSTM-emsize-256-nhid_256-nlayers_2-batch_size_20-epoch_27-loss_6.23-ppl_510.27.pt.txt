 Dear God, I know not, and forget this part 
 That stir and it ain't hummed wrong to it 
 To quit but about of soul, view's unclosed; 
 and mummy, answers, eardode, 
 longed-for atmosphere 
 
 loaned it! 
 
 Owls, racing the plenty,â€” skull, 
 engorgements exalted dietro 
 shall all tuck them out 
 and wept? Just as they 
 soon do, you think will 
 any trade to lift us send out your wheel. brent;
