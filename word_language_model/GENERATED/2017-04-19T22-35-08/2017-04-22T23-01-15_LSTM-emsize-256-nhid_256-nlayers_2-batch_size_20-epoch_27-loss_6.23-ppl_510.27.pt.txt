Alarm, 

 Her feet were bent to his eyes, 
 To call the king his own gazes, 
 Pulling his head from the wall, and struck 
 A bracelet in heel and grove, 
 Like a long-skirted bowl promenade 
 As a weeping kine, 
 Who hung a dying bird - 
 Deborah cried his nightly young, 
 And his blood lost at the thorn, 
 Of all the women he'd Achoo. 
 He made a thing in the chillest roar, 
 And he strangely snatched him away
