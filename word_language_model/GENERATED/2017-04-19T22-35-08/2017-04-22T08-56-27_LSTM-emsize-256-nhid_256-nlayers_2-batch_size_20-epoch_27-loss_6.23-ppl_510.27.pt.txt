 Crowding them of the light that grew. I kissed 
 My feet to dance with girls smell 
 As from a tree, the bright daybreak. 
 
 I bite doors with the light, 
 One man is dead. 
 His crocus poles meeting, 
 Whose dreamless sleep. 
 
 
 half-lit. in a rose, 
 from that earth, 
 the same afro in men's 
 Gate, will not bend, 
 
 page alone 
 to be seen 
 there under the sound of the head 
 like
