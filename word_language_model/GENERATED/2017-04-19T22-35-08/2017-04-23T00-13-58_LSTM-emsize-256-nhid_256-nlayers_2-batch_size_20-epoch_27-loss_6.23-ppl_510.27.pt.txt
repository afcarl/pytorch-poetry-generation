Pushed 

 To bare up my unlit wheels. 
 
 
 
 I must be very, very like 
 Some seriously of someone else 
 
 To wait and know that far. 
 
 The sun stooped out at the dark 
 And artificial waves in the ninth day: 
 Besides, it comes on walk another day, 
 And leaves the fruit lolls gurney. 
 Being wild and cold and gray. 
 
 And yet the heart climbs forward into stones 
 And when a particular Gospel rubs
