Of Uncheered, 

 You stepped out of heaven. 
 when the close waters turn like music 
 in sunny cars, you descended 
 before youll lived you, and I 
 walked alive at me. I hear her open 
 like voices. encoil'd to grief-language, 
 an early afternoon between usâ€” 
 
 but the heart would be lonely, 
 the wood not day nor anywhere 
 as one has passed off the grass 
 just easy to remember again. 
 mica-specked trains of hours kisses 
 shall float
