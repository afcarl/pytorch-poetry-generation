A Marriage 

 
 of eelgrass. A blue moss. No reason 
 that it were a test: full 
 something there is 
 no okay? 
 
 The Bash's step from the pale. 
 The starlings laugh in the mud 
 like outdistanced swept by cooling, 
 beyond the sun-flooded variations of the sea. 
 
 A squirrel tail fluttered high, 
 rubbed filament, blue sky 
 now and halfway it out, 
 
 a goofy tautness; 
 a potato or a plan 
 brother and two.
