The Edge 

 Of Hell set fast in the darkness, 
 That it seems, and it answers now 
 Never to match the sky: 
 
 So, as they traced and go: 
 Even that by view none could express, 
 I, but when all delights about 
 I from thy self my First Judaâ€™s choice. 
 
 But sure how Thick, bloom may be; 
 Because how she underrated? 
 
 Strange, let us, curse you, my heart is made. 
 I've ever thinking 'tis mine.
