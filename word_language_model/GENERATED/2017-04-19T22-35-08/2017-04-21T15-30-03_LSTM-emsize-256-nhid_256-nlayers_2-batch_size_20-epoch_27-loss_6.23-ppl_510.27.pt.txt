When I Smoke One Scratch And--Lo!--Infinity 

 Though he never had 
 God's business through the buttery wrist, 
 Never early thinking. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 asea 
 
 
 Free the dog dressed in the night 
 Like the Egoist suffocating 
 While down the coast Expunge 
 Reflecting noblest tints on bleat 
 Wearing less a factory 
 Through dying receiving land 
 In the Berkshire weather below. 
 
 Thatâ€™s all the day at noon-- 
 This University of fretful world,
