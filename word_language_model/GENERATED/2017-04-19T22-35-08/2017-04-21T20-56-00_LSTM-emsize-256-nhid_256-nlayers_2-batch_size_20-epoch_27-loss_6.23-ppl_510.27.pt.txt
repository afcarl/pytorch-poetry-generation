One-Night 

 In maelstroms of the past, 
 Of sleep I live, 
 I comprehend some strange terror of gas 
 And swimming ones and tepees, 
 And remember me the objects a century born 
 
 Could some such name to make other parts trenches 
 mocke always on the surface in a street, a 
 bark. And as through the stupid air 
 Toil tracks stains like a single watch fall into 
 any car 
 No time else then, and no longer southern cries
