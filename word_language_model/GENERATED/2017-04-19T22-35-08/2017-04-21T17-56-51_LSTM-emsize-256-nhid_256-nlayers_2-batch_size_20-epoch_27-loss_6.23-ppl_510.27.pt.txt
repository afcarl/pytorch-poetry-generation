The Cemetery 

 With caressing force, sad sister, 
 And bitter stuff 
 Resounded, 
 
 
 
 If the ruptured day would be the stars, 
 We used done Death with Czechoslovakia-- 
 Some knew maybe so far 
 it's ruffles â€” like a long-legged card 
 religiously, brushing and filling. 
 
 Then smiling, turning to the stillness 
 you will not have parted into it. 
 We raise it -- with all the dots 
 with the reeds, turning coffins of rags 
 and descends
