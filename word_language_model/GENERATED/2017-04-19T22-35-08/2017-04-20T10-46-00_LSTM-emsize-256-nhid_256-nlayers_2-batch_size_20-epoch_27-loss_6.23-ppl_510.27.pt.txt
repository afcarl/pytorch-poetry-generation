Keep, 

 With quiet eyes and wax. 
 And think we think that's baffled, 
 Not made, a yours is in you, 
 A land so seemingly has bootless 
 In a thousand years you think 
 As well as a music ere you wake. 
 It's your wide arms and my cut seat 
 blasting on stable narrows through 
 You're cracked by invisible ones 
 As you assist themselves consumed it, 
 Shy Hill. The households 
 Of the arms that make whole 
 Open you
