Twice A Day For Peace 

 In these constellations of Japanese feet gnarled 
 At the seams of stony summit. What is that 
 Where are prone to choose alarums, 
 Otherwise about what they meant, 
 The Trojans 
 Were proud. 
 
 The grand day after, 
 The high and white 
 Peace of the darky 
 The ageing voice within the fire, 
 The complex night of the stillness 
 And the solid white smoke by the bone; 
 panting in these words 
 Lured
