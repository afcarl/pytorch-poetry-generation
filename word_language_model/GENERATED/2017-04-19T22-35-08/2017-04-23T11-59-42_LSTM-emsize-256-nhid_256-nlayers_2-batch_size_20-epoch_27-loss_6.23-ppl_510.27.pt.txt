It Into Cold 

 
 Ah, yearning for the news there is plenty 
 And death is more a thing than weldy daisy-chain, 
 widows, willowy and Scabies, impoverished novel, 
 frozenness and flame. We would think 
 
 We might have turned the hat which then must 
 come to him? What is it to do but tree-roots 
 
 'Tis known, that what the years out of years 
 Inside the heart fell aloft and drift, 
 Or is a match to untun'd love, 
 But
