Curb. 

 
 I saw half lonely, mine; 
 My dark heart cries, 
 extends, the bed of light 
 And the seasons were at home. 
 
 It was indeed my trainâ€”the too, 
 My heart was changed, my love is all the world, 
 The weak and busy need! 
 And I loved that it was harder 
 Than that I could not understand. 
 
 I never told them if I knew 
 The trees were everywhere, 
 
 But what had driven light
