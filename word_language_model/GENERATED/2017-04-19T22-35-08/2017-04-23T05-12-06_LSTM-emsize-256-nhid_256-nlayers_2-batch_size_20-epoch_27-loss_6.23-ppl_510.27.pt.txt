 
 wrist-numbing whirl as a dying star 
 Shone in the shade boughs gleaming under west, 
 The gnarled winged wave of bramble syrup 
 And the Spring, the rose, the stir of corn, 
 The oncoming and what I saw in plain braid room, 
 The lone Sark deep in the quietness turns 
 Where the frog waiting for the hill. 
 
 Riding the tall yearning, the humble Warsaw, 
 Gave me a life for being all! 
 
 Stan stands there on his forehead
