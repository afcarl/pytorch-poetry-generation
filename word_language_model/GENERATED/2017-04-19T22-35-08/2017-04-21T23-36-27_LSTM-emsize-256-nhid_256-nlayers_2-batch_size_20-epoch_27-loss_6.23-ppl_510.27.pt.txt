 Sit there when children made in eaves, 
 And birds steps creeping slowly 
 In horn-hard soft ruins, slabs 
 crossgrass. quatrain there in its never-lasting branching hail, 
 Language, across the Four hills distinct by eyepools, face, 
 With the waiting beautiful clean spot of idle notes, 
 Twenty years when, out of little stars, 
 For the passions came from below. 
 Nothing like water is exactly the ash within it. 
 
 Sometimes a twig was mixed with a sword, 
 Greenieâ€”blew the fluted
