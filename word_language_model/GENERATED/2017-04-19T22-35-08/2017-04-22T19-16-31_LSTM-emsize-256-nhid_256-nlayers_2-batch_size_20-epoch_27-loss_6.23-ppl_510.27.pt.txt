 And sends out its lip and crying! 
 
 
 
 Now I cross brightened, 
 Along the plain 
 In thick pods of wonder 
 Wherever twenty ruffles 
 Could you or want 
 Of corage marks 
 Its chest-bones cloudcover) 
 Mute heavy, selfa blood, 
 Rulers marches into the street ... 
 
 That one May ever cursed or day, 
 funders, past, savage with life; 
 
 For someone who grow; 
 There's some honey down on the wall, 
 But in sure
