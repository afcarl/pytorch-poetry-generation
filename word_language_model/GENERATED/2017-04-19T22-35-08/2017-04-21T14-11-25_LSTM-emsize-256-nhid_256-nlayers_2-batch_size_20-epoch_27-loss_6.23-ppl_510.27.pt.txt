I Am A Metaphor To Us 

 clerics of mee and mortal answers waltz, 
 God's nature to learn frankness 
 So I strut our letters not to the ground. 
 
 Or thousands of thick remarks by day the rutted twinkling 
 Works of larks from the earth, 
 & Barrel one street a show when rocks began to rest 
 grog after life back into the cool picture, 
 and wish to heart it, eat on the face for unsucked--unless-- 
 him--it Pontic above.
