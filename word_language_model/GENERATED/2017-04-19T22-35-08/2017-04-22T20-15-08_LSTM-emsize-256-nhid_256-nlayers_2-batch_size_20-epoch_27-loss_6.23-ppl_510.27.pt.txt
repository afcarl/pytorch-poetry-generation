 
 Still tonight he is near? 
 He will really be clearer on a score. 
 He is best-kept and cram'd in his pillow, 
 He stares a long way of gray, 
 
 Even though in the spring-time there 
 He sees of a Congress in his attending. 
 No wonder as the sword slack. 
 How does it know the truth of his own, 
 How easily the wind shuts out, 
 Shepherd and prey and peace, 
 And the layers of its courtly knife
