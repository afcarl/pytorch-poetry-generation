Was It That Ileum. 

 The spirit your wires through the leaves, 
 My sullen baseball? 
 shimmer and expand to kiss joie-de-vivre 
 The flesh, the great amor 
 
 And drowsy leaves they call me 
 A streaming crack and wave you down with two. 
 You are a man, 
 All you cannot see is from 
 
 Much of anything you do 
 right, save what you miss 
 Like the dark 
 My life is alive 
 The place remain on another.
