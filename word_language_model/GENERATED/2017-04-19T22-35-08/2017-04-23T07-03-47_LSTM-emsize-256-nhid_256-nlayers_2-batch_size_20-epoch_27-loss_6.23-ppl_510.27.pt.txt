At The End Of The Tabard 

 the year round the Pains frame. 
 The clennesse; light with a hard balanced strand 
 log, the campers blind ham troop-train 
 
 as the mourners promised, & their mauve 
 
 oblivious shrapnel from couplets nights. 
 
 At transit I watch his bed, Naomi blossoms. 
 
 I play a loud wing, pulling the cigarette spread 
 to a hot-rod politeness as he makes life Paris, 
 with his sermon at his hands.
