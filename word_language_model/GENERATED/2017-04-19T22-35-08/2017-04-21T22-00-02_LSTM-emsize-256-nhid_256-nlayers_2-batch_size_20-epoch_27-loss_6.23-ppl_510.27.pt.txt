 Not a thought of the bird wold one of his 
 twenty? And the mark is the moving. loyal 
 
 Clipped me into a dream until it comes 
 And singing and luck to harden from heaven 
 A crunch of fear over the watchman of grass 
 From porch to that rain is raining, & I can turn 
 The windy night on its way smaller, inside myself
