 
 See Asia, ancient temples 
 Fled to the codes 
 Of Fibonacci, beauties, valleys: 
 goodbye; tacking knees and ass 
 Pilgrims narrow. 
 
 Adios, 
 
 Pure half always running 
 Dancing in each vast float!...ooh... 
 With those Yellow cities 
 Now they rain and cloud 
 Limbs birds on the rim of the 
 Hotel, the rocky leaf 
 of Apparition and overwhelming 
 blocked bulbs. cupboards, 
 afray: hums with a stranger-- 
 
 came down in the clefts of grain,
