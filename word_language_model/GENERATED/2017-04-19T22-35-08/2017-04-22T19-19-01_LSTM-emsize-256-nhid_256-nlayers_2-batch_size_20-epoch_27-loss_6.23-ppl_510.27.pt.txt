Pale, Hymning 

 
 Not strangers as it came straight 
 pinball and stops all 
 And long most downcast 
 Head never in the air 
 Announced to the future and B 
 Now, forehead- in fact, a way 
 Through the islands larger, 
 Where others had come devour'd 
 A bridge with each left hand. 
 
 When I have waited, but I seem to Truman 
 My time grant moving, and all I have. 
 Oh, a few people can't.
