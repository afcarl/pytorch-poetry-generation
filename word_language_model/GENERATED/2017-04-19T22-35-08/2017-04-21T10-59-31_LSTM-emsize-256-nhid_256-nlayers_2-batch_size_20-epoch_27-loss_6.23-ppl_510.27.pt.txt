A Part 

 Of a vision in witness, 
 Lies even the dog could be Cyclades 
 From the still knot the One hiss in the trees, 
 Looking up with a lane of pause it sounded about our bone, 
 No sooner up to you about identical women 
 Than of us that only broken, jeux 
 Earth and trouble, there is a spell, 
 Unable to die, planet-sequined or eludes 
 our glasses like a other love-- 
 
 Underneath the sun like a cloud set
