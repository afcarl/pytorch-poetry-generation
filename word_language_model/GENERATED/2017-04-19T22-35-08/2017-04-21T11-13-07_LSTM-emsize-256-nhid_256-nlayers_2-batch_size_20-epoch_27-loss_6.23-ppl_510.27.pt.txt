 Our minds are loosed on the sands like? 
 Man's only love, like your own body, of rocky summers 
 Come to the crucifixion tree be time; 
 Your hands run not far away, the rest of your mirth. 
 I permit you again to, save why you fool thee; 
 But do you know, cry upon your dusty breast; 
 And your very dream of my beauty is good to you. 
 
 
 
 What the humors of an old man lives in him?
