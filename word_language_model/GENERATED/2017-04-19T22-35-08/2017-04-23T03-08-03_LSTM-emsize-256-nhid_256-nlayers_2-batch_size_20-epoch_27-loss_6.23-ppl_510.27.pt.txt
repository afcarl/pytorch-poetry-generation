 
 
 
 In the Holy Desert silence, 
 Worse than the shark enchanted, 
 a quartet of an elegant side: 
 than the one yet hung dry sticks 
 before his nipple 
 
 Put the glass, pence in New York 
 
 under the bed of Xian leaves, 
 glaciers, burning his eyes in breezes 
 to none else, growing in: 
 the conviction supports the fish, 
 
 the man magnifying a bottle among 
 the phonograph bright and frayed 
 trackless flour, even
