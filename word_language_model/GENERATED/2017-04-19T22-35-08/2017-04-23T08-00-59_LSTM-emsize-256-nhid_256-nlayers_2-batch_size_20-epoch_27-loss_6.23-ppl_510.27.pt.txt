 Blind, right yourself. 
 
 Suppose you like what you mean? 
 What I imagine when you were going. 
 
 I was an old man 
 in my head, though I love me, 
 To love my visit, I blank 
 And know that it was a puckered tale 
 Of life, and thinking of my sins 
 Where I turnd, "A livelong heavy-booted term 
 A er not a kindness to refer to 
 This morning that he had my hour."
