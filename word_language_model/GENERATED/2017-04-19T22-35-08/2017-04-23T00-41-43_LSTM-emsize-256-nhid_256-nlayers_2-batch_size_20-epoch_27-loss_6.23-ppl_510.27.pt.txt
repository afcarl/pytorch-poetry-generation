Find 

 A mother in the sycamore! 
 
 The sleep of the morning unsung 
 Is that what loves become of solace 
 Is a glimmer of the sea, 
 Though the heart wave no day from the boats. 
 What is it there: and what is 
 That candle without human wives, 
 What we wear the earth is soaking 
 So with one. 
 
 Yet, tonight the clouds is up, 
 And the well-known down-turn of the heaven, 
 As finding nothing, and all
