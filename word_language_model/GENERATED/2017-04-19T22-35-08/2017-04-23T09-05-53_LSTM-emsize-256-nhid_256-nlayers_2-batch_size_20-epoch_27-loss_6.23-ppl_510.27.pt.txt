The Wheeling, Word, 

 
 nearly hearing the hooves are 
 
 orchard. 
 
 And after every night is as very birds. 
 The same flower is her face islanded in air, 
 a young woman tied to one side of his reach, 
 and standing on her scapes of food 
 
 between the pills and the ivory cuts 
 each knolls. it is pushy, quarterlies or lady, 
 but her child cries off her dear shoe, 
 unrotted, sa because, girl laugh down . .
