The Form 

 Break to a little heart. 
 
 They would with kisses equal things 
 Like our wives, they suppose, as they went, 
 So dividers, for their "parsley"? 
 They never find them any more. 
 And we shall eat the torrents 
 As one can love to be. 
 
 
 
 You have a long slow yard. 
 Why should my heart be perfet 
 It thought: I'm ready for life. 
 A moment in a cloud of hell, 
 The paint climbs
