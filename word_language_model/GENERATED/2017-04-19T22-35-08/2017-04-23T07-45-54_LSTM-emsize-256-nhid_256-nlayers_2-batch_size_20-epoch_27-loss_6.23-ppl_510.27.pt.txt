The Clubbed Tiny Chords Is Not Come. 

 The hair snaps, let it have been, 
 I hurt him with the old cadence, 
 And the scrawled silence, 
 And the river's feet propped over 
 The rooms like fluttering pashas. 
 And the rustling of his round jaw 
 Kindled in the moonlight, 
 And, thicker at the call. 
 
 The parent, Girls are ours, 
 And the cauldron spun their ears. 
 But Death never hot more pears and Setting 
 Their eyes are broken,
