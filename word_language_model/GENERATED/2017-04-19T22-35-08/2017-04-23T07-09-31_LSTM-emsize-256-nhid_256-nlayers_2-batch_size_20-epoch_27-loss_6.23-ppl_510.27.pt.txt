 
 You were digging Credo 
 a statue of Red linen 
 and onto a lawn 
 in the middle of that road. 
 The wound wave 
 and journeyed dumb for the first 
 bastard and odd death 
 so placid in the belly 
 of a billion bell. 
 
 The flowers inside us. 
 flick: Peter, 
 even all things are at last, 
 joined by feelings, 
 nothing is broken and 
 in the other. 
 On the wide dark of the shore
