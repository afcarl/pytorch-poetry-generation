 
 There is little charity, 
 The purple is the voyage; 
 While the crying oil-scummed with 
 
 And the easy blaze she did 
 Pass then is Blackbacks 
 You are bored with what 
 I never feel alone, 
 
 Does finger neither that for death 
 Nor feel your distant anger in small woman's 
 Untouched 
 But hast'n, call your quaint value, with your 
 child's name as the maze, the objects 
 Contrarious sounds let us take our doses 
 And
