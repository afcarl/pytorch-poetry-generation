Other Nights. 

 
 The sky keeps clear and cold, 
 We shall walk over the air 
 As our weight of our burthen fall. 
 As though a thousand boughs are now closed 
 By the mythology of light we might know 
 Set a home to the potted wildest actorsâ€™ 
 macadam; nor even two clean cries 
 Does retrieved. 
 
 Did you wait an waves' king from me? 
 Then, one autumn, older stored-up 
 Sat a flap of Londoun leaf 
 Sometimes lunary
