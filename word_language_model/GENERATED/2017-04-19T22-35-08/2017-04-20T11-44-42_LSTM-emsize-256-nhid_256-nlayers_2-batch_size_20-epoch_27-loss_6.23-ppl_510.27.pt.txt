Night!" 

 That only a chill dog wakes my face, 
 And thus at last the news, will woo me, 
 With an ear in which all this there might 
 To live that chest. Therefore no stone. 
 
 I am all dead and innocent and good, 
 And through my music, I swear 
 I mean out on whereof, when I was wise; 
 
 To all those which were done or stood a cab 
 Down from Prosody or stains gnash'd 
 In that part
