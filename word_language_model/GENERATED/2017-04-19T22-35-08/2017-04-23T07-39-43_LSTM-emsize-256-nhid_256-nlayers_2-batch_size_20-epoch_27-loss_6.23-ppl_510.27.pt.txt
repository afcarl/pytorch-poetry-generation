This Shift, 

 A choice no match when a wind rolled away 
 The whirls of a body blood, a spirit, 
 a body crossed, maybe buried 
 For a poem," not like this the abyss 
 Or at best understood 
 It was there, nature blows 
 The world is a field of garment . . . . 
 
 And as my letters looking out of that man. 
 When the electric moon blows up their wheel 
 And owned, learn their bones to grandmother
