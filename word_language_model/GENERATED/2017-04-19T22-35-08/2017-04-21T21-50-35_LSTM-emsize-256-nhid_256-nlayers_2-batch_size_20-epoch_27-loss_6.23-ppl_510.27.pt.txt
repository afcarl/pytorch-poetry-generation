Wait 

 Around and over, and the poorest 
 
 combat disaffection's among 
 couer lines and studs 
 pit, they didn’t spelling squeak spy, 
 Today and only because they think we are. 
 
 Everything's always right, 
 some days before it’s been here. 
 
 We heard it arouse 
 the Deuces glances 
 keyboards to face locked inward 
 wound? Really 
 little Glazed foot acknowledgments, 
 like Bobby, steady popcorn, 
 and the north throats of cars 
 shout like jokes in blunts
