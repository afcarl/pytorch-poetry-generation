And Land Be Sugarplum. 

 Long is never the same sensation 
 Of our ignorant forms, and went with this mother, 
 To one another's peace like behind us, 
 So only then we pay something to die. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Eden to an Mountains 
 
 
 Whom the sweat of a good generation lies, 
 Soft waters like a new-born queen, 
 Like trees in garments drawer. 
 
 glassed-in boy, cannot be the grot of eyelid's defence 
 In every vale
