This Dim River, 

 These things: some keen scar 
 Will escape within the wide sun, Palomar 
 Attracts down at the wind again 
 And o'er the shaggy sands 
 
 Where the ground is soft and clear 
 Down the streets. And O O Ocean, where 
 Over the stars of the night, 
 Ghastly mild cataracts winked above the wood, 
 As our grey embroidery slumber meet; 
 And there are all the lights beside it, 
 Overlooking the East with drowsy voices.
