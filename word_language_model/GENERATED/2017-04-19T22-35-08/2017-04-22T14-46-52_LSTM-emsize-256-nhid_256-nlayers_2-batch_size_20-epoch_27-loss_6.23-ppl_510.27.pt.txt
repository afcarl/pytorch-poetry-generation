 My lack of death, my Heav'nly lids are past, 
 But my thoughts will not fail for terror, would not be long; 
 For I am everywhere. 
 Oh, sure have I. 
 
 Come, glistring Considerest thou 645, Proserpine, 
 For whose sake thee: myself when my ship descends 
 With Birds that quench my nights as I gasp 
 Thy gift is friend most near. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Quiet fencepost, 
 
 
 Divided nature's Guest thou might have find
