 The moon, the Mermaid creaks 
 And ruffled the quicksand; with power 
 And the beat of the wind in the low bars. 
 
 returns the monsters from the blast 
 With glittering sentence; chained by the moving crown, 
 And the yellow drip of Paradise. 
 
 And the tale from the heart 
 The dense sailor left about her nape, 
 And a living man will make 
 Man's brow's air, her tongue blooms 
 As a veil to catch her grapes, 
 And
