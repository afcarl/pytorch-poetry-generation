The Price 

 Of sun and moon heaving the smell 
 Of time so hard, 
 The remains of life. 
 He too has scores 
 Where it withers but glee 
 By frightening aerial paths, 
 And he mixed a thing with his hand 
 A violent woman thoughts, 
 From that dancing yellow deer 
 That survived the green earth fire-red; 
 Strangers like a vesture fuse from the glass; 
 The procession are armed by the wall 
 And the tears are terrible, the trains
