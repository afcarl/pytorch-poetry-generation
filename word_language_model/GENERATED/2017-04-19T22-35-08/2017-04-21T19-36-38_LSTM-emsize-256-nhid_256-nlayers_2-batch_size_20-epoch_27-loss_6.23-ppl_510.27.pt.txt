 
 The longing for eye it is the light 
 That has an opossum correct the color of night 
 happy. 
 That's all some of the busy town, 
 And praise a hasty weather among the sea. 
 
 February is over and I am of wine and hereafter, 
 Bechtel, are also the ceremony of heaven, 
 Like to have announce bodies, why be not wholly maiden, 
 Or few in hand, sand everywhere, under- 
 pucker with dirt between us as Jove is,
