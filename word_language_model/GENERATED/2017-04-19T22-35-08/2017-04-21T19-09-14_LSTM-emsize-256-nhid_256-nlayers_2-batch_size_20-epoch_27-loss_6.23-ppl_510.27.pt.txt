 We with the gossamer skin 
 of starving felled accelerating in shtick, 
 it was our victim, and by 
 the sound of a eye, rushing 
 
 to detours light across aside, 
 melting cool with sunlight, 
 one tail entangled on the shaft 
 as if her word retain, 
 the next was it, according to self-portrait; 
 
 a fear, will soon missed 
 that foot sol- 
 with stars, and onto the knees 
 we threw her on Stanley's wing 
 and pass
