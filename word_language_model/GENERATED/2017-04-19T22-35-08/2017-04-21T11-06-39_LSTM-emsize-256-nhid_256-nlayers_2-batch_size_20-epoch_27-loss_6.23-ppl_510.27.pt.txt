Of Silence Nearly Clear, 

 Stays heard and hour, find the children kickin' 
 But ere they danced into in their common occasions 
 Of promotion to the afternoon; the wet gold 
 Printed by their feet. 
 
 The youth and the woman came back, they use at, 
 The book, tears strapped to them goes down on a farm stain 
 With burned archaic torches. Juba little Ourselves 
 Goes to the homeless graveyard pillar; 
 Someone do not know.
