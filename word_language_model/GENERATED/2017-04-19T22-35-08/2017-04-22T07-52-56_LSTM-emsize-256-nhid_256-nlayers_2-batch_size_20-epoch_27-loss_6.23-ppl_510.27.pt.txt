Lips, Watching Us Breathe Their Way; 

 This is the sun, though there is any such rivers of such weeds. 
 But here you sing lest you on bowline bazaar which we have been waiting for 
 To be broken, 
 Makes we give them forth. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Saint Nine, Need 
 
 
 Now women say the snow could bring 
 The wild deer neatly circling, 
 Or the mail, or the Cedar legend river. 
 Their dim green picnic is enough.
