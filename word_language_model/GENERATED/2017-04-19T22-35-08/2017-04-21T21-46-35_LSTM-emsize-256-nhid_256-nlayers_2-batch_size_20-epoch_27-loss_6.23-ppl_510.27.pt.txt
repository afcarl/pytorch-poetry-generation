Of Seeding 

 Till all afternoon in the hour and night. 
 In the fields now it bowed and fell 
 Each huge island, pointing to the beach 
 The glory of his jaw, the standard of fleece 
 Of dry grass swings and aloof, his panels 
 shows the eyes of cave forever dumped 
 By the hills until her smile was ice--how 
 Rock to her gasping bed around 
 Beloved makeup, and her averted one, 
 She tires to the rest of a thousand tombs,
