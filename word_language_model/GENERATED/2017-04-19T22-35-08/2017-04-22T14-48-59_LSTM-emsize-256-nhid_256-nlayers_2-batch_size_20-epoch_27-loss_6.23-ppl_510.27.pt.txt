 Hard away in tall southern days abroad 
 I see them Presseth under sprinkle slow. 
 And I dream of me a cigarette, daredevil 
 Jesus impossibleâ€”feelings like sleep, 
 Spring disappear...I'm flits above me few were a practical 
 spirit! quicksilver trapped upon me, 
 black love thighs, then quarter roads 
 
 and dazed to one small scene hoisting 
 long-stemmed night's fenders from the staying: 
 decades like miracle, early 
 Om Someday you have babies 
 become so as we'd listen
