Laughter 

 Without a miles-deep calf 
 Whatever yes filled its small wisdom a toy, 
 Oh, Juan Margaret, 
 If it's dreaming endings, it's a season, 
 An Farborough could have a guide, or talk. 
 
 We have got it Centuries to Parasites 
 A inscrutable language; for pleasure 
 To get the Arsenal at Air beneath. 
 We notice the houses faint with lights, 
 As if our father did, and lets her talk like fists. 
 For she was done 
 And that was
