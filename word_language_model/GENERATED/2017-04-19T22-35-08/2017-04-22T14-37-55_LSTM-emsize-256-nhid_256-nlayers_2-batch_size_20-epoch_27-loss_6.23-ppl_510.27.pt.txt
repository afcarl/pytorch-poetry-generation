 The card to what we laugh? 
 It might do again. Cut it off in walnut

 Not a trick; weren't it history jujungawop 
 And we would not quite stand up that we know it, 
 It is wiser than her daughter can shine. 
 We have to lean on a young piano 
 Running at you, my Baron wonâ€™t cast buckets 
 As an African clerk sunk in a oregano.
