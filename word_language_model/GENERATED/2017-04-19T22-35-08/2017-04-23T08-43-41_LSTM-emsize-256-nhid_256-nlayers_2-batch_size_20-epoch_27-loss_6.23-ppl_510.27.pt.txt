 
 And keep the gentleness and crying, Repulst, 
 But they are bowed mantling lanes 
 
 In the cluster of blackbirds 
 millstoneâ€” where nothing has been: 
 Not, is taking off the east 
 As ["Come consonant. But just the long 
 Forces itself and the longing 
 
 
 
 
 
 Self-Portrait 
 
 
 Two and we sang cans, and me 
 in ecstasy. 
 You'd eat trees 
 enough to wake 
 a haired travel 
 for outward, for 
 them.
