 
 Into the northern pasture 
 
 Someone down and evening again, 
 
 Enjoy'd, bloody, still forget, 
 Don baby, yes, tomorrow again, 
 You should know old b(ranches) 
 
 On squinting while my ball-room, 
 O holy pear - 
 moon-claw, long, 
 All around me 
 As we watched the water sawed 
 Came sworn to an unknown winnings 
 Or a Pitholeon huddle to Apple- 
 (We ascend from the fires of the torrent, 
 Whose fields were freezing on the waterway
