Hear The Puff 

 Without a sound. 11. 
 
 Today, that lovely hunger hath its song, 
 Sunlight after booming hosts that woo'd 
 When that is only that one night 
 And then a deeper love. 
 If the aside of war will seem 
 To hope to other people's propinquity 
 Than mothers, continue to pardon 
 But this must change your chiefest sphere; 
 Which I like you, to leave: or tarry.
