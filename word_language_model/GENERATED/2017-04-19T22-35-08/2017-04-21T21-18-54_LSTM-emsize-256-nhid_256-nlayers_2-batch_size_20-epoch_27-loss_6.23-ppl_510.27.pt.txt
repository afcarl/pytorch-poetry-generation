 All from looking at its proper sensuality 
 humility; 
 Pequita must sporting out its own. 
 
 Gather ye uncrossable Life, and your highways 
 Delaying too far, these airy court.

 Thee for swallowtail. this being here. 
 I am thy desire for the dark suns 
 That over thy might save them all to death, 
 Full smear which You need, and just gave down.
