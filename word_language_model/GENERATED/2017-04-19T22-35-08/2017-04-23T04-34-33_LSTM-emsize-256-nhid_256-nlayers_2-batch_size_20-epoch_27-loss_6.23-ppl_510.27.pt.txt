 Susie Henry Amadis, 
 Heureux 1966 grassland, calls 
 fistfuls of oil 
 Found in my stalactites, tincans, 
 fire-flames bushes. 
 Humbly Jew, 
 nails? . . . 
 giraffe—that’s tramp, ceasing 
 even after I was closed. 
 
 
 
 snow-on-the-mountain, 1024. 
 
 When all the white nights are opened, 
 You are the summer trees with the rills, 
 And the tinkling bells leap to the Moon. 
 
 Light it clears my wrinkled eyes, the blow
