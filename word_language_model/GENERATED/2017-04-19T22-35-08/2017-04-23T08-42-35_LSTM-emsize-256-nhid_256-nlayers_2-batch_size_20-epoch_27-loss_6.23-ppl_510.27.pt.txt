So Calm 

 
 Washed by sabre by the sugar 
 Easily on my chest like an nipple of scrutiny. 
 
 And those those long years to them, 
 Christmases, villages with ground coffin first. 
 Middle-Aged my machine on to the face I longed it; 
 I brimmed the floor, safe and flicker 
 And see that on the balcony of the sea 
 That all commenced was used over them. 
 
 I'm going down to sleep 
 Your gasp, my body, and emerged
