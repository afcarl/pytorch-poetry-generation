Of The Sins Of Things, 

 Or as still the dark string spoke down. 
 But flowering one are his discarded trips 
 To the shuttering in his ear, the three 
 Lions will on his weeds as thick as pilgrims 
 Look at him. But he said shining at his command. 
 This time no Death can travel in his sleep. 
 Taking a bottle to all the wilderness 
 That lives in the mortal mid heat and blows. 
 So gazed Frangipani the great volcanos
