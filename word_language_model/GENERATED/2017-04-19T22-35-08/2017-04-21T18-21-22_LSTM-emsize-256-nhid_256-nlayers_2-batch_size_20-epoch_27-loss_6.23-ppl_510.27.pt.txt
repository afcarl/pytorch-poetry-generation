 
 Till a bird throbs down 
 Where the elusive Bow 
 Enfolding and Tranquility. drove the sun. 
 No sea of war, no ship clicked upward 
 cleared it so that gleams, 
 The heart of alarm rose 
 Over the son--modern banks, 
 For the sea was quiet, 
 After all, crossing the bare sky 
 This afternoon, or no madness, 
 Summer day later undrest 
 So round the strong hurricane stirs! 
 Still then, we slave-built trailing 
 The letters on the plain
