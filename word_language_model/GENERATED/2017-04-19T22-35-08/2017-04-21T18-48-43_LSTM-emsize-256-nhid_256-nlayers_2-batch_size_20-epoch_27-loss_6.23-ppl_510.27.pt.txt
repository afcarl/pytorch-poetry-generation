Not One Of The Others 

 Are born, the peculiar trails 
 All their lives live safe. 
 
 
 
 The dead Corpore 
 Power by smiling the just 
 globe of gold gin 
 the field will not lie close 
 through white for written tides 
 
 Ballroom south, in rain 
 the borders drop, seals 
 
 maidenly and lopped 
 
 Art's fire howls 
 with rolls of Venus 
 
 It are beautiful. 
 Later, that can't 
 trace lightnings 
 under
