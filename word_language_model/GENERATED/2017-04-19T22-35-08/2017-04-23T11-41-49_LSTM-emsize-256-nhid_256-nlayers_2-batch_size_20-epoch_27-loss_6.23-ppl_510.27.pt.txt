 
 That sends me from this letter 
 Beside the packet out, 
 of glossy ground and April 
 Be hard to fix its path 
 To some thirty rivers, 
 Turns dancing on it and sniff 
 A dog on a table 
 Impatient to my own brow: 
 But right this life is ill. 
 
 I hear my baby, towering weed 
 Moving from these words-- 
 But if the livelong time 
 Perhaps sadness had been end! 
 I had smelled toehold
