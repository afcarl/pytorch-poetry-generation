Us, As Though The Frost 

 Was under the influence like a lover's ball, 
 While, as water follows roofs and swamps 
 And went into his own grave, 
 The man and groom laughed silent, winds; 
 And (they forgot the saintly retouch." 
 This hour he had a secret land 
 To pick them into the air. 
 I ate my Keepsakes with its hues. 
 
 purge on in the parks and mountains I ran and bray, 
 And I can hear great accursed talk
