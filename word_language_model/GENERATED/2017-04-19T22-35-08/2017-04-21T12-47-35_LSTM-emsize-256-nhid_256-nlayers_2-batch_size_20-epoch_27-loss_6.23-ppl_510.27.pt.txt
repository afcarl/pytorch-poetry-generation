Out Anyway. 

 We might fight with our kiss as you 
 swaying the point of a clumsy mantle, 
 and very so kindly we must rise, 
 
 insufferable. enough 
 as through an absence 
 of false-dawn light, bright, 
 from a stone link you'll find 
 to resemble the dancing streaks--the 
 
 stounde, voice, you say, you should be I'm hut and clean. 
 
 No doubt 
 no mail takes 
 deceived 
 
 from the altar they take fast 
 gentle faces,
