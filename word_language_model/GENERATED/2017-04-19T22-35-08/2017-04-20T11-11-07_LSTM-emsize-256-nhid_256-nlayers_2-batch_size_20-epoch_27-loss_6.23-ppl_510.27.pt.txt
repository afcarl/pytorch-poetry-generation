Sky By The Mists 

 And through the trees above history 
 Received the dawn to sleep through the East, 
 As shines the color of skeletons, 
 
 Out of the alders, the bookshelves are; 
 But at all roads has come, and not of love. 
 All sorts of body, lined with eld—Asia’s, opposing 
 All through time's little warmth, and waves that hold 
 Out of the playful dream that voice upon the field, 
 Are like a Distance all over a conveyor dome
