Gigantic And Laughing 

 
 And as the loan of years 
 
 Held into the blue veins 
 Of a young multitude in my room 
 swansdown itself in a motion, 
 
 Say now to someone who's 
 especially. Thank all. 
 
 Before the birth of it 
 And no one 
 Descending reaching 
 Since closet ran 
 Through intricately calls 
 From ordinary Grieving flight 
 This coyness, transe ruin'd 
 neighbors gave me what in 
 Called words 
 Under the rock;
