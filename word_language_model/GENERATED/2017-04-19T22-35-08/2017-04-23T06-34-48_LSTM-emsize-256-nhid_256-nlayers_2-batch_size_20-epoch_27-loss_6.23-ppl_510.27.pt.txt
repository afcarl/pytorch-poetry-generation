Mute Voices, The Bonfire Half Conceived 

 duct sweating, waiting in the sight, 
 ('Twas day, your smile of heart road gloats 
 Stripped of hands, Fallen fast open, 
 and on the surface of the street 
 â€” similes: lined up against the wind. 
 tobrecan old old jerks bitterly to blue 
 mountains of water, liquor under water, a slice. 
 I called autumn on my lap just like roads 
 you set down reeds, tal raw hesitation 
 and melanoma-blurring trucks at any time.
