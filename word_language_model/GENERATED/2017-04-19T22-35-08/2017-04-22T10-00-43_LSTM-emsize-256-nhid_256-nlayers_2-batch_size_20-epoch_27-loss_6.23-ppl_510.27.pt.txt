The Cellar Of Worldly Men -- 

 Every day under the line of the iron decks 
 From eaves to mind, and the silvery silver pensioners releases? 
 "Or the young child the keeper of the tree,

 Of all that name is not to be alone 
 In the far-off motion of the world.

 Through the least of ReadyEddie hours of devoured and grin.
