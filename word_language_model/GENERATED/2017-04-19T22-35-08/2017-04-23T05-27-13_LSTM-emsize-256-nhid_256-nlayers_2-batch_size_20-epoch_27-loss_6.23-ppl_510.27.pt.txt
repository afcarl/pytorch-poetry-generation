To The Open Doors, 

 The courage of the minstrels awake. Then death 
 Imperialism's 
 
 Birth & High-Grade milk, 
 And the wind is overhead, 
 And the long blossom spread out the hot pool smells exploding away 
 My hand again gone, the currents I are uneasy now, 
 I am the ghosts singing there, with cotton-cold restful 
 
 premonitions. 
 
 And how? and despair, 
 Have crept from dreams of his life I endure. 
 I half deaths for your delight
