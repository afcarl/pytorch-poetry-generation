Fix Your Heart. 

 You love me. You could see the grease cramped but bear 
 Your feet to stroke the destination, afternoon--Louis and shoe-- 
 
 And so we caress we wear sadness from the birdhouse. 
 And when plane-handles fired in my pocket, just enough 
 to remember the next person and only one day, 
 
 St.-Beno√Æt-sur-Loire from gaps to room and forever the sky 
 
 Until I relate to escape, her hat under itself since; 
 Although I launch up her shuttered singing
