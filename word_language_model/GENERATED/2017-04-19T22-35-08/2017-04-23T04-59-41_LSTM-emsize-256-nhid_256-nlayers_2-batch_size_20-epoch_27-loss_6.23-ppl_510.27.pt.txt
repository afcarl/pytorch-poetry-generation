In Unknown Court, 

 Tears conductor round their skirts 
 And fields of tomatoes 
 
 Having brought me through 
 To shout at the Bridge of God, 
 And crawled like bird from windows 
 Of blossom wading in gray 
 On the parched water; 
 And as a flame caught 
 In the Sunday afternoon 
 Where the sudden Waugh's 
 For no one to me! 
 
 
 
 Even now a moment 
 I stand and slip from a belly 
 My body as
