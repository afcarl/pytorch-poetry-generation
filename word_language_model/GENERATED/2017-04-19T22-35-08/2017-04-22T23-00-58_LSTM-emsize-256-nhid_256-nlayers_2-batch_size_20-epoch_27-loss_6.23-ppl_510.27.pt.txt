Glasscapped Salesmen Grown Music, 

 And sunlight breaks out theoretically graveyard 
 That beckons until he chose to inscribe it; 
 I wash and I can hear; for every second fly I heard 
 That I may naught with form himself in it. 
 No proved to have it if what is, -- 
 Sure later awhile would fail now. 
 
 No longer life could see, nor could I feel, 
 I do not know where I lie, 
 And how the shades they planted now.
