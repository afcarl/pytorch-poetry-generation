 I heard a machinery of sorrowâ€”sorrow 
 a litigious place, 
 but Broadway 
 brought 
 out of the world 
 from a stolen rare sty. 
 
 It's a way to get 
 for your difference 
 you'd have been before; 
 
 like something to be part 
 of a world 
 
 I can buy 
 a bag I'll death-dumb 
 nothing you do. 
 How it comes. 
 Dedicated to its dead
