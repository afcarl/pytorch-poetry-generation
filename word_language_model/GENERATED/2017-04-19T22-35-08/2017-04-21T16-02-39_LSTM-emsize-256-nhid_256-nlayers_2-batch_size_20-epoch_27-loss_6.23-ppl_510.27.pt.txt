Espaliered, 

 entry. Mother, of love, come drive 
 "With horses from the lash, with cold, 
 And bards tear off the infant halls. 
 Tell me the Love must count for catch 
 
 Something as all canst be a country 
 That tells This is what thou hast lain, 
 That we must suffer or shall be page; 
 We have secretly done the ways of rose-breath 
 That all the fierce irons have known. 
 
 Whereat the county sleeps, the Light of sense.
