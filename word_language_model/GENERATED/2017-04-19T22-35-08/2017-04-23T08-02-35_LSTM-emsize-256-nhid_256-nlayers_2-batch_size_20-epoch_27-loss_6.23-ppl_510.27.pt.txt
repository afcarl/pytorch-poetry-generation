 You came to hold their gli singing 
 One great face of two, instead of reinstall 
 eating the moonlit darkness about John, 
 the only heart to love was kind. 
 Like a clanging clock. 
 And what you had saved, the whole point 
 was nothing more than a party seen nothing 
 exists as it were, it had said I had 
 thought of our own names. No use to fish
