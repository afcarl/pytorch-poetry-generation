Training 

 With a yellow watch; as if the moon had got gang-boss 
 A small boulder shaking jogging in a bucket. 
 
 This was the first now sound blasphemus, perforce 
 And the way its wheels go seaward imagination 
 And distance laugh burning, were sending 
 The fallow: Sprouting pitchforks, in the cloud; 
 Another city, the same even I am . . . . 
 .I know needed the treated, its lungs come and spread 
 gulf-stream of smoke together. Are simply nails,
