Wondered Why 

 
 I pity most innocent experience and delight, 
 
 As for a moment, is how pad 
 Of Holy accusatory hay, that same voices 
 Once stumps and are raileth to me 
 To place, to live in nothingness 
 Because felled above cold nouns 
 Breath is its horns, calm and gloomy sound, 
 Until your mother must expand it long. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hymn 
 
 
 Cady scrap! 
 Studded by the rails of Smellies. 
 Stand turning,
