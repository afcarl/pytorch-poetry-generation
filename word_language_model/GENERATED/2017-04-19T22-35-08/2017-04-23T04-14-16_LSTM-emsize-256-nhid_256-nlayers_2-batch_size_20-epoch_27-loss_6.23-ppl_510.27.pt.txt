Violins 

 
 Made boats leaping, my mother's compeers, 
 In my torpid victims plain 
 Arms open and sleep.

 Since you sit at Life's kitchen tree. 
 It's not the Spring meant Oaths 
 Darkly That's a fern 
 Heark'ning in the bed here,â€”this loss." 
 The Arctic mind on his lips. 
 
 Swoops roll in waters, cover 
 From one long pitch out our grime; 
 pinned wheels in awareness, magazine 
 Settling up with doves and Spanish grates
