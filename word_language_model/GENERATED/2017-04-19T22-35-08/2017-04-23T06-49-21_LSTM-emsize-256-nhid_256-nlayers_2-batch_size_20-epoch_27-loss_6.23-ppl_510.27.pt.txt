Or Opening Grey Hands 

 
 They left of summer morning 
 I said nothing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 New York 
 
 
 Passage to me I call defeat, 
 I cannot say missing evidence 
 If thou e'er beauties John too? 
 But Blessed wast he, (though this 
 I seek for thee, now I should die: 
 Bright and still I shall drag thee adapting 
 Through a deathless towery all 
 When I begin I shall forget 
 My feats of gold
