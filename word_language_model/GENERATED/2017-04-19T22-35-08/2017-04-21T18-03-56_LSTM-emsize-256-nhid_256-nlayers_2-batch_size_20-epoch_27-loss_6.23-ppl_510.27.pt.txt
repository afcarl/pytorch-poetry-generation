A Day When I Love And Ever 

 create, my fingers have loved him in the fire, 
 Cherish for model and knot of nails ... 
 before I rears sight, but I hate that, 
 And now Summer blossom thanked the shore 
 When a bell wavers in its bark 
 You bites a young crab swaying over time's band 
 Against the gates of Wall and sand, and in each other, 
 
 The silken, slit strips of rocks like a horn, and then now,
