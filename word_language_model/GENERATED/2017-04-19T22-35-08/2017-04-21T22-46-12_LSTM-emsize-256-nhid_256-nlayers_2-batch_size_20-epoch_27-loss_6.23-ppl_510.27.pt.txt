Fishbone 

 I were summoned, the brave, 
 But many, at a side, remarried. 
 Free of the boy made way, 
 And were springing towards him. 
 
 I talked for heavy, names, 
 It made me feel with the way, 
 And mass of bits free; 
 Their eyes I caught and on the roof 
 Of its eternity. 
 
 
 
 woodthrush with dark purple fires, 
 From labor. Years shore, one by the ghost 
 That has awakened to us at all:
