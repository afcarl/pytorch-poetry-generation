To Warm It, 

 The mind becomes silver, and the flex of heaven grew 
 O'er gray streets that dreamed of guns and mist, the palms between, 
 And floods out the windows and smells of uniform tongues, 
 Dreaming of the waters, come, (Again the smoke of flame, 
 And rolls together, accidentally drunks and brothers come 
 To wave their hefted passing along the star; the great passage, 
 Dancing and vipers Angels at fourteen bowe 
 Killing stars have transitions, each breath like lilies,
