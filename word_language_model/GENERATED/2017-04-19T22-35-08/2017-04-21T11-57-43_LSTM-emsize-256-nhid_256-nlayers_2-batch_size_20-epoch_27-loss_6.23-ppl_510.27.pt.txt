Soil To Find My Sire To Be Found 

 in the afternoon. She need not be late. I 
 walk with the same big white warmth before The garden 
 might break the grave asleep, 
 and slowly let me swim. 
 At night, and I ran, and would have brushed 
 my lantern and then turn 
 and wipe it under my feet 
 and motor needles and 
 inkling of your tiny blood! 
 I feel the end of 
 the depth I live in
