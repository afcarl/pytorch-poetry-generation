 She watches the reflex of her peaked. 
 The bloom, clear, cheeks, 
 bit a tiptoe in her hand, 
 bright as a tablecloth on our bed.

 Like a man in a bee's street, there 
 in the pores of an idea. 
 Each night a murderer's woman, 
 still putting a card on it, 
 his hand upside up across outside--exhumed, 
 Who stood there â€” 
 naked and couples allowed it 
 if we arrive the night and over,
