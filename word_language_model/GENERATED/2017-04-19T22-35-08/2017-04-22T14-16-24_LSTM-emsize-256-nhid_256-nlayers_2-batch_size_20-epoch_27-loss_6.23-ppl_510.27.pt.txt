Rage; 

 Don't run nor go on doing all alone 
 when i goldsmith but alive 
 
 or gets it to the outspeak 
 and whip around thereout to dress 
 
 
 because the house has a Chinese 
 hamburger with its silver wreath, 
 
 the room's dark tear brass invention 
 
 could handle my wealth not to respond 
 to a girl who cut her hair 
 in the Polish snarled envelope, 
 
 a cry mark to make sense Paycheck
