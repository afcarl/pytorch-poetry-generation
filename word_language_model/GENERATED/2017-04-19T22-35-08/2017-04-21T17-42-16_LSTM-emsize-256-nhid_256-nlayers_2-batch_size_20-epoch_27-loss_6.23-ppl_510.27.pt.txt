 
 Hour the road and Drycleaners 
 thinkin, its dart. 
 O, be our heavens' folds of myriad wine, 
 That Freedom creature; as a fisherman comes 
 Along the teeming mule, and cloud 
 And fold the headland, and the gray darts, 
 Where breathes in the sky among the footsteps shines, 
 And life and whisper draws sublime to the skies, 
 And lays a thousand hundred. 
 
 And low winds cry the task to sing; 
 And while there were no yellow houses.
