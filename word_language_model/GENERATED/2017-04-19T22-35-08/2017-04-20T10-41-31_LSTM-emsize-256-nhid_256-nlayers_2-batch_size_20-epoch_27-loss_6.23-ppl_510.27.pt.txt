 In Guards, children from their delectable 
 solved. 
 
 Oh, wearing light? 
 Our heads are red and aglow. 
 You pause in hallucinations to enter. 
 Remember even this year. While 
 defaming your cedar star. 
 Twice you understand, on 
 the after-image not to please 
 your troubled eyes, into 
 your mouth because Someone 
 would sense in your pocket, 
 and you do not know nothing more 
 I have seen you floating less, 
 no bigger than Thouh less good
