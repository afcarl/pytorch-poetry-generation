 I become the voice, and, lifting 
 On the depth of your left cheek. 
 O! I love you, 
 tubercular under the seam, 
 A thousand screams to meet me, 
 Nothing collected does not capture me: 
 Clear to see in His wrath: 
 This excellent 
 Hints of your house 
 Heaven's Hasten wings 
 all you sit or wash 
 this is a sense of nothing 
 from a blade removed, the souls 
 preserved in wails, pencil-point.
