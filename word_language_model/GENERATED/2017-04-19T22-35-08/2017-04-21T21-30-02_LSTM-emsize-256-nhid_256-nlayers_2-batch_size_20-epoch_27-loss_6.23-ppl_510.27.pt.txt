Remains Twilights In Love 

 With other truth that is to die, 
 
 So there was a blind wolf for life 
 And forever to wake past alone. 
 And exposed be the continent of the waves, 
 The Kid bear it to wait at feud 
 For the long, white link, 
 'Tis a fox, the glacial wind's time--rainbow 
 So lately could the blood of Eden be, 
 That truth--above pain and all hands meteor. 
 
 What would hunt the wine beneath the tree.
