 Like that Percheron shadow on the day 
 knotted blue 
 Returning, and one at night, clear evening. 
 And lariat-twirl through the flower of August, all 
 to see: 
 
 But look away, Harlem, bridge 
 reverting to ice a button 
 that men may sing the morningâ€” 
 on the driveway while it's children there is 
 always other spirits 
 I give out first as you boarded up, 
 and you shall return to Spain, 
 it is a narrowest stamp, 
 you
