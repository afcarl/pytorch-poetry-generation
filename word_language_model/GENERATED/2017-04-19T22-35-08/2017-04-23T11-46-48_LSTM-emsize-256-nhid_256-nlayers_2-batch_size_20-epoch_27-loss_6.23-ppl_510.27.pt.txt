The Earth, 

 While suddenly the dark--Isolt? or the town, 
 And no one laughing quite enough, 
 When the wild swans had run into the sun, 
 He joyously saw with his bright beard southward again. . 
 O unexplained loved by overbear 
 Greenleaf 
 As mad as a bird sinks 
 While hollow guileless splendour falls in a pomegranate. 
 
 And the swallows in the swishing glass, 
 Like a mathematically marching-- 
 Long seas go visit's apples 
 leafy, on dark flakes afire,
