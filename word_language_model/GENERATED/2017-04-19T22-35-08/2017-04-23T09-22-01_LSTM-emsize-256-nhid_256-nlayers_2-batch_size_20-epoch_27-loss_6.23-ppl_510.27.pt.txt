 stagehands: with lupine and winds extended 
 To drink the low city 
 Which has been too bare

 About, in the heavens and moons 
 Overheard mad sleep. 
 
 Where no one is blare â€” the dew Series 
 insanity and Marion revolver. 
 
 tithe to the faith of Ra. -- for 
 The poet 
 is bored from degrees of false juice in regrets, 
 surrounded by all the emotion
