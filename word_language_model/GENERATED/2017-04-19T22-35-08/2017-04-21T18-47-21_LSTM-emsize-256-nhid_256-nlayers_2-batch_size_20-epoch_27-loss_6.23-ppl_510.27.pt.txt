 One day when the other couple a dear 
 hand crawled beers, like a shimmer 
 yard after my throat no less tear 
 on my pilgrimage in my repertory snowy 
 Oldham and hopping over 
 The ground with a face Unsay 
 its hula percussive ermine, alligator smiled 
 on red Boylston Street swung on 
 striped nipples. Everything 
 
 long crooned sometimes a long 
 large backward bucks in routine 
 Roosters, stains, but broken 
 acclamations void of oil 
 dissolving from
