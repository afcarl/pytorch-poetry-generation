 His horse sheds water and dogs, 
 
 The cloudy long-drawn round firefly 
 Winding from the window-sill and amberjack; 
 As he haunted his eyes with fear. 
 
 The gemmy shouts and cross the staring eye, 
 The Agamemnon stood with his meek timepiece 
 flapping in the white speed. 
 
 The Gossamer, the tired babel of corn, 
 Caught the North foundations among 
 The Skylark corn, the Barcan eve; 
 
 The loud old margin, the sounds that rang 
 Hang round
