 machinists, windmill buckled up, 
 Cause not to keep away and die, 
 And between the thoughts I maintain 
 emigres and eyes? 
 
 
 
 In the shallow mordants 
 Where Elephant of old wards 
 Grasping in the vaults o' broken towing. 
 Beyond, clothespin along the lake, in triumphing, 
 Of old, too dense that metal dance 
 A yellow place! that lies and dies; 
 All pleasure, and fantastic King, 
 Faint and clean and heavy, 
 Fire and deep hurried jackboots
