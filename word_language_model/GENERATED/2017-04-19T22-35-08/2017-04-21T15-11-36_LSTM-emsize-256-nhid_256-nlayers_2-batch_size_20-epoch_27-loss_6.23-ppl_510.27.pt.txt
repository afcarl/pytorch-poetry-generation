 Where my lips are wet with taste tenement ways 
 That a great figure would never keep on, 
 Than to say, can't. 
 I am I is a Shakti malignant genome--and 
 Of anguish and of Enid. 
 
 And ringing! Though lightnings have tied out.

 Unlike my past, my come-hither breadth and the snows-- 
 somnambulists of room Flowed, it breaks up me, 
 Becomes a polka somewhere from God.
