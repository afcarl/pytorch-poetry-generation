 
 
 
 To Sleep and be with Death 
 From the old paving lays 
 Through a tufted shower 
 Is a string of bitter milk. 
 Be all the summer which saith 
 Smith. as the beauty 
 Of tinsel waters marshes 
 Around the switching hove, 
 And the soft light 
 Inhabiting the ward, 
 The living form is king or unforgotten: 
 I am the hangman whose speech, 
 Glory are dilated, 
 That you have dreaded to keep them hence:
