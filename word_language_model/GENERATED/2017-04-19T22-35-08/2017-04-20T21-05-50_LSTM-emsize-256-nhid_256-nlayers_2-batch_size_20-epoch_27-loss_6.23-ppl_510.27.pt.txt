But Here Did You Vanish 

 In perfect song for being free, 
 Her gentle tone of her feet 
 Is lit up her feet over her face 
 But a young delight. 
 How will it go her rang'd fossils. 
 Why should this lute but not poor power and sex. 
 Is lovely now with you and me 
 To my depth her race to fare with thine. 
 
 "For now she is a love to control as hurt 
 To Heav'n that time's high
