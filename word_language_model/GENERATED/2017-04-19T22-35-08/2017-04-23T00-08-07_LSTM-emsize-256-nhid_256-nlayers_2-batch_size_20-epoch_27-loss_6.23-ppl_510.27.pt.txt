Inside-Out! Fender 

 
 fingers like a music 
 
 meadow-flowers on a yellow pink wing 
 
 a rush of Etruscan 
 burr with centuries. 
 
 Laura waits for a moment small, 
 render the new iron THESTYLIS 
 Then the orderly men rise, 
 like the arrows of boats 
 in a narrow palm, waved, 
 light and trees opening, form 
 to the hinges of Pliny 
 and torn tress 
 and flashing sown with dust.
