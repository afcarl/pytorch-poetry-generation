 That we butterfly brown and blue 
 Dear, we could hear the communiqu come, 
 Under a continuous arctic light. 
 So everything will be it 
 But enmesh the nails to green yolk 
 rot. All night we have done 
 
 And revolution about 
 Our Spaniards? 
 
 Beyond my candle window, 
 The small voices fairy-tale through the stars 
 Past warily under them, 
 No leaves are summoned to words 
 Over the floors of the godlike 45 
 scofflaw murderous slain!
