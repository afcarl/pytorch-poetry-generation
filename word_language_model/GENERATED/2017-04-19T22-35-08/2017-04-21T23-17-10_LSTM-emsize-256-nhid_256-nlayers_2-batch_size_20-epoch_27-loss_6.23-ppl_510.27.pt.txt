We Softly See 

 A thrush at each little head, 
 After the earn one fibres, Ray. 
 
 All day, 1983â€”I let me groan, 
 Long visions 
 Standing to a bone, 
 hostler, to drop on your step. 
 
 Write you to give, or would that dress 
 Were honoured you, Land of halls, 
 Whom she and I so we? 
 
 
 
 
 
 Announced by Foreknowledge 
 
 
 A full wine comes to headscarves. 
 
 Strange time in passion
