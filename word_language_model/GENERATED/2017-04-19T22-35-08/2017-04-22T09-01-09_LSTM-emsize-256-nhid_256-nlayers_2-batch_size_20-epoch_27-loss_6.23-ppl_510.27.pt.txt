Enemy 

 and Circumpolar antlerless, 
 to it else's him-I 
 is able to repress their answ'ring bodies. 
 
 A chocolate questingly 
 fingernails like apples, an unbodied 
 time. No moon beats itself, 
 elegant in every hand, 
 and earth alone. 
 
 The low world is over, 
 and I am a voice 
 shooting evenings 
 to the mouth 
 of the right sound 
 of a bird 
 that technological my thinking in love 
 above a wooden space. 
 HALL.
