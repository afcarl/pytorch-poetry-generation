Dare Leode 

 
 So a science arose 
 Wisdom in my heart is needed, 
 Nought the action of my mind: 
 But first going up to 
 the dead with teeth, hoping it is there it is 
 a painting with a hole in the nape of the takes, 
 I have never seen a cider-press, in its Fido, 
 
 as if it were nourished. 
 
 Woman, I need, Fu! clavichord? 
 He tyrant angle me unit and rocket 
 XY, balls, above dawn
