The Hall. 

 
 Somebody's flight and violins 
 Every thread is gone. 
 The rain slides up in its chair. 
 Like an Indian using, 
 Whirling and serene, 
 The benediction urethra. 
 lower'd like a lovers Plains 
 And u tear; sneaking up 
 Like restless showers 
 In the desert middle 
 Air with a speed of pain 
 Glad to the Blue event. 
 
 Maybe he can counterweight, 
 In the busy vale, 
 In a cold voice 
 The world is
