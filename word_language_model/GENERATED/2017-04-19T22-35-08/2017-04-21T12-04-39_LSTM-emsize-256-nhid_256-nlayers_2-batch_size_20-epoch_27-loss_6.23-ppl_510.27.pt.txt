It Is A Life. 

 
 Look, twelve years that fell around and off 
 And half a solitary mile, 
 They all wore right out day. 
 And took it up from the old sky in the eclipse, 
 And The Afternoon whine in the water to cast 
 To the little children. 
 He never had met for a comb, 
 But I was all! 
 
 I thought I was as a boy to whine in vain, 
 And there stood a little Night's revolting
