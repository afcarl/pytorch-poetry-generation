To See, 

 Let the sounds ride and destroy them 
 With a mild and delicate trust; 
 Hope and then why have we seen was out day never enjoy, 
 We cry for all-dissolving 
 How will the head steel-set, must leave me: 
 The Burial has not entirely touch 
 And the tympan of yesterday (and on a 
 world fury is Polar abstraction, 
 You, yea studies of loss, 
 
 True the sweatings cults pierc'd, 
 And the bones aglow so green.
