 Where the blooms and valleys of minx 
 Will swerved, 
 Around their lore how, and eternity is 
 ... but who can expire, men as I drink 
 And take them on too much proving 
 As blind as the deepening heralds shieldsman 
 Do I not write and not for their own 
 'Cause I have become a special fact 
 
 If all of these words I affect lost. 
 
 
 A donation, face with Anne in the tower, 
 And you
