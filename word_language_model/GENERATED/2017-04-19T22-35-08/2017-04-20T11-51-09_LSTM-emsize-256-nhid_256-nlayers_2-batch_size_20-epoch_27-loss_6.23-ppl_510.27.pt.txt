Down The Stairs When There Was No More 

 Body of parents, facing off the stone 
 Of gorse cube, wild leaves out of the back 
 Of the Bronx 
 braunches, watching them, 
 Shift time with wine 
 Back out of the sky where the curled eyes 
 Absolute dried away by the algaed windows, this time of old day detective. 
 
 esta night, sideways, of changing gulls 
 Or lowers the sun again. 
 I remember what I raised from forms of permission
