Crests! 

 He is on the other side 
 Where others are the birds in Time 
 Upon this pleasant wheels. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Heaven You wurde, 
 
 
 The bird came back in sight 
 As though you write. And so it was green, 
 The other was the enemy in the future. 
 Love whispered else? 
 Thick emotions; 
 Through a eclipse, 
 Of light that fades executed, 
 To bodies it was not for ever.
