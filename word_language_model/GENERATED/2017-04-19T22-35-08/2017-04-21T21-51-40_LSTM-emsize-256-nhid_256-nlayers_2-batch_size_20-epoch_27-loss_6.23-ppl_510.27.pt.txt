They Run Like 

 At last thy wild slow-dance 
 From the world witch." 
 Though I am. 
 
 Hovering and turbulent, 
 Let the fallen leaves 
 shine down alone again 
 When my father's light grows mine 
 I want to spread over you at your heart. 
 Here, with you 
 A voice like a prisoner bird, 
 Bringing her and her so fit? 
 
 Hopes will I permit letters 
 That I may bury me rather to her, 
 Until I wake
