It, It Is Dead, 

 Wind or Van 
 Troop to what bones by sea 
 meet into the darkness 
 
 futility, we will vanish and go and there 
 As i glimpse these days long ago, 
 
 We're still dreaming 
 
 Tonight, the book as well 
 
 hands have left me connoisseurship, 
 
 And the strangest cannot be evoked 
 To say to the nation 
 Hunger, our wide-eyed images 
 
 mort wits 
 
 in the bottom of afternoon
