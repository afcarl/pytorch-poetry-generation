Night, The Moon 

 Afar while the halcyon shudders 
 Are secure, before me, high begun, 
 See the east, from the shores of the falling branches 
 Rocks of the old woof and each of the shores, 
 The yearning for the holders who, in sea-wools, 
 While the fresh rivers on my mother shoulder to story, 
 But under the trembling bars you understand. 
 
 I like the Queen costs at once more or less, 
 But the chill is black, then you know,
