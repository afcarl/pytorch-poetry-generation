 Nothing more parting 
 Than me, but franticly not expecting you. 
 I don't know 
 But waiting, pedaling on. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The "Purs of St. History 
 
 
 I think I do not know that's awake. 
 What is that we could mean? 
 And grows it out into you 
 these walkilipiando. Hughes crownd, 
 alive in the bad choice 
 will be adore, to write for a thrill 
 boards, but all lets you grieve for you
