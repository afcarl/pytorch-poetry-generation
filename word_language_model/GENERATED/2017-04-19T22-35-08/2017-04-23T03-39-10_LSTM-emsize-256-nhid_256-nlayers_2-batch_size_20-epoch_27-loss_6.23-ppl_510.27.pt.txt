Dogs Of Birds 

 stamped through rooms or thieves 
 To choke us to your mind; 
 
 So soon the plate remembered made 
 A cloudy morning 
 We seemed so far to then had done 
 On the last clouds of the night bock 
 Full of the vision 
 As with blackest Surge, 
 But the angels flow across the temple 
 With the possible and final tap and the Slow-motion 
 
 Erotic as I should call a living hand 
 From the fire
