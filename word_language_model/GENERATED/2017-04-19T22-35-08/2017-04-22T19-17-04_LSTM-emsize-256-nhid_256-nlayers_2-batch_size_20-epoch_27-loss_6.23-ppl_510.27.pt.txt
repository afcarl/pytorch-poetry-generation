 
 I almost am flinging 
 the son of his tennis cherry garden-gate, 
 
 Once I put the pavement 
 into the middle of Apearing 
 and a dozen tree I realized 
 was a color: plastic lemons into a puddle 
 of starlight, closing well 
 in the intolerable eye. 
 
 Because I could think it's snowing 
 on the curving floor, a steaming pillow 
 in His black cap. Lying on that sticky sleeve 
 
 from release the nucleolytic scales 
 on
