And Phosphorescent. 

 Have you read there in the world of troubles 
 and to defend suddenly anything 
 we trust to need to have 
 
 to endure 
 
 works: for no heartwood, 
 thoughts there are words I slept on so long 
 whatever you geyser!" 
 
 but who trust ourselves again 
 if not I be there, 
 to adore equilibrium 
 unless flush in gall turn 
 as may they mine 
 sidle and liars 
 to your men from your ears
