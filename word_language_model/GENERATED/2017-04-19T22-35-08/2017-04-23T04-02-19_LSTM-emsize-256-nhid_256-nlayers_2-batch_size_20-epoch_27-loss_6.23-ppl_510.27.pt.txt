Childhood 

 Has that end, far from damp beauty's beads, 
 mee: Street. scoundrel! Indiana: 
 Touched Southwerk, after suspicion. 
 
 "Nothing" in moonlight on the South 
 One forehead, the other, 
 Poured their bounty together 
 With cryptic comrades and bare 
 Eye and looks back again. 
 
 With a charm she made that spot 
 Shines at the white-winged bow, 
 Johns settling on the knee. 
 
 Angel in his posture -- Angelizes 
 mends and beds, settles in Eden's blue.
