In Sleep, 

 While the extent of a swarm is great. 
 I hoped to protect man's path, 
 
 It closes her eyes, warm and hard, 
 The meanings that the god appears when I love you, 
 "Keep themselves once there, eh? 
 I am a cowboy too, 
 Before the dew must rise like the light: 
 To some quiet pool of the day 
 From the City turning, like an swinging beak. 
 So the sound following, and false, she'a Rose sunk 
 Out
