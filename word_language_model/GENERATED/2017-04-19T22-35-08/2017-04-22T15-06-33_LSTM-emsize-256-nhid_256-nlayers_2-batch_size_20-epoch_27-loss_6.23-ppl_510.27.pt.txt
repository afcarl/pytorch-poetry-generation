 blusterer 
 Laura, Pentecostal at itself & thinks depth 
 of hyht; jumbo hoofs. interrupted towers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Chest 
 
 
 After the air 
 in a web of marrow 
 unrolled to the bus brush 
 
 most hundred and powerful 
 floating" double 
 dot faces have fallen 
 together with the beef 
 stick, someone, the dust 
 Thinks: 
 
 Like one who has a cat
