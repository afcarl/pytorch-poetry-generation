 You are the people, the inventor, the fun 
 Your present body for you. 
 
 My mouth, my son! Law is not refined the point 
 Of incessant skill, 
 I walk on the Toild Sierras 
 
 Of the night 
 & I am not too much twice for fish 
 If life is small, so unclosed; 
 I think myself would come to me 
 
 I am dead as one and each of a way 
 I didn't want to walk out
