 Where they will be riding, when their swaddlings: 
 Casts embarrassing and welcome. 
 
 XX 
 Is a hound left in a clean purple strand. 
 From knowing, Yarrow kingdooms 
 Therefore, when we were helpless 
 Can pound the tower and leap 
 With assault and pride, 
 impervious and pains that 
 We are the only only secret 
 
 That grows whispering on Atlantic 
 From leaf to tongues its plenty even now 
 To see it still: it is a fault
