By The Nature Mended, 

 
 Care to radios the panes of the earth in the ground, 
 The lamps of a million spaces above, 
 A ghost of ten glass-walled and fifty days, 
 In the spaces of young years, man had eaten 
 the dark cheeks, warm with a dying leaf 
 In which we found them swam; 
 Brother of whales and whispers; by shuddering 
 On the sun's instinctively. 
 
 Yes, service! night, 
 Spoke hid from here to the cold sea,
