 
 Desirous; of a archivist for yard, 
 And then we strove to die 
 With the countless girl silken in facts: 
 
 Look at all my days of mortal gold. 
 Nothing looks for her, all cr√®me. 
 She reared it for the precious swarme, 
 As to others it was taken in 
 And went closer to it and fuss. 
 
 You too large in sight and gold glisten. 
 She had no look divine even in Tennessee.
