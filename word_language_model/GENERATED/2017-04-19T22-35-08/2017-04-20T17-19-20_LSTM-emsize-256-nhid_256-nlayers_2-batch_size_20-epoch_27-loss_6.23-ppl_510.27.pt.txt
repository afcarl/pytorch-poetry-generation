Free Around, 

 
 ancestral to fish to groan, 
 Vegative, 
 Drift of the siepi waters! blank ones very dead.

 But must I, for this magic June, 
 Thus: rusty springs; meaning—little wages—to 
 Dat stayed all woods and summering warrant, 
 Twenty times her neck to cheat yet, 
 Play'd his own Master and a aloud; 
 When he trailed the eves and sat in bed 
 To think the beating of my throat pit?
