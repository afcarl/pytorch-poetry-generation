 In the busy school 
 I hear the debris down 
 If the bricks are cold and cut 
 Never through the darkness by the sky, 
 In that broken silence all the ground 
 Closer cares more in its might but say 
 Than alone from the depth of the dying, 
 I was in love with jocund folks 
 Breaking a countenance without a nun, 
 Each were not nothing, so I was old; 
 The magic, the emptiness, the verse 
 I left so
