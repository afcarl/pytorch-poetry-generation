Out 

 In a brisk fire circulate to a tile 
 To dry headlands, I was a child 
 Fell from, the way something flew 
 On you, with it bolts of memory from its attic, 
 With catch, and a hunger had occurred empty in the room 
 I've lain like an aging clay in my assignment, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Light at the Edge 
 
 
 Vaulting The word 
 
 To remove the limits still: 
 His feet light and light
