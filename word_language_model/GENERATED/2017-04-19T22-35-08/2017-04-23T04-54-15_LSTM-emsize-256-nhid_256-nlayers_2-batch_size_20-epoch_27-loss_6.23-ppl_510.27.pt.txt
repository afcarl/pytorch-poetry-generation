 Children the old killers colorless. 
 
 I listen to the eyes, the red 
 dirt with your honours, it was the vibration 
 of the Resurrection, and Stonehenge was ineffectual 
 you sat at a black canes; 
 
 I slapped them so far off on the garden. 
 Cold boys in detested houses swung fell 
 on encircling fields and crevices 
 through Christmas possessing a tray of bedrooms 
 to death. We're on the turkeys
