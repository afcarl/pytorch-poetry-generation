Fix It The Fingers 

 And the afterglow of their kind 
 
 Outside the darkness of bankers, both 
 and spurned in need for Christmas. 
 
 It was the city that rise, 
 the big deer rolled down in the sloping window 
 like a reef beyond the edges of the man 
 who has never had begun to say where he was boring, 
 
 t-shirts. He killed him scaring things to thank the rope 
 which all hearts swing in the Hollywood front of
