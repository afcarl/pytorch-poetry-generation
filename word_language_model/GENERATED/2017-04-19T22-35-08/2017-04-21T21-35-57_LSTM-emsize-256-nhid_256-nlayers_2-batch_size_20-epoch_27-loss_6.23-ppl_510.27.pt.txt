Her Still Revealer. 

 Knowing and offer covered the odor breakwater, 
 Then such as a Russia. 
 
 John Henry rose, thrashes 
 With beef in the moonlight, continues, 
 Creeping over from night to day, 
 In her richest filing nose, 
 From her brown camps and winding plain, 
 On the familiar dome 
 Of bronze sat in leaves; 
 She seems taken every king on the restless lawn, 
 unclean. 
 Her house brushes the breath of gray 
 Her face to her mouth--
