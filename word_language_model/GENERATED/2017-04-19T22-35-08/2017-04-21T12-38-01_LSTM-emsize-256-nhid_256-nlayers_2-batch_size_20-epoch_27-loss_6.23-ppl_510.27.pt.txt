From The Tongue. 

 Sometimes I listen and they were east 
 I went on for my farthest eyes to get 
 rambling, though my luggage had had enough. 
 
 
 
 
 Dust Strew'd with hail! Old Agatha 
 sunned with firmed on the mud, and slips down 
 the poised road in the storm's World, a new god, 
 
 dragged to, personally, days, spinning evaluative 
 elegant Lomax and sere,â€” as if greased. 
 
 Windswept stones clinging to light, 
 babies-- waves.
