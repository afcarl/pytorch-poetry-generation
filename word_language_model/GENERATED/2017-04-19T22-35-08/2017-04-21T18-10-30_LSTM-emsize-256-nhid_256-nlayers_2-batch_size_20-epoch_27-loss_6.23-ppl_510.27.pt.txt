 
 The wan and the used to unanimous 
 Weep on, fresh hags, worry the lust. 
 
 Pontifice, creatures, finding the cross. 
 As long as I felt, practicing the blackness. 
 His fingers skimmed her and his young dress 
 after, his soft shade pitch 
 like a yarn extravagant: 
 
 May I flowered the sky, 
 as if these muscles were not 
 why 
 snow cries out like grass 
 cigarettes, flung through it and the stars 
 
 on the other
