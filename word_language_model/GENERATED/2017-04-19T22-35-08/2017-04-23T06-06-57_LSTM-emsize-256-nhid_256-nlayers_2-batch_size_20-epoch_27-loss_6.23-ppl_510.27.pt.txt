Stairs, 

 And rolled the shady throngs! 
 
 Wild noblest One, 
 The dog born in a departure. 
 All the song is neither rare, nor silence death: 
 Except that he was all the poor 
 Who sat by himself, as of sons to eat 
 Nor silence, for his earthen step; 
 Grave curse he should be laid, the earth no more; 
 Astarte's hair that falls away; 
 The knife, the sting of the past! 
 A soul is not of this, Lucullus
