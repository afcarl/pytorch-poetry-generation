In A Warm Moment 

 I think we approach it 
 Or hear people sit but love 
 J and vanish together 
 By vanity or the rust of Kells 
 Than over; 
 To have been lovers who will have to say 
 Of larger anonymous, not as much as 
 They fails together to Amun bravery 
 And beg them do not believe less 
 
 Enough of traffic or an sacs 
 Maybe nice things, but treasuredâ€” 
 
 And lifted hair to our feet
