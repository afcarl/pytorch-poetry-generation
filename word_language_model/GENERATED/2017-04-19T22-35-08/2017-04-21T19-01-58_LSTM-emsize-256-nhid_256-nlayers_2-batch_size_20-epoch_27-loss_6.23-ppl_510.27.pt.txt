To Meet Any Harm, 

 Not too-large not sun-god to Him, 
 If that are famous enough. 
 
 Fine as the old past cornucopia 
 Lost in the center of the world. 
 
 Then dress the curtains everywhere 
 No more traveled the dark lounge 
 Gives it a resign from out gazes; 
 
 There is no room where other birds grow unborn 
 To be on LAST dreadful good hour 
 There is no shame to Territory, 
 thrown down by shaven lilies and
