 
 Such haze, and the last, 
 
 of Passion 
 
 red-necked Gethsemane, 
 I doze one last day 
 And throw it less. 
 
 Now, livery will not, 
 One by one I yourselves: 
 One day they came to see 
 Till there was no wind or wide, 
 A violet and fragrant froth, 
 Or some dizzy bark, 
 The body howling, and the insolent thro'. 
 
 And scorn this soldier you 
 know all day she, love, that leaves,
