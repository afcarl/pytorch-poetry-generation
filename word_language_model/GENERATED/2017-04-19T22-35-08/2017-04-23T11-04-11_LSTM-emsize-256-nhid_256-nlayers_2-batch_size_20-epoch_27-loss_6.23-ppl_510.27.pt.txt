Dread. 

 
 Last week we will hear nothing but land, 
 That some of our stupefying eyes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 On the Magic George 
 
 
 Sweetest incident that God wouldst age. 
 Bow, car-wreck droops the golden suits, 
 Yet does that blood found still a lyre; 
 Ring upward to the infernal rout 
 Whence patient ruled thy tender brow 
 In sacred soil, upon the pleasant lands; 
 Go straight, those strife Seducer's Men see, 
 Death that lies
