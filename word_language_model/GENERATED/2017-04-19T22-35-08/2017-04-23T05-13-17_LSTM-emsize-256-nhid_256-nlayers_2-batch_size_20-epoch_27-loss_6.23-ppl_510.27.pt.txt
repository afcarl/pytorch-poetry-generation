That To Come The Last 

 Splendour ever hungry, daughter of his cousin's tribes 
 edilla on the Hill this is gallant spikes that run 
 
 At my turn I tread my throat 
 
 My life had powerful worn 
 so well, so many people or there. 
 What was I to restrain; 
 The way repaired. All the book here 
 Is all that they can say where he said to me 
 How he slumped, drear. tender; but that 
 Old life was curled
