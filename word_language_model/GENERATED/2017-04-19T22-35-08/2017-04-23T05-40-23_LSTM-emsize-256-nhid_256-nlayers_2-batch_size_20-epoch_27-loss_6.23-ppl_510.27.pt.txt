 Alas! jeunes Here is you 
 And enjoy in what you have 
 A power and kisses 
 That's blinking laws 
 And their photos as spirits Salsify, 
 
 Then, a constellation moves to the surface. 
 There are explanations and critic with 
 The absurd career at all. 
 There the Crownâ€™s Grainne dreams before, 
 Our thoughts are maps. 
 Through river that mourners? moss, 
 The Senteries locality on Town strand, 
 Lost below the dust 
 By giving up a heart.
