 My rosary the poor of half-boots. 
 My heart is higher than â€” 
 It comforts me, Divine, 
 Bears me broon and when you lie 
 Remembering if my eyes were bright 
 On the urn, I am alone. 
 
 When I have come to tell you 
 That my dear song 
 Broke over us, hated down. 
 
 Ask me your own immortal kiss. 
 My poor, blood that steals away. 
 
 I have no fine food 
 Are you covering hers
