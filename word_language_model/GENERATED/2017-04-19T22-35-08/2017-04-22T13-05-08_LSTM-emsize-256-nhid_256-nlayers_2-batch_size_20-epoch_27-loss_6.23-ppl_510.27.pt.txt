Of Me 

 semi-precious crews come gently, 
 
 Refer it clean. 
 I rockwork through, catches 
 shoes and perpetuallyâ€”to in stone 
 I saw them wheeling into 
 the red collision of the junk 
 where things must have been cold 
 forever. The sun blew 
 
 the horizon off 
 under one hand walled a ravine 
 and drove to the wrong branch 
 
 but not like 
 
 the paste, smoak, amber 
 edges itself, his boot shadow 
 and thought about
