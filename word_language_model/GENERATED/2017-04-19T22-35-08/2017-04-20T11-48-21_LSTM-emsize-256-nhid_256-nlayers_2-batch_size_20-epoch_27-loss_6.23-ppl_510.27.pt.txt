 And early night I stood so near 
 My children, my days, soft face, 
 The udders found her scarf with earth’s clay, 
 And in her namesake of dark Apollo 
 And lovers game in love's sleep, 
 Oh, many one common fair thing; 
 One shoulder bursts from dry. 
 
 Hallowe'en her countenance, 
 Slim different from me, 
 A child had killed her fruit -- 
 She would not remember 
 Her yën each word 
 Broke hand down to their tanning,
