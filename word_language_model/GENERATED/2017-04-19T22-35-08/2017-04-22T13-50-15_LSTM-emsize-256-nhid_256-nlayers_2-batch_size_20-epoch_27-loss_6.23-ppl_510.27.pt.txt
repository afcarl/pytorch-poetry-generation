Light The Shower-Rail 

 oppositional with companions, 
 The others will not become a hand 
 Or a clamor of apples breaks them, 
 No borrowed drop between this circus flutters 
 Or suck it out. 
 
 And God cacophonous, and not fast hysteria lies, 
 And I knew what was in the womb, 
 But I had Seen a book for nothing I was, 
 We put your grief from any door.
