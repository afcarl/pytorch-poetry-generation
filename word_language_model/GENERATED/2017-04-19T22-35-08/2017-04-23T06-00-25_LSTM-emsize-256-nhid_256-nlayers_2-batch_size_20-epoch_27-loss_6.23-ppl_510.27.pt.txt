Doggy Gaze 

 When she sinks in a sweet well. 
 
 If he said to me the great gold Brahmin day, 
 And the dead God-death, 
 That the lightning ride his head morning--no 
 The broad swing of the curving stream, 
 The freckled Moon goes fast and closes, 
 Like a tired of Lucifer, 
 And waiting in the wine of a clatter 
 Of half-read isolation flowed, 
 Rough distances, corn and green, and thin 
 Silently green, fill the outcast star.
