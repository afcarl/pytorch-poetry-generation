 
 No more niggling walks 
 just as a stop, known of the ash 
 
 lays away on your fingers, 
 cutting again to exceed 
 
 the memory of the tougher of the future. 
 
 
 
 s’è does not lie. 
 The last program. the babble idiots, the dark, 
 A yellow centre of the yarn and private beast. 
 We don't think who thy point will go, 
 She will try to break it from us all. 
 Meantime, the eternal silence!
