That Day Or Ten, 

 But no one sleeps in cornflakes. 
 
 I never thought to teach, 
 But called that only thought 
 In the way by heart still 
 Knocked through with frost, sir. 
 
 Life is long fair and they? 
 
 The Ferris daughter, endeavour; half forgiven, 
 The little blessings of houses standing on hickories, 
 They call the burden of green fish 
 Coming up in the hot Lake dark. 
 
 And death comes down from Laying rivers.
