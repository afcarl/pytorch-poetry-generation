Out, In The Faint Dark. 

 
 On the face there was a land sprang from behind, 
 then quietly looked, when you wake to moral Cheerful 
 and mulch of grease at the door 
 and that, like a savage lily in a trim valved 
 for what's made for years. The monotonous Adios!' words 
 as you desire, your roses tucked 
 on the curled gas table, and a hop of white apple, in moonlight.
