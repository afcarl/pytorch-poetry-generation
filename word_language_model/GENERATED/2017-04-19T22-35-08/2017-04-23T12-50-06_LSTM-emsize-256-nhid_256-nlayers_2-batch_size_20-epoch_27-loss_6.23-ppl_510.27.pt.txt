 -- I needed it so close to my heart, 
 I would wired some of the best of tenderness, 
 Thyself! but not to wake love, or find 
 Our naked lyric felt caught still here in her bed 
 And pours your hair to the ground and tease herself 
 Into the depth of it, and I could living) 
 Till I was beautiful, more Flchtigen 
 I cease to share the playhouse that I tire, even 
 Rose-Cheeked death's radiance, then I bier.
