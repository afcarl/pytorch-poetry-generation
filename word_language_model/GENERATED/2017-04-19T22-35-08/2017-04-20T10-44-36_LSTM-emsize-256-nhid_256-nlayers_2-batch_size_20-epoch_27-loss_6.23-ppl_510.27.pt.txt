A Unavoidable Oneâ€”Just A Big 

 bewilderment, a President who may say 
 White and sedans, I teach myself, my dear 
 Is the hound I am an easy television 
 With every bitter sweetness breathless in foreign flakes, 
 And my filthy sister ever hath Mathew 
 And am I not even the child I love? 
 
 Yes silent, as much mistakes, as I, 
 Get ever into a race and turn to look 
 From the foeman's distance, and 
 breathd beyond weal with heart
