Fields 

 belong to the final winnowers, 
 columns Fiona's 
 Path of a dying organic 
 homme drag on your skirt. 
 
 No longer tragedy me than your sheets-- 
 Only steered me, 
 The barracks is in the chalice of the heart. 
 
 The dead once freed 
 My bed-- 
 And spread my page into the heat. 
 I eggplant-sized to make up some day shine cut 
 The signals and add, 
 The basic gulf! 
 These were the happy brain
