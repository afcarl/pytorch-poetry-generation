Envy Cast You Owes; 

 And may not stay her evening still. 
 We live with his torn grace and distills 
 The foam and honours to his tread. 
 Night needs the clouds lift out and loud 
 And valleys, billow with silver snow, 
 She leaves us every alien flower. 
 
 And when she wept by angels stood 
 Like curlers, birds and plumes of Night. 
 
 
 
 attenes I made myself unwilling, rolled on 
 the stripling metal from the love-cries fill,
