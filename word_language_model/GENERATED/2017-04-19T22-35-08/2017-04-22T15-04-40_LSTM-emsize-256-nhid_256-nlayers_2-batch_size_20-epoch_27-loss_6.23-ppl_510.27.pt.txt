 My calloused poem. I was peace 
 Came fast to all the clues 
 Of fighting meâ€” 
 And what could you be right: 
 Was that my living life, the same, 
 
 LI 
 Among 'twas heard the living & the public dead. 
 No head, no doubt, no longer! 
 But all the postes looked sadder away, 
 Three pretty tons of somber prisoners 
 So long and sown in Kepler.my 
 But, England's secrets. They'd heard 
 A durable gesture in vain,
