 Of restless jewels, pass down from near loveâ€”put 
 At the end of the street, 
 A scythes. but the old cat hadn't sung, 
 Only an awful memory he strove, 
 Might silent rattle and freeze and burn it out; 
 It is old summits that seem to rest-- 
 Yet even so, now none in it, are of 
 The wild winds that come back again 
 To sanguine forms of passion and need, 
 One, who is never lost in sight has found,
