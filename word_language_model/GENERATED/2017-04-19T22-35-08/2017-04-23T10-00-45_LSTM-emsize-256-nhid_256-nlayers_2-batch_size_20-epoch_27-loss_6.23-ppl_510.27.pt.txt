 
 The great poet came up. 
 This is how the hallways of beetles 
 in the and ocean flares 
 in the thin of Cloonagh open 
 and the moss that blew overhead. 
 And from the Massachusetts, of hesitating. 
 Far and then the other way 
 had been ice now, finding 
 to the stones whose flowers made 
 to the waters and back of your marriage, 
 as if they weren't not kind of, good, 
 the way they'd set a bone, like
