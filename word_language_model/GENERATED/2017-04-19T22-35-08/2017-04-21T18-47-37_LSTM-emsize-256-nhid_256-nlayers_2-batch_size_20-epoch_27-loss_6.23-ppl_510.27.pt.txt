 Sad man, whom most strong and right. 
 Not a come struck, though you know the devil 
 Which in myths is ibis as before, 
 Away to squeak of privacy.

 Leaves and eye, by the light of the skies 
 And cutting fast upon the fire, 
 We find the light leaning through the soft towers, 
 
 And vowels beneath the siege wake : 
 When the shadow of her lips fall
