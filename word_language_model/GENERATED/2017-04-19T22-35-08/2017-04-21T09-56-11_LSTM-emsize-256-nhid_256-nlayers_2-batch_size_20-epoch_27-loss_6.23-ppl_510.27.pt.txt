Fallen On The Porch 

 
 Into the corner, the refrigerator from catch, 
 Steadily by the sun, a grandmother 
 standing on the backs of a perfect cloud. 
 
 The bird on its deep wooden black warped landscape, 
 And the call of Marblehead! 
 
 The temperate of his fungi, each himself 
 Of all sorts of forgetfulness, 
 And walks into her nurse's unseen, 
 As if that I have left the scene. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Coronet
