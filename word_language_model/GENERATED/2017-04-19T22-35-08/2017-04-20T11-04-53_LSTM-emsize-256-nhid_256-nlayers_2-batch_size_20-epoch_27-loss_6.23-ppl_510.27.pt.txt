In His Sleep. 

 
 
 
 Suppose a con tree & a drop of paint 
 wholly teased across the pane of rocks. 
 Wind springs through the slanted shell 
 at the bottom of what does heart-rending 
 Each corruption has Jealousy 
 a day slide up to flow. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Midnight Afternoon fourteen or, such a santa Made 
 
 
 It had been bright as ugliness 
 Had entered from the portal 
 To shrink from sea to lawn
