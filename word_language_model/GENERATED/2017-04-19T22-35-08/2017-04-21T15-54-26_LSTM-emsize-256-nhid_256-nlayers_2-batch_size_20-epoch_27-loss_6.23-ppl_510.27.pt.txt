Said; When Men Come But She Lies Her Pride 

 And spoke, and see 
 The man whose strokes 
 bows off her golden breasts. 
 Mother hasn't glassware 
 she patio, shuts 
 a little pen;-- 
 Her shell gleamed sediment 
 down the back porch to one 
 And another side 
 Swelling of a one, 
 she may speak to 
 
 her skirt to start 
 
 with its flashy red. 
 But almost torn then, 
 head dripping over 
 
 her glasses,
