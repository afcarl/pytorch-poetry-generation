 
 Bid me see a Song so twice 
 That water lie down in sloth? 
 
 Yet I am lonely as the day, 
 Since Hearts and sunlight love & awe 
 Except that once it feels that I should pay 
 The Earth may give her casements, snare 
 From all his senses to the worse, tu--whoo! away? 
 
 
 
 The water was filled with humid air 
 And fire above them; things to sleep 
 And the breast on its hymeneal came;
