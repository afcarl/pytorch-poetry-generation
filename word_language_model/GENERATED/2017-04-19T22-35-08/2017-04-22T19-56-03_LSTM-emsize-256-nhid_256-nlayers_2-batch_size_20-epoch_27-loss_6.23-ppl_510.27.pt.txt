Me, 

 
 I do hardly speak into you. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Oysters on the Jersey hearth, 
 
 
 anybody, that the whole inherit 
 
 To act your voice, my love, my love's prophecy. 
 Your Muse raced through my golden cot 
 Like an insolent cooing in sunlight, 
 And majestic desert restrain 
 A Beamâ€” that is a noose. 
 
 A thee!' your hands deeded 
 suns--in love what stings buffet 
 In these days of hope 
 
 And
