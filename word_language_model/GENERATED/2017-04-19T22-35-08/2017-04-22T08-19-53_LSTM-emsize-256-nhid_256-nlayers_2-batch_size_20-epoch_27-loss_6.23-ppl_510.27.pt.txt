About A Sheared Pane 

 Or allegeaunce, 
 A couple of falling trees, 
 And from the house of famine dashed 
 For the troubled pine! 
 
 With every violet released refinedâ€”what 
 The just-sustain'd brain of the clay. 
 
 How spake the summer fruit 
 Of labor, or of Art or game, 
 Sweeps earth or the brute of the night. 
 "Tell me what I think. 
 
 For the night I wet the storm 
 When the prowling birds cease to sing me.
