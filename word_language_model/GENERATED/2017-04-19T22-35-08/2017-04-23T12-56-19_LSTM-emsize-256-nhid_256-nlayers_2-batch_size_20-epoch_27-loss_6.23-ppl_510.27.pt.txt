 
 And as there be 
 A house violet-blue 
 Play behind each separate step. 
 
 All ask of me is smaller things. 
 
 Yet who can wring me 
 That measure out a prayer 
 For Sugar reasons, who has it all! 
 My spirit imprint in knot no fraud, 
 I can see nothing anymore, but everything 
 Fell like is struck by light 
 Toward millions I behold 
 From this tender plate. 
 
 
 
 It was cold, as wild,
