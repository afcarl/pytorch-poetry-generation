Arising 

 And down to where they go; 
 
 Then, I say, you dance to pray. 
 Perhaps they are too happy to have rest, 
 The children of maker are cold. 
 
 The tree is calm where the statues are, 
 And when the shiverers want to be no woman 
 To put her out for silence, 
 blood-boltered, in hunger's cedar, 
 New strings are in her belt, 
 And all men mean. You glance down 
 
 Uniting the length of my head
