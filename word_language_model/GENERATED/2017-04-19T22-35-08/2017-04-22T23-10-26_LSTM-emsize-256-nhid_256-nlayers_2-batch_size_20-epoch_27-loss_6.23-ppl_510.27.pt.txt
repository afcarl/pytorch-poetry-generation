Of Roach; 

 And when I first turned to school 
 Sundays as the beast named blur 
 but that is now better than possible. 
 I know his words, making a gift 
 in those speaking: The Ram of 
 waves snaps, fear the star 
 
 * 
 
 And the panes do back 
 They shiver, the sound, 
 May they try to interpret elsewhere 
 
 to know on the Scotch-taped 
 of the immortal limits 
 
 how many a vacancy before nothing.
