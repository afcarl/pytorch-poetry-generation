Neither Only 

 Increase the flesh of the sun that lifts the mind 
 Behold flesh whitestap, stair; claws and cries. 
 Where hangs the heydays of this narrow room, 
 A drips of a pile of vapor and snow. 
 Now a sparrow skipping into a hole in shades Huron, 
 What time to cry the white from its clear will to the adamant 
 Of the Old fifteen. 
 Spontaneous heart, you've borne it soon. 
 A feeble way, turns in the air.
