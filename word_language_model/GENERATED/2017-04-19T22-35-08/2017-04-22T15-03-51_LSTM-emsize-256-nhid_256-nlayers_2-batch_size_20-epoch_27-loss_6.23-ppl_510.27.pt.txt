Scurvy Say, Controll, 

 
 Voluptuous eyes, frail star beneath the rain; 
 In red, gray array and white weeds, 
 Mother of uncreated turtle blue, 
 Deeply water loves her pity, 
 lotfuls all gems with mahogany by rye, 
 Long have he? I know not what you see, 
 There is sweet divine: 
 I am one, love black, beholding you 
 Where flower does scowl 
 Such were bent drumming 
 In amazement of the orbs, 
 A child hath bent awhile to deer.
