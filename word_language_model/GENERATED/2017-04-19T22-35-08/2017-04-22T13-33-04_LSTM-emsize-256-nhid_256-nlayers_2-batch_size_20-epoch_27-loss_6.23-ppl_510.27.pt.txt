A, 

 porch---red oak and illicit cheeks, 
 upside round together as he died, 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Executive climes 
 
 
 Au bars make cardinals, City. 
 Nobody'll shut all beasts 
 Took hours beyond a common loneliness along; 
 The great, first night's looping like a yawn. 
 Forgive me, who is favor heed! 
 
 A letter for that err, can stifle 
 Its wounde, kisses, his due. 
 No heart or body can quite reach his tongue, 
 A rope
