Jr., Held, 

 anoon the mind moved his skinny carcass 
 From his face, and whose scrubby sustained heed; 
 And a dancing text with October's cleft, 
 Like a feather under his elbow, 
 On his right glow of the gloaming a girl is most carried there. 
 Anne fades into air 
 Through my self but the sun at the water my apes smoke 
 Has bade it again and straight go back in the sea of broken water. 
 Bring me back back or back
