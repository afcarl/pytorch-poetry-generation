 sweare better 
 to friends or anything else can seem, 
 after the human sake rubbing into our promise. 
 
 If they weren't so time,' it becomes 
 hard to blow the docks, 
 the pelicans bring its soggy hindquarters. 
 But when our half hundred suites find us 
 in spades and need, one changes you are boring, 
 
 And we who boys and insinuate here and sooner 
 in the deep yard which is upside on 
 for a screw at another
