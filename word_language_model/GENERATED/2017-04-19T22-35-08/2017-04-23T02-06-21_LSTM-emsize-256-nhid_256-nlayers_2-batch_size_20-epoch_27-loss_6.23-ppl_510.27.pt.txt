That'S 

 the things who are very beautiful and brain! 
 crafty father? So they use the door 
 to make us wit. The idea, so I were mangoes 
 and the wine? Tail flame-feather, 
 you who can brute inhale your pain, and don't 
 survive rage as some smart, to be right you 
 
 at last! Your voice 
 now gurgle and cats. 
 I am a graspest of resentment in the shape of five lungs, 
 you await everything you are free.
