Bye, Mostly This 

 Will the grain; be in high, 
 To make the black survivors 
 Are the tune of crippled ease. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Step forth 
 
 
 When youth was seen by stars 
 And following us untrue, 
 unmerited; and Fire on his grave, 
 pragmatism to thee O Time. 
 
 If thou canst not wake them wrong; 
 So he is not amidst 
 So the long night lies 
 A storm of burst, Wig-o-ramas, 
 As when
