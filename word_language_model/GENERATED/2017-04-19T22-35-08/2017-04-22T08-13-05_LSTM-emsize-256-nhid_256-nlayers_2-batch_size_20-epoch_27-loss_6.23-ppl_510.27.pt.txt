 No cry was never leveled, 
 Girlhood's 3:27 
 
 raindrop hangs city 
 And led the three in their upstairs classes seen, 
 splashing by kisses and tamp 
 So long and so sweet the crescent light 
 Had rotted even against the dark sky 
 In the dry afternoon, in Superball health, 
 burial-crags over track of twisted grain.

 Dusk all progressions that quiver near the towers 
 The buildings are growing and in each other. 
 
 They have existed
