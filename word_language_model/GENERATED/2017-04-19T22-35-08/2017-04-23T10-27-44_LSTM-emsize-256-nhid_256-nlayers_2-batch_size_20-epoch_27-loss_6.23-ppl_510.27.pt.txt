Flames Stand At The Crumpetty Touch, 

 
 And in their shadow, in a day of dawn 
 We don't mean that sway; 
 Finally we bend out, growing up in it, 
 
 Soon it was then our male has run in air. 
 Her body somehow licks an airy Thammuz green? 
 
 The room created is life and the sweet men, 
 Because the night is gone, 
 Red and fairer made, by the dim surge, the winged flowers; 
 For you cannot take me
