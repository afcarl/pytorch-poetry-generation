What Did He Have 

 Blackberrying 
 Our fool, your fate: in winter extasy of rain you countryman 
 A window? Sometimes my moods are faithless 
 To Cachoeira, the way it rises you no-see-'ums. 
 
 Or did you ever see 
 The children women remember netherward 
 Of a posterity at school, 
 You've ridden darken and chalk-grey 
 And a breathâ€”a somewhat kind 
 Or prayers about their ire, 
 Man's arrow, 
 Spite of the meat, 
 handle us in the World & dawn;
