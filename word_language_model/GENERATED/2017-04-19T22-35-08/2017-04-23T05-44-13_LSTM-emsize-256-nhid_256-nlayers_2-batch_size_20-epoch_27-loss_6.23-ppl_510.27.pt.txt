Buildings Caught 

 for new and suffering 
 
 looking out, our sisters will snore 
 Be even perfume, no, we could 
 
 say Oh CONCLUSION Saturn, spreading in 
 Nothing, our bum. 
 Their doorways itch with bowtie watching. 
 
 But every year, an azure drama-- 
 Thirty children crowd 
 Pourest all moonmist 
 Under the fists of the North name 
 The Honourable cichlids 
 awning sixty, cobbled wires. 
 
 The sod is buzzing in, 
 I hold God's fleece of foundry.
