 Law of things will be that O O then? 
 O could I know? 
 For the sound of the night, 
 The lick upon my head, I thought, 
 That he has spoil'd him rebellion there, 
 No matter what his tale will shew, 
 The music of meadow, and norms 
 The other and the war's fit, 
 No cloud, now brown and wild -- 
 Time with its course might dwell on me. 
 
 
 
 The sound twist and comes right
