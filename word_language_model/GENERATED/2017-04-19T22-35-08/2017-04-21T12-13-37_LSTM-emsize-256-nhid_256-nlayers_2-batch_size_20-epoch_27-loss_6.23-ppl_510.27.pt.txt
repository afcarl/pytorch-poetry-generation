 
 I like the tale of Iresons Ismail, 
 I found the verse, the harvests, just a train. 
 
 I needling my Hebrews as I held my feet 
 in my testicles ; quiver and rows 
 of red balls drifting in its width of moving. 
 Next day the sky or the cold eyelids begin 
 to the high roots of Barthes. 
 somebody's clustered back like literary breaths 
 of a blade, the empty ornamental Altair 
 wishes they might help me sodenly,
