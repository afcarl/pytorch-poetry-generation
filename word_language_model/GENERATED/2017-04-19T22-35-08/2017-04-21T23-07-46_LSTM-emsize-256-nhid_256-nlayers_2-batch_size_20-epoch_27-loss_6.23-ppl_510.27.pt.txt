 
 All day by summer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Grow Animals 
 
 
 It is Arisbe, A plaque from the mind, 
 And no one Continue: 
 Alemaigne, bloody/battered/beat 
 Not to let sparrows assume 
 And paid it and cried, wherever, 
 No confession here, 
 Oh, a' you â€“ say drop- So mean 
 Your eyes burn over contemplation;

 CHORUS 
 Having flayed shut paralyzed top 
 Are styrian and quiet, 
 Troy revolves to Human King.
