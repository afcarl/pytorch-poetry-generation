Weeks, 

 So often and be peculiar, checkpoints 
 And bring me, my song thiself, 
 Like the gauds and the hurricane rocks: 
 
 And, the years screams flip-flops) swarming 
 Egypt and straw, eighteen thousand, colorless 
 
 Shoes and Zoarrah understand their 
 sneakers, grains of dust going up from the 
 Eaves, 
 The Victors sounds of a yellow plate 
 Pluck'd in white embarrasses: 
 
 At twilight I crawl along and good-bye 
 And bite the sand with a dull light,
