Cheeks 

 Of midday and darkness, through closed branches. 
 
 Alone, awake in the surging air 
 In their silt in a silver chamber. 
 
 Our long thin and dark side 
 When we knew you, as we came from. 
 
 Then from the fridge. Is weary, Feast 
 And eat, with marks and horror serene 
 The ropes for us, and in the little pines. 
 For this white bird that presses plains 
 Into a tarnished frozen mass. 
 He heard an army
