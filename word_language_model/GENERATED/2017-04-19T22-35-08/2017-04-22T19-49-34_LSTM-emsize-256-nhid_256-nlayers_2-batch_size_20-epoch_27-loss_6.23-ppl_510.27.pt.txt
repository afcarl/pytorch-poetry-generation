 When I am worked, when first I see 
 The bear out like the kettle 
 Are total infrequently, to shine 
 Inside their faces. But I remember 
 A thousand peasant influence, 
 Is pregnant with the stones, 
 The great bass tricked to underground 
 In something nothing, flying heat 
 Into a sunny corps, 
 of pathwayâ€™s marble, 
 Unto the golden monarchs 
 Of Hollywood where winter angels 
 echoed to stone after the ivy tree 
 Swinging the threshold, with used-up juncos,
