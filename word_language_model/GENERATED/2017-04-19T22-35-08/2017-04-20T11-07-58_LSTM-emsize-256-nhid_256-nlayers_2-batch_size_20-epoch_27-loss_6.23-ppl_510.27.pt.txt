 
 O merchants oak, 
 Clear and their sweet sweet sigh 
 From the sound of the handcuffs and the joke 
 With the pines, canticles of the bells-- 
 The cricket clipper and the drear sneakers, 
 Pale gray pink, as though the frost 
 Falls there in the Moon. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The lineaments of March 
 
 
 When a liquid lamp 
 Is full of base preassembled leaping, Ancient, 
 green tips. What life 
 Hath call'd towards jollity,
