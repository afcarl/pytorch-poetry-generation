 By our lady in a Part calm, 
 While all spirit of our dogs. 
 
 Now 
 You seemed like a pick-up light incest 
 You tole me your billfold when I faint, 
 Saw Ithaka come and made never grin 
 An' turn back, love or mine be Gunga 
 
 Restore yourself, I'll permit you in a ditch-- 
 She's "Retire." I'll need all men and me. 
 
 
 
 Burning poor women fly 
 grievers clutching their ugly hands: 
 Murmured here
