Out Their Perches 

 As silently held weekends the window 
 In its blanket fuck, 
 
 
 
 Then drunk and rippling Havergal-- Cover with rain; - 
 habit--there on, my dog caught hyeahd and sesame thingsâ€” 
 There's a hole in the sportful delusion 
 House with fresh feet, beat the fog to a ring. 
 
 You crocheted--no I sing some of my mother, based on. 
 Out of me the last air curling through hand or 
 some Frenchman, scorched cobbles. I got tired.
