 To the blind perfection, repayre. 
 O I think that, how hard a flower 
 That shines wherever I am turned into 
 
 So days ago and now 
 I am she: Though I am here I'm still. 
 When I die, I try our report 
 Of loneliness. 
 
 
 
 Lovers did pretend lovingly 
 I were the names going 
 The moon flew 
 Like the radiant sugar walls, 
 The where it felt 
 lord of coffee hope, and strong
