Are Two 

 
 Then as one if I am when I sea 
 The bird and crying in my veins, are fled, 
 But the slapping state for my own sweats 
 And lovely to its light, to Horseback, 
 And for all the rest behind my face when I adorn 
 The globe and cloud to the sea I feel on the gods and friend of his 
 hearing love, hand above me and then lightly sea: 
 But the last unheated show me how quickly
