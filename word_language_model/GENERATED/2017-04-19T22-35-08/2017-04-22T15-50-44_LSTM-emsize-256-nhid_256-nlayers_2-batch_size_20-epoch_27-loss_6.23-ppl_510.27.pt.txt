Bed, 

 And sat in a world while we killed it awhile, 
 And about it and go gray as a river. 
 The silence plays for history and the century! 
 
 Fast in the end of Chuck's and Tiresias, 
 Crossing and round beside them like words on the stone stream. 
 For the hearkening is burning, streight, by track and bowers, 
 We are living in our bed, our minds and sins cheering out in the fire 
 Like a attractive animal from the sea-dusk
