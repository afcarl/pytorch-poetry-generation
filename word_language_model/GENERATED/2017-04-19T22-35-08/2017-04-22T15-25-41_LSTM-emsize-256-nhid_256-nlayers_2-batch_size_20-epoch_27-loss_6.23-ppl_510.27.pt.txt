And The Dark, 

 
 Beneath this wide room, my head's concrete: 
 The lost beer of life, these coronall, 
 And, feel that scholar never exist. 
 
 
 
 I was upon my way out of a room 
 & wrapped the steam far open 
 then hunted in a guitar when you finally heard 
 porcelain water. Now I enter, neighbors 
 doing only aware of me yet, 
 when I looked patiently again, 
 unable to dreams. 
 Also hastily 
 and even there
