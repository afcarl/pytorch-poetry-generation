 A long Man 
 milkwagons outside the house. 
 But I am becoming having fooled it. 
 Even if they get a needle. 
 Everyone might be 
 Like several children, as they give. 
 But they screamed and talk about our Lesse 
 And they searched each day in us every night 
 Of course more lost! 
 
 So long breathes and Bards at to fade, 
 And the green grass had begun. 
 They mocked the Light to those that ever bows 
 And
