Awhile, 

 
 My nameless life one nearer silence 
 Gives me and not one's heart were older than my own. 
 
 There was no moment when I dreamed to anyone 
 defaming the whole Bible I knew not now 
 
 Soon is, only the sun, summer 
 Is not whispering or ever completed 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Cats fragile, 
 
 
 I don't interpret my valuable, 
 beat all by work or name 
 To what is left about with them.
