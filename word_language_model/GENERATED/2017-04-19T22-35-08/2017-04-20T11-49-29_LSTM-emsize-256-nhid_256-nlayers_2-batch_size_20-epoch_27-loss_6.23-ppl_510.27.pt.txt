Love 

 Tide with a thousand hues 
 Are Love ball, soon is winter. 
 
 
 
 'Twas a rainy day I die, 
 And chase the dusky beggar clean. 
 Made it each volcanic watery shout 
 Before he, candletips my happiness. 
 
 II 
 I wish I had a plenty that was paid, 
 And even flight to wing, but soon 'tis day: 
 The city was the good, I told my love 
 Staring through the moat, away loud or cloud.
