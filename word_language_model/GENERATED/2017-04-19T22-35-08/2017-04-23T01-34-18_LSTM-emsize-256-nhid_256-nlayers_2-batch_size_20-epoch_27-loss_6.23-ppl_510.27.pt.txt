The Short Nights Devour Me 

 Three nights and seven people coasteth 
 People who have recorded my life out in English, 
 They did everyone happen, 
 They won't find some other figure 
 With faces that their good parts may touch. 
 They make long Brinded carnations, kelp 
 They want the longest thing: 
 The new night rose up 
 Would build the gin up to the room.
