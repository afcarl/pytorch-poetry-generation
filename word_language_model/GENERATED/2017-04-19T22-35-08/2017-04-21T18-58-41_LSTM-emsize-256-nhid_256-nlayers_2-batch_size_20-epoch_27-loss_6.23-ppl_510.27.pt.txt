Chiefs 

 
 And whom the storm resounds 
 On the lovelier sill 
 Of the depths that was gone 
 And our dream chains and shores 
 Like the ribbons with integument, 
 
 When our hands slants you 
 Into our lifetime as they slept 
 Likewise us 
 To examine a new harmony 
 With the many coursers so quick 
 The green rain forms mama 
 Steel of one moon kiss tuft, 
 Spend this mockery the street-lamp shifts 
 As blossome, Eagle's learns
