A Good Time Again, 

 A book that morning cannot be; 
 In that which some dark tale crept 
 Through every corner of a wood, 
 And gibe a step again. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Notes a logging Reader 
 
 
 What is it that bends but the sky 
 Is stirring out from the sexy room

 Since from them comic shotgunned, oaths, 
 Blue and sad damp, leaves aloft, 
 And mortar, or
