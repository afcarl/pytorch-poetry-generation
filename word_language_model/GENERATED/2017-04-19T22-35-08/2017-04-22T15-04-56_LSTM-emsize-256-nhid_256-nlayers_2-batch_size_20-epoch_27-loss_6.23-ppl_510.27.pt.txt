And Fate 

 Which grows nice to plan, 
 And the light studied fog, was lost and 
 With its melody and its cloth 
 Melodious and loving, hidden above 
 Perfection chore full of sand, 
 Years of the youngsters we bricklayers, 
 Such as the power-forward cracks composed. 
 
 And they stood blindly with together, 
 So did we love the world 
 Bring off your list, you can't be one, 
 This, you felt like blood swollen 
 With wooden hair and quick rows
