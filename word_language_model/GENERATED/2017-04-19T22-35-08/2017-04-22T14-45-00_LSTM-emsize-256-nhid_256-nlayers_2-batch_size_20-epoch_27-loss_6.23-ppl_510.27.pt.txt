Up Or Garden, 

 Listening to a slice of lakes, 
 rising, mumble out of the moonless mist 
 An prancing rope drifting across the Bridge of 
 Reading in construction in this direction. 
 When the wing lights floated like a huge cockroach 
 And often stamped the elevator like yesterday's 
 whiteness. He ran to the roof that sobs crunching 
 At the back of the cast that sees his lips. 
 
 Wind whiskey at the crew, lay him boots around, 
 That begs all
