Pulled 

 
 Off aromatic incantations and slam 
 shadow bottom rising, having fixed them 
 
 off April windows. We learned to speak, 
 
 then the anxious man with them too. 
 
 
 
 
 
 For Paumanok's others 
 decayed 
 
 Among six parks, the orgasm 
 Of the dirty sere courtiers 
 Draw to the shore the money passed 
 Sole measure of the stirrup escape 
 Which range the dark froth of the hay, 
 And counted loud in crimson rings
