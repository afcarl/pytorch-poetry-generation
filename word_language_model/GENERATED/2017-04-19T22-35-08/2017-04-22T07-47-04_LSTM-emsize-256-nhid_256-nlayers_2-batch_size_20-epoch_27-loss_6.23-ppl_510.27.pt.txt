The Vegetation. 

 
 Before the one that surrounds its communion 
 With a slight roaring phone rage 
 Caught in bits of the devil 
 In time--and rather even 
 Of heart, what a certain pleasure grow, 
 And steadily soar a song a-spinnin' 
 Of all figures in our minds 
 Who suffered quite deceived now 
 Someone in other lives is to 
 Love and carry-along early feasting causes 
 And she is led a song 
 And in the East waves seem to fight.
