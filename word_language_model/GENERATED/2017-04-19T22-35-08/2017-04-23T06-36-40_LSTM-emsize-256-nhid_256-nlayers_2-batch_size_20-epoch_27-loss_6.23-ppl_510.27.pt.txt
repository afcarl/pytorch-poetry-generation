Sugared Beye, 

 Who, parked beneath our cracks, night gone, 
 And tied at the double limbs that thicken and jolt in the shore. 
 
 Except sullying enough, we rowed toward and as it turns 
 Itself, in the trees, in June, arrowroot, store? and, Snowfield 
 Itself to take off the image of water, and reads down by the LA 
 East litters their Italy in a heavier, under sand rear'd by world cartwheeling 
 Toward six hundred miles off in a final white socks
