 See your life in a storm. 
 Yes. And it will be still me. 
 Love crawls somewhere Byzant, 
 music, a KNIGHT white 
 and hidden distant a globe 
 above the tree clearing a night 
 
 hedge-sparrow's holsters, 
 
 In the fog a garage groan. 
 I see a rock on the edge of the page 
 we have a vision 
 to be the woman 
 who sighs. Not one word 
 for direction right.
