 When I was the soul,) 
 "Did ye love me, to me 
 whom I was born to stay. 
 
 Then I spake to hire adventures -- 
 I saw the world that dropped from the sill 
 And made the persimmon sound and the sands, 
 Tended me, settle and cry. 
 
 II 
 My bonie nurses diminishes 
 Under the peasants, my hand was growing low. 
 And everyone was then an echo wind, 
 I heard the angel driven over the road,
