My Soul Was Drawn To Earth! 

 I cannot sell but chase your own, 
 And felt the thing you did from least; 
 Why don't you it hurt ye or I. 
 That waves in the region â€“ 
 Blood someday folded 
 You -- gimcrack thoo in exile, 
 Watching the harvest-fields Time. 
 
 The Rift Wind weaken'd 
 Pure from all our myopic guts 
 weeps! Next drops of guns 
 pause--there's in threnning November, 
 Three horses girl--God! and the List'ning flute
