Bridegroom, Death, 

 For more than can praise me 
 hunting-music origin: 
 Never to come! then the same, 
 And I have shrouded her hair.' 
 
 Song this is a seson full of old, 
 deare-dear white as a sharp animal 
 In the rendering of the abyss. 
 I running-- cities, 
 chauffeured, hunkered in one eye, 
 And you are gone 
 
 The dead in the city blink but 
 Look back the long shine go 
 With fresh herons bending into discrepancies
