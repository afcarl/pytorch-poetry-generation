Not To Come. 

 No place for you, no meals or eye 
 but no nurtured 
 
 than in her arms 
 it lies for a land at night, 
 
 there must be flesh. 
 
 
 
 
 
 a-glow, Conclusion 
 
 
 Comes impaled beneath a coppice bridge 
 Laurel and crowing o'er a buttress 
 Upon the hushed persimmon, the sky 
 Leaned open and the last. 
 
 It pressed it infant up, 
 Seemed treadle, 
 It was Thanksgiving evening.
