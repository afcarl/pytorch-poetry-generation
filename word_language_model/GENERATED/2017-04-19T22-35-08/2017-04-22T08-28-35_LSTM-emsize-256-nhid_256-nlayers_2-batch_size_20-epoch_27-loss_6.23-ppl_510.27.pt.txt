Of Light 

 flaxseed, yards & pearl filled 
 the gravid posts timeless. 
 
 pipes crests and guts and wings, 
 flying up and squirrels scaling 
 late walls. Here marks them, 
 
 swerve on a spiral a rainy tent 
 a gazing into its z. 
 
 The glass scales goes open 
 one day somewhere, 
 returning to the farworking air, 
 as the dark reach of coming ahead for State, 
 glenne: yet wagum, No 
 â€¦ no agonizing maze 
 of itself
