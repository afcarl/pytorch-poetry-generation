To Wave 

 
 Through the deep belly of enigma 
 
 The gods called custodians & two images 
 
 Burns on shore over green, and smoking 
 A little like a Red gray sky in a grain

 Love on a plate mountain or leaf, it woke 
 smaller than H.D. mounts, and there 
 He ate maad himself, 
 Inviting all of it, running
