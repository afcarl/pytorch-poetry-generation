Be Your Own Heart, Gone Open 

 When the tears printed around heark'ning only the facts 
 are really born. All things can only be right. 
 
 Before the summer dusk trails its car working 
 
 to shine on. I sojourn to see those who stood here 
 inside the somber reeds that I now wrote 
 to the lake a child draws struggles, 
 But it said he was the more than a chance in moral years? 
 
 I sat up down the road
