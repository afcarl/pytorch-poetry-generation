Pond When Mountain: 

 he had only eaten interrupted 
 water over the wrist as a kind: 
 it had never been a mark in genius, & say 
 that his death had been in his remarks 
 he prayed still she couldn't place on trays 
 you thought that a dream, I began its portrait 
 so their look fat and gated. And a fine tree 
 emptied, betrayed for the designer and drawn to a 
 satin tower, she had no problem you were invisible.
