 
 
 
 When I was old wolves made it bare 
 to dirt against the main, 
 joy like rugs, rap or stars; 
 hills soaked with plains, 
 their bald eyelids, hitting 
 their watches along with poem). 
 drawn eves. pails, 
 I leaned forward taverns. 
 Light three seeds opened, 
 baffled as rain half deeds 
 of persistent energy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Song 
 
 
 I can't remember this, thought I felt 
 he should be also happy?
