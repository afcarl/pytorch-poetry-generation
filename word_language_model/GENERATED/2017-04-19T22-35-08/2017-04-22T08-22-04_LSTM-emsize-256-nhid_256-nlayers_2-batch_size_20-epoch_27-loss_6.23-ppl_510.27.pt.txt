 
 In the steep streets and hands 
 Send back to climb 
 
 On wet branches. 
 
 Today in mindlessness. 
 
 If there were no cold count; 
 waiting to take it outâ€” 
 I rarely shoot the image 
 behind me. Not mine 
 but conjoining 
 
 And, it shall so well 
 be sin to live on telephone 
 though left my head on either. 
 Break my head 
 on forms--ah, like renovation. 
 
 Raging in this Galway.
