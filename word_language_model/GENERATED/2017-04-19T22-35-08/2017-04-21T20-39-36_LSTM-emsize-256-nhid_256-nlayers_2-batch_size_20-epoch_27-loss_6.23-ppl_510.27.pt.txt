 
 
 Madcap blackbirds 
 under silver frozen 
 cheeks hanging 
 over washing roads 
 over the sheets, a fretum 
 bathtub the chisel 
 light pit 
 
 so it loomed 
 like geese 
 blown from shore. 
 
 Wind Burst, and it 
 never owns 
 what was willing to form 
 when he bent toward the dead, 
 chewed out with 
 warning 
 feeling. A muscle 
 companionable mirrors 
 dinosaur, 
 but a bit somehow worn 
 hard to head
