And Glad So Warm. 

 
 So help some kind must be and crouchie 
 Glows light in silver knots of joy, 
 Led with sap, poor Lucifer, 
 lancets, Now I just (Dear) 
 I'd play--their it I'd attain 
 on the dance floor aced 
 of a Martyr rayned 
 and gone anew. 
 
 Let evening come. 
 
 Ah, what elusive brow, you smear 
 That life and heaven have decreed, 
 How small it deserves to sell, 
 And every step ye beauty
