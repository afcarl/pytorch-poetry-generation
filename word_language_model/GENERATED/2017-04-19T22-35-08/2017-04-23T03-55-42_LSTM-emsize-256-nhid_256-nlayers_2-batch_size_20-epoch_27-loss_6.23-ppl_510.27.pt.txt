 
 To note in a haunted valley of embers 
 The cynosure moved from the baby's shoulders, 
 A lump of smoke in a cheery crown: 
 The others rush asleep, like blooms 
 At six, and, when of such swords 
 Are silently blue setting milk, 
 Mountains and talke. 
 I lean midway by, 
 By the side of a street on the hill, 
 Ere the clover or the seaward end 
 What step like closed buildings oceans 
 Before the sea's black thrushes,
