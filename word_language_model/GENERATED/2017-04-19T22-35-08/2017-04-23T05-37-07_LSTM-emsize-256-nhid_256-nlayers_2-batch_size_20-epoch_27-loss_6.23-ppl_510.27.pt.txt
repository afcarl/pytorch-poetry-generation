Albion’S Boulevard, Loud, 

 Where no one was living there. 
 On a roof the angel grows 
 And the window 
 throwest tight 
 In an abandoned form. 
 Then in a window horn— 
 Seeing how it snaps our thaw 
 In the reeds downward so cold. 
 At noon on the hill like prenatal tower 
 There might brush the wood behind a tree 
 O, somewhere 
 holine, flame 
 A square out of old magazines, 
 Crying and close garden 
 No seafarer
