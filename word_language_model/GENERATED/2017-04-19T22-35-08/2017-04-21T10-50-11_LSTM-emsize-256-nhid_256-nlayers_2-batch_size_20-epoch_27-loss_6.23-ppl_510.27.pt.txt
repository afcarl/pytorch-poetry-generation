From The Town, 

 And pointing for me to give back because 
 I was not satisfied. I held my accident 
 That sang the thermals said at taking the blow. 
 
 5 
 Despairing . . . take human hands to help me for the poems they mean, 
 they were truly too long, no prayers would spoil 
 judg'd; namely themselves alike 
 And Dian, teachers smiles, like your mind 
 spotting the meat, and bless that sudden lie. 
 I never had to close
