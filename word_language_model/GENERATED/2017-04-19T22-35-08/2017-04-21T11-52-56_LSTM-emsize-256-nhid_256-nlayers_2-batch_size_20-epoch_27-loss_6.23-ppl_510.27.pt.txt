 Hot morn lock, lilies, over a bough, 
 Making the new jargons? aggravate 
 With gold summits of the broken sun, 
 As with some rumour of Middle moods, 
 We drank off, breast the ribs of the 1970s 
 And the nocturnal shore-steamers, boom, Battista 
 Didst bring each devour'd on the ironwork, 
 We thought till the sun had hauled no ice, 
 Unbroken Billion Horeb, enclosing light; 
 Upon the reef she mused fine asleep; 
 Immortality and comely dew and greenwood mists,
