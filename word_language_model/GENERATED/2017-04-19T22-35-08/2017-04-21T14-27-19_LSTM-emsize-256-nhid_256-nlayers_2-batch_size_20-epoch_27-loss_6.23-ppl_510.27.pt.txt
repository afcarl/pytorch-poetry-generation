 At noon, the slanting lakes 
 Mirrors front-door six or millions at night, 
 ragtaggle miles on Children walking close 
 vivant, buttons under Pittsburgh, ways. 
 The hair and eyes of the lumpy earth, we go 
 and we wake, and is 
 Green and cold in the vast air 
 And like those dancing stars an island 
 And an asshole hard to see. 
 Your mouth is gone as past superstitions, 
 The wind produced flax-dam. 
 with its safety recoveredd fried spunk
