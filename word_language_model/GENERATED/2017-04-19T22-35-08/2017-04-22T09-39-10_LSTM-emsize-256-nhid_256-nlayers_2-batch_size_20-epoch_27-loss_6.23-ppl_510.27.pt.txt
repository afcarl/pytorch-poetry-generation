To Westerne 

 To teach, the water and the place turnd: 
 To touch the pavement and cash its old feet shining, 
 Roses go along a mountain toolshed 
 And each other. 
 El Christ! How mad they had thought 
 To know how black the heart's tastes of me? 
 "As for it were that I would call you more than the ornaments 
 Called for the first nest of freedom, and the silence 
 
 unable to trace them e'en from the night like Jerrys,
