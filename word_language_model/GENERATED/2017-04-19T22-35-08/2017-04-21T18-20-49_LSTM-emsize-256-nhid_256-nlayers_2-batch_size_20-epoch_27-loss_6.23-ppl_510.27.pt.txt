May I Deny 

 Theater mourning to itself. 
 Why beg to this? I will tear; 
 No matter all the world within 
 Immediate guilt unsex no malignancy 
 but troubl'd not on soul--fu'gits or light, 
 however statue-like so unmoved as sweet, 
 A brute would not have my heart. 
 
 For, as 'twere to the chapel rising 
 From the home you will have met it.
