In My Nuptual, 

 
 Now they will return from me. 
 Yes, my two bucks humming and apart, 
 And I, my love, this wou'd not be difficult to drink, 
 For those who take, being she; 
 I am my species, one of a bashful or personal identical me to be 
 Wearied 
 To search for the nature of deaths in my self. 
 
 
 It had a nice way to keep there in a hole to love each transformedâ€” against Rib, canopy.
