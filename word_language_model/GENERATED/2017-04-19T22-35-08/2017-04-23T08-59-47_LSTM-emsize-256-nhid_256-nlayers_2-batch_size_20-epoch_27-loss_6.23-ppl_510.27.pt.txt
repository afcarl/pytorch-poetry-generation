 
 When thus, low in the Boogie 
 Convalesce, iron tawny streams, 
 Blue kitchen, clawed along. 
 That kiosk on a cover, and the house 
 Harneised like a hirsute duties, cry, 
 Mad boy's fast will glitches, 
 Dan, heading after Godâ€™s misery. 
 The cool bag cries, the lustre of Rational; 
 Which is beyond the living "ghoulish 
 The moon without, the creaking of cuts 
 On which we couldn't die. 
 
 But O there is no world? 
 Why am slowly.
