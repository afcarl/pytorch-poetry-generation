 Trembles at noon, where trees are setting cruel, 
 Silent, lit like weak Picasso convinced-- 
 
 When still, all over afternoon come finds 
 Disappointment retreats: drawing out to look 
 At Ebbets disparity 
 In the sap knifes leap and ever 
 
 --A same wee drink seemed late to think of 
 The song I'm in my arms, the mild phone 
 Nebraska, their Frame among authentic, 
 The moral sharkskins full of order sky; 
 Their shoulders but their pains and the enduring
