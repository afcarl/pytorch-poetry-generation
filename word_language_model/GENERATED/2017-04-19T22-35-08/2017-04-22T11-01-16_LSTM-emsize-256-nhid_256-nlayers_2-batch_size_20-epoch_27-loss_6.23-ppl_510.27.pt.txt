Out Of The Florist Sun 

 In the evening isles at night and on 
 
 hinging the weed, a small trace of voices. 
 
 The art of factories, & girls sit here at 
 all the time. 
 
 The yard gathered them like a heart-shaped skin 
 From mist the moon to fish through space. 
 The waters left and fearless, when dawn. 
 
 Vs blow, forehead, hands, clear, days, rolling 
 halls, stare. 
 
 Since the nose of the lemons did sane,
