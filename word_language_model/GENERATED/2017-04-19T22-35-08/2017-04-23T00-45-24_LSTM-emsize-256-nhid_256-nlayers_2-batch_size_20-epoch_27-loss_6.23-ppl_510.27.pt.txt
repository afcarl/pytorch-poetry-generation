 
 LI 
 Perhaps my goddamn cat is upon it, 
 The skin: the grain does sleep. 
 
 Who is with love and smile till dream the same, 
 So king that smiling wide is themselvesâ€”and 
 And sometimes in at the quiet mill window 
 I stand in bed, and close my ear over 
 The pavement and seems to kill myself 
 He looked asleep and tossed the frost 
 And caught me out the pore 
 While he hears the grasses.
