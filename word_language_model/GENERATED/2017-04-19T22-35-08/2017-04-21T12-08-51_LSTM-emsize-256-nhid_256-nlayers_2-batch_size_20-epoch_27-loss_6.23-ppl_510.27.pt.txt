Hundred Hundred Feet From Time, 

 you don't count, the lack, of the desert. 
 And inside, say, the milk comes to disgust that death 
 Is nomadic, and throughther, utterly pulque, 
 White enough to drift being this: the river 
 voicing, are not empty into hotel in a bun that signs 
 Of any future can ever change again is it only 
 To lovers and in scorn and death cannot sip 
 
 Only the bars] thumbs and workers 
 fluff for water their basement
