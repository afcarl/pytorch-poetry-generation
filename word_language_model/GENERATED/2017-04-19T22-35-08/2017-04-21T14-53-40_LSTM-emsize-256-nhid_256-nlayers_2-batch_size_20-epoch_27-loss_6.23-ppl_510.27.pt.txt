 As sweet as the glass, 
 When all the last rare and the aluminum Girl does clack 
 
 neat windows. Grave cat curls finding the wild orchestra 
 thinks, unseen draw and kicking. 
 Within the sailor stool before 
 I assist him 
 for the cosmos, he starts like a blind owl 
 to the house toward the great Gulf, window 
 
 the speaker named his arms, blows his neck, 
 he prayed with his likeness in the air.
