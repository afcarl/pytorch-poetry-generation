Heart, 

 Aware what natural sight does see, 
 And how can there be? 
 
 visual heart is no passion, 
 A glimpse of truth 
 Is there more 
 Whom all things? 
 
 Bradford for those who are bound 
 For indifferent Time, were they? 
 
 They show me injuries after all, 
 To live here on that bus, was a cold change, 
 Superstitious dump, O helpless star, 
 Brave Pussy a curious and no more; 
 Oh, though here we're back in
