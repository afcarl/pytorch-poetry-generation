The Garden; 

 Albeit the map an hour and then 
 A child more darted than one by one, 
 But to live on the top of a day attached, 
 For truth and feeling of many houses, just raise 
 That o'er a sunny scene I was fair and distraught. 
 And snow looked like a field of prayer-- 
 A chunk of bygone silver and a full scythe resting in deep 
 And dreary in the sun, like sun, nests of fire. 
 And now further,
