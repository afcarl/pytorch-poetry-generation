And So So Strong 

 That the wind together after dawn 
 Was gray, and womanly in the light at sundown, 
 The arm that scarce length there is was seen, 
 
 While the bark, sunlight, when there was no sound

 But the messiaen beneath the breakers, blow, 
 Where, the black vessel roll out behind the sun; 
 Came up inside the sacred Kubla leaning toward
