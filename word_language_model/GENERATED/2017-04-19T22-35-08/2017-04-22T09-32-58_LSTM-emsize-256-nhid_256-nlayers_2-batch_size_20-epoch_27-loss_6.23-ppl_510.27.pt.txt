Of Babes 

 Became a wren. 
 
 Daffodil red heavens 
 With whimpering odours 
 As when the barn came high, 
 And another, 
 And the sailing shade? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Topography of the Lock: 
 
 
 They chosen I've seen one o' them 
 Just as bracken as their blisses, 
 It still must stay down to an advertisement 
 To save an open hand to lose; 
 And yet the toils would all distinguish slumber, 
 Men's faith,
