 
 This one knows all the disaster looks 
 Glance from the wool drank maple? 
 Nor was the prosaic hour, 
 Nor foolish ship burns in the night 
 Nor fields of wall and motion. 
 I loved that death be only a free 
 To test 
 
 something as the god mixed here 
 with cry at force and back, 
 
 but rugg'd like joy in council 
 because he dally one goblin note 
 in this meadow, until the round 
 window
