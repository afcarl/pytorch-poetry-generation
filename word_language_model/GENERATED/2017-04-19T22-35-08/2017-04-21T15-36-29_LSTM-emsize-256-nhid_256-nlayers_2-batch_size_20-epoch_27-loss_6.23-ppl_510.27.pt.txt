Winks, 

 Are I safe in a day. 
 
 So much is done at home, a year too. 
 
 Where did you care, 
 this aint I 
 What have I lived 
 Is in my pleasure I say. 
 As that was the word 
 Of the wild perfections who, on there 
 Like those they looked from the ancient hand; 
 And they grew behind, 
 And the infinite petroglyph 
 Bear them from the car my toe 
 And my finger lay off
