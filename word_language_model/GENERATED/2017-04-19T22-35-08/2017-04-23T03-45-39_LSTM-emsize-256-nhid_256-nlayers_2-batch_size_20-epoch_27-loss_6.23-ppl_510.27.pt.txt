Hazmat Tree: 

 If yourself be white with anticipation 
 Adrift unto each anger 
 Because, before itself 
 To know her name. 
 
 
 
 Only to go to the long four bushes, 
 People do. I have told the limits they'd died. 
 
 I walked under the thin skin It's matterâ€” 
 
 I smile, more sweet to the clerk than he. 
 But there is no other room on earth 
 America is the turn here shines next to us, 
 And now
