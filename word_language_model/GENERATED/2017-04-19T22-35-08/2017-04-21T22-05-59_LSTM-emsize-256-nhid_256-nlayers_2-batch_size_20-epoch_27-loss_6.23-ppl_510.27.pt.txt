Night 

 unconnected by history, rising words: 
 the arches orange to the sky; 
 
 on a grassy bank, the glistening legs continuous 
 Nam amid the enormous shade 
 of pomp and luminous space rais'd memory 
 by his deep skin and how of a hard color 
 they pretended not each and hand 
 tear the air and gathers itself where harness! 
 stain rippled with the china which there's a red slab, 
 then shine in the window, as stretched as many lines
