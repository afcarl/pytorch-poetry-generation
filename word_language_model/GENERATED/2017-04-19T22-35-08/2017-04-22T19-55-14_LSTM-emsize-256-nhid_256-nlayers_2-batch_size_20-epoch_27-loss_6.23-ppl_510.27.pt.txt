A Realism 

 
 
 
 
 Light comes from head to work, 
 By the names that Aurora calls 
 May!) Through droghte 
 wanderings, threshed dwarf slabs 
 of lime, and flaunt rain, harrows white, 
 like a child; 
 garden on a naked wreck 
 
 Steadfast were lifted 
 one of the blossoms. 
 
 The bones noticed them 
 and the clear air and the rooms 
 were pink in the cold. 
 
 In architectureâ€”and time, what was there for them.
