The Rest Who Saw, 

 And the deep black beachâ€”just 
 Talk like a mountain that coil 
 Doubles the restrains. 
 
 
 
 You pushed the seventeen tunes on town, 
 Then, like a rose 
 "Rapt over me. 
 
 Around me they fall 
 I was coy, and on the walk 
 By movement of sand and sea, 
 Together even in this or that 
 I to have loved friends I knew 
 Or I loved for a time by day . .
