Of My Being 

 clutching everything against stars 
 found mine and a candle 
 in the opposite that the whole land becoming now, 
 I unexpectedly reach my fatuous city flying 
 between her gaze, shivering, her breasts 
 making a do! Listen, the disgrace 
 was left all over her neck, 
 down caverns which were my terrified way 
 of light and cheap, wild news 
 as you put it on the road. 
 
 beauty and water all that we carried 
 
 to
