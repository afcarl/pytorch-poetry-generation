Me Hopeless 

 May blush, (my heir is not from mine, 
 Is not the fiends that pursued thee, 
 I have survived five by the peep of my fate, 
 elk young and four Sus, pale 
 On the surface of my tomb I saw a wish for my body 
 Glad to clip the bounds, 
 I was sometimes prepared to enjoy. 
 
 
 
 Exhausted Snow 
 
 On one side of the spring 
 stomach began 
 to have a golden museum.
