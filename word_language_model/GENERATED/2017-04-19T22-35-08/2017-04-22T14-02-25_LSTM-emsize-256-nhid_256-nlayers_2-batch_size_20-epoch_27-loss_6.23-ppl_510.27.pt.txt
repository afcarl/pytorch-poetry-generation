I Reach Around 

 My thrash around forth elend 
 
 And now the limpid eyes won't wed 
 Until the boughs beat bivouacs 
 Of a sunroom, for by one voice 
 I heard tobacco showers. 
 Wait to give you somewhere, 
 You fucked on the kitchen asea 
 Morrisville might dream 
 The notes they proceed for, 
 To the shape that dripped across the bushes, 
 Your kiss. The appropriate restraint 
 In my heart breaks at my Fukuyama, 
 Sang barns shout in
