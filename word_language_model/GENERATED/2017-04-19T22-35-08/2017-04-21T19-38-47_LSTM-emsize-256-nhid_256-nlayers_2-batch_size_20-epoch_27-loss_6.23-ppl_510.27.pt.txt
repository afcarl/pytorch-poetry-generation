Big 

 oak flowing, above organs 
 used to watch her and onto his cold 
 reading distance. 
 My wife was my brain 
 like a canopy of wine, 
 pressed in your lap like a shoelace 
 with her mortal, withholding haste 
 marking your cheek 
 
 to face the fallen door, the vines 
 catching an Suicide between black stones 
 and the cane asks her telling me 
 about and I had clean her on the shore 
 no one can tell me
