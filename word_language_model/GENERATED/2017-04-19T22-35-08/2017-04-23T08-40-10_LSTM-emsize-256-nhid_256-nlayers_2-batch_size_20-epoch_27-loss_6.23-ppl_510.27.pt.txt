 Amid the valise's knots, 
 Revolving in the shining vest 
 Of a legended Dews 
 And Psi, for Learned speech. 
 
 He is a bride and drinks a kings. 
 He has no scar, or Mussolini

 Deign to sea, to look up the flesh, 
 wardstrewn eyes or gun, 
 ________ 
 
 These days before how and savage, urn, 
 And touching by the thighs, 
 A running page and seat by knyves
