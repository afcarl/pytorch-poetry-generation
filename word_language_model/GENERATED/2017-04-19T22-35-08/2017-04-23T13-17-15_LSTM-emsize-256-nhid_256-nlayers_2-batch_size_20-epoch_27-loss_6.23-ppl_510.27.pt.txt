Night, 

 And after the rest of our summer, 
 
 The sky opens in the film, blue as far 
 as it curves from languid feet since the somber moon 
 moves over you again a narrow expanse of cat, 
 tentative, sadly, we loved them. 
 
 I've never been tired, you cannot understand. 
 You know why days are more trees, 
 can tell how to quietly discover you, 
 date bureau for Matua, 
 the pang in libraries in the loom for the unseen,
