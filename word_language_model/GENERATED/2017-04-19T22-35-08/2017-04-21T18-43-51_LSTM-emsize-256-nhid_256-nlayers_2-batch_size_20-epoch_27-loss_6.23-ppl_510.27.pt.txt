Weep In Love 

 And set songs on their clenched clothes 
 And bask in flakes of winter sea; 
 Red with accomplished sun. 
 
 The stone holds 
 No glass: afraid, 
 And no one still waits for me! 
 
 
 There is no hut for my disposition, 
 Whose eyes, though well be travelers, 
 Sweet are soft 
 And strikes I burn and mists, 
 And there is only New fire, 
 Not to keep them together. 
 
 It goes out alone;
