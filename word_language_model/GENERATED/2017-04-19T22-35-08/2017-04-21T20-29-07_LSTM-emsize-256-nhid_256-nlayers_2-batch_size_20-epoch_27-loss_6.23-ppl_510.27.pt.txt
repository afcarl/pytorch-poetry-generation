Lot. The Mountains 

 are in the water, 
 
 The cloud the watered pines 
 lie out above us, press 
 Up the snow. 
 
 He buries the pine! 
 They shout up the soles 
 Across the cedar-limbs. 
 
 chords, whistles backward, 
 Electrocuted! O land! 
 The drink is speaking 
 in shroud. They draw 
 Saying the tide â€”oracular 
 Cleave the eyes, 
 His teeth closed, 
 The fallen shaft where the sea 
 ventures on the other side.
