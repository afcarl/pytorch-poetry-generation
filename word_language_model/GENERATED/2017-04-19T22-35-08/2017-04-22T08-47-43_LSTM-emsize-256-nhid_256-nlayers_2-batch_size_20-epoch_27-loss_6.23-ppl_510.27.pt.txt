Empty Scale 

 Happily crosses the yew Greensburg, lounge 
 plannâ€™d, to become what is that moment 
 Swayed to the earthlit living ice 
 So I see the damage of a human 
 form is not this very beginning. 
 These memory of the year that is nightfall, 
 Elysian brightly split around my dreams 
 In the magic wave-edge, the eye of St. York! 
 As a madman stirs the rainbow's compassion 
 underskins Iynx, and cheerful Ideal, 
 And the rival, listens to its ancient
