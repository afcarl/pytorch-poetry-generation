As State To Hell 

 new gods, sudden fingers in your breeze. 
 
 lozenges, momentum in swamps of light. 
 
 
 
 This is with you 
 a horse on the time 
 this is like 
 a poem 
 as you 
 stand coming and plane, 
 tossed into my teeth, 
 finding an occupation for the time 
 when you are 
 born, and passing, and, after your 
 orbit and yet touch 
 its rooftops, heaven! 
 I can see you 
 forever,
