Us 

 Come into boats in the sky and onto the stove, 
 As if drift a room in three or ten days ago 
 We know the difference in the open waters which remained 
 saying. When we will come again 
 
 Easy to us our beauty played in the time 
 Under the waves the sun coast 
 God! Hold your eyes in Ulpian like a naked uneasily
