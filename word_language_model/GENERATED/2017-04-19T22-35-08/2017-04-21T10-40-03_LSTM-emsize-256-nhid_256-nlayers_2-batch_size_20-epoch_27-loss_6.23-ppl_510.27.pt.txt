 I only saw the ship 
 Would shape the cold bright air 
 Till the sun leaves out to stir the grass 
 That I might do again again. 
 I can of summers saws flies, 
 Winding down to a breeze of gold. 
 
 Is the sun and flush of hot grass 
 I see one thing that is burned, 
 Wait till I leave the tree. 
 
 Yes, yes, the pause, thus strikes to moan, 
 A trace of gold and brazen despair,
