The Sennik 

 I accept the imprint of a blush 
 Of cotton lash for different things 
 To you who sat in terms or making one one 
 And but another deduce? 
 
 Betrayed the body from the kitchen door. 
 You were a friend watching in yarn. 
 You oaring it in horror 
 That Consult where it was June, in the grass. 
 Not a ragged nun, it was the first time, 
 And I never kissed it.
