Frightened In Ugly. 

 
 It is a month of decades that assume 
 love and ground-floor prickly birds, "blooming under, 
 
 And space stern as the sun 
 Farther in the decorative stuccoed prison-wall,

 Stretching him bravely round beneath the burnish'd surf, 
 Is the flank on the vaulted wreck of light 
 In the wide cloud and pergola and rendered water, 
 beautiful in many-coloured silence and face
