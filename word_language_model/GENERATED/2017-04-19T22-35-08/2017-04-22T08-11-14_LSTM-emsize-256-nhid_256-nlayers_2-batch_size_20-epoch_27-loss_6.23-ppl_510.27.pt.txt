 I eat the fingers of the margins 
 And, worked from the biscuits at dusk 
 Walking a lattice of a bird 
 With a drum, lonely, broad's roofs 
 Assumes with listened. In the blade, the accountant

 shiny in that craggy warmth 
 
 Is that day of fear I am not 
 hookah and kissed by speed 
 Of "put expert and Brussels. 
 I love myself, and those of me 
 All the conventions of things
