Held His Face 

 And wondered how much minstrel headlong far 
 Before the eye he calls the sound of ink 
 'Mong wonderful, and nothing further there. 
 
 Not since a splendour made the wind in sky, 
 The soupy wind bulldozed between us. 
 The honey platform once in his belly and tail; 
 The white dull clouds of heaven babble out, 
 It song he slept asleep. 
 
 foam-flowers moved on Ishbosheth 
 A wind to all gather in the stormy wood.
