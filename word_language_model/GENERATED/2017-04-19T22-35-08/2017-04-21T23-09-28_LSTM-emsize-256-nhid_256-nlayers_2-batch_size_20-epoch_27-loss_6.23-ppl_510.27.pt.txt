 Of gynst to wrap all the set of my face 
 The shadowy fountains that crown the gutters 
 
 Of oxen beautiful, a chevron love 
 Can be lonely. Do they remember 
 ityopia eyes make life back 
 
 Of a dove powerless upon the world 
 A change in despair 
 Louder beneath a hunter's hope. 
 Sure the richness of the next tunnel, 
 Its bonnie self intertwined 
 To fetch through the tantaliz'd 
 Of touch, that now 
 rightâ€” contrive in
