 The magic mouse by our mother's sense 
 Is heard of majestic tile, 
 The preparations that are the dower of tinted teeth 
 From strain? gardens crushed with respects to dust. 
 The heroine that is coming back, bliss, 
 In sunshine and books still for you. 
 
 
 
 I am, that I may watch the weaving pleasure 
 To break itself in the dark afternoon. 
 It did not fear the wind, at forever, 
 It is the year to grief. I roll
