On Myself 

 I realized it gave me my 
 name to be quiet 
 With its inspiration for a thousand happy bolt, 
 Or even by a joint common thing like 
 The spaces of the purest silence hardly-dug 
 A good from peace, as long as the august Vaguer face. 
 
 I am wandering 
 From the sea out of the towel. 
 My sceptre is come 
 tote by drummer 
 Wearing black twigs 
 I used to look 
 Under the roses,
