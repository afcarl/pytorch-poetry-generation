Out Of The Air, 

 With the heart and one 
 banishes the leper's air. 
 Nothing that took to bear Jim then not 
 Listless, nor a child, makes your strut in the room and 
 watch tasteless discernment grow 
 Back now by your naive companions, 
 Unless it spent he-port. 
 
 I've cast you into you a shell 
 with her coarse hair woke at me 
 
 still burning there before people 
 bear my shins,
