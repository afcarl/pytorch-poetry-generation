Without Flaw, 

 Things wash them up and wash their breath, 
 AMETAS 
 Our truth's black-and-white types grown stripes 
 And golden, cans and patches champs 
 Were Garden of matter dark, papers, slow, 
 Deer invisible, calling wing to place, 
 And fed our heads with blood, we all 
 hearpan against one declining sky, 
 Stir exquisite war in sight. 
 
 Meanwhile, the dying warp you gray, 
 All the green half-moon spun away, 
 Till by now Sing you free, the 5:30
