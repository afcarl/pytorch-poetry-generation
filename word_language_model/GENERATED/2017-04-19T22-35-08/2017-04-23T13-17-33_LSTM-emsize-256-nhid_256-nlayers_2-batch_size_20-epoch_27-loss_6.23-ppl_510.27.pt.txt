Or Tails, 

 To the waters, goes at dinner gates 
 And wake with them two lavender eyes, 
 And they crossed the salt coal down; 
 And, a thin woman that sets us new. 
 
 
 
 A pile of moonlight pale like a light 
 superfine his slim hair was thick 
 Through blown ice, complaining lights; 
 Heavily burning still on thought dash 
 
 against immense lawns Ives, 
 plectrum like wind into rows 
 begone--but flying for rain.
