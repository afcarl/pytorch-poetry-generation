 Your clothes of packs send away 
 Your wild Painter and song, and look 
 And quench the shadow of your skin -- 
 You are a aqueduct and no doubt I view, 
 Is lying there, the empty russet wall 
 androids down, and up, 
 And looking up, as if 
 
 The vigil of an evening 
 That number sparkling walls 
 And waves of Frederick bees 
 I again). my shame 
 Under whose vanished brow 
 The wakeful sheep-hooks all around
