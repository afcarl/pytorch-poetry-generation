 The flukes in their heatwaves have stroke 
 The avalanche airplanes, alleys 
 Ever cherished there. 
 
 Their children recite stopping 
 Does not laugh the same five cones 
 Like vibrations of the smooth! 
 Apartment with the skeleton I would be 
 Gone beyond the future, 
 By mere sequester'd powers, 
 Where it has left me all: 
 I cannot halt from all love! 
 Still another grave, Thy sunflower 
 Behold the crowd in dangers dart.
