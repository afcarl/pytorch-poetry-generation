Men 

 Kind of weightlessness or say--furtive, 
 knowing who for the form of the rails 
 
 which all around the pale. I will 
 imagine my clear tent of day 
 like some first web-footed an 
 avocado cunt and a dark 
 sinking of itself, an island 
 young of my own Gush!--flush 
 some pang tight-fisted upward 
 to a California farmhouse 
 and the glided rope resin of clover 
 the war beside the dried flower 
 
 and the midnight touch
