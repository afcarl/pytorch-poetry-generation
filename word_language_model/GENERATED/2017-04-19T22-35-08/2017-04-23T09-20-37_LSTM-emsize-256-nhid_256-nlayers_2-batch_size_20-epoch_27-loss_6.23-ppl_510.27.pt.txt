Down. 

 
 Sparkling chips of lights, 
 Books. He asked. it shows 
 Its flames in the hold 
 As for one drop ring at all 
 His dark-eyed forty feet 
 Is bright as metal. Or 
 He will blot off his wing! 
 He regards one dawned on the back. 
 He is the stain of men 
 Seen through the human creatures 
 
 Like an oak newborn, 
 At one tree, 
 refusing to city's 
 boss the crab 
 And shoots culture-bound:
