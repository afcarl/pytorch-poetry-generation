Say, 

 which burned as the remarkable Norsemen! 
 
 blessèd peacefully! sell the grace from my heart, 
 
 the soul fall at the fiery glass 
 as it finds or this smoke in midair 
 
 could be 
 more paradise and then 
 we bob snuff, feathers 
 and the race; 
 — fop odourd inwardly, 
 self- archery. 
 
 The neighbors another's-- the change 
 with their lepidopterists 
 Grass chases Heaven 
 and Autumn, meets dreams 
 
 of white the harvest
