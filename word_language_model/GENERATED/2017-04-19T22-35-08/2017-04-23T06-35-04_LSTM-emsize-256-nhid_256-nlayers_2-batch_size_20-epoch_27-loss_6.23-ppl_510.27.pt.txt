To Me, 

 Twisted and greener and seething dead, 
 Else haughty; this morning by the night, 
 Close to gray rains to keep me free. 
 
 
 
 My and two roses all the fowls 
 is like a balance, but nothing but food, 
 and more under my bite. 
 
 
 
 
 
 the Progress of the party, Fond bird! 
 
 
 Kings doth rest, 
 and there'd not rock again. 
 Later, 
 
 mind what it is. 
 Wait.
