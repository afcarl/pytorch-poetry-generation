Of Jest; 

 to wet parts floating around. 
 
 It is not so much for all monsters of the bears. 
 I live in this place where heroic creatures die 
 at depth in the spirit to be done, 
 the world is finished, it is only a day. 
 The song of the long B-52's are lined up 
 and with corn fruit, 
 are spectral and flat in the fields, 
 the poppies sing to their feathers and summits 
 are the debris and steaming
