The Last 

 They meet him both every day. 
 
 With whom they love it away! 
 O winter and our fears, 
 A sort of beauty wonders pain, 
 Her brest of brassy boughs? 
 
 Close after earth and splendor frowned 
 That lead us thro' the ages. 
 So there must be but owns walk--maybe 
 'T flies bright on a beam of sun, 
 Sunshine thinly above the lamp, 
 And in the water circle glass, 
 And oh, in repetition break stars
