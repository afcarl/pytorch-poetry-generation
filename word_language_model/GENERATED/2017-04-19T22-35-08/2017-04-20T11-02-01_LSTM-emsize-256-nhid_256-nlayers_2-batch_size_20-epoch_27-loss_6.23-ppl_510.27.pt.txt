 So deep to light the swift leeches frizz 
 In rainbow eye; I drape Barney 
 wildling she never inked-red 
 Such links and age of ease and mine, 
 As laws once did, and where I see. 
 inâ€” you're here safe visibly 
 In deep sleep tender, 
 Will find up my lost age; 
 Running through the night the year; 
 So let me fling my heart away 
 On an old nacre-dream, 
 Where the frantic kiss 
 Hath left the dream
