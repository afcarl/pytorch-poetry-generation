And Tragic Long, 

 With its toothbrush off green and dark lights, 
 His varied hard soul is like a funeral Monday 
 Where the Creator's beat and infantile; 
 The sound of the unpaid (80 is how. 
 The harp inlaid up with shame and the dazzling forest express'd. 
 
 The fable adventures with the grey frost 
 That bowle around so little attempts 
 For they know, their song makes them snows 
 Under the oaken seas, like wind in sunlight.
