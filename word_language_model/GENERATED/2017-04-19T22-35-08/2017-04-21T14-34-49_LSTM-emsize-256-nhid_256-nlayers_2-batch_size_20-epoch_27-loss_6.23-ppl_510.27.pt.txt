Say 

 God laughs into my face 
 For drunken until the lark, he braids. 
 
 The saints are shiny sweetness 
 That under liquid caves and walk, 
 If they came to my room, 
 Chain'd in the still golden October 
 Of eternal September while His 
 An hour should ever played; 
 
 He hangs by his forest where his face 
 saves all a little Dior fume. 
 Suddenly one translated his eyes 
 'All the agony there has no King; 
 stall.
