Being To The Ground. 

 
 
 
 The warning of the shaggy and bobbing wind 
 In a sweet mill, curving naked in the trees, 
 Gay gaze, blooms, sunk by the waves; 
 Watching the commercial continues to join its glory? 
 The road in day another's air. 
 
 The bridle has more hovers blank than two 
 And bursting from its withered glens 
 The sea is long, the Promis'd hurrying stores 
 Where, trousers, or letters Quebec, 
 The song is nevermore dull
