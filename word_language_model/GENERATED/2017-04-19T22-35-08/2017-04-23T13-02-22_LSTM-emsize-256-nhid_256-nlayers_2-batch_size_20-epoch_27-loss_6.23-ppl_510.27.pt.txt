Clay 

 whipping the brittle pole 
 Used to find our past ____, 
 Or cast a melancholy daughter. 
 
 And down the branch, the clouds 
 On the sunlight floor, Petersburg 
 Finally the sky rose dat 
 At bundle doors lift forth for a forest. 
 It was the same as you feasted will speak 
 Of life and love & hate, when it was 
 That power it was me. 
 
 
 
 You walked through yellow water with all my mother's hands;
