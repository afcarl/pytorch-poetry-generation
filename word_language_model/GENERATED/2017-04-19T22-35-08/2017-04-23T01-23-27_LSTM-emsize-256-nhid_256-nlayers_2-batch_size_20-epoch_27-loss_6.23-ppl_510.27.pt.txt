Under The Morning Cloud 

 Behind a winter springs of owls 
 
 pottage, you think all your garden, 
 Make it of it yet, perhaps, my love returns) 
 Your heartâ€™s coming, your heart I forsake you, or care; 
 But the death is not a myth that comes away, 
 Like a gold rose beyond the ocean birth; 
 I learn the poet's space in an aging resort 
 While round the afternoon till it had lain where it looks 
 Before it happen to that
