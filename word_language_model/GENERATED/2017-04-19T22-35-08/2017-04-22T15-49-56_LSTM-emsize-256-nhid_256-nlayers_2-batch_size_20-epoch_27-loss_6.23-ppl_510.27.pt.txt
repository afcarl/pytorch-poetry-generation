Have You Chirred 

 Above radishes, 
 The light holds you off with that white, 
 I roll off my house and throwing the offshore 
 I rub 
 
 My head and to the earth is 
 asking us a thing elemental among 
 sun, with open calm, in silver subtleties. 
 
 I walk to your eyes, at the feet of the great 
 Seven cloud-light, quick-coming years about their streak. 
 Young Loves, you taste her power. 
 Grant you pie. Your Shrubbery, Deckhands "Pies."
