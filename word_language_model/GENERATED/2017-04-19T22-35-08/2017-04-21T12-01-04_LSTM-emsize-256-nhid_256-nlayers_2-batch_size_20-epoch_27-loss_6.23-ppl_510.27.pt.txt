 
 Throwing a carpet in drops. 
 He calls up here upon him 
 The world is innocent! 
 
 He has told the shit what life 
 As a completed edgy, comes 
 To find her buzz away a long way 
 And the Great perfections shall search in heaven? 
 When for their first experience 
 He should have nothing to their dead 
 deeply children gliding across the 
 covers. He will not bear again. 
 
 Teach these music for the rest
