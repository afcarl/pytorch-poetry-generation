Get Blue A Different Life 

 and try by what it does, fucking 
 as it was 
 until all the boys live here down and gone without 
 
 
 Now if we got to fish it alone before sacrifice; 
 To checkpoints or wing, implants into isolate girders. 
 But it wasn't possible to believe anything. It stayed 
 The way a disguise and no one could have, 
 To enter it. There was always accus'd, 
 But our very starting return, bound to bed .
