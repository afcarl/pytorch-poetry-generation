 
 I cannot see how the body rest 
 But keeps not really, all fierce, 
 This needless soul but he's wrong. 
 
 And then, who said, Son of Nature 
 Hath nobody, but Kneeling as I am, 
 The twinkle, the years, the thumb; 
 And how I Could not declare 
 What life looks strange, and what 
 Grow up him low in me? 
 Since then, she whate'er they took, 
 Melting me, as many a virgin moon! 
 I laid myself them
