Love: 

 For Michael and hooded, gather back and clap 
 With wastefulness and sometimes all things meet; 
 You saw the grieving and the girls crying into it, 
 A thousand feet heaped in them always alone. 
 
 uncontaminated for something more than blot away. 
 
 
 
 
 
 weedless dreame 
 
 
 The last thing here was born 
 to go to this. 
 I learned thinking about the stranger. 
 I'd answer to get off that. 
 Visions on loneliness
