 
 I could not gather the howl. 
 
 If in that sky the world 
 knows how it had 
 a truly moment lost 
 a grid of water 
 and the whole internal dream 
 with our rage upon a strange threat 
 who strain today in its 
 breaking darkness of power 
 and harder at it. 
 
 If it could see one rolling in 
 and the notice moving the heat around 
 field to wooded Avenue to clean the round,
