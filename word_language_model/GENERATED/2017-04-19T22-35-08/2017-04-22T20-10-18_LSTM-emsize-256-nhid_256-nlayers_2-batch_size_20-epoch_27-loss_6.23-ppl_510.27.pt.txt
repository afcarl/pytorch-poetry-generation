 Your riding a fleet of pharmacies 
 Improve my precious mother, like a ghost 
 To spread a dying garment in the gay, 
 Lay holes in the palace by, 
 O mossy parts, and glow at twilight 
 From the red sunrise porch drops down my head 
 To lift my miracle through heaven, 
 council's myself in the proper sky; 
 I hear, caw leap not toward you! 
 Fountains have descending, so long we lov'd, 
 At the end
