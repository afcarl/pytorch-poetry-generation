 They heard my baby tea in a blood 
 and coil in the red, 
 storm to bring out, and the moon 
 was born, even for anything, 
 
 amplified into silence from the mouth 
 waiting for miles. And that's the elements' 
 tired tale, like a butcher's goat. I would 
 be a great bundle of butter 
 with peonies dripping from yodel--a 
 or falling, radioactive breath-- 
 silent, Ford, but O! 
 it wasn't a setting release smell, 
 no matter how
