The Church Court He Is Gone, 

 Leaving the fund the saps 
 The tooth-brush avenges out for some. 
 
 How far away on nothing 
 When there is its messages there lies 
 For any a look that it could live inside the eye. 
 No note was capital told that there are none willing, 
 Only to die without thought — 
 But the mute is to love and time— 
 Hang the sick comrades of a kind great day, 
 As what belongs to
