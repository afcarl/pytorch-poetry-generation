From Town. 

 An angel might still remember 
 In fury flour/ prescient 
 Not to a selfish talent as usual, and happily, 
 Where else will he return, not so much based. 
 If beauty be done in unexpected jealousy 
 And is full of so a blossoms. 
 
 
 
 In the days there are delight in time 
 Which made the dead lie on. 
 
 The supper is in the air-- 
 The consequence of god. It glinting, beloved--the exhibition 
 Tell me
