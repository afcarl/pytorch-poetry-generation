To The Grave. 

 
 What, would have they been, it appears 
 Drawing pop! but no! 
 We must most die so flye 
 Except at last and tomorrow, 
 Till we have been, 
 But if you stroke it, takes this flight, 
 And in this queer moment there is fair; 
 And in that joy we owe 
 
 To earthy estate, 
 Were having Parsons, prizes--critics 
 Better winning in what stings 
 Her pungent madness awash 
 In strike-or-embrace apron 
 SPEAK apace,
