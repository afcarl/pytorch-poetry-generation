Before. 

 
 Sometimes in street great North 
 They are dreams of feeling they do not love me, 
 They beat me in the street. 
 
 I thought of shame for them to go amidst 
 You must get out of any afternoon, 
 Whose hopes are bent in alms, but because 
 You aim my fear. The veldt. laughed in the shade. 
 
 Hands stop in meaningless shit, 
 Not sitting down in the semblance of the street. 
 For the Death that invents
