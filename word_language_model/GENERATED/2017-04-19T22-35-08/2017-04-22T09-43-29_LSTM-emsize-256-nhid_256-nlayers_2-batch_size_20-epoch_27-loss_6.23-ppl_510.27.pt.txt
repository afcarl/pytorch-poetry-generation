Or That 

 Has no flower-dust fine. 
 The statue of the Mississippi. 
 She's a tomb, look at it in the blood 
 And rattle idly among 
 The trees again when lightly shines 
 In one ravine some clear weed 
 I live in life's pitch and tied it all, 
 Again my marvel, I will reproduction, 
 My lord is glad for us. I come to keep; 
 And thence at twenty-two, the silver thunder Good-for-Nothing 
 From depth and privy lightning, and the pains
