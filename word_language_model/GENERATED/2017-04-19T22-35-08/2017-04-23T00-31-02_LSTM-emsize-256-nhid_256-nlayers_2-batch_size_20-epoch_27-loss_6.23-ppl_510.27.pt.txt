The Front Dark Apart, 

 inspir'd. between all steel forget; 
 Borne tennis through accents and pain 
 Of absence, and on the stroke have cost its fruited star. 
 
 
 
 It will be aorist. 
 I used to dryhten, 
 I am daisies week's flowers; 
 I will spend my poem 
 As never before, 
 To help the thing 
 Of the place which is on the hill. 
 I have devised life. 
 I'm amazed to myself. 
 But I can't remember one,
