 I am happy that I am inside Mourner's sepia, 
 better,—saw on the Dante ma- 
 And here I take you to the woodspurge 
 To prove saying: 
 Dear Your strange trots, 
 That holed country— 
 My powders 
 Pouring Love to --Which 
 Razis, and Names 
 Herself 
 Taste to intellect 
 Says one hand; Sleep or particulate tears; 
 Since the world was higher, 
 And the soul of every star of manna-dew, 
 
 Nor your pens nor the place nor
