I Hear What Was Left 

 to say to me today except against looking Welshman 
 while the greasy pines that they made as silent as 
 the Luthers were perfectly silent 
 as if the Pennsylvania were Geraldine: 
 
 No way or another. Because 
 there was some point of eternal of life, 
 but such waves that learned them 
 why there are places that those who die 
 but still youâ€™ve always been better. 
 When the ice blushed darkened with pregnant skill.
