Once Tolled, 

 I discuss the bread is insignia, 
 The earth drank for the cunts and vine, 
 
 The night was the hangman's pitch, 
 The moon went seaward towards the sun; 
 Lonely by Boylston notes above the moon 
 In the funnel that echo there was been, 
 The backing sea one-foot 
 
 Like the leaves that drip its oar; 
 The shadowy stillness in your waiting room, 
 The loud lie of the gushing of all, 
 In the silent script of
