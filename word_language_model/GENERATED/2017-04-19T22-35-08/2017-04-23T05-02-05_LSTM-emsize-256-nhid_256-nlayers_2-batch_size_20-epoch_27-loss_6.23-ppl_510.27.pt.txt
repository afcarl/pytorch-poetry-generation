 And for you never with children 
 least borrowed Commissions in the stage. 
 Have you always been equal. 
 Meant in this little city 
 I've done thousands one nutting-crook 
 And would laugh as the plow there. 
 The earth would fly for: 
 I read it that was swinging all day. 
 The chainsaw ran through the mask 
 Of the moon. 
 
 Yet no longer 
 Could I elude thee over, 
 No rain disappear in my clay 
 To shape those
