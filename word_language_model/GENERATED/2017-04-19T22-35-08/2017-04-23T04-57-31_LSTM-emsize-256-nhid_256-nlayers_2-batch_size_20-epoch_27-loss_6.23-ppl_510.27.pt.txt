Dollop Of Flame For The Grown 

 Piercing; crumple with inheritance. 
 
 But it is not famous to the wall. 
 
 I know 
 On this side of the apex of a giraffe 
 I'll come down the dahlia, trowser-ends run away. 
 
 It’s a blister in green overdress, 
 with the bone soaked—one 
 a new nucleus 
 
 and never popular 
 
 the distance below 
 which seems to stumble off 
 its limb, not above the Roman 
 and car ear
