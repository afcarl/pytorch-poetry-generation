Empty-Headedness, 

 
 eggs a mile through the valley 
 Of canyon curtains pacing the thick mass 
 Of yellow deer burnt on a roof, the mold 
 Shook over the intractable floor. 
 Tree-trunks and quick falls from the sun, 
 As if choosing the candles that lit up light 
 One gathering hour at once 
 LXVII: on blue coffee with the loam on flame 
 Of Joints, but for each but nothing possible in the form 
 Was beyond and over through the narrows voice
