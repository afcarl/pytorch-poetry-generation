Cord Of The Hills 

 Toward the clouds from the stars like a young man 
 
 Born under the river. Nothing did he refute 
 
 From the surface enough 
 For all the time 
 I started to see how my friend 
 is making of his finger 
 
 Desire, I find a kid 
 whose sound written on them. 
 
 There is a dearness with my joy 
 
 and that there is no hope 
 he comes but at the end,
