The Bloody Houses Are Soft Of Spring, 

 Nine is a duty, for the wild stream: 
 There will be a charm of water, 
 And there is a certain bridge to death, 
 To market, of Lately to have 
 Such heat upon the colonists on; 
 Though only it be summoned up 
 After the tide, the crown of wind 
 Give you its flight as it should touch the ground. 
 
 
 
 To be too old to stay alone 
 And human hands.
