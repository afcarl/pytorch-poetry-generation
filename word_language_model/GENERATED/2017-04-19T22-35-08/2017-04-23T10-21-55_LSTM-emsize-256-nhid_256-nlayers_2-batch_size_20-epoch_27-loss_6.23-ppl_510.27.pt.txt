Of All, 

 in the wind. 
 
 
 
 as tired; wails to Picasso 
 and set the earth, 
 and down with his remote doctor, 
 where the pitcher mote 
 his passenger, 
 straight blade 
 on my branch; 
 the color of the marrow. 
 
 Out on the Canadian cheek, 
 as a lengthening curl, 
 he thought, as from a pale wreck 
 when I too lie 
 Flacce, a man 
 & my husband geong/ 
 smelling of felicity 
 white
