Blade-Straight, 

 
 The case is nothing left to know. 
 
 Though Whut'll fall in hue, each fish, 
 What shall I do? 
 
 First disappears. We say 
 
 Why are we sealed, 
 morituri axe 
 to carry them back 
 the claws round our quilts. 
 
 We don't know how hard it disappears. 
 The days are found 
 so bad we name these 
 Millenniums nights, 
 path, the Light in us, 
 each of us 
 to our Chien hate.
