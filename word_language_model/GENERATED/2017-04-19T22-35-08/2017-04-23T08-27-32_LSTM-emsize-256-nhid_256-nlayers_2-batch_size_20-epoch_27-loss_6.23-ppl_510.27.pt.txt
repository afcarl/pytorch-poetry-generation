Whereas The Wordsworth 

 Hass riding down 
 Rye by backdrop 
 and on a major pack 
 a dog stomped for two doomed day 
 in lake or a yard with snow. 
 
 That daylight on the surf 
 by pleached wind tacked up 
 its dreams in a Freedom 
 which is Flowed 
 too late for the sea's majority. 
 Please bitterness . . . . 
 
 Hand tights ghosts La boys 
 sitting on the bed to a starry 
 and exotic
