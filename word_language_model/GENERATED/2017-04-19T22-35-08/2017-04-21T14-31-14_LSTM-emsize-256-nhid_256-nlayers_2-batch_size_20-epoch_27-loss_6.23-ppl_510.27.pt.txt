 The names of all the others, grieve, 
 Not only numb is what you do, 
 For the short age would surely be altered 
 to no disaster. 
 
 I do not discern the laugh is not hell, 
 no abiding suffering is the same; 
 Nothing that possibly lies too early to be. 
 
 This in the cabin of singer! a brief day. 
 No X, but their moonlight is the surge that water, 
 Charlotte who knows, and what is it you so
