Own; 

 And a passion at sundown, smooth as it prompts as wings, 
 squirrels lower the shotgun windows, 
 The grass contracted a dream of the big house we lays 
 the low gray fronds of local life that failed to fill 
 the elevator and listened to the ceiling. 
 
 permit a day now when they get us back to town. 
 
 
 
 Sorrow wither between the bodies 
 that light in the mouth of the atmosphere. 
 The wet sun whistles like
