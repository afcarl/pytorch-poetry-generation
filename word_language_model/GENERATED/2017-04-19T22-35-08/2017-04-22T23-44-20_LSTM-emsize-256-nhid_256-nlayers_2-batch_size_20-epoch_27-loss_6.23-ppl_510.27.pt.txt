 That they all were change; and that place 
 forsook the doom that could work, 
 Making into the safe days of year. 
 
 No touch they could renew your neighbour 
 Still waked, we said, They, in the long grounds, 
 Getting like a dust on wilts, Tomorrow, 
 While trees begin to find themselves 
 Against the borders objects of the script 
 Which begun to err without scenery, 
 Dispersed the summit from the hats. 
 This morning over twilight hills to house,
