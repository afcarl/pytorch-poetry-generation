Like Something Pulled Out Upon One, 

 The heart that blinks through town to feed the heaving desperation 
 To spirit seen with music from Heaven or miles 
 On the long pine roofs that had buried the howl'd, 
 Because I woke with them down in a dark glow, 
 This story so ripe," as fronds 
 Of Possessor: No turn of life 
 
 I maintain them, audience? 
 
 
 
 I roll through a cherry tree 
 That orewhelm the train from fresh-cut river;
