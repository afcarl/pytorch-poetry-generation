Are But Browsed In The Years Of Air 

 As they are; in the technological night 
 As the snow rose straight, 
 Come back, hell, well alone. 
 
 All are the letters. 
 I know petulance, myself and yet free and over: 
 But won't proceed by present well, 
 And so will always flow on loving, 
 And the same divine work of words between 
 Her Nolde bark the alien ones 
 To drop themselves under the voice as I cry.
