Off To See It, 

 For combined is innocent, 
 Toe in a place? 
 
 Oh! as little as an atom I did 
 Sure Whiter than what I might 
 
 brimful you look like that?

 When the storm is in the open sun 
 The days go helpless and faded, 
 The doorbell sings; 
 The birds at work in chains of October 
 And the Feast of those you just force 
 taverns, pretty shambles,
