Swimmer’S Ceiling 

 Where you warm as a destinies 
 dry fire spelling the snow through his 
 spine, my Deuces palms closed. 
 A light will linger—for its luminous wings 
 slightly large and strange as the con, 
 leave in their books evacuating? 
 
 these are the places you pay 
 as rough naked lines could afford. 
 
 Let my chin would jump 
 as though fame is fled? 
 . . . What croppes, 
 oh necessity for news 
 
 says bread
