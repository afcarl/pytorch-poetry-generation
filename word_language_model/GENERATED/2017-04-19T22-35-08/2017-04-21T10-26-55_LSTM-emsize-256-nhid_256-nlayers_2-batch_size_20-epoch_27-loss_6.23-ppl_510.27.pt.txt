 For Now slaughter, their red blurring, 
 Your beautiful wonder! 
 
 Come, "Whate'er laste, 
 Do you not write of the raucous day 
 They are in time for a day. 
 They seem so blue-print I gone 
 And more more more. 
 I have got looking at each other, 
 Green and rolling in the dim heavens. 
 
 One kiss, yet each day, I knew, 
 And no one by one returns, 
 But let them slay and brooks me. 
 
 tortilleria,
