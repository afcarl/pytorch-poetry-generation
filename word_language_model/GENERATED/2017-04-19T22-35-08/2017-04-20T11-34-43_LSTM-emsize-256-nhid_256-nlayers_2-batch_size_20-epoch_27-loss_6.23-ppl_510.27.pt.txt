 
 When you'll go drive from shore to ground 
 the slope wind gone, and is still still. 
 Which is my window, I need not even 
 be Here a God should listen, 
 "Spires says, take me, 
 calculatable flocks and wood, 
 Cristes Mother, dead." 
 
 That day the round of a pool is. 
 The storm of torrent dies. 
 Shows so wide in the far sun 
 I fall too late! 
 To have rid from this well.
