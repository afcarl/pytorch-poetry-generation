The Day, 

 All seasons together spread 
 
 Full-foaming winds and pheasants themselves. 
 
 They drove thee and devour the light. 
 
 And there is still another life 
 That lies beyond a year to cry; 
 A woman wants to use one of your ankles 
 And find me ticking in the face 
 Of a tiny, feast 
 To what Forerunner to me 
 Through the retake here after me, 
 I liv'd somewhere low and shamed 
 Allureth all too different guilt.
