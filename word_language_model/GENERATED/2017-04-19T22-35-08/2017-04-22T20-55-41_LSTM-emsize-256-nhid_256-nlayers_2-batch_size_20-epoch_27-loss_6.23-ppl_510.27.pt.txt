 
 One conducted brightly strangled with pumping 
 people in the dark gray water he loved 
 
 And so much faces, only with his face. 
 
 His sheen/wrinkled was good and easy 
 I was like a child with a stick. 
 
 Every nomination on my foot, was Ruth 
 Wilfingum; he did not understand a strange one. 
 I no longer saw him. 
 With which each blast of a rose wanders 
 Alone in the blue ground; luminol? 
 From a house
