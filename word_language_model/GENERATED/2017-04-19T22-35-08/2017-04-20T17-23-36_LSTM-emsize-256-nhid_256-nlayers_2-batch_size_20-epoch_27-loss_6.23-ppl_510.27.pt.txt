Of The Bliss 

 When the cruel teachers of air are green. 
 
 Enough for FALL, Who is to-day 
 What made to say, fern and I have begun to 
 
 write Mortis or bitch! 
 
 Sometimes doorplates key'd

 That folks might please. And this

 Back to such a numerous charge, 
 
 A ritual without hand— 
 And behind us now, to follow with it 
 A sound instead
