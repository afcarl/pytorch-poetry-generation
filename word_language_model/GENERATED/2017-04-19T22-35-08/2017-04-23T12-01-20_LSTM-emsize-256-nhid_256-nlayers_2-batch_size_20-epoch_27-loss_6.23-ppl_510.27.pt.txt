Roadway, 

 But the old tarn of red 
 Are gone away from the acorn; 
 Absolute homeliest by the earth. 
 
 As you drive the honey head Sericana, 
 white bright as briar 
 beggars with loud shards and barking 
 as the light drops down 
 upon the flesh the whisper is the field 
 it will be lost. When I think 
 of the torso begin, 
 and I feel my eyes 
 full of all your progress. 
 This pang shall be
