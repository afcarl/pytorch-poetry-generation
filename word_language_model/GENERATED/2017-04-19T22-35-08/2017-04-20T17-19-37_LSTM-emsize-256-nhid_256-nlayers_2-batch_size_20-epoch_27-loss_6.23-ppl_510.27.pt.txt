Feels Oddly 

 blat cunctation... dewy hide! 
 low-burnt broad spiral 
 
 And the silence pulling up her face, the empty blue 
 With sunken carrot welcomes her a thing - 
 
 A child he held on with an everlasting fire 
 And the unusual surface of her lantern, her 
 
 consequence, the rights to the son by her 
 In the afternoon of a night of fire 
 Her chunks crack as if the sea winds passed to roam 
 Confirmed beneath the sodden
