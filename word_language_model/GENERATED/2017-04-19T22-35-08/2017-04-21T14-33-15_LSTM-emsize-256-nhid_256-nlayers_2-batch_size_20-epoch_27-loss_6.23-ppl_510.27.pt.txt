 Life is uncouth 
 progress while I'm not being crossing "drapery Rainbow 
 just still, dark at the orange window 
 slit '31 
 appeareth. 
 think I am old 
 
 and a rabbits' workboots, builds 
 red and blue. 
 
 by night I seemed to hold my father 
 a paper big dress, 
 
 and grow ready at its late feeders 
 and bend a lovely yellow truck from the sky. 
 We are together
