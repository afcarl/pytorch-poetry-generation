By The Mother'S Table 

 To see the sweet white vault the air gone past, 
 The green impression of flesh in the swamp was seen. 
 
 The woods with their boats had brought 
 Their bitter dark at dusk in rage 
 Toward the head of the rattly dynamo swim; 
 Not blocked up their eyes, 
 And after the inner clump of ships on earth 
 Was taller than they can contain them gone; 
 Lived in the handful, everywhere, death and the moon,
