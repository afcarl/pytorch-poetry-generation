It Love'S Will Have For To Be Peace! 

 I laugh all the earth and no more more! 
 
 
 
 
 I have forgotten my children. 
 My lungs have come and do as disinfect 
 I know how to teach him how to explain 
 how friendship will I seize in original play; 
 at Flynn only in the desert heat, 
 in the courtyard, blow; I laughed, 
 and dream of all kinds of collapsed, 
 these knaves shall exist to exclude me
