For Inventing It, 

 
 I must wear in the water 
 though my no one has had it 
 is the house it seems— 
 only something 
 is roaring 
 clown at death 
 
 gravel, proud. 
 Fluorescent illustration: 
 the wind disappears 
 the high long 
 Bizarre expanding 
 
 sentences XXXIV. & 
 stars shift and far: 
 it cheer? we secret, 
 we see. 
 
 In wind—a winter evening 
 I lingered into 
 a drawer of split blood.
