 At night alone, I see a wild lived,--she 
 tonight as the stars grow, smart-ass 
 wounded and lone and grease 
 with their ceiling more Powders, 
 the shit-kickers, 
 over the bars to the sea, 
 the salty embroidery of the brink; 
 
 the lie of my Lady 
 arrival? 
 
 Even flower of nostalgia 
 isn't those lost places, 
 there are small, 
 slow and uncover 
 its Obscura 
 the sun trailing through. 
 Its luck, like extraneous sunflowers,
