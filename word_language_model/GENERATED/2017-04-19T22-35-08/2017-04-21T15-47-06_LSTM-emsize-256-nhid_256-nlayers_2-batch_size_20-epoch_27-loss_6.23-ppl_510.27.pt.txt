Me Flimflammeries 

 The cry of heaven defeat it found, 
 
 I counted teleological 1944 
 
 forgives, as soon of all I Ternes 
 I thought it is a hour like this: 
 For, as I stood with speed and fill. 
 I wish that day oblivion wae shall find 
 Rest my rage, and have the market-place 
 Prithee 'twas that I unfurled, at feeling 
 I shall grow one, that ever at least, 
 As breake to spellken bone.
