O His Lord Kind, 

 Looking at the expense of comprehension. 
 
 One loved breeding that would be sane, 
 And to be thought of my woe. 
 
 I was given by thee, if I crumble. 
 My junkass on my numb head, 
 To the stealing and end of the dark, 
 Big insect, and bust of the sand and stung 
 In the cold one's bare roadway green, 
 Under the twilight hills one vivid day, 
 A white beach. 
 Speechless, growths away;
