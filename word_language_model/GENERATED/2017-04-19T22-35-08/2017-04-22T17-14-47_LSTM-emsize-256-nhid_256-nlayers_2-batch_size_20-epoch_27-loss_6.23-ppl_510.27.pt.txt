Flat. 

 
 When I blow cool as the uniform 
 lavas to the long oak shade, 
 The lights that sear and breast," 
 The mountainsâ€” husky, oceans cover 
 That its mellow stance where every boroughs, 
 A Whyles fane 
 Branches of owls and bees, 
 Reducing the fairy listeners 
 That the plague were rank, or sweet, 
 Past grass and the sea. 
 
 But the glimmers and the wind 
 Gleams and stalks the Summers leaf; 
 Classroom yet evening new;
