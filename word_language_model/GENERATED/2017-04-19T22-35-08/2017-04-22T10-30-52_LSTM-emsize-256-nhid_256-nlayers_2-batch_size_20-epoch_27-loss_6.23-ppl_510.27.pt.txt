 
 And in that city you walked and up 
 From a deep midwestern panther. The Piraeus 
 scratched with behave I would not put it up, 
 As of movement. 
 gyd. reflection like a moldy mouse 
 impure; and so manipulated like skin, 
 When you came to your bed, 
 But in the woodlands the voice of the soul was 
 difficulty and twists, Arsounas, yet it will be later. 
 There is no other sadness . . . . . 
 You smiled,
