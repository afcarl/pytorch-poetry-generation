 
 Topples and fallen metal. 
 Some time to more strumming 
 To us than in blinding limits 
 Of old perspective 
 The sudden relative "Mom" 
 In which the sense of life itself 
 call-and-reply, to count and takes 
 Of one of all you sought, 
 Mamua, or drag and bloom, 
 egg-size affections, guiding and flour-de-lys; 
 Although the Soul is just a-flying; 
 And to my ear exists, 
 This kid I thought, which looks so just. 
 One new person lurks
