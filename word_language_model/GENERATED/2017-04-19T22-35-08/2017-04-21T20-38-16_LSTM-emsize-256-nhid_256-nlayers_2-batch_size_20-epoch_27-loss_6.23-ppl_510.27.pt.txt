 Oh, there's all the things of your life, 
 The son, the peace, there the form 
 Have made a rise across the sea: 
 And yet what it feels and in that fraud, 
 As though that would cry on in it garrulous and callows, 
 Because the cold needles of that thing in death 
 Which glide back into that grave, like this blind shell 
 Which makes a garden pledge the different as trees 
 As rough a tender texture of
