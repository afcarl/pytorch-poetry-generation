Dunkeln Old White Witch Pieces/ 

 gold-rimmd lady shades--to 
 
 I went out to see how the sun that glittered 
 from the back seat thrown by her shoulder 
 around the kitchen empty the length of 
 a world where things were in gay light 
 And her neck her eyes hard then 
 lures, we dress the backs 
 Of twin buds, and bribeless 
 Rather, last night burn, 
 I twisted floated on the floor. 
 
 At night I've entered the dark
