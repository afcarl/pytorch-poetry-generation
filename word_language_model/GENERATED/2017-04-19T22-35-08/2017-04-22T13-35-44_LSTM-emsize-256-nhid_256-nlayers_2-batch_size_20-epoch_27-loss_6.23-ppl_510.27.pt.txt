From Summer Fire Cloth Pinned 

 Like sun-torn coffin-lid: 
 
 No slave lies here wings? 
 
 Through feasts, or over tower or ice, 
 When the questo lie as it darkened as we lay 
 Beside the sunset or water or warning 
 
 I fly through 
 The smells of misses, 
 The word was sleeper, now someone began to speak. 
 So it is above the chokingly head and spasm of the sea, 
 And the meal wait up at the heart to Hagop
