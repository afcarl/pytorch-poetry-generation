Gloucester, 

 
 Whistling to the window, quarreled on the wall, 
 
 And this was one and most of all, 
 
 Something to one another pleasure. 
 
 
 I would indeed be a call. 
 
 It will be true and that I am sinners' you sweet, 
 Not a promise in language, 
 Not a lad knows the thing I am. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Town sauntered on the Book of the Story 
 
 
 Whether thy diagrams shall expire
