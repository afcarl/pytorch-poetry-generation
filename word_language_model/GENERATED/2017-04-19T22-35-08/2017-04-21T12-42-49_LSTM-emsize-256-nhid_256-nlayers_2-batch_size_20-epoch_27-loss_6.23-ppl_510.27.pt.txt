The Skies! 

 The crowded day shimmer, 
 And whose purple dress keeps new 
 Than but instead on them. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sad Boy 
 
 
 Full of heaven; 
 Like a falcon 
 holds the river's purple string 
 Where the white pale violets lay. 
 It played in a dream, 
 Sounds of fog, and noon, 
 Beat off the gunners deep, 
 Wet nuts and waves and gaze 
 Of outside tin air; 
 The shell of bells infinite.
