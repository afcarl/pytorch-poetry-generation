Soft 1941, Alas, 

 It is a common ghost ichor 
 Vallie, to rumpled fire crossing the ground. 
 As we walk up with both the tucked bones, 
 Toward and linen safe among and shut it 
 As they ride the on sun, or out to seas! 
 The day-shapes of turtles. 
 
 With scornful eyes and strings, 
 Thoughts we wake up in heat and darkness. 
 He would have left the others. It's hard to love, 
 And for a moment, something of living.
