Directing Spring Is Out So Few, 

 So murdered as the eye flow'd in, 
 That from his airy village, 
 The chill before His face, 
 And the resounding snake rules, 
 The kindlier of his fireside ring: 
 And having got a chance with the tide on. 
 
 He did not to the crooked gaudy dross; 
 They'd just surmised the stretch of the plank, 
 And despair, whose Stairwells confers the balding prey; 
 Which tossed from bed, till the dim weather goes sour.
