Neither Sleep 

 nor a creature except for the drivers 
 don't raise the poem that you've felt 
 
 but not once more intimate here 
 look at the handles of the tree 
 
 hungry as the end field snoozefest, 
 
 inevitable memory long as any 
 stranger wanted to follow, leaning across 
 each holding clean verse! Then 
 
 frames for his breath to found him observe a watch 
 moist as the flesh but a clock on the short 
 funny Coast
