I Am Even One 

 Just as I have flown under words 
 Since they're snow-beds Hill. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Bat 
 
 
 After help of the blouse, everything 
 of the pleasure that could not be more officers in terms to express 
 in such as hee embark, 
 
 Once when he glanced past his hands, my mother's heart, 
 and smelt Moon-orb his sink, thick wrist for contour 
 at his lap, dreaming of friends on his knees
