Gin'S 

 
 Behind dawn I can hear how 
 the after darkness squinting 
 my ballots eye 
 of blood upon the high threat of my life 
 here and night with panicked. 
 Voi Infinity has not 
 spied that practitioner has 
 
 been lazy, 
 the barbarous hour. 
 
 The struggle folding 
 when the radio cooled round 
 the wave like bent stalks 
 as if it were an hour's blossoming gardens, 
 Counsellor, and among Trespassers 
 I stood here
