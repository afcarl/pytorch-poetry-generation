Received Majesty'S 

 
 This year she lectured smells two balls of cotton flame, 
 mind the shadows rigged and armd in long voices 
 Sleight of love, and praise in progress don't want to speak. 
 Whoever never had met her gilded over fire 
 and breached for the place by so she took her wrist, 
 how the widowed reed ran to the elevator 
 where she had wet tomatoes or fallen obstinate dogs, 
 
 so she can delude food or habit for the sake
