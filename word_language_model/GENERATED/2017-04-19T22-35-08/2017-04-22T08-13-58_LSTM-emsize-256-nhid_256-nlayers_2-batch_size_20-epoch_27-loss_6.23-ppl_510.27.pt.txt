Man 

 quâ€™il had reads the catalogs, 
 tyranny of blindness and fever, 
 Nothing another's not, and all unhappy 
 With the weight only trouble. 
 
 Old appointed deaths were once. 
 Beauties of children, there in the country goes upstairs 
 On something slowly, sounding like a bewildered meal 
 For leaves of a dream of rock and strewn with boxcars shards of sunflowers. 
 For there we may think a well of our lives. Our ghost; 
 How good are we always lov'd,
