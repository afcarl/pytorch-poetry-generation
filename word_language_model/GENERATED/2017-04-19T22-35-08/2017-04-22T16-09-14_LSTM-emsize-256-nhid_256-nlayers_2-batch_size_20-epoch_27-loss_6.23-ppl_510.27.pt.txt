And As If To Be Free 

 
 To deliver libidinous man-kind, 
 Until I draw his fleshly lamp, 
 And made a morning cataract 
 To guess 0 though I dream. 
 
 My strength is shorter here when love is 
 The lesson of my eyes, and hold me, which I was pears, 
 And sweetest things until the eye be matured 
 Into the low dark sea and granite, 
 And the barriers of the creaks 
 anchor in a bedsheet that soon comes;
