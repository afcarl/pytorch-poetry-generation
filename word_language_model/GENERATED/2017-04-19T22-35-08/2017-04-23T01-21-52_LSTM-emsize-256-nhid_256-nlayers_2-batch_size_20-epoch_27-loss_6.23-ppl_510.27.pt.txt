It The Sunâ€” 

 
 Brother, Cecelia's Liberty, a heart. 
 The dead one of them is impertinent, 
 I know they rise, perhaps, the delaying, rose? 
 O the oldest frequency whose bark against them 
 Grows unduplicatable, with the freeway and the flourish 
 shattered slowly on the hill. 
 Take kind.--and and out of hall 
 when the particulars of his eyes. 
 
 And the vain things of the strong, his plumbers, panicked, 
 of safety metal, Finally echo rid 
 on seem.
