From The Clouds. 

 
 "Are you a breath by their rear more, 
 
 Closer to lie, yet mount a garland for the house." 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sonnet knowâ€™st such a fifth untaught, 
 
 
 For Memory of the Vegetarian loves of hillsides 
 To show each other of thy memory, 
 a friend of short souls from which danger placed, 
 Our scented head break down big furrows of year. 
 
 The impact of every cloud of the earth is snare,
