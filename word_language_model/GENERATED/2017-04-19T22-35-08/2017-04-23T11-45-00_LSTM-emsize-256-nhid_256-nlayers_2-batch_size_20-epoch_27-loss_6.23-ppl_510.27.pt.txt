 This bed of the sea among 
 The dead hills below. I can lead 
 the distance into their time, 
 like mirrors, but with fairy love 
 to what possible is bunkbeds, 
 when they come back 
 to her, to run straw up inside 
 like Atlantis to hold it, 
 and pull out women far or cold. 
 Nothing is only now I hear 
 the sentry born on SHAKE difficult 
 to make ambition use worse than anger 
 to do its cry
