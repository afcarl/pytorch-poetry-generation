Travail 

 
 And the repelled nest you up and down 
 
 Against the hills where all the upper regions 
 Became their ultimate jaw-hinges, 
 
 Like the Cammel, on the beach 
 Gauge summer on the bloom which is Mantle. 
 Dancing and enforced. as after sun 
 As the smooth heron rises looming above 
 Her cables ll had no obstacle 
 
 Synagogue yet to fade, abroad, moving 
 As sweet terror with your own 
 
 Of death's lover, more golden streams
