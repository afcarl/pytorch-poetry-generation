 At last the walls, wind opening 
 In the night Open flowing 
 Amid the darkness, 
 On the cool blue, 
 Where aimed with the outrun Story, 
 
 It were happiness, not a muskrat 
 Or hawk perched in the mouse; 
 With a bubbling pergola that hugs at the hills. 
 Flame with these, round mouth and eye, 
 One fit a moment's play. 
 The hares helmet and cigarettes on Armistice 
 And pests we reclaimed our memory. 
 This little ghoul-haunted form
