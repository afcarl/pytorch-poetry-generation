Lady-Flower, Saw: His Ledges Crashed 

 And savaged: and panorama, 
 The ultrahigh rake, not the inner getters of the Jeannie, 
 Walk cliff's around to steer 
 The creatures forty worlds in the street 
 Like an old-stone donkey, but could not be Algarsife, 
 
 The first of the day, where are limitless on them. 
 
 Like a harsh sea in my sleepy room 
 It has an odor for something to be coming back, 
 Not doozies the girders I go without such sort,
