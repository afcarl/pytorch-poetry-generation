Of The River, 

 Everywhere there came to the house 
 Lost in the shadow, and last glass 
 unexpectedly on either surface, 
 Blending stung to fight: 
 "Here, like wings a drove of light! 
 My boors, Candied let me go 
 down with the birds' music up 
 In circus lines, & again, 
 Motionless and I will leave them all, 
 I will know what drear-nighted life 
 Is from my own duke of secret 
 
 Forms in my apartment, usually ones.
