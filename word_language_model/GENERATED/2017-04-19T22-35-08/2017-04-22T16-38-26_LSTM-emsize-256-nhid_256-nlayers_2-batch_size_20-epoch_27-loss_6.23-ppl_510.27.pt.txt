His Class. 

 
 And it is when he on all day locked his pill 
 By day, to burn a life that year. 
 
 He has surrendered. 
 
 Desire trembling by my body 
 By ashâ€” 
 And then the circling leaf 
 takes up the stream and stones 
 I see that I push into the summer 
 ever again on the playground end 
 genie, all the last 
 Alone. Yet that cock 
 not a narrative laugh once . . .
