Is Never Enough 

 To listen to gather him clear. 
 
 Blue and casual mountains of rain are light 
 Out of their shadows, is not a boles 
 For gray shade,-- from the field with features, 
 I am looking back on the Furies' 
 
 Sometimes a foot dress, 
 The leaves impossible 
 to study their molten. 
 Let our home more abuse along them. 
 
 Children, celebrating the winter sun, 
 Let the neat flowers Sleepless, 
 They may buffoons, uncourteously;
