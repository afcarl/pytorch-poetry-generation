 
 When you were full of Caresses, 
 I heard my freight, and supper, 
 I applaud my streamlet once, 
 And align as Jove moves harvested 
 To Send out the jukebox. 
 
 I mount out, slepeth alderbest 
 I put my head aside 
 Between universes and brokenness 
 I would not resolve the room. 
 
 'O come, lift me fast from now. 
 
 If my hand-- 
 Fallen done after me, 
 Let the rocks suffice for you to roam,
