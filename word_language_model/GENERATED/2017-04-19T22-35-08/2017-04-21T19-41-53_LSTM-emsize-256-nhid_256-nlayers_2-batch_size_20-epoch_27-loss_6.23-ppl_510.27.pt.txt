Door 

 At least, like May, 
 And when the moon was crooked there. 
 The ruined trees among the trees, 
 Drew dream and marriage: 
 Out of the sky near fire it lies 
 The sleeping roads of the scented sky 
 
 Struck out against "Nice layers as 
 A flock of sewage, over 
 Four miles together reverberate; 
 I scribbled open 
 Beside this refuge I could discover 
 
 These they went to play who made me 
 
 Dead by emptiness,
