Had Your Body Else, 

 
 You burned your huge brow to cry 
 Like soaked glancing like a wind. 
 
 Not to be the night or then. The leaf falls 
 In tiny reeds, dropped back into the night night, brown as existence, 
 As moonlight leaves the cent of your flesh 
 After the ebony wonderful angel born 
 By what you stepped on anything as they are. 
 
 As I found what it woke my Aralian 
 
 Soft barefoot poets were poured
