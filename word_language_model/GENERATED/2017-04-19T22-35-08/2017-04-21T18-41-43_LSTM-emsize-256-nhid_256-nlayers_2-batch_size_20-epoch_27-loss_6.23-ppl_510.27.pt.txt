From The Laughing Terrier 

 intense: trees.. praying at the wall, 
 laced with air-- 
 All the old coup points no more, sixteen generations deep, 
 And bread gaily within lit their flight. 
 Altho' it gets as good since log thus, 
 Their stocks written in an opening, the bird Santa 
 Far off inside from reconciled near the mast. 
 
 All the eggshell bleaching journeys of the world 
 Stunned by a man born by the tide, 
 His eyes arched into perpetual purple
