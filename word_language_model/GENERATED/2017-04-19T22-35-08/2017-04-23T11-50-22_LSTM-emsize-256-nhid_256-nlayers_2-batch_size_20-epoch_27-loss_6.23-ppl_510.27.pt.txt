To The Waist Of Rain 

 All along the hill and ash the broken lamps 
 Of greater stormily, Earth's your bushels? 
 
 Small men, neither breath nor glorious blending 
 Of helpless powers. 
 But when the fields are blushing and I hear 
 The colder paths of lies in place, 
 And the swift winds bless my memory. 
 What's how vacancy, that I wait for your Thine; 
 And I sometimes feel myself buckled. 
 I search for supper in my wet shadow,
