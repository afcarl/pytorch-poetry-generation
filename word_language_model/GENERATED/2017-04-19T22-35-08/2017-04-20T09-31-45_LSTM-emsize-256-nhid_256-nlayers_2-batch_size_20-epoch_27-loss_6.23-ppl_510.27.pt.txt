Rose. 

 
 When the smoke is filled with that new canoe, 
 Each thing in its side pleasant leaf made me. 
 Windchime and silver holes licking the air; 
 But the old splendor of the singer draw them. 
 An old black hearse slithering home at the window. 
 Stepping fun a little to hold ear it down, to public stop, 
 (I want bop, and clubs and ulcers, 
 A cycle of tobacco disinthrone the Face 
 Of a pound of wine as my plaything
