Of The Choices. 

 The plane is song, it arched its rim. 
 His lamp was like a huge insect tower 
 Dragging the stocking of the frozen air, 
 An unbelievable gleaming on his tie. 
 So he reminds that poor moon dances 
 As a Ship 
 My heart is an interior foghorn. 
 Across the time below. 
 It's silence is a very very kind 
 Of infinite youth, and this shape of light 
 Across the reaches of the hill 
 That slows on
