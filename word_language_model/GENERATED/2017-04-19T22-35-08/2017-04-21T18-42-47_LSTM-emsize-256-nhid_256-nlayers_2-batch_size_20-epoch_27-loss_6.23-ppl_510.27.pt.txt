Felt That 

 I could see if I talk so. 
 
 From the picture, too, 
 And a rage people destined to sleep 
 With all these, my parents, take it to you 
 And in sudden birds save me: 
 I get used to stay in my back again 
 When garments drowned me, as I go 
 With hired incense; all 
 And by no means 
 Of the women at threat, 
 Do I need this minds for and suffer me, 
 To learn
