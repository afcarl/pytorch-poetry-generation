When The Wrinkles Were Seen 

 Not enough? I knew not what was wrought. 
 
 Too long ago, trickling kid from the flowering fields, 
 The heaving frog, like a trumpet box, the breast, 
 A sweetness fell at the top of the Ice door; 
 Until it breathed and spoke 
 That in the night of year, 
 It hides again thy name again 
 
 Then took the last grace music waves, 
 And deep light cut on the air, 
 And then the black
