To Take So Much. 

 
 I am the message. How can I say it, is all my love. 
 
 The man of the Apocalypse at their insensible Table 
 Shower 
 Sees one last time that brought you night 
 For hours and long. What's too buried to write, 
 Sit there on my stiff steps and teach me how 
 It was but the same night. And it rolled above the trees 
 Like an old crone over fire and moon 
 Between the tufts
