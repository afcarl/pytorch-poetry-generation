Youth To Save. 

 
 There he loves me tune somber, 
 Too many hours to eat in place. 
 Some acts of country, my dear friends 
 Is Done in full yard for Swain, 
 And stuff she needs as those to me, 
 Life being not either, nor spare to me, 
 And in some style: none of foreign love? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Unchallengeable--of 
 
 
 Some kisses at far and separate door; 
 But still they lie, they stand down;
