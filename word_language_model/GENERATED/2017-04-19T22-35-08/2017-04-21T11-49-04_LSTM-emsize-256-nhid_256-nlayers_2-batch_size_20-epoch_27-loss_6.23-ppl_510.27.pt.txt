Shrouded Causes Mask 

 trundle the heavy anodized brilliant tail 
 Of the market said to Sustain 
 The birds at hull; were passed back. 
 If what's fighting for. What also did it? 
 Naked on earth are riot pulse of sleep 
 Make no ending. Say us from our eye 
 Is an nature down? Yes such a lot will be-- 
 You shall speak today. You are fighting the pain 
 So loving when no man for slumbering yet 
 Of glory, song.
