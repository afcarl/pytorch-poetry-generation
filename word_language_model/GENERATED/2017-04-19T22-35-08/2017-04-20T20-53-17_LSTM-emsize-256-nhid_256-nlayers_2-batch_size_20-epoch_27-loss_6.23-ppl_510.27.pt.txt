 From which I was fighting into my spirit 
 I would not endure even by my prose 
 Or have been 
 Just doing now the other young words 
 fortunately and tickled from the stage of the night 
 And a roaring frightened by nimble flower 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Fairies Shrine 
 
 
 is going to run over my grave but the train 
 Women tell your stories about that living, 
 
 eating reason that made flowing pilot,
