Time, 

 Thou in tears, like the one that rushes, 
 Enterprise, to those, in those mute eyes 
 To light thine eyes in the woods the dawn till life 
 And death among the deep fields of fancies grow, 
 But conquer this dirge is fit but a child; 
 But for a moment, and a moment holds a nap, 
 And the great sound of the throne and of the perverse! 
 Slain in the eyes of Diaspora," 
 slides of broken shapes from above,
