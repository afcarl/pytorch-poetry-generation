Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo! 

 But here 
 I spend two years of winter 
 to the living 
 and we can't find it rather 
 than innocence, that just the same. 
 
 clay-sucked all, all goes on in the fog. 
 I command as the driver, the tongue of sounds 
 we mistook on our distance to arrive. 
 We live in the clumsy hours with the long red news 
 left here for dreams, tomorrow our past darn dream: 
 nor what are you saying to know about
