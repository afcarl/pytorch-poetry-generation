On You The One 

 
 In this lyre; and when you bring 
 May the ticking, and beginning can name 
 Think of yourself when it grows green. 
 
 
 
 
 
 retreats, 
 
 
 Today a rain color-chart 
 wide-yawning gathering on the dress 
 
 you are whose mad dreams 
 are turning into stars with a pale wet night 
 of your thighs 
 or, 
 
 Brothers and armies of cells 
 of tawny tongues streaming on your knees
