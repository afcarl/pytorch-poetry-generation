It Is No Style 

 
 Than that it is beautiful travel 
 warned if it should again be love 
 It doesn't matter, but, neither is enough. 
 Time, very insatiate music 
 niggerblack meters . . . Not to long or are to rest 
 
 When a sundown would be paid 
 To shape the faith of a living. 
 Such a touch calm but enough, spendings, 
 Not like your spirit a value can saw. 
 
 
 
 Farewell, thou with his heart
