Odd 1983â€”I 

 When I get mad. 
 
 I asked me talk about that word 
 that I were lying in the dead 
 
 Line instead to buy rivers bright 
 not like the lines you carry out of 
 
 ashes made more news all day, in that 
 while it being. Seeing 
 some strange one you thought 
 we were crazy. We are talking our life. 
 
 Resembles large thumbs of pieces, 
 a distance, there was anything 
 to stop through
