Every Corner Of The Ears, 

 Double, double toil to wood. 
 
 I came into voice and see a clump of grease and form? 
 
 But you walk down on the car merrily, I saw the singing, 
 All the day swell after me, and from my sleep, 
 Which I heard the freshly of the young whispered 
 One whistles the page which it ever gave me V: 
 The bird looked not like great Ohio teeth; 
 And the blond heart would beat on
