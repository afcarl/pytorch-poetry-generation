 No harm! Now eternity tastes the dead 
 Gathering mark to his inward chatter 
 Or the marble of the light 
 
 He said; "I stop too warm 
 With Beauty's A.M. land." 
 
 Delight he hairs. . . . 
 In the distance of the five, 
 I cannot see the Fly 
 Before the soul is trumpet, Lena 
 Believe, hung by the Servants 
 The hairy only flowers men fiercely 
 Eyes kangaroo, 'Twere all wise 
 They have been popsicle
