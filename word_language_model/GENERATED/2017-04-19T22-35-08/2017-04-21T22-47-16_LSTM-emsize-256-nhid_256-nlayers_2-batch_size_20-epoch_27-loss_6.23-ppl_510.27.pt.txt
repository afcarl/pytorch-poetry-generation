Fruitbearing Glass; 

 Io's, with Light, 
 Th' Lute of boxcar oak. 
 But no straight one could believe the flow'r 
 To love our stroke; even as the years 
 trumpeting the pyre, the quiet smiles 
 Of sleeping paths in those fallen fields 
 Or the veritable forest of the dead life; 
 Without the union at ourselves 
 Pomegranate and rank and senseless 
 Wash the passions of the style of woe, 
 Whom the diagonal and the midnight embers 
 Comes like a child.
