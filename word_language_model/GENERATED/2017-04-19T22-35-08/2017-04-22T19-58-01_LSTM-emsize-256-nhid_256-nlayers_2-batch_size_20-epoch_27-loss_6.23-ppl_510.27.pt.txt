 The lineaments of arms, 
 scealc to the watery rose 
 And forms to tremble, Orbs 
 To Paris sing, then do not live. 
 
 Or not above the body. 
 What to that understand. 
 However, we return to nothing, 
 coloring up and harmless 
 
 from win. 
 
 It is right head to the ground, 
 behind! 
 
 
 
 Tonight what aboute you room fatigue 
 everything to suffer me from the ends, 
 and beat you till you crawl
