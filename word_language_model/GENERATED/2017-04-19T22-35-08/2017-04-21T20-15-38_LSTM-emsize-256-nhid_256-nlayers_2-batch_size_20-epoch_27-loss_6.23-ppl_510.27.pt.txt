 There are enough for the rise of it 
 You tells me let them hang away true 
 Without my mind's tents. Will I run over where I once read 
 This night I watched a gleaming lurid lightwell-- 
 praise, all reason they are. 
 Down where of me there I light 
 All this has one year, 
 They have little help. Not 
 Will be content to save in me, 
 Even as I answer chase to love? 
 
 And did it stop
