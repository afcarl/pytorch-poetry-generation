His Wife 

 
 Or woe. A cry for the broken farmer. 
 What else is that his real body calls possession: 
 The woman is killed, but he thinks our believer 
 
 In such a country he ends the song his girl! 
 The coward longest only to make him water, 
 And he has come to wrap this small ground, 
 With never a knife from which he is recordsâ€”Bessie, lies 
 In top of his lagging foot. 
 
 For he will come, even
