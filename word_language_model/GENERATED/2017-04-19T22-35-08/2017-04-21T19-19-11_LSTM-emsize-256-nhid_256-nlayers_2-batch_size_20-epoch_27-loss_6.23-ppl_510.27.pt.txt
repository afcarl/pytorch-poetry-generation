To The Keys. 

 
 
 
 
 
 Fog 
 
 
 For several hundred and two dead days, and wrathfully 
 Inside my sad sociation of brown 
 Think that you deem no quarrel of. 
 At the corner the dubious rebuff 
 Remembered in their tongues. The keepin't fell, 
 Where the young ones who see the bats plunge our cheeks, 
 tasted; on the pale provinces 
 Of hunted persons, and dull men and towers, 
 Bright animals, and nets, and in quaking,
