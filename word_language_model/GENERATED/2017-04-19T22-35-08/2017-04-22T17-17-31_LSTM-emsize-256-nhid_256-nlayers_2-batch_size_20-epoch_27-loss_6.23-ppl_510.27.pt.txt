Halo 

 In the speeding double every prayer. 
 
 
 Alack Alas loathe to die birth-moment 
 
 how you cut the expanse into mud 
 when nothing wants getting to keep by it now 
 to have a kind of kind of lapis being habits. 
 And when you learned the mind in you 
 and you have to learn the taste made of thought 
 it. You are too high to see, 
 goodbye. I see you over stock-still, 
 those folks tell me you
