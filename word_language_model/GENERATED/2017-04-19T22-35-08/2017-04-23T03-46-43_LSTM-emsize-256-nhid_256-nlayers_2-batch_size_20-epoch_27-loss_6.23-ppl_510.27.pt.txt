Somewhere. 

 Next, shooting it stand, on a island where 
 A chopper looked at by us sweat. 
 Our eyes two hung up from the upper waves, 
 Heavily our salt, then the glimpse of one 
 possibilities with strangest and curls, except that it did 
 Where crawl: Perhaps, with lush & circling We think 
 If we have seen pear winter winter past, 
 The living impersonal to the point of air. 
 
 
 And tell me whether all my flowers, it is lost.
