Recording, Wings 

 
 fission squeezed small ward 
 
 a narrow black shape 
 
 of green fires down. 
 Some wet animal year 
 none might have loved 
 hidden enough 
 to stand talking moon 
 like crackling fields, 
 and holding a sparking tent, 
 
 as fire cries its air 
 in our lens 
 between us, 
 waiting, 
 as a flower by leaf 
 
 six o'clock birds, flame 
 in the empty blue 
 of the year the pond
