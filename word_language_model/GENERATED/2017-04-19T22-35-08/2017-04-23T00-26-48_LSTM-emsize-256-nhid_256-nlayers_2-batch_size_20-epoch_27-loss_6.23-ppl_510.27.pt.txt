Of These Things, 

 Carries the heights, and then, 
 Sum after example, noise, 
 Out of Galilee; over the depth of the dead. 
 
 This is the night we left we finally know 
 we are deaf and here: the bodies 
 
 are the greatest crinoline, 
 we bury them. The rope with the thickets 
 with a single crews eat white. 
 
 They need me like a boat that's open. 
 Or through these rooms firm, mind, dial-hand, 
 camera or oil empty
