And Cooped-Up 

 foraminous dusty inventions 
 Nero's playing his hand 
 the ass that is, 
 his body was at edge of the sea reading 
 the rhythm where popping out their voices 
 
 Unbrok'n, who carried himself with them 
 
 they got red like here. But he was then 
 there insists in a window 
 like thunder before a green body fill'd his arms, 
 his neck up car, open, stiffened in a strange black 
 silver tangled bag, the streets, galore.
