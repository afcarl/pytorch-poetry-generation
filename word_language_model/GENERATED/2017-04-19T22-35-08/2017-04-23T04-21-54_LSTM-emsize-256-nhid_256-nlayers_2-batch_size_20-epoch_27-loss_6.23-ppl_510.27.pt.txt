 My father in it is known 
 Going home in me to my 
 And take me there? 
 And my name must go into my day, though I was

 and what have I see, 
 Is that my God was alive and that the land sprang like 
 an angel over his throat, its diffuse calligraphy 
 I remember it, a dozen of incandescently, 
 syllables that threw they borrow it,
