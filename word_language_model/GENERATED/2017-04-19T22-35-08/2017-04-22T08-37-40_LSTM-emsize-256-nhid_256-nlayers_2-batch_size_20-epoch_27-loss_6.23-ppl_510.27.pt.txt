More Good, 

 
 Perhaps things have all been done as their forebears part, 
 Drinking shuffle and joys, yet sometimes the sun, 
 
 Leaving the eye meaning in when they're near. 
 
 A lover's right I said not nothing, in fact, the song 
 I keep now with it, but maternal 
 
 I wear, whose greed is lately emotions priest, 
 Neither to the frozen forms hesitate 
 Mirrors with no heaven of scorpions. 
 My love, that they should hold upon the tears,
