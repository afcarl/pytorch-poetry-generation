The Castle Orbs 

 Are taken off by thinning explosions. 
 The moon prolonged all blank cheeks, 
 A seething tide of thought wakes. 
 A temperate pulp and a malted 
 That plunged below the starry field, 
 The semi-circle learn'd was heard 
 The sound of memory born, 
 Nameless rescued in the way; 
 
 Upon the vacant ground by stone, 
 A Half violet weed sails, 
 The river made at last 
 A parting set of fog and shroud, 
 Flashed quietly in
