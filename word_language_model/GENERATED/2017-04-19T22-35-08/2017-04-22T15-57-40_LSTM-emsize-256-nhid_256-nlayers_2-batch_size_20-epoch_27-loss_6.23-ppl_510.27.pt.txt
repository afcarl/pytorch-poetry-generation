 Such a spot. . . 
 
 Youth rearranged the other dreams with ninety years. 
 
 Tonight he talked about the welcoming world. 
 And everybody looked at me 
 As though hands could be allow'd, at the letters. 
 
 I would look down and find my way to sea. 
 
 Won't not be 
 able to play my Daughter 
 Of common help well this death 
 
 Said she carries no eyes on
