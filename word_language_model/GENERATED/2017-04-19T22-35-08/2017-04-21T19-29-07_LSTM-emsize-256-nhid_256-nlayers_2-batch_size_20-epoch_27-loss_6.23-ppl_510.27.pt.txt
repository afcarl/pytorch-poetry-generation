To Find The Plain Things -- 

 
 Walt self, a few switches of mourning officers 
 to mirror salt. 
 Mountains drink the road flowing seriously, 
 like glass cats in other promises 
 that race perspectives of Judge? form of squirming twigs 
 
 now shaved in non. warfare and phone. 
 
 Trees must never notice him, young afraid. 
 
 Once, finally they held me to leave the others. 
 They pushed me from a tree. 
 
 I thought I was tired.
