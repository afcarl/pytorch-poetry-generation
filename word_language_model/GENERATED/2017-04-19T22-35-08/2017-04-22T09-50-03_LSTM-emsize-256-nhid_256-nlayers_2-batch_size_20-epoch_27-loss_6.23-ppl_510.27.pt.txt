 But the boredom of his heart 
 began to bear him down from stone 
 eggshell begins to try to strain 
 Mid Quaintest, aisles to rhythmic disgrace, 
 Or vaguely stare till into death. 
 
 
 
 
 
 My Foreign Poem 
 From

 I was sweating & plashy as a blessing, 
 Death called pure Death. 
 And property, that first night 
 He took the parka to him, pay 
 The change for men
