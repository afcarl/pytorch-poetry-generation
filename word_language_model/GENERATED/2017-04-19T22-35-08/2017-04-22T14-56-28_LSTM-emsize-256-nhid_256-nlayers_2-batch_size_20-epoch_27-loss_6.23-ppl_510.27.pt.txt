My Love, 

 Feel the hard oblivion which 
 serves that profit 
 
 Age rising from all the earth 
 
 With almost salutations and kisses 
 
 criait, and vice; not lie content, 
 
 Leaning through the night too?) its flagrant rims 
 
 As if there is some certain idea 
 
 Of some supreme season Pond, 
 
 Lest that long & visit where she must 
 
 Come away, let's take her on a loss. 
 
 
 Half lintwhites and these
