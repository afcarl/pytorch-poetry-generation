 Brother mourns; 
 And through a spiral of ink 
 The heavens cling to me, 
 
 The world the battered flaps 
 
 leodgebyrgean; my choir. I find you 
 
 Look, I hold this bitter shadow 
 Or spewing clouds in pain 
 Of weak twins 
 To sign the World hower, 
 Off upon the earth 
 I watch the world embrace. 
 
 It shakes in bed 
 
 Like streams of glass 
 Are sopping over. 
 
 Ah, when the Sands
