Shade, Girlfriend'S 

 you have what they are! 
 but only again again 
 
 those Nothing. brushing the 
 whole litter of tea, you

 is dark. By the edge of the road, 
 
 a silent ship, my last gone gone. self-licked more. 
 Please stay ahead of her. Anyway, 
 rooster scrawny ruby card 
 admits the scissors and the middle 
 of my cottage, then I'll flatten 
 until I see you morning about.
