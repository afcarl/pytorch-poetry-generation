The Year, 

 Thinking round the grave, 
 In that low living room they stood 
 Far tarnished with soft teeth again; 
 Like water out they took again; 
 And there gave down the road at fairs,

 Then, show'r, and tears turned toward matins, 
 Their feet full of the stars, the servitude; 
 Where happy longing danced their final day. 
 They are the Doctor who knew 
 Or leave the Burial 
 Anything lived to build it.
