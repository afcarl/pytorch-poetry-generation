 
 
 From painting to the forest star, 
 The Feet, and his face was white like the sound, 
 When the pruning-knife of the cicadas at last was thanks, 
 The beating actors of the great labour dodgings 
 While the victor darkness runs, so cut, 
 Could pierce the Long and aimless, Sunlit 
 I aspire, the rich. 
 The lovely clipper of the rose and the windshield of the north, 
 The infinite lane which winds fly away. 
 From the moon my roots
