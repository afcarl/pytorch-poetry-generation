 "'Tis My memory, 
 bright holes 
 leaps down against rags 
 impervious to my left and I can not stop 
 a ghost it 
 
 In the shadow of our Beach 
 May fall upon the socket

 At nightfall that is enlarging with small posies, 
 a stone reflects death, a heart far itself 
 from the socket me of this life. 
 
 But the lad knows 
 Death
