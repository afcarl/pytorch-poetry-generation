Small, Rooms, Now 

 A virgin Tittie, I mind them, 
 That none of them brought away; 
 declare: I felt a day so tender, 
 Since one of us not vowed to move before. 
 
 But whatever keeps this, plainly, this night, it seemed 
 A place of verse passing from the east 
 Its udder-lightened singing from the outer nest, 
 Crept to the chambers all those I would call, 
 And all the Necrotic haunts your thoughts in Paris 
 Thank oak new time
