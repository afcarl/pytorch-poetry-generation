Insecurity It Was True, 

 When Virtue and blood was tears. 
 No hot Sun merit condensed, the seeds of our nest, 
 And lay shepherd! for the river to occur; us, 
 We saw them sitting behind the lips, touching 
 The sands like a river that winds 
 Shaking the bones on sanguine churches to cry, 
 Lonely with pink hands, and with thick lines, and steer's 
 rootless among these, slow hearts gray and while 
 The whole world could wander on ourselves.
