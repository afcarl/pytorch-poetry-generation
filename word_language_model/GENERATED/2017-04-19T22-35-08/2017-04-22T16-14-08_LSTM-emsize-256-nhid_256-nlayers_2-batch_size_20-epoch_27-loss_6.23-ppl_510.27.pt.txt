 And seeming to visit the novels, 
 Forgetting the escape of commands, 
 ask--ask-- oak-tree's honesties, sel' 
 The nuptial doors of BE Switch 
 Our ceremonies jump in pink poynt; 
 The laughter; minstrel flesh, the god 
 jarred the rose up, shaking its hands. 
 
 The milkâ€™s trees that shook the dock, 
 The sudden ship fell up to every blue tree. 
 And the Pitholeon offered his neck, 
 And his step is bubbling and serried; 
 Dull both unnumerable and Libyan tread.
