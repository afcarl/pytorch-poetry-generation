Our Eyes 

 With their freight, fresh outjuggles burning, grace 
 And finding all the war with contours, with offices 
 What even one doth, as the last moment comes winter, 
 John pulls up but that; the poor elusive blood! 
 The gutter. God's eye is sucked with rugs, 
 Canicule Naomi,'--stiff, in a sheet. 
 
 
 
 journeying, fifty Pound diverged here, 
 I, exact I place since I and you gone dead. 
 
 And tries for, and alloy, and it means waist-high
