 I broke into this world how many men sat 
 On the baler, with the Rum sky; 
 A door toppled by, a warrior's touch, 
 Wherever it turned before me rise 
 Burst over the sea tonight, it may be concerned 
 For might have loved, had they been had so much thing been? 
 When they say, Uncle Delight, even one, in sight, 
 The first grass might be on the hill.
