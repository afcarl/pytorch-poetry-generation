 By you the dreaded rush of the crested midnight, 
 Wasn't nothing to close your eyes or go to 
 nuance, But still I find the best 
 seedpods bastard, we will look box to 
 Fall up not here. You're saying you've go! 
 
 
 
 
 
 survey'd, and I 
 
 
 I. odds from gone 
 and the day and the car 
 salts salt marks 
 
 a lurid spent! across Past, 
 a crumpled Procession 
 of the swaddled chin
