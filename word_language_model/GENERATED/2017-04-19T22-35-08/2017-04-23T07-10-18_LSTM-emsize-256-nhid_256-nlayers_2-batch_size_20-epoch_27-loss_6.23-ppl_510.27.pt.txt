It Will Be Fainting & Collapses, 

 Both go set on the head! 
 The perfect is that flesh too. 
 
 
 
 But yet, I've grown 
 enough 
 to get now 
 Just bracelet of Headless 
 
 words! 
 The fires of Africa 
 From the horses; 
 second Althea, on 
 My mind 
 With a lips 
 In a dream 
 
 a world made 
 
 Drives its white tongue 
 With new 
 Stars 
 Backward branches_... 
 And you
