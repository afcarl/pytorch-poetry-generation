 For the quiet o'clock 
 Of the compost fields, 
 On the windy eagle track.

 The age for a season was coming. 
 
 --And now god is home in Tappington judas, 
 To see about the ruins 
 Of the imagination, under a gnatlike 
 The invention of the innermost full of the soul. 
 
 Dead Walt, he commit closed the door away. 
 But the rod had a note: 
 No one has her daughter all: 
 She buried it
