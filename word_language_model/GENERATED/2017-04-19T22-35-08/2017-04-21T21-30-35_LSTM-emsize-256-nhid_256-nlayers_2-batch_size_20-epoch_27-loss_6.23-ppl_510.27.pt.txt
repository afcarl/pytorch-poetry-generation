Friends The Same, 

 Bind you, and do the slain peasants' meetings told, 
 Even one fixed grave where time has turned 
 And that all afternoon by day were sleepless 
 In that retrograded, 
 If at last it would be seen, 
 feeders, through all its Derbyshire 
 If any part I might live or write 
 Something other than not incomprehension 
 
 Yet, as in that war, thus Time shall stray 
 Freeze in the inhuman mood, 
 Full and strong song, 
 Go
