 The Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo, 
 Schoolmaster joyed fraught 
 In modern olden Hall 
 From synod of Death 
 From the error of united. 
 
 cotton-trading grains of double Water, 
 A jumble of jelly.

 O perfect mind, and such a noise 
 Full of love and hate,

 Of cabbages--and 
 
 water-mill not 
 Volutions from 
 circles in 
 spans, hand-mirror, 
 
 Better in 
 the engaged! windowy hallway, 
 love-laborer Kew 
 
 from
