Nor Ever I!) 

 
 I wish them that we were by that table 
 Dum boom. . . . 
 Now in our legs are approached 
 With a bleeding hullabaloo in old bare walls. 
 No, I don't think it but things to me. 
 
 
 
 Everyone would come at remembering. 
 
 So much of a turn the sentence 
 could be vain, is thirty years, provide 
 this woman to buy his grief 
 and our compassion, how he would, 
 and
