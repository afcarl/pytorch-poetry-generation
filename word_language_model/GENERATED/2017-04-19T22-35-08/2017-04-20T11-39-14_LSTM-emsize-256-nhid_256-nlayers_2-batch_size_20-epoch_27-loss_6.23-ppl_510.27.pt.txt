Into Garage'S Ce Schools 

 in pictures erect, 
 Against each cage, in stupor identical leap, 
 
 And the former gentleman all about the Name 
 Of cities invariably seem put on a plate in the tail, 
 They couldn't go easily at the late hour before, 
 pupate to die, 
 But never wholly contain it, their mouths come on. 
 I'd have to get our daughter there. They are occupied 
 like one who says that their nest is quite a kind 
 of machine.
