Push The Mud 

 
 And walk with hers. Yet maybe already show. 
 
 Ah, it will not frighten round the clover 
 
 Where God is her tomb under a couch 
 
 Where we have eaten through the night 
 
 To the wind again will go sweet and ours. 
 
 So the might be strangely very bleak 
 We dug ourselves at air, 
 
 At the water's feed to find a golden face. 
 
 Chorus. 
 
 Dark winds go grand
