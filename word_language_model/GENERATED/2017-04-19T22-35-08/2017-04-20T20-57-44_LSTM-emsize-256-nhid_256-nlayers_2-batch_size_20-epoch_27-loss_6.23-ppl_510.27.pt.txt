Then 

 And bade friends as master and lie out 
 Born like a single worm. 
 
 
 
 I love thee for a moment 
 it's just a Moth with subdominant Rican cousin, 
 imagining poosh muscle, in language, Madison Boy 
 up every cowardice ridge on night. 
 A loaf. a puppy a stockracks 
 tossed clattering in ofhis vertebrae 
 floor pointed at a summer's piece, his gun 
 ripened in a hacking puddle 
 dispersed & sawed into the woodpile, 
 America.
