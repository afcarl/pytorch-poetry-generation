 Savage, shoot the flower which weeps that assembly 
 When we get again here 
 In a room of life that's cast 
 A hold of paradise 
 We made each other's noise 
 So deep on the flood. 
 
 Would they be forgotten from their guns. 
 For by the burning grounds we say 
 What we did, you fought about us, 
 If we were forgotten weary and bending 
 the streets of our liquidity. 
 the rapture attend us everywhere 
 in this
