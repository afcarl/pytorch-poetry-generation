To Praise Me. 

 
 Trust be all I have seen 
 That you stand early, -- 
 I cannot answer, but you take 
 Your proper host, in your gay shoe, 
 You shall seek you to hating, 
 And chase everything, subconscious 
 Time in love and ee-chu, 
 I keep your pilgrimage and (though 
 You've still loved you also, 
 
 All your cradle, you have close, 
 gefremman at me, the drunk 
 The aboriginal ass 
 That never more might know
