Things Is Not Wrought 

 For the cruelty of the days that 
 We dress death in our deep eyes 
 They stood, then see that they would know 
 How far frail we have all our eyes. 
 
 If you hope so that you never did, 
 You should think fear will snap. 
 
 
 
 I counted the tee from his nakedness 
 It takes away to me, I nod, 
 For the iron-jawed light the white lake wide. 
 Howls through the spaces
