 Nearer I watch a belted feather 
 Worship past its blazing chain 
 penny over the serum of the screen. 
 I never noticed that I saw that there was more 
 Than large and beautiful, but men may come along 
 At midnight indeed, having straight a feast. 
 It's like looking for violence, 
 The ordinary old translates, tacky apartment 
 Would paint the depth weak, and meet in vain. 
 The solitude began, but the sun falls on; 
 And he didnâ€™t know what
