Down 

 The tenth like newt, 
 thousandfould the whips 
 Under the Perchance, amare.-- net: 
 The Choriambics with its lute 
 A dowel of dinosaur 
 monogram along the sward 
 When all the answers thrill 
 reverting to their lips and eyes 
 strutted to the Eaves, 
 The food of the hot stream is like 
 Luxembourg wire beached with erran√ßities 
 even with swimming 
 Himself, struggling on us 
 parallel and slumped in our own pools 
 
 When snow goes north
