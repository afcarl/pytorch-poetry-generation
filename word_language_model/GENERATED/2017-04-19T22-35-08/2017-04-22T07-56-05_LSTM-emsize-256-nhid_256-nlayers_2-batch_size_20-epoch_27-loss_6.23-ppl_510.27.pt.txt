 I could see that the bay waves mimic 
 In the reeds by the shadowy spray, 
 And the waves were in Fortune's arms. 
 Next to the end, that seems crucial 
 To support only one touch of others. 
 
 They have gone ready again. 
 From those long plantations without you 
 They remain together, like the jeeps. 
 
 Green flags were clogged with a raw, green 
 & white fruit 
 That Tyrone swallowtail 
 And their fellow picks in the public
