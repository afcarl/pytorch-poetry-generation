Life! 

 What life on storm o storms we are-- 
 And their tongues more and more may be writ 
 Ever with an overcast speed 
 To relate a strangling tear. 
 
 
 
 What we have snapped up, when daylight comes 
 At one that does or sigh 
 Like a big paper gleam, 
 Is that sun flutter'd 
 In the middle of the world. 
 
 Out of the green light, All out 
 On to where lies the fall, 
 And marble
