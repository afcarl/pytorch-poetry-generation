For Him This To Me, 

 
 No reward who knows, no more he's value. 
 Let them send me to my soul, 
 I will forgive him, what I shall be fleeing. 
 
 
 Home, comes to an old age, 
 
 Longing I keep, 
 This gentle beauty of my heart, 
 
 Deeper and pleasant, its type of days 
 destitute of the unfathomable past, 
 I would cease and go. 
 
 
 Your night is seen by the ruptured night sun
