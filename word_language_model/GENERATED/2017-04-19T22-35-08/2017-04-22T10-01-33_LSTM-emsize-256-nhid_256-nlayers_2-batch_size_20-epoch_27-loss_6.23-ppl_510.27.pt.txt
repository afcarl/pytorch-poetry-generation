Kin Must Love His Son! 

 
 Forgive me that the old birds creep 
 Burns unforgettable, the brain of the blotched, 
 Her study is between. 
 
 Close later the springing sky 
 On whose eclipse, bare tiers 
 Uncertain and sea. 
 But more the proud sisters seem 
 For singing beauty, are the stitching 
 Of boys, and Oppressive and untroubled, framed 
 With pleasant stalk, too late! 
 How often makes her poor radiance, 
 Rapt in the morning of the riches years,
