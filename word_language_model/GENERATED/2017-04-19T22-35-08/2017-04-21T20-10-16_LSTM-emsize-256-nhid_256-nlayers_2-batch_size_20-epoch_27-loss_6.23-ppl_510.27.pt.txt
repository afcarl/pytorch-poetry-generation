 
 Those days to the Crossing 
 The Atlantic John, a palace fine 
 grumble; the Hudson's tracks? 
 
 Now once, Note and poised at his lone head, 
 The quivering tenderness from the graves? 
 
 The sky has drained his fist into my bed 
 Apparelled in moonlight on the innocent sea; 
 Its radiant face riffled by the stage. 
 
 VI 
 Up when the pines have raised the air 
 Like light upon a door. 
 
 In dark clear air
