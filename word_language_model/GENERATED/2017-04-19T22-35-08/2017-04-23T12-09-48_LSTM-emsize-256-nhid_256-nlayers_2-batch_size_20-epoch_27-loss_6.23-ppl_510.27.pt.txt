Of Others 

 You mark it in the shade 
 That has made time, 
 That write, -- keeper rides. 
 
 The horde of a newborn child is sneering 
 And the tiny population of ocean, 
 The leaning sea's hands on his hands 
 He looks down from dead and dead. 
 Five little girls who have carved us, 
 And calling their money at kingdom--or 
 Toil when lazily calmly churned 
 A bloody acumen each more bealuwa 
 quiet or eight
