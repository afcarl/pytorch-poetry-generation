His Father'S Things! 

 
 Are they done; but I am the Colour-Sergeant said, 
 And walked like children on brothel, 
 Wise as such, so Panofskv all away 
 When the vase shall be. 
 
 
 
 The fern lets me travel 
 for an axe & the seat 
 and secret. Each fused 
 
 light rises your smile through my lap 
 no longer bayonet: leaves 
 
 the manatee can breathe in your whole kitchen. 
 This brass girl goes with her
