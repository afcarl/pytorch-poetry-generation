Light And Themes 

 
 Remember how the sky came down, 
 So among them and a few things, 
 
 Standing like the other side 
 Of a twenty-story view. 
 Daily was on you in a corner of a house 
 
 There fled, the world is gone 
 And a heart grown feet 
 On a side of the sea. 
 
 
 
 
 
 A snawie-bosom Of Persistence 
 
 
 ubiquity passionate, fowl, too, vision 
 Abramowitz and milky gaps on flight,
