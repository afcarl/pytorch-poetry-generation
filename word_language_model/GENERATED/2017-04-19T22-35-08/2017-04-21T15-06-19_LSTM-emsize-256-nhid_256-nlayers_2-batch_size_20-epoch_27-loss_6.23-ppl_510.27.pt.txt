 With a glassy Warrior-Angel roaming 
 Drawn into motionless bars 
 That a loud engine, a toy hundred years 
 Left out beneath the grime, 
 Through the thin twanging that moss 
 Does not so be sent I'm still 
 And hearthstone. its overhead 
 burston. And tiny 
 Topped tongues 
 Of transformation Monteagle, 
 Predicts my father's joy.
