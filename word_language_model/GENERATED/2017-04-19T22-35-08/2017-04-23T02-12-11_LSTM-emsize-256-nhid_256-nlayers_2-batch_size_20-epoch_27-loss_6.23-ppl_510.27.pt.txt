 I stepped together 
 On a false, 
 and powowing now: 
 Broken the 
 keen-eyed 
 offering 
 you to approach, 
 my children shaped 
 onto your young chest, 
 that same your sky 
 never finally 
 remember show 
 out any plain 
 brightly no echo 
 no window 
 
 no bitter need 
 no what-have-I-to-do-today-list 
 no mote you 
 yourself don't ask me 
 the dime-sized tudes: 
 "Let yourself rue you 
 let's eat 
 unless your enemy
