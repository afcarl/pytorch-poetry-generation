Up Shivering 

 And we'll remain wedged away at sunset 
 Among the utmost and plump of crying by the 
 Pass, 
 He won't identify. 
 For, like is it turning again 
 With a heel of gold and gloom, and look 
 Pleasure to serve us does 
 A minute that may come 
 Of dying and its Paul's century 
 So long ago 
 In tracking that echo, 
 Falling now 
 Within the flashing of the corn obit.

 The grandmothers
