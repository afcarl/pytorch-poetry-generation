Iron, 

 Standing behind their hands and beard, & roar 
 Out of their forests with two halves 
 Of softened fugitive hair. 
 Death of fierce liquids each unspoken a lay: 
 All past them and the next thing they shall never tire, 
 As even did it not? 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Animal Lady and the Sultan 
 
 
 The great mare fled, as it blasts beneath 
 selects the sun shed upwards o'er the ground. 
 They dare not wring up
