 R.W. Chamber of you 
 I think you may be waiting for you alone. 
 
 Wears a body yellow inside me. 
 
 The sky is light paved with dog 
 I turn the actors’ spires, 
 the living 
 fairies in the tunnel, 
 under the smell of red 
 certain tree all scorched 
 limpid bones clown. 
 
 Whate’er the ice 
 bay slips 
 upon café wing, 
 pink clouds, yellow, splinters 
 
 as if someone were still 
 replaced up
