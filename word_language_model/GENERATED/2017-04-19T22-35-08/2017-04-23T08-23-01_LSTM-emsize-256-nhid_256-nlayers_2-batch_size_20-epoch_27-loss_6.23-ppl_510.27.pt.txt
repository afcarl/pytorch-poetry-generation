 Be the vote of neither any nor one that no one knows 
 can soon find America in himself, a pleasure

 on its eyelids. 
 I can say something, whatever

 This is a poem about Virginia 
 Hello, you're fewmets of the flint, who is 
 The stairway that pretend to spend that time 
 On ordinary Island talk to God
