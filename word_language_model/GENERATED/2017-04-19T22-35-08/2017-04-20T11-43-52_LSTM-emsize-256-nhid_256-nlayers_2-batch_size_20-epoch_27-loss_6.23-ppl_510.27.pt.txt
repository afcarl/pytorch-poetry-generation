 But how can we stand on 
 The dolphin's bridge in weeds 
 And withered on the snowy stir 
 Of proud organ sunshine, 
 Theirs what it is for us that does 
 But come to heart and platter. 
 
 The heart was clear and steady 
 That he was hungry, Redhead 
 It had to make beauty back or suffer 
 To bear away the Medici, 
 Put up the ignition all that sister, 
 The more of it, despite you heard.
