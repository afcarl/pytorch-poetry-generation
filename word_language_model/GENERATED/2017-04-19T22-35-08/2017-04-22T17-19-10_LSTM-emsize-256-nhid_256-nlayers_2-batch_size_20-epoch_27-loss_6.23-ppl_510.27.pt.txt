To Crowd Of, 

 oh, slowly, Comin in the rain, 
 And marching down and scooped the fall. 
 pour, they drum Mercantilists' and avalanching together, 
 Manderley the old Antaean plume, 
 And their cloudy masters, clamped to market 
 breast-mail, islands with that gray breath of 
 Rich traps: tiny day of ice 
 Wherever precise as truth -- swinging its crown 
 I measure my heart. 
 
 
 penitents, Evidence of Paradise 
 Sundays! poor, altruism, 
 Delusions of Gonzago. Missouri, 
 Ships fleeces?
