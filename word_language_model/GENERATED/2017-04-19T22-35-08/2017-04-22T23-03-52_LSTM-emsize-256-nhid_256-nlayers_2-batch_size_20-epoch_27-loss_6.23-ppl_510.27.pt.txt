Wrapped In Tobacco, 

 against my coat eyelids out of my avenues 
 and Coningsby, werigmod through 
 the asphalt thunder of Summer you'd touch 
 in the eyes of gold waiting at the roof of insect 
 cutting the small rubber eye 
 a irrelevant tree devil persuaded 
 deeper from a dream of your touch. 
 
 And the absence of insects 
 grow there, with so much moving 
 from under an unfired Jew. 
 
 And if the ocean, ripe to its flare
