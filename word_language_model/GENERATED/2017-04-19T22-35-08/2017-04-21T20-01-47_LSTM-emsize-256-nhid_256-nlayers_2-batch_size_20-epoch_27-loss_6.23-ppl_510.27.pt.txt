Among The Breasts 

 and as the flags now watch and the dance was stripped 
 in the soft zone with the wind 
 that would fall like the Olds burning 
 but too soon much genitals then 
 carrying water in those way 
 through a sense of oil on the cool wind 
 and listening to the fact. 
 I better recognize 
 my favorite day, rescue, either. . . 
 
 This is the birth of the grass.
