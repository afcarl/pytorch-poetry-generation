 
 Arriving I speak to play, 
 To differ in this breast, 
 At a touch of its faith as fleet 
 As in a beloved's vision. 
 
 But, before shadie by the top. 
 Here they bathe and rustle away. 
 His history lamp spurts there 
 Through above. In the moaning 
 Of sun and sun, black and sweet, 
 Over the grass by pole it stand, 
 Shone on rode to hail the joy 
 Of truckers, that stranger, only since 
 Feels
