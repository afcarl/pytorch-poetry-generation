 To matter where he chariot loud 
 Light and droops the shadow of ash, that with scales 
 Left his pillows and boot, or neck.‚Äù 
 He hanged with a Vatkii light 
 He cannot eat and heaven behave 
 If to the dusky clod 
 He rose down his trellis above me 
 Where a brown old child stands dead 
 In the third things of year, 
 For on that smiling evokes 
 The Choral Saucy Im cymbals 
 
 All the terms gave shot.
