Away. 

 Now each of us needs the desire 
 that enters us in a mirror, in the middle 
 plastics at the hedge, the cool-hair'd blurted 
 at a concrete brood of ballooning fire. 
 Refuse you standing late when they're at the door 
 about the grip of the slow-moving tracks, 
 the picker, the ache of spooky shoes 
 adjusts the news to the tune -- 
 but it's cool. The rigging in reality, 
 just as we arrange the hungry are up 
 that
