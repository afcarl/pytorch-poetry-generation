 The garlands, mouth, and torso blossom; 
 And utterly older in the tear.

 scabbard said the name of a cat, studying 
 her shoulders, hissing, so strangely your pain,

 No one else saw our beautiful haircut 
 
 paused to touch your father 
 so hard in a tree, her poor body 
 
 tossed by a few dust.
