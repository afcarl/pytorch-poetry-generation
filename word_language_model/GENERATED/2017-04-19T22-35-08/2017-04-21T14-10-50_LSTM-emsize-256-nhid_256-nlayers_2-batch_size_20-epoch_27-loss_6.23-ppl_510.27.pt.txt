For Mary, To Die: 

 Said more! O Lord, 
 Youth and faith shall attain, 
 If our loves be not sought, 
 The fixed longings of the Sacred man 
 Steal to the admiring ocean unverified 
 Thou fling the feet where harms shall be plain 
 To not king or thyself egrets, telling the deuce 
 Which his shame with the contents o'er his head again. 
 
 Thumbs-down in our steamer near the rose, 
 Split gently, clasps and quiver, 
 Are the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.
