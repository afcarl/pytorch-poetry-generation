The Moonlight, Against The Old Bank, 

 His messenger, I watched the mid-swing, 
 Loved faded off, little days, 
 Summer to look at me, 
 "What's me. Tir'd for beings," 
 Expect for me, visibly 
 serious and so nightmare. 
 A yellow person who saw 
 
 the sky, Coffee feet 
 ochre and scarred and hot, 
 and I'm both led, and hear, 
 always he's marinated 
 subject to all the way I see 
 light in the drawer.
