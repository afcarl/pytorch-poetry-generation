Ruined Back 

 My house pulses through the mass of dark blue track 
 When the black bird turns 
 This small look of pearly stones, 
 Sweet creator exhausted claims in those wet rooms. 
 Now Thomas forgets to hide new names she was one night 
 Whistling estranges with us on stairs, or a sound where her own waiter's 
 told, who could close you to deeds; 
 The boy beside a painless place, 
 She would have sick. She said the house is vain,
