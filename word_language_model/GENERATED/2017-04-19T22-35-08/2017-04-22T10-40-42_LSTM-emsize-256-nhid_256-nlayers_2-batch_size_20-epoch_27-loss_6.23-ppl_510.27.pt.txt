 after him, with the black knife, lock her head 
 Under a path of wind by sand, 
 A bird, a spark upon her round the walls, 
 And nothing worth as infinity as he flew. 
 What cares to him of song, something are told 
 The diary of masses and ice, 
 And knows they are not long with pain and hope; 
 They keep the voice of him dead, and he's glad and is kindly, or in his hand.
