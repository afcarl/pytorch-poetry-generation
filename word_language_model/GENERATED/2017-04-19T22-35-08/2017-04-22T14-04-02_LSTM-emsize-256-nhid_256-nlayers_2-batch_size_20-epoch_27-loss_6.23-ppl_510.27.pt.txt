 
 What can you see, 
 And yet my body come, 
 As that in Freedom Oblivion-- 
 Should I not give them there 
 That I should discover away 
 One beautiful to us a good fair peace 
 Once long and hollow, and on, 
 All innocent is blest; 
 It is the gold of Death moms 
 Under the big russet dust, 
 And the sabbath crumble 
 Without wood or the jar. 
 
 passive: hammers air, 
 As late surprise the more--
