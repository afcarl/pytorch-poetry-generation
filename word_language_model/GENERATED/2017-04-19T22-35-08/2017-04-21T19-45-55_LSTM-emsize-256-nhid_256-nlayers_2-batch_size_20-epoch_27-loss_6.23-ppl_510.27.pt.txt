Flanks, 

 Escaped from it was only you. I just felt 
 The Western Quakers at Nickie-ben! 
 One had a secret sorry for years, 
 A virgin horse that's also penance so. 
 
 Look behind your feet, elder at those by, 
 One of them (like a foam together, two leftover whore. 
 Everything is high 
 Where the mutter and the purple blades of them, 
 Who have scrubbed. pins you in peace, 
 The language of your cold! 
 The spaces are ready,
