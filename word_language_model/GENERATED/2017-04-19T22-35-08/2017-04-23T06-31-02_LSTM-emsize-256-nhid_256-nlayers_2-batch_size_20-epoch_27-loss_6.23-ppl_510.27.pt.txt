 All this has written 'em, 
 Lets me mean, with that it pleases 
 Is it so, when once we will, 
 And feel it at midnight 
 To take her very pretty flight, 
 Because that is gone to harm. 
 
 Love with other spheres, arrested with sighs, 
 Why should the birds endure to burn, 
 Or kiss the brazen leaves, the mournful eyes 
 Of day and thunder that would grow 
 So thrive. and both before her day's curtain worketh not;
