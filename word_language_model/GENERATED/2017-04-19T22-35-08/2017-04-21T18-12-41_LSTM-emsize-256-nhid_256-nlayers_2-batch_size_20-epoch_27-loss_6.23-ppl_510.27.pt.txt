 You may meet you all! 
 
 
 
 
 
 skiey Stephen Picture 
 
 
 anger'd into a cliff, his hand holding cold corners 
 when I'm walking into a chair 
 I am a powerful man, there is some quiet idea 
 of the same sex done in the horizontal century, 
 the hagiography: 
 front at the helm unblinds 
 blot out of the pure note 
 
 in the morning, 
 the wrong thing 
 its thinning
