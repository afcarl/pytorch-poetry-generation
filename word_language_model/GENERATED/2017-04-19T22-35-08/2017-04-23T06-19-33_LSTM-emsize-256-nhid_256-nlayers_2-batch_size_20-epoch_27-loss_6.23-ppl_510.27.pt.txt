Ceas'D To Teach Me? 

 The days are in their hearts and now they are everywhere 
 
 All in bliss, and going engagements, and 
 In different solitude; they grow far 
 And get quick. The lights fed them. 
 The pains serve after everyone 
 
 And more does poetry. 
 Ten thousand others, there are one, 
 maidden, reasons of us all earthly things 
 To happen pastoral! It was nothing. 
 
 But everything seemed, in the imagination Day!
