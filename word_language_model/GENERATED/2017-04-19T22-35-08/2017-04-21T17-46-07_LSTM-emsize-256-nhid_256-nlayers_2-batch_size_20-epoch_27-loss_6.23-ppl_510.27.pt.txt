It. 

 richâ€”with a tree against the bull 
 Then hula tak'st, and away next glance and a car 
 Looked to disappear. For drive-thru 
 
 One slipping, dragged up the minarets of water; 
 The little strengthens hands continued knocking 
 To put over bad songs and nights, 
 To their fellow labour in their 
 
 Green pm hauling up the game, 
 The gay violations of incense, blazing 
 The dripping corpse drawn in the lemons... 
 
 Shipman is a Law in echo.
