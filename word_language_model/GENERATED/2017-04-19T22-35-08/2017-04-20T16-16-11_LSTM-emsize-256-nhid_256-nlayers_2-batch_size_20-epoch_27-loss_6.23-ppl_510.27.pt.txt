 It murmurs not for the world? 
 I have been looking for a long be'ind, in my legs. 
 
 Under 
 The childhood. 
 You are your shoes? I don't believe there's nothing 
 You are the same. 
 
 I am a little box, 
 And this is wry-humored fact, thaw; sheet- 
 cortisol, soul. 
 
 The Earl of science the tones that were only children. 
 Those who study saying enough. 
 
 tiger-lilies and you cannot explain here. 
 Women with jewel-bestower.
