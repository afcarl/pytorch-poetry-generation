Are As Red As Rain, 

 Give us our wavering rounds, and you shall retrace 
 The presence of the broken power and aire 
 That my love would dash languish; 
 Something cannot haven. 
 We have carried the hair to the mind, 
 Thy only sad ways that our souls do supply 
 
 . . . 
 Soul shall suffice the truth, so simple thing 
 Who will wake from hence that has seen thee 
 As always, the joyful sky; 
 Young new sisters
