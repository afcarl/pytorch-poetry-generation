It Was 

 In that great paternoster 
 Of elevated corpses 
 blender even to soul, to-day, 
 Through wingless, down a moor, 
 A limb grasses, 
 So I see 
 Astounds a lone October day 
 And firewood, then zones and Revere. 
 
 
 II 
 
 
 
 Sunlight and ranges on the fields of heaven rolls 
 stanzas, by the surveys, and the shapes of song 
 Are white with anger. 
 Their dying mouths are glde 
 Remains, we long forests,
