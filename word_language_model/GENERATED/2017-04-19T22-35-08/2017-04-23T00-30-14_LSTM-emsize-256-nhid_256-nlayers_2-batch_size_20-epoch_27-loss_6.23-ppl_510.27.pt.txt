Now 

 shady freedom, 
 Weeper of the heat, 
 
 
 
 lay before, Naw dialect 
 take her folly 
 
 
 
 A mug of gold and sycamore iron. 
 
 And though he was very much 
 
 
 by a cold form, round the stop, 
 
 a third blossom passing down. 
 
 We drain, sure as a flock, 
 
 and as the crab we can 
 
 see that he's sad. That's what someone 
 knows. That's all about
