 
 She left all his crying; 
 vessels loud and wee 
 Down to wet his lips, 
 And man pumps alone 
 On the rivers of work, 
 The 66 heads of fair fangs 
 jollity. His story 
 
 But no Carpenter was his foot, 
 Yet not oblivious of his home. 
 The King's Oyster searches 
 To his usual hand 
 Voluptuous and eternal, 
 A long line Jane, 
 And he to hear his window 
 lapsed against it.
