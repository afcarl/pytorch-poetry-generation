To My Feet, 

 This time in the privacy of America And end and not 
 whammy nor recompense the male line. I turned 
 To see myself off the thing and not fuck in its dark. 
 
 Life move across the wires and size. The Hittites 
 From the house has possessed gold-rimmd berries 
 And me bread and other bother to live. 
 I would never shout, though I never cant mistake many days, 
 Going to develop through my wrath, my pain poured over
