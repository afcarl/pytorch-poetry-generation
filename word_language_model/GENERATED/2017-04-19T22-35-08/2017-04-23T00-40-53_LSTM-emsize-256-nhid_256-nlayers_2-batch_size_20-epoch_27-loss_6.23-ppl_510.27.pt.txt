Night, 

 auburn green. 
 I'm whereso bold, Oh at that, 
 And can even be belonging. 
 
 No world will feast from hell. 
 Many a way to such a train 
 Has been meant to keep; 
 But most of them say mourn for a while, 
 And laid us down for freely by, 
 button such as unconditioned. 
 
 Women are enough at night, 
 From every cheek, in dew, 
 Or the roaring clouds O touch 
 Elders with the envious god,
