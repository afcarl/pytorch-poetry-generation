The Sky, 

 Its sweet return might be above 
 When the steven in the nape sea 
 A dozen tombstones passion 
 On a leper ridge over two chestnuts suffered 
 
 And ladies with all hours missing 
 Where the others one immersed on West 
 A living route to you so could fall on this way, read: 
 
 
 
 
 The full omen of everything is fair, 
 Brisk as the sun is full of privacies 
 On which we find the moods
