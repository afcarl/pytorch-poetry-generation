Came Dear Out Of Heart, 

 I whence you first learn to make me laugh as bad as many 
 As day after dawn & night 
 For what good have you surer pray'd, 
 You have threshed fern, strange dust where should be 
 Naked beneath the surface of the tree I am worn back 
 With 'Ware buds and boards and hands, and yelled, 
 Under your sleepwalking pink grammar, 
 hope-- my finger in your will, 
 I hold the whistle for the stars.
