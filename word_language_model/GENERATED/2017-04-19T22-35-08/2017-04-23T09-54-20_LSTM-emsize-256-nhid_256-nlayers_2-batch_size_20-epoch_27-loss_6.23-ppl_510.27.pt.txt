Shoes. 

 
 In the partsâ€” 
 retreating cave on the bare god of his iron dress 
 Sing to him back again. 
 
 The Telemachus, of pear 
 Is little bouncing on his stem, 
 Weighs in flat socks and bowers. 
 
 Sky employ'd; by night's inspired 
 ton of swamps 
 soul, where the 
 nation overcast: 
 
 pink-wedding-cake furniture 
 Of the yearlong snake, 
 
 I've made better and curious 
 With its rising water 
 run--when save the bees
