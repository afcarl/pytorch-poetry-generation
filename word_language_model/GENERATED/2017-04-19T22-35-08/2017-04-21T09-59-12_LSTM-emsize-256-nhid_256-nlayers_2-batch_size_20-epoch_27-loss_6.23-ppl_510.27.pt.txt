 No one finds me. 
 
 
 
 
 
 but Thallinos Central's centred; 
 
 
 We should sing linnet, 
 Pale hemlock shield truth she implore; 
 noblest: last ones to whose, 
 The light that roars so windowful the race. 
 Let not our hopes turn wheels sublime, 
 Nor helped the gidda effraide, 
 Grenoble through redwood Torturer; that once questions, 
 Children, the green ocean boundless away, 
 Let none her condemn, be stone, nor subtle tribes 
 Came steady; dem reeds,
