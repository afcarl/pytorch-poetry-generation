 Eight hairs of wheat and Sepulchre. 
 The king alone? Venus purple water, 
 You saw that other room, leaning up her cheeks, 
 Fast in the empty embrace of 
 those plains like luck. 
 Amid the room a broken boat 
 sparrow and a maple bed, 
 secg in a satin dress 
 screened. both statuette. They remain 
 
 unaware 
 once at last 
 perfection: youâ€™re 
 poking seedwings 
 as that they will 
 
 my tribe infinite, 
 an untidy king,
