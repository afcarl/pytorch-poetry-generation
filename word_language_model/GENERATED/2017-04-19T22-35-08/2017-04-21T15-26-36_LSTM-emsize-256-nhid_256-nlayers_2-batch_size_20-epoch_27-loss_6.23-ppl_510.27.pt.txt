Felt. 

 The year begins to disappear conceived 
 Achille under his staggering hands and two words. 
 After the light was a sonnet, for him at sight, he whirled 
 at His heart in the gutters, and always ask me I'm pacing 
 From his untimely Thinks: 
 choir water in me a glass in every angel 
 symbolism for food -- tipped up the ass 
 In an old shimmer on ag'in! Matilde, day 
 On the back heart of the garden drives off 
 god-wars
