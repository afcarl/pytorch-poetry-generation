Careful Brother, 

 
 cross-fertilization 
 
 Why all these days! 
 Language and fortitude by their has-beens, 
 The others in a city far from speckled bands. 
 
 t/ winds were with these, as I kiss 
 fly'st me, but be not 
 The man who cries like steam is cherchez 
 Suppose he loves and was not the mirror from his heav'n; 
 I didn't know the old poor loves thirst 
 As oft they always told me, 
 I won't come down to kill
