 In the old humbler world 
 You have a cup of overlook 
 Days of the outside sun 
 And out of His bottle 
 Coffee flowers 
 
 And the round bug moves it 
 As slowly turbulence 
 Into the Peak, 
 And through a rocky turbulence 
 The dim warm tide shall grow, 
 Feeling the million 
 Low lights of half-kiss. 
 Sleep must weep at the end 
 Of the boyish proteins for the Complicity 
 
 
 
 Cast-offs?--But absolutely strange.
