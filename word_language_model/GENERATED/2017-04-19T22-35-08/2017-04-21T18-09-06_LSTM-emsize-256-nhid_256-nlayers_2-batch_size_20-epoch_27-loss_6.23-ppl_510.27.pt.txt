 Because a life can hide me mine? 
 How to count the recess 
 of a body on whether you forgot. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Ghosts of sensations 
 
 
 The wrong sad South bulb excuse. 
 The crippled bride saddened 
 For a Whitman 
 even the killers reading with bored backward, 
 
 sister there 
 
 for the taut lemur's 
 cat her year swelled bones 
 when she squeezed & broken 
 into the door 
 a bridge Agatha
