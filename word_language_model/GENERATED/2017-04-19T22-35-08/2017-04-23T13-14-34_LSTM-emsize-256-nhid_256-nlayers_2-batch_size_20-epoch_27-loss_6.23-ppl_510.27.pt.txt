 
 There's some subject. 
 The passions still hov'ring flattening on spar 
 Are I tacks at the end of the other. 
 Are you the Maquokeeta, Nile. 
 
 
 
 There's a movie looking out 
 at the back of the head, 
 it floats its whole length 
 when it comes upon. Take down 
 as if the Dead chance 
 
 bring no story. 
 
 I want to be dumb 
 to be survivors of prophet 
 thinking about is sore
