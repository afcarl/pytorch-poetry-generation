 As on a window it looked with the water, 
 and their candles resting at doin', Bic the railroad 
 Tyger ashen Jews who 
 pitched up to their urgent fires. He 
 wondering whether he would be waiting to be already there. 
 
 
 blorting since rangers crack 
 
 so he looks into his toes, 
 and he kissed him in. 
 The snow attracts his car 
 from the pool of my hair 
 games of grease and his visitors 
 
 birds
