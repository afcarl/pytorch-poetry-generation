Name A Seed 

 In each other's face, 
 
 There the heat is won. 
 Deep into its immortality, it is whole 
 To last spring. 
 
 I would warm that lovely clockwork thing 
 With what falls to the phoenix tree. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Amoretti Love forward; 
 
 
 She glides them round a stray headland ; 
 His man is dead to encourage her. 
 Love is an man!" and a den, 
 A Autograph and meth-kids little Skins
