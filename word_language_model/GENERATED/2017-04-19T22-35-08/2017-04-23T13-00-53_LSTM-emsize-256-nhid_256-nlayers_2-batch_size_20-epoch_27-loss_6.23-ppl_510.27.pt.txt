Music Never Knew. 

 
 Yet don't they tell for all? 
 The great, same child of the play, 
 Which shows each other true, he said. 
 Long times that have grown fix'd, not loud, 
 Or nothing else but great birds here in years! 
 And in their friends, they from some smart policy; 
 Which breaks it out of this old shard 
 As of a snowflake with a British collar 
 And shallow wings, the hollow glowing tree 
 Shine straight to the breeze,
