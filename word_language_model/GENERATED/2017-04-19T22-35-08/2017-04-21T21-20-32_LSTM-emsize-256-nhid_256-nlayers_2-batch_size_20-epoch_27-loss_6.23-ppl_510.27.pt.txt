 Slowly destroying; a soft turning moon 
 overhead, trees pale, water rolling at 
 their branches where I am deep. 
 
 In the broad ethical version, 
 Those foxes branches shower 
 Thrice warm your clothes 
 I've forgotten an rose. 
 You know what you have done. 
 Words? This is there, mother' 
 bands: or even ever, 
 One with a wish of death 
 Whilst beauty and loneliness 
 Time is filled as a pipe 
 Made out of a moth 
 black
