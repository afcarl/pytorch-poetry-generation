Arm 

 Does not linger as a little 
 
 May I sit or on face or to 
 His knees or on Vermont 
 Not years of what I fear to do, 
 Than what room shall I spend the cur√°t, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In Epistle 
 
 
 Up in mountain by some late Mrs. hall, 
 Or blessed women from their hearts. 
 If will be something hard the final dower, 
 Yet all the things of men crossing cold,
