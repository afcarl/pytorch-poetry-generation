 A street blue, admitting 
 No one ever else's name 
 So neat and wan, 
 So still of my heart -- 
 All man, those woman's richest birds. 
 She outstretched these pieces meet? 
 She is spoiled and chilly 
 With womanly blossoms. 
 They said but what would cause 
 That I should mind than two 
 My children do roared and Effected 
 That crazed pear-tree or create 
 parties, but, mouf and death. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Merrily, Song
