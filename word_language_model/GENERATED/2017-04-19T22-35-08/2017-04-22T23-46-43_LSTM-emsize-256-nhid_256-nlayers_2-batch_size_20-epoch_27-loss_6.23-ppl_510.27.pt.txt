Two Years Ago: 

 I knew my asking to hoard 
 for fifty thousand thousand, WILL They put this place 
 To make the body nail, you eventually put it all along. 
 
 miscarriage small vermilion 
 I got on the opposite 
 male's map 
 And the marred inside you 
 
 Moving and tenderly River 
 Races and peeled away; 
 All that roils from me, 
 I measure my eyes, 
 
 And hand the streaming ball 
 From which I bear fallen
