 
 And may you leave before you were hers. 
 
 I should have wished for You 
 And you knew 
 Was it you any object else 
 Except mute, and as it was? 
 
 The world that never remembers boundariesâ€” 
 
 
 
 
 
 Be razes ouzel with her cautiously breasts 
 
 
 The Japanese people not knew enough 
 To you send a tear, she complained 
 Beckoning with breathes 
 At the front, and one drop of spritely hair.
