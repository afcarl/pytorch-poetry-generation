Shore That'S Good. 

 When the stories begin to arrive here 
 Among me. The words are but a spotless womb. 
 When things are suspiciousâ€”the Women who never pass 
 At first, when home they are, simpler and sea-almonds, 
 Like the aroma of hardened sticks from the head of the burnt screaming 
 Where the kitchen many an echo yield up 
 From the unspotted evensong of deciduous rotation 
 
 Like children take the march away 
 Rise, the little lake flies brightly hard,
