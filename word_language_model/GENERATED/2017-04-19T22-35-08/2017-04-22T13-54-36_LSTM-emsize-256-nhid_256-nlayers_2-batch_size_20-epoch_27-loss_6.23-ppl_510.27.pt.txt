Loves Shell-Box? 

 Sound pleated on the sturdy halls 
 The horse of them and the earth that limping it 
 stops. on its trail some lullaby lump of earth. 
 
 Love and a voice dropped out, mogul 
 Along the path of battle-seat memories like mindâ€”oscillate 
 That a dim guest of sparks dangling on the senseless 
 A fountaining splendour of inscriptions in our dark eyes. 
 From the estranged song of sons, stop 
 As for the Suspends the fuel, the dank streets.
