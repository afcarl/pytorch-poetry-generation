 The Spirit in me know what Omeros 
 What good with that blessing so 
 First color--clear as Orlando flits 
 often and begins with an hour 
 to take the start, -- 
 then peeled perfectly fast and gone, 
 And then I shall be thirty. 
 He was more rains than less, 
 And yet some of the days round rains. 
 All one unfeigned deed, be alternatingly 
 But if their eyes were not of wheaten law.
