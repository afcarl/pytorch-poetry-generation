I Saw 

 The black snake sung with them, 
 The scenery of so many event, I was old 
 As the second." awesome I came and raised 
 All every entrance one by other beginnings 
 Smells of colors, far off flowers on oil blue creatures 
 Passing toward solid jars like moonlight ornaments, 
 Unlike nothing, must it survive 
 All the way spinning night one day 
 A single hollow and milling at the Queen's wind, 
 As for a walk there would be on
