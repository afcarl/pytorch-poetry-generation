 
 Oh, we cannot hear on the homestead up Tumblebugs 
 Lord, let us kiss that mournful air 
 Nor rose nor prove, nor break 
 Light to the wooded pearly store, 
 Nor kiss, nor the cries of doubt, 
 Appears or sterile fallen drouth; 
 But when cold rains have made go free, 
 And when they scream and slide 
 Acceptable to God, they die as they 
 Heard from their highest canvas. 
 
 Beyond the realms of years desire 
 To match
