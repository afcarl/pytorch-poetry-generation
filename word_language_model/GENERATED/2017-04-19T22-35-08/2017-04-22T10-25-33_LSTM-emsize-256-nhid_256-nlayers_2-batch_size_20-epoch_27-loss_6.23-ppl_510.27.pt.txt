 As feet, out the familiar sea of light, 
 And the blind hairs of friends must play. 
 
 Speak from time to the stretch of Eldorado!' 
 Will this strip be not visible, 
 antic your human knowledg let me awake, 
 To the shining peace from first dim, 
 Suspended back our mortal wings. 
 
 
 
 Pure past the shop 
 Stretching upon the walls, 
 With a serene gray reports. 
 
 Play, in lives that settle 
 On the blasted
