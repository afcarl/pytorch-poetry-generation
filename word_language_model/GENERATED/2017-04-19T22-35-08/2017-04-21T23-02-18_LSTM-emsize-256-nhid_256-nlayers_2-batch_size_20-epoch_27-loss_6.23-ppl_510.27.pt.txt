Of A Different Dead? 

 As if it were a means of growth and nothing and shame 
 
 Now that's what with us you'd become. 
 
 So I took the stick across an unknown bed, 
 And I call deeper and ready to years? 
 I'm going into the car with my back head, 
 abrogate the seed progressed in like a casket, 
 mezzed by his intelligence, all else, in love of the name 
 lame as a black sentinel cemetery. He falls.
