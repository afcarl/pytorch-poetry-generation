Is The River Corridors 

 And flapping before death and Drugs: he is gone. 
 
 
 
 
 
 pitch-black, on the Fat Republic 
 
 
 Given to stow shadow, 
 Those bushes of harvest birds 
 Shouting off the girls and dusk 
 And hid their linen, cigarettes, 
 
 They recall the goddamned of their scorn.

 When the moon goes up late before me, 
 I see thee, from under the lake with that lake 
 Shaking
