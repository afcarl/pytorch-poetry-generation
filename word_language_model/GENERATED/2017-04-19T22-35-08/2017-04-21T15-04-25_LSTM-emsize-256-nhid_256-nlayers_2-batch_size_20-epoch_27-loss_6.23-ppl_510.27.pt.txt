 The seat opening fresh as triumphs 
 Of the last that comes and rode 
 The ambulance counts with a round face, 
 As those familiar ditties with 
 Sooner by Heavenâ€™s cold outer excuse: 
 But thou, for years long gray, 
 Their eyes set in clarities with numbers 
 Among white shafts of black boys. 
 And full of their hut flowing, midafternoon 
 Among the nouns 
 
 In mentioning silence of the world, 
 It breaks as we veil 
 From its narrow
