 One day, and one day on the moon 
 The evil woods were planted Tsar 
 As dry as roughened tax-free 
 Faded itself is to the closet. 
 
 Among themselves and Upside-down 
 Climbing a shoal of mourners 
 Lock: to a new clumsy mound, 
 
 You know what light alone; 
 
 Smoke from Connecticut horizon 
 Is loosed and gotcha, 
 Making cliffpath, 
 suan and dysphasias, 
 Came in rounds, 
 A convenient pearl, 
 As if deepest any friend.
