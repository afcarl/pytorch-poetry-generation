 His arms were soft and Nanni 
 If he were founded on the track, 
 And he made back the steps of Hell, 
 
 Now but two woodland hours he climbed 
 Sang faster on the gloom, 
 The nameless chop they wept: 
 And it was in court that he was hard: 
 If then be drowsing out of ocean, 
 Whenever his shadow fro the saddle-leather, 
 His pants was folded on the shield one arm, 
 And pelt with flowers, and o'er it
