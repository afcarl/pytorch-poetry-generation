 So you seem in fear of all that life 
 is hidden. 
 
 
 
 An autumn of a law 
 I hold it now with shafts of lights 
 black wynde, pops 
 into the bark tree gay; 
 the surf buzz drift-wood to the bank. 
 Wild as Dores, there's a fern hammer sand 
 
 and in the thin sequins 
 of the chair's Philomenas 
 Hemlock in the reeds, a basket 
 that no one should leave there in 
 breasts in
