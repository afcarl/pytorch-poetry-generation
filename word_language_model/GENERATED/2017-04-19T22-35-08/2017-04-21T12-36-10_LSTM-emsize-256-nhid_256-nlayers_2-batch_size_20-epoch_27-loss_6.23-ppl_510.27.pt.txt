God'S Kissing: Boughs--So . . . 

 
 I do it 
 How was it so deeply naturally that you, 
 Was also of my James then foolish. 
 
 It seemed to leave: 
 I said tomorrow 
 
 dozes up from me 
 
 Only this cup crater downstairs 
 I sat down in a day 
 Slowly unaccountable 
 and thought to call my sin 
 --the immaculate vowels 
 of his record. 
 I guess it was a pleasure 
 of ships. Not better,
