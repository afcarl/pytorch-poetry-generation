Alone, 

 Cars will controls its silver mist 
 
 When I see the last twelve 
 lifted out onto the desert 
 With verses and the speed coat. 
 
 
 
 You were still talking about the tree 
 ~ 
 And when I came back John pointed like rattles 
 across his earthen banner strewn 
 with voice & flashing legs as close to the knees 
 deepest no longer strathspeys, of wooden cedar, 
 they heard when the first crack their legs 
 pressed
