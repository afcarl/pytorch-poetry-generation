From It. 

 
 House like the odds for the past, 
 partition-- fun of all these 
 stupor of our death-- 
 Mothers Felice, 
 Pediatrics potter's & beautiful 
 Listens, OLIVE a little child, successively still 
 
 Self-love and image. Now it is a time 
 embrace. 
 
 O Arezzo, Nature, fish fled to halves 
 From the house like a tree--the dagger 
 One set by your eye -- 
 Caught your transformed threads to the entrance, 
 In the fragrant hollow tower
