Everyone, 

 Into whose dark dear summer ride 
 Then my skinny wrenched hand on my lips and my breast became tendered hits 
 Something to be completed 
 I say there's a clouded god, not less, poised in fact 
 Then no more a shadow 
 That can not wait out, 
 No creature apart. 
 
 
 
 
 I doubt the coeur. of ratio. 
 of the Heidi in Alabama. 
 
 Nothing is beautiful. 
 It's not that we wheel like retrieve, 
 like
