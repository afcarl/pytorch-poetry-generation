A Canoe Shy, 

 
 skis; and anything knew 
 That all these are the stars and flowers 
 
 * 
 
 "Cable, a reflect bones--femur, 
 In gravity, and in branches 
 I have love dolls 
 In the dream from beyond the world, gone, 
 And memorized: 
 Active with her weakness 
 Stand honest, not hurt, too, where I read 
 In the bell of punky the 
 myelin blow 
 Melts at her hands. 
 
 Her wrist is a falling.
