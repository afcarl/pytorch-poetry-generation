I Open Your Bed, 

 However to see why I can see Potsdamerplatz, 
 You sit looking down in the deep glimmers green, 
 The squat kiss, 
 The surged along the hill. 
 
 I am old in a sleep, on land and mist, 
 Until my wishing fall computer's time to read 
 The very song within, to say one murmurs in my heart 
 
 And Communications branchless by the Lost trip of always 
 Sailing along over the tented hills and lines in the
