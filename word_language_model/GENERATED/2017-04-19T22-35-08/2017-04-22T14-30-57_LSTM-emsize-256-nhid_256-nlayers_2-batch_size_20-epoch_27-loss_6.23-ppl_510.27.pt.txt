Spotted The Field 

 Of polished pitchers the horned cherishes 
 Descending her shrunken gloom and drear, 
 Her cheeks kike, but in her trance 
 Sleek milk with white, with tears, 
 And every part she antithetically .gRrEaPsPhOs) 
 To go about her through the fields long obeyd 
 With blood that solemn bosom quit, 
 To such as strain constellations at its length, 
 Obsessing our souls, such pity are lent, 
 From pleasure to live, and have much love, 
 A season in evening darkened
