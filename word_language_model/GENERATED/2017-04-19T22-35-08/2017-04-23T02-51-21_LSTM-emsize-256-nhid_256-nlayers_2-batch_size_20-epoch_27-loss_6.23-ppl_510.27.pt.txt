 But this Toil to come 
 Keeps there; and for will they crack 
 A form 
 Of the hoes streams & gleam 
 A ragged scroll 
 Listening thru the rose of blue, 
 Best sweetly, 
 Soonest could tI to me. 
 
 Let's call a question. 
 
 You wildflower, flitting myself in the summer there, 
 And shrink into running. 
 
 And if you had printed on.
