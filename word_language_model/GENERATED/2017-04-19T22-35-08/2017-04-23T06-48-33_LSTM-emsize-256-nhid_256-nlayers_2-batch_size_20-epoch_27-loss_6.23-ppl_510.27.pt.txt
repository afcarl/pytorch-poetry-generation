 There, Akechis miles as long as death 
 Be waking hiccups, the strong world 
 Sae not, but does the please 
 Itself that ask. That danced this thirty 
 Of weather and the excellence -- 
 I found a hollow sea no more. 
 
 And, kind, of course, Ken, down, 
 Float forward into the wrangling wind, 
 And presuming round without a flute 
 Sprinckled with murmurs and fear; 
 If I had old; 
 I never breathe Leaves 
 At Nature, to cure
