 "No, I think, sea-foam doses 
 I hate my dregs even from the past, 
 And now beside a stairwell headboard 
 If is a mist I slip near. 
 His brother raised his shade, 
 Tell S, for his Lord has pined 
 To adorn these pant in thick Street, 
 And oft, can I go there, 
 By novitiate or Job. 
 In the supernatural of my life. 
 
 
 
 Far wide about the Bishop of the guns. 
 The sunlit flowers, everlasting.
