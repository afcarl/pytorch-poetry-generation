 
 
 I begin to pain 
 with my mirror open 
 In this afternoon, 
 living in the evening 
 Shining and absolute 
 And the lovers of these 
 wind and dip the hideous 
 Through hopes of anguish and those 
 Country of the soul. 
 
 
 
 crisscrossed. 
 invalided on memory Unwearied 
 in your Corner Trade. 
 City of yder and reflex 
 of doubt. 
 
 So the voice that slew 
 the lost mountain box 
 may not
