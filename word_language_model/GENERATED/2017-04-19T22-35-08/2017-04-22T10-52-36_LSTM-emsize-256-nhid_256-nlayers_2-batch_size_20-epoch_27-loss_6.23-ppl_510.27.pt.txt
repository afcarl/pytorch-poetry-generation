Poetry, 

 Unwisely elsewhere, the nurse 
 sings Nobbut the puckered cat 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You Sullen a Manual 
 The spats at the couch's Level 
 Like an armature of straighter (copulating!), 
 A falcon on the moon and a door could grow 
 Curteis before her he would go 
 At last to question her. 
 
 There may be phaselus 
 Take less than the eighty-four. 
 You have inside it: 
 The mind climbing & goes 
 To have fooled
