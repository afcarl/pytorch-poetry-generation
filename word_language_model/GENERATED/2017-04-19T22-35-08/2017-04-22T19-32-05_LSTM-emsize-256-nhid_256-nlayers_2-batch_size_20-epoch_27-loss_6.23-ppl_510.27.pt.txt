 Then lift his head like a ghost, 
 And find it as thick as that gen'rous breath 
 Of love's chief regions all inspires 
 Till he caught the last glass it perished, 
 I heard him swing 
 No wind in the fields of stone or geese 
 Bank without enterprise. 
 
 Breaking her hands in the night 
 She delivered the jug of bloodstain 
 Upon the frolic plain 
 And there was only a howl 
 Beyond the darkness, baffled tea, 
 Somewhere
