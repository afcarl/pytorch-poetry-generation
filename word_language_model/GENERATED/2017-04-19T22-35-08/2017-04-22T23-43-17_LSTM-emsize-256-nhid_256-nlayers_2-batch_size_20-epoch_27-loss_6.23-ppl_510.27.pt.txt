Always Mist Of Wind 

 and knocking the jade wood 
 of the iron forest, the frosty night 
 when the building was five-inch and the tooth 
 of the junta like a learning; like a drum 
 from which even a pier 
 sings put into somebody in the light 
 of the deep turnstyle that rarely imagined 
 the head mourns when it comes suddenly 
 after the spring lamps drilled from the scales, 
 laid down the broken lake, holding exhausted 
 an old tetanus
