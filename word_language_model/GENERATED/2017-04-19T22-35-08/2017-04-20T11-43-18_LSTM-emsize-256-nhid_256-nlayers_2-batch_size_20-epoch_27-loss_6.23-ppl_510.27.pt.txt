All 

 The world was gathering down 
 On each thing the Then seemed to judging his 
 Few thousand different tires. 
 
 North, too humble 
 Lapides bright worshippers! 
 Bright suns nor hues of fire 
 That wanton light; 
 The hour, the smirk of the body 
 Gives it not his; the paper earth 
 
 honied their pale lodges 
 
 To the fields no more. 
 
 Let hence the screaming hinge. 
 
 Now is the only child to ask.
