Time-- 

 
 And then I stepped out to touch you. 
 
 
 
 I dreamed of snow 
 I went on living innocently 
 Dreaming of my poem. 
 I was afraid. 
 
 I said to some, the wasp 
 and drag their rumbling eyeballs? 
 Now we may find me afraid. 
 
 A thousand miles other or the father 
 the heart straining to be handcrafted. 
 
 From the seventh throat it goes down 
 or may have been for stained things
