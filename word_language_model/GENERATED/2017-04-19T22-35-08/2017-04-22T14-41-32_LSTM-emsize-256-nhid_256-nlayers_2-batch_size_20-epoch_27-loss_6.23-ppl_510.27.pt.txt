 For the spring by night I am hammering each cord 
 Than an outhouse, a red hair, each voice 
 Like meteors in the best plumes of the sun, 
 Where the sands of Britain dissolved by day, 
 Save the terrible names of the sun, 
 "Here, upon them as they fall to construct 
 This sweet bygon! haunted by the top. 
 
 
 
 
 The only emperor is made by the north sky, 
 Murmur, a rock, as flat, sharpening damsels on you,
