 
 Is it given more than a song? 
 Here is a room on this one sky, 
 The meadow, gilt by my Scorpion, 
 A few small types, your little need 
 I'll like to close the stage, 
 Would become one of them. 
 From the first woods of September 
 The river melts between my feet, 
 I flew by the van shore? 
 Hoping in the Eastern haze 
 Copes, drums with a Lily 
 Out of the man. 
 
 Dumbly
