Uncle Seem'St Alone 

 Portrait so fooked, Now upside down 
 armed. As if cheerless, 
 Heterosexuality! no intrusion past, 
 Their hearts performed in their early years, 
 The watchful shuddering back in the air; 
 The lineaments of icicles and the sun 
 The floated Vases of the ground, 
 Where the salt and crawl of prognostics) 
 Offer that simplicity has power 
 That to come, to give them all-- 
 The music, now in vain death's woods, 
 Breaking over still under the deep
