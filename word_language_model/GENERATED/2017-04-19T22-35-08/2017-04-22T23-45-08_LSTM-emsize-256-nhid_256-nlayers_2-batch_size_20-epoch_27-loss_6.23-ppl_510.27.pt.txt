 This little piggy day alone 
 On this Magellanic iced tables, 
 the tinkling skin, the Garcia Water, 
 ruthless Plaines, 
 
 And I came to braver witness 
 in open doors to introduce him. 
 I did almost say you fed in your hands. 
 
 
 
 When the north morning 
 is bigger and absolutely singing alone 
 to otherwise what we were to do, but exactly, which 
 wasn't ever worth! but often, in the ark 
 of the world, and also
