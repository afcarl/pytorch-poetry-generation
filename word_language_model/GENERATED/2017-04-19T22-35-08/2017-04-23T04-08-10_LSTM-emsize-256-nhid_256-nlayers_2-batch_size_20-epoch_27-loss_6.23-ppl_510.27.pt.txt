On Their Hands; 

 They open the red steps 
 And dark buttons fell and see. 
 So all that hraor and candles 
 Rude unremitting rooftops of snow 
 Ever hung out the ass like white, 
 Make mulne trump the Whate're 
 The Tickles said, hanky-panky brother, 
 A fantastic Slant of myths, 
 towers tap the Sacz ... 
 artificer in the Knucklebone say, 
 And whom are I a god, 
 Yet Nocturne of cruel sights 
 That, as the mist cloud enters
