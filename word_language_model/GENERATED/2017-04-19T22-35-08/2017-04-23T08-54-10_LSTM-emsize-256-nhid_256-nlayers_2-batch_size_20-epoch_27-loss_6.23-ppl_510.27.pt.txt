And Bends About 

 
 Thoughts their kids cracked and pale 
 slapping the veins of their nails. 
 
 
 
 
 
 HMO Reed 
 
 
 Pepperell ALWAYS Touch behind 
 Sundays from a fat man 
 whom in small knock-outs, cattle, 
 While thunder dash the howl 
 With its blade of stadium, a long-ago 
 applied to its miller's knee. 
 
 Varus' chases toil and hands, 
 Warm and dead,â€” 
 
 Not a whisper, grace or brown, 
 But the hope
