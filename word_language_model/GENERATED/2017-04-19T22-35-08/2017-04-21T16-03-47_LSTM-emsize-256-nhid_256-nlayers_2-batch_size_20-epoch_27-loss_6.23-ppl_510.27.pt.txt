 
 How the splash of burning lights for man the hay 
 With shelter and his tongue and head my hand phone. 
 The ice is withered and the shadows flew, 
 And baskets, Lining the immeasurable skies: 
 The tallying earth was anointed, 'tis a dry girl 
 And dances towards all the world once much, 
 The audience: a looped darkening a head gallops through, 
 Yet both the wounded movements of the courtier's glyph 
 safely about sickened: and perplexed that, 
 greaves, springs
