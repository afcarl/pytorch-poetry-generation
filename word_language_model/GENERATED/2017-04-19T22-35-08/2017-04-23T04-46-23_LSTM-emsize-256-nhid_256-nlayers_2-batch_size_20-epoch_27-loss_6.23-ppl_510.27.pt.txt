Going. 

 
 But the old 
 
 facts? 
 My ole eye 
 plunges out. 
 Rain did seem 
 three years straight 
 To the edge of clotheslines, 
 They really remember exactly 
 With its shopping trash 
 At home these keys 
 Cupid Pennsylvania: a 
 Outstretched pickup. 
 ... 
 The big black button 
 Inspir'd; beating off 
 
 To blow the doors 
 And that floe, with the cry. 
 Nor had a fortune yet.
