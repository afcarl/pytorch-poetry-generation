Shone, 

 This soldier is the only beauty that cannot be round, 
 Some to say no mother in the claw graip 
 Though expressed evil ports, and dark bold 
 Will be set that sweet flag for us scented at the crucible flowers 
 Above the clouds better than polyester croak dress. 
 The yoke-freed arrows of the aftermath of light soldiers fade 
 On the sunlight, flamed to the damp table in the air. 
 We startled the pyramids the streets against trees entrenchments.
