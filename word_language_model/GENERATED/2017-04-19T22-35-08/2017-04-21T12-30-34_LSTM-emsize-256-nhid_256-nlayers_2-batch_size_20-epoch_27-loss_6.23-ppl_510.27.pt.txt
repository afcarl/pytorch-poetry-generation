Back Right Crowd To Wince, 

 Enough out so? 
 
 I care that I could see this imploded 
 Where the tiny unused hand 
 Is far as the Grotto 
 Worcester's me] well-model'd, 
 We go home, and step hard, 
 light-bulb stoned, 
 Strange adventure, 
 And the choir, repeat of bluer llamas' chimneys, 
 And the ships Sonata 
 Swimming in the brain. 
 When the anchor on the sand cuts fingers 
 For a good nothing clean, 
 Moves among the faces
