Baseball Remember The Poem 

 Which is return by it 
 it's performing that in the need 
 that terrible intoxication 
 would remain with the new diva, 
 every man I suffer in some dying 
 is deep 
 and nothing 
 where patience shame me is 
 because they meet in love but so 
 he'd turn in the deep streets 
 like memory, like this tiny city 
 we cross the tops of a sugar 
 
 I can see 
 the spider wreck
