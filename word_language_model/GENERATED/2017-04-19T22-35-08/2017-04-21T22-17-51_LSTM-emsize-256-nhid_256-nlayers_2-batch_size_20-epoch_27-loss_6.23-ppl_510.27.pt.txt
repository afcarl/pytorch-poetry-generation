 And steadfastly heard the stories 
 foryeve no less music on the shore. 
 
 Ianthe! we eat the gates of death. 
 
 I'm all my country hard to float 
 By the sane earth; the love-sick. 
 
 Follow the summer streets the sky. 
 We're mounting out of sleep 
 And gently vanish from the air 
 By the Golden fire and it overbear 
 And me, half inviolate to slake 
 At lost hands on the crown shore: 
 And the rides crackles
