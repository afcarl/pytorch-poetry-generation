 Citing made,there'd sweet riddles 
 Full-flowered ears pierce. 
 
 What matters release me â€” 
 what you should assert. 
 
 What was it the deepest 
 worth I like to hear, 
 the towns that crazed and pained, 
 
 In their tradition 
 I was tired. So I grew 
 suddenly against my brothers-in-law, 
 desperate but I couldn't rehearsed 
 but spring corner jewelled 
 and I think of the love 
 I find myself 
 in terror from looking on 
 wrong
