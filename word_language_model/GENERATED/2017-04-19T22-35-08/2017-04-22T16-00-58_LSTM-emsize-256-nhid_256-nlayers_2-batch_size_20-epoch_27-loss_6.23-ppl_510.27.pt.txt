 For me, it bore a lot of strangers 
 on his side centred dropped with stump of corn 
 
 And sent it by St. palm-shaded hee 
 Entering the Comics, and pushes onto the South 
 night with a heart of my glossy scrotum; 
 
 multiplying in the starring ditch, 
 I slept in an apprehension 
 where the flames of pounding. 
 
 Far on the prong of my soul 
 Should be as simple as a wind.
