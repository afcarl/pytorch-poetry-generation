 Your daughters are gone and company lunacy: 
 I guess you youâ€™re alone. 
 One thing you thought of looking around you pass'd 
 in its innocent hidden dark, 
 London and at last was the most sir, 
 you grazed their hands in a suit, 
 then heard our way back, 
 and these people there within death, 
 spread so past and yet to sort 
 of train's rain. And the painful 
 slap of a swerve and never so dark 
 was lacking by
