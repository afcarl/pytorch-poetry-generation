New Peter'S Sheep. 

 Could they expect to entertain 
 An imperial art, 
 
 Or early from forgot, 
 I lead them while unministered-- 
 Flowers, the coats of dull oxygen, 
 Chant beloved. 
 
 
 
 The silences away from Central Imps 
 How little race! Unbuilding, galaxies, 
 Strike in a grape grounded there 
 Every comfort is the target that sort 
 Of forgiveness. Every vice is made, 
 We wear our beauties; play it might shiver 
 Proclaim upon us from death:
