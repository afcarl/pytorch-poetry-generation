That 

 On every detail, so aloof 
 As I have left the south-west of 
 Nile over the brain,-- 
 Body gang wax 
 As blood brims itself over & buzzing of breath. 
 I see the pink Avon road, the 
 unshadowed street; and if that I know, 
 Full of the children I use the space 
 creeping once from train to adjust, not stare 
 Was hurl from a laundry window the blue 
 Someday two-thirds without form of such a ghostly face;
