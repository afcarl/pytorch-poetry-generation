The Last 

 Loves its quirks become roots 
 He turns torch where Jesus walk. 
 
 An holy angel answers there a paused, 
 
 Its double Wind. 
 
 After all, I have climbed to see awash 
 In search of its slowness of geography 
 Like something dangerous. 
 
 How loud it is, which snows I think of 
 This time Lille, 
 Until the spare unspoken golden mound 
 
 XLVI 
 
 And I'm home of the school I'm being born
