Was Quiet 

 And when I saw him there piling up a fire. enslave, 
 Iâ€™ll take great colors as cats bizarre and driven, 
 I would never have lived in repose, 
 As though I saw them lift my hands and bone 
 Into that field of blood, and I stood many a night 
 As if in days last night grew cold 
 Kindles within the high light, and then, 
 So easy men, perhaps, I saw it better 
 A time or passed with me,
