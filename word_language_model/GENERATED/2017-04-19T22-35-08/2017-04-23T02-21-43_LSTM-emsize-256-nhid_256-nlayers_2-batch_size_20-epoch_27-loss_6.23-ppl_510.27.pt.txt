Fire. 

 Everyone might have changed. Who could not write. 
 
 Then this narcissus is water, the dress 
 Project sick in its cold destiny! 
 Round and music-like and choked by man, 
 With the scouring look of his wheels. 
 
 He is not like love, they who speak cannot help Helen? 
 Their laughter is grown red, hot and bland, 
 Negroes must the foolish man die; the youngsters 
 sit still, black and barred over, 
 feeling himself and nothing more.
