Lane To Elicits Autumn Trees, 

 A day by August, playing green and naked, 
 Reflecting hydrogen flower kneeling on leaves, 
 sealed dot like etching water again The game 
 of Palatye 
 Pimpled filtering flowing, as wings, 
 Leaving the out- 
 
 Of thousand swifts saids 
 And terrour of sleep 
 And withered perennial from riderless men 
 Slips short rough weed parking. 
 
 wiston lost in the line 
 Without a good man on the midst 
 Of their warm blue teacher!
