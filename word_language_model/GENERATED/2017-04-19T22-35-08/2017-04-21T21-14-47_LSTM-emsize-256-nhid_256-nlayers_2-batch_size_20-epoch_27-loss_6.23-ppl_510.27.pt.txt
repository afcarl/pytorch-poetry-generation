Both Fully Make; 

 But what much else is what it is! 
 
 There is a certain solitude 
 And never weep, but not good enough 
 To breathe out, thou wilt try 
 To push the salt hair. 
 
 Yet many autumn. 
 The Minoan and the weeds are limpid yields. 
 Then make the air as if ever one was there. 
 By at least, I tell him he would have died me here? 
 
 But what you see is the angel boures.
