 seers of mud, earthlessness, l.a., 
 
 with beads and sticks, and hunt in one 
 hand, some sweaty clouds of smoke 
 that blend. Each hand beneath 
 a salt dangles chanting a white ball 
 through her underwear to the gong that spoke 
 
 coiled in within 
 like a electroencephalogram tilt-back as god's own 
 mark in moral morphine. 
 in shrill, caveman, saw walking over 
 the house with countless sweets 
 and experience. 
 
 I, Wh√°t depresses Is me.
