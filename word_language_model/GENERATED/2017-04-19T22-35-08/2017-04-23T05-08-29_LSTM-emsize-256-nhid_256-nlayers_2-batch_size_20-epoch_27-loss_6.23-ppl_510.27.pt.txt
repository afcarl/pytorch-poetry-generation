 So long and long. duchesses, I smiled trotting again, 
 And poisoned by its toys, 
 
 Leaving mud, thin owl, worn and anon 
 Each time I took back again, 
 I urge them to get away the Leaves, 
 By the Ponte figure 
 Palpable Jacob and was...Band 
 After Paris I mourn, 
 Not care this: 
 as the shadow in someone else's hands 
 The house they made to the end 
 Who loved him, 
 But not in the burned 
 Retiring,
