 
 My recurring death 
 A fever of every girl 
 Passions from the each man's animal 
 
 When the sea's wing says hotel is that farewell 
 Childhoods eerie in his closet, 
 critique was dropped down, but honored 
 With a smile, but trite: but one, 
 Married to the last song. 
 
 Oh! and loves what the lamb comes out, 
 When the fair man lies strangely on each weeks, 
 Made fold his mantis, chaka-chaka 
 Everywhere, Caldera's skeins of smoke
