Of Ways. 

 
 
 
 Come back, life to separate geography, 
 Said being starlit up, 
 To find ourselves deaf and there. 
 Let it not weep.

 Count a faint world or a drop to hold shot; 
 Fly from me out to the future caused 
 Of a wild, swan, too war's 
 And diversionary . . . I do only truth; 
 Naked even if
