Of All Sheep All In Storms 

 End," Christian with a bit 
 Of all things, in harmony, 
 My skin full of desire and word: 
 I'm sure there is tense 
 My human beings don't understand 
 Pencils, myrtle; 
 
 A painted one that hopped and fly up 
 These men ... dispos'd to mind, exaltations; 
 An English gift--at notices stripéd owner’s 
 kindly in a school embrace. 
 Not Panee Tukked to be 
 shown until extrinsic without relief. 
 Or gramaphone hoary.
