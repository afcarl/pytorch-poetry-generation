 
 High beyond my face 
 
 in my chair, beginning 
 
 Behind the barns, 
 lady--what and Sitting 
 Between the mouth where I once 
 Thy Moment is expected-- 
 But ah! if even 
 Your city is its thought 
 Clear today this moment, newly 
 Blind thought of desire to live 
 By all things away-- not the present 
 Not of this bear this strange world 
 Where no more in the eyes 
 Of man's tickets is in the grave.
