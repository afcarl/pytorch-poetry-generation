Hurt 

 Wasn't travellers to Earth's blossom, 
 We're a little carton on the road 
 And a mixed bottle of brightness. 
 And all the silence would never last year's thought— 
 Though from all little titles it does. 
 That one word retreat on a sourcing chair-back. 
 Where is sit is fought! a conjure-man. 
 And even mountain and sere 
 Is boo-hoo but the answer—you smile, 
 To which we'll ever forget, to be. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The tea,
