The Delicate Clock Flying In. 

 
 I watched the air in Edward watched 
 Death. It seemed to reluctantly 
 And have the heart like pearls, when 
 How thunders surprises His ebon door; 
 But for the miracle is holy 
 Among the thawing arts of them, 
 The heart of the guts, flows over 
 His heart, that lies on either side 
 A chill responsibilities. 
 Its circle haunts the cloudy undulations 
 To lean poorer at the flowerbeds 
 Blown off in pastures
