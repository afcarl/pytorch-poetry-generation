That Day The Dove 

 Was constructed like the nesting lostâ€” 
 The silent forest rang with utmost spring. 
 What to be like a belle serves me a true sky. 
 You need shame for it to be strange. 
 Truth is but the purpose of that calf. 
 "So look, while we undress th' information there, 
 The Bushes and glows blows from the floor and the walls song 
 
 Supremely green for the sprig--a ears.
