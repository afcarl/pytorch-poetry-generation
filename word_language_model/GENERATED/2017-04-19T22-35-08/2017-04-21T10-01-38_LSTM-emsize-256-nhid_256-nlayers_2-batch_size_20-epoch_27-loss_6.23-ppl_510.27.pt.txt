Wide, 

 Not a marble single noon, 
 When this cold invitations are angelic night; 
 And upon Waked there in green. 
 
 
 
 As The rain learnt rattle about my panes. 
 The saddest patience is the thing 
 I longed for my body to be loved by stars. 
 Meanwhile, I've walked back, 
 And hunted months into my life, 
 In the hearts of the year to roar, 
 Who hung in the bones of the sea. 
 Both days have passed out
