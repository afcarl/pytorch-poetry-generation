Rest! 

 What numbing. How trouble so this -- 
 The sense happinesses not said, Stella's spirit, 
 Not written in what I am told 
 Is a part of what hard is the sense 
 
 Of my self which goes to school in the wrong deaths 
 
 To serve in the hoarse wood reverse 
 The living of seeing and punch to the shore 
 Upon a planet like a pomegranate peasant 
 Whose one waits for my own words to speak 
 
 And
