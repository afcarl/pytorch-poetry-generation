This Dwarfed Diagonal 

 Of which man's flowers have turned to youâ€” 
 Though servants memories of all their desks 
 Would we be quiet on the bridge or before, 
 To oblivion wait for wasteful wine; 
 And with Life's inward lid, so still. 
 
 The monk's militant seam, 
 The sportive Form, and starry Fimble 
 The slow breath of the night before 
 Its grieves, and the soft fast- 
 Noble rifle-blast. The ocean's wake and blue.
