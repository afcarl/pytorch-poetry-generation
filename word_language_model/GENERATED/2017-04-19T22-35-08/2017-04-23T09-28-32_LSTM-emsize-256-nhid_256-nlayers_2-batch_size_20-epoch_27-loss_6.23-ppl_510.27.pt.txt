In The Evening 

 gurns scraps obvious. 
 
 A small woman in her van, 
 She sat and hears 
 He looked at her as usual, 
 She saw her, as one 
 round woman on the mast, she hastens 
 With a thought-bound blade around her balcony. 
 The foundry eyebrows glued to cover 
 As before, the fire already Fellatah, 
 pacing her head were throbbing 
 
 She steps tilted and head to catch 
 The simplest beauty in her narrow pocket, 
 And
