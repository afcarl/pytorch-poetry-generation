 In bubbles and forgotten 
 And no good word lasts 
 A strange pain. 
 Red singer plays with the old 
 Honey!" Theatre, 
 Who pours a woman to her side, A&P, 
 We sat nineteen in her arms. 
 
 An oak sun. Then she thought it was 
 A girl when her first sister has moved. 
 Still-born, we make better together, 
 To that woman's window read her paradise 
 As when she screamed, she saw the burr 
 Of care. With that
