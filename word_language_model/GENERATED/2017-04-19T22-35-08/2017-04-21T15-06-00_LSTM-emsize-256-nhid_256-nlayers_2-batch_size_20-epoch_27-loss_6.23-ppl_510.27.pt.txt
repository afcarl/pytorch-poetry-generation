If Once I Was Able 

 Dry and very fast. There, come 
 
 I appease. myself in that cave, 
 I could not sit near her breathing magic 
 and not without order. I wanted to take you 
 sequined like this to grumble and throw 
 it back ends and expect to make 
 out â€” as I walk my name as is no longer 
 less cold to tell the horse goodbye and 
 be gertrude grays and orphaned 
 and greenless, overhead.
