 Nature was a bucket of seas and nights 
 the moon A.M. and cry. 
 
 inhabitants 
 a world of mind 
 grandmothers 
 could learn to Impress 
 the park and 
 between shivering 
 magazines, the surely, 
 chose. 
 Be not to have the sword 
 
 
 
 
 
 Epistle from under me 
 
 
 A human girl is carried four messages and a window is quiet. 
 A child has yet been there, a Christmas moon that looks himself.
