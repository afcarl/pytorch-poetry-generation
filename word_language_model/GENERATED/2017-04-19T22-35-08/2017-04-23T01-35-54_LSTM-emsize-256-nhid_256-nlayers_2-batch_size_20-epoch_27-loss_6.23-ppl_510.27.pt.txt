 
 After the world's words 
 that sea, 
 these walls float in the green 
 dense trees like a painter 
 who watches the snow 
 and when I wave, banking between 
 the dented wind, and I 
 chased my breath. The history I 
 left them; like photographs of blurb 
 
 
 who would have ears 
 an artificial barber 
 neatly dress alone 
 
 turn the cold grandiloquence socks 
 hanging it Escort gain 
 
 scuffed chin behind 
 her
