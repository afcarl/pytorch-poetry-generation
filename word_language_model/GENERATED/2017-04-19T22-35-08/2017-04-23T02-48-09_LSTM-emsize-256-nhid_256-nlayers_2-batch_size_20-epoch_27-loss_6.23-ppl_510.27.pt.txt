Is Too Big To See, 

 That the record in that dark economy 
 And of the belfry stippled ocean 
 Can break off upwards over Earth. 
 
 The great complains of nature is real, 
 It is time to be fully going, 
 To the time in the pod asset. it is time. 
 
 
 
 Live here here, may despair 
 Carve me and not to die: 
 Which mark an honest town, 
 Mountains, but the heart of fire, 
 To all that
