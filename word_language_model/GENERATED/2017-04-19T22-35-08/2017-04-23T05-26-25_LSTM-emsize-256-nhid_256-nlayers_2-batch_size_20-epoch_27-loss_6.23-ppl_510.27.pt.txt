Shears, 

 And the step hung of dawn, as he wished 
 The mother of discharges birds-eye Roman; would 
 generation 
 Go asleep Exactly where they came mad 
 As one to child that she should have conscience 
 As her tool, tail she gave her to propose 
 An ally of reading time and her heart 
 Cut on her Dolphin, its dull set capelet, 
 She lies fast as the rolling snow grew cold 
 Gaze at her in the chest's mirror watching,
