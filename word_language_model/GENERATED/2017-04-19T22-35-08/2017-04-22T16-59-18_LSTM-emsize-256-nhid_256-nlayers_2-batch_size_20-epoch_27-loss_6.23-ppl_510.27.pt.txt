 for three days for the morrow;â€”vainly 
 that the rosin stay in trees and red boys 
 and is breathing for whom my keeping 
 waking them as I am here 
 all night past 
 opening and tire 
 turns back opposite 
 age from least 
 to be engirth the nightingale, 
 of love, 
 
 if I am not elly having met 
 last night I take for tractor-pulled 
 one of them -- 
 
 language for strangers to sit 
 on sidewalks
