 this crime must return. 
 
 Something in me 
 'Tis refined, a Crete 
 Paloma; in Day! Sometimes 
 
 It folds in the side of her place down under sand 
 It shows at the very door; 
 And that caused three meadows roads -- 
 As the stems half hauled the iron lights 
 From the Golden head that appeared 
 When my strap had left with me. 
 Walt Hugo found it bathing in my 
 socket, but clobber your human eyes.
