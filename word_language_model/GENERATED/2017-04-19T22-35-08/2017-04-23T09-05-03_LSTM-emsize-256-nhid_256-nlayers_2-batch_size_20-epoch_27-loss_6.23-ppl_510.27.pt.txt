 ballads"-- then from opaque garden.â€”Have, 
 I've sprung up transmit 
 One photograph of the slowing fist 
 
 Open the front seat, which lies behind 
 The sea stirs 
 Born in succession on caps, 
 
 The world is Only a thing but embrace, 
 Whose bodies are very beautiful 
 In weather.

 That's love in my sap songs these days long. 
 No one said what? 
 They winced on my stomach
