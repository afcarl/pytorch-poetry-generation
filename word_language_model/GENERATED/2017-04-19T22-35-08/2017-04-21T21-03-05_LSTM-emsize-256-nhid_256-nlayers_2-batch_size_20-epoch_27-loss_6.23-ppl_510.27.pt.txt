 And whisper and love 
 Between it, 
 
 And then I say the sun 
 I say where it's back on having admiring 
 unvoiced of what we're doing you come 
 I can't count 
 Was a hope I wonder why 
 I'm working for a veil 
 I would I think in noon I am the same, and 
 Days of me, they say 
 I would happen than I and I 
 Can find you here i will write in our lives
