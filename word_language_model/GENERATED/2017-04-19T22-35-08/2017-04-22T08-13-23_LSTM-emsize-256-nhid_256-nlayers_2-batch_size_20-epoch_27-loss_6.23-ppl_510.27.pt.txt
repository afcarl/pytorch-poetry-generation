 His neighbors bathe his arm on the moss, 
 Like me in the woods pelted his fist. 
 
 I wash the tune that cries, I said; 
 Oh, time is my heart to me 
 To my glad "But," Mine is the God 
 What I am drowned? 
 
 Methought I saw the junipers in the wood, 
 While the permutations of heaven descends 
 Talking and wired of pillar 
 In and weak and mouthing sunset 
 More from the fragrant forest flow'd,
