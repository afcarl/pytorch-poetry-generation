 
 A black ennui. 
 
 Out 
 Of the dusk he out, wings 
 Of a ivory stem, pedal 
 Moloch on the street Bird. 
 
 Horror like the Oldest two notes already tall, 
 He's a fleet of Sioux covering 
 A sieve of honey vine and eloquence 
 sea-cliff's hay with sister 
 Silence. Only 
 The one who carries up man's solitude--am 
 
 The heavens still eyed their floribunda, 
 Young lovers indiscriminate green. 
 Our souls are met like that?
