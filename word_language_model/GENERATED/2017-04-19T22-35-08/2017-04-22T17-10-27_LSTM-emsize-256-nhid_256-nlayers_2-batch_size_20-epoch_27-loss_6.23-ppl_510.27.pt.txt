 As I go down in the river with my noise, 
 my dream I stand in a clear chamber. 
 
 I see the shadowed voice leaves without doves 
 under the crowds of old leaves I died until 
 I was already gently smokes, that evening 
 beat out of summer, then tould 
 the rules, what's one of all things true, 
 that only knowing still as I am, 
 Persepolis even her body. 
 instrumentsâ€”the holy warrior again that brings 
 nowhere to country
