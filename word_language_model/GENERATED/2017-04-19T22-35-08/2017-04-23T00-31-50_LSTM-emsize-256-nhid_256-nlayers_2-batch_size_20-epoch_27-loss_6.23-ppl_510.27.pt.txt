To Crumble. Everything Before Earth 

 Has been by now in memory that is comforting 
 At The edge of battle or these, that I am Erin, 
 to be assessing to slake so long came there 
 
 All night paper winding by the sun 
 Now make of our way, there comes profanation 
 To feel equally into the mind, 
 surely that love can produce 
 Like everything else, all 
 I've knownâ€” 
 
 Up from banks where I've died of 
 the world
