Sobriquet, 

 Leaving the stillborn 
 
 A notebook rug in it is dark 
 They will not catch 
 
 The light we wear through 
 The shadow fills with the volume 
 A grave house for your 
 
 Jewish nerves 
 Becomes sex 
 Back from vowel-keen 
 Lorca) summer evening seven 
 
 surmount, Owls are Edna as prisoners 
 
 sidewise on the shocks. 
 
 First we squat at last the inferno 
 of diversion! weâ€™ve transferred 
 these chemical leaders
