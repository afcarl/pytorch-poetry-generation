Travel, The Kill. 

 
 
 
 We blink through a white helmless suitcase 
 and put our failure: and sat 
 under the sun from a rusty lip, 
 and leaking between two in glass light, 
 and our cheeks. 
 
 Burning burdened by the handful of lovemaking 
 we wearing the damage of a detective 
 and the dance look up with bright cans 
 that an infant named breath 
 making its divinity 
 as long as it flies boring with their light,
