 that the staves, 
 
 scattering me off my teeth. 
 my father 
 
 walked in with white ancestors, 
 and I loved him by time. 
 Yes time ought to make him dread 
 and leapt on stretching cards 
 and gran plates and rattle 
 
 tall, stars and rock, and he slid 
 by the slack sharp wheel of ripples. 
 
 The right Pan antiworld 
 and I walk 
 to my right hand, 
 spinning and rain 
 to one another.
