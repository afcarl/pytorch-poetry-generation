Falling Again, 

 Till a crow was green and cracked, the bird smells 
 Like flowers through his own little blood. 
 
 And, mother, each day down, and left the nest, 
 With city fold their pointed spears, 
 All by the frosty city, the Egyptian moon, 
 The foot of which looped sight, while rainwater, 
 instant--and the force of water from the days, 
 The beating of the passionate quarry-gang 
 of Zinc! codes impressions 
 
 In the drear bathe they left to talk
