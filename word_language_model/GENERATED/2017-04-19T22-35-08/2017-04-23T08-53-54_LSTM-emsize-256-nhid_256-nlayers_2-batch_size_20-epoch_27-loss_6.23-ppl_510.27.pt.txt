Feels To Caress 

 His soul held up the dark. 
 It is drawn to a continuing coast, 
 
 To be heard to the child, 
 This the brave face must live for dust, 
 Down his lane or low in his hands. 
 
 His dreams are all between the clove 
 And the shock curls up from the dust 
 Died only that the hair beats through, 
 With his Luftwaffe, empty bands rent sweet 
 Because it was at that, as the body
