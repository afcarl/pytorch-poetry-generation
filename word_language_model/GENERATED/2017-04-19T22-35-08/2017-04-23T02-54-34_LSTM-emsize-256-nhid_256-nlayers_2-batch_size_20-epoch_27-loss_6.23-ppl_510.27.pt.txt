The Fire, 

 empressâ€™s to me -- 
 sparingly to talk of the light of the fire, 
 Until I would fall on the blackboard, 
 It seems to depart, -- I'm sorry that your 
 Noah's case. 
 
 With the teenage wives 
 Crusade of Goethe give a man, 
 To stroke that pilasters, soul. 
 
 What could you think that my own that 
 Created Songs was this to me. 
 
 Today your eyes like a stem followed 
 in a red room.
