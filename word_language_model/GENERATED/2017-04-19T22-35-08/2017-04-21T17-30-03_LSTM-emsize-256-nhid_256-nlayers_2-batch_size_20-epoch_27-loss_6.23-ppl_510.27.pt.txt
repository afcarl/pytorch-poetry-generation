 When I buried my horse 
 I fell among diorite 
 Eat I saw his voice 
 frock, was home to me. 
 Did I Fiddle, my lad, 
 My little bit of lumberjacks 
 Is my hideouts, or a Bill. 
 
 So my smile has on thee! 
 Streets of me, be a man 
 I jump away jelly-glass purple, 
 With ragged hands and wrinkled head 
 And Miss P. powder three 
 To one of ten long left is mine; 
 He woos
