 As the multitude touches a winding stone 
 To the slaves who play around the house with wind. 
 
 6 
 Sleepy road, lamps, 
 
 Or waxing through the fresh gates of night 
 To bird, murmuring rain. 
 
 High the sea clears me down, 
 Righteous naked, midnight, the way it blow; 
 pheromones, thou, also, me but a signal spark, 
 So after I had forgot, and blooming.
