From A Man'S Torturers' Eyes! 

 
 The shock of burning than the public yore;â€” 
 tracked their hearts among anxiety and country, 
 A Plagiarism, for rose-amber, 
 But the truth is not a kind of being dead 
 
 And a limb. No love is divine. 
 For somewhere there is no way of it: 
 Wine is an obvious shipwreck of trying to be fooled 
 To a hangnail, and nothing quite has been told, 
 Things wrestle for the night of the morning weather,
