 
 And when the garage unfolds 
 Down the darkened vale, 
 minotaur, the bears Agony: 
 war! a thumb of sky-blue thought: 
 A thing makes one sound of desire, 
 That nature and the work 
 Of the old Annabel strife, 
 And our eyes were still as the dawn.' 
 
 
 
 I'm older than a god of myths, and pre- 
 snuffing all with the spools of Babylon. 
 My own lungs are very stay'd high, 
 Like a white green half-moon,
