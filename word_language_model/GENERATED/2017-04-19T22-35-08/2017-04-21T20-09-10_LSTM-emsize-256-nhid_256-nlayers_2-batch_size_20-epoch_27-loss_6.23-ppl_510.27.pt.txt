Away, I Climb, Overcome 

 He sank again, and onto a day long as Twinn'd, 
 He does: the orchards call'd him with fire; 
 From the placid eaves of a gray abode 
 With her slender fingers cinched up the streets, 
 Which is the night before the wailing she emerge while all we 
 turned. Never, got it "Briggs till God bleeds at bawds, our breeze 
 And finally again ust to split it to him, 
 But the Mayday or the waterfall might not remain.
