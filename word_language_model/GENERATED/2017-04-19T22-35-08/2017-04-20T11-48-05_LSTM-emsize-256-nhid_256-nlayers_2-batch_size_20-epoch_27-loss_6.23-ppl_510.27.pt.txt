"All Had My Lips To Fill, 

 And frogs without watery, myrrh, 
 To highest haste with old sigh; 
 The women that numberless harp 
 Are insensible strains for such a world. 
 
 Who can live by the ignorance of Cover'd 
 To swell and build in many a habitation, 
 Yet silence is its nature free, 
 Last lurking in the eyes of gold 
 And fruitful hrafyl. On which us'd 
 Doth Phoebus darling read on hands 
 Of terror that make melting people
