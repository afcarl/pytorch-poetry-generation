 I am my cat, the same—others and the children. 
 Fell a still while I'll come to you, 
 OK, beautiful--; in my heat. 
 
 Warm wake, lolls close, 
 torn, thin, flopped over me! 
 Beware there am stars 
 I hear the play, 
 And the living trembling shades of the window 
 scythe, I had dipt the little too. 
 The wonder is the mirror streams -- I sit below 
 The street fence fluttering and I'll be—Miles down 
 The children there
