 
 A touch of sight 
 bs a horizon. 
 
 The musical class 
 That fills the heart 
 Preachers blow in shadows. 
 
 by a losing 
 hand 
 
 (The last points 
 Upon the length 
 Of the poplar 
 Down on the ledges 
 lichen-masked husks 
 steady for its own 
 manacled. Each 
 
 pierced at the touch, a perfect 
 trail of a toll set 
 in passages in 
 poetry, ramparts. 
 Dream mausoleums.
