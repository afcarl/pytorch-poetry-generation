 Then by high glance of a world I heard again 
 Between this tremulous Echoes, and then 
 With myself in eyes with the same assuaged, 
 Soon we can weep at twilight 
 On the north, swinging cloud away. 
 
 Presently we shall never be less warm and low, 
 Rick calmly strong, borne like a birth; 
 And as Maddalo, Have the mind; 
 They know why they listen faction. 
 And old ate sprouting the plaything -- 
 That soon of our hearts,
