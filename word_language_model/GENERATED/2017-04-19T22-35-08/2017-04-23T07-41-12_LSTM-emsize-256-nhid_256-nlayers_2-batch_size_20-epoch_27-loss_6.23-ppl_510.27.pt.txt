 I am I like as much as love 
 To write is a fornicating for the 
 dish of the Past, squarely, daring to be 
 thought of myself as my fate. 
 To make him now laugh and ash. 
 I like to say it's hard to be Miroslav 
 There is no place for hours for once? 
 And this is how they say something 
 about their goes. 
 
 
 
 'Twas in the whole twilight 
 they rush to the long feast,
