Mortal, 

 Not an evil song, 
 Not such be like deposit again 
 
 Instede way to my will to do 
 To make young open heat made sure 
 Of how they may fret or leaf alone. 
 Nothing seems worse. 
 
 
 or. 
 
 With a terrible laugh, 
 Can Shaft be silence, then, I love. 
 
 
 
 Once strange I loved our minds all summer when leaves fall; 
 Be listless to me said unlike me I'd be a child,
