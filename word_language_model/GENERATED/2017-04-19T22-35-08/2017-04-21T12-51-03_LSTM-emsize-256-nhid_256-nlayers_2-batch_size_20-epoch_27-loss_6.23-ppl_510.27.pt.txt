 
 And prostrate this of us yet, sifted, now, 
 tragedy! on the living sights again 
 Flows out of pray'r, 
 Through the palace, o'erflow as metal. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The House of Life: 
 
 
 The hardest passions, pulpit, Swedish and elves of water 
 hauled slipping into the red streets of feral artists 
 In memory. I feel very sick and nostalgic to put forth on 
 The backward body of the valets rubbing my blouse, 
 I see them
