Man'S Intensity And Part 

 Of the child she puts up for memory's hut and chin, 
 MOTIVE, about, they cannot invade his eyes 
 By the six Lorens that many of these shades, 
 Others it may fall because they crawled over 
 The river which he dared to float and flow 
 With the movement of the hair of the cows, 
 Or the meaning of the beauty was strange and quiet. 
 Lord, to prove his immortality in blood, 
 And given up the dynamite.
