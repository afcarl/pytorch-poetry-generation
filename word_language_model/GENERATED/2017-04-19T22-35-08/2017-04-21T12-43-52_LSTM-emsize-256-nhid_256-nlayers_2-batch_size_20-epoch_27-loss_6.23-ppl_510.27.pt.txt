 That now the shadows seeds 
 sparkle above us, 
 joie and debris and delight, 
 The easiest of his Wasp 
 Could not hang the holy flame, 
 But by length of fresh shoots on the zoo 
 The day marks wings its roots in view. 
 
 Last night the moon rose by the rim 
 Of the water, slow and folded sex--they now unsiftable 
 Down the empty hall clock, 
 manuscript; Yard reptilian, and whiskey, 
 Crossing his cattle, against a bruised sky
