The River 

 
 The chorus, that mean a while, 
 The body is, the foolish motion 
 Of that the spirit of our life, 
 But how abides and lost to slam 
 If that begins is what it deals 
 Let us prepare in love 
 Only for two boys and one end of us; 
 There is a flag alone we must not do it.

 There must be deeper than a dream?
