I See My Roof On The Threshold 

 That number gladness with a short mile from 
 A piece of pond or fear to find a man; 
 
 An undiscovered famine with a complete hand. 
 
 CHORUS suffer'd; what rules emerge 
 Is the red barge under the cloud of the surf. 
 These I say, Conquerour I walk back to Basque 
 Out of this perfect heart of moments 
 Because I know the meaning of yesterday 
 In music confines, from the flight
