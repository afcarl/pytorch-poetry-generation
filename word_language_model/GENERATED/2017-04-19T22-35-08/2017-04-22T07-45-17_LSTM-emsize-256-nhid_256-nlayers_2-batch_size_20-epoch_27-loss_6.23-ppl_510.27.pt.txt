 
 Before Juliana lived before dawn, 
 men'd a later balcony 
 Out, incontinent, I spent chords--I 
 That were erst, and a window ran, 
 Some white pieces of black wool. 
 The rip wind's weapon now 
 Gave up and telling me all! 
 But that hatchling's city; 
 The leaves, the spontaneous bird? 
 With saved foot, licking vision 
 In wasteful sadness. As I heard 
 What entered and little day: 
 The memory a soul could do more intimate. 
 
 ignobly
