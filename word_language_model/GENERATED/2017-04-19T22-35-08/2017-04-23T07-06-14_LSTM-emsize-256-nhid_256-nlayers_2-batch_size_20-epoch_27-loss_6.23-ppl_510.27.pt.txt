 
 The semitropical day and winter, and the elements. 
 When a poet launched his foot at the top of the bottle. . . 
 Moving they saw his face rising with many his fingers, and the North humming 
 sheets between onto his empathy's metal dug of the morning streets, 
 then St. John stayed to the window and galloped out the door 
 Caught in the giv'n! Room himself sons'-- 
 Mad like sugar, one looks on it stunned by the bottom of the road.
