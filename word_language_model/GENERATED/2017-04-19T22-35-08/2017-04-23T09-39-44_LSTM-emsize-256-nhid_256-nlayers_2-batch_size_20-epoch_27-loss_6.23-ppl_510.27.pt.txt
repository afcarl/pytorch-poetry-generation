We Tried 

 To hold us birth-name torture blood and yawl 
 Too past, 
 And I think your a might feel in the dearth of coal, 
 yearning, men's desires fresh-dug 
 More or less people sleep, 
 hammer or misunderstood streets along the fallen scene 
 change: I have forgotten the one in calm 
 prudent juices. I hear those 
 Gulf star-unfolding cows grow up. 
 A statue on like wagons. 
 People were trying to unhumanize everything with a 
 new copy of confusion
