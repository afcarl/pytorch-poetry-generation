 To shove across the South rotted snow 
 Before clay, having invisible, our slow, 
 Laundry and girdled swirls of gold. 
 Then alas, that the new sailors, we shall constitute 
 The nature of our daily minds, 
 Showing there is no God or none we find. 
 Oh, be vain! In mocks semblance, 
 what midnight should strangely be. 
 No man nor soul who simply lay, 
 Or how the soul needs ever in or out, 
 And by those pious Jews died
