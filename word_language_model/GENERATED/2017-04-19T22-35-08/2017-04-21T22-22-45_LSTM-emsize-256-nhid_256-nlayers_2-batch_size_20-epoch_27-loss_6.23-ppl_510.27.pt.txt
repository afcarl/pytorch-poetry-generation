Down 

 Into the blue street 
 Her whirl against the field of feathers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Noon 
 
 
 Off and down, 
 Loved explains how rapture's 
 Hola! Margery comfort, the rope and glass of summer cloud, 
 The lovers and memories 
 Of the coming hills cutting the Ore, 
 to the Charlestown splendour, 
 hearmscaa in white. 
 This is the buzzing of his hands; 
 his profile foam a seaâ€”A sight of blue 
 but his garments disappear
