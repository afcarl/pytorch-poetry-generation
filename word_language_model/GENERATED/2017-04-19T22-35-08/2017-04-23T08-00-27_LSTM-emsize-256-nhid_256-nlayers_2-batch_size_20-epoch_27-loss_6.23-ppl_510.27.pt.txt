 Over what Park, quiet, Of what can get. 
 
 The world is like no one, what can solicitation 
 From the fields of the dead, the sea of mortal. 
 He is a person who reads a list. 
 He is deep as a bookmark dawn, 
 Above the lamplit frontier 
 horsehair eastward, black and summut 
 Like a animal collar of green doghouse 
 Seeks a black puddle across the sand. 
 Then balanced innocently I went, and there is 
 A strict mood
