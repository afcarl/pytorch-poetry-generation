And Years Graves, 

 I had changed, less footpath 
 To see I cannot hold them home somewhere 
 
 Not breath.

 erpicking antique serpent, 
 stabbed like hands of sheepbell

 with their horny appearances, 
 candles it--I'm with averted rooms 
 to Anachronistic at childhood with their towels 
 and pride in their lands.
