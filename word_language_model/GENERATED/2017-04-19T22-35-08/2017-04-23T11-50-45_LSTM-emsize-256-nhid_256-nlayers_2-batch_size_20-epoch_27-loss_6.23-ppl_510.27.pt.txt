 On tunny-fish, knees Magda 
 Thrilled come upon the wintered sill, 
 A beauty which had left behind, 
 And wild from heart the thunder 
 I hear from out the midst, 
 And then the hours have come, 
 And dawning fed, to Hell and men. 
 
 We have fled at flowers? The star 
 Shakes back our age, 
 But hark! for the purple clay 
 Comes years 'gainst a stone 
 Out of the mast, I lie beside the stars.
