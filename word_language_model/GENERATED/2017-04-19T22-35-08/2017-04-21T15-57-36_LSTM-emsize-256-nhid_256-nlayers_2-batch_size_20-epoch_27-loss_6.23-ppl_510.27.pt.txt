Near At Night 

 Under the nude, or darkens crow pool, 
 Saw that of the distant sound of the sea in the mist, 
 Slips the part of that thoughts like flakes 'mid their nets, run, 
 growing like a man took the farm to a broken bird, 
 Across the trembling heads 
 
 To burn. snow paule me into the face of you. 
 His song fell to gush and turned, it red. 
 The teeth that jump like hand and millpond
