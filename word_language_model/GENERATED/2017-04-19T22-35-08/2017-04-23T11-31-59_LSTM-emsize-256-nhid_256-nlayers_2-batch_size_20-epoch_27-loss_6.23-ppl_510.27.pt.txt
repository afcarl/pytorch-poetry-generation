There Is No Trick 

 
 Than God that hath come to change with us to comprehend 
 
 That more a cloud is thereon, no manner of share, 
 
 No human sediments did light away 
 
 That nook which they anchor no more less, 
 Huddling grapes or light, and there the run 
 
 Which makes no care, but drunk with human laws 
 
 Drop to the Lampads slumbering shaped, 
 
 And makes them brave that slowly live 
 
 No cort√®ge.
