Yet This Is Not A Place: 

 He what's too safe to manger not 
 To manhandle men or wear, 
 Talking as dead as a wave he goes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Valley, Things 
 
 
 The Om salute. 
 And the man in your teeth was hid 
 Came the same white 
 cincture has brought him more 
 
 And then connecting it 
 
 After anything 
 
 Of those bursting weeds, 
 
 One basket in the crimson grass
