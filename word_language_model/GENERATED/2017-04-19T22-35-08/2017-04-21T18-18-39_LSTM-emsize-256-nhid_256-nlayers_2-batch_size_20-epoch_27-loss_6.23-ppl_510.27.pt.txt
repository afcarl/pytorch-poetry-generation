Metal Glide 

 To pieces, in flight, flatlands, soul. 
 
 Clouds drenched white as the huckley-buckâ€”Dear 
 cool'd; round the agency 
 A gas batters paper, delicate, 
 African farther rhymes. 
 
 Whereof the river's elbows thrill 
 Towards the memory like deer, 
 
 Through dying beauty here, speaks: 
 From hope from the factory shall come, 
 Neither a lovely few can neighs themselves, 
 (stitch-lettered in soft Diogenes are he 
 Whom Heaven he barks rebuff 
 On his good-will to vibrant command,
