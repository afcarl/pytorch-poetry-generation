And Out 

 Of the white and red wrist of Galilee. 
 
 Shadows of flies. 
 But in the parting air 
 The seraphim is invented, 
 The chain sputtered, 
 Love sins as the bright pulse of dew, 
 Thy house shall terrific shine 
 In fear of the blazing sea. 
 
 (So shalt thou pass the shore -- 
 And beauties of the treasure bred 
 Those words the empty sea of sheeted streit,â€” 
 Oft may the heart, and let them praise thy
