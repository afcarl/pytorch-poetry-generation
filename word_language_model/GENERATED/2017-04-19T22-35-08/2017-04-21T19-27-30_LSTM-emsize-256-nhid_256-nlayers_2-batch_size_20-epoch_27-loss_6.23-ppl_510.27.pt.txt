There I Stand, 

 Or speak, and falls to the rest: 
 There, when the look at Poesy, 
 To have I sing my voice was howling, 
 I only. But what I consider 
 Are the fellow engines and the farmer. 
 You know the story one is lost; 
 Are you the past, I've spell. You are the devil 
 That you really know she is in slipcases. 
 Do you know heâ€™d come? And she is gone. 
 The price, it's loafing in a mirror,
