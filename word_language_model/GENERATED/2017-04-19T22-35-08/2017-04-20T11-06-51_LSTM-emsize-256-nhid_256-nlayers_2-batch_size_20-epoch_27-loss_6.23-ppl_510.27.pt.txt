All Freedom Persuaded 

 In a great Term of sunshine or source. 
 A different bough the one scents of men 
 Who could not weep and waiting for the moon. 
 He infus'd into the milky water, sewing 
 Their hungry? 
 Suck any wall or flies, or like the mist, 
 Couched in a purple coat beneath the bear. 
 Or only at seven in separate line the east, 
 None of the waters of the big world ran, 
 And all the darkness groaned before
