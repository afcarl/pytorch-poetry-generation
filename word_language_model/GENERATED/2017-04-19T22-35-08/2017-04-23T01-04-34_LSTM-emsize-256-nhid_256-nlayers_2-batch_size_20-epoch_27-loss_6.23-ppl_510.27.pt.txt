 It has not been in the morning 
 I make it how impossible 
 I waft the berry into the envelope. 
 Names bloom, dulled by twos and streets, 
 Hooked close, or the foot of a blind-from-birth bark, 
 Of oxen. demobbed, or remorse 
 Of what day, when anything lost 
 From such an weather Venus, before St. age, 
 Canon the landscape in this northern night. 
 
 How could it day's supple blend of sacred fate; 
 We yet neither will hurry, much
