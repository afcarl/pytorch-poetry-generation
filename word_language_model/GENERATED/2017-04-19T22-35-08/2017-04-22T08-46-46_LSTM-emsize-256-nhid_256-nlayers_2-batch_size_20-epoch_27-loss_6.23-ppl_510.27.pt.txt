Important Ears, & 

 Afar and slip from the sky. 
 
 
 
 Tonight the Duchess is on the waveless lawn, 
 He was very, cold, and he used to die. 
 
 
 
 La Singer from the natural 
 day of cold and green 
 its eye is a form in the thudding room; 
 So, when afar the bright sun 
 That opens into the compass of the trees 
 Moving off in, it seethes in the buildings, 
 Silenced in snow and water
