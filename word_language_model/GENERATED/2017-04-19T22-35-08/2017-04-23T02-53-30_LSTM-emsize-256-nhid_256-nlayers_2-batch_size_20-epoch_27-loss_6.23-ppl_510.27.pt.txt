Give, 

 While that they are in fading rooms 
 I throw up meat crossings. 
 And since I look like my own. 
 
 Through arbiters to toil and noise, 
 To think they break the jewel of good. 
 
 Yes, in a field they fought at hand, 
 In an August sleeping hour, 
 Beloved by many despair 
 As to a place on populous armpits. 
 
 THYRSIS 
 As Eastern as the moon above clouds, 
 Put the bitter sons along the blue
