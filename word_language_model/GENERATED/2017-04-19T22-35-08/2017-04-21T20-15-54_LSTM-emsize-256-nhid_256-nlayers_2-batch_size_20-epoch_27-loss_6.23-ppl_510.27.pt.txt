All Villages That Behind; Back To Waste, 

 Feinstein-era Biograph Hazmat . . . 
 I know ominous Nokia 
 never. 
 
 I am not too large, to learn, 
 In the season I will touch my mind, 
 I should ease it in my grave, 
 Or to my hand as in a dream, 
 Or feel theological rivell'd illness 
 To some shall bruning himself. 
 
 
 
 An infant tug with a cherry vault 
 And a feather drum at the beach.
