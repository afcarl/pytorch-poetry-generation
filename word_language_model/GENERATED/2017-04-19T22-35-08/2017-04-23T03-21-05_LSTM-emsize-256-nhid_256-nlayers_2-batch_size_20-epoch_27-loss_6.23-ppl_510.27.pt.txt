 in halyards, not here is 
 anyway 
 or anything of you, 
 though this 
 is a Hock under 
 habits of coffee and dying de 
 faces that lie 
 on a planet in knife so a tremor 
 that arrived in the rubble 
 disc into the channel. 
 In sounding windy evening, 
 
 certain November upriver, 
 Led from the spot the lake, the 
 silver ears of braces like golden toy 
 in the ruined hours of the Almightie 
 door
