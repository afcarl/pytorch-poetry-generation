A Longing. 

 
 But she was means pain for, man. 
 
 But my father loved the man 
 At night among the men and unknown. 
 What let me know? 
 Try to say you'll have it 
 Time's problem it was my life. 
 
 And did I wear your very pretty birthday, 
 It was too late, no other Heaven meant, 
 Lonely and shivering as the sun, 
 When you put my hand onto the bed 
 So up did - 
 And
