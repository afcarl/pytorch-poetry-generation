 Gives them a face upon the bow: 
 But in spite of an accouchement! 
 It is blared, and poetry is there 
 Quietly shoot about the stars that shake 
 has ciphers, its own course is turning

 of the merriment that bred? 
 And how our lives are in those limits of their content 
 
 They long for breath to reverse with this sound
