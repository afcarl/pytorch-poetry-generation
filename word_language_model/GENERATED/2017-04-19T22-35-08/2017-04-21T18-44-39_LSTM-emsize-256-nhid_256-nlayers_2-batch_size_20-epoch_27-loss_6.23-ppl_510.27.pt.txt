 To study an orbit of one life. 
 I fear the words must be that day 
 I will do so it was no longer account, 
 When I walked, I blow it bare 
 Throwing my stick out countryman I spent 
 Ideals with sister all all autumn 
 And my nights are lifted 
 At the cadmium of a time, 
 Pray later in the banks 
 I see the deer 
 the streets, bloody 
 man, and less 
 swinging my down,
