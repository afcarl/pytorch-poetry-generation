 And closes it up. 
 
 The sills is ascension and light, 
 The laser sheet of the waves' potential, 
 re-risen, life's reason to recall; 
 The old-fashioned ones, quiet, never too 
 wooed us upwards with abundance 
 that would be won and ceasing; 
 
 
 
 bets, Beginning with dodge 
 The regard of Tide sounds so 
 Wonder on language, while the silky wound, 
 Aught shall discover a word, another lamb, in a grave, 
 
 cardinals who stand in bed
