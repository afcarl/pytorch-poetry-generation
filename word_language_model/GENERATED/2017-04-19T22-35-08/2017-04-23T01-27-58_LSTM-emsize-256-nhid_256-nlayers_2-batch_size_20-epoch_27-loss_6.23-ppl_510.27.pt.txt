That Life!' 

 It made up and from out ground do lie 
 Slowly that frames the field of warm gold. 
 
 And in its region the iron hum 
 Of maple waters have a gradual pool, 
 Just like the fruit, the meadows call 
 Like a calf that we could love discovered 
 In a savage heart that dissolves the fair man, 
 And this, dear indifference is so there is, 
 And even only a second wedding, you say, 
 And settled forever then
