Its Own Slow Mattress 

 Anti-ontology-- through 
 the current so high on a column, 
 
 a splash in silk mirrors 
 
 before people, passing another frequently 
 unseen, and none, no, no, Love answered, 
 news of winter, Power, merely lulls. 
 or gay shapes, my pain runs down. 
 
 I'm not the oldest place but just looking up 
 for you, from where I wanted to know. . 
 
 you see it in your mouth? The night moved by. 
 This bus.
