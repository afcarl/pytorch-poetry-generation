From Mortal Had I Contact. 

 A dime got backward instead a knife 
 ain't vanished down 
 Stopped like the Warrior-Angel Fred fails 
 Then took his balance in a chair, 
 And he's proud of it then, to please you loved 
 And beat the violence of mearcstapa, Gunga Brown, 
 Tho' I should do my seed. 
 
 Still as did they 
 see those arching heights like heart; 
 Are they calculated from common things, 
 Wherever they were then knew--looks more grief,
