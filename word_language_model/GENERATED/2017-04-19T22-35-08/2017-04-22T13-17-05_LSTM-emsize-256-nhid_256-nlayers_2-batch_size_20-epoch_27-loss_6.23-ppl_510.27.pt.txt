 
 There was a whole fact: 
 I needed the last thing to keep, 
 An instrument o' beauty I say 
 My own dear life, and if not pervaded 
 The exact pleasure of the earth, 
 Well fair my sole to mount again 
 In Africa by my foul life. 
 
 Oh, God, that God, in me there are 
 From somewhere, not as a small 
 King Absolut on those small masks 
 A glad word or a bachelor or some 
 pal
