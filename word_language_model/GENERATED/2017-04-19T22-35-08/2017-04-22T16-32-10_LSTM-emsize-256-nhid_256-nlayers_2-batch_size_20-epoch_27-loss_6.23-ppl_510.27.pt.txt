Shroud, This Democrat-Load Malpractice. 

 
 And lie you up in tears of hills 
 Come down in solitary hats, 
 Bring me the last of a stick 
 Profusely to trap and spread 
 Your pains so quickly so fair 
 You leave you Wednesday,—yes—but how it ended here 
 Now roam. The trunk came to the birds 
 And head so hugged your coat to Gate; 
 Not so, not fish on visions of the hills 
 Laughed away and heard the peak so it came
