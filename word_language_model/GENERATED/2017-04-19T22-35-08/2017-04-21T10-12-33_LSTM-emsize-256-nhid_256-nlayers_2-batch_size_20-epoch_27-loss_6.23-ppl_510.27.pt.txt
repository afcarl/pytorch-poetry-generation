"It Is So Full Of Life, 

 Souls of revolts by pity, and of course 
 The Forget small, 
 arcanum were not all my own. 
 
 Yet the world were downward to once, 
 And the heat-hazed died waist 
 Which would feel call'd once passing, read. 
 The word that nothing but to freshness away. 
 
 Tomorrow they hugged business 
 No thoughts dissolve my eyes 
 With timeless eye and hands 
 
 As I came back 
 Not to mourn you
