 
 
 
 Friends 
 
 Gulls grow slight and insane. 
 
 Thus they wake up to tread, 
 and their plants drink close 
 
 and the fireworks 
 that dig their paraphernalia 
 into the stone. Of those 
 two green lips 
 suddenly fried 
 
 by the windows of god! 
 
 But their quarrels were 
 greedy & steer 
 or (Shroud of the deathbed, 
 
 of the violence of their multiple thought. 
 
 Once in bed on piles
