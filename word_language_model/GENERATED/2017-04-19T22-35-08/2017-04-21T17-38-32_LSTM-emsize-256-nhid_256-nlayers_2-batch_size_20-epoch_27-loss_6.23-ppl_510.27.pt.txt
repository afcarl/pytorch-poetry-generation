 
 What's about leave in Paradise 
 In first) the chaos Cabezn 
 A burnish'd diverted for the dead. 
 
 For soon the very bull will take 
 A nameless committee 
 Or beneath an ugly least; 
 Look! with yellow and narrow, 
 massacred. tapestries of finest fiddle-- 
 Box of circular words 
 And withdrew: like joy from Hypothetical 
 Brother Sam's to end 
 orange and gruesome dying. 
 But the sea is darkened 
 with a lie of sudden herring 
 islands
