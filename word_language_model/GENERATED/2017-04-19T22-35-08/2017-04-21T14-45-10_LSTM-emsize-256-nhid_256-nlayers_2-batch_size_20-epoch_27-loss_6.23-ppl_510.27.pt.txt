 To you unto the wailing kiss, Andrea 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Damp alchemized: Memory fresh Heart 
 
 
 trasparent 
 six beaches. 
 
 shone; flashing past you 
 
 More 
 like Stain the Starry Seal 
 collision into the people. 
 
 
 
 
 O quickening land that rim in April, black 
 and struggling inside grips 
 and half again go back and forth 
 
 Down the long nights, another feeling 
 Cit-- to some or less Vestals,
