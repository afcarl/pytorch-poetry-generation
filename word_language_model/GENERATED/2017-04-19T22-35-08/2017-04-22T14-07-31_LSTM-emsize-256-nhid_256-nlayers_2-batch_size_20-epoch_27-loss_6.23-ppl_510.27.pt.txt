Bones, 

 
 While sweet and dead 
 Be as humans valiant, 
 And the ocean's disrepute. 
 Wi' open blood and flowers that never bore. 
 
 My wheels in the air 
 By the sea stars might make it." 
 Speak behind or winter goes, 
 description: you send me this 
 To one, down as Spring from the steep 
 And the wind above; then the platform 
 Cannot see it and be high 
 Unless it happened, 
 And the name that I know,
