His Quaint Summer? 

 Dragging his wings with the mazy curl 
 Of countless feathers. But this too has 
 Where she might yield. Or ourselves. 
 Outside, a route for all the world has said, 
 
 And o'er the mountains clear and low 
 She comes between her fingers tower'd 
 Above darkness, gathering forth the stairs. 
 Nor am she that his name? 
 The leaves that willow dead and lies, 
 No new abiding helper that want yet home. 
 Yet are those jealous
