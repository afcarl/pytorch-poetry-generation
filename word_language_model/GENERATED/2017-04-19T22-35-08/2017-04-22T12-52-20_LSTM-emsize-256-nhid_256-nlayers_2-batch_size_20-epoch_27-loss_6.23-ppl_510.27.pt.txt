The Intimacy Engage, 

 As clear as the splendors of the Aged bait; 
 
 Girl on her wing rose she heard love's flower, 
 Where the vapor were thronged and stark. 
 Her eyes dragged farewell as it turned his, 
 The waves returns for dead and weeping, 
 But she made ice breath On hinges new. 
 This passion is de soldier's shrine, 
 But not the great (not living come to die.
