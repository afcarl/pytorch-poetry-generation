The Roan Edge, 

 Where are my deadly friends, 
 And no such water has been made from a cold 
 riverman wants to go to street. 
 I'll have to call all three punches 
 That I should never know, 
 I have had stepped through air. 
 Without thought. I do not think 
 I wish I could send away the following 
 Making its glories free of existence, 
 I 've proved well this funny least, 
 The best of eternity, 
 New unkindled Don
