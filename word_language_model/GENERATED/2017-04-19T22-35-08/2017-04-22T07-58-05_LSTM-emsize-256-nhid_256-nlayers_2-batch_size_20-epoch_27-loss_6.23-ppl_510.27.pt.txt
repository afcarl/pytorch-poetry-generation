 There is something arrows of rest, 
 The hands of trash are dissolved in sleep. 
 
 The wind is closing world, 
 Born that the river, here is also dissolved 
 Over the Wife's in the greening barn, 
 The staring dumb, and the fiery whine of life, 
 And the hawk settles in the red cloud of the horn, 
 And the secret bound for the gnawing palm 
 and its sluggish floors move air-cooled toward the last, 
 
 Only a tunnel, a sign
