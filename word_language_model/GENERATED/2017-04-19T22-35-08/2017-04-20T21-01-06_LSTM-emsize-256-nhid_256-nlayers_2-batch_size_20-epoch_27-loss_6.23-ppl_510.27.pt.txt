 
 Then open laughter, 
 Appear in the closest blankets, 
 Descants the work of a wife. 
 
 And why, I weep for my name, 
 And to a moment as a heart's 
 To a lady's end, 
 To eat that tempted every word: 
 I am slow to my love in the sea 
 When my mind is not a remedy, 
 I have torn a bit at the tree. 
 
 
 
 Iâ€™m darkness so All that I was near it,
