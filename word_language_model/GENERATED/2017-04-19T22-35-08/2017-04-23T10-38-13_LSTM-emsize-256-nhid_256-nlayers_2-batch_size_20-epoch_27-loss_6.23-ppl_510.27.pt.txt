Up 

 In the basin in Forerunners of 
 Of the dubious seed: 
 The bedew. or ultimate fugue 
 Of face, to bury the vagrant page. 
 
 There the world is integrally 
 What some ill; boyes, or crowdedness or Fate, 
 tie-up fearfully,—how happiness 
 Or superior knowledge. 
 They sit in the way to see 
 Of the good loo)k 
 As a day’s crescent cymbals 
 Have delivered the distant questions. 
 jn . . . 
 And will all the complicated webs.
