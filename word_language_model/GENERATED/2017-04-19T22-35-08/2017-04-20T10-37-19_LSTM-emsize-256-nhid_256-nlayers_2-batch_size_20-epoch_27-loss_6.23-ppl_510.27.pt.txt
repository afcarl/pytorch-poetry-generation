The Role Of Death 

 With body broke, in blue-wing skill'd, 
 Haste to be fully understood. 
 
 See it ratt'ling in ivy ease, 
 Thro' morning's crystal snow and snow, 
 In the pale pine profound night, 
 Give out the tones of love for me! 
 
 
 
 It will not be a happy intelligence 
 even the world is stuck in a smile 
 like the other, whether the evidence 
 of possibility is poetry 
 to be easier as an arm on
