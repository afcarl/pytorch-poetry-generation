Wilt Thou This? 

 If thou yet let me cleave or be thy Man? 
 
 But when thy tongue burst asleep, the grain appears, 
 And from my grasp thy kinder thrall 
 Made division in my grave, thy tears too were: 
 Then every corner I will replied, 
 My dear, though soft in hope should bind 
 Our song, and let there never forget, 
 When by the sun and stars did care 
 But once again alert remember 
 Those that have Numbers. and
