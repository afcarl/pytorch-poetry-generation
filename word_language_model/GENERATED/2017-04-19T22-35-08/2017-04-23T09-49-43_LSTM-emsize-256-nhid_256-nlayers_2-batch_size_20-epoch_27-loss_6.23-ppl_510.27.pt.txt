 Ring-around-the-rosy, and 
 Slow, last bear? 
 In the hour when a few jumping out 
 I shut them, any witch's couple can taunt 
 a maze. So much in hand, just 
 something then. The streets and genitals 
 speak load? needs they ludicrous, 
 saying -- my faith, why is not the good will, 
 when once you stand, borrowed formal rooms, hiss 
 from a furrow air on the hill under 
 each wave below Buildings pearl and dust in Birch fog-hung 
 flimsy.
