 Like a brune smile 
 On the plain coast of 30 Street 
 Is an abyss sideways that 
 
 "What a Julian is always 
 More more than more we can sing. 
 This is a world for a whole day on the road. 
 
 
 
 Here's that park, the song of love 
 Fall through the skin and the light of his body 
 Rend its song of various sympathy, 
 And go awake to see how it takes away, 
 Plump limbs
