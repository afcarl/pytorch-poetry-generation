To Find Fracture, 

 rabid rape is what we say from the common river, 
 a mere Zeus sent green roses, 
 
 She knows she is young as part 
 and consider that stern puddle no tramp, no wind can fly. 
 
 Soon it will be, too long snow before it trembles again. 
 
 A woman is sitting on her snow-white tongue 
 West, which is her ray, the first number of bird, 
 And still we are meant to make Fields 
 of mazes
