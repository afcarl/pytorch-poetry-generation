To Look 

 Lake, the cold Hesperides 
 of days, pulled from where 
 
 you think. 
 
 A coffee, atheistical, 
 If the night turned antheming 
 Mikayla knots, she jingles 
 her magic dreams, as she was near 
 her promise, the one the watercolor 
 paused to plate. 
 
 The lazy long-gone veyne 
 in the crack of the heart 
 Weir-- All law, cloudes and activity? 
 aboot, the message between her 
 tail and then device. 
 Mr. Scarlett! gull
