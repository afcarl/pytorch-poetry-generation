Fall 

 Among the booming leaves, 
 
 The longing of the Santa century is heard 
 To plan myself of lovers seek just a stone. 
 In the blaze of a curling meadow, it dies on complain 
 For the world's good wars, and the cyanide and the pride of war, 
 Last air that laad from the memories of the East, 
 The voice of the stone and the Via 
 Staining the end. 
 
 What is why; have you felt, he would stave me
