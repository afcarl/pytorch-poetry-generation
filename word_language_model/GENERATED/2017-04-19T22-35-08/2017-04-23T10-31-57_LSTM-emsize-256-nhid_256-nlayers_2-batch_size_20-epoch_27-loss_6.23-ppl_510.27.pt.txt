The Left, 

 White yet at the window in the white? 
 See the voices of night 
 Tomb to be listening so far back 
 To not have it seen, 
 And lifting the wrinkled hall and look back adores 
 By the Smack! houses. 
 
 But who will say once, chasing it down, Weapons bold, 
 The litter of Englandâ€”they and build the voice 
 Around himself, a territory is a taken. 
 At these there in their shadows we start. 
 Where is all
