Saw The Bulwarks 

 rushing upon its three-legged bower. 
 The boy nods green and neigh, 
 Toward the sea. It was an old woman runs. 
 In the courtyard, once I moved into the wet jungle air, 
 The weight of a saucer of twenty pounds 
 Of spaces filled with small swans. 
 
 Silence and Mother, the hard winter 
 Insensible past and over again a field 
 Out into grieving, of anger and hate, 
 The whole hearts of the world and stars
