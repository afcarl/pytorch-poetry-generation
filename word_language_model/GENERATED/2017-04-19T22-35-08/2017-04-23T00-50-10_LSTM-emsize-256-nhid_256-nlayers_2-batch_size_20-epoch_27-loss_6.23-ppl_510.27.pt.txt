From The Country Photo, 

 'cause "The e-flat 
 alight: the land, along the hills boat-head 
 Like light that can scale ... two years ago, 
 From whose presence streets what time becomes 
 To learn, fire-ball of print that spoils elsewhere 
 Hill humid: rt; the posterity? rick-rack 
 Fly images. All which they slide 
 On the #1, crowd's "Here to infarcted outer lakebed, 
 Flies hammerin' all harvest-time Rivers 
 With a shudder of frondage wives. 
 
 And goes on the backyard shadow
