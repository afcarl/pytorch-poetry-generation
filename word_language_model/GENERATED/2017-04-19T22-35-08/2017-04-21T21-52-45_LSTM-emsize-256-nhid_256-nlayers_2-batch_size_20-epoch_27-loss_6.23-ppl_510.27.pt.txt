 This is the Robo-Boy Captain 
 Boomed from the meadows 
 From his high defense: 
 
 Mostly the owl intrusive. 
 As a boy white cake 
 Behind the gas Mississippi 
 loves smooth, beetles; 
 But not your tragedy 
 Be 
 No 
 
 Any lava, they run friends in 
 With your body later 
 
 Your mind doesn't bother. 
 
 And you 
 Were 
 someone 
 Who hasn't told you right else, 
 Did they turn 
 Across a hole
