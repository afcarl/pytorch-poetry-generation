 
 Sparrow, all time, 
 a fancy human sleep, 
 I feel my prince of prayer. 
 
 The sun is thick and gray, 
 I call no thrill of you 
 wrong. 
 
 
 
 Diane outrage. 
 
 O, works for thy approaching flesh, 
 What is it thy false lewd pinnace 
 Is here! Do not alter that? 
 Why should you chrysolite 
 And who can taste thy finger deceive 
 That sin which in your soul sings my soul; 
 Forgetting
