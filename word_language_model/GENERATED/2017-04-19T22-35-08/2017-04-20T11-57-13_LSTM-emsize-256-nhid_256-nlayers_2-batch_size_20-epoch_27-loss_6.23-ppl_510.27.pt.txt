 
 The thread Arabian and the decor-- 
 lowered, and twigs, who've lit 
 by their feet. And, two are weeks 
 bisides, that broken night, 
 buffs rope and sorry 
 they drift and admire the ragged sky 
 and the bones of England flying 
 in the wet southern desert 
 and the light glowing spins monstrous 
 around the tops of our guardians rise 
 
 their portion of them like a nest 
 of light at eucalyptus, even when 
 merely you drove,
