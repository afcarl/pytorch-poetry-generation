All) It So, All My Life. 

 Who give I'll mine, like a wanderer on set of Jains 
 empty poetry. 
 No knowing how the museum flows 
 
 then that does not begin to sleep 
 still, shining in lighting death over anorak. 
 Stonemason door that mute nomadic flow 
 squint. This is where it's burning. 
 
 
 
 A wind lived in a happy soldier, 
 But steps not, putting rain away, 
 Burns there. Through the meadow; 
 No sound can reveal
