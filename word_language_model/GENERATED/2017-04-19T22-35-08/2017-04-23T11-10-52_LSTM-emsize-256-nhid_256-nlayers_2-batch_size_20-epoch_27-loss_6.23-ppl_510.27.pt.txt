 The deep "degree, mystery— 
 Ha, supple, visible—for true; 
 And hyls pauses the lilac deeps. 
 Whiles palmetto men flung hues, and the loyal pack 
 Of the Soul— long gone behind. 
 
 The dark tunnels hoisted at night, 
 As the world resembles to play, 
 And the young man that descended after, 
 The turntail Boy in Beams of Christian Instructor's 
 Red and ancient neigh, as Father’s after-hold 
 To himself thrown forth from every side; 
 The horn and hands gone
