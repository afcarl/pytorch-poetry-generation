Softly Bending 

 My sweetest relief, 
 mastered you, I with my plaintive glee 
 thought? Back 
 
 New Mexico 
 
 
 
 I have stolen my love to trim 
 Archipelago like an identity to 
 
 Go buy, never will the eyes 
 And torture this I want to exist. 
 I might have been shocked days 
 I'd really write I can get you 
 Because Iâ€™m nowhere of others. 
 Death would hold me still safe here 
 
 With a leaf
