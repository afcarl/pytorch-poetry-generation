 
 Gently wherever afternoon lies 
 But it was bare and rare 
 And it rode back to this cell of loss. 
 
 It looked like a shadow. 
 
 You love it 
 And when one day I was a Christmas baby, 
 And turned numb the tarnish in the hills 
 Like tissue, looking hard at the small poplars, 
 I could not see, it was mostly the hot way. 
 
 Lush woods did not go or rats 
 Do it deaden there's
