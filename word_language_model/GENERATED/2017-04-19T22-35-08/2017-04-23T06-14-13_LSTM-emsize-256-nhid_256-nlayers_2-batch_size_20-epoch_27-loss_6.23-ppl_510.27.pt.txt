An Eternal Channeled. 

 
 Across the bay with rocks 
 I hate stigon; pouring up the rush 
 of the ice, a wing that am black 
 and no one Joachim. Words that flee, 
 pinches them, Laetitia. 
 Aren't you between me, metallic pleating dog-fighting 
 past the white, searching for me 
 with my cattle-tracks inside them as moodily outward, 
 beneath the small wreath of teeth. You can 
 look so away, like merry-go-round deflowered 
 hooks of a star that's repeated.
