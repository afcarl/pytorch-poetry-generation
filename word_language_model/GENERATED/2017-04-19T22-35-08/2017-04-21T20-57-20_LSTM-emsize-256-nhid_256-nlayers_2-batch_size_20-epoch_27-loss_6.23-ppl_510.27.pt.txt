Your Time Is A Sure Soul, 

 Days have taught us shend, if it still hope 
 Against the freeways in the continent 
 Of the Old Tavern who tend to their own 
 "Let him to declare when for one spirit act 
 away, their waving babble returned 
 To business, Time and be said; 
 How should we die, and walk like solemnity." 
 
 You'll hurry away in glass of your hands original sign, 
 But still air translates shadowed to burn, 
 Took dancing
