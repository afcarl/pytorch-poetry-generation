Old Statuary. And Smiling Now, 

 Oh solitude, but give me of same love, 
 And check my virtue, and your life and pride 
 Could seek a growing form, stretching a spear 
 Till to be on the moonlit ground of snow 
 Sometimes came rest, to see the budding world 
 My mountain feet before me roll, 
 (A running meteor shell without relief. 
 O, the old world will rest its rosy bloom to mine, 
 Then on its dancing windows wake and hushed
