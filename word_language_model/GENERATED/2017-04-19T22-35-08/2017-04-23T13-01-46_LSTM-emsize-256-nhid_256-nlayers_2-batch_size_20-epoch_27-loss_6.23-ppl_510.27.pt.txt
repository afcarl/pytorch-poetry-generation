Still Downcast 

 at his command. My limbs 
 ain't fondle with the things/ 
 
 And with blood-sugar & hunted. 
 
 I meditate with a name for his forgiveness 
 Just as he was. 
 
 My bellyâ€™s our sorrows worshiped knows, 
 Since then the country was high and pastoral blinked, 
 And yet, when neither shades nor curious things can pass, 
 No reason so Quakes 
 If now grow more deaf, be desire and care? 
 Remembering rather that will enter all,
