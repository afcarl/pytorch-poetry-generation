Slave On Fixed Relics 

 The last thing from within, just listening 
 To the madness in a sullen sky, 
 For a distant spot must be calling sweet 
 And wonder as to make sense round of life? 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Baa, Sun 
 
 
 
 Over thy gift there and among 
 My mother's ashes I could never bust 
 Of time and looking over at the wheel 
 And make all one, there in the world of thee.
