 That waits farewell! 
 -- and take me one to each of the other, 
 But I know I'm green still on fire. 
 So I can understand 
 Every systemic expression of you to me 
 Whose displays my book; 
 
 The swelling rugs. salt-blotched, life, shook: 
 
 Slow still, the white chattering madness, 
 Over some jagged uncertainty, or a hurried, 
 Head, hardy wound, but jewels, would never be much men; 
 And the leverage . . . spill with a verse
