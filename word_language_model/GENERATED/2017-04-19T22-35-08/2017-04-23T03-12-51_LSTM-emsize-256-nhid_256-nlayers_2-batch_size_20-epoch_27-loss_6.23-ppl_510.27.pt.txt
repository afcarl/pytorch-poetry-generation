 I write through above freedom in the public 
 rainstorm out against the smoking many-moving City 
 light where I need you carry a twig no sea lights, 
 or no tree grows immense and ready as the ash has shut me 
 and down the river, it was struck by the galley from nyghtes lines 
 from your powerful voices and no day, onto the vines 
 
 the stones tremble for themselves in each sound of the mind we dig on it 
 even though
