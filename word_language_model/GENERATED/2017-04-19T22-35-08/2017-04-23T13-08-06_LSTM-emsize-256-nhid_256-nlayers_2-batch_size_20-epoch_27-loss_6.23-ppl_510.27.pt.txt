 But Ajax and Charters 
 Bones unlaminated 
 That Drooping standing in the storm-- 
 
 In a yawning goodness 
 Morning fills with faint pollen waiting, 
 refusing to become the sound of a wreath 
 Have once while CATALYZING not the names; 
 
 The hand's circle like schooners 
 
 Which shared each, heavy and bleeding 
 As the flowers begin to manifest 
 A little more for all of what it 
 Was for, ours in the sense 
 We have loved you
