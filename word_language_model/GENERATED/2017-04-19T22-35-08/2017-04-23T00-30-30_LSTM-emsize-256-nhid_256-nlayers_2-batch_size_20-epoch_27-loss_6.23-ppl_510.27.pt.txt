 
 Still unfold friendship, green concrete gray 
 And lakes and sprinkled ridges 
 
 Are all deserted in a day. 
 Accusation, sight of me will be loved, 
 For full of their children are still 
 Wise to others. 
 
 
 
 Three centuries evaporates through chains, 
 their little daughter sticks rolls them down, 
 
 turning from a limb whose back begins 
 thinking sounds, a civil quick chance to break the smile of perfume. 
 What rips a formal shag
