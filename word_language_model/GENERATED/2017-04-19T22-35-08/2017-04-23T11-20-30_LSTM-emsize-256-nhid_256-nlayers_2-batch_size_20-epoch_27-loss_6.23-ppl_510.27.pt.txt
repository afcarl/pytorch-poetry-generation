Tomorrow, Though It Was Time To Go, 

 How had it not to fall by death 
 And sat that at whose feet the same way was gone. 
 That beautiful bed me in blood, 
 In an angel where the sea 
 Was swept into white. 
 The belfry-tower of garbage; 
 Enough over the wish for feel were chasing 
 Into numbness than pine 
 
 Around me left so cold - 
 Fable, yet kin 
 Of a lately? 
 But the altar-curtains hung
