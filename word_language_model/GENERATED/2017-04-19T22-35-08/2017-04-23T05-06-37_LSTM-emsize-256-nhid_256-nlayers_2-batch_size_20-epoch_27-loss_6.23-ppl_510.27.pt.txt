And One 

 Who had gone o'er the bridge and said 
 Watch the lashes tear home and lay 
 But they like the four birds 
 Rather than science 
 As his eyes go? 
 Comparisons return and look down 
 geomore, dust so acid on his way, 
 For buttocks, the toes and the reeds glide, 
 Ne'er recognized, the hole in his own, unpremeditated 
 Thine beams and youths but still Strangler 
 I know him be.
