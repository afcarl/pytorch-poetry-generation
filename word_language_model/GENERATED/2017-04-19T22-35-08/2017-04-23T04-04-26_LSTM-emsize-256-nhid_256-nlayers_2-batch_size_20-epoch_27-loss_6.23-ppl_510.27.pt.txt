 Who would say to me, 
 Are you whining to been so? 
 Got the way that move, 
 The beauty of losing them shine. 
 On the long aisles I saw it stare 
 Before I'm alone, 
 And more clearly than a plan 
 To know you heard, 
 You can't have faith to, 
 And having written you in perfection 
 With my life, and to me your Mother, 
 Twenty years I begin wearing 
 To blow your arms around my lakes.
