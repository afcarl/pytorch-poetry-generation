 
 But the wind will fall from the dark. 
 See it will take run-- 
 So many poppies enter 
 In a long shadow that flutters 
 And fills through creeping views 
 Shall bring up our path to the moon; 
 To one skimpy blue eye 
 Soon the time can forbear to be.

 I am a theory of power 
 And a dream of people like missing hymns, 
 And some of it is just a rugâ€”
