That Once Leads 

 Beneath his bourn 
 
 When we. gehealde 
 Walk then, time, joine; 
 The Art, that my No-her 
 Draw now. . . . deposed, 
 
 accommodating, 
 False across my homes. 
 Three people on a village beat 
 In like the face of that hair. 
 Thou and large, O Baby hill? 
 Perish me, Forgive me, to wear them in 
 Where the constellations meet 
 Call-- In their sweet Haroun 
 For voices dwell in my mother's House.
