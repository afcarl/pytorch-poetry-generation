Down 

 Among the flesh that got straight 
 From the birth caught 
 The sound of drery gales 
 Or sugar feet. Though it became 
 Golden by the great grip 
 Of life in the fireplace. 
 
 The fly is full, the three settling 
 On the granite board of the schooner. 
 The jungle is not to blame. 
 The water stops. 
 Our squirrel are nothing. 
 It's raining to know? 
 No sign of spirit starts but our box 
 Is left
