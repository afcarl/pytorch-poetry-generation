 So great all so far 
 And open donde human Work, 
 As lightly as the Hollywood 
 
 brave! San'Angelo, by the hempen wind, 
 But he turns, singing & away. 
 
 Pale, sped in for the certain, he wears 
 His chain with merry idolatry. 
 So many days in his glance 
 Is better than the elementary man, 
 And there over, they had ventured back 
 snakes; and limp, soon he poet. 
 
 And every friend on a cheek is nice
