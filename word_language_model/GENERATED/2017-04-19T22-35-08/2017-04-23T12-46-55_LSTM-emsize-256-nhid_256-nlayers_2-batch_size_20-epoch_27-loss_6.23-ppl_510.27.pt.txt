 And that thing created 
 And through its narrow air 
 They'll be rescued from the same 
 Negation and leaf flakes 
 
 
 
 Words sing only the modern fire, 
 Turning the skinny hours to the gate. 
 Call people--manners the sun-flooded diligence, 
 And dying, to be lustreless Re-arrange 
 
 Going up at the freeways who would 
 Forever survive, why did the place 
 And propped for our lives; 
 But Echoing jeweler. When gold are 
 Clattering in the background
