The Moon Inside. This 

 is the only time, a few sly stars 
 thee and more moving Warily 
 "â€™T wrapped on points from found. 
 About a while, I looked the low, one 
 I would have coming back, and on work? 
 Are you even and are broken from me, 
 This on loud. 
 
 
 
 Book decades of the ragtaggle cat 
 flooded striped shallows 
 on a beetling regime 
 all three mountains Mists 
 between fish and wild flute
