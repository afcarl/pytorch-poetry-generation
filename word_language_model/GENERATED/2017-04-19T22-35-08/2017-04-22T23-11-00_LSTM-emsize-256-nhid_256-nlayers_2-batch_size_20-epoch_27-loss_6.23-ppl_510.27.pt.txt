To Light 

 asp in a vision, all seemed again; 
 
 O was you alone. We rise, death of lust 
 A journey 
 Tender to. 
 You hang down, 
 Slipped free 
 upon this steel 
 bus, grow;â€” 
 freestyle, chaps-- 
 Into the chimney.

 There is no porcelain room with my name 
 Each of us and both together 
 There be the one who was falling in sleep, 
 anticipates, until divided by day she could go a-Maying.
