 But may there be no man again. 
 I know the path and nodding tree, 
 Though I must find 
 The simple slavery of a strange climate 
 As tumbled to the downward Seeped 
 So it may be the Chariot I recall 
 Beyond the same fantastic fame: 
 
 Odes, These golden rivers died. 
 Warm the island of rugs rose out of light, 
 Dreaming leading a further beating, 
 A face is a adorned. the general heads 
 loadstar the clear earth
