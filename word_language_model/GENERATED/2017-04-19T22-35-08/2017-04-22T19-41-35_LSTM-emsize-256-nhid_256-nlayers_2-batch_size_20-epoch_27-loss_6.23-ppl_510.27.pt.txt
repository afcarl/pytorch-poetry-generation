Chanting Over 

 The Great upstanding cloud-film 
 
 And the iron Blues made 
 an agrees: battered school 
 in a tiny mole. 
 
 
 
 Fluffer taper in the dark 
 of night, the world's layer, it is losing 
 you jump in the sky 
 and the corn burns everywhere 
 the echo runs into its mouth. 
 
 Oh Laredo too, myriad, 
 
 No, you cannot recall, 
 it would fall out: but not 
 to have its delectable own 
 Charity,
