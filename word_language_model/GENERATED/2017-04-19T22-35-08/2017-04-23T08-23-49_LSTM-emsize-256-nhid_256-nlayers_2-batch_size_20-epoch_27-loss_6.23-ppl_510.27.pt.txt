Young, 

 This is misunderstood. 
 I need the truth that I saw he would ring 
 To drove out either evening king, 
 As he would see the two-fold swarm me on the sheet. 
 He said: Spying caught his share. 
 
 The bird was mended to his gnawing eyes, 
 And reached the windows, where he lectured his face 
 And took his blood. And this one could have seen 
 A million rattling horses in the flesh. 
 
 They had no children growing
