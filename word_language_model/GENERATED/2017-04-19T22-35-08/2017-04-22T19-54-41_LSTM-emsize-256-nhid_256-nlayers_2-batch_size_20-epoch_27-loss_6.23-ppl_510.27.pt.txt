Between Us: 

 (they somehow hastened the good century. 
 
 No, but I did not place a little. 
 But somehow I don't know. We thought our bane, 
 indicator shocks, to come, if you die. 
 
 No doubting, I sink in my car parasol 
 I talk without a word 
 When the others tell me to say I must be good 
 presumed, around clone semitones 
 I may die Jim live with care, 
 And people too long for the shrink.
