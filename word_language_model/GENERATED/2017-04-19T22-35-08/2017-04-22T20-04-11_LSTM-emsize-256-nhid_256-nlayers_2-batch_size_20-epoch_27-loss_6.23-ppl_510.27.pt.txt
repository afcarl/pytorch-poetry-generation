 
 The work of love, the harbour influence. 
 Each like a corpse an centre of spot, 
 Through the bright Oxus, so later. 
 
 
 
 At the place of August, where I began, 
 my body to fall in grace, 
 Listen, Said'st that it differs 
 My dark despite the Holiest 
 From behind each lonely strains 
 
 And Mr. del Christ, 
 Rear very subdued, 
 You'd have a chorus, 
 
 A dog through a gown that might be quiet.
