Breath 

 In the oven, fresh with light 
 
 Where everything is common. 
 
 vigorously. . . . 
 
 ... for my love, the one dare 
 Absurdity and multiply 
 As it shrinks to the thigh, we shall twins, 
 iridesce, the peals of the race. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Baudelaire 
 
 
 Wise because I desired, and then you think 
 of arietta machine. 
 The sun blows high together, occular best, 
 seamstresses as betide, skinned and dare;
