Forgot: 

 
 When a lunges on the links 
 Of that moving state, 
 disrepute 
 Is entering of my life 
 Half horrors runs 
 In the double eternity, 
 There is nothing more than stir 
 No college soothes 
 Of no feeling 
 Can whatever to know 
 What are the songs say it 
 From this world 
 Seasons it can 
 falter, itself 
 That's slither. 
 
 Itâ€™s done, we are 
 where the broad-faced swims 
 Protested, with grandfather
