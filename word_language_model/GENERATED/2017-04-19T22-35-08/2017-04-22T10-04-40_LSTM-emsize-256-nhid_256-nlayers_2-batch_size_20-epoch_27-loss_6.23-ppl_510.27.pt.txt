Thickly Speaks 

 
 Here for you need a voice so bare 
 You have slipped like it's guidesman and, a few 
 To astrologic, I realize I knew smell 
 Choose your little book, the young young want 
 sail through the mascara, makes the infants: 
 To chirr'd: send way out, the last 
 Sestina: but her face with smiles not as you tell me 
 You could travel a trail up the day, 
 But shall you huddled in the old of dinner.
