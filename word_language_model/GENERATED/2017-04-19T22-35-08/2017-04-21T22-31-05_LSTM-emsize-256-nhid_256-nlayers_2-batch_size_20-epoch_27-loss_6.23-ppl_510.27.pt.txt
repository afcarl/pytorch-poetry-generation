 In many a good hour left up serious, 
 A blind, with which a people walked 
 And led a single stain off to the tamarind box. 
 
 The perverters of faiths and of All many things 
 Of stage-- or war, or by least wisdom 
 That they were sworn to sleep, as locks brings; 
 They utter running Strove, 
 Their crenellated rhubarb fingers always dropp'd 
 Their throats and glances from their beds, beautiful; 
 An ice of wine, in perpetual Square,
