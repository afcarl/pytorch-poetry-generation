Crowds Of The Sea 

 I too am awake from one of those others, 
 Are Drumbeats filled with "huge heat and masked 
 chock all Shiver to be rewarded in. 
 
 And then I turn into the mouth of the sideburns 
 As to the roof of the green surprise 
 Tattered with spray blooms among white sheets 
 As a distended fever in its distant family 
 Covered with tea by day. 
 
 
 
 What if who had been made flesh were dead
