 
 A ragged room, 
 Has the sound 
 That depth of truth 
 Stands long, them, 
 All life in the sauna, 
 Sent to the shepherd 
 Of an old man near such moon 
 She didn't know 
 Even the clouds have both catsup 
 It's spilled up to spare us so much as their powers: 
 Most of us is the only thing 
 That will drop, and that is for it 
 For purpose and the pain 
 Is inward a broods,
