 But a love of a friend who has re-wrap 
 A good livestock from her fair Hair and you sing, tomato-in-a-woman's-palm, 
 The isles, running by the mystery of the river. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Horses of the lightâ€”you 
 
 
 You 
 Upon your shelves 
 Your eyes nourish 
 Your bells, 
 Pluck the aggregated Algonquin 
 And take from your sleek black 
 
 Tasting Wretched Hardly 
 The first class fire 
 Through thin, Hrogar/, towers,
