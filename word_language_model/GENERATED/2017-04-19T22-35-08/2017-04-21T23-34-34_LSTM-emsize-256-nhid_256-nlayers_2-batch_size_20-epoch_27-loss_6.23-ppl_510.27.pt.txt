And The Girls Looks Simple, 

 And down beside them, even 
 The cymbal's nods through depositing, 
 Another foggy bird feather 
 Over sense of Caunterbury 
 His traps are Fusiliers, 
 Filling his hands like a toy 
 Out of the avenue, and all the daughters 
 Of the joint dead 
 
 After they laugh and else be 
 An old man, I said phylacteries. 
 
 Not even the count of fire and brick 
 The wise men who care of memory
