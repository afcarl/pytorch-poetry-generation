Wilderness 

 Is this to me now then I came, 
 And so are glad to rise globes of alarm fast. 
 
 Push a home from the pane, each beam was sweet. 
 Now beats the river 
 Long and sweet 
 As a Buddha off the stair and main. 
 No thought can dare come to you 
 Than the time for them-- 
 The high church on the morning towers 
 Of the pure iron flow, 
 The irresponsive highways of the bird, 
 Far
