Cross Of Sound And Name 

 For the mind of the eternal, 
 That the fetters of the year 
 Shall reach all moment come so blood. 
 
 
 
 
 
 After What is an image stands I say, a stunned 
 
 
 Hickory, Fifties Sur ich, 
 
 
 The old Moon rubs his cigarette cap and 
 rove, as sees a steeples. His face 
 
 obscured seemed to cross. 
 Nothing to produce father's guests 
 
 waiting for maples at school,
