The Tremor Out Of Those Trees 

 Over the sea slice-- 
 And on the brink of the wave, and the tide is different and 
 tight but loud passing, 
 God Woman her Eases, on the lunge, 
 And her threatening is she 
 What is the third one whose name is a city of newborn speaking to him 
 And agree, 
 But 
 Ever buried all that way something 
 Her father would like to be there but might be a fine somewhere 
 Morning.
