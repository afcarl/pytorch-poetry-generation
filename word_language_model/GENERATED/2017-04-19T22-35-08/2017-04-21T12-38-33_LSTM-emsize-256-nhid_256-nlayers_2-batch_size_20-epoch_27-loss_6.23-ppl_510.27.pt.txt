Them Tongue, 

 Years more, every day, 
 mist hollowed away as they are shining, 
 So long did curs 
 And did the letter see, 
 Sometimes the doors were on the oxidation 
 Of age, creek, plain, dreads and One's-Self 
 More morn than bees 
 Which by heart wind appear, some fill'd 
 And on the fields and moist, had part 
 Into the farther balm to ring from far, 
 As burnish'd distant ravens 
 Unbounded and refulgent Dolores, 
 A master of desire
