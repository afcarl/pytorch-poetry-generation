The House. 

 You are pleasant a thing stains like to go, 
 I never knew 
 Mr. Years there is little more: 
 And that comes to me. 
 
 
 
 I've seen his sparrow at the steps, 
 And the wind twirled everywhere and laughed. 
 Oh my company. 
 
 One picking oil gasped to my mouth. 
 And so I wished to hang at the staff 
 I sojourn as for some water-ceiling gappy. 
 Later, we've been here with battering steps
