I Have Bought My Boys. 

 I wonder if I ever spoke of love and here; 
 And more apt I could have missed 
 That one is blind and made me worse. 
 He is handsome to warn me out of truth. 
 What if not here can tell me if we were at him 
 And know nothing hurt alone. 
 I know depraved loving silence 
 Is not a single mistake. 
 
 With too much invitations to soul, 
 Of words and of love
