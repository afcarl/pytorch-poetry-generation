Guns, 

 
 gladder than the eyes that till it gusty dry 
 Her shore and cold flesh in age we fall, 
 Life in back turns from far away, 
 Far above the threshold of her, 
 And all is done is fading there as equal 
 As care, manâ€”the as sugar sound.

 Where, each town's orange sharp and sweet, 
 All broken eyes below, we here 
 leod, not yet on there, waking, 
 And draw from our sunken feet.
