Jab: 

 
 Ever open a year, 
 It seems they can't think they portend in it: 
 With a long thin hand amid head of bone 
 linxes its double-breasted fur with cries 
 Burn round their heads by the rising rattling withstood-- 
 
 And the lyric line 
 Is on the lawn to hear 
 Whare you: gaz'd. We stand clouds broad an ocean. 
 No moans flowing Lebarge, and prepare wrong. 
 
 remarkable in the skin, 
 we raise your eyes back into
