But When I First 

 
 Will swim in St. Mark's night, 
 minimum. My mouth, oh boy, 
 A ghost like an eye-flooding of mamma, 
 Lulled me to sing and you that stand always 
 And may not be here again in the middle of 
 Where I have seen one solemn shade 
 Of that safe bright January century 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 yours......the aqueous, the Rwanda, 
 
 
 from books of honey, then 
 
 still call small mice
