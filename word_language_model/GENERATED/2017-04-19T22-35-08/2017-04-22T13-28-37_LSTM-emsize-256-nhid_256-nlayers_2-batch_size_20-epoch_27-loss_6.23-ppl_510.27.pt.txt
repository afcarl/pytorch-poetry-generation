Grave, 

 
 The Enlightenment rises upon my crib. 
 And come impulsions thrust them free; 
 speaking? yet plagues a thorn â€˜bonne 
 Wise now, candies with desire, 
 In the still days of home, 
 And death before the dark? 
 Dole with transparency the pain 
 Of new stakes for as a drag. 
 
 How sorrowful the weird Adam's pass; 
 And then the bards run, and once again 
 The picket warriors exil'd green 
 From the black pedestal, the knife, 
 satiny
