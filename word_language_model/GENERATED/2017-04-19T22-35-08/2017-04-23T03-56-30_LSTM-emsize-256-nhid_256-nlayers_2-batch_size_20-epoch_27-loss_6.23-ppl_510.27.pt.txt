 
 Once in the black grove, 
 stem in a nest she rushed in 
 and sorest trapped in ring, 
 and the great oak voices 
 watches of tea, you'd grown 
 
 on us from a high 
 bowl of proclamation: 
 wearing anonymity of wood 
 and persist. 
 
 Our hands are unfamiliar 
 like the figures, once chews 
 on the chimney-back,-- 
 the courtiers scratched 
 in goldfish, their red full 
 of this summer is clean.
