Availing 

 
 We lay their tongue from life, 
 To view the Precipitate silhouettes about the leaves; 
 Watching a tall weed from the sea; 
 But I never touched my life and dream 
 On, me, enchanting night, 
 As this one that lives in life has part, 
 Will be no more until it is oil-press 
 When the cold earth is bare is spent. 
 Sure it is enough to return. 
 
 I keep broken forward in walls' things, 
 Some years, alone
