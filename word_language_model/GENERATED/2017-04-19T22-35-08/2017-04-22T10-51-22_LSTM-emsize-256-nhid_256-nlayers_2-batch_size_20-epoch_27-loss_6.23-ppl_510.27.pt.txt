Nothing For The Ground Lament; 

 Eagerly my page be quite a tall 
 When even those that died is yet 
 So completely as a gem, 
 Lost on the sands of sand, like my cradle, 
 I see my voices of desire 
 With all these force like those that beating 
 Across the depth as that draws bubbles smeared 
 With water like a dispatch of glass. 
 
 The bed is fled, and I am all torn out 
 And plumed so lovely in
