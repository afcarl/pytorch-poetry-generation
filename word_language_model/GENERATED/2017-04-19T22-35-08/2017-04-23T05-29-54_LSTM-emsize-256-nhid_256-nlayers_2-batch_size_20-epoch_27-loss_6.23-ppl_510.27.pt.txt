Glad Door Dress, Sybil, 

 Through dancing hare-bells shore: 
 And goldenrod ease and Wit, 
 He hung a grave of iron piles, 
 
 And double-space. Some precious word 
 strings! well with conspiring 
 
 etchings on time, bladder of soil, 
 
 Or, lie still on the heads of the earth, 
 And black white muscle bring Hys 
 Cold, summer moonlight towards 
 beldams, houses. 
 While she said, fragrance, commissioner, call 
 To the walls and shoulders of the sky 
 To sail
