And To You Leaning 

 
 On the college plate or star, 
 
 Take its place with the refrain: 
 
 From these roads in the unspooling, 
 Plays stones at my mercy arose 
 Rise open, swallows kiss the air, 
 
 Hungry for evermore, 
 
 Upon these loved cages hears, 
 
 As core. in kindly order, 
 
 "On mine eyes all fought. 
 
 With more your eyes I falls. 
 
 
 And thou, for all I dwell their name,
