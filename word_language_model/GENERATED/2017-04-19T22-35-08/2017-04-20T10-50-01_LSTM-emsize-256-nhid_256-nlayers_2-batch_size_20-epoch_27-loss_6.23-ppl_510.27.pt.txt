That His Name 

 Verum earthquake was her pain. 
 
 Later she is a man, her husband, 
 Will he so solace this comes to be 
 Her test to do but no one. 
 Thou art dead, and of Death's days are dead! 
 Take your bitter time! a brave man wandering under fire. 
 Then it's sad again for me now, 
 
 And ask how far she needs 
 
 Play the night without end. 
 
 Oh, it is hard to her,
