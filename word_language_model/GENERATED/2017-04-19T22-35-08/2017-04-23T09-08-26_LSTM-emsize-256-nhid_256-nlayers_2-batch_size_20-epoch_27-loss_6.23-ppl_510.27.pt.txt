Cellist 

 Storm, browse under the devour'd, 
 And they look like threads like stem, 
 Killing tie them, thin eyes and hay, 
 I love now ways to bring it far, 
 Through the memory of the world. 
 
 
 
 I would the earth halting while the sun 
 Would not sun-down, the heavens alone, 
 Nor the winter wind snatched Franklins 
 And the inner stain upon the ring; 
 Put aside the sweat of a airâ€” 
 So did the billows stir in,
