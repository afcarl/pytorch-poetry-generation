 Something comes right in 
 
 A ghost without missing: 
 
 Only the shell that cross up 
 
 The friends 
 Baltic blame 
 To the bushes 
 That is destroyed even in reason 
 A sin is under them 
 None taller 
 That is singing them. 
 
 The unknown allows 
 The whole person of the mind 
 Is the generosity that 
 The more unwritten says 
 To find them 
 Not in a place 
 It won't love all.
