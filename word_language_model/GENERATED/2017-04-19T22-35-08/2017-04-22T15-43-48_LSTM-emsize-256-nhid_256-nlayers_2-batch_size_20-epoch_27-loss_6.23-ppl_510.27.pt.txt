At First, 

 Frail as a madman when the stars are shattered 
 Over the sauna, bars as we have been bound by the atmosphere 
 Of boughs to banish it, we know one by one, 
 Cut out a slope of the fall and feed at the cherishing ribs of each 
 Bird and Shrine friend of grace. 
 Has some pity to begin. No, there's a country 
 perne for a while, that presses behind us. 
 We think we have just expressed our years...
