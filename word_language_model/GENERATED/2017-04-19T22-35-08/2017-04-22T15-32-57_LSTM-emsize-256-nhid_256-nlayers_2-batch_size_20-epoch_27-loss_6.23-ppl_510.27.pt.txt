Patria Gum-Pocked 

 Heart, the doors are outcast all the long!) 
 
 Run over past sounds again and again, 
 Taste you like thorns. 
 Knowing the city which they tame yourself 
 Shuddering we are brushing again 
 
 And the mad outdoor enigma 
 Picked up the night. 
 
 
 
 Come into the stars, the wet and pink the tongue, 
 And the old ghost, coming hard through the rain, 
 And the voice of the village flesh fly shining again, 
 Far
