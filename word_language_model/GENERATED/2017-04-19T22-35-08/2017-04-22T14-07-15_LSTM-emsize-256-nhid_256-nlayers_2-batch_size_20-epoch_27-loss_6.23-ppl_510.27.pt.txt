 Those run above this old highway 
 That balances my neighbors' eyebrows 
 To put the battered trousers 
 
 And wrestling the eyes that crush 
 O file, but let them die. 
 
 
 
 When the road takes once a pink black tree 
 Across the fitting covers. 
 
 The world has Changing, Age by oxen 
 Angels are pale. We used one to lightly 
 Sometimes: a breath and a step 
 Will never be filled with forecloses 
 to carry it
