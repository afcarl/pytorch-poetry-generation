 When I was sharpening you sailing 
 Even in earth I saw 
 Nearly thus brushed my arms out of the roots of grass 
 I went with the house inside it Lathered 
 My firm curls no wonderful farther sky. 
 swolne it went in light 
 And thought it was done and drained 
 in burled or pains 
 And expecting to die in your spirit's 
 calls-- another.
