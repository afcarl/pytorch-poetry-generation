The Streetlight. 

 
 It was the moon, lost in its throats 
 And shoots of salt and wood; 
 Since Rainbows have driven, FARM, cataract 
 Or sunlight filling with her cold. 
 
 The sun left all full round, play. 
 But The tree is always near 
 The rainbow's blade the gibbous air 
 Repeats to the spectral Ocean 
 Which hides the stables and the Jack, 
 And the unbared perch 
 Float out against the stars. 
 
 Sleep again, no shores of
