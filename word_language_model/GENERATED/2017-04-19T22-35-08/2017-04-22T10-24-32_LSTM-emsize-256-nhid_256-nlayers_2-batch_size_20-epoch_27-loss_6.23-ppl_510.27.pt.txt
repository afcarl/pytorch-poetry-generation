Nightfall! A Mother 

 tri'd forever!" 
 
 Swelling in your ship - 
 This isn't your sandwich, something 
 I would never not, your heart 
 Poem" me. 
 
 Your face slipped through. 
 
 Your body is bleak and bland, 
 The cat that wakes in the August grain 
 Do the least word you can see, 
 That's what I have.

 As then the guest of a maiden vine brays 
 As the hounds overflow the gales like stones
