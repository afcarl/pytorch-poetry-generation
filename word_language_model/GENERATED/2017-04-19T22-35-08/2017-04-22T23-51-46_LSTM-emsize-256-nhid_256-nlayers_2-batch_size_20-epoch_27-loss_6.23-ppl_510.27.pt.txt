Within Me. 

 
 
 II. taffeta lass, 
 
 The lush grasses creaks the stupid horses, 
 the aunts were more rich to fill the ears, 
 Nor do they meet among sweet heaps of wrecks 
 Nor others balloons lie; their clogs clung 
 Enerve, from wine to lisp the brows- 
 The slaughter'd flesh is bleeding deems 
 
 Is tranquil to the dark; 
 
 or Isabel concealing the hour of doom 
 
 Onto the sage world its own 
 sodas in the
