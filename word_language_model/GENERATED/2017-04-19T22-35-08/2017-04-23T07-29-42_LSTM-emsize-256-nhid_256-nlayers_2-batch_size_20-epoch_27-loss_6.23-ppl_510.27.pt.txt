Seraphim And The Truth. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Rumbling Portuguese 
 
 
 shades of violets dying 
 From Anne canyons, to irises

 More calms, than painter met, and pleasant, 
 "The time was pulled to it; 
 "Though he is escorting them to the street and seen 
 walking out my breakfast, and can claim them 
 if anyone looks cold; but they're barefoot 
 as long as we God can care
