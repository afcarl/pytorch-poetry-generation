Whine, 

 And hear, once-tame progress: soul 
 Hung on nor even pendant screamed: 
 O, still used, what Fortune chief, 
 Al mortals, what can joy, finally, 
 Worth true aught, always. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In Memoriam A. H. Adam man, 
 
 
 (excerpt) 
 Heav'n had requires, and mostly do she, 
 That force of mourning many, could a blight 
 E'en a cheerful link so stunk, 
 And he by his conduct condemn, 
 In every substantial prow of graspable.
