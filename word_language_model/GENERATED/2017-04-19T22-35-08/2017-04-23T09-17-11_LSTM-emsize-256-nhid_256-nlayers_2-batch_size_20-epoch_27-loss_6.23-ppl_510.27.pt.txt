 To die for sparkling, 
 Vanessa, halogens DUALISM: 
 gambit, scribbling wise 1968 
 
 Before, it is just a great demand 
 for dog of power; 
 I am my Law the blessing of ants. 
 
 Is he terribly there for a winter before, 
 My heart and my judgement I have been missing. 
 She is her always brother, I am not love but 
 My body is a harlot 
 That sometimes makes sense is gathering 
 
 feels: lachrymae-- myself free
