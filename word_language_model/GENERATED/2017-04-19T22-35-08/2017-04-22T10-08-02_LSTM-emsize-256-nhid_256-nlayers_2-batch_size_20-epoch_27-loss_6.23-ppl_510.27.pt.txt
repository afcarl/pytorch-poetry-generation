 In a banquet bite. 
 And who'd soon look down and watch the children 
 Who wonder he . . . gefeh, He's grown undyrne; 
 Clustered done well another day as earplugs 
 Throwing them outside, filled with brutes, 
 Their fingers spotted with mosses 
 Entwined poetry? 
 And want all the wonder, sweet interest 
 I now move back here like a school in a farmhouse 
 I forget my saint, my face on the ground. 
 
 
 
 Still, the light, bright
