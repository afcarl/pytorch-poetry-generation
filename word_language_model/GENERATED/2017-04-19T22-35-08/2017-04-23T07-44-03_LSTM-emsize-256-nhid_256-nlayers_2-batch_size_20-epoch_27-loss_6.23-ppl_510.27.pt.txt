If I 

 know that they are not what I want. I hate them forever; 
 
 I think you have called it much more than a child at all 
 
 And you, but if you understand, if you know, 
 
 tempest was oblivious to me, the one I hardly thought for. 
 
 If you should sever, if ever did I apologize 
 to prove my eyes, substantial teeshirt 
 Maybe the force of pain 
 And war, we are all in rest.
