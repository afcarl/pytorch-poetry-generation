Loved Too Much. 

 
 Hawthorne you dust, however blind, 
 I knew you must be loving you, 
 Which is time where my business sees, 
 Oh, broadening. 
 I must ape you or put your hair 
 Hang on the bees and dunes hillock 
 homosexuality! They'l gone 
 To guide it under your deck, 
 Else, not yet an inch 
 Afar by late, it won't escape 
 As far as I must leave you, 
 And not a trace and hung it a leaf,
