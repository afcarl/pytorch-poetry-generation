 It is a matter under a fire, 
 figs and flags, and tender niente, 
 And rocks of Europe wandering through the sky. 
 
 Upon a stormy day I walk toward 
 Death seemed to rattle us breaks, 
 We trots like a castle. 
 
 Let's say, abode. my mother's garden, tongue-- 
 As the Congo goes the round road into the garden 
 And the daffodils were dipped like garbage islands 
 Too gently sung, even as I till 
 There is always water
