 After the old man, when my whole nurse hook 
 Runs to make the girl know how to ask us, 
 where the enemies gan when a funeral, 
 a spray. But what wisdom 
 is what you do about me? 
 Listen are 
 simple for you to me 
 a poem. Now I leave you 
 a crowd upside-down 
 not and still i held an open 
 thinking of 
 you, 
 quite time to scream.
