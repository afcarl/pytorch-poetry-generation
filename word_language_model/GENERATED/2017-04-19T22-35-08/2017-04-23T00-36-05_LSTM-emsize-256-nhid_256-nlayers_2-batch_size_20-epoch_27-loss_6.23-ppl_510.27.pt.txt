They Can'T Step Toward Those On That. 

 The boat may flourish, the children 
 demons, each bright line 
 Of intimations of the thought...

 Making a painted and black soft staircase 
 A dancer, an offertorie; 
 A bulb around a head the ring 
 Of a journey from nothing. Here our dead path 
 Had remained, but in its rising, 
 The legend of an arrow, 
 Lose a way to mandrakes, 
 A deeper prospect for the umpteenth place
