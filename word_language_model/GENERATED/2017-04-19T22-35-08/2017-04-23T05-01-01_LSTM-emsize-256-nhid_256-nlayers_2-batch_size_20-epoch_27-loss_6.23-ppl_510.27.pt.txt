Charlock, 

 
 The mirrors so rich and small; 
 The light of his children holds his visor 
 With a sword, half-wedged with her will rise 
 Affects to write lint. 
 She was quick of bombs on her fists. 
 
 Over the pavements woman carved down 
 A silken love-knot of asphalt. 
 She was feeling very shy, 
 Bad workers who were exposed 
 They would have prepared to lift her apron 
 The right plastic eyes like foam 
 And blind and almost
