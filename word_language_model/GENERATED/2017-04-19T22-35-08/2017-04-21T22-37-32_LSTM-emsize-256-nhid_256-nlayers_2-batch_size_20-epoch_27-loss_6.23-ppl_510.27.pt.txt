My Ghost Bruce, A Ring 

 Of life at the idea of the world with its spears, 
 And petrifies its comedy, 
 Near a basement, a dead who kissed shopping rug. 
 
 VI 
 
 The reason leaves to his fame 
 Is the Continent's asylum 
 puffed out toward sight down the West 
 Off 
 And in the dark and thieves 
 Foam and casting in the furnace 
 About the Black breast of Moloch! 
 
 A young man nearly bought on stars
