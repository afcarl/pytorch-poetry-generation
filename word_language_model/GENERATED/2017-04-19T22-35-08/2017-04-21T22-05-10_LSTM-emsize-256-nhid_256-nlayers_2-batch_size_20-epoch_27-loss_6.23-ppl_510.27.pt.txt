Good To Watch More The Lake 

 Ensanguin'd and false -- Forthright then, the white leaves, 
 In one of our cat, as lightly as the march 
 turns lay silently on red form. 
 
 Who can spirit bend, and pour, He watches, has chosen 
 No world of blue; if there be till the dawn 
 Will be blind and lives in sight of your love. 
 Welcome your mind. Look here within my body life. 
 Four days I see and says, chips of antlers
