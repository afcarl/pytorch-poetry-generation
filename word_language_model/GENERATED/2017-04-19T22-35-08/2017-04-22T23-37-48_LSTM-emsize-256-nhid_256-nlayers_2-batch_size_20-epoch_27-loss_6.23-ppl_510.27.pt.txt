Down At The Ship-Builders, 

 And answer to and fro without fault, 
 But should not go. 
 
 Debridement: Philemon discovered 
 Along a narrow houses, in all the north 
 By sensual jump-rope of marsh and red, 
 To take moment, moving a ring. 
 I used to church the unraveling setting 
 Of a vision, obscured by the stars. 
 I laugh, unseen and lost for life! 
 
 I am the man, I think of You. 
 
 Ah, you are thin with blurts--
