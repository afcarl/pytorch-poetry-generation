Aromatic Hyena 

 Southward from gazing hard its dart. 
 
 High in the frozen pasture and the woods, 
 And the same drops of night guitarist bones; 
 And so they come out of the center of the street, 
 And Jill slept. 
 
 "Why are these regions of timing, here of stars, 
 A ragged voice, the miraculous sight! 
 Where their hearts together are; 
 Far through the augment. Women are the gates 
 Of who so long life; nothing is written so;
