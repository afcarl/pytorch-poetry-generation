 In which we came 
 
 
 
 
 
 metaphysics, to the rudest Nights 
 
 
 Behind the quiet Susquehanna 
 
 A quivering column of water. 
 
 The leafy writer on tired-tired 
 Does not carry heaven from the number of my door 
 Another day anyway, like a fist 
 Into a river flowing to life 
 
 And the tree for a nice pleasure 
 
 In living inhabitation, water, blotting out 
 of no cemeteries I tore here! 
 Underneath
