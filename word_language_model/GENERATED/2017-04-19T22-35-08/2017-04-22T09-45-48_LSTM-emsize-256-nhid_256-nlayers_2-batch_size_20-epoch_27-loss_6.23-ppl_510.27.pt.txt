At The Day 

 Last night that at last is a country 
 The blood 
 spreading its sides out, your surprise, 
 It slides down and on my teeth 
 drive into the land 
 It once held all sides of me 
 
 It casts the night 
 
 Ain't exuberant, cones out on the shore 
 Grows sandfleas waving down within. 
 
 
 
 
 
 lilac-bush at Sunday 
 
 
 hearthstone engaged in hell 
 vital always newspaperman but at the poquito
