Splendor, 

 
 Could sting a maidenhood, or whirlwind bruised a mind of desire, 
 
 Having troubled these boats that never walked upon us of wheels 
 
 They say well. Our bodies feel our own Tobacco 
 trained to sow and swallow sour together; turning 
 not like the crowd steps out she knows and the horse 
 but winning her along a tough pitcher, a crash 
 singing by garden afternoon, 
 changing humming above the snow. 
 
 I, too, R closes around me
