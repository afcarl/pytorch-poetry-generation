 (itself's something discarded, -- stab a piano. 
 
 Night in the West I found less repeating 
 vultures at it, serviceberry smelling of shell 
 Came finally and sere-- historically all day. 
 Who I have always the same: and all that time 
 I let these dead men pay me long ago, 
 That they are not really the same of me, 
 Nor they must not hear me either. 
 
 But seal the lynch messages of embers 
 All death-swans. Alarm hesitant
