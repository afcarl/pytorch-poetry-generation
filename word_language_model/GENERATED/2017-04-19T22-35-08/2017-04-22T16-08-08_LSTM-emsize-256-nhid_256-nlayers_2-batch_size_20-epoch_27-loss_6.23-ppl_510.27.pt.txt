Of Shouting 

 That cut stones in my Thanksgivin' hope 
 Bound each command. 
 
 I knew how to get to be, 
 The only mind that might come from heaven, 
 Which the tendency of it were fed with prayer 
 With a name view of it all, of that struggle. 
 
 The moss still turned on the great tar- 361 
 Nothing flew to the edge of the sky was louder and sliding in other luck 
 And no one had never heard dead
