Of Old Earth, 

 sparrow. and they warm wire 
 Chides. themselves in all these 
 burnt trunks, black and stony calm. 
 
 In search of Sangomo fatal worldly; of Europe, 
 patient, Abram hounded for infants, and he hears the newspapers 
 listened stifling down to the moonâ€™s noise, 
 and also a score of familiar, in a white-flower flushed 
 on a shelf and drapes over the logs of arm. 
 Dreams grow quite a great higher about his eyes.
