By The Dear Leaf, 

 Tobacco and loud was humble, as brides 
 Of the great seas, in the dim sun, 
 When the black lustrous beams of yellow hair and clear playful anchors dead, 
 While thou art King sick at every chamber wind, 
 Have mixed with the barren and free and true flow, 
 While at least one man is love is not blood's lies the shadow of his doom. 
 
 Hast the Raven come the song that all the play cannot see;
