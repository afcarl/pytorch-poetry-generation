To The Rose Of Its Birth, 

 And wave like 175,000 shifting glass, 
 pixilate over silver drinking 
 In the late afternoon noon comes 
 to sleep and say what I hold upon its couch--I 
 buttressed buds blink up through the salt sheet. 
 I can't eat that the Admiral man 
 In naked myth, tear up the words. 
 Since the blue dusk was playing like smoke 
 And my tattoo closed a cloud while the light gathered 
 And the moon contains the water
