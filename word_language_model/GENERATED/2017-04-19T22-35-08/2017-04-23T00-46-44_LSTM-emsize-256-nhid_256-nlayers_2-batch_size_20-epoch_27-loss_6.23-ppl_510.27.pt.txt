To The Towers I Mentioned, 

 When Lady smote the spirit bend. 
 Now within the Ram had been lofty pure 
 Leaned on his eyes, the same I run; 
 And whom in quarters doth together 
 Are all taking to render me. 
 
 
 
 
 The sun riffled a little, 
 Ah, imploded from the brimming light. 
 The spruce waters close, 
 The sky, the brook their vein 
 Upon the breathless reach of sky 
 Falls, and the rush of ore
