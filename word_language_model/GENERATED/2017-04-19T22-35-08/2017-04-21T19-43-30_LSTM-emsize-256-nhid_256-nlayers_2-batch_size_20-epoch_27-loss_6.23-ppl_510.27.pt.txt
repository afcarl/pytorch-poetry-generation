Light Of The Sun, 

 Where the ironbark half-moon is mild, 
 The ocean comes when his voice swims fast! 
 faste, and laughing ghosts were smooth, 
 This of the drift in that province. 
 Thought that impossible and near. 
 
 As the man Mary shrinks i' the cloud 
 But his eyelids singing down to the Moabites, 
 And the vision comes the blame for it 
 For the reflection that holds a caint 
 Susan? Dominus no erstwhile crime for the doctah 
 It
