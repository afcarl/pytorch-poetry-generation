Thou Flies. 

 
 
 
 
 
 The Triple Butler Almost: twenty/mile many-fountain'd 
 
 
 There is a day steps under the tree, 
 "I keep a Negro man, who in the trees 
 Dark fields of stars like eyebeams fruit, 
 And whisper into the rain. 
 
 olian sorrow Pellets and smiles, and lips' cries 
 A shout ache, crenelated last rung 
 With many a loathsome fright of birches. 
 
 And unseen, announce the stars that we receive 
 From grating pictures
