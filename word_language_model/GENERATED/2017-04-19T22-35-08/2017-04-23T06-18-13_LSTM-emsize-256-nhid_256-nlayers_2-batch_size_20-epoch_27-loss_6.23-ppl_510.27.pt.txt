 
 I wound them high straw completely 
 I never loved in my water 
 To do but cry about the hills, these lions 
 concerns my heart to the rhyme come to the farm 
 And yet they 
 Could not breathe like little birds like guys 
 until I come back into the field 
 This morning I can already see them 
 Where wasteful men are eating the mountains 
 Where they may find the rainbowâ€” 
 And the sheep are springing along just
