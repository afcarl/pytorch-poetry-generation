Green Lapping Sheets In The Gloom, 

 Drives a morning before the grain of heaven; 
 Eyes blown like mast, and my great-grandmother's butter." 
 And all the while to greet a winter whirls 
 Lies from behind weariness, into an air and as a square; 
 A man asks me to hold something from the books. 
 
 But why my foe long since my father protect, 
 How long around it, whether time for night? 
 
 After a year behind whose time is prime,
