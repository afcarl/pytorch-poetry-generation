Tool, Or Hour. 

 
 The waters does not fail, but I fear them, 
 Love after day is for me, 
 By the swift sing I bring to him, 
 I am not sure to hear in my praise; 
 Will my knees 'neath the bald and bright as some trashcan 
 Their fish days, never till my hours are Moving. 
 I have thy shoes for a shadow, or go in 
 To my right touch alive at this place, 
 contributed in the other hand,
