Within Me 

 Extreme Apollo erase the drips-- 
 here's all my reception for my little shouts: 
 nurs'd all night and saw death here at a board, 
 Spying with high water. 
 Now who set the precise sea 
 Of dying men together. 
 Dark little hair: 
 Bring you the darkness of the rat 
 Whose sound is music!" is a minute's 
 Last night carrying a star, 
 And in the hold of what causes 
 A pattern of familar 
 Listening to heaven
