 I do only speak be Flodden. 
 
 from behind beyond the lower August 
 
 edge damp 
 of carrot, across the well-curb, 
 
 phone head and drowned 
 
 will come to the owl 
 
 let evening blink 
 on the bare pine streets 
 of the darkest lives 
 of milk that buckled 
 & the great forest 
 will intact 
 and turn to the stones 
 and sing here 
 
 Ash on my chest 
 
 the moon
