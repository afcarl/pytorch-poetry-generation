I Can Hear How My Cotton Swing 

 against the probing henna coast, 
 at the equinox, Dulcimers smell old 
 hovered, crept with a heap, looked wide behind 
 the belt; my sister murdered in a net, 
 and heard the way a drowned succotash played the cluttered moon 
 locking down onto the tip of my foot. 
 
 almost-morning appear till terror 
 stares night: lifting the scaffolding 
 to the roles of a cliff. 
 
 It is the site of a sympathised; effective.
