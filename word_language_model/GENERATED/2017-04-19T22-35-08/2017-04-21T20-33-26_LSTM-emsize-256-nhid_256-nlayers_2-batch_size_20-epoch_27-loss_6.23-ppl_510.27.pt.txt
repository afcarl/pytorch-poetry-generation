Night! 

 
 You can not mother stop with me, 
 Or let me forget you, taught her name, 
 Couch, your pleasures and incense there: 
 High dry and red 
 I in the image of the bird her cry 
 
 Ne'er after her who hath to an ear 
 Will shut away a green wynd 
 Makes folded her deep 
 She could break the earth from home. 
 
 She will not know that it is calm, 
 Because her hand closes as you
