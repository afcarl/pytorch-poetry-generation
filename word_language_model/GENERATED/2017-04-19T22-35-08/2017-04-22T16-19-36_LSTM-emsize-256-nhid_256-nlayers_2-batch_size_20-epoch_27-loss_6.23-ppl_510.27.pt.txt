Summer Is Rich 

 For fear of my grief. 
 
 
 
 It propelled me in the morning dark. 
 Everything was just a jaw, 
 like the one with orchid needles 
 "Soapsuds and colors yet 
 couch from the barbed Heriot, 
 and tuned of being left in 
 directions, another bones 
 where grief had roughly 
 often had begun in sight 
 and never delivered them, 
 and might he take anything, 
 climbing as babbling 
 I played Defeated 
 to himself
