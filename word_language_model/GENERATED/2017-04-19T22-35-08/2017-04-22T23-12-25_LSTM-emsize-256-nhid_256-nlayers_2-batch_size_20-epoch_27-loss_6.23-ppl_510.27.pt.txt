On The Beach 

 I scoop it down. 
 It gives them tight, 
 I lived and weep 
 With silence, 
 The sky sliding around 
 so long that it casts 
 like broken lamps 
 
 with the elephants 
 of the pond and the dark 
 on my limbs 
 selling sweet joy 
 of love, I traced 
 the world 
 where it fell down many miles 
 of mist. To watch me 
 
 Tall and hallway's After 
 many a local house?
