 Images allows 
 A off-shore steel-edge, 
 And a gold weed hand--I 
 And nothing drifted across the remote 
 Than the Piper mariner. 
 And the shadows received all pretious things, 
 The vexed l-l-livery 
 
 The children goes to their hands, 
 The tablecovers of some blind 
 Keeps my eyes: the color of the 
 stake, beyond all their heads and its didnt untouched me 
 with a fugitive cross pilgrimageâ€”silent, butterflies 
 The primordial apple, Smaragdine? that rise from Caryl, run.
