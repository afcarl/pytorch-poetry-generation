They Are Made 

 Are the rivulets, marvelous to the Squoire in interdependence. 
 They are amateurs, 
 In shambling atomies of the tigress, 
 Spread only your despair to wield 
 The throng, The way tales, self-pitiers, 
 
 Godolphin shot locomotive? 
 Unseen the most wild, 
 Look through the streams and confessionals. 
 Eagerly I feel--I stand, and bid it die! 
 But the lilac for the rushing ward, a bird 
 Hung it over galvanised ball. 
 The carpet that in synchesis: stibble-field follow'd,
