 Like an amber unworshipped 
 Sweet-scented in the wet glare 
 unsurprised to a man by his leg. 
 But it isn't much music 
 in what he knew; 
 
 means it all measles misspellings, 
 the death as the enemy 
 who sees us 
 without ward from one drop 
 to a perfect province, Whatever there is 
 
 there is no rock but 
 come to him 
 and in their lives -- stalk shape 
 
 wooden ships, rooted in his dream
