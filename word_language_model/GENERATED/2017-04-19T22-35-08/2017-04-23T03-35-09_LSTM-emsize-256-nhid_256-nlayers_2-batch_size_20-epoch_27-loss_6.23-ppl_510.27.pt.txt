Semblance, 

 
 So well it has been there, 
 Long have his grief of joy? 
 Him in her mouth the bed of showers 
 On his wrist by mine as he sonar. 
 Her old eyes ripen out by canefield. 
 
 The world is symbol of farewell, 
 A troubled life longer than ever now 
 He answer'd but as for him did night! 
 He !took at it upon the mere. 
 And the Beaver in his rude lip, and his whole feet,
