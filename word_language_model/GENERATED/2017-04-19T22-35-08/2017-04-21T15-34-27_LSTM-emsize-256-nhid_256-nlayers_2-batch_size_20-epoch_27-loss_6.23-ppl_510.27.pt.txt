Low In Your Lap 

 because Your anguish brushed your shoulder, 
 worth; hands, sideways and vote up . . . 
 For I said to me still late. 
 
 
 
 So that you grow 
 Too deep. 
 You might be strong: 
 
 
 
 You don't have to stand this way I say anything 
 More than a weed-choked storm someone more 
 About the trees then burn my rage, I seek 
 At the window and label, such a world I know
