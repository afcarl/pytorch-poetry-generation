 Beyond the long days of night 
 While waters fires away; 
 One marvel with their cries. 
 The body's quick overflow 
 At home their line off copperhead, 
 Beaten in feast to mell, 
 second-rate? from the woods 
 While the Jumblies nigh foxes and carried 
 The Fop's smear laughing and the plume, 
 Are for wheelchair at the feet 
 Of peace, and all insistent bound: 
 And glowed in the antiquity 
 That we sowed & strove
