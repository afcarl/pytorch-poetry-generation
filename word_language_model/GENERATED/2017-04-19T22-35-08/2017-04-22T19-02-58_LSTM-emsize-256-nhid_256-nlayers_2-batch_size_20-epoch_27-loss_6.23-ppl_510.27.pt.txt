Aweâ€” 

 At the Massachusetts, like edging overhead, 
 Gray long lights larger and urea. 
 
 
 5 
 
 My two red hands shone 
 In the tourist shade 
 The shipwreck'd harvest church 
 aren the spring. 
 The spillways, Axis 
 With lanterns hushed in bed 
 In a different suit. 
 From head of pole. 
 
 The living sun is shining, 
 The danger of life. 
 
 He knows hedgehogs 
 It takes all over, 
 To have his life
