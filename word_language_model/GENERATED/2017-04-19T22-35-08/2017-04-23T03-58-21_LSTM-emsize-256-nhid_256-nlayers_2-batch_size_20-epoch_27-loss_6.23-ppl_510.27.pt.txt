Or, That From The White-Mossed Pan, 

 By a mother's roof cut up in anticipation 
 That ever has closed her throat, too small, 
 And so had been made of the confederate play. 
 
 The night is speaking to a senses, 
 And the end of the right time she lies the line 
 Play that we hear the firmament 
 Of color fast in the sounding air 
 The ghost of the sun shining, 
 The world is won by the end of the sea,
