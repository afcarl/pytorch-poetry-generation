Leaf, 

 The Lady of knots, 
 The tresses tossed decades before 
 And all the sword then falls to us 
 Sufficient best islands calcified 
 Accessible from the air from the well-consider'd. 
 
 Stony the fog 
 A soldier makes it plain 
 Drop below suing 
 The boy bursts the roads to bow. 
 
 The works of a loyal man and one 
 Made turns and out of left drudges 
 We keep off two big hands nip grain 
 Before he Cortil-Noirmont.
