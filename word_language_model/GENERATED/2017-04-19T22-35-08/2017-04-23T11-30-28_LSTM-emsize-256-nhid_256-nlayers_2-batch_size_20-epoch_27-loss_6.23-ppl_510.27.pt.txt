Noisy Cheese 

 On the ballroom of each side, a stare 
 Where none his hopes are placed to make them. 
 The rule has come, no portion sail 
 Without nature, one good crooked moniment. 
 
 Spinning to all that may have gathered such a star; 
 And their hearts are splendid, small. 
 
 Much so these, the sore was heard that 70, 
 Great music of the morning was of day, 
 And often the great agony drew worms, 
 Where all the mayds
