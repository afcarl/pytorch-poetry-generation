It'S Something Of The Time Of Store, 

 Out such a long way I'd looked. 
 
 People will never be a soul in my child, 
 But in the end, by unwilling cause, 
 There is much time on both this sentence, 
 It sings on the stiff shoulders. 
 This time comes closer, dark, and streets, 
 In the ghostly stage; 
 Said they are so knitted today 
 A clean watry r 
 
 Too beautifully solid, a kind which he calls 
 By me.
