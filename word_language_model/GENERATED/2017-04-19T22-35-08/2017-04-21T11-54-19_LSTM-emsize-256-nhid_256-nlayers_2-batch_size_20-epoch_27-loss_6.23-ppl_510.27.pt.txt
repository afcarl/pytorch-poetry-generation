The Battle Repeats 

 The aria's paradox of Man; 
 
 But all foundations though itself. 
 
 The certain shades of that remembered music, 
 Tho ere through the hot verge of perfect dreams, 
 With pale smoke, swan and the streets, 
 Swim as it scans it when she 
 Appears the singing of the noblest decade: 
 and the ghost of one manâ€™s kind, 
 
 an oasis and a Mexican voice 
 of unactive clothing. 
 
 Comes from the gatherer within the dry
