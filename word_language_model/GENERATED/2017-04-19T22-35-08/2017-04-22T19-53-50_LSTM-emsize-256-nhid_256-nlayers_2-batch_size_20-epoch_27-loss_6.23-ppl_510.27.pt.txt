 When the hours are bright in the trees, 
 post-Roman dreaming and dim, tamed 
 Enough to dream of the wind ideally-balanced), 
 On the lake the mark spots on the shapes around 
 To see logs in the Holy god: 
 bird-- past, what I can believe. 
 Desire that will credit 
 Love sees all this is the wind 
 That cannot house these things to keep, 
 For there is no more safe than a eye. 
 Give shape the sunlight to the ground,
