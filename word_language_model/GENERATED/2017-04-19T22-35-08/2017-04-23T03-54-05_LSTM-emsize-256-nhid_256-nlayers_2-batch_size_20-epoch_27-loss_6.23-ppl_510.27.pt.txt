 That we would not have lived back 
 Just lost, the fields of ours, 
 
 The loss of life that now soiled everything, 
 it strongly rose putting forever from the room. 
 
 One makes a baby line, the tall tongue 
 
 of man. And now the eyes worse than remembered 
 
 for pleasure 
 
 Boar bread in the pocket 
 
 jots sleep all-purposeful 
 
 I sometimes kissed my veins 
 
 into my driveway -- 
 the silver Ksar
