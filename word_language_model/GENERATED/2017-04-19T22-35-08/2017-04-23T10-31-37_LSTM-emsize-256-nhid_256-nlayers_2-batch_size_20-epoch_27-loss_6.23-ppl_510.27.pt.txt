Now Is New, 

 I will not always lose her for thee; 
 Mother, O faith, that afternoon, I 
 
 Presently a child, most as the bay turned over. 
 
 And the casual hot run know. 
 Was it you made you sitting by the sea, 
 Like the brass bole that starts to restrain 
 Its freshness like the heron to the offspring of the landfill 
 In a large piqued shadow of Las earth; 
 Consum'd with the golden territory 
 And last night
