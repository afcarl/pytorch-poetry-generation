 That Still-lighted folks were krill 
 And dined those of us someone, 
 And ride before their eyes and gleams 
 The song it napping Constellations. 
 So on those Casket licodon, 
 Birds hemlock cauld! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Fashion of Look, these lights 
 
 
 This which smokes the giant calm of the night, 
 Color of lifeâ€” 
 Say, arrant land, thy sweet branches fall. 
 
 Once the bounteous night I fall on thee again. 
 In sad shadows,
