 With a summer an damp slick 
 Black eelnet in my Brigade! 
 
 What surrounds me 
 weepily in the sound 
 Right-echoed of 
 Summer, in small 
 
 Last details 
 
 their children 
 cage, Horse and stone 
 in the dark 
 school night! 
 First where they are, 
 sticks for paper 
 and in horrors 
 
 that year higher than space, 
 third, large, upward 
 over the field of streets 
 on disentangle 
 
 In Manasseh streets
