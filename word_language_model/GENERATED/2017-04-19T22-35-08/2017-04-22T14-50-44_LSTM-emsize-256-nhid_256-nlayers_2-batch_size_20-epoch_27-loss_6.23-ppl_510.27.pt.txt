Recked The Inflame 

 And stroll the jury into jest, 
 hoped-for, without pain; 
 No guilty, drop clear, like bees for other rhymes, 
 The old and old thousand ways of remits 
 
 Stamp with mien of country, yet to love, 
 Whose cheek and shapeless motion send 
 Close-locked among all vales for delight, 
 And hairy, timid after night; 
 Bushes and summer corridor Disturbing 
 The confines of the world, and poured out every screw; 
 
 See! quenched.--"Their looping into bays.
