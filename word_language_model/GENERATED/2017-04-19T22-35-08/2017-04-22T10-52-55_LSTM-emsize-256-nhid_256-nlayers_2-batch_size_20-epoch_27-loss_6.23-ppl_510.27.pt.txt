 And many years before drizzling; 
 With me signature and drift window--the 
 Hears New Black bags that pass the chainsaw in their blinds 
 And you gave me an ugly throat and one evening forever. 
 Late ride my edge the creek didn't survive your love 
 Only bareley, lines and worse eye-catching 
 22, men, good, a wounded 'erd 
 massacre of those limpid hands 
 Were dear to be counted our way off 
 In all these bundles to the surface of the world.
