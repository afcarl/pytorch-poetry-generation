Shudder 

 For no more See more than a nest, 
 Or but a horse on the lake's innocence 
 Gives garments of the mystic race from books, 
 Turning against the river far away, 
 Exactly feeling, shining first, well I bring: 
 For this my blood drew up for me and took, 
 Throw him aside when hell did muse 
 Till such a giant had his glory pay, 
 Till six can still be total of mankind, 
 In their glee: I bide myself away,
