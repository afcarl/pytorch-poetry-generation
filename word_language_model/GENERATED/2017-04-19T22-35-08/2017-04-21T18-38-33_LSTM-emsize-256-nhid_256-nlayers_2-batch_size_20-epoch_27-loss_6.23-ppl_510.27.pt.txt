 Body that it was like us, 
 Whence will you count two long wandering together 
 along your shaggy lawns 
 and darkening find the Sâ€™s, 
 Next year you stand on me; sobbing also, 
 
 or the certain smell of thunderings, 
 by desire's quick losses arteries 
 in black, shoots, gills, white shoes and day!" 
 I could hear your dead discourse out, and bow 
 the gravid and hairy tongue, chops space 
 and fathers bank against galleries, 
 mothers grew old on
