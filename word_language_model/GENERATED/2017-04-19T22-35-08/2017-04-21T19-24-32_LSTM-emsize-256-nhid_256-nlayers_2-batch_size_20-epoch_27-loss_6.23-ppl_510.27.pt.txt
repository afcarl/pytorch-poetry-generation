Are Dying 

 Than north with oak--gone lids, 
 Fallacious uniforms in dreams, clothes, 
 Joyes, flesh or time, abide. 
 For "which or collapsed barons 
 Refuge free in the gorgeous 
 
 Stourton box 
 From the sole reach of the insects: 
 
 Over him the smothering feast in brier 
 Took notes from the synagogue, home the kosmos to God. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Snarks have brook'd our Anne leaps 
 
 
 thereâ€™s a single struggle thing in this land
