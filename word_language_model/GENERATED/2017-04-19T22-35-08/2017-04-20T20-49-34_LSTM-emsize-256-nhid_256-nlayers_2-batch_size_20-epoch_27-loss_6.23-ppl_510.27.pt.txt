 These delicate gape in the dark, 
 Rising and exiled, at dawn and flowers 
 As we howling at the stop, or down, 
 Must keep news of ourselves, 
 And end of the passionate mind's of trouble. 
 
 The night we trod, 
 "Courage!" we fear the soul, 
 Whenever the mystery of manhole delay. 
 Nothing is born in this, 
 The millions in its nakedness, 
 You must come where we know 
 That great bird which we go. 
 Like the sea
