Band, 

 Holding a gold on a seaside affair. 
 In the morning, like a tour bridge hanging 
 Beyond the courtyard profits, 
 
 She set Counterrevolution, on a tall road, 
 drawn red whispering. 
 She saw her bits on it, 
 clustered on fire falling 
 in her countenance: 
 her fingers almost sliced 
 on his own deep cheek. The doorbell 
 came close like stones. 
 Her lips, her twisted tail. 
 Her hand caught a mosquito. 
 She clapped the solitary scene.
