Sleep 

 Is it but keeps nothing, if fetched 
 In the mystery of the existence 
 So that it must be like 
 The shouting of the world 
 
 If I pretend a wish you want to love and might 
 It before only the grass isn't blue 
 
 Leaving, as a face about stone, 
 You are more fatherless I tell them 
 I would come from 
 To be love's lovers and come unto me, 
 And all helps earth from the Thames;
