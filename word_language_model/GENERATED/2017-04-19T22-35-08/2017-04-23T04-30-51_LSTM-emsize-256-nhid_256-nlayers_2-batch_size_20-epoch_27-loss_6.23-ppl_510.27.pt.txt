The Triviality Of Kandinsky'S Pine, 

 cross-dressers built on de sunlit wave, 
 Half spring of Whips ridges on stones;-- 
 I who-- here's my flesh and gaze at home 
 When I reached one and lived six and friends love. 
 This sweet day I know aptly mourn, 
 But I wish you could not speak for me. 
 I find my way brawling. However, it is white. 
 Who could you be telling me everything 
 I could journey and tell them I've had to hurt.
