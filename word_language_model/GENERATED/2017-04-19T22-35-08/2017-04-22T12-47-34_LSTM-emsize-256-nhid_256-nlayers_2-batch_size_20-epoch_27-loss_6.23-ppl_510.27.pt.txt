 They dream of them as just as they love they locked 
 
 At the beginning of fault. 
 We are the greatest life of the Lord, 
 this is some times, half-stopped and hatched 
 Ya-honk and, feast: 
 furled; the lesser weight of cotton 
 Onto the holes that share the picture southern 
 Unable to make sweat from that point between reward; 
 & its beauty always moving and laid 
 the spine of the brim that we would watch 
 
 our morning
