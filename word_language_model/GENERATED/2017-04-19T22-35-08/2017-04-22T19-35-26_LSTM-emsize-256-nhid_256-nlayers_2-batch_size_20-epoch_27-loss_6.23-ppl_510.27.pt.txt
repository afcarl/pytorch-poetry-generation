Shooting Closer 

 Down the long halls, to the room, for slack 
 They, look backwards at divinely and echoed to the stone, 
 It's certain for a moment less than a poem 
 It never did nor miss it as it should purchase it hurt? 
 So to herself. 
 
 
 
 Once I walked by here holding firm 
 And felt young give the lake to love, I made you feel 
 intimacy on a island of trees, 
 So a now:--thou rocked into air;
