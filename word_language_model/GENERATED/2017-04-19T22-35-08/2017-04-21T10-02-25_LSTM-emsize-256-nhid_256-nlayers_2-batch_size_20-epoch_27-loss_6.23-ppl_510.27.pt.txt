 Then, lock the world with all its cities 
 Closing the substance with dust, 
 And the glory of Tamerlane, 
 A proud thought mountains; only 
 And a hand might cling at its place, 
 And the planet's will arrive 
 Like the sun or overhead 
 That Sunday year in storm 
 
 I tried to sing you 
 Only a light without truth. 
 
 We slit this hill and along the room, 
 You have conquered my foot, and I sleep.
