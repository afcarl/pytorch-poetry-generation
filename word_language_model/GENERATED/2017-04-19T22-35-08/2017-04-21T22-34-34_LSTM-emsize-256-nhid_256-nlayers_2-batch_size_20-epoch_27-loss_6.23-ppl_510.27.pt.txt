It Grieves, 

 And long before shadows above, 
 Girardeau, from the horizon after. 
 
 Ah! still I look by a bird that respun? 
 So that pierced across the main, 
 By shining isles; 
 Clear'd up the high eucalyptus smoke inscrutably, 
 I await a grape perhaps-- 
 It thrills with it? Nor does this like to discover 
 By his own age now gliding through my wonsli 
 If all men Please yield I turn two times away 
 To give me the fuck-the-work-week
