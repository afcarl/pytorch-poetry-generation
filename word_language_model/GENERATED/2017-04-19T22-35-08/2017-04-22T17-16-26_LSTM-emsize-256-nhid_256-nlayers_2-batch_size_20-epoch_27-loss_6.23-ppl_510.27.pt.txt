 The drums of the years; 
 The delicious nation: 
 The doorjamb, 
 The antenna. 
 Till the coup sto'ed down 
 O'er the prairies of the blast, 
 The smell of moonlight strait at hand 
 Is a tempest of the mind of a king. 
 But the crack of his love became his voice. 
 Its growth stops on the water, on the lawn 
 A crowd germinates like a rainbow moon. 
 Beaten with it, 
 Along the railroad way he stands there,
