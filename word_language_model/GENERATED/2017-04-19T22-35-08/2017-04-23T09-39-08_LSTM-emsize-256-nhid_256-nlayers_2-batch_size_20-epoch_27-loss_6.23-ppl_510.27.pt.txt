 As ever, was everywhere, 
 And the little snake, kind Slow sorrow of a fine 
 whale, 
 
 tendre face spirals at the darkness. 
 In a living world a drum, 
 
 There were forgotten limits 
 
 in Tennessee. 
 
 When the song was buried 
 Just as three perfumes we took 
 The risk of the conflict, over the stars. 
 The threads looked shows; 
 While the teeth were passing. 
 They had a lot of love
