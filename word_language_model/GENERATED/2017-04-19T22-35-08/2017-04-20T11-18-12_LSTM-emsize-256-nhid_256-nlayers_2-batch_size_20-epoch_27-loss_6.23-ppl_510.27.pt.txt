 Otherwise dear one, 
 Only, when I am suffer'd"--Perish of crows. 
 
 I would be an encroaching 
 to the top of your eyes 
 and sit in 
 my sweeping cold hands 
 so the wing glove 
 though the worry is stronger and sitting, 
 and more stuff than not 
 a full source the way 
 and the future is undone the time -- and the moment 
 as my lightâ€”of you pull its heart. 
 We drink more hands 
 and settle
