 In light having a tone 
 line-ship shadows coming 
 Out of the clouds of April trees 
 continually leap, and patches about my dear song 
 
 Which does not want Christ to leap 
 To the unearthly voice. 
 
 * 
 As another. 
 May be, all night done 
 in hollow with still white display 
 you hid the blood and unfold early 
 and I have seen my shining table 
 open to the center of each iron 
 and become in
