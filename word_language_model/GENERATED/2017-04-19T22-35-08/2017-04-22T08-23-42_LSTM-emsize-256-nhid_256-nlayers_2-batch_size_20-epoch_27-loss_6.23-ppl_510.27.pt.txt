Bulbs 

 From the dark, and think around them, 
 As it now has finished from threats to mind: 
 And thus, not of? What should it please up 
 The equidistant mind 
 By what time was called its name its might fall. 
 I go softly & the pain made quick. 
 They thought they were so foolish 
 They grown up and became 
 In doll; 
 Quite Glints to find lunch in a car 
 And proceeded with and with perfume 
 to join
