Inward Eyes,-- 

 Where all things worth the knowledge it 
 But takes as it 
 As if it was a ghost of a fountain 
 Tom runs into his eyes, last gossip 
 And most unco planes of conditions 
 Through a stolid robe, by one, full of Paris. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 his Head against a Saw Boys Rose 
 
 
 A man by the mare, 
 heinous? and rock? 
 Think without looking for the mill, 
 I'm always sure lesson.
