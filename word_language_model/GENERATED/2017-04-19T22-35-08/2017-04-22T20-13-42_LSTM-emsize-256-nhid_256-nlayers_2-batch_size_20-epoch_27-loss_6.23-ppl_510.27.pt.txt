 This is the mess of my bier? 
 
 The hand of the inky horse 
 Well? 
 
 It chills 
 at the right, 
 finding stars, 
 the canyon fields 
 grow profonde 
 till it thrum-- 
 
 its western leather 
 
 Last night's hard 
 enclosure after the violets made 
 
 by the glint 
 of circles, and its 
 
 beautiful dream 
 
 a crossing unshaken 
 with its indifference, 
 a chains of light 
 on the face,
