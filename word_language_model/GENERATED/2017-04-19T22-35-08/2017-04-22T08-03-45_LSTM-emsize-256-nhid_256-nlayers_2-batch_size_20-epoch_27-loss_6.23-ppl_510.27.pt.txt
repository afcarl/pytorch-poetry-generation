Back Upon 

 With fear the bodies of extinct angels 
 With their desires their lives? 
 
 So from within the turning of March 
 Where people drowse the gnawing machine 
 
 In a port of sun, 
 Youth and harbingers of stour, 
 That dreads, at sound," 
 
 backbone ride from 
 The press I have been ever 
 Or been belovd the suicide of the present 
 
 And a drunken, squirrel finding tearing out 
 This year, and you clean your rib
