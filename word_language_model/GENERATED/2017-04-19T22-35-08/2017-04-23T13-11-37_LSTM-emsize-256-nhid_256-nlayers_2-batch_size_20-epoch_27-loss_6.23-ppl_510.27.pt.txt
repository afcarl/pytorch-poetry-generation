Drew, 

 
 Don't laugh as I lose a prey of my making, 
 And such a man I haven't heard 
 Or a man with a import or "That's a sell 
 of which he lives as long as the birds light 
 their passing threads 
 black, curled down, but strange as the flashy shapes 
 of the lowering plum? ordinary. 
 
 I could not even trouble into my hands 
 the long cotton whistle lost in their bodies. 
 
 
 
 I knew
