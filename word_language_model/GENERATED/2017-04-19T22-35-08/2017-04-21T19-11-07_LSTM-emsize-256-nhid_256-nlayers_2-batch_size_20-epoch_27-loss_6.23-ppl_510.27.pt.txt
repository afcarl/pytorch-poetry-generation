Are There. 

 
 I can have been born with your spilt; 
 Right in between Gary races, on the eaves. 
 They are with no illusion of the weapons, eternal man: 
 My mother keeps me here. What else shall I pass; 
 I seek on this world no other things; 
 No matter where I am not here! 
 I'll feel eating the night, I would learn 
 At knowing that, seeing one's great fingertips. 
 
 From their ashes at the feet they ring through
