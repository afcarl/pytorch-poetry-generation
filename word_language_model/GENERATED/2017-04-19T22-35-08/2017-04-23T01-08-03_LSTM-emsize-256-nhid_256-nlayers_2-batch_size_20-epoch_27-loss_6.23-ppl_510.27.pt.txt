The Heart, 

 
 And the vessels fields, the food, 
 
 We talked when a moonbeam 
 Comes to the sea. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Wreck of the Dead Road 
 
 
 Though the rise shall quicken and cling 
 For a thousand memories, as for a minute 
 While you have departed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Light 
 
 
 I 
 
 The wind a serpent called the sky, 
 And there on halcyon day the sea
