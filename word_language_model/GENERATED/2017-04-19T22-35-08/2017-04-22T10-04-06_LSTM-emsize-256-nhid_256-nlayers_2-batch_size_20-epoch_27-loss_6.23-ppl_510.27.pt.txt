Years? 

 His neck on his wrist stops the colors 
 
 Of Saturday seersucker prongâ€” 
 And the fury of the gate: 
 The brown-faced cross, that rises in the crotch, 
 And there that shot the sun shall leap here 
 To lift the flying apples Krishna 
 
 Two full levels of the effaced Brain. 
 
 Many a week, a proud wrecked face, 
 Intent upon the other, not to throw 
 Only the dumb lines into summer.
