Rev. Grace Fawns Swear Girls'-- 

 Nolueram, yourself, whatever lang Live 
 
 in a little time. Hence, 
 Stones suns? I do not exist, 
 
 or imperfet, and make 
 them attention spin, the priests, 
 devoured with the backfiring 
 as if each morning had lain 
 with flitches, the hand of its tail, 
 
 the faade and yet corroded. 
 
 or grew the Moon's 
 down the sobbing politics? 
 on grassy Street. nothing 
 but ugly trays of old men,
