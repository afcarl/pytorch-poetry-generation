Times . . . 

 Heart 
 
 The last like moves 
 Is not the devil's twice 
 Save soon to sleep. 
 
 Be sure that's so, I pay to rest 
 Thunder, the legacy 
 That is the way unseen, 
 And I remember 
 The ocean 
 And the tiny flowers its last ticks 
 Wore my perfect voice to me. 
 
 
 
 Of absence, earth or swans 
 Drives with trees, splendid and den, 
 And vanished springs and quyk
