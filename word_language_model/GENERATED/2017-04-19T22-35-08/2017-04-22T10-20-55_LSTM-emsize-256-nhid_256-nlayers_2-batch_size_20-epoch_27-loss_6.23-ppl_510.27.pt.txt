Light 

 
 gesecean, into another's charity 
 With never a moment's drink, that 
 should drink my summer chamber echoer. 
 And I upon them all my books. 
 Ten years they have pour'd off your laws, 
 And may not hear my tears, 
 Sometimes a faint sun holds a gold sheaf of foam, 
 Pass back to catch its shining din; 
 How happy might the birds be flown, 
 To turn the Lord? 
 
 No shivers there can be plenty of error,
