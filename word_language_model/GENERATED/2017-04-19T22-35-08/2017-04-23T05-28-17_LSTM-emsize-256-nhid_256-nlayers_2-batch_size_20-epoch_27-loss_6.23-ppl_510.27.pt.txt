And Sighed, 

 Twenty has its fill of hearing and name; 
 And when the sirens rest in silence. 
 Have I done mankind damnfool, 
 In which to see how he should love my towers 
 Between the cruel stones, spun, 
 Eternal old age, whom countries worked in trap 
 All the orphan's awkward 
 Amongst his life, which I wake. 
 
 Then the country (as he had said hence, 
 What answer should take a eyebrows. 
 I leave my spoon and recite.
