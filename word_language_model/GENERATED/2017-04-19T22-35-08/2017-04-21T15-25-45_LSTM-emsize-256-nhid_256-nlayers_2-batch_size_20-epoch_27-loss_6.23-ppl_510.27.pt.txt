Paix. Garment 

 Up the sidestreets through so green we want 
 And sit with news with their agony 
 In warm and middle true. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Yellow Dark. The Task, corporate Graveyard of Connecticut, 
 
 
 Exit certainly, how have you been? 
 Let me not forget, because between you, till my lovers saw 
 How my fingers see two lines on my bare shoulders home 
 To wander by the corners, effaced, child's and cunning. 
 And trap's happy papers,
