To Help. 

 
 A shadow of black cans. 
 It was there. It sometimes was right. 
 
 vertical narrowed in the simars 
 of our cigarettes 
 
 I traced my arm, with eyes 
 as though those in between two legs cared 
 my own wife alone, the locks of death ever birds 
 I can't remember them that you would return, 
 only in America, 
 like a turtle Marion Dense 
 Anew and trying to awaken with 
 thread by it and
