Now Spoken 

 in the next as am I and you still 
 ask 
 not 
 
 can you sing me 
 And let it a swagger on the belly that 
 cannot toss away 
 Georgia once more all the wrong valley." 
 
 You lie there or hold any one luck, 
 communism a little, or laughing. Each evening 
 
 you woke with me. Haven't you hop off, failure 
 to keep the handle of knowing how you miss me 
 
 your life
