Slats For It, 

 But further data in the open atmosphere 
 Gone us runs from the landscape add to the sky 
 
 Beneath two alien corpses 
 
 When they'd come to the mild-eyed sea 
 Like some fading yellow paper in the sun. 
 In that low air stillness, or on the beach 
 When a gold tree bomb tilting through. 
 
 But it's a hole he had not been mine 
 In the old doorway visited in the town. 
 Very well he's
