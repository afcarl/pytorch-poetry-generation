 everywhere. The wind leaves us carved 
 
 in the throat of our hands, 
 
 over the Muses run 
 and find 
 the paths in humble 
 and our life 
 coming in field 
 
 cannon-smoke Africa, look back 
 in the bedroom labour-house in skirt 
 beneath our lives. 
 When in the height of starlight, 
 there is an anxious, tyranny 
 of sweet --O 
 crow may begin to fall, 
 the water of air without end.
