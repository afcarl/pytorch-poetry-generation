Sphagnum- Black One Bomb. 

 What boots the Wolf, like hard 
 Who was not old by waters, 
 With one of them more sweet 
 Than adversary for the innocent prime 
 Of passing years. 
 Back to the east no sand gen'ral, 
 The number of Ferry demarcations, Death. 
 O God, slavery's foe 
 Had steadily also fallen 
 From the world's suffus'd, 
 Why, close my heart, and wipe me down 
 To die pauses on the Door 
 
 To the vagrant angels,
