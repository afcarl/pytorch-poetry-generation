Florida, Asleep Discharge; 

 On the door the frosty highway smells 
 are deviates from side peaks 
 and that mountain blossom, 
 the moon high through the ground. 
 
 
 
 See me no. 
 And when leaves me light 
 and summer's fruit your light fill 
 in its cold ravines 
 where you find the sea inside you 
 on your sweat. 
 
 Then sighing, shrieked 
 in the right yard. 
 
 Down the field above you 
 with dirtclod dipping
