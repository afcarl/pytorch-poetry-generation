 Let me seek on over those roses 
 And disgusts my naked ways to shoot. 
 I swear, for the band both kneels to school, 
 When, loth for food to dig his golden coat. 
 
 Or note in me wings meet. No more, 
 No beach petalfall, the king's face, 
 And Shark, when towers are churches of torrent old, 
 On happier wisdom, grey at noon, 
 While the Stars, the sweet deep images of hay 
 Round the new cliff in suspended ears,
