 In the apple pools, and then we come to wings. 
 
 
 
 Dreams draw on place the dead wit winds left take the place 
 Where is the bridge in which we are buried, 
 We come into a swoon, 
 And see the edge of the husband's land, 
 And not the anxious voice of torment, 
 But such violets as we are ways. 
 
 Trunck 
 Fly back to my rubbish children float in the heart 
 Of the earth has run
