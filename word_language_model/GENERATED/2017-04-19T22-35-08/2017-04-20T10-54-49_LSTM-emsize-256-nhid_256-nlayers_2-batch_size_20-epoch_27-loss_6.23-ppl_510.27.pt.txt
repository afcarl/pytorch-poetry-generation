 Well, these, when to all men think of this talent 
 Ride the care— 
 You know it's good, 
 I "is my Oreb: till you were born 
 and Spooking myself with coitus 
 as the stain of an open book 
 my name died: 
 the needles that cannot resist 
 the businesse, of a body like him— 
 trusting my clothes and teach me how 
 it swells & battering it crowing, 
 and for some things you've actually been,--alone,
