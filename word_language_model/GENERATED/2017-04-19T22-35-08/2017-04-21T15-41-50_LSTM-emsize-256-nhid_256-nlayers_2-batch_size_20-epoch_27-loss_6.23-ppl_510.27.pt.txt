 The lands from the rigging 
 Goes upwards to the trysted lyre. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Clod 
 
 
 How could I say, What other committees lift us. 
 There in life, do I not see her in the depth of my water 
 In flowers, I am not bewitched in the dim water 
 There is neither thousands of meat or merops 
 
 Were it possible so, but he loved him, said I, 
 Inhabiting my task very long, you.
