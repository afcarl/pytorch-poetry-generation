Sunny Day 

 And coffee showers, and through the western grass 
 Haunted by morning in the laddered white. 
 
 He turned from on to deck, the sound 
 Of lightning feeling out upon the reproductions 
 Of boys and on the borders and the cook's 
 Call'd in bright ruin, his plain week 
 
 Slowly dropping itself to the head; 
 But lo! out finding pain and spring: 
 satisfi'd and cross and grow there, 
 Each fate that keeps them, lo! the milk,
