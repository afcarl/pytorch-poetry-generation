For Miles In Air, 

 Up fan or tower to seize 
 By its first sun: Christ, that itself. 
 
 Pluck his words, untrodden heart. 
 All's useless. There shall lie 
 To one above. A century would remove 
 --Space, words of that. 
 Inspired, of a face: 
 Being hot. quartz, rights weaken between 
 Dim bottles and days, the fighting infancy 
 Serv-U by novels and darknesses 
 And furious he was greased. 
 
 Or a picture left of his own baldric
