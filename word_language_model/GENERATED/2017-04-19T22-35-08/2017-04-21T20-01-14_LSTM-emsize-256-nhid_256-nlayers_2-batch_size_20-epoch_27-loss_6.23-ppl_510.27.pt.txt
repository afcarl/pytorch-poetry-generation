Of Animals, 

 I heard from the silk Summer vote. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Song of History 
 
 
 Nice spring slopes or bark wine brown, 
 Language fit crackling in tummy, 
 slow edges of our pro-choice piano nights of beans, 
 swimming from the current of photographs, 
 the sash of trees have flown 
 On the internal rafters of great difference, 
 drained, and black grapes fears to stand wonhydum 
 Style better than we wait for the Finally 
 collarbone.
