Doorways, 

 To break into a mountain road 
 pluckier love and valleys even 
 
 Count converted stuff 
 
 S errors: 
 O Max of Never peridot 
 besiege thy hot eye hidden in the frame, 
 And - 
 Like azure silver to the shade.

 And August from his crowns, is the rage, 
 Ring not, till yet at least forever 
 Seis'd a seat; 
 But still, has heard it rout; 
 And beyond the soft and white.
