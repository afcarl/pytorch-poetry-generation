Than President 

 
 Of iron masquerades 
 And time itself be studying 
 A sort north of the life that lives. 
 I perish, wished quicker than does 
 Close my head pity! This one of the trees 
 Are dying for me; its pleasure is demanding 
 Gathering warfare above its loom 
 Comes into the East, in our eternity. 
 
 
 
 III. The room at rented feet in my hand 
 where Heaven is numb in looking. 
 I would not have lost.
