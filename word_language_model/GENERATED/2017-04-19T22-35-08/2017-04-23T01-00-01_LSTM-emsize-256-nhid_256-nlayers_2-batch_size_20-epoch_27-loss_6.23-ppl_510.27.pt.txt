 Where are you, this Misbegotten though.' 
 
 Is the long'd place, that it is raining up. 
 The kitchen over the left, is flaked and we are 
 good-naturedly & falls at first the spotless emptiness 
 Which is turned in the breath of ferns 
 And the curl of the garage is a strong tangle ... 
 I have only met the Twelfth-month Falls 
 In ofercumen, stronger than for love and for the indolence, 
 For the memory of which I follow'd it,
