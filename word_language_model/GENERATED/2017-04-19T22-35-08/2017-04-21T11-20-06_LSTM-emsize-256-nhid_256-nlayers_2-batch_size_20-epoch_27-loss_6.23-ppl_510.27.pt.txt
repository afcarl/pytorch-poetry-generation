Sick, 

 Said, Mr malkeinu 
 
 Why have I thought her March. 
 
 You have been squinting 
 and two minds if she face him 
 so play says, 
 
 * 
 
 Though you know whether you sink 
 You can no longer ward 
 Me in a French moment 
 Or I'll break you in your car 
 It is a gang-boss scarf, 
 taking your progress 
 With strapping terror 
 scraps, ambivalence.
