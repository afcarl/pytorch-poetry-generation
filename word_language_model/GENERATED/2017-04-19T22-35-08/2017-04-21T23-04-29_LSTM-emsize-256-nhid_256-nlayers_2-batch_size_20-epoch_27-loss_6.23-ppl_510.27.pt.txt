 Before I lift the hard toucan 
 towards the Bulge 
 asked us 
 of love. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ill here 
 
 
 In the crick to seemly 
 clumps of the Capitol talismans. plural Witches:"Double, dawn 
 
 with hair light wires, its glue heart 
 made me forget this morning 
 
 The frail faith of Greenwich pines, 
 shoes swim to bubbles 
 
 * 
 
 stocky as orange 
 
 Eyes full of broken cedar streets,
