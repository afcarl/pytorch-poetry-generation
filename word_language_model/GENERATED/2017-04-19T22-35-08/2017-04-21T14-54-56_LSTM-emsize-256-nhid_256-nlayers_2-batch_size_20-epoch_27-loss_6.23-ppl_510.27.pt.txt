The Sorcerer Is Astonished 

 One, see when I am answered go, 
 In waking smoke, the upward sod 
 Where had a winter span across the surface, 
 Within pillows at the window-sill to the queasy farm 
 Until lightning's face, 
 And the wall ramps turn back 
 On high jumpsuits into your trap 
 Though you keep a sweetest, rainbow admirable or 
 pine! My eight magazines mixed 
 About two hundred miles of sad cliffs, 
 The plink ragged beauty of the day.
