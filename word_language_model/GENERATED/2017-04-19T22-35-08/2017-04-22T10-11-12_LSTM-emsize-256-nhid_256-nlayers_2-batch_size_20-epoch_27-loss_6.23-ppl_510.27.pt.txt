With Rust. 

 
 The nose, went tired, falling out of sight. 
 A pail fell from a weedy lake; 
 Below the syncopated hemlocks; 
 No one dead man was singing on her throne; 
 While someone else goes back to fix 
 The lovely corpse with walls of sacrifice, 
 Rings and poetsâ€”the dumb that was rest, 
 And filled the record of the harvest day. 
 Among the moaning of the midnight hill 
 With Maiden and the god with inner turmoil spread 
 Calling
