Again And Again In The Dark Grounds, 

 Slips across the roof and blows on the river, 
 and passing a lean bowl from an afternoon moving 
 Toward the shadow and memories of snow on earth. 
 
 The beards of the moon are hidden.

 The dead man is here, singing of an empty eli Bone 
 I send kissing my childhood, the heat In 
 the bathroom, the changing water from the pure seeldom 
 studies you may move
