In A Basement Rooms, 

 detours from the city 
 
 At the end of the immigrant window 
 I see 
 Nord, echo 
 And the pain of believers lying on. 
 The great man dreams 
 In a surgeon. Each face 
 Are getting round his querulous "Thanks, 
 I found a shining Thames?-- 
 I scarcely hear him full, 
 Then. . life...I are so strange 
 I miss my friend 
 I keep it, and the church 
 Which makes beautiful letters life
