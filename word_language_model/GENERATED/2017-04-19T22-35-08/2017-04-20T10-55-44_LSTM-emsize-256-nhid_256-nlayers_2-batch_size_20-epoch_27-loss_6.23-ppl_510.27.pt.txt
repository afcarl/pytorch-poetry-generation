 
 All that I am is a wanderer under the neck, 
 the silver has rising off the factories, 
 Where Faith is years weightlessly the roadside winds assets 
 here, the head where the fuse roaring stubborn of the eye 
 is white as a crescent of the next dirt. 
 Then the map of it has no eyes? 
 
 Around earth in streets, it is as much as the land 
 and public rummaging you must wait 
 like Byzantines double leonine, 
 fenced
