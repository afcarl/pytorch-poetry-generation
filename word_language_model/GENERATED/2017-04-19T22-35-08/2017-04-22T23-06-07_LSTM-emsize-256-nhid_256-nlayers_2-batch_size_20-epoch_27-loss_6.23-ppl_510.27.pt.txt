 Escap't my helmet, brother, look! over, 
 As (sky are in Petersburg. Pluto, 
 Iâ€™m henceforth more than my own, 
 
 Is it funny that the soul is near; 
 There is nothing I can do. 
 
 It fell from the dead man's fine arm, 
 No going to lie still, 
 And I turn, 
 Watching through the boughs rise 
 And sew up the stiffness to my horn, 
 Was thy shadow golden, warpland 
 Set the song, me still to my fall;
