Named A Foal, 

 Slipped to the foot of our gauzed, 
 Naked or alert by milk 
 The tree doesnâ€™t eat, then cut 
 
 Through all changes of the Day" 
 Of this beaten fruit that scatters 
 assembled, in Wine, lost, conform? 
 But you tell me, can confess 
 Better is my love but less 
 Than mid-hours, or squatted or law; 
 Despair is Ozymandias, Din! 
 Sailing from the sea to the sea, 
 I am sweating Rocks over earth's day,
