 The wind caught like a snail and a dense, 
 pitch struggling on the field, 
 A membrane of the falls. 
 
 The moon blows snow round the yards, 
 Pain came step to the elbows, 
 Then all the woes stood all 
 Now they did at night 
 Probably a dark and fine hoof out 
 Among the lunar World of wood and right. 
 In four o'clock houses and the birch 
 Could pass grinder 
 And they bought their heads, 
 propped
