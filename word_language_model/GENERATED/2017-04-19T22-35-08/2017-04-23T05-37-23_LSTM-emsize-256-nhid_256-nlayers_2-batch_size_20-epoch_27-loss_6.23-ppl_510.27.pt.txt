 Safe in my brain like a man on a space 
 Over his belly, passages to me. 
 
 Such the grand diver each door is red 
 For early children, when the star is soft 
 As in an idol. Mizpeh's fewer. 
 Or only till the night, come; 
 And there is plenty of fire, or goes.

 The living, when the first relief, 
 Nor the noise rose may be on
