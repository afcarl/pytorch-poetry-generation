Burnt 

 Out on my college. Or leaves me less, 
 A stone carved like a dog to meet her: 
 Clear of the day that my fellow was prepared once dared 
 And to wear, to explain that it was me, something now 
 And making an arm my body trouble, or so 
 The brain, trying to whirr and sighing. 
 The moon has grown strong as strong as a clear, deeper cloud, 
 May, and hope of the flow of old beauty membranes. 
 But
