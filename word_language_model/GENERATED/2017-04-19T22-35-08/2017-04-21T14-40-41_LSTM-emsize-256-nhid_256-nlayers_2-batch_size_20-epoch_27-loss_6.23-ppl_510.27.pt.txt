Primate Kind, 

 and I may live for him to (ever 
 
 Saint Rose surprises the doors, 
 I've never seen a happy remark, 
 Nor learn that I've got tired eyes 
 Like body in a garden storm 
 That burned through every restless grain, 
 
 That cometh which many polish good 
 The phrase, but all of them combine. 
 A slow and headlong tongue or grace. 
 But when much are they get-it-together-dust 
 The faces of it were not mine.
