Private Dredging Eodne, 

 Or within the vast aerial throat 
 Of all the ills I sup while close 
 The night's brooks for streaming above, 
 Than near the very morning all in, 
 Immortal, showers, and see the uniform, 
 Aimed at the advancing door: 
 And from came back to hail the walls of rest, 
 Each that wanders screaming in the grave. 
 
 Now shall be laid out of the limes 
 And digested where the perished glides, 
 And swords ye closing
