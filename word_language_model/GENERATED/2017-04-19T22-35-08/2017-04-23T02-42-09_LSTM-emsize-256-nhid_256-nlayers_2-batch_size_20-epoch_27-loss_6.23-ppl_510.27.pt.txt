 I have forgotten how 
 it happened it is 
 on this shallow 
 
 gift, my body 
 reaches to the ground 
 let there sail 
 what's there 
 or even the work 
 of so much narrowing 
 you read the hour 
 they will be blue 
 as another health 
 threw them up to 
 love and when 
 you could throw your breath. 
 
 
 
 
 The sound of no mercy sweep her grave notwithstanding,
