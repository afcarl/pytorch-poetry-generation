Even The Party 

 Beat in at fields of the flashing ice or west itself 
 Beside it grandmother's trees, leaving 
 Its building for the center of the stands 
 And there is no sound 
 And scale the river . . . a friend is overcome. 
 
 "An Shaw and launched in a new dust 
 Where Struggles all around the errands door, 
 And riding -- the cuff of a dumb white sea 
 That fills above her. 
 
 And from on street
