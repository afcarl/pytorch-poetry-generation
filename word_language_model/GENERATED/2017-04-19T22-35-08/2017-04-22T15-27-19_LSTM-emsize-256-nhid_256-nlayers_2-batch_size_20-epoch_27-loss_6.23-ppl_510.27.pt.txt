 At night on spring deep by the blankets, 
 Hides skill up to a thrill: 
 Wipe the splashes of pasture yellow shut 
 In the crystal forsaken, 
 Golden dot and unfulfilled bars. 
 All sides of rough stationary slate 
 Flowing idly on the stilled brink, 
 All its magnificence from to the far River 
 And the sunset darkens at the wall. 
 
 We, too gentle 
 Phoebus' dirges, more than 
 dangled down Grammarian's gas, cold buildings 
 The polished wall around
