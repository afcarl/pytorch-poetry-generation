And I Said, Flams Soon 

 
 As God from the rise of the street 
 When you die Devil has loved me. 
 
 The arm stands in the weeds 
 Of the flat autonomy 
 Of the ten-year-old 
 Told his mouth all America. 
 
 An unemployed with black passion 
 Probing rising from the dizzying outputs 
 And walked the alligator with blood to graze 
 One ghost drooped the white and white, 
 And then with the returning, 
 His shape have closed
