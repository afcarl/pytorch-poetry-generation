 That I can't glister now 
 Good merriment to crown dreams 
 For the wrong person. 
 Think not said, were we not Jack, 
 To learn that we were born of morn. 
 I like to see the path Posset: 
 The stars behind it, single faces, 
 Listen! I'll he. 
 
 Not from its true beds nor bliss: 
 Not merely fools enough, 
 But all my treasure, 
 I hate a prophet and a kiss 
 Which have some fickle parts salt
