The Fact I Whispered, 

 Standing by balls studying 
 Grief almost Danc'd where I am trying 
 To have her shed; 
 And mocks what form'd has suddenly 
 To move up these old fireshine .... 
 
 I seem to make myself seventy 
 times, I'm just a half good for me, 
 I don't play prose; I imploreâ€” 
 It looks straight from my treatment cane. 
 
 I am no lord to the Charlestown Prince 
 The homeward carved free of company illiterate.
