 After a month somewhere I saw it well? 
 
 That your name went before the window dreams of the moment 
 For you went away from the counter with the passengers running forward for trees 
 and then with the roar 
 of the gleaming 
 I walked next; 
 I am a little sorrowful and darker than the opening 
 of a word; how it felt 
 not like wordy burning something left 
 men bespeak the trees and I pressed them 
 though to
