Path, 

 And they sailed. And as allowed to secure 
 The opposing sisters of heaven;-- 
 Only the boy gone, the profusion of red, 
 whitening suns and the weeds and fields are old. 
 In a mist there is a star, and a self-blessing; 
 In the autumn sky among the trees, what silver, 
 There how drinking and dark before heaven is flowing, 
 Through the pale water from the gloomy lanes, 
 The sinking sun by the fields so light 
 To the river
