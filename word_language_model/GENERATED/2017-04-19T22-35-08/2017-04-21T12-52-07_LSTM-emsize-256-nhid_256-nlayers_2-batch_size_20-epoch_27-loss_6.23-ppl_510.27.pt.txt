And Being Gone 

 With a slit that wilderness, 
 A ripple so much she said, 
 'I have lived with quiet and hard and 
 Especially that she'll fall to the stake 
 That she can know no moaning evening, 
 read by the first day, 
 fails. The next away 
 
 Glue is a table horse 
 This clean poem 
 
 There's a bitch. I admit 
 
 You struggled and fifties 
 Going on, selling 
 You had touched them there.
