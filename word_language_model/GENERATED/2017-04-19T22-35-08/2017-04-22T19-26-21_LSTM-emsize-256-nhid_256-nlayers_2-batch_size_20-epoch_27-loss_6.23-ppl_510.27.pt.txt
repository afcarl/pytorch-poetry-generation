 No meaning, no cure shall be trick-- 
 From my hand, in shadowy face 
 Round the curtains seen; 
 The fields that are virga/a and deep: 
 The white fruit swirled with the sun that seems 
 In a Beebe, pointing in spring, 
 Then subtly fields of plenty, 
 Next the storm has shone 
 On years forgotten there is stolen â€” 
 And another movement, 
 That no very hard wound is now 
 Then a passion is to be got, 
 Gleaming as
