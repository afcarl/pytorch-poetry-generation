 He would grow thou'll younger; 
 By six loud device, and servant, 
 I must propound, 
 When the Khalifa comes to the slots by Street 
 And planted by his marvellous eyes. 
 
 There's no birds now and ships so weak. 
 
 They'll stare upon the columns of goats 
 And climb to the goats and pray. 
 
 It is careless that the world began, 
 Whole centuries from their Christmas morn 
 And meagre flitting in the well, 
 And we said:
