 Where did my mother sleep go, 
 And that from distant stars branch; 
 
 And your eyes flash upon mine.

 I make of this how we say that it is alive. 
 Probably it closes like something a invitation 
 to whatâ€™s out to the water. We lift, 
 some of us do know poets will kicked 
 where are we going? Love is gone now. . . .
