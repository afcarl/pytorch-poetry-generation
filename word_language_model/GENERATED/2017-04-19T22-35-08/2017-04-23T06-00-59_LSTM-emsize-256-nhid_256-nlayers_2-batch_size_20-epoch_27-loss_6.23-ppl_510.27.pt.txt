Listen, I Don'T 

 dare not ease it, 
 Don't be going thought. 
 (I guess it wasn't until it melts like a whale 
 or weep, who would tell. 
 
 Once, in his life was coming. 
 A glass as the bright teeth 
 along a maroon pitcher, 
 a blanket of buds behind me, 
 gold eyes of a probing Licorice, 
 
 surrounded by his hand 
 in chance I saw him when he rolled 
 an ache rang again and again, 
 and
