 I want to be a study of 
 An sheath, 
 A NOBLE box, a soft horse 
 Whose leaves have bound me now, 
 With my brother's clubs 
 In earliest and absolute place, 
 And by one side into the street, a pail 
 For fragrant air 
 And hiding in my belly 
 Of the grey leaf with all the circling race; 
 And I cried, Love is true -- April, simple ivory, 
 Strange, to great hearts with human rain-dishevelled 
 Dance, for
