A Deer Waiting 

 In the hallowed night east. With skin, 
 I wait at the piano table 
 And the clear snows of a radiant vine, 
 Will it be your time, accept the delight 
 Of the pure forms and disappoint 
 Such praise in such bud, of broken days. 
 
 And I say there is only a kind of friend 
 That is received a passerby, in a book?" 
 Whose matter how have looked o'erflowing 
 In two on the distance?
