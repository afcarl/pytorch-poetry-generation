For I Know 

 pimply and deeper trunks of fellâ€” 
 A mantle, ne'er less Orisha 
 Than an courage spells, 
 Than a stroll to tame the bay, 
 Repeating its very secret few 
 Nights not returning dumb, 
 No braver human memories of tone: 
 Honesty, appetite and shallowness brave. 
 I see it not in vanished to love. 
 A light bloated without its end 
 Not from me and there is no cows. 
 
 It is the narcissus that runs and goes,
