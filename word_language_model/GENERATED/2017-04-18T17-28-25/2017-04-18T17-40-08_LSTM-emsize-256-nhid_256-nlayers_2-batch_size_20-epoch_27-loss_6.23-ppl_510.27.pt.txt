 
 The rain is a mystery of every car; 
 I shan't behold, once by what Neptune's 
 Strange shape! For there is a lie no 
 To spring or touch, is one a cause 
 To wear it upon the bridge or continent, 
 The stifling wings of body, and the world. 
 It is not only what you think of cattle? 
 
 Not in the anticipating all that quickness 
 Of life on guilt, which makes that man 
 That one observes a metaphor
