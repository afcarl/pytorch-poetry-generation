 Who could stand Locution 
 And give us no more, 
 Only the charm is not the instance of this distant Stones, 
 A great ruck, Haven of persimmons;

 Puts more sweet." 
 
 Do thou mark with these Tongues, and of lovers, 
 With her fair-- 
 rich hair, tho' our soft heads, 
 This true day, since we brought our life 
 Back and
