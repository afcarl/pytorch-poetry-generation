Have Thy Subdue, 

 Peter's--the gr√°ce: mix and begemmed with sure accents 
 fairy-tale, 
 Have cut from the sweep and the ships he shee 
 Flat on the Atlantic. 
 Ichneumon-rat how music turns 
 At night hushed in the air is a wound, 
 "All of tune, and food; 
 Where lights will fill the field, 
 Where beauty and its apple-tree 
 Find up its prophet, and his slide were clean o'er me, 
 Like leaves of darkness and of chaste or leaving.
