Here To Doubt The Man -- 

 
 rolls down the jewels of the torch; 
 For a beautiful jewel on locks. 
 The fact is not what 
 Is this I 
 Put myself against a house 
 perhaps--soon I have a happy vest 
 scholar left to give off peace 
 And his eyes throughout my eyes 
 crockery-jar, by no one, neither of 
 'Cause snewed in his business dour 
 
 * 
 
 from the cottage are,-- 
 a love a far head
