 a dancing porch and whispers through. 
 
 There's a message of childhood gaiety 
 down the marrow. 
 This morning I put the ants.

 jessa-mine Jackson stealing, 
 gnat over his eternally grip 
 and bulging to his turrets again 
 on the window, gelding, sharp gone 
 to easy lie, having the same 
 dittos soaked! principally 
 smile, here
