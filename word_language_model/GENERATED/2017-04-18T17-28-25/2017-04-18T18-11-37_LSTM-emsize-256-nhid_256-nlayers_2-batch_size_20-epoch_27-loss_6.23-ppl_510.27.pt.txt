 Then he left me so soon, 
 Surface you're dead about the knife. 
 Hard stuff . . ." 
 She was there, 
 With tears, with many years 
 Or the hefty Norway 
 
 Show me - at the cut, 
 Beings at mothers recovers. 
 I want to call my father all 
 Until she waits for her. 
 I'm sorry I was sure, 
 I'd ask myself, I said. 
 There'll be your demons under skin. 
 Are you sold when you were
