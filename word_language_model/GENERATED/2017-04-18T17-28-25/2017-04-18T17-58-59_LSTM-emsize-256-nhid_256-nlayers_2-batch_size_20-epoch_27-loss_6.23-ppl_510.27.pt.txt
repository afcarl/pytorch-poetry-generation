The Duke On The Dead Left Hand 

 Gravity in the top of my eye. For I 
 permeates the world night in blackness. 
 I see my way in Riveting and tackle Drenched 
 In time and my rapturous snapshots? 
 The tenor plays like the neighboring winds 
 Gasping in the dove's help. 
 
 The fire in evening you stretched to precedent: 
 At night in middle countries when I lay 
 In lonely spires you dragged me through the world; 
 I was smoking
