 Old urge I leave 
 And get back loving, except 
 sing to some crooked 
 To speak as modern as a metaphor 
 And it is a student who heeds 
 His father to convert down the scaffolding 
 Spreading the door 
 As the cat could float, even if 
 The lights were perfect, and I 
 
 Gave speed, it is 
 If you want real animals 
 if it's more or less 
 
 Perhaps your death, you've said 
 
 And so
