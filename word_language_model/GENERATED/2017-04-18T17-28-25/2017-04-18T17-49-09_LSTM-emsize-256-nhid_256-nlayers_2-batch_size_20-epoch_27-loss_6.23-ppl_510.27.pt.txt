 
 And soon gave you your name 
 The snawie-bosom alleys, 
 Says really, panics like 
 O' the wharves red on grassy 
 road? 
 The bridle and the wind, 
 Are all gone still; 
 What one delight is me for? 
 There is a kind of moan, 
 The sea is white, a wetness bark 
 And a brick dress of waves begin together 
 Down to relieve a magic 
 
 In stiff proportions 
 Are the instruments in grassy darkness
