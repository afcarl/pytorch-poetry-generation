 Went back to the bottom, places 
 That a cousin always came from another. 
 Silas was done for Mom 
 With his sweet JesusMaryandJoseph! 
 Books, City, Thine. 
 
 Neither does obeyes give, 
 Nor could add that rosary. 
 
 About, after thee another lawyer 
 That the blockhead spirit has one day, 
 No sickness in our flesh. 
 Wishing the name of the wrecked marriage kind, 
 Our special way to the living measure up 
 As we enter the line.
