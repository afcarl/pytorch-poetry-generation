I Be. 

 
 
 
 At the boulder my heart is especially 
 as what's often given, now 
 must be simply a myth of asphalt sky 
 care, the soul of splendour bloom 
 on this indifferent evening of optical stillness, 
 (sha)man keeps weeping on his swelling 
 
 lethargy of years ago now he wears 
 
 towards the crevicesâ€” the smooth black 
 whiskers and the dull act of being 
 waiting in company. 
 And what did he remember now? 
 Nothing
