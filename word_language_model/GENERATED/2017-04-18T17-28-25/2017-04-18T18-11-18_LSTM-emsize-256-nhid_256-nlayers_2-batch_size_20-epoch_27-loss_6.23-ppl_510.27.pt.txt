 Bones, 
 The conscious 
 Of finds that which 
 
 Dream of the mind, 
 Since lovers were Pennsylvanians. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Damp Faces 
 
 
 This is where the frigid needles 
 Dangers, and blossom asleep, 
 Thou go upward, banks. 
 It is the way,' lovely ten; 
 
 Willows - miracles! 
 Pity leave to his saddle, 
 Vaulted in rein, 
 When the worst of them lies down. 
 
 Unsatiate and dry, the burden of emeralds.
