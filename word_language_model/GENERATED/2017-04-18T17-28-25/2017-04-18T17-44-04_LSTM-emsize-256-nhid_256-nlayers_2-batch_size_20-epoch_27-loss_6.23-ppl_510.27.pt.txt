I Taught Him Who Daydreams, 

 not because I could translate out, 
 
 That even a million who have tooken impediment; 
 
 Their asphalt coats off these lines, limbs of evergreen 
 themselvesâ€”a More hares and mud-pie stutter 
 through and matted like a glittering sunburned child's geometry 
 whose machine a trades in ruined sculpture 
 like desperate. 
 
 And I will eat the daisies, you kept 
 St. mothlike blur of willows. 
 
 At once the sun breaking, light honeyed light
