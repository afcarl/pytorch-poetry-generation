The City 

 nice!" the dry and ancient weather. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Finis 
 
 
 On the forge's fountain, each person 
 I press down like rusty ways! 
 And passing April while my open eyes. 
 I sing a tree before the miles-deep world and fear, 
 When my winters beat in greenish River, 
 Come up, O lilac to high-ranking 
 Fortune and fables flow on my face; 
 Now afar some dead stray, as if there were God? 
 I chart
