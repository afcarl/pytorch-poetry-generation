 Sultans sweat on the magnitude. 
 
 The judge puffs into salt 
 to some foot-falls mouth, 
 all begging for certain years. 
 
 
 4. 
 
 Sunlight goes all down 
 an birth-strangled jar, 
 but never comes up himself 
 just as it first seems to come, 
 it has its nose 
 on wild smoke. 
 
 In history, in separate night 
 a pink feather, 
 a fine reservoir 
 whose anonymity 
 heard itself, 
 table a pipe 
 dried
