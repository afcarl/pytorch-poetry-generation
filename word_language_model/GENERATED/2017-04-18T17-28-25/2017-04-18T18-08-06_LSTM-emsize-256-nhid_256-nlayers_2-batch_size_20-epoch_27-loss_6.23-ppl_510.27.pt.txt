Over 

 When you want a small rate 
 Like to me again 
 And now it will never chance you know. 
 
 The idea may explode as your face resembles 
 Let me break, and renew your own sweet hair back and burn 
 Live down to all it will become for fog 
 For you now, it will enjoy, 
 Or live near small clouds with singing of crosswords, 
 But not pain in place or the rooftree or the rain, 
 Or to guess
