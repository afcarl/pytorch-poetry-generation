It Will Be For Me, 

 With abstract light, a warrior is the wall. 
 
 IV 
 The Ace, themâ€”She and the where 
 Is cast my waist's I could. 
 
 VIII 
 And I, as it first comes home, 
 Let that sun from beauty rise and go. 
 And leaves your hand in a mist: 
 In the gloom and flower of sleep, 
 will look upon it as it will, 
 A thousand years and all day long.
