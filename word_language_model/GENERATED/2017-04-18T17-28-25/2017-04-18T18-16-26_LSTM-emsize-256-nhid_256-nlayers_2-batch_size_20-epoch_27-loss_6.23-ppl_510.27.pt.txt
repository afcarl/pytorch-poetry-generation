Athletes And Eye 

 And swim by the sounds, 
 And let the world poke inward hands 
 and out locked heart of the clouds; 
 Hot winds of snow are peeling overhead, 
 blood leaves ferns on the spotted bark, 
 nibble covering woods, wet houses switching 
 as stars through rock and shelves. 
 
 Ask friends millet and too." 
 
 
 
 Whenever we turned the eye 
 to keep long, you pulled your leaves 
 to the eyes, 
 and it Tockytock,
