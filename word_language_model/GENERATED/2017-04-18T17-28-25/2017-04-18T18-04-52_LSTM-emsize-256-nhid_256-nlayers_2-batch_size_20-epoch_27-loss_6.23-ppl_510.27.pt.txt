Know 

 Magee to her America! 
 
 Some souls stand down, strange way? 
 
 Her sleek lips hang from every mirror, 
 and felt only the silence: 
 like the breath of a horse 
 in a vein; room 
 
 is no longer destiny 
 for the jewel of poems eyes. 
 And at the possible. 
 You love so true you disappeared, then fall, 
 and you, the heft of a dove. 
 And other islands look too alive. 
 They cover what is
