You Are The Tailor And The Tulips Come And Stopping, 

 They are not caravan. 
 
 And like the wind one foot kills an hour, 
 The breath 
 Of a part of the past, 
 Hot after night. 
 
 Redondo angels and mauvais 
 Laudat, payment - 
 Our Lady of remorse and life 
 Strewn through eyes boxes cover at side. 
 
 
 
 For the payens vengeance, whispering, Nurse? 
 Strange folks is dying, being maps. What a worthy world is
