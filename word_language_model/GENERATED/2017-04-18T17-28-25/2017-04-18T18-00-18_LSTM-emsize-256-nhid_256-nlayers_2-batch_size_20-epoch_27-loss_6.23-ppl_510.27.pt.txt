There In The Eyes Of The Bay 

 Where the sun wam, ere in classical things and reason, far responsibility 
 Of the willows went exploding through boughs upon the roofs, 
 Hot of dreaming sunset, white howling in the brim, 
 But the heads of the falling hand were quiet, seven months. 
 
 Through the America, 
 Only over the lake the grove, 
 Follow the great dune, and all the hearts of someone else's 
 siblings and the mole I spool with the ebb-tide!
