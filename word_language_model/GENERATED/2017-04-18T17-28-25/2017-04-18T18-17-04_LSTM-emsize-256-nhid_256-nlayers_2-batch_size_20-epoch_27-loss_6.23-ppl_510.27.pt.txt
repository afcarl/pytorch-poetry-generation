The Street 

 As they are learning to lie 
 In the creakings and compass of the day joysticking 
 Or the King I heard, you are read, my tears.

 The volunteer, the flashy spider, the specter of a kiss, 
 The Scarlet Ocean unties the harvest banks, ... blisses. 
 To break, Pierced in uprose. 
 
 Now in the swamp, the woodland flowers out; 
 The youth and braver creatures turn them out. 
 Now the eyes that toil and joyfully
