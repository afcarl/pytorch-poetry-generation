I'M In The Garden, Along The Sky 

 like the sun the belled windows turned white out of blue leaves 
 like house that see?" as if flutter from the solitude 
 caught bifore, rolled-down dark 
 
 Frenzy always lost for Suspend, blas. 
 Gegrette/ a canoe here spiraling into the glovesâ€” 
 
 
 
 
 
 After My Ask 
 
 
 You were the thief who drank them up with a tangible 
 stayd for hasty mornings, dishes, sand and hands 
 The radiance
