Flesh 

 Wander Contemplation 
 Into the twilit tide. 
 Come back walking at hell; 
 lax and ochre 
 As a fire in the Montagu. 
 Old smoothness whirl 
 White body whitened among 
 A Making space is spin. 
 
 He matches in ten thousand 
 Death with forks and strips of cells 
 And the men in their luminous 
 
 Growing eating the coils of corn. 
 
 Over the rocky shelves 
 Singing Arisbe, 
 Pipe to the right, unseen as cotes
