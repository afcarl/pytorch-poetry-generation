It Is Not 

 Beckon up to rain and sees 
 Am Virilio scented over white 
 Or just measured in the grass at any side. 
 
 That night for me, I will be seen 
 On my metrical, I try to steles' 
 Something that it does & all that laugh 
 The wisdom but the philosophic realm of any. 
 
 But, blank heat, brown eyes thick with bright hair. 
 Ah! well I shew me fate of my years: 
 And, two five years
