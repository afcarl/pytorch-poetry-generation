For Your Final Lady, 

 if moon be tragically numbers that even, 
 
 Burn it anywhere. 
 
 Well, perhaps the cold guns 
 must death have no music. 
 
 3. 
 Yours is but be born as a voice bewildered in pins. 
 The fish stand south to long the tree 
 slabs we're pressed against ground on it. 
 
 Lying there, high by the moon spread from a stream 
 of coffee like: staccato behind yield. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Moon
