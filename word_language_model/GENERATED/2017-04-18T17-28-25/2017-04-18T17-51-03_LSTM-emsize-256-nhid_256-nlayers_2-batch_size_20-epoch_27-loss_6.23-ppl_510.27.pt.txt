Self-Exiled 

 Bare dissolve for her flying wings 
 Into the parlor. 
 
 The fox withheld his ears, 
 Every spot is more to think his face 
 And his eyes, his nose, 
 But Death still makes the boy wind as years! 
 He taught me as when wicked men 
 Do to say, I fill his head; 
 And before by hunger 
 There's a believer all 
 The mysteries of four. What I know 
 I to us, till I watched the faces
