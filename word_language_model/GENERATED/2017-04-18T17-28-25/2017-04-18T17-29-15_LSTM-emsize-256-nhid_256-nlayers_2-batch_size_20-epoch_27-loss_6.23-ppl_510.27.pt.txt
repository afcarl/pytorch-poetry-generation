Runners See The Road, 

 And, in front of me your three sad culture crowd 
 Unto the mansion where they take gleams, 
 Eternity is not so many beautiful sisters 
 Because you mean as it sets the delicious connection 
 Of my father, sir. 
 
 Life else. Have you like fun more of you. 
 Take the place to your voice and be in its isolate dell. 
 Go to my bed and grind my turning hummingbird's Gilbert 
 soul, you see me not speak.
