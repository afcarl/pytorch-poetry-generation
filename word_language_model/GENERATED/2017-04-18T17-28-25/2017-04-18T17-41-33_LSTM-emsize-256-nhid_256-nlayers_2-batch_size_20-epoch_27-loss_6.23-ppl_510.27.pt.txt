Through The Woods, 

 In the thorns of God they sent you. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Captivity Lost: Book 2 Potter the formality brooded about John and I 
 
 
 Ah, I 
 regret with what I could not move before I die. 
 You have begun some wrong shuttles of unsightly 
 As if wild animals are white, 
 The hand of some ten foot gay-seeming in the rocks of your journey, 
 You can not know the time doesn't have your voice;
