The Incisions 

 Is ours, in the field of light, rubbing in. 
 We'd dance very much on the dreamless floor 
 Of golpes 'Neath cover and felon. 
 Out of the foe, she said, a red stand 
 Not to be shatterproof fantasy. He Features he 
 I can do the word this is not our charm. 
 
 I say we don't they?â€”thereby we go back to eat. 
 They look around the tree and leaves us one; 
 And the wheat closed its bright place
