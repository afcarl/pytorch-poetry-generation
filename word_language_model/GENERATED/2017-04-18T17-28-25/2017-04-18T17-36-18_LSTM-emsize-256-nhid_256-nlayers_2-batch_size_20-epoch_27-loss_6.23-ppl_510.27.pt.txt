Rock-Rapt, 

 But that seemingly sacrilegious, land, 
 Part of an unseen day of night. 
 
 We are going beneath her and said, 
 The night is heavy and green, 
 He will not mind the flag or the spaniel, 
 Better can't be wiser than the sun 
 But not a kind of limit. Maybe the rest 
 Of a stick gather by, and the day from the center of the water. 
 
 
 
 1. What a springy wing contains that wasn't shame
