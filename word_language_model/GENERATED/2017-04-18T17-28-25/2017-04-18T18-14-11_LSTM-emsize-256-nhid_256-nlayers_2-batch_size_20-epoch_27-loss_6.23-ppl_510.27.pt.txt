Can Fly. 

 
 A casket sink, playing I, 
 Rich with rod and someplace; 
 Pastimes, the great hurricane 
 Enough!â€” yes look out at last. 
 
 More prison-bound, don't make it 
 tiniest like spiders 
 difficulty which serve 
 Than warmer; Victoria interpretations 
 
 Was due to those who hevene, 
 I'll flourish with them all. 
 But most, I care to give them so; 
 Give me a certain song for me; 
 Almost, I boast, and waking there, 
 And recognizable,
