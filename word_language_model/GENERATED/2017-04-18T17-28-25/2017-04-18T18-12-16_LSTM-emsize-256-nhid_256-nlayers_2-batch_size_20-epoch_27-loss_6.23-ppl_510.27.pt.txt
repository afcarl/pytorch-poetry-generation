 Now I never had a army out, 
 come late and take me down to ice. 
 Law of leaves, you can vauntingly be 
 Perspectives yourself, being yes. 
 
 I have chosen rest in a kiss, 
 or an evil remark she. 
 Are you sitting there in a gutter. 
 I've seen the rabbit walk into the days 
 into the morning, a kitchen setting 
 my mother and gas bass pronounc'd it, 
 and her smile is embarrassed, 
 I'll punch my handbag
