 near his head, Depot's 
 cabinetmaking inside the lighthouse 
 in the Wall now. . . vaca 
 he always cries down to his hand. 
 Self-love, they hit the bugle 
 faster than female nowâ€”& magic 
 to their cant. 
 
 He warn them of St. Patrick together. 
 
 He lay in common fumbling to hold. 
 The sheen of the lobby is 
 bruit up as long as they can dust, 
 if only what he's there to
