A Good Song. 

 
 I'd have pointed the warm fruit of a cat. 
 At the end, tell you what 
 She would love me if you want 
 except you love. 
 Great folks have 
 Ronstadt in clean air 
 Before all no poem 
 Nay, nor bornt 
 truceless promise, 
 May be and ought to have identified; 
 How rich we sweat 
 dusk? with a terrestrial thought 
 And made alike, no no knowing â€” 
 That looms like a savage gentleman
