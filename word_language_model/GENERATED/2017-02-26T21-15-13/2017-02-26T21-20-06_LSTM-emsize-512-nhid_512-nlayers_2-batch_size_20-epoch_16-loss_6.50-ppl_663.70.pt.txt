In The Noise. 

 Dead months ago you drop off 
 suit: plunge in fire and eye 
 In a round way. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lilacs gente in plaid centre of Robert Browning 
 
 
 I feel with my breath a unsearchable, 
 In winning Exalts 
 A attempt to push, to violate circle-jerks, 
 A reggae on the Bank at her reversal 
 Facing in a genam just under porches 
 nequitias by palm pictures that moves. 
 On her head, slaughterhouses. on
