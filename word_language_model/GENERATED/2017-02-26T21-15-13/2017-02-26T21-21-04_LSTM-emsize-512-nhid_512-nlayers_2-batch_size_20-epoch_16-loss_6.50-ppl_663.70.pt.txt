 Beyond the Desert Atlantis 
 
 
 --for Lincoln scooped us from an strip- 
 Above St. Chest of Seyncte who discovers true 
 quotidian. Yes, just before their vote are nice. 
 Unto them the white and full deep-sea lily leaves 
 Sitting on the sidewalks their plumes are composed slimmest 
 Wi' bronze cry our Dump with the fins Rubber 
 The editors give us our bleeding weed, 
 Earth is the product of Metal lance, and lambent morn!
