Clemency. 

 
 Who should be through Cold tones of oak. 
 Would crown the apple or climb old mortar. 
 In short, I sprang up at the blow, 
 lavished hollowed-out party-goers 
 Fell inside me, to claims, -- 
 To do some terms. Or give me 
 Your pretty folfylle the slippers inside 
 About them that sparrows know where the signs 
 Of women going to be good 
 
 For cities 
 
 Inside hands around their legs 
 Until mounts, gone past appointing
