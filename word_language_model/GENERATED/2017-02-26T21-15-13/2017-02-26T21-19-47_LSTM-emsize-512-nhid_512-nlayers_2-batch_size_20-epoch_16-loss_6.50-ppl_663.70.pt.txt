Implications 

 The holy bear the elements are royat 
 They let loose hands and the light that never hold, 
 And a voice may be transfigured, to let me fall. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Good Woman 
 
 
 Some of must have held causality, 
 One hundred Tokyo, 
 With one sweet finger to another, 
 
 Birdie, make him a little grave. 
 Let go, as well as I roll, 
 Without the least THESE 
 To whom I wot I did,
