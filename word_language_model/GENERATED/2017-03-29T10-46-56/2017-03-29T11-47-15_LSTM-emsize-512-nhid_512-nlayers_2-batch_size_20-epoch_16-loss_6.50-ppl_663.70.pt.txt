This Of Course 

 I must inspect all with all the others 
 They all discover what they will, and survives 
 In arranging themselves because they cannot stop 
 The outer 1920s in their sex. 
 Two is not Miguel 
 The elements are too quick for the part. 
 Where'er they look in the dark and mud 
 Between their houses and the cobbles 
 Cadorzar's darkness and breathlessness 
 Far both, no white nor blind. 
 
 Once more their starlight brimmed they fall,
