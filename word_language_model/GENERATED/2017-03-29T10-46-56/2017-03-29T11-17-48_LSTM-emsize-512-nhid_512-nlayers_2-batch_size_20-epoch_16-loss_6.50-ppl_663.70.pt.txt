Not 

 pilgrimage. You feel and so 
 Will you riches, what was, 
 Can you feel 
 What work nor womenhed, 
 Take on advisers, 
 Love is an abstract joy 
 More is afraid, 
 Than to see our baby life strength. 
 registering fat lights with holly-spray 
 Your signals a dour wine, 
 A sound like a launch 
 A nest will come, 
 t a flower, neither 
 Thine nor a foolish untold; 
 Nor think that Love is, or act, or sorrow,
