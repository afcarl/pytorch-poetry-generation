Are Never, To Express It. 

 
 
 
 
 
 unearths 
 
 
 'Mid iron, from a Red rim of river 
 profusely. mobile purple walls: 
 The holes fell down on the freeway 
 risers and Shield: which goner? 
 Beyond it rolls a snare, 
 Like a note from which the bloom 
 Down cannot be created . . . 
 
 The queries carved behind them 
 Leaving the wet rooms with their sleeves 
 Where the bones called sky-captains 
 They begin
