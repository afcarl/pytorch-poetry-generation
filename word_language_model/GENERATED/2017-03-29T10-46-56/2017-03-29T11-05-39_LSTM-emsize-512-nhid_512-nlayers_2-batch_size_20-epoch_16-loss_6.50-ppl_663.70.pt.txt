 His wide bowl children vegemite 
 Your tongues were one, the woman burns 
 Her leg, as if she were a child, 
 Stand splints and berried every place. 
 
 She drank the paper breathing her light 
 Till she jerks his body and left him far 
 Down came until it was seen-- 
 
 No water now, or staring 
 On the sudden, at the edge 
 Of the humming maple in the East 
 Of his great visitor is His sermon dead,
