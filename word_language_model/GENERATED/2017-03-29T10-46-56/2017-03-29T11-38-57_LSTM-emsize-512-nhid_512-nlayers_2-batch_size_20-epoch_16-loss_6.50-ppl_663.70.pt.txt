Wed Guilty Strange Dreams Of Thee; 

 New missiles ix.81 and limpsy circulations-- 
 Transparencies and Flood, ye daily make you to me, paper-thin, 
 My grace of shams of pleasure and name and dread, 
 There in you will begin and swear 
 You will not feel a minute which is hell between us, 
 The eyes that have raised you ere their first faces. 
 
 O "It is thy approach and my jewel counts nothing, 
 None ever too sick nor carried one to me;
