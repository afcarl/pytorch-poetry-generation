 It was it, my father died that an shade 
 Was unlike a vision the model 
 Of Company and village-- 
 
 VII 
 From the window, 
 tolerated-- 
 On its western paling land. 
 Sometimes a snake lies played for me-- 
 No slave but to a fashionable recoil 
 Could crack, or ever found a grin 
 Within the shadowing boom of a bullet--that's . . . 
 
 The final slave that maketh Time might say; 
 Thinking the waspe; much so
