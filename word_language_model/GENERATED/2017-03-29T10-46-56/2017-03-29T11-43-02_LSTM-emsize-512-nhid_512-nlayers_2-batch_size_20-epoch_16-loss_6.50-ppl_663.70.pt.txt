Parallels In The Morning West, 

 driving through the street and runs upside down 
 up in a haze of smoke, drawing finding his bread 
 to the elevator, a fountain's rifle plaited sails 
 ruth. Compels by clean, by timber 
 water, tips and oil the cards of activist, 
 removed hair. Against a ridiculous lamp, 
 Roosting as a bush passes long and gone 
 as high dogs passes in loose cups. 
 There might be sipping solid water for a flail, 
 its Dad dances
