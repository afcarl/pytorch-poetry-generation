Rolling, On The Bank 

 "The feeling Tuesday summer, 
 The parents on their foreheads swoop 
 Are lived: women, crowd and loosely howling, 
 Lu kens fat, tomb-weeper lean back, 
 hitches, diapers, owe. Ape gefremman darkness. 
 fal back, make lying slack by day. unraveled 
 If you grab it, and all the tender, catechism 
 Holding like a Mark's myth 
 To make a name some have a greedy, 
 Or old sheep-dip, 
 If you pleased this, 
 Such a vervain. at battle,
