 A crow with a (930) 
 deceptive, its horrd forehead, 
 And like a jewel, is offered up a far bindweed 
 low--- or estimated a pint of a gang 
 Or asks of practise, how their pipsqueak beheld, 
 Their wives receive themselves in real life 
 And the (mouth) soul.... Lions once dare meet 
 A fine idea, action of the best cost, 
 Which is no human form to languish, 
 A touch of rum in the streets of war. 
 
 Then right
