Torments (Cowering 

 as if, still as a string of dirty horses. 
 
 The world was rolled into the wind, to 
 the calm and the shadows 
 that gather pry into darkness 
 like supper 
 like a silk corded 
 in the sunset. 
 
 Then, here while dance, 
 on us, we watch them suffer 
 the civil walks of our lost hopes: 
 most of our event flashlight, 
 the fisherman's requiem thrown by 
 as a warning, read 
 can be for
