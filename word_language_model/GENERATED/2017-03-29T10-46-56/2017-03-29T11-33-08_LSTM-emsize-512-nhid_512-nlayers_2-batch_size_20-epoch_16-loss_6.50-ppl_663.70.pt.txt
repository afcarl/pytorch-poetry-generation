The Hardiment, The Romans Due: 

 She sold our destruction. We taught as long as new; 
 And always had the huge curled breast up right 
 When there was nothing 
 gemundon of the moon. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Healing 
 
 
 The rest of truth just wide 
 From night to room, 
 What sees plain, 
 Something that you had seen 
 Wind trawling against a time 
 To be silent 
 As dreadful person, semifree 
 To walk still in
