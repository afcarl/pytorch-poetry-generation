 I 
 
 The man is good 
 Who has her singing, 
 
 scruff. and found 
 A decent beast by which a bird 
 Ohio; their islands rise to colors; 
 Tin flute, Lippe, 
 their hatred, their loife 
 they should never be able 
 to jump. 
 Did the Devil 
 sneak softly over their place, 
 his attire: picked and grip her smile 
 and the cobwebs in the hotel
