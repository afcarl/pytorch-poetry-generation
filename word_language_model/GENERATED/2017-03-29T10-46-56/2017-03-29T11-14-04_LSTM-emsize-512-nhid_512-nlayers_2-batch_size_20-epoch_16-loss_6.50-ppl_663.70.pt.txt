Lives 

 When the mineral wan 
 Striped with the dying womb is she. 
 
 The stars of my eyes generally him draw 
 My dark eyes with the world's tangled dew. 
 I envy not all Satan; but assume 
 What my brief thoughts are haunted as content 
 As a wild and quiet king in an Abbethdin 
 And me a goose born in March a devil's swift, 
 Under soft pennants of whispers rude, 
 S-tracks along by Sea, the shrilling shore?
