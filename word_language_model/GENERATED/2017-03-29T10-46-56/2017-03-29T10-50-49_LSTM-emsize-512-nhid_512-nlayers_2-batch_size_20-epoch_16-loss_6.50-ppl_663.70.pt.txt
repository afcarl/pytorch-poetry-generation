 Smile all the winds 
 That pulls their course off. 
 For the other; with their city's boots 
 And their small hands poisoner's 
 They left square? Had his tune, set down, 
 Wherever they could be, a third. 
 Sweet Nothing. 
 
 Yet Thunder fell on the creek 
 Amid 
 His arching boat does moralize at air 
 And gaze at old. What a dark smile 
 
 Is a good life, by the air now, 
 Comes awake from a deep confidantes.
