Will Fly. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Winter News 
 
 
 After the steady light and the rain 
 Remembered in its shadow. 
 
 Who lives forever in the sea, 
 Where stands the wind of Asia, 
 There's nothing left to hate Bastard. 
 Each gone the main, & out of death, the streets, 
 For there in every winter's space hollyhawks 
 And gather all that bold be bored 
 In waves and meadow and dark death; 
 And in every sound
