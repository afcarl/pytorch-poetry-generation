Flute? 

 Sweet is the strength of thy desires and hay. 
 And thou art given, with the care of thy repose, 
 And lanes are at mute: 
 Will I get home, the sky fails, 
 O let drop rise more far and away, 
 Their mouths only the way it could seem weak 
 Till they came out of the very curtain: 
 
 I would fain be virile, there was that sin 
 And the thought of a very rain 
 Some mother hence,
