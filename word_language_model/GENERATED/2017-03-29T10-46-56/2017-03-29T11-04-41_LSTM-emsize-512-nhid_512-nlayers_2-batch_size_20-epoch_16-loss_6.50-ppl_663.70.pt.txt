On Our Backs. Now, 

 Broke over and over the car floor 
 tetanus. 
 The sound of bells folded around our pillow. 
 In the swan's tops that grew too stead 
 For neglect faintly after nothing; 
 
 And in the us they looked on factory-fittings 
 halts, & cringe, cracked their confrontational 
 Forgetting that was what they were 
 By Meeting others, and they had desired 
 Just as the guns black currents turned dirty 
 Albracca, as brothers does thin their own
