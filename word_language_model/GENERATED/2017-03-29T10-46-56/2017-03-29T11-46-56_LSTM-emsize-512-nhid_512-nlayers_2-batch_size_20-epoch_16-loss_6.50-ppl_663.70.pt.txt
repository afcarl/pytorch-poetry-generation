These Eyes, 

 that eats dark in the rank like light? 
 
 I am the enemy and follows the sunrise 
 under the bent stove, 
 and around my head, a card, 
 they learn in dreams that are best making 
 of the children that are more rapid than moonscaped and khair 
 so I am ten years ago in curry. 
 examine; old age cowbells have massacred 
 a sensible amount to beseeching me from a great design 
 without shelter me over on Noisy.
