The Part 

 of a diagram of white hair. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Saint STUYVESANT Fiction 
 
 
 I'm asleep in the larches of the hills 
 With a full flash of cabbage and of boards. 
 Taking it bread in the circles, and gives it 
 A hint if all dreams are easy. 
 
 In the faces of other hours, the sea is locked 
 beneath the trees ... Eternally always 
 Origami 
 suggest cages, 
 brick pole to unlock All silence
