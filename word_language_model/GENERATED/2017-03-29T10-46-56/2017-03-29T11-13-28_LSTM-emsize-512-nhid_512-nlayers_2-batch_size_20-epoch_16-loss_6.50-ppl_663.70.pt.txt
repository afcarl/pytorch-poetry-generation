Well-Wishers Are You? 

 
 Even for the first time of machine 
 Soon, or leopard? 
 that gin it activity. 
 The chase the treacherous lives 
 Stood in thy place that made us, 
 Is proper to play 
 Or only, Clear, road-of-sails 
 Weak as desolate as death. 
 Let not thy thirst again. 
 Thus is the reveries of England, -- the Phoenix dar'd to roast us, 
 Can grieve at Holborne Rap. 
 Let there be immortal emotion at its disease.
