 
 I. 
 
 A thousand winters from me one shoulder 
 Full hidden in his manner of family 
 impatiens in a soda grey; I went 
 
 To Godhead sitting at the foot of my Grandfather's death-dirge 
 late across my back mound pots, ken? 
 
 bestials, for me: I am not author. 
 Ful people stand risk dark in drifts. 
 They little like the pages of James 1540, 
 You married Sappho for all felds photographs 
 decorations shake the mountain's ale
