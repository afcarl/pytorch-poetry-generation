To Hack Me Off, 

 Fallen with palm flowers above. 
 Since nature exists when I haven't leapt 
 My heart to cure Love's parent cause, 
 There is all earth gone in the Garden, 
 Naked where the burning hours below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Copper Redbreast the Painted Shades 
 
 
 I came from rock to hills after morn, 
 and stone-carved Everything strange, one gray stalks 
 where in the dim light of my first year it had lain
