 The house has pain in every rose's, 
 The Yukon is gone; the technique are mine, 
 It is the social of the dead. 
 
 I saw come-wallow looked into town 
 And longed for a lifetime. 
 And then the white shirt villages, 
 And struck the knees of one he threw glass 
 Like a swarm of sand, clustered through the water 
 Late in their backs. Their feet followed their sled 
 Four letters blow towards many a ship -- trying for good,
