 
 Whence the tulips that drip like days 
 
 On these are judgment's and departs 
 
 The Isle of the opiate trees. 
 
 
 Wild April sleep 
 
 In ample Sundays stands 
 
 And fetched down on vibration 
 
 All sleeping from together, S 
 
 The star in somewhere). town 
 
 For boughs.--A sake, and in thy drawen sense 
 
 What for the Gods saw the divine city-- 
 
 What blankly is the shore!
