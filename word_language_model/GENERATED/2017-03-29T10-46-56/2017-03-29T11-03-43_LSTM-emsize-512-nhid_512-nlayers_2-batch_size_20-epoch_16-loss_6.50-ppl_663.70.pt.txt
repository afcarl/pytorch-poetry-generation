Free, The One 

 & very beautiful 
 harp 
 in the west. I am a dog. 
 
 
 a pair of acres covered by the sand and spotting 
 a judgement outside that it will burn. 
 Morning neck is a rind, select. 
 crater trees up up to the ," Dijon 
 
 rush the trellised melted screams. 
 We catch the still-defended fuse 
 on the toilet Fourth cyclists move 
 (#2) flats turn to nails off. 
 Shupstead below morning, simmer 
 next
