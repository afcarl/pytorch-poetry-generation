 And at this that. The sunrise entering her thigh 
 as the tree goes out into the rain. 
 Her yellow eye will turn from our roots, 
 as our master plays minstrelsy, him. 
 Boyd, harp, wrenched blankets and ends and hips, 
 thick, twill, on the jab belly, 
 hanging hills. After many miles 
 they semi and seigh their ears like mist 
 hitting a glossy conscious ladder of large haze, 
 where shadows break the wiry tires, 
 
 sprawled
