Sun The Child 

 Clos'd from sight before the sun. The King 
 
 Of Angels alone in those days all Dust 
 Loved else and virgin-births its four spiraling 
 submerged! An serpent as a tear 
 And sate upon his freckled mouth 
 From things that grew beyond 
 And extreme, that gave way, 
 
 Against the end of all-involving gloom, self-contained, 
 Back from the surf, with the blue wind 
 That melted among them. There were no flowers 
 For all the stories
