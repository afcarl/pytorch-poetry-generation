 
 If vigil in my death became past. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The cheese-cloth 
 
 
 The gigantic palms on guns 
 Remembered as if hell had been 
 A city under creatures 
 Winds of beautiful deaths pass, 
 With large ascending nut-brown 
 Wife and a sting, amber bowerbird 
 Holds them the fury of their gasoline edge. 
 Where is the dead pages, red white flowers 
 Pointed the golden fruit of their small wishbone, 
 Crowned heads up in
