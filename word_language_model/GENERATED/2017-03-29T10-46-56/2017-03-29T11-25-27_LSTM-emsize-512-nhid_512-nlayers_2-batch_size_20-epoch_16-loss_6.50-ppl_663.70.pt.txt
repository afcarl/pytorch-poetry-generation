Me 

 the long moment to draw this price. 
 
 We killed this dog that fode, then never 
 helps to be orchid, 
 but always grown at attenuated 
 up-well-- While I 
 recognized myself to my head; 
 I have escaped bone 
 in dirt, mud roots upward in grace 
 at crying, camp to break. 
 Beyond the backyard burial hour, 
 at my task I've said 
 
 I can't. 
 I have no Shiloah's 
 and no one is ever 
 here
