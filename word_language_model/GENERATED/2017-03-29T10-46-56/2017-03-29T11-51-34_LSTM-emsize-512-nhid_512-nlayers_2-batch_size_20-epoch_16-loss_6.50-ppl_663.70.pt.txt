Large, 

 Shut midtime into elegies and see, 
 
 12 
 It might be pianos come tired, and kiss with these. 
 
 From shame!) to secean she doth Doubt 
 That she eats Hades and all the teas 
 Were fickle, until she bleak, with smallest pains, 
 Autodaf. with her own soul! gnomic deeds 
 For food they gave, "Unclewed alas! were she, 
 Welcome from Dismal urn the goddess Momus' die." 
 
 What was that world should wake the knight to Death.
