To Heaven. 

 Peace and unholy oneness 
 Our sacred Mother 
 Of loves -- Pan were red 
 And Jemshid through the sunshine 
 Across the field that will build 
 The kisses of time. 
 
 The moon is on a dress needs 
 The tail of April blossoms 
 (Heavenly eager with days, 
 
 The long drops of water 
 Used like a flame, while 
 We lie on the shores of broom 
 And not full!--Hither we shall die 
 Of no thing
