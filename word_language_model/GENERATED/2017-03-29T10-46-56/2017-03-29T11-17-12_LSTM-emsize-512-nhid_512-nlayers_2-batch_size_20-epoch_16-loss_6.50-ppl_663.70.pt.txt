Summer Began, 

 And, when the languid tide at dawn 
 Has been and shine at eight and long. 
 
 The reek of water seemed to come and sing; 
 Nor seemed that simple walk, 
 They were the rising winds in the blue twilight. 
 
 They sought the dame, and soon did vex 
 Their simple fear with their most horn. 
 
 She manages to beat the accidents, 
 Looks upon her while they allow, 
 And little in her station sank 
 Over
