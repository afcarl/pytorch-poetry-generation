Three Men From North, 

 two women and caged sticks 
 from a wall Ants made a spring foot 
 
 the dusk came and rolled and filled 
 the dark. When we came home 
 they seemed our gauzy ocean, 
 Fool," gravel washed by dust. 
 
 With three turning gold we watched with 
 cancer of the quarrel in nipped 
 on any reasonable wick 
 but them to be changing 
 but a hard sliver cellulose, who 
 gave stronger shriek! and gave birth
