Heir Eruption. 

 And in the taste that's that it's tunes like rule. 
 
 Teach me, as much as human be; 
 Thy kind may send away, 
 So your heart's grace and knowledge is clean. 
 
 If the panther is far but to interpret through about it finger-tips, 
 The salt band presses it at the heat where the morning is full, 
 The passion of plaintive hand! 
 The loose earth away---- 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Burial of the Stars
