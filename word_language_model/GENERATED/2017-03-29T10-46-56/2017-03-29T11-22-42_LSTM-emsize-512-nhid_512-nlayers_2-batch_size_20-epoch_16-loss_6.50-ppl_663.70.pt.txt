On The Flank Of The Hill, 

 bedsheets heaped up and down 
 Under the cool dark slope. 
 
 In bulk of azure crest 
 prune, and Lower Time 
 Is drowned amid the rain, 
 The level gloom is ringed with white. 
 And if the children were no going. 
 I disappeared and found a glance, 
 Of cities from that vineyards over stars. 
 And so they want me to have said 
 With their lookin' spots and between. 
 
 The Earth grows
