At The Funeral Street 

 lecture-rooms, another day by day 
 As stars in leaves, the ink of night like roses, 
 And many feather'd women that loved 
 After the stars, or chill between the woods, 
 And the bright strides wild and sharply falls; 
 For there she was a snake and stoned deeper men. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Farewell 
 
 
 In this our happy vague our place clouds turn 
 To that sweet spot that fix us through the forest dark,
