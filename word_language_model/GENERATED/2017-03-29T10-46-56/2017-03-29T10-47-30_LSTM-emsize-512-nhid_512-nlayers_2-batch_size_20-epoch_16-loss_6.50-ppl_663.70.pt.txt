Door-Whine Out Of Land And Slow 

 As trees, ever dull birthdays must do; 
 Even now, her love, now grudge me to her love: 
 Then seek she death such care and mine; 
 That mine Imbower'd soul with beauty blest, 
 and what a stronger mates may grow; 
 That I can only Heart, for she shall die. 
 
 
 
 
 
 On Christmas Dying as the Wars are white 
 
 
 
 What care of Nature, as is heard 
 In summer
