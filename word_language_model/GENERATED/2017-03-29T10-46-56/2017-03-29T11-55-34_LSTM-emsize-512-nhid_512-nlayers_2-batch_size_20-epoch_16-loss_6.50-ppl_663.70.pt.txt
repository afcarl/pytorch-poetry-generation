Their Heads Left Deep To Heaven. 

 
 I thought of ninety men and children waiting 
 While I heard their hidden gust 
 And ungainliness, like a wide stone moon or doves 
 Cast down the western breast that I lived as I row'd 
 Into progenie blue streets the sea sleeps at last, 
 The season shore the day that I might go. 
 I had no neighborhood. My friends and fathers use their likeness going: 
 Lift me with your eyes. 
 
 Not gatherer
