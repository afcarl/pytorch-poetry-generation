 But in any temple is what we know 
 In syncopated, seven, pecks of those who find

 But that old beauty without much and none can do? 
 Be tired of this -- whatever is a insight- 
 These is the psychiatrists life is moved. 
 Words gave them to harvest. 
 Unless they are done to do our lamplit work. 
 But lift
