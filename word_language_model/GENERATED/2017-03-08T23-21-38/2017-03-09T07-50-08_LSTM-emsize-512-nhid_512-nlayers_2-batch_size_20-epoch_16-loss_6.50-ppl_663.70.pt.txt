To Achitophel 

 Was to be attached again 
 in low 
 life in a stream, with no strength 
 as time or defects 
 and bay, 
 a leafless line of raw goldenrod 
 that clenched up the invisible 
 
 Spring Yarrow, and gone obsolete 
 lovelies roar, the trembling field 
 
 Only the little homestead 
 in shaded, gardens 
 may walk into 
 rooms as long as white Cocytus 
 
 down from the window. 
 
 And if the wooden goats
