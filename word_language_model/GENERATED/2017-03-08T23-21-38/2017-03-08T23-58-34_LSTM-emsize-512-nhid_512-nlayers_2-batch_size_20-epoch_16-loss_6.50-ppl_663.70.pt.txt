Fragging. 

 I have no stranger-- no quiet what-brings-you. 
 And my chances will thus rest, 
 And strive to nose their string. 
 
 Compassed mother, eliminated pull-out 
 Violet. 
 Squoire & deed: 
 What you endure. 
 Love is not that a shadow 
 Is to find on the tomb 
 Which eats the flower away: 
 And take not what you see more 
 Than such profound t'our 
 
 For you, although not even a Fiend, 
 But the gentleman and the worst.
