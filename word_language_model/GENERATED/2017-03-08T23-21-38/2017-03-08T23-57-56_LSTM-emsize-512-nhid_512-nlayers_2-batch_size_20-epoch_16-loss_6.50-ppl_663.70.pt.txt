 
 And prosper all 
 Of all the doubt of love to-day, 
 Was BE now mine humble maid, 
 Serves than hope, but run away 
 " Of the kind and vain thing, this mind. 
 
 II 
 Your senses know no hour, 
 Nor quite my sole rhyme, 
 Nor illume your mind; 
 Nor yet that love, but all doth burn; 
 And fails to be switching in 
 The speckle ere the dove 
 Must move the choir, and right again.
