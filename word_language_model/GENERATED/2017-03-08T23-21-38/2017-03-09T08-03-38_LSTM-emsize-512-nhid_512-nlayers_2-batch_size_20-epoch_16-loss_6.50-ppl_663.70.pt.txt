 
 I was dressed for my strong love, 
 A little boy to tell her him, 
 She let me trim my Emperor's beard, 
 And my cold Oysters came. 
 
 Ah! if the element were o'er; 
 And my waiters to buy one, 
 Had I ever beheld a maid. 
 But if a thousand minutes on me see 
 In my own soul, or self in hell 
 Who so most have bound me Hazarded 
 'T were a sort of beauty in hay.
