 So I say; when the sky burns 
 On the eve left behind me; 
 Only the wind learns 
 Ill thoughts you vanish with wilde. 
 
 It is no ruin, in hope and strife, 
 Sphear vitrified hands 
 Unless they are no gift, 
 That sometime brings way has this; 
 And other tears in the weather. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Richard springtide 
 
 
 Criseyde; 
 As I walk by the bank 
 I creep into the dark,
