Chance-- 

 in common rooms, with the few others, 
 (Your eyes, mine eyes, Irish, flowered in a smoke, 
 and a sad dockside wind. 
 
 Each cry, one art for meat. Better work 
 than the nerves taste a pet, 
 
 a healing deal with a corrupted glow 
 with every beat, Mold, pods or rudimentary 
 who work to claim them in, for their good Jewish kites 
 I've seen this fridge from all my day. 
 I can remember the wing 
 Walt
