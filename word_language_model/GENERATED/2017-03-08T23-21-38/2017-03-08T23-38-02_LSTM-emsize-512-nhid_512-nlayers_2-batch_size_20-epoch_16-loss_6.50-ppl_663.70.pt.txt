Fall 

 To kiss or carry a cloud of quick 
 And passing all shipping again; 
 I tread for their sad curtains, making me free, 
 Some constant bones with hopeless stay; 
 And I'll find it all smiles, after all, are not love. 
 Yea, men going to me, month! toil and despair, 
 Do I not hope thee less or revealed thee, 
 Is it possible? No, there is the name in me? 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Little Church Scene glistens in
