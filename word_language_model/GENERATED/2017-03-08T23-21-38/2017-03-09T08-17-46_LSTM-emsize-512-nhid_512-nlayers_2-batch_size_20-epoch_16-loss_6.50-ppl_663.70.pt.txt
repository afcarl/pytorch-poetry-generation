It 

 
 The occupied in it 
 She bores her breasts with tiny wheat, 
 Trying to stay the very mess of newspapers, 
 Or cut her in the middle of her second bed. 
 As she thinks, the bodies--father 
 As she puts off her human arms till her pinched coat. 
 In this yellow white and scarlet belly 
 Went home to life. 
 
 The dream of flowers is a kind of white, and bugs, 
 The groans of love and breasts and ocean.
