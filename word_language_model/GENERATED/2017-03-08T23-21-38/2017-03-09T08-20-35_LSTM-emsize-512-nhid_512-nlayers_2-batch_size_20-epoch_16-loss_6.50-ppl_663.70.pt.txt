Standard Moment 

 exactly as the sun's calm shades 
 grew as the meal of pain: 
 Congo colors, its double rubble 
 fill with the cliff and its tombstone 
 threw, O memory, O life! say it was Leone 
 Pesky Children have to follow. He wore a seores, 
 he flees of heat and hair in the cracked roadside 
 
 But the next thing it will be the size of labor with all 
 and what can it is now, wants to take it up
