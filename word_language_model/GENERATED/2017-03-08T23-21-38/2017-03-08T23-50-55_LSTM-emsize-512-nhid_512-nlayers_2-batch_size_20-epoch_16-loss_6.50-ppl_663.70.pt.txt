 With the sun like death, leaving no light 
 At my portal, the sail, the future Roman 
 
 Come corr'd in that body song 
 Whose singing is more than a pale blush 
 or any word but bar. 
 My hustle: I suddenly know 
 much as much as you seem and no 2, 
 
 Even in the afternoon, the house is settled 
 like a fine futures. Like the steady 
 flower of Needful 
 Aches--overbright! 
 
 decried, discuss. photographs and sulfa
