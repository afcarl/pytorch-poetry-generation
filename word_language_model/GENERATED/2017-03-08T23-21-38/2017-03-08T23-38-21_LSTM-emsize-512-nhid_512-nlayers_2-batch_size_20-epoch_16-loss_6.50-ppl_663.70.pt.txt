"Let'S Go So Much 

 And give crazy beauty nearer hand. 
 And in the heart can one another part, 
 Of orange and a never hint you pursue 
 If I catch you until you find me all; 
 And with a somewhat Find you in me, 
 And there grows several ca rubies streams 
 Across whose tumbled black lines Life's grace may wait, 
 Till the black sun and foam that flow like arm. 
 I hear my fret and the quiet soul that grew.
