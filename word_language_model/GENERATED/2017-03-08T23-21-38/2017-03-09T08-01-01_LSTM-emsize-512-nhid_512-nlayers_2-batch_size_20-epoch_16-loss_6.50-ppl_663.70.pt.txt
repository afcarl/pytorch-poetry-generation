5. Oh, Riches, The Old Stoutest Heart 

 Ideogram the rabbit Bridge of your pan. 
 That freedom is spray-laden lewd: I've stated 
 Him who is t McKinney, old yule, with 
 Giving a slumbrous temple, all over the floor. 
 He's not still, waiting for you was lame, 
 in conversation she's young? 
 Not calm, gone no more 
 who's kin to be might without conduct 
 Some after one beyond the whole Atlantic 
 For that is never the thought of never-still 
 Such
