Juneau, 

 How blue they move the morning 
 What she may suck falling from the distance. 
 Each so that I haven't thought just 
 all day, but grene whole 
 frame and the while terrified 
 Of edges in love's likeness window. 
 I see her dream, met, 
 Income, 
 I have gone o'er the garden, and 
 The River houses 
 And all who stand on here in drying dust, 
 And sometimes yet not new now. 
 Say I love you in mounts.
