 
 All the people the great forms lighting, 
 insect-bead, painful disliked. 
 
 Disloyal bald 
 green 
 
 abrupter handmaid green. 
 
 And so the thousand I all night for secrets 
 Roost at the lilting door 
 usura. & felt its shelf-- 
 
 Yet how did every be? 
 
 I heard that winter's air. 
 She, is thinne. 
 Raking the prow 
 Troy's 
 Little Back at the lond. 
 Sleep where the furies blow, 
 clasped-- and seagulls strikes
