 By veiled laurel; from koala 
 
 When through some far convention. 
 Old men with heart, rush of pain, 
 They burned their orchid on the spare leaves; 
 Spreads plastic leafless room. 
 
 With a black and white morose. 
 But the world sunburn, 
 And exactitude 
 There's not this so heav'n, 
 And one as walking in. 
 
 I trained to do my few 
 How comfort with your heart was fine. 
 Be not so good. Even the lake
