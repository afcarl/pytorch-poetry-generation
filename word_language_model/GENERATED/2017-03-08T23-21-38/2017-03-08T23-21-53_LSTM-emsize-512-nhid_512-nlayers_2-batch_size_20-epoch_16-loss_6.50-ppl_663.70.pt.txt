Of A Black White Band 

 Turned up in a small pursuit; 
 Now 
 Sack shave; turning, lights 
 Lying in water, a color of veins 
 
 Year] like trains 
 
 The shock 
 Of many kinds nourished" 
 To impassive eyes 
 You have forgotten 
 Light around which the sky 
 
 champions by us 
 By port of mourning 
 Far hence, unmoving in our sight, 
 A thought, then, ah! another done, 
 Takes up in dust and fear.
