Still Mary 

 
 swylce dry to be looked 
 
 from the west rapidly 
 of suffering or the rapture 
 before the stories in the landscape 
 
 moccasins and lace, where 
 the cows were like a planet underground 
 rising from an doorway 
 
 a term. seamusic, feet, 
 
 it drifts broken 
 into its porches, 
 each half-hour and a city, a master 
 breathing the ring of smoke 
 
 they sway this afternoon 
 
 and pushed their sleeves
