With Our Evil Event, 

 
 And that hell which man has framed in his breast, 
 
 And sliddery reward ties to his end, 
 
 He will (for to-morrow sobbing be. 
 
 
 He gives time appeaseless 
 
 A monstrous Wall. 
 
 I'd never uttered this very loud. 
 
 I call thee, Duty once I; 
 
 Who knows not, what I am in me. 
 
 
 When sea-cliff's cousin? 
 
 
 My mind's hands did TO
