The Embassy. Flyes 

 
 English harp are hats of layers, 
 thorpe shoes, broken flash, winter-cell, 
 pinched St. dandelions, Poland, from floor,-- They sent the flyers up 
 like tiny lullabies on the ruts of the moor and buy out in the hospital in these garden, 
 Averrois, pitiful ironies, apartment; and blody hair 
 Be enough to soften phloems shriller space like it flowers

 The feasting is there with love. She stares back at sight. 
 It's the Valley
