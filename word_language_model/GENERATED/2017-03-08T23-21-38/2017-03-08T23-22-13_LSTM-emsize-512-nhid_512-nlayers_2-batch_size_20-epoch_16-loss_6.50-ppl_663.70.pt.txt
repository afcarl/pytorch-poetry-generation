Slickened: The Priest Wire And The Wind-Swung Aaaaaaaaargh. 

 Spreading & used: salvage laced with dew. 
 At first chance, such foul muck fell, 
 as seen rounds-- now dare measures; 
 and give for careful one its joy to see. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Infant animals 
 
 
 "The avenue that wakes me is a torrent by the sea, 
 All longs to Soule, and by one side woe 
 Late man in the empty office, afternoon 
 With forgot; depth and tremulous sleeves
