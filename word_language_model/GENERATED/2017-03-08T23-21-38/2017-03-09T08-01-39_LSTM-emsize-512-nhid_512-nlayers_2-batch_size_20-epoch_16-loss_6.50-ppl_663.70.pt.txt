The Afternoon Does It, 

 And I can kiss again when the years will be 
 There in the still sunlight where snow among, 
 estimate, the bitter faiths 
 offices caught in both hands and blue warriors pink--I 
 Strange guards flying to the blind and dead men brick 
 From the stream's Depression, the manor, the long time, 
 Closing potatoes on grunt and hooves and Kids. 
 
 I like to think of that was a sea: the very dark and ten 
 June near!
