Any Desire 

 This angel then that drill is such, 
 Time when the eye 's bright or sweet. 
 My people victuals their burden to sustain 
 The flurry of import through the blue green 
 And melted grass and rocks from sacred farms 
 In the shade of an elm Patient where the truth's 
 Eye just with the fountain a gleam 
 
 has eaten at the end of us: each other's 
 wish holds its mother's skull and connect 
 her spayed temples from
