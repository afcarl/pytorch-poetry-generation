So Tightly Long Away 

 
 Down in time's kinds of undying pool 
 hanging in light, then smells of leaves, 
 the shifting sheep of ice 
 that will stand somewhere in the dark 
 like landscape, where, before it living still 
 
 and joy in its own way by the west 
 in summer, bright beyond the nod of the earth. 
 
 The sky no'untruth into Melody 
 caves intense, fall, moveless 
 white as buffalo lexicon 
 leia 
 selfrespect our cars
