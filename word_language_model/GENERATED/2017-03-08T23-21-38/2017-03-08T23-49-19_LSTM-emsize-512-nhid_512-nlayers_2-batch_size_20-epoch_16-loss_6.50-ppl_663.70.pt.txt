Up The Millennium 

 
 1. 
 
 What did the city be? Do I not know why birds call you 
 in joins half-breed, wands to doe, 
 knot-tying all would you break your flock and cottage cover, 
 or fight? bashful to my ass, 
 I cried Suzy's "GUILTY!" 
 your throat heaved 
 your leaded nipples of woods over copycat 
 Lose death to risk up to your dust 
 Nuova, your mark of the Adversarie 
 to convince second will sing the game
