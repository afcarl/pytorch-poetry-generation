The Town, 

 I could not see her larger mate 
 Than to m'est crossing over begets.' 
 Blue cradles each ray the moon 
 Of trees, pulling you down, up me, 
 Teach me to work too, the tongue slowly sneakin' 
 Praise your death, I have a word about it, 
 arrogance, you pay your own brown shadow 
 caved-in up your wing away 
 
 Dark silent foreign mountains 
 Hand over your shoulders, page survived 
 Long nights, the battle of consciousness, 
 Phenomenon
