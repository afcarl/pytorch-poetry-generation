 
 I turned my way back 
 
 Into a column of heat. 
 
 aequales 
 crystal white, red and roam 
 Practice 
 
 lids. 
 
 What you change in this ozone 
 
 To the rising and the wakening edge 
 
 Of something talks to fall: 
 
 What is the grasp of this hour when they look 
 
 Until the last of them has always been 
 
 Too soon, I must have died before man takes it,
