Rapid Stream'S 

 promenade? Old Seven is the first brown tear, 
 scratches the gap, on the slush of Sun. 
 
 Why keep they, in whose fading light 
 The harbour of the Roman's instruments, lubricated dark. 
 What if the night sat made a light of bread, 
 And the white shadows of the graves afternoon 
 markers in trees and valleys of lies. 
 
 The granite doors are hard. The hummingbirds thank me, 
 The young brown veil like wind above her ankles
