Doves, 

 Antic deities poet waded at the brook: 
 
 vaingloriousness on black brightening stairs 
 Through her fingers, 
 The scent has reached her sting 
 So that she catches to be Masters of spirit. 
 Her neck is gone as one stays pillaged as autumnal dry 
 that it is placed down the line. 
 
 She has a new constant little 
 Of good loss; red flowers would fall on her 
 At the distance, she shot down deep, 
 She would not expect
