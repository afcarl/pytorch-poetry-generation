 The city? Hence was Beggar's Over its black turf, 
 The sea and the North Tower afforded 
 What it is worth what it becomes --friend 
 That admits what they stand, and how they're on 
 Of those who strut and fall as good as these, 
 With the cold stems are gone, the circling stars. 
 
 XIV 
 Like the ghost of a drape of rich breakers 
 Kept growing pomp in the gurgle of consequence, 
 The tobacco whispers at the uneven basin
