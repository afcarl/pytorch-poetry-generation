We Missed Cincinnati, 

 Not Death, not pace, but thou hast not 
 Much importune for the fantasize yet, that thou 
 Save man of labour and danger end? 
 Such sound in country long as is, 
 Have not run sighs from substance in their lives. 
 But little lives seem kind. 
 
 Yet is he that makes his poems all men made, 
 We mark at the army this predictably 
 Because he philosophies within their name. 
 Their lusts are also shameful good.
