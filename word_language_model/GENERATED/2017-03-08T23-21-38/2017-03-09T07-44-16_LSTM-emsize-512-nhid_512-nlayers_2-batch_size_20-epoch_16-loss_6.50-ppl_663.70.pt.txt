 knowing I should again have leaped 
 
 A small, huge wind drives 
 The wind comes green that learns to the end, 
 Soon, king working moment, 
 To walk with eyes 
 
 For one day 
 I see on long Theatre 
 By the pigeons in my brain. 
 But they have gone sirens? 
 Within the crack of their red sylvan books 
 The armies lies laughing in my sleep. 
 I am heaven--I 
 I am always 
 mature to cry.
