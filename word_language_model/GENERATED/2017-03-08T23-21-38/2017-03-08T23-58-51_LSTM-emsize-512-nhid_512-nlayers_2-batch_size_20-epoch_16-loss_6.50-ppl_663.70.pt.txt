Sweeter Eyes And Singing Teeth) In Each Bedes, Window Arrogance. 

 How to spy a lost glimpse of an old woman, 
 Found no one in her friend. 
 
 May I know I should strike from simple bread. 
 I touched her with well-fed, dying body 
 pounding into my head and arms. 
 
 Her skirt spirit went gently. 
 
 They stems against the window, 
 snoozers the excitement 
 Of the women who have Earthworms 
 Still cell on the small loaves of snow
