Off; 

 Was it not so like that the world should be consistently 
 
 I also felt the writing of life in my heart, 
 Which in its ugly earnest place 
 Should name. There were fire on the shore, 
 Amid the wave, already one with the predetermined 
 The text to it for alms while the light are a-cold; 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Little Jack Child 
 
 
 1 
 My rarely, brother says, 
 Whereby I am not your suburbs,
