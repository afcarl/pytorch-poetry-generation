To The Heart. 

 Our yolk is 
 a false question 
 but we are the size 
 of the own 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 My silks them, call the history 
 of man's faith & I howling out of my sweet 
 World's daughters, walking together 
 above the crowd and striking 
 the sun. The keel the riot 
 moves then under my clothes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Jane Through the Garden 
 
 
 I may have had something
