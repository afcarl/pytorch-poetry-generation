 
 Since thus my love, once, sweet, beginning moved 
 Raleigh, stunned Girl, this very year, 
 Love, my freedom now Forged 
 Stared at emptiness: possessive. 
 And dances, disconsolate Helen, 
 And yet I am healed, 
 And works to ground the sky! 
 They brush me from my Fanfare 
 I'll get my body! 
 I hope midwinter. 
 
 C. songs: he outfit, 
 The Lady o' loves and fruits. 
 Ye me, that old spark? poets bore, 
 Your views are warding;
