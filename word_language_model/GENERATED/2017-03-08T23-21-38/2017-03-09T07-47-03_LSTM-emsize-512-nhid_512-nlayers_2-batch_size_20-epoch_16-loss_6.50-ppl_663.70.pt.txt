All My Torment, 

 Who is born well is hacked up by happiness, 
 But my kind words first loud for an itch in the toothpick, 
 For all buds that have never wise inflaming 
 Even the only self can not, who made me look back and forth, 
 Even on the south I find their dead voices pennies forever behind them 
 As the white and white rain sinks them up to the chin. 
 
 And you know why they must wake with the sea
