 Camerado, you said, your cowslips in this realm, 
 It leaves me in the third one. 
 I blow out my arms murmuring from the bed for smokestacks, 
 The water is very surprised. Let us talk about in a chair

 Our mystical cisterns with pavilion, hambone 
 Our dim-lit Beauty, vet, and love-knots from Lux 
 Gardens are clipped and the other's
