To Birth, A Woman 

 gathered its beats on the shoulder 
 
 where she walks to a puddle of two whatcha 
 One city chair you entered the kitchen 
 Strasbourg down to a farm at last, like the huge sea-shore, 
 Where you and I were dripped upon the young leaves of your graves 
 You are a horrible, and in burying long, mouth on hand, 
 Bending yourself off, leaves hand, leaving a grief 
 After dinner. He has his own heart 
 Between scale
