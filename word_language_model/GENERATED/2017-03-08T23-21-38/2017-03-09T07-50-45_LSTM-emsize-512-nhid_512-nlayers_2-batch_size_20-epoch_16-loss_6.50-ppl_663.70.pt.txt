Days 

 
 That knows the children of the seasons, 
 
 like the bed-- 
 they look a straight in the bone And a stupid promontory of black fish 
 rising in its bleak brow. 
 
 This is what this unwelcome energy to see 
 the stars waiting in the nest 
 that has always been coming, 
 
 and the thoughts tend to tik-tak, 
 to scale the notes flung from soul. 
 
 
 
 
 
 letters, You've not dominoes
