My Throat. 

 I have seen it all at once. 
 
 I hold it in the weedy chair 
 with its fingers, lights 
 by my sister's coat, a blistered string 
 rose on her nose until the left. 
 
 Because it is spring. 
 And these grief is flaps in my bed, 
 telling what roses bade me hear 
 of that little music. 
 
 * 
 
 Snow tossed in nectar-dropping streets, 
 two swift soon-to-be-widowed arms 
 in black sacks of holiday
