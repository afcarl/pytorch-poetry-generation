Jesus. 

 
 Because it was a proper hoof of nature 
 magnificently always had a Catrina 
 sharing the one of the divestiture of Clay and serves you a quell'd 
 Better and when I fed a Smoothing without loss, 
 Bacchantes drinking through black rings of dying years; 
 The treddode, and the psychiatrists, are killed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The vicious Catalpa 
 
 
 These my dark eyelids trembling at me, 
 All the flowers that eat my days as fishbait
