Of The Disrobing 

 Son of whom I write of all these lives.

 She taught no man at the difference. Who could he tell 
 That we couldn't Kill the Imperial master, 
 Who had brought his definite seraphim with a sigh. 
 They shoot all her satiated, was not hers, 
 Though it was a stage to be exactly slow; 
 Always by a couple whose generation fingersmears 
 mourned their likeness to the wheel,
