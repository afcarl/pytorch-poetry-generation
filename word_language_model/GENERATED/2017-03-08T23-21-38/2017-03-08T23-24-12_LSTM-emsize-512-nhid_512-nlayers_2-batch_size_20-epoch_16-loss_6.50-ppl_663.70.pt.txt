The Grass, 

 and let no stories I could not go, 
 nor tell to little strains . . . 
 
 Who is the wheel, I'd say, 
 if every day in winter, lock 
 the image of rainforest, thumb. 
 It is black in the throat of trees. What 
 good is, the socks angle up 
 and stand, where the great suns are stacked 
 cottony beneath the sun 
 late winter, breathe shifted to the right. 
 The soldier's garden gone, 
 are archetype,
