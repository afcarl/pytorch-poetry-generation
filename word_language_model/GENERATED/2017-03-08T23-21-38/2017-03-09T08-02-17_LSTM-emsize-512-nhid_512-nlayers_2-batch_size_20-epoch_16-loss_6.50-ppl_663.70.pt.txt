Buick And In Their Laurel Breath, 

 Leaving the sorry; crab 
 with the scaly fury farmer. 
 
 generation is sprouts in distant order of the air. 
 I write a silver class for a broken clock. 
 I'll earned myself, and feel it is rain. 
 I'd just say, go wide, 
 hear it cry. 
 
 I'm taking off water, October, like the trees 
 Creek, the big sticks, back to the dark 
 of that dark field, our place my mother 
 
 was
