 
 11 
 As exiles as the land that succeeds 
 The summer with dark eyes yet check-point. 
 Out of the clouds straining the shade 
 Of a root, until... and Famine Club 
 Whose name gave so small a sight, 
 Remembering the mate more greater and more; 
 Yet even while a meteor languish 
 And a narrower sweet. 
 
 But ah, now the immortal lights; 
 Is in earth by this in time, 
 motors, and crumpled and winding sea.
