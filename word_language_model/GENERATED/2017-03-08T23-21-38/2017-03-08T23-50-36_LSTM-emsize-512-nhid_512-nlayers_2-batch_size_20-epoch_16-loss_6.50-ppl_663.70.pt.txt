I Bend. 

 
 That's mine. 
 I'll drive the elbow all gathering over, 
 I've always allowed the things to live 
 Near in Friday emblems. 
 And when I look at you so clear, 
 And, like that none I know: 
 
 
 
 
 
 A Lad in a Key May 
 
 
 People turn together 
 from an illuminated death 
 in the regal apple 
 of not-there. Gilgamesh. 
 tombstone drawn 
 
 and Charles dressed in 
 wine, tinkle in
