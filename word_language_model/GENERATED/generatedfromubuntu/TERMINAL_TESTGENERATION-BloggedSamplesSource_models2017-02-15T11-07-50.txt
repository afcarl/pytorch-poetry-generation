 Where the guards go, as they written.

 Wandering where silence is born, 
 And the years once to end wish greted,

 And a little girl since the heart of him all morning will cry to it; 
 This morning, a little girl rebel: 
 Illiterate 
 Her bird is careful, her sloth's knee puir 
 Borne from her foliage; does not think of 
 The intelligence of how many hours we pursue 
 Her howlet's playmates in her face. 
 
 Or stays to brush her shaggy mustache 
 To banish her cheap jellies, 
 And joy in high uphill from late rose 
 And cheerful home in a lunar pride, 
 From clue; she chanted out of sight,
