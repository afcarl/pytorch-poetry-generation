 As a warning would shine again through

 And brethren bursting over the ceiling.

 The curd-pale water and the glare poseur, 
 Then the tramp

From Repaire. 

 In thick green streets, gliding  
 Pain held us, 
 Perhaps it should give. 
 But body has no old comfort. 
 
 And out of oblivion, stones 
 Think passages thru a truth
 That lifts the shuddering light 

 & where the glass blows 
 It takes.

 Around the scenes of doom 
 And oddly piney

 In yonder eastern

 Begin, creation's fleet 
 Dessert, inward eye.

 This scarred room

 The thought that looked like war,  
 And then nothing to love. 

 Now the sunsets.

 Comes forth as slowly as a dawn.

 When I came to keep 
 Their sleep being asking

 My mother entered her clothes threading

 Small blood gongs.

 In his soft rest the spaniel, The Day was dreary, 
 On the back porch, the hill is strewn 
 Across the long chaff, which are the swift 
 Last party of the highest you’ll resist 
 A burnt-out daughter crouched in a door, 
 That's him next to the blackboard, 
 The steady level of his calling. 
 
 The ash is similarly still.

 She'd be practiced breasts or skirts 
 On the wild void of the sea rising 
 Or fell divinity-- nor even tuft his eyes 
 And gone away in a valley on all this same town 
 
 Born to his voice there in my hair 
 Rising there in the jewelled glass

 And John courage is a share, 
 And he patted them in their grave;

 And drives a palace star,

 But when the fields are blushing and I hear
