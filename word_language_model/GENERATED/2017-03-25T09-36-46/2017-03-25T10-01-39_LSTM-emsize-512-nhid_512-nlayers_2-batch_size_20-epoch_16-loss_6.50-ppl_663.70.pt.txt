 In eleven millions gathering 
 
 for globes on the dead, in condescention 
 of the smaller room!'--I'm poets sometimes. 
 
 You are not sorry 
 for those who are arranged on you. 
 I would it love is otherwise my womb 
 than your passage, not even the people 
 
 after my Trophies, your jaws.

 "They are here. 
 What--relief--when rose; I sit on that fence 
 beside the brain
