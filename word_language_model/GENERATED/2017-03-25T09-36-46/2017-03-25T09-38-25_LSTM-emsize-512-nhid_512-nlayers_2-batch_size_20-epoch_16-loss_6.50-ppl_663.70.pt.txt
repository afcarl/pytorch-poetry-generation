Songs, Ghostly And Gold, 

 Skimming and dimes before the gold which hissed in the motes 
 Of the women with river of beasts thrown out like distance, 
 ruby-circled juices come to face for passionate rays 
 Like a cemetery, 
 But within the distilled. Not hats, 
 Wee tiger interrogating? 
 Revolving upon seventh. 
 Tartarus. 
 Swallow motorbike. 
 Flying trolley and -slimmer. 
 W'en Christ, birds, stink and rainbows of 
 Sworn rules, heat; 
 Boomlay, boomlay, boom. 
 lifdon shaped like the smoked
