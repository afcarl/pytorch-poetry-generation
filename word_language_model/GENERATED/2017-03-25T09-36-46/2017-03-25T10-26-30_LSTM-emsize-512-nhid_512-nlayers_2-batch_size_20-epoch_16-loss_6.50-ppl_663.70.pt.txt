Anomaly. Old Woman 

 left him 
 
 he can't see all by.* Caucasus 
 
 It is, still for me. 
 
 Alexandria, Nights 
 hospital the window turns an explanation. 
 How cold a life to hide me there? 
 
 O revolution, 
 
 
 II 
 
 
 It's villains the tortures covente said, 
 This hell is not worth that. 
 In a fine September darkness 
 
 Driving across my shoulder seat: 
 
 The wine that caught my fingers gathered
