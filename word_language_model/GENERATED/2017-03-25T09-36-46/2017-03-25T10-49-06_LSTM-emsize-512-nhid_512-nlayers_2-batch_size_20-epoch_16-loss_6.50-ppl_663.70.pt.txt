 The wind I read you first as ever empire? 
 & I say it's Cheap, pretending your brain 
 Urg'd it, I too exhausted against the spheres. 
 
 Perhaps it is the silence that neither mother 
 But from the dressmaker's bed Of the mouth, when she 
 asks me: Take my love, but I have never 
 But what would she have was by intervals from me. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Dead Prayer 
 
 
 My father has no idea
