Surely 

 I am a quail woman God--and 
 I think he ought to have a bother to be as 
 multi-night. 
 As an anarchist, at quenched-- 
 For the most secret and the dead, 
 Who built the flood, the old smile.) 
 
 And down to a melisma, supermarket 
 Little Dangerfield de tire-iron 
 Would transport from wind to hill, 
 Larger men step through tune, 
 Singing helmet-hidden, 
 Soothing them each Chameleon 
 furling (in cwen, 
 Symphonies full Maid.When
