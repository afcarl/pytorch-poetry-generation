Days. 

 
 The dust only had come from all forth, 
 There was nothing but moment so strange it was there. 
 
 By the listening fallen, where sinks the crest they segura 
 For sweet Cherube, or as it tells it, he farming those old lives. 
 
 I see him lying on the breast of the western thrones 
 When we are young and I must cry. 
 
 
 
 
 
 In the Praise of Honour in Frysum. 
 
 
 My lashes
