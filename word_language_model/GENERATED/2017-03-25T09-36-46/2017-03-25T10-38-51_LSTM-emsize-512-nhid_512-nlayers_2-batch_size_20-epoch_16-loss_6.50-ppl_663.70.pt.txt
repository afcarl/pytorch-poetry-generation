The Gate 

 of ash, on a red shirt show 
 light behind the white bench, cut 
 skirts shoulders a dandelion heart, 
 a constellation of straw, 
 the old mother child 
 cry my father among she'll drive 
 
 her red-forest meat the leg 
 Debas'd by God, She fights 
 Her name and wears a dove 
 
 A court she has folded up 
 
 So the same air has covered her, 
 A peculiar commotion 
 Now one white flower nailed to
