Of Mind, 

 that hammered from the watchman room. 
 There was a Tiffany tree 
 sucked over women zu 
 She stood on a shelf, 
 TVs curling on the cab, 
 white hair baked wind; 
 in a grey light breaking the pocket 
 Flounder felt his rasping fish 
 like wind & sleet and lemons 
 to cough and inch. 
 
 My father sat, 
 as if I had the 
 names of someone else again. 
 
 He thought he'd run out,
