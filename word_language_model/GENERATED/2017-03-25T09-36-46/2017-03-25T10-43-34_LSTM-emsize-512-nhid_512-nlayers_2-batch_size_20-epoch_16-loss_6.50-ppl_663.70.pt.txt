The Tour Hand Milk-Breathed 

 malingers. I watched a rushing sound 
 Appointed to adjust my life. I spy with pain, 
 I stand with flowers within its ears! 
 Grow all his parts he laid at me 
 And now my soul would recognize my life 
 By knowing as the rest of things 
 Could bend into a woman's face. 
 
 Their temples filled with ice and seasons, 
 As well as judge their solitudes tears!" 
 The only blood and I should die.
