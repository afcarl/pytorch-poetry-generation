A Blur, 

 And a tear of his great sword at once 
 Stretching by himself spirits among his lids, 
 Only his gift was that small unravelling reward: 
 For one word he hath made in such a maiden's 
 
 As with a mirror when it is! Aialon, 
 By old desirenothing of ashes ring; 
 He too hath been a better since. 
 Quicken not to mention their pack, 
 Nor in fall weather to see 'em fall, 
 Nor any feel new visits d'etat
