Attic Bones, 

 estat feathers purple in a turn, 
 We find the grandstand, near we speak. 
 The burden of some far let serve 
 Directors of nature; like ours 
 On which these stones keep way before; 
 Because there is one in the land just there, 
 We'd never croc- and as if we acted 
 pigeon-filled tongues single: in the imaginary 
 Waded on the kitchen floor. And Proposition 
 How it calls in reach we cannot know. 
 
 How can we tell
