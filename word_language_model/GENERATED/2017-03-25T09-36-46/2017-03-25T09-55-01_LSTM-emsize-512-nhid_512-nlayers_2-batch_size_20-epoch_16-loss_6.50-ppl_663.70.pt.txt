 It had wet music his hands 
 As he splits the rage of his mania 
 
 Into the office, it was past! 
 All the country lay all bare. 
 The rain was shrivelled with the heat, 
 The sheet of clumps that glittered 
 And roaring like peaks 
 That lived when always rivers went Bore: 
 On patient walls while "Mark's 
 love-root, records the riot of elegy 
 And ate the way a poor sad old blade. 
 
 Now God come home
