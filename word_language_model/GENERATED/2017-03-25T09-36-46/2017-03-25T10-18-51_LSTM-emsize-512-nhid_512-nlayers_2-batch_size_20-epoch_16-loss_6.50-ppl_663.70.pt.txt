 the unseen irritated eyebrows 
 of the helpless. 
 
 willing to scream, 
 Here, with lamps moving, 
 that would pause, 
 blood in, shall touch 
 criminals fade 
 from place or danger 
 like as usual as well. 
 Inside the church are clouds 
 and heads and kisses 
 the color & despotic Directed 
 at the sluices worth sick for ocean. 
 
 Were they white Toast for birds, 
 dancing in the fuchsia 
 by the monuments they sea-fight?
