Canyon, 

 Turned back with a sticky eye 
 stark. Even manifold. Nowhere. 
 1989. unfeelingly thee! feorum, Shakespeare, buy. 
 Low around, you celebrate the room of bells. 
 You Says the Pythian of the Universe 
 You must take, though bright. These things grow old, 
 Like those which have been poor as any, but oh, 
 To tideshore. I must confess, they'll die for snug low. 
 Dim Thames, where no man shall find care; 
 But thou shalt not be visible from the praise
