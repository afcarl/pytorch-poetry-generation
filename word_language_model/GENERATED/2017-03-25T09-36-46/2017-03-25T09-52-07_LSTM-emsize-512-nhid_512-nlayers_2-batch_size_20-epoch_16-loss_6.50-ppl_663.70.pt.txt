Foreigner At Their Door Like A Chalk Footloose 

 crushes, Ellen, her hand 
 Is white drunken back hangover, all the year, 
 
 With her foot the holds of the Black Bear dress of brilliance 
 Her limbs in cabin's dare, some, to pry 
 Their claws and renew her the fisher, she walks 
 Into the axe, not one shall fling 
 Without ease the tangos muffler youth 
 Whenever my brother turned. 
 
 And I said the night had crashed between the fruit,
