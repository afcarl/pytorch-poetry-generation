For Interrogating? 

 Since there it is no longer 
 weather unwounded pleyne 
 the past the salt of night by morning, 
 as though it Grant too many living oaks, 
 a kind of lineup 
 a different taste 
 this without a syrmate 
 a love like has rocket open 
 tumults winter 
 
 a body, cool Pott's and green 
 red polished branches 
 floating dirty in 
 intestine arms. 
 mustard ceiling, 
 wandering calm. 
 Next morning each glad--even 
 another house
