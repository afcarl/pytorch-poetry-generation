From Cloud To Wind. 

 
 The shadow of thy carriage, each of the temple 
 Of algae and of Adraste 
 Below the million vermilion women 
 Or distant masks they did sweat in the skies. 
 About the wind-shaken bases loud 
 Stands adored the wild Within 
 Of thoughts with sun and storms and griefs, 
 'Twas in love that make the afar 
 Save where both palaces are brought across 
 Themselves to battle by sweet woods, 
 How, by the loud and holy
