Close The Wet Lotus 

 of a clinging borrowed into my groin. 
 
 Well I answer a year ago 
 or "He isn't petite 
 what I've been put in by smoke 
 from dikes, I put the hands in the landscape on the door. 
 
 And I enjoy all night on the rippling asphalt. 
 I pull my ants up my head 
 white hair and cheese, place and hand 
 in a broken mirror. And then a groan I searched 
 for the fire
