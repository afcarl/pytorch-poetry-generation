Sailed 

 At the midnight's point of their bed for years, 
 And the sick of them were lost still; 
 For ever the time they lived in sight of life, 
 The strange and dark they tried to rise away, 
 And drown beyond the world of speech; 
 
 So the weary wave charter to one, 
 Through those large passage from the womb, 
 
 Their white backless stands 
 
 In the open flats safe they wade again 
 
 To turn the angels
