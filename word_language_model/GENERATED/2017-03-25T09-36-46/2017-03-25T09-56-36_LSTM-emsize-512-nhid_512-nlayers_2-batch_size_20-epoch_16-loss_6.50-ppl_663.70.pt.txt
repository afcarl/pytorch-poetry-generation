To You Give. 

 
 
 
 
 
 White Lines at the Windows 
 
 
 The plane blooms and sings. 
 
 Every morning you are too worth! 
 a year ago, keelson 
 and ballet share 
 of hair but of death 
 and unseen Walked into the latest 
 anus of rose from your mouth. 
 
 More dead have you picked 
 the welling punch to your car, 
 let us the cops leave this home. 
 From God, there is blacker, ice
