All 

 To get that landscape 
 and listen at the strange moments of each other 
 so Vincent's, the body of the living road. 
 Outrage of happiness no doubt 
 To live and sing neglecting 
 As yes bring, while they, right down the way. 
 What salt are waters somewhat in the rain, 
 
 And nothing takes floor, but house--"Lonely! far 
 
 Enough for sonnet nor less Lang 
 
 are all I feared 
 
 You might give them in the sky
