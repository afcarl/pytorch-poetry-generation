 oxidize. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Whoever Poem Is Not You 
 
 
 I am matters 
 To dream the words 
 The poem 
 By which there is such my time 
 In mouth and turn and beard,

 Beyond one character, the guns Gethsemane, 
 Whose heads fall, yielding leaving grace, 
 They've melted through one forest tree, 
 Nobody but two times buried, 
 A broken law blew out one
