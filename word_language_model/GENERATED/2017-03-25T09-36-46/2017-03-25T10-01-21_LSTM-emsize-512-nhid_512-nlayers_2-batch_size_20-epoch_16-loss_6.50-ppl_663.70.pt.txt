What Shield: 

 adult, everlasting light 
 And crimson of the trees, 
 Which dies with flowers, sleepwalk and sere-- 
 And strangeness on the shore; 
 And such as go things to feel 
 Some things that touch or take, 
 Nor the hand that led back stones 
 Round the smooth Brahms? 
 No handicapped ancients--and no light ends, 
 Nothing must believe it, even 
 As we should meet 'em alive. 
 Why am they at Magnolia 
 After such divorce-court lamentation:
