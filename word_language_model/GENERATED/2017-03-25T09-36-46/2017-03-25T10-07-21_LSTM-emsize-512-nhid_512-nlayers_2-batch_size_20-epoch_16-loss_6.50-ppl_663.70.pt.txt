Player, 

 from earth and Tone Foam'd 
 that it all grows lost in one. 
 courthouse ease, this doors are eastern 
 with its heavy smell of words 
 carnivorous or bad perchance 
 as a dog aside--we language, and I 
 will hear them sing 
 with a strange fortune, range 
 from my flower. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Wee Brown 1654 
 
 
 She sat 
 six months ago inside. 
 This morning I was the middle 
 of my tiredness,
