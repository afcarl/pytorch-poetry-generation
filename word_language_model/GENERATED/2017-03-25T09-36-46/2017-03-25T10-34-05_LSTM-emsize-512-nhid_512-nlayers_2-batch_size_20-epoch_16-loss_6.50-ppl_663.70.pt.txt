The Schemes Of Cooter O Swallow, 

 bulges in the blinded mouth and tender Taurus 
 
 O thy dominion now, I have been to thee, 
 Low smitten with the suffering I shall see, 
 O fain O ye alas, that we are not ours dumb. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Statesmen 
 
 
 Love, where the world is mocking 
 For sure the lonely arrows still send 
 
 For them to fault and to make this 
 Saying for his misery
