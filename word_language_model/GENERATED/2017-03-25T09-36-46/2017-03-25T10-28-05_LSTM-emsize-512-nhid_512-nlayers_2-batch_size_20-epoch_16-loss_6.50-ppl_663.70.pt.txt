Spore-Born Chang 

 The sea splits round and aloof, 
 I sit alone in the wild grove of the sea. 
 I have seen the Whole Turn, whom 
 They live on me a morning, 
 Did they foul as young young men 
 From manifold dangers, live to meet 
 His spotty jeans, his vespers 
 sad-hopeful healthy, skirts of scarves, 
 And, after mirror--no bending up the mountain, 
 Hastiness across the eyeballs, Then 
 He says the practical low line . . . 
 On
