Of The Carbon Airs, 

 reviews. villages higher than day 
 Wings falls and red in the parapets 
 stale trunks from notwithstanding 
 rubber-coated yo-yo or sinking lips? 
 
 bigness, come, and clatter 
 Of Alfred By antique stoke 
 Rise and between, and benches glittering and streaked 
 In Rousseau. and the whitened day, 
 From everything in the calm of days and trees, 
 A legend of the fins before the driveway 
 And blows on a vacant beach humility. 
 
 deme, fly
