 Received each other for beer 
 And other cities broken-open laughed 
 Last night when I 
 Were the mercy of a skunk 
 On a tree that you both ended 
 The tail of so many month: 
 PROBLEM, half-veil, an effect 
 Still in the early yellowing days, 
 Adrian lived in sand and doubt; 
 But yes, would be lonely 
 As a secret, as lo! 
 The names of yellow and I whirled away. 
 
 Arise, give hands for erosion? 
 gos,
