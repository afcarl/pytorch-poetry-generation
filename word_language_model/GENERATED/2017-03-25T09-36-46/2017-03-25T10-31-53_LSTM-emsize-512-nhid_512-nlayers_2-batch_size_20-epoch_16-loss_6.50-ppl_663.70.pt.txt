The Head I Wake 

 & come, her weigh-- my softness freshening 
 She is too heavy for stupidity 
 and keeps it blind without gold, 
 and she is the name to feed her 
 from Rhine, Washington from my clothes. 
 Would it changes if I could watch her. 
 It's like me in earth. 
 Green chalk. They begin 
 from note in the street. 
 My mother claimed fluttering dresses 
 bearing white hairs from her toes, 
 dry gold feet on dirty manscaa
