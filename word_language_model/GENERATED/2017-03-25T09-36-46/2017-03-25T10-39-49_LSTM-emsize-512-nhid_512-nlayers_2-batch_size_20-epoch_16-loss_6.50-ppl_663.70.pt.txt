Call It Notable Damasco, 

 When my situation begins. I channeling much in face, 
 In the absence of a virgin's savage dream, 
 To receive the fruit of the river on the road and sea, 
 Or on hope where the world's may be; 
 Nor when only I think about small remorse, 
 Nor am I but out of old water in bow-chopping 
 Old exile, white ground, the hill that fashioned me 
 From the elaborate Ferry, pit, and when my own.
