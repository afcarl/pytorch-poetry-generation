Is Sin 

 for the experience of meaningless gods 
 fitting all of us 
 for who remains 
 but Flegrean 
 although ground comes 
 along this hill, 
 as they walk late 
 and are filled, leaks 
 among those crust 
 
 These crows in their stalls 
 ("It is all one 
 is first torn in its life 
 and your future single toys 
 make bad step together 
 stirring the beginning 
 of the slicing juice 
 to leave words
