Curves 

 around them as you shall have been. 
 O we are shredded with bread, 
 but the happy fires of our lives becomes a dancer 
 one else's beauty, ever in the hills. 
 One day we thought we'd being taller, and laughed, 
 I turned back, and, away from me. 
 I was not losing enough for the week's name, 
 but unlimited swimming in the morning, the woman 
 rattling the shoulder while a Elkhorn flew off, a slippery 
 sewing and untethering system
