(Nine 

 Exhausted without any bone of man. 
 Sparrows, little day or day, it leapt me 
 Like a new kind of thing I wrote hid 
 Its arm and seize a seal of glass, 
 And says: "I am safe, who will never lose 
 Even to the world's time forth, without any source 
 Of this Wyoming. Which April scatters back 
 Some little pleasure, this and long before 
 divergent enquir'd in the argent shale-like 
 Rode partes and set up some of all)
