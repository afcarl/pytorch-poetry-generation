To Bed, 

 so the forest, all the paper, 
 the next, the sleep: 
 The words are not common as they. 
 Dry ghosts little nearly nail up their meat, 
 these years, he has himself playing 
 more than inexorably can, 
 but in the lucky path universe always drained 
 of mute boughs--so loud; Triangle pours over light 
 leans on the crotch, and goes blind down 
 into the tunnel of a bomb 
 in the big blue gas of ovens and entreating jacket
