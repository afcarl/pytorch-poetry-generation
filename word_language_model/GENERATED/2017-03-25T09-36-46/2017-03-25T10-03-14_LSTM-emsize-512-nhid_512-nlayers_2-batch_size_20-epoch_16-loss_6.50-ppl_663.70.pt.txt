What I See Say 

 or the bearm. pajamas, that 
 lovely-- mind muscling-in 
 for the high red gloss 
 of the star-lit anchor ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 "Although the Cross 
 
 
 Here's the unlit coal 
 With shadow fallen & falls 
 Come into my "moonlight 
 We watched as evening land; 
 We now have fought, but she brows, 
 Perhaps what was nowhere done 
 For the long mornings, the light of spring. 
 Attend her from the shades
