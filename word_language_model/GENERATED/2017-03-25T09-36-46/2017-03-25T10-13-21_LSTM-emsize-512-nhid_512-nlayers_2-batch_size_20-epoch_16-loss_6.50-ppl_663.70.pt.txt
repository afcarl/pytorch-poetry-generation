May Do It: 

 ylade rub bullets modor. tin adulterate flesh, 
 Yonder light overhead ceaseless night 
 with brittle bowls of maple, interposest, a wolf of summer scarred grow: 
 push? thick. Six of lager 
 size in the grip of a fountain. revelers. 
 berries were full of leaves amid carrion. 
 We Majesty, tightly on the northern floor, 
 Or swamps the spreading whispers, make! 
 Getting a paternoster Dorus of the mind's debris, 
 Kings. waving sizes. ombre trivial, 
 And Delty delves, Muster
