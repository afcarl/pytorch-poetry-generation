Hen Is To Me: 

 For having been there once more for her 
 Though it is not others' than that! 
 She calls him in the place; 
 When old John London wakes 
 Lacking a velvet closet, 
 puzzling to me, my Pound and power 
 Words patiently have heard: 
 I kept him of the listening door. 
 
 I travel through a dim and deep; 
 We fail'd by hopes - An' John, I cried, 
 "If you lose a world have thirsts.
