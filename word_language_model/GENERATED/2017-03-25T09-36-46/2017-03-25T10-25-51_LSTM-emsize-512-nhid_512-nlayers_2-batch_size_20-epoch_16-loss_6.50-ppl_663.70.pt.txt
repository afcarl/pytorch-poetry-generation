Down 

 the night's imagination or son 
 I'm with you on skeleton. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Falling as an scipherge Poem 
 
 
 For Live in her dress he put away in her neck 
 and crush the seal they've burned all time 
 with his legs and ankles round her husband's clothing 
 but very mentioned that 
 that Sundays to divide in Jeff's 
 parodies the prickly spiritual fragments of pain. 
 And there all the grocery definitions of Fiddleton bones,
