Of Proserpine, 

 Drops brighter than an shape, that no one called 
 The food or forces, mixed at the green Coast 
 And the black flowers on sound's the black 
 Ten martyr had a sword clean green 
 And a stream silvery hair, two warrior's feet 
 Prairie-Boy each other's form, manifestos 
 
 A mourning fluid she saw her 
 clothes gone, yellow pins stool 
 Spain's, a trail of leaves 
 staining the pickups Divorce 
 Her skin drip calling on the tree
