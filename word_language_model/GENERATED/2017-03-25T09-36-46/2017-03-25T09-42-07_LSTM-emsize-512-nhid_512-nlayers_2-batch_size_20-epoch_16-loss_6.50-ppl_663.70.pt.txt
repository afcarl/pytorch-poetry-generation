The Whiskey In The Basin 

 & a untidy Dream 
 trapped about by the nearest windows 
 the housewife crawls out, slowly 
 blast after step covers the dream 
 to an icy July, in the huddling 
 filmy fur. When the mice bloom 
 we pointed to the salt where shop flung 
 their impassive limbs into the soft #9002 blowing 
 
 A hoarse light from the salt lozenge 
 to be crawled mad, a kind of ice in a landscape. 
 Around bow'r looped
