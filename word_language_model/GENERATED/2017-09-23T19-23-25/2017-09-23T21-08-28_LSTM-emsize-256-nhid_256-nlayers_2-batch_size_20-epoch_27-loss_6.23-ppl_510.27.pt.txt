 "Doth 
 Gentle Phi 
 Shoes have been back there 
 At the edge of the ocean and the noise still vintage 
 With pork wings. 
 Dry with a brazen manuscript? 
 The omen of the suffering dreams the beginning 
 My body in my comfort music, 
 I pray as the current is full of light? 
 
 You don't 
 listen and trust it 
 Ad kindness 
 and never let it, 
 suffused with thought, 
 who neither 
 feel for me.
