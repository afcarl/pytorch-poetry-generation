 Voluptuous hair, turning 
 The winds from the night of weary years. 
 Your whole indispensable 
 
 Has been thighs! 
 
 We must thicknesses 
 us to Firestone 
 yet the blood's turns, and must 
 
 devour our fruits 
 to the secret locust 
 with walls and lace lie 
 in our edges. 
 
 
 
 
 At dawn, she 
 loves one who entered the flock. 
 I wake when she came out gone, 
 but you repeat a phallic, then
