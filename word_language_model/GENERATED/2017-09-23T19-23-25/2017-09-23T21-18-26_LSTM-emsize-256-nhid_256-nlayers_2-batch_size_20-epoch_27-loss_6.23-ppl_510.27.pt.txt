 
 Who knows that unawares, 
 are stirring up, 
 wave-wash'd and hectic snow, 
 the bar. Give us its 
 secrets more through the wrong hand.

 the child kissed Brainscans 
 unless first more beautiful. 
 
 
 
 Some child speaks pay inside every crevice 
 every morning woman's Nectar sip 
 gather, dazzling chain 
 tampax at noon, with imaginations with 
 public tone as far as dust,
