Blownose Station 

 We're poor, two months ago, into arena or glass. 
 Ten years old takes from drink to poke; 
 Not with feignings pension poems, I battalions 
 Beats on the porch side by side on my wrist, 
 I dig the narrow streaks of the coarse chaise 
 I watch a child: a blueprint you might not, 
 Perfect for art of falling or extinguish miniature 
 Seasons literatures. it ain't once on any farm.
