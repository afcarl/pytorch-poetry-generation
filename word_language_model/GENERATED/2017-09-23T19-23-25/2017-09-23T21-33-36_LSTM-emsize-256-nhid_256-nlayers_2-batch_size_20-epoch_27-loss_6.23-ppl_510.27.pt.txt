Bedding Stones Through Shabby-Genteel - On High, 

 And Nature had delighted all; 
 And comes from out that glittering leaf. 
 
 In the family this poor vision 
 Of many a nation took my fayre. 
 
 Worn out of the air but men might not speak, 
 Nor was my son, no far-wandered 
 stomach is no good, no voice whispering 
 With his welcome and fear of me. 
 
 THYRSIS 
 Why would you come to the apartment, 
 this game "purl,"
