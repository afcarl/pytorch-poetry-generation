Nyne 

 
 For dear greatest king, 
 For love and fear and wantonness 
 Caught in through my marvellous hand! 
 
 And poised stretching down the tingling hill 
 
 skulls--once gild me, and the voice of breath, 
 
 Woven of the full spell of the heart 
 I feel you sleep in a manger 
 
 In the days of dying days. 
 
 
 It is my mysteries to hide the sun, 
 
 And the ripening record of your hair rushed away
