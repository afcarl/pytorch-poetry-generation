I Saddled A Boy 

 To feed the cord away to hear his eyes 
 And not to wake him to the company 
 Like some visitor moss 
 And maybe pronounc'd the sun. 
 
 He clasp? but that he strokes the dead, 
 An idea, it was a perfect boy! 
 And, he was never watercresses to disclose, 
 And he must have passed his shadow away 
 With interminable sense and moan, 
 And a few more of words he knew 
 He knows it
