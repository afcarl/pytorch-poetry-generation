The Great Woman Wave? 

 At once a grave of cypress dew. 
 She last man's mother's soul in bars, 
 In suburb of white hair before in a trance, 
 Which bears it on with sunken ashtray. 
 While he nears her upon his own,i 
 And birth mazes from him he brings, 
 And does not mind these wonders grow. 
 His strong estate, if living, and circl'd, a dance; 
 And bears out, men attempt to break them worse. 
 No harness sharpens this in
