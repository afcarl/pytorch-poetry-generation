These Din Of Sleep Is Green, 

 Rise (allegro) by darkest low: 
 And tarries silently from me to see what cares 
 In that low light, so lately distracted 
 To call them up the dear land nor fair. 
 
 Come, think, O Lull'd with trembling wine! 
 Ah! the perfect swords of Minnehaha 
 Arrives at cowboys like a ghost, 
 And a choir of lion and a tangle coolness 
 And hid his crops, and between them shut; 
 And in their courtyard they
