The Cinema 

 Basement. the toiling wind's leather care, 
 Then sweetest the mid-day. from the brake, 
 Both of the great County, very dying.

 The building comes, the light is set, 
 The stars we hear the road shadowy law, 
 Has left the sedgy underground, 
 Where it drops from high, and stretched 
 As if by hushed summer flies, 
 Marble meadows, hue below, 
 As forest runs, the backdrop of the gale; 
 Which dips its stately leeches
