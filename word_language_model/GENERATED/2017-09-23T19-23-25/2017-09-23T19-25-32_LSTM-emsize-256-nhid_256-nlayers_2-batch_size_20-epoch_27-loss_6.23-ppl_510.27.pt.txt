 
 This is lovely at last, O sweet pose, 
 Stomacher: the Milled, syringes. 
 Stroke! resuscitation Poet 
 "Had only in the pendulous 
 Too much room to start by downs 
 Among regret and non-placed 
 They are no more than these glad; 
 
 Whatever earth, avails heart, 
 turn into shame and strife. 
 
 First living, as we least 
 told me, 
 
 and what thy gret withdraw'st, 
 Forgive me, done before thee, 
 This is Love's shape, 
 Laugh
