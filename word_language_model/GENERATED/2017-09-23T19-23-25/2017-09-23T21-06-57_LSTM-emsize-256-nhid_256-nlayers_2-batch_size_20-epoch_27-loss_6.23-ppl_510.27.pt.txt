 
 I expected a good way where I lived, 
 Vessels small, another, 
 I find the old house that packing 
 and washed my head in claps 
 upon the sewer Milano 
 and 'ee at the succulent 
 both universe? Junkies 
 my subject. 
 The way they could drop my strength; 
 I witness in stones as when 
 you were not ready to meet us, 
 drinking them in the knives and beneath fever 
 of sinking, 
 the heavy, paternal Friday.
