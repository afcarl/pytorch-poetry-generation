 And I eat to shield Thee with deer unwilling to glide, 
 Which I by now and knew for him, can I see the greatness of my fingerprints 
 With the dull sky blueâ€”the the pints of a bird sleeping on my ears, 
 I let my back fall on your guts and inhabit and loud, 
 licenses, crazy, a thaw of grass, 
 Give me turning, leaning on the glass; 
 The river your Tunisian vowels absorb by 
 The new world 'twixt flesh we crave
