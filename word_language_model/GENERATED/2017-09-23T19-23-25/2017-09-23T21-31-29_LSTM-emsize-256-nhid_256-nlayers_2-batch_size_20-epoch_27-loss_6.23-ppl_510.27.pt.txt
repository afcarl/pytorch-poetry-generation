 On the floorâ€” "Our gav'st for Revolucon 
 Little Pansy and miniature blacked. 
 cunt other wrong: slim enough 
 To make America in African pain 
 Easing the glass of women, obeyed? 
 
 Chaste to enjoy you as the ones 
 Of law may break them free, 
 As over the blackened walker-in-shadow. 
 You travel squinting up with a cast 
 Of barren dust, gum in Plain blankets 
 Seem drifting from the sky, without the close, 
 Another day that part at night
