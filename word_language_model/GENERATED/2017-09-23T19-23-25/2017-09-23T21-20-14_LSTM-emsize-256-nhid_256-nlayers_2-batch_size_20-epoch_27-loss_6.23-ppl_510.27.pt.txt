Like The Moon'S Cavernous Light 

 In a small boat, to even the four onions, Reverberating--in an arrow 
 I see the skull in the southwest deep in the walls 
 Singing making flame aeronauts on the high branch 
 Of the disturbing blindness. 
 
 Sunlight is winter, 
 d'Espoir and sedate 
 And green leaves rising in a belt 
 The marble tall leaves flicker out 
 In juicy chalk. 
 Come away from water to the house, 
 brisk, lit, and head 
 Lifting peelings,
