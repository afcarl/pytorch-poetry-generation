As Though It Trembled Yet 

 When silence is my soul 
 Cheer like a walrus, or a dream, 
 revenging blue, with fruit of sound. 
 
 If but when it speak, no light no moon 
 Could I hide most, for the sea I tread, 
 No one ever more! But 
 If I could die no doubt Dices 
 But my bark, keenly fuck and ironed 
 And close to thread. 
 
 I bring me cards on childhood, 
 Each part of assents,
