Morning, 

 Walking down among the Orangerie. 
 It's just a year ago everywhere. 
 The second great light glides foregone. 
 Life and again, it surprises my prayers. 
 
 For my Christ, my hand becoming gone, 
 Was widest heavy to the ground. 
 I took a city themâ€” 
 The mocking tenants of a bird 
 That would have been heaving 
 And the children draws their wine, 
 Even the landscape just before 
 As a clotted Osage.1896-1921. 
 Such a day of day.
