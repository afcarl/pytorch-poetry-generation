 I speak too much for thee! 
 That suffering will be for me thee? 
 When I have found the man of death 
 Climbing the dark stair, 
 Mysterious, falcon like a full ship, 
 I await a passion: 
 three enclosed lovers as led to me. 
 Five summers, to say caught up away. 
 I ain't not told him, 
 I will never be collected 
 when I have come to claim 
 what women wish I could not change, 
 but crouch upon
