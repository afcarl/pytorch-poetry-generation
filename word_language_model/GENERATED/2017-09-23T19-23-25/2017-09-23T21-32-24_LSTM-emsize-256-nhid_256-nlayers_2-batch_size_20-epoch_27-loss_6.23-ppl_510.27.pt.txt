The Two 

 
 Things stop you felt like a signet-seal's 
 After start in love in a small version 
 Gandhi's jostle discourses 
 feet-- upright; Fat! solemne kissin' for starlight, 
 Watch a medley of fear of the constellacioun, 
 Behind us extinct is its mouth-- 
 So the heart is the flesh quay? 
 Its sound will carry forth, year upward under the 
 moon's cold pines of crimson wings, flutters over the beach 
 rude as a boy singing from the disciples deck,
