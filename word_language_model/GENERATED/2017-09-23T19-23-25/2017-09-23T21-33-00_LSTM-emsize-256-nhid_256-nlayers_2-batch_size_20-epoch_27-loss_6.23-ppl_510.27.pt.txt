 
 A new green sea in May, 
 Naked can thunder still, and drink, 
 With fond surprise, 
 By-cause this morning, but still 
 In heavy eye of the grass: 
 What you, each night, and bade me stutter 
 What huge eyes became a worm. 
 
 
 
 I lived with God's intent under the wood: 
 With tranquil heated legs. 
 Among the years I saw was mould-black 
 with might.-- who was Honest cook 
 Mouse upon Hell and lord!" â€“
