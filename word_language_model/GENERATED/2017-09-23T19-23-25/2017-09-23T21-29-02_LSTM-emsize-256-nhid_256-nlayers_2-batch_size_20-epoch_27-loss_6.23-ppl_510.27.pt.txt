 Perhaps such a way I've sung 
 The raw aroun' nubs divine. 
 
 This 
 darkness; and name? 
 Was it too sore to be, 
 bales on DeMille he said, 
 unbuilds try't may be dey 
 By all those Universe, 
 I sometimes think her day 
 For the Lord than I: 
 The day with this last wreath of bees, 
 You bin things rosewater. 
 We chained and glitters and unfold. 
 
 But it was so, for all the fire
