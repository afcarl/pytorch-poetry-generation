Alcohol And Time 

 We Deloria, the people of light. 
 
 To swallow those storms against the bleak God 
 Came killed, try to hear my mother's voice 
 And set with Sky, unexpectedness 
 I try to us safely 
 In a lonely pail, a little dollar blue, 
 Not with all things, much or more bright than sky; 
 Through the long air of time, now noon and rain; 
 The mimic man was all around: 
 mororbealo him, reindeer's he blew him out
