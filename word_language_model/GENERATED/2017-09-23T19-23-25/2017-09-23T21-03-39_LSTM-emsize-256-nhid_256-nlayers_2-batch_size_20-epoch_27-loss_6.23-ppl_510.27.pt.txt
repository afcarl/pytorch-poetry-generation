 As the stroke of hot birds pass 
 Over the lovelorn shore, 
 Where the ovens are extinguished, 
 Here is no shame to remember. 
 
 Look how kirks; 
 Hark, left Cuffing the canvas flowers 
 Between their path doth soon intrude, 
 And shadows grow at last, 
 Like the moon's eglantine; 
 Under the tents below 
 waits-- like a microscopic cent. 
 These flowers have lived and resting 
 In Summer, while the brooks 
 Shook all my silver strains pursue;
