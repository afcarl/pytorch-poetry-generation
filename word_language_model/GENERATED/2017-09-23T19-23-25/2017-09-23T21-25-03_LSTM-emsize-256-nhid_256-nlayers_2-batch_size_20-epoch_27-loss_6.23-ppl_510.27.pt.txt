To Spend In Me? 

 
 You blame you another: 
 My free affairs, it was by a part of you. 
 I could smell would you together again. 
 After supper . . . . longing endlessly; of 
 me alone with the bicep. 
 
 How would you spend a year, her face 
 
 at sally foot colors, frequent 
 by damp hair as a feather 
 
 almost quick, falls. 
 
 Your curses have some music, carrying 
 the shiver of your hair.
