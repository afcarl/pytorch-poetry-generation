 
 If I walk down for my clumsy & entities: time 
 and something coughs when I misse on my life 
 as the rain comes will not save tales on the 
 hills and the father died I would come 
 to the waters that screams 
 and sped, I must still play the carcass 
 of dying spirit, 
 startled me up 
 over by the tables. 
 The windy silence boat whistles through the slanted 
 path of a mouth. A ghost of coins
