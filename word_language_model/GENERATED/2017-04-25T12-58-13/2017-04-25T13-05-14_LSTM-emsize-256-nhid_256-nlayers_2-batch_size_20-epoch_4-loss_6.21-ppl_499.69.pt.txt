 Not in search of ivory, 
 In the storms of the past, 
 Leaving the woodland water'd stunned 
 And the globes of granite, here have flown 
 In tremble and need, but none feels 
 To think of the Earth or the mother 
 Who made his hair offend a wrong, would get 
 But utter thought of a dazzle of heat to fly, 
 Much of the strummed earth, and praise his voice, 
 momma be stamp, by the stern text he goes along,
