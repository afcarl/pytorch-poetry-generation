Of The Landscape 

 My hallucinatory, in that shard of utterance; 
 In which I strove it and I remember 
 A film might have been from it, all 
 Will be wheeled to the revelry 
 
 Away from overshadowed to mattress 
 And also it acts a so-to-speak 
 A soul without a onsl stands. 
 
 
 
 when I am Anne and I 
 And stretch the hair with its legs near my feet indirections 
 And then they all spoke to me Bassinet.
