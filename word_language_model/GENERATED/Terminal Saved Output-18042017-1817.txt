Wavenet for Poem Generation.
Initializing.
Please wait.

Preparing to make 30 poems of 444 letters each.

Each poem is generated from a mathematical model of what poetry is.

The models were generated using a neural-net (Wavenet) 
in November 2016 in Hong Kong.

The poems are generated now in realtime.
