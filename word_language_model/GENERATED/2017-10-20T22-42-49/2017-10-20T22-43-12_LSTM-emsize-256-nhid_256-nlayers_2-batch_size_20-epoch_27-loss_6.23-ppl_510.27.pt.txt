Tas-T-O'S 1980 

 
 No mind uncensur'd, to missed. 
 So I called them thy fry, 
 I would agree to know what 
 I do no more. 
 
 Out of the throat, gazing side again 
 From threads to lung-sponges, and spread his neck. 
 Under a Panchos in opium, me. 
 
 Shot away from light to wing, 
 In which the Northern cry? 
 Mystery that Heaven might travel with the sky 
 Inside a hog so that waves 
 Have lain any more,
