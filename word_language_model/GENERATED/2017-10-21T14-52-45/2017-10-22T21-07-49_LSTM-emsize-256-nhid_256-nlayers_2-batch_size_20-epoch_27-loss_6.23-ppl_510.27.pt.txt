 Of Flap marks dire migrate. 
 
 Spring a man who has endless play? 
 He has a lazy Frown 
 To say as the sweet tassel of a hand. 
 
 How can the moon be clear, an eddy 
 Of comfort or a San proud, in viburnum-- 
 A suffused with caressing teeth, 
 But sound was a nigger 
 Full of clear vet's 
 Full of bamboo greens, 
 Naked and gold, a score of corn, 
 A creole with lustrous and a sheath,
