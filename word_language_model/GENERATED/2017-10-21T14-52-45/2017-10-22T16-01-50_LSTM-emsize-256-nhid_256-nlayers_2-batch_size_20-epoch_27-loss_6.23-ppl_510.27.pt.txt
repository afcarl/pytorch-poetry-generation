Wingsâ€” 

 The pale green menace of the headland 
 So don't now lift Mastered the current leaves 
 Of the wind. He says dive-bomb 
 The strangeness lies in her upper chest, 
 The way passes but not the fate of lucid bloom, 
 Above which she sits at, next morning air 
 For loathing, even though not non-ambition. 
 
 The mob once died and the fragmentary the gain'd 
 Has caught her pretty timbers and will grow 
 Beyond the sun's invisible light like scruple
