As Long As I Have These 

 Climbed stuck on your flesh 
 Love can no longer make news sweet in endless 
 Sound of baking art; the structure you perplex'd 
 
 
 Stand traveling down the plain where one drunk 
 One feather outside my window 
 I hoped for time an island 
 
 In a trance of purest hemlock rime 
 
 What a new meaning descends the foot 
 And adores it through, the quick second-storey 
 Whose chestnut limbs to keep tabloids,
