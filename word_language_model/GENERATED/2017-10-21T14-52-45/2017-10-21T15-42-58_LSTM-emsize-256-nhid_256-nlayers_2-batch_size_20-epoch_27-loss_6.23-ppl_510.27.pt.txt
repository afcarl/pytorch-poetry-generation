 
 From the river steed 
 Came the academy cold. 
 
 XXXIII 
 Never moving away? 
 
 XLI 
 Dark control, far in a dying day; 
 Where are the fishes and the cool, 
 The sun is cold, is soon to go. 
 
 II 
 
 From cloud the dale is shaken â€” 
 We pass the curtain from the south, 
 And float to sycamores and Spain 
 On thy thousand dripping purple flame, 
 Till snow exists while ever less fooled
