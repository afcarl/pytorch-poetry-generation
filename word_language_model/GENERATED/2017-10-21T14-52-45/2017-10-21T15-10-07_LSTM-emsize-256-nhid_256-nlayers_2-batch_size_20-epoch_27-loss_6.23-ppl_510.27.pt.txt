 
 As always as silent as a mudslide, 
 mountain-snow more miraculous than the few. 
 When the skeleton grove would be laid in rain, 
 Where the dead trees roared in; the tree chooses still, 
 And the rain sucks howling with the stars of things, 
 Like the poet's whirling wind with feet came: 
 Soft stars inherit them all. 
 
 Death, 
 Turn man to the testing pit-coal of God, 
 For him the god was as far-off, and a strange child,
