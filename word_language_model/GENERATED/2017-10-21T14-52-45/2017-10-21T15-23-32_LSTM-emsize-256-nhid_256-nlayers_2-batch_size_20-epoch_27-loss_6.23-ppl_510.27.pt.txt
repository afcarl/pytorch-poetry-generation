Black Gyptian And Sharkfins 

 Spends out Artemis, I've imagined 
 hundreds and Grand refuse Dorchester Blessed be 
 mannerless; Ending with Scent 
 
 
 
 
 
 Seventy like a Songs 
 
 
 When we Tiresias are gone, 
 Whatever we are, is lost, 
 How long the outer moon 
 Can flourish salt in heaven away, 
 When, as so close above the wings 
 Where him once lived, and now 
 
 Having suckled my own cold vest, 
 And then dead wakeful
