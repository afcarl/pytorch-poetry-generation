 The chased from my enemy: 
 The wrath song of the ferthyng tissues 
 To the Great River lad, 
 
 Their horns outstretched and pounded on with the 
 Fast flares of aff cotton imitating death, the 
 anthropomorphic meat of my own great-grandmother's self, I want 
 To keep tomatoes--week-old things must still be black 
 In every vagrant soul. 
 
 Before the leaves go around 
 In the narrow sea. 
 
 No one can hear the rolling wind, how 
 ensnares me
