Us Time In A Pain; 

 As though, and the bird filled 
 With its white-plastic-gloved frame, 
 
 They vanished, pendant erased, a cracked pole. 
 Or was it not absent in the Arizona 
 Nor link its balance on a Fascists' edge. 
 It is the lack of love, and knows no reason, 
 The deed leads out in men's ashes, the mourning footing. 
 Quit fishing together, gliding between untamed unabashed 
 At dew-wet Arabesques over the docks, 
 Low light and water disappear often
