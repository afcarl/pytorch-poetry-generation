Into The Onlooker? 

 Ain't you been sweet flags of blue disobedient commissariat 
 you rise and end me 
 And you have sane, pile you by death's own hands 
 Through the darkness on your filthy head piece gray 
 Wrapt on the railroad Street running melodies 
 In Van Kong rewrite at your parlor shadow 
 
 At the back door I kissed your arms larky 
 As a child, oh deformed me: 
 
 ~ 
 It was also a house, rustles in dust
