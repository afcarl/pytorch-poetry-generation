Alder Inn 

 Going up to the mountains 
 
 One have been born 
 On this grand avenue 
 A dust in flames 
 And a width of bread lions 
 enduring by a little press-ons 
 
 The name of our coffins. 
 It's confused the heart, everything 
 Of the fact and the medieval 
 gill blazes the empty blade 
 of broken chairs. 
 
 The boys with peaches 
 have died and will settle 
 past one middle-aged flower.
