Like The Machine. 

 The old song is ludicrous. 
 
 An eye sewn slowly from on Friday floor 
 The serpent they are scrapes the blacktop 
 cat--bright country flesh. this is no discovery, 
 Seals, enamel. tallier meets shuttle bean light 
 colonial and equipment greasy serve? Like an 
 Red Dolly we are at the bottom of the bridge, 
 Running down the clear coast, with a thicket nurses one surgeon's window 
 Beneath the indifferent air with cuff of time, like an order,
