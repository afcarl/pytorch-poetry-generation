 And I turned from my own heart 
 And quicker than music spoke 
 With the sun and awakened light. 
 
 God always brought him death, 
 Turned black and fine, 
 Clad by my Maiden's throat. 
 I will picture be. 
 
 And he will go through rain. 
 But he, for wreaths; 
 My thirst was mori-- 
 I made one thing a man 
 Who would pick up and scream. 
 So they imagine a film 
 He had driven a comfortless,
