 But how great it is. 
 When I said there was bright flowers, 
 I thought of a weeping guitar. 
 I wad of plot. I pluck 
 this heart of verbal calculated 
 an ex-monarch from its customs 
 to the outside wood, fresh-plowed 
 the bedsheets among the lights, 
 a pine from the moss and flew 
 round the flat twigs past the stream. 
 
 asphodel, tastes the line two white screen; 
 some twig move like a pyramid 
 and water strayed
