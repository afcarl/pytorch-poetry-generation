Saw You Passed 

 Across the autumn bars. 
 The air never told you how possible, 
 I could not tell fading by any one. 
 In where my feet beneath my veins 
 harpy-shrill eternal arrows 
 Were there before. 
 So many years I've said, 
 But what I know is too. 
 I use what I supposed, and I Unman 
 The way I'll respond to the end again, 
 To make love back, be it still floor 
 As April comes back to it.
