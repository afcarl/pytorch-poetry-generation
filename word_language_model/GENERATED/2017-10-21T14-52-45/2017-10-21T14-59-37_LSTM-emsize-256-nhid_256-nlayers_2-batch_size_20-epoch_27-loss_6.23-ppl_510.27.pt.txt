Bell. 

 Night morning, hatching at the ocean; 
 bright water, and the little mouse, soon ride 
 off again, breathing their Successe 
 without djinn in the freezer or the place 
 poets! 
 
 In living in these great houses 
 of a Highest swathed in air, 
 a footsteps came up at home, 
 walking a trail along the road 
 that rises and falling down again, 
 or the sky hanger so floating in the lobby 
 to follow the soul on this bed
