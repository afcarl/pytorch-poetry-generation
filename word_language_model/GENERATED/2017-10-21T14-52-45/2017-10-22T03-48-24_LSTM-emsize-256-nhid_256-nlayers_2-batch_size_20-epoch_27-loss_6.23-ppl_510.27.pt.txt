Terrestrial Nicest Days, 

 perhaps,-- save a, or coward, no doubt of yet, 
 How frugal a rodeo that is none of him. 
 How can I proceed now. What is the disaster.

 Of our own calm sense, which will never seem too young, 
 Except on day alone you admire you and I know you drink. 
 It is a potpourri of bloom that was big. 
 
 It's the way you want, the effect of Eliot
