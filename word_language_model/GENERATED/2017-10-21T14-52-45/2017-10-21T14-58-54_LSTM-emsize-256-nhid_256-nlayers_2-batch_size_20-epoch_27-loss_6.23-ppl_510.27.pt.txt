From The Wall, 

 
 man-root, I see its sharp dred lent; 
 Else were morgue with bent bags unnaturally gage, 
 Rise, flye, warms all the dances 
 effortless years of time! the Arabs. 
 When the wind ended still, turn a solar supply 
 Of art; the law of Jews, the donkey inside the Love-lacking 
 
 * 
 
 In tomatoes and sound go home and part the moon. 
 You blast the threads over the house with that fun, 
 And I sing something
