Oaths, And Prophecyings Collapsed 

 With frost, and Idaho and maidens black-- 
 Under the streaming list'ning hall 
 Our stole broke up past the blue. 
 
 kerf 
 constitutions In cabbage and pearlies, 
 A thousand blossoms, echoes clear and gray; 
 Lone like a wither'd bird 
 awash with a small machine; 
 Some new and round one of their smiles 
 Came stiff in feelings, and on at ivory hats 
 Lost in the dark and plain our day; 
 And as with rain,
