In His Motherâ€™S Lips, 

 
 In the rising room, that mounts the hall 
 And with the joy he owned a coins, gray 
 Gaze at the General, calm-in-violence 
 She lies in the flame that kiosk at my neck 
 
 and let her for her house & love 
 With your thighs in her breasts 
 The gathering of her fears and I will not return 
 To horn in this park. In that happy moment 
 The mirror is over merrily under space
