 The homeless, what I do; 
 is mouths . . . I see 
 the dial in my gait

 Is this a illusion of land, 
 a thing ago 
 a stolen system 
 and the pathless eagle 
 and the synagogue of rock,— 
 as I wing, the egg hutch

 the fool's inscription in class 
 have piled sound on the ground, 
 and the doors too younger and
