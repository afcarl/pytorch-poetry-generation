Grief, 

 Here is destroyes in ways he is tideless 
 On the waveless hills, throws 
 
 The lamp here: he adored its gongs 
 
 Of a love utterance. In its Amnon's 
 My house is low; plies one 
 machine few absinthes. A hand stuck in orange. 
 The cord Atropos to my head.

 II. Help see reversed the California tension the water 
 & bearing you tear we on it, 
 where what is where nothing drives it
