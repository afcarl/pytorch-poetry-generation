It Anything But Larger Earn'D. 

 
 The girls standing backwards at our feet and spackle, 
 They stopped, they are the affinity 
 but no one else but failed us to lie 
 taboret? 
 Somewhere, for assuming 
 a new unknown life they look 
 
 because it is a lonesome time, 
 Perhaps the friend will be our mother 
 That her many a notion of Hut, 
 She never lingered in the money 
 Filled and untenable in the dark tree 
 solid-- and
