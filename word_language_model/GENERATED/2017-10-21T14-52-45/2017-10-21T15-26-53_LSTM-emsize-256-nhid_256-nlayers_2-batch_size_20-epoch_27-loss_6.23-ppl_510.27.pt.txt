A Dirt Mate. 

 And I left him like a fatalistic boy 
 raised his tongue. 
 He was really cut along the fence 
 broad birds' tile in the house 
 with his showgirls of satin, 
 a pot of grease and a table 
 and a furry mouth 
 hissing, King Home 
 leads to a villain, 
 his uncle played a dozen other 
 two street before twelve years, 
 turning up to the aisle 
 that shirt 
 
 like just stood 
 through
