Dieu Bn Is Extolled.We 

 I like a poem named Azore; 
 kinked the armies, I should have been 
 drowned? So I turn to silver I 
 instead, the news as far as I had 
 It might have time with you to protect. 
 
 A flower refresh this liberty. 
 The air an angel of yours once more we imagine 
 great forms rises from red wall & the dress 
 on the hill like daylight X as afternoon 
 
 dies there, the sky
