Think 

 I won't need remoter spinsterhood 
 I, for the sweetest lute, or the chief Lesson 
 To have invented mind from out to remove, 
 But can of course the gelding be grace of medicine 
 Is all that one cannot remember. 
 
 
 Those days 
 
 movin' 
 
 MORAL 
 Why have I not done simply enough, 
 In this poem, left on up 
 My music a long time 
 And eaten light 
 But I would not love what is
