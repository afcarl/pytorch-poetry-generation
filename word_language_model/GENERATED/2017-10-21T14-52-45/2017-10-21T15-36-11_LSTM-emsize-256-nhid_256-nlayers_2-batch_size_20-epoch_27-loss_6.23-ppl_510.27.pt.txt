Justification 

 
 Just welcome here though I dream—and have some pity to work, 
 I see you, these mornings ago that I've made you know 
 When I went in with you in silence and there in the bed and said 
 Neither erotic nor noisy hurt again" 
 so you couldn’t do it, 
 but once more you huddled 
 in a pattern among us 
 In crude alleys, 
 heroes tilt their heads.
