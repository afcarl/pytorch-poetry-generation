For The Dogâ€™S Wood 

 Is but two pricey in gin. 
 Come buy, tremble, I cried, 
 Above this birds, being gone sword-knots kill me. . . . 
 Leaves the blood like a shipwreck, 
 And a maze 
 That utters silences is given 
 Before the law of need: 
 
 Is to be coming perfectly 
 Through free and little lands 
 Like sand, dwarfed the bricklayer. 
 Now in the end of it time I be, 
 That I could no longer be
