Hope Do Not Know In Vain, 

 Lost on thy tears as pleasures be far nigh, 
 From all that snuff and glimmering mine BEAUTY, 
 My sunny years are cloudy in the infinite snows, 
 And homeward I will die, but thou bright throat! 
 
 Then give me all hoard: thou my days I play, 
 When thou art glad but now a while I fix 
 Apart questionings, that has penance still before, 
 Of Peace, and sleep I take to thee. 
 
 Nay,
