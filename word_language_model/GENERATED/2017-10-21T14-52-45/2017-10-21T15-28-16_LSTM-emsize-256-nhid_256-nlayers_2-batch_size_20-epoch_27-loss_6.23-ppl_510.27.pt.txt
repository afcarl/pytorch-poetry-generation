Funereal Beam-Ends 

 In Scythia and deep current villages 
 California at spared. a.m., and wanderer," 
 I learned two days my name to restrain 
 
 such a morning of the two days-- 
 
 someone else the day and thy sighs 
 When the young, and the nail is powerful 
 
 And the down-turn of me night here; 
 What is left for sleep and bird 
 It is the darker woman under the ice. 
 But on a highway there am ashen peach
