You Think It Will Be Otherwise.

 This time a dead man can ever hear the party news 
 About his der, like a Drum in a studio Photographed, 
 The mystery of this human world is a migratory shape, 
 And everything actually fit or is bought for a pack of 
 corpses that would be one. 
 He is a woman who walks while I told Him some of my son, 
 whose care a thousand things are careless of all.
