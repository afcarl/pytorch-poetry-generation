 I do not know this god 
 Sitting down 
 Behind these nether, 
 They are mine with the beloved 
 Living 
 Death, have written 
 No place for myself 
 In my burning life 
 Once up the rainbow's main cool 
 part of the heart. Sometimes 
 my dim doubt go and Narcissus 
 made me devoted by to recall 
 your family's intrusion ready to wrap my 
 nose, bent knots of half- 
 ticket to toe in the eye dress;
