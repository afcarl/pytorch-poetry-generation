 In the tattoo in front of the fire 
 Mornings to the little mountain home 
 When the body of sleeping warm. The lines 
 Of the hawk in one another's version 
 
 Is this to my ear and this of a smiling treasure 
 In the black direction of those others, 
 demarcation, nothing, tilting slabs 
 They sleep here, I hug the one that creates me again 
 And for your Bard is shame. Later, top! 
 Turn the sun, there you will keep
