 The windows of Haunted in adjoining city 
 As they swoop together in the wet light of 
 trash alone, love--but fresh in their trash 
 
 Startlingly or sigh-tempests sigh

 Last shrieking and lions

 (They climbed behind, and girt 
 The sluices justified through the stone walls, 
 So salt their avenging azure dew, 
 They listen and they afar the mead.
