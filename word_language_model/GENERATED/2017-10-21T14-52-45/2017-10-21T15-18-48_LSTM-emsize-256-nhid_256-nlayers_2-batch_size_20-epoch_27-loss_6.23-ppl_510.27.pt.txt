And Does 

 run out, watch in me Sir, let him 
 Tell to walk them; folded up the weather, Untill 
 Red horned boughs, 
 giant pilgrims in the horizon, 
 
 Pict, sleeping brutes 
 under these walls. 
 At last the prairie chords 
 of today dead and kind, 
 my daughter already humped 
 in the gloaming; all seasons and ever 
 wholly, 
 which the brake of his broken eyes 
 has a single lawn, a still stone 
 will not resist flesh
