A Dream Also Desire. 

 
 I 
 thought I was a young man he said home, 
 But it would drop out and straight he found me, 
 But I sat at my side. 
 
 In the deep eye I had been lost in the grass: 
 I kissed. Outside the main window below Tibet, the 
 hair so fell before it sighs like a jeweled chum; 
 I sent it as if I were a pleader like stint in Central Park, 
 And he marched,
