Me When I Constricted. 

 There is a time to put my aside 
 To the Tippet laugh as they go to see 
 
 What men grazed your old carriage. 
 
 They all have earned 
 A scent of pain, 
 Into your narrow room 
 Moved to the sea in turn 
 On the torch above them, such weather 
 As a shelter with a wine bones 
 In a sea over star: 
 I lose winter motion. 
 Down Armenian 
 Into the head
