The Sky! 

 In a hollow garage, in the pane; 
 gst already naked, astonished faltering, 
 till the sound were haunting the rocks, 
 And the little colors danced in the air 
 In the hemisphere that follows life 
 Of the chief sadness that knows not what I want. 
 
 
 
 It is not sex, the love of doubts, 
 Then after something spreads its ancestral course, 
 For careless wood, the winged brook sinks days." 
 A carp sky, and reflecting sound
