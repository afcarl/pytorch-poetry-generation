 
 Did you come secure, 
 You two suffered your crank pose. 
 Her hair can never snatch her out 
 By a mini-mart. of piracy. 
 Her hair is a limb, I am worth 
 Pull away the world with want. 
 
 Beyond the apple and my bed is gone 
 And dumped thousands of weeping flowers 
 Search through me corruptible and lies. 
 I have seen up my love in every yellow lute. 
 There's no photograph 
 Your mind or me.
