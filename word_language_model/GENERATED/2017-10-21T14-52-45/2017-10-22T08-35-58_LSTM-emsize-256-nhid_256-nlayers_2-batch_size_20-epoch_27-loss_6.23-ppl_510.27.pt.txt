Beyond The Far Stream; 

 Half the sun and water roaming as mine. 
 
 As the West clatters into the west, 
 And from the end of Fall, momentary slowly. 
 I was alarmed. I got back on time, 
 And I alone came to all spere 
 
 And everyone who uses my race have. 
 I want you to have been a howl. 
 It was, and an office would say 
 waiting/counting Washington, I must take a nineteen. 
 Odd luck I can't bring
