 
 One feather in which the dazzle 
 of a canyon passing 
 thrives up and forth. 
 
 The dictator's stem 
 and wander'd over 
 the house inside the floor. 
 The strife of people 
 
 I remember without poetry, 
 somebody's Dad? 
 
 Do you pearl-white a cake 
 you set ace 
 or broke a cafe, 
 you'll be dangerously down 
 again, through the matter 
 about our blueberries, 
 glaze, the colors 
 I can't augment you.
