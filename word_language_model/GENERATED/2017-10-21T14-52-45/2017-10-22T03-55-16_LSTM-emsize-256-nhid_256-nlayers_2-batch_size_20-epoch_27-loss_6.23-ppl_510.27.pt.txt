... 

 stream,and I have to give, 
 To be you artless, 
 Bread, youngest gnaw, too rare 
 You don't night--press have the store 
 Your heart fit our sense my love you think. 
 My soul is Soiled so I raise 
 My fingers and the floor, and trying 
 To wear my sons; for it is not with no voice 
 And death might change me as one boat inherits 
 sanding life off, or the dog behind the grass 
 Full of the green
