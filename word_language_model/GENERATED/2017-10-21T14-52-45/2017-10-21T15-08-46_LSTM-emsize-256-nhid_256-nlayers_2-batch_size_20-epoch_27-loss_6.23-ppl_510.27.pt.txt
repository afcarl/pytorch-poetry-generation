Hearingsâ€”Rumsfeld, Grouped, Of The Year; 

 There is nothing but the young, the wound: 
 The Persians with the hireling and the feed 
 
 Of gales "they're us: The dust neat-stepping 
 
 "And saying, there are evil 25-below, 
 I ungracious; even so many forgotten 
 As power entering the Story of 
 The hills in endless waters sing. 
 
 The cats swarm on the firefly 
 
 As they pull forming arms in the summer, 
 
 The sweating captain singing by the rooftops
