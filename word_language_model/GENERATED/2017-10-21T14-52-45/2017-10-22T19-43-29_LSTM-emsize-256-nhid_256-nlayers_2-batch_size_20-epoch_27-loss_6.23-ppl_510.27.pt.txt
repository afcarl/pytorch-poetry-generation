 Broken base. A carmine forest, 
 spread out in the sky, stars at evening 
 and saw me alive as I lay in our tears. 
 We always went out looking away beneath 
 the pane at the edge of the dark almost throat, 
 changeling: roadside drain. To such a Dove, 
 the kite having to be back. 
 
 Women watched tonight sport and follow'd 
 if she had worn a lifetime like corn 
 on the shelf for the instruments
