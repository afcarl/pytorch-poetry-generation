The Black Snows 

 Were on their side. 
 
 mercy-- 
 The wind strip through the sky, 
 Taut with unkind. 
 
 They shout in hardens? 
 
 Singing hire pink 
 eucalypti alive 
 
 To the soil 
 
 Round their lips blue, 
 Their froth are blue, 
 Whose floors are wild 
 Walking toward the night? 
 
 And that one has made 
 A living fly, 
 surprising because 
 
 The silent world will move, 
 Else has the blackness
