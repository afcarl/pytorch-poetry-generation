Till I Suppose, 

 So I can sit on the watery deck, 
 And look down from my wet knee 
 And swallow thee by the sea and rain 
 To the calm of summer I am the body 
 desert/ (Space pshed 
 Rain black, and my roots begin 
 The white rows of jaguar rides you out; 
 
 In the spring you have seen my father no longer 
 A girl trod, 
 A floating roaring 
 The girl 
 Who I am
