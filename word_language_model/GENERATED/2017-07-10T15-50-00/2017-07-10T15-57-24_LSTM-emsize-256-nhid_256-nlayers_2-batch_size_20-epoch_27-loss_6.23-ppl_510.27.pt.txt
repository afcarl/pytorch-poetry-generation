Out Of The Water, 

 Over the lane, while the anchors 
 gefrge, itself with force of gulls 
 Drury milky meats 
 Of cornrows on the bay sky 
 hedges softly by a Sagittarian bag 
 Each meteors the back of backs so hungry 
 As when he got in my limit. 
 
 Where the crowing stinging an arch 
 Had you settled after winter by 
 And I would travel anymore 
 The different sentence from the dead 
 In Jane source-book 
 And scars?
