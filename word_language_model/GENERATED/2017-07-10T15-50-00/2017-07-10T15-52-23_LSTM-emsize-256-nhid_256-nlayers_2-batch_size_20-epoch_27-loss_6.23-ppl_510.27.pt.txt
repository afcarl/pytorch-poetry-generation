All The Time You Can; 

 At least you were marred and declines 
 In speech and old Foot that learner 
 The Kitchener that struck love. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Bloody Man 
 
 
 Her mind pouty as it moves 
 Rests and torn it from the sky, 
 It floats out our soul's martinis 
 And light with tears we came 
 To moved across the Kings 'me'â€”one 
 In route, they were OToole 
 Of random March, the monolith
