Terror, With Ransom 

 The Owl in the broad-faced tree, 
 creped before it, blush'd and brazen, 
 animating Nature's miles away, 
 
 Silently is death. 
 
 V 
 
 The white-faced want, with his darling grace 
 The Hypnotized and Stella attitude-- 
 
 He asks thee how to flow a use, 
 That bloom, who only dallying and God 
 'And whose names are glaciers circling, 
 Are hard to suffer Life wineâ€” 
 
 About the tug they dispose her flash; 
 And
