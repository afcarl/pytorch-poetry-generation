 
 
 
 
 
 At Christmas I 
 
 
 I never passed this country from the porch 
 Where I can sit and walk and roar and prayed, 
 It cuts and tumble down the carnival pool 
 Always from cars, the sirens say, 
 A nobler clime, this heavy ocean's palm, 
 That beckons and betray itself with pleasant words, 
 And all my senses at my Lawdie, let it go. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Loves Shout experienc'd Sonnet of Big Gaol
