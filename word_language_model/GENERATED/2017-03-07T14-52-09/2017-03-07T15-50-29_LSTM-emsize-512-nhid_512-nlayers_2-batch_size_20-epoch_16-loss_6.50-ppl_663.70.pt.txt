Oleg'S 

 Shelby les amour, for the noon 
 clippers to the chassis of inarticulate Easter 
 To the self-esteem. 
 Under the Congo government used 
 Through the shoes of that damned 
 Crush base head, as she mightest coat, burns, Elanor 
 singing the tea of comb and bided the metaphor, 
 But because she was sure she could do. 
 It was the dream that all 
 Was armed all creatures 
 Many thoughts of one year. 
 
 This is the time 
 And
