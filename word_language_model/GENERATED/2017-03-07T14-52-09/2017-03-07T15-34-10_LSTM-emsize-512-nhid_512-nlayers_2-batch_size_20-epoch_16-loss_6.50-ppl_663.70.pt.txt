And Join In The Trip. 

 
 How sad and casual were the sea, 
 Here come hard around this weary scene 
 
 To feel the life in its hour and want gazing. 
 
 What if a scarf should be no more. 
 
 No wonder then, no note even for us. 
 The hosts of coons and Eat. 
 The sickness of the stirs. 
 Lose an answer for the reasonable heart, 
 Lie about as they do to go. 
 You'd rather know this,
