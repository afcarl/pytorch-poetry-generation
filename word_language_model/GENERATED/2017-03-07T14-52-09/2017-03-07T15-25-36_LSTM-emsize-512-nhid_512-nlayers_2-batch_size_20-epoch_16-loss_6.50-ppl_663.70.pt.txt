Outbreak, Real In This Place. 

 
 Let us stay when we let we go, 
 why it was true that she was already dead 
 To be happy stabbed in grace-- 
 honest Muse, honks: he's saild for dreams: 
 rely in irony.

 Is this what I stated of these, by which 
 You're the weather: they talk of it 
 and tied to the Heights; 
 acting by the Dean 
 though everything comes out in the desert, 
 night bends flying,
