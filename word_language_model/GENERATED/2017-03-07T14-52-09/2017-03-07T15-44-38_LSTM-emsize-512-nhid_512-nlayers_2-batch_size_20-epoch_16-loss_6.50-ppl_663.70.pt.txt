I Have Been A Dream. 

 That matter that I don't know the white wolves 
 that have kept their eyes fluctuate in mouth waiting for me. 
 
 Then light publishers? and beds of lovers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sonnet 
 
 
 I have not immediately painted my arms beating 
 when I came to sit holding the moon, 
 I was going the way they stacked. 
 
 And at last on the forty days make going down. 
 
 Dance, exoneration working
