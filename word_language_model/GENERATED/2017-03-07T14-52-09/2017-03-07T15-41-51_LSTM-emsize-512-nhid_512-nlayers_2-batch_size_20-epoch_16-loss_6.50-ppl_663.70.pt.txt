And Death, 

 and they think the years were slump made 
 for a shadow, the dead: because that surely I could be 
 part of my loins of section 
 of the half-day cut, the simple treasure 
 whose hands are falling on my arm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 How She brought Over with Birds fell into light, 
 
 
 15] sixpence, 
 
 A whole bridge. Grass 
 
 Praise now. Where the space is 
 
 mistaken for the 
 
 reeds
