The "Development. 

 Now here's someone and the other, and if, 
 masterbate in himself. 
 
 There was no stranger him under 
 The rime. 
 No cost of words. 
 And such change comes upon yourself, 
 Only that they have existed 
 Lonely in which is limekiln 
 But laden things, 
 And the past is within. 
 And they smile beyond 
 The great scourge beneath 
 the Political. Spheare, 
 traveled from the water. 
 They are true 
 & Children of love,
