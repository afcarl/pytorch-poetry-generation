 My love wired. but her loose eye 
 Is her Thessander, manifold across 
 an eternity of used. 
 I never walked the window. 
 drudging blood. Their ass, 
 she preferred her study 
 was washed, even the one 
 for such a long time of 
 the times when you act 
 in a desperate bitch 
 I'm awake again 
 on the third edge of you, 
 to someone as you with another 
 woman
