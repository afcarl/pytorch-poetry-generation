 At last I vowed to rescue 
 All that reach of poems line 
 At the ratios. for three cents a green vapor, 
 But I proteins, its delicate stink. These are the Rennie 
 Those kind of beauty, then the slain on me still-- 
 Gunnery cinema in order sophistry, 
 Showing a wonderful speech with an grandfather 
 In which an act of becoming a sex. 
 Six distinct Deliver a fine flat box
