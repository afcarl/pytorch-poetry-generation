As I Guess, 

 Nor factors, nor myself I wait 
 In no dream of, then seems, not Reign 
 To abrupt vapours, or earth may harbour down. 
 uxorious difference for menagerie! 
 Nor know I pine nor rise or grin here? 
 See, dearie! beloved, are drunken and pure, 
 See, I 'ave hear the flowers of the live sidewalks, 
 From west to north, to mine again; 
 I'll follow wealth to peace, imposter; and dwell 
 About the gree, and in someone's bliss;
