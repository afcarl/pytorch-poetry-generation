Down Before Me Comes, 

 eternize grown fat and climbs with me: 
 I have sat on the mirror. 
 
 All in my shifting leagues he grasps 
 If they Exprest: they are all 
 And calculation, now, too, they revealed 
 Are but measured yet. 
 
 I'm making out of the year 
 I do my own great games 
 And my old spirit gotten now. Had apricot 
 With him no more why we hated too. 
 
 You'll have no propriety. You stand
