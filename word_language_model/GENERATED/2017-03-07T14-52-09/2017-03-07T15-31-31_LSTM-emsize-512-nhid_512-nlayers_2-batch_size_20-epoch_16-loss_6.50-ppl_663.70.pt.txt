Tartars Supplicating 

 by a Nation, with two hands going thin 
 down voyage where someone burned a threne 
 and then brisk bodies longed to surprise 
 
 the rank mass, the animals. 
 
 And maybe a tablecloth, the Peter Ray awoke 
 behind all his two shop, 
 tangled slightly window, 
 angled with orange birds, and sticky 
 poisonous shells and flanks 
 of the ground! 
 The cathedral start, with spackle of pines, 
 took out and gathered the fruit onto his back.
