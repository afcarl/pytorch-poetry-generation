Quicken The Morning'S Kitchen 

 (in it is less, birds go by 
 their whitening beaks under the stained skin. 
 
 The ice leaves down, the map of place, 
 heads of Lady rusting in grapes 
 hanging like nectarous jungle leaves 
 where the dry leaves, felled by wild flame 
 away. 
 
 And I hope I was here, the sun 
 adjusting as it rises up to the floor, 
 and I passed over the glass in my boots, 
 chuckered like a deer
