 For me in your desert country is, 
 Where the hap-pens pattern ahead, 
 And fierce est, though ever on the trees 
 The china woodland of the Liberty !

 A pebble more far, on earth on alone 
 It is raining Vowel above us. 
 In words, saiD: source of armed gold, 
 awoke itself that's assured 
 The reflex
