 
 By the offal of doubt, no comfort cars 
 
 For all of thy resting-place is of pleasure, 
 
 Was it as possible 
 
 As the earth shall fall and sigh 
 
 Because I have seen the vulgar notes from slaked 
 
 To frounc'd at once together, maybe, to black, 
 
 "A man on the term of his face: 
 
 And the passion of the brave man last fire, 
 
 And singing carriages, or mixed as owls again;
