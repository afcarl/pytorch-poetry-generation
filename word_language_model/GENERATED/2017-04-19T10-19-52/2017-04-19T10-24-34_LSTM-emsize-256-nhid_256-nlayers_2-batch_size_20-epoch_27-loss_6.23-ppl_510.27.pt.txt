Plates-Soon-Empty 

 Nor at Fritz, 
 Does more back! 
 
 If the old thing was not Trooper 
 in the Creatan's dreadful paths. 
 
 
 
 
 Four on a church 
 altar looped to skin of 
 
 Light glare to a light that stream aim! 
 
 Be cold, ribs cold, young gray wet hands in 
 of gore, 
 
 He realizes yes but Dump myself 
 From the drainpipes, the quick stallions of absence 
 Blows out of all living ranks.
