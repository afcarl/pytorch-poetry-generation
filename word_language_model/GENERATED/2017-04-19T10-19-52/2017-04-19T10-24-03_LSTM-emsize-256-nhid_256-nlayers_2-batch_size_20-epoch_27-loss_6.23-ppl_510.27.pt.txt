Hands 

 And here, before you do require 
 And never yearn yourself, (it lies too 
 Like a man places for some smirker, 
 
 They'll go to bed, as many themes 
 Called up their solitude. 
 
 In the cool wind, 
 You knelt in a shrouds of stars, 
 
 Before me. 
 
 * 
 
 The astronaut, of money isn't the thing! 
 I must go as if you were more garden 
 shaking at your feet and went out again,
