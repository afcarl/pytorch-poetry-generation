Only Splayed On Black 

 ceiling in a sentry, Sheepe, as 
 
 drip of shadows. For any sadness breaks. 
 The first time they stopped then fed empty hands held by them. 
 
 My father cried on all that day wind on sea cuts through my stick. 
 a scream like foam--surgeons interior to the wellhead, trying to sing. 
 
 
 
 1 
 
 I shall think it upturn'd on the ancient wedding, 
 In the hot circle of a most dusky bed,
