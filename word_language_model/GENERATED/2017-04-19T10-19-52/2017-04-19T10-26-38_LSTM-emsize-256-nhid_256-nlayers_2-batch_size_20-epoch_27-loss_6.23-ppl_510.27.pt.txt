Heavens, 

 One by one trembling to look 
 And set them out to earth in air to control on the lowly 
 stage, from the midst of a moll; chords 
 
 
 I lean 
 In chains that take acquire in solitude, 
 With the huge eye for me as the clef were high 
 So black or confines of the jaws of Monday 
 He will remember when the half-moon does be cold. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Caelica Sleep, Many
