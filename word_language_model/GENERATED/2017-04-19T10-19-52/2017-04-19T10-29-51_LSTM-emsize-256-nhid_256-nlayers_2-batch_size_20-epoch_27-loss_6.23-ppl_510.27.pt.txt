 its bark Eros, sometimes bright 
 as grass beauty .7%. 
 or from far, all giggles, 
 
 missing his beloved is misunderstanding? 
 They may have seen the birds say, or that tiny slouching. 
 gaily turning, & all lit up the telescope 
 
 as though a little deity played in the quick 
 interiority-- would sell some devotion 
 which they're only an ashtray. 
 But the next time they go on. 
 They were back. Always more: 
 Dragging hot curses
