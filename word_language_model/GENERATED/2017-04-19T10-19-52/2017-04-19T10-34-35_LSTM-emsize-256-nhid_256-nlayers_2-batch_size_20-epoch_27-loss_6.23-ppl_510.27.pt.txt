The Stone'S Of It 

 And open and coming inside to earth, 
 oferflat, from companions, welters across dawn. 
 I will concentrate with what light is not, 
 I read the corpses of many marvels 
 To be frightened of the hard mesh: 
 phasing with mine averse long ago 
 Who, helpless as the soul. 
 
 Whole leaves and trees in poetic dreams, 
 Torn by forgetfulness, 
 Leaving, as they pass 
 Warm light alters 
 In untidy rings; 
 Behold, a heart nobody
