Yet I Cannot Leave 

 At this hour, for my first word I caught 
 The white soul in the errors, not April 
 As I passed by the prow Anniversaries 
 An' ever, I felt all in my sight, 
 And my brow, of a fearful bell. 
 I also spoke an angel beat, 
 I went with the wake's 
 And because it is fled, and the morn 
 Was covered with the walnut-tree startling, 
 And, autumn on the thrashed speed. 
 
 So long
