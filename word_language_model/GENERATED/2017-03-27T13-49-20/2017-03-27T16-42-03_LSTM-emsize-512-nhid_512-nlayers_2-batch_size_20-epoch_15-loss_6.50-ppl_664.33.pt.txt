And Gives Thanks 

 To keep less distance, and than of our times. 
 Is it nice to play. 
 
 While variation sleeping, climbing 
 On the seashore of Marblehead! 
 
 The wind falls into light and breath; 
 I hear that bird of mist broke by. 
 A sad bird hath a law-suit. 
 I swim outside, like a mouse 
 Who labored lightly through the frosty clime 
 
 Now after the stillness of the storm, 
 
 Or I've gone on the hill,
