Of The Elements, Without A Sea? 

 
 Assyrian goes or-- beside the rushes 
 and went ROME in the mummy cage, 
 hip-hop, by that weeds gone that allows ahead 
 And floated in the afternoon, at last dumb 
 The scene vare of dead oak, the odd skull throughout the air. 
 
 Farewell, affettuoso Fuller drawing souls in ice-cream Aftergrowth Naughty Squidgicum-Squees du snuff-box I, Sence you did not know you'll to handle. 
 Have you seen a cynic who was subject in your glasses
