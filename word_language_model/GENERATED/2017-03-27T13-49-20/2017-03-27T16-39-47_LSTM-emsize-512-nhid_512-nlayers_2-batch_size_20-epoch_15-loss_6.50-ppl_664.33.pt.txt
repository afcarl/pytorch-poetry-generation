The Fact 

 bark.' my existence and my poems 
 Leave them the union, the first for all 
 My King: All of an animal's life has been 
 Too soon.

 The illness is getting hereditarie, 
 age; the house face-picturing, passing 
 
 Like in that thrones of mine own story, 
 
 Thus, lily-cradled: worn with network's 
 To death. 
 It's Vision-were it should come 
 Even alone, though twenty or three, 
 
 It is a part of years.
