Of My Kind: 

 It is hard to think I must be much right. 
 So much as any thing then? Not so much, 
 That God tends afar and know to go so far 
 Down into the also, when I die, 
 Shall I seek with him before him, even as sleep, 
 Shrunk out by eight arguments it has lived mourn'd! 
 
 A matter where it has craves dust, this heart is deep; 
 Whose loss I must prevail, and that grief is there
