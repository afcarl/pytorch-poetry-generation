Unless They Linger, 

 That millions of people who have remained 
 He Styx, and threw his linen wings 
 Round a nervous pavements and then 
 seedpod missionary. 
 
 He started upward, as he survived, 
 to guide him, B his steel-trap nose, 
 His poets, finger on the shadows. 
 
 In time he reads in a brave year 
 That is then easily different. 
 
 We cannot trust that love-lament, 
 And prayed exceeding much. 
 
 Only we stopped scared point;
