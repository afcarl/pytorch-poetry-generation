Sake: 

 My palms are open half-robotic 
 but not a cup in offered. 
 But I want the grass-leaves to eat. 
 Still, I lose my time a song. 
 citron voices between your lips 
 like windows I suppose, 
 I slept with my Last mind, 
 I lose my jobs, 
 accept the sea, 
 and take off my life? 
 You, too, I will not 
 need what fare in court, 
 I left, a patients of ALL 
 poems of the two played
