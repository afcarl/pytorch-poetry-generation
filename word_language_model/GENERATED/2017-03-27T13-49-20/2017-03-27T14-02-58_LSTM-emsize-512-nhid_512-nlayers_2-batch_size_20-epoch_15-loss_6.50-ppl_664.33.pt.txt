 PART 4 
 
 Wind is grinding on clapboard ignorance 
 and preserved, of garden-wall; 
 Where you have forgotten a ring 
 a hundred miles away 
 like women in bricks 
 
 Or you, form: 
 in the New aria 
 with a liver of eighteenth-century horse 
 and with Proserpina I am carried back 
 in the memory of Paris, 
 
 & each time in the parlor 
 in November el- All months. 
 She looks 
 at the Joes sound.
