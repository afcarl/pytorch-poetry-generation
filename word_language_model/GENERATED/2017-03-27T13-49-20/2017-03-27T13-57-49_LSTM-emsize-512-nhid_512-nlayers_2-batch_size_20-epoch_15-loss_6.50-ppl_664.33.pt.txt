Heaven, 

 allowed of knowledge, a still star 
 
 Look with its vase 
 rounder, multilayered 
 Seeking the Soul, sweet and the 
 Wooing 
 
 First-rate to throw 
 week--& Without coin 
 But in 
 But whether not temple-gates 
 Or panicle 
 Among Flavor Rosenbaum 
 Of ELUCESCEBAT bedfellow, 
 Let Trend, asklent & piston halls, 
 
 
 
 
 
 Driving through 
 
 
 The ceremony of the Cavanagh 
 A thirsty outline streame on his brow 
 rides hailstones
