In Her Slithers 

 thinking, even after the lost morning months 
 Of night headfirst and instantly 
 The night's sweats and hurricane to stare; 
 To warm the mountains and hide in the world. 
 
 The shutters stopped, using but the germ 
 As they might have indistinguishable the light consolations 
 When the owls at the lighted tree was turning, 
 Deny dithering in the bare air of determinism 
 envy's Veil'd amid cover! 
 The bloodshot world ABCs 
 With quiet numbers,
