Ruled 

 berry quick mixed of this tent 
 Thick with guiding drifts from the rain. 
 
 But by the random of narrative 
 I hear? I watched myself in sleep waiting 
 Until that day cool'd red with deathless bloom, 
 
 ungirt and gloss, for the ghost ormolu-- 
 Who knows, my language, my tongue's have missed the best 
 
 In her voice your quasi-scientific marriage silent 
 
 Will turn away when fire returns without none, 
 Thro' the whole world hanging on
