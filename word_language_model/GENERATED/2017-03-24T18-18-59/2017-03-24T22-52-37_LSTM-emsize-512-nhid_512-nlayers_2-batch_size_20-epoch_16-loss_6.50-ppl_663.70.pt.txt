Hologram When I Cry. 

 But what Sacred powders the smoldering soul 
 Glanced on the streams before his eyes are heard. 
 
 Each tonite he carries the wheel to see it dies. 
 The Arimaspian, will be no matter where we are, 
 If we draw or set on myriads on their Imbellisht, 
 
 St. John of the chestnut and where there is a fair blood manufactories. 
 What Jonson might be; cheekes, each that each one has much gathered, 
 Somehow, a white trail
