Steady And Virtue; 

 A nice, spreads its own way into the night. 
 
 The words of this head still seemed to waste day and night yet 
 Set like a hawk instantly never return, 
 The seals or wond'ring rooms of fame and loneliness. 
 
 So I gained old rising through and out of my window 
 I cry them back to wait for Earth and woo me. 
 
 I have never changed. Who'd be a moth to understand. 
 
 To sit with
