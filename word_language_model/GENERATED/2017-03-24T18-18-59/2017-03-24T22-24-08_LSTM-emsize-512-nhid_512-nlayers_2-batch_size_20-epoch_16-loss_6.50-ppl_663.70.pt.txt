The Gates O' Our Imagination, 

 Spinosissimus and seventeen by drop, quickest by glimpse of 
 Writ when at last the noise takes in the shape. 
 
 Are you left the poems of men with their wars, move with eyes full of skulls, 
 And as they lay around their low hand's led by the snack door-- 
 I was under a field of lead and thaw a deserted to work, 
 And it was foolish and close, and I suffered only the strength of a city.
