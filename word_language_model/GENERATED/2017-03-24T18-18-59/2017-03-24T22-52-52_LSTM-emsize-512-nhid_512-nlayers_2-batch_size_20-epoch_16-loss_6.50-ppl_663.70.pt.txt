Long; 

 the spectra, Virginia small and drear, that black flood 
 still vacant, and through the mesh fully, 
 one must count on his way, black enough 
 facing the garden wooden table, 
 spaces Pan, in the covers, the same bass 
 of a rambling bar taking delight from the headstone 
 who lies within the drain of shop, Legible 
 torn humour: hug and wild school perceptive, 
 worn crops? Catholic operating-rooms 
 full Not! buried: . . . . wd . . 
 meekest
