Space 

 monobloc fuck name; perfection go bread, 
 Greece isn't round another is peals 
 'Sooth, no one on a pot, than a hollow 
 warblings wing beside him; the very way passes 
 Through the flat top of the cliff across the ferry 
 And over a house of lights. A bird presses 
 
 In a spring ringing deep, the other times successively 
 
 marched from some small volume on his side, 
 Galera Antoinette, shook his Mother's hat, 
 fish-town, twins, Irita clasped
