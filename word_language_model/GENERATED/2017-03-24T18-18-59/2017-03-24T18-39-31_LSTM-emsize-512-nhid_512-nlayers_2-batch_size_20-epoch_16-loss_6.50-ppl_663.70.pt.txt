He Sees Me Self, Wundorsiona 

 Being wrong, being strong enough to be 
 The beautiful resemblance of all these years, 
 Both that are no liv'st and true. 
 
 It is the whale's dark orbs of the game. 
 But it's a year brought night by being, 
 In youth; gulf, though all time only, 
 But them warned by a head of truth 
 A right is lost here and not. heal-- the Aluminum 
 Short is the principle of hell at rest.
