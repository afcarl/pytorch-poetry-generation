To Meet Malice? 

 
 Then the noise of a woman we sang, 
 The color of tract 
 trembles on on a velvet patch death 
 Break out her throat through the air. 
 
 Three walls seeds 
 Far from evening other slackening chits 
 Beneath the numbered as crows in a cloud, 
 Fixed the heaped views of beef 
 //(allen heads that were taken and Bull 
 on--from in reality that makes them free 
 To purchase our God of our pilgrimage 
 hotter
