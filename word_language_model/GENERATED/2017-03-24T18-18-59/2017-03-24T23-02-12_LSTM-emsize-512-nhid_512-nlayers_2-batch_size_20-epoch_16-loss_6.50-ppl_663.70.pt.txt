How Hard His Skin Waning, 

 How might he have some balanced white is--as 
 of oak? reeds, 
 And the sees the sparrows guard light so talke. 
 
 Perfect and yet the power, in God's mood 
 is paddle, their diseased voice fills my mouth, 
 like hands deck'd, with eager eyes, 
 it deaths--in green, and Brittish path, still shining, 
 now it rises to sparkle me 
 in Frederick Street above the nervous house 
 where there my loveliness drifted away 
 into nodding,
