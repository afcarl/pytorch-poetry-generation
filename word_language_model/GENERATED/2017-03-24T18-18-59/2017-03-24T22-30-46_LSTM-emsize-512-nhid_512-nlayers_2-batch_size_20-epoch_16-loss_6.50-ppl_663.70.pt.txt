 Feet on the toes. 
 
 ably 
 Voice (Old December womenkind 
 
 The autumn sun is red and waitin' window 
 Till I will smell it. 
 I'll fall away from back to fold, 
 Sir Garnet insecure dials and dread: 
 Burn to the annual bank 
 Back to paltry, collar, icy mask 
 Of good and immense, Panorama of the west, 
 Dead on the woodland cities of the crown, 
 With its bright platelets: sailing in the brooks, 
 Lithe with Griefe
