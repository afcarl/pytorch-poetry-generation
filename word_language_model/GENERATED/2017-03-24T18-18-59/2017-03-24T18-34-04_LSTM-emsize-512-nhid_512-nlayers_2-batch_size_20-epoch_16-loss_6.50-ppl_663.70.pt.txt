 The City case sweeter than modified groves, 
 But Remuneration crosses and willows' devoutly 
 
 XXXIV The Journey I color 
 Beside it again. The message propose a bullet 
 Elijah for nature's prisons, left by passion. 
 I walked among the clods and gargoyled mouth. 
 
 Many night have I have taken now 
 In the room when I could see 
 The peeled, of earthen quest 
 Their orders yet felt my lady's hair. 
 
 Soon I sat 
 In the park
