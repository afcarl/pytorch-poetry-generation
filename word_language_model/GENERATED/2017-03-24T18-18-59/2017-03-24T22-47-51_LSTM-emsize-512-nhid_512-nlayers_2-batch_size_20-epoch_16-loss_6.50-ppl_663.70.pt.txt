Pitiless Mouthing 

 She blocked and left the pleasant brim. 
 And driven a foot in a circle that it stands, 
 Seen forming at the waterfall, her soul was mortal, 
 "He had no use as on an old solitude. 
 That day and night she met me. 
 But in love we would not cease to read ; 
 If the ashtray was pale, and the story; 
 Of a mighty marriage in her machine-throb Guineas, 
 Who knew her how little he would have been;
