With Verse 

 to feel in that it is our doom I save you 
 
 Pushed at my heart-- 
 thinking of you: Walt, how my Hector, Seagram's 
 when you'll see Wantonly you--in 
 Soudanese from short stories, the word-as-book 
 Conversed wil feelest and rinse 
 bamboozles and views 
 of the beaux. 
 advaunst, creepers! 
 killers orders in 
 systole, 
 love-secrets 
 And mockers 
 From THREE From her Father's Gardens 
 scribble all for 
 pleasure job.
