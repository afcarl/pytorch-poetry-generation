Shadow Hopkins 

 When moonlight sat down 
 In Narcissists with old agony, 
 The fertile never-ended high, 
 Borne to the stealing instruction-givers, 
 Daphne through the door 
 The oxen on the Rockies, lit 
 hibiscus at the stream. 
 
 horseman, on car and dale are the grass. 
 Then there is no such Eternal desert, 
 No single Pacific innocent 
 And reflected evenings, 
 That same last path below 
 A report, blush'd with the owl 
 Follow how many years since
