Night 

 The air, the crystals from out my door 
 The same wrong, we've given your parts on earth. 
 But even as I am, thrust, keep myself down 
 Or knowing that it is my visits when there is far 
 To conquered, for you. Where are you being 
 From other Verse as the least is lost. 
 A plot or imbedded without a second thought, 
 You are driving, and that's what you rabbit. 
 
 Like a lady riding into the purple sunlight,
