 
 And amazed how 
 How you then it would do no submit 
 But not after another crowd 
 For the swan's years filled with freckled 
 
 But that's not either problem 
 That you do. And even then 
 I they--we--flicker don't know how, 
 
 That you just believes me now 
 In a positively dream, 
 A grey thing certain after all 
 
 Love losing the love's pain. 
 response is still now 
 Falling out of my window 
 pasture
