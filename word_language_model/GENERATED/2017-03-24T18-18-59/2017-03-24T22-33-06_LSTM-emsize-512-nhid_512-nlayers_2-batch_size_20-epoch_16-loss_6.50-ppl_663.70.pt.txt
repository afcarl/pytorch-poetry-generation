 
 And the children on the handle 
 
 And they called 
 
 By the worst friends who crawl together 
 
 Only a pattern of kids, 
 
 Without the city of grace, 
 
 Or sea from their tiles . . . 
 
 folgership of wine; 
 
 They cherished these shores. 
 
 Who art so anguish or tomb, they know 
 
 Those who were dying together, -- 
 
 They haggard churls and pieces 
 
 Till it were grove
