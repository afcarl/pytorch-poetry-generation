The River 

 of deepest air, 
 and about love the ground 
 already 
 
 all day, we make stables-- 
 of rag against the sidewalk. 
 
 And when you stop it is almost a pile 
 when you button in the other one, 
 and says I were going to get away. 
 
 
 As we know the children there must be 
 a boy's room they must try their insanity 
 when we can go out to be able to crawl. 
 You
