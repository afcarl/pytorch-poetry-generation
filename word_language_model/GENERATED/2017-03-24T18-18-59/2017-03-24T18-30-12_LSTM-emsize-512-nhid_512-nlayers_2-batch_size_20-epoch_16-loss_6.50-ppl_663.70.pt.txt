 When the frogs came on in gold 
 In October Place 
 Dry pines and birds thick with height. 
 One hundred. 
 For another day is seen; 
 'Tis a shape for all things a 
 foil note 
 Or of dogs and adage 
 crosshatching in gardens 
 
 Let use. Under 
 the sky-lark drift 
 Into the carven 
 Ten blinding parts of being 
 dentist's cotton, and thickened head.
