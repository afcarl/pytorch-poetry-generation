 The communion, bay on my lip, 
 The broad blue spring does hover round. 
 Late in the moonlight now, 
 Where water attends 
 In the pale hall; 
 And at that other place, 
 With all his Realism 
 Till in the soot, 
 A widening sky's appear, 
 A quiet, leader, black; 
 
 And is glass. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Passage Monkey Again 
 
 
 Deep in the breeze in the monstrous streets, yet forests of steam, children about peace;
