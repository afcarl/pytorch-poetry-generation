 You need something. Now it's soon. Not for the one in the dark. 
 
 daylilies honey, wrap a plate to catch a spider of intricacy on the mountain. 
 It's clear spotted hair, which is clear or exposed; 
 Thou'll headlights what they are, in the back of their verge, 
 widens through rivers like shadows, layers of bones. 
 And the wheels of late roosters surround me, 
 The drops that roar within my heart 
 And lift a echo from the common guess
