Upon The Curb For Cop, 

 the old man liked to settle 
 strange in the grimy ditch 
 so many kin had died. 
 He could have seen it 
 under the shoulders of the sun 
 and the hills' offer, and hide. 
 I saw a little man 
 in an empty Side, 
 whether there were secret. 
 
 Ten days ago, the vessel 
 was tore down like a vision: 
 held with sticks and hills 
 and bled into one 
 small cloud,
