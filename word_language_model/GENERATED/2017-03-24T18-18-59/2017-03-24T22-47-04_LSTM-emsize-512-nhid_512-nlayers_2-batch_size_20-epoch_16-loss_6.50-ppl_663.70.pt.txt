 to mark his troubled desk 
 Bottlesford, but, does it Be 
 a happy man hackneyed 
 Matter-of-factly You're not 
 
 mere enough to be the inevitable 
 
 comers of wire, but where, 
 says, Beyond this eightball 
 Emily hears my untouched, lid 
 the veiled finitude, which 
 has land-- 
 circumvented stains 
 except drearily 
 cool squatter at the step. 
 
 Christ fought our own 
 Late then you--as 
 stood orange! 
 How one him made meed."
