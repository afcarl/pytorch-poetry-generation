Down 

 O streams that guard them in the skies. 
 But once we did find sick, 
 God lurk at the play of death, 
 And four-petaled, shadow long ago 
 He goes. The slightly lamp fibered 
 There on earth and other, 
 Up the balcony, seizeth 
 A roadlamp formed in darkness and flower; 
 to; hammered down. On a bath. 
 The boys seawater, two houses 
 Beat like a chimney, watched them 
 marking their figure together, 
 Map 'em back.
