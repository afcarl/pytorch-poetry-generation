For Mine, 

 Have we not thought to be black! 
 We left the set of loving men, 
 "While he had escaped mica-speckled, 
 Two boys surcoat, 
 minutest to be nectarine. 
 A jug [CH2O]: 
 In a German prince terry, 
 
 "Where does a snake, before we come, 
 Or go to bed with awayhe 
 Then quit the answer. 
 
 This week, the soil d' 
 Come fifty .... Inside your eyes of lake . . .
