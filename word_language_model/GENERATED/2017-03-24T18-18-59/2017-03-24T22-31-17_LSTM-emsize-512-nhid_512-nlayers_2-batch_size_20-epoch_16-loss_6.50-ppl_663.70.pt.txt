Grown Old, A Wanders Little; 

 Dickinson, by servants of the invincible barren, 
 The singers in their stony descent 
 Gardens their high coiling motion takes drunken 
 
 Only maps. Who has borne, to give Zephirus 
 
 In the thirsty Tongue and each drip stump from his foot, 
 At that moment and for each other, 
 I know how rich it is, or Gairmscoile 
 Or record in the sound drowned under the breeze.
