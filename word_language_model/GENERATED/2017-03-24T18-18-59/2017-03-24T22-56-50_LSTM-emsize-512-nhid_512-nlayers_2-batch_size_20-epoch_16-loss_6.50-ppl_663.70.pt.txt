Way, 

 angst: and sold. 
 Men and impassive guests that crew so! 
 
 O children roaring thro' the night they lay. 
 Pale fire they sang, and then they sat there; 
 Moves apart, they may, hillside." -- sunglaze 
 Rests and straw. The white shock made the doom, 
 The covert, sobbed with the Posthumous too, 
 The bridle of the dawn, the frolic sky 
 Awakening up like hearse, the dim blue shadows green. 
 Now the moon, I hear, and shall come again
