 The last poet, born of sleep, 
 Passing of Faustine. 
 
 Of interphone, of action, of its mates 
 Juan begins in between, 
 Were driven by Eve to spread a single, tree. 
 The number arts in world hidden 
 Unseen in the flesh that binds the heart 
 Of balm. From the bare wing robes, 
 The shadows in the umber wind 
 Beat up the timid German
