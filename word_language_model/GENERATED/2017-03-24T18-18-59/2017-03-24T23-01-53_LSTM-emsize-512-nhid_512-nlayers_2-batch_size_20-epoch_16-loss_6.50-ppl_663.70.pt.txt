 Prime came musings, 
 underneath the horse wires 
 in that symbolic room, 
 interstellar suburban city 
 When a great 
 sun began. 
 
 ex-wife's conformity. 
 Ball mountaintop So. 
 Boomlay, swan stomping 
 A hole in a paper 
 familiar as a car 
 Beauty rumor, 
 Holding bewildered at night 
 A hawk eager 
 Face 
 On brown foolish, heels. 
 
 Mrs. Peter walked on her suffocations
