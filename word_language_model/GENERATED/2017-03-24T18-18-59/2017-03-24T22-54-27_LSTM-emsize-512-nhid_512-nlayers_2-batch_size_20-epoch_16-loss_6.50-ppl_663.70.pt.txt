 It melts through the burns. 
 
 Thus here there is, the fairest ring 
 That should rise like a leaf before the music. 
 Morning and West. 
 It was unkind and trew 
 All the people graceful by. 
 
 You cannot report and lie on your knees 
 But when that memories are not fed, 
 Being fixed before; no tears, no longer, 
 Something that none asks for the World 
 That must be feeling will shine, 
 Though my lips cannot dust
