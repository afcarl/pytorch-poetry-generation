 Out of the sky the angels make themselves 
 frantic in dubiously not yet too large, 
 with Cosmic Art) follow as if the glass move 
 over it and then again itself again, 
 there are always we simply paradise and be: 
 LOVING wonder than that the lives of fine desires 
 passages and fathomless flesh our knell, 
 Scanty with all the void to her birth
