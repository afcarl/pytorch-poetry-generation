 To drive down its army, 
 And let me. In the new country, 
 In the glint of grass and casting dark. 
 
 Day spring day, I told myself, God said, 
 He would have said to me, ocean-bound, 
 For the place, he bowed it down, and his fifty-nine head. 
 Loud was one October (and remembered 
 A nervous horse that, on his own way, 
 The sickness of his children reached him. 
 He was as granite as the ancient hell of old.
