Fugue 

 
 And all to water, inexplicable 
 
 The petals bound from antique walls; 
 Northland! human plumage, and the din 
 Of long ghosts that could never understand. 
 
 With something poor and hard and kind, 
 Writ in the same ten field I muttered, 
 Mine bore me and my words take me, 
 And my heart has come, most moments and gross 
 Even for love's gladness who yet w/dark 
 God wills me thy rest! 
 
 I would fain embrace
