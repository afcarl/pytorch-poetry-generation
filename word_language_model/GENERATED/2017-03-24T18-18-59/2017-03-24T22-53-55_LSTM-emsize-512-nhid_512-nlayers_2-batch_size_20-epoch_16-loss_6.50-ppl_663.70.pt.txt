For The First Time 

 that the leaves grew close, whose loose grave 
 toss out the huge doors of visible ears, 
 Anthology? for troubled ourselves. 
 I planted a motor bowl and throwing it 
 into the dark. There is the colors 
 of contempt of longing, as the sea is, 
 that the last square fountain--with 
 rows of laughter sighs Hancock tight 
 as the body's lap explodes at them. 
 In the last colors of glass, 
 women let pass in the pit
