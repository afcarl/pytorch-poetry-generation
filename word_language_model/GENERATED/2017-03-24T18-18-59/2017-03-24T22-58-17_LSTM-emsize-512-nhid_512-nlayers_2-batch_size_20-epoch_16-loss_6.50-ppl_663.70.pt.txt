 Held somewhat from the sense 
 Of things that came on chasms against 
 A single animal or a sea whose foam; 
 times; with prow wrapped in a kindness's 
 A palm of lucent Nothingness 
 And the Po, motion of a scholar 
 fashionably amid the fishermen Gawd, 
 The loneliness and its own moral life 
 Is it anthologies of reason and mind 
 Which is a Line from evil memory, 
 And all the Soul gesture, let us go. 
 No bee double-blind
