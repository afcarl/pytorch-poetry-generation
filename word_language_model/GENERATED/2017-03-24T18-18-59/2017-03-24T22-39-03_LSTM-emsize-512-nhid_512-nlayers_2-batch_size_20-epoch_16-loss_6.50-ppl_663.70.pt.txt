Pleas'D With My Annie. 

 
 May I behold my love or thought of death as ever 
 To wander down from the pliant forest darkening in the hours; 
 I wish, I know it is little real, 
 And I will name my way after the sea. 
 
 My pardon is done, it is a pretty to be vain. 
 Let the world's hours smite in, and our tears are you,' 
 locate, his proverb, and death is undone. 
 
 
 
 
 
 On
