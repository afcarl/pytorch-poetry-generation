How It Meant So Still It Cherishing 

 With green heaven, pure as the stirring, the blue screen moisture 
 Told that to take it ear before the heart was stark 
 An milke snowflake its tremendous powerless--O fed by the night-- 
 A man in clover. He slams in his rage, with his sojourn 
 More rebuilt by the bruised faces pulling loose from his own prison 
 Because he shouted, grumble and lord of his running woo: 
 Half meant, and need, like the heat finding
