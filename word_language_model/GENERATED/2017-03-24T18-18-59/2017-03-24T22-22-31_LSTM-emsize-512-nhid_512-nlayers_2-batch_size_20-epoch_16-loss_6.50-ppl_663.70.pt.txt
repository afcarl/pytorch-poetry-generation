 
 I would not snore 
 To the helplessness these two feet 
 Of earth may lead away 
 To cast away the routine 
 And I must praise, I lose my thoughts 
 Back farther on each Sun; 
 I will be many wild flowers 
 Meet always for a trace 
 Of death, perhaps, of sleigh, 
 And let you Sanhedrins come back 
 And go into the light 
 Turning my people home 
 I peel you till you fly 
 Moonrise, and polished
