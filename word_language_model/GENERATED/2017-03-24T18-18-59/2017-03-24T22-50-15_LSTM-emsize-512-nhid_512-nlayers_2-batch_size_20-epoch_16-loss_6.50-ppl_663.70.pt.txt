Silhouettes To The Sun, 

 Or wonder, where they could perch or stop, 
 But whether it apply. But something no good time 
 And going, though may find his drawing-room laugh 
 And polish him for my grief in many places 
 Maybe the case is what I can. 
 The meaning will be gathered all beginning to stand 
 Before I loved. I wish in fear there was 
 A story unsodden is being granted for Reaches yet algebraic doublets 
 Once less that nothing rewarded
