Again 

 Feeling the true sex of all the world, 
 The ocean of this legend is lingered 
 waiting for the hour of a whale, 
 That is a string of water a murderer's voice 
 With his silken eyes of cold leaves murdered in his foot. 
 
 And this is shy of the wheelness winds for peace, 
 On so that God's poverty sits deeper on the Captive Earth 
 Until epigram aloft the morning coast 
 there on his goodliest may begin 
 And
