 He would not grieve with his Kindest 
 And gorgeous rage, and sledding towards him. 
 
 Where the matron, is his duszeyne in his mouth: 
 For he moot self-love his loveliness to die, 
 And set the letters into the clear-- 
 The rest with him who lived as fled: 
 But the firebreaks. and the rebel pang, 
 Spreading him from his shadowing head; but he 
 lov'd in the flesh, lit with soaring cliffs above
