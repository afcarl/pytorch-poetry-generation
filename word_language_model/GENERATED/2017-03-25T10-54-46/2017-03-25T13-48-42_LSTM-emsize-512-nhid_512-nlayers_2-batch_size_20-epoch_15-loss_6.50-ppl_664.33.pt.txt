Souffle, The Nomads Give 

 striking a duke like an cavern as they limp and unabdicated-- 
 And drank them in their fragrance 
 and leaned out before the distance 
 throwing out their feet and feet, praying in their narcotics; 
 Instead, I was young as the young man, 
 I saw from an island on a (laparotomy). 
 suddenly decades arm, hands each step up 
 the horse at the altitude of his neck. 
 I remember the woman 
 drifted out through the trees.
