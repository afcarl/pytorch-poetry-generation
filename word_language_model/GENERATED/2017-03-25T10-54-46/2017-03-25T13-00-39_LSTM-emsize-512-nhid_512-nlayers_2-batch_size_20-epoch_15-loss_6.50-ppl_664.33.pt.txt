Sat In Hers, 

 listening to ease the rising chariot. 
 
 5 
 As winds up within the shadow Sheened 
 Of two bucks fled from the ruins 
 they kept slaughter to rock like one, 
 like a house or a solid prayer, diagnosis. 
 neon, hardly tearing 
 after a star to the myself. 
 
 I looked wings in my back face, 
 but I knew that God grew near 
 and ran into the needle's chair. 
 It was so I thought it
