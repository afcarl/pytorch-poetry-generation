 A armour of shot glare-wolf. 
 
 Outside, her meshed slips free; 
 (Lost now, wanting the rose; 
 If she should be seen spy chuckling 
 
 Up to the stripes and gale, 
 chuckle flight in the old dead 
 And fling the grass out from her dress 
 At night with deep soar. 
 
 We shall in every other turn 
 Our flying frame sleeping! 
 Or wasp nor in its keeping 
 A shape of any sense 
 Whose dreams or Contend,
