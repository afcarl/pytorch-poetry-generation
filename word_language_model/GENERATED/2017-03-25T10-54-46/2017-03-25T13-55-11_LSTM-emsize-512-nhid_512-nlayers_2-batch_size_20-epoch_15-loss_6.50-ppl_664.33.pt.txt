 down the river, too duck: 
 the broad world, with its braille 
 rump on the revealing? The thing 
 that sits in the body that looks like racks--all 
 smoke after day. As hard as words, 
 glass pants out of the pier, 
 the damage: curve 
 like the sun 
 at a distance block 
 to the giant fiber of Uffizi 
 sharing nothing head-feint, 
 ah, like the stars, the illusion 
 call La newsreels, is blood 
 
 gives back the sacrifices,
