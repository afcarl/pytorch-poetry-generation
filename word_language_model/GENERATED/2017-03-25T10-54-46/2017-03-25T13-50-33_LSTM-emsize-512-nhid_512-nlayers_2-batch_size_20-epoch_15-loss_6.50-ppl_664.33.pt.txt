 Love moved through every sleep 
 
 That the morning rang 
 
 In the fresh of night in the dooryard essence, 
 
 And the train blew, and the light shook flying, 
 
 And the rain midnight ere you weep, 
 
 The dunghill of Po 
 
 What is these clouds of o'erflowing; 
 
 Take up the swell--I Slip, 
 
 "What the noises of men, 
 
 How soon, I wake writing a face; 
 
 I doubt not nose-full in rank,
