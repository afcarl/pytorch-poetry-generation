 What is it thou hast ever seen. 
 
 Born to lie there 
 Full of the soft and silver still, 
 The ropes new, and ethereal flower, 
 All charming and dim and learn'd, of shy 
 Conscious, Truth, thorn- 
 In a far sound of charges bowers, 
 Dark palms of temples go wretchedly 
 And let them bring, but shone alone, 
 Then let the coffin die, 
 Then where, friends say, or heard here. 
 
 What then? (Don Wild Disdain inspire.
