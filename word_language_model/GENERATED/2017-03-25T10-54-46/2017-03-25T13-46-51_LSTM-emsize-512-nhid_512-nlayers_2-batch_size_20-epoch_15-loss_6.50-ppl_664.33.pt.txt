 For three who stuck out to be the same flower 
 From old crab's men who see whose palace 
 
 Descending strong to bough. Where once he lay, 
 
 Seen again at last: silent, Puffing 
 
 With moving plumes and scarlet chest 
 
 To the tallest grass -- down whitewashed Cabirian 
 
 That same.[By wide, its watches, guides them rest. 
 
 But village struck the edge of the jasmine wheel. 
 
 Thus pay the gard'ner Arthur thought of Him.
