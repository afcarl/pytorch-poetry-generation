Where The Arch Soul Spent Summer 

 
 Above the night turning out 
 And willing notes on sinuous mediaeval 
 peal'd. how secret the Spectator 
 Spreads the Sickness they in traplines and flees 
 In leafy crash of blood and weather 
 The labyrinth of air, rich absurd! 
 Dead as a coastal shard of Manhattan, 
 Part of the brain night out, waspe; 
 
 For what 1889 in the neighboring graves 
 
 of the spiritual was seen by the ocean's glory. 
 Hell
