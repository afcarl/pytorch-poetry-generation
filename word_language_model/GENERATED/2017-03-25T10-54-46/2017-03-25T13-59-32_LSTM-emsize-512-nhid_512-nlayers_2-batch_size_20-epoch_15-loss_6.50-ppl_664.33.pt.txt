Supplizio As Something Always Fit; 

 The happy speech in some wura; a outlay 
 Of noose. And the barbarous passions, 
 What bring me useless, what instill'd it, 'if 
 Just reveals it is not the carpenter nook 
 In vain of glad-eyed Scarecrow a flash of affairs, 
 
 Dim and briefly that overarching shade where attention; 
 impish themselves that curl like a moth, 
 Be framed by doubt, when Nothing were red or over-rate 
 The world, even in the trouble now grew
