 Ascend, she may subjective.

 I was in the western mass. 
 I saw my heart in open hand, 
 Too many, now I fear he is dead, 
 His secret blood is void of Love.

 His lineaments is mingled with my desperate thought, 
 When the lightning flew down from His turned-up car, 
 And the fields said: and so long gone
