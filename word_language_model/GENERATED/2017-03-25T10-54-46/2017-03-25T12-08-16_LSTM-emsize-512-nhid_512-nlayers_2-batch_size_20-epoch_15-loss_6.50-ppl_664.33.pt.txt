Brothers, 

 the islands of my sinking body 
 spreading like waters at its touch. 
 
 Immutably the silence 
 of the medieval infection, 
 
 Back to the industrial pay--we'll Sun 
 Teeny hygrometer 
 with toast lest silent hashish 
 
 or, as one throwe from a Fabrick of a stranger. 
 In one glance, I remember the shuffle, 
 pulled from the arch a trail on his block 
 for grandeur and sonnet and black on the air. 
 
 A leg was out
