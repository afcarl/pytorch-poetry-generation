 
 And the grey tablets of our mown world is game, 
 (No blessed secrets is no meaning, 
 None of itself and lovers, its flaw, 
 The rhyme it will learn was our own Bathtub 
 And its shatter'd Snout, points in stream incursions. 
 But after all, deare way to exile 
 So for the rainy level. We 
 Had tried more than we can buy in time 
 A land of hope since that was never all; 
 Like barbed steely by an April
