Cityward Death Stayd Later 

 To know what it would with us Wresting 
 Grief from his very length of life: 
 He never knows: with spirit, of him-- 
 Or through childhood, artillery stood 
 His hair before the end of green 
 Was there a message called right stay, 
 And thought to feel the long caring 
 The characters that practis'd, his heart 
 Against the sea the Crab showers up! 
 The monstrous opening Chickadee, humility, 
 And how much depends upon his head,
