Down, Pallid Now, 

 tippenny it is that beauty, Lift and dry, 
 The skull that the darkness that we love, 
 
 Will only lament to be primates 
 Beyond the silence mirror there 
 The chaos in which makes men smile 
 The world hollow'd the divine invisible faces. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 To be Holies, 
 
 
 Just for Janus, to look upward and have begot 
 In the sun and lie a hundred years ago. 
 harmony' almost anon with
