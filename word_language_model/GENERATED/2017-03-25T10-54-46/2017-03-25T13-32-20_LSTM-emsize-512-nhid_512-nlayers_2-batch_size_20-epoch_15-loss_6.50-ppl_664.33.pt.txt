 Time is like a basement of some suburban sea; 
 the fractur'd Russia. intimations of things 
 at the sudden end, then 
 into the heart of vision far 
 
 far from the death-parlor in shadow. 
 Her Mortician clicked next 
 to coarsens at the bottom, soft 
 moon climb toward steam, 
 Bill, within six bloody years 
 
 with the dark dust, carrying space 
 tumble inside whatever dark 
 there is his mule. 
 
 The rain feathers breathe drifted 
 Sick-thoughted
