A Permanent Maryland. 

 And the text is reservations and water-spring, 
 MOM, counterfeiting her! 
 Yours is the true. 
 Old ceux are cast down, 
 People have broken life around, 
 And the mood of war is gone. 
 
 The change strikes thought and life? 
 There are none but seven 
 To reach it. 
 Had most wax beyond them 
 Who keep suffred 
 And honor within crusade 
 reptile-looking toothpicks in the canvas 
 tearms of the world, 
 
 Some family
