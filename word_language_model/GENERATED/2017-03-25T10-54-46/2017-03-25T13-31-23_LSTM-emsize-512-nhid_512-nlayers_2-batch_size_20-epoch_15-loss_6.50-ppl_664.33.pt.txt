Down Maneuvers 

 Charge, please as before, 
 We married thought of sin 
 Our facts and sons, 
 And home lie in our lives 
 Singing painting in our knaves 
 It is a kind of prison. 
 Since the rage of summer's many years 
 We grow ages, 
 We keep ourselves away! 
 We have chosen a garden 
 For snow, to see 
 that, after mist 
 Above the sun again. 
 
 We drive into the sleep 
 You have reading
