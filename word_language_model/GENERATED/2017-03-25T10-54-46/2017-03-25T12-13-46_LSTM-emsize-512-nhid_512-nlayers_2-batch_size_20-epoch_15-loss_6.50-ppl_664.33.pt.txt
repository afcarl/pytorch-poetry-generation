Carcus The Knight, And I 

 She did swell with her hand, that was 750 
 Stretch'd that loved slat. 
 Fly back, and rest company, 
 & moved from bed to shore. 
 
 (In death, she says I would love you. 
 She wonders if she could explain 
 a fevered anthem carefully, 
 riding the back, 
 and sat down on the top enchanted--it 
 with me ain't already letting it fly 
 windows on your summoning cheek 
 and listen to it for weather.
