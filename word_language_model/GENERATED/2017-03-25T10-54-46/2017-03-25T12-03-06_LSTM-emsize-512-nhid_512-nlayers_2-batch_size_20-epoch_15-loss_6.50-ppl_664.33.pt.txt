 Last twice pale head, I'll see them cry. 
 Nevertheless, she is shallow tree, 
 And earth I'm close for me. 
 I'll stay in 1959 
 circling my door 
 In the vet, and the foliage 
 Orchestra in dark black slush, 
 The young man sits out) 
 
 And so he spurred 
 "The Atlantic Don 
 With his roof coins in the fire? 
 Down last winter I walked 
 I find a Crackhead, 
 But I'd left my hands, 
 I play
