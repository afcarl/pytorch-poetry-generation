 Still after he became gray, 
 millet crossed their bloudy chains, 
 lace-- your name sweet elder crock 
 At all qualmes of the vices of the sod, 
 Quickly and late 
 They blue-gray in snow; 
 Who came Vesuvian 
 It stroked again; 
 
 We were never a good thing: 
 But to pray they claim 
 And the wished as they was? 
 'Twas no time, overfilled, -- he -- 
 Say he never whack it -- 
 The news may kouign
