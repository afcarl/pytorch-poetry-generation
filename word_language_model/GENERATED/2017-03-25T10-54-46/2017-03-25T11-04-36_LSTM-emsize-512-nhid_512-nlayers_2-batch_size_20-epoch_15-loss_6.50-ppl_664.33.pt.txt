 Whose thick hands slide remote from tears and branches 
 By struggle the root of the earth. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Familiar Boy 
 
 
 It was so late 
 They had to hold 
 Like a white sun 
 And found on gymnopaedia. 
 
 They thought they would not rise and close their pants. 
 So, we lie in the park 
 Thunder genital; 
 And you're holy & mind. 
 
 My little painted 
 ivory and wrinkled coffee
