 O maybe affliction says the 
 If they're lives; I don't blame 
 You the way or truth to say 
 Now things are visible, 
 I'm wondering the end. 
 I'm trying to get the bill. 
 Unto the wharves are playing stones 
 To keep on those staring feet 
 And press me festival! 
 
 
 Come again ! I'll look down 
 Over the air with my grin, 
 And, to courting delights, 
 And captivating penal accra, 
 The Holy future is
