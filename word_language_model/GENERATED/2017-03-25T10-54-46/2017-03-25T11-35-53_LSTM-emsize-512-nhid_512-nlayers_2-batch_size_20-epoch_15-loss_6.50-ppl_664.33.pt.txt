 A naked bird found out in every face 
 Of adding an farm to the kirk, 
 And south of Darkness seemed to start 
 The little mincing swath-swathed 
 And slipping from it to cry . . . 
 
 My little friend waited for me 
 And dropped the aide, but rang again 
 Along the water, as she bent me flying, 
 And made of it survives again 
 My heart weeps battle to sounds--the 
 She took the arm of its fad
