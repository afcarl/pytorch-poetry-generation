My Misery 

 That draws tufts of site and death. 
 For then into a hurry you she will know 
 What poets are to and fro now 
 Are you in all your hands though the nights are in their eyes. 
 
 One of the others will come to me, 
 You must hear in their banks as snow land and mouth of the big bird. 
 
 This you may sleep with your own city 
 And the ones who you in them.
