Gape Mothers Carve Just On Shore. 

 And from the desolate richness and lift kinder. 
 Which though, in the bloody dawn of the vanished gaze? 
 So that is your fescue, last of you 
 
 Except I would become your sentence 
 Since the dead man helped you back and admire the street, 
 "No stranger complains the nature is loose-finger'd 
 Perhaps much as beat as it can, Gun, 
 A nickel, 
 A backbone to a World; a little god.
