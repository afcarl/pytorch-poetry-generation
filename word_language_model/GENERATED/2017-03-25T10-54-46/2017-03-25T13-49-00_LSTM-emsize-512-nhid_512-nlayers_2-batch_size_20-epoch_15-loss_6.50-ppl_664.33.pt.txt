 
 He tells me: mesurable is this you 
 
 that weary, forgive her, to make a wake -- 
 
 folly does not made 
 
 which, more rich than her mathematics. 
 
 Never pushed it, or laid a pitcher 
 
 Twice drew up, her smile the silent 
 
 Goddess, soon speaks alone. 
 
 tow-path indeed, is not even its object but Towny 
 
 Now, clapping, spend the colt of the forest-nation, 
 
 Fallen around with the rod,
