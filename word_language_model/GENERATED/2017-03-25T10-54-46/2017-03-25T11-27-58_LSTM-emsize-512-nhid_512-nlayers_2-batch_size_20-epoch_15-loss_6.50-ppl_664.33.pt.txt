 When I had not loved thee since I cried 
 And went off with a pilot from thee. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Disappointment of the Coast 
 
 
 In the slant windows approach--not and lost 
 The flinching, zillion drifters on east and Earth 
 And the sun rises low, and the seam grew 
 And silent as the shepherd's height; 
 Under the rugged file hung whole. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Decay. Rican 
 
 
 Walking
