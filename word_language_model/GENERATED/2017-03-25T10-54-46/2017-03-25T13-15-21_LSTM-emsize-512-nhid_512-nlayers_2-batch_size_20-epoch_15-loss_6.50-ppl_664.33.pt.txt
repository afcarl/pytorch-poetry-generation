 A cloystre. a flower clapping, come back to college, 
 "You're cold and cold. 
 
 The evening sky is a river 
 grist-mill citizens 
 Though nailed to play the human heart 
 
 During the harbor, a tree where lightning wakes right--I trolley 
 battling your face as I am 
 I made directions: 
 the red unimaginable flesh of Maria liquors. 
 
 The Dark is no brown place 
 So men suggest boats with flowers I read 
 Pacuvius, big men in Tamalpais
