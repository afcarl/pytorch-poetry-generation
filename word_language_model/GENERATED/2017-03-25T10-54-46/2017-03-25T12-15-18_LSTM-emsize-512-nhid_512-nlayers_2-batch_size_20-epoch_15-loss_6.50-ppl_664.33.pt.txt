Rage 

 You could almost lose a group of passion, 
 Nor as Olay. Let cold command or time 
 Endure. dusting for pride, riches, a prayer. 
 
 From every warning she wiped the shadow 
 Round that night had her old daughter. 
 The captain saw it like a passed, 
 To the top of the beard he sleep and made 
 Her tangled curls outstretched, come into quick eye 
 And tended to death 
 While she his mind was gone to him
