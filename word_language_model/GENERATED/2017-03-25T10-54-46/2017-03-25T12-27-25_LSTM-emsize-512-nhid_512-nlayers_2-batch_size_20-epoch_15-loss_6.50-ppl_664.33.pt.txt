 He says fed-up -- his mission is cheekbones, 
 Great John of the BOOM, let you pass; 
 And meet and way; 
 Or understand that, if sought; 
 Giving it true, God will great will take, 
 And parted with his arrows all his choir.

 Thou in ivy, stretch thee down to sea, 
 Thro' remote mountains my lids divine 
 And our eyes faint
