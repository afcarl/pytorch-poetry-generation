The Cat 

 
 Beauty said all day, and again 
 Where those two impassive eyes would have span: 
 From your dreams I like to do them wrong, 
 You'd think that I could see and hear 
 I keep long? what immense and upland rill, 
 Poor organ I said. I was neither worried inside 
 The fifth earth, and we dread my breath, 
 And sleep froze strain, till the sunlight was! 
 
 XXII 
 I 
 Am that the glacier remain'd that woodland
