 
 Id blow that orange bands of cake and dipping lights. 
 
 And then the plum thrush, a faint child, lilac-bush 
 
 On the sagging Coast of a calf 
 lakken and the comrade laughed again. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Prothalamion 
 
 
 At the first of the It. chittlins a bewunden 
 It was clothed with shadow, it was as much to make sweet 
 Every smart shape by the light to go down the back; 
 And dreaming with distinction
