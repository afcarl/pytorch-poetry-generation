Seen, 

 though it was rained dancing on your wooden stove. 
 When you've got much tonight. you want a shout of wind 
 or fire on the untilled floor beside my office, 
 
 but it's nothing. Coupled by the door 
 comes outward into the future clue 
 is only the darkness I think she will deerest 
 Her steps so close when the light light is red 
 down this morning watching there are wild flowers in this song 
 who are great horrors thrown
