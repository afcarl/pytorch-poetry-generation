Tipped, I Put My Forearm 

 And wash the fallow home-town of the stone 
 And hewn limbs and shake the slim steps deep 
 Cravan 
 Into the house I have and turned, I go, 
 And hurry to the moon, let me arise 
 Against the hurt and Willy-nilly seise hand 
 For pleasure, my desire and living love. 
 
 Thy mother will save me crept 
 & camp and down traffic Arbitress, 
 Why do we know, or do she do 
 but never
