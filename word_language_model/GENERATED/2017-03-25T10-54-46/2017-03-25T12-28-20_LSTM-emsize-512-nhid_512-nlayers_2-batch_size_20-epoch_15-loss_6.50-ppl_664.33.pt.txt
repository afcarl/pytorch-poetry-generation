Mast 

 me to stop. On pairs of July 
 I live walking with an empty lots 
 and the way a circle is bowls on all directions, 
 Spring which begins to show me 
 now that is the one I will never 
 feel my wish -- it mind 
 or ward's 
 version hips in 
 an unequal 
 fall, 
 who all grace saying 
 unremarkable: dutch bowled, 
 
 Art 
 
 whom he used to be 
 great Praying, 
 he didn't
