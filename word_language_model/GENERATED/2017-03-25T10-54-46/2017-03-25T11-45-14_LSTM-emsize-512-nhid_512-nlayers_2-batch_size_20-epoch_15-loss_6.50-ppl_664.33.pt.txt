Through The Trees 

 And all the animals begin to walk alive in their shadows. 
 
 Sweat is resting here to rid of the answer: 
 I'll be sure soon, Friend; And dreams I claim development, 
 On pair still sailor and has a garden on fatiguing 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lerone 
 
 
 Nobody could he do with mind 
 than grief or social stores 
 or the middle of the kitchen 
 Signs of these dead men who have lived
