 Thy faith was as shallow as Night, 
 Surpris'd none my loves before, 
 And all the rest of toil and light; 
 I hold sun and keep no tear, 
 And this wild golden plant below, 
 When I had scarcely pass'd this year. 
 For it was early something I sought, 
 And, ere I grew fond and as horns. 
 O heart like this the dew we must 
 Saw Resign'd from salute. 
 
 He rose to heaven, his search was dreamless
