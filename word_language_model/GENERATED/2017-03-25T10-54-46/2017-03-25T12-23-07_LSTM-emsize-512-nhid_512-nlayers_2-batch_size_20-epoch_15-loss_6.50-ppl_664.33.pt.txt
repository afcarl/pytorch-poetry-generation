 
 And I go home at the bottle 
 To tell the lame again 
 With my eyes shining as soft as snow; 
 And the bones that whirl above 
 That haunted breath 
 Day, seeing cool timber, 
 Voices cover us all alone, 
 Mid ecological weep again 
 Under their arrowy footsteps 
 
 In their high halls. 
 
 Night and evening flame 
 Frozen down your fist. 
 
 Your eyes moving on 
 Heard the sharp curb seem, 
 orgasm upon
