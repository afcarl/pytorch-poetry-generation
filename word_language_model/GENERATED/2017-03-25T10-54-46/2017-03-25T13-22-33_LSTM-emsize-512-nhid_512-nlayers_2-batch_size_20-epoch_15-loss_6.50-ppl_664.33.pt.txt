But, Fate Does Not Care. 

 
 
 
 
 
 Family Frog 
 
 
 Kingdom is the way. 
 This is the spring, of fecundity of the flesh, 
 And my Lord created them to me; 
 Heaven is very lovely of dubious death; 
 And a sound for a temperate kiss does only see 
 All her possible assay. 
 
 Lightning! simplicitie 
 They are thin. 
 Romance is the hills 
 To velvet someones know, 
 And the devil the Curse 
 Was
