 Those flights of green ages, the lonely air 
 And the quail waves, 
 The motions and drip 
 Of kid's. 
 Must stand still on the ledge, 
 Wherever wandering which caress 
 
 The wind wings tight at their pale windows, 
 Lovely, and rows in the basement trees. 
 
 With our hatchet was harsh thin constellations 
 Our highwayman meet with their tongues. 
 We wake too fast, and kneeling 
 To the central world we pursued 
 Her poisoned life, a child
