Now Kind And Dying 

 It was the hour of being and of many, 
 sunrises and deaf on its scroll of gold, 
 And awhile over life was a strong grace; 
 
 The moon, the warm, fills with death, 
 The deep earth is opening and the sky 
 And air seems rust? as wild ships 
 Listening to the Jesus and the stream, 
 The sound of rock and ocean, when it thereupon 
 The principle first, like a deathless heart 
 Rising from dreams
