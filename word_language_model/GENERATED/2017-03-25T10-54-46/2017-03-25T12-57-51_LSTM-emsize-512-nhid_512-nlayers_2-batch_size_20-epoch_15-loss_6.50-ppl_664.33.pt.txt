State Riviera And Bar 

 To live against the sapphire waves, walls and canal, 
 Wherever they fell, as they sail, 
 And big and smooth, and saw the din 
 Of the crash and lumber beside the shining gas Sandwich. 
 Where the miniature heron rides in the causeway vines 
 And smokes of azure tree. 
 
 professional, dreaming with a bare ragged cape, 
 His rage drives to and dropping with --If the cart 
 And the sweet likeness of a child's eyes made,
