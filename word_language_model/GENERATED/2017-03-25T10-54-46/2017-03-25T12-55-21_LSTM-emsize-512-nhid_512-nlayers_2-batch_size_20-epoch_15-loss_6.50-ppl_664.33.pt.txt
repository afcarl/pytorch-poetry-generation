Fitted Closer To A Horse, ... One, 

 None of the man left either and every shower, 
 The black house then: keep off with downward, it gets in. 
 One breath, though, my bouquet of friendship was photographed 
 
 In the coccyx Adriatic, where the girl's swung weakness--it 
 Always trains darkening from rain or darkness. 
 
 The stars stand pounding in the blinding October. 
 So anathema direction--toward once mixed. 
 The couple of old downtown. 
 
 Now however fancy, shrink into nods,
