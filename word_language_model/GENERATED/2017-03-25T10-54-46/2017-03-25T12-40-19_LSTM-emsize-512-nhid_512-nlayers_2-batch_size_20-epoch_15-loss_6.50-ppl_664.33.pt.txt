 Saying although it was, like these bones, 
 the music gathered on its sleeves. 
 Often I fall to the lake 
 in the bones, for centuries later, 
 along the shore of the hill mocking itself. 
 
 And at radio in which there was a slow 
 as the sun glancing in this 
 
 *** 
 
 
 The dogwood rock sprouts water over the incalculable 
 Pax days, and the evening ending. 
 Then it floats off and 
 down, sleep, and drift
