No. Where Synchronized Safeguarding 

 Yell up the Down waves of tracks without a simmer on the bluff 
 
 as he checks the daylight to the rims of his arm

 to the odor, another strata, 
 door the other side of the station 
 of the first slow dusk ring three hour down 
 
 we know no night's friends 
 thank you with new letters at --Martin
