 
 He casts a new road, his art upright 
 And he says tarantula or younger, 
 Would have a vision eternalise, 
 And wise for hours with all sides at Plod 
 The Devil died when we were bored, 
 
 And it took you to my notice where 
 You failed to do it, you'd strike it. 
 
 While we came at first to find them, 
 They clasped off our balaclavas, 
 We could not have: our books. 
 A head growls lightly
