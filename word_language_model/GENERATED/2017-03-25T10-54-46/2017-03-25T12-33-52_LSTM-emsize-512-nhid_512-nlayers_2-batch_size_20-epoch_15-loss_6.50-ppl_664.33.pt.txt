 mockeries, a hole and two, a smile 
 And an echo you unfold how loud 
 Was the dawn you drive the lot like fishes 
 Propeller-blade across the grass made freights. 
 So ascend the forest rung and dry 
 On leaves nowhere with words 
 sang by one, like the grown blue in his black snout 
 That stood there, helve a constant name 
 Over fields to mountains over pools clumps 
 
 Down night the angel plenteously the spiral 
 And mocking finger
