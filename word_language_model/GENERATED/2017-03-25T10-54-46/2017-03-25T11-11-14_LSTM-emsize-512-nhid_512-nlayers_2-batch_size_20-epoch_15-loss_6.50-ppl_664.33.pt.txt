 I and I had gone out of my flesh, 
 
 Where were the first poultry greeting thou 
 star-full my hand, my slaves, my vice-president 
 The Wedding-Guest of trouble, at the rational time,

 I carry a little Dragnet parka 
 and watch my lips go back and forth. 
 My right foot assaid to girls, and cleans his hand, 
 and let me find to believe
