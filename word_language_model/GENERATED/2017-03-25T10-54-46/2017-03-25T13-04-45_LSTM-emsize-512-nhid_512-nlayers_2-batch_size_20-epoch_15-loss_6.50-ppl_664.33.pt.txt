 Burn or flattened in the overtaken 
 
 squatting from the music, 
 
 The horizon at a future cup, 
 
 Seeing the world and colours of more skill 
 
 And somehow seemed so like it we bled, 
 
 Who like to tatters 
 
 On the gay detested seasons. 
 
 
 As he swims through the flight) 
 
 Some are burning two great spirits home. 
 
 
 I suppose he love
