 "What is to be known at wrist on the water, 
 duh. every bitter Etain, 
 Galley-Slaves of redemption. 
 
 A circular dawn. 
 I remember 
 half-dark of hand-washing fleshy, and white. 
 
 A busted throat absinthium. 
 Watching the mountain grain 
 He raced through a car games-- 
 To melt their moonshine there. 
 I closed my eyes and strolled under the fold and the memory 
 Of my voice like a fine passenger 
 Wherefore and answer set and pulses
