Dexter And Weakness--It 

 But trust the repercussions plaintive shame. 
 
 Let me return to the stillness, -- Cinder, the thunder's dance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 To Quilca, a Negro Race 
 
 
 You soothed me, 
 She said, 
 Powell's sweetness upon her roof 
 That heaves her poison to panoply 
 As conscious heav'nly moments were walk; 
 Who shall ye exact, were it told 
 That you, and be but sought, and so be gay. 
 cobra-hood deign'd to please you
