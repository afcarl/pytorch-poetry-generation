 Let the worm press knocks 
 Seemd by the Apostles of sun 
 On hand to hand the fire fainting 
 Ironing no focal Horses 
 Than distant flower or breathless corn, 
 To mutually or on mast'ring side, 
 Farther through mais 
 To what shall I pass in wind 
 To wonder, seeing 
 The sword of darkness, 
 O dark electric shell 
 Then my joy ! antiphons father! 
 Thrice ye who forget that first
