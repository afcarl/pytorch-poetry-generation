Avycen, 

 And does the teacup come to her, to buy 
 honeywheat, partners of sin; and I magnetize 
 The Grandpa with her finger in her face. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Testing Recollections 
 
 
 My younger mother died 
 As I read by a man already 
 Who stood there 
 
 When she woke me to me. 
 
 So, in her whole closet, she cleaned away. 
 
 XL 
 Sexton. exempt from hard home to you! 
 Love comes.
