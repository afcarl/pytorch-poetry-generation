I Came To Join But Route. 

 to this valley that still seemed too Social 
 As they changed behind alone the years we are not. 
 Before I had another mind 
 To Skye. Just incomprehensible 
 With its internal silence 
 That was anywhere in the crevice of a night; 
 and the light descend, 
 (a decent two voices, every cup. 
 We had quiver for unrolled, 
 and our song wouldn't whiteness 
 but we will easily 
 Toward where they recall alone
