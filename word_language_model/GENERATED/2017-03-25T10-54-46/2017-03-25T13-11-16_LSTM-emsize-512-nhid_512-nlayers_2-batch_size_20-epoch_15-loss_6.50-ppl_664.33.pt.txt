A Member 

 of ham around the surface of the world 
 and the bare pool of this wasted world 
 where when the sunset hangs 
 onto the fields. All things 
 a little moving itch will not die 
 inside 
 
 there are always words that cannot 
 yield. A pact 
 that leads to get itself outside 
 from a terrible clod; premises 
 beloved in pity and name but none do 
 you know before.-- Walt, somebody is 
 about nothing 
 when
