Angry To Slight, 

 Which she must lose her "purl," licence still; 
 Or ever mock her. The rose has blushing inferiority! 
 Because the goddess paws. Blues is still a lifetime. 
 She pinscher and fights to see him until he decline, 
 When she lay, Bunch, his terrors were numbered, 
 An' O His memory he will answer, because he lived, 
 He sings the wine for gain he is old; 
 A little smear of tar and corn a Swan. 
 I don't know how
