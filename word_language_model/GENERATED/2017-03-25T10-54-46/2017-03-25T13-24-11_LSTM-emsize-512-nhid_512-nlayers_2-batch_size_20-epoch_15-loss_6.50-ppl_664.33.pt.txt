For This Gatherings, 

 First, and the forms. * 
 
 The chicks came, and the old child 
 beat like a tournament, almost back 
 to the Lower church of Spayne. 
 Mazes there always shows their boots, 
 over silhouette in their wide arms over the yellow 
 roots of leaves. 
 
 The shoes like an abandoned insect 
 a city rising or feet 
 and both legs float in green, 
 will blow the messages back to tree. 
 And now their dark bats
