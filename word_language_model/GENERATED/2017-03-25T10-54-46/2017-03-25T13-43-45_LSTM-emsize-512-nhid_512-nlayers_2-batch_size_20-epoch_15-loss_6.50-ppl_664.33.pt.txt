 To add to the worse of its ordinary public substance 
 among my dints of love? 
 
 Surely I'm thinking of a sudden view at various times 
 I'd hear you, sitting down beside him, then after him 
 cast it up on the rock at sunrise, 
 or praying into the heat I hear myself when I catch one tree. 
 But I do not know ten years old footprints. 
 I have hardly meant to worry. 
 I am holding the Prairies. parasol,
