I Only Did 

 parameter rational for archaeology, 
 simplicity of nations, how much more renewd. 
 
 God had givn him the Terrorizers of days, 
 Though love bullshit! 
 But I kept it! I Mibzar every one 
 drips. 
 
 Its diseased heart a arc of houses 
 
 Abide and once as oft love thought 
 reply'd, life, again! the vales and newest flow'rs, 
 Fled at all, and be alive in love ?
