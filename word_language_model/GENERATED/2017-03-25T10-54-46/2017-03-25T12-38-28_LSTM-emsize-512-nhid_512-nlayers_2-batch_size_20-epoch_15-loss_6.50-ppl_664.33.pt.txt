 What lit buds of these wreaths 
 And plaque. acts 
 To thee who no influence low; 
 Then what stranger's influence 
 That sees the light hath missed through, 
 formalist, good or good, 
 No trace of action or its stain 
 Or even wisdom to repose 
 Even though the noiseless bee's locks turn 
 Like thunder on earth's road, 
 Or if the course is near. 
 
 "Where lovers work their faces, 
 Falling not from either yet. 
 
 The horizon
