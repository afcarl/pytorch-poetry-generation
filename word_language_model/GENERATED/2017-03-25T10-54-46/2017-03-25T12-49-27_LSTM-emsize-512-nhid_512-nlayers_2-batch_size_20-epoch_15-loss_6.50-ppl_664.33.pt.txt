Alike 

 You might hear at last your eyes so close, 
 Your hanging education on your back, 
 
 lissome trucker--checkered bright soldiers on my knees, 
 "Your sons. coming-- you faint, 
 They Kal-Kan, each battels with a tunnel on your side, 
 Or Aeon at the seashore, in the slush of peas, 
 You were rude alone or not, I lose you, diadem 
 Lodi, song, put through, beating us down. 
 It tastes good now today, high in page 
 
 Of stunning happiness
