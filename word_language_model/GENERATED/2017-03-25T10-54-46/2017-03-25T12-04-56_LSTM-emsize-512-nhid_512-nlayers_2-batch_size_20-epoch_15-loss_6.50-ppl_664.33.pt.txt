Dog-Like, Finger To A Word 

 No tear, 
 The whole sea of the valley, 
 autre, lightning, commands 
 hoar-glittered and kindling, see, father, 
 sohte eggs pounding 
 The method of the Thankfully amount. 
 As yonder wrecks strewn slowly above 
 The Missing of impassioned sun-beams 
 
 To cleared; vanished cinemas, 
 gravedigger 
 Turns to her tyme, 
 O'er her hanging coarse humanists; 
 Said very proud of her mouth, 
 Huun, warp canvas. 
 We knew best too still 
 Am these
