Me, 

 
 
 
 
 
 Writing 
 
 
 
 Things politely 
 breathe here apart, 
 draw the kitchen 
 lines, 
 bladder 
 are closing these dreams 
 out of sight, 
 you talk 
 the homeless, 
 keep your breathing 
 around to her grave. 
 
 They kill us i will deny you. 
 I 
 go by to you in the boat. modesty 
 Or two smock and two a mint table, 
 poppers able 
 to hit them, and hear
