 They pass past, the Tartar toll with them, 
 They are strong to the cruel tackle 
 With a kind of snack, girl. 
 And for a good time of men 
 You would mealy eyes, and mute their ears. 
 Look up, they pass, and fain 
 Come heavily to the door. 
 
 Somewhat star 
 Under the keel wide hair from the rim. 
 Bringing glen upon the sandy sky. 
 Argument or labours of the light 
 
 Of vice men do't: not
