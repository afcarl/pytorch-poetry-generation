 
 We're dreaming, mild, at dawn too more! 
 
 
 
 
 
 afterward? 
 
 
 There is no point when men or women love. 
 What as an avalanche control; 
 Mind no such doom, no lightning, how do you want? 
 And while the trouble consign; 
 Now the black shoulder, and the ear 
 Is painted in the face of the wind! 
 And, glad self, you know not how, 
 I know the perfect fruit within me. 
 
 I swear
