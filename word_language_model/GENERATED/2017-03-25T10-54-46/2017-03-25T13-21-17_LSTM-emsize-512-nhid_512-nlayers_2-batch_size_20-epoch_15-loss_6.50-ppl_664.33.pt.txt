To Come Downtown 

 age-thick and forgotten from our grave, 
 And Khalil at our laps, and tighten 
 Our doom in each, 
 
 When I think of it the cells, the soul? 
 For I have flown with my mouth away 
 And race and luck be come again. 
 
 I've heard it in the making;enough house in street 
 And Saint --itch, that I am thought. 
 shire-tree heal, and break rang'd with shadow, 
 midge-tormented bones on the sun. 
 I sing great
