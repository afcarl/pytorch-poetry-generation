 
 The lines of beauty filled with injury of oar 
 
 And evening gay, a drenched eternal green 
 
 Ran like a bowl. The flashlight. 
 
 Is it relations. 
 
 There was never the one thing that dies in motion, 
 
 And unseen, softens egg and meridian, 
 
 And the devil. rural beauty still strange. 
 
 IV. THE balcony, 
 
 A grille of a hidden man, the last Counsel arm, 
 
 A hundred pennies and two longings go
