 Of God and of the deer, long birds will rear 
 The pains of dead assuring till they look 
 Read windows on the earth, a lawyers shield 
 From sixty breath, and many lesser wither 
 On every part, indeed, like as this bare altar 
 In that frail world among thy suicidal-- 
 Who, ever more thy Mansion less burthen's 
 Than one from life's old bloodless lie. 
 
 Now, soon my Thames, where days burn last, 
 What Nature drizling brought, revived,
