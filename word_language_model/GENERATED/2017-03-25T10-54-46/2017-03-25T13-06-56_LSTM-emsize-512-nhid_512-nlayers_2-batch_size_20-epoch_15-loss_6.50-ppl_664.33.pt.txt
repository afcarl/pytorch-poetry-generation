Of Houses 

 And then sound of glasses and dismay, 
 bland scattered bones of blackening seas of pride. 
 
 I know how echoes are you? 
 I must squeeze our ties and make the new. 
 Once, in the fine cheekbones on the deck, in the frosty moon 
 It is like so many passages 
 An artist called elaborate. goldarn 
 Like a flakes of grass looking. Thank arrow, 
 Just as he plucked down on the front, from Cub! 
 mitochondria curved between houses
