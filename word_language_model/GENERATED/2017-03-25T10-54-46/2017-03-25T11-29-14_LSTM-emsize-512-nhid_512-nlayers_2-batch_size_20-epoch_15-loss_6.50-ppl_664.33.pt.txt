They Have In Them. 

 
 "But what can this heaven be alone 
 If what I am in sleeping three-pronged 
 What I have none, who can be alive for death. 
 Not the sun in its dell of berries 
 Wherein there is no human being, where rain, 
 Its jewel. 
 Hark! what the heats and swell of Death, 
 The bud itself is placed into a boat, 
 The lightning dreams the song--how maimed, with get? 
 On flaming Dons lakes above left bushes.
