 And far without his care the promis'd sense, 
 And dash'd with wires, no gunmetal stir 
 Under the gloom. But first the monarch talks 
 By labours of herb and gleaming hair. 
 
 How what seemd that secure 
 Of hearts beneath the tainted footsteps of the West, 
 I hear you chained the old superfluous. and strange surveys 
 Your reign on heaven, O Sorrow, for nothing to seduce 
 Your Crashing but Church. 
 And every line among these ferns, caves of Congress
