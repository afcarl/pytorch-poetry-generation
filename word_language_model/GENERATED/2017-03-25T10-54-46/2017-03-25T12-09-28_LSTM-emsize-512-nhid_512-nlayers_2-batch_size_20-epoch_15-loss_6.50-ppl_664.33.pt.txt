Downcast Eyes 

 In Queene, and Durban beyond the night, 
 Coverd, but wisely dwindled to you, 
 Too soon get to have known: the laud 
 Of my opinion is only...If 
 
 The sweet, low girl, nearly put on stones 
 Into the Columbine, the Summer's drop. 
 
 Here's now, 
 The war was yet there, full of the sky 
 A rock, a clinch a sleep: 
 Friendly or sick, or if a stifled fly. 
 How warm was the sun! 
 But, tonight
