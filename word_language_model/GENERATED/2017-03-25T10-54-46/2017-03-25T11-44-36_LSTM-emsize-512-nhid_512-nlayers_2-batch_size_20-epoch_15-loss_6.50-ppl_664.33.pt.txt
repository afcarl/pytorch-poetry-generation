Ranks, Thel. Town. 

 
 So long and I turned warm and burst into one carousel. 
 And then then soon clomb in a soft vase, there was no knowledge in my female quarto 
 The aggressions at the door hissed and the heart of my apartment 
 I am alive once, there is no village of my human body. 
 
 But I tell that what you want of you? And the song 
 Of morning parted about my eyes, come right. 
 It was so long
