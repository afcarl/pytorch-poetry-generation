 of the melody I believed 
 to sleep the night, just as it was, 
 with your lifted finger 
 and Mother wove him 
 this child the sickness of fathers scratches 
 your close to the same inside. 
 
 You saw a model of heorudreore/; 
 God had taken the single kind 
 on your way again! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 abandoned: 
 
 
 for doom. 
 
 
 
 The Healing 
 
 Six mile harmony, 
 the old pot
