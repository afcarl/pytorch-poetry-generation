Away It. 

 
 
 
 
 
 Hail, History of Africa 
 
 
 The world is won with measure 
 if death be written 
 
 by a flash of dissolving offerings. The gold 
 
 is not anchored 
 upon being BBC in a row: 
 
 except one lover 
 
 So what can I? 
 
 
 3 
 
 This is the beginning I am 
 
 In the sunlight 
 
 reading 
 
 
 a state of palm.
