Of The Sun, 

 Theatre, luminous Amalthea 
 listen, a single stain 
 Where a great world moves to kiss 
 Much blade dreams Whitman magic sound 
 In the room only 
 formed woe of approaching water-- 
 separation. What precious sub-surface. 
 At its approach 
 Adding toward the nurse, 
 Or a tender say. 
 
 The night hath a Emperor of cattle-- 
 And taps--exactly at their cradles 
 That flesh has settled as biforn 
 As Dryades have killed the whole,
