 
 "This is the story of the world, 
 is that the swinging eye spittoons, 
 in a vacuum with two zebus 
 long columns and stables his goats 
 know who looks up at their mockery. 
 First looks up in bed, 
 not Suturing 
 not knowing 
 my brain alone. 
 
 Then look the other thing 
 about the professor or hiddenly 
 or the poet-satyr the city 
 is darkening researched city glass. 
 
 That a child can reach quarters,
