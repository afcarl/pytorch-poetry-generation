Some Reddish-Gold, 

 Raised by the fatal frontier, thought 
 At scenes and renew. The Wilderness 
 Of dead men hammered on a subway strand, 
 Began to tame them from the dance to fro, 
 While beggar-poet flew alway. 
 
 Next night I heard it drawing tone: 
 Like words that sleeps. 
 
 While the violets flew upon the bars, 
 Went up and down, hot bolts of blown 
 Adown waves of houses. Then they march 
 Upon the shadow in the dashed be'ind
