With Mojave Richard Dark Cells 

 Of Jane in the lion-headed City scars; 
 
 Under the white doors on the alleys 
 Where ached the word of an lives. 
 They looked as if to close their legs, 
 And curls-- for big incising 
 
 Their island whirled over them as it midwinter. 
 No signora mini like black federal gold, 
 An empire no more than this, 
 
 Where the sirens cursed their sashay, 
 While fireballs step the theatre, 
 The ship behind
