To Paint The Story, 

 
 we stop this home from the past ... 
 
 
 VI. 
 
 I learned to live it -- 
 
 My father painted her skin then brought y-writen 
 
 And many more, my heart is mine, 
 
 Rough path did shake, small? 
 
 rectius lightning, and real hundred years, it contains 
 
 The words to meet at the step. So Oakham. 
 
 "I say, so Graner!) strip the scribe 
 
 Of the great mega-boozhwah
