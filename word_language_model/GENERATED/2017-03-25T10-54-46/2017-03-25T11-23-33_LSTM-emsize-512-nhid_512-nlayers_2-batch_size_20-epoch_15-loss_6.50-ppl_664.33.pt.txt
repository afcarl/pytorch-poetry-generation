And A Mist 

 Went out and down like its vines, 
 An arm, up South and scorching 
 To Heaven like the warm rains which it is-- 
 And a pause, that community. 
 The heresy I prospective 
 It does as soon as you go. 
 
 Snake shall I be Sweeneys for you. 
 Of reaches and by one 
 From the same pride, sick peace ... 
 I am waiting 
 To do but if I can't. 
 Though never 
 be saying that
