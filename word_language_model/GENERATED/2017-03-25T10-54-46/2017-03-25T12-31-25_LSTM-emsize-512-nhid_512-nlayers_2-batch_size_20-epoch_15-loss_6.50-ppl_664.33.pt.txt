Ways. 

 
 Dear Bless questioning here, get done with sweet notes I embrace Beauty 
 and eat my lovely mind in short ankle brownish 
 sake? The Oh Bowscale-tarn have you abyden your Hebrew plot. 
 
 And instead of declare this mistake. 
 In your voyage in the bystander let me cross off 
 stairs. Clear afternoon, 
 I walk the back-- and catapult hot eyes rain-wet in winter. 
 I dream the lamp of my mother lying there still no part in her garden?
