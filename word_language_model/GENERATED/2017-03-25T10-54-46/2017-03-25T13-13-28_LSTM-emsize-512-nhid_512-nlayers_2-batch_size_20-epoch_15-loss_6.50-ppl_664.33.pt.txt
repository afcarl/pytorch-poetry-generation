Indoors. A Crusade 

 Of Beloved I exist in a sycamore, with my girlfriend's son 
 blood-smeared black 
 
 But I may imagine this response. 
 These are the navy, 
 O' which they are not more: 
 The whole is seal'd: Sit on some, 
 So towering Products own, all union? 
 hea't then, do ! 
 
 Then look like daylight going by, 
 Sat over every corner with the mercy, 
 Son of floppies, used-up, 
 
 zipper 
 columns, smokestacks, 
 Half marks
