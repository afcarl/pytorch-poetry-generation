Past The Ladies Sound 

 Of insane women withered into light; 
 Like some boats some profound form we went, 
 In wintry snow a little while, 
 Upstairs, the red-faced statues for the pipe, 
 And stalks them dry, anger puff 
 Under with starlight on the sea, 
 The rustic marble story. 
 
 Behind them falls, beyond children's men, 
 Their petals march on empty plains 
 Instead of snowy shade, 
 Tree! 
 farming men and god stood under them, 
 Weaves sounds deeper
