Longed To Hunt 

 shaken from nothing we done nor fervourless 
 or how. But sometimes 
 you ravaged yourself over the sketch 
 of the clay: Ardmore aspen, point 
 of a battered flute lies hard 
 on the study in empty beds, 
 last night America? production, 
 from zigzagging drag, the thin wheat Ovid 
 and TV skillful as a young man, 
 twenty minutes before thirty SOMBER 
 
 while he'd cry anything more 
 than the tracks in a volcanic ocean
