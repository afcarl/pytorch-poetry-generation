For Order, So To Weep 

 It will longer drink into hair 
 But crown the points of psychic storm 
 Long open, but not for pretty weather. 
 
 
 
 
 
 In New tyme, 
 
 
 Today your brother must not cease 
 
 Any doubt for me 
 
 He knows about time, written. He watches himself 
 
 in and out with his 
 
 wings, one Aquitaine 
 
 commodore on his side. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The River
