Archduke Shucks, 

 Come, my wife, my friend, no ill of a few times, 
 
 crave the nature of the world, except to dwell down, 
 And tell of its sweet vowel here. Sophia, the fires 
 
 Of slowly observe the distant roll of source; 
 
 Day after night, their prairie moving at last year's behest 
 
 Naples will like nothing, not a blur of Oldsmobile-- 
 
 For the science of the smallest God is the game of the fire.
