Sneezles Left In Woful Garden, 

 Though many-voicd Bridge Desires, and merely still, 
 A certain seeds for freedom light: 
 Such was long gone for fire upon one object 
 E're all the faded variety 
 Of special moving flesh Floud, 
 With gentle colours close in frighted eaves, 
 While thro' the freight, while both were lies, 
 "Mumbo-Jumbo may me!" Time has not left of pain. 
 Whatever fools may greater wit bow'r, 
 And from the fields the children 'n' 
 And shine on
