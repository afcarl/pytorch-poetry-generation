A Day 

 10:18 old waterspouts. 
 Blue slumber in June 
 Bringing little wisdom. 
 Walking for self-rejection 
 (The tide just opens on the corner of us 
 With so small flash of sun 
 
 It will always be briefcases 
 like a luminous--its can, 
 stares at us, a kind of comprehension 
 holding that movie is true. 
 
 31st evening, 
 verbal commonality in unnumbered 
 rotting room above the piteous, 
 to be destroyed by unvariegated 
 
 ***
