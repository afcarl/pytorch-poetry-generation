 
 "With sick flesh and pilgrims and warbling earliest 
 
 I wake to the room where I graveyard: 
 
 And wake me up on the track, each day 
 
 Is pale, and may be sung I should be as free 
 
 And weep down to be behold, 
 
 dell; and by my songs I bleed in sorrow. 
 
 
 IV. 
 
 One light behind me like a growth, I felt for Overnight 
 
 With something misplaced? a loyal sight
