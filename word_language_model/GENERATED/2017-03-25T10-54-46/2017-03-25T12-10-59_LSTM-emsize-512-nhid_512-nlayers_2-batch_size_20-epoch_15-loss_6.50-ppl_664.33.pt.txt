Perrill 

 carrie in patience, through the salt stone, 
 Living and kill, 
 With arms washing to the University, 
 When leaning the trumpet from the hill. 
 
 The Sound of ivory trembles in all wind? 
 There's a treasure all the song 
 And goes low to the fiendish bed 
 And under a cloud of foam, 
 An mustaches, rumba 
 Beneath its high ants? 
 Drunk amid the columns of unthankfulness, 
 As the monotonous constant particles of things. 
 
 I hear
