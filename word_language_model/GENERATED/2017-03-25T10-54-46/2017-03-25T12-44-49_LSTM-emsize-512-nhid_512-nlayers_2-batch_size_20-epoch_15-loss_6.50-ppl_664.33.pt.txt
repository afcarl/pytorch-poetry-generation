To Feed The Room. 

 
 Do they have reach'd like words, they rise wood-grainy 
 shops, arms fall, turn seeds from the bases 
 And look all over a cloud in glory, 
 accept. We stand on the brick bone 
 Toward the thick flats of parks, What delight 
 thief--pretty!-- out of Euphrates spiders. 
 
 Wandering most of us with shoulder: 
 Like sulphur twisted in the gap, 
 The nudding. restored, dresses of a shadow-- 
 Also, while they stroll and wheat striplings
