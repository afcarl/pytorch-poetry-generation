Of Atoms Happie: 

 the lips of the dying rushing of people's eyes 
 untied, and cherished all the familiar earth. 
 
 
 
 
 
 A Description of Eden, 
 
 
 As we stand home you mount, up drug and ice, 
 Fire and rain beads, a single day. 
 High is the noontide village we swim 
 In the automobile, virgin up, 
 Things are expressed but by another thing, 
 And not ours in this world in sicknesses, 
 her--princess, need funny mean
