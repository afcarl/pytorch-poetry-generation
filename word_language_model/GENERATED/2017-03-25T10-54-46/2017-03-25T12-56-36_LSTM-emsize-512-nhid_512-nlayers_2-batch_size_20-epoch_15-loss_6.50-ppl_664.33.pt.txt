 Let us go forth, while strides-- 
 Whilst even the stars lit out, dear lass, 
 And the ghostly reckoning slay, 
 Betwixt the Red ruins, and unheard Moo, 
 We bathe my chamber into the skies, 
 And childs and rose; full of oar unpeels 
 Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, boom. 
 Drinking gold and know-how, 
 Blood quivers, swelling unstable. 
 
 The southeast gate, transparency, 
 The gun; night lulled you 
 When the Bride game of June 
 Moloch! South earth, miscall ashes,
