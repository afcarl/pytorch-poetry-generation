I Nearly Yout. 

 I mean long enough to make it choice 
 dead--their lovers to marry. 
 
 I wouldn't sleep here, lick his tears. 
 My heart of tissue slurs to Phidias 
 leatherbound vendors 
 
 Pointing, waist-high baroquely 
 drippings, fingernails, the front rises: 
 Three minor hand: the one, ill Gunga 
 In late place, the color of feathering blood. 
 
 13 
 All these are in this dim midmost Isolation: 
 And sound of the plans of life and by day,
