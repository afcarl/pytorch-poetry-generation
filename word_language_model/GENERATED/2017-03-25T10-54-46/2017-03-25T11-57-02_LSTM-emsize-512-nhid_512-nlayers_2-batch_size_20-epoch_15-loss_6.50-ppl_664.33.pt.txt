In The Folca, Immanent. 

 If he'll let his drunken Sir bauble spare 
 
 With Mr. candied Dominus and whip him up upon the margins 
 Of Mars, to suffered; himself, or scared. 
 
 That night I worked on my Northern shore 
 That did not last, like a sweet bird at last 
 Will freeze his kind, or let him know, my brother: 
 They shout through focused, dark and trellised sides, 
 In one case, the flowers' pride, his health.
