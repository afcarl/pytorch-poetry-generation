Be Reserves 

 The couch of a girl washed her worksheets 
 Far from me, no more than a fluttering dream-- 
 
 Now. 
 The woman on a dwindling revolution, 
 
 Were sketched beyond birds, 
 That leaves and prisoners: soon lies work. 
 
 The nights of her beauty had a axe, 
 Each song a crow. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Unholy Summer 
 
 
 The poet 
 
 He beat the house 
 Among amaretti family, 
 And the fountain already
