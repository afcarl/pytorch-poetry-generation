That On The World 

 The globe bespeak thy forehead shall descend, 
 Curs'd not for leave its baked trump and cry: 
 O'er death a chaste veil. Let him weep like this, 
 Then keep beneath the brow of praise. 
 
 I think I lived myself now, in my sleep 
 I heard these sorrows when I lifted them, 
 They were my oldest--he "Take them watch, 
 But I was very weak in day; 
 And died of fire, without a death, 
 With Mercy
