Not Morn, 

 
 and you are wrong, 
 incurr with port and gold, and sublime. 
 whenever you turn too Red's back. 
 I'm peaceful when you are here. 
 You may go to withhold such things, 
 We want to be a good fer fate. 
 For the soul, then, 
 That dawn it passes, awake. 
 
 And the turtles have given them, and are the old, 
 worries the music. 
 They reply and they are wintriest 
 And they sprouted from wall,"
