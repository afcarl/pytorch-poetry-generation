 All day long in the dark and night 
 In the cool river, 
 Singing and red in the moonless light, 
 For Christ he well does sun. 
 
 My clavicle on the twilight shore 
 (His scales, I tip and sing 
 The ghost of this sad flower, 
 Much than I choose my home: 
 And more of boys I lie so strongly 
 To live in this delight of friends, 
 That I should wish but ruin and my English. 
 
 Hard
