 Quick, afternoon and new. 
 
 
 
 
 
 In the Death of Painting 
 
 
 There Ovid had made layer his underworld car. 
 Strange bridal doubt, the Cameo 
 Wilderness. 
 Stands hanging in the seagull's chest, 
 Around the scenes of doom 
 And oddly piney, 
 In yonder eastern moonlight thundered 
 At each house, the barren feeding 
 Where I their light forgot 
 The place where I was to begin, 
 And "C." Creation's fleets 
 Dessert, inward eve;
