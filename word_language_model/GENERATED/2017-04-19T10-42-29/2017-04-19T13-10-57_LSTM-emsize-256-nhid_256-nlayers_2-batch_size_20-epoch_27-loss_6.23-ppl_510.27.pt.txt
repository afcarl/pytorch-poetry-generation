 it fell toward which we ceased; 
 like a piercing Lamentation: 
 When the cart are shaped were no fear of the night 
 though never was. 
 
 
 
 Rocks tongue indigo green and coolah, 
 Stuffed Schweinhund tree: 
 bend at the spider fishes. 
 It's only the wrathful gift 
 of the dead travel the world's believed over 
 the carcass of adolescent entrances 
 the primary and the trucks are silent. 
 We could steal down, stay briefly old. 
 
 Away
