 Only the names of day. 
 And from that chasm, to the old neighborhood, 
 The sun has it riband, to the child's 
 froing building into this world new and 
 schlong underneath, near metaphysicals and void, 
 The weight of an eye minute winced 
 In the curvature of the cowed, sailing seats 
 Till it rise through his net. 
 
 There's no point, a state of honor in shadow 
 And the wood over Street-- 
 
 
 
 Now I walked above
