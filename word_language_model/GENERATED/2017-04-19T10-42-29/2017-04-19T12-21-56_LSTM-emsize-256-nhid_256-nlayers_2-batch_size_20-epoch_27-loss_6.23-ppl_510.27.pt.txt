To The Minnows, Parian Fly. 

 You smoked but singing, through Diana's sails, 
 Smiling and dark, even at my call, 
 They'd been afar what it really has made of you. 
 I do?) your sentences and spongy skin and hover, 
 Were filled with jelly bamboo, no pulping of flight, 
 The leader is still a-flying; 
 And the sabbath and the base shrill, 
 Go twelve years to drill without 
 Them and be not born for, though I know my attempt 
 To lift
