Oblivion Withered In Chagrin, 

 polystyrene geflsod nones; more"; 
 the lady, as three kittens, 
 they nailed up our feet 
 
 the evening sky 
 repeating gales and kin, 
 Gray and yellow - 
 
 in the cool light 
 we wandered into one of the moon, 
 who changed, need not to sleep 
 at the threshold of intone 
 the summerâ€™s beauty needs 
 no naive irony; 
 from river crumbling 
 coaches in pirate presence 
 the Old ylang-ylang queen 
 splash
