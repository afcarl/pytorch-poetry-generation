Its Vacant Terrors 

 
 Like a marvel of courage, 
 With swarming blood 
 Or razor plants 
 Or black-backed on the verge 
 of the deep, trees: 
 maybe the ceilings. 
 
 
 
 
 
 the Physics Evening, 
 
 
 Mankind o boy! It hath two points of finance Attenuate talks steadily 
 at the terminal ship 
 rising 
 through a rain beginning 
 
 The most solid pickles of glass sweats sideways in grove and rain; 
 the Brooms
