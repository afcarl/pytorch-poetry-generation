Jagged 

 
 And long poured of brown buckets 
 And falling on the blowing pavement 
 The flowered cliffs couttyard--my 
 
 And the bronze, fresh, the birds, the storm. 
 
 
 12 
 
 The passion of pirate spirits 
 Is adjusts itself through way.... 
 My fingers blunted on invisible 
 blossom. 
 A light of various fathers 
 Hung over the fern beans 
 wheeling with shot wings. 
 Rapid scarred one, 
 line, 
 tap the tail of your right hand
