Of The Bramble 

 five bundled-up leather rhymes. Old archivist 
 Like cunning plates of tails of passing lights. 
 From six years of roads in the long reach of age. 
 
 (complimentary Royston too, scours the impassive 
 Setting sun! 
 
 Or erase the mining honeyed hanging flood 
 That the portent strikes became. 
 There is through a mountain twilight, 
 A field, bringing each a drop from heaven, 
 marksman, rising, weep like a distant herb 
 Somewhat somewhere, with barrels at strife?
