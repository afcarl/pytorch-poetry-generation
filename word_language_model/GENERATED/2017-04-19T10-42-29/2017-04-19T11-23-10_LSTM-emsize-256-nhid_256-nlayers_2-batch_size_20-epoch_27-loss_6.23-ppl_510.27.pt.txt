Meg 

 By looking at each waking 
 And and traveled far off one knee on my zinc 
 Hector and a leaves.We 
 Breathes his portrait in my head 
 And broke the cold swan on his head. 
 
 God bless it, that long and goodly 
 I set it in closed ear, and when the hell interposed 
 His throat went for it . . . . . 
 It's here that I sent. I can't, 
 Love is rock? my eyelids seat of stare;
