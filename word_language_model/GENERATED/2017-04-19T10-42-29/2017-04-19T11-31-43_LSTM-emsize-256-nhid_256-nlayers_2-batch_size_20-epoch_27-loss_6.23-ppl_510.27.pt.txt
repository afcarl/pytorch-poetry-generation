 leaving some other extra 
 men, keep these lip-synching 
 
 or to poor gather and not interest the supreme 
 wish in their bravery and images. The lies of it, 
 so always, to hold the seasons. 
 
 One tugging leaf, a beard goes filled with groceries 
 and squints to Kuanon where it sleet over.

 Though these are the names I always know 
 that one on which we sell decks in suburbs
