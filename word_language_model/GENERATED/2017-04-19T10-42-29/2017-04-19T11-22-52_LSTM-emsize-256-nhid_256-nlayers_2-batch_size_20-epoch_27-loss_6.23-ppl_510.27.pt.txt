 We can look at us, with foam here, 
 And may my creatures fill the aisles, 
 Though with some determined folks I canâ€™t mar. 
 Thy anger fail to practice thee. 
 
 
 
 From the memories of the sparrows in the grave 
 Ere we hailed a city under questioned, 
 Over palm and leader something Lebanon. 
 
 Whispered dormitory worth on an old man's name! 
 And Infected as the Khalifa on the glass, 
 Feel broken sunlight, and from the English.
