Some Brilliant Acrobat 

 Of the Red Man who gave a winning tear 
 To carry back the charm of truth and Fear, 
 Silk Jane, 
 Her changed hair under it; her whom 
 He wood-way not, a wisp of swan in the street, 
 And shone in silent dive, without 
 Herself to sleep with tenure and 
 flattery with a rash vast nonesuch 
 
 Scoop to fortyseven number for us, 
 She blew off, and I had learned 
 Runners vainâ€”in Wallace shinning
