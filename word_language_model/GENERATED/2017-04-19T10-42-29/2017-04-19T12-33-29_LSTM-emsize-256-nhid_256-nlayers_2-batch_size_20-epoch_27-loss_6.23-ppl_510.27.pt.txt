Oop Up From The Mouth 

 To meet the waves grass, waits, compasses 
 Haunted by centuries, twilight 
 candidacy while verdict still 
 Be filial given, 
 But somewhere, or that rending, 
 They seem, or die; again. 
 Only a man 
 Can turn away in death's night; 
 (Second canyon: 
 As blood curling as 
 A distended fly, 
 Comeback in a net, 
 And still unofficially. 
 
 herringbone 
 Wasting of middlebrow, 
 Freedom for the sparrow 
 And the amaranths leaps
