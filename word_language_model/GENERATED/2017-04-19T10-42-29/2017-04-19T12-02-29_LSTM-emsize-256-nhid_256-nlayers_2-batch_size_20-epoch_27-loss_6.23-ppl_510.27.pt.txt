 
 
 In the exaggerated joy of a dream 
 it please something himself, 
 leaving silver, 
 
 
 A marble produce has been content 
 by the texture and the bedrooms 
 is known when life holds itself like 
 
 though spring doesn't seem . . . another 
 
 has framed life, fine as rain, 
 threads of painting into street furnished 
 as the sea sticks but the spiders. 
 
 A clock drives in coming backward, 
 which miss! Half tempts
