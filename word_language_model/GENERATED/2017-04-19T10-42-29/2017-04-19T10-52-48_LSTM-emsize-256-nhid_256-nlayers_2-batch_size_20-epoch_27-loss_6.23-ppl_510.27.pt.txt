Till Western Bone The Tide 

 of waters still and jostle 
 freaks, after small sight. 
 
 I am a star to promotions, 
 The leaves fall like the deep-sea ball, 
 and the animal ships. No more about my 
 heart I hear anyone. Let them drink the moon, 
 but once again who would a dark 
 be shorted in red with four bush; peppergrains 
 of the principal cutting photographs, the invisible, 
 and into the adult hour, are 
 my only inflouresence, though
