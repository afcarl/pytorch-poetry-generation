 
 Look hourglasses, Nothing spreads 
 Root shops, strike its wave cling to yow 
 The basement of its untorched skirling 
 Like a flurry of wrecking in sleeping wind 
 And swinging water from a blackened animal 
 Thus dark with wind bounty, 
 Begin the rapid world. 
 
 clicks with fear of morn. 
 
 O walkers of joys that erst constrain the strong, 
 Late in the heavenly back of the night, 
 mountainside. 
 Fair men do wakes ten children.
