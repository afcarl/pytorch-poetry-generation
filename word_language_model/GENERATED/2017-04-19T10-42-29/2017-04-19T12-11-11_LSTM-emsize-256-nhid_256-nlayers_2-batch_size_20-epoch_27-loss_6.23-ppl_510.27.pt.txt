Eat Without Sleep 

 
 Since I can decide some monstrous return 
 To the fate of a century named by Bus 
 A future and ruin and volumes of rest. 
 Wait well. I imagine it folded surrounded to the root, 
 'Twixt passion and bone, trucks and the houses 
 In the casual square of my stride come on, 
 And the people of New York holidays The night 
 Poynaunt and cards by song and some of them, 
 And down the valley, fallen plates
