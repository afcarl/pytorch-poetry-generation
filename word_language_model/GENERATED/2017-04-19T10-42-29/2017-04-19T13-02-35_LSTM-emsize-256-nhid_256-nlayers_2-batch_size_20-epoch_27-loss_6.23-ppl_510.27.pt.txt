Rolled In An Empty Glass 

 Whirling and carried in the puddle. 
 No man comes but to be at all machines. 
 She's all that pear! the signs of remembering 
 And that so saddle did it matter 
 Before the host in the next word. 
 So all his deaths, so much the river 
 Was held 
 That nothing's up in every dry sky 
 Whose yellow increases where eager he wears; 
 (Whose dim-conceived grace, and Whyte) 
 Such dim-conceived grasses wheeled their keys
