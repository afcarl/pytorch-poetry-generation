 
 At finding how 
 To neer caught in 
 A jaundiced door. 
 
 The candle in hardest. 
 The theory let fall 
 Without a point, 
 Which waits for a thoughtful, belief, 
 His heart with stretches made Real. 
 At it the webs of the lobster 
 Is spotted with brown blue Dounhaddin' 
 (vi) and deep, 
 
 On the third Malvern nest 
 Leaning on the ringing oval 
 Of water down to the poetsâ€”the 
 familiar-- then bald and sea.
