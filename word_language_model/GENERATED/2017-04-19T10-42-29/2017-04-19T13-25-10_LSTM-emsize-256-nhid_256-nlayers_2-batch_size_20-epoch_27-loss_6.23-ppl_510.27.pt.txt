Else Is Stepping Down 

 the finest woolly body works out on his throat. 
 How can I put this and drink ... 
 Keep in the air. 
 
 
 
 
 I wake up at a sick day; 
 The floating clock breaks out 
 
 And the highest sky a groan, 
 An occupation I would only brush 
 Some weight out of the house by early boughs 
 Awhile in the water now, no question behind me. 
 I have been reduced to it,
