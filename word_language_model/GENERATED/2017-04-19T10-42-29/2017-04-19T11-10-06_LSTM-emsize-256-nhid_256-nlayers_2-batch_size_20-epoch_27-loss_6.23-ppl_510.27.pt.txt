The Place You No 

 Archeological there would be 
 lost men as a Nun we endured 
 
 slack fifteen years singing 
 so sewing the faintest 
 set places into scrape 
 & put the hair ODE 
 
 and when it broke swimming 
 in the flurries we had to be to glue 
 escape the wing and plump 
 and opens;only something 
 called adorn with our mouths.
