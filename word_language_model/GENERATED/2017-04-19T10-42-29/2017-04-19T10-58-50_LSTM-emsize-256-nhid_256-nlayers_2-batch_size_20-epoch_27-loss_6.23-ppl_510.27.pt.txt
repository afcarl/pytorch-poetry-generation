Of Strife, 

 
 All this know here King normal quaking, 
 A pallid master and a price; 
 And toward sunset the longing 
 Drew up all the prophetic hungers 
 of all its own mothers. 
 Which you are dead and don't know what it seemed, 
 
 Do you anything like to wish, really? 
 
 Because it is easy to surround you and laugh 
 When you're done again 
 
 Always it is still dexterity 
 
 And that out of darkness it's
