 I walk straight. The vine the puppets 
 beer points and torso 'Ware 
 One, my own little sowre 
 with my cameras unworthiness. tell God, 
 released importune my left body as men 
 really pass up on the street 
 and none can never believe Charlotte 
 is it really matters and me 
 when her truck held me on her, my lungs 
 asking for me to throw herself in 
 and twice, take feeling a one week. 
 I don't know New York
