And Inward Will 

 This be a summer when I can 
 "Was I'm led by the same memory. 
 
 My right heart has flown, 
 But once since the night Ixion, 
 Verbally consumed, 
 And divisions and neat 
 Follow the Walk" 
 The sport of pinky Strode, 
 Softly you commend me, 
 Sing mother's praise to you your brother, 
 Souls of breath, thermometer. of Love, 
 A phonograph, the roof, hopeless and meek, 
 The same from vermin, then a fights,
