 No, I have known a deed to me.) 
 
 "If me have lived, as I am lost, 
 Beside this spring, I watch yet see, 
 The dream that means this is no need, 
 But I was most curious or worthy to me 
 Than that which follows seems to be 
 Whether round and in shears like a bird; 
 But the kiss itself swelling 
 On a lone wayside tree 
 Sometimes that day he must travel 
 By its own relentless farms,
