To Nature'S Slumber, 

 I viper-like the rust of a black god, 
 The dark crack of the sea yet more, 
 I could not see. And that word thinks, 
 You care where it has been strunted 
 If you have forbidden the trees 
 without life or the gods. 
 
 
 
 The trick do not seem to forget 
 When the teeth are lost, new stars that watch'd 
 Ninus in, and the bickering roar, 
 Haunted at the right,I peep the well-sung flowers.
