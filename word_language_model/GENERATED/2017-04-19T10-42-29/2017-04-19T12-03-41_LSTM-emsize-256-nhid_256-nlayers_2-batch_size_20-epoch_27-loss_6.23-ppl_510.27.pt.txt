 But two or three are the trees of snow 
 Is a Sunday waters, walking by the river 
 Though the intricate point, wet marble 
 Of a soft, gray bear . . . his mouth is nailed down 
 To listen this night ago, list boiled in the cold machinery, 
 And he's used all to dress behind 
 The fat woman grandchildren 
 Homer's makeshift click, 
 As courage turns the murderous nation 
 That wants to arrive at
