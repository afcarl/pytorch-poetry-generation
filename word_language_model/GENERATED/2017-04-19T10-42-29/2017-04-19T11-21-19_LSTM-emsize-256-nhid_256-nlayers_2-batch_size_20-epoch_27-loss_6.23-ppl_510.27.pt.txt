Pluck 

 With the wet lips standing and poise up here. 
 
 Hearing the leaking stem of the rest 
 and the little plot comes back to the top of the gas-oil 
 
 ritual of course 
 I prefer in me. 
 
 I gave you back. My sense are moving 
 out like men who pass livingest off. 
 They vines and jump their huge ay--the jagged 
 in black, splits. 
 rampage and deranges all! 
 Oh wild Cancer you may be smoky,
