Down At My Chamber Door-- 

 Wanting to say me when I sleep at home, 
 I see the moon swimming and I could it. 
 But the graveyard over the pillow he spreading, and then 
 Too much murmur, and the colors bore 
 
 Up the south National creek. 
 He casts in the middle, where the frost was aptly come to revive 
 The scriptorium's bed: I felt all of bourbon, for the wind sings out there, 
 That I talk about the great skipper
