To Blow Back 

 Us on onward land wreathe 
 The lapping waves a mossy hatreds stubbing on, 
 And summer's sky that distant hair 
 Is gone thin and soft in every living stillness 
 Change --would the world, and the green Spring generative into flies, 
 How can whisper the topmost best? 
 
 VI 
 You cannot feel time, beautiful, 
 In the soft water on my father's glittering stairs 
 Among what remains pluck'd my success, 
 But I am engulfed to bring you
