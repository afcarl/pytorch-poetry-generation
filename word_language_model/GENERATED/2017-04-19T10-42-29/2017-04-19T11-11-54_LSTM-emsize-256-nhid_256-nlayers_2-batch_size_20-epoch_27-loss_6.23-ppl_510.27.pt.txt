Of An Accidental Swirling Ice 

 In a house and face it sniffs 
 His mild blade, the single womb 
 I think good tonguetip, the salt shapes 
 Of pushing blossoms, the sweet wind and addressed 
 The pastoral of the white and white. 
 And who is love, forever poked his feet, 
 And hawk by open underdream he gripped 
 Thanne help Night, clotted in high composition 
 Unto a ruined tower. 
 
 "What is it death for me me, say I know
