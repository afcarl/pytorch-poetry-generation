 
 In the middle of the day 
 my family stopped dark upland clash'd the face 
 of my heart rises across this island. 
 
 wounded: openings and heather 
 glow the tight, sweet teeth 
 of despair I loafe 
 with thieves in to my rags, 
 because I work about most 
 fold around you inside it 
 but this is my tongue. 
 
 A food may feel more like a full honey 
 what happens, only 
 pretty more cold. My death
