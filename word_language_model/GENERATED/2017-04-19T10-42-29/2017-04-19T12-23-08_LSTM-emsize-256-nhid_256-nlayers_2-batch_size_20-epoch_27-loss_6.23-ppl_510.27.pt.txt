For, 

 to be found 
 
 in the morning moment 
 the water closes its shadow 
 slick and dirty 
 
 and outside 
 an imprisoned window 
 before donning and untroubled, 
 Rohrer joined by phrase. 
 Its shape is cracked, the color 
 that abides like a knife, 
 the blush of Dirty, of scrutiny 
 Dwarves faces, pirouetted 
 stacked from every wold, 
 or a fourth, and a two-piece 
 to a stupid range of a dead 
 cradling a canary--refuse from
