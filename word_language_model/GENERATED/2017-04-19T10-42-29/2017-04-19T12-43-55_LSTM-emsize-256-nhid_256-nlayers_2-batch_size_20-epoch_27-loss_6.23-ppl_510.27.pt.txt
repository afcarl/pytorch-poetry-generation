I-40 I Love It, 

 Becomes a cool blue heat, whether a man sees 
 Into a house sinking into a saint. 
 This tower with hands as he falls from flower 
 She'd be practiced breasts or skirts 
 On the wild void of the sea rising 
 Or fell divinity-- nor even tuft his eyes 
 And gone away in a valley on all this same town 
 
 Born to his voice there in my hair 
 Rising there in the jewelled glass 
 sniper's
