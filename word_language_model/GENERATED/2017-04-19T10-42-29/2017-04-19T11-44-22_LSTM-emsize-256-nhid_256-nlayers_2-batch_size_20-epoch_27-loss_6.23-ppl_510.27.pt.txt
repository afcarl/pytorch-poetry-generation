They Walk 

 Ain't dear, I've burst over-- against 
 the sun in its last torrent flow. 
 
 I want my breath to buy soon of the young meaning, 
 but I'd wait then it's good forever, we give all 
 its way to a headland resourceful, of ripe ice, 
 
 dark-hearted headlong at the beach. 
 
 2. 
 Is there much changed, 
 Nothing spreads this way, 
 but the question. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Parisian Coal 
 
 
 Change un-European
