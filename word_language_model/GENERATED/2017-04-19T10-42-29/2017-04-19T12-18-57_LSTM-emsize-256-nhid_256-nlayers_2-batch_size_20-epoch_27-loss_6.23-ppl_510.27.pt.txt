 
 And Saint Shirts has gone away! 
 His younger face is far for more, 
 No conscious man can save, 
 And his eyes have shed back; 
 Oh, the mother, born below, 
 And thought his living bird to sleep. 
 
 Then mother, then, hath a sword loud fire, 
 Come to me in my sight! 
 
 The discolored years of trumpets 
 Sighs, plain and the reaper old, 
 KÃ©eps explorer and white, 
 The wine of the warty West, 
 numbering.
