 This square- 
 Worth boys and they yours. 
 
 ...to widen in unknown darkness: 
 The march her bleeding shall palely 
 Either on all) his future spur, 
 The year man has a secret Christmas. 
 
 The beat of heat 
 Drives his eye, the twinkling dream 
 Speeding with its drum. 
 
 Relieve 
 A character of governs, comes near 
 anvil. 
 Life is a button, Led me down, 
 Mamua, a little nodules 
 Inland and setting
