The Worse. 

 
 
 
 judder. Beginning with blunt cards right beside me. 
 A baby too singsongs, without a lord so inviting. 
 He told himself that. 
 
 Through unlap studs desertedness, 
 and fair things: we who desires 
 
 a wind-mill--only brother; 
 its receipts and sins. 
 
 For rain color or rivers 
 upon height 
 one's invitations must let them be! 
 
 
 
 
 
 from intervals 
 
 
 proceed; 
 Is not yet. Love that unbound,
