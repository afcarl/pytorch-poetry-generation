Allegiances. 

 
 "Why time he madest well, 
 
 Through sharp meadows, under the shore; 
 
 Put his shield up the wrath of the dead dead, 
 
 For the wind thief! His facil word 
 
 Was a shape of prayer. 
 
 
 
 THYRSIS 
 
 The dense dismayâ€™d? smoked and tall, 
 Walking through the glass; 
 The whole day would be opened 
 Out of fact the brute of bacon man? 
 In the same first weather 
 I see myself
