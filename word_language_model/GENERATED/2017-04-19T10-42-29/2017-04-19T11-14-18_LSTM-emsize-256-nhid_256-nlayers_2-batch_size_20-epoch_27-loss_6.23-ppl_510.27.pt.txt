 
 Lest you can't nought and invention 
 For you of my harps and your hair 
 aboard the failed and the dawn 
 
 The last night we drop eddies, 
 while she is touched in hoards 
 
 * 
 
 Two country keeps good 
 Who have her lost debt suspended 
 in wet arctic faces playing 
 
 watching the damage of substances, 
 Whom all of us be cold 
 
 but in the heart at last they Looked 
 their balance
