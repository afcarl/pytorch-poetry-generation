Me In Early Grade 

 south of myself as beyond an 
 Arachne, colored boy. 
 (I do not actually understand 
 what's young 
 
 but I should like the wall. With forty-six 
 not to look at the wall. 
 
 My name is a bone kind of evening, 
 you can see the sun on the chain-link floor, 
 an outside plain of the blades. 
 
 Like the terror of my new darling--my biology 
 I am a woman in a golden hole,
