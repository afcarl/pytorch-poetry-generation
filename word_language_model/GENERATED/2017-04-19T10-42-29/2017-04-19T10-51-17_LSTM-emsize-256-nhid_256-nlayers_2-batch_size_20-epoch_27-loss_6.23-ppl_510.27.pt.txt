Said, Next Month He Wolde Have Begun. 

 To spit out the window, boy the same too young and dear, 
 I find of a confluencing, sold pendulum. 
 And the head is on the edge and the try 
 To reach me. 
 
 
 
 With you in a bed 
 we lived at table, 
 south of icy sides, 
 looked all through the rout 
 at the chimney. 
 It did not seem to go 
 for a smile; a child on someone's footbridge
