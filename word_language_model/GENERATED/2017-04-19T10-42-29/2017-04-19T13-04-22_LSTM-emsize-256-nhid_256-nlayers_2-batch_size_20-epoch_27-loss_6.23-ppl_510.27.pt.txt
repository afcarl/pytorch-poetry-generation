 Four feathers in the movin'. 
 beah Tony 
 says you folded down us 
 on the stream? I take for a dirty 
 fold lean along the flower, 
 blackened in the drab lie, little 
 desire of mood: the love 
 
 of its texts 
 seeming to come 
 very still. I'll need 
 you are shiver. 
 ready for rain and wind. 
 You have heard me something 
 unused. Do 
 you like 
 a gift for your tops. 
 We reside
