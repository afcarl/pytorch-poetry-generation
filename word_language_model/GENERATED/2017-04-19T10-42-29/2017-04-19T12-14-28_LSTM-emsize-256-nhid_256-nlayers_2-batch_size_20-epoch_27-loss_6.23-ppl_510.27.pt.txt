 
 What to say seâ€”what should we not be?" 
 Let no one pass in peace in life. 
 The signs are so bright as man knows 
 What to be sterile by shame, 
 That would be advice? 
 To Life's stock and pleasures they can. 
 
 Whenever he walks, it bounded steep, 
 Lead'st thou gay girls in Age appear. 
 
 Just to him shame in that low glass, 
 I will devise a Lamb. 
 
 They give him reason sound,
