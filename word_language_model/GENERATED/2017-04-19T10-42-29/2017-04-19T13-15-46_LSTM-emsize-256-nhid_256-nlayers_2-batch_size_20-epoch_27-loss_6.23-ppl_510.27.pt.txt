 As most as the sun turns flowers; 
 Some, with gentle fruit and tires, and clear 
 peace, and none of them ever guards their minds 
 
 Likes to break themselves my side 
 By the sunken sudden sea, or sure 
 I do not know here, 
 The world is clearly 
 wind-pipes. And the lovely lesson 
 Of moods and joys, so 
 Whose desire 
 And grow like troupe 
 Where gone-- 
 All waveless being: the cage 
 Beyond the burning masked
