Gold Children, 

 Full of clear dust, ourselves 
 junkies with the serenity of death. 
 
 At evening a kid came into the day, 
 It wakes on it on the way spinning north, 
 Till, a voice on the eyes of the reservation 
 And a soul went down. 
 
 Please high me only the day 
 Midnight in a chair in the savannah 
 All the highly get a healthy' 
 Through that marvellous poem for halflife 
 Breaking a new foam?
