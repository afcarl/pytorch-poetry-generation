 Or god in crimson prose meditating 
 From the romance of birds, the lie 
 breathy in Lake fingers sill no sill 
 means vague beneath us seamless outside 
 the thresher where the Houri winked 
 with red lamp, rock sergeant sipping 
 
 a lattice from the roof. In the body 
 darkness had heard until nevertheless 
 sank on the highway hard, like rabbit? 
 the inexplicable "She refused to drop 
 the old cord, up to the other room.
