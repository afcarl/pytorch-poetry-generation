 In broad caverns 
 thumbed, serene in Summer watches 
 Overlooking Rosa whites and 
 vetch and BLUE untouched with 
 tongue, or, covers. 
 So you'd never seen there in a fire. I went 
 my sweatshirt in my ease querulous 
 to Divine. Fox was naked halfway year 
 
 for this crevice courtier bought for oil, 
 I can never lift with (my eye?) 
 
 
 
 
 The drunk the lunatic beauty melt from, 
 The guest peeling through our heads,
