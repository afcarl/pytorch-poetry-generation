 Such a evening I've naming out the heart 
 and sings so small it must be seen. 
 
 And there's no accounting for example, 
 or the sinner of a sound

 Nothing of it is a part of the same song. 
 
 Through plumbing the sun says: Musing, it is more offenses, even 
 From its potatoes? baptized the idea of the possible world of secrecy. 
 
 In the darkness it never bowed as death--
