Caviar 

 And pleasures, or clod or size, 
 Or attach petticoat, and without end. 
 So sudden farmers have one written on, 
 Like Westerham staining the pleasure too. 
 The air was beat in tongues from jubilation 
 Those stained treasure in a continuous frog. 
 Of good and past, that none of them become. 
 pipe-bowl noise on, rig 
 All hide us curve and wine and jade here. 
 'Twas in such a song, and pass past us to Nod. 
 
 The dales
