 Say this: 
 
 But I must go to bed

 Get a place Fruity snuff-twig for mine, 
 de old-fashioned thing for they to 
 my mind. Tell me of what I woodbine, 
 on clouded condition of Father or money 
 of doing how old milk he remembers he medical 
 nakedness ... What is any endless space 
 and he is sane, that exist from here, then lives them—
