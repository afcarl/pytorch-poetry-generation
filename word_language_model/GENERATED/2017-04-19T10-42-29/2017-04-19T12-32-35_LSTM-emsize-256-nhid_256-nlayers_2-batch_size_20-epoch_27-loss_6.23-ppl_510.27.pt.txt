Me For His Stunning 

 
 Often for he'd look on. He wears the hour 
 With casting ev'ry keen daft 
 And sweetest Day dulcimer -- 
 A girl from the wall.

 Type of the mysteries. I dream of 
 A blueprint, that is murdered especially at the ending 
 Of this hotel poem that knows as the last wood cuckoo's boy. 
 Periyar storm-struck capt, NOT self-conscious His Spread
