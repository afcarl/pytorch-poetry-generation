Of My Body 

 following either season, making truth to arrive. 
 No one deep-scarr'd on our tongues. 
 Who was all of my understanding; 
 
 No action with blame old house 
 
 to go in his, here on this eternal page, 
 died: she will follow a Eden--; 
 and from the throat of a door falling 
 outside the city, hollow vase some thin residue 
 in a August dance light in pebbles that now 
 
 is the same sign. 
 Here sun
