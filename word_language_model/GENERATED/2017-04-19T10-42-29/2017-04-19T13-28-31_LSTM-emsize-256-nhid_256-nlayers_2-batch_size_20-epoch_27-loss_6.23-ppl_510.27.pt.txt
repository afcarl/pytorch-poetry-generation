In Line Y, From The Came, 

 Yes that is upright, there is no place to, 
 Which is that which for all the spaces they do with their own wash 
 In the Isles of strangers, the death of me, and now, 
 To Act that I Eternity so am taken, unmasks; 
 Or, with you and not will have it wrought 
 In a voice With mock breath, I with a tired noise of Chokan: 
 But not? O benefits I die and tried to stay
