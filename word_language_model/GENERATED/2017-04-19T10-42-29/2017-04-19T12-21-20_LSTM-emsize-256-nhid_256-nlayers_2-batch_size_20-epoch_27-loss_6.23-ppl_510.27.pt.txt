Before 

 And on the open road the sea was all 
 Walk'd in the mind, plus the lost body. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Signs of Shoreham, Dreams 
 
 
 honey-head, Teaches the friend 
 As you Chokecherries says I suppose 
 Mexico--bleak in the kitchen side. 
 Until you are as freedom's as atom die, 
 Throb full, so soon at hourly 
 Whilome you were trout-filled 
 wrote it in itself for the patterns of the leaf-shapes 
 of cruelty and all Jupiter!
