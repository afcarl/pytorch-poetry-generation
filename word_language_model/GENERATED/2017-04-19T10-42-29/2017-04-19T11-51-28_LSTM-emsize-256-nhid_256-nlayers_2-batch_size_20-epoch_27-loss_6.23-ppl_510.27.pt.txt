Again The Death, 

 My neck like a Lab-mix 
 "Don't have been born. 
 
 
 
 I saw the bright Countess, say snide wear. 
 Not its great one-- the gold still curved from my grave. 
 He cuts against his dresser and all the gay, 
 Slips me back for me. 
 
 As I slept, I feel the first, 
 Iâ€™m idea. He has a bee on the neck with its heavy sticks 
 comes. The worn piano. 
 Steps are blackened in white
