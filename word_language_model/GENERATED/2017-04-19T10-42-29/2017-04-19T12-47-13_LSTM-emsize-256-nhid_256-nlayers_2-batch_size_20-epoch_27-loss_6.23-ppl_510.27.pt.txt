Speak Long, 

 Got back. The young man who knew the bass 
 
 of love. The Testament on glass 
 did really follow "as the killer was clean. 
 
 A cat's old prick heart upon black shoulders. 
 Above the small news I had not yours you knew but 
 truly again die: added what he wanted 
 to say. This evening I understood 
 the rest would be gone from here and still 
 in the morning before the friendliest mannikin 
 secret prayers sat
