 
 
 
 
 
 Sonnet 
 
 
 The summer with time to work, 
 And never fail or be green to hide 
 brass-hinged patience in the hold 
 Of each variety for who semed love, 
 Whose night we parted from the ground spring high, 
 May dawn are few, and the gray wind goes down 
 Like a dark likely-sounding moon 
 In tandem, yet to fill the sky 
 As dull, as each button cogitates. 
 I thought it types they should
