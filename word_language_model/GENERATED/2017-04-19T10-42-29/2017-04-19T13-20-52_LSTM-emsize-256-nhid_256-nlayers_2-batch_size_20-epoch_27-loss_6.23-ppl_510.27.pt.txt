And Quiet 

 More insect, nor under pride, 
 Nor can I go TWIST 
 
 There's a old man, sitting trimmed with rock, 
 vinca and streaming. 
 O light black wood; 
 I remember in sound of the thin 
 candle Saturday fan. 
 All night, eternal noise of the slave. 
 from this dark dark ledge I cower 
 and scraping red incisions from the densest whirlpool 
 eternity 
 for kids for the tusk of Wall birds paint water, eyes 
 drawn day as
