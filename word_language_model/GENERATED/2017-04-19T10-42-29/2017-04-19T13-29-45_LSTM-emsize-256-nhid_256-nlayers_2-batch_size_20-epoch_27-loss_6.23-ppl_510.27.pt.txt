Moaping Mordent Shent, 

 Sad unreadable furred. 
 Without Satin—and el shore, or wares that oxygen filling. 
 
 
 
 Today the lilacs sinks at the edge 
 into the night of the pasture and loosed finally 
 into the garden of the Spanish States. With the room 
 although welkin, binoculars in language 
 were too great and often sometimes muttered or subtle 
 
 distinction. We were a world of chimes and powder 
 
 as the world d’estate, so that we began.
