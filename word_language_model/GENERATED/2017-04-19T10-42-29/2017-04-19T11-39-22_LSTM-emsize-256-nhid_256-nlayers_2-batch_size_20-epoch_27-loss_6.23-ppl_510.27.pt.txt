Hold 

 all our anguish when a world in wine 
 from the full planet continuously like orchard 
 middle from our eyes, 
 its stiff rebellions in that perfect flame on 
 our peak and our bliss and our eyes 
 touching at our lives to spray 
 over Fowles through bathhouse hours; 
 for whites and occidit 
 and also other year. 
 
 inur'd way color 
 
 The memorial in our tether: 
 
 the windowful of some 
 dome of solitary plane.
