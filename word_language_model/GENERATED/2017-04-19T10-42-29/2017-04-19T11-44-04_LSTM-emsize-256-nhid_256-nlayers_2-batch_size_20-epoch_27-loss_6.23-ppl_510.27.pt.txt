 The rain leaves like a wreath; 
 I cannot tarry any more. 
 
 I take the hand of my dry silk bell 
 And my heart will be my moment and yet 
 a few will look 
 only this morning. 
 
 Far from the night is the dream 
 Like a torn tongue. 
 I am not going to wash 
 With us that will be turned 
 From one step, you and I understand 
 We are our skeleton, they are prancing;
