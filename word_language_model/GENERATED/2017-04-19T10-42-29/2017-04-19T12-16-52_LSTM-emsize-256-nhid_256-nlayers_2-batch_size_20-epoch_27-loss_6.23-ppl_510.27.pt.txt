Grass 

 And bright was another weather 
 In the volcanoes there, 
 Of a lake not even once beginning 
 And on Massachusetts 
 On the boardwalk centers 
 Of an alley flat? Flapping 
 Girdle the body. 
 Remain not the place to forget 
 The fruit of foolish thought 
 The juicy horses, 
 drippy, And the 07/03/99 
 
 She remembered honey and one...and 
 And baskets. . . . I have been 
 (Says her and she never 
 When all else is
