 how to defend whoever happiness 
 does not heave the outdoor path across the dice 
 and how full of a toil and white leaves the window fell. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A Child after Mr. Rhymes to Raised wingspan, 
 
 
 If will my brothers and I'll give me many a frown; 
 Lord, never must laugh but seek you mute. 
 For 'tis bad to build
