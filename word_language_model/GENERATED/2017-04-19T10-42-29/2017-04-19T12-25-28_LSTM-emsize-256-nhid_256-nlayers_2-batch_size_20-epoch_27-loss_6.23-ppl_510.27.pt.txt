Then Would Be A Small Girl 

 The Zenith, a ten-day-old chicken givn 
 Found and fifteen feet forests you 
 
 don't thought the coat 
 
 Who had set like stone. 
 My knees since you see the best. Their wedding 
 inspections. At the top, at the cross the street 
 looms the young girl fast in the blue crust, 
 grim-souled after your love, with her mermaid looks, 
 and all old faces take their corpse 
 in a test you 
 in digital.
