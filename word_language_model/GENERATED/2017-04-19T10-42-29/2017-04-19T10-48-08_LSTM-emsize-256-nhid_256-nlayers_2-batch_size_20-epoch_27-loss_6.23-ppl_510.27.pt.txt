Would Be Run, 

 We called, and by understand the bond 
 Of Living, it seems that it owned, 
 Each of the cries itself, and a rose in eye, 
 Is built by soul from the Enniskerry 
 
 It is not the lonely known grace of it all. 
 But what belongs to others in real solitude, 
 Not through the sight of an living, it is that impossible 
 Art and power, which day more angels turned 
 To the wind forever outside.
