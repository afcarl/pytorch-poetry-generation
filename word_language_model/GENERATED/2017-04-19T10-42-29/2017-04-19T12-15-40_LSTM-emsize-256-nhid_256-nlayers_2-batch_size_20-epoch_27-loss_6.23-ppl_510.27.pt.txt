And Turf--Roses Fruit-Sort 

 Shall you not turning of your soul with men you have, 
 Not as dry as they head to find; 
 
 
 
 
 They've got some queer lady, someone 
 in this book cut singing in the house 
 not the blue but ashes 
 of thought is not all heard of space 
 unless the sun does this, 
 the white scar from the water 
 the lamplight act flowers wherein 
 we have forgotten them or alone,
