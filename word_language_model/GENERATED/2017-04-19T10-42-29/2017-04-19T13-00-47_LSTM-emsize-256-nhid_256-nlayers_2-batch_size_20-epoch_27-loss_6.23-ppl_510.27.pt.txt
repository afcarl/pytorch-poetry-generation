Wear Its Own 

 love or the wind is composing victory 
 
 An insulted Vagabond this often has, 
 All day in an endless --Once 
 exempt? Froide 
 A miniature and ancient bone. 
 
 Standing so long day went indeed 
 Beneath the cherry I come 
 And evening seems to bring 
 New stone of itself, I come between every day's 
 twist and smaller. So strange 
 I think I could Be- never 
 Though it is tempted where of our lost things
