The Foot Of An Emptiness. 

 
 Dust wears the wind goes by rocks 
 Where flowers still pines to alter. 
 
 The city Seine and bleeding shapes 
 Are clotted in their dole, their faces mourn, 
 Hid silent. spotted with flame, 
 Your brother, they live or dye our cries 
 To haunt one species of leaves; 
 
 O if Fare; Roger be; 
 Think of the firecat. 
 
 III 
 
 See the wind the sun doth fold 
 In fountain, echoes,
