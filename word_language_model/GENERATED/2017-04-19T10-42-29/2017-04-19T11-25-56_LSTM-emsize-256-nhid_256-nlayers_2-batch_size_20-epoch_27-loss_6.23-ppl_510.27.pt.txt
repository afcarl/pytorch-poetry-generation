Looked For: 

 executioner; disturb'd in humble years, 
 
 The hull of the firelight, I saw him the stately North, 
 The image of young pelted pines 
 Wrapping me and I became my face 
 As of a gentle harmony 
 It is my dread 
 That it would be true as my own dream, "Y'all 
 Through all ages of bells, 
 I far-off and closed my soul. 
 
 From a eighth learnt I greet 
 A lamentation, then there all the thoughts
