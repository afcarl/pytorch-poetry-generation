Frame-Full Of Doors 

 And the MOB apples 
 bang on a droning unit 
 And from out dream 
 To the flawless end 
 A cow's veiled of the bird's heart. 
 there stands slow, spire, Undimmed 
 In cool-enfolding minds. 
 In no wind turning 
 under. That Ellen burn 
 Brings to its grace a musical 
 Light is, yet not for a house? 
 The morning-glories trifle, the welcome 
 high fires of canoe 
 And the fleece 
 Of Napoleon floating down
