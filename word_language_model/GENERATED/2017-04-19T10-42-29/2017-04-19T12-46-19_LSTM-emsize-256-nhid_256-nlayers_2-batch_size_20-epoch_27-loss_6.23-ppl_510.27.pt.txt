Meet, 

 marmoset, skittish stress and sheer 
 Where there are buried everywhere, Shall mar her 
 A master of New Gaunt. keeping right 
 within that lifting of sun and railway wind 
 Singing her song gone to disguise 
 Her ankles come out of stone. 
 For as a brain-locked artist sees 
 From one bone from the dappling forehead, 
 Poignant and Angel, should 
 As he bounds through wet leaves in the sea 
 Of the swaddled grass, the sounds 
 Of bedded fires
