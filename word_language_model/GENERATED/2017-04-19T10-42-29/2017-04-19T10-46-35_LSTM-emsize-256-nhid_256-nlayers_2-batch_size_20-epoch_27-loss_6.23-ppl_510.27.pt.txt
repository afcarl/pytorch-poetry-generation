The Buskin'D As It Was 

 in the window on the river. 
 
 Down from the icy dresser 
 I sat on a red sapling, 
 a russet radio, a 
 withstood moon 
 negro flung around 
 leading odds 
 and walked on, 
 circled me, 
 
 as I watch the bud balanced 
 into a refrigerator 
 crater beating quiet 
 and spins 
 
 like a kind fall of skin 
 works deep in the garden 
 I fell soft or wee
