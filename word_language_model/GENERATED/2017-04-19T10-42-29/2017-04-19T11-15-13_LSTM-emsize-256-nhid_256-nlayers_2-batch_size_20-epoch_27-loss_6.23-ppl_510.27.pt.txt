Bodies. 

 Called out, little words. 
 He writes out of a tomb, well, 
 and again what other flowers fall, 
 
 or the poem is already gowanus 
 He withdrew out with his own bay-leaves 
 
 They knew both women, 
 and every day the more majestic 
 cubicles held apart and takes 
 their steps as the uncertain crimes 
 dispersed rider to the bony marital 
 Rio fidelity 
 the evening would heave up the untouchable 
 hidden corner falling at a fourth
