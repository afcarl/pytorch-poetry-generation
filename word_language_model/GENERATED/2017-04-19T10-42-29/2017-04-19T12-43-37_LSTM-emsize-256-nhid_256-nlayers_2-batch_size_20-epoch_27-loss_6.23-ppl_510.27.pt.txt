 In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 78 
 
 
 In his soft rest the spaniel, The Day was dreary, 
 On the back porch, the hill is strewn 
 Across the long chaff, which are the swift 
 Last party of the highest youâ€™ll resist 
 A burnt-out daughter crouched in a door, 
 That's him next to the blackboard, 
 The steady level of his calling. 
 
 The ash is similarly still.
