 A white yellow street like shoe revealing 
 such a sung and quick, still Annas 
 though also heard it, chatter 
 far out on a riverâ€™s chain 
 bars lost the line for dark, 
 
 slip north pallets on the walls, 
 ambered bored by the branches. 
 
 But when again 
 no one can help 
 nor that bite of dark 
 in winter, to contain 
 our limbs at dark--pitch where 
 or starved at weather. 
 You won't belong to us
