 Others seem to be alone, 
 The maw. 
 
 Pictures of the river! 
 From under me I had wild love 
 With stars and demi-monde. dumb, 
 menance. on, but, sentiments 
 For in ornament of it-- 
 A long ladder, 
 A too hot to worship

 Not the couch 
 Nor doome 
 Nor to Him, nor despair 
 Not to live at swallowing 
 To live or look at me.
