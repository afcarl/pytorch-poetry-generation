From Their Situations 

 While all God checked, 
 Leaving a book which He 
 Sent by what horrible debt 
 mother's.... -- my friend unravel 
 
 Past everything in their tone, 
 
 e, in Adieu and light 
 For them, considering what he taste 
 He denies upon my breath? 
 That is with Man upon her brain, 
 Each nightly thing shoes along, 
 Feathered and fifty empty towers, 
 Lit ever her own home behind, 
 Till she changes not, love death, no
