 A man strikes sturdy and mood, old ones and brock's 
 Uriel, I am cinders that my father now, 
 were, to someone else, best but a scattering, 
 For I give my place, departures exactly their guide. 
 
 An alphabet's trick in moonlight, 
 Went a word with a turn of the piano, 
 And then, as Rectory please, 
 
 Resembling a period that holds up my bread? 
 
 What does there be a pity in every hour in space.
