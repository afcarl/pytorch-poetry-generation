To Say 

 "The law on my journey be beating 
 Beyond me. In the world it's glazed with wine, 
 Dancing and sway at the windows, and 
 I grant me and to evening hold my waking attention 
 To the black repose;

 I ain't got it long enough to tire light, I know the world 
 I have faltered and snatched it within the Devil I'm disassociation 
 For Kabul 
 And a family of her
