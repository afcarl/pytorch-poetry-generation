 Those terrours, that are men. 
 
 People who saw sibbe. flowers, 
 regaine no thinning tracks. 
 In somewhere square the sky, 
 Guides by all the sharp assay, 
 They bleeds out the high: 
 And the word hacked by their feet 
 Our pieties are the cons right on. 
 
 They stood through their tents, and night 
 To the jaws of December, in the moonlight; 
 Sprinklers softly, oh breast-lights wide,
