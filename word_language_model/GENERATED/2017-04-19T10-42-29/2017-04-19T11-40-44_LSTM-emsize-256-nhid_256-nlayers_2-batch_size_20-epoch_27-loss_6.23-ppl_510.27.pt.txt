The Ottoman: 

 Blushes with another county 
 
 This one stays wrestling and cut above 
 sadness and tail dried down to survival, 
 A page that held not sundown gritty. 
 
 At this despair. Where did I hear? 
 
 A couple Gide, I thought i painted me 
 Seam. from the beginning, so I was caught 
 And walked back and torn who had already bit it, 
 I told her after they couldn't have gone 
 They allow me when they beat tables
