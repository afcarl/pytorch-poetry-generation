 A sense of eating, and one of them as dinner 
 As the grass burns as snow. He laughs when he wants to stick 
 His strange coat in the hollow bud 
 Or watch the feet of a fly of midnight sun 
 splendorous by then snug in the afternoon. 
 
 
 
 
 
 My Father Muse 
 
 
 After His window they will climb feed 
 tiller through all the search of asking returning 
 to putting so many ways to live.
