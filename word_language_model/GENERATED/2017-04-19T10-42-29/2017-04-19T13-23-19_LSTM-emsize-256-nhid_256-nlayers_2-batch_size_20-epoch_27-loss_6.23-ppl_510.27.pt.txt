Camp-- 

 Or that one fallen scene I say life. 
 And I said, Challenger, owlet's scent, 
 With bamboo torches Turner shining eyes. 
 
 
 
 Her name is not his theme, 
 My lyric soaks a tear, 
 Born for to-day. Lord, nor how much time 
 Does he rush like a crooked dell 
 To look down to the hilt and things might be 
 That we again would bring forth the throne: 
 
 For, after Heaven's hour is near, 
 Still smiling
