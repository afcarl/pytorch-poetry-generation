Open And Speechless, By Each Dream 

 can be noted in every sunny tree, 
 sneak into greasy moonshine, trunks 
 fruitfulness. avocados, Waters 
 has crept from one rafter 
 under the window or goes blue, 
 
 buoys. Pel'po'nesia-- 
 enters against memory ocean; 
 you remember me now, 
 a wave in new trumpets 
 PIERCE and broiling a while to trim 
 you reclining on 
 my entry to the church to meet the academy 
 of divided distant domes
