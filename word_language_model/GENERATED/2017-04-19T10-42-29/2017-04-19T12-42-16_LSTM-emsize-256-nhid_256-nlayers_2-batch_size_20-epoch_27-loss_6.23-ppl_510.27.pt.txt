 
 XLV 
 
 From the grey, black upland, 
 I shaved my feet 
 from the clouds-- 
 I flew to the feather I kept 
 imagine? Music said 
 their public poet is smiling 
 with a few minutes, 
 who loosens my head, 
 to hunger, as for the soul 
 of a serial woman. 
 I have lived as the best 
 plant, and the mother, 
 the lean and shoe the snow. 
 All these things, erst 
 with all the things
