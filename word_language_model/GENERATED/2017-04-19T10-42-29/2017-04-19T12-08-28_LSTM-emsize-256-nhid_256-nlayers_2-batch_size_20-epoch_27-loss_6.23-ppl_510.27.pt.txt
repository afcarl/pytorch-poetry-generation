 
 pleated winds have meaning. 
 The unconscious of the day, 
 The three-times-three, 
 
 peepe, at moans as we come 
 When our Nightingale bounces 
 Over the soiled bough 
 To towered Camelot; 
 streambed in accents and trouble; 
 But still there is no cares to leap 
 Into this windless era of the land. 
 
 In the stone of your beauty and splendor 
 clingburrs and I must meet 
 Till a man torturers' 
 The first X, he rode home
