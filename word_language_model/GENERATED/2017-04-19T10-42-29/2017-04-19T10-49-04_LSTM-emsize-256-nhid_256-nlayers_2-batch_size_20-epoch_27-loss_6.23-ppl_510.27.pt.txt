The Future, 

 The man is won in solitude, 
 Because he sees the subject is to art, 
 stuffed. and low they pay in service 
 In lonely orreries, 
 They have just forgotten a-kill 
 They once see digression but all is Georgia 
 
 Burning too bath down over the church 
 the possibilities of the world loses 
 where like friends, first or Recall 
 a period of sun. Meanwhile we 
 in sick hallucinatory squares light Doves 
 under the wavering human thumbs
