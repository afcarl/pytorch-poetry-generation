Swayes 

 sable-stol√®d pore, 
 One grans in jail, 
 Nose and no shout 
 
 intentionally unseduc'd 
 rising to Dick face to sing 
 Oklahoma 
 "shhh" sang; 
 angels in black dusk 
 women in laughter. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Song of Night Down from the faces of Solitude 
 
 
 relent. calf; one hundred herd, whose tusks 
 began the little beautiful fields for hours 
 when, as reveal still heart and stone without grouse, 
 or more great instrument
