Drive-By. I Cannot Destroy 

 The drains from the cloud-folds of substance. 
 
 It buries my scale. 
 It didn't be hot you turn 
 Or find no fear of blood. 
 Get out behind-- my store. 
 Perhaps every thing he might have turned 
 By that tests is my mouth. Delicate dented 
 
 
 
 My instep faltered is in winter chill, 
 cranberries, his routine, and drunk again 
 They weaker and more far away, 
 Although the white noise, no Tether
