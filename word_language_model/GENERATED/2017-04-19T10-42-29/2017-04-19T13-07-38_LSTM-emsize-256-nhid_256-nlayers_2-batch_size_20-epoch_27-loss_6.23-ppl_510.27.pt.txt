 All I have and too much one worth. 
 I [too first things, rather freight--oh 
 I stand and fled the moon, 
 And, face--and like a star 
 Among the trees by autumn, flowers. 
 
 A second time I found was not 
 In your dagger, Built done 
 In my journey and lay my tongue 
 Like a spiderweb under the window unbroken 
 cavity, and semi and the other 
 While the wind is softly hidden, 
 Or, underneath the gloomy floor
