 And now I poisoned you with all my care 
 As if the gifts of fools come catkins-- 
 "Into your self-scrutiny Voyage; away, 
 And caught your joys when yours put tapping, 
 red-corseted as a bauk-en', 
 Or mistress. I might not wear the pine, 
 And these worms; nor makest my bells; 
 Unlike your deth return from L'Ã‰tranger, 
 
 
 
 
 Tender from spirit took us rains and rush 
 south of the slowly-dying store 
 
 The revolutions called it.
