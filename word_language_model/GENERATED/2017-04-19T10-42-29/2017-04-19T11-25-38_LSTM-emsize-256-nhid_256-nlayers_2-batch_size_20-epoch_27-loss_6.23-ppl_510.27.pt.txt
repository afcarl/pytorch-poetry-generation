Wakes In Hours And Went 

 With many a man and a handy and sweet, 
 And beares them, and says, Faustine. 
 
 The mother said, finished? 
 
 Consider all beauty credit 
 No longer disdain. 
 
 The lonely isle hung in port on fire. 
 Co√≠mbre we found otherwise 
 Asleep in their antiquated phallus, faces, 
 the babe of light 
 
 fungus in the seaweed 
 eight, pencil at the still 
 edge 
 
 We're empty. 
 masques, 
 since:
