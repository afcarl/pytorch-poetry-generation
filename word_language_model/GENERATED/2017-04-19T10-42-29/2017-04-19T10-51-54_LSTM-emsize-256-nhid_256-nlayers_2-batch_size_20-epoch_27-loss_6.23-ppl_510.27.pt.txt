Now Floating Wings 

 Unto his him, the appointed ring, 
 The certain, lost in the dead book of nursery men. 
 
 XXXII 
 In this case, these mortality. 
 
 summary, fills on the fold! of Space, 
 Where sped the herds of trains to pain. 
 
 
 
 1 massing 
 
 
 cutting the moon, and red loam, 
 students of flowers, love, plan. 
 
 And high among the geology of liquid 
 I have never found a poem of heron-crested
