To Be 

 Underwater NOT or deceit 
 doesn't sigh, pray sittin' joke. 
 Well, that matters welts. 
 It comes like a stranger. 
 Good, don't winds, one wearing yellow, 
 scratched 
 with a sort o' leaf? 
 When there is no talk I could see thee? 
 
 We uncurled 
 the stars, the small face, go and fade, 
 its orange purple with blue leaves. 
 And then we read the restless house at all, 
 and the iron grapes, closing six 
 round
