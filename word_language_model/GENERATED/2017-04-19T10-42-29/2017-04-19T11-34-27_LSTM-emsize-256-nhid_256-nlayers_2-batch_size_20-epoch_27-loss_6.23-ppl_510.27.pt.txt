 slipper and connective mouth; yes but your name of dreams, I am 
 Multitudes, 
 By the fire of allotted: strawberries unstable as a mirror 
 One appears out to dance at last embroidering her shirt. 
 
 
 
 
 
 A Note in the Princess: 
 
 
 I used to sift governing, of water ... 
 A child makes standing in the pit 
 if I went on, we'd like 
 to be a patient perfume-- 
 a week in which it was
