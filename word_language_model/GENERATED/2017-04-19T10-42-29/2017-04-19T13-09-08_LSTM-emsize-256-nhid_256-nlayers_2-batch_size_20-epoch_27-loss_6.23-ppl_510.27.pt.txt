 As though you had lost a wolf's fist 
 Before it is too vast to be quick, 
 You ain't nothing to eat. 
 
 
 
 Give me a few more force when you will have, 
 And preserve meaningâ€”little tearful English, 
 Far in my gifts; but while ye take your fruit. 
 I see her in my verse of music 
 With never thinking, in this mean light. 
 
 
 
 
 As We born ourselves with breath, 
 Children with women governs,
