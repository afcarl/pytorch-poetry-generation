Lilac-Scent Surfaces, 

 A timeless bird. 
 Dead in the International pool, 
 Had a man gone around, 
 In my mother's mouth 
 I the sweating disgrace. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Song at Summer 
 
 
 sing hardly xl 
 From on the meadows, 
 circuit over face 
 from any slouched 
 
 fired and tail at 
 different winter up 
 edges to bad windows 
 
 shaped in the book." 
 
 It is gone after once 
 a poem
