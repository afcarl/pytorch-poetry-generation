To Perish? 

 sweartum from the loose Syrian round; 
 I hear the swords of Morning moon, and gasp'd 
 the fickle tree that gather will as little song: 
 I vowing, across the rising bard, 
 a pale cot in trigger. velvet, 
 past the loose of each as a boy with his suffering 
 Sentinel in oblivion â€” 
 intrude, Remembre a long time. 
 
 How will I begin 
 who needs fondler my heart with my make, 
 my mind answers, tight, he murmured
