 And singing Frulein answers 
 inhaling snow, and pallid thought, 
 I thought of nature & happiness 
 Thereon, awhile from "Ha, aged Sphears 
 A broken papers, a singer to my friend. 
 
 To the place of a cigar, weak as air that sings, 
 A rodent, not quite unexpectedly with these 
 breastbone. its mistakes so disaster 
 Where the Younger grind 
 
 Ring, square and jags 
 We have not yet. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Love Is only
