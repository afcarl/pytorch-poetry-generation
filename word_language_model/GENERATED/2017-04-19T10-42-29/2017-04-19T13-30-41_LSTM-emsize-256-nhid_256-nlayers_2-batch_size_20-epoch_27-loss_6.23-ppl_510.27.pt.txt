Cabbageheads, 

 
 For the first sin of pastoral desire-- 
 Draws its own breath, and pupils--of 
 may hold for him-- their aukward tears 
 Merely, with sympathies in agreement)-- 
 But a' our compound widow 
 In experience. 
 Must I, my friends, to know, to God, 
 
 Whose writing dead souls run to expand 
 Dreams of Lethe with paintings: Loveâ€™s grace 
 Can be the keys of mercy stony Robbia 
 If I should punish things, write it by note, 
 Do that
