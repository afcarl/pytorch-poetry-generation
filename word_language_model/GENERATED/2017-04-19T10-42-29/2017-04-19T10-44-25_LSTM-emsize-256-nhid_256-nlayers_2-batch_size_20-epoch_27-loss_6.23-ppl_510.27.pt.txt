Never Was. 

 
 I left the human, and the fret 
 my face lay from! across the hills, 
 my knees against me were staggering above me. 
 
 
 
 I came to work with fireball's I said, 
 Since five lyfe fatherâ€™s 
 I look upon it as can one day seedtime's 
 I gave them sixteen years to come. 
 I walked floating back at the interstate 
 With a bunch of cotton powder for a cane, 
 This they say, I tore it
