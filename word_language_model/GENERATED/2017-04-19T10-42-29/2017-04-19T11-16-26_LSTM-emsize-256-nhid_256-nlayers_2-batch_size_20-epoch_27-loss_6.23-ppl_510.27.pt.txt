Constrict Plummet, With Confidence, 

 Never seen on side the forest oft 
 To do like on: the heaven was lost? 
 
 No love it hopes could find too broad or new, 
 How easy a tender cry did inconspicuously 
 Away with the rude nocturnal light 
 Arose at dusk, and light under the town. 
 
 VIII. 
 thieve; Alas! stings the stress 
 unions upon Wayfaring in in hush are 
 Shrouded heavens to maintain his own 
 When the land stands beaten in
