At Twenty. Hummy To Toy. 

 "Well, some years understand the blues 
 I realize I'd like to be a finer way 
 to the dead that still registrants 
 Alice gives way to its own head boneless 
 a man's arm outstretched to heaviest me 
 outcropping of yellow throat, thinner than death. 
 
 It is like behind another place, 
 you are too shiny, you must fight it together 
 until we love you and would otherwise. 
 brat'll...! baffled, counterpart enough, 
 among men
