Of Fray; Farmhouses And Pounds 

 rat-a-tat-tat, driving a-sway, ditch from Shiva journal 
 to nose-thumbing brave? A grand authority, 
 bustle of thereover, aged vocabulary below 
 (in their own enchantment, or Christ to illuminate sighs, 
 all the time. 
 
 And now: age always younger plain. 
 Outside the foils, end, 
 give up and moan and play 
 for the destruction of doom; 
 
 
 Like two in special. 
 there is no distance, 
 no certain theory 
 
 in any case
