 And you become I, that whole flower creepeth 
 In the kitchen, when I breathe 
 Your eyes in each eye, and carry rich, 
 
 Will I teach you how fast the deepest flower 
 spots my cheeks in the thought of praise. 
 My days are in the glimmering air, 
 Where the new grasses swung, 
 With every pleasant look, 
 And straight will to my thoughts resume 
 Some sweet and curious stage; 
 And the grave of the days hast fed
