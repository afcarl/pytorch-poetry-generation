All The World 

 The whole world and this 
 Is the shape of things in the language of benefit 
 I saw it must sigh at last opening in the air 
 Once in a wide field 
 Where my work is Heartfelt 
 
 Boil you see it from me, 
 And see if your heat at midnight table replied, 
 
 Though still I find 
 In rain I do not know what I love is what we love? 
 
 Now the gods is
