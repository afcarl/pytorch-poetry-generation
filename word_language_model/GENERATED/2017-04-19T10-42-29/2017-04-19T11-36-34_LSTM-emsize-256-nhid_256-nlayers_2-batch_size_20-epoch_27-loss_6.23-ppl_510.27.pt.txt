To Negate 

 That the house chewing 
 And we were there. 
 
 ~ 
 Once the depleted life fixed out the shifted 
 And a simple flower in the evening bars 
 YAHWEH utter all Herschel, grown, or more. 
 
 But as a night from Brooklyn slipped Selo, 
 And would not breathe forth as if she were flat. 
 And her uncle could have even follow 
 Her captors who watched her unbruised race. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Low Blues
