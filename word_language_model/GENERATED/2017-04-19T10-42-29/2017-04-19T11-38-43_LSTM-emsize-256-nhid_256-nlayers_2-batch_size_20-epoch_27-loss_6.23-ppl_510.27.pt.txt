Case, 

 of mine and subtle tone the dying 
 story. strath fungi, the double 
 ruin of age, the other fails. 
 
 Dancing of flood, Hart's like a virgin wind 
 wending, like a cock, tossed a desire.' 
 Deep dark and recluse-dark chill in summer, 
 on its other side trying to call your music 
 to you. You have again so long to deliver 
 into you two months from the wound . . . to get octagonal 
 Love carries its loose hand.
