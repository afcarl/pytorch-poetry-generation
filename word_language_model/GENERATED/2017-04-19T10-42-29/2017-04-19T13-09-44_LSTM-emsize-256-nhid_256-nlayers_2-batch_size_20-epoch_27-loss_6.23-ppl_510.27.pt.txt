Humans, Him, 

 My two days ago, I walk through the ice-- 
 Afar beneath my thighs, 
 When snow and rain sink down, 
 Puts us round and round the shell and loth, 
 Such mirth is dead. when the long blue sun 
 When going tender birds mixed me, 
 Kindling again the devil's stream; 
 Yet would my joy be remembered by their cost. 
 The sharp eye leaps fans and set its cheek 
 Like leaves across my little lover, 
 
 I languish
