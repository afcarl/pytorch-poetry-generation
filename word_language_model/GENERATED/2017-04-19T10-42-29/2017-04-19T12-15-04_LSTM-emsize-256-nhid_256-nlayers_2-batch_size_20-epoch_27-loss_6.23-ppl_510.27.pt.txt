Whiff, 

 not with his overthrow, 
 And the loves, as the few of his chant, 
 It's pneumatic real girdle, along or his table 
 
 On a little galaxy suit of wood blur 
 Marble. xerox. 
 Delight and flounces in the pit and to Death, 
 With flavor on the disaster that love itself 
 disintegration. pounding moon and film has bought 
 They survive the people and the stuffed altars 
 To the aged hemisphere Auden is over himself.
