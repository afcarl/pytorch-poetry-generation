 And the monsters that neither Christian 
 Are useless, nor the absolute culture 
 Of these others, which shall be sisters' 
 Be Christ has corr'd our poor ignorant nest 
 And did not die and we shall quake 
 A matter for their loss, 
 And certainly root to sight that we may find. 
 
 What if this is our time hides destined for scene! 
 
 
 
 Against the mirror, black and yellow and Salem cricket 
 Full of peaches beside the mail-boat
