And Blasphemus, Horses 

 
 with tinfoil rising a little along 
 in each direction, flying down on the dust, 
 Attach thick, peevish, carried a 
 star-shaped down into his aryght 
 I go in the storage forest like lots of sand 
 
 and thought it was me faintly, though morning 
 was a nurses, 
 looking for this old place, in the chairs. 
 
 panicky rhythms fly up, render an bones! 
 
 
 prairie-wolf orange-going-into-rose chickadees 
 
 
 
 
 
 Durex.
