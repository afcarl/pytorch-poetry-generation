In The Soul. 

 feeler fingers on the new 
 In the parking lot bar, the sun seems right 
 Down slowly under the humid path, 
 Moving like light or moon, from water, the vines 
 Of rain; the spectator whose absence 
 familyâ€”and tasting and debris 
 And not behind her, down a narrow concert 
 Take out my trunk against this well. 
 
 From my marrow I see the fruited boom 
 From that whispering. Whoever is prepared to recall; 
 The grand results
