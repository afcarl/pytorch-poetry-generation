The Bee Was Through? The Brightest 

 brightest gates are conquered with the blood. 
 We have given this time or brief hunger, 
 Why death deals not with such envy to blest 
 
 The secret loss of all these, 
 But the black spirit that breathes in the soul 
 To matter upside down until there were no flowers, 
 Not 
 so little or too to fear. 
 [has sun (like damp ice, wrist 
 rustles in a cloud of nerves 
 blazes over pieces
