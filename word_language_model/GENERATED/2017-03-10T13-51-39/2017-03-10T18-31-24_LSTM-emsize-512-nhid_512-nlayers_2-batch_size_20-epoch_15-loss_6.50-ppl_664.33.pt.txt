 
 The Father and the Nordic-eyes Hours 
 began to buy. 
 
 The vision of the party's visits 
 
 When the yeer falls from a bowl, 
 
 The passion hyacinths 
 
 But it's pretty in every window, 
 
 With a plausible motion in its own dark eye. 
 
 
 I have looked addressing a haunch of broad foam 
 
 And the snow sweeps through the smooth and high snow below and down, 
 
 Not carving itself till it changes
