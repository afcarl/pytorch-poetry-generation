With Ant And Hammerlock 

 With the leaves of my window of the sun. 
 
 I beg no questions but coffle, 
 For my opinion ... 
 "I will stare upon 
 My hands O joy, with my eyes 
 recoiled: smear of leg water. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Song of Woods 
 
 
 matchbox, the protecting wind, 
 8. Flight and Ma environ coats in 
 And early avenues 
 That flight on the sidewalks 
 And shake out their leaves and blackened
