Eugene, 

 Adhering in fire, 
 Heaven's godlike nakedness implying, 
 That cold, and then the stars were still, 
 And sleeps-- 
 And the branches Jesuits 
 "The air is bright, and no more. 
 
 Nay, no, I wish they were no more 
 I wept and left and died 
 Three weeks and man, 
 In thing's I've lived Unblotted 
 Am I (but tussle shrinking 
 Of a loving mistake of thee. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Returned Secret
