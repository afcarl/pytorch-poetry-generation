But The Lazy Body Gravely 

 Called in a boat, 
 try--know its burden of its skin, 
 The quiet consolation 
 of gigantic crinkled and machinery 
 like a whorehouse in a dark ...

 A girl pulls in the suits. A brow 
 comes and the john washing 
 to the wind, and the likes might be 
 her own, a mystery; 
 learning Rakestreet. 
 but O we are very nice, dreaming, 
 that nothing is possible.
