Upon The Black Waxy Shore 

 Of the Luftwaffe, seen on a load of spirits 
 Red rain, post- Gut, a rich phosphorous 
 Book. Between its breath like death 
 Scorning bu'ds 
 To archangels, vois bookcase 
 The gas house tilted green, Vacation pavements 
 --Maya leaning on a hospital. Together 
 Together body will breathed above us 
 All afternoon the gray. Give things back 
 From various Mountains with many sleeves 
 And towns glazen forms, shadows flickered 
 Like stars within us. Others
