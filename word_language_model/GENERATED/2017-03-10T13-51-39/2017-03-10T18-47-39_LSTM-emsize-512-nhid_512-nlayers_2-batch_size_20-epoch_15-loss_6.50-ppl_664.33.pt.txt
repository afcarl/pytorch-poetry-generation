 
 But now I wept, "What faith do I wind ... 
 My mind is this fair sin which is my days: 
 Thy song is free; no wind? no scope . . . 
 And these xxvi which fold me free. 
 The flowers palms' on their stems flown through. 
 There is no fret and ice but soon kindes 
 For the poor world everything.

 Like Europe leaves high slits the starred bones fling

 If any
