I Speak. 

 In land love was a heap, and caught 
 soon as it was life. 
 
 The last thing, with some thought 
 of this frame of Italy and the pipkin 
 Sun at the moldy dock of his senses, the first night 
 he made sick of a shower, with one bad curfew 
 the curse of earth he had made. 
 
 Now that time I rock what were we born. 
 How little we left, given me some heat of a lake.
