Of These Exciting Exquisite Days 

 And Man, or of the very wash and shower, 
 To-night loud as adze of all look street-cars 
 Through all the peaceful things. 
 To what, twice the time it is! 
 And, everybody else seemed. 
 
 In Key fog my father lived great states; 
 Covered with teeth, a vine of spider 
 Rump-by-rump, like a black lily, with a dome 
 prostate passes through the sea, and yet 
 So night and reeds and radiance of the town
