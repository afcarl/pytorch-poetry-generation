In The Pores Of Transmortification 

 
 spend. visaThen political wood-kerne 
 
 4 
 I mean at, death cannot be Skeleton, it is here: 
 Our frantic self, 
 jigs, broaching 
 keeps past world to beginnings. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 February Day 
 
 
 To close the fat 
 From the crest 
 Of graie, 
 Down and down the valleys walls 
 That go across the walls 
 And there the moon is never heard 
 For a barbarous day.
