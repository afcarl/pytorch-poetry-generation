Beyond The Road 

 Down the steep roar of Ocean which, 
 A few young boy with new Myths, 
 In his father's first life and his wife 
 Looking into her place where she lives, 
 My skin distracted--by face beside Milky earth. 
 She complains of that she doesn't know 
 No one ever else or is, 
 Would he have been loved. He is within 
 the eye he thinks it changes, chewing the parts. 
 Not only God's escape from pitchers 
 Of history
