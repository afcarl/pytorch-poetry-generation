 
 And though 
 
 Joy come high tepees, 
 
 Envy burning blossom corresponds, 
 
 Forgot thou shame with idle delight. 
 
 
 I, o'er and around in time to lie, 
 
 Like enormously rose from south to cleave, 
 
 Stern inhospitable Queen among the skies; 
 
 lament? 
 Who loves each other's veil and drowns 
 
 Is giv'n, tyrant mirth leaping away, 
 
 From rainbow desires; 
 
 I behold the hoary blood 
 
 That sails at
