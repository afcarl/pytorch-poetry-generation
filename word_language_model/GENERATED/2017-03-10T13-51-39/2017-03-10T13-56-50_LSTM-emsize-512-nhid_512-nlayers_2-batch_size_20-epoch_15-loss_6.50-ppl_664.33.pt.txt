 Ever like the shaman? 
 
 "What if the day is left Firs, 
 
 The golden members, 
 
 Were all ribs that wake, 
 
 And the passion of angels may be 
 
 Dark marks in their void, 
 
 All that framed day with pain, 
 
 rixode by unborn it were, -- 
 
 Our clothes one by one. 
 
 
 Anacrusis 
 #17 and beardless 
 battled and ground-ape, sweet, 
 morbeala earlike dews, 
 Round and over fright?
