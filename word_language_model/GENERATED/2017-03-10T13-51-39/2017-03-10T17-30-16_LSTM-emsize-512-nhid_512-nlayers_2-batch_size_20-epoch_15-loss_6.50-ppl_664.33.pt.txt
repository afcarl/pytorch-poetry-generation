Rang On The Draining Moon 

 topaz, like two deaths, washed of foam on the deeps of corn, 
 deep under humble snow, down among the soil, those 
 glaring pink with silver majority. 
 
 have you seen 'em trouble slowly, 
 a fine cold book in a grotto, she is afraid. 
 It is good to be cars, and when you try to be dead? 
 It isn't hard to get them away with her terrible mustache 
 you have anymore before, 
 who are more
