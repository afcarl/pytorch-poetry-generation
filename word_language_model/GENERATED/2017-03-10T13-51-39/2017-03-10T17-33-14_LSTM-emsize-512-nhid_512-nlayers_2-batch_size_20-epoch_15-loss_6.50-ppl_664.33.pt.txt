In Every River. 

 And let us hear on the roof, covers up our foreheads 
 on sensibility, 
 If we insist, there will be shining and buried. 
 
 viet sleep rock unexpected, gold corners 
 white reload you dry east from stone; 
 left of the pepper-and-salt; Kos 
 triangle of ictus. bees. 
 
 I cannot see then 
 consolation and speaking there, 
 that everything is there 
 in this moral America. 
 
 There are scraps and bones find something 
 of strength.
