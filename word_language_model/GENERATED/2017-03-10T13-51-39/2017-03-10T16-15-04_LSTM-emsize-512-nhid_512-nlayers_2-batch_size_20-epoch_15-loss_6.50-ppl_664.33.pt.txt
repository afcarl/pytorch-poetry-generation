Day A Topic, 

 to turn and eat. How we sometimes ate it 
 charge? Our breaths an parents, was very strange. 
 How could they blend, the wanting to say 
 a world of religious fiddling, 
 said how after that? A pulley called the pivot; 
 In the monk's First nation divested, Charlie 
 airplane nice old friend's ale. At the bait. 
 
 I'm sewn on you. 
 We didn't know how to the pained, 
 crouch 
 under the humbler surface of the woods.
