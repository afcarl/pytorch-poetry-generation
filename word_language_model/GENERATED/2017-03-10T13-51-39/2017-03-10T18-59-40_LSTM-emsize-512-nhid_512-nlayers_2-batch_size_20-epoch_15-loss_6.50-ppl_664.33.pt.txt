 
 And Yvorie, the seas and herds; 
 
 And light shadows on the steep walls descries 
 
 And the rain and their children's submission go 
 
 One by one, left love and the pride of life.

 I 
 
 Shall I but name that writing so. 
 Why so Cascadilla designe now have I, 
 The which in which in every town he resumes, 
 I signed without pity
