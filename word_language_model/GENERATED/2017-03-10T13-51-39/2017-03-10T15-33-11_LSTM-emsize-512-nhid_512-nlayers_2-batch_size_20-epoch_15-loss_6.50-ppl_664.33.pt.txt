Keyboard Of The Eye And The Top 

 Of the handle. Meanwhile you are responsible. 
 Will not a discretion be your sister, when you think 
 As they?... moon itself ready to imprison him.

 Cold poles are immense, poetry-- non burghers 
 Clear in pocket feet and along the lips of good-by! 
 Such human mothers' abundance 
 Pay in the plain with lines: 
 As can the city grow unequal 
 Thine eyes
