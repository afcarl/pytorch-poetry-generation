 It upright against us a mechanic 
 burning through rose flannels, a handful of ash. 
 Deep above the locks a arteries made 
 exploding from a mountain implications to bring 
 went.-- outward at the opera to death 
 
 while I eat my nakedness my definition 
 of death lost heard I'd still say, 
 be there if I went for once, one after one, a swimmer 
 at a ghetto gate seat, staring at a chin, 
 not so often dream of
