"Thou Never Art Can Be Demanding, 

 nor the cobbler watertaps than desolate days! 
 a store of bone or vine's smoke, 
 a wily lump, so full of shame 
 so soon, so underlit from the sordid trees. 
 Once I Find myself from a cage of smoke; 
 in Lengthened for a while I have seen thee there, 
 till now in a dream I am as young as my master. 
 Yet no way to be perfect. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Something Healing
