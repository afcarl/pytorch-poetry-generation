Brings And Aim, 

 factual me powerfullest to feed them clear 
 With asylum and deserts of a sword, mean cauldron, 
 a woman injure & no one's hand. 
 While the dulness, defined to learn, 
 where a goddamn life is Popes 
 Mee put it raw out of it down. 
 The sky begins to grow 
 Going to shape made of love 
 and It other comfort. 
 
 Wind blows Hideth 
 fall ribs walk through the trees 
 mad lovers roaming their walls.
