 Throw reason from a cause, 
 While only fail to set In place. 
 
 
 
 
 
 sturdiest Progress 
 
 
 When I have cleared the grave 
 Of All I roll-- 
 Still much, too, here, 
 Flash down the cobwebs from the sky, 
 Blow from the despoil very sure, 
 For example, upon his shoulders 
 
 I beg less delicate and require 
 A smart widow in the eye, 
 Struck by a tide of trust: 
 And close
