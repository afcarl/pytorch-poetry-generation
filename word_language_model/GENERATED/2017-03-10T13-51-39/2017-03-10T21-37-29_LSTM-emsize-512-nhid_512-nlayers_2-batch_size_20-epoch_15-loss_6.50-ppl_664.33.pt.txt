Do Shadows Wars, 

 And all dying. They know them perfect, 
 They err when God's mother stays at the soul's cat. 
 
 
 The drizzling loude breakers of the driver wallow, 
 And the lights of the braid that deepen 
 The Pearle above the walls; 
 It lingers in the cool 
 Over the ceiling of the sea wastes or stalks 
 Off circling himself in that distant night. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Working derailment 
 
 
 Yesterday and snapped at dawn
