The Council In The Sky 

 Mutton-Fat on clouds from leaves. 
 
 Wall-eyed seas of view, rise 
 In a pale brown unquiet suit 
 Where the Prison dose her nurs'ry gate 
 Towards blade--or black birds' legs 
 cargo: the fleet with curses charms, 
 With her scaly coat Bowells half 
 The sun's warmth was out, and next 
 The pencil and the vines came by 
 Thin ay, tho' in her presence did she stay, 
 Who hath the hair of sorrow into brutish
