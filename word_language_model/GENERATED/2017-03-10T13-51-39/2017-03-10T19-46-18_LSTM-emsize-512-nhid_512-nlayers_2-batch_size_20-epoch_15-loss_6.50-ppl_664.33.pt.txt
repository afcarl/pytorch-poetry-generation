Ondswarode, 

 adown, Worth, gehwam Dreams Armour 
 Fingers ... steel: THIS work-collar advocate. 
 
 I have not pity out for myself. I thought I was 
 Too older. This was the one who lives in the world 
 With storybook hands -- reading flashing black 
 
 10 mortared, circles like the summer sea 
 yet pure as the dusk I might have told them 
 Why, now I lived on the edge of my life 
 I saw the standing light I see nothing of
