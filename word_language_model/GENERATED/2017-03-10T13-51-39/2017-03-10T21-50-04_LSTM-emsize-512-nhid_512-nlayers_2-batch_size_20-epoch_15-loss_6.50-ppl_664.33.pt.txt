Tufts Into My Mirror 

 When we heard the minds of herons sing and leave. 
 Assist us these some kindness so that? 
 So ill should we not adore or please: 
 Our faces as the medals danced in the nightclub, 
 Yet the rest, which slew us, but what a Jury 
 Grew too far from the cold tenor of the night; 
 If we were seeking a strong line of a child 
 Is the truth, sodium with lines, 
 liturgy will see that, drink
