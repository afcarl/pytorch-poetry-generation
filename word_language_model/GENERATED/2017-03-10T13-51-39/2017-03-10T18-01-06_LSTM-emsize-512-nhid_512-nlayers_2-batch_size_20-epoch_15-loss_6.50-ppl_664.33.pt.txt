 I suspect it's certain 
 
 If you go. I don't think more than they're cu- 
 I pushed my eyes tarzan them now, 
 because they are all occurred? 
 You suspended from the moon, 
 Pressed your feet. 
 
 I stripped the boards with hot sweeping 
 fish and tightened to the market skin 
 The color itself leaf-trash 
 & strips into the storm. 
 The house 
 kept twenty but the baby. You pay 
 a hackled time's tooth
