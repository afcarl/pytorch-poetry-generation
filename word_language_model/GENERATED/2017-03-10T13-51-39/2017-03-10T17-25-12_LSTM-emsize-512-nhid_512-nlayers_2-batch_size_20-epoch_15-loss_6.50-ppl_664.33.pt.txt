 Should I too...? a Fly 
 Of the enormous, river 
 Of which I expected 
 The old edging bells together. 
 
 So through the darkness canopied and Bloodshed, 
 The same boy with ropes and flickering flowers 
 scatter their sandals behind me; 
 The water, and the stout-heart. 
 Are dead to proclaim the dimensions. 
 
 ocean-born might this be twinkles 
 --Called host at dog's gate 
 Float windows,
