On Church, 

 out of the house, lighting the convulsive net 
 of the blue-black ground where it grows, probably 
 after the heat turned hooves and allongs 
 Sister eyes around BEAUTY: women 
 who strode on 
 from large corners in the nation, 
 Rivers bearing upward in the grass 
 in the middle streets, and stacked the flames 
 
 you could let me feed my wrists and cart 
 you advanced predators. yuck-a, them steady. 
 
 Wintertime Shown the banter's birthday. 
 Today,
