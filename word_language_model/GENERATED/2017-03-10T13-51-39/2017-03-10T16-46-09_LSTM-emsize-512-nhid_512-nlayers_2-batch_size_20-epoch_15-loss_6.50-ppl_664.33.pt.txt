Of That Morning. 

 
 Neither the world will kneel for ever 
 Amid them; or fall. 
 I've heard a stain and danger scribbled naked 
 With the leaves that bends the water drunk with birds. 
 I am stark and sea and fluttering bells! 
 I creep along the current, and calls this year's 
 whitens, like a fan of Birmingham upon 
 All patterns of a hangover sexton 
 And my snub-nosed friend of Leslieville, 
 Am my daughter and I, 
 Time or cowardice,
