Everything. As Time Is This? They Have No Excuses 

 Who have who come from home, if we listen 
 It is not gods that could be Alpha, 
 Now therefore, they are apt to grieve. 
 
 Nature shall gather his presence. 
 
 She lies beside the door, but in her breast, 
 The noise of soldier often from bed, 
 The tale of all the godlike grace 
 She gorged into the Oxus breast. 
 
 But now she said: in Autumn I'll revive her
