 
 There was a weed in his lovely self; 
 The shadowless tree of a dead flower. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hindi 
 
 
 Little poise 
 Among my parents' bones, 
 With water burns, passing my chosen, 
 Going on, climbing to the wind, 
 Round your eyes 
 with bells 
 beside my no!" 
 I painted water 
 in my house, Don't press it 
 
 in a solitude of operation. 
 
 Now we might have been falling on
