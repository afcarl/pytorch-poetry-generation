 
 Through the brakes El, and still I walk 
 The cry of birth, and watch my love, 
 Sadie blow her over her garments like fire, 
 Let it go. She mandates graceful 
 Mother to cross her apron to my ears, 
 And there with gentle wing for guest's lands; 
 And majesty Mary pays crucified from high, 
 From morts fawning crew, 
 And laughing bombed by the mass, ... 
 The mounting of the plenty, the weevil 
 And cross on the scar
