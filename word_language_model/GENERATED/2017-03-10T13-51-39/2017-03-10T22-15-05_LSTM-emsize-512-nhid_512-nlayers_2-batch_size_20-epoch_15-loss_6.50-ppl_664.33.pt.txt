The Pepper Screen 

 Of sexual construction and molten wood, 
 III.3. . . Who lasts the hashish book 
 
 
 II 
 
 faun, he looks, and feeds their tears. 
 All things are pleased. They want to know 
 He cannot make a vengeance given; 
 The nightingale; they say, starred up in spray. 
 
 And through trees, I look for myself 
 Into a livid Thule. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Blind Woods 
 
 
 Inside your eyes green asleep
