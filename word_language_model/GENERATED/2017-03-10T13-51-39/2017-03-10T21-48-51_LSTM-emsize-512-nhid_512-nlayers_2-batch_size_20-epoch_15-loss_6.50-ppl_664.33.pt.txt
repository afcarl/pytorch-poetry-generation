Me Buried 

 In my varied chariot. 
 
 
 
 
 
 throat-cut 
 
 
 We borrowed with them all the kiss in that aisle 
 Present these loaves in every direction. 
 
 So we find this one, as we affright the girl 
 Man's one-eyed race. 
 The curse of her is in trust is the deer's end thing it is 
 For the blustered shrine with love, Imposes 
 Is the world to give us an inch. 
 The clear water is pretty
