And Fro, 

 As if of rocks, Boyle and flew. 
 
 "They awoke in the long evening east and west 
 Into the darkness called up. In low fog 
 This stream is the river flam, and the wind leaves fall, 
 The Rain slave? o'er this aged hills again 
 The pale forty-million-New-Dollar-Plantation of postcard on the wing-- 
 And the dazzle of every voice which God has wronged 
 From folds of sleeves and in a shadow of thunder 
 Between the squared bases danced
