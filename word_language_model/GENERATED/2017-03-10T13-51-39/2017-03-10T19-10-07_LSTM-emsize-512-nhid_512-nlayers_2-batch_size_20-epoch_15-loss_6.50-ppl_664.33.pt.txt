Rip 

 
 me tearing and sinks under the hills 
 through which windy air up there on wooden reefs 
 orange ophthalmology, & stubborn illiterate 
 crew -- a picture on the vapor a botched place 
 on which the fool carp with a small flourish 
 and water. A stone Lazarus I hope one thing. 
 A woman's foot is anywhere because seriously 
 the way to your vision is --in a woman 
 who would know me to heal the poet 
 Enjoyed of course,
