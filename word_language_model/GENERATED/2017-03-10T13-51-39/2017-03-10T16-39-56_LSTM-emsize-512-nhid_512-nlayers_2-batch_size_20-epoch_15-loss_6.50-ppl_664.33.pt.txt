Howled Her Way. 

 
 The government was assured by many of these poems, 
 Well, they might see the babies as they died. 
 
 His face and his dog saw in the heart of the grave, 
 It little becomes a match so sharp it went fainter there. 
 
 Strange garments, strange they were accepted to plead at home. 
 Hail of their astonished tenderer ringing faces of adolescent forms, 
 By the chime of all centuries is hail. What are they all real,
