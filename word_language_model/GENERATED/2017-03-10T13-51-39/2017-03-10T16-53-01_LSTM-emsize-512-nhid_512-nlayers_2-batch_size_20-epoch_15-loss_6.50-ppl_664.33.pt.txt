 punting, idiots breathing Foxes, 
 
 I gaze as I lay on his seat: maker; 
 Then my food--I swore to decision, i thought it was -- 
 The picket paint out sixth-grade before I realized 
 
 How I burn away from my hard feet and sticks in my lap. 
 
 My mother fell out the window, watching the steady merchant coming back to a goblet and made the hill: 
 
 The ants
