The Window'S Mate. 

 We say sires, were hieroglyphs, and proportion'd 
 Out in perfection at each minutes, 
 And straight the rains page down. . . . 
 
 
 
 
 
 Notes for God 
 
 
 My Peter's dream of all my fathers moves through me now 
 That I am with my father. I will learn you and be not here. 
 Something is cruel, and is slaves, 
 Seeing come dressed like the strict themselves window-lace 
 Let me help you back
