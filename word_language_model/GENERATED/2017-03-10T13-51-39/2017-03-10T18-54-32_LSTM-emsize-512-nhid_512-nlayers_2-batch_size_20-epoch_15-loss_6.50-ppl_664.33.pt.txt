 By the foul night at night, 
 I learned to settle the gold grow 
 Strife in the twilight. . . . 
 
 
 
 
 
 A Day in the Long Pacific 
 
 
 Behind the house by smaller time, 
 The line is in "Deathlessness chear'd the music, 
 verandah, heaodeorum, Warwickshiremen we come 
 From east to sauna, calling out 
 The Mexitli coming-of-age couch charlatans 
 A Christian drown: death touch'd the last 
 Golden east Clear, notes, the penitents curl'd,
