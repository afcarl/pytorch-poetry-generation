Boomlay, Matted Cake. When 

 I heard a voice and answered me at last 
 To turn her down until her hand 
 showed Wi' provisions to me 
 Down the door with a shattering bed. 
 Many such the three girls of change 
 Might not have torn up, upward by day, 
 Yet closed with him unlocked eloquence 
 Those streetlight. bare, 
 Themselves a solemn spot 
 Did set by eye the lank mothered 
 Who greeted all the weather: 
 A blond and farmer
