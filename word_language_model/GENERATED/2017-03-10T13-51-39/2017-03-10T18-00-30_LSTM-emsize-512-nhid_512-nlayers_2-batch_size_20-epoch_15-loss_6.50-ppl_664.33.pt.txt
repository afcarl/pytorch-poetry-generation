Useful; 

 Lifting the red moon, and the green banan--piano. 
 The smoothness of leaves, sea of the rushes pulse 
 Held up into the corner. The flames crack upon the bellies. 
 No sooner late or higher turn out dean apart, 
 The taste is briefly oranged under the banks, 
 Stretch'd into low light, on under the low yards of pearls, 
 bequeathed Stella, whatever hunger the talisman 
 
 Of the fleering White blind above. It isn't hard to know 
 How anything will come
