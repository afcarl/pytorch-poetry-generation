Immaculate. 

 
 Yet thy best work be left before, 
 But the hardest wind is sorry. 
 
 Dull without domestic times divine 
 Of crowds, by Lima pliant glee, 
 Flashing the cedar, says that gray 
 You made in my bounty all night 
 A naked knight. and little arms. 
 You put Grief out of dull black layoff 
 grange. wind-sleek stig fur 
 Rising to powder a' weight, 
 Rose-crowned, pitched thro' bees. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Song: Be I Fair
