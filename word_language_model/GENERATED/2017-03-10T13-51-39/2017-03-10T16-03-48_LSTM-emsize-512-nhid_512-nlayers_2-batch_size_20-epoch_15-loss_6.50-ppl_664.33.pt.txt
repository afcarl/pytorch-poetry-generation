 
 conditional bath with sleet and gin 
 The toothpaste Bays of Donne's pride, 
 
 These images thrown round 
 Out of the ditch with their liking of days 
 The same dark sink blunted with the sounds, 
 And grass comes out of the water again. 
 I don't know why. 
 We are the clouds of America 
 We have to sing the lives when we find 
 Found rain on the trees, and heap with flowers, 
 Melodious holes against the mountains
