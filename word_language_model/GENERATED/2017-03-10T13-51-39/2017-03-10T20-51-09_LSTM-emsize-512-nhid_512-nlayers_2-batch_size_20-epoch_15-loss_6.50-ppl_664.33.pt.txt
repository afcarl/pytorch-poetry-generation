 
 the forest air curled around 
 as I stole out fain, 
 
 there was nothing in nothing. 
 
 Everything late in me is a prayer 
 
 where grass itself bear itself 
 and the light it flings the steep poem 
 and I am old. 
 Suppose I can see one sick of me. 
 I'm trying to be happy 
 and tell you, I don't care it. 
 And even a woman who's learned 
 ale-cup, let it be for her
