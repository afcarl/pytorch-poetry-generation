 
 The North the morning spears, 
 Night grim. Oh prime star! 
 For company and yuck-a, Men 
 Pass from compute, and by slow spring 
 I knew no scanty way. 
 
 The rebirthing Mistress, Hesperus, 
 The Trust striving on his horse 
 To crowd you o'er the back corner 
 And boom of a flock wart, 
 And for the cabins and the Same-again. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Venetian Congo 
 
 
 Many an idle page, in rickety Roman
