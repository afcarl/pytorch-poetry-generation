 
 How huge an eightroomed written to consequence, 
 The slowing moon, 
 
 The night RFK, and slim, 
 
 Once myself near the scene 
 
 And the world on its tower, 
 
 Was it sought, there was more pretty lover. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Im astral. soundless in the Midwest 
 
 
 1 
 Days like knives that are black, ; 
 Outside yet the inward plot 
 of bees in a factory grove, 
 blood drifts under red,
