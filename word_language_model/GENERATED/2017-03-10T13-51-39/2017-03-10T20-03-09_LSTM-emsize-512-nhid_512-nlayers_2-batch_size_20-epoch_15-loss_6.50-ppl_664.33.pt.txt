His Body To Beare 

 
 boundlessness 
 gesturing into us who must parsons, 
 between the inventress and the faces start. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In the Singing 
 
 
 I jump box levelheaded water 
 I can wander at their store, 
 again, to find the needles and tangle the nostril, 
 and the braid on the warm--more & scare me, 
 I bind each by shelter alone with reckless joy. 
 
 I am the last gray flower of the day
