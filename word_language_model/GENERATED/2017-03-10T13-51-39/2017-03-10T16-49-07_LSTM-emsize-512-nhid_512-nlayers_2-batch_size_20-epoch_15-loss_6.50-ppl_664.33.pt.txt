From The Loins Of The Sea, 

 Remote upon what stars, and passionate tongues, 
 
 Over that river, a Lilies undo the heart. 
 Here the birds stand ripe on the sand, 
 dispositions judgment, like San Leoline. 
 
 On back into this landscape the cloth. A flower 
 From the gates of the world is telling 
 God dappled streams on the hills 
 Fed by a bright and mournful North 
 Among 
 rakish brooks cover the seas, Yankees sees 
 The Ceasing--one joins
