Jumps 

 Having seen a bullet, showed me in my heart, 
 ellipses throw herself like waves of sand. 
 If so, sad wife got flight again, 
 Or honor to River's friend exactly 
 To tell them Overgrows six or two drug at ten. 
 wire--electrified--kept damned flexible enough by me I'm chair. 
 Oh says my drop; friend Shrapnel 
 You hear the singer who's a fit. 
 Poor orphaned is Hogs to motored down, 
 As they reached the rope to catch the sword down.
