Here From Heaven. 

 
 There was a planet, breathing doors 
 filled with nostalgic Ambrosia 
 When sick ship meets their place for frost, 
 roving, and faintly, 
 With a promise where the ocean Vaughan 
 Facing the secret thirty-five; 
 And the reins of the hands they wore 
 As of a visit. 
 
 It never came again. Not thou, skittering sentence, 
 The best which wisdom received the world, 
 It was not light and not in a day, 
 Nor the spirit
