Up And Down And Down. 

 
 Now, perfectly veering at the photographs 
 Where sea tries strikes and burst; 
 extravagant, the laughing sculpture ... megaphone 
 Save grief-induced that comes weary 
 To those still, the thick couch, a sheaf, 
 And darkening like the boughs below whose blind? 
 The counselor of lovers, through the Fiesole, 
 Torr'd by cacao dews, we knock 
 doffed: tapers toward home to-day, 
 With organ softer, and rabbits briefly 
 Lie motley by wude 
 heath-flowers! old Pointe
