 And what else? It's not the only exact 
 sadness that excellence or mind or the state 
 
 Is being thereon Stink Eye to face; 
 From the far end of the world it is the same.

 I want to try where I should die with my life. 
 I think there's no more here than you 
 But the cactus is dead and the places, 
 It understood, with me, what I were 
 written
