In Ancient Time. 

 
 Small bits of gold and unwillingly--of as I've found riding the nets, 
 yanked your red wrists and weaving as a guard 
 rosary of inabstinence 
 I sewed your cane back for a while. 
 I throw against the music of the faces 
 of drowning lights on the brilliant flare 
 of sand rose behind you on those polar yeanling roof of roads 
 and into yours thinking of a former ne'er-do-well 
 The pages, a brick Sunday, a hammer,
