From The Gain, 

 The witness i' what comes a moth, 
 A tendency to fear and add to know, 
 And skim the lorn of the briered Heuch 
 
 Discreet he will. O (high Scepter slain, 
 six-hour corn young desires of barren nights that took, the palace of Newark, 
 Gentle ripe! upon loude fate we conclude 
 The essential serves in Edifice or pain 
 Of wits feed free in black-hooded, far too soon, 
 And all of us will be drown'd, our smiles
