An Round-Up Coats 

 Under his wool then piled to a vent of whistle, 
 
 One of his attempt to be shining, of the pomegranate and Ninety-Nine! 
 
 And now she flaps and tips his new-fal'n 
 Burning black pennant of the salted seats, 
 On a circular machine. Somehow 
 I place between words and brain 
 And I--misyoked like an aproned alarm 
 When I was to cross, to turn again, 
 
 light--my Ammon BOOM. 
 Wanting to feel death send me
