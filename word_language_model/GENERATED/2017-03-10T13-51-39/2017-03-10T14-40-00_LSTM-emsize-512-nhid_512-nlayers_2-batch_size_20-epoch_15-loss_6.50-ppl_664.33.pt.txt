 Lord, morning I just awakened 
 so many four, 
 the happy tails of old women, 
 sliding out those divided bellies 
 as far as faces, as Urania! 
 This weeds made them white,

 sodden men aluminum with socks 
 of tumbleweeds. (wet) bowl. 
 Each mornings, my grandfather took grandfather, 
 I knew instead of one grade grog 
 in his bus. My eyes 
 were mine priss,
