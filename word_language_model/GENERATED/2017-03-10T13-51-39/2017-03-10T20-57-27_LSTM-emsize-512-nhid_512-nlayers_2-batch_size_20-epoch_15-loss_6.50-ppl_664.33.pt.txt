Would Be Our Perennial 

 To take a music for hunt to leave us Otemeale, 
 For the tender and soul that flames around her feet 
 She might make us keep out of its crying laughing. 
 So in that beauty we feel the curious joy 
 As of nature, ever she will send no at mind. 
 She sits into cold evening, laugh'd by her bed 
 ferret, still green as the last of the light that contains 
 Her eyes as gently as the echoes
