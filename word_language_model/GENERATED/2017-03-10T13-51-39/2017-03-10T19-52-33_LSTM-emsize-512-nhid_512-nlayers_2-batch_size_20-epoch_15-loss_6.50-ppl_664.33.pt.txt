 Accept that maketh the sidle of the time. 
 
 G-9 and then roared at the end of the darkness, 
 Second towns that cleave the fields for Death and the grenadilla 
 Shakes and spills the lashes down its kiss: 
 The porches make more frequent stones 
 Than the prayer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Picture in the V: 
 
 
 She goes bedfoot it stand well, but I'm 
 In a little pretty July by foes, 
 I'll make her up
