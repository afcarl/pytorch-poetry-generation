Sleep From Light; 

 I have a hand of cleaving be; 
 Gay many raptures have been been fed, 
 And the fever of a wandering cautioning, 
 And the thorns of Love's raiment in red kitchens, 
 Bow for her: and the present features, that glazed 
 The blossom of mountain and glittering night! 
 For when aught forgets how frail a word 
 Hath made it Hellenic Thus to fear. 
 My heart will not be landlady 
 By all the wakeful offices of dandelion aim;
