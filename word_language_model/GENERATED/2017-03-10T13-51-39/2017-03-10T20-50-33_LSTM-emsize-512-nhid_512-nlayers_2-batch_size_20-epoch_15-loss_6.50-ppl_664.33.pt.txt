To Touch. Dominicana, 

 I curse your hope, your prayers, and be 
 Just seven with you, and you can almost see them. 
 You're drunk and you're enough. the pain is solved: 
 it is brother! I was always different from your fur. 
 And the universe's skill does not look upon you, you know, 
 
 and you are true is veneer God of MP's 
 sins for the Church you know. Man is his own ring 
 and the shift keeps on miles down.
