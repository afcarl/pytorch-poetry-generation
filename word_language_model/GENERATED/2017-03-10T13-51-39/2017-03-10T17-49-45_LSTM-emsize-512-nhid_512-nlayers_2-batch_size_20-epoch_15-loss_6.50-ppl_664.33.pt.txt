Loathing 

 To tell me if it bubbles "Variation 
 To the call; 
 Lost boots and cow full cactus 
 Saying use me now; O king, 
 self-gathered, whom I stayed, 
 But God compared my midsummer pen, 
 Which in the humble zone of our world 
 I walk upon the bough, and eke 
 The eave-drops weight of Possess'd 
 Be healed to voices? 
 Find young yet to Love, 
 hand-gripe them, indeed 
 Bringing water! 
 
 By midnight, pith or eight
