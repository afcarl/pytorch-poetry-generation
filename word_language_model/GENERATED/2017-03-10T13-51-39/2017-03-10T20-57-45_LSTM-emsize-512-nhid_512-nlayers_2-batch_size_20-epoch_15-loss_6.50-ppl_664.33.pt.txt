 Know, I hear, I remember. 
 
 
 II 
 
 Kind old sunrise stands 
 
 On her cheek. I love her in million ways, 
 
 Alas! yet I like a moon that is me. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Headed and Bells 
 
 
 We, Saddens the raging living of all our hearts had no more 
 More fat than the cries of our natural discipline, 
 The down-dugged Walking on the green
