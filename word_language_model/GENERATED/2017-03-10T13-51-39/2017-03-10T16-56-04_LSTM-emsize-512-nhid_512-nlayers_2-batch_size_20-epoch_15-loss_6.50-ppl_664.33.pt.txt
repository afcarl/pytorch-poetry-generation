Eyes, 

 Like tin and passionless feathers of the sea, 
 When, men before me gazed again, 
 Have shed with unseen dirt on my heels 
 In peace as solitude. 
 First trestle-tables. my farewell, he would uncover 
 Stars aloft, his wild love, ever rode his showroom. 
 For boys, in terror then my eyes have cast 
 Each in one hue, his face, his hands now mine, 
 I seek not woodlands give no rest, 
 They reach them, I aft his own.
