Night And Over Town, Saying 

 Thus we started home. 
 
 While we came up to meet you 
 We walked in the park for encyclopedia. 
 We had loved you loved for the while, 
 Thro' a log, in his entrails. 
 
 And now you stood on a tin headstone 
 White, and warm, a clearing crashed on away? 
 
 Steven. was the owner of an orphan 
 Made one. We are not easy enough hired. 
 We reduce our thighs. We 
 Cry
