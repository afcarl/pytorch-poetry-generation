Afternoon, 

 its stranger sees the one whose thoughts 
 are perfectly trained of budgerigar 
 poplar after mandolin--Lung roofs, half 
 wide arches hang the half-stifled 
 journal, the pining whispering. 
 Quit, dread i' us; we sing there, what rage, 
 surrounding the chaos of the sea. 
 
 "Since they had stolen him? 
 
 However, God has the way of cookies 
 and now his mountain Moloch! Virginian tries a science of trays, 
 Lot's free PBS--narrated planets, rabbit wool otter's cobra-hood 
 Save
