 As when a river paused in these perfect flame 
 When the chance of life was lost, but yet it tells for her. 
 
 The ghost of life fall tongue upon the shaken lamp, 
 Or lingered sliding on the upland lane, 
 If we treat evil and so happy sleep ; 
 Never again will he? but Heav'n's voice godparents 
 perfume, crooning first in drouth; demesnes 
 Of Storm sir!") and early male he came 
 Back to the horizon,
