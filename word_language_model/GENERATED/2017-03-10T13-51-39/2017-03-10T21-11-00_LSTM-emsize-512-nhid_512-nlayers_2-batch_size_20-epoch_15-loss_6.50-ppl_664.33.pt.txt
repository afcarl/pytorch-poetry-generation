Weather. 

 
 But that night, while the journey of God is calling 
 Out of lily-bell dealing. 
 The brown yellow kiss I make darker sense 
 Does causelessly. and knighthood, howl; 
 And yet but harass and honey in vain; 
 This miracle of young and thoughtful stupidness. 
 
 O Heav'n! come down to grant every object 
 To change who be, where demand 
 
 Thy words to slip of haste; beholders! 
 
 I leave thee so soon, our race hang free
