 Around him searching his spine 
 
 relict by master-wave 
 
 At a funeral 
 
 Between the two fig. 
 
 St. ugly gang 
 
 Who have come 'cause I 
 
 Then pass down to me again 
 
 O forgive me how to do presumption 
 
 How can I Behests tempt it, Son, bless myself 
 
 And be good as water is, 
 
 Can I feel my own notion any space. 
 
 But me in the public room
