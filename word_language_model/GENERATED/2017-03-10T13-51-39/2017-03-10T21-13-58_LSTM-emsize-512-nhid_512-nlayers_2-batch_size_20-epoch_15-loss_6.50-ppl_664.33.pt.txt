 
 What did I did with my will 
 Hear you, give me my stalked, wife. 
 Life, with me thou Mansion by the hearth, 
 But neither would I greatly pray, 
 Or Owls offence for English fame; 
 Satin or Shore, or sometimes dress or stain. 
 
 VI 
 Hoping that the body should live 
 Only and hear the sounds Chatterleys 
 And the long cliff of that hue Chiliasm. 
 Which saith it sounds so pure and fair 
 Shall spit clear
