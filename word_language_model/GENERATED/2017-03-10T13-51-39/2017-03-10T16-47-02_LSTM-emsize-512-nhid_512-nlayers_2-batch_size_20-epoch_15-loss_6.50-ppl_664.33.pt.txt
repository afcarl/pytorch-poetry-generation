The Mob 

 
 I think my name might 
 be in and out of all others, 
 I have come lout 
 I'm standing there ever free. There are always 
 assistant stitched across it. 
 My address is a clingstone 
 I have survived, for knowst, 
 We take it to the Shakespeare of 'roun' Kings 
 Then either, and instead, the screen, 
 The Nile returning through [jumpsuits] 
 And who could lead on; 
 A child's head where a boy would pour down
