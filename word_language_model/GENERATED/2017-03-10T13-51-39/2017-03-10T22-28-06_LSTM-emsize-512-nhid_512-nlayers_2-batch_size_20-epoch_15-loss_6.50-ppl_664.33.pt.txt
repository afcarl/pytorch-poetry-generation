To Take From The Vegetable Tree: 

 His face is neither voice, nor the sun nor the way, 
 androgynous; 
 As more strong than the sack-hooded 
 In a rumble sharp as dust, Erratics 
 Or brass with scented motion, 
 As a paradise, unkennable 
 Mysterious (which makes 
 Its love diminution at the ends of doors; 
 Snow to pine and Verrio and decay and squid 
 With a bare sound to bind weighingabout 
 Of the hunger's Thunder, and sings 
 In his ear,
