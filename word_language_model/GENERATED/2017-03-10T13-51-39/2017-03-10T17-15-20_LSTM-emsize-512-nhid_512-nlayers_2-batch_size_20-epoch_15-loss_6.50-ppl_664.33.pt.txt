 Ask old Hope 
 
 
 If yet I feel speed.--"Vision because 
 I want to trick my song 
 And scorn one's strokes with tears, 
 I won't taste my balance at the door. 
 My gaffing. touched me, whom did I go?

 And yet the whole of time's country 
 Flesh takin' it counted too firmly 
 To bear for unsubstanceblack.
