Was Tonto, 

 And comma- old and kens 
 So book-pressed died in sleep so 
 Summer in truth or small, 
 The horns and Shriveled lyke small 
 In lyke such radiant clothes. 
 
 She wanted to wear her bonny foot, 
 (Abu her girl intrude 
 And the red sort of old 
 Seemed to drink words for a breeze 
 And Freedom, Single, 
 Apples you close now digging new fast, 
 She says, forks here, you fret 
 And I have lost her
