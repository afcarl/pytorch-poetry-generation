The Abeyance, 

 The Stubborn Low returned 
 
 On his gray inexhausted hem, 
 As I put my hand, to play ashes, 
 As to catch it when I took inside. 
 
 At which I parted fists and pebbles moved 
 To see as if a thankless clipper owner; 
 Past you"; and sloping away. 
 Beside next-next. earned; locks the buskin'd roar 
 
 And storm of hand and shades, stand upward on evening's grape. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Education of mix,
