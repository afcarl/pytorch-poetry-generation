Asks. 

 
 And 
 for what is the form 
 of my everyday fruit: 
 that made me a grimace, a cry; 
 I am Nietzsche, so many things to go down. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Consolation 
 
 
 We're pleased at all, there must be no way to this. 
 No Book used to slay you -- 
 You keep your brother. Why do you bring you 
 forever, and will show all the boards with your tread, 
 How the hairs meets
