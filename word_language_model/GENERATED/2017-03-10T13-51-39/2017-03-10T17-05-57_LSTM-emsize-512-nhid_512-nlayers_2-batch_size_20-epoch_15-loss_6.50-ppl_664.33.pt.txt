 
 But Bacchus finds a concentration gar 
 To the eye you offer for his neck 
 Who puts away the strange in the mast! 
 grating, he made inquiry with the dead. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Roughage 
 
 
 On the Smoke Sunday 
 Summer is all beginning 
 I am carried in myself 
 As I lay down your window 
 And play your clothes for lunch limpid hair. 
 With a chain of exotic buzzing near the head
