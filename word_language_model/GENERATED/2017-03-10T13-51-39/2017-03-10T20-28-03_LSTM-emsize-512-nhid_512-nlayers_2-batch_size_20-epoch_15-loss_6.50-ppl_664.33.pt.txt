 In such a shape the absence sings, 
 Sweating, thy hand and kings; and lips, 
 Thy body, and camaraderie, 
 Of fuller, Elanor--Woke Orphant 
 
 That wild doubt-- and marvelously prop, 
 Those hope will taken me, but I know 
 Those leaves across the ground, thou attorney, 
 Thine magnificent lover, or jealousy 
 Times gems of Jerusalem, 
 Where signs deed! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 My Prayer alternate, 
 
 
 Oh! "violent lady, now say remedies 
 Of these
