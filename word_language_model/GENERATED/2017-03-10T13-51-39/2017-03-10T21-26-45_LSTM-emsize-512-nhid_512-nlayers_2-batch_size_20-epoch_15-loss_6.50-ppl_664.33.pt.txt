Of A Flower 

 I shall snap resting clear of ice, 
 And the bright bishop will fly through us, 
 What we dwelt and what in me you saw. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Account of Stars 
 
 
 This sea of angel blooms into the bones, how often they become. 
 This baby's body, there would not be shrill: 
 That one bird hov'ring out his own heart, (156) 
 So a long time may write a book to just look, 
 It
