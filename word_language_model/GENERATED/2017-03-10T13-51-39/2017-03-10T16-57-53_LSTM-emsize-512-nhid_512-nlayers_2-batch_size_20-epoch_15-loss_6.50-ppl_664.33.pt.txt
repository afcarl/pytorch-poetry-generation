Alice The River 

 Messenger and a veriest celebrated, 
 
 For a carriage, a trickle of pale fever, 
 Its penis bent and medical as we wept, 
 Hungry as high as pitiless pools, 
 On the lazy border, or else 
 At the close head of Africa we trod; 
 Florentine out on Antartic; 
 But all this music we have lived at crainte they were all time-layerd 
 We're going opposite by this time abroad 
 At old earth; 
 Come then! 
 Till for
