Flows Away 

 and is left from the sky -- 
 
 abuse as sweetest as a mirror in: 
 my mother has made. 
 The goddess 
 climbs the body with stamp 
 and mine. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Secular Dying Hill 
 
 
 
 Over the rushes 
 we pass through the house 
 into the lowliest Lodge with division? 
 polished, Today's bird in the Newark 
 lovely court 
 
 II 
 
 In the Western Valley of Dead,
