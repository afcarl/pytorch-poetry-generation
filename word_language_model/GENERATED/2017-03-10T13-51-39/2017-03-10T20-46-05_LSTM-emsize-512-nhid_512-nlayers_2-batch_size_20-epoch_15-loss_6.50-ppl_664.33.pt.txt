 
 Still driven now rolling she into the back seat 
 
 Of a human heart in space and twisted the impulse of one gulfs, 
 
 In a second final spell I can see the orange sound 
 
 I ask of his own muscle, as good, rights hard 
 
 I'll grow and comfort when I'm coming, for them 
 
 But not forgotten, turn to life, -- redouble: 
 
 I fare to tell them that bulky heart replicated 
 
 To love her
