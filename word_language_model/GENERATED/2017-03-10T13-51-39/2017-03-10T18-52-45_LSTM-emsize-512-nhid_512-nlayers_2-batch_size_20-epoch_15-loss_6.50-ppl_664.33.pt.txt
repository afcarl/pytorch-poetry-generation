To Feed, 

 
 a few great black bull 
 in Central kind: nothing far 
 floating down toward him 
 the rabbit has barking anything 
 dross: the power it was. 
 Colinet is now as in land and square 
 by a mountain and a tent must rise 
 with a block of light. There is a 
 lethal tongue: Always 
 this day, when the moon took 
 it with rain. It won't turn 
 but blank this steel we want a deep glove in
