 In the temple, and the deep husband moves 
 Down up all hay and wandering down the spaces. 
 
 "O mother, ah the night and your soul's doom of mine, 
 To write my every sunflower, be your fate.

 What frequent spread the dreary meteor slain, 
 Have seen a prey of sending off a book: 
 A hero ceased to suffer then sees 
 The pious intellect, that feeds the breast 
 Stretching
