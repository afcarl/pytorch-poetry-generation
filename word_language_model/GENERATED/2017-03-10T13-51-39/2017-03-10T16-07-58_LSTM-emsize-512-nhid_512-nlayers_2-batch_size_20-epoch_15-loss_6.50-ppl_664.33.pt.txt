 But he lends it extremes, get the corner of it 
 And then up along the stairs, the woman rings 
 Its nuts and water above it as it takes it in. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Want 
 
 
 Think of that, we will be on the banks and rise of the Student Falling untold, leaving the way to our minds I cannot master you regret who know
