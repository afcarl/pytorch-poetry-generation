 When the poor nation came to me 
 With a spread flirt like a dreamscape 
 For a little smith potent, vision 
 Of roamer-lonely, and released from of fairyland.' 
 In the margin, exhaled, I dreamt again 
 I would have had that fad and sprang into the mist, 
 There was in that little army -- 
 That it should have been, and once give.

 So later, when Death drove onward
