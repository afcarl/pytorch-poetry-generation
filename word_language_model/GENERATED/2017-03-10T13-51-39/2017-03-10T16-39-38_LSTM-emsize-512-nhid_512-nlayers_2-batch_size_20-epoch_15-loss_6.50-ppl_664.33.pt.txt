The Ants Down 

 AMERICA, patterns like phantoms on trees. 
 When he was born of a far flower. 
 Two wars might bend things as if liegt 
 They told him that passionate England 
 They should but fear no living for his voice. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Warm J 
 
 
 I am a liquid black civility: 
 all I could by dance now 
 a thriving bottom 
 her ring arriving up to her tears, 
 but I could imagine 
 her.
