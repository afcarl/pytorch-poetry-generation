Like An Envelope Of The Ice. 

 
 The elements and thine? Nothing 
 looked down in the seas 
 Fall loose from dull. 
 No coherence. 
 Who look at us less swift and less, 
 Eternity fallows in the stars, 
 Adonis of praise? 
 
 Asian hills without success 
 From milk, dominate monstrous sullen light, 
 I could not wait for long slow -- Sofas as if fireside: Houses or along the wave's bank, 
 And as of the day I asked to hear
