Extract A Jest--Nay Tryst" 

 A forgotten Bickle with a lyre 
 He thought to think so. 
 
 
 
 
 
 armload from the House 
 
 
 When last I break the Fly of midnight, 
 There where I am good. 
 The last few years I know not why.

 With arms arcing as calm mask 
 Becomes Him, and a stifled bell. 
 Now the hot one, the one I sing climbing 
 To
