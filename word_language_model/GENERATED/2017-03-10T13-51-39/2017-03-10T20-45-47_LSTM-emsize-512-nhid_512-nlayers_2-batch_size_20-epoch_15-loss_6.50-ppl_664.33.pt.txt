From The Heat Or Light, 

 Where I go in the stuck sun. Then there's Dan 
 cosy breath on my right arm which is still dead 
 From the final far dance or a picture. 
 
 A quarter Anselm with wrath; 
 matamore 
 You have some ways, 
 earlier 
 Empty & harm for you or hit yourself 
 Go down, my hands always draw 
 namers, your purse. From it he goes 
 lordship's and sundered so much to see a naked man
