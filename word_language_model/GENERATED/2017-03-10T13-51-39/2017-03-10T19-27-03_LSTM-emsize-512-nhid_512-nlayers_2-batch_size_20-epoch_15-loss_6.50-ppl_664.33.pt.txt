Now, 

 The strife my folds: through living days 
 In such a circle of luncheons, 
 O, for a taste of money is Reddish 
 
 He floats over the ceiling. Finally the young creation keys. 
 
 I lift my pillow with the finger of my face. 
 I nurse alone, and sit next door, till I sleep. 
 I fear she take them asleep, Till through the gleam 
 I've walked in the night and up where 'twas eating stem 
 And sometimes damned stone
