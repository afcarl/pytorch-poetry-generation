 
 
 I love but for my yearn--accursed 
 
 And I say to him I do not think of. 
 
 
 What more in the living room, and stripped times 
 The wagon of worth to say the shame of the reluctance 
 Now in its oven, some short afternoon, 
 The sky is too much for us to stay. 
 
 As men in the Swamp calm memory's chill 
 Of old rings scattered around with the stars, 
 Time is our love in
