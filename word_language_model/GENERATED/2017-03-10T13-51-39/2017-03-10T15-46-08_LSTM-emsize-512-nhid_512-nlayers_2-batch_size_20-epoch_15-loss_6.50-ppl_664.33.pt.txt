Know, Get Way. 

 Not a map. 
 
 I forgot myself had said 
 You were not gentle as to be arm-chair 
 But we were. Let us discreetly 
 Its fearsome and our full towers, 
 Feel the time to assuage us 
 With our souls, we have done by. 
 Maybe we could have questions 
 About him, was it a plan, 
 Unless mankind be at 
 The best they ever boast, 
 And they laughed we could just see 
 A Religion for
