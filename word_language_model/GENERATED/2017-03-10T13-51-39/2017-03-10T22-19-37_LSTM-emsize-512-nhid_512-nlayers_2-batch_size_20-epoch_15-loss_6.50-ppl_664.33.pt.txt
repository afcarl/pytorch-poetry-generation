 An reverently, gift of smoke, 
 A spak of lovers awake, 
 Bitter and clean as he lies on their forearm, 
 As they pass the flakes they crushes eye without at hand, 
 quicksilver, granite and crowns and whirlwind light, 
 Seemed like a train full of undergrowe. 
 And on the scents of the host they say, 
 How many sweet ships in sunset drink the flood 
 Of fruit they blaze together. Then windward only, 
 The wishing of some stops will break that
