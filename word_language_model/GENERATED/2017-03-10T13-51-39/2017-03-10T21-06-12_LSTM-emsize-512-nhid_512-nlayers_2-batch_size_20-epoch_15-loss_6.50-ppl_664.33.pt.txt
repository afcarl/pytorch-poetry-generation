 
 Don't eat before you are afraid, 
 
 "And the kind will show her trust 
 
 Do her praise.

 Hang unfix and purple both old things too; 
 
 Hard for her age, 
 
 White rare alarms: 
 
 Safe and the lewed Roanoke, 
 
 (But washed above the rearview rout, 
 
 And melt the dread, 
 
 First here she cannot jam and wonder 
 
 Divine; the best; she dozed in two.
