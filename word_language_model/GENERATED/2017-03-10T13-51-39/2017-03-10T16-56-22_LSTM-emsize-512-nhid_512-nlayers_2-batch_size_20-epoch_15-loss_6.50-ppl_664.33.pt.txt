All,' Following The Street, 

 tasting the grey borders of a file of prophets 
 Ashes to ben death. 
 
 They have grown cold 
 and New IV 
 As we take you far away, 
 they sleep without wonder 
 
 if there were shadow between them hangnail 
 There's proof of love, and about. It isn't thou, 
 and how will I rather not? They wont it. 
 But now, if we went to see our family, 
 I'm waiting, then, kept my horror on
