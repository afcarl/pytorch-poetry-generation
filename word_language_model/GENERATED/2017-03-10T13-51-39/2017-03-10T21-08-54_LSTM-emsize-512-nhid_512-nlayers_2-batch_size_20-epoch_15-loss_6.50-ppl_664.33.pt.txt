 As a child is born for unseen, 
 To see how beautiful the rich 
 Of mankind, 
 Could the winds have a Carkases 
 And the Pilot's one, 
 Though for our sake strong, both perfect and bright; 
 That they do not cry again. 
 
 The night is getting downward fifty-two. 
 Thus he watches the dead shore ; 
 But never from ourselves that go, 
 Should sit and rest
