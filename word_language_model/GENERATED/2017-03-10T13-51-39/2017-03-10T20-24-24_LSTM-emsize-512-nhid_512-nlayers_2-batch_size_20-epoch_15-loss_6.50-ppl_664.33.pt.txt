The Ravisher Spread 

 And wove the lamb for the passionate years. 
 
 In N or in river-divide. Amichai 
 For age you lack in me with sinful source, 
 Ground out, fountains, farre with noble shells. 
 
 O tell who dust can make such fancy from 
 Mean golden one for me to die; 
 Which is now: me? I urges to ply 
 Thee, in whose lesser spirit, and many destiny 
 Both things which convolvulus, Panim desires; 
 Which for all sorrows nations
