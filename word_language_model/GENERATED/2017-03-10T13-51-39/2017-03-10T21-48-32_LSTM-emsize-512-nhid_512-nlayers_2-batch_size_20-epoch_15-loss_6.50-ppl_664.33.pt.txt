Coarse Arms. 

 
 O slumbering Kerouack 
 (O old Christ trembles in a vale 
 Of Spirit to recreate his foosty-faced 
 Sad feare 
 He throat. His support, to say 
 Is unguent, two Stanzas tightly 
 And does not wear away a spangles 
 With B. Gaslight or chorus. 
 
 And when his muse all war is wooed with him. 
 Why dear, so ranged sweet he are! 
 
 Ye shoves at home more wonderful 
 Than our beloved language 
 For something
