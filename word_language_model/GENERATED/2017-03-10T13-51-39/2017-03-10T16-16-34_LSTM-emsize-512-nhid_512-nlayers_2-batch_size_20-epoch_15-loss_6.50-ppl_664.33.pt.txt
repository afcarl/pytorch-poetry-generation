Unborn Cheer'D Of Hours, 

 precocious. 
 
 Only Love, as if up to, a subway thick 
 coloured hole on the southern grass 
 radio, and we see, Consummate tomb; 
 Once we must wait for this, left today, 
 Doing our hands, now odors never had. 
 But no body returns between us, its desire 
 Eyes like his carriage, the voices of the blood. 
 & Nature on our Alley. 
 Who think alone that He was to the dead; 
 He only having season
