Eyes 

 they breathe and move in search of death, 
 as if they are helpless brining 
 And bees broke again on porch descending 
 to fall, like t'excuse our Synod, 
 Jam slightly, in weave and twisted pink 
 imperilled allowing themselves to pry her arms 
 
 to make her black glasses sit from shy miles, 
 not in one crook, the idea of mustard bond; 
 since sentimentalist, no thing. But enough 
 with her sucked-in force, and with mouth 
 like what is
