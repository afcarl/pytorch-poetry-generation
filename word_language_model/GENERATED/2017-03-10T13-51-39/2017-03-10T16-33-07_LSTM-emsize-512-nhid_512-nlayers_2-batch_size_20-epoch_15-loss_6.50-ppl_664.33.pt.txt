Not Forget They Are Well-Fed, 

 
 I know I could sleep and go straight. 
 One day when I go by. 
 light alive, my mother and I are going to die again on the ground. 
 But they said we'll go w/ 
 "Who could be the flood; 
 And her eyes their hair kept off 
 both smoke. We knew it would have been never long before. 
 
 
 
 Say it was the way he felt, 
 And soon thing they didn't believe
