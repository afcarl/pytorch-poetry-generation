 
 That Thames was Deathbed in a' books, 
 
 of something hidden, from the fields, 
 Picking it as dustpan. But wash 
 
 like bats beneath motion 
 
 over a spiral birch water; 
 
 plan--it is everywhere 
 
 "Mugging, Humanities?" 
 
 As basket enters the porch. 
 
 Or the real, a goat's sheath 
 
 can worry nothing but this life. Only 
 
 
 insecurities 
 
 At this moment Peers like famous contrivance 
 we built in water
