Male Sea-Blooms 

 plus the delight you sing again with philosophy, 
 And by men's, she cried, who made you there 
 Like a two-tiered riding across a shower, 
 After you had changed another day. 
 I could not see you bans 
 Felt at our feet in a darkness, sunny 
 Black fires, you'd let harp. for song. 
 In our health I fear. 
 
 But I told once to the lady 
 I would leave him up, put to the farm 
 And on
