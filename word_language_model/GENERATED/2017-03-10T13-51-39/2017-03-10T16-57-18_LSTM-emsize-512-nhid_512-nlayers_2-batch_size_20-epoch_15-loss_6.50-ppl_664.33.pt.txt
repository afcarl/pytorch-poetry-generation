Gone 

 Next to him. 
 Then, on the vacant waist. 
 
 The door is hatching 
 through the great weight. All the And rise 
 carrying the crust of my attention. 
 The clock I am sitting 
 toward the floor 
 
 of our childhood 
 star, 
 when the camera squats 
 over his glittering, Making 
 a sixpence of cement 
 just when the heart 
 splits wound like rain 
 running down 
 like a slightly shower 
 somewhere like a tree
