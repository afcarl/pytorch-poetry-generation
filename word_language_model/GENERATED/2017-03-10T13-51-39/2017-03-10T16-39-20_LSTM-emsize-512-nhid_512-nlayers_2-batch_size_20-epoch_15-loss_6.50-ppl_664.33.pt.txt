Constrain Us In, 

 cancers and sparkling their flooding eyes 
 her--what sparks and wine, 
 The nameless beings of old days 
 Behold the words' sick and white, 
 The dolls say, the day's old god last desolate 
 As calm as the gods, so pure as dry. 
 The people early there are all need flow 
 In the same late afternoon three days 
 We'll speak to anyone else behind her 
 To be red and red as the old empty court, 
 stomach's in
