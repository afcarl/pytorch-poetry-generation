Soft Time; 

 of all my heart, of more grateful obsess 
 Than heavenly kind of sentence, I tell and build 
 the treasure from this streams? Which I hate 
 its fearless word, its tiny kitchens, its own growing slow ah-ahh, 
 but no, not even a moment I will take myself 
 these flights to thy own nature's cause I am sunk 
 by that demon with its wedged and a soul. 
 
 
 
 
 
 No soon: no Story
