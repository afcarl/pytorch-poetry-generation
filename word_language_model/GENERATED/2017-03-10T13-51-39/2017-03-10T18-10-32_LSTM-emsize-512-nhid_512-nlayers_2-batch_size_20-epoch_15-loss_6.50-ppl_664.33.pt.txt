Men, 

 And lives from earth. 
 solidities of willows are where never 
 prees. but together 
 pentameter's about the human will, 
 Nor Horror in a long aventurine parts 
 With no social course for slumber, except 
 Chairs for presence that for being found. 
 And so we write: in that German metaphysical 
 Tesco's. frayed. fleet. 
 What art thou, O offence of joy! 
 From what weary thou wilt burn upon thee, 
 Then, 1000 books should live as we! 
 I know
