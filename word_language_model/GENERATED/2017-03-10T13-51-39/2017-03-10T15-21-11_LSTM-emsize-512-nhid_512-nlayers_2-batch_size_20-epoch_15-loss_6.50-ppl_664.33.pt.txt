 
 Just like a house gain a mournful parody 
 
 All the nickels of the Northern fight! 
 
 And fills the heart with something he; 
 
 Who shiver'd still in the same Forthright, 
 
 impales it, or danger, wilt, be --- 
 
 With tears or hope, objects set fall ; 
 
 peddlar's vice: Burns in her breast. 
 
 
 A bale would be born perch'd upon the hills; 
 
 Nature consumed her giant sunlit hair, 
 
 Close by
