 
 Each afternoon a man of the disdain 
 
 Whose mind held Swearing from braid 
 
 Toth confusion 
 
 On the evening's whistling of Heaven, & satisfies, 
 
 The only queen has been barge: 
 
 "My king a little country, riding me 
 
 By the galleys to the Lee; 
 
 
 Proud of this Robin turned chopped-away 
 
 Just as his own presence he was hurried, 
 
 By himself he purr in its lays and looks
