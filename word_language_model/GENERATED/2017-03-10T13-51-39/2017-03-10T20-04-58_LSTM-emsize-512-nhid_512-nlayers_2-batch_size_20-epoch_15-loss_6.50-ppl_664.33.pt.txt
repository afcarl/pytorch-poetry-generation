The Sun 

 Rode on, fall, rising, until 
 Fell round and round the outstripping bore 
 The awful lowness disease, and love, 
 But wondrous madness here in nature hast been, 
 I loved for my love to be little at last, 
 Cut it in the air, when I was gone; 
 If I could say: I, to Either how it done. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Shiloh: A Window 
 
 
 Every time yes. 
 What should He fathom he would ha' read
