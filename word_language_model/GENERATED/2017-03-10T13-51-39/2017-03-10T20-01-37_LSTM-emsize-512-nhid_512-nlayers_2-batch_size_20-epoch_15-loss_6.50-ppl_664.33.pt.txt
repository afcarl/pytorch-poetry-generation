River, Of Fiesta Fear; 

 silenter than some sweetness as it is, 
 And this young Body of humble; flew low 
 Upon the Ocean, Definitive unflitme 
 Round for the wooin hour it shed 
 All round about both stars and yourselves: 
 And house; by river made and hurried throng, 
 Ambrosial, chance glide out to cloudy wheels, 
 And darted round the icy bridegroom's stream 
 Superior, and youthful born of one by one, 
 Echo of spotless Albion's thorn and flows, 
 Rocks, glittered
