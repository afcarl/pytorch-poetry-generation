The Willing Bay, 

 How waited in the eye should meet 
 By humming sounds as it broke, we grazed 
 The rose grows dead; 
 And the sun's tears began to roar, 
 While sleep or sea; our hope, which unhope.

 With grey-winged tears like a girl's, like fire. 
 The long, black ballad is dearest and fair! 
 Then six Mays, shook the stair, 
 The vines are stillness on the frozen shore, 
 While peristalsis,
