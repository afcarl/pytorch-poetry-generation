Head, The Rear Of Scum 

 Upon his births this sent: 
 
 XXIV 
 O the eternal leaf, no power shall hold, 
 Tho' ever or tomorrow or time,-- or sense, 
 A quiet, as a dividing dawn; the God 
 Whose right hand is bold and darling, like a wine . . 
 Will bring their eyelashes from hands to shine in bloom 
 But from the gentle cities in the lawn, 
 fruitless, there in his cane to make Morpheus 
 Of a merry pris'ner
