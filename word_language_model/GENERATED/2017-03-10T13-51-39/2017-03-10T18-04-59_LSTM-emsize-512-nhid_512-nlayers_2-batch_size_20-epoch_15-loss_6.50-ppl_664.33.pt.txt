 
 And again I see that when the light 
 Real, for it is the prime of building 
 As the clouds have used the door walls and the rocks 
 seemst and waiting and likeness. 
 
 The air is chill to the little sea, 
 I am homes I can't mean. 
 We rise into pain, and we shall be blowing 
 green leaves above, the sun blown by, 
 Goethe's ghost of ages, is an Oglala 
 Wearing the burnished din, the hills
