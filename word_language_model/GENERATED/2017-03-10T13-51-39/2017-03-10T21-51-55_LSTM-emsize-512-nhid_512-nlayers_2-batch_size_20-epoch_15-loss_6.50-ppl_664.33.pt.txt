 A swallow's muscle, humming near on death, 
 Serenade on my pitch and foibles 
 sixty-two impeachment. wee, #9002 plumaged 
 swylce charge scalp? fleshed throat backed 
 ... The possibilities of my hair; 
 As do Gates? if late is done. shoe-buckles rules ... 
 
 I've watched the lilac guard-- 
 And the pink wheels pour on nursed, and cell 
 Stood shaping into one pulse 
 Of the entire current
