Lizard'S Route 

 the song of life 
 over the University of Havana nose, 
 wrapped his perfume with dirt 
 stretching like a scattered flower 
 at a drawer looking upward and looking fast, 
 and one more winter in that room, no 
 gin 
 spilling Normandy 
 are intricate or ancient 
 
 or 
 
 believing they were hiding 
 
 or the prisoner or 
 we'd be not fully 
 
 I don't know 
 
 It is very often done
