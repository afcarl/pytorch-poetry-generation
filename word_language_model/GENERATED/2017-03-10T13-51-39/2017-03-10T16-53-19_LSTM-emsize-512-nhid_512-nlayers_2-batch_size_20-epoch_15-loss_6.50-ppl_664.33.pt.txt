Strife That Withdrawn Their Thoughts 

 
 on being washed searchest own hole, and ascended 
 it big-handed like a belt of chipped mud 
 on ugliness, us prince of blade 
 on all spring. There are only angels, 
 the stones were full of stars. They don't know my world. 
 
 But the halves of his time, after several days 
 the Judah's wife is still meant to remember exits 
 and my sister had a shot, on mimicking, 
 old husband, end in the dark
