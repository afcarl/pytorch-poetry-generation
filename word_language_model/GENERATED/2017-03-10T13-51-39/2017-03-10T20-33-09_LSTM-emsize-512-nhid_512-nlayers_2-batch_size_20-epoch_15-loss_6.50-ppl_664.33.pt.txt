To Know 

 How does a field so fresh or strange. 
 Words never bone.

 No sooner says the nymph blessing's me: say you anger. 
 As long as I may, your last Santa poison prayer. 
 And if your life be bemoan, you should match it with woe. 
 
 ps not tensile leave what you behold 
 Where trees hold boldly-to the cloud 
 And the dark waters articulately, and the sky 
 Is well."
