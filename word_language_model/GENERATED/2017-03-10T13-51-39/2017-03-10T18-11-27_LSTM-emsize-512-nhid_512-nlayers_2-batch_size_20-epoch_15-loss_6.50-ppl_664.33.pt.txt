Closed. Had They Scrims 

 They must condemn, but they might find things 
 So many deaths, gone to the bodies of good men, 
 Things resting quietly to play morning and maim 
 The great pups led, 
 Sink and fiction. We talked for death on the last meadowlands. 
 abalone, us in labor, up to that lake. 
 But again I remember the words to see that day, 
 Modin and then remember, hid in my blood, 
 holms and loe Thee, battles men, but love
