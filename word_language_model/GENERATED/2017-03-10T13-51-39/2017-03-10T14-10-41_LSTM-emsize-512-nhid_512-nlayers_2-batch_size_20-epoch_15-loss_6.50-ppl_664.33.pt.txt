 Deep in the dismantled Ireland 
 Where goodly days appeared 
 We tended as death to mine, 
 And preserved souls that die Adventure 
 Fortune is law, all things are fill'd with science --

 The old girl with them in white coat patty 
 Like a stray train'd blanket of the sun, -- 
 O the Ducks ring on her very way helpless couch 
 Has already seen
