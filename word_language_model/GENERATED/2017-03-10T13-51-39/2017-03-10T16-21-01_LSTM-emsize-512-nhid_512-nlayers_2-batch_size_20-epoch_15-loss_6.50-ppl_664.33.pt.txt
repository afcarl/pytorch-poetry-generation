Mother Of Departed Infantilized, 

 Well through all creatures dawnless dynasties; 
 Heav'n crouches out by plastic, 
 And pointed head down the line. 
 
 XXV 
 In whose house the lights these are seen 
 In pure logs that has been Portrait of breath 
 And stock that never suffered 
 Makes the light turn toward them now, awaken'd 
 From life that they have trembled from hours 
 
 For dream of this pure violet Christ 
 
 And the spirit of time's real soul
