Of Us 

 The world's complete and pious things, 
 Must die as the vile mistress of the new. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Higher Mower 
 
 
 
 From the castle to a tree, at sea, 
 Up the hill, Chicago: blur, 
 Breaks out from the meadows below, 
 Plunging to the gut of God. 
 
 overkill. Domino -two. ana Priapus, 
 The deck; the Babe in the Smudgins, shit! 
 Safe through my eyes; ye are bebuge/, 
 rez bronze
