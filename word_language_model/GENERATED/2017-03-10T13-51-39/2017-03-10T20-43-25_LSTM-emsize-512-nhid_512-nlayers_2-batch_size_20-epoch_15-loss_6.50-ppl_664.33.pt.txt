With A Bond On Which No Men 

 Could another, lying on lemon- Square, 
 
 for Louis whom the gods began, when they 
 nodded the earth with their faces, and both sweet 
 and white; I woke to death. When I thought we were 
 breaking this moment by my wife's uncut skin. 
 Here the phone jerks a thousand years; 
 and the short measured world which above me is 
 the same story cypress (ah) 
 as of spearmen legs and groans are clean,
