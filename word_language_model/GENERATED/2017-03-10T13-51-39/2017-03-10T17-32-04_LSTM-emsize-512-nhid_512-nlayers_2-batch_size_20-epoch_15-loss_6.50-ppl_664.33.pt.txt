Me To A Brain. 

 There must be others less, save now still and eight-- 
 As though it took to the shoulder of the house 
 From fire to the world without time to waste 
 It is one to be glad, 
 But that love don't make lightest noise in me. 
 I am caught in the Vast; 
 Where will I freeze myself and say MORGUE 
 
 And if you the: feed the Wimpy says you like 
 A Ideal, Or sniff it first,
