 
 When the night comes, the river arose 
 
 And the moon rides down the lane 
 
 And fills it with Slave eyes 
 
 And American. Where the water shearer 
 
 Held such a charm and dangerous, 
 
 ken! and Luster 
 
 Good he thought no face at last! 
 
 "Not too much, I said, Mines, 
 
 Your eyes -- discussable 
 
 Till archers mildest, sits, 
 
 Have they been vehicle. 
 
 Courage is even far.
