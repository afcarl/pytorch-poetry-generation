 
 I wake upon this little end. 
 
 
 II 
 
 If it, Him, come: must be, 
 
 Through the seasons of so serious Middagh 
 
 These are the Jews, and still from earth, 
 
 They learn no more to see or free, 
 
 Nor dare they, for they are old and nations intellectuals, 
 
 The world's anchor. 
 
 Whatever He must take be, 
 
 But no farm-girl, "cherub; 
 
 No way at the 36 or through
