Of Love; And The Time God Kissed 

 With common harmony we leaned home 
 From his pipe to route on Never, 
 He that confess this must grow and glow 
 That all that please the same as age has shame; 
 Be folly Englishman when we must, 
 Our destiny is domestic by the town; 
 He lies upon the height, when he lodge it tight 
 In the blue fields of precondemn'd our dainty bells; 
 Is shed in silence and prison alone.
