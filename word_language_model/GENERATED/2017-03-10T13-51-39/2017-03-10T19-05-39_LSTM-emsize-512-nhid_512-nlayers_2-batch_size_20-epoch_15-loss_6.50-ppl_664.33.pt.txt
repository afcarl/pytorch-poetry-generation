 
 With a chilly noise 
 Forever as if they didn't recall 
 
 Your children of lovers leans 
 Slowly before dawn, kindred 
 As the wind from the tall boats 
 
 You lay back before throwing you home; 
 I don't want to go. 
 
 When you've come you away? 
 We stayed on long for walking, 
 even for tux, and excessive we 
 wold and Fish up ratios and her!) 
 The flap of ice, a mighty psyche's 
 Flounced along
