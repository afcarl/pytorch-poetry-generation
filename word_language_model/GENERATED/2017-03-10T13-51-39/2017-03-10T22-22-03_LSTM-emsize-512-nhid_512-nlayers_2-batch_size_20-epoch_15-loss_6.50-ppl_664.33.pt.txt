Into Smoke, 

 a trick to tell why it stirs rests, as light knives, 
 unfortunately nothing but haul over this bank 
 and fresh to see the fists on the floor 
 and Speed a green spruce through the trees and the dust blow over 
 and the echo of a flower in a telephone one-two. 
 
 Once more the fabulous tribes 
 cast together, leather, glittering near 
 the best of the driveway Naomi, the galloping metal 
 and sinks deep at last at show
