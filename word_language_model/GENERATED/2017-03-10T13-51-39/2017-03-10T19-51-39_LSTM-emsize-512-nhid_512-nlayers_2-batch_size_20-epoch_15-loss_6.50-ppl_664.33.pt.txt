And Damp Halls: 

 Mount Hester tender now, of conductivity 
 clarifying gear and scrub pools of Time! 
 Golden homes, and splash of bitter wine, 
 A spirit bow. 
 Even from long mouths is even young. 
 
 elf-girls pictures and lamplight low. 
 Man's loaf of forehead in the heart of form? 
 
 precipitated through the western shore; the exiles lie. 
 Thunder of art; frog, pressure and tar 
 Puts out the long slow air among the burning glebe 
 He hammered stunned
