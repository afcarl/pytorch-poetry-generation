Longing For It, Lest The Clouds 

 Gives any Jenny mounted there 
 Since all the way; studious of joy 
 And every sense of being November. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Train 
 
 
 To the evening 
 We 
 
 Sing a little song not to be charged 
 With the blow of a flower or grain a spire, 
 A pallid suitcase twitching hands 
 And ["Do not ease our eyes at the (driving) 
 Such secure in the dying furnace
