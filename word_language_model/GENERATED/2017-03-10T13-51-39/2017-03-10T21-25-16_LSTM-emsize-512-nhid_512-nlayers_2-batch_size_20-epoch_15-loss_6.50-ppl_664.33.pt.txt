Tears. 

 
 As oft they wheeled their endless dung to show and shine 
 Once ragged hyrde destitute lubricity 
 cicada's whispering sonofabitch, late in town, 
 Such in this manner did occupy a shore 
 Of young men and between, gutters; they did not press up all tea over the board. 
 
 Later it was impossible to bury us out of the atmosphere of Square, 
 Was it only forgiv'n, like a Impulsive, Logic of ideas 
 Who whines to eat there 
 with them
