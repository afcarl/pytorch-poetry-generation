 
 One is the same sin 
 We can think he'll be small, 
 The calculated must be done 
 
 And wandering at it all, it is not so firm 
 Beneath the new earth to its stage and its sleep 
 behoof; us only by the walks or soft gold; 
 Were we removed downward down and all did cast 
 Our eyes up vermint. like a desire to go. 
 
 level: 
 Ther-to if you aim to be 
 Black 
 Your talk
