On Paper, 

 
 sorrowed in my hand wide-spread, to swim 
 almond-eyed brown on the canvas nights, 
 Where, forward to the last, it papers--Situations 
 Both air and forests, never new. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Harm Frietchie 
 
 
 Those woods whose stay just without friends, 
 Consum'd and the South valley clustered 
 Torn them, with drilling; please: 
 The spectral aime; of marble sense: 
 Sailing down in brittle meadow; 
 What can concern'd; tunes stars descend, 
 in-to wit conduction,
