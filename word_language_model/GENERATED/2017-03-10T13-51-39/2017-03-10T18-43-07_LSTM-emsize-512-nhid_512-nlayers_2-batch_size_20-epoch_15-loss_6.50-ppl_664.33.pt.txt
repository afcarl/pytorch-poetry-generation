Orange Week.... 

 
 He sat in, inside. And soon into that glass 
 I would still come? As a pair in a guiltless smile 
 Covered a furlong from the violation, brethren, 
 The Doctor rowen looking at his right hopes: 
 clever; dun, Unanimous the very Colour-Sergeant 
 Got their frayed nests in clay, the shotguns 
 Bird-song, oblique and horizontal granny 
 Branchless Moloch! Mother's friend, there's really one in Ivory 
 valley; you think of what you have to state, I love the society
