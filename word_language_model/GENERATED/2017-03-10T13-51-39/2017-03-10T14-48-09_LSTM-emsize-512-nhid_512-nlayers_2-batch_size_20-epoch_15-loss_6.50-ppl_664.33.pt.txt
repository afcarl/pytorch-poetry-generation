Hotter-- 

 And clad in coughing, like tiny corn. 
 
 Tell me when all you think a year once more, 
 When, with a light so warm in me 
 Who peace as you are to cut your kiss will feed 
 I placed you off this dish to her again 
 
 Then was there one by one, child, myself 
 Was playing in her place, song--but never hollow, 
 And as she turned even for her love's part will frame -- 
 For neither small
