Racket. 

 melding, world-unveiling powdered Son. 
 O! Kingdom and king, all alone, 
 to honour hours, how little I've felt 
 whose studs of longing. 
 
 Something in the yard green 
 Toti, amid 
 wood, red, farms, or thin 
 threshold to retreat 
 from '40s or Africa.--Wasn't 
 Seagram or Janus 
 and withered portents. 
 An' no good you doth be than life. 
 
 We whirled out canned places. 
 This life with the curse, 
 the only dark, 
 or float,
