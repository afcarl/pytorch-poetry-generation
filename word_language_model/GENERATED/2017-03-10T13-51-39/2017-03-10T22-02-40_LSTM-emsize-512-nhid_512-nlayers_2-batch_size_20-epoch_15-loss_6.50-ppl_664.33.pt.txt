 
 And that, I read the sadness for a carry? 
 
 Silas has stolen giving a pack of unretrievingly 
 One is for her devotion as in places. 
 
 Her mussed were thin, clear as any flea. 
 "My mother was no child, so roommate 
 She heard the radiant charity 
 Of a lurching blossom of light-- 
 And I made a pact to rise 
 Into the curly lamps, 
 To the one that gazed beside her, 
 Until she woke Imagind
