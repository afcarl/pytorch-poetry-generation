 Though it doesn't matter about his fate in the imagination, 
 If he should listen, and though he is far 
 And that he does not dare it again. 
 The younger way that walks into the woods, 
 And if the ship were ever on the night-- 
 Was it all that knew the world as the days of light; 
 containing him. A long fat letters, a fine high root, 
 A miniature at strut, the marriage begins.
