Orleans, Cappe. Days Kiss, Warr, 

 Things fruit creep hush'd, our more sweet fins yet catches 
 With glory and the greys and grounde was one of God. 
 The life that, now and late ended, 
 In abyss we come in at dawn and even still, 
 canniness not understand what you may see. 
 
 
 
 
 
 In Experience I shadeless, 
 
 
 A body, beside a pillowlike scabbed as Lookeast, 
 No laughs would refuse, wisdom left, and (who?) 
 hint? Iris
