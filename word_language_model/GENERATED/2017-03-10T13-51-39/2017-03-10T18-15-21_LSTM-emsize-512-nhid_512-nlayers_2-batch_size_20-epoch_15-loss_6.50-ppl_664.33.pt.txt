I Would 

 Come old and see dead. 
 
 
 
 What skyward to man like a Louisiana for obscured. 
 Half of itself ... 
 The number and twenty-four of scion 
 Of precision Trout wisp or whiskey, 
 played clean as McLean progenie 
 Were thrown from Is! to home 
 
 
 We saw it from our skins, 
 A starbursts to slip beside 
 The kiosk close and amber 
 With traduction of Forgiveness Lax 
 
 
 
 
 
 Closing Sonnets
