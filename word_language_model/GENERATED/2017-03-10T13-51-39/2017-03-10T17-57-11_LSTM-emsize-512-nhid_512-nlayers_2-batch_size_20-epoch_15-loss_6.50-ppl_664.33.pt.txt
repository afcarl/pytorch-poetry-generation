In A Far Meadow, 

 A humpback boat fades over with core, 
 And the chalked sowing on a reunite? 
 Crying within a rock like secrecy 
 Beneath the sky, a raw-edged window. 
 
 Look! "I am good and dead. 
 I rub the hair goes AN' Come... 
 And full of violets in the copper sink. 
 I will almost have left my fingers torn 
 Above my always-dated orb, so strode off to rain, 
 And trust how among them we perceive the Fetch!
