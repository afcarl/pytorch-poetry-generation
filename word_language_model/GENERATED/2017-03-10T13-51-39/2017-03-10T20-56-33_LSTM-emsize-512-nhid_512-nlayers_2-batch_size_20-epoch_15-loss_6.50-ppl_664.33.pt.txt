Has Risen The 9Th. 

 bumping the edge of it, and he 
 shakes his eelgrass with contemplation Of grief 
 sald: His hand flickers its glowing 
 gleaming eyes, the wall. Empty 
 rascaill falls distractions for company. 
 
 If killing somebody needs in his nature 
 he thinks of escape or prose is it the doubt of money. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Soldier at the Grave of America 
 
 
 Wait the happy; exactitude think of good; 
 No leaves
