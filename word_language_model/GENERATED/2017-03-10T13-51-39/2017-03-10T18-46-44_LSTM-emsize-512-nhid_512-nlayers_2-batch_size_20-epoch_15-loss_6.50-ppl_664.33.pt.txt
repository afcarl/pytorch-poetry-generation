And More Chokecherries 

 Ah, Don scornful summers, who lives among thee: 
 Where Virtue and these powers may tread away to Rafael's 
 To pass off the days and Queens so poor, all wine, 
 Me tellen next day of death. Yea, in mind, of laughter, 
 O Caesar, a thorn too bright to suit thy fears. 
 Let not the Sun for the world's long ways, 
 As though our madness to be difficult, 
 Were fervid equal to uteri 
 And then the proud soul
