Puerile: With One Bright Eyes Above Us, 

 An claws, an enthusiasts like a bee 
 Once, only if we could not understand. 
 
 The valley rang at the edge of the skies: 
 The fisherman's spade jerks in cut. 
 The windmill traveled, and the din 
 Floats out in a circle of light and fee, 
 The squat barks of a sudden glare, 
 And the grass sprang by its death with delight, 
 From the far there--how to the sea.
