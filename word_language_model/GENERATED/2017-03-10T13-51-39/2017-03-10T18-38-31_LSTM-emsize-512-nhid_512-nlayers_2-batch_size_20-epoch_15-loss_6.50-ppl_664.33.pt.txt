(Mortal) 

 That they have paid me all beheld 
 Tore like fire among them all, 
 Do not even fall under these acid, 
 Fortune shall be as ours, 
 Thank fervent thee: 
 Someone dead, me, earlier old, 
 All split, beneath th' moorlands, 
 Loose in her drooping lot, 
 And Spirit of blae--the curiously, 
 And her fond mate and ready lay, 
 Till, a staff that she knows gentle ear; 
 And she's not one of God, or rules." 
 
 So crowds
