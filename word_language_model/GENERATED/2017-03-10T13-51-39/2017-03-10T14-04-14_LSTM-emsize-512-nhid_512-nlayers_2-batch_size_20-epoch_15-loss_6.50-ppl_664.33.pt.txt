Disappearing 

 
 For the clear o'er-storied bare 
 And showing their burning burning 
 All afternoon through the moonlit tree. 
 Knows them to try and to fly Iago. 
 night-black things sticks like pine. 
 
 Yet what survivor. This is the worst 
 Whose wheel is more than all the hurt of life 
 A silence hurries like a strict process 
 If very soon a dozen future comes 
 And outside at mend-- 'tis afraid of it.
