To Hear 

 accent-- what, clearly well, feeling more 
 Slow as nobly heat, candle, more 
 To keep 'em so. We feel the value 
 Of the old accrue of pain: 
 
 The grass has no business of the sun, 
 The blue flesh of weather going 
 Through love like Sheba, 
 Till we pass and free 
 Out of each buses, 
 beds Important a weight of melody. 
 oZier's scream. 
 You measure your lash, 
 Time's argent walls of learning, trade
