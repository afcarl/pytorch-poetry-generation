 
 His wife is hooked and Up 
 Her breath as is a lion, 
 Such sweet metal as lone as green, 
 Sees that bright mind within the city room 
 Which lifts the tea. 
 
 But in the uneasy prime 
 Can translate round her breast 
 That yet to purge and wither, 
 obese, spirits and warres flow, 
 Her tears drop Sluces, and her haughty hand 
 Is dull and close? our fearful gold 
 Keeps nods forever like a meteor,
