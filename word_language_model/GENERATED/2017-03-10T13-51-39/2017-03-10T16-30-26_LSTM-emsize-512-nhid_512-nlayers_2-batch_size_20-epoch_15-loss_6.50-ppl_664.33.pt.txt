 Unpractis'd year it's take the life of money. 
 Ah, a plane supreme, a broken cell. 
 I want to lose, I'd follow the breeze 
 And give them orgasm till doctor--Dr. crawl. 
 Fond lady, I turn away. 
 
 "It would come I get on as much as you, let me be, 
 Will forgive you the liberty, and nothing gives, 
 Be your cupboard.
