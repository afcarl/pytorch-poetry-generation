 Of no other present miles to left, 
 Under the visible wings of his huge class) 
 Diamond and tampered in the recounts 
 sirens cleared 
 With the sun playing with the wise; 
 But it's more secretly 
 About the crumbs and meanders 
 
 The sort of Roused fire in the sea? 
 net's country, diminishing the soil 
 And giddy fancy, eat and down! 
 Sad meres of blank motion? 
 Or hanging in the corner of magma. 
 It's sleeping in silence
