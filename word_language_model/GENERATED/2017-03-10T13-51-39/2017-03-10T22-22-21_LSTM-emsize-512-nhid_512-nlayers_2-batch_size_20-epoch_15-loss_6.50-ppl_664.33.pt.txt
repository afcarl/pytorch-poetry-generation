Screen 

 was a log, to shoulder. 
 "I don't understand, I thirst; eat it-- 
 but I hear a accident, contradict my name. 
 Let me recall Blackhawk -- weep when I meet. 
 
 Later, when the voices hired me to watch the water 
 spreads my tight home. The gold sweat, 
 then sang so much pleasure that I might call in! 
 
 and queer for the ten companion we meet. 
 Her songs are motion of a day darksome 
 in the forge's
