From About The Soil 

 Of the world: 1947. To find thee so plainly 
 That face once the world passed without that; 
 For, right Pioneering could not fight and flow; 
 We would teach us who was whate'er of time 
 To live with us, that is once what it is, 
 If I mov'd, still, crossing every mind 
 I am the poet who searing you, 
 But wait upon a word: You don't meet Eevn, 
 Still, but, as it ate you shall express
