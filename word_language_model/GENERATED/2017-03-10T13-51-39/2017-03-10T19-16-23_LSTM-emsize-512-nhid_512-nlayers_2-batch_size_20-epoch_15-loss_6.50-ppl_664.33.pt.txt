And Chandeliers For Ashes, 

 waiting for a few years, among them, 
 weight, pure as October leaves, lifted 
 In the crystal sand. On the desert evening comes the one 
 Near the other side, amid the morning and over are flush 
 With curses and patting the sabbath verticals up, 
 The piles of serpentine grown forth at song; 
 The moment is the holy woman, the Seltzer in the spooky shape of the raccoon's 
 excitement, dumped on empty sheets broken the Imagination. 
 Oh
