 
 
 
 
 
 Double Colin 
 
 
 Let me consider what it is! 
 The streets whisper 
 Let shape turn down 
 With meaning, where they bloom 
 And know that wall has journeyed 
 To be drowned in front of you, 
 Everything in your hands that name my grief, 
 Though eastern star falls on me 
 Over a ceiling with the harsh green, 
 All silently circling in the evening. 
 You are the flower and though you see.
