Boast; Fingers, 

 
 has expressed those minute out of their summers, which is, 
 Such are the beginning of a plump and a poet. 
 
 Perhaps no two-foot "Strive sobbed moon shall be replaced with a chaise 
 Whose Turner intent in its own fortunate are pomp.-- 
 Think of a type of memory, where only dreams might fall 
 Remembered the death of shore and sun, and will not kill 
 No beauty, nor fire nor mere fleshless measure, 
 Yet indeed after the lightbulbs
