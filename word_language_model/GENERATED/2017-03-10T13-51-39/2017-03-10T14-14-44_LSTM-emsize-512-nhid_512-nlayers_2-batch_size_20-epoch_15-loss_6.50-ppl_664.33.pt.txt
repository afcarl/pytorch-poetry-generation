 hanging out of having emptied of the air. 
 Just your face on yours let us enter 
 like vast useless rag 
 slowly at night, as in the sky 
 around the night news jacket.

 at the end of the house age dreaming 
 we walk out the wall, purple 
 floors of an orthodoxy 
 around the field sweetbriar, 
 yucca. Here teen- overjoyed. 
 Landward in spills, Festival. 
 Fruits blues, scattered
