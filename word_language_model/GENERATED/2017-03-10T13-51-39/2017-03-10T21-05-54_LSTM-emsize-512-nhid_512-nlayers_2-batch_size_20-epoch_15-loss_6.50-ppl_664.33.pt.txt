Our Minds 

 Will control. 
 
 II 
 Until in attacks without a name, pleasant 
 hogode, of nothing but two equal days; 
 And none of us will ever yourself. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Soul rosary. 
 
 
 I wanted to write them? 
 I tried to go 
 As the road fell, and upholstery 
 In bloom seeking the Code 
 To find its black sensitive box 
 And the door falls, the grasses 
 The paths of the whistles
