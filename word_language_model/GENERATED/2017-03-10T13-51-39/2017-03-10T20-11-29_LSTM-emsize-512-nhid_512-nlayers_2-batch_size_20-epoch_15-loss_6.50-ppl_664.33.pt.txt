And Fugues 

 Hunger as Henry as a flower, when death comes turning 
 on forever, its tendrils drag over the flap 
 
 like another congestion of shew, 
 
 
 impertinently 7 
 If an ash Exegetes making lots of rag hissing 
 on their visor and their seal, and when everything else. 
 Outside, a ship overhead. At noon, when the kid joined 
 Bowstrings to sawdust from the obligatory 
 Towards brass fingertip is never a threat of idling 
 and a small whipping
