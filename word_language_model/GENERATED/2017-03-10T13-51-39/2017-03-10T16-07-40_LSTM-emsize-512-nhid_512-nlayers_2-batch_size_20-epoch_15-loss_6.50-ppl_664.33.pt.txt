Which Is The Last, 

 & how many rhymes untainted hurts 
 could strut and pound from those first trees 
 that talked of casting passionate Prince'--Cinquez 
 
 which once the surface of growth had fallen 
 freaky, within this & a phantom source 
 of fire voices of something only knew, 
 or mine, and the other month, and that one day 
 when men survived him, then they kept 
 so many guests are supported from that Race, 
 which would be good for time.
