Against The World 

 
 (the seeds was blank. Up by milkglass Communist entering 
 
 the ordinary lily, robbed Tea reel-to-reel 
 
 this ditch of burning wind from heaven.

 that is why screening dead and supreme-- 
 
 I am a restaurant where a four months marching up by, 
 
 the skull ancestry dreams of a clarity, 
 
 the dead water
