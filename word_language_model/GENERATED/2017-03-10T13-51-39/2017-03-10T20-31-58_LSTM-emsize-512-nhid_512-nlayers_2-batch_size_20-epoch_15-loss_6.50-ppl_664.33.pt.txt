That Sow The Beast 

 And her little cast: cores of valleys: she will be without dull, 
 Honesty, or the like, idiocy of our life! 
 She grows in unknown deep to hear the sounds of love 
 Was wherever someone ever found herself by hope. 
 No rain but hidden Christian Lady! gray, 
 Behold it all, and then her foot was soft 
 And lower she into some storm's hypnotism 
 And made it she must fall, but I hold it. 
 Do you know
