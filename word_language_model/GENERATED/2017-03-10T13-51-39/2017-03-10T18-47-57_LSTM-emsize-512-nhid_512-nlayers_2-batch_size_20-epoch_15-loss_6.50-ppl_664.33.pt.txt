 How she was "interesting. 
 Infinite footsteps of icebergs 
 the shoots, a rainy sea, out 
 so fast, lost in the wilderness. 
 All the sorrow 
 grows so rife 
 That can ever be so told. 
 Still, when all things scrape 
 fidgeted of sorrow and fashion 
 Spring fills with the sun, 
 
 Brings the note over them 
 with clean blood 
 and silence for the book 
 curtain and will turn the root 
 
 of the scab of Broadway
