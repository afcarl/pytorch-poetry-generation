 not even in the middle Year 
 when broken and Despair will build 
 the unearthly gnawing "die, 
 
 in the yard. That is, shine 
 at this certain point, even 
 stead-fast, naked visible 
 
 and clean. Beyond the emptiness 
 it ironical, open to witness 
 your body is cold; and it bottles 
 each other's harmonies 
 like melancholy, 
 where we've just carried 
 all night for We'll be here 
 that has never gotten 
 flame, moon, down, feel
