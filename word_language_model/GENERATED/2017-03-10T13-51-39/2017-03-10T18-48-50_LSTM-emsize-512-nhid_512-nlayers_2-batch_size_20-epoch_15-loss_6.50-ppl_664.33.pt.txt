 "What I remember but suppose 
 That you could not gladly hold you; 
 But there were just the church of god 
 Who hates to love us, if they might reassert 
 While the red Mattin, the memory now they dies, 
 And the thoughts which we never brought, the same; 
 And men who sojourn in our songs. 
 
 They've dreamed you a draught every definite look, 
 And we will do
