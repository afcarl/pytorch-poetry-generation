Preyed Of Flowers, 

 somewhere which is to fear your flesh as I shall be slumped 
 for a submarine and resurrect height within it, 
 to think unsolved in his fortune with a look for ever. 
 
 
 Yet I fear why thought I dare not make no use for it, but nog wound up & down, 
 he rewards my thin clothes to let me sail 
 over my shoulder, fearing he is all the laws of the others, 
 as I say, Gra'ma do
