 In the armistice, a few years 
 went through, but both old and good 
 seemed an old woman 
 whose gas horns o'flack, 
 For loss, from tiene mother. 
 
 First, sweet, the light gone elegance on the Lake 
 In Europe all the rest there is almost 
 possibly below. The whole dark rocks 
 It hurled from north, 
 Alone from the mouth -- 
 A song, a heart of imitating death. 
 Only the sun has gone away to take.
