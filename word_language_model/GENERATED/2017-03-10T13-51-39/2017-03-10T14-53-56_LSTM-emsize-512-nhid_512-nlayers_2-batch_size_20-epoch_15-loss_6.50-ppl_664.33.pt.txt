To The Left Of The Town, 

 a stillness moving and doesn't be remembered 
 we raise with our unknown tools 
 as the movement of a rooster adobe 
 
 over stars. 
 The sky comes on the open West and takes out 
 the road from the beach to the south, 
 towards the nightingales there, through the deceit. 
 and Mulholland hair all on the highway air. 
 Blind, turns anyway. And the men 
 who really really froze we, and say, 
 that, strow
