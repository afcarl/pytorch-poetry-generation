Beaks, 

 the coolness ride wild and strike's 
 As usual, as long as in a winter's square 
 of charred feathers on the steaming sea of summer Island 
 or the field grow with bright or gold, nothing Diminished 
 and down-wind between the people and their vowels, 
 
 
 
 
 
 styles of Long Douglass 
 
 
 We who are here now but now, no one in Spain, bull-hides, 
 Perhaps in some nervous log in cutting the slick future 
 with heath-fern
