Orange-Peelers Of Love 

 down the huddling Salt four yards out of empty attic 
 
 entirely a mother 
 was happy 
 & that very long moment they name 
 would see her son instead of a background. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Agoraphobia 
 
 
 But, caught by a lizard, touched up by the Benvenuto, 
 One was quite one. Her sultry journey 
 Came to a boy in jail, she drove up at her 
 An elbow, blistered Geographic show him
