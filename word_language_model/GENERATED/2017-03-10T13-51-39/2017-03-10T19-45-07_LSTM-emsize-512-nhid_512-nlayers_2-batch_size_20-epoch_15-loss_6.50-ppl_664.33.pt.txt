Her; Till I Am 

 dissolved and I have started. 
 VI 
 I palm-crowned the woman lo, I thought 
 That all her beauty to coast her sash 
 Took her to drop it, confusing with a sigh 
 And the shadow of her child came back 
 To the minute where she gathers the water 
 To add right off by a deck of symmetry 
 And couldn't tell the female who came quietly 
 Only this would never have been, 
 Or could I know
