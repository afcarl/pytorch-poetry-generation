Unshaken By Poverty 

 And ears and search us as we go,i 
 Thou, and shall we divide the Prayers. 
 
 First, for those who have read so well. 
 
 Out of the dusk, I wake to view the Sons of thought the race of light 
 And of the sins and passage more than him, 
 It is most eagle in the shoal, 
 Full of many sweet woe, sweep--chiefly 
 Does an unwounded pebble weye; 
 Swift as a king, a virgin voice,
