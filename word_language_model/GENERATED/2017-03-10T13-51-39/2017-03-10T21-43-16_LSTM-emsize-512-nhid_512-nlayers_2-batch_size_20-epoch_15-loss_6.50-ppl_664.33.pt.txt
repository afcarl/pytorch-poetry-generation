Days. 

 
 
 
 
 
 Lines to the Time-Piece 
 
 
 Heavy sleep of scorching weeds, 
 I watch the boughs of the tackle growing, the furrow in their pockets 
 Their echoes explosions, their dresses and blossoms and music 
 Just pitiless and but more is winter white, 
 They enter, go; the sun working all these sides, 
 And the branches rising and roared on their heads, 
 And the dream of the bird that traced their flesh on a chasm and flings
