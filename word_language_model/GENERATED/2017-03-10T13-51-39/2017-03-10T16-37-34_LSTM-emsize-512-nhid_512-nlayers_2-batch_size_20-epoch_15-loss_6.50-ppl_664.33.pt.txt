I Know 

 Myself who is what soup is he? 
 Dear muse in man's valley unlearn; 
 I am a maker of woe: purs 
 You better have your notebook to lose 
 Your every mad wine of mothers, 
 But the clerk, with sad eyes I nursed you, to you I do not forgive. 
 Or perhaps would take a myth, or you or destroy thee, 
 Then would you find it so, if the truth you're done, 
 In the head of your Battel Father,
