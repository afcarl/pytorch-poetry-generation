But Nodding Hands 

 Flung pen in water, Bullets 
 mosaic their tremendous wrong'd, and leaves 
 Wondering how to cheer some shadows more, 
 Of (#6) of fears! 
 O my lover hath houndog 
 Our loveliness is ours 
 Nor to paint the story. 
 
 But live in this house, we think, of love, 
 Shall bring ourselves into his eye 
 The pattern of glory on high earth, 
 And, as the forest swept below 
 Its washing moist down from the stars
