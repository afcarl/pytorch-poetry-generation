Henceforward 

 say it's true, it's Black "Daniel," 
 Vagina smiled like a child at half-wall 
 Share up to star till knot together,' 
 Happy as fear: 
 Meanwhile, for all these 
 untilled think. Here is--as each one 
 no point to act, but like the 
 other. Without 
 preference or storm in any rate, or shame, 
 Coyote, sighs; or soft Sheeted 
 And, 1923?--now mixed on a chair 
 to peck like a rotting thorn. 
 
 What had fated sense of recognition
