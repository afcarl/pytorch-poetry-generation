I Am. 

 
 If rich, and aloof, such a winter sun 
 swerode, its ladder was its wings. 
 
 A mist. 
 The stroke was bitten into grain 
 As it was in a phantom, end, 
 Like that one summer's hidden motion 
 
 From wing to heat where storms and lovers fell, 
 And Golden bodies, purple desert 
 A carol rapture trembling, but I climb, 
 The bottom of my Mother's ear 
 
 Instead of Latest Buckhannon 
 Not knowing how black
