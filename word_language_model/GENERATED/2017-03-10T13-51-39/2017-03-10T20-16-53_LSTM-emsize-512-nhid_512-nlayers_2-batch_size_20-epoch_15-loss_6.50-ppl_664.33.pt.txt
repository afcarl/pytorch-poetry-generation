 Yet now I spared her fears, 
 
 So in her white ringlets own, 
 
 And form her bundle in grace; 
 
 
 My perfume would not renew my workings 
 
 But she, my weary name doth find, 
 
 And made my lady only speak, 
 
 That some still guiltless matches her chain, 
 
 The weak one still did heaven again; 
 
 I check her best, or her from
