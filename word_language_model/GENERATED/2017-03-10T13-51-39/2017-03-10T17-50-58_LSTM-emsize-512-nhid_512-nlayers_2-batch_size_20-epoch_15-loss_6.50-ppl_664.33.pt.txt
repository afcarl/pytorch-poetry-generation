The Sky After Night, 

 Everything like another meeting in any little room and sleeps girl-child 
 Straight at calculation with the pencil popped by the perspicacious clock insert his lisp, 
 Heaving up a shelf, the brown smoking. 
 
 In this I most took buy, 
 I saw my mother's frame. 
 
 
 5. 
 
 I go far already through the quiet grass. 
 After I lived alone in the grave of my life 
 That I would never have responded 
 The tribe
