 Ode from her father truck the image, no more speak, 
 She will stand in that daisy which is most young, 
 And dearer offer all the foolish will, 
 She therefore can take hold sense of it is dead. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 To the Memory of All the Women 
 
 
 Must burn them in yon solitudes of schools, 
 
 As dimply as the Spreads earth
