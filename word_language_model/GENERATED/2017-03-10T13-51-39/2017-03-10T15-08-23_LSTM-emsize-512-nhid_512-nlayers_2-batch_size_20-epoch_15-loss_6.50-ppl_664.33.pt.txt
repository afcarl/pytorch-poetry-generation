This 

 and Vengeance should sing a tear out of desire 
 than any part and of a tedious bond 
 or live odd nanosecond or ever 
 the sun's seed grow bad as a happen. 
 
 
 My pauper bundled and sings 
 gives way a few years, some ax 
 sits through the lilacs in the bank. 
 Only saved by erpicking 
 Carrying his gut 
 out of some deaths. 
 The shreds of nature takes Sceptre. 
 in the cracks of my tie
