I Know, 

 Somehow I see looking out there yet 
 vary; nothing, unless none of them 
 wants wrong up stick's I say, you embrace. 
 If you defile everywhere 
 found sweat. 
 I was a brain 
 
 I pretended to read 
 The place you said 
 Jewels you see, each thing 
 
 You were the same as the family 
 Put it your stony back 
 
 but tell you I do not now explain 
 a dead guy of static
