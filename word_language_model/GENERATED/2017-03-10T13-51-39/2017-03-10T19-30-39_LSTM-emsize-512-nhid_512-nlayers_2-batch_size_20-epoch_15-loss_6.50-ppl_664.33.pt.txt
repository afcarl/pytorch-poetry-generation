Had Noblesse: 

 Save that the drift of Lost hum 
 Should have been written off some stove. 
 Might be observed -- 
 Because they are cruel and they courted no report 
 They are the murmur of Burning shirts on the progenies of sand boot and sky, 
 Let its potion rejoice their arms round the ground, 
 And studious as they become God's silently! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 dry-weatha detached, 
 
 
 Even as the day's Tom is with fruit-merchant movements
