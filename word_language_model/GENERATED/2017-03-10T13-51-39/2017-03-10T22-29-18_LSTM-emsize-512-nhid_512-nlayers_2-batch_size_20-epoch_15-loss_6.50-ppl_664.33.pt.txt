 
 "You pass through me in your field of Crowded-toothed 
 Happy revolution on your arm, 
 Green log on my winds. 
 reminds Of our spooling, 
 "nothing. 
 God's body's friend. 
 
 
 
 
 
 A Chorus of left: 
 
 
 A equals bole 
 In the factory of sunlit rivers, 
 Far from the window 
 Turn along the twilight. 
 unmended the reel is blown. 
 The sun is a clock clock whose skull 
 Shall hang in the sunlight
