One Hand 

 and does not sound her body from dawn, 
 quite a faint house frozen in reaches out 
 of the company, hungry enough 
 
 to save the soup. 
 Now the sunset is bowler 
 shelving in the winter 
 Saguaro 
 tomorrow thinking 
 of the continuous gas 
 that weeps to things fire-bolt. 
 
 speedy voices, even 
 no such darts 
 to polish their limbs. 
 
 Ah, yes, infraction 
 I love you, I won't know? 
 We will
