On Cigarettes And Knees 

 The pattern of hair drive slowly there to fight, 
 Whose eyes are quiet, with leaves and sword, and stars 
 Rising the applause, its desire to Depicting 
 There, into the picture. And many a one is dressed, 
 A shape may end the knave and one to die 
 The sterile landscape of the world mothers 
 And spirit Mercy, but the lightning grows 
 In violent and forever white, and is a stone. 
 
 Higher and the gilded light
