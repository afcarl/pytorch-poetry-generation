Poor--One Metatextual 

 absorbing my father's neglect and sing, 
 I learn no more to see my eyes are eft 
 free---- myself spreading like a breeze, 
 Like a sublime and safe. 
 This is the place, 
 A killer born since in a Grecian spot, 
 With something more than worldly aim 
 for that one way? But now, the coming 
 disappears. 
 
 6 
 The youth of poet seeks a poem, of bliss, 
 Is winged for my pulse. 
 
 He mourn.
