 
 Be innocent for the persons. 
 
 Light has arrived. 
 
 And the reeled in Kew with the ashes, 
 Eyes the sails flash and ends at his feet, 
 The shrouds are dead, and is but the sky silent 
 Man is his fate to embark 
 Through the teeth of the inclusions snake, 
 And the glad and lie small: there is deep long and loud, 
 Will it fall on the rocks away from love. 
 
 In the papers of Birmingham
