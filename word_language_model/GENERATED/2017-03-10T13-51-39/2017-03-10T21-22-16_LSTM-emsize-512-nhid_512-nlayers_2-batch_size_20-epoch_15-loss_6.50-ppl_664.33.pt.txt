The Air Fell Down On Her Shoulder, 

 She lies down to a stripe 
 Of shaking her hair. 
 She reaches along her mouth! she shakes 
 Her hair in the dust like boot blown 
 Beyond her company. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Between Three Crows 
 
 
 The catamenia Famous dances. 
 Out from the east, he mauls and sees 
 His waters whistling floating to all-beholding 
 
 Down at dusk, Schell from civil sky, 
 Where fragments are no cherished crowded
