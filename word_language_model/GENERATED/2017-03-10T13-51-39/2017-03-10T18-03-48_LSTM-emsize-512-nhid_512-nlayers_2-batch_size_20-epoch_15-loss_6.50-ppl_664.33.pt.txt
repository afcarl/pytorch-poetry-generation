 Amid floats of balcony 
 Through marked streets, article. 
 
 Coffee and thin 
 Dependent in the air 
 CONTRA busy old men 
 enthralled on ketchup wooden Mountains 
 
 Vomited through gray desperation beam-ends 
 Ah unlike the corridors 
 Of mountain, all the stars, 
 
 Lonely as water line:-- 
 
 Somewhere, the monkey throbs Ewe, 
 The wind clouds caps and the bees go through, 
 The Scorpion crowns the skinny sand, 
 The white rose is upwards still.
