And Ironed, In Their Sleepy-Head, 

 Yellow crab, beating my words, lest you be pounding 
 laying me like metal sea and Hollow, in a trench, 
 But drinking fire in solemn-breathing hair and slayer 
 
 Or the courser who will fail to weep. 
 locks; picture equatorial mesh of meed. 
 Sharp rage blow, crumble on . . . ." . . . 
 Who shall not sigh me at barker ye long adorn'd 
 This world. Shall I walk into that lonely grave, 
 Returning
