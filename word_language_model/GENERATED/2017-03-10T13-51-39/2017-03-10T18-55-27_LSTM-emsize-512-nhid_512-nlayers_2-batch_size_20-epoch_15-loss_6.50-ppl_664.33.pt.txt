 In everything all he brings, 
 And looks on sea and Toulouse. 
 Fat moons that gleam against the sun, 
 irresponsible fruitage of the shade, 
 And then in cottage somewhere. 
 
 (The mark of his life's head, his tail 
 Of ages, quite to please, then, struggle 
 Back at the stars we move; 
 We disregarding torn well-known expatriate, 
 Sharp and spectral through the night, 
 Bronzed sleeping, mountains and rain & snow. 
 
 The writer may be dead!"
