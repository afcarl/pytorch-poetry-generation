To Be Lost 

 There is no sound there now. 
 Asleep frisk in the silence 
 To the same come here at once; 
 To look on the grass for Coke, 
 The "Deaf...can and Barefoot cry 
 
 The gaunt and spades are taut and roadhouses 
 in the woke-- and moment--the spaces 
 under the sternum for Frigg bread 
 to make the subway orange line and stopped 
 poking on the ribbed cupboard.
