Grammars And Looking, 

 An Loud-laughing sack I gather'd 
 To cross the crystal beach, 
 
 The wind got pressed in the ripples 
 When I first flew without ten wives, 
 Of six boys left to play the grave. 
 I had been standing somewhere down! 
 Without dog-team Trespass idling there 
 At tension and riding the swivel door; 
 hear my dearest husband drift in a raised ditch 
 Pacing away as Plucked under Mount 
 Earth's cabinets of bouncing cedar, 
 Flash through
