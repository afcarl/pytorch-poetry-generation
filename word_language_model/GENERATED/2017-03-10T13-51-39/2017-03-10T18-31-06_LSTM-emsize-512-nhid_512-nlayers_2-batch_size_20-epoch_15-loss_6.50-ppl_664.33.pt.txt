The Rooftops 

 The sunlight is like a balloon 
 Already blood runs out, words like music entering eyelids 
 swaying over clouds, pickle-tub-boards, a yellow mound of red brilliance 
 So caught about it hot as at several times. 
 The flock ghosts? 
 they cool. They don't 
 say all the right changes 
 of our kind fact. It's that it's good now. 
 Once there are people two people speak of boys 
 like those who refuse red 
 or just and are setting
