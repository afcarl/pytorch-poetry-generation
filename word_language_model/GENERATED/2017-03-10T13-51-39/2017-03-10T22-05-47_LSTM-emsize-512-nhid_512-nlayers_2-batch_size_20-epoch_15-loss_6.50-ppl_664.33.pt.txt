That Place 

 pretending to follow the weight of the wind? 
 Let it sit in his trifling? Not in winter, 
 Hitchhiking Williams' wind or wings toughen. 
 Towards bestial close at sardonic. 
 Where the huge bank takes out to it; 
 
 So in grandsires, all the while 
 When the baby is wood and the aromatic evening winter 
 Fearless and all the stars 
 
 And move away so many hand 
 There is not so joy but cannot fail. 
 
 Scented
