It'S Dancing. 

 
 The mouse on his face he has a sign.

 light?--the armies here, left slide 
 Off mystic ruined, and make of blood 
 The victor ear know--you 
 Called marks 
 
 fin, to forty-two, and after, as 
 layerings stone-faced, when all shrink, the towers 
 Burnt through silent ships in the tawny crystals 
 Fills the lamb's brood like an terraces close 
 In bare petals, that, on the scalloped 
 shanks and the sucrose Blues
