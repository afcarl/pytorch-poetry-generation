Countess At The End. 

 There are people always turkey-shooting moyste, and forward; 
 Where the Circle knot the brave glasses, all the blaze 
 
 Outside the brown spaces that kindled into the eye 
 By the acrid, dew, fresh of waters. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Nocturne 
 
 two prety du two columns of air 
 and no sky, filling the leaves, snatching at once 
 English, not yellowed with coat bone 
 toward his coma 
 In that high triangle and steeds
