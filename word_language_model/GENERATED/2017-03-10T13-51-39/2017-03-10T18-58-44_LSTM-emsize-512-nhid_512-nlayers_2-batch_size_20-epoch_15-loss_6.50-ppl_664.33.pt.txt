 There are animals outside of light and windows, 
 The splashing worker with the steady sky, 
 The stump of Ocean rolls their wings o'er the moor, 
 
 By day 
 roses: in the changing light.

 The men built dead good. In the mottled heat 
 The tie and usher of gardens to embroiling stones. 
 Where is the bag of bells moving to make the world
