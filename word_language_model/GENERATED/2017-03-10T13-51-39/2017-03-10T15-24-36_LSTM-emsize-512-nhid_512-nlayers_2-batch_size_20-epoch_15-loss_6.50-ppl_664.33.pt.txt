 Remember, Venus re elm-tree laughter 
 
 In bronze 
 where April meets walk-throughs 
 gone back again 
 in the spring dusk 
 whispers in a comma- 
 
 Well 
 
 a Marriage Silas says 
 a thought of Benvenuto 
 
 & natural guy 
 from every commitment 
 Enjoying, spent the undergrowth. 
 
 Before his daddy he 
 had had a letter 
 pounce on his head, 
 pulled him through the groves, 
 speak.' fingerprints 
 from the mockery.
