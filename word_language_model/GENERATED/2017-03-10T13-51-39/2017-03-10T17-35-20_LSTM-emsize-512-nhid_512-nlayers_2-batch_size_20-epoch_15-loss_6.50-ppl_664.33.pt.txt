Melancholy, 

 in no fields that end the world is always used to touch. 
 I might not speak, knowing when I from how deep it is raining 
 learning to make that light I grow here. 
 Who can tell what cried down not in the building of the sea: 
 a war-drum of hell, 
 
 where the wind wants that a blur may be born. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Fascination of Name 
 
 
 Shifting a gun in the moonlight
