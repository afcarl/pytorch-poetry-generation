Knowest 

 Before the heart was over or beyond 
 The gipsy plate immense with dull herring, 
 The humming moon and the long year's throats 
 Became in full gunnysacks and when Fall, writes the stone 
 Of a bed that never cries on being patience in time. 
 
 Something is war from somewhere 
 I am afraid of how to talk, I am satisfied. 
 Everyone has lasts but the water's rage 
 Would not Human chord. Euripides, a little 
 Running in his boss
