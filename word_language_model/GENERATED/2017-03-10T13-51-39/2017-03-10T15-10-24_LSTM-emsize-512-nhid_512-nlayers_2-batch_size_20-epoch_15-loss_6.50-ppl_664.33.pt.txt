To Tragedy, The Ships. 

 For the Church of the End of the skies-- 
 As I gills: as sun and myself, 
 Shall I touch it ... that your soul may be 
 All my years guilty and more to keep counselling 
 Because I may suppose ever you were eaten 
 Your eye knowledge-apples your last passion 
 Your feelings and in-gusting daily 
 Helpe with your Biddy fault from the heart, 
 Tender and gifts. But 
 
 
 
 
 
 These slade
