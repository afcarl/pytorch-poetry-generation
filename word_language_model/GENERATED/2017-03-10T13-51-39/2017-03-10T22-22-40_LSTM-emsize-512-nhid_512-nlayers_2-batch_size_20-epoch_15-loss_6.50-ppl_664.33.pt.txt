And He Stole At His Flighty Fleeing 

 Summer's labor he might be blest, 
 failure with wild unclouded words! 
 For he must beat his head at table while 
 They strike us loose from him to man and peas 
 No more. He draws the foot to eye-balls and dive. 
 
 He taunts himself he sees, and he turns back 
 To have dancing it Reconceiving out and dark, 
 And others kiss till the house turns, swift 
 
 Thence to consider and find
