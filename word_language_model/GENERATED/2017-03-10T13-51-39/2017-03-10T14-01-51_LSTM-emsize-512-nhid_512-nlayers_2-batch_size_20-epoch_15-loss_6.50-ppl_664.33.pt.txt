Forth, More 

 Nature takes more. 
 
 
 Son: 
 I'm glad I'm lost. I should 
 Can gingerly the living without shame, 
 Nor any panting. Nothing said: 
 This tilting of life, it is most an Multitudinous, 
 With a saw. How hatches, 
 All I reach from this doctrine which shall march 
 Tell me, babes may not weep slot-- 
 Nor expand to love what else is lost to lie. 
 
 I am the doom, the mirth whose pen, is shed,
