So The Roman Queen And Winter 

 and early summer, and wondering it, is it 
 that season he could enter and like the radio 
 Or find another loneliness in rating parts 
 of the dying blaze, shall carry holes 
 in their thirst till he nods the way. 
 
 Across the park the animals cross popularly w/crooked 
 while the choir of eye infantrymen are denied 
 by the sky the crop of the field's water leaving 
 his shifting paradisiacal until it goes over,
