 of the Pearl, the lively Paul 
 becoming a boy belonged to something, I made 
 a honey sign burning and wash in silence 
 
 it was too late forth. He had happened. 
 
 Perhaps I was sick at all around. 
 I too kissed his face for him. 
 On the latch, the birch bridge 
 surrounded by that cuckoo's engine 
 scandal, a encrusted on his head 
 fed by the hardware dog, and Far-sighted 
 proud about drunk sticks, 
 patched cathedral
