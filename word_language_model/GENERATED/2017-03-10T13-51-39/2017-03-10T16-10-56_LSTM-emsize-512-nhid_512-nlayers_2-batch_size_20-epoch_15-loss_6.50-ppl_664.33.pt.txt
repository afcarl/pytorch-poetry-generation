 
 Which through the tremble? 
 
 
 And now the people, little cold, 
 air-is-a-thing, Heav'n, 
 Look'd past by the straits 
 Of Crowd and hail. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Across the American Book of Chamouni 
 
 
 What thou hast I, what case shall survive. 
 Philip bird in gleaming autumnal pond, 
 I watched the picture shade, and I am sent; 
 I'll bring as far as mocks at my hand; 
 I am hammered for a musician
