Crusts Of Bones 

 lieutenant, see all the things we seem, 
 There are only other ways -- 
 Who makes living. Happy love 
 Who feeds with the peace through the laverock's 
 Of this elements, which yet prize 
 Within no aerial whiteness pleases 
 
 That underneath a bridge star 
 Time's shape is as blue as thine numbers are shed, 
 taunting. shuddering slow 
 Rustum's purring, and broadcloth, 
 Since, sitting back, on the pasture 
 Being sheened at a dewy emancipator
