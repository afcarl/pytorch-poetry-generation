I Think Of It How It 

 might gently, little if you pay his experience 
 
 If you lie with the dirt to the river 
 
 singing under water. Never like to read. Everyone 
 
 has left one poem to me. I feel them, 
 
 anyway, without a deal where I find it. 
 
 Cold dogs are composed of other men. 
 
 I'm not going from page not to be 
 
 girlonds of my escapes. 
 
 It is anticipated; pacts
