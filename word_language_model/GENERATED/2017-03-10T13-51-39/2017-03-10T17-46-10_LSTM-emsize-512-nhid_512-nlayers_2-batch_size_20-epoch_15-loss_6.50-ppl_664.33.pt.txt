 Memories of that flickering hour, 
 the closet bucket point 
 to which I cannot bother I'll get out, 
 blindly feeling 
 its soft laddering heart, you think it's everything. 
 
 
 -- I'll have the thee--for the lamplight brown and blue. 
 pool. caons, to the oldest quick literature 
 
 where she was driving back before his wife. 
 Days later, the girl witnessed fast. 
 At times I understood that face that dried 
 the whole day cup of ice watching
