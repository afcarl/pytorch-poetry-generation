On An Night, The Hated, 

 quarrelled and the pounding and the spires that fly 
 With deserts and stops, and kiss, and laughs for one 
 and a few rusted parts, sings with the voice of all nations, 
 especially it took a double melodious of nerves 
 Kierkegaard who loves it not, merchants to worry its joy 
 in order to accept 
 what it is to have to be able to diffuse it, 
 and the body is almost too steep to make a stir,
