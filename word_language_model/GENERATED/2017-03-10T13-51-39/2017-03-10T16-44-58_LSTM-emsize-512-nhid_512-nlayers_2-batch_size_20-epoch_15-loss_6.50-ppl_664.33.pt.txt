The Whole Ends Of Beasts 

 felons for their fluids, where the bays set out, 
 cars and moon and cities, 
 They drain it out from their own race. 
 The slow pulse of the ash up east 
 Rich the houses thereof repeat 
 Morpheus among homes. But thus 
 I admir'd and spit the swan 
 Full of bright million skill, 
 Like a necklace in an eagle labyrinth 
 Its Asthma's, France intensifiers, flukes of musk. 
 Are the sounding so broad a stump
