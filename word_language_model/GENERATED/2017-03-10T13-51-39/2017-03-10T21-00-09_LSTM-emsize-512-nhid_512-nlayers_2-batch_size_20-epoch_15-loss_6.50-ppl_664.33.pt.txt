Dust-- 

 And the fresh creatures, Lambs and translucent living, 
 The Arab loves for them again, 
 As a million unpinned north, a glimpse of its neck, 
 And a definite smile laid in the breaking bruised 
 The showers. 
 
 What difference as they must not stay. 
 They let alone lead brighter by their Immanent 
 They've returned the fortunes, 
 With the token of a mountain, they say, 
 What the heart has created manners station 
 And how a fine may assume
