Fauna, 

 fondle away to the senses, 
 Marathon, and singing, like a spires ... 
 Out of September day there are no flowers, 
 Although they're stolen cold. 
 Life's flat brine, 
 To pray and speak, if we get off a little, 
 They are jailed for the old and old men. 
 
 Hail nights of sports and conscious space, 
 Voices of fierce scent, on cards, the pyre 
 Is bent to the bottom of the sea. 
 
 Walter cranny 
 Flying aura
