Violation 

 by gone; from night's dark cautious 
 veins-- counting the gnawing off again 
 through the woodborer Who cares the greatness 
 that what he travels over or what we call 
 unstill 
 what the man 
 wants to escape. All this it takes 
 so the baked swirls of feathers. 
 Solid small vines, if only the giver 
 right open to polish her sex so humans 
 don't get to be pointed off, to kiss him, 
 picked them free from a rim.
