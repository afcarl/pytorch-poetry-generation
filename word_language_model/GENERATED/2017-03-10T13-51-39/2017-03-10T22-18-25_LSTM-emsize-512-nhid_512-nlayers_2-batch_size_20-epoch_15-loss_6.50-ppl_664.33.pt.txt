 When buried apples strung through snow, 
 rebirthing spray stripped of the iron favor: 
 House of fur and creamy fountains, 
 I heard the hideous sheep full out, 
 To the big stony phantom. 
 I knew how the traveller would 
 With morning, one bared in the arms 
 Who loved me, looked at the dark world, aggregates 
 with an agate moon fire-heats in my head. 
 On fifteen Street, it was a calm 
 
 I cared for such a goat with laughter.
