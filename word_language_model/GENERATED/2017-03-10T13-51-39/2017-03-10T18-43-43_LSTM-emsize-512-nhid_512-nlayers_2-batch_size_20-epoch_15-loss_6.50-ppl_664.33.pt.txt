Of Automobile 

 salt, in sun on the under-flame: 
 
 Come down like North Sonorous 
 
 A dappled bugs stays 
 The fruit falls down. 
 In the boats your fall; 
 And the upturned law 
 Grave shank palate-valves, feeling. 
 Thus the late afternoon creed. 
 When the dreamer told me 
 And wanted to call off my hand-- 
 But try not to look for 
 Behind it rise and be gone. 
 
 Some other one would blame us? 
 God cannot
