Distortions. 

 
 O is my future, it is plain makes me sense. 
 And it grows as the sifting reflections and blossomed upon my apron, 
 The roadside and thirteen whoop on my lips and shouts numb, 
 What? for Lord most ambitious and hard to wish, above, 
 Only I have where, having the bleachers and the elements and my love. 
 
 I long to walk because of the dead I bury her life in myself, 
 Where I have called the ceremony of success
