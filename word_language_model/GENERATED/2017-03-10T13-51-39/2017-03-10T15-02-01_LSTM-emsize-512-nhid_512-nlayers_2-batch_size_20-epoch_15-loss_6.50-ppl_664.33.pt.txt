It Too Tourniquet-- 

 
 
 
 
 
 The Bell in Rhymes 
 
 
 About the River raise? 
 en crazy shades trembles 
 In the black. O, we'll yield. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Astrophil and Stella Her Princess, Hope 
 
 
 You henceforth turn sheepie. 
 Over the grass and moon 
 All night, Faustine. 
 
 When children played like ale 
 To pour some foam of roads for uncles 
 Toward the great slope that was marital, 
 And oh!
