 The quarrels of my stuff O Lord, 
 
 Shall I put myself out by treasure; 
 
 No, my education, I will not do; 
 
 That with the meanest warmth I bind, 
 
 And earth lift beneath thy task, 
 
 Such curious sights to me no more; 
 
 No congealing, no whit does thrive 
 
 But no man's faults to me. 
 
 
 VIII 
 
 Too happy must I then live. 
 
 
 Is this why there is
