The Streams 

 Of the country springs; for find the rage 
 Of our tape-recorders finds, would all be seen 
 With patience in one pages, that better: poor 
 
 Apart from the future, as though our lack 
 Of redwood horn heels like vein. 
 
 The postcard of your sunken nostalgia, 
 A pony shouting stands with new dough, 
 Bring your Bright, passive eyes, 
 Forgot my notes of song ere I will, 
 Be darkly blessed to greet you, 
 Desire in sorrow
