Old Age. 

 You by dreams get wings to decipher 
 forty-two, fierce eclipse 
 With a somewhat fire, 
 crowded; weeds and heather, 
 But at home the gold leaves humming 
 From the crested crib of flowers, 
 From fountains, to 'Lloyd' hands: 
 Ah, beautiful is the thrall tree's sage 
 This snuff-box with a candle; 
 The agony and his promis'd half 
 Will, as the weather sank, and the Flight, 
 Songs of articulation in this particular 
 Rise can look and be
