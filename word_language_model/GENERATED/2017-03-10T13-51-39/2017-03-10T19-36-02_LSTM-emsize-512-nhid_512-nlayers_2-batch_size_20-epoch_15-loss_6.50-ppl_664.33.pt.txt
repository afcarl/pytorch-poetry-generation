 Love or lily-bell remain 
 man-root, the fragrance of all friends 
 Were beautiful to be denied. 
 Whenever I was old; I was happy 
 On a wide lamb-- 
 In a rough dream, 
 
 Everything -- smarting and as hard 
 As I could know the truth stylus 
 God knew? 
 The singer replied 
 The service said that I was fifteen 
 He was not only a dream. 
 Time and brain grew stone and many, 
 covent do not read,
