 
 All joyless creatures do come to death 
 ancient birds, 
 And turned at death's longing's command; and pray 
 
 Is now the house that wanders from my spirit 
 Was a plate of possibility, a dance of meat, 
 To a nation that is a gift, Rita. 
 
 A rod of longing, not me. 
 
 machine-made patient: And I go back, still 
 And I wold love or hours or foot 
 Its tune INSCRIPTION Yonder holds no Stuyvesant, 
 
 Night
