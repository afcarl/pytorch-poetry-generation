 what you get to of a career. And yes, now, 
 I want You like a feather to life upon my hip, 
 your hand Elegant and Rameses' 
 tobacco-pipe Your songs, my father, that's real

 of their beauty, why am I strange men! 
 Shiver what am I and curious-- wear the exposed. 
 Oh often, here for someone else is kind. 
 When I am brand and I'll grow you!
