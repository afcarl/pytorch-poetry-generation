Fell Back To The Sun. 

 The mother decided not to notice who is, 
 but it was the same month when I 
 looked up, 
 
 she'd never come home we love once, and I 
 standing holding the whole village, 
 And I had no name. 
 
 Would toilets be erased. 
 Then we will be wise 
 How we die alone. 
 And watch the Kommandant 
 think of our young lovers, 
 their daughters in their black-boats 
 
 like these ridiculous
