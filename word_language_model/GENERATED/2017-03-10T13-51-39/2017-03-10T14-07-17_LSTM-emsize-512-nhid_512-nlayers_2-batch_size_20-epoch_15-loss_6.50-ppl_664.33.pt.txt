Lettow Of My Birth Though I Die. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 In the Snow 
 
 
 I am stretching in the Water 
 In an unknown tree. 
 pilot, dark light, 
 Accompany the sun, 
 Kauai, and silent, 
 brook in the gleaming 
 roof shining and hissing 
 Looking onto the drift 
 Where it stands praying down 
 Under the parched 
 Past sunny towers. And yet 
 To pass out of a melody 
 I watched your long entrails Oos
