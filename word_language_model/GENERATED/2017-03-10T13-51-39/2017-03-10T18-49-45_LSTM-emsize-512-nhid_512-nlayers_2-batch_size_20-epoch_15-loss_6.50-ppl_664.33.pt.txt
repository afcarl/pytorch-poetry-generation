 And the years rattled 
 It was round her, and the stars 
 Were the same to the other end. 
 They bring me to spirit 
 
 To make the magic boy 
 Under Sunlight wings to come. 
 I never fled with a ofspring

 rain-washed, myself in to move 
 A dust turning across the name of ahte, 
 
 I hear the brush sea raise through my pockets,
