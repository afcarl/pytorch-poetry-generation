And A Thing 

 stoops hlt h's cry 
 like a heap of ice winds hovering, nothing of below. 
 
 One day, so long as I reached inside my life 
 and at home. I never heard, my last conversation 
 with ropes of gold, dragging me out to my sidewalk 
 in the bitterness, for I was crying, obscurer 
 at the p.m. in New York July Como 
 and early 4 mornings of summer, at dawn, by bolt of bandages, 
 shapes, cracking hot seas.
