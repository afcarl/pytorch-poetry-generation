Slick And In 

 rule's perfect embraces 
 of happiness 
 where fragments come from the floor like one, 
 can't let bloody rooms, it seems, 
 Against the tree, victim's fires 
 sometimes, now being No, they say, 
 talk phantomness in the antlered 
 old silk walls 
 of log and narcissus on a blue-green edge 
 in the vastest white, a Gems drains. 
 tte son shop to your voice 
 and then it's hard to stand all 
 and see you lip later.
