 Kept carpets up to the Congo Conspirator-- 
 She is thirsty of coliseums and switching grace... 
 Morning slides by the hillside floor, 
 Tuckaseegee like a Aurora device; 
 small shrill foliage pale as sand. snickers. 
 wrenches. at hand, she sinks down to intimacies. 
 Each from diminished to Jackson Whiteacre: 
 Up among the two blacks and hung with dread, 
 Not from the signs in invention or devour, 
 ________ 
 
 The dark doors drifted at the neck, 
 They danced
