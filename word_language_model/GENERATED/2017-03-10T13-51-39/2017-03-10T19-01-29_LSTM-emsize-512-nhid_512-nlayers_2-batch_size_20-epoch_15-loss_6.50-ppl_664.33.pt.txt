Round At Me 

 
 Like a slip on the freeway until he announces 
 
 not knowing it, pulling everything but she can know 
 
 and that he is ashamed. 
 
 
 Man is a hound blooming. 
 
 
 And then he took a sudden 
 
 dried earth off to the bone 
 
 for his weede, 
 
 delivered by his caged palm brothers 
 
 to fish-rib snow, extending his own 
 
 whiskers which were like 
 white dots
