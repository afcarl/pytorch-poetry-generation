 
 That one was better, and one thought 
 Left the land on the wailing floor, 
 Finds everything for heaven's name, 
 post-pillage agony. 
 
 It fails, which, in to all 
 Of rovers, mean foul-mouthed law, 
 Those shot" polyethylene smart, 
 And dust or prose maximum 
 From the fire and to seraglio 
 Than our lord knives in bidan. 
 
 
 
 
 
 doubt? 
 
 
 Nothing comes like a shadow, 
 No time that now 
 Laughing going
