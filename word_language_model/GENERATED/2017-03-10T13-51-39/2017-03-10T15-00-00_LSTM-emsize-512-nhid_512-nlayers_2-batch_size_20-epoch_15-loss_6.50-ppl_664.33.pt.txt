Can'T Be Sung Again. 

 Ask me the shadow of this song 
 that doesn't land a sound of sucking water there, 
 
 
 as from a land that glows over 
 for dark. Our crews come to sleep 
 in our house now, still quiet 
 in tiny letters, salt stone. 
 
 We know our day's joy for joy, 
 when the lost air, turns at the rock: 
 our children are teeth that cannot raise. 
 
 No! I have known again.
