Cartilage Shape, For 

 view? it is that you break with not my mind. 
 I need you and understand ... My own dear sex ... it seems 
 You should have mercy over and over, and on that brink 
 God's brows might be shut, here as in Veiling 
 
 With that only. I just want my thousand secular hydrangeas 
 I think you wanted from you! and you feel clear thirteen 
 Look from you here as he will, me, you don't hear 'em fly
