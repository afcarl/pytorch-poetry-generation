 
 But answer well those three fair rooms withstand, 
 
 Only, my sense, bides for ease with imperfection 
 
 Thou art or ever whither I have known, 
 
 And still in earth and saints is mine: 
 
 No presence wholly hath i' its soul a string, 
 
 To know how pretty poets there have found, 
 
 And falling still against the claims of soul; 
 
 They stand alone in vain and love to see; 
 
 And all my pleasures
