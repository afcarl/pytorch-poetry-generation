Us Off. 

 
 Just with me again, let me 
 hold me still. We turn no ledge 
 in the bathroom Millions, or the Bavaria 
 still flash off the stage. 
 It's my father, though I know 
 
 the woman blind--not perhaps, 
 Ay, whose father yes. 
 
 Do you think incomplete, 
 
 because it's clearly on love -- the words I wad have developed 
 or and, perhaps, would never be finished, 
 there are smoke inside me and I'm new.
