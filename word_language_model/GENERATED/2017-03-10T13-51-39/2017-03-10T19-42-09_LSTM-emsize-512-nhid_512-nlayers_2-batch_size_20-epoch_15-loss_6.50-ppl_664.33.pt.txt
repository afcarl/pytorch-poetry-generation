In Shades Shine After 

 a wave half of the end of a tree, 
 skull keener than the native sun, 
 and in the depths of the child's shirt 
 the moans in the window on a marge 
 the fragile world is drawn across and 
 
 the tree shines flexed over a distant cliff 
 
 past Housing men will lick the ripe pomp 
 between the dead and currents of hoof 
 rows of trees sand, Laid their creamy bags 
 over their bicycles
