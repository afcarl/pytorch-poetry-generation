 genesee to the mornin'. 
 
 A few wonderful Christians stand thro' 
 Never their last dim testicle springs 
 Hath made me sound 
 Of misery and intended?" 
 To the Lady of the Passion of sights 
 To fudge up the field. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Apologies to Music 
 
 
 The bloodie beauty that I first mean. Not one, 
 or power-steer. 
 
 And that words and woman, the ark 
 Of mankind chordal
