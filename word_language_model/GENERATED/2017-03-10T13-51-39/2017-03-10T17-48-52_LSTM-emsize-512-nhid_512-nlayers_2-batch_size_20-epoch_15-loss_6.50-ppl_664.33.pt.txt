 
 And I don't know if she are all my own god, 
 "She is the beginning of true times, 
 I have said the housewife of the day. 
 And I'm not as much other key, 
 I trust the lovely painless grasp and cry, 
 And rise from the bars and flee, 
 Leaning and wink like snow, 
 I watch all the keys of a hawk, 
 And kindled through the planks of the Phlegeton 
 And do accusation: my eyes play with wine.
