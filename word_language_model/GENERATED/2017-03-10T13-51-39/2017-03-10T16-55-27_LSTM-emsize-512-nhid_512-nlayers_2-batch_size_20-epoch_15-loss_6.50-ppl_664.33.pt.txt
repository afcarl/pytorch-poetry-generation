On Our Way Back To Sight. 

 When the cartridges locked behind them in the knives 
 Until their flint, the fibrous wind 
 
 Dreaming the sky alleys Fear, musically Knights glittering things! 
 The white glittered close to warm with its light 
 Is one perched on every plum moon, the flies 
 
 And averted decisive, slowly on their heads, 
 The luminous gathering lightning is espadrilles, 
 Beyond the underside of a dreamless wings. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Prayer from the Marble
