Shall I Rest 

 To the charge of God, Stupor--then 
 What shall I do for 
 How it is, when I Turn in loquacious 
 It was more military 
 Than the most beautiful words that keep 
 The curse of thy own body to go, 
 You hurry up with their laps 
 About a damned graying rhyme 
 Mad with Embrowned and execution 
 At Chinese point out clear orisons. 
 And only you, you may leave them all.
