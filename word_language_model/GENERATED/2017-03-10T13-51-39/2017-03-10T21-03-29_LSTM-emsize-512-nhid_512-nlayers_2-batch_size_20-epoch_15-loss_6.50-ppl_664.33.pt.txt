 The child with ashes buckeyes paste. 
 
 The field filled with Babel, 
 the crescent of light falling like a waterfall 
 from bakery, 
 On ingesteald sail under 
 a jo, room many 
 breaking into that dulled; 
 
 exchange for complainings 
 whose care 
 
 
 
 it seems to enter somewhere 
 
 
 
 
 X 
 
 
 A doll before you sell me. 
 But to be XXX 
 
 The crystal sand has come, 
 all that
