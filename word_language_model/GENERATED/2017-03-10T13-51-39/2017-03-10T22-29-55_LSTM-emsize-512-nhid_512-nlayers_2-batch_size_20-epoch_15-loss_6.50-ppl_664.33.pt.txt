Of Hell Toward The Height Of The Tergiversations 

 So on the keel of the improved blade 
 
 I may hear with the bell for love to see; 
 mused, a masque like a fragment without fire. 
 The mouth you're green, the moonlight, the inventions. 
 Hand tricks and drop your catch and little names, 
 Soft secret clouds that shift and feed through the leaves bugging 
 A Ed winter's carried a lesser force, 
 Yet the hour that I see your grave is mowed,
