 
 The blue dark 
 of the fields like heated sand bow 
 into the quiet tomorrow 
 one whispered to the battle-field 
 either one another 
 & you know 
 the children in your room, 
 drive them back on sweet deck of sand 
 another smiles of love time spilled for time 
 around us the pure ripples 
 of the palms 
 that smile from her house 
 ready to gather it 
 "chuck" 
 kiss and lie alone. 
 
 Be you!
