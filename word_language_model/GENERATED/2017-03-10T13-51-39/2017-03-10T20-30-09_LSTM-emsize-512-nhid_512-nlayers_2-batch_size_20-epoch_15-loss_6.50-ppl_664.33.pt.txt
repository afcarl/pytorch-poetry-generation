 
 One spiders like poor emotion 
 For a pillow a body 
 Eurydice's through her simplicity 
 us. The infix'd daughter 
 filling the Wally's back of their thighs, 
 Those slant leaves, I watch ships, those the boys 
 Unlaid, good women, returned 
 Embrace and twelve together, 
 And they their winds will look, 
 As if the world had ever seemed the same. 
 Who would for ever have seen me again, 
 I would not be content, nor ever told 
 One
