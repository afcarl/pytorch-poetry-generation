 Godwards herself that a maiden, Compos 
 A prince, the phantoms of the sense so bad, 
 That all around ex-psychiatrist and known; 
 Which wrought so strangely peeress, 
 But still at haste how exempt the faery labyrinthine 
 Of lost daylight in daily mazes quick 
 Leads to the mouth of morning and his King, 
 even's where the city--nightmare--black-- doubting, and dive, 
 Gathers the black stormy floor, then hears the lands 
 Of day and day, and down past stones grief:
