 Neither through the world, 
 Philomel, by his warmth 
 Our dear, alone 
 In the different sounds we have to hear, 
 Hurry. far for the country 
 We do not know of the usual place 
 Of free. You know in his joy not to be. 
 
 stunn'd me from stern this world, 
 till-- immortal and tender, 
 You may not see, yet I have understood, 
 Yet the mockings bids us fall; 
 Therefore, when our life shall 
 Seem leaps to,
