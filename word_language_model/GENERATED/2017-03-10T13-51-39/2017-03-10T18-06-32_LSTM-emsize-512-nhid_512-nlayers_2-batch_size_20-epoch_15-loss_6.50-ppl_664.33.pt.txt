 "sexually 
 
 
 Nobody could to write on, 
 A narrative of the fate's of fact, 
 If you were not the offspring we called home 
 Something something made there yea divine 
 On Black land and Southern sunlight. 
 
 For all he killed you to hunt was a little strange 
 In me and I am in the respect for his day: 
 I have traveled tomorrow in Berkeley gray trunks
