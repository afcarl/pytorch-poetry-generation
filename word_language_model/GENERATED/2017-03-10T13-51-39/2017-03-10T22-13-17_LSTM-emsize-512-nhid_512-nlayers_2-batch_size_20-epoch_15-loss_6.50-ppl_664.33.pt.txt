 "Beware A box. A second mannes eye 
 Like a buttercups in the sullen glades 
 Where God of Christ has fled without regret 
 And wake, too, glittering with freeze and fears. 
 And if there weren't a moment on the first end 
 Of sixteen men, not wanting to know, 
 Some old man prompt his tears, for the false swimmin'-hole. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Secret he'ad 
 
 
 To how the house of leaving first 
 
 Sand-strewn heavenly
