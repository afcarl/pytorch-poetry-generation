 When I thought of the Scale and the first 
 
 Bound to catch the stone from the Dark year? 
 Now the mare was hardly true 
 Which he shifts on it with open eyes, 
 The rat-faced was peace, and something left steadily 
 So knives and sour choir, 
 To scrub loose bills of chair; 
 Knowing if uncrumpling spears 
 extremis. 
 
 The world is a worm details 
 Whose image has kissed this whole scene 
 Of colours both,
