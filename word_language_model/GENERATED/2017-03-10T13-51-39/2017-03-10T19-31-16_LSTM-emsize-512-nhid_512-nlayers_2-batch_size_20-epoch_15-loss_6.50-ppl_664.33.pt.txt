The Open Choristers 

 Yet take both music to the heights in pride. 
 Lived on heaven which will not be trod 
 To the world's mansion from immortal sight. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Divine from the Argument 
 
 
 I 
 
 I have a hundred years. It must be, that which I supply 
 All of my friends my friend, they dare not waste 
 The night-wind, arms that roam by hearth 
 And know only those about dead, 
 That learned me
