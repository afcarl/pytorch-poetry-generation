 bonds? back alone, 
 Miles pressed open from fraught mouth, 
 Felt that days they stood in glitter 
 on Philoctete or hazards many-masted, The cherry-lightened wheels 
 
 they dined in dirt, then fell back 
 and bumping to heaven by happy sweater 
 on the granite joint. Did this him--he be? 
 What's the forum, that keeps itself 
 for all of us, but amas No, 
 I'll show that, I'll wake up with my hand 
 if she preach up to the machine
