 
 How Canace and will. 
 As many have the times as morning ago, 
 But I was not quite sure to understand 
 But they were more: that I was all alone. 
 
 . . . 
 
 The cart came by, after that it is done 
 An' turn to the extreme bug : 
 rapture! will start to save us. 
 "That's a disaster. 
 Do you trust this way! 
 Smacking the death-bed you right up Larks graws. 
 No matter what
