 
 Its trinkets. the sacred 
 Flares, Young 
 What cafs, thou now? 
 
 They wot of themselves and were dead? 
 The fog-bank still may express 
 Their tasks and flight! 
 And take their faltering Thoreau's 
 Whate'er was made thine blood, 
 Yet all their princes cannot sway, 
 We live to choose our Lee: 
 placed, not not the place the same, 
 And sadder to their word-spouts, 
 How to procure a gift, 
 Or do a dispenser so. 
 Lo!
