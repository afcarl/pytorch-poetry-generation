 
 By the dry last kisses lay 
 
 All flashes and fire. 
 
 His practice fails me Inordinate 
 
 Will him compass the lightning 
 
 Of what youth remains is of strength? 
 
 For when over the years youthfu' 
 
 The world's two mules glides vicious. 
 
 In vain corridors at pitteous heap with conquered; 
 
 Or tiny domo, in the shadows of Shame 
 
 Nor the breeze lifts in between, 
 
 And look in their affections,
