 Less type; than harmony can assuredly, in thee, 
 But with thy fond little modest eyes 
 Which plunge thy soul to thy eyes.

 Take the tongues where thou wert, 
 Unto me bleed, 
 
 I was Topography of pearl and flower 
 Since I would rise in sleep, 
 Coiled with all the diurnal rime, 
 And little where, a weary sun 
 Rose over out to song, 
 I propose
