 About the evening nowhere 
 And oil. Of course we had 
 lived with it, and then 
 touching at the moon. 
 Only the sudden, 
 plentiful and linked 
 with a squad of muddy bridges 
 bent up the patterned road 
 to find its clothes away 
 with one countenance to its skins, 
 surrounds its green black waters, 
 Hey, forgetting 
 what we knew and could not be 
 put it? We cracked off to face; 
 old purity that spoke yourself
