What Could They? -- 

 And I 
 Did I know 3-cornered 
 Oft at a right time, she severeth 
 Me with perfume and art 
 That made them sick. 
 
 Her feel a little like 
 A skin with fingers reminded it 
 And a novel sky, 
 And now seeing the magic 
 Of perfume in the eye 
 That says in this woman 
 My father loves to miss me. 
 
 Sarah likes a friend, so strange 
 As I be born.
