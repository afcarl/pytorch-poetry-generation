 Now and lives through the other leaves 
 Rare rooftops from the boy: 
 
 I move to exile and we rais'd 
 Last Stream at night; and can below, 
 Without the birds, or shade or pine 
 Upon this hot blossom where wind is dark. 
 This arm of lesson? statesmanlike, word thou dost not stir, 
 body--became not wounds in drop the ancient whorls 
 Of Warriours, men of soldiers cast 
 Around every readiness laugh, if voyage go, 
 Sarah died no more,
