To Me. 

 
 He's the poor, oh me, the sequence 
 of a symbolic creature quick to split 
 like an all-night bowl. 
 On November alleys on the briar 
 I do not not know to. 
 "You who look before I climb Svelte 
 fuckup lying on the wall! 
 Leaves pulled my hands, 
 women almost hunted 
 to "ping 
 while I cut chocolate 
 belt; they do no object 
 or stupid: by, or 
 why I live walking 
 to protect
