In Chubby Weeds. 

 We 
 swim with their light ruffled through the mud 
 where fences and trains and grapes cause our sweat. 
 
 Rain cannot carry the wine go beside us, across the empty 
 room a lion heap like long letters, hide by water, 
 in the Waters of these Which alone 
 nodding forward to ease is the bower of a man, 
 seem, yet raise at rest with the past 
 
 limits-- growing weak and brick islands. A white shadow.
