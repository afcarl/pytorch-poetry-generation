 
 I take the paths of these dry fingers 
 and warm the residue of Watching, 
 my body diving from my talents, 
 knowing the difference that I want to be tickle 
 lost mossy pineapple when I smell 
 me inside the way to hear 
 the passing 'embarrassed' I must love and return. 
 
 independentshared penknives, and pint of forms 
 turned from their thick stems. Now, it: 
 I don't think what's it-- 
 that frame they must never reach 
 from
