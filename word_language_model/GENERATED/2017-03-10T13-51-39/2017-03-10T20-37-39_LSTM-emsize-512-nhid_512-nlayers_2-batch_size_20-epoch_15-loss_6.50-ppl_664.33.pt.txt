But The Dust 

 
 Could kiss, the doubt that would, the wistful men, 
 
 The retreating Lee; 
 
 
 For he, as he turns, after he died again, 
 
 Ten hosts follows one man by sea-gull, 
 
 At play of a beauteous bunchy sent 
 
 To the stream of his rounds . . . 
 
 He called the king the Life bereft 
 
 When in words no ghosts, or sign, no Cinderblock 
 
 Good you! which they did for
