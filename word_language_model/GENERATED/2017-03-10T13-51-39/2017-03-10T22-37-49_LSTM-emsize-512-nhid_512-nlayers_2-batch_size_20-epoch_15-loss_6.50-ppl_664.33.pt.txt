Dish, A Notch Bear Target'S 

 County to handle the spell of her feet. 
 Earth lies under, 
 like the emptiness of a dank castle 
 that has endured, many a year 
 the old girl diminishing, and the state 
 is sucked out both by her life. 
 Vagina unspoken rootless, 
 but I'm able to take her apart, 
 and sheets: shaping things with locals 
 think how to remain until their windows become 
 no one in life. 
 
 The shadows on butter
