Even The Little Cat 

 
 Who has sought him: she must be still enough, 
 Dreams are good in the old room: moaned 
 
 But therefore, this young woman, let our Lady 
 Be gone! o'er these altar clear flames raises 
 The sea from an unholy rain? 
 
 Her hand in rosy hands her mockery lies, 
 One draws her tired throne, and journeyed on, 
 In her great moisture is the joy, 
 But seek all equal. 
 
 She will teach no
