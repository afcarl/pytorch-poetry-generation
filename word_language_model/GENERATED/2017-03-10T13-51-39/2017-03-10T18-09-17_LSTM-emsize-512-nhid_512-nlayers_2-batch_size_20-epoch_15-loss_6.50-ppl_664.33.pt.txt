Wotteth Heard Old Men And Children 

 (...after them; Men and flags are a subject 
 To poison dreams widens from black dust, 
 To feel the sound of certain thy own, soldiers, 
 To the fine shadows, of cool, the flesh raised and finger). 
 The spirit puts its silver and its works grey 
 And scented in the feel of the moon that moves 
 At last runner now worth a club among malicious 
 Camelot; 
 I need a manic rivulet into the mountain
