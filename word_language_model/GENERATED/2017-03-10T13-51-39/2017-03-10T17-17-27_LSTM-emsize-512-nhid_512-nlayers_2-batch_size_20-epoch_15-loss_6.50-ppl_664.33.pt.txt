To Kiss 

 passion-haunted bodies at the last! 
 
 briny alive 
 As an egg in the throat, 
 Our neat stern one, the rhythmic, Din. 
 But that mighty scene of truth 
 Is gone, one dust for Sunday skies; 
 Flying materially as the evening sky 
 
 Still beginning of the changing stone 
 Which is rare or free as duty, rudely confused 
 We can live here, the streets the votes and cities, 
 The clouds move to return, with wild buzzards,
