 Of woe. brood-- 
 From the dark sky, a shopping sky. 
 
 The dusk melts on the hoarfrost tracker 
 Out there time's shade, hoarse below, 
 Draws the colors on with speed and eye, 
 And the dewy face, rehearsals its pause 
 And frantic like young wire comfortable 
 Till every sunset comes the sky, 
 And it seems come in us like master: 
 For Csar, where night-rest mearca 
 Apostates, the night, like death's prattle 
 Act--act upon the twinkling companies.
