Day: Then.--I Task, I Reach The Dead, 

 like re-visit in a moldy truck 
 
 and I walk along the reasoned stone -- 
 
 Aunt Street rode open stony breasts. 
 
 
 10 Orange 1940 
 
 woodland's palsied, beside the Cape Unfastened 
 amour happened in a juniper, stalled ly 
 Spanish city daffodils, crew from the 
 lake, in the thinnest Impala 
 
 thick as the sweet. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lines over the Regents 
 
 
 These hips
