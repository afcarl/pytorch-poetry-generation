To Tread A Airy Spike 

 
 Nor that water, except like a tournament, 
 And kneeling with a sting of disease 
 To Scipio, a prickly "Works 
 stock-still out of ignorance and dismay. 
 The crossing Stork, a tumble sette 
 A common garden in the sky, 
 Heaven has cracked wet still over them and falls, 
 And in their troops are blowing slowly, 
 Calm and weary and sweet glass--and 
 Over whose flowers the sun, 
 Shall not grieve but for just death,
