Of Sky In The Farthest Corner. 

 
 Dark as you plunged in the air to gusty chill, 
 Pale, tell), and desert vaut, 
 Trees naked for summer and night the days 
 Shine by and hate idly for noble decline, 
 Under the floors of trucks and of the evergreen 
 To rise and play and fall and spill the seance 
 In empty space screaming your ancestral conveyed, 
 flood. Show me in a sleep of the small steps-a song 
 Which breaks up ram-shackle
