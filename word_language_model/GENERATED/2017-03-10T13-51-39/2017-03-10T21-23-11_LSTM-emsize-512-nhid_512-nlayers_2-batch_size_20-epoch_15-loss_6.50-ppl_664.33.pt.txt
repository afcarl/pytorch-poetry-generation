Death At Just Time. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 tweyne, 
 
 
 Stand on the fog brown wide nurst, 
 Feed the flakes that slowly silently sweep upon the floor. 
 repeal, a storm played near, cantata by May. 
 In the silence of Natural pleasures, 
 Voice of life and love I am gray-eyed of bread. 
 
 Ah, impossible to fill the ceiling with me, of a perfect sound, 
 With fruitless Chill hovering over in a lovely way of dimness field,
