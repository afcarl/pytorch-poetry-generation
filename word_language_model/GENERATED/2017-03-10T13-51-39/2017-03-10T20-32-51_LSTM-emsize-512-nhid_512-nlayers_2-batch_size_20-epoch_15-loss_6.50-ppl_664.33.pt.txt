 There's no lie on this canal 
 
 
 We cannot let Him go here see this Iranian 
 
 We have not seen from heaven but stars of love. 
 What matters in us is this world is a field there, 
 The hermit clash of the East jaws and the sound 
 Is the greatest part of the palest starboard till the light rises, 
 The growing, feeding the rocks worn to the waist, 
 And west from us to the dark boats disappear
