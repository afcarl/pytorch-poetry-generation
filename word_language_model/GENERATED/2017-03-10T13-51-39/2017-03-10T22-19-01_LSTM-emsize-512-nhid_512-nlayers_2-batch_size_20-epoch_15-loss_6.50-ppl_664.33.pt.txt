Example--Turn The Skies-- 

 Looking at your heart comprehendeth for 
 It's still the end of implumis; 
 
 Of perpetual Fox and then 
 the bony greeny-blue, 
 
 Removed 
 to Squeez'd 
 from its muddy leaves--the brow. 
 There is something to be simpler 
 than beautiful heels. 
 
 
 VIII 
 
 When the C14 pulls 
 
 off the lane along the cooling frame. 
 Left in the o'clock a clood. 
 
 Kiss out the rabbits, 
 bo'n. Lieutenant, state.
