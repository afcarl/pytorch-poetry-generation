We Sit At The Old Moon, 

 We let him walk and toss and urge the light. 
 
 We have looked into our old grave. 
 My husband pours me against my mouth. 
 I walk with the scales! Moorfields: 
 Besides, I am sure, this hour. I shall be drunk 
 At the sea near October Blue and the gray 
 Pale and water, what a flock of noorse: 
 Buried over branches that rise in the wind. 
 The voices enterprize 
 The still boy
