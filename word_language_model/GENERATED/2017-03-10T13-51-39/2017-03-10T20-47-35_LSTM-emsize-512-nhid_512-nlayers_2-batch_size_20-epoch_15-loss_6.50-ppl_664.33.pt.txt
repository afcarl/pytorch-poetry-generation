 the lower mud of your sleeve, 
 the hospitals taste 
 of green tenderness. 
 the moth Fruit silent the martyrs' mattock 
 as feather rhetorical. At the core, 
 the light house downward and arbors, 
 
 task, I knew my fingers 
 on triple-forked 
 Could no cross. 
 
 In the Strip station 
 the bomb, of a career 
 of roadward all, which 
 couldn't be a worked; 
 and abandoned 
 the emotions of Rustum? 
 I was strong 
 enough provoke
