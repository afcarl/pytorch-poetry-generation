Prepare A Little Scent Of Shame Wynd 

 Grinning along the line and we anon 
 On the back, came to me, 
 yule; us right weeping, beat out her name 
 With a torn and red tone out of the air. 
 
 Now the wind 
 Makes evening wet, they had set them apart, 
 She said: "The moth would kiss her mouth alone. 
 
 Yielded 
 Her soul is singing firm but faint 
 Thy smiles and lips are laden 
 And sullen water
