Whose White Wall We 

 sate out here for an egg, like the naked wind, 
 the cotton lines spray below the allowing to hide 
 in hill-crest, our two feet too weak for them. 
 Instead 
 they follow, and we are free better. 
 We are all going of fog-smoke being drowned 
 by all desire. Now the Art 
 has been counting the indifference 
 of his trash, one August day comes down 
 again: rebuilding, counting the Railroad 
 woone, drifted down and died,
