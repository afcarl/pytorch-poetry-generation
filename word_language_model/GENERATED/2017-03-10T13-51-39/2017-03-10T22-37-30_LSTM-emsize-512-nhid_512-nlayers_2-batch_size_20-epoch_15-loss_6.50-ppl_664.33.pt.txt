Down New York! 

 not distant actor's but still still 
 lay aloof 
 in front of these high cages, splintered 
 plastic, for demented half-shadow, 
 permission! the loud world of love 
 
 for their own 
 precisely known of ghosts 
 that ate no times, tad begin 
 to shout the icy symbol of poems 
 in this rostra. 
 but couldn't drink up again 
 to Sears, 
 Those buildings to etch 
 those pleasures, 
 passing accidental booths 
 of twisted fire.
