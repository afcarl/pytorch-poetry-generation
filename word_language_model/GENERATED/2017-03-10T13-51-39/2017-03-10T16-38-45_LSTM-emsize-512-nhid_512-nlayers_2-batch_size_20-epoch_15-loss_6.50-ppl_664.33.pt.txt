 Threat'ning in April's thought the Earth, 
 little crows who seek in spite of constant flake, 
 Those of the events, so fair, so grip 
 the blacks arch of The pores 
 down into Alpine warfare one 
 knows meet. Inside these oft-repeated moments 
 the higher consolation are hesitated 
 in each other's captain's underwater garden, 
 
 the stranger a child feels them from the blue 
 
 waiting where will ask the cruel weather 
 from Spring to belly turn to deck,
