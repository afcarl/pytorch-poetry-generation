Deep Grass South Right, 

 And nothing leapt but extended onward came 
 Here the steep shattered grass handbanan 
 And imperial thoughts that shook the storm, 
 The tender walls of constructions altering haste 
 To tremble in a livid mirror, 
 As where the others were felt frail and all; 
 And the wounds of her garments broke awake, 
 And do not such a distance, even worth 
 Of holes that swings them after, dust. 
 
 I would not one say-- one thought,
