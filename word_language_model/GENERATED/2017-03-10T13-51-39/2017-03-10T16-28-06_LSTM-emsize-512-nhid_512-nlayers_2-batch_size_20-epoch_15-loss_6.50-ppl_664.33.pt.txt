Sleighbells, 

 Ivor locked, his head lush feathers full of blood. 
 He has begun out opening Petit, 
 Streets in stride, yelled with thumb, cool ironical documents 
 and glowing voices like libraries on the draft of a questioning tiers 
 and a uselessness. A plain fly from the wall-- 
 in separate ways to trace what are able to rot in the cane. 
 I release the exercise of the earth, meals freed to the sky. 
 My heart felt open and shut in its pockets
