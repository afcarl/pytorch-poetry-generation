Day! 

 
 All in her mighty grove, her eyes hero-lay 
 foretelling, too, drew down my feeble throat, 
 And pierced my companions, while her hands so fine 
 Like snakes that would stand, but always went 
 Full faint with rain like tides of gold: 
 Facing the long skeletons of glaciers young, 
 She steals from darkened side in fields and tide! 
 An vale, like a measured bird, and she 
 Coming asleep along a road and pale 
 And patiently as dawn came
