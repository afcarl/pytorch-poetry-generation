 Sing the Helen to drink and dry 
 And nigh beside the city 
 "Are the word I write, 
 You who will tell Philomel,--an Land. 
 You won't catch. 
 You do what you want 
 Surely there's no wisdom 
 Approaching a fungus song 
 
 Is giving you a word 
 Of things running away 
 As you paint your Tortue. 
 But do not test love.
