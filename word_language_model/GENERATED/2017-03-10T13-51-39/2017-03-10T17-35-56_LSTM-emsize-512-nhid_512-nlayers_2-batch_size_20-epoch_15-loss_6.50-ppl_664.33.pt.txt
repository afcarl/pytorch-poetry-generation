 Neither Forbearance nor deadly Death! 
 I should not be less. 
 If certain these don't live alone. 
 Is that what you can remember 
 is everything in this wide town 
 not under understood, 
 perhaps, she could not wear 
 , not even yourself read. 
 She flash; old house, 
 and slow steeds; sweet and black 
 against the soft stone of her swollen wrist, 
 the noiseless sun
