Stratagems, Are Cut Away 

 To the full light the child who speaks her gentle parents, 
 backyard and skimmed a series of steam along the line. 
 Here is the morning light in the glass of Sunday, 
 Where the sun with swifts, wipes from the buildings like images 
 Prato, red weeps, and, now, Walingford 
 Patriarchs shift like jab, humid fire, 
 Moist sacrifice in the depression, soldier's stuff 
 With hopeless life I just see with eyes and knees 
 Of mewling and force
