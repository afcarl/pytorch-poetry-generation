And Lady! 

 Thine eyes each other to the love-darting shore 
 And buds of azure mints, manifold whispers, a 
 snake. 
 
 To which, and you must speak, I lost the time 
 That moment from some ancient flow'r would hurt you. 
 If you were stretched Prolong the empty space 
 Like pieces of somber skies, 
 And the new grass and half. 
 
 Now I am your To-be-forgotten 
 I consider your voices hard, 
 Your exile, give to satisfie your laws.
