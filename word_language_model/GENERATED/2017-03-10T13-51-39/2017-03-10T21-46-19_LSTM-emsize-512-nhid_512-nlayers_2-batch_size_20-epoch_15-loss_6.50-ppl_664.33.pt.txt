 
 Shall reach'd then to doors did it languish, 
 " When the Locks with which too plainly pursue, 
 
 Look'd out of these Achitophel's Laertes ears, 
 
 And crown'd with natural motion, glory, 
 
 "The sunshine glass. 
 
 
 Such as the bush, that mounts and lie 
 
 Twelve remaining faces, the mortal heart lies o'er, 
 
 Yet south the brightness to yonder depth 
 
 Shall make a evidence,-- 
 
 When the great wind beats many a day.
