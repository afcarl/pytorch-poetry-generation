Death Is A Fleeting Sea, 

 When the combos and silence puts upon her wake 
 At night, and I am cold without thee. 
 lotteries one more stroke to fetch me ere her. 
 
 
 V. 
 
 They are we'll die 
 What will they do of. 
 We are always aware spumy down the hill, 
 We hew beneath our station. We look 
 Two and two days a minute 
 With nothing but one voice 
 That remembers what we have.
