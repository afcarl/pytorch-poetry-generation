Of Nymph'S Spirit-Stirring Corse 

 On the bearded logs -- my teaching pride, 
 And I cannot deem it. threats in my strong will, 
 The gate turns sausage. direct, across my offerings, 
 There, to another city the blessed heart 
 Trembled the trident of modern strife, 
 And I stand voyager o' harm the repeld, 
 Ah, day! I have concentrated hands & legs on paper. 
 Tender comes a little, their personal length 
 (The latter are some yoke by proud: 
 
 Thirty years
