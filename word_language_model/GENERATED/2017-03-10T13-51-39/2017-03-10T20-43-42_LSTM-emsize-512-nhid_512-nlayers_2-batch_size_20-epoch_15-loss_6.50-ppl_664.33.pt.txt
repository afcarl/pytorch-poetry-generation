Breakout, Shall He Die? 

 Let me from't, and I'll part the heavy first 
 And wipe the tea while they tend to mien 
 Straight to the rest of their throne. 
 
 My lady is so fast! the cross, 
 That doth have therefore left her heart to me, 
 But I have loved her silver through; 
 Unlike my heart to guide the painful way, 
 But never --October with life's power I find 
 Only her hands. 
 Another pity thou this hast drown'd,
