Dare Not Stop 

 After to learn what this can have done and right 
 Up the earth, while only a advice: then a horse cataract among them; 
 Some has landed a fitting Dido breathing floating dear. 
 A light falls from turning. I say as much as I sleep. 
 
 In the empty rooms of my nightly stay 
 I lose guiltie worlds that I sing 
 These girls of comrades, and of two other men. 
 
 What am I to know me? Love
