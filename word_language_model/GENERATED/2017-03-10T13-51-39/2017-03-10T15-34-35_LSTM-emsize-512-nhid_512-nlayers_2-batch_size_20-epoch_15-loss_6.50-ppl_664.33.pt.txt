 How not you seek me for whom you know, 
 My first pain would be finished. 
 I helps you not yet only lost, 
 You bind me, and be Heft 
 Even that your case is before: 
 I will say, as you have discovered 
 In this poor, then you shall be; 
 That here I have one lost life's while. 
 
 Ye be King's; 
 (I am the sickly song, 
 And the arms of the picture, 
 And the heart that sought
