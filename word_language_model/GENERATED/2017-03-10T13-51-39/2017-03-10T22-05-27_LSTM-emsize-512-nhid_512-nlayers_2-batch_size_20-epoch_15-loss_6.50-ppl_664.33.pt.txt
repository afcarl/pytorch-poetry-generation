 But the expression of my heart 
 Is beautiful to sing between us? 
 (homage Yule hard blue, no protection 
 Dwelt in the multitudinous bow'r, 
 And the dregs of cake; 
 And the Lord of love to tell, 
 If assumptions should are no rest 
 The end of Kittie 
 Nor do thy children artless 
 Sit of air. 
 
 From off excursive, commit me to the grass, 
 I shine; a fortnight of yon water-hen 
 untying; raign, and Saul headings
