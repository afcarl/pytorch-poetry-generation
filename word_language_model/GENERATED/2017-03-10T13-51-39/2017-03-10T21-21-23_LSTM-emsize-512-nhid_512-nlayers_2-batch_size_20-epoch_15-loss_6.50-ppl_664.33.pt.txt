To Shut And Thrill 

 And easy on a clothesline of horse, 
 Strike up by righting of crimson, which, 
 These hairs, and Glory bravely die. 
 
 Through the long evening batter'd 
 With annual eyes 
 Toward uncontrollably riding in the dark? 
 Contention is a K's thing for movin', 
 moust, and snag are isles, 
 The allegory of the piers. 
 
 Now across of water moves, 
 Dust dull and pale and shorn without it; 
 Armed for hard clothes. 
 Stretched
