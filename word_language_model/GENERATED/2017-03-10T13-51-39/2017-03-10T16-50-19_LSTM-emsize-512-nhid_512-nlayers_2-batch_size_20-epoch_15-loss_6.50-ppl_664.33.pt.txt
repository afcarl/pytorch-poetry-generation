Him, 

 started Agion always in; if her absence 
 seemed again. 
 
 Yet the demand 
 of things didst be more music. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Love green-tinged 
 
 
 When the wind came still. 
 In the spring of a dark street, 
 The boat we restore, 
 And we meet the red rugs at the empty ages. 
 We are the blades of clucking clay, 
 It means a voice to weep, let things lie on us 
 As we see,
