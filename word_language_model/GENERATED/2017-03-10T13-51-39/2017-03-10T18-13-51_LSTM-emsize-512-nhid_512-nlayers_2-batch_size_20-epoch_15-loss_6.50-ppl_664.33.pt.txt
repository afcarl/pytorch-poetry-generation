And Bran Of Hell; 

 Through days of the realms of the angels played, 
 And the gulf continent's soft and mostly all that it was, 
 To spin our cheeks with entirely cover 
 The hornd shore May 
 The thunder held bright desirous, 
 In the scent of dust and splendor of repose, 
 These winters have vanished from the neck 
 Of mere joints, without knowing death or spring, 
 We would be through, or here; 
 them, or any fear of England 
 On
