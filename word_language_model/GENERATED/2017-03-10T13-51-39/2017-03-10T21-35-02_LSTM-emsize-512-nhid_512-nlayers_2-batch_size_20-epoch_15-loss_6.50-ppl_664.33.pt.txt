 
 In an instant it might have seemed a lot. 
 In my world the ear grows higher white, 
 Gathering softly streaming through the sparkling sky, 
 Or a feller born that thee,--and pure, 
 With beating joy and nobler lays. 
 O snare of imagin'd stert my tears 
 And mine, with joy to gild full trees 
 The very saints oscillation, and their shrill tops 
 stand rooted in white eyes. In envy, wealth, 
 And LEGO-like, elemental witted burn; 
 Stretching misshapen, gyves.
