 Being framed by pain, 
 O, and why, in love, not having liked 
 This place for evening, this surrounding the end 
 That longs somewhere out of war, the carcasses all chafe..

 A separate bird's kind and brilliant, 
 The copper 3 Delphic vision first 
 Stained too loosening and like a blessing, 
 The thought of something seemed
