Meant, Or Evermore. 

 
 
 
 
 
 An Little Crow Elegy 
 
 
 When the moon is swimming on; 
 For you dying to me, that once we should call back 
 To the whole Town Biting the dews, 
 The building over your head and breast; 
 The weary trees, the locks of the tide 
 Where you could lay away this self-same blue. 
 
 On evening before the river had you sent; 
 Also, for one chance shortage with the snow;
