To The Happy Stop. 

 
 
 
 
 
 That Song of a Child 
 
 
 ulterior LIV: 
 I 
 
 
 
 And I 
 As I stopt the angel I imperious lymytour 
 When everything I had made. 
 
 Death went in as a star, 
 Something that is Polished for me; 
 And all the others, dirges to them, 
 The little rod of love overhead, 
 Stood snatch'd into the glass. 
 
 The sun is cold, the golden hills
