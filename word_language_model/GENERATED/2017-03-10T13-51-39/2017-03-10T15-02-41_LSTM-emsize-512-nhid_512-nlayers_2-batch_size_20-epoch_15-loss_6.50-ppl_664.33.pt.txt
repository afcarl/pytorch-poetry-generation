 
 To rub myself a blind 
 
 surveyest teeth, and sethe, and concealed 
 moldy and bee. A Servicemen, 
 assimilate, stick-burglars 
 To a kneels in a windy town in the tree. 
 Still, here the wind trembles among 
 The Bad base 
 Which doesn't speak 
 The same name 
 Among the changes & the bent 
 quest, of life, must burn a little princess 
 On my side, 
 Be pushed in part clenching, 
 To worship where I lived in waggery,
