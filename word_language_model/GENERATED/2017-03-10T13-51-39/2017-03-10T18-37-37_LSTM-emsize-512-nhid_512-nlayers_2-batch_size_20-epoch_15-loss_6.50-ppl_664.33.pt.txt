Spring Like A New Bed. 

 
 
 
 
 
 Eve 
 
 
 The 1 winnter, Matilde 
 With rosy silk 
 For streame and clattering summer 
 We were here together 
 In an empty cuff 
 Of jug, and of living, 
 Of gravity, 
 
 In swirling wood 1911-1984 
 Here takes Hardening 
 The island of gulls, 
 Friday summer day. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Way goes mad. The Back environ Is Wai 
 
 
 1. 
 crocked.
