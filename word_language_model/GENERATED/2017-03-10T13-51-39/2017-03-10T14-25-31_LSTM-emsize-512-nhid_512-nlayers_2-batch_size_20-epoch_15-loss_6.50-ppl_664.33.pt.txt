Childhood And Will Cry 

 With no sound of Paradise at the seams. 
 
 
 
 
 
 For My Cat 
 
 
 Oh the ones of love do not to-morrow you? 
 
 VII. 
 
 4. Vincit happy, Holds 
 
 To all the ordinary danger. 
 I have chose the milkman's head 
 To wash down my brother's body and bathe that batters date, 
 And lets go and go to the air to lie in the woods, 
 And played indistinct,
