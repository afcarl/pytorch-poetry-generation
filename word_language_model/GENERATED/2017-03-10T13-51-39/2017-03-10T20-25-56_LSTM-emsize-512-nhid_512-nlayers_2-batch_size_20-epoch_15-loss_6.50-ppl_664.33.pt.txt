Me Chaste And Cotton-Trading 

 Contented for temper what I move. 
 To thee I come, when low and evil is nought, 
 Thou leave me by the night, and fold even to me; 
 And I support it when I disdain'd, and tempt it; 
 Whilst the days turn past me like a sail 
 My cheek will never mend, 
 No longer may they? 
 Around, the houses that are strangely in oceans there: 
 
 So the thunder 's follies and the young they hum.
