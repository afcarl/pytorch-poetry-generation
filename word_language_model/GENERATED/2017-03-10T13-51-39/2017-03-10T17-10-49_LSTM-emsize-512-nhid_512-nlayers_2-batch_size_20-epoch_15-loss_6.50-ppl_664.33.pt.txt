 Prove a sexual critic be spurred? 
 If by making thanks that people heed their sense. 
 While they offer the women and I had no end. 
 
 So long nights they not come open to hold. 
 
 You bathe my right. It's too late. Such things 
 It may have Jim. No one can make out at, 
 Since the bold fastness; once himself official, 
 In blank and amber, the rank of my peers; 
 High in silent room the moon comes over
