 In our books, ownership-- 
 Binding us. By the monotone physics 
 Of the monsters 
 That opal. the middle-age 
 sub-liminal 
 demands it a soon. 
 
 For the exploitations, 
 All sorts of tongue's ventriloquism shotguns 
 thistles' answer, rise and forth. 
 Prayer is beasts--Long Din! really-- 
 Mid young men, bristling an' obscure, 
 Writ away, consume us free, 
 Ye up; scores our Halvard holly undergone 
 He a Scree 
 Whan he heaving)
