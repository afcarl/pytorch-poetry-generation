Is Like A Metro With A Wink. 

 Bright circumference unmeasur'd by it to its knees, 
 And a bikini. But that's delight like the even-- in the Reuch cellar. 
 
 Now your mother strains and I'm completely at your game: 
 Give me some singer rupture. Dripped 
 And somewhat to save me. 
 
 For now who sits on the dark of the black, 
 And seen him to the stars where the wind bark Wac-A-Mole 
 He chin; and ran away with the curls
