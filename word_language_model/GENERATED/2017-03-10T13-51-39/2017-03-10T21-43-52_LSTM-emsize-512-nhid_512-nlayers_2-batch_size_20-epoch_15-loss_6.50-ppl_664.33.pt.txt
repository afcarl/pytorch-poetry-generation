Crypt. 

 among houses and tunes of bliss and moss. 
 
 Pale, rush on the wave, 
 branching in history, and not," they choose, 
 where the spears meal in the dry rebellions 
 moving as if into laughter and flesh and poetry, 
 
 as soon as the Lady of hinge. But the thing is to believe 
 it may change to the imagined sea; kisses and blade, 
 it means again in cold wilds of air, killed now, 
 but by the population of days
