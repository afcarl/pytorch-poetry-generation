Minds. Product Of Our Youth, She Knows 

 The ways are permitted to Howard's us. 
 The times I've done that grief is false and dear 
 You won't feel that you've been born all polite, perhaps 
 Turn the movement of the earth up and join the dawn! 
 We had ourselves in our own perfect age. 
 Meanwhile in the past the looms window between us, 
 infatuate and bad as anointed men master. 
 
 XXI 
 Here in pieces of bats, its best bridal-wreath
