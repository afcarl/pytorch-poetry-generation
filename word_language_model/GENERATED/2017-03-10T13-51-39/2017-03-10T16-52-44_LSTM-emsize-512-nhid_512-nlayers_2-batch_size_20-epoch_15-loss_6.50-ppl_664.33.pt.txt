Drowned His Body, 

 Blest dear that but his eyes are all wires? 
 Like clouds in darkness. Our faces played 
 At their throats & ate to our surprise, 
 And chase their pots and plumy checked hecho 
 And each of them hanging east and down: 
 But oh! at all with the augurs trembling 
 In the mild light forest's with chime. 
 
 Ascend the river, from the chilling board, 
 Rudolph Teachers sans piping. 
 The fierce scream deep within the sun,
