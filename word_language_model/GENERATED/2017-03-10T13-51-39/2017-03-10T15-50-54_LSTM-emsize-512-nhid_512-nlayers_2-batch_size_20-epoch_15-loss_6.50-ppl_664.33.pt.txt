Seems The Same, 

 And the look of us all want only then? 
 God knows how it is, and smells in the eye 
 Of our days despite you, and pray Penury crownd 
 Your parting dreams in the filmic face of Birmingham 
 And serve your breath. They need each time you should call it! 
 My desire is a thing like a shadow, that you are, 
 There is only a skeleton in the sun, till the fangs flash at their toes. 
 For now,
