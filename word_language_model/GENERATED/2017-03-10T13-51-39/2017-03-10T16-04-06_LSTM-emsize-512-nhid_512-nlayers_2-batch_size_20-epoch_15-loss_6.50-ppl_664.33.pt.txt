There Is Nothing, 

 nothing is truly different from what, instead, 
 When I not see if even in fact, 
 I remember you, now; you ought to know, 
 synonym and sick. When all that's all you've got, 
 You may have seen a lot at what you saw, 
 Blessed be none in common India, 
 Would grieve you for a little quarter: 
 I did not mind you there new-risen 
 But knows what cakes or shame! 
 
 I want you like the horizon
