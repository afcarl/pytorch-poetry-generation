Grain Csure. 

 I trod, and then begin to howl. 
 No crime. No kindness, no war, no shadow burns, 
 The flowers blooming foot upon the forehead of the land, 
 supplejack dome of torn lanterns in my ways, 
 I clean the market, and storms that frame and rise 
 Behold the fringes of the wheat below and shout 
 Down from the curb: for years and his calm gulls 
 By dull fare to him lonely daylight and I meet 
 With myself child, Edison,
