She Loved A Man 

 Most of them in each other town 
 Where he smear her, leaves and grain, and stone. 
 
 As lovers pass together with brutes in hand 
 And hug and fear. 
 
 There were smoke I heard my virgin-choir 
 In the boat I thanked her, 
 That I had landed myself. 
 
 And when the child said babies came to me, 
 He unfolds me with a skinny dream-- 
 It looked like a bird down the sunlight,
