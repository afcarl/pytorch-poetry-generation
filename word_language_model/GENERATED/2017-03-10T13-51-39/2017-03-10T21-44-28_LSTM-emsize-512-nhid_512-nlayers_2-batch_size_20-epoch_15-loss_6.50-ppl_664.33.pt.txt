 Kommandant and the bad rules of Heaven! 
 God is in hell in Eden at lilac-time; 
 And then, for the world-greetings...quick 
 Sit in my soul. 
 
 
 
 
 
 cheerd 
 
 
 O scoop and cross 
 All day it held 
 To take the harvest meant 
 To see what it did 
 Had pig's. Keep these lot 
 But given it! 
 Sit up 
 Farmers sunbeams: rat 
 To wander in turn, 
 Big-voiced Parlors 
 bloom-fest poppies
