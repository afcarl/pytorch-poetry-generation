Not Sorry. 

 Yet is it for your friend. 
 
 Amyntas is the strife. 
 What have you come to the end of Hoarfrost 
 What is Kiss. flickers 
 If they must melt over us 
 Galatian Hoover. 
 
 I believe America I believe in your way? 
 You count one lone tract across the street, 
 The church is playing on the riverbank 
 Where the altar saith the sway in my heaven, 
 There is nothing in a place where mine is been,
