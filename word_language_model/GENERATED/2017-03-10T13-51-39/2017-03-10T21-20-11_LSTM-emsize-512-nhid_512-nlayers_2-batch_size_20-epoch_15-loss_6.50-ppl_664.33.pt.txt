 
 Time my sister, fair lot! my tearful heart 
 With Love's lips Rebellious, me, and I hear the voice 
 I shall glide and wait, my friend, I have no delight. 
 
 And thou for so calm, when a god of midnight, 
 I shall answer and smell myself, 
 Will pulse in sufferance for the day, 
 To his white men, to bear the heart his Song 
 From undisturb'd to shield the spirit he knows. 
 
 
 
 
 
 mistranscribed Exile
