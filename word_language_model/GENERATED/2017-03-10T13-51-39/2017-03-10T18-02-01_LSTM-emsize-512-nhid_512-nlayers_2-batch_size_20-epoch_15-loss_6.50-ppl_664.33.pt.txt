 Ten months on this high tower 
 Where London is wide and still, 
 As the sun in sunlit wave gleamed round. 
 In the white he looks one street close to his brood. 
 
 Then hearing this wild sparrows hating me, 
 They think certain plough and in, 
 How they shall love with their child. 
 
 The trees are low 
 And are dead. 
 They sit together up and shine 
 At the queenly edge 
 Of living eyes who stretch
