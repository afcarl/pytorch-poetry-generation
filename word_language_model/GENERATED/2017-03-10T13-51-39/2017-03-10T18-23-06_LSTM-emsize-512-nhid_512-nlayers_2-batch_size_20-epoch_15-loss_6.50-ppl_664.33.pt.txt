 1940s. Alice, pozole, and bubble. 
 And the people are all for labor for him 
 To tempt with taking them stiff or closer 
 As if they picked glittering air before 
 With popcorn arms and his hands to feel 
 Until they paused and looked down a straw 
 And felt how vast the people come. 
 Nobody can match the sea in the market-place; 
 My Captain Cleaned so true! 
 She scrapes the house, and she says, 
 Cries the morning that's
