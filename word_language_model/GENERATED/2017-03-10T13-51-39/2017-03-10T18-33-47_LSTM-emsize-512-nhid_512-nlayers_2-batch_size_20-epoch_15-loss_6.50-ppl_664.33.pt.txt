 On the rich gates' Valleys, high'r; 
 Like floors of birdcage, so that they so 
 Are clothed with lofty teeth, 
 apartment; thro' each winding rustling things 
 Through silver, legion of an hour. 
 I only crowded where I lay, a sight 
 To feel my head, I consecrated 
 The first part sunny of my loss, 
 The Church in "Ke-day, as by old, we named 
 The pomp and glimm'ring flames of dubious pride; 
 The bully smile
