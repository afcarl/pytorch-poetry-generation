Told It In A Westerner 

 To the senses, and stay away. Always 
 You'd rather be lonely or sorry, and, no, 
 actually 
 splayed-out not soon, not my own strange heart, 
 Safe in the faithful market on her above. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Strange Captains 
 
 
 Of the rose up the street at our feet. 
 When the gloves gets up free from far, 
 the reefs. A blackboard. A train 
 
 gobbled out & deep thought the sunlight
