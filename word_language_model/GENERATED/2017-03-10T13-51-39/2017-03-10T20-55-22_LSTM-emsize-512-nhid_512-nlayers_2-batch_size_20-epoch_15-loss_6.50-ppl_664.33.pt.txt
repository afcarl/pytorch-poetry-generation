Stones In Heaven. 

 reside of the mouths strikes rivers at evening, 
 the gash work to arms, how they have gone my bones 
 precisely in the rubble of bundled through the stones. 
 
 I too am the dazzling, secret for the future, pavement the gift. 
 Last year I need through the glass of a roost, 
 nothing is calm, it is free. 
 
 You have come home. You gates? 
 everything sucks around me. 
 I should have been a harpoon. 
 honor.
