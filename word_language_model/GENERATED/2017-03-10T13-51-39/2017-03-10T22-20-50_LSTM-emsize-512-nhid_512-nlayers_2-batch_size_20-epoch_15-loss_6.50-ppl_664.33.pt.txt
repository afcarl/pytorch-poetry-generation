 wheat-wheat-wheat-wheat out of then alone, and still, 
 a old god dissolving and refused to produce 
 
 the sky felt little briefly in the valley 
 and sky of am'rous tunnel across the clouds, 
 and above the brush, the Tartarus, 
 a flower kneeling loud in the world, 
 the open of a bull's life; my friends 
 rattle to the face of their weight, their fingers 
 showed me back into their lungs, my father's face 
 black with sticks and slow
