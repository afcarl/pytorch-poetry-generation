Your Dens Have Slack, 

 If you keep so much as life you were, 
 That other others will bleed. 
 
 All wars and fetid pictures and of kings, 
 Laurel with tears, of the bond of lust, 
 seashore: for peace, or else balms of ease, 
 We have warmer and free from mirth 
 Of love and operatic crowded with despair, 
 boomlay, seeming, we talk, we lov'd, 
 We shall have been the only matter grow 
 Strike up in our glazes our dread
