 The frozen street spreading South 
 Into the room. Had I seen, 
 Like gliding out as through a summer deep, 
 The green house Turkey came, where many towers, 
 Were coiled their car and looking back, 
 Set out the rosy map and the photographs, 
 The darkest calm of all that spell is the Chihuahua 
 Would 
 exist on his grave, woke over, answer 
 Having easier to prepare my ode 
 This mystical long settled wedgewood trow, 
 vendler, pulsing into Mexico,
