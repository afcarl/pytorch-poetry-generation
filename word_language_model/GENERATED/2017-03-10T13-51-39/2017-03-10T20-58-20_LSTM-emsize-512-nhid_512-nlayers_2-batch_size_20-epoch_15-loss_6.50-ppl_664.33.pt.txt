They Wait Behind, 

 They like to shed the little leaf 
 Our beauty moved to their viands light. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Colin Meeting: sexual Infinity, impartially 
 
 
 On Mended by Water we Kubla tossed 
 To the Silvan Sea, 
 And fans with storm and mouth 
 Upon the tide of Nod. 
 
 "O hide translations: my little sunflower, 
 Still panels: and Caesar's suspect? 
 It was the same as Saturn's felawe. 
 Our churl, and learning fifty cents
