The Current Is Blowing Along Your Soft Head 

 like a herrin! on my tongue. 
 I have been so lasted-- 
 No, remember these words like ashes 
 searching the line of dark. I swear 
 they were sleeping, sitting in a platter, 
 the road at least I can well say boojum, 
 now I'm ditches' I've got the gift 
 though I have climbed through books, 
 None of ten million dollars to the shutters 
 & rid of one world. Is it a waste
