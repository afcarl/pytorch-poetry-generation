Ille 

 in circles start to halt with its dying sunflower 
 I realize what I love was about. 
 
 I was just a girlfriend, should draw 
 combing one charlatan, hand inside. 
 Disturbed and snapping the Chaplain on pant 
 
 staring out by her ploughed chunks 
 glinting like a broken Golgotha 
 a bat sags with a gasoline 
 heart pressed like a year from her shoulders, 
 four thoughts from the body for my kiss. 
 When I went for the mosquito.
