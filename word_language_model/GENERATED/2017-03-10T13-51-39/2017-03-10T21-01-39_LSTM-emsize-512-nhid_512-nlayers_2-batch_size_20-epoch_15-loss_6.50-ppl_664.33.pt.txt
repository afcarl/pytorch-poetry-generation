Of My Breath; 

 Portals peeled by stone, the wildness of one muttered hightail 
 Blown out of the patio. Then in the upper cave 
 And voices that darkening the day, a seed fails, 
 Keep only back of the path an hour I am unable to shake it. 
 
 
 
 
 
 In the Metro Darkness in New York 
 
 
 And where I list, 
 Joying to invent to let 
 Man's song Tempo 
 I'll call you earth-soiled involving abused.
