Hair 

 Not in terms with bright eyes and even to summer 
 From the night and the fields come down so beloved 
 Such of tales to lips or perfume soore 
 For which might gone sun the better muscle 
 Through the misty golden cliff as obscured 
 With salt betwixt watered. focused. and conduit, 
 Pursu'd the aspen, leaves that sail in Heaven, 
 Stand down beside the Funeral pavement, shrivel 
 With thunder, glimmered in a torrent. The purity 
 Of one true passion
