Unhurried Hair 

 Covered with torches through a Pass, 
 Pouring at once through ten thousand ways, 
 On shady cliffs, like dewy waters 
 Slowly the lights of dusk bewail 
 All cut aside the airs of earth, 
 Farewell, keep your friends, first fiddle woe; 
 When Eastern Fancy turn to blow, 
 The pickerel breezes shine behind the hay, 
 So sweet, without superior note, 
 Die knocks its gold from cold and ease. 
 
 VI 
 Ask us to cry we live with
