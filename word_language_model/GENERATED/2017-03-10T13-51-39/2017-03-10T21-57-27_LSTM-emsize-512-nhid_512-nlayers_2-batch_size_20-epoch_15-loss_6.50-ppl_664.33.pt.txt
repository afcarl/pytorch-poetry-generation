Laughing? 

 What am the glory of the dying, 
 The way the musk-rose, 
 The owls on everything, 
 Till the evening thronged with the grandeur 
 And the cattle were swept Weg; 
 Nothing more serene than the rock 
 But if the grave were green as ours. 
 And when on beauty came in view 
 The quick bones ceased to declare, 
 posits so straight and trots 
 Out of the lake ladles, and proud, 
 Till the ripe fields flow, 
 So cold
