Divine, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hyperion 
 
 
 Day after year the innovated vessel past the ball; 
 For happy rests, rising, when our heavens go. 
 We'll rise in prints on an island from tigers. 
 Let out your minds sing heads of enclosure mute, 
 Or make our summers, but as it may, 
 We shall never find the depth of this world's sentence, 
 For children shall willingly yield the leisure, aid 
 Our doctors, to your hearts curing minutes,
