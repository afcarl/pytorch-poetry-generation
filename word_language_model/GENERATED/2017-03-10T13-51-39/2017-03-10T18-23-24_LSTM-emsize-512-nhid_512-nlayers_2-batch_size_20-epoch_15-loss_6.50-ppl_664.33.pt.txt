Eyes Toes, 

 nocturnes chambers like a flame, 
 Lives at the end of time in afterthought. 
 Whatever we feel like it and 
 And allow dim soul that there one another 
 For a long time, Ramses* that calls 
 hyer in distance, and may affect 
 This lonely sanctifies Uncle-cousins, bridle, ben 
 And walked into the darkness, and hold it closer, 
 As the bird cuts but the rustle and survives 
 Doth know the power of love shall yield, 
 
 And better
