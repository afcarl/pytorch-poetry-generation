 with sweet frowns from his memories, maker-- 
 "Quick! son de lover takes the whole landing, 
 greenery, if He gets ever snow, 
 and the question, taking gladness disparate 
 his tasks againe; what else moves to him

 i-95 walk from 
 a rattling lawn of silence, 
 worse spirit, I help you bless me: 
 my little shadow
