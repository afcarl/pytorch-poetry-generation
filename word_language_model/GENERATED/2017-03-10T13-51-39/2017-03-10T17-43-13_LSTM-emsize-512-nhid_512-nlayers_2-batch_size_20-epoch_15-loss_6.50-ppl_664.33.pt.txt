 By work, though not over disdain of time 
 Lauds for such a word are "Justin's 
 Others, alas, and taste them on the height 
 We turn to fill our hearts we overflow 
 The stumbling mass, and ancient dogs are! 
 The father damn pretending to move, 
 We wouldn't live too soon. For which 
 Did you think of what he happened, 
 Whenever he saw it? He had no work in prison brain? 
 As he drags off the eternity even now
