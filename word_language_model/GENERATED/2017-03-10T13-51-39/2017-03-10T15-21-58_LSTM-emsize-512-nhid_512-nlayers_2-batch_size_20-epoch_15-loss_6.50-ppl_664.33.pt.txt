Haunt A Bloody Kiss. 

 
 6 
 By supper I noticed with sighs of lilac. 
 O Satan and Chop the king of Nature! 
 Who yet can give cold earth to me. 
 And from the groves grow quaint and gray. 
 
 And in the eyes of light he flows, 
 The bridge goes on on backward Dacron 
 And evening went the heavy heath 
 That song and everlasting boons 
 Trembled from moss, to mark the clouds.
