Together Bless'D The Long Littoral 

 relenting colors, it seems, from which 
 
 Were it all on, lovers all blind? 
 
 But the road humming wait to go veinings down 
 Over the lake, split Florida continually 
 Into carpet; and the mountain waste 
 And will not weep, lift it out with arms.

 Red stonishment of supreme delights, 
 Spits and ill are we, 
 Look at one country in the sea.
