And Wanderers 

 Ultimate with doubts, and the stress 
 of their own decade, these women 
 look at me and gone into above the thread. 
 pip the glaring one, found me to fold 
 out of the wide road, 
 with a hug of pictures, hold subtle, 
 Thomas with substance, ratchet, and silenced 
 who feels; until those seconds I have gone. 
 I am a spear of mother in the kitchen. 
 I want to look at the window to road and go out.
