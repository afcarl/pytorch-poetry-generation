The Rest Of Life Or Art. 

 
 "I am caught out with the habits of men 
 in whom my people couldn't. How 
 can I feel together. 
 All that is holy, although then, 
 I never a glimpse of which I wait for teenage trace; 
 I am serious. Even if I have met it, and today, 
 I say something. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Nocturnal and the Lions 
 
 
 Pale, beads to prefigurations-- 
 their learn'd is floors;
