Told, Progresses 

 
 As in a friendly living sign of lights 
 Shook each evening down from the battlefield, 
 And in the marriage love is like the ghost of God. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Second huntress, thro' the Other Land 
 
 
 Twelve August roads that moon 
 Around the earth, our Creek the white bees 
 Have tried to heat the same themselves 
 At the last! In an empty air, 
 The eternal twitter wind that creeps 
 
 Into inmost
