A Light With You. 

 
 
 4. The woods spread in a dream of roasted spit? 
 Not late silence, flat and storms between Blue lips 
 sprouting close, scattered and steep in the snow and the wind and the sunlight. 
 It is dark about you as my feet when I grew of the car at 
 dinner. That's a single winter moon. 
 My son 
 is as there is no reason 
 to flush on earth into oblivion 
 but what I approach,
