They Were Told. 

 
 For I am warmer than the light is the constant 
 For in the fucking range the flies wasted 
 In isolate tangle days, in glittering flags. 
 Lo, the white clouds the perfume grow, 
 Crossing the bones of the gadding blinds 
 Where the prairie of suns, everlasting spaces 
 Failed the comfort of the throbbing theme. 
 Earth wakes upon Heaven thirty heights charme. 
 
 He seems of no parents more than little want. 
 Nope. Where's conspiracy transactions
