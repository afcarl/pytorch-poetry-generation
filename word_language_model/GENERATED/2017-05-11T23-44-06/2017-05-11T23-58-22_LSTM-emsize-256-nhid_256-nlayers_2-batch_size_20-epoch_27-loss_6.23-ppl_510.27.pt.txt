Anon Del Mastiff One He Bricks-- 

 wine: shame is another mercy 
 
 Of a sufficient hand to make a spark on her hands, 
 His hand else like some impulse from my brows 
 The young writer who builds it in his comb and 
 come home way blood points in state and thrashing 
 The anniversary snow, his eyes and gloves lazy, 
 Ashes pumps of his ass. 
 
 
 
 I hold the border from my Nature 
 Ice's glad leaf corrupted?
