Into The Afternoon, 

 until everything drops

 the daring of something suffer'd on, 
 surrounded by men.

 gleaming and yellow 
 wild knives, oceans and flowers. 
 Touch the suet and searing

 clapping our insistent marrow, 
 our checkered mothers 
 thinking about some lost heart, 
 but only thenk 
 could get the flag of such as fast 
 staring back for body and bone, 
 a piece
