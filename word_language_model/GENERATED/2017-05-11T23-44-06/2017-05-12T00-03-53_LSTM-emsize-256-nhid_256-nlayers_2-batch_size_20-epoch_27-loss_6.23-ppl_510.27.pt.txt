 
 The sky in the village sky-- 
 the varied shapes that unspeakable, 
 are the keys that oversaw 
 the narrow grave? Then I see how night 
 I rise, my home grave 
 dissolve a simple voice, a shakes pavement, 
 my pen streaming in heavy and ancient 
 battered as a Bertrans waterfall 
 washed slowly on its finger to its arm, 
 a single and full meet or not two. 
 My mouth earphones at my feet and shouts like prayers 
 in
