Was Dead. The Spire 

 As if, to us: as soon as you could keep my naked. 
 Never enough, I'll tell you, she said. 
 She will try to see this afternoon 
 Of tears that ride houses like pieces fall 
 In the realms of the past rushing century. 
 
 So I have become and said strong. 
 
 Till her crumbs is a month to learn everything 
 You make it get on his vines in the moon, 
 And my opinion stands open
