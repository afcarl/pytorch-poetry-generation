 Of holding, Presented shot. 
 And when everything began; 
 A week had been asleep. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Do IV. So woman-heart Trine, arrive 
 
 
 On the green lake 
 My hair has swallows everywhere 
 Noise strips of lime. 
 
 What winds divide behind us, 
 in many a sound of birth, 
 carry our load in its ear. 
 
 All night he pulls his wings 
 in his hat. 
 
 
 
 
 
 God Clavier
