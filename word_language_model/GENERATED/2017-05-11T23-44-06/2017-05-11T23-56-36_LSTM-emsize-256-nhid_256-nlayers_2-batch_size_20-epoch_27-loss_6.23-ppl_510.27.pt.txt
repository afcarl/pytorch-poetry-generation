 apartheid heart. pasteled 
 
 lost to fear it was only heart!) 
 I could barely see 
 The buried in heaven seems, 
 Yet I was not my gains 
 
 But I am 
 The low plow of pepper 
 On my left room I see good or rain 
 To the house of the river or actress, 
 You are with your voice at the time; 
 The ever-hooded, world's great nepenthe 
 And the flat beating of heart's guardians, 
 
 Wasn't this
