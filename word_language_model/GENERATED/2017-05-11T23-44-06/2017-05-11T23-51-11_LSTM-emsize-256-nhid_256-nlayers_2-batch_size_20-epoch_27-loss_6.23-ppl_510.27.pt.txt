 Beware that street 
 Though we still saw back valley to night 
 Come near with water & her hands â€” 
 As we pass against our yell 
 We heard the rustle of the garden 
 Moving in the moonbeams, road 
 in the ooze of the eternal light, 
 as in a room: to smart: 
 turkeys, simulacrum with sons; 
 not truth's sacrifice. And I will wear 
 the form of smallest, lead go up 
 with his robe thorough fallen ears
