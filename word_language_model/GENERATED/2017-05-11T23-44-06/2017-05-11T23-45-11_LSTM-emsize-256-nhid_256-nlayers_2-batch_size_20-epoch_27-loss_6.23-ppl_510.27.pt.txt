Far Away, 

 Save how Bed. 
 
 Farewell, how the youthful storms they keep, 
 Like middle children to armour? 
 
 Then in a flame, as women of their prey. 
 
 God! Love chanter of kings: I am "gone 
 But now, desire as doth the heavens may think; 
 Yet all my wishes they were appalled 
 To shed. There is no place to be 
 Even come where children pass, chill, and day, 
 With flame that stirs these graves are grasses.
