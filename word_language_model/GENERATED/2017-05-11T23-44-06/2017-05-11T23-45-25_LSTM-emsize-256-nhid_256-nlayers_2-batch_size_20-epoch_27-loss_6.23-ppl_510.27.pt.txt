 
 From the dresser to those draft 
 A disrobing; near the wall. 
 Suddenly glow, protonotary? 
 
 And over the beach, 
 staring sleeping at each other 
 than forty old flashes 
 from firelight, moneyed now, 
 like gold fruit garden raindrops 
 wanigean 
 through the speckled shadows 
 of asphalt we walked 
 from the names 
 of a dance 
 over a heap 
 
 of rain radios. 
 scriptorium, a score of wind 
 a silent crop . . .
