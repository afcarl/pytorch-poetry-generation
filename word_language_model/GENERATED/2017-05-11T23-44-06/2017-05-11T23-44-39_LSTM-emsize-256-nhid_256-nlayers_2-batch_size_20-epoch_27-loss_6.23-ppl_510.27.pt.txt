Love And Longed To Read 

 Such poetic moods as mercy drunk and stung, 
 And the murmur and the weight of things that filled the North, 
 As a scholar would with strong decay, 
 For what could actions', the Man and the treadmill clemency 
 To an inky dye we once met, and the beginning is undone. 
 
 The Children push the shutter, shadows on the brow; 
 They are enough; they have lost the same strike from their day; 
 But it isn't demurring
