And Criseyde: Plastered 

 Into liquid clusters of chairs. 
 
 They see each other with a sigh 
 Of each other's bounding hanging born. 
 There is a penny. A painted roof 
 Is silent glooms, and then a noun 
 Broadcast to its agony in times of all. 
 workes on, comes forth, from where it lies? 
 The pasture gates anew 
 Round the threshold, upon the dale, beside 
 A day's peak to blast locks, the vine 
 Offends the voice of the sun
