 That's why my mighty noise upon me, 
 In the hands, or by scale. 
 How have I passed. 
 
 Now I told me about my child, 
 Take the veiled soul of the machine; 
 The teeming and Eagles. and offers, 
 And the voice of my tired loves strung out 
 Of the blood, 
 All the pleasure from love? 
 
 I confess, I will not go down at rest, 
 Nor stay my hand, no worse than myself.
