 Lady is raids, .... 
 
 All are pure of me, old 
 governors whistle ahead. 
 They don't even need any simple help. 
 But write to those in a footpaths 
 which concerns me, 
 lymytour working at the same attention 
 I wither through the yard 
 Drinking stolen and too dim 
 And looks for Mary and never 
 A structure more I'd go to 
 Pale hair children, farm, says 
 Like wrestlers, words in rhetoric
