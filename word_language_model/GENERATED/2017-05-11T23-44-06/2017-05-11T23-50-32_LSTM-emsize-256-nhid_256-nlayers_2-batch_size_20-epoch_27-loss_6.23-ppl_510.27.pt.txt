So, When I Burst My Toothbrush To The Sky, 

 I see the ships for the lucky man ha' begun, 
 With bare eyes, which is full of cloud, trailing a cigarette, 
 I sit in bed by a Indian around 
 Supream of concern for ever 
 Number fire on Shoreham breast. 
 
 Another friend that God is wrong with me! 
 For when the man finishes the light that I know he was 
 To love the passion today she knows the best.
