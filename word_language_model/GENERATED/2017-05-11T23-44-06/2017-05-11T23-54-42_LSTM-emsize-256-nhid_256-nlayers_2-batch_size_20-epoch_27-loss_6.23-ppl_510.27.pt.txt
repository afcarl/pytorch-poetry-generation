 
 
 I'm the eleven I built with them, 
 tonight in my back shop, 
 forearm races, relentlessly 
 strikes its offices 
 in something to fall, starting 
 till something might have been 
 pushed into the skin. 
 The weakening air 
 was gotten into a composition 
 where I was, for comfort 
 my heart was driven, 
 like shadows, though I love her, 
 know nothing feeling only 
 will be expectations, but when 
 something in the stupor on bright moss
