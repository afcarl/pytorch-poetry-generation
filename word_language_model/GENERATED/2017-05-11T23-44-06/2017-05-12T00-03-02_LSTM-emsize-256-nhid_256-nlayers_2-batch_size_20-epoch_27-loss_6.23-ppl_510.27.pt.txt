The Ice-- 

 I whispered, two chase rocks 
 
 Under the underside of a loosened band 
 muted serene 
 Until in my luck I could run in. 
 --I missed them singing 
 They looked electronic as small 
 As the quiet world 
 The lurking fronts that explode 
 If to noticed the virgin 
 The Congo in themâ€” 
 Taking its hat, 
 
 Down your sheltered surf. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Melodious, 
 
 
 Over my shoulder broken meadow, and
