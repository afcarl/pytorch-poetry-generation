 From which the teeth wing up in the basks 
 Of bedtime I have made licenses, 
 And what such wants as they can feel. 
 
 
 
 Yet this isnâ€™t a graveyard 
 a clear place, the right hand 
 scattered above it water: 
 friends thumped, like chanted. 
 especially if it lies 
 in the back of poures, 
 it lays two windows, 
 black and black 
 on summer toure holes 
 
 scanning a cloud, in slow sparks 
 burning each
