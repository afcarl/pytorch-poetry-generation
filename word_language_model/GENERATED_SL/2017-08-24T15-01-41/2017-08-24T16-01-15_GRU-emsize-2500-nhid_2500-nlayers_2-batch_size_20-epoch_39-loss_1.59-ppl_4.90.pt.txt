Not a violence, for a revisionism. It is not something that is
highly already there, but in which life is impossible to
already keep what it is. In its own sense, what is compelled in
what is after.     This is what makes art and Forsythe denies
the poetic sense of the future, albeit of sink, recollection.
This is what we speak of what microperceptual as Walter Benjamin
calls just a rub in the present before the present matter.
