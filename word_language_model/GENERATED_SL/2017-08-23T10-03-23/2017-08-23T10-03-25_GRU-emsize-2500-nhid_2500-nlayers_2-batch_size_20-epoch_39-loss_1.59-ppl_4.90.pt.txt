November 1989: Temporally. It Is Flourish Of The No Relentless, From Surface
To Which It Is Not To Actual Cognizable, But Yet Not Yet Veered Into An Event
From. It Is The Case Of Bronze Not Segmented, The Body Itself That While. This
Movement Is On The Cusp Of Its Subjection, Is A Baroque In Its â€œTentative A Potential
For Relation That Moves The Body Before Grows At The Center Of The Rainbows? The Contrasts
Fail Paradoxically, To The Present Projector. It Is Not To Resolve The Movement
