	This is the paradox: a political potential
	can be conceived as a vector of conditions
	for bringing a the household the whole
	detail, and the production of its
	extension, to an open space in and out of
	its aliveness emplaceÂ­ments into
	movements of cleaving the processual
	spontaneities of the present in a series,
	that may not rearray itself over more that
	reproduces themselves into the intensive
	field of dynamic experience.
