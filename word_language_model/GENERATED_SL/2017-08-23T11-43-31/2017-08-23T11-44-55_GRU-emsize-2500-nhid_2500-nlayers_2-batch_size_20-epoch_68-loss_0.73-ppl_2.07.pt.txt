Operations and accumulation.     This is not a metaphor. It is
this idea that the event continues to be launched in its own way
that it is better.     A thesis that seems to be a problem in
the sense that it is not concerned with the human sense. It is
in what with the virtual dimension. And with the senses at which
it is in the process of an image and it makes it nowhere it is
not as a function in the event.
