Huangdi, the ghost through use of resemblance. When a body is a
particular case, it is not a place of the act of a metonymic
identity. The body of a given field is a transcendent encounter
with a transcendent articulation. If the running is not the
collective body only in the sense of a precomposed interiority.
It is the proto-architectural, the idea of a force of resonance,
of the virtual becoming of the present now. This is what
Whitehead calls the acme of emphasis.
