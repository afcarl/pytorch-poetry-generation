This is not a justification. It is a general whose unity is an
immanent task. The same is not a compulsion. The kind of new
media dedicates a new political annexation to the level of the
being-body, in excess of its in-formation. It is always in a
doing that it can be taken beyond the body as a stable system,
as the tendency of immanent to relational movement. In its
inventiveness, it is the capacity, that we are not foreclosed by
the anarchy of the body.
