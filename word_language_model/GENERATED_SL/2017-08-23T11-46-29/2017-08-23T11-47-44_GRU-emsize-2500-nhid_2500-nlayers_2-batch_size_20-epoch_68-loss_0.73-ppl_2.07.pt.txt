In the the body the subject and its many are pauses between the
two poles are one: their mutual inclusion is the same as the
event. The self-abstraction of difference is the affective
tonality of the event, from which the field of experience is
taken up in absolute amodal forms, would it pass. What the body
is always is in a relation to the appearance of the as-yet-
unformed rather than it as the form of a dynamic form.
