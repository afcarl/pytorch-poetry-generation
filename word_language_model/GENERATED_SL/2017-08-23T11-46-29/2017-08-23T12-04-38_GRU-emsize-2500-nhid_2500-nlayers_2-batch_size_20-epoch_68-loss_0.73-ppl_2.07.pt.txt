What is not the transmissible of an individual body, but a
perception of a collective expression this is.     This happens
the with a concept of the fifth 7â€“9. The idea is not a sensing-
with that reaches toward nothingness and its anxious sound as a
hearing. But there is always a now which is never quite there.
This is a fold of the virtual from which of relational
perception in the making, of the object. The symbolism takes the
form of the event.
