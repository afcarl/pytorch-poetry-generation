Of the technique as that which shifts that certain beat not as a
subject or the form as the invisiblebut-palpable surface of the
ineffable coursing through experience.     The virtual becoming,
not as human but the force of life is felt. It takes the body of
an actual place, as it is of a dialectic and multiplicity that
moves relation. It is no longer to ally matter-form and we in
this body.
