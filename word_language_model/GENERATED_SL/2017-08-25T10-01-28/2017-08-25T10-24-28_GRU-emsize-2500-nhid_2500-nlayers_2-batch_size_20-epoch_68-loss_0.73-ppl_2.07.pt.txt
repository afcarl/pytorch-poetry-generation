Misunderstanding of the interconnections and the body does not
take place from a particular idea of this body. The life is
always under and with the movements of the eventâ€™s virtual that
is, it is its potential to subjective form. What is felt is the
manner of activity of events, taking form.     Politicality is
not the element of the body per se.
