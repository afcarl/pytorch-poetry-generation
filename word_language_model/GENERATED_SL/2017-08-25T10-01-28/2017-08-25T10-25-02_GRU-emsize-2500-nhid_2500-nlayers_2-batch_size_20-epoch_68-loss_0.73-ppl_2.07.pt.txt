I do not think of the body as a body. It is in this way that
we are already afraid. We are not referring to the swarm of
which we are working in an object. We are talking about the
manner in which the body carries its emergence. We have an
object to which it has disrupts the relation in which we
experience to generate a qualitative space of form.
