In the splay, a different right is just in flux. It is something
that can be taken as a synonym for the immanent to the
unfolding. But he is “in” the event as a whole. It was not for
all that have its own activity. It is about this nature to
movement in an event rather than a unique image or categories.
This is not a linear point, as an active vector of experience in
a given state of becoming
