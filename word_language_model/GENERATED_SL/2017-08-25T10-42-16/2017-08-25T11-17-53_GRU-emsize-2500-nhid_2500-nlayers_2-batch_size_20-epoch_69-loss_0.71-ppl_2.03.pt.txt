What I am suggesting is that affect is the field of immanence
that qualitatively can be felt in relation to the field of its
outside, as it is to be in the larger field of bare activity. In
this painting, everything the body is individuated at the touch
â€“ but through no modality of potential is always in which
measurement exceeds itself.
