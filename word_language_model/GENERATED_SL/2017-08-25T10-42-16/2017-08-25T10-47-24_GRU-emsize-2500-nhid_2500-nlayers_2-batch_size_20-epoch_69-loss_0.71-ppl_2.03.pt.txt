Repeatability, as opposed to the exteroception of sensory
elements, to the composition of an intrinsic cause, that breeds
a gait of a body that is not established, but in the world
itself always in order to return in the movement to the
unknowable as it invents through the unfathomable. It activates
the relational force in the more than what it is of
amplifications and viral.
