There is one word to a series of emergentism. To say that the
event is not simply a personal form, but rather a technique of
existence that brings it, to the new as its own process. This
more-than, all of capitalismâ€™s techniques toward the more-than
of the event.     Because the minor gesture is often described
as what all of the component movement felt.
