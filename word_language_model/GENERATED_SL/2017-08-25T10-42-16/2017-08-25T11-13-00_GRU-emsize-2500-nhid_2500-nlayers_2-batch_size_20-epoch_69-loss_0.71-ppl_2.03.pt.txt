But the movement is not necessarily a beginning. It is a
cleavage, a movement that cuts back into the water, a movement
that vectorizes the event to the genre. This force of the event
cannot be at the mercy of repetition-in-duration in a way that
takes place into a plethora of other bodies whose power is to be
invented.     The paradox is one of the form.
