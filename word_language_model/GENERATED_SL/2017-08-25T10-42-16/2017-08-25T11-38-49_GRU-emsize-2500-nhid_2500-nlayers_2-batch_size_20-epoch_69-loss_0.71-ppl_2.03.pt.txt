Infinitum. The individual or only are created in a way that is
not a definite but whose fully the event is the force of the
perceptibility of its actualization. We feel this paradox of
that idea of the virtual as an object of the process. The
event in its preindividual is as an experience of potential
foreclosing to the experiential potential of its potential to be
invented.
