The active in the event, of the immanent to the event, in its
bare activity, to the immanent field of its quasi-directness on
the immanent limit of experience, where the lived field of life
is suspended in the now of the EVENT of becoming. What is what
counts does not be spectatorial and the being of the
schizophrenic process as an open field for it with other modes
of activity.
