A locality is a gathering, a sign that joins elements in a
future-past, a desire in the making.     This is a crucial
point: the concept of the body in its worlds: what is at stake
is not this stable entity. It is about the limbs? It is the
experience of the bodyâ€™s relational potential, it is not an
direct experience of the body.
