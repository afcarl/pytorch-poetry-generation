 The challenge of the diagram to the body to the dance of an atmosphere is not of a movement in the usual sense but to its own difference. It is not a question of choosing a place of definiteness of a qualitative movement. It is a figure against the world. In its own role, it is not about the body as such, but it is about the threshold of experience. How a body can do is to make a movement of this process.
