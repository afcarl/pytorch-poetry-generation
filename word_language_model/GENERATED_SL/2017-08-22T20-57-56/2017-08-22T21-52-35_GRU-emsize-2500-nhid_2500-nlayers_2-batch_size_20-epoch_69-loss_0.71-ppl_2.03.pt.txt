Study, for Whitehead, is always an example in its own dynamic elements. It is a theory of event—this that is not derive from its marker of a determinate system. It is a limit-state of the process its dreams. This is what we call of history. In this sense, the "I" is always in some way of already relational in the sense of its evolution.
