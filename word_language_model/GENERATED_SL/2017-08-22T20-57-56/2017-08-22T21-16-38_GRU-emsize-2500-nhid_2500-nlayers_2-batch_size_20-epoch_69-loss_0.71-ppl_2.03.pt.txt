Of The Gateway That For Making It Is A Sense Of A Concept That The Event Facilitates Its Capacity To Generate The Conditions For Its Own Activating The Event. What It Is In This Way Is It Cannot Be Reduced To The Physical. It Has Not To Be An Activity Of How It Has To Be “Of” And To Reinvent This Event. What Is At Stake Is The Radical Philosophy. This Requires What Whitehead Calls The Superject, And The Subject Of Existence To The Experience Of The Individual.
