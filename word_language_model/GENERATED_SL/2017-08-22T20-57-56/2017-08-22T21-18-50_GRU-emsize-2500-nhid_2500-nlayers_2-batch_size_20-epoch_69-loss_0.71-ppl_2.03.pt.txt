The Movement Of The Curve Is Itself In The Service Of Our Attention. It Is Not An End In The Form Of A Subject. It Is The Relational Expression Of The Associated Milieu Of Relation, That Inflects Its Own Event. It Is Not About A Subject That Is In The Sense Of Language: Even As The Event That Is In The One Sense We Do Was Of The Event. What Is Being In This Way On The Field Of The Other, At The Limit Of Its Own Tendencies.
