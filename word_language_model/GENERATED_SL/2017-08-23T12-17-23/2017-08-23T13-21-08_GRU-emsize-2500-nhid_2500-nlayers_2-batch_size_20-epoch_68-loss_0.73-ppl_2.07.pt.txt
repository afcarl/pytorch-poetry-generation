The force of life is always described as in some way of be
parallel from the movement to a process. This process is what
gives space for the capitalist of the subject. What is the idea
of this object is is a pulling out of the differential in the
nowness of the event. It is always more than the feeling of the
potential at the same time as it is what brings beyond the
virtual as the event.
