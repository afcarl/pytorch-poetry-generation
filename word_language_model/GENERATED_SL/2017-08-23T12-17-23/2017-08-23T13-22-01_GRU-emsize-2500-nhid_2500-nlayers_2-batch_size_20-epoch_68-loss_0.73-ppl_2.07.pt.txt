    A politics self-constructed thinkingdoing can be seen as a
meeting-place of its diff√©rance. It is not as a question of a
history of the foundation. It is a collective availing of the
transcendent and the objective. It is in this same way: as
reproduction of a predesignated Body and discourse. The
architectural is often that the Nos. As a place of the design
process does not fade into play. It is making the viewer for the
relational field again.
