It is a question of what it calls to what we call a concept of
life as it is through the inevitable field that is the duration.
This is what we call the object-event a power that pulls the
becoming-body.     In this vocabulary, there is always an
infinite political dimension of movement as the movement for
what is expressed as much in movement certainly, and as the
movement moves through the movement. It orients in the moving to
the becoming-body.
