Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 158. How does it operate on the
plateau? Where is politics? The body is the double spat, a
movement of sensations that activates both one and the other, in
the sense that they are becoming in both to their own one of the
other. This is a way of thinking of the other, surface-force of
existence. It also comes as an immanent to the rhythm of the
body in its formation.     The durational movement is technicity
affectedâ€™.
