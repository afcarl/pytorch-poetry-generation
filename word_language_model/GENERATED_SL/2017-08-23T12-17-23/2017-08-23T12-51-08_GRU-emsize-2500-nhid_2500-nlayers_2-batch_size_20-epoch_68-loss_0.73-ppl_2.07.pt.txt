movement as a qualitative peripersonal.. It seems to me that
of experience comes to the fore. The prosthetic gesture is a
more sensitive action to arises through the relational force of
a tendency to the personality. It is a question of whatâ€™s that
the body has sketched in the circumstances, opening it to its
determination, for thinking-feeling that is not to reflective
the movement of this or that.
