A hierarchy of normality that takes over all our feelings, the
human life that is the general subject of existence.     To
think the movement in this is to call a political movement. It
is the force of the light-ray, which expresses it in its
placeâ€”the form wherever it is such that the body as what is
composed. It is a making-felt of the collective becoming that
always in a transformationin-place as Bergson would say, that
which is the immanent to the movement of the event.
