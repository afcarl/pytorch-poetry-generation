the movement is only an activating of the emergent field. This
is not a case of Pierre or reproduction, but on the quality of
a life into the field of life: in every time that is their
hinge.     The challenge is always about different modes of
existence that are both cut-and-dried starting and controlled
duplicity, that terror and philosphy is very different and as an
event.
