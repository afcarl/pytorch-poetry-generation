Is a mobile force that allows the event to express its potential
only characteristics in a way that is always applied to what it
calls the overform of the past in its unfolding. Gesture here
has been restored. The country for this has to do with the force
of this potentials for the event at the same time as it can be
separated out from the many of its potential parts. Thinking-
feelings are also re-problematized. They are instantaneous to
call out the relational field of their immanent event.
