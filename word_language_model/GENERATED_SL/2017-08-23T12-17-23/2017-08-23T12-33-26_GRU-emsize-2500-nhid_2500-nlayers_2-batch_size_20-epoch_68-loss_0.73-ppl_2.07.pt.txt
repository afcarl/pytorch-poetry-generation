As Whitehead might say, they say, is not through the movement of
the body but in its so-called affective effects.     For Parisi,
there is always a trace of engendering. The body is not ending
in its productive departure or the mimetic elements of
structuration. It is not the force of the body to the frame,
scale and its an image may of an active-passive extraelement but
rather an affective tone that cannot be contained in its
interdependency.
