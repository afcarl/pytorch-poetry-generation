This are as important as we are are castaways. What is the body
is the uniÔ¨Åcation of timed perceptions. It is the variable that
its relation does not actually as a physical past but as an
affective spatial order envelope. The time of the body is one
body and its body. It can be tempting to hold that bodies on
what it can do.     In a way it makes a body emerges. It is not
a question of the body, but of the topological becoming-body.
