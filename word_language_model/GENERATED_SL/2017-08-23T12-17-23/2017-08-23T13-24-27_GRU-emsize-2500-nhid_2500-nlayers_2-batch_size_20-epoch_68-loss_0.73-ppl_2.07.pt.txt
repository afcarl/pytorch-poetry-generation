As much: the divergence is not to given a field of relation but
in the event's resonance to the transmutational force of
experience. If this is to say that a flux is still entirely to
be found in this a rift between the past and the body nor the
future. This is a tenacious misunderstanding of traditional
theory and radical issues.     The question of a relationship to
the work and what makes it the event is the in-bracing of
becoming coming in its as rhythm.
