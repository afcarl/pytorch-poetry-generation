In its potential to be on the most a relational body that is the
“event-dimension” of potential potential (Massumi 2002a, 125).
Desire is the point of the more-than.     The in-between, as
Deleuze explains:   is a movement, the event is a prehensive
carnal, the thisness of experience in the making. A body is
always this as such, it has not yet been apace with the world
and in the world, from the multiplicity of its becoming to
itself.
