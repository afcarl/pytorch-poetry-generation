advance. This is the same question that the following-through of
a relational apparatus and at its qualitative limit is a certain
kind of becoming, in its overfullness with new affection.... And
lofts are always at the heart of the field of perishing. Where
the body is always in its sense and the force of the moving-with
that memory and makes it unfelt.
