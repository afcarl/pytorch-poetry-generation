    A new event is at once in the heart of the event’s
unfolding, and its unfolding, its speculative infinity. What is
not its visible per se but its potential as always, to occur in
the incipience of the event’s coming to its taking-form. The
object is not its becoming a concrescence. It is an event’s
force, not the force of the event, but as the event’s coming
into itself. What we feel is the force, the event’s capacity to
expression.
