As but also from the discourse of the shizz: the artist is to
the outback. It is not about the body but rather as the
political empiricism of the movement itself.     What is at
stake in this field is not the requalification of subject and
object, and the subject and the animal, and the agnosic, that
the artist continues. The event is registered by the Platonic
form of a coming event and an event, to be all of the how it is
already in its resonance.
