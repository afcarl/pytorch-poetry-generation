I have been out of prison for nearly twenty years.
It is my understanding that when freed from all legal restraint than an application to have my civil rights restored would hence by the last agency to have jurisdiction over me when freed from such restraint would make automatic application for me.
This was some twelve years ago, when I was freed from probation.
I still can not vote as I and most ex convicts would vote Democrate, and as undoubtedly you the reader of this vote Republican.
Still I would seek an expedition of this omission as I am getting no younger.
As to why I can't vote other than you all ready know how we would vote seems like a violation of the voting rights act.
Why would you people vote for a man who's not even from Florida is beyond all thought and reason or logic.
Also as I was raped over a hundred times when in prison last.
I have never recovered.
 
With the up most respect, 
I remain, 
your obedient servant, 

is it poetry
