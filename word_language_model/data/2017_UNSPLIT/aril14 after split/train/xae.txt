New England fields I see,
The lovely, cultured landscape, waving grain,
Wide haughty rivers, and pale, English skies.
And lo! a farmer ploughing busily,
Who lifts a swart face, looks upon the plain,-
I see, in his frank eyes,

The hero's soul appear.
Thus in the common fields and streets they stand;
The light that on the past and distant gleams,
They cast upon the present and the near,
With antique virtues from some mystic land,
Of knightly deeds and dreams. 

There are heroes
and there are zeros.
Man & woman serving their country
& maker.
Thieves, murders try to fit.
But they are zeroes.
Freedom passes like a gas in
the night.
Light & airy.
Scary but not taken lightly.
A road not likely taken.
As the children sing songs of
fredom.
What is free? 
What is to be? 
Cree, Their Credo served.
Swerved as the winds of the day
blind their sight.
Taken back to the Old Traditional vows.
Heroes & zeroes shared one common plight.
(contin.)There are some different heroes.
They do not exist in the books of history
and very few people speak about them.
There are some heroes that they fight with death every day.
They know very well the value of life, living, death.
There are some heroes that they get the medal of honor of life.
They are the neighbors of the next country, the next city, the next house. 
The heroes next door. 

Consecrated to the Glorious Memory of His 
Most Serene and Renowned Highness, Oliver,
Written After the Celebration of his Funeral 


And now 'tis time; for their officious haste, 
Who would before have borne him to the sky, 
Like eager Romans ere all rites were past 
Did let too soon the sacred eagle fly. 

Though our best notes are treason to his fame 
Join'd with the loud applause of public voice; 
Since Heav'n, what praise we offer to his name, 
Hath render'd too authentic by its choice; 

Though in his praise no arts can liberal be, 
Since they whose Muses have the highest flown 
Add not to his immortal memory, 
But do an act of friendship to their own; 

Yet 'tis our duty and our interest too 
Such monuments as we can build to raise, 
Lest all the world prevent what we should do 
And claim a title in him by their praise. 

How shall I then begin, or where conclude 
To draw a fame so truly circular? 
For in a round what order can be shew'd, 
Where all the parts so equal perfect are? 

His grandeur he deriv'd from Heav'n alone, 
For he was great ere fortune made him so, 
And wars like mists that rise against the sun 
Made him but greater seem, not greater grown. 

No borrow'd bays his temples did adorn, 
But to our crown he did fresh jewels bring. 
Nor was his virtue poison'd soon as born 
With the too early thoughts of being king. 

Fortune (that easy mistress of the young 
But to her ancient servant coy and hard) 
Him at that age her favorites rank'd among 
When she her best-lov'd Pompey did discard. 

He, private, mark'd the faults of others' sway, 
And set as sea-marks for himself to shun, 
Not like rash monarchs who their youth betray 
By acts their age too late would wish undone. 

And yet dominion was not his design; 
We owe that blessing not to him but Heaven, 
Which to fair acts unsought rewards did join, 
Rewards that less to him than us were given. 

Our former chiefs like sticklers of the war 
First sought t'inflame the parties, then to poise, 
The quarrel lov'd, but did the cause abhor, 
And did not strike to hurt but make a noise. 

War, our consumption, was their gainfull trade; 
We inward bled whilst they prolong'd our pain; 
He fought to end our fighting and assay'd 
To stanch the blood by breathing of the vein. 

Swift and resistless through the land he pass'd 
Like that bold Greek who did the east subdue, 
And made to battles such heroic haste 
As if on wings of victory he flew. 

He fought secure of fortune as of fame, 
Till by new maps the island might be shown, 
Of conquests which he strew'd where'er he came 
Thick as a galaxy with stars is sown. 

His palms, though under weights they did not stand, 
Still thriv'd; no winter could his laurels fade; 
Heav'n in his portrait shew'd a workman's hand 
And drew it perfect yet without a shade. 

Peace was the prize of all his toils and care, 
Which war had banish'd and did now restore; 
Bologna's walls thus mounted in the air 
To seat themselves more surely than before. 

Her safety rescu'd Ireland to him owes, 
And treacherous Scotland, to no int'rest true, 
Yet bless'd that fate which did his arms dispose 
Her land to civilize as to subdue. 

Nor was he like those stars which only shine 
When to pale mariners they storms portend; 
He had his calmer influence, and his mien 
Did love and majesty together blend. 

'Tis true, his count'nance did imprint an awe, 
And naturally all souls to his did bow, 
As wands of divination downward draw 
And points to beds where sov'reign gold doth grow. 

When past all offerings to Feretrian Jove, 
He Mars depos'd and arms to gowns made yield; 
Successful councils did him soon approve 
As fit for close intrigues as open field. 

To suppliant Holland he vouchsaf'd a peace, 
Our once bold rival in the British main, 
Now tamely glad her unjust claim to cease 
And buy our friendship with her idol, gain. 

Fame of th' asserted sea through Europe blown 
Made France and Spain ambitious of his love; 
Each knew that side must conquer he would own, 
And for him fiercely as for empire strove. 

No sooner was the Frenchman's cause embrac'd 
Than the light monsieur the grave don outweigh'd; 
His fortune turn'd the scale where it was cast, 
Though Indian mines were in the other laid. 

When absent, yet we conquer'd in his right, 
For though some meaner artist's skill were shown 
In mingling colours, or in placing light, 
Yet still the fair designment was his own. 

For from all tempers he could service draw; 
The worth of each with its alloy he knew, 
And as the confidant of Nature saw 
How she complexions did divide and brew. 

Or he their single virtues did survey 
By intuition in his own large breast, 
Where all the rich ideas of them lay, 
That were the rule and measure to the rest. 

When such heroic virtue Heav'n sets out, 
The stars like Commons sullenly obey, 
Because it drains them when it comes about, 
And therefore is a tax they seldom pay. 

From this high spring our foreign conquests flow, 
Which yet more glorious triumphs do portend, 
Since their commencement to his arms they owe, 
If springs as high as fountains may ascend. 

He made us freemen of the continent 
Whom Nature did like captives treat before, 
To nobler preys the English lion sent, 
And taught him first in Belgian walks to roar. 

That old unquestion'd pirate of the land, 
Proud Rome, with dread the fate of Dunkirk heard, 
And trembling wish'd behind more Alps to stand, 
Although an Alexander were here guard. 

By his command we boldly cross'd the line 
And bravely fought where southern stars arise, 
We trac'd the far-fetch'd gold unto the mine 
And that which brib'd our fathers made our prize. 

Such was our prince; yet own'd a soul above 
The highest acts it could produce to show: 
Thus poor mechanic arts in public move 
Whilst the deep secrets beyond practice go. 

Nor di'd he when his ebbing fame went less, 
But when fresh laurels courted him to live; 
He seem'd but to prevent some new success, 
As if above what triumphs earth could give. 

His latest victories still thickest came, 
As near the center motion does increase, 
Till he, press'd down by his own weighty name, 
Did, like the vestal, under spoils decrease. 

But first the ocean as a tribute sent 
That giant prince of all her watery herd, 
And th' isle when her protecting genius went 
Upon his obsequies loud sighs conferr'd. 

No civil broils have since his death arose, 
But faction now by habit does obey, 
And wars have that respect for his repose, 
As winds for halycons when they breed at sea. 

His ashes in a peaceful urn shall rest; 
His name a great example stands to show 
How strangely high endeavours may be blest, 
Where piety and valour jointly go. 

The brazen winds 
Swipe across the sea of mint
Opening the bizarre night of sin
Leaving no hint
To inject a hallmark of link
Deep into the vein
Germinating heroin
In reign
Watery mouth drippin’ 
Downs the chin
Eyes closing in 
The curtain of silver screen
Rushes of adrenalin
Parting your brain 
In between
This is not the scene
You want it to be seen
It’s a hell of ruin
Once get hooked, your life is grinned
You’ll never win




I want to dedicate this piece to one of our member, 
Mr. Jon London. He have had experienced
the journey of highways to hell.

Best Wishes.
Sulaiman Mohd Yusof


Why do we care so much about how we look? 
There are so many people who worry about
their futures and forget to live life.
Too many people care about how much money they make, 
how many titles describe their name, 
and how many people they have had sex with.
There are way too many worries to list on paper
but these are definitely a few trivial ones.
People secretly want to be elitists.
They want to be thought of as being important.
This is our deep selfishness flooding out into every
action that we commit even if it is an action that 
may be helping others unselfishly.
The day we commit actions without pity
and without self gain is the day that love 
will show us the light on how to truly live.
We have to learn how to love first before we
try to commit great acts of heroism. 
Because then it is not heroism it is selfishness.
Are these acts committed because you see the good in them
or are they committed so that people can see the good in you

Ruby wine is drunk by knaves,
Sugar spends to fatten slaves,
Rose and vine-leaf deck buffoons;
Thunder-clouds are Jove's festoons,
Drooping oft in wreaths of dread,
Lightning-knotted round his head;
The hero is not fed on sweets,
Daily his own heart he eats;
Chambers of the great are jails,
And head-winds right for royal sails. 

There was a time when aetna's silent fire
Slept unperceived, the mountain yet entire;
When, conscious of no danger from below,
She tower'd a cloud-capt pyramid of snow.
No thunders shook with deep intestine sound
The blooming groves that girdled her around.
Her unctuous olives, and her purple vines
(Unfelt the fury of those bursting mines)
The peasant's hopes, and not in vain, assured,
In peace upon her sloping sides matured.
When on a day, like that of the last doom,
A conflagration labouring in her womb,
She teem’d and heaved with an infernal birth,
That shook the circling seas and solid earth.
Dark and voluminous the vapours rise,
And hang their horrors in the neighbouring skies,
While through the Stygian veil, that blots the day,
In dazzling streaks the vivid lightnings play.
But oh! what muse, and in what powers of song,
Can trace the torrent as it burns along?
Havoc and devastation in the van,
It marches o’er the prostrate works of man;
Vines, olives, herbage, forests disappear,
And all the charms of a Sicilian year.
Revolving seasons, fruitless as they pass,
See it an uninform’d and idle mass;
Without a soil to invite the tiller’s care,
Or blade that might redeem it from despair.
Yet time at length (what will not time achieve?)
Clothes it with earth, and bids the produce live.
Once more the spiry myrtle crowns the glade,
And ruminating flocks enjoy the shade.
O bliss precarious, and unsafe retreats,
O charming Paradise of shortlived sweets!
The self-same gale that wafts the fragrance round
Brings to the distant ear a sullen sound:
Again the mountain feels the imprison’d foe,
Again pours ruin on the vale below.
Ten thousand swains the wasted scene deplore,
That only future ages can restore.
Ye monarchs, whom the lure of honour draws,
Who write in blood the merits of your cause,
Who strike the blow, then plead your own defence,
Glory your aim, but justice your pretence;
Behold in AEtna’s emblematic fires
The mischiefs your ambitious pride inspires!
Fast by the stream that bounds your just domain,
And tells you where you have a right to reign,
A nation dwells, not envious of your throne,
Studious of peace, their neighbour’s and their own.
Ill-fated race! how deeply must they rue
Their only crime, vicinity to you!
The trumpet sounds, your legions swarm abroad,
Through the ripe harvest lies their destined road;
At every step beneath their feet they tread
The life of multitudes, a nation’s bread!
Earth seems a garden in its loveliest dress
Before them, and behind a wilderness.
Famine, and Pestilence, her firstborn son,
Attend to finish what the sword begun;
And echoing praises, such as fiends might earn,
And folly pays, resound at your return.
A calm succeeds—but Plenty, with her train
Of heartfelt joys, succeeds not soon again:
And years of pining indigence must show
What scourges are the gods that rule below.
Yet man, laborious man, by slow degrees
(Such is his thirst of opulence and ease),
Plies all the sinews of industrious toil,
Gleans up the refuse of the general spoil,
Rebuilds the towers that smoked upon the plain,
And the sun gilds the shining spires again.
Increasing commerce and reviving art
Renew the quarrel on the conqueror’s part;
And the sad lesson must be learn’d once more,
That wealth within is ruin at the door.
What are ye, monarchs, laurell’d heroes, say,
But aetnas of the suffering world ye sway?
Sweet Nature, stripp’d of her embroider’d robe,
Deplores the wasted regions of her globe;
And stands a witness at Truth’s awful bar,
To prove you there destroyers as ye are.
O place me in some heaven-protected isle,
Where Peace, and Equity, and Freedom smile;
Where no volcano pours his fiery flood,
No crested warrior dips his plume in blood;
Where Power secures what Industry has won:
Where to succeed is not to be undone;
A land that distant tyrants hate in vain,
In Britain’s isle, beneath a George’s reign. 

The only heroism I envy
is that of the rooster.
Ready to die for his female folk. 

Remnants of a clash -show
On the highway to HE's office 
Sobbing silently all over in disarray 
Are the teargas canisters
Broken artificial limbs
Placards, banners and boards
Clutches and pieces of rags 

Beaten heroes on stretchers 
Reminiscing immediate past 
against distant past of theirs
Reflect, heroes laid down are luckier

While general masses glue their eyes 
To TV screens of popular channels
Being inquisitive of, if not anything else
What why and how it happened
Ex-war heroes' kith and kin 
Rush ‘n Assemble in accident wards
Attending to needs of their breadwinners
Of heroism, being condemned


On the sea and at the Hogue, sixteen hundred ninety two,
Did the English fight the French,--woe to France!
And, the thirty-first of May, helter-skelter thro' the blue.
Like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue,
Came crowding ship on ship to St. Malo on the Rance, 
With the English fleet in view.

'Twas the squadron that escaped, with the victor in full chase;
First and foremost of the drove, in his great ship, Damfreville;
Close on him fled, great and small,
Twenty-two good ships in all; 
And they signalled to the place
'Help the winners of a race!
Get us guidance, give us harbor, take us quick--or, quicker still,
Here's the English can and will!'

Then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leapt on board;
'Why, what hope or chance have ships like these to pass?' laughed they:
'Rocks to starboard, rocks to port, all the passage scarred and scored,
Shall the '_Formidable_' here, with her twelve and eighty guns
Think to make the river-mouth by the single narrow way,
Trust to enter where 'tis ticklish for a craft of twenty tons, 
And with flow at full beside?
Now 'tis slackest ebb of tide.
Reach the mooring? Rather say,
While rock stands or water runs,
Not a ship will leave the bay!'

Then was called a council straight.
Brief and bitter the debate:
'Here's the English at our heels; would you have them take in tow
All that's left us of the fleet, linked together stern and bow,
For a prize to Plymouth Sound? 
Better run the ships aground!'
(Ended Damfreville his speech).
Not a minute more to wait!
'Let the Captains all and each
Shove ashore, then blow up, burn the vessels on the beach!
France must undergo her fate.

'Give the word!' But no such word
Was ever spoke or heard;
For up stood, for out stepped, for in struck amid all these
--A Captain? A Lieutenant? A Mate--first, second, third? 
No such man of mark, and meet
With his betters to compete!
But a simple Breton sailor pressed by Tourville for the fleet, 
A poor coasting-pilot he, Herve Riel the Croisickese. 

And, 'What mockery or malice have we here?' cries Herve Riel:
'Are you mad, you Malouins ? Are you cowards, fools, or rogues? 
Talk to me of rocks and shoals, me who took the soundings, tell
On my fingers every bank, every shallow, every swell
'Twixt the offing here and Greve where the river disembogues?
Are you bought by English gold? Is it love the lying's for? 
Morn and eve, night and day,
Have I piloted your bay,
Entered free and anchored fast at the foot of Solidor.
Burn the fleet and ruin France? That were worse than fifty Hogues!
Sirs, they know I speak the truth! Sirs, believe me there's a way!
Only let me lead the line,
Have the biggest ship to steer,
Get this '_Formidable_' clear,
Make the others follow mine,
And I lead them, most and least, by a passage I know well, 
Right to Solidor past Greve,
And there lay them safe and sound;
And if one ship misbehave,
--Keel so much as grate the ground.
Why, I've nothing but my life,--here's my head!' cries Herve Riel.

Not a minute more to wait.
'Steer us in then, small and great!
Take the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!' cried its chief.
Captains, give the sailor place!
He is Admiral, in brief. 

See the noble fellow's face
As the big ship, with a bound,
Clears the entry like a hound,
Keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide sea's profound!
See, safe thro' shoal and rock,
How they follow in a flock,
Not a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that grates the ground,
Not a spar that comes to grief!
The peril, see, is past, 
All are harboured to the last,
And just as Herve Kiel hollas 'Anchor!'--sure as fate
Up the English come, too late!

So, the storm subsides to calm:
They see the green trees wave
On the heights o'erlooking Greve.
Hearts that bled are staunched with balm.
'Just our rapture to enhance,
Let the English rake the bay,
Gnash their teeth and glare askance 
As they cannonade away!
'Neath rampired Solidor pleasant riding on the Rance!'
How hope succeeds despair on each Captain's countenance!
Out burst all with one accord,
'This is Paradise for Hell!
Let France, let France's King
Thank the man that did the thing!'
What a shout, and all one word,
'Herve Riel!'
As he stepped in front once more, 
Not a symptom of surprise
In the frank blue Breton eyes,
Just the same man as before.

Then said Damfreville, 'My friend,
I must speak out at the end,
Tho' I find the speaking hard.
Praise is deeper than the lips:
You have saved the King his ships,
You must name your own reward,
'Faith our sun was near eclipse! 
Demand whate'er you will,
France remains your debtor still.
Ask to heart's content and have! or my name's not Damfreville.'

Then a beam of fun outbroke
On the bearded mouth that spoke,
As the honest heart laughed through
Those frank eyes of Breton blue:
'Since I needs must say my say,
Since on board the duty's done,
And from Malo Roads to Croisic Point, what is it but a run?-- 
Since 'tis ask and have, I may--
Since the others go ashore--
Come! A good whole holiday!
Leave to go and see my wife, whom I call the Belle Aurore!'
That he asked and that he got,--nothing more.

Name and deed alike are lost:
Not a pillar nor a post
In his Croisic keeps alive the feat as it befell;
Not a head in white and black
On a single fishing smack, 
In memory of the man but for whom had gone to wrack
All that France saved from the fight whence England bore the bell.
Go to Paris: rank on rank.
Search, the heroes flung pell-mell
On the Louvre, face and flank! 
You shall look long enough ere you come to Herve Riel.
So, for better and for worse,
Herve Riel, accept my verse!
In my verse, Herve Riel, do thou once more
Save the squadron, honour France, love thy wife the Belle Aurore

Its hard to grasp that he's with me
I am so happy all of my friends can see
My heart will always be his
The great thing about him is
He's my world and so much more
He loves me and for once I am sure
No one can take him from me
spencer I will always love you
I hope you will love me to
I must not be so bad
heart broken is what I had
but you took that all away
I think I am running out of things to say
everyone always judged me for the way I might be
But he loved me for me
He will never hurt me or make me cry
I swear I wouldn't lie

(this is to my boyfriend spencer)He met She
He was glee
She knew He
They drank tea
He liked She
She loved He

Love was made
Oh, yes!  It's true.
His heart over she did flew.
Love was there everyday.
Love was there in every way.

He married She
She agreed He
Cry makes Me
They were happy
This story for Thee
So, joy have We

This story is so good and great.
Never was He more in love.
I see He's love on wing on Dove.
Never forget He's love for She.
Love your She, love your He. 

Not till the sun, that brings to birth
The myriad marvels of the earth
And bids us look with wandering eyes
On all that here about us lies,
Has gone behind the hill,
Do you, O peaceful evening star,
Gaze on the dusk in which we are
And draw the heart of hope and love
To infinite deep on deep above
And bid our care be still.

All glorious pleasures of the day,
When every sense may have its way
And thought may touch the tiniest fact
And gauge the motive and the act
And measure our delight,
Depart, and leave us to the quest
Of quiet solitude and rest
And knowledge that the plotting brain
With all its science cannot gain
But from the soul of Night. 

If thy soul, Herrick, dwelt with me, 
This is what my songs would be: 
Hints of our sea-breezes, blent 
With odors from the Orient; 
Indian vessels deep with spice; 
Star-showers from the Norland ice; 
Wine-red jewels that seem to hold 
Fire, but only burn with cold; 
Antique goblets, strangely wrought, 
Filled with the wine of happy thought, 
Bridal measure, vain regrets, 
Laburnum buds and violets; 
Hopeful as the break of day; 
Clear as crystal; new as May; 
Musical as brooks that run 
O'er yellow shallows in the sun; 
Soft as the satin fringe that shades 
The eyelids of thy Devon maids; 
Brief as thy lyrics, Herrick, are, 
And polished as the bosom of a star. 

Through the starry hollow
Of the summer night
I would follow, follow
Hesperus the bright,
To seek beyond the western wave
His garden of delight.

Hesperus the fairest
Of all gods that are,
Peace and dreams thou bearest
In thy shadowy car,
And often in my evening walks
I’ve blessed thee from afar.

Stars without number,
Dust the noon of night,
Thou the early slumber
And the still delight
Of the gentle twilit hours
Rulest in thy right.

When the pale skies shiver,
Seeing night is done,
Past the ocean-river,
Lightly thou dost run,
To look for pleasant, sleepy lands,
That never fear the sun.

Where, beyond the waters
Of the outer sea,
Thy triple crown of daughters
That guards the golden tree
Sing out across the lonely tide
A welcome home to thee.

And while the old, old dragon
For joy lifts up his head,
They bring thee forth a flagon
Of nectar foaming red,
And underneath the drowsy trees
Of poppies strew thy bed.

Ah! that I could follow
In thy footsteps bright,
Through the starry hollow
Of the summer night,
Sloping down the western ways
To find my heart’s delight

PRELUDE.

The Stars are heaven's ministers;
Right royally they teach
In wondrous lowly speech.
All eloquent with music as
The tremblings of a lyre,
To him that hath an ear to hear
They speak in words of fire.

Not to learned sagas only
Their whisperings come down;
The monarch is not glorified
Because he wears a crown.
The humblest soldier in the camp
Can win the smile of Mars,
And 'tis the lowliest spirits hold
Communion with the stars.

Thoughts too refined for utterance,
Ethereal as the air,
Crowd through the brain's dim labyrinths,
And leave their impress there;

As far along the gleaming void
Man's tender glances roll,
Wonder usurps the throne of speech,
But vivifies the soul.

Oh, heaven-cradled mysteries,
What sacred paths ye've trod-
Bright, jewelled scintillations from
When in the spirit He rode forth,
With vast creative aim,
These were His footprints left behind,
To magnify His name!

---

We gazed on the Evening Star,
Mary and I,
As it shone
On its throne
Afar,
In the blue sky;
Shone like a ransomed soul
In the depths of that quiet heaven;
Like a pearly tear,
Trembling with fear
On the pallid cheek of Even.

And I thought of the myriad souls
Gazing with human eyes
On the light of that star,
Shining afar,
In the quiet evening skies;

Some with winged hope,
Clearing the cope
Of heaven as swift as light,
Others, with souls
Blind as the moles,
Sinking in rayless night.

Dreams such as dreamers dream
Flitted before our eyes;
Beautiful visions!-
Angelo's, Titian's,
Had never more gorgeous dyes:
We soared with the angels
Through vistas of glory,
We heard the evangels
Relate the glad story
Of the beautiful star,
Shining afar
In the quiet evening skies.

And we gazed and dreamed,
Till our spirits seemed
Absorbed in the stellar world;
Sorrow was swallowed up,
Drained was the bitter cup
Of earth to the very lees;
And we sailed over seas
Of white vapour that whirled
Through the skies afar,
Angels our charioteers,
Threading the endless spheres,

And to the chorus of angels
Rehearsed the evangels
The Birth of the Evening Star.

---

I.

Far back in the infant ages,
Before the eras stamped their autographs
Upon the stony records of the earth;
Before the burning incense of the sun
Rolled up the interlucent space,
Brightening the blank abyss;
Ere the Recording Angel's tears
Were shed for man's transgressions:
A Seraph, with a face of light,
And hair like heaven's golden atmosphere,
Blue eyes serene in their beatitude,
And stature worthy of her race,
Lived high exalted in the sacred sphere
That floated in a sea of harmony
Translucent as pure crystal, or the light
That flowed, unceasing, from this higher world
Unto the spheres beneath it. Far below
The extremest regions underneath the Earth
The first spheres rose, of vari-coloured light,
In calm rotation through aerial deep,
Like seas of jasper, blue, and coralline,
Crystal and violet; layers of worlds-
The robes of ages that had passed away,

Left as memorials of their sojournings.
For nothing passes wholly. All is changed.
The Years but slumber in their sepulchres,
And speak prophetic meanings in their sleep.


FIRST ANGEL.

Oh, how our souls are gladdened,
When we think of that brave old age,
From heaven, to crown
Each act of the virgin page!

Oh, how our souls are saddened,
At the deeds which were done since then,
By the angel race
In the holy place,
And on earth by the sons of men!

Lo, as the years are fleeting,
With their burden of toil and pain,
We know that the page
Of that primal age
Will be opened up once again.


II.

Progressing still, the bright-faced Seraph rose
From Goodness to Perfection, till she stood
The fairest and the best of all that waked
The tuneful echoes of that lofty world,
Where Lucifer, then the stateliest of the throng
Of Angels, walked majestical, arrayed

In robes of brightness worthy of his place.
And all the intermediate spheres were homes
Of the existences
Of spiritual life.
Love, the divine arcanum, was the bond
That linked them to each other-heart to heart,
And angel world to world, and soul to soul.
Thus the first ages passed,
Cycles of perfect bliss,
Sphere spake with sphere, and love conversed with love,
From the far centre to sublimest height,
And down the deep, unfathomable space,
To the remotest homes of angel-life,
A viewless chain of being circling all,


ANGEL CHORUS.

Spirits that never falter,
Rehearse their paeans of unceasing praise;
Their theme the boundless love
Mysteriously engrafted
On grace divine, and wafted
Into every soul of man that disobeys.

Not till the wondrous being
Of the All-Seeing
Is manifested to finite man,
Can ye understand the love

Evermore extending,
In circles never-ending,
To every atom in the universal plan.


SECOND ANGEL.

Oh, the love beyond computing
Of the high and holy place!
The unseen bond
Circling beyond
The limits of time and space.

Through earth and her world of beauty
The heavenly links extend,
Man feels its presence,
Imbibes its essence,
But cannot yet comprehend.


THIRD ANGEL.

But the days are fast approaching,
When the Father of Love will send
His interpreter
From the highest sphere,
That man fully may comprehend.


III.

Oh, truest Love, because the truest life!
Oh, blest existence, to exist with Love!
Oh, Love, without which all things else must die
The death that knows no waking unto life!
Oh, Jealousy that saps the heart of Love,

And robs it of its tenderness divine;
And Pride, that tramples with its iron hoof
Upon the flower of love, whose fragrant soul
Exhales itself in sweetness as it dies!
A lofty spirit surfeited with Bliss!
A Prince of Angels cancelling all love,
Doing dishonour to his high estate;
Turning the truth and wisdom which were his
For ages of supreme felicity,
Who raised him to such vast preeminence!


SECOND ANGEL CHORUS.

Woe, woe to the ransomed spirit,
Once freed from the stain of sin,
Whose pride increases
Till all love ceases
To nourish it from within!
Its doom is the darkened regions
Where the rebel angel legions
Live their long night of sorrow;
Where no expectant morrow,
No mercy-tempered ray
From the altar of to-day,
Comes down through the gloom to borrow
One dropp from their cup of sorrow,
Or lighten their cheerless way.

 

FIRST ANGEL.

But blest be the gentle spirit
Whose love is ever increased
From its own pure soul,
The illumined goal
Where Love holds perpetual feast!


IV.

Ingrate Angel, he,
To purchase Hell, and at so vast a price!
'Tis the old story of celestial strife-
False angels joining the insurgent ranks,
Who suffered dire defeats, and fell at last
From bliss supreme to darkness and despair.
But they, the faithful dwellers in the spheres,
Who kept their souls inviolate, to whom
Heaven's love and truth were truly great rewards:
For these the stars were sown throughout all space,
As fit memorials of their faithfulness.
The wretched lost were banished to the depths
Beneath the lowest spheres. Earth barred the space
Between them and the Faithful. Then the hills
Rose bald and rugged o'er the wild abyss;
The waters found their places; and the sun,
The bright-haired warder of the golden morn,
Parting the curtains of reposing night,
Rung his first challenge to the dismal shades,
That shrunk back, awed, into Cimmerean gloom;
And the young moon glode through the startled void
With quiet beauty and majestic mien.

 

SECOND ANGEL.

Slowly rose the daedal Earth,
Through the purple-hued abysm
Glowing like a gorgeous prism,
Heaven exulting o'er its birth,

Still the mighty wonder came,
Through the jasper-coloured sphere,
Ether-winged, and crystal-clear,
Trembling to the loud acclaim,

In a haze of golden rain,
Up the heavens rolled the sun,
Danae-like the earth was won,
Else his love and light were vain.

So the heart and soul of man
Own the light and love of heaven,
Nothing yet in vain was given,
Nature's is a perfect plan.


V.

The glowing Seraph with the brow of light
Was first among the Faithful. When the war
Between heaven's rival armies fiercely waged,
She bore the Will Divine from rank to rank,
The chosen courier of Deity.
Her presence cheered the combatants for Truth,
And Victory stood up where'er she moved.
And now, in gleaming robe of woven pearl,
Emblazoned with devices of the stars,
And legends of their glory yet to come,

 

The type of Beauty Intellectual,
The representative of Love and Truth,
She moves first in the innumerable throng
Of angels congregating to behold
The crowning wonder of creative power.


THIRD ANGEL CHORUS,

Oh, joy, that no mortal can fathom,
To be first in the light
Of His Holy sight,
And freed from His chastening rod.
Faithful, indeed, that soul, to be
The messenger of Deity!


FIRST ANGEL.

This, this is the chosen spirit,
Whose love is ever increased
From its own pare soul,
The illumined goal
Where Love holds perpetual feast.


VI.

With noiseless speed the angel charioteers
In dazzling splendour all triumphant rode;
Through seas of ether painfully serene,
That flashed a golden, phosphorescent spray,
As luminous as the sun's intensest beams,
Athwart the wide, interminable space.
Vast phalanxes of graceful cherubim;

Innumerable multitudes and ranks
Of all the hosts and hierarchs of heaven,
Moved by one universal impulse, urged
Their steeds of swiftness up the arch of light,
From sphere to sphere increasing as they came,
Till world on world was emptied of its race.
Upward, with unimaginable speed,
The myriads, congregating zenith-ward,
Reached the far confines of the utmost sphere,
The home of Truth, the dwelling-place of Love,
Striking celestial symphonies divine
From the resounding sea of melody,
That heaved in swells of soft, mellifluous sound,
To the blest crowds at whose triumphal tread
Its soul of sweetness waked in thrills sublime,
The sun stood poised upon the western verge;
The moon paused, waiting for the march of earth,
That stayed to watch the advent of the stars;
And ocean hushed its very deepest deeps
In grateful expectation.


SECOND ANGEL.

Still through the viewless regions
Of the habitable air,
Through the ether ocean,
In unceasing motion,
Pass the multitudinous legions
Of angels everywhere.

Bearing each new-born spirit
Through the interlucent void

To its starry dwelling,
Angel anthems telling
Every earthly deed of merit
To each flashing asteroid.


THIRD ANGEL.

Through the realms sidereal,
Clothed with the immaterial,
Far as the fields elysian
In starry bloom extend,
The stretch of angel vision
Can see and comprehend.


VII.

Innumerable as the ocean sands
The angel concourse in due order stood,
In meek anticipation waiting for
The new-created orbs,
Still hidden in the deep
And unseen laboratory, where
Not even angel eyes could penetrate:
A star for each of that angelic host,
Memorials of their faithfulness and love.
To the pure Seraph with the brow of light,
And named for her, mild Hesperus,
Came twinkling down the unencumbered blue,
On viewless wings of sweet melodious sound,
Beauty and grace presiding at its birth.
Celestial plaudits sweeping through the skies
Waked resonant paeans, till the concave thrilled

Through its illimitable bounds.
With a sudden burst
Of light, that lit the universal space
As with a flame of crystal,
Rousing the Soul of Joy
That slumbered in the patient sea,
From every point of heaven the hurrying cars
Conveyed the constellations to their thrones-
The throbbing planets, and the burning suns,
Erratic comets, and the various grades
And magnitudes of palpitating stars.
From the far arctic and antarctic zones,
Through all the vast, surrounding infinite,
A wilderness of intermingling orbs,
The gleaming wonders, pulsing earthward, came;
Each to its destined place,
Each in itself a world,
With all its coining myriad life,
Drawing us nearer the Omnipotent,
With hearts of wonder, and with souls of praise:
Astrea, Pallas, strange Aldebaran,
The Pleiads, Arcturus, the ruddy Mars,
Pale Saturn, Ceres and Orion-
All as they circle still
Through the enraptured void.
For each young angel born to us from earth,
A new-made star is launched among its peers.


FULL ANGEL CHORUS.

Dreamer in the realms aerial,
Searcher for the true and good,
Hoper for the high, ethereal
Limit of Beatitude,
Lift thy heart to heaven, for there
Is embalmed thy spirit prayer:
Not in words is shrined thy prayer,
But thy Thought awaits thee there.
The grandest hymn
That nature chants-the litany
Of the rejoicing stars-is silent praise.
Their nightly anthems stir
The souls of lofty seraphim
In the remotest heaven. The melody
Descends in throbbings of celestial light
Into the heart of man, whose upward gaze,
And meditative aspect, tell
Of the heart's incense passing up the night.
Above the crystalline height
The theme of thoughtful praise ascends.
Not from the wildest swell
Of the vexed ocean soars the fullest psalm;
But in the evening calm,
And in the solemn midnight, silence blends
With silence, and to the ear
Attuned to harmony divine
Begets a strain
Whose trance-like stillness wakes delicious pain.
The silent tear
Holds keener anguish in its orb of brine,
Deeper and truer grief
Than the loud wail that brings relief,

As thunder clears the atmosphere.
But the deep, tearless Sorrow,-how profound!
Unspoken to the ear
Of sense, 'tis yet as eloquent a sound
As that which wakes the lyre
Of the rejoicing Day, when
Morn on the mountains lights his urn of fire.
The flowers of the glen
Rejoice in silence; huge pines stand apart
Upon the lofty hills, and sigh
Their woes to every breeze that passeth by;
The willow tells its mournful tale
So tenderly, that e'en the passing gale
Bears not a murmur on its wings
Of what the spirit sings
That breathes its trembling thoughts through all the
drooping strings.
In the obedient heart.
The thunder's noisome boast,
What is it to the violet lightning thought?
So with the burning passion of the stars-
Creation's diamond sands,
Strewn along the pearly strands,
And far-extending corridors
Of heaven's blooming shores;
No scintil of their jewelled flame
But wafts the exquisite essence
Of prayer to the Eternal Presence,
Of praise to the Eternal Name.
The silent prayer unbars

The gates of Paradise, while the too-intimate,
Self-righteous' boast, strikes rudely at the gate
Of heaven, unknowing why it does not open to
Their summons, as they see pale Silence passing through.


VIII.

In grateful admiration, till the Dawn
Withdrew the gleaming curtains of the night,
We watched the whirling systems, until each
Could recognize their own peculiar star;
When, with the swift celerity
Of Fancy-footed Thought,
The light-caparisoned, aerial steeds,
Shod with rare fleetness,
Revisited the farthest of the spheres
Ere the earth's sun had kissed the mountain tops,
Or shook the sea-pearls from his locks of gold.

---

Still on the Evening Star
Gazed we with steadfast eyes,
As it shone
On its throne
Afar,
In the blue skies.
No longer the charioteers
Dashed through the gleaming spheres;
No more the evangels
Rehearsed the glad story;
But, in passing, the angels
Left footprints of glory:

For up the starry void
Bright-flashing asteroid,
Pale moon and starry choir,
Aided by Fancy's fire,
Rung from the glittering lyre
Changes of song and hymn,
Worthy of Seraphim.
Watching her starry flocks from zone to zone,
While we, like mortals turned to breathing stone,
Intently pondered on the Known Unknown. 

O Hesperus, thou bringest all good things--
Home to the weary, to the hungry cheer,
To the young bird the parent's brooding wings,
The welcome stall to the o'erlabored steer;
Whate'er our household gods protect of dear,
Are gathered round us by thy look of rest;
Thou bring'st the child too to its mother's breast. 




William, my teacher, my friend ! dear William and dear Dorothea !
Smooth out the folds of my letter, and place it on desk or on table ;
Place it on table or desk ; and your right hands loosely half-closing,
Gently sustain them in air, and extending the digit didactic,
Rest it a moment on each of the forks of the five-forked left hand,
Twice on the breadth of the thumb, and once on the tip of each finger ;
Read with a nod of the head in a humouring recitativo ;
And, as I live, you will see my hexameters hopping before you.
This is a galloping measure ; a hop, and a trot, and a gallop !

All my hexameters fly, like stags pursued by the staghounds,
Breathless and panting, and ready to drop, yet flying still onwards,
I would full fain pull in my hard-mouthed runaway hunter ;
But our English Spondeans are clumsy yet impotent curb-reins ;
And so to make him go slowly, no way left have I but to lame him.

William, my head and my heart ! dear Poet that feelest and thinkest !
Dorothy, eager of soul, my most affectionate sister !
Many a mile, O ! many a wearisome mile are ye distant,
Long, long, comfortless roads, with no one eye that doth know us.
O ! it is all too far to send to you mockeries idle :
Yea, and I feel it not right ! But O ! my friends, my beloved !
Feverish and wakeful I lie,--I am weary of feeling and thinking.
Every thought is worn down,--I am weary, yet cannot be vacant.
Five long hours have I tossed, rheumatic heats, dry and flushing,
Gnawing behind in my head, and wandering and throbbing about me,
Busy and tiresome, my friends, as the beat of the boding night-spider.

I forget the beginning of the line :

     
     my eyes are a burthen,
Now unwillingly closed, now open and aching with darkness.
O ! what a life is the eye ! what a strange and inscrutable essence !
Him that is utterly blind, nor glimpses the fire that warms him ;
Him that never beheld the swelling breast of his mother ;
Him that smiled in his gladness as a babe that smiles in its slumber ;
Even for him it exists, it moves and stirs in its prison ;
Lives with a separate life, and `Is it a Spirit ?' he murmurs :
`Sure, it has thoughts of its own, and to see is only a language.'

There was a great deal more, which I have forgotten.
The last line
which I wrote, I remember, and write it for the truth of the sentiment,
scarcely less true in company than in pain and solitude :--

William, my head and my heart ! dear William and dear Dorothea !
You have all in each other ; but I am lonely, and want you 

Hey. 
do you remember
the times profound
when 
our hearts alive
knew no bounds
when 
our minds fresh
were allowed free
when
we were just
kids
and the world
let us be? 
Hey. 
it seems so 
long ago
so long
now
have our spirits
showed
an interest 
in being curious
why did
life become
more and more
serious? 
Is it 
the days or the age
that kills
the young at heart
like rats trapped, 
confined in a cage? 
Working 
to live
or working
to die. 
working 
paycheck to paycheck
just getting by? 
Hey, 
did you 
see yourself
growing old
before it happened, 
before your
life got sold? 
Well 
it happened
and it
just so 
happens
you've been 
living for a dream
while life
stole your 
passion.
Think about it
what did
it cost
think you've done
all you could 
not to get lost
in the hustle
and the bustle
that is your life
your dreams
and reality
become your strife
Hey, 
I can't really
blame you
life's like putting 
out fires too
and right smack
in the
middle
of life's obscurest
riddles
you're expected
to make dream
and reality
come full circle? 
Good luck
with that. 
let me know 
how it works out for you
No pressure now
and I wish
you good luck too
But the older
you get
time goes a little bit faster
Just to make sure
you know
just who really is your master. 

And
in the end
what does it really
matter
is it the full life
or who's 
wallet is
getting fatter? 

Hey, 
it's just a 
rhyme with a question
But it wouldn't hurt
to live life
like it's your passion.


November an you believe it a poem called
hey. who does that? how
do you do it write a poem about
hey? this is how, hey how ya doing
my name is david and yours.  ..
oh nice name so what are you doing

people trying to brighten their day
just by saying hey hows it going
did you know jesus loves you 
and by the way i hope you enjoy
the rest of your day. and 
speard the word all you have to


Hey brother, why do you want me to talk?
Talk and talk and the real things get lost.

Talk and talk and things get out of hand.
Why not stop talking and think?

If you meet someone good, listen a little, speak;
If you meet someone bad, clench up like a fist.

Talking with a wise man is a great reward.
Talking with a fool? A waste.

Kabir says: A pot makes noise if it's half full,
But fill it to the brim - no sound. 

Hey, bug, stay!
Don't run away.
I know a game that we can play.

I'll hold my fingers very still 
And you can climb a finger-hill.

No, no.
Don't go.

Here's a wall - a tower, too,
A tiny bug town, just for you.
I've a cookie. You have some.
Take this oatmeal cookie crumb.
Hey, bug, stay!
Hey, bug!
Hey

Hey diddle diddle
We're all on the fiddle
And never get up until noon.
We only take cash
Which we carefully stash
And we work by the light of the moon. 

I whip 
off my bikini top

and your eyes

grow as big as
my breasts

I can see each one
reflected in each eye.

The Gameboy 
falls on your lap.

My.  

my.  

my.  

oh my! 

Oh.  

you're suddenly such
a big boy! 

Aren't you? 

You sigh
and hold your breath

but wait.  

I ain't
finished with you yet.

I undo
tantilisingly slowly

as if freeze frame by freeze frame

the tiny string
at my left hip

and let it dangle, 

Then I untie
the tiny string
at my right hip

and the whole damn thing
comes apart

(you are looking straight at
my super furry animal) ..

You are almost mute
except for the odd strangulated sob.

You sure are a fine upstanding citizen.

You stumble forward
blind out of your mind

with a curious mixture
of both love and lust.

I think at the minute
the lust is winning.

And,  why.  

wouldn't it? 

I get what's coming to me
(no more than I inteneded)     

(at least it tore you away
from that stupid Nintendo) .

I gasp
as you grasp

an ankle in each hand

pull my legs apart
as if I were a wishbone.

'Oh come come now! '
I moan

and you take me
at my word.


Hey Perverted Delhiites
Shame on you
For making
Capital of Rape 
In India 
Why but? 

A desperate protest
Vide infra ~ 




Poetry rolls forward: -
Come on rape me
With prurient plunge 
Sense the stinging
Embracing warmth 
Of g**m* ra*. 


My females
Are programmed
To em***ulate 
Radioactively 
An exemplary 
Resort needed
To dodo rapists.



Gazing at the silvery morning half-moon, 

Swept by wispy white clouds against a clear blue sky.

Shaded by trees birthed by the landscaper's plan.

While gently lapping, hugged by crystal water.

Wondering about my lifelong questions.

How was my soul assigned to me? 

Is there a galactic bull-pen with ten billion souls, 

Waiting to join someone formed by the creator's hand? 

Jimmie's soul, you're up, at the moment of love's great performance.

You could have been with a wealthy noble, 

Or destined to one struggling for survival.

Well soul, my eternal mate, you made the B-team. 

Is it so bad? It's only for a few heartbeats. 

Hey, sparrow!
out of the way,
    Horse is coming.
 



I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm, 
your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm, 
yes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new, 
in city and in forest they smiled like me and you, 
but now it's come to distances and both of us must try, 
your eyes are soft with sorrow, 
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye. 

HEY, the dusty Miller,
And his dusty coat,
He will win a shilling,
Or he spend a groat:
Dusty was the coat,
Dusty was the colour,
Dusty was the kiss
That I gat frae the Miller.


Hey, the dusty Miller,
And his dusty sack;
Leeze me on the calling
Fills the dusty peck:
Fills the dusty peck,
Brings the dusty siller;
I wad gie my coatie
For the dusty Miller. 

Why do we multiply our possessions
and reduce our values? 

Why do we love little
and hate too often? 

We have learned to make a living, 
but not a life.

Is it true my friend 
that we have added years to life
but not life to years? 

WHY DO WE BUY MORE
BUT ENJOY LESS? 
-
I gave two plantains to a poor woman
on the street begging.
She took them with a great smile.

There was light in her eyes, I saw; 
Shared TWO plantains with her FOUR children.

She sat, 
with tearful eyes, 
wiped the face of her children

and smiled.

You shall hear how Hiawatha 
Prayed and fasted in the forest, 
Not for greater skill in hunting, 
Not for greater craft in fishing, 
Not for triumphs in the battle, 
And renown among the warriors, 
But for profit of the people, 
For advantage of the nations.
    First he built a lodge for fasting, 
Built a wigwam in the forest, 
By the shining Big-Sea-Water, 
In the blithe and pleasant Spring-time, 
In the Moon of Leaves he built it,
And, with dreams and visions many, 
Seven whole days and nights he fasted.
    On the first day of his fasting 
Through the leafy woods he wandered; 
Saw the deer start from the thicket, 
Saw the rabbit in his burrow, 
Heard the pheasant, Bena, drumming, 
Heard the squirrel, Adjidaumo, 
Rattling in his hoard of acorns, 
Saw the pigeon, the Omeme, 
Building nests among the pinetrees, 
And in flocks the wild-goose, Wawa, 
Flying to the fen-lands northward, 
Whirring, wailing far above him. 
"Master of Life!" he cried, desponding, 
"Must our lives depend on these things?"
    On the next day of his fasting 
By the river's brink he wandered, 
Through the Muskoday, the meadow, 
Saw the wild rice, Mahnomonee, 
Saw the blueberry, Meenahga, 
And the strawberry, Odahmin, 
And the gooseberry, Shahbomin, 
And the grape. 

vine, the Bemahgut, 
Trailing o'er the alder-branches, 
Filling all the air with fragrance! 
"Master of Life!" he cried, desponding, 
"Must our lives depend on these things?"
    On the third day of his fasting 
By the lake he sat and pondered, 
By the still, transparent water; 
Saw the sturgeon, Nahma, leaping, 
Scattering drops like beads of wampum, 
Saw the yellow perch, the Sahwa, 
Like a sunbeam in the water, 
Saw the pike, the Maskenozha, 
And the herring, Okahahwis, 
And the Shawgashee, the crawfish!
"Master of Life!" he cried, desponding, 
"Must our lives depend on these things?"
    On the fourth day of his fasting 
In his lodge he lay exhausted; 
From his couch of leaves and branches 
Gazing with half-open eyelids, 
Full of shadowy dreams and visions, 
On the dizzy, swimming landscape, 
On the gleaming of the water, 
On the splendor of the sunset.
    And he saw a youth approaching, 
Dressed in garments green and yellow, 
Coming through the purple twilight, 
Through the splendor of the sunset; 
Plumes of green bent o'er his forehead, 
And his hair was soft and golden.
    Standing at the open doorway, 
Long he looked at Hiawatha, 
Looked with pity and compassion 
On his wasted form and features, 
And, in accents like the sighing 
Of the South-Wind in the tree-tops, 
Said he, "O my Hiawatha! 
All your prayers are heard in heaven, 
For you pray not like the others; 
Not for greater skill in hunting, 
Not for greater craft in fishing, 
Not for triumph in the battle, 
Nor renown among the warriors, 
But for profit of the people, 
For advantage of the nations.
    "From the Master of Life descending, 
I, the friend of man, Mondamin, 
Come to warn you and instruct you, 
How by struggle and by labor 
You shall gain what you have prayed for. 
Rise up from your bed of branches, 
Rise, O youth, and wrestle with me!"
    Faint with famine, Hiawatha 
Started from his bed of branches, 
From the twilight of his wigwam 
Forth into the flush of sunset 
Came, and wrestled with Mondamin; 
At his touch he felt new courage 
Throbbing in his brain and bosom, 
Felt new life and hope and vigor 
Run through every nerve and fibre.
    So they wrestled there together 
In the glory of the sunset, 
And the more they strove and struggled, 
Stronger still grew Hiawatha; 
Till the darkness fell around them, 
And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah, 
From her nest among the pine-trees, 
Gave a cry of lamentation, 
Gave a scream of pain and famine.
    "'T Is enough!" then said Mondamin, 
Smiling upon Hiawatha,
"But tomorrow, when the sun sets, 
I will come again to try you
 

And he vanished, and was seen not; 
Whether sinking as the rain sinks, 
Whether rising as the mists rise, 
Hiawatha saw not, knew not, 
Only saw that he had vanished, 
Leaving him alone and fainting, 
With the misty lake below him, 
And the reeling stars above him.
    On the morrow and the next day, 
When the sun through heaven descending, 
Like a red and burning cinder 
From the hearth of the Great Spirit, 
Fell into the western waters, 
Came Mondamin for the trial, 
For the strife with Hiawatha; 
Came as silent as the dew comes,
From the empty air appearing, 
Into empty air returning, 
Taking shape when earth it touches, 
But invisible to all men
In its coming and its going.
    Thrice they wrestled there together 
In the glory of the sunset, 
Till the darkness fell around them, 
Till the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah, 
From her nest among the pine-trees, 
Uttered her loud cry of famine, 
And Mondamin paused to listen.
    Tall and beautiful he stood there, 
In his garments green and yellow; 
To and fro his plumes above him, 
Waved and nodded with his breathing, 
And the sweat of the encounter 
Stood like drops of dew upon him.
    And he cried, "O Hiawatha! 
Bravely have you wrestled with me, 
Thrice have wrestled stoutly with me, 
And the Master of Life, who sees us, 
He will give to you the triumph!"
    Then he smiled, and said: "To-morrow 
Is the last day of your conflict,
Is the last day of your fasting. 
You will conquer and o'ercome me; 
Make a bed for me to lie in, 
Where the rain may fall upon me, 
Where the sun may come and warm me; 
Strip these garments, green and yellow, 
Strip this nodding plumage from me, 
Lay me in the earth, and make it 
Soft and loose and light above me.
    "Let no hand disturb my slumber, 
Let no weed nor worm molest me, 
Let not Kahgahgee, the raven, 
Come to haunt me and molest me,
Only come yourself to watch me, 
Till I wake, and start, and quicken, 
Till I leap into the sunshine"
    And thus saying, he departed; 
Peacefully slept Hiawatha, 
But he heard the Wawonaissa, 
Heard the whippoorwill complaining, 
Perched upon his lonely wigwam; 
Heard the rushing Sebowisha, 
Heard the rivulet rippling near him, 
Talking to the darksome forest; 
Heard the sighing of the branches,
As they lifted and subsided 
At the passing of the night-wind, 
Heard them, as one hears in slumber 
Far-off murmurs, dreamy whispers: 
Peacefully slept Hiawatha.
    On the morrow came Nokomis, 
On the seventh day of his fasting, 
Came with food for Hiawatha, 
Came imploring and bewailing, 
Lest his hunger should o'ercome him, 
Lest his fasting should be fatal.
    But he tasted not, and touched not, 
Only said to her, "Nokomis, 
Wait until the sun is setting, 
Till the darkness falls around us, 
Till the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah, 
Crying from the desolate marshes, 
Tells us that the day is ended

"
    Homeward weeping went Nokomis, 
Sorrowing for her Hiawatha, 
Fearing lest his strength should fail him, 
Lest his fasting should be fatal. 
He meanwhile sat weary waiting 
For the coming of Mondamin, 
Till the shadows, pointing eastward, 
Lengthened over field and forest,
Till the sun dropped from the heaven,
Floating on the waters westward,
As a red leaf in the Autumn
Falls and floats upon the water,
Falls and sinks into its bosom.
    And behold! the young Mondamin,
With his soft and shining tresses,
With his garments green and yellow,
With his long and glossy plumage,
Stood and beckoned at the doorway.
And as one in slumber walking,
Pale and haggard, but undaunted,
From the wigwam Hiawatha
Came and wrestled with Mondamin.
    Round about him spun the landscape,
Sky and forest reeled together,
And his strong heart leaped within him,
As the sturgeon leaps and struggles
In a net to break its meshes.
Like a ring of fire around him
Blazed and flared the red horizon,
And a hundred suns seemed looking
At the combat of the wrestlers.
    Suddenly upon the greensward
All alone stood Hiawatha,
Panting with his wild exertion,
Palpitating with the struggle;
And before him breathless, lifeless,
Lay the youth, with hair dishevelled,
Plumage torn, and garments tattered,
Dead he lay there in the sunset.
    And victorious Hiawatha
Made the grave as he commanded,
Stripped the garments from Mondamin,
Stripped his tattered plumage from him,
Laid him in the earth, and made it
Soft and loose and light above him;
And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
From the melancholy moorlands, 
Gave a cry of lamentation, 
Gave a cry of pain and anguish!
    Homeward then went Hiawatha 
To the lodge of old Nokomis, 
And the seven days of his fasting 
Were accomplished and completed. 
But the place was not forgotten 
Where he wrestled with Mondamin; 
Nor forgotten nor neglected 
Was the grave where lay Mondamin, 
Sleeping in the rain and sunshine, 
Where his scattered plumes and garments 
Faded in the rain and sunshine.
    Day by day did Hiawatha 
Go to wait and watch beside it;
Kept the dark mould soft above it, 
Kept it clean from weeds and insects, 
Drove away, with scoffs and shoutings, 
Kahgahgee, the king of ravens.
    Till at length a small green feather 
From the earth shot slowly upward, 
Then another and another, 
And before the Summer ended 
Stood the maize in all its beauty, 
With its shining robes about it, 
And its long, soft, yellow tresses; 
And in rapture Hiawatha 
Cried aloud, "It is Mondamin! 
Yes, the friend of man, Mondamin!"
    Then he called to old Nokomis 
And Iagoo, the great boaster, 
Showed them where the maize was growing, 
Told them of his wondrous vision, 
Of his wrestling and his triumph, 
Of this new gift to the nations, 
Which should be their food forever.
    And still later, when the Autumn 
Changed the long, green leaves to yellow, 
And the soft and juicy kernels 
Grew like wampum hard and yellow, 
Then the ripened ears he gathered, 
Stripped the withered husks from off them, 
As he once had stripped the wrestler, 
Gave the first Feast of Mondamin, 
And made known unto the people 
This new gift of the Great Spirit. 

Forth upon the Gitche Gumee, 
On the shining Big-Sea-Water, 
With his fishing-line of cedar, 
Of the twisted bark of cedar, 
Forth to catch the sturgeon Nahma, 
Mishe-Nahma, King of Fishes, 
In his birch canoe exulting 
All alone went Hiawatha.
    Through the clear, transparent water 
He could see the fishes swimming 
Far down in the depths below him; 
See the yellow perch, the Sahwa, 
Like a sunbeam in the water,
See the Shawgashee, the craw-fish, 
Like a spider on the bottom, 
On the white and sandy bottom.
    At the stern sat Hiawatha, 
With his fishing-line of cedar; 
In his plumes the breeze of morning 
Played as in the hemlock branches; 
On the bows, with tail erected, 
Sat the squirrel, Adjidaumo; 
In his fur the breeze of morning 
Played as in the prairie grasses.
    On the white sand of the bottom 
Lay the monster Mishe-Nahma, 
Lay the sturgeon, King of Fishes; 
Through his gills he breathed the water, 
With his fins he fanned and winnowed, 
With his tail he swept the sand-floor.
    There he lay in all his armor; 
On each side a shield to guard him, 
Plates of bone upon his forehead, 
Down his sides and back and shoulders
Plates of bone with spines projecting 
Painted was he with his war-paints, 
Stripes of yellow, red, and azure, 
Spots of brown and spots of sable; 
And he lay there on the bottom, 
Fanning with his fins of purple, 
As above him Hiawatha 
In his birch canoe came sailing, 
With his fishing-line of cedar.
    "Take my bait," cried Hiawatha, 
Dawn into the depths beneath him, 
"Take my bait, O Sturgeon, Nahma! 
Come up from below the water, 
Let us see which is the stronger!" 
And he dropped his line of cedar 
Through the clear, transparent water, 
Waited vainly for an answer, 
Long sat waiting for an answer, 
And repeating loud and louder, 
"Take my bait, O King of Fishes!"
    Quiet lay the sturgeon, Nahma, 
Fanning slowly in the water, 
Looking up at Hiawatha, 
Listening to his call and clamor, 
His unnecessary tumult, 
Till he wearied of the shouting; 
And he said to the Kenozha, 
To the pike, the Maskenozha, 
"Take the bait of this rude fellow, 
Break the line of Hiawatha!"
    In his fingers Hiawatha 
Felt the loose line jerk and tighten, 
As he drew it in, it tugged so 
That the birch canoe stood endwise, 
Like a birch log in the water, 
With the squirrel, Adjidaumo, 
Perched and frisking on the summit.
Full of scorn was Hiawatha 
When he saw the fish rise upward, 
Saw the pike, the Maskenozha, 
Coming nearer, nearer to him, 
And he shouted through the water, 
"Esa! esa! shame upon you! 
You are but the pike, Kenozha, 
You are not the fish I wanted, 
You are not the King of Fishes!"
    Reeling downward to the bottom 
Sank the pike in great confusion, 
And the mighty sturgeon, Nahma, 
Said to Ugudwash, the sun-fish, 
To the bream, with scales of crimson, 
"Take the bait of this great boaster, 
Break the line of Hiawatha!"
    Slowly upward, wavering, gleaming, 
Rose the Ugudwash, the sun-fish, 
Seized the line of Hiawatha, 
Swung with all his weight upon it, 
Made a whirlpool in the water, 
Whirled the birch canoe in circles, 
Round and round in gurgling eddies, 
Till the circles in the water 
Reached the far-off sandy beaches, 
Till the water-flags and rushes 
Nodded on the distant margins.
    But when Hiawatha saw him 
Slowly rising through the water, 
Lifting up his disk refulgent, 
Loud he shouted in derision, 
"Esa! esa! shame upon you! 
You are Ugudwash, the sun-fish, 
You are not the fish I wanted, 
You are not the King of Fishes!"
    Slowly downward, wavering, gleaming, 
Sank the Ugudwash, the sun-fish, 
And again the sturgeon, Nahma, 
Heard the shout of Hiawatha,
Heard his challenge of defiance, 
The unnecessary tumult, 
Ringing far across the water.
    From the white sand of the bottom 
Up he rose with angry gesture, 
Quivering in each nerve and fibre, 
Clashing all his plates of armor, 
Gleaming bright with all his war-paint; 
In his wrath he darted upward, 
Flashing leaped into the sunshine, 
Opened his great jaws, and swallowed 
Both canoe and Hiawatha.
    Down into that darksome cavern 
Plunged the headlong Hiawatha, 
As a log on some black river 
Shoots and plunges down the rapids, 
Found himself in utter darkness, 
Groped about in helpless wonder, 
Till he felt a great heart beating, 
Throbbing in that utter darkness.
    And he smote it in his anger, 
With his fist, the heart of Nahma, 
Felt the mighty King of Fishes 
Shudder through each nerve and fibre, 
Heard the water gurgle round him 
As he leaped and staggered through it, 
Sick at heart, and faint and weary.
    Crosswise then did Hiawatha 
Drag his birch-canoe for safety, 
Lest from out the jaws of Nahma, 
In the turmoil and confusion, 
Forth he might be hurled and perish. 
And the squirrel, Adjidaumo, 
Frisked and chatted very gayly, 
Toiled and tugged with Hiawatha 
Till the labor was completed.
    Then said Hiawatha to him, 
"O my little friend, the squirrel,
Bravely have you toiled to help me; 
Take the thanks of Hiawatha, 
And the name which now he gives you; 
For hereafter and forever 
Boys shall call you Adjidaumo, 
Tail-in-air the boys shall call you!"
    And again the sturgeon, Nahma, 
Gasped and quivered in the water, 
Then was still, and drifted landward 
Till he grated on the pebbles, 
Till the listening Hiawatha 
Heard him grate upon the margin, 
Felt him strand upon the pebbles, 
Knew that Nahma, King of Fishes, 
Lay there dead upon the margin.
    Then he heard a clang and flapping, 
As of many wings assembling, 
Heard a screaming and confusion, 
As of birds of prey contending, 
Saw a gleam of light above him, 
Shining through the ribs of Nahma, 
Saw the glittering eyes of sea-gulls, 
Of Kayoshk, the sea-gulls, peering, 
Gazing at him through the opening, 
Heard them saying to each other, 
"'T is our brother, Hiawatha!"
    And he shouted from below them, 
Cried exulting from the caverns: 
"O ye sea-gulls! O my brothers! 
I have slain the sturgeon, Nahma; 
Make the rifts a little larger, 
With your claws the openings widen, 
Set me free from this dark prison, 
And henceforward and forever 
Men shall speak of your achievements, 
Calling you Kayoshk, the sea-gulls, 
Yes, Kayoshk, the Noble Scratchers!"
    And the wild and clamorous sea-gulls
Toiled with beak and claws together, 
Made the rifts and openings wider 
In the mighty ribs of Nahma, 
And from peril and from prison, 
From the body of the sturgeon, 
From the peril of the water, 
They released my Hiawatha.
    He was standing near his wigwam, 
On the margin of the water, 
And he called to old Nokomis, 
Called and beckoned to Nokomis, 
Pointed to the sturgeon, Nahma, 
Lying lifeless on the pebbles, 
With the sea-gulls feeding on him.
    "I have slain the Mishe-Nahma,
Slain the King of Fishes!" said he' 
"Look! the sea-gulls feed upon him,
Yes, my friends Kayoshk, the sea-gulls; 
Drive them not away, Nokomis, 
They have saved me from great peril 
In the body of the sturgeon, 
Wait until their meal is ended, 
Till their craws are full with feasting, 
Till they homeward fly, at sunset, 
To their nests among the marshes; 
Then bring all your pots and kettles, 
And make oil for us in Winter

"
    And she waited till the sun set, 
Till the pallid moon, the Night-sun, 
Rose above the tranquil water, 
Till Kayoshk, the sated sea-gulls, 
From their banquet rose with clamor, 
And across the fiery sunset 
Winged their way to far-off islands, 
To their nests among the rushes.
    To his sleep went Hiawatha, 
And Nokomis to her labor, 
Toiling patient in the moonlight,
Till the sun and moon changed places, 
Till the sky was red with sunrise, 
And Kayoshk, the hungry sea-gulls, 
Came back from the reedy islands, 
Clamorous for their morning banquet.
    Three whole days and nights alternate 
Old Nokomis and the sea-gulls 
Stripped the oily flesh of Nahma, 
Till the waves washed through the rib-bones, 
Till the sea-gulls came no longer, 
And upon the sands lay nothing 
But the skeleton of Nahma. 

Two good friends had Hiawatha, 
Singled out from all the others, 
Bound to him in closest union, 
And to whom he gave the right hand 
Of his heart, in joy and sorrow; 
Chibiabos, the musician,
And the very strong man, Kwasind.
    Straight between them ran the pathway, 
Never grew the grass upon it; 
Singing birds, that utter falsehoods, 
Story-tellers, mischief-makers, 
Found no eager ear to listen, 
Could not breed ill-will between them, 
For they kept each other's counsel, 
Spake with naked hearts together, 
Pondering much and much contriving 
How the tribes of men might prosper.
    Most beloved by Hiawatha 
Was the gentle Chibiabos, 
He the best of all musicians, 
He the sweetest of all singers. 
Beautiful and childlike was he, 
Brave as man is, soft as woman, 
Pliant as a wand of willow, 
Stately as a deer with antlers.
    When he sang, the village listened; 
All the warriors gathered round him, 
All the women came to hear him; 
Now he stirred their souls to passion, 
Now he melted them to pity.
    From the hollow reeds he fashioned 
Flutes so musical and mellow, 
That the brook, the Sebowisha, 
Ceased to murmur in the woodland, 
That the wood-birds ceased from singing, 
And the squirrel, Adjidaumo, 
Ceased his chatter in the oak-tree, 
And the rabbit, the Wabasso, 
Sat upright to look and listen.
    Yes, the brook, the Sebowisha, 
Pausing, said, "O Chibiabos, 
Teach my waves to flow in music, 
Softly as your words in singing!"
    Yes, the bluebird, the Owaissa, 
Envious, said, "O Chibiabos, 
Teach me tones as wild and wayward, 
Teach me songs as full of frenzy!"
    Yes, the robin, the Opechee, 
Joyous, said, "O Chibiabos, 
Teach me tones as sweet and tender, 
Teach me songs as full of gladness!"
    And the whippoorwill, Wawonaissa, 
Sobbing, said, "O Chibiabos, 
Teach me tones as melancholy, 
Teach me songs as full of sadness!"
    All the many sounds of nature 
Borrowed sweetness from his singing; 
All the hearts of men were softened 
By the pathos of his music; 
For he sang of peace and freedom, 
Sang of beauty, love, and longing; 
Sang of death, and life undying 
In the Islands of the Blessed,
In the kingdom of Ponemah, 
In the land of the Hereafter.
    Very dear to Hiawatha 
Was the gentle Chibiabos, 
He the best of all musicians, 
He the sweetest of all singers; 
For his gentleness he loved him, 
And the magic of his singing.
    Dear, too, unto Hiawatha 
Was the very strong man, Kwasind, 
He the strongest of all mortals, 
He the mightiest among many; 
For his very strength he loved him, 
For his strength allied to goodness.
    Idle in his youth was Kwasind, 
Very listless, dull, and dreamy, 
Never played with other children, 
Never fished and never hunted, 
Not like other children was he; 
But they saw that much he fasted, 
Much his Manito entreated, 
Much besought his Guardian Spirit.
    "Lazy Kwasind!" said his mother, 
"In my work you never help me! 
In the Summer you are roaming 
Idly in the fields and forests; 
In the Winter you are cowering 
O'er the firebrands in the wigwam! 
In the coldest days of Winter 
I must break the ice for fishing; 
With my nets you never help me! 
At the door my nets are hanging, 
Dripping, freezing with the water; 
Go and wring them, Yenadizze! 
Go and dry them in the sunshine!"
    Slowly, from the ashes, Kwasind 
Rose, but made no angry answer; 
From the lodge went forth in silence, 
Took the nets, that hung together,
Dripping, freezing at the doorway; 
Like a wisp of straw he wrung them, 
Like a wisp of straw he broke them, 
Could not wring them without breaking, 
Such the strength was in his fingers.
    "Lazy Kwasind!" said his father, 
"In the hunt you never help me; 
Every bow you touch is broken, 
Snapped asunder every arrow; 
Yet come with me to the forest, 
You shall bring the hunting homeward

"
    Down a narrow pass they wandered, 
Where a brooklet led them onward, 
Where the trail of deer and bison 
Marked the soft mud on the margin, 
Till they found all further passage 
Shut against them, barred securely 
By the trunks of trees uprooted, 
Lying lengthwise, lying crosswise, 
And forbidding further passage.
    "We must go back," said the old man, 
"O'er these logs we cannot clamber; 
Not a woodchuck could get through them, 
Not a squirrel clamber o'er them!" 
And straightway his pipe he lighted, 
And sat down to smoke and ponder. 
But before his pipe was finished, 
Lo! the path was cleared before him; 
All the trunks had Kwasind lifted, 
To the right hand, to the left hand, 
Shot the pine-trees swift as arrows, 
Hurled the cedars light as lances.
    "Lazy Kwasind!" said the young men, 
As they sported in the meadow:
"Why stand idly looking at us, 
Leaning on the rock behind you? 
Come and wrestle with the others, 
Let us pitch the quoit together!"
    Lazy Kwasind made no answer, 
To their challenge made no answer, 
Only rose, and slowly turning, 
Seized the huge rock in his fingers, 
Tore it from its deep foundation, 
Poised it in the air a moment, 
Pitched it sheer into the river, 
Sheer into the swift Pauwating, 
Where it still is seen in Summer.
    Once as down that foaming river, 
Down the rapids of Pauwating, 
Kwasind sailed with his companions, 
In the stream he saw a beaver, 
Saw Ahmeek, the King of Beavers, 
Struggling with the rushing currents, 
Rising, sinking in the water.
    Without speaking, without pausing, 
Kwasind leaped into the river, 
Plunged beneath the bubbling surface, 
Through the whirlpools chased the beaver, 
Followed him among the islands, 
Stayed so long beneath the water, 
That his terrified companions 
Cried, "Alas! good-by to Kwasind! 
We shall never more see Kwasind!" 
But he reappeared triumphant, 
And upon his shining shoulders 
Brought the beaver, dead and dripping, 
Brought the King of all the Beavers.
    And these two, as I have told you, 
Were the friends of Hiawatha, 
Chibiabos, the musician, 
And the very strong man, Kwasind. 
Long they lived in peace together, 
Spake with naked hearts together, 
Pondering much and much contriving 
How the tribes of men might prosper. 

In those days the Evil Spirits,
All the Manitos of mischief,
Fearing Hiawatha's wisdom,
And his love for Chibiabos,
Jealous of their faithful friendship,
And their noble words and actions,
Made at length a league against them,
To molest them and destroy them.
    Hiawatha, wise and wary,
Often said to Chibiabos,
"O my brother! do not leave me,
Lest the Evil Spirits harm you!"
Chibiabos, young and heedless,
Laughing shook his coal-black tresses,
Answered ever sweet and childlike,
"Do not fear for me, O brother!
Harm and evil come not near me!"
    Once when Peboan, the Winter,
Roofed with ice the Big-Sea-Water,
When the snow-flakes, whirling downward,
Hissed among the withered oak-leaves,
Changed the pine-trees into wigwams,
Covered all the earth with silence,
Armed with arrows, shod with snow-shoes,
Heeding not his brother's warning,
Fearing not the Evil Spirits,
Forth to hunt the deer with antlers
All alone went Chibiabos.
    Right across the Big-Sea-Water
Sprang with speed the deer before him.
With the wind and snow he followed,
O'er the treacherous ice he followed,
Wild with all the fierce commotion
And the rapture of the hunting.
    But beneath, the Evil Spirits
Lay in ambush, waiting for him,
Broke the treacherous ice beneath him,
Dragged him downward to the bottom,
Buried in the sand his body.
Unktahee, the god of water,
He the god of the Dacotahs,
Drowned him in the deep abysses
Of the lake of Gitche Gumee.
    From the headlands Hiawatha
Sent forth such a wail of anguish,
Such a fearful lamentation,
That the bison paused to listen,
And the wolves howled from the prairies,
And the thunder in the distance
Starting answered "Baim-wawa!"
    Then his face with black he painted,
With his robe his head he covered,
In his wigwam sat lamenting,
Seven long weeks he sat lamenting,
Uttering still this moan of sorrow:
    "He is dead, the sweet musician!
He the sweetest of all singers!
He has gone from us forever,
He has moved a little nearer
To the Master of all music,
To the Master of all singing!
O my brother, Chibiabos!"
    And the melancholy fir-trees
Waved their dark green fans above him,
Waved their purple cones above him,
Sighing with him to console him,
Mingling with his lamentation
Their complaining, their lamenting.
    Came the Spring, and all the forest
Looked in vain for Chibiabos;
Sighed the rivulet, Sebowisha,
Sighed the rushes in the meadow.
    From the tree-tops sang the bluebird,
Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,
"Chibiabos! Chibiabos!
He is dead, the sweet musician!"
    From the wigwam sang the robin,
Sang the robin, the Opechee,
"Chibiabos! Chibiabos!
He is dead, the sweetest singer!"
    And at night through all the forest
Went the whippoorwill complaining,
Wailing went the Wawonaissa,
"Chibiabos! Chibiabos!
He is dead, the sweet musician!
He the sweetest of all singers!"
    Then the Medicine-men, the Medas,
The magicians, the Wabenos,
And the Jossakeeds, the Prophets,
Came to visit Hiawatha;
Built a Sacred Lodge beside him,
To appease him, to console him,
Walked in silent, grave procession,
Bearing each a pouch of healing,
Skin of beaver, lynx, or otter,
Filled with magic roots and simples,
Filled with very potent medicines.
    When he heard their steps approaching~,
Hiawatha ceased lamenting,
Called no more on Chibiabos;
Naught he questioned, naught he answered,
But his mournful head uncovered,
From his face the mourning colors
Washed he slowly and in silence,
Slowly and in silence followed
Onward to the Sacred Wigwam.
    There a magic drink they gave him,
Made of Nahma-wusk, the spearmint,
And Wabeno-wusk, the yarrow,
Roots of power, and herbs of healing;
Beat their drums, and shook their rattles;
Chanted singly and in chorus,
Mystic songs like these, they chanted.
    "I myself, myself! behold me!
`T Is the great Gray Eagle talking;
Come, ye white crows, come and hear him!
The loud-speaking thunder helps me;
All the unseen spirits help me;
I can hear their voices calling,
All around the sky I hear them!
I can blow you strong, my brother,
I can heal you, Hiawatha!"
    "Hi-au-ha!" replied the chorus,
"Wayha-way!" the mystic chorus.
    Friends of mine are all the serpents!
Hear me shake my skin of hen-hawk!
Mahng, the white loon, I can kill him;
I can shoot your heart and kill it!
I can blow you strong, my brother,
I can heal you, Hiawatha !"
    "Hi-au-ha!" replied the chorus,
"Wayhaway!" the mystic chorus.
    "I myself, myself! the prophet!
When I speak the wigwam trembles,
Shakes the Sacred Lodge with terror,
Hands unseen begin to shake it!
When I walk, the sky I tread on
Bends and makes a noise beneath me!
I can blow you strong, my brother!
Rise and speak, O Hiawatha!"
    "Hi-au-ha!" replied the chorus,
"Way-ha-way!" the mystic chorus.
    Then they shook their medicine-pouches
O'er the head of Hiawatha,
Danced their medicine-dance around him;
And upstarting wild and haggard,
Like a man from dreams awakened,
He was healed of all his madness.
As the clouds are swept from heaven,
Straightway from his brain departed
All his moody melancholy;
As the ice is swept from rivers,
Straightway from his heart departed
All his sorrow and affliction.
    Then they summoned Chibiabos
From his grave beneath the waters,
From the sands of Gitche Gumee
Summoned Hiawatha's brother.
And so mighty was the magic
Of that cry and invocation,
That he heard it as he lay there
Underneath the Big-Sea-Water;
From the sand he rose and listened,
Heard the music and the singing,
Came, obedient to the summons,
To the doorway of the wigwam,
But to enter they forbade him.
    Through a chink a coal they gave him,
Through the door a burning fire-brand;
Ruler in the Land of Spirits,
Ruler o'er the dead, they made him,
Telling him a fire to kindle
For all those that died thereafter,
Camp-fires for their night encampments
On their solitary journey
To the kingdom of Ponemah,
To the land of the Hereafter.
    From the village of his childhood,
From the homes of those who knew him,
Passing silent through the forest,
Like a smoke-wreath wafted sideways,
Slowly vanished Chibiabos!
Where he passed, the branches moved not,
Where he trod, the grasses bent not,
And the fallen leaves of last year
Made no sound beneath his footstep.
    Four whole days he journeyed onward
Down the pathway of the dead men;
On the dead-man's strawberry feasted,
Crossed the melancholy river,
On the swinging log he crossed it,
Came unto the Lake of Silver,
In the Stone Canoe was carried
To the Islands of the Blessed,
To the land of ghosts and shadows.
    On that journey, moving slowly,
Many weary spirits saw he,
Panting under heavy burdens,
Laden with war-clubs, bows and arrows,
Robes of fur, and pots and kettles,
And with food that friends had given
For that solitary journey.
    "Ay! why do the living," said they,
"Lay such heavy burdens on us!
Better were it to go naked,
Better were it to go fasting,
Than to bear such heavy burdens
On our long and weary journey!"
Forth then issued Hiawatha,
Wandered eastward, wandered westward,
Teaching men the use of simples
And the antidotes for poisons,
And the cure of all diseases.
Thus was first made known to mortals
All the mystery of Medamin,
All the sacred art of healing

"Give me of your bark, O Birch-tree! 
Of your yellow bark, O Birch-tree! 
Growing by the rushing river, 
Tall and stately in the valley! 
I a light canoe will build me, 
Build a swift Cheemaun for sailing, 
That shall float on the river, 
Like a yellow leaf in Autumn, 
Like a yellow water-lily!
    "Lay aside your cloak, O Birch-tree! 
Lay aside your white-skin wrapper, 
For the Summer-time is coming, 
And the sun is warm in heaven, 
And you need no white-skin wrapper!"
    Thus aloud cried Hiawatha 
In the solitary forest, 
By the rushing Taquamenaw, 
When the birds were singing gayly, 
In the Moon of Leaves were singing, 
And the sun, from sleep awaking, 
Started up and said, "Behold me! 
Gheezis, the great Sun, behold me!"
    And the tree with all its branches 
Rustled in the breeze of morning, 
Saying, with a sigh of patience, 
"Take my cloak, O Hiawatha!"
    With his knife the tree he girdled; 
Just beneath its lowest branches, 
Just above the roots, he cut it, 
Till the sap came oozing outward;
Down the trunk, from top to bottom, 
Sheer he cleft the bark asunder, 
With a wooden wedge he raised it, 
Stripped it from the trunk unbroken.
    "Give me of your boughs, O Cedar! 
Of your strong and pliant branches, 
My canoe to make more steady, 
Make more strong and firm beneath me!"
    Through the summit of the Cedar 
Went a sound, a cry of horror, 
Went a murmur of resistance; 
But it whispered, bending downward, 
'Take my boughs, O Hiawatha!"
    Down he hewed the boughs of cedar, 
Shaped them straightway to a frame-work, 
Like two bows he formed and shaped them, 
Like two bended bows together.
    "Give me of your roots, O Tamarack! 
Of your fibrous roots, O Larch-tree! 
My canoe to bind together, 
So to bind the ends together 
That the water may not enter, 
That the river may not wet me!"
    And the Larch, with all its fibres, 
Shivered in the air of morning, 
Touched his forehead with its tassels, 
Slid, with one long sigh of sorrow. 
"Take them all, O Hiawatha!"
    From the earth he tore the fibres, 
Tore the tough roots of the Larch-tree, 
Closely sewed the hark together, 
Bound it closely to the frame-work.
    "Give me of your balm, O Fir-tree! 
Of your balsam and your resin, 
So to close the seams together 
That the water may not enter, 
That the river may not wet me!"
    And the Fir-tree, tall and sombre, 
Sobbed through all its robes of darkness, 
Rattled like a shore with pebbles, 
Answered wailing, answered weeping, 
"Take my balm, O Hiawatha!"
    And he took the tears of balsam, 
Took the resin of the Fir-tree, 
Smeared therewith each seam and fissure, 
Made each crevice safe from water.
    "Give me of your quills, O Hedgehog! 
All your quills, O Kagh, the Hedgehog! 
I will make a necklace of them, 
Make a girdle for my beauty, 
And two stars to deck her bosom!"
    From a hollow tree the Hedgehog 
With his sleepy eyes looked at him, 
Shot his shining quills, like arrows, 
Saying with a drowsy murmur, 
Through the tangle of his whiskers, 
"Take my quills, O Hiawatha!"
    From the ground the quills he gathered, 
All the little shining arrows, 
Stained them red and blue and yellow, 
With the juice of roots and berries; 
Into his canoe he wrought them, 
Round its waist a shining girdle, 
Round its bows a gleaming necklace, 
On its breast two stars resplendent.
    Thus the Birch Canoe was builded 
In the valley, by the river,
In the bosom of the forest; 
And the forest's life was in it, 
All its mystery and its magic, 
All the lightness of the birch-tree, 
All the toughness of the cedar, 
All the larch's supple sinews; 
And it floated on the river 
Like a yellow leaf in Autumn, 
Like a yellow water-lily.
    Paddles none had Hiawatha, 
Paddles none he had or needed, 
For his thoughts as paddles served him, 
And his wishes served to guide him;
Swift or slow at will he glided, 
Veered to right or left at pleasure.
    Then he called aloud to Kwasind, 
To his friend, the strong man, Kwasind, 
Saying, "Help me clear this river 
Of its sunken logs and sand-bars

"
    Straight into the river Kwasind 
Plunged as if he were an otter, 
Dived as if he were a beaver, 
Stood up to his waist in water, 
To his arm-pits in the river, 
Swam and scouted in the river, 
Tugged at sunken logs and branches, 
With his hands he scooped the sand-bars, 
With his feet the ooze and tangle.
    And thus sailed my Hiawatha 
Down the rushing Taquamenaw, 
Sailed through all its bends and windings, 
Sailed through all its deeps and shallows, 
While his friend, the strong man, Kwasind, 
Swam the deeps, the shallows waded.
    Up and down the river went they, 
In and out among its islands, 
Cleared its bed of root and sand-bar, 
Dragged the dead trees from its channel, 
Made its passage safe and certain, 
Made a pathway for the people, 
From its springs among the mountains, 
To the waters of Pauwating, 
To the bay of Taquamenaw. 

How the handsome Yenadizze 
Danced at Hiawatha's wedding; 
How the gentle Chibiabos, 
He the sweetest of musicians, 
Sang his songs of love and longing; 
How Iagoo, the great boaster, 
He the marvellous story-teller, 
Told his tales of strange adventure, 
That the feast might be more joyous, 
That the time might pass more gayly, 
And the guests be more contented.
    Sumptuous was the feast Nokomis 
Made at Hiawatha's wedding; 
All the bowls were made of bass-wood, 
White and polished very smoothly, 
All the spoons of horn of bison, 
Black and polished very smoothly.
    She had sent through all the village 
Messengers with wands of willow, 
As a sign of invitation,
As a token of the feasting;
And the wedding guests assembled, 
Clad in all their richest raiment, 
Robes of fur and belts of wampum, 
Splendid with their paint and plumage, 
Beautiful with beads and tassels.
    First they ate the sturgeon, Nahma, 
And the pike, the Maskenozha, 
Caught and cooked by old Nokomis; 
Then on pemican they feasted, 
Pemican and buffalo marrow, 
Haunch of deer and hump of bison, 
Yellow cakes of the Mondamin, 
And the wild rice of the river.
    But the gracious Hiawatha, 
And the lovely Laughing Water, 
And the careful old Nokomis, 
Tasted not the food before them, 
Only waited on the others
Only served their guests in silence.
    And when all the guests had finished, 
Old Nokomis, brisk and busy, 
From an ample pouch of otter, 
Filled the red-stone pipes for smoking 
With tobacco from the South-land, 
Mixed with bark of the red willow, 
And with herbs and leaves of fragrance.
Dance for us your merry dances, 
Dance the Beggar's Dance to please us, 
That the feast may be more joyous, 
That the time may pass more gayly, 
And our guests be more contented!"
He the idle Yenadizze, 
He the merry mischief-maker, 
Whom the people called the Storm-Fool, 
Rose among the guests assembled.
    Skilled was he in sports and pastimes, 
In the merry dance of snow-shoes, 
In the play of quoits and ball-play; 
Skilled was he in games of hazard, 
In all games of skill and hazard, 
Pugasaing, the Bowl and Counters, 
Kuntassoo, the Game of Plum-stones. 
Though the warriors called him Faint-Heart, 
Called him coward, Shaugodaya, 
Idler, gambler, Yenadizze,
Little heeded he their jesting, 
Little cared he for their insults, 
For the women and the maidens 
    He was dressed in shirt of doeskin, 
White and soft, and fringed with ermine, 
All inwrought with beads of wampum; 
He was dressed in deer-skin leggings,
Fringed with hedgehog quills and ermine, 
And in moccasins of buck-skin, 
Thick with quills and beads embroidered. 
On his head were plumes of swan's down, 
On his heels were tails of foxes, 
In one hand a fan of feathers, 
And a pipe was in the other.
    Barred with streaks of red and yellow, 
Streaks of blue and bright vermilion, 
From his forehead fell his tresses, 
Smooth, and parted like a woman's, 
Shining bright with oil, and plaited, 
Hung with braids of scented grasses,
As among the guests assembled, 
To the sound of flutes and singing, 
To the sound of drums and voices, 
And began his mystic dances.
    First he danced a solemn measure, 
Very slow in step and gesture, 
In and out among the pine-trees, 
Through the shadows and the sunshine, 
Treading softly like a panther. 
Then more swiftly and still swifter, 
Whirling, spinning round in circles, 
Leaping o'er the guests assembled, 
Eddying round and round the wigwam, 
Till the leaves went whirling with him, 
Till the dust and wind together 
Swept in eddies round about him.
    Then along the sandy margin 
Of the lake, the Big-Sea-Water, 
On he sped with frenzied gestures,
Stamped upon the sand, and tossed it 
Wildly in the air around him; 
Till the wind became a whirlwind, 
Till the sand was blown and sifted 
Like great snowdrifts o'er the landscape, 
Heaping all the shores with Sand Dunes, 
Sand Hills of the Nagow Wudjoo!
Danced his Beggar's Dance to please them, 
And, returning, sat down laughing 
There among the guests assembled, 
Sat and fanned himself serenely 
With his fan of turkey-feathers.
    Then they said to Chibiabos, 
To the friend of Hiawatha, 
To the sweetest of all singers, 
To the best of all musicians, 
"Sing to us, O Chibiabos! 
Songs of love and songs of longing, 
That the feast may be more joyous, 
That the time may pass more gayly, 
And our guests be more contented!"
    And the gentle Chibiabos 
Sang in accents sweet and tender, 
Sang in tones of deep emotion, 
Songs of love and songs of longing; 
Looking still at Hiawatha, 
Looking at fair Laughing Water, 
Sang he softly, sang in this wise:
    "Onaway! Awake, beloved! 
Thou the wild-flower of the forest! 
Thou the wild-bird of the prairie! 
Thou with eyes so soft and fawn-like!
    "If thou only lookest at me, 
I am happy, I am happy, 
As the lilies of the prairie, 
When they feel the dew upon them!
    "Sweet thy breath is as the fragrance 
Of the wild-flowers in the morning, 
As their fragrance is at evening, 
In the Moon when leaves are falling.
    "Does not all the blood within me 
Leap to meet thee, leap to meet thee, 
As the springs to meet the sunshine, 
In the Moon when nights are brightest?
    "Onaway! my heart sings to thee, 
Sings with joy when thou art near me, 
As the sighing, singing branches 
In the pleasant Moon of Strawberries!
    "When thou art not pleased, beloved, 
Then my heart is sad and darkened, 
As the shining river darkens 
When the clouds drop shadows on it!
    "When thou smilest, my beloved, 
Then my troubled heart is brightened, 
As in sunshine gleam the ripples 
That the cold wind makes in rivers.
    "Smiles the earth, and smile the waters, 
Smile the cloudless skies above us, 
But I lose the way of smiling 
When thou art no longer near me!
    "I myself, myself! behold me! 
Blood of my beating heart, behold me! 
Oh awake, awake, beloved! 
Onaway! awake, beloved!"
    Thus the gentle Chibiabos 
Sang his song of love and longing; 
And Iagoo, the great boaster, 
He the marvellous story-teller, 
He the friend of old Nokomis, 
Jealous of the sweet musician, 
Jealous of the applause they gave him, 
Saw in all the eyes around him, 
Saw in all their looks and gestures, 
That the wedding guests assembled
Longed to hear his pleasant stories, 
His immeasurable falsehoods.
    Very boastful was Iagoo; 
Never heard he an adventure 
But himself had met a greater; 
Never any deed of daring 
But himself had done a bolder; 
Never any marvellous story 
But himself could tell a stranger.
    Would you listen to his boasting, 
Would you only give him credence, 
No one ever shot an arrow 
Half so far and high as he had; 
Ever caught so many fishes, 
Ever killed so many reindeer, 
Ever trapped so many beaver!
    None could run so fast as he could, 
None could dive so deep as he could, 
None could swim so far as he could; 
None had made so many journeys, 
None had seen so many wonders, 
As this wonderful Iagoo,
As this marvellous story-teller! 
Thus his name became a by-word
And a jest among the people; 
And whene'er a boastful hunter 
Praised his own address too highly, 
Or a warrior, home returning, 
Talked too much of his achievements, 
All his hearers cried, "Iagoo! 
Here's Iagoo come among us!"
    He it was who carved the cradle 
Of the little Hiawatha, 
Carved its framework out of linden, 
Bound it strong with reindeer sinews; 
He it was who taught him later 
How to make his bows and arrows, 
How to make the bows of ash-tree,
And the arrows of the oak-tree. 
So among the guests assembled 
At my Hiawatha's wedding 
Sat Iagoo, old and ugly, 
Sat the marvellous story-teller.
    And they said, "O good Iagoo, 
Tell us now a tale of wonder, 
Tell us of some strange adventure, 
That the feast may be more joyous, 
That the time may pass more gayly, 
And our guests be more contented!"
    And Iagoo answered straightway, 
"You shall hear a tale of wonder, 
You shall hear the strange adventures
Of Osseo, the Magician,
From the Evening Star descending

""As unto the bow the cord is, 
So unto the man is woman; 
Though she bends him, she obeys him, 
Though she draws him, yet she follows; 
Useless each without the other!"
    Thus the youthful Hiawatha 
Said within himself and pondered, 
Much perplexed by various feelings, 
Listless, longing, hoping, fearing, 
Dreaming still of Minnehaha, 
Of the lovely Laughing Water, 
In the land of the Dacotahs.
    "Wed a maiden of your people," 
Warning said the old Nokomis; 
"Go not eastward, go not westward, 
For a stranger, whom we know not! 
Like a fire upon the hearth-stone 
Is a neighbor's homely daughter, 
Like the starlight or the moonlight 
Is the handsomest of strangers!"
    Thus dissuading spake Nokomis, 
And my Hiawatha answered 
Only this: "Dear old Nokomis,
Very pleasant is the firelight, 
But I like the starlight better, 
Better do I like the moonlight!"
    Gravely then said old Nokomis: 
"Bring not here an idle maiden, 
Bring not here a useless woman, 
Hands unskilful, feet unwilling; 
Bring a wife with nimble fingers, 
Heart and hand that move together, 
Feet that run on willing errands!"
    Smiling answered Hiawatha: 
'In the land of the Dacotahs 
Lives the Arrow-maker's daughter, 
Minnehaha, Laughing Water, 
Handsomest of all the women. 
I will bring her to your wigwam, 
She shall run upon your errands, 
Be your starlight, moonlight, firelight, 
Be the sunlight of my people!"
    Still dissuading said Nokomis: 
"Bring not to my lodge a stranger 
From the land of the Dacotahs! 
Very fierce are the Dacotahs, 
Often is there war between us, 
There are feuds yet unforgotten, 
Wounds that ache and still may open!"
    Laughing answered Hiawatha: 
"For that reason, if no other, 
Would I wed the fair Dacotah, 
That our tribes might be united, 
That old feuds might be forgotten, 
And old wounds be healed forever!"
    Thus departed Hiawatha 
To the land of the Dacotahs, 
To the land of handsome women; 
Striding over moor and meadow, 
Through interminable forests, 
Through uninterrupted silence.
    With his moccasins of magic, 
At each stride a mile he measured; 
Yet the way seemed long before him, 
And his heart outran his footsteps; 
And he journeyed without resting, 
Till he heard the cataract's laughter, 
Heard the Falls of Minnehaha 
Calling to him through the silence. 
"Pleasant is the sound!" he murmured, 
"Pleasant is the voice that calls me!"
    On the outskirts of the forests, 
'Twixt the shadow and the sunshine, 
Herds of fallow deer were feeding, 
But they saw not Hiawatha; 
To his bow he whispered, "Fail not!"
To his arrow whispered, "Swerve not!" 
Sent it singing on its errand,
To the red heart of the roebuck; 
Threw the deer across his shoulder, 
And sped forward without pausing.
    At the doorway of his wigwam 
Sat the ancient Arrow-maker, 
In the land of the Dacotahs,
Making arrow-heads of jasper,
Arrow-heads of chalcedony.
At his side, in all her beauty, 
Sat the lovely Minnehaha, 
Sat his daughter, Laughing Water, 
Plaiting mats of flags and rushes
Of the past the old man's thoughts were, 
And the maiden's of the future.
    He was thinking, as he sat there, 
Of the days when with such arrows 
He had struck the deer and bison, 
On the Muskoday, the meadow; 
Shot the wild goose, flying southward 
On the wing, the clamorous Wawa; 
Thinking of the great war-parties,
How they came to buy his arrows, 
Could not fight without his arrows. 
Ah, no more such noble warriors 
Could be found on earth as they were! 
Now the men were all like women, 
Only used their tongues for weapons!
    She was thinking of a hunter, 
From another tribe and country, 
Young and tall and very handsome, 
Who one morning, in the Spring-time, 
Came to buy her father's arrows, 
Sat and rested in the wigwam, 
Lingered long about the doorway, 
Looking back as he departed. 
She had heard her father praise him, 
Praise his courage and his wisdom; 
Would he come again for arrows 
To the Falls of Minnehaha?
On the mat her hands lay idle, 
And her eyes were very dreamy.
    Through their thoughts they heard a footstep, 
Heard a rustling in the branches, 
And with glowing cheek and forehead, 
With the deer upon his shoulders, 
Suddenly from out the woodlands 
Hiawatha stood before them.
    Straight the ancient Arrow-maker 
Looked up gravely from his labor, 
Laid aside the unfinished arrow, 
Bade him enter at the doorway, 
Saying, as he rose to meet him, 
'Hiawatha, you are welcome!"
    At the feet of Laughing Water 
Hiawatha laid his burden, 
Threw the red deer from his shoulders; 
And the maiden looked up at him, 
Looked up from her mat of rushes,
Said with gentle look and accent, 
"You are welcome, Hiawatha!"
    Very spacious was the wigwam, 
Made of deer-skins dressed and whitened, 
Drawn and painted on its curtains, 
And so tall the doorway, hardly 
Hiawatha stooped to enter, 
Hardly touched his eagle-feathers 
As he entered at the doorway.
    Then uprose the Laughing Water, 
From the ground fair Minnehaha, 
Laid aside her mat unfinished, 
Brought forth food and set before them, 
Water brought them from the brooklet, 
Gave them food in earthen vessels, 
Gave them drink in bowls of bass-wood, 
Listened while the guest was speaking, 
Listened while her father answered, 
But not once her lips she opened, 
Not a single word she uttered.
    Yes, as in a dream she listened 
To the words of Hiawatha, 
As he talked of old Nokomis, 
Who had nursed him in his childhood, 
As he told of his companions, 
Chibiabos, the musician, 
And the very strong man, Kwasind, 
And of happiness and plenty 
In the land of the Ojibways, 
In the pleasant land and peaceful.
    "After many years of warfare, 
Many years of strife and bloodshed, 
There is peace between the Ojibways 
And the tribe of the Dacotahs
 

Thus continued Hiawatha, 
And then added, speaking slowly, 
"That this peace may last forever,
And our hands be clasped more closely, 
And our hearts be more united, 
Give me as my wife this maiden, 
Minnehaha, Laughing Water, 
Loveliest of Dacotah women!"
    And the ancient Arrow-maker 
Paused a moment ere he answered, 
Smoked a little while in silence, 
Looked at Hiawatha proudly, 
Fondly looked at Laughing Water, 
And made answer very gravely: 
"Yes, if Minnehaha wishes; 
Let your heart speak, Minnehaha!"
    And the lovely Laughing Water 
Seemed more lovely as she stood there, 
Neither willing nor reluctant, 
As she went to Hiawatha, 
Softly took the seat beside him, 
While she said, and blushed to say it, 
"I will follow you, my husband!"
    This was Hiawatha's wooing! 
Thus it was he won the daughter 
Of the ancient Arrow-maker, 
In the land of the Dacotahs!
    From the wigwam he departed, 
Leading with him Laughing Water; 
Hand in hand they went together, 
Through the woodland and the meadow, 
Left the old man standing lonely 
At the doorway of his wigwam, 
Heard the Falls of Minnehaha 
Calling to them from the distance, 
Crying to them from afar off, 
"Fare thee well, O Minnehaha!"
    And the ancient Arrow-maker 
Turned again unto his labor, 
Sat down by his sunny doorway, 
Murmuring to himself, and saying:
"Thus it is our daughters leave us, 
Those we love, and those who love us! 
Just when they have learned to help us, 
When we are old and lean upon them, 
Comes a youth with flaunting feathers, 
With his flute of reeds, a stranger 
Wanders piping through the village, 
Beckons to the fairest maiden, 
And she follows where he leads her, 
Leaving all things for the stranger!"
    Pleasant was the journey homeward, 
Through interminable forests, 
Over meadow, over mountain, 
Over river, hill, and hollow. 
Short it seemed to Hiawatha, 
Though they journeyed very slowly, 
Though his pace he checked and slackened 
To the steps of Laughing Water.
    Over wide and rushing rivers 
In his arms he bore the maiden; 
Light he thought her as a feather, 
As the plume upon his head-gear; 
Cleared the tangled pathway for her, 
Bent aside the swaying branches, 
Made at night a lodge of branches, 
And a bed with boughs of hemlock, 
And a fire before the doorway 
With the dry cones of the pine-tree.
    All the travelling winds went with them, 
O'er the meadows, through the forest; 
All the stars of night looked at them, 
Watched with sleepless eyes their slumber; 
From his ambush in the oak-tree 
Peeped the squirrel, Adjidaumo, 
Watched with eager eyes the lovers; 
And the rabbit, the Wabasso, 
Scampered from the path before them, 
Peering, peeping from his burrow,
Sat erect upon his haunches, 
Watched with curious eyes the lovers.
    Pleasant was the journey homeward! 
All the birds sang loud and sweetly 
Songs of happiness and heart's-ease; 
Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa, 
"Happy are you, Hiawatha, 
Having such a wife to love you!" 
Sang the robin, the Opechee, 
"Happy are you, Laughing Water, 
Having such a noble husband!"
    From the sky the sun benignant 
Looked upon them through the branches, 
Saying to them, "O my children, 
Love is sunshine, hate is shadow, 
Life is checkered shade and sunshine, 
Rule by love, O Hiawatha!"
    From the sky the moon looked at them, 
Filled the lodge with mystic splendors, 
Whispered to them, "O my children, 
Day is restless, night is quiet, 
Man imperious, woman feeble; 
Half is mine, although I follow; 
Rule by patience, Laughing Water!"
    Thus it was they journeyed homeward; 
Thus it was that Hiawatha 
To the lodge of old Nokomis 
Brought the moonlight, starlight, firelight, 
Brought the sunshine of his people, 
Minnehaha, Laughing Water, 
Handsomest of all the women 
In the land of the Dacotahs, 
In the land of handsome women. 

Hibiscus Flowers where ever I look, 
Reds and blues and the pretty white, 
Freshly taken from a picture book, 
They fill me with great delight.
Indoor Hibiscus Flowers delicate yellow, 
Potted plants in my snug flat, 
Great beauty that turns me mellow, 
To all Gardeners I take off my hat.
The hibiscus is a flower to please, 
Grown in a warm and temperate clime.
Reds, blues and whites do tease, 
With glowing colours so sublime. 

Red Hibiscus cheers
At dawn in an earthen pot; 
By dusk, smile wiped off.  

Hickies hickies
on my chest
Hickies hickies 
on my breast
I have hickies on my thigh
i hide my hickies
with makeup
so no one will know that im a slut.
slut slut with no morals.
 i f*** f*** everyone 
im a slut slut 
just ask anyone
hickies hickies 
tell my story
how im a slut slut
with no glory.



Hickling Broad. Among the reeds
the wind pipes Für Elise, Für Elise, 
crossing the water by the boat's prow.
Ruddy and gregarious the pubs glow

and there holidaymakers flee; 
then below decks to cramps and silences, 
away from the gauze curtain of rain
passing sideways in the night.

No sap in the hollow reeds
attenuates the wind's tune.
Wild duck, moorhen, rising fish
need no companion.

Blows storm a boy's heart, 
bent by a prevailing wind.
Ebbing and echoing the wind breathes
Für Elise, Für Elise among the reeds. 

If you place a fern
under a stone
the next day it will be
nearly invisible
as if the stone has 
swallowed it.

If you tuck the name of a loved one
under your tongue too long
without speaking it
it becomes blood
sigh
the little sucked-in breath of air
hiding everywhere
beneath your words.

No one sees
the fuel that feeds you.




From the pain, there came a life
From the darkness, a light appeared
Through the tears, the joy is exposed
Now two people, unite as one

Through the crying, I hear life
Among the screaming, sweet music fills my ears
From the trembling, I feel the warmth
This little wonder, equals one big family


Around the atlas
I wandered
Indulging in my quest for beauty
Soulful sunrise-
Shimmering sunset-
Sizzling snowfall-
Ravishing rainfall-
Gorgeous glaciers-
Mystery mountains-
Fabulous forests-
Nature at its best
Ever beautiful
I think deep
To find
The most beautiful of them all
No surprise- its a woman! 
Hidden beauty
Unveiled danger. 

When the white man first visited
our ancestors saw images in mirrors
not reflections from serene pools
when their ripples were bisected
all their mirth turned into terrors
too late, they were taken for fools

ignorance of science is paranormal
our old native teleportation is fetish
for we lack repertoire of its registers 
under unfamiliar terrains so informal
our trickery is black magical pettish
 not insipidities in quantum canisters
 
before science was the paranormal 
pints of matter absorbed its energy
on the shores of its relativity’s void
manifested what is perceived normal
in its no-cloning theorem of synergy 
to hide the supernatural they  avoid.




Ashes melt down her skin
For forces unforeseen
Never did the vibrations awake
The small town head of hers
Innocence concealed in shadows
Pressure that built up under the blinds of sight
Created a painting flashing only a stationary object
Like a pendulum without a motion

At eruptions peak
Was when all collapsed
Light evaporated into thin air
Emotions burst onto an open screen
Washing the painting away like Northern lights
A transforming picture from straight to bent
Leaving her heart restlessly dormant


White Water in Lake
Melting color creates waves 
Flocking hidden fish


I hid the love within my heart, 
And lit the laughter in my eyes, 
That when we meet he may not know 
My love that never dies.

But sometimes when he dreams at night 
Of fragrant forests green and dim, 
It may be that my love crept out 
And brought the dream to him.

And sometimes when his heart is sick 
And suddenly grows well again, 
It may be that my love was there 
To free his life of pain. 

HIDDEN LOVE
The love that's burning inside my heart
That I never expressed 
My breath is you
It flows in and out of me
My eyes swallow you to my heart
Every time I see you 
My mouth talks to my heart so much about you
But never tried to share it with you
I know I can control my emotions
I have no clue why I work so hard to control
I do know Love can never be hidden
Even silence can speak it out.
If only you can see deep into me
You will find yourself inside my heart
I love you very secretly in depth


The gentle breeze as messenger 
whispered the words on thy beloved's ears 
And make that soulful dream, not fancy 
Into the heart of reality
.

On my window the half sung lyric
In shyness when the beloved hid
I take the song from your lips
To the heart a song of love
When I read your eyes speak
A blush on the cheek as I touch
The hands for the ways open
The messenger the breeze giggling
Like lark sing again the broken song
O gentle breeze for the sick of love
Bring a message to rise again
When door I have not neither a drape
How thou say thou shy to enter
Nothing shalt thou find but a rug
On earth when in my arms I hold
To the heaven not nor a fancy
Hidden sighs but behold my love
In lovers paradise I live but a candle
In slow demise while I lit the darkness
My father gets the wooden stick
he counts from five
i run and hide. 

My father is coming with the wooden stick
he counts from four
i close my bedroom door. 

My father is looking for me with the wooden stick
he counts from three
as he searches for me. 

My father is close by with the wooden stick
he counts from two
my face turns blue. 

My father is right next to me
with the wooden stick
he counts from one
now i'm done. 

My father finds me
with the wooden stick
he counts from zero
.  

yes i know, i'm in trouble. 

My father says
'there you are! 
i found you
now it's your turn to count
and my turn to hide'
.  

and the game continued.  

We were together
in a mail-box, 
though stayed aloof
but I knew you are
my dear neighbor.
when I felt alone
and desperately
wanted your face, 
opening the door
I wished to give
you my caress.
Thus we played, 
you appeared to 
make me disappear.
Masquerade! 
you danced 
behind a mask, 
I found you out.
I stretched my hands, 
but shockingly I 
saw she wasn't you
another revered guy.
It happened time and again.
Hide and seek, 
play, play with me, 
and never bid good bye. 

It was funny in my childhood to be missing.
Hardly anyone is there  who is never lost
Hardly anyone is there who has never l come back.
Likewise playing such hide and seek game
We are grown.
Last year the school   building was drifting away in the flood water
Crops    over flown and destroyed   because of whirlpool.
And the blood was shed abundantly in the huts 
 Recently   a few girls  were secretly sent to the occident
And suddenly a violent outbreak of cholera depopulated the villages.
 Seeing  the green  leaf on the alluvium land 
We   are  recognized  ourselves and promise
There  will be commissioned  a festival
In the month of harvest—to my sister

Because the moon in late October made landmarks glow: the broken
     gate, our yard

full of stones, the attic window

suddenly foreign, across its face
a blue dissolve. In spite of that, the farm

remained an arrangement (barn
behind the house, pond
across the road) and a girl sometimes

feels torn. We turned our dresses inside out,
ran into a grove. We played

you're blind, Molly, try to find me.
It was a family game: get left

in darkness. I climbed
up into the oak, listened for your voice
until my name became 

a sound from the other side, from the poor
order of the world. I came back

because I had to. And believe me, you who are fragile 
and so faithful, I hated to return

materializing through trees. 

I use to sit there
in the very back of your closet.
I knew nobody would look for me.
I'd just sit there
and smell your new clothes
and cry.

It didn't seem fair
why I had one pair of pants
and three shirts
(that rarely saw a washing machine) .

I know you said you ''needed'' them.
You had to look good
at the bar.
After all, why would I need new clothes? 
I never went anywhere. 
except school.

And they wondered why 
I wouldn't talk to people.
Even the ''retarded'' girl
told me I was weird.

I still don't like shopping
for myself.

I never want them to feel
the way I did
while I was hiding in that closet. 

Hiding in this cage
of visible matter

is the invisible
lifebird

pay attention
to her

she is singing
your song


Pride is something hard to mend
Wounded heart bleeding no one to lend
Reaching out, explained. 
Seems no one to listen, blows like a wind..

Speaking loud  in a quiet  night
Stand what i fight
Stick what it might 
For I believe i never step on other's right.


Head bowed but never yield
Bamboos bend in strong wind but remain on field
Rain-storm  covered clouds
Mountain & hills remain proud..


You put me on the pedestal
Hold tight breaks my petal
Nearby, gaze every make every take
scattered into a tiny flakes..


Lonely I am 
no one can see no one knows
Even i won't give a clue
In silence i cry.. 

i moan
I fake a smile laugh alone. 

lonely
happy
empty
living solo
No one can see
no one knows
Even won't give a clue
feigned a smile laugh from a mile
or standing alone 
in the crowd like a clown.. 

It is been long long while, 
And the pain still remain inside, 
A broken and shattered part of me.
Silence echoes my pain, hiding alone. 

grey shaded life 
now consuming 
hiding inside 
true shaded 
skin of life 

usually it seems 
like ass grazing 
callously 
on the meadows

even no burdens
have been packed 
to carry along 

it's a nice state 
of living and non-living
only the grey shade of life 
sometimes knocking
to slough 
yet true shade 
trying hard 
to keep close to it! 



Deep dark memories, 
Hiding them is almost impossible, 
Still to others I seem confident, 
Maybe even unstoppable.

So how could it be, 
That the only thing they see, 
Is the fake and mask of me? 

Am I becoming what I fear, 
The one that cries tear after tear, 
Alone in the dark with no goals to clear.
That will go on year after year? 

So how will it go, 
When I'm just laying low, 
And the time passes very slow? 

Did I make the wrong decision, 
Have I made a big mistake, 
Do I have to go on like this, 
Or do I have to change for my own sake? 

So how should I react, 
When there is no clear effect, 
And no insurance or a fact

I'm dancing on the ceiling, 
dancing fast and free.
I'm without a partner, 
will you dance with me? 

I'm higher than the ceiling, 
I'm floating in the sky.
I will be your partner
and teach you how to fly.


race through the mind, 
colors dancing, wheeling, 
lights spinning, lost control.
violent disregard for self, 
floating out the window, 
falling through life, 
wasted.


"Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings; 
Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
of sun-split clouds, -and done a hundred things
You have not dreamed of-wheeled and soared and swung
High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there, 
I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung
My eager craft through footless halls of air
Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
Where never lark nor even eagle flew-
And, while with silent lifting mind I've trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space, "
I raced and touched the shadows of  Grace.





Kuen had been apprehended and arrested
Shortly after nine by the department of Homeland Security 
Caught cashing my checks from the Mexican government, 
 Using an illegal immigrant’s photo ID for proof of citizenship.

With most all of my autobiographical accounts overdrawn
"Insufficient funds" due to a liberal sense of entitlement
On the part of left wing politics, and subjugated to prosecution of fraud. 
Dante wrote me that Hell had frozen over, 
And he had moved to Miami to be closer to his dead mother.

Death was looking attractive as 
Eighteen year old virgins talked of their affairs
While wearing their public nudity, like warrants
Arresting me, and tempting me with the suicidal promises
Of four hour erections, 
And an elongated epic for better penetration. 

I was sure I wanted to die, as my world was empty and I was alone-
When I heard that little voice in my head say
"Killing yourself because no one understands you is rubbish, 
If you kill yourself, do it because everybody is on to you."

 
Single wing aeroplanes, 
two and four seaters, 
either open engines, or open under your seat.

Exciting for a seventeen year old.

I went up with the commercial pilots, 
logging up their flying hours.

Take off!  Climb!  Spin on one wing! 
Roll! - 'keep looking forward! ', 
Stall! - That was the most terrifying thing of all, 
not knowing whether the engine would start firing up again.
There were no parachutes, of course.

Flying along the south coast of England, 
around the Isle of Wight, 
looking down on a 'patchwork' of fields, farms, 
towns and villages, 
all viewed in 'miniature'.

Those were the days when one felt immortal, 
and there was something very romantic
about pilots who flew beyond the clouds.

That death defying, daredevil image.

Somehow, you didn't seem to suffer from nerves
when you were only seventeen, you just had an appetite
to sample the great, unknown, blue yonder.

Now I prefer to have my feet planted firmly on terra firma.

But Oh! those times when I was once a 'High Flyer'.
What memories! 



through winter
with its painful
windows of hard frost, 
the fire in th grate
empty with dead ash, 
to see blood buds break. 
springing out of
hard pruned punishment
into hopeful glory
of future summer roses
on our pallid, sorry cheeks. 

High in the air exposed the slave is hung, 
To all the birds of heaven, their living food! 
He groans not, though awaked by that fierce sun 
New torturers live to drink their parent blood; 
He groans not, though the gorging vulture tear 
The quivering fiber. Hither look, O ye 
Who tore this man from peace and liberty! 
Look hither, ye who weigh with politic care 
The gain against the guilt! Beyond the grave 
There is another world: bear ye in mind, 
Ere your decree proclaims to all mankind 
The gain is worth the guilt, that there the Slave, 
Before the Eternal, "thunder-tongued shall plead 
Against the deep damnation of your deed. 

High school the worst thing ever! 
I wouldn't wish for it. Never.
Take me from this stink bucket.
I can't take it! 

Why did anyone ever invent this? 
Why would anyone find this as bliss? 
High school, 
it's not cool.

Goodness grief what's up with the homework! 
Maybe some of us just want just want to turn up and twerk! 
This is a heck load to do I need a break! 
This is to much, for goodness sakes

Bravo, You Speed Reader! 
Wow! Eighty four thousand in seven days
Which, brakes down to, in equity terms 
On the average, twelve thousand a day, 
Of eight incessant hours, let us say 

Fifteen hundred an hour, 
Twenty five a minute, for sure! 
This implies, in numerical term
Two and half seconds only, for a poem

In conclusion, READING an average poem 
Before you snap your fingers, thrice; my Chum 
Incredible and unimaginable to most
Yet, it seems peanuts to D. 

I. 

Aceves! 
Congratulations

L’invito per quel tardo pomeriggio
Ti colse di sorpresa e ti facesti trascinare
Controvoglia.
Immaginasti un high tea dall’ovattata
Fragranza di burro e gelsomino, con spigolosi
Sorrisi di cortesia e sguardi acconciati di
Banale curiosità
Sotto un’improbabile luce al neon.
In realtà ti attendeva un respiro diverso
Nel boudoir dagli stucchi leggeri
Galleggianti sulla volta a cupola.
Un respiro colorato dello stesso arancio
Premurosamente appassito del
Tramonto.

Ma insostanziale come quello. 

High waving heather 'neath stormy blasts bending, 
Midnight and moonlight and bright shining stars, 
Darkness and glory rejoicingly blending, 
Earth rising to heaven and heaven descending, 
Man's spirit away from its drear dungeon sending, 
Bursting the fetters and breaking the bars.

All down the mountain sides wild forests lending 
One mighty voice to the life-giving wind, 
Rivers their banks in their jubilee rending, 
Fast through the valleys a reckless course wending, 
Wider and deeper their waters extending, 
Leaving a desolate desert behind.

Shining and lowering and swelling and dying, 
Changing forever from midnight to noon; 
Roaring like thunder, like soft music sighing, 
Shadows on shadows advancing and flying, 
Lighning-bright flashes the deep gloom defying, 
Coming as swiftly and fading as soon. 

Unto his housemaid spoke the Laird:
"Tonight the Bishop is our guest;
The spare room must be warmed and aired:
To please him we will do our best.
A worthy haggis you must make,
And serve a bowl of barley bree;
We must be hearty for the sake
Of Highland Hospitality.

The feast was set, the candles lit,
The Bishop came with modest mien,
And (one surmised) was glad to sit
And sup in this ancestral scene.
A noble haggis graced the board;
The Laird proposed a toast or two,
And ever and anon he poured
His guest a glass of Mountain Dew.

Then to his maid the Laird gave tongue:
"My sonsie Jean, my friend is old.
Comparatively you are young,
And not so sensitive to cold.
Poor chiel! His blood austerely beats,
Though it be sped by barley bree . . .
Slip half an hour between the sheets,
Brave lass, and warm his bed a wee.

Said she: "I'll do the best I can
So that his couch may cosy be,
And as a human warming pan
Prove Highland Hospitality

"
So hearing sounds of mild carouse,
As in the down she pillowed deep:
"In half an hour I will arouse,"
She vowed, then soundly went to sleep.

So when the morn was amber-orbed
The Bishop from a dream awoke,
And as his parritch he absorbed,
Unto his host he slyly spoke:
"Your haggis, Laird, was nobly bred,
And braw your brew of barley bree -
But oh your thought to warm the bed!
That's Highland Hospitality. 

A despondent highway is stretched, 
its eyes set on the far horizon
On the cold dirt of its bosom, 
its grayish beauty spread

As if some saddened woman
in her lonely abode, lost in thought.
In contemplation of union with her Beloved
every pore sore, limbs limp with exhaustion


Two hikers named Robert and Jim
Went hiking when the weather was grim
Into the mountains they went
With their energy spent
Now their chances of survival are slim

Strolling over hills and dales, 

Wandering through the land of Wales. 

Groves of ash I passed on my way, 

Tall trees in the wind did sway. 

Ferns luscious in their coats of green, 

Wild flowers many I have never seen. 

A glory opening to my wondering eyes, 

At each turn and bend some new surprise. 

Villages enchanting to behold, 

A few quite new many very old. 

With here and there ruins of stone, 

Reminding me that I am alone. 

Alone on a journey of my choice, 

Good reason for my soul to rejoice. 

I realised that it soon must end, 

My mind sorrowful thoughts did send. 

I must return to my daily routine, 

Happy and thankful for all I have seen. 

Nature had shown me yet once again, 

That she alone had the power to keep me sane. 

I see him 
each and everyday.
He stares I just go away, 
he makes me smile, 
he makes me laugh
when I'm with him all day.
I like being with him 
each and every minute.
I spare every chance I get with him, 
when I'm with him, 
I just smile and it is so funny, 
he has a cute smile.
I want to look at it all day, 
but he would notice, 
and there would be 
drool everywhere from me.
I dont think I want that 
NO i dont.
He will think I am a reject
I dont want him to think that, 
NO Seri.
But at least I'm in the same 
school as him, 
but wait until next year
I'm going to miss him
Now I'm going to cry. 

I want to lay in  bed and cry
Until there's nothing left inside.

Why does it all come back? 
Why can't I cry it all away? 

Why does this well never dry? 
Do these tears need me as I hate them? 

Why can't I simply just move on? 
You shrug me off until I'm gone.

I'll always wonder deep inside, 
Did you know about the tears I cried? 

The emotions won't stay gone for long, 
When they return, they'll be just as strong.

I just wish my heart were frozen, 
Then I might not feel so broken.




Hinged to forgetfulness 
like a door, 
she slowly closed out of 
sight, 
and she was the woman I loved, 
but too many times she slept like 
a mechanical deer in my caresses, 
and I ached in the metal silence 
of her dreams.

'WHO but hails the sight with pleasure
When the wings of genius rise,
Their ability to measure
With great enterprise;
But in man was ne'er such daring
As yon Hawk exhibits, pairing
His brave spirit with the war in
The stormy skies!

'Mark him, how his power he uses,
Lays it by, at will resumes! 
Mark, ere for his haunt he chooses
Clouds and utter glooms!
There, he wheels in downward mazes;
Sunward now his flight he raises,
Catches fire, as seems, and blazes
With uninjured plumes!'--



'Stranger, 'tis no act of courage
Which aloft thou dost discern;
No bold 'bird' gone forth to forage
'Mid the tempest stern; 
But such mockery as the nations
See, when public perturbations
Lift men from their native stations
Like yon TUFT OF FERN;

'Such it is; the aspiring creature
Soaring on undaunted wing,
(So you fancied) is by nature
A dull helpless thing,
Dry and withered, light and yellow;--
'That' to be the tempest's fellow! 
Wait--and you shall see how hollow
Its endeavouring!


'The experiences 
of the utmost resources
of beauty and passion
will bring with them
hints of mystery and wonder.

Its appeal will not be to the clever brain
but to the desirous heart, 
the intuitive sense of man. 

Hippies are sunbathing on the beach
Sixteen is the age admitted to by each
They work all night at the local Safeway
So they can live on the beach when they
have their payday
I am watching a movie of yesteryear
Nobody lives on the beach now, out of fear
The ocean is now crawling with sharks
It is now safer to swim and sunbathe in state parks
Being a beach sunbather used to be easy
To do it now would make a person queasy
Hippies are a symbol of a time of innocence
Life in California now is full of decadence
To surf at Malibu Beach everyone was keen
Many an aged hippie is now a bygone surfing
California life was said to be idyllic
Beach life has been replaced by drugs and gangs
For a more innocent time, everyone has memory pangssome money I was desperately needing
gambling debts paid or I'd soon be bleeding
my bar was already deep in the red
'youse got insurance? ', the mob guy said
'dis dump you could combust
but get an alibi - dat is a must'

Hmm.. 'arsonist' ain't in the phone book -
so around my bar, I took a look
found some hot-headed guy with a thing for crime
but he couldn't start anything on time
He smelled like gas, dressed like a slob
Was always smoking on the job
he demanded up front, all of his cash
then sat around on his ash
always had his face in a cup
his work ethic just burned me up
five nights now with no ignite
I was smoldering mad, it just wasn't right
I finally had to re-cinder the deal
he wasn't a match for the job, I feel~ Hire and Fire ~ Fire and Hire [words poetry] ~

But none can hear my silent tread 
I knock and yet remain unseen 
For I am dead for I am dead 

I'm only seven though I died 
In Hiroshima long ago 
I'm seven now as I was then 
When children die they do not grow 

My hair was scorched by swirling flame 
My eyes grew dim my eyes grew blind 
Death came and turned my bones to dust 
And that was scattered by the wind 

I need no fruit I need no rice 
I need no sweets nor even bread 
I ask for nothing for myself 
For I am dead for I am dead 

All that I need is that for peace 
You fight today you fight today 
So that the children of this world 
Can live and grow and laugh and playa bar

A model sits motionless with diaphanous drape, 
The paint in tubes, lies waiting for an escape, 
An easel's standing, so central to the room, 
On it a canvas.  And nearby in the gloom, 
An Artist leans casually against an open door, 
Been thinking long, but now crosses the floor, 
Pulls back the blinds to let the light rush in, 
Adjusts his spectacles and prepares to begin, 
Then with a flourish of his artistic brush, 
Starts slowly to create a picture that's so plush, 
A Work of Art maybe, perhaps an important one, 
Which might see his name in lights, when it is done.
Needing to observe, he lifts his eyes to peep, 
And finds that his model has fallen fast asleep.


His Bill an Auger is,
His Head, a Cap and Frill.
He laboreth at every Tree
A Worm, His utmost Goal. 

Joy is everywhere.
Nature is getting ready, 
It is His birthday. 

GALLANTLY swung the old carpenter up to his door,
Drums and fifes in his tread,
But softly he crossed the braided mats on the floor,
Gently he stroked her head.
'More folks were there at the station than ever I knew,
Bidding the lad good-by.
Here's a daisy he picked at the platform's edge for you,
Kissing it on the sly.
'He'll do his part, our boy, on the fighting line';
— She caught the flower to her lips—
'And you with your knitting, and I have signed up for mine,
Work on the wooden ships.
'Oh, but it's hard to be old when the bugles call,
Yet I hav'n't lost my chance.
I'll be in the shipyard the day the first trees fall,
Before the boy's in France.

'His blood is flowing all over my soul
With His grace and mercy ever untold
He will never leave me here all alone
I can call to Him without using a phone
Although He is sitting upon His throne
He listens to my voice even here at home
As His blood is flowing all over my soul
I'll fear not for what's lingering ahead

Having unwavering trust and faith in Him
Helps me to live more extremely bold
I placed my life in His Hands to hold
Thus I'll endure the climates hot or cold
He hears my every moan and groan
As His blood is flowing all over my soul
I'll fear not for what's lingering ahead

Yet to be unfold not just gloom and doom 
Those by force will always try to bloom
But in my life they will find no empty room
Deep down I'm grounded with lots of roots
As His blood is flowing all over my soul
I'll fear not for what's lingering ahead.





This boat you see, friends, will tell you
that she was the fastest of craft,
not to be challenged for speed
by any vessel afloat, whether
driven by sail or the labour of oars.
The threatening Adriatic coast won’t deny it,
nor the isles of the Cyclades,
nor noble Rhodes, nor fearful Bosphorus,
nor the grim bay of the Black Sea
where, before becoming a boat, she was
leafy wood: for on the heights of Cytorus
she often hissed to the whispering leaves.
The boat says these things were well known to you,
and are, Amastris and box-wood clad Cytorus: 
she says from the very beginning she stood
on your slope, that she dipped her oars
in your water, and carried her owner from there
over so many headstrong breakers,
whether the wind cried from starboard
or larboard, or whether Jupiter struck at the sheets
on one side and the other, together:
and no prayers to the gods of the shore were offered
for her, when she came from a foreign sea
here, as far as this limpid lake.
But that’s past: now hidden away here
she ages quietly and offers herself to you,
Castor and his brother, heavenly Twins. 

MY days among the Dead are past; 
   Around me I behold, 
Where'er these casual eyes are cast, 
   The mighty minds of old: 
My never-failing friends are they, 
With whom I converse day by day. 

With them I take delight in weal 
   And seek relief in woe; 
And while I understand and feel 
   How much to them I owe, 
My cheeks have often been bedew'd 
With tears of thoughtful gratitude. 

My thoughts are with the Dead; with them 
   I live in long-past years, 
Their virtues love, their faults condemn, 
   Partake their hopes and fears; 
And from their lessons seek and find 
Instruction with an humble mind. 

My hopes are with the Dead; anon 
   My place with them will be, 
And I with them shall travel on 
   Through all Futurity; 
Yet leaving here a name, I trust, 
That will not perish in the dust

"I'm going, Billy, old fellow. Hist, lad! Don't make any noise.
There's Boches to beat all creation, the pitch of a bomb away.
I've fixed the note to your collar, you've got to get back to my Boys,
You've got to get back to warn 'em before it's the break of day


The order came to go forward to a trench-line traced on the map;
I knew the brass-hats had blundered, I knew and I told 'em so;
I knew if I did as they ordered I would tumble into a trap,
And I tried to explain, but the answer came like a pistol: "Go


Then I thought of the Boys I commanded -- I always called them "my Boys" --
The men of my own recruiting, the lads of my countryside;
Tested in many a battle, I knew their sorrows and joys,
And I loved them all like a father, with more than a father's pride.

To march my Boys to a shambles as soon as the dawn of day;
To see them helplessly slaughtered, if all that I guessed was true;
My Boys that trusted me blindly, I thought and I tried to pray,
And then I arose and I muttered: "It's either them or it's you


I rose and I donned my rain-coat; I buckled my helmet tight.
I remember you watched me, Billy, as I took my cane in my hand;
I vaulted over the sandbags into the pitchy night,
Into the pitted valley that served us as No Man's Land.

I strode out over the hollow of hate and havoc and death,
From the heights the guns were angry, with a vengeful snarling of steel;
And once in a moment of stillness I heard hard panting breath,
And I turned . . . it was you, old rascal, following hard on my heel.

I fancy I cursed you, Billy; but not so much as I ought!
And so we went forward together, till we came to the valley rim,
And then a star-shell sputtered . . . it was even worse than I thought,
For the trench they told me to move in was packed with Boche to the brim.

They saw me too, and they got me; they peppered me till I fell;
And there I scribbled my message with my life-blood ebbing away;
"Now, Billy, you fat old duffer, you've got to get back like hell;
And get them to cancel that order before it's the dawn of day.

"Billy, old boy, I love you, I kiss your shiny black nose;
Now, home there. . . . Hurry, you devil, or I'll cut you to ribands. . . . See . . 

"
Poor brute! he's off! and I'm dying. . . . I go as a soldier goes.

It was an actor, seedy, sad,
Who stood within the gate;
Long weary marches he had had 
He had not dined of late.

He sighed: 'I hope I don't intrude.
Believe me or I die:
For days I have not tasted food.
A stranded player I.'

'An actor man?' the lady said.
'What is your favourite role?'
'Hot, madam, and with butter spread,'
He answered from his soul. 

Today they look back and smile
It is over ten years but it looks just like yesterday
Smiles have become older and better
They look into each others eyes with admiration


Amazing souls they are
They bring joy every day


Their secret has been transparency
Their secret has been love 
Their secret has been forgiveness


His colour told me
it was he.
I tried to name him
but
my breath froze,
lips petrified
and mouth was still.
All was darkness
but
a lightning showed its teeth. 

Tis door to heaven
Key to paradise through it
The way to glory


His death in Benares
Won't save the assassin
From certain hell,

Any more than a dip
In the Ganges will send
Frogs—or you—to paradise.

My home, says Kabir,
Is where there's no day, no night,
And no holy book in sight

To squat on our lives. 

He walked along her garden to pick the roses
The thorns pricked his hands but he did not give up
He walked by her river bank to draw some water
The banks had burst-ed but he feared not to be washed away His love for her was like the bush fire
He had spent time thinking of this lovely lady he hardly knew A lady whose beauty could turn a blind man into sight
His appetite for her was immeasurably disturbing
Oh man!  was she meant for you? 

Her long model legs were wonderfully created
Her lips were smooth no man would have resisted her kiss
Daughter of my mother was she the Biblical Delilah? 
Her hips swayed in a balanced manner
He held tightly into her ant-like waistline
He recollected himself and kissed her
Oh Delilah are you meant for him? 

That night he slept not, for his dream to touch, kiss and partake had come to pass 
Oh Delilah! Will you marry him? 
The honey pot he thought was best for him
He would pay the bride price to have her as his wife
The petals of the roses remain attractive than the thorns Optimism filled him
Oh Delilah will you be his wife? 

He promised to love her
He yearned for her curves
He longed for her touch 
But Delilah woke up from another mans house
Wisdom had left him
Admiration had turned sour
Oh Delilah! why did you betray him

The seafarers tell of the Eastern Isle of Bliss,
It is lost in a wilderness of misty sea waves.
But the Sky-land of the south, the Yueh-landers say,
May be seen through cracks of the glimmering cloud.
This land of the sky stretches across the leagues of heaven;
It rises above the Five Mountains and towers over the Scarlet Castle,

While, as if staggering before it, the Tien-tai Peak
Of forty-eight thousand feet leans toward the southeast.

So, longing to dream of the southlands of Wu and Yueh,
I flew across the Mirror Lake one night under the moon.

The moon in the lake followed my flight,
Followed me to the town of Yen-chi.
Here still stands the mansion of Prince Hsieh.
I saw the green waters curl and heard the monkeys' shrill cries.
I climbed, putting on the clogs of the prince, 
Skyward on a ladder of clouds,
And half-way up from the sky-wall I saw the morning sun,
And heard the heaven's cock crowing in the mid-air.
Now among a thousand precipices my way wound round and round;
Flowers choked the path; I leaned against a rock; I swooned.

Roaring bears and howling dragons roused me—
Oh, the clamorous waters of the rapids!
I trembled in the deep forest, and shuddered at the overhanging crags, 
    one heaped upon another.
Clouds on clouds gathered above, threatening rain;
The waters gushed below, breaking into mist.
 
A peal of blasting thunder!
The mountains crumbled.
The stone gate of the hollow heaven
Opened wide, revealing
A vasty realm of azure without bottom,
Sun and moon shining together on gold and silver palaces.

Clad in rainbow and riding on the wind,
The ladies of the air descended like flower, flakes;
The faery lords trooping in, they were thick as hemp-stalks in the fields.
Phoenix birds circled their cars, and panthers played upon harps.
Bewilderment filled me, and terror seized on my heart.
I lifted myself in amazement, and alas!
I woke and found my bed and pillow—
Gone was the radiant world of gossamer.

So with all pleasures of life.
All things pass with the east-flowing water.
I leave you and go—when shall I return?
Let the white roe feed at will among the green crags,
Let me ride and visit the lovely mountains!
How can I stoop obsequiously and serve the mighty ones!
It stifles my soul. 

Ferdinand Frog was all agog, 
He'd seen a female creature green, 
And jumping sprightly from his log, 
Was goggle eyed and very keen.

He, creeping up, planted a kiss, 
Then everything became all blurred, 
He should have been feeling utter bliss, 
He didn't know what had occurred.

His ego was all bruised and battered, 
His body bounced into the road, 
And he was absolutely shattered, 
For 'she' turned out to be a toad

Celestial choir! enthron'd in realms of light,
Columbia's scenes of glorious toils I write.
While freedom's cause her anxious breast alarms,
She flashes dreadful in refulgent arms.
See mother earth her offspring's fate bemoan,
And nations gaze at scenes before unknown!
See the bright beams of heaven's revolving light
Involved in sorrows and the veil of night!

Olive and laurel binds Her golden hair:
Wherever shines this native of the skies,
Unnumber'd charms and recent graces rise.

   Muse! Bow propitious while my pen relates
How pour her armies through a thousand gates,
As when Eolus heaven's fair face deforms,
Enwrapp'd in tempest and a night of storms;
Astonish'd ocean feels the wild uproar,
The refluent surges beat the sounding shore;
Or think as leaves in Autumn's golden reign,
Such, and so many, moves the warrior's train.
In bright array they seek the work of war,
Where high unfurl'd the ensign waves in air.
Shall I to Washington their praise recite?
Enough thou know'st them in the fields of fight.
Thee, first in peace and honors—we demand
The grace and glory of thy martial band.
Fam'd for thy valour, for thy virtues more,
Hear every tongue thy guardian aid implore!

   One century scarce perform'd its destined round,
When Gallic powers Columbia's fury found;
And so may you, whoever dares disgrace
The land of freedom's heaven-defended race!
Fix'd are the eyes of nations on the scales,
For in their hopes Columbia's arm prevails.
Anon Britannia droops the pensive head,
While round increase the rising hills of dead.
Ah! Cruel blindness to Columbia's state!
Lament thy thirst of boundless power too late.

   Proceed, great chief, with virtue on thy side,
A crown, a mansion, and a throne that shine,
With gold unfading, WASHINGTON! Be thine.His Feet are shod with Gauze—
His Helmet, is of Gold,
His Breast, a Single Onyx
With Chrysophrase, inlaid.

His Labor is a Chant—
His Idleness—a Tune—
Oh, for a Bee's experience
Of Clovers, and of Noon

Now, money was scarce and work was slack 
    And love to his heart Crept in, 
And he rode away on the Northern track 
    To war with the world and win; 
And he vowed by the locket upon his breast 
    And its treasure, one red gold curl, 
To work with with a will in the fartherest West 
    For the sake of his Gippsland girl. 

The hot wind blows on the dusty plain 
    And the red sun burns above, 
But he sees her face at his side again, 
    And he strikes each blow for love. 
He toils by the light of one far-off star 
    For the winning of one white pearl, 
And the swinging pick and the driving bar 
    Strike home for the Gippsland girl. 

With an aching wrist and a back that's bent, 
    With salt sweat blinding eyes, 
'Tis little he'd reek if his life were spent 
    In the winning so grand a prize. 
His shear blades flash and over his hand 
    The folds of the white fleece curl, 
And all day long he sticks to his stand 
    For the love of his Gippsland girl. 

When the shearing's done and the shed's cut out 
    On Barwon and Narran and Bree; 
When the shearer mates with the rouseabout 
    And the Union man with the free; 
When the doors of the shanty, open wide, 
    An uproarious welcome hurl, 
He passes by on the other side 
    For the sake of his gippsland girl. 

When summer lay brown on the Western Land 
    He rode once more to the South, 
Athirst for the touch of a lily hand 
    And the kiss of a rosebud mouth; 
And he sang the songs that shorten the way, 
    And he envied not king or earl, 
And he spared not the spur in his dappled grey 
    For the sake of his Gippsland girl. 

At the garden gate when the shadows fell 
    His hopes in the dusk lay dead; 
'Nelli? Oh! Surely you heard that Nell 
    Is married a month' they said. 
He spoke no word; with a dull, dumb pain 
    At his heart, and his brain awhirl 
He turned his grey to the North again 
    For the sake of his Gippsland girl. 

And he rung the board in a Paroo shed 
    By the sweat of his aching brow, 
But he blued his cheque, for he grimly said, 
    'There is nothing to live for now.' 
And out and away where the big floods start 
    And the Darling dust-showers swirl, 
There's a drunken shearer who broke his heart 
    Over a Gippsland girl!

His hands should have 
their own identity, 
a name perhaps, 
befitting each vocation
they enjoy.

Skillful hands -
finely tuned, they hold every tool
with equal panache.
Each callous earned, a trophy, 
yet self-aware, they're gentle
as they browse my every curve.

Comical hands -
the right one scraping whiskers, 
razoring down a field of white
revealing trails of pink-skinned angles.
I laugh at the silly poses
skewed by the left
so the right won't miss a spot, 
my just reward, a foamy kiss.

Angry hands -
his driving hands, 
hands that slap the wheel
as assholes go too slow
or cut in front, 
directionals up their butts
with their heads.

I'm glad the angry hands
are only known to live in cars.

Those hands.  
I love his hand

For that there is a morn
But in this black Receptacle

His Holiness the Abbot

I 

   I saw a dead man's finer part 
Shining within each faithful heart 
Of those bereft. Then said I: "This must be 
   His immortality
 


II 

   I looked there as the seasons wore, 
And still his soul continuously upbore 
Its life in theirs. But less its shine excelled 
   Than when I first beheld. 

III 

   His fellow-yearsmen passed, and then 
In later hearts I looked for him again; 
And found him--shrunk, alas! into a thin 
   And spectral mannikin. 

IV 

   Lastly I ask--now old and chill - 
If aught of him remain unperished still; 
And find, in me alone, a feeble spark, 
   Dying amid the dark. 

Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art! - 
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night,
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like Nature's patient sleepless Eremite,
The moving waters at their priestlike task
Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,
Or gazing on the new soft fallen mask
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors - 
No -yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,
Pillowed upon my fair love's ripening breast,
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
And so live ever -or else swoon to death.

His love is all consuming
It lingers and awaits for the moment
To be right to pour into our souls

Our hearts patiently awaiting to come in

His love consumes that which is opened unto 
Him welcoming his Holy Spirit within

He uproots that which is evil and vile and unclean

He will consume our thoughts
Our actions and our everything
If we bid him come in

For to allow him to consume us is the sweetest thing
Mankind can experience

Unlike earthly and fleshly things which can never 
Satisfy his love fills that place where nothing else can

Man has a one on one relationship with 
The creator of mankind
And all living things when his love
Is allowed to consume the willing soul

Tis sweet to be in his loving care
Yet many blessings otherwise unknown
To mankind shall be revealed 
To the soul that welcomes his: 
"All-consuming love"
For tomorrow's April Fools day for the clan.
He replaced the sugar in the bowl with salt.
It was a simple plan, but it had a fault

On April first he was the first to rise.
He found his strategy wasn't so wise: 
He wanted cereal, and wanted it sweet, 
So he spooned some salt into his shredded wheat.

He found out the joke was very cruel, 
When he became his own April fool. 

Glimpse the beauty of a butterfly's wings, 
As if inspired by heavenly angelic paintings, 
Soft as delicate silk, they are thus displayed,  
Dusted with subtle colours, which can only fade
Once life on this earth is at a sombre end.
One thing in this great world we cannot mend, 
When heaven reclaims what it owned, from the start, 

And birthdays and holidays such praises can be heard
Of her unblemished lineaments, a whiteness with no stain,
That she might be that sprightly girl trodden by a bird;
And there's a score of duchesses, surpassing woma-kind,
Or who have found a painter to make them so for pay
And smooth out stain and blemish with the elegance of his mind:
I knew a phoenix in my youth, so let them have their day.
The young men every night applaud their Gaby's laughing eye,
And Ruth St.  Denis had more charm although she had poor luck;
From nineteen hundred nine or ten, Pavlova's had the cry
And there's a player in the States who gathers up her cloak
And flings herself out of the room when Juliet would be bride
With all a woman's passion, a child's imperious way,
And there are -- but no matter if there are scores beside:
I knew a phoenix in my youth, so let them have their day.
There's Margaret and Marjorie and Dorothy and Nan,
A Daphne and a Mary who live in privacy;
One's had her fill of lovers, another's had but one,
Another boasts, 'I pick and choose and have but two or three.'
If head and limb have beauty and the instep's high and light
They can spread out what sail they please for all I have to say,
Be but the breakers of men's hearts or engines of delight:
I knew a phoenix in my youth, so let them have their day.
There'll be that crowd, that barbarous crowd, through all the centuries,
And who can say but some young belle may walk and talk men wild
Who is my beauty's equal, though that my heart denies,
But not the exact likeness, the simplicity of a child,
And that proud look as though she had gazed into the burning sun,
And all the shapely body no tittle gone astray.
I knew a phoenix in my youth, so let them have their day. 

GIVE me my scallop-shell of quiet, 
   My staff of faith to walk upon, 
My scrip of joy, immortal diet, 
   My bottle of salvation, 
My gown of glory, hope's true gage; 
And thus I'll take my pilgrimage. 

Blood must be my body's balmer; 
   No other balm will there be given: 
Whilst my soul, like quiet palmer, 
   Travelleth towards the land of heaven; 
Over the silver mountains, 
Where spring the nectar fountains; 
   There will I kiss 
   The bowl of bliss; 
And drink mine everlasting fill 
Upon every milken hill. 
My soul will be a-dry before; 
But, after, it will thirst no more. 

His Power bounded, greater is in might,
Than if let loose, 'twere wholly infinite.
He could have made an endless sea by this,
But then it had not been a sea of bliss.
Did waters from the centre to the skies
Ascend, 'twould drown whatever else we prize.
The ocean bounded in a finite shore,
Is better far because it is no more.
No use nor glory would in that be seen,
His power made it endless in esteem.
Had not the Sun been bounded in its sphere,
Did all the world in one fair flame appear,
And were that flame a real Infinite
'Twould yield no profit, splendor, nor delight.
Its corps confined, and beams extended be
Effects of Wisdom in the Deity.
One star made infinite would all exclude,
An earth made infinite could ne'er be viewed:
But one being fashioned for the other's sake,
He, bounding all, did all most useful make
And which is best, in profit and delight
Tho' not in bulk, they all are infinite. 

in peace I roam through 
night time visions without fear 
of silent judgment

chases the words of poets

The pin-swin or spine-swine
(the edgehog miscalled hedgehog) with all his edges out,
echidna and echinoderm in distressed-
pin-cushion thorn-fur coats, the spiny pig or porcupine,
the rhino with horned snout–
everything is battle-dressed.

Pig-fur won’t do, I’ll wrap
myself in salamander-skin like Presbyter John.
A lizard in the midst of flames, a firebrand
that is life, asbestos-eyed asbestos-eared, with tattooed nap
and permanent pig on
the instep; he can withstand

fire and won’t drown. In his
unconquerable country of unpompous gusto,
gold was so common none considered it; greed
and flattery were unknown. Though rubies large as tennis-
balls conjoined in streams so
that the mountain seemed to bleed,

the inextinguishable 
salamander styled himself but presbyter. His shield
was his humility. In Carpasian
linen coat, flanked by his household lion-cubs and sable
retinue, he revealed
a formula safer than

an armorer’s: the power of relinquishing 
what one would keep; that is freedom. Become dinosaur-
skulled, quilled or salamander-wooled, more ironshod
and javelin-dressed than a hedgehog battalion of steel, but be
dull. Don’t be envied or
armed with a measuring rod.

that life at large
is just a lie
his star wasn`t born

As he dictates to her 

Does she love you?—well, I wonder— 
Married twenty years, they say! 
You, so bald and fat and funny,
Grubbing like a mole for money?
Guess she likes to spend the plunder— 
Gee—she knows the way!

With her doings in the papers, 
Dinners, dances, all the capers, 
Likes to lead the show, my guess is! 
You're the gold machine! 

If she knew you as I know you, 
Would she spend it—say? 
If she knew each trick and quibble— 
Little fishes hooked that nibble, 
Business murders—would she show you 
Such a grand-stand play? 

You're a savage money-maker— 
Good to her, though, sure—and me. 
Kind old pirate! What in thunder
Does she think of you, I wonder?
What neat stories do you take her, 
So she will not see

Under the shelter of his wings am I kept from harm
He is my guiding light, my strength, my only hope
His strength will carry me through any storm

Life will carry many blows from the unknown
So much comfort, and peace, where there
Once was only fear, and unrest

Peace in knowing where I am bound
When I leave this cold and trying world
Peace and freedom from temptation
Hope all eternal

Thank you most high for your shield 
Of protection upon and around me and my loved ones

Let us cling tightly to the masters hand
Therefore standing to face any storm
Life may blow our way

There is relief from pain
There is hope no matter what 
Happens to these earthly bodies

Stand strong oh ye children of his
For soon there shall be a gathering 
Like no man has ever witnessed
To take us home to live in glory eternally! 
He says 
That He is supreme
Unchanging
The King of valleys 
The king of mountains 
The giver of life 
The one who takes it 
He still seats on the throne
In bad times and in good times
He still reigns in the day and at night
Never early never late in his blessings
He gives real-time responses
His time His real time is unquestionable
Yes the one you serve 
The one I serve
The one we serve
Ever omnipresent


I come across from Mellstock while the moon wastes weaker
To behold where I lived with you for twenty years and more:
I shall go in the gray, at the passing of the mail-train,
And need no setting open of the long familiar door
As before.


The change I notice in my once own quarters!
A brilliant budded border where the daisies used to be,
The rooms new painted, and the pictures altered,
And other cups and saucers, and no cosy nook for tea
As with me.


I discern the dim faces of the sleep-wrapt servants;
They are not those who tended me through feeble hours and strong,
But strangers quite, who never knew my rule here,
Who never saw me painting, never heard my softling song
Float along.


So I don't want to linger in this re-decked dwelling,
I feel too uneasy at the contrasts I behold,
And I make again for Mellstock to return here never,
And rejoin the roomy silence, and the mute and manifold
Souls of old. 

His voice decrepit was with Joy - 
Her words did totter so
How old the News of Love must be
To make Lips elderly
That purled a moment since with Glee - 
Is it Delight or Woe - 
Or Terror -  that do decorate
This livid interview -Darkness creeps in on wings of stealth, 
Night times aim not yet complete, 
Shrouding all he sees as wealth, 
Spreading out his sombre sheet.

Then the moon with glowing face, 
Illuminates our earthly stage, 
And lights the outer realms of space, 
Releasing moonbeams from their cage.

His watchful eye is upon us all, 
He's seen this earth through countless days, 
And as the twilight starts to fall, 
He displays glimmering gentle rays.

Smiling now he shines so bright, 
Giving his all, as best he can, 
Sweetening for us the lonely night,

He is just this edge of fat and he walks constantly, he
fritters; they have him; they are eating him hollow like 
a webbed fly, and his eyes are red-suckled with anger-fear.
He feels hatred and discard of the world, sharper than
his razor, and his gut-feel hangs like a wet polyp; and he 
self-decisions himself defeated trying to shake his
hung beard from razor in water (like life) , not warm enough.

She made a little hat and he fastened two snaps under one
arm, reaching up from the bed like a long feeler from the
snail, and she went to church, and he thought now I h've
time and the dog.
About church: the trouble with a mask is it 
never changes.
So rude the flowers that grow and do not grow beautiful.
So magic the chair on the patio that does not hold legs
and belly and arm and neck and mouth that bites into the 
wind like the ned of a tunnel.
He turned in bed and thought: I am searching for some 
segment in the air. It floats about the peoples heads.
When it rains on the trees it sits between the branches
warmer and more blood-real than the dove.

Hist! . . . . . . Hark!
The night is very dark,
And we've to go a mile or so
Across the Possum Park.

Step . . . . . . light,
Keeping to the right;
If we delay, and lose our way,
We'll be out half the night.
The clouds are low and gloomy. Oh!
It's just begun to mist!
We haven't any overcoats
And - Hist! . . . . . . Hist!

(Mo . . . . . . poke!)
Who was that that spoke?
This is not a fitting spot
To make a silly joke.

Dear . . . . . . me!
A mopoke in a tree!
It jarred me so, I didn't know
Whatever it could be.
But come along; creep along;
Soon we shall be missed.
They'll get a scare and wonder where
We - Hush! . . . . . . Hist!

Ssh! . . . . . . Soft!
I've told you oft and oft
We should not stray so far away
Without a moon aloft.

Oo! . . . . . . Scat!
Goodness! What was that?
Upon my word, it's quite absurd,
It's only just a cat.
But come along; haste along;
Soon we'll have to rush,
Or we'll be late and find the gate
Is - Hist! . . . . . . Hush!

(Kok!. . . . . . Korrock!)
Oh! I've had a shock!
I hope and trust it's only just
A frog behind a rock.

Shoo! . . . . . . Shoo!
We've had enough of you;
Scaring folk just for a joke
Is not the thing to do.
But come along, slip along -
Isn't it a lark
Just to roam so far from home
On - Hist! . . . . . . Hark!

Look! . . . . . . See!
Shining through the tree,
The window-light is glowing bright
To welcome you and me.

Shout! . . . . . . Shout!
There's someone round about,
And through the door I see some more
And supper all laid out.
Now, run! Run! Run!
Oh, we've had such splendid fun -
Through the park in the dark,
As brave as anyone.

Laughed, we did, and chaffed, we did,
And whistled all the way,
And we're home again! Home again!

On an evening, for example, when the naive tourist has retired 
from our economic horrors, a master's hand awakens

they are playing cards at the bottom of the pond, 
there are saints, veils, threads of harmony, 
and legendary chromatics in the setting sun.

Comedy drips on the grass stages. 
And the distress of the poor and of the weak 
on those stupid planes! Before his slave's vision, 
Germany goes scaffolding toward moons; 
Tartar deserts light up; ancient revolts ferment 
in the center of the Celestial Empire; 
over stairways and armchairs of rock, a little world, wan and flat, 
Africa and Occidents, will be erected.
Then a ballet of familiar seas and nights, 
worthless chemistry and impossible melodies. The same bourgeois magic 
wherever the mail-train sets you down. 
Even the most elementary physicist feels that it is no longer possible 
to submit to this personal atmosphere, fog of physical remorse, 
which to acknowledge is already an affliction. No! 
The moment of the seething cauldron, of seas removed, 
of subterranean conflagrations, of the planet swept away, 
and the consequent exterminations, certitudes indicated 
with so little malice by the Bible and by the Norns 
and for which serious persons should be on the alert


Dear Uncle Jim. this garden ground 
That now you smoke your pipe around, 
has seen immortal actions done 
And valiant battles lost and won. 

Here we had best on tip-toe tread, 
While I for safety march ahead, 
For this is that enchanted ground 
Where all who loiter slumber sound. 

Here is the sea, here is the sand, 
Here is the simple Shepherd's Land, 
Here are the fairy hollyhocks, 
And there are Ali Baba's rocks. 
But yonder, see! apart and high, 
Frozen Siberia lies; where I, 
With Robert Bruce William Tell, 
Was bound by an enchanter's spell. 

For centuries man has fought, 
he's sharpened his swords, 
he's serated his knives, 
he's holsted his guns, 
and ended so many lives.

It's man's endless fight
thats histories blight

For centuries man has murdered, 
he's hardened his stones, 
he's heated his flames, 
he's lashed his whips, 
and beat the innocent man to shame.

In the shadow of night
thats histories blight

For centuries man has waged war, 
he's polished his muskets, 
he's poisoned his arrows, 
he's fused his bombs, 
he's ambushed from the shadows
as he plans his victories.

In plain sight
thats histories blight
and we still think we have it right

How great our blight is

History has to live with what was here,
clutching and close to fumbling all we had--
it is so dull and gruesome how we die,
unlike writing, life never finishes.
Abel was finished; death is not remote,
a flash-in-the-pan electrifies the skeptic,
his cows crowding like skulls against high-voltage wire,
his baby crying all night like a new machine.
As in our Bibles, white-faced, predatory,
the beautiful, mist-drunken hunter's moon ascends--
a child could give it a face: two holes, two holes,
my eyes, my mouth, between them a skull's no-nose--
O there's a terrifying innocence in my face
drenched with the silver salvage of the mornfrost. 

Every morning any newspaper
Can serve you the news- - - - - 
A baby of six months, a girl of 
Twelve, two sisters, or a lady, 
Of any village, any town or city
Have been raped, gang raped.
Some say, unemployment is the
Main cause behind this, 
Frustrated generation has no way
Out to express their grievance; 
Orthodox people say, the attire of the victims, 
Co-education, free-mixing, and freedom
Make the women face such problems.
So, child marriage is a must.
But, child can't escape the rapists grip.
And in some cases, women are being
Raped over property dispute even
By a gang led by her ex-husband.
Political parties take help of this crime, 
To stop the voice of the peoples.
An M. 

P/Actor instigated his party-fellows
To rape the daughters, sisters, wives
Of the members of opponent political
Parities in West Bengal, India.
But, history  and mythology say, 
Whoever insulted women in the past 
Had been annihilated by The Power Supreme. 

History repeats itself.
Has to.
No-one listens. 

I am four in this photograph, standing   
on a wide strip of Mississippi beach,   
my hands on the flowered hips
of a bright bikini. My toes dig in,   
curl around wet sand. The sun cuts   
the rippling Gulf in flashes with each   
tidal rush. Minnows dart at my feet
glinting like switchblades. I am alone
except for my grandmother, other side   
of the camera, telling me how to pose.   
It is  two years after they opened   
the rest of this beach to us,   
forty years since the photograph   
where she stood on a narrow plot   
of sand marked colored, smiling,
her hands on the flowered hips   
of a cotton meal-sack dress.

To children growing up into this Brave New World
.  

even recent history is ancient history

and is already begining to sound mythlogical

And the Wright brothers said they thought they had invented
something that could make peace on earth
(if the wrong brothers didn’t get hold of it) 
when their wonderful flying machine took off at Kitty Hawk
into the kingdom of birds but the parliament of birds was freaked out
by this man-made bird and fled to heaven

And then the famous Spirit of Saint Louis took off eastward and
flew across the Big Pond with Lindy at the controls in his leather
helmet and goggles hoping to sight the doves of peace but he did not
Even though he circled Versailles

And then the famous Yankee Clipper took off in the opposite
direction and flew across the terrific Pacific but the pacific doves
were frighted by this strange amphibious bird and hid in the orient sky

And then the famous Flying Fortress took off bristling with guns
and testosterone to make the world safe for peace and capitalism
but the birds of peace were nowhere to be found before or after Hiroshima

And so then clever men built bigger and faster flying machines and
these great man-made birds with jet plumage flew higher than any
real birds and seemed about to fly into the sun and melt their wings
and like Icarus crash to earth

And the Wright brothers were long forgotten in the high-flying
bombers that now began to visit their blessings on various Third
Worlds all the while claiming they were searching for doves of
peace

And they kept flying and flying until they flew right into the t
century and then one fine day a Third World struck back and
stormed the great planes and flew them straight into the beating
heart of Skyscraper America where there were no aviaries and no
parliaments of doves and in a blinding flash America became a part
of the scorched earth of the world

And a wind of ashes blows across the land
And for one long moment in eternity
There is chaos and despair

And buried loves and voices
Cries and whispers
Fill the air
Everywhere


History insists
The world polarizes 
Borders shakes  
Human awakens

From time to time
To here and there
And to over there
Stepped and exiled 
Shifted and encroached

The story was written
History was made
Tribes and clans
Masters and slaves

Pendulous world
Watery land
Demarcated colors
Make prisons

When he wants
Grabs and embraces 
In the name of 
Love and kindness
Sympathy and empathy

When he don’t
Folds the map
Locks the head
In the name of 
Profit and thought

War and peace
A survival of words
Other’s cry
A noise of hate

This human made and marked
Nations and races 
Named and branded
Shed the blood and wrote the difference

Still turns 
Towards one direction
Invention and invasion 
Invitation and insulation
Sometime jerks
Going to be sunk
But the ship of past 
Still sails

The wind and the wave push 
By searching for the happiness
Air and sea creates routes
When the land says no

People in the compass
From North to East and to South
Even to West
Find their destiny and dignity 
While in the same direction
World survives today tomorrow
Until not changed
The drive and driver


In a brazen bedroom
of deceit, 
she lay seductive, 
leg folded, naive
and thoughtless
in freshly crumpled sheets.

From out of the shadows, 
a macho man
with silenced gun, 
judged six span
and. 
fired a sure shot.

Moving fast, 
his body spun
to make a sudden
freedom run.

She, 
a blast hole
in her head, 
lay in death
on the marital bed. 

I am a killer, 
born to serve.
 Raised without care
I have plenty of nerve.

 I'm in the buisness 
of killing and death.
 I do what I do
I have nothing left.

 I am ruthlessness
in human form.
 I slay without mercy
I'm not to mourn.

 I do the dirty work
for bloodthirsty men, 
 who have alot of 
money they want to spend
 to put someone's life to
a screaming end.

 I now know the purpose
I have on this earth.
 Dont free me from my burdon
and rid me of my curse.

Somday when i'm dead
and my soul is submerged, 
 I hope to be rid of 
my bloodshed urge.

An'—wilt—yeh—take—this—woman—fer—to—be
Yer—wed ded—wife?— . . . O, strike me!  Will I wot?
Take 'er?  Doreen?  'E stan's there arstin' me!
As if 'e thort per'aps I'd rather not!
Take 'er? 'E seemed to think 'er kind was got
Like cigarette-cards, fer the arstin'. Still,
I does me stunt in this 'ere hitchin' rot,
An' speaks me piece: 'Righto!' I sez, 'I will.'

'I will,' I sez. An' tho' a joyful shout
Come from me bustin' 'eart—I know it did
Me voice got sorter mangled comin' out,
An' makes me whisper like a frightened kid.
'I will,' I squeaks. An' I'd 'a' give a quid
To 'ad it on the quite, wivout this fuss,
An' orl the starin' crowd that Mar 'ad bid
To see this solim hitchin' up of us.

'Fer—rich-er—er—fer—poorer.' So 'e bleats.
'In—sick-ness—an'—in—'ealth,' . . . An' there I stands,
An' dunno 'arf the chatter I repeats,
Nor wot the 'ell to do wiv my two 'ands.
But 'e don't 'urry puttin' on our brands
This white-'aired pilot-bloke—but gives it lip,
Dressed in 'is little shirt, wiv frills an' bands.
'In sick-ness—an'—in—' Ar! I got the pip!

An' once I missed me turn; an' Ginger Mick,
'Oo's my best-man, 'e ups an' beefs it out.
'I will!' 'e 'owls; an' fetches me a kick.
'Your turn to chin!' 'e tips wiv a shout.
An' there I'm standin' like a gawky lout.
(Aw, spare me! But I seemed to be all 'ands!)
An' wonders wot 'e's goin' crook about,
Wiv 'arf a mind to crack 'im where 'e stands.

O, lumme! But ole Ginger was a trick!
Got up regardless fer the solim rite.
('E 'awks the bunnies when 'e toils, does Mick)
An' twice I saw 'im feelin' fer a light
To start a fag; an' trembles lest 'e might,
Thro' force o' habit like. 'E's nervis too;
That's plain, fer orl 'is air o' bluff an' skite;
An' jist as keen as me to see it thro'.

But, 'struth, the wimmnin! 'Ow they love this frill!
Fer Auntie Liz, an' Mar, o' course, wus there;
An' Mar's two uncles' wives, an' Cousin Lil,
An' 'arf a dozen more to grin and stare.
I couldn't make me 'ands fit anywhere!
I felt like I wus up afore the Beak!
But my Doreen she never turns a 'air,
Nor misses once when it's 'er turn to speak.

Ar, strike! No more swell marridges fer me!
It seems a blinded year afore 'e's done.
We could 'a' fixed it in the registree
Twice over 'fore this cove 'ad 'arf begun.
I s'pose the wimmin git some sorter fun
Wiv all this guyver, an 'is nibs's shirt.
But, seems to me, it takes the bloomin' bun,
This stylish splicin' uv a bloke an' skirt.

'To—be—yer—weddid—wife—' Aw, take a pull!
Wot in the 'ell's 'e think I come there for?
An' so 'e drawls an' drones until I'm full,
An' wants to do a duck clean out the door.
An' yet, fer orl 'is 'igh-falutin' jor,
Ole Snowy wus a reel good-meanin' bloke.
If 'twasn't fer the 'oly look 'e wore
Yeh'd think 'e piled it on jist fer a joke.

An', when at last 'e shuts 'is little book,
I 'eaves a sigh that nearly bust me vest.
But 'Eavens! Now 'ere's muvver goin' crook!
An' sobbin' awful on me manly chest!
(I wish she'd give them water-works a rest.)
'My little girl!' she 'owls. 'O, treat 'er well!
She's young—too young to leave 'er muvver's nest!'
'Orright, ole chook,' I nearly sez. Oh, 'ell!

An' then we 'as a beano up at Mar's
A slap-up feed, wiv wine an' two big geese.
Doreen sits next ter me, 'er eyes like stars.
O, 'ow I wished their blessed yap would cease!
The Parson-bloke 'e speaks a little piece,
That makes me blush an' 'ang me silly 'ead.
'E sez 'e 'opes our lovin' will increase
I likes that pilot fer the things 'e said.

'E sez Doreen an' me is in a boat,
An' sailin' on the matrimonial sea.
'E sez as 'ow 'e hopes we'll allus float
In peace an' joy, from storm an' danger free.
Then muvver gits to weepin' in 'er tea;
An' Auntie Liz sobs like a winded colt;
An' Cousin Lil comes 'round an' kisses me;
Until I feel I'll 'ave to do a bolt.

Then Ginger gits end-up an' makes a speech
('E'd 'ad a couple, but 'e wasn't shick.)
'My cobber 'ere,' 'e sez, ''as copped a peach!
Of orl the barrer-load she is the pick!
I 'opes 'e won't fergit 'is pals too quick
As wus 'is frien's in olden days, becors,
I'm trusting later on,' sez Ginger Mick,
'To celebrate the chris'nin'.' . . . 'Oly wars!

At last Doreen an' me we gits away,
An' leaves 'em doin' nothin' to the scram
(We're honey-moonin' down beside the Bay.)
I gives a 'arf a dollar to the man
Wot drives the cab; an' like two kids we ran
To ketch the train—Ah, strike! I could 'a' flown!
We gets the carridge right agen the van.
She whistles, jolts, an' starts . . . An' we're alone!

Doreen an' me! My precious bit o' fluff!
Me own true weddid wife! . . . An' we're alone!
She seems so frail, an' me so big an' rough 
I dunno wot this feelin' is that's grown
Inside me 'ere that makes me feel I own
A thing so tender like I fear to squeeze
Too 'ard fer fear she'll break . . . Then, wiv a groan
I starts to 'ear a coot call, 'Tickets, please!'

You could 'a' outed me right on the spot!
I wus so rattled when that porter spoke. 
Fer, 'struth! Them tickets I 'ad fair forgot!
But 'e fist laughs, an' takes it fer a joke.
'We must ixcuse,' 'e sez, 'new-married folk.' 
An' I pays up, an' grins, an' blushes red

It shows 'ow married life improves a bloke: 
If I'd bin single I'd 'a' punched 'is head

The sun heated highway, 
Burned black, 
Stretching in front of my car
Like an old fashioned licorice stick, 
Embraced the tires.

The car strained where
The rubber met the road, 
And the stench of hot metal
Caused my skin to loosen, 
Like the hot summer sun
On my head.

The hard-driving, pulsating tires rolled
As I clenched the wheel in my sweaty hands, 
'N th' wind in my sunstreaked hair
Was just the release I needed.


Until I saw him, 
Standing on the roadside, 
Thumb outstretched.  
I felt the hot tires bump
As I pulled
To the side of the road.  

June Tryna get to sunny Californy' -

Now, who in the world can understand?
Since Tyranny, Freedom's whittler,
And the strong-arm band of the Iron Hand
Go hitting it up with Hitler,
Who can pretend to comprehend
This curious law-and-order
When generals dropp as the guns go pop,
And the princes streak for the border.

Where is the end when friend slays friend?
And the Factious rave and thunder,
When, trial denied, high chiefs have died,
And various 'vons' gone under;
When the President vows he will resign,
And then, somehow or other,
Is moved to sign a note benign,
Saying, 'Well done, brave brother!'

Man scarcely needs such trivial deeds
As Dillinger's or Capone's,
When a leader rash with a funny moustache,
Goes bumping off his cronies 
Putting the lot right on the spot,
While the common people shiver
Lest a word ill-said bring a crack on the head,
Or a pellet of lead in the liver.

Quiet homes aflood in a bath of blood 
Where else in the world could it happen,
Save in the land of that queer-named band
Like Roehm and Jung and Papen?
Is it all a fight for Freedom's right,
Or for Tyranny, Freedom's whittler,
When the Blackshirts shout and the gangs go out,
Hitting it up with Hitler

When we met the first time at Ch’ang-an
He called me the ‘Lost Immortal’.
Then he loved the Way of Forgetting.
Now under the pine-trees he is dust.
His golden keepsake bought us wine.
Remembering, the tears run down my cheeks. 

Ho, everyone that thirsteth
And hath the price to give,
Come to the stolen waters,
Drink and your soul shall live.

Come to the stolen waters,
And leap the guarded pale,
And pull the flower in season
Before desire shall fail.

It shall not last for ever,
No more than earth and skies;
But he that drinks in season
Shall live before he dies.

June suns, you cannot store them
To warm the winter's cold,
The lad that hopes for heaven
Shall fill his mouth with mold. 

Rouse ye, Yankees, from your dreaming!
See that vessel, strong and bold,
On her banner proudly streaming,
California for gold!
See a crowd around her gather,
Eager all to push from land!
They will have all sorts o' weather
Ere they reach the golden strand.
Rouse to action,
Fag and faction;
Ho, for mines of wealth untold!
Rally! Rally!
All for Cali-
Fornia in search of gold!
Away, amid the rush and racket,
Ho for the California packet!

Wake ye! O'er the surging ocean,
Loud above each coral cave,
Comes a sound of wild commotion
From the lands beyond the wave.
Riches, riches, greater--rarer,
Than Golconda's far-famed mines;
Ho for California's shores!
Where the gold so brightly shines.
O'er the ocean
All's commotion;
Ho for mines of wealth untold!
Countless treasure
Waits on pleasure;
Ho for California's gold!
Let us go the rush and racket,
On the Californian packet.

Hear the echo wildly ringing
Through our country far and wide!
Thousands leaving home and springing
Into the resistless tide.
Now our nation's roused from sleeping,
All alert and wide awake.
O, there's no such thing as keeping
Folks asleep when gold's the stake!
Old Oregon
We'll look not on;
Ho, for mines of wealth untold!
We'll take our way,
Without delay,
In search of gold--of glittering gold!
Here we go, amid the racket,
On the Californian packet!

Yankees! all who have the fever,
Go the rush without delay!
Take a spade and don your beaver;
Tell your friends you must away!
You will get a sight o' money;
Reap perhaps a hundred-fold!
O, it would be precious funny
To sit in a hall of gold!
Let's be going,
Gales are blowing,
Ho, all hands for digging gold!
Romance throwing
Colors glowing
Round these mines of wealth untold!
Ho, we go amid the racket,
On the Californian packet

In the cloud gray mornings 
I heard the herons Flying 
And when I came into my garden, 
My silken outer-garment 
Trailed over withered leaves. 
A dried leaf crumbles at a touch, 
But I have seen many Autumns 
With herons blowing like smoke 
Across the sky. 

A father's pride I used to know,
A mother's love was mine;
For swinish husks I let them go,
And bedded with the swine.
Since then I've come on evil days
And most of life is hell;
But even swine have winsome ways
When once you know them well.

One time I guessed I'd cease to roam,
And greet the folks again;
And so I rode the rods to home
And through the window pane
I saw them weary, worn and grey . . .
I gazed from the garden gloom,
And like sweet, shiny saints were they
Int taht sweet, shiny room.

D'ye think I hollored out: "Hullo!"
The prodigal to play,
And eat the fatted calf? Ah no,
I cursed and ran away.
My eyes were blears of whisky tears
As to a pub I ran:
But once at least I beat the beast
And proved myself a man.

Oh, some day I am going back,
But I'll have gold galore;
I'll wear a suit of sobber black
And knock upon the door.
I'l tell them how I've made a stake,
We'll have the grandest time. . . .
"Say, Mister, give a guy a break:
For Chrissake, spare a dime

"He plays with other boys when work is done,
But feels too clumsy and too stiff to run,
Yet where there's mischief he can find a way
The first to join and last [to run] away.
What's said or done he never hears or minds
But gets his pence for all the eggs he finds.
He thinks his master's horses far the best,
And always labours longer than the rest.
In frost and cold though lame he's forced to go--
The call's more urgent when he journeys slow.
In surly speed he helps the maids by force
And feeds the cows and hallos till he's hoarse;
And when he's lame they only jest and play
And bid him throw his kiby heels away. 

OF mortal parents is the Hero born
By whom the undaunted Tyrolese are led?
Or is it Tell's great Spirit, from the dead
Returned to animate an age forlorn?
He comes like Phoebus through the gates of morn
When dreary darkness is discomfited,
Yet mark his modest state! upon his head,
That simple crest, a heron's plume, is worn.
O Liberty! they stagger at the shock
From van to rear--and with one mind would flee, 
But half their host is buried:--rock on rock
Descends:--beneath this godlike Warrior, see!
Hills, torrents, woods, embodied to bemock
The Tyrant, and confound his cruelty.

Spring

The year's first poem done, 
with smug self confidence
a haikai poet.

Longer has become the daytime; 
a pheasant is fluttering 
down onto the bridge.

Yearning for the Bygones

Lengthening days, 
accumulating, and recalling 
the days of distant past.

Slowly passing days, 
with an echo heard here in a 
corner of Kyoto.

The white elbow 
of a priest, dozing, 
in the dusk of spring.

Into a nobleman, 
a fox has changed himself 
early evening of spring.

The light on a candle stand 
is transferred to another candle 
spring twilight.

A short nap, 
then awakening
this spring day has darkened.

Who is it for, 
this pillow on the floor, 
in the twilight of spring?

The big gateway's heavy doors, 
standing in the dusk of spring.

Hazy moonlight -- 
someone is standing 
among the pear trees.

Blossoms on the pear tree, 
lighten by the moonlight, and there 
a woman is reading a letter.

Springtime rain -- almost dark, 
and yet today still lingers.

Springtime rain -- 
a little shell on a small beach, 
enough to moisten it.

Springtime rain is falling, 
as a child's rag ball is soaking 
wet on the house roof.







 

Within the quietness 
of a lull in visitors' absence, 
appears the peony flower!

Peony having scattered, two 
or three petals lie on one another.

The rain of May -- 
facing toward the big river, houses, 
just two of them.

At a Place Called Kaya in Tanba

A summer river being crossed, 
how pleasing, 
with sandals in my hands!

The mountain stonecutter's chisel; 
being cooled in the clear water.

Grasses wet in the rain, 
just after the festival cart passed by.

To my eyes how delightful 
the fan of my beloved is, 
in complete white.

A flying cuckoo, 
over the Heian capital, 
goes diagonally across the city.

Evening breeze -- 
water is slapping against 
the legs of a blue heron.

An old well -- 
jumping at a mosquito, 
the fish's sound is dark.

Young bamboo trees -- 
at Hashimoto, the courtesan, 
is she still there or not?

After having been fallen, 
its image still stands -- 
the peony flower.

Stepping on the Eastern Slope

Wild roses in bloom -- 
so like a pathway in, 
or toward, my home village.

With sorrow while coming upon the hill 
--flowering wild roses.

Summer night ending so soon, 
with on the river shallows still remains 
the moon in a sliver.





It penetrates into me; 
stepping on the comb of my gone wife, 
in the bedroom.

More than last year, 
I now feel solitude; 
this autumn twilight.

This being alone may even be a kind of happy 
-- in the autumn dusk.

Moon in the sky's top, 
clearly passes through this 
poor town street.

This feeling of sadness -- 
a fishing string being blown by the autumn wind.






Let myself go to bed; 
New Year's Day is only a matter 
for tomorrow.

Camphor tree roots are quietly getting wet, 
in the winter rainy air.

A handsaw is sounding, 
as if from a poor one, 
at midnight in this winter.

Old man's love affair; 
in trying to forget it, 
a winter rainfall.

In an old pond, 
a straw sandal is sinking 
-- it is sleeting. 

walking on the moors thinking about how I didn't meet you yesterday 
heather underfoot and mist over Pendle 
the moor changing like an animal/brown to green grey to 
purple with the weather 
sky blue at the edges 
like a letter that came too late .
. . . Undine rising from the maters her golden hair
dripping in the moonlight . . . dead bird on a fence blood
dripping from its neck . . . Isis ,searching the rushes
for her murdered lover . . . small girl with a fishing rod
in a rushing valley full of ferns . . . the last . 

supper
followed by the Four lust Desserts . . . watching the
white mocking figure at the edge of the Dark


Forest
. . . beating naked blond haired girls with
long stemmed purple flowers . . . Osiris judging
the dead mist rising up the valley seaweed tangled
in her moonlight hair . . .

 

trains 
moving through valleys 
chimneys 
springing from hillsides 
streams 
tumbling through boulders 
clouds 
tilting from the horizon 
and 
me 
on the moors thinking about the girl I never met. 

He came one night, in a drifting dream; 
Setting a unsettling thought.
Like a poor cricketer 
On wrong foot I was caught

I always dreamed of happy days 
Selfish and full of taste
Little thought spent over 
My weltanschauung
That seemed a complete waste

I didn’t lend a helping hand 
To someone in need 
Nor anything worthy 
To someone desolate indeed

A life of hopes and aspiration 
For myself and only me 
I never held myself a mirror 
Reflecting a real me. 

Time’s slipping in a manner grand 
Like dust particles out of my hand
Life’s frittered away in unequal installments
The remorse of a guilty soul 
Came to me as a whole 

I woke up, not to sleep again 
My righteous self with me to remain 
All my life 
.
To walk the talk and walk till end 
An opportunity godsend
To do some good before death
To breathe at last a benevolent breath 

Here I am, in desert’s sand 
Fire above and fire below
May help an inside glow 
An unseen mirror to refract 
In me what’s been intact 

Hold that mirror in my heart 
Till the day I finally depart 
A head held high 
No bend at waist 
Shall live my life to his taste


Hold hard, these ancient minutes in the cuckoo's month,
Under the lank, fourth folly on Glamorgan's hill,
As the green blooms ride upward, to the drive of time;
Time, in a folly's rider, like a county man
Over the vault of ridings with his hound at heel,
Drives forth my men, my children, from the hanging south.

Country, your sport is summer, and December's pools
By crane and water-tower by the seedy trees
Lie this fifth month unstaked, and the birds have flown;
Holy hard, my country children in the world if tales,
The greenwood dying as the deer fall in their tracks,
The first and steepled season, to the summer's game.

And now the horns of England, in the sound of shape,
Summon your snowy horsemen, and the four-stringed hill,
Over the sea-gut loudening, sets a rock alive;
Hurdles and guns and railings, as the boulders heave,
Crack like a spring in vice, bone breaking April,
Spill the lank folly's hunter and the hard-held hope.

Down fall four padding weathers on the scarlet lands,
Stalking my children's faces with a tail of blood,
Time, in a rider rising, from the harnessed valley;
Hold hard, my country darlings, for a hawk descends,
Golden Glamorgan straightens, to the falling birds.
Your sport is summer as the spring runs angrily. 

Dear merciful father you hold
You hold very tight in light
Dear love you give me in right
I am now in your track only.

I know you give without urging
I get everything near me daily
Just like flower blooms nearby
I bloom for you in eternal love.

I feel my eternity in new light
As you spread fragrance of life
I awake with certainty of self
My conscience teaches me laws.

Oh dear father, you hold me ever
In your lap in light of wisdom
I am eagerly waiting for you
I know you are coming near soon. 

This world is hard.
But you don’t have to go.
This world is gone.
But you can’t let go.
This life is sad, 
We all know.
You’re all alone and no one hears you.
Just know that we all bleed the same way as you do.
Just know that we  all have the same things to go through.
Just hold on.
Hold on if you feel like letting go.
Keep your grip tight or you’ll sink real low.
You’re all alone, and you’re sick of it.
You feel so sad, 
No one seems to care.
This pain you cannot bare.
Just hold on, 
If you feel like letting go.
Hold on, it gets better than you know.
Just hold on, 
You can’t let go. 

Hold on to your dreams, 
just never let them fade.
When the child inside you screams, 
don't let his voice abrade.

It's the dream that pushes you
to achieve the so called impossible.
Let the fire inside you 
illuminate your future, so desirable.

The dreams of today will be
the accomplishments of tomorrow.
To the path you have chosen, 
the world will follow. 

Sweet moment, stay with me, 
and pray do not flee so soon, 
Let me enjoy the bliss of that
	                        

	                        
	                          .  
	                        

	                        
	                          .  


and pray do not flee so soon, 
Let me enjoy the bliss of that
first kiss beneath the moon.
I wish to cradle this feeling, 
that has only just been found, 
A feeling that has unexpectedly
turned my world around.
Do not depart, Oh please remain
within my heart awhile, 
So that I can savour you once more, 
and hold you in my smile. 

Hold your mad hands! for ever on your plain 
Must the gorged vulture clog his beak with blood? 
For ever must your Niger's tainted flood, 
Roll to the ravenous shark his banquet slain? 
Hold your mad hands! and learn at length to know, 
And turn your vengeance on the common foe, 
Yon treacherous vessel and her godless crew! 
Let never traders with false pretext fair 
Set on your shores again their wicked feet: 
With interdict and indignation meet 
Repel them, and with fire and sword pursue! 
Avarice, the white cadaverous fiend, is there, 
Who spreads his toils accursed wide and far, 
And for his purveyor calls the demon War. 

Why do you hold back the tears
Are you afraid they won't stop
Will those flood gates open 
Of all in life you have lost

How do you smile each day
With all the pain you have suffered
Smiling to make others smile
Yet way down inside are you bluffing

You see the pain of others and want to soothe their pain
It is an enormous feel of success
When you see the smiles you gain

Will you get through this heartache
The hardest pain of all
Forever climbing a mountain
To avoid a dangerous fall

You know you must keep rolling
Having seen others climb higher
There is a gift in each new day
And a will to inspire

Create your own outcome
Believe there is away
Hide from any darkness
See light in each new day

Are you holding back to save the makeup
Smudging on your face
Or is it that positive feeling
And the words of.. 'Amazing Grace'. 

Believe





THIS IS NOT FAREWELL.  

UNTIL ANOTHER
TIME.  

ANOTHER PLACE.

So many days.  

weeks.  

years, have past, since
you traveled that star crossed journey, to the far beyond.

Ten thousand times, I've heard the words, 'And now
you must go on.'

How can I go on, without the other half, 
of who I am? 

A man with half of heat, half of mind, half

of my very soul.  

how then, do I go on? 

Never a fruit, or treat or delight, held the
sweetness of your lips, that I hunger now to kiss.

When I sleep, from a foggy haze, a light appears, 
as you come to me, in lands of dreams.

When the morning birds, do sing their songs, 
you slide down a ray of sunshine and touch
my wanting lips.

In every note, of every song, you voice is
heard.  

like a never ending melody.

The flowers, hold your beauty and
the haunting scent of who you were.

In the magic of a summers night, the
moon is all aglow, and everything
reminds me, of you.  

you.  

you.

As the wind plays the violin, through
trees and leaves above, that too, reminds
me, of you, my one true love.

In all the good, in all of life, in every where
and everything.  

bring forth, the thoughts of you.

So then, and when the words are spoken, 
'You must go on, ' my answer has and always
will be. 

'How? '

Wait for me, behind the stars, and then, I
shall go on.




that eventually, 
Those we love-leave us behind.
The breaking dawn
Is here and gone, 
Its beauty etched within the mind.
Each late night talk
each path you walked
Means more right now, than others know
It's priceless art
kept in the heart
When holding on.  but letting go

Some days are good
some days are bad
Some days you feel so all alone.
On bended knees
the memories
Come back while fingers brush etched stone.
For those who pray
there comes a day
A joyous reunion, this we know.
When the one you love
You're just holding on.  but letting go. 

Saint Columban is
Bent on always holding on
hanging by destiny's thread, 
predicting the collapse
with an apparent certainty: —

it is ravishing! 
the ravage of time
cannot shake it; 
announcing its finale! 

what strength
courage
or magic
keeps this dying love alive? 

what hope
with its obstinacy, 
what faith in magic myths
becoming reality

in a life 
that is consumed by time? 
are we not drowning
in our own illusions? 

could there be 
a divagation from the trajectory? 
can our love, somehow, 
not perish in the end

Holding time still, 
It is not possible I know; 

Freedom from time
Is impossible to get, I am aware; 

Taming time or its passage
Are next to impossible to me; 

Still I long for transcending time
To free myself from aches, pains, hurts, 
Worries, fears, anxieties, apprehensions; 

Thoughts make me worried, anxious
Frightened, apprehensive and painful, and rarely pleasant; 

I wish to be free from all these, 

The past and the future, 
the memory and apprehension; 
the two phases of Time; 

That cause inconvenience to me
And torture me occasionally.

But unless I transcend
The functioning of my mind and be a mere seer

I cannot hold time still
And attain freedom to be still; 

How I wish for peace, 
Bliss and silence; 
To dawn and dwell in me! 

To hold time still
By, me becoming one with
The Divinity, the Self
Freeing myself
From vicissitudes and vagaries of time-conscious mind
Making my mind still and tranquil; 

I long to hold time still and be tranquil
Till my breath stops and body becomes still

How I wish for peace, bliss and silence, 
When my unreal "I" merges in such serene essence; 

Then seconds may become minutes; 
Minutes hours and hours, days; 

Days months, months years, and decades, 
Centuries, millennium; 

I always remain a flow of tranquility

How I wish to hold time still
And be free from time
In serene times
When my mind merges in its source, the Self!

Here I sit because I did not choose
To waste my life in the empty living room
But in actual fact, I had nothing much to loose
It was the holidays, and I was young

Here I lie because I did refrain 
From squeezing into the sardine-packed train
Thinking of all those who breathe down my neck
Will send me into a nervous wreck

Here I decay because I did agree
To snack on Chips and watch TV
Until the sun’s down and the cows come home
I’ll still be forever alone

Here I type to avoid suspicion
From the librarian who took a curious peek
For someone to stare motionlessly at Google
Is a weird occurrence indeed

Here I stand upon the reception counter
To borrow a crystalized essence of thought
Maybe A Thousand Splendid Suns will brighten my day
And flush my boredom away

So here I start my little reverie 
In the comfort of my turquoise-colored room
But no sooner will I’ll slip back into my shell
And be asleep until the next morning bell. 

And thus I slouch because I did reject
The invitation to rave with the noisy, boisterous rest
A little fun is not time that was to lose
But it was holiday boredom, and I was young. 

I would rather stick my fingers in a fan
I would rather eat dog food from a can
Than sit with relatives and pretend to have fun
Than sit with relatives and pretend we are one

I would rather obsess over Pee Wee Herman
That sit with old folks who only speak German
I would rather fill my butt with Carpenter's nails
Than listen to another round of Old Wive's tales

There's nothing more evil the devil could conceive
Holiday in Hell, isn't it swell


The holiest of all holidays are those
Kept by ourselves in silence and apart;
The secret anniversaries of the heart,
When the full river of feeling overflows;--
The happy days unclouded to their close;
The sudden joys that out of darkness start
As flames from ashes; swift desires that dart
Like swallows singing down each wind that blows!
White as the gleam of a receding sail,
White as a cloud that floats and fades in air,
White as the whitest lily on a stream,
These tender memories are;--a fairy tale
Of some enchanted land we know not where,
But lovely as a landscape in a dream. 

A deep assurance
In all instances


New fad, in Hollywood. Say anything or
do anything, then go into rehab and all
is forgiven.

After cheating on my wife, I tried that. When
I got out of rehab, she shot me, right in the balls! 


The Bible and the TV guide.
The TV guide is well worn, 
The Bible often set aside.

One is opened to plan the
Entertainment of the day.
And tells you how to pray.

TV shows have no value.
Did you notice the bed scenes? 
Hollywood sets the morals, 
How do they affect your dreams? 

Is your marriage getting stronger
As you consume the filthy trash? 
Or does it lead to discontentment
And cause you and your spouse to clash? 

The Bible contains some prophesies
And many serious predictions.
Wouldn't you be better off reading it
Than watching all the useless fictions? 

Do you find some entertainment
Watching killing, blood and gore? 
Do you find yourself wanting
To see more of it, and more? 

How do you think it affects you? 
Do you want to get a gun? 
Do you want to pull the trigger
And kill the Father and the Son? 

The Bible tells of some killings, 
Some of good people, some of bad.
We will surely end up glad.

But if we ignore Him
And don't pray for our schools, 
It will be the Devil that
Will be setting all the rules

As seen through the eyes of those who witnessed first hand, 
 and  liberated the scenes of the Holocaust


The rain how it fell; the cadaver smell
My eyes transfixed on that pit of Hell, 
Vapid flesh foul, horrendously bland.
But why this carnage, I don’t understand; 

Retching, gagging, holding back the bile.
I turn from the evil to rest for a while, 
From decomposing mothers, fathers and child; 
Satan’s work, merciless, callously wild.

Laid out in graves grotesquely remorse, 
Lucifer’s carnage has taken its course
In a dance of death, contorted and thin, 
Thousands of bodies, bound together by skin.

Now sixty years passed, will I ever forget.
That day when in person, with Satan I met; 
He showed me firsthand his evil, his sin.
Flames of contempt still burn deep within.

Wise men instruct us ‘we must never, forget’, 
Upon the memory of them, ‘let the sun never set’; 
For six million Jews paid the ultimate cost, 
I know, I was there, at the great Holocaust. 

We played, we laughed
we were loved.
We were ripped from the arms of our
parents and thrown into the fire.
We were nothing more than children.
We had a future. We were going to be lawyers, rabbis, wives, teachers, mothers. We had dreams, then we had no hope. We were taken away in the dead of night like cattle in cars, no air to breathe smothering, crying, starving, dying. Separated from the world to be no more. From the ashes, hear our plea. This atrocity to mankind can not happen again. Remember us, for we were the children whose dreams and lives were stolen away. 

They all stood still, juxtaposed, 
sore exhausted from the hate; 
some had lost their Religion, 
could observe such anathema, 
with His Angels, His Saints, 
and not interface with Abaddon, 
and abrogate the carnage, 
render mercy to innocence.
Still, the persecuted faithful
wore their Judgement Day best 
upon their hearts, for themselves 
and for the souls that were taken
as their number had been called, 
and no longer stood along beside them. 

'No pyrrhic badge this be'! 
[לא יהיה זה התג פירוס] 
cried one Jew, in his native tongue, 
ankles bruised, shins raw
from steel leg-iron shackles, 
his final words, historic echoes of ' 
through the thick, flesh-smoked air
of a chared, rainsoaked night, 
of a sad movement soon to feel 
administering justice 
in the form of damnation. . 

forever.

suffered in spite of their mortal
strength, that cold, wet night
many dying as they killed; 
Will ne'er forsake His children. 




After some days- - -
The dust blown by
The tornado will settle
Flood water will go back to the stream
Black clouds will fly away

But- - - - - 
The charred images of 
beautiful flowers
Half brunt stump of
A fruit giving tree
Will take time to heal.

Because seeds of distrust
Spread so swift
They grow so rapidly
Like holocaust
Attacking the green fields
They take away greens
Leave us with no harvest
No flowers and no fruits. 

Holocaust.


Iron pipes that pierce the skyline.
Concrete, white against the blue.
Office blocks, now cold and empty, 
No sun-streaked glass to mar the view.


Empty eyes that gaze unseeing
On a vista stark and bare.
No dogs to foul the empty pavements.
No birdsong on the morning air.


In an alley filled with rubble, 
A rust encrusted laundry van, 
Filled with shrouds, no longer needed
By the creatures they called man.


But hope is born, for time must pass.
In reformed tarmac, a blade of grass. 

It was holocaust after partition 
Little spark had resulted into ignition 
Brothers and neighbors turned into enemy 
It was never wish of any faith or almighty

No one knew what prompted genocide
It was agreed to but didn't result into peaceful divide 
Houses were burnt and millions butchered 
All over the region bodies can be found mutilated and charred 

Was it for peaceful homeland? 
Was there any need for division of motherland? 
No one could answer then as friend 
And not now even at the end 

Two nations came into being with reality
Hostile propaganda coupled with relation in bad quality 
Migration from both sides to take revenge on each other
Lots of refugee problems and future concern to share 

It is difficult to understand hatred theory 
What a shame on humanity to feel so much sorry! 
Murders, loot and burning along the road sides
Miles long queues for crossing the borders on both sides 

Families separated with deep wounds of hostile acts
There was nothing more to offer and react
Both sides had suffered heavily and bore the brunt 
Still people were blood thirsty and continued to hunt 

It is no use to blame any side or show sympathy
People were reeling under pain and felt apathy 
No one was there to wipe their tears
As each one was gripped with the fears 

National anthem was played to celebrate the birth of nation
There was bitterness and strained patches with the relation
No one seemed happy at the heavy price paid for 
It was worst destruction even not faced by war 

Generations after generations may change 
Yet deep wounds may never go with the age 
Ask any one who had not lost his dear one? 
It was bloody partition but price paid by someone 

*  Scene at the time India of Pakistan partition*ON WHICH THE JEWS WERE FORCED TO
ATT
 AN ANNUAL CHRISTIAN SERMON
IN ROME.

  [Now was come about Holy-Cross Day,
and now must my lord preach his first sermon
to the Jews: as it was of old cared for in tine
merciful bowels of the Church, that, so to
speak, a crumb at least from her conspicuous
table here in Rome should be, though but
once yearly, cast to the famishing dogs, under-trampled
and bespitten-upon beneath the feet
of the guests.  And a moving sight in truth,
this, of so many of the besotted blind restif
and ready-to-perish Hebrews! now maternally
brought---nay (for He saith, `Compel them
to come in') haled, as it were, by the head and
hair, and against their obstinate hearts, to partake
of the heavenly grace.  What awakening,
what striving with tears, what working of a
yeasty conscience!  Nor was my lord wanting
to himself on so apt an occasion; witness
the abundance of conversions which did incontinently
reward him: though not to my
lord be altogether the glory.''---_Diary by the
Bishop's Secretary,_ ]

  What the Jews really said, on thus being
driven to church, was rather to this effect:---

	I.

Fee, faw, fum! bubble and squeak!
Blessedest Thursday's the fat of the week.
Rumble and tumble, sleek and rough,
Stinking and savoury, simug and gruff,
Take the church-road, for the bell's due chime
Gives us the summons---'tis sermon-time!

	II.

Bob, here's Barnabas!  Job, that's you?
Up stumps Solomon---bustling too?
Shame, man! greedy beyond your years
To handsel the bishop's shaving-shears?
Fair play's a jewel!  Leave friends in the lurch?
Stand on a line ere you start for the church!

	III.

Higgledy piggledy, packed we lie,
Rats in a hamper, swine in a stye,
Wasps in a bottle, frogs in a sieve,
Worms in a carcase, fleas in a sleeve.
Hist! square shoulders, settle your thumbs
And buzz for the bishop---here he comes.

	IV.

Bow, wow, wow---a bone for the dog!
I liken his Grace to an acorned hog.
What, a boy at his side, with the bloom of a lass,
To help and handle my lord's hour-glass!
Didst ever behold so lithe a chine?
His cheek hath laps like a fresh-singed swine.

	V.

Aaron's asleep---shove hip to haunch,
Or somebody deal him a dig in the paunch!
Look at the purse with the tassel and knob,
And the gown with the angel and thingumbob!
What's he at, quotha? reading his text!
Now you've his curtsey---and what comes next?

	VI.

See to our converts---you doomed black dozen---
No stealing away---nor cog nor cozen!
You five, that were thieves, deserve it fairly;
You seven, that were beggars, will live less sparely;
You took your turn and dipped in the hat,
Got fortune---and fortune gets you; mind that!

	VII.

Give your first groan---compunction's at work;
And soft! from a Jew you mount to a Turk.
Lo, Micah,---the selfsame beard on chin
He was four times already converted in!
Here's a knife, clip quick---it's a sign of grace---
Or he ruins us all with his hanging-face.

	VIII.

Whom now is the bishop a-leering at?
I know a point where his text falls pat.
I'll tell him to-morrow, a word just now
Went to my heart and made me vow
I meddle no more with the worst of trades---
Let somebody else pay his serenades.

	IX.

Groan all together now, whee-hee-hee!
It's a-work, it's a-work, ah, woe is me!
It began, when a herd of us, picked and placed,
Were spurred through the Corso, stripped to the waist;
Jew brutes, with sweat and blood well spent

	X.

It grew, when the hangman entered our bounds,
Yelled, pricked us out to his church like hounds:
It got to a pitch, when the hand indeed
Which gutted my purse would throttle my creed:
And it overflows when, to even the odd,

	XI.

But now, while the scapegoats leave our flock,
And the rest sit silent and count the clock,
Since forced to muse the appointed time
On these precious facts and truths sublime,---
Let us fitly ennploy it, under our breath,
In saying Ben Ezra's Song of Death.

	XII.

For Rabbi Ben Ezra, the night he died,
Called sons and sons' sons to his side,
And spoke, This world has been harsh and strange;
Something is wrong: there needeth a change.
But what, or where? at the last or first?
In one point only we sinned, at worst.

	XIII.

And again in his border see Israel set.
When Judah beholds Jerusalem,
The stranger-seed shall be joined to them:
To Jacob's House shall the Gentiles cleave.
So the Prophet saith and his sons believe.

	XIV.

Ay, the children of the chosen race
Shall carry and bring them to their place:
Bondsmen and handmaids.   Who shall blame,
When the slaves enslave, the oppressed ones o'er
The oppressor triumph for evermore?

	XV.

Bade never fold the hands nor sleep
'Mid a faithless world,---at watch and ward,
By His servant Moses the watch was set:
Though near upon cock-crow, we keep it yet.

	XVI.

Thou! if thou wast He, who at mid-watch came,
By the starlight, naming a dubious name!
And if, too heavy with sleep---too rash
With fear---O Thou, if that martyr-gash
Fell on Thee coming to take thine own,
And we gave the Cross, when we owed the Throne---

	XVII.

Thou art the Judge.  We are bruised thus.
But, the Judgment over, join sides with us!
Thine too is the cause! and not more thine
Than ours, is the work of these dogs and swine,
Whose life laughs through and spits at their creed!
Who maintain Thee in word, and defy Thee in deed!

	XVIII.

At least we withstand Barabbas now!
Was our outrage sore?  But the worst we spared,
Let defiance to them pay mistrust of Thee,
And Rome make amends for Calvary!

	XIX.

By the torture, prolonged from age to age,
By the infamy, Israel's heritage,
By the Ghetto's plague, by the garb's disgrace,
By the badge of shame, by the felon's place,
By the branding-tool, the bloody whip,

	XX.

We boast our proof that at least the Jew
Thy face took never so deep a shade
A trophy to bear, as we marchs, thy band,
South, East, and on to the Pleasant Land!''

	[_Pope Gregory XVI. abolished this bad
	  business of the Sermon._---R. B.]Having tasted flesh
Can’t quite mesh
The holy sound
Of spirit found

In dying death
With every breath
Of radical surge
And ethnic purge

Twisted word
Mentality scourge
Bless this meet to grace the table
Watch the flood of human blood

All Pain and Cable


Excerpt from Dr John Celes’ Welcome Speech 
(to be held on 



) 

The Shepherd comes to meet his flock, 
And bless the church that’s newly built, 
Wherein an older church had stood on rock –
A sacred ground of prayer for Catholics! 

Let’s welcome him; let’s welcome him, ye sheep! 
He brings with him his staff that protects us; 
This is the time our hearts with joy must weep; 
The anointing will give us greater bliss.

Of prayer to worship the ‘King of kings’; 
And tread the road to heaven as earthlings.

The Church though small looks splendidly laid out; 
It has been christened ‘Holy Family Church’; 
Our parish is a small one without doubt, 
Nevertheless, peeps in internet-search! 

The flock is one led by our parish priest, 
Father Claudius, a dynamic, young man! 
Who works hard without mistakes in the least; 

Our heart-felt thanks to Bishop and all souls
Who gave the land for building the new Church; 
Our hearty thanks to all who played new roles, 
And doled the sums that can now help to preach.

Let’s worship Him with masses, hymns and pray; 
Let’s reach the world at the click of a mouse! 

Let sweat of foreheads reinforce this base, 
And help to rear this provident LILY! 



The lover glades he never tells; 
And one is mine where mass the bright 
And odoured chimes of foxglove-bells. 

A dewy, covert, silent place 
Close to His creature's blinded face, 
And for his finer moulding talked. 

There hawthorn glows as if, white-hot, 
To preach a creed too oft forgot-- 
That all we tread is holy ground. 

Ah, could we but remember this, 
Our thoughts would spring as purely up 
To labour for our fellows' bliss 
As doth to heaven a snowdrop's cup

Rusty soul and dusty heart 
Dirty eyes with vague images 
Require cleaning to impart 
Sages not on daily wages 

But conviction and selection 
Inner need of one indeed 
Invigorates one to perfection 
Like a newly inborn seed 

Sincerity in worship is all 
It is how we stall to install 
What is kindness & bliss 

Considers them His family  
Insanity touches sanity 
Whether serious or just silly 

Being Master of universe  
He just see and foresee 
Whether constant or diverse 

February 

Cyclic weeping
Overdue
Love flowething
Thro’ virgin breast
O’ Holy Milk
Who made it happen
Fracturing fragrance of trust? 

O’ Fille
Punishment of  
Dwarfing forgiveness
Give why? 

O’ breast feel jamboree
Nip inertia embarrassment.

From gentled breast
Deliver deathless lovehope
Share him hear
Vouched euphonic motherhood
Spilling relentlessly! Ooohing! 

Mete mansion for 
Beau’s face
In sousing tear
Assign you dear
Unborn to honor 
As riches from love
Not lurid lust. 
 
‘Tis Sanctifier.

of praying mantises 
females have to feed by rule 
from males` bodies 
By mating, just after 
courting and dancing, 
while love-making.  
Once there was a mantis born, 
I mean hatched, with lesion 
- kindness in heart.
She refused to eat males 
for breakfast, for lunch, 
even for dinner! (yet a small eater!)                     
Soon the poor creature, 
anomaly of the nature, 
was accused of being a pervert, 
an outcast of a holy society. 
She spent her life in praying, 
writing memoirs and.  love poetry.  
 
The idea came to me after watching a documentary on Animal planet channel on tv. :)                     

Sofia, May hou hast made me, and shall thy work decay?
     Repair me now, for now mine end doth haste,
     I run to death, and death meets me as fast,
     And all my pleasures are like yesterday;
     I dare not move my dim eyes any way,
     Despair behind, and death before doth cast
     Such terror, and my feebled flesh doth waste
     By sin in it, which it t'wards hell doth weigh.
     Only thou art above, and when towards thee
   By thy leave I can look, I rise again;
   But our old subtle foe so tempteth me,
   That not one hour I can myself sustain;
   Thy grace may wing me to prevent his art,
   And thou like adamant draw mine iron heart. 

Thou hast made me, and shall thy work decay?

But our old subtle foe so tempteth me
That not one hour myself I can sustain.
Thy grace may wing me to prevent his art,
And thou like adamant draw mine iron heart. 

What! is it She, which on the other shore
Goes richly painted? or which, robbed and tore,
Laments and mourns in Germany and here?
Sleeps she a thousand, then peeps up one year?
Is she self-truth and errs? now new, now outwore?
Doth she, and did she, and shall she evermore
On one, on seven, or on no hill appear?
Dwells she with us, or like adventuring knights
First travail we to seek and then make love?
Betray, kind husband, thy spouse to our sights,
And let mine amorous soul court thy mild dove,
Who is most true and pleasing to thee then
When she's embraced and open to most men.

Since she whom I lov'd hath paid her last debt
     To nature, and to hers, and my good is dead,
     And her soul early into heaven ravished,
     Wholly in heavenly things my mind is set.
     Here the admiring her my mind did whet
     But though I have found thee, and thou my thirst hast fed,
     A holy thirsty dropsy melts me yet.
     But why should I beg more love, whenas thou
   Dost woo my soul, for hers off'ring all thine,
   And dost not only fear lest I allow
   My love to saints and angels, things divine,
   But in thy tender jealousy dost doubt
   Lest the world, flesh, yea devil put thee out. 

The Laws of Physics say
That Everyone Dies
And is Gone: 
Every blade of grass, insect, man and woman.
Every sentient being.
From Big Bang to Big Whatever. 
They all Die.

Yet is there more than this? 
Something of the spirit.
More than ghosts
And poltergeists.
An afterlife
In Heaven.
Another Realm.

Some say that when you die
You re-join The One Being, 

Your individuality may be gone, 
But you become part of that Super-Consciousness, 
The One, 
And thus Remain.

The logic of this is frightening: 
Just going through a phase
We call Life, 
In readiness for
For Ever.

And logic dictates
That I am my own Mum and Dad, 
My sister, friends and everyone else: 
Mother Theresa, Hitler, Shakespeare
And Eddie The Eagle.

I am a wasp, a lion, a dolphin, a tree
Maybe even a germ.
Another poet
I’m even You.

Better get on with it then.
I’ve got plenty to do

O
Out of a bed of love
When that immortal hospital made one more moove to soothe
The curless counted body,
And ruin and his causes
Over the barbed and shooting sea assumed an army
And swept into our wounds and houses,
I climb to greet the war in which I have no heart but only
That one dark I owe my light,
Call for confessor and wiser mirror but there is none
To glow after the god stoning night
And I am struck as lonely as a holy marker by the sun

No
Praise that the spring time is all
Gabriel and radiant shrubbery as the morning grows joyful
Out of the woebegone pyre
And the multitude's sultry tear turns cool on the weeping wall,
My arising prodgidal
Sun the father his quiver full of the infants of pure fire,
But blessed be hail and upheaval
That uncalm still it is sure alone to stand and sing
Alone in the husk of man's home
And the mother and toppling house of the holy spring,
If only for a last time. 

Is this a holy thing to see.
In a rich and fruitful land.
Babes reduced to misery.
Fed with cold and usurous hand?

Is that trembling cry a song?
Can it be a song of joy?
And so many children poor?
It is a land of poverty!

And their sun does never shine.
And their fields are bleak & bare.
And their ways are fill'd with thorns
It is eternal winter there.

For where-e'er the sun does shine.
And where-e'er the rain does fall:
Babe can never hunger there,
Nor poverty the mind appall. 

Twas on a Holy Thursday their innocent faces clean
The children walking two & two in red & blue & green
Grey headed beadles walked before with wands as white as snow
Till into the high dome of Pauls they like Thames waters flow

O what a multitude they seemed these flowers of London town
Seated in companies they sit with radiance all their own
The hum of multitudes was there but multitudes of lambs
Thousands of little boys & girls raising their innocent hands

Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song
Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among
Beneath them sit the aged men wise guardians of the poor
Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door


From where, in the beginning emerged
The Universe; and in the end where embedded
All these planets, skies and oceans
Rivers, dales and tall mountains
Colours, scents and flavours
Charms of all shapes and forms
Grace of every phenomenon
Seen, sensed and savored
As part of every day routine
Ever imagined thou! Their origin
That power pool of eternal blaze
The source and sorbent in one
Lo! It is the holy trine! Mother divine! 
Not just the woman! A mortal effigy
Oppressed under hombre hoofs
But know her as sacred pneuma
Take my word! All my fellow men
Whatever be her worldly nomen
Sister, daughter, wife or mistress
She is always the Holy Mother 
In whose heavenly ardor
You are destined to dissolve
In life and after


I wandered through Scoglietto's far retreat,
The oranges on each o'erhanging spray
Burned as bright lamps of gold to shame the day;
Some startled bird with fluttering wings and fleet
Made snow of all the blossoms; at my feet
Like silver moons the pale narcissi lay:
And the curved waves that streaked the great green bay
Laughed i' the sun, and life seemed very sweet.
Outside the young boy-priest passed singing clear,
O come and fill His sepulchre with flowers.'
Had drowned all memory of Thy bitter pain,
The Cross, the Crown, the Soldiers and the Spear. 

these hips are big hips.
they need space to 
move around in.
they don't fit into little
petty places. these hips
are free hips.
they don't like to be held back.
these hips have never been enslaved,
they go where they want to go 
they do what they want to do. 
these hips are mighty hips.
these hips are magic hips.
i have known them
to put a spell on a man and 
spin him like a top


Carmi suggested this poem paying homage to a bird, 
but first I had to consult a book to get a definition of that word.
'Homage' definition #is 'special honor or respect. . 

publicly' shown.
Is the special honor therefore having ones flesh cut off ones bones? 

Perhaps instead the honor comes in being 'served' with ceremony
at Thanksgiving, when a turkey's status soars above that of baloney.
As a kid I'd join for holiday feasts with assorted kin, 
and await the carving of the naked headless bird with the golden skin.

Hours in a hot oven, accompanied by periodic basting, 
produced a festive centerpiece which was well worth tasting.
And from its drippings gravy was made to drench potatoes yummy, 
and cooked inside the bird was spicy stuffing, soon to fill my tummy.

And when the bones were stripped of meat, with none left for the flies, 
I'd seek out the wishbone, the potentially-lucky prize.

So here's to you, the Turkey, who Ben Franklin thought much of.
We hope you rest in avian peace, when you reach Turkey Heaven above. 

How brightly glistening in the sun
       The woodland ivy plays!
While yonder beeches from their barks
       Reflect his silver rays. 
That sun surveys a lovely scene
       From softly smiling skies;
And wildly through unnumbered trees
       The wind of winter sighs:

Now loud, it thunders o'er my head,
       And now in distance dies.
But give me back my barren hills
       Where colder breezes rise;

Where scarce the scattered, stunted trees
       Can yield an answering swell,
But where a wilderness of heath
       Returns the sound as well.

For yonder garden, fair and wide,
       With groves of evergreen,
Long winding walks, and borders trim,
       And velvet lawns between;

Restore to me that little spot,
       With grey walls compassed round,
Where knotted grass neglected lies,
       And weeds usurp the ground.

Though all around this mansion high
       Invites the foot to roam,
And though its halls are fair within -- 
       Oh, give me back my HOME!

Acton"Where shall we dwell?" say you. 
   Wandering winds reply: 
"In a temple with roof of blue 
   -- Under the splendid sky
 


Never a nobler home 
   We'll find though an age we try 
Than is arched by the azure dome 
   Of the all-enfolding sky. 

Here we are wed, and here 
"Where shall we dwell," my dear? 
   Under the splendid sky. 

sitting on the deck
with charcoal softly fading
we savor silence


from Each Day (You remind me of winter nights
Cold snow crunching under foot.
My breath fogging in the air.
The cold crisp smell of pine.

The feel of you all soft and downy.
Your nose tucked under and your breathing loud.
And then I rub you on the head
You purr and make me smile. 

Fingers slide, 
down an immaculate frame, 
Eyes watch, 
my thoughts do the same, 
Lips quiver, in the heat of such desire, 
my lust is burning, no ice could sate this fire, 

Every inch your fingers touch, 
Scorches my skin, 
branding me with your love, 
Movement no longer slow, 
so much more delibrate, 
falling upon anything, 
we need but only touch, 
perhaps a longing ear, 
as moans escape, 
the lips I need, 
I fall back down, 
into this heated embrace, 
and lie my ear over, 
that in which I took.

'Your heart so much more, 
than a simple organ.  
it's the very home, 
I long to reside in.

'Introduction: Hope in Freedom.  

The sentiment to rise within.

Home is where our lives survive, 
Orphans don't know how to thrive
My soul prays to see a change, 

I know what you wish to feel, 
Sure Almighty will help you heal

Life will find its way to you
Inside yourself you know it's true, 
Find a way and skip this pain
Explore your fate before it rains. 

I take a walk everyday, 
To reach my Destination.
But I can't get to it anytime, 
It gets away from my vision.
I know Hills play,  such trick always, 
I know the sky does the same, 
But my destination that I want to go 
Is playing the mirage game? 
 
I say 'No' to my skeptical mind, 
 Say 'Yes' to start the walk. 
 The home I can not ever find.
  I blame my ailing luck

We were the children of poverty
And upon our shoulders lay the itemized responsibilities

As other children catch spiders
I was there repairing the leaking roof with papa

As others chase dragonflies and trap birds
I was there pasturing the cows and watching the carabaos

It went on and on even when i have become a man

As others went for the dance i was there cleaning the car
And scrubbing the floors into shining surfaces of pride

As others married the women of their dreams
I was there burning my eyebrows in the university of life

Everything i had i thought was a suffering
But Papa is right

My feet are on the ground
And then i have a house, a car, land, money, and a name

Except love and some things that money and fame cannot
buy.

I guess he is right, i have a home of the past
But the future is still dimly lit, a shadow of a wall

A smoke from the kitchen, an ash in the garden, 
Stones and pebbles on my feet

I can never be complete, just like anyone else. 

Oh sweet home
I am here 
But devoid of nostalgia
And parnephanelia of home.
My mother is gone
To meet my father
Who left long ago.

The kitchen is shut
And the chicken pen is deserted
Every place here smells stale
And my sibblings 
Have wilted like hot
Geysers have poured upon them.

I have come 
With my freshness
But a contagion of staleness
Is upon my head
I am running
Running to where? 
I do not know. 

The people I love
take me home. 
I want to love you
on my way home. 
because we love, 
that is home.


I saw old versions of me 
trying out for life

from Insecurities (The boy I learned to live from
He was out on the streets
The city lights shimmered subliminally, but he kept in the shades
The only one who could see him a country girl
With soft memories of a summer love

Have you ever seen him since? 
A gambler's heart took him away
He touched my heart like no one else never can
Like the sky blue before a ship bound for the sea
Out of reach, I'll wait on the shore

Learn to fly and cross oceans
A morning fresh as the sun reflected in a skyscraper's glass
The wind blowing his sweet words back to me
I open the door
And let him in


This place I once called home is no longer my home, 
I am better off alone, 
I know that you don’t care about me, 
When you come home I am already stoned, 
All you do is scream at me, 
All you do is hit me when I don’t listen, 
This is not my home, 
I think I am better off alone, 
By the time I come home I know that your not home, 
When you get the chance all you do grape at me, 
No matter how hard I have tried, 
You were never satisfied, 
This house is not home, 
This place I once loved, 
Now hated by few, 
All you do is scream, grape, and hit me, 
All I want to do is cut and bleed, 
Yell and cry out all my tears, 
This place is not my home, 
I think I am better off alone. 

Years I had been from home,
And now, before the door
I dared not open, lest a face
I never saw before 

Stare vacant into mine
And ask my business there.
My business, - just a life I left,
Was such still dwelling there? 

I fumbled at my nerve,
I scanned the windows near;
The silence like an ocean rolled,
And broke against my ear. 

I laughed a wooden laugh
That I could fear a door,
Who danger and the dead had faced,
But never quaked before. 

I fitted to the latch
My hand, with trembling care,
Lest back the awful door should spring,
And leave me standing there. 

I moved my fingers off
As cautiously as glass,
And held my ears, and like a thief
Fled gasping from the house. 

Give me a reason, for not sleeping
In this contest of life I’m awake but dreaming
There must be something, something I’m missing
Full of retorts and rage my mind is bleeding

I lost my sight and got cast aside
Lost inside this mind of mine 
A misadventure a battering tide, 
A place so perfect a place alone, a place sublime my inner zone

Imagery tick tocks explosion of enlightenment in this place of mine
Frozen in motion are my words, but hectic are the pictures rolling in reverse
Loose my words as I have it all to describe, so now I have
Something to say, but it’s lost on you all and just fades away

Have no home in a million places, same ignored truths by changing faces
On borrowed time living with missing faces, I make a change in my pace
I lay and close my eyes, 
No words in mouth, as I have it all to describe

For no reason I lost the feel of seasons 
So a front is erected for the purpose of deceiving but, 
Behind this curtain I’m really hurting, as deep down
I’m a real person, just beaten and broken into mental conversion

So I’ll remain lost inside this paradise of mine
A place so far a place so near, a place of heart and no fear
So forever and always ill reside, away from all the orthodox lies
And remain in this palatial paradise of mine. 

A house is not a home
or where life begins to stir
or where you live
or where you make a living
or where the heart is
or where you hang your hat
or dying is going home.
home does not exist, men only dream of it, 
holding such mind made states as
peace, happiness and bliss
or such much sought ideal
as union of taste, choice and understanding
or home is man himself and how he lives

Gone now the baby's nurse,
a lioness who ruled the roost
and made the Mother cry.
She used to tie
gobbets of porkrind in bowknots of gauze- 
three months they hung like soggy toast
on our eight foot magnolia tree,
and helped the English sparrows
weather a Boston winter.

Three months, three months! 
Is Richard now himself again? 
Dimpled with exaltation,
my daughter holds her levee in the tub.
Our noses rub,
each of us pats a stringy lock of hair- 
they tell me nothing's gone.
Though I am forty-one,
not forty now, the time I put away
was child's play. After thirteen weeks
my child still dabs her cheeks
to start me shaving. When
we dress her in her sky-blue corduroy,
she changes to a boy,
and floats my shaving brush
and washcloth in the flush
Dearest I cannot loiter here
in lather like a polar bear.

Recuperating, I neither spin nor toil.
Three stories down below,
a choreman tends our coffin's length of soil,
and seven horizontal tulips blow.
Just twelve months ago,
these flowers were pedigreed
imported Dutchmen; now no one need
distinguish them from weed.
Bushed by the late spring snow,
they cannot meet
another year's snowballing enervation.

I keep no rank nor station.
Cured, I am frizzled, stale and small. 

Have no space and no worth.
Shorn of grace, torn off mirth.

Lost we hands, left and right.
Yearn we just a ray of light.

Left we back, home and hearth.
Outstretched hands, girdle earth.

Whence to go in larger interest? 
Home; how come, has been infest? 

Hearts and minds reduced to crust.
We’ll be settled as booted dust.

Left behind, few things we stashed.
Brutally our life and soul rehashed.

At times termed, displaced ones.
Painfully suffer the nomadic puns.

Pastures once that sprouted charms.
Scarred and pitted now cordite harms.

Goats the cows and our yeasts.
Horses we rode and burden beasts.

Ruined and caved in idle wells. 
Ghostly ruined our blooming dells.

Swirling squalls; banshee screams.
Scatter to dust our nascent dreams.

Have no place to pitch or rest.
Our sanity’s now been put to test.

Where the water? Where the corns? 
Where the pots? My golden morns? 

Strewn shards devoid of scope.
Niente nicene and ruined hope.

(Friday, June Just Home and Love! the words are small
Four little letters unto each;
And yet you will not find in all
The wide and gracious range of speech
Two more so tenderly complete:
When angels talk in Heaven above,
I'm sure they have no words more sweet
          Than Home and Love.

Just Home and Love! it's hard to guess
Which of the two were best to gain;
Home without Love is bitterness;
Love without Home is often pain.
No! each alone will seldom do;
Somehow they travel hand and glove:
If you win one you must have two,
          Both Home and Love.

And if you've both, well then I'm sure
You ought to sing the whole day long;
It doesn't matter if you're poor
With these to make divine your song.
And so I praisefully repeat,
When angels talk in Heaven above,
There are no words more simply sweet
          Than Home and Love. 

Heaven of my enjoyment is -HOME, 
Why to move aimlessly? Why to roam? 
Life of vulgarity ends, if ye -LOVE, 
Love and home- makes a nest of -DOVE 



any more.

People still have tea and scones! 


Home baking and scones 
are memories remembered. 

from the earliest childhood years.  

when family was primary
and the housewife's role, was esteemed honoured. 


Before she saw him. She was starting down,
Looking back over her shoulder at some fear.
She took a doubtful step and then undid it
To raise herself and look again. He spoke
Advancing toward her: "What is it you see
From up there always? -- for I want to know

"
She turned and sank upon her skirts at that,
And her face changed from terrified to dull.
He said to gain time: "What is it you see?"
Mounting until she cowered under him.
"I will find out now -- you must tell me, dear

"
She, in her place, refused him any help,
With the least stiffening of her neck and silence.
She let him look, sure that he wouldn't see,
Blind creature; and a while he didn't see.
But at last he murmured, "Oh" and again, "Oh


"What is it -- what?" she said.

				"Just that I see


"You don't," she challenged. "Tell me what it is


"The wonder is I didn't see at once.
I never noticed it from here before.
I must be wonted to it -- that's the reason.
The little graveyard where my people are!
So small the window frames the whole of it.
Not so much larger than a bedroom, is it?
There are three stones of slate and one of marble,
Broad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight
On the sidehill. We haven't to mind those.
But I understand: it is not the stones,
But the child's mound ----"

			"Don't, don't, don't,
	don't," she cried.

She withdrew, shrinking from beneath his arm
That rested on the banister, and slid downstairs;
And turned on him with such a daunting look,
He said twice over before he knew himself:
"Can't a man speak of his own child he's lost?"

"Not you! -- Oh, where's my hat? Oh, I don't need it!
I must get out of here. I must get air.--
I don't know rightly whether any man can


"Amy! Don't go to someone else this time.
Listen to me. I won't come down the stairs

"
He sat and fixed his chin between his fists.
"There's something I should like to ask you, dear


"You don't know how to ask it

"
				"Help me, then


Her fingers moved the latch for all reply.

"My words are nearly always an offense.
I don't know how to speak of anything
So as to please you. But I might be taught,
I should suppose. I can't say I see how.
A man must partly give up being a man
With womenfolk. We could have some arrangement
By which I'd bind myself to keep hands off
Anything special you're a-mind to name.
Though I don't like such things 'twixt those that love.
Two that don't love can't live together without them.
But two that do can't live together with them

"
She moved the latch a little. "Don't -- don't go.
Don't carry it to someone else this time.
Tell me about it if it's something human.
Let me into your grief. I'm not so much
Unlike other folks as your standing there
Apart would make me out. Give me my chance.
I do think, though, you overdo it a little.
What was it brought you up to think it the thing
To take your mother-loss of a first child
So inconsolably -- in the face of love.
You'd think his memory might be satisfied ----"

"There you go sneering now!"

			     "I'm not, I'm not!
You make me angry. I'll come down to you.
A man can't speak of his own child that's dead


"You can't because you don't know how to speak.
If you had any feelings, you that dug
With your own hand -- how could you? -- his little grave;
I saw you from that very window there,
Making the gravel leap and leap in air,
Leap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly
And roll back down the mound beside the hole.
I thought, Who is that man? I didn't know you.
And I crept down the stairs and up the stairs
To look again, and still your spade kept lifting.
Then you came in. I heard your rumbling voice
Out in the kitchen, and I don't know why,
But I went near to see with my own eyes.
You could sit there with the stains on your shoes
Of the fresh earth from your own baby's grave
And talk about your everyday concerns.
You had stood the spade up against the wall
Outside there in the entry, for I saw it


"I shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed.


"I can repeat the very words you were saying:
'Three foggy mornings and one rainy day
Will rot the best birch fence a man can build.'
Think of it, talk like that at such a time!
What had how long it takes a birch to rot
To do with what was in the darkened parlour?
You couldn't care! The nearest friends can go
With anyone to death, comes so far short
They might as well not try to go at all.
No, from the time when one is sick to death,
One is alone, and he dies more alone.
Friends make pretense of following to the grave,
But before one is in it, their minds are turned
And making the best of their way back to life
And living people, and things they understand.
But the world's evil. I won't have grief so
If I can change it. Oh, I won't, I won't!"

"There, you have said it all and you feel better.
You won't go now. You're crying. Close the door.
The heart's gone out of it: why keep it up?
Amyl There's someone coming down the road!"

"You -- oh, you think the talk is all. I must go --
Somewhere out of this house. How can I make you ----"

"If -- you -- do!" She was opening the door wider.
"Where do you mean to go? First tell me that.
I'll follow and bring you back by force. I will! --"Leaving in the dark
In an accidental day
From the dawn 
To the following day
Celebrated winter wedding

Putting on by
Official white dress of
Soft cozy woolen snow
Enjoyed the day having
Made a velvet carpet with fallen snow

Closed windows opened
Opened windows closed
To see the snow bride 
Of celebration had

Melting the joy in the eve
Saying good bye
Left winter bride
Returned home  

To live with a long time
Fresh and beauty of own


When you left, I felt dark inside, 
Now when you will come back, there will be light.

My heart sputters faster on this anticipation, 
My love songs are echoing farther in the air, 
There is aura of romance everywhere, 
I have been waiting to see you forever.

When you left, short distances seem long, 
Now even the long distances seem too short, 
The farewell goodbye deserted my soul, 
The arrival hello will brighten my heart.

In separation, the conversations never ended, 
After one interlude, we impatiently waited for the next, 
When you arrive, after greetings, no need to utter a single word, 
Just your smile and happy tears will bind us together in this world.

After a long separation, an emotional hug will bring two continents in our laps, 
With two bodies together and hearts beating in unison, 
Our world will be one, our dreams will be the same, 
We will be one, and our thoughts will be the same. 

The gathering family
throws shadows around us,
it is the late afternoon
Of the family.

There is still enough light
to see all the way back,
but at the windows
that light is wasting away.

Soon we will be nothing
but silhouettes: the sons'
as harsh
as the fathers'.

Soon the daughters
will take off their aprons
as trees take off their leaves
for winter.

Let us eat quickly--
let us fill ourselves up.
the covers of the album are closing
behind us.~   Home Is

In all the lands I've traveled, 
The places I have been, 
Each man thinks his own land
Is the best he's ever seen. 

For the man born in the desert
Knows every grain of sand, 
And acquaintance is the bond that ties
One's heart to familiar land.

Or the man born to the mountain
Has climbed each rocky path; 
No place on earth is dearer
Though velvet be its grass. 

And the storms that rage a rocky coast
Are music to the ears
Of one who's known their lonely cry
All through his youthful years.

I've known the joys of many lands, 
No patriotism for me; 
And He sees not human boundary.

Although my heart may sympathize
With each man's claim I meet, 
Within my heart I realize 
A lilt to my pilgrim feet.

For every man needs a place on earth
To call his very own, 
And every person of whatever birth
Rejoices on the way back home. 

long ago
i was unwanted
grandpa
never praised me
though i worked
hard
even for 
one word, perhaps

love or
even a pat on my shoulder
which i never
really had

papa i remember
bought me 
a toy chopper
but that was just
once

he was not drunk
when he played with me
in the garden

when you feel unwanted
you do not 
have friends
you have nothing good to say

it was early
for me to learn that
dying can be good

i never speak to anyone
about it


i only speak to myself
because i have
no choice

i love isolation
it becomes a way of life

never had a best friend
never had a circle of
friends

as a matter of consequence
i become too independent
complete in myself
and had always been 
a survivor

despair is an everyday word
so i was no longer
afraid.

today people want me
call me by my name
and praise me, but


it is too late then
i do not need it anymore

when grandpa died all those near me
cried and mourned for days

i keep my usual distance
wear my tinted sunglasses
and walk myself
all alone back home

home is myself
my heart. 

Home is not a bulding made of
Cement and mortar
Wood and steel
Bricks and stones
Marble and granites
Tubes and chandeliers! 
Though of course essential! 
Roses and jasmines
Plants and trees
Do add beauty but makes not
An ideal home! 
Essential of course but
Not sufficient to make
An ideal home! 

Human body is not something made of
Bones and joints
Blood and flesh
Eyes and ears
Hair and teeth
Hands and legs
Nails and fingers! 
Essential of course but
Not sufficient to make
An ideal human! 

Home and humans 
Sacred and holy! 
Need to be kept
Neat and tidy
Cool and warm
Clear and clean
Strong and serene
With people
Young or old
Rich or poor
Sick or healthy
Men or women
Learned or otherwise! 
All should have
Mind sans fear
Heart sans bias and hatred
Mind sans malaise and prejudice! 



Every one should be
With love and affection
Respect and regards
Towards all
Known and unknown
Good and bad
Strong and week
Timid and meek! 

Every one should be
Blessed with 
Heart with compassion
Mind with nobility
Face with smiles
Ears to hear all good words
Tongue to speak the truth and sweet
Eyes to see all the good on earth
Hands to help and legs to lead! 

Home becomes a heaven
Elders not put in old age home! 
May all the homes on earth 
Be the homes I wish

We are a circle 
where we roam
near or far
it is our home
we are home
Any place
we come to be
just remember
you're with me
where ever we are 
we are home 
(where ever we are 
we are home)    
There are times 
you look so lost
stand with me 
and be a part
of the home 
in my heart
our home is 
of the hearta broken heart
is always a stranger

looking for 
a cure

on an unknown
terrain

it finds a river &
swims there

feeling cold it rises
naked from the water

dresses himself 
to be born again

he finds a home

it is where his healed heart 
is.

'Tis sweet to him, who all the week
Through city-crowds must push his way,
To stroll alone through fields and woods,
And hallow thus the Sabbath-day.

And sweet it is, in summer bower,
Sincere, affectionate and gay,
One's own dear children feasting round,
To celebrate one's marriage-day.

But what is all, to his delight,
Who having long been dommed to roam,
Throws off the bundle from his back,
Before the door of his own home?

Home-sickness is a wasting pang;
This feel I hourly more and more:
There's healing only in thy wings,
Thou Breeze that play'st on Albion's shore

sunday on a home sweet home
from the city
to this little nipa hut
on top of a hill
that father built

where the guava trees are filled
with ripe fruits
where i climb and gather and taste
the sweetness of its pink flesh

where the carabaos rest
in the coolness of mudholes
where i take my ride on them
in the river nearby

on crystal clear waters
where some fish swim on shallow waters
inviting me to fish and catch them
for lunch of pearl white glutenous rice

and with banana leaves as plates
and some wild chicken's barbecued breast
and with my bare hands and 
some childhood friends
we shall take this simple feast


Sharers of a common country, 
They had met in deadly strife; 
Men who should have been as brothers 
Madly sought each other's life. 

In the silence of the even, 
When the cannon's lips were dumb, 
Thoughts of home and all its loved ones 
To the soldier's heart would come. 

On the margin of a river, 
'Mid the evening's dews and damps, 
Could be heard the sounds of music 
Rising from two hostile camps. 

One was singing of its section 
Down in Dixie, Dixie's land, 
And the other of the banner 
Waved so long from strand to strand. 

In the land where Dixie's ensign 
Floated o'er the hopeful slave, 
Rose the song that freedom's banner, 
Starry-lighted, long might wave. 

From the fields of strife and carnage, 
Gentle thoughts began to roam, 
And a tender strain of music 
Rose with words of "Home, Sweet Home
 


Then the hearts of strong men melted, 
For amid our grief and sin 
Still remains that "touch of nature," 
Telling us we all are kin. 

In one grand but gentle chorus, 
Floating to the starry dome, 
Came the words that brought them nearer, 
Words that told of "Home, Sweet Home
 


For awhile, all strife forgotten, 
They were only brothers then, 
Joining in the sweet old chorus, 
Not as soldiers, but as men. 

Men whose hearts would flow together, 
Though apart their feet might roam, 
Found a tie they could not sever, 
In the mem'ry of each home. 

Never may the steps of carnage 
Shake our land from shore to shore, 
But may mother, home and Heaven, 
Be our watchwords evermore. 

A sea of defunct toys 
Canvas of walls smeared
with colors of joy; 
patterns of art; 
Designs, that god only can understand

Love filled books, can't confine 
themselves to shelves, pop
out every now and then, 
Rest on pillow.

Clothes say - hey, in that 
ugly closet who wants to stay! 
slippers not far behind 
stay on standby all the time
little princess may need them 
anytime. 

Love finds itself 
sprinkled everywhere 
in wet hands on the wall, 
in larger than life footprints
on invisible floor.
chocolate stained sofa too
smiles at you.

The pen runs out of ink 
every time you need it.
Blank pages of my diary 
are history too

Coins from my wallet, attached
by the piggy bank, that has
mortgaged the doll's house.
Happily the barbie pays back
Installment by installment 
Love, that has gone into
making her home up. 

Out in the balcony 
arm chairs sit alone through
the day, waiting for the next 
morning tea; when the lazy love
shall float around them, amidst the
rain sprinkles.

sweet nothings 
formless; 
yet form foundations. 

Home they brought her warrior dead: 
 She nor swooned, nor uttered cry: 
All her maidens, watching, said, 
 ‘She must weep or she will die.’ 

Then they praised him, soft and low, 
 Called him worthy to be loved, 
Truest friend and noblest foe; 
 Yet she neither spoke nor moved. 

Stole a maiden from her place, 
 Lightly to the warrior stepped, 
Took the face-cloth from the face; 
 Yet she neither moved nor wept. 

Rose a nurse of ninety years, 
 Set his child upon her knee— 
Like summer tempest came her tears— 
 ‘Sweet my child, I live for thee.’Oh something just now must be happening there! 
That suddenly and quiveringly here, 
Amid the city's noises, I must think 
Of mangoes leaning o'er the river's brink, 
And dexterous Davie climbing high above, 
The gold fruits ebon-speckled to remove, 
And toss them quickly in the tangled mass 
Of wis-wis twisted round the guinea grass; 
And Cyril coming through the bramble-track 
A prize bunch of bananas on his back; 
And Georgie--none could ever dive like him-- 
Throwing his scanty clothes off for a swim; 
And schoolboys, from Bridge-tunnel going home, 
Watching the waters downward dash and foam. 
This is no daytime dream, there's something in it, 
Oh something's happening there this very minute

Oh, to be in England
Now that April's there,
And whoever wakes in England
Sees, some morning, unaware,
That the lowest boughs and the brushwood sheaf
Round the elm-tree bole are in tiny leaf,
While the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough
In England—now!

And after April, when May follows,
And the whitethroat builds, and all the swallows!
Hark, where my blossomed pear-tree in the hedge
Leans to the field and scatters on the clover
Blossoms and dewdrops—at the bent spray's edge— 
That's the wise thrush; he sings each song twice over,
Lest you should think he never could recapture
The first fine careless rapture!
And though the fields look rough with hoary dew,
All will be gay when noontide wakes anew
The buttercups, the little children's dower
—Far brighter than this gaudy melon-flower

Nobly, nobly Cape Saint Vincent to the North-west died away;
Sunset ran, one glorious blood-red, reeking into Cadiz Bay;
Bluish 'mid the burning water, full in face Trafalgar lay;
In the dimmest North-east distance dawned Gibraltar grand and grey;
"Here and here did England help me: how can I help England?" -say,
While Jove's planet rises yonder, silent over Africa. 

Varus drags me into his affairs
out of the Forum, where I’m seen idling:
to a little whore I immediately saw,
not very inelegant, not unattractive,
who, when we came there, met us
with varied chatter, including, how might
Bithynia stand now, what’s it like, and where
might the benefit have been to me in cash.
I told her what’s true, nothing at all,
while neither the praetors nor their aides, 
return any the richer, especially since
our Praetor, Memmius, the bugger, 
cared not a jot for his followers.
‘But surely,’ they said, you could have bought
slaves they say are made for the litter there.’
I, so the girl might take me to be wealthy,
said ‘no, for me things weren’t so bad,
that coming across one bad province,
I couldn’t buy eight good men.’
But I’d no one, neither here nor there,
who might even raise to his shoulder
the shattered foot of an old couch.
At this she, like the shameless thing she was, said
‘I beg you, my dear Catullus, for the loan of them,
just for a while: I’d like to be carried 
to Serap’s temple.’ ‘Wait’ I said to the girl,
‘what I just said was mine, isn’t actually in
my possession: my friend Cinna, that’s Gaius,
purchased the thing for himself.
Whether they’re his or mine, what difference to me?
I use them just as well as if I’d bought them myself.
But you are quite tasteless, and annoying,
you with whom no inexactness is allowed.’before he left the U. 

S.
HE took pictures of himself sleeping
no one believes that it was him who took that picture
someone theorizes
someone was beside him
another lonely body to another lonely body on that winter time

but it is really true
he will always be alone
and will always be alone 
he repeats it so many times that it has become the sound of the 
monotonous loneliness that he is finally leaving

he took the pictures of his breakfast
some greens
his lunch something oily
and his supper 
something like cheesy pasta

he took every detail of that lonely room
then he viewed them again
when he was on that hour flight back home
before the plane landed in Manila
he deleted everything


Homebrewed like Black Coffee's album
Soothing music to the brewed youth
From first grade they have been listening
To the sound of a true lyricist
From first grade they have been singing
The song that saves troubled souls.

Homebrewed like Black Coffee's album
The verses must rock young South Africans
We don't want violence to rock the country
Must learn to sing from their backbones
The song that saves troubled souls

The homebrewed know where to turn to
When things get messy and ugly
From first grade they must be homebrewed
The homebrewed know where to turn to
When things get messy and ugly
They don't turn to slaughtering their dreams
But to the song that saves troubled souls.

             'Our Father in heaven
          Hallowed be Your name. ..'

                       Amen.


***The Book of End of Times


What was is
since 
the boys in my old gang
are senior partners. They start up
bald like baby birds
to embrace retirement.

At the altar of surrender,
I met you
in the hour of credulity.
How your misfortune came out clearly
to us at twenty.

At the gingerbread casino,
how innocent the nights we made it
on our Vesuvio martinis
with no vermouth but vodka
to sweeten the dry gin--

the lash across my face
that night we adored . . .
soon every night and all,
when your sweet, amorous 
repetition changed. 

People speak of homeland as the countries that bore their ancestors
They speak of pride, tradition, and origins of predecessors
I have no interest in where I came from, or a family history
The past should stay the past: an unsolved mystery
I look to the future, and what the morrow may bring
A new rising sun, a new day dawns, the new morning
For what is today but yesterday's tomorrow? 
Dwelling on the past brings about nothing but sorrow
But by no means should the past be forgot
By learning from past wrongs true wisdom is saught
But my homeland will always be the land in which I reside
Where I will spend my days, live my life, and always confide

from bridge to alley, 
   maybe a tent.

 a little something to eat
 that nobody else wanted.

The sky was overcast in greys
Its hue had got into her eyes
As she sat smoking some cheap cigar
In her motorized wheelchair
In front of the Presbyterian church
Her legs that had never ever perched
Hanging limp like scarecrow snakes

A homeless old invalid
Of the mightiest state
On the globe - the United States

Maples had turned purple
Birches golden yellow
In the church courtyard
With change of seasons
Yet, her eyes were smoky
A desolation ancient and dusky

Nature has no discipline
She should have seen
The anguish in the grey eyes
And paused for a while
Before smiling in glee

It was five in the evening
The cold was biting
Free dinner at the church
Was still two hours from thence
She complained, she should have patience
Till then, if she wished
To sleep on a half-filled stomach at least
Without disturbance

A visitor to the United States
I could only mouth some pleasantries
Say adieu and leave in a hurry

The grey eyes in despair remained
Fixed on a hapless sky
Which then decided to rain
Tear-drops in empathy down
On a homeless evening
That had no statehood
But a universal ache
Global and galactic

A distressed psyche wailed
Somewhere there with a dying bird
Was it a skylark, nightingale, who cares
In a world that has long gone destitute

from Parting/Departing (I walked to Mc


Donalds to get a cone; 
I was by myself.  Yes, it’s true.  I was alone.
As I walked through a side parking lot 
.
I heard a guy yelling, and he was HOT! 

"Hot under the collar" is what I mean.
He was hopping mad, and making a scene.
A Mc


Donalds employee was taking heat 

for not allowing the guy a place to eat? 

"Can’t I even come in and buy some food? ! 
NO! ?  Well I certainly think that is very rude! ! ! ! "
[Ok.  He didn’t use each exact word.
His words weren’t angelic; you should have heard! ]

I spoke a few words with the employee then, 
before going to buy one ice cream, not ten.
The employee said somethin’ about the guy’s B. 

O.
[That’s Body Odor, in case YOU don’t know.]

The upset guy was "homeless", I surmised, 
and perhaps drunk; I’d not be surprised.
The city I was in (I think)  has many of such, 
who many, like "me", would NOT care to touch.

But who’s to say if ‘they" are so bad? 
Many of their life stories may be very sad.
Perhaps mental illness or bad luck would --
turn me into one of "them".  It COULD.

(written October    revised April   when the clouds fade and night awakes
we wait by the muddy stream where the reeds grew
and the graceful crane flew.
away from the congestion of the city
you and I have our place on the mountain's head
in the fresh air of spring.

we see below the cliff, a pale sea of mourning widows
flow throughout the streets, cluttering the synagogues
with broken hopes and heads bowed.
their cries raise Heavenward, like little strands of a song
but are quieted by earth's end.
where will they go tomorrow, what will become of my sisters? 

i don't want to become like one of them, 
homeless birds with no where to turn.
but everyday I see so much of myself in them
and every hour we form an unbreakable bond
by our likenesses; our pasts and doomed futures.
no one will ever love us again.

then i catch your gaze from the corner of my eye, 
analyzing my thought and grim expression.
and to my surprise I hear you say, 
'When I finish the house, I want you as my wife'
i choke with astonished spirit. can it be? 
has Heaven found a home for me

grey faceless buildings, 

wet with morning.

kicking through the trash, 

a rat runs off.

down by the tracks. 
small pine branch fire, 

eyes scour the road; 
coffee, a few boiled potatoes, 
a smoke as the sun goes down

a returning vet
with no place to go! 
oil wars, bombs light the sky, 

dead bodies walk in his dreams. 
disillusioned, disembodied, 
homeless, in America

I just was thought-provokingly, 
I always read more into something than there was.
After two years it becomes more than a job.
It became more than life, life my own.
Tring at low tide 
to harvest the claws, of the mighty stone crab.
By hand with gloves on, while it's, in its hole.
Under the eyes of big brother, as I understand.
Five tickets in six weeks for that same homelessness.
I did what I could and one or the other, 
I had to pick 'n chose with one guess, never two.
So some chose without malice I suppose, 
that I was to long in a car without progress? 
All those psychological bullets, that hit with a solid thud.
still leaves us to guess, at which what? 
This neighbor hood is kinda-well? 
Is it as it should be? 
Without a car 
all those places, are twice as hard, 
to get to than they were before. 

They’re invisible.
You don’t see them.
You don’t want to see them.
They’re everywhere.
They ask you for some change.
That’s all they want.
All they rely on.
Your charity.
But you are still too greedy to bother.
You walk on, letting a soul suffer, without a pang of guilt.
It’s hard to believe that they were once like you and I.
They once had a roof over their heads.
They once had a loving family.
They once had hope.
But now, they are alone and hungry.
Going on with their days.
Waiting for their time to go.
If you dare look deep into their eyes, 
You might see their pain.
You might see that their eyes are blank.
You might see that they are emotionless.
You might see that they are hollow.
And if you really let yourself look close enough.
You will realize that these lost souls are dead before they have really died. 

Thirst is never quenched, 
by distant vision of the water, 
It burns like a desire, 
Consumed, and contracted, 
With blazing of time, 
You may trim the clay of hopes, 
from outcast of ambitions, 
and days to return empty handed and worn., 
making fallen leafs your, 
Only ornament, 
Fate is. a street boy, 
 crying over broken toy, 
Your silence, 
meant for confession, 
unwanted sins, 
dragging weary feet, 
on bend of street, 
Just with homeless and, 
wayward love. 

Homeless man I watched you 
line a deserted doorway, 
your Maytag boxes cardboard monuments 
in Fed Ex labels 
and signs pointing 'This Side Up', 
 
stark reminders of what is, 
and what could be, 

I wondered if I wished hard enough, 
a Fed Ex truck might spirit you away 
on a magic carpet ride 
to where you wouldn't be invisible 
for those who take the time 
to look and really see 

to where someone would offer 
you a job with no Catch  
first telling you to shower 
and have clean clothes, 
and you with no money for either 
without a job. 

I wished. I prayed.

They live in cardboard boxes. 
They live on the lonely street. 
They sleep we're ever they can find, a special place to sleep. 
People think their dirty, people think there mean. 
But what people don't realize is that, it's not so easy living on the street. 
So the next time you happen to pass one, be careful with your words. 
Cause just a kind hello could make the difference in there world. 

There is homelessness 
In ungodliness 
So much mindlessness 
To this kind of indifference 
There is no reference 
To my homelessness 
This restlessness 
To nothingness 
This unholiness 
There is no reference 
There is no address 
To this kind of unwholesomeness 

There is nothing found 
Only something lost. 

back about years ago, 
living on the streets in Charlotte. 
finally found a job.  was lucky enough
to have a place to take a shower. 

sleeping in the backseat of a broke
down Ford Maverick.  cold winter. 
got up and walked miles to work
every morning,miles 'home' in the
evening. 

went on for a couple months before 
i got a place to live.  

so yes i know what homelessness
feels like.  

and i cant help thinking
about all the empty foreclosed houses
empty houses, homeless people

back then, even if you couldnt find a
real job, they had a place where you
could go and line up to do day work. 
worked all day for about dollars. 
if you couldnt do that, you could always
sell blood. .  i dont know what they do
now. . 

i just know it's a hard life.  

and if
you've got family, got kids.  

something to think about the next time 
you see a homeless person walking the
streets

only when they come. 
deputies with papers to evict.
and neighbors stand on their porches, 
and gawk.  as you carry boxes and bags, 
and everything you own, 
and pile them into your car.
you slowly pull from the drive, 
with tears in your eyes, 
and anger stuck in your throat. 
with no hope and no direction, 
and nowhere to go. 
only then, do you know, 
that homelessness is

Ye wild-eyed Muses, sing the Twins of Jove,
Whom the fair-ankled Leda, mixed in love
With mighty Saturn’s Heaven-obscuring Child,
On Taygetus, that lofty mountain wild,
Brought forth in joy: mild Pollux, void of blame, 
And steed-subduing Castor, heirs of fame.
These are the Powers who earth-born mortals save
And ships, whose flight is swift along the wave.
When wintry tempests o’er the savage sea
Are raging, and the sailors tremblingly 
Call on the Twins of Jove with prayer and vow,
Gathered in fear upon the lofty prow,
And sacrifice with snow-white lambs,--the wind
And the huge billow bursting close behind,
Even then beneath the weltering waters bear 
The staggering ship--they suddenly appear,
On yellow wings rushing athwart the sky,
And lull the blasts in mute tranquillity,
And strew the waves on the white Ocean’s bed,
Fair omen of the voyage; from toil and dread 
The sailors rest, rejoicing in the sight,
And plough the quiet sea in safe delight. 

I sing the glorious Power with azure eyes,
Athenian Pallas! tameless, chaste, and wise,
Tritogenia, town-preserving Maid,
Revered and mighty; from his awful head
Whom Jove brought forth, in warlike armour dressed, 
Golden, all radiant! wonder strange possessed
Shaking a javelin keen, impetuously
Rush from the crest of Aegis-bearing Jove;
Fearfully Heaven was shaken, and did move 
Beneath the might of the Cerulean-eyed;
Earth dreadfully resounded, far and wide;
And, lifted from its depths, the sea swelled high
In purple billows, the tide suddenly
Stood still, and great Hyperion’s son long time 
Checked his swift steeds, till, where she stood sublime,
Pallas from her immortal shoulders threw
The arms divine; wise Jove rejoiced to view.
Child of the Aegis-bearer, hail to thee,
Nor thine nor others’ praise shall unremembered be. 

O universal Mother, who dost keep
From everlasting thy foundations deep,
Eldest of things, Great Earth, I sing of thee!
All shapes that have their dwelling in the sea,
All things that fly, or on the ground divine 
Live, move, and there are nourished—these are thine;
These from thy wealth thou dost sustain; from thee
Fair babes are born, and fruits on every tree
Hang ripe and large, revered Divinity!

The life of mortal men beneath thy sway 
Is held; thy power both gives and takes away!
Happy are they whom thy mild favours nourish;
All things unstinted round them grow and flourish.
For them, endures the life-sustaining field
Its load of harvest, and their cattle yield 
Large increase, and their house with wealth is filled.
Such honoured dwell in cities fair and free,
The homes of lovely women, prosperously;
Their sons exult in youth’s new budding gladness,
And their fresh daughters free from care or sadness, 
With bloom-inwoven dance and happy song,
On the soft flowers the meadow-grass among,
Leap round them sporting--such delights by thee
Are given, rich Power, revered Divinity.

Mother of gods, thou Wife of starry Heaven,
Farewell! be thou propitious, and be given
A happy life for this brief melody,
Nor thou nor other songs shall unremembered be. 

Offspring of Jove, Calliope, once more
To the bright Sun, thy hymn of music pour;
Whom to the child of star-clad Heaven and Earth
Euryphaessa, large-eyed nymph, brought forth;
Euryphaessa, the famed sister fair 
Of great Hyperion, who to him did bear
A race of loveliest children; the young Morn,
Whose arms are like twin roses newly born,
The fair-haired Moon, and the immortal Sun,
Who borne by heavenly steeds his race doth run 
Unconquerably, illuming the abodes

Fiercely look forth his awe-inspiring eyes,
Beneath his golden helmet, whence arise
And are shot forth afar, clear beams of light; 
His countenance, with radiant glory bright,
Beneath his graceful locks far shines around,
And the light vest with which his limbs are bound,
Of woof aethereal delicately twined,
Glows in the stream of the uplifting wind. 
His rapid steeds soon bear him to the West;
Where their steep flight his hands divine arrest,
And the fleet car with yoke of gold, which he
Sends from bright Heaven beneath the shadowy sea. 

Muse, sing the deeds of golden Aphrodite,
Who wakens with her smile the lulled delight
Of sweet desire, taming the eternal kings
Of Heaven, and men, and all the living things
That fleet along the air, or whom the sea, 
Or earth, with her maternal ministry,
Nourish innumerable, thy delight
All seek
O crowned Aphrodite!
Three spirits canst thou not deceive or quell:--
Minerva, child of Jove, who loves too well 
Fierce war and mingling combat, and the fame
Of glorious deeds, to heed thy gentle flame.
Diana
Is tamed not by thy smiles; the shadows green
Of the wild woods, the bow, the. 
And piercing cries amid the swift pursuit
Of beasts among waste mountains,--such delight
Is hers, and men who know and do the right.
Nor Saturn’s first-born daughter, Vesta chaste,
Whom Neptune and Apollo wooed the last,
Such was the will of aegis-bearing Jove;
But sternly she refused the ills of Love,
And by her mighty Father’s head she swore
An oath not unperformed, that evermore
A virgin she would live mid deities 
Divine: her father, for such gentle ties
Renounced, gave glorious gifts--thus in his hall
She sits and feeds luxuriously. O’er all
In every fane, her honours first arise
From men--the eldest of Divinities. 

These spirits she persuades not, nor deceives,
But none beside escape, so well she weaves
Her unseen toils; nor mortal men, nor gods
Who live secure in their unseen abodes.
She won the soul of him whose fierce delight 
Is thunder--first in glory and in might.
And, as she willed, his mighty mind deceiving,
With mortal limbs his deathless limbs inweaving,
Concealed him from his spouse and sister fair,
Whom to wise Saturn ancient Rhea bare.
but in return,
In Venus Jove did soft desire awaken,
That by her own enchantments overtaken,
She might, no more from human union free,
Burn for a nursling of mortality.
For once amid the assembled Deities,
The laughter-loving Venus from her eyes

Shot forth the light of a soft starlight smile,
And boasting said, that she, secure the while,
The mortal tenants of earth’s dark abodes,
And mortal offspring from a deathless stem
She could produce in scorn and spite of them.
Therefore he poured desire into her breast
Of young Anchises,
Feeding his herds among the mossy fountains
Of the wide Ida’s many-folded mountains,--
Whom Venus saw, and loved, and the love clung
Like wasting fire her senses wild among. 

Most of the time he worked, a sort of sleep
with a purpose, so far as I could tell.
How he got from the dark of sleep
to the dark of waking up I'll never know; 
the lax sprawl sleep allowed him
began to set from the edges in,
like a custard, and then he was awake,
me too, of course, wriggling my ears
while he unlocked his bladder and stream
of dopey wake-up jokes. The one
about the wine-dark pee I hated instantly.
I stood at the ready, like a god
in an epic, but there was never much
to do. Oh now and then I'd make a sure
intervention, save a life, whatever.
But my exploits don't interest you
and of his life all I can say is that
when he'd poured out his work
the best of it was gone and then he died.
He was a great man and I loved him.
Not a whimper about his sex life - 
how I detest your prurience - 
but here's a farewell literary tip:
I myself am the model for Penelope.
Don't snicker, you hairless moron,
I know so well what faithful means
there's not even a word for it in Dog,
I just embody it. I think you bipeds
have a catchphrase for it: 'To thine own self
be true,. ' though like a blind man's shadow,
the second half is only there for those who know
it's missing. Merely a dog, I'll tell you
what it is: '.  as if you had a choice.

'Homesick Sorrows


No matter the clouds and smoke walk on the river
Let the autumn wild geese fly at night
Hold wine near the wind, the hot tears shed
Lean on the building to overlook the moon, homesick sorrows arise



Death however has one it's final exception.
Leaving us, it leaves us finaly to go.
With that feeling comes homesickness, no worry.
Do you not know, I do not know, but with us to be.
Only love has been able to withstand all of that. 
Through the place we all of them, long ago. 
We go and come, come and go.
Individuals to who whom is to whom and tommorrow.
When tommorrow a woman lost is man, woman becomes.
Every man can be something and her he becomes.
All of that for the sake of it.
So it is, why it is, when it now came and left those. 


Homesickness, 
Disease common to all, 
The great epidemic, 

Quarantined, 
The body, 
And flew sitting on the bird, 

Unto the home, 
The home of eternity, 
Thus saved -
From the touch of any disease
 






Days without trace
Homesickness becoming homeless in other countries
Daily cuddling and affectionate
Nightly struggled
Day and night tangled

Opened the knot of heart
Homesickness popped
Falling land in wandering
Taking root
Croaks
The tune lingered in the room
Breeding and spreading
The ultimate only lacked
No suspense
No suspense
Tenderly blossoming
And fructifying in cool

Virtual strolled past
Rotating heaven and earth up and down
Hopes were dashed
Cuckoos reminded spring
But could not stop
Showers of homesickness
Vast and boundless

The middle of the night without sleep
Looking at the distant homeland
Homesickness all the more difficult removal
Lonely and melancholy

I was between words and lines
Walking and considering
Years of vicissitudes
Listening to
Annual ring of homeland
Rising above
healthy and strong

Drank a pot of
Seductive vintage
Yubingshao wine
The wisps of homesickness
Elegant curl
Diffusing
The whole heart

Messaged
Return to the north of the flying geese
Passed through
The distant night sky
Affectionately greeting
Tribute

The birds' voice, do you homesickness? 






Wild goose entrusts to the care of homesickness dream
Tears of sorrow with wanderer’s love


Homesickness gradually produces, half a cup of wine, be drunk


After long labouring in the windy ways,
On smooth and shining tides
Swiftly the great ship glides,
Her storms forgot, her weary watches past;
Northward she glides, and through the enchanted haze
Faint on the verge her far hope dawns at last.

The phantom sky-line of a shadowy down,
Whose pale white cliffs below
Through sunny mist aglow,
Like noon-day ghosts of summer moonshine gleam---
Soft as old sorrow, bright as old renown,
There lies the home, of all our mortal dream. 

on homeward flight i sit with 'Ghee'.
an East Bay businessman is he.                                  there's a seat between us, to SFO, 
     for my wife.   

if not to mama's she did go.


     our trip to Thailand is now done.
     we had minor problems. . 

but also fun. 
     my nose bled (twice)    and wife's knee did too, 
     but we saw birds and beasts (wild)    not in zoo.


     a seeming-endless stream of bats
     over us flew like winged-rats.
     a huge water lizard had lost its tail; 
     i hope, at catching fish, it does not fail.


     we had dinner one night with Urai and Karl, 
     but her mom's death our future plans to visit them did snarl.
     he suggested we go see go-go clubs our last night, 
     but we retired early due to early next-day flight.


     my wife bought Chinese bills, while on our trip, 
     which now sit in money belt on my hip.
     hotel toothbrushes i'd give to beggers. .(my treat)   
     but, after first night, beggers i did not meet.

 
 
     Bangkok's fleet of Toyota taxis was sight to see; 
     orange, green, yellow, red, blue, and pink delighted me.
     it would be busy enough with cars, buses, and trucks; 
     then add motorbikes galore, weaving among them like so
     many little ducks. 
 

     we saw unleashed dogs, but none did bark.
     we took photos of Buddhist ruins and of birds, 
     and with a Chinese tourist exchanged some words.


     in Ayutthaya our cute waitress learned a new word, 'cake', 
     but I think from plastic, the icing they did make.
     Pak Chong resort visit was delayed
     by train accident.  

then by our 'rescuers'' charade.

                                                                )    
     we drank lots of bottled water; they say 'don't drink tap'.
     but we brought our own soap to use after pee or crap!          
     accommodations ranged from a rustic park bungalow
          to some other, more expensive, places that put on quite a show.


     i had trouble saying 'thank you' in Thai;     
     my wife struggled with the word 'baht'; i don't know why.
     we ate lots of fruit, meat, eggs, and white rice.
     some more vegetables, though, would have been nice.


     the weather was pretty good, even cool at times.
     my wife treated her skin carefully. . 

to foil 'insect crimes'.
     we saw no go-go girls; Karl said their time they'd sell. 
     but we mused about resort employee, whose sex was hard to tell.


     the battery charger burned due to the wrong voltage.
     we may make more such mistakes in our coming dotage.       
     twice we dried clothes on our wire clothesline.
     we gave Karl and Urai dry snacks, but forgot to give them wine.


    i sent greetings by cards to relatives and all; 
    my wife sent a few cards, and about twenty I did call.
    i used  my wife's laptop once, to check my email;  
    she used it, at times, to confirm our trip's detail. 

 
    the beds were 'hard' but sleep was pretty good.
    my wife got two beds often, to get what sleep she could.
    i called Penn Yan (N. 

Y.)    drugstore one night, to check on
    'sleeping pill's' effect         
    since with our west coast pharmacy i could not connect.


    airline breakfast, just concluded, was a small hotdog.
    the sun's lighting up the cloud banks, like the East Bay fog.
    my stepdaughter will pick my up from SFO like she did years
    ago.
    and again i'll have short head hair, and a beard i did just
    grow.

 
    by now my wife should be at mama's. ., not too late i'd bet, 
    showing her our photo plate that from floating market we did get.
    while in Japan she may look at some house to buy. 
    i guess then to Japan, again, i would someday fly.


    on trip i took some U. 

S. dollars. .., even some in my shoe.
    i gave some U. 

S. coins to cabbie's little girls ( .             it was a true vacation; little exercise i did, 
    and i ate ice cream often. ., like a little kid.


    i think i behaved pretty well;  not perfectly i'm sure.
    it'd be a miracle if, for my wife, at ALL times i'd please her.
    she, that is my dear wife, should back to me soon fly, 
    before the laundry pile here at home does reach up to the sky.

                 (there is more --but we landed)       happy new year! ! ! 
 
 
                                                                     (Dec.Homage to Kenneth Koch


If I were doing my Laundry I'd wash my dirty Iran
I'd throw in my United States, and pour on the Ivory Soap,
scrub up Africa, put all the birds and elephants back in
the jungle,
I'd wash the Amazon river and clean the oily Carib & Gulf of Mexico,
Rub that smog off the North Pole, wipe up all the pipelines in Alaska,
Rub a dub dub for Rocky Flats and Los Alamos, Flush that sparkly
Cesium out of Love Canal
Rinse down the Acid Rain over the Parthenon & Sphinx, Drain the Sludge
out of the Mediterranean basin & make it azure again,
Put some blueing back into the sky over the Rhine, bleach the little
Clouds so snow return white as snow,
Cleanse the Hudson Thames & Neckar, Drain the Suds out of Lake Erie
Then I'd throw big Asia in one giant Load & wash out the blood &
Agent Orange,
Dump the whole mess of Russia and China in the wringer, squeeze out
the tattletail Gray of U. 

S. Central American police state,
& put the planet in the drier & let it sit minutes or an
Aeon till it came out cleanhomework again? 
will this drudgery ever end? 
what do they expect from someone like me
when i don't even know my a, b, c, s.

teachers tell me that i will fail.
and that they see me going to jail.
   that i have no ambition.

i can't afford college tuition! 

but i know that i must learn
otherwise my life will forever turn.
in this life there is no other way
so i must listen to what they say.

i must take away this negativity
just so that the teachers can see
that there is some hope for me.

everyone says that my future is in my hands
if i learn to take a stand.
so my nose i did put to the books
and paying attention is all it took.

my grades have started to soar so high
that my head i can put to the sky.
   now i can finally see, that the
education is the best thing for me.

homework is still a drudgery! 
and i may still complain
but my life will never be the same.

THANK YOU TEACHERS FOR KEEPING ME SANE. 

Sometimes my homework is small
Sometimes my homework is long
But whenever i do my homework
My homework is always wrong

Sometimes I do my homework at a slow pace
Sometimes I do my homework faster than days
But however I do my homework
my homework is still a pain

Sometimes my homework is easy
Sometimes my homework is hard
But whenever i can't do my homework
I feel like a retard


Homework! Oh, Homework!
I hate you! You stink!
I wish I could wash you away in the sink,
if only a bomb
would explode you to bits.
Homework! Oh, homework!
You're giving me fits.

I'd rather take baths
with a man-eating shark,
or wrestle a lion
alone in the dark,
eat spinach and liver,
pet ten porcupines,
than tackle the homework,
my teacher assigns.

Homework! Oh, homework!
you're last on my list,
I simple can't see
why you even exist,
if you just disappeared
it would tickle me pink.
Homework! Oh, homework!
I hate you! You stink

Swift swallows sailing from the Spanish main, 
O rain-birds racing merrily away 
From hill-tops parched with heat and sultry plain 
Of wilting plants and fainting flowers, say-- 

When at the noon-hour from the chapel school 
The children dash and scamper down the dale, 
Scornful of teacher's rod and binding rule 
Forever broken and without avail, 

Do they still stop beneath the giant tree 
To gather locusts in their childish greed, 
And chuckle when they break the pods to see 
The golden powder clustered round the seed

petit et dangereux comme un jaguar et parce qu'une femme soupira
pour lui dans l'obscurite de soixante watts et le pleura Amour Infidele
Amour Hypocrite Oh Amour Insouciant et Aggravant, 


Elle entra en scene en yards de perles, en apparaissant comme

Parce que des lattes gris commencerent a montrer quelque part d'au-dessous
des lithographes dechirees et vielles du ciel au visage d'une poupee;

What man has made unmade beds bend time.
Master, master who am I to say, 
I say master, master to an early grave, 
you laid down the rules for firtle man and women know.

Now these seven billion where to go, 
the worlds no longer home their minds have run away.
How far have you come, 
never some say inside that book of man
some one wrote 
he could not read or right before death.
I know knowledge is not free though free you are. 

I believe most human societies are heterosexual at their core.
Homosexuality is often viewed variously as sinful, abnormal, and more.
To avoid punishment or unpleasantness many homosexuals have "lied".
Now many gays who have hidden or held back will not be denied.

At least in America I believe homosexuality is no longer a crime.
Gay unions and even marriages are gaining recognition over time.
The Boy Scouts* still ban gays, making their organization harder to sell.
But the Pentagon has finally dropped the anti-gay motto "Don't ask.  Don't tell


All of which makes me wonder how different American society would be. .. 
if the majority of citizens were homosexual, not straight like me.
Even the name "straight" might change; maybe I'd be called "skewed".
I might be shunned if it was discovered that women, not men, I screwed.

What if human societies evolved with homosexuality the norm? 
Would religious leaders proclaim heterosexuality an amoral storm? 
Would the "new straights"/homosexuals think of the "skeweds" as sick? 
Would Boy Scouts* only "homo" men and boys choose, . . and no heterosexuals pick? 

I believe heterosexuality may have evolved as, OR has always been, 
the norm, due to "hetero-sex" being needed.  to produce more kin.
Of course babies can NOW be produced without sex being "done".
Many people (present day straights)    would say "that" takes away some fun.

If you believe as I do, you believe "gays" are gay when they come out of their mother.
But their sexual inclinations, a "straight" society does often smother.
I doubt homosexuality will ever be, in America, the norm; 
if it is, I hope, to the "new rules", we can all peacefully conform.

It may seem at first a fine argument.  But I think some more.  

and it seems odd.

In bee societies some members procreate, while others have other jobs.
In some mammal groups only certain males get to service the female mobs.
And what about humans who "find" no mates or are born sterile, as they say?

Dress well, deep filled cuts,

we like to hear, ears know it best 
how you like to scream
Late at night, 
when the oysters of the world are shut tight.  

where do we go from here? 
our lives controlled by mechanical arms, 
that oppress and drive without conscience.
we've been fed for years on a steady diet
of lies, of half truths, of illusions.
and now the walls of the false kingdom
have come tumbling down. 

we have been driven by fear to participate
in their unholy wars.  by misguided images
of patriotism.  by a graven image of what's
right and wring. 

and we're not buying it anymore! 

the American dream has crumbled.  we're
jobless, homeless, desperate, and hungry! 
maybe that's what it took to open our eyes! 

they've taken away our hope of a future. 
and even worse, our children's hopes. now it's
time for us to stand up and take it back

if you give an honest, 
hard working, uneducated man 
access to books and ideas, a 
deep desire to learn, 
and time to honestly evaluate
his own life experiences. 
and then you take away his rights, 
his work, and his dream for his 
family.  
this man will stand up and turn
your world upside down.
never underestimate the power
of the common man and woman

never had the chance
to visit GetHomemane
the thorns of the crown
on my head, never felt, 
did not see the carrying of
the cross, 
that darkest night of the
crucifixion, never been
there

in this middle of my
reflection
couldn't wait to see
Resurrection

i'd give up sorrow, grief, 
lament, in exchange of
joy
it's the redemption that
matters most
our way of moving on
this long yet
unfinished journey


Something in me
wants to go back
and want once more
to hear the sound of
your laughter

i want to imitate
what it really is
i want to show this
place where i come
from
i want to show you
now how disfigured
is my mouth
how this system
has done badly
for all the child in us. 

Honestly hold

Love makes no sound
It can't be heard on ground
It evaporates in air 
Like white clouds, it looks fair 

Why someone else should hear? 
The moment belongs to you dear
It is your pleasure
And coming future 

You create holy world
To live in and need not be told
It is sealed cover
From a precious lover

"Till I come"
Welcome air, and water
Don't allow it to boil
Else it may evaporate to fail our love

Yes I am arriving
For loving
Best woman of world 
To her I shall honestly holdhonestly i too turn
to sand when love is
repeatedly uttered like
a chant to make the dead
become alive again when
there has never been proof
of its resurrection I've
seen people live
faithfully in the house
because there is only one house
not because they are one. 

what name shall i give you, 
i have so many names ready, 

i am paul, but they call me greg, 
(i can be a kenneth, if you like, 
or an apollo, tell me, 
do you like greek games?) 

i told you i have been always
Paul, not the apostle, but the
one that they always like, 
at the gallery of bones, at the
esplanade of hands, more hands, 

the room is clean and perfumed, 
and the light is dimming like a
human drama of lovers and
what they do quickly to themselves, 

you like to see dark nooks 
something that is crowded 
just for two people to feel the
pulse of their wrists
nothing about the heart here
you emphasize it from the start

plain rubbing and then at the 
back of our minds an 
impersonal groan, 

then we leave, without a wink.

honestly, if you ask me, 
i never like it, but i know
soon another one follows.


enough of these tantrums
that i have caused upon myself
that i have shamed upon myself
an honorable man
to the eyes of those who do not know
my cravings
and longings and 

what do i call it? these rampant
rantings of a man 
who may not after all deserve to live
for another day
a devil's quivering chanting
that i may take my life
and let others live
in peace.

drama, enough of this drama.
i admit, it is this unrequited love
for all these years
that keep me living
to the life of la vida loca.

she bangs! 

alright, talk, i will listen
in a minute. 

Her presence did it again
She was my object main
She stood for happiness and my ideal
She only occupied my mind and seemed real

I was in pain and longed
So far I had thought only about her and managed
Now I intensely seek her at each step
But she offers different explanation with solid slap

No, she is reasonable and noble woman 
Always remained my favorite kind human 
She had all her limitations and compulsion
Yet she never lost composure and had illusion 

"Solitude" is my best companion to enjoy
She confided me in her excellent mood of joy
It did cut through my bones and sent shiver 
I could not even smile at her 

I shall only watch her and admire
That is perfect way to feel and watch
The dream shall have to be pushed back 

I shall paint her on my canvass
With same curves and smiling face
She will speak to me when I am before her
She shall have nothing worry about worldly thing sand bother 

I want to lick her happiness
See the same and nice happiness
Why can’t she be same as was before? 
I fail to understand but honestly seek her


All I ask from you is honesty  
Through time and event this will  
help our love grow  Honesty brings forth the special glow  
With honesty you have everything  
we need  
Honesty is like planting a seed  And when it begins to grow  
My love for you will also


He questioned to me, 
Answer this
Five minus four is how much? 
Replied I, one

He laughed and said: -
You can't save for future
At least you should make 
Four or three but not one

While I left him, 
Instructed
I don't like such future boom
They are destined to doom
And I am not a hoon
Myself destined to moon//Honesty doesn't belong to rich
It is not beyond anybody's reach
It is easy to profess and preach
But we always defy rules and breach 

Neither can it be expected from everyone
Not can it be taken for granted from someone
No one knows when someone may stab from the back
It happens many times when something big is at the stake

Today the scenario has been completely changed
Human needs have risen many fold and remains unmanaged
This compels people to go for quick and easy money
They may attempt to reach farthest tree branch for honey

No one wants to work hard for getting fortune
They know very well that they me be thrown out of gear and tune 
If not worked hard and kept always in readiness
You got to go in whole heartedly and chase

One of the American female was on tour
Her dream for sight seeing and beautiful scenes turned sour
She lost her money purse along with passport
As being new and tourist she had nothing to support

She spent day and night restless for urgent need
She was sure nothing may come back due to greed 
But to her fortune the purse was spotted by vegetable vendor
Beautiful lady at heart with noble ideas to live with honor

She was illiterate but soon got the real things behind
Got hold of one hotel bill and started to find
In the hotel room the lady had wept whole night
Had lost all hopes and feared for not going everything right

Vendor woman entered room with whole purse intact
The American woman couldn't believer her eyes in fact
She was in tears and simply could meet with simple lady
Here she was with all precious things and ready 

The tourist lady thanked a lot and offered some money
The vendor lady refused and asked her to pray almighty
Even though she was poor, illiterate and had not more
She would not accept it in return for favor


I consider this gesture as shining example 
For simple greed one could have been put into trouble
The vendor lady showed courage and honesty
I bow my head to her for doing the almost charity

* The name of lady is Kankuben Sakrabhai Pattani


I believe in wisdom. 
I believe in the beauty of a starlit sky. 
I believe in promises kept. 
I believe that America, truly is 
the land of opportunity. 

I do not believe, that most dreams come true. 
I do believe, that dreams can lead one 
to the path, of ones inner desires. 

I believe, that many listen, but do not hear. 
I believe in honesty and integrity. 
I believe, in a mothers love. 
I believe in a fathers pain. 


I wear a genuine smile as a lie's being told
That I assume is the truth, very deeply in my heart
but then there's a doubt that starts.
The man says that he is going through
and needs some help, by means of cash.
I look at him sideways, I don't want to be cross
but I'm not sure what his intentions are.
So I ask out of curiousity what it is he will do
with the money that I put in his hands
and he assures me that it will go to good use, 
not be spent on drugs and frivolous things.
That's when I lighten my heart and pull out the money
so that he can have food for the day, 
And I walk away with a feeling of generousity.
But when I cross paths with him again
I see him with a cigarette lit and he waves my way.
I feel faint and ready to pounce
on the man who I'd given my money away to.
I was happy at first because I thought
I had helped someone today
but my face drops as I realize
I just supported someone's pernicious addiction.
Honesty is nothing but fiction. 

Honesty looses battle
As we lack strong metal
Mind and body quietly differ
One may reject and another may accept offer

Person caught at the gate is thief
So not caught, there is relief
The happiness and joy is for brief
There after follows agony and grief

No one is safe not even country
All resources may be cornered and people may go hungry
How an elephant is killed for ivory? 
Where as it is unwanted and unnecessary! 

Body longs for all luxury style
It may not had for meanwhile
So there is short cut to avail
Many succeed but mostly fail

Yes, we are all in safe hands
No enemy and all friends
Only bleak future and tragic end
Greedy eyes with sick mind

Pray almighty for sage passage
Miss not if there is good message
Write something new on good page
Content with whatever you have and not burn with rage


Flowers,   We-
The faithful wife of poets
The call girls of beetles
The adopted children of gardeners
Sometimes we are used in celebrations
And in the event of homage, given too
Sometimes we commence love affairs
And travel on the bouquet of brides
Sometime as demand dowry in temples
And politicians too
What else..? 
Also
We are 'Honest' to pristine
And so we die
on the same day of our birth


O my darling! you're so romantic and lovely.
Your sweet words fascinate me badly.
You are my holy love, sweeter than honey.
If you are with me I need no money. 

You are a nice rose blooming on my earth.
No rough wind can shake you from my heart. 
Your alluring beauty fills my heart with happiness.
Your sweet smell makes my mind calm and fresh. 

You are an enchanting fairy flying in my sky 
To calm my mind and give me intense joy.
Only I can enjoy your true beauty 
As you are my love; you are my felicity.

When evening falls and darkness surrounds me
Like the full moon you vanish it from my psyche.
You are my sacred love, sweeter than honey.
Without you my life seems to be empty and funny. 

He lay for a day on my table, stillness
Personified. - eyes seemed alive, arms
Curled furily tight,  perhaps as his will
At the end was for warmth. There was no harm
More could be done to this bee. Wings held high
And gossamer fine, his short life was done.
He went as he came, unsung, but his goodbye
Was with dignity. Being himself, come
The end, with work now achieved as worthwhile, 
He did the best thing and finished with style.
A beautiful bee he was. 

The bees accumulate
the nectar from flower
who can say
poison does not exist there
but the bees always accumulate nectar
for which she has to work hard
imagine the patience of bees
but still does not fail
it is the reason for hard toil
honey is always sweet
achievement acquired through hard toil
is always sweet. 

Fake verbal crystal sugar i was fed
before i knew of you; your honey words
like golden liquid fill my head; 
now i am starving for this flavoured blend; 
and being blind - all ears; whole getting sticky, 
i spend much time, gain weight, feel giddy
and anyhow i am becoming happy captive
of you, my clever, honey-mouthed heart-thief. 

If you can’t catch fish
At least you can dig for worms
Or cut some bait
Because just like our dog
We had put down
Our good days are numbered
Like the hairs on our head

honey sweet, 
languorously
dripping from my eyes; 
Honey warm, liquid amber, 
floral nectar, aromas and
perfume of colourful coronas - 
It is relish in essence, 
pure, my sweet love for you; 
silently lingering upon my lips
now.  

devoured in a fervent kiss.

Sip my golden love, honey! 
Sip it slowly. 
till you fill your heart
with my honey-drops for you; 
Absorb my love into your being, dear! 
vitalizing your dormant senses
with all the earthly flowers, scented.

I know, my darling, I know. 
our love is a honey bee; 
it is how will always be - 
buzzing and stinging us 
with both poison and honey; 
The loving bee, 
deflowering our hearts
with its sweetness, 
spreading in us, 
unifying us 
into an eternity
of honeycomb love. 

You can’t remember making it –
that scream she refers to
on page of her memoirs (Memoirs
of a Weapon’s Buff) – executions justified
by a once & future Yes, an obsession
to safari with a difference that manifested
as a death on hold that spoke no volume. Just
a whisper published for a shot at the much flouted
Charity Sufferance with its fifty-seven dolls stuffed
in your rucksack in case you need them. As now,
when the most sensible thing to do would be
to ritually extract them one by one & pass them out
to the seven sumo wrestlers at the next table, bowing
deeply, speaking volumes: Domo arigato. Obviously
what these fatties always wanted, mothers
to a man with babes to rock to sleep. Sweet
dreams, it’s time to enter that swamp
where the most stalwart hero is referenced as
Little Butch: big boys with big smiles for a scrawny
geijin tourist. Enjoy your stay in Tokyo. Or is this
Berlin? Probably the latter judging by the atmosphere
of fight to the death that seems to pervade
every nook & cranny of this pillbox? Why
a pillbox? Surely there’s nothing to guard in the heart
of a Georgia swamp, snakes entwined around the still-
hot barrel of a water-cooled machine gun. Who
have you massacred this time? Just a dozen
or so of those big bullies, teach them to keep
their hands off, always grabbing your ass just
when you’re trying to impress Norma Jean with one
of your samurai warrior impersonations. Fingers
in her pie, will you ever? No chance at all
if you can’t get these boxing gloves off. Hopelessly
knotted laces. And now, how embarrassing, a tray
of succulent sushi arrives at your table, apparently 
ordered by the wrestlers Manipulating chopsticks
with boxing gloves is not your idea of fun, but
they love it – big belly laughs, polite of course. 
                                                                           Arigato
aseholes, may you choke on one another’s pigtails.
And now, inside the fortune cookie that follows 
the sushi, is a message whose relevance
to your situation is uncanny. Take us 
to your leader. Of course they mean your wife. So
off you go, all crowded into one groaning elevator, 
pushed aside when you reach the suite to discover 
(you tried to tell them) that she’s packed her bags 
& left, gone home to mummy & daddy.

Patriarchs they say should each of us be
Compliant,  quiescent, but no, not me! 
Unwilling submission to rhythm and rhyme
Would bury my verse in the sands of time.
When we met I discounted that I’m growing old, 
And much too stubborn to do as I’m told, 
Saying, "Love one another as I have loved you."
Ignoring the venomous, conjugal theme 
Of suspicion that you had joined my harem.
Yet since men will thus view with jaundiced eye, 
The innocent friendship between you and I
And sully your irreproachable name, 
Give me your Goodbye and I’ll bid you the same.


Bulawayo, June e have lost our sense of honor.
honor's not something you win in
battle, not a crown for the victor, 
not something you can build or buy.

honor is a way of life.  and it begins
with respect.

we no longer respect the many forms
of life around us.  hell, we're so busy
just trying to survive that we dont even
see life, much less know it! 

every person, good, bad, or ugly, deserves
our respect.  for they are merely in all their
glory, and in all their human weakness, 
reflections of us.  a part of us! 

every form of life.  dogs, cats, elephants, ants, 
whales, turtles, trees, rivers, mountains. 
deserve our respect.  for they are a part
of us, and we of them. 

so many of us are experiencing financial
failures, hunger, poverty, and distress. 
and we feel like we've lost any sense of honor. 
but a man and a woman's honor is not held
in these things. 

it is held in the naked truth of what we do
next.  whether we remain as self-oriented 
islands, or whether we rejoin the sea and 
the sky of life.  together as one.  only then
will we be an honorable people

I had clear intention 
To remain in his arm with relation 
Neither It was not forced 
Nor by some one imposed

There may be cases of uncertain nature
Where fate of girls are not sure 
They are forced to marry
Much to their annoyance and envy 

Yes, rules are very much defined
As wife, mother or daughter it is dignified
As wife you are bound to discharge 
The responsibility area is large 

No one can say it is cruel attempt
That girl submitted to forceful act
Any gentleman would expect his bride
To stay near and confide

She might be feeling it like cage
Many souls are forced to manage 
Even if to their disliking 
But never in their mind is it striking 

Only intellectual people make storm in tea cup
Generally speaking, we must think and shut up
It gives air of suspicion in minds of woman 
But after all it is need and felt as human 

You need a shelter to carry on
Else life remains inactive and gone 
We find gender discrimination all over
It is wise to find a refuge or cover 
 
No doubt, outside world is lovely 
Once you prefer to remain lonely
But in society you have to adjust
As certain limitations are must

They need honor and respect
As men must think and introspect
When male and female is considered as two wheels
There has to be resolve and strong will


Not a day might have been passed
From your memory to be glanced
Such a happy and long union
With a long time wife as companion

I congratulate it in earnest
As it has remained very best
Coming days must be fruitful
As it has been very much successful

Life as such is beautiful
We have everything in plentiful
Only it should be spent with happiness
All the time it must be seen on the face

Days and years have turned into decades
But memory remains fresh and never fades
You are moved with the happy moments
As life was always challenging with movements 

When you sit on the bench alone
You feel happy and not lone
It is nice to feel about past life
When everything had been quiet from wife

So rejoice at long and comfortable inning
You have scored all the goals as winning
Nothing remains now to be seen as failure
Life was happy at all the times for very much sure


Honor to woman!  To her it is given
To garden the earth with the roses of heaven!
 All blessed, she linketh the loves in their choir
In the veil of the graces her beauty concealing,
She tends on each altar that's hallowed to feeling,
 And keeps ever-living the fire!

From the bounds of truth careering,
 Man's strong spirit wildly sweeps,
With each hasty impulse veering
 Down to passion's troubled deeps.
And his heart, contented never,
 Greeds to grapple with the far,
Chasing his own dream forever,
 On through many a distant star!
But woman with looks that can charm and enchain,
Lureth back at her beck the wild truant again,
 By the spell of her presence beguiled--
In the home of the mother her modest abode,
And modest the manners by Nature bestowed
 On Nature's most exquisite child!

Bruised and worn, but fiercely breasting,
 Foe to foe, the angry strife;
Man, the wild one, never resting,
 Roams along the troubled life;
What he planneth, still pursuing;
 Vainly as the Hydra bleeds,
Crest the severed crest renewing--
 Wish to withered wish succeeds.

But woman at peace with all being, reposes,
And seeks from the moment to gather the roses--
 Whose sweets to her culture belong.
Ah! richer than he, though his soul reigneth o'er
The mighty dominion of genius and lore,
 And the infinite circle of song.

Strong, and proud, and self-depending,
 Man's cold bosom beats alone;
Heart with heart divinely blending,
 In the love that gods have known,
Soul's sweet interchange of feeling,
 Melting tears--he never knows,
Each hard sense the hard one steeling,
 Arms against a world of foes.

Alive, as the wind-harp, how lightly soever
If wooed by the zephyr, to music will quiver,
 Is woman to hope and to fear;
All, tender one! still at the shadow of grieving,
How quiver the chords--how thy bosom is heaving--
 How trembles thy glance through the tear!

Man's dominion, war and labor;
 Might to right the statue gave;
Laws are in the Scythian's sabre;
 Where the Mede reigned--see the slave!
Peace and meekness grimly routing,
 Prowls the war-lust, rude and wild;
Eris rages, hoarsely shouting,
 Where the vanished graces smiled.

But woman, the soft one, persuasively prayeth--
Of the life that she charmeth, the sceptre she swayeth;
 She lulls, as she looks from above,
The discord whose bell for its victims is gaping,
And blending awhile the forever escaping,
 Whispers hate to the image of love

Until you are cemented with bond
You will have no thought as first or second
You won’t know what is called separation
It has no special lamp for indication

Some of the separations are observed by all
Since it is established fact and permanent call
Life and death can’t be separated
One is linked to other and nicely corroborated

No one can separate the soul from body
This can’t be done by anybody
It is divine need and felt necessarily
When that takes place it is accepted happily

Some of the separations are body concerns
It gets sour when spoiled in turn
Where you can’t pull on any more
The separation is wanted therefore

It can be self inflicted or imposed
In both the cases trust is never reposed
The urgency of separations is felt
It is severing of relation and hitting below belt

Sometimes you need isolation from growing discontentment
You need peace and live in secluded place devoid of any comments
It can be detachment or separation from existing world
Where you develop tendency to remain in control and look very cold

If you are inclined to positive thinking 
None of the concern may lead to any type of sinking
You may take it as part of life and reach to conclusion
That this is your fate and must find honorable inclusion


Morning newspaper made me to weep
I felt sadness and failed to keep
That lovely gesture and feeling in the morning
It gave me shock and stern warning

The mother of six children had pathetic tale
Both husband and wife were not well
No one was there to give them helping hand 
They were on the verge of dead end 

Sons were married and lived independently
Daughters moved to another cities and lived happily
Parent were left behind to look after old house
Yet they had no bad feeling or grouse

"Bad luck to us" they were shown weeping
I too felt emotion and stopped short of weeping
The picture of mothers rushed before screen
I saw her smiling at me even 

I dreamed about departed mother
How coolly she kept us together? 
Never allowed any trouble to face us
She was confident with full of trust

We were brought under odd situation
Yet she had no complaint to put on
We were from ordinary family 
Yet thrived happily with blessings from almighty 

How were we upset when she was no more? 
She had left behind good name to adore
We remember her even today

do you get paid for this? because literally every poem I click on on this site ends up being one of your poems, and I don't understand how you would have time to write ALL THESE POEMS, SO MANY POEMS and still have time for something like a job that makes money to pay bills, so you must be getting paid for this. and clearly you get paid by the quantity, not the quality of work


Honorary work 

Not a single buck 
I am never hungry or struck
Money matters less

Yes I have enough of time
I myself think about it sometimes
I have lived my life fully  
Now I want to serve the readers literally

I am retired man from air force 
I am happy with whatever I have as source

As it was never the intention or aim 

I am blessed with insight
I am thankful to almighty with delight 
You should be happy to know
That I am able to write so much with constant flow 

Never mind with little expense 
Entire expenditure is born by me from retirement purse

Or honor me with golden stick

When the column of light on the waters is glassed,
 As blent in one glow seem the shine and the stream;
But wave after wave through the glory has passed,
 Just catches, and flies as it catches, the beam
So honors but mirror on mortals their light;
Not the man but the place that he passes is bright. 

The moon is full this winter night;
The stars are clear, though few;
And every window glistens bright,
With leaves of frozen dew. 

The sweet moon through your lattice gleams
And lights your room like day;
And there you pass, in happy dreams,
The peaceful hours away! 

While I, with effort hardly quelling
The anguish in my breast,
Wander about the silent dwelling,
And cannot think of rest. 

The old clock in the gloomy hall
Ticks on, from hour to hour;
And every time its measured call
Seems lingering slow and slower: 

And oh, how slow that keen-eyed star
Has tracked the chilly grey!
What, watching yet! how very far
The morning lies away! 

Without your chamber door I stand;
Love, are you slumbering still?
My cold heart, underneath my hand,
Has almost ceased to thrill. 

Bleak, bleak the east wind sobs and sighs,
And drowns the turret bell,
Whose sad note, undistinguished, dies
Unheard, like my farewell! 

To-morrow, Scorn will blight my name,
And Hate will trample me,
Will load me with a coward's shame?
A traitor's perjury. 

False friends will launch their covert sneers;
True friends will wish me dead;
And I shall cause the bitterest tears
That you have ever shed. 

The dark deeds of my outlawed race
Will then like virtues shine;
And men will pardon their disgrace,
Beside the guilt of mine. 

For, who forgives the accursed crime
Of dastard treachery?
Rebellion, in its chosen time,
May Freedom's champion be; 

Revenge may stain a righteous sword,
It may be just to slay;
But, traitor, traitor, from that word
All true breasts shrink away! 

Oh, I would give my heart to death,
To keep my honour fair;
Yet, I'll not give my inward faith
My honour's name to spare! 

Not even to keep your priceless love,
Dare I, Beloved, deceive;
This treason should the future prove,
Then, only then, believe! 

I know the path I ought to go;
I follow fearlessly,
Inquiring not what deeper woe
Stern duty stores for me. 

So foes pursue, and cold allies
Mistrust me, every one:
Let me be false in others' eyes,
If faithful in my own. 

A lovely child is
Either a girl or a boy, 
The girl becomes virgin
Then she grows into woman in coy.

She becomes humane mother
She is gifted by Nature, 
She is not only a mother
But also she is creator does nurture.

Women are the embodiments of
Love, peace and care, 
A sweet hearted woman smiles
Always she does fetch dare.

A woman brings up child
And sometimes she dandles, 
Child feels safety in mother’s lap
On her back she or he dangles.

One can’t measure the depth of 
Love and patience of a woman’
Her heart is full of kindness and emotion
For shake off other’s sadness she tolerates pain.

Women sustain the families’ burden
They have mettle, maxim, and mercy, 
They are custodians, rulers and feeders
They are indomitable spirits and know curtsy.

International Women’s Day is celebrated
On eighth March every year, 
Honours and awards are given to them
They are meritorious and dear. 

Some women are great and honourable
And are burning examples in country, 
Mother Theresa is one of them
Let’s offer her tribute in every entry.

Women are our sisters, mothers, rulers
Teachers, doctors and companions, 
We must honour them, serve them
And save from maze and adverse opinions. 

Huff is your foe, leave it
Obligate to your elders ever
Never disobey, they are supreme
Oldies need you as umbrdlla
Under your service they feel fit
Raze your rage, live with books. 

At eighty he is still a coolie
Toiling in paddy lea
Reaping pods and
Heaping the seeds
His sagged muscles working
In wonted harmony
But his brain tired of thought
Of his son who died as a sot; or
Of his daughter widowed at twenty past
Or his wife pulling weeds at another spot
He has to carry on this moil; I thought
Till death to retain his breath

Looking at his pitiable plight
A wicked feeling swept my heart
How great we're in contrast
Honourable servants of the State
We retire at sixty, in peace
Take a lump sum of grant, apiece
Also a pension for monthly use
Last but not the least
A T. 

V and a chair to ease
All this at what a simple price
For sleeping forty years in office! ! 

Filled as I am by this wonderful love
Renewing each day in my heart, 
I am determined, by all that is true
To honour love, right from the start.

You set the standard my trustworthy friend.
Commitment for you is life-long.
Growing in beauty as time passes by
This feeling is naturally strong.

Honoured I am to receive such a gift.
A heart as warm as yours. My love
Devotion for me is as strong as for you, 
It's sworn to the heavens above.

So as we discover our fated life
And give thanks, we will not neglect
I feel sure, to reverance such honour, 
As love like ours demands respect.

Thus we will treasure it well my dear.
Soul-mate love lasts for all time, 
We will  eternally honour and share
Such love, dearest soul-mate of mine. 

Descendence of night with alarming sound, 
Cries all over in streets and round, 
Final calls buzz all around, 
Relatives break their head on ground, 

Somebody lost son and bread winner, 
All curse for guilty and cry inner, 
No blessings for wrong doers and sinner, 
Air too becomes slow and thinner, 

Their cry may lost in wilderness, 
Life from something to nothingness, 
Gloom forecast for days to come, 
How anybody can think and welcome? 

Only two hundred forty people died, 
Many more names may be tied, 
Millions of tear drops and dried, 
Countless families bereaved and cried, 

Only place of nation’s father, 
World learnt a lesson and moved further, 
Mourning death on count of liquor spurious  
No one knows who their mentor is? 

Humanity cries every year, 
No steps and falling on deaf ears, 
Who does bother and takes care? 
No sympathy and consolation thread bare, 

Countless may die still more, 
It happened not today but also this before, 
Shedding tears and offering solace, 
Huts may be burnt but not the palace, 

Rich can afford the luxury of drinks, 
May loose little mind at home and sink, 
Where does poor go and enjoy? 
No one thinks and method employ, 

Mafias, dons and hooch kings strive, 
Extract more which flourish and thrive, 
Some may be put behind bars and round up, 
May be treated as simple incidence and storm in tea cup,At night, toward dawn, all the lights of the shore have died,
And the wind moves. Moves in the dark
The sleeping power of the ocean, no more beastlike than manlike,
Not to be compared; itself and itself.
Its breath blown shoreward huddles the world with a fog; no stars
Dance in heaven; no ship's light glances.
I see the heavy granite bodies of the rocks of the headland,
That were ancient here before Egypt had pyramids,
Bulk on the gray of the sky, and beyond them the jets of young trees
I planted the year of the Versailles peace.
But here is the final unridiculous peace. Before the first man
Here were the stones, the ocean, the cypresses,
And the pallid region in the stone-rough dome of fog where the moon
Falls on the west. Here is reality.
The other is a spectral episode: after the inquisitive animal's
Amusements are quiet: the dark glory. 

I AM a hoodlum, you are a hoodlum, we and all of us are a world of hoodlums-maybe so.
I hate and kill better men than I am, so do you, so do all of us-maybe-maybe so.
In the ends of my fingers the itch for another man's neck, I want to see him hanging, one of dusk's cartoons against the sunset.
This is the hate my father gave me, this was in my mother's milk, this is you and me and all of us in a world of hoodlums-maybe so.
Let us go on, brother hoodlums, let us kill and kill, it has always been so, it will always be so, there is nothing more to it.
Let us go on, sister hoodlums, kill, kill, and kill, the torsoes of the world's mother's are tireless and the loins of the world's fathers are strong-so go on-kill, kill, kill.
Lay them deep in the dirt, the stiffs we fixed, the cadavers bumped off, lay them deep and let the night winds of winter blizzards howl their burial service.
The night winds and the winter, the great white sheets of northern blizzards, who can sing better for the lost hoodlums the old requiem, 'Kill him! kill him!. '
Today my son, to-morrow yours, the day after your next door neighbor's-it is all in the wrists of the gods who shoot craps-it is anybody's guess whose eyes shut next.
Being a hoodlum now, you and I, being all of us a world of hoodlums, let us take up the cry when the mob sluffs by on a thousand shoe soles, let us too yammer, 'Kill him! kill him!. '
Let us do this now
for our mothers
for our sisters and wives
let us kill, kill, kill-for the torsoes of the women are tireless and the loins of the men are strong. 

Chicago, July   

Yeah hoodoo voodoo lady cast up your voodoo vision
Let me know where did my baby go where did my lovin' baby go
Hoodoo voodoo lady shake your black cat tooth and your mojo bone
And bring my baby home bring my baby back home yeah

I know she didn't go up to New York City
She thinks that New York City is a little too pretty
I know she didn't go to sunny California
For she thinks that California is a little too phoney
I don't think she went up to north Alaska
She'd've told me cept I might forgot to ask her
And I don't think she went to east St Louis
But she might've gone to China for a little Chop Suey
Wherever she is I'm gonna run right there with you just tell me where
Hoodoo voodoo lady make me a doll that I can stick with pins
So that I can win my baby back again
(Yeah c'mon do somethin' weird and mystical. )
[ guitar ]
Yeah I don't think I'll find her in the Okefenokee
Cause the Okefenokee is too wet and smoky
And I don't think I'll find her up in Mississippi
She may be crazy but she ain't that flippy
And she might've seen her sister in Amarillo
And she might've gone to Philly just to see another feller
She might be drillin' oil in North Dakota
Might have gone to Iceland for an icecream soda
But I gotta get her back if I'm gonna get well so cast your spell
Voodoo hoodoo lady mix me a potion hot bubbly and black
That I can sprinkle on her crack and maybe bring my baby back
(Hoodoo voodoo lady let me know where did that woman of mine go)I was only a young man
In those days. On that evening
Bitter there was nothing.
Nothing. I was in trouble
With a woman, and there was nothing
There but me and dead snow.

I stood on the street corner
In Minneapolis, lashed
This way and that.
Wind rose from some pit,
Hunting me.
Another bus to Saint Paul
Would arrive in three hours,
If I was lucky.

Then the young Sioux
Loomed beside me, his scars
Were just my age.

Ain't got no bus here
A long time, he said.
You got enough money
To get home on?

What did they do
To your hand? I answered.
He raised up his hook into the terrible starlight
And slashed the wind.

Oh, that? he said.
I had a bad time with a woman. Here,
You take this.

Did you ever feel a man hold
Sixty-five cents
In a hook,
And place it
Gently
In your freezing hand?

I took it.
It wasn't the money I needed.
But I took it.

'It's all set to test you' 
says the fisherman
who looked at me
with a half mocked smile 
and a devilish twinkle
in his eye
as he fished
where motorboats
sped by
scaring away the fish

Have you ever kissed a hooker's lips? 
Hopefully not after using your snips! 
It is on the endangered list is why.
I hope we don't have to kiss it goodbye

Hooliganism

Law is not sacred cow
So we should be afraid to protect and how? 
Law is above everything
Black or white must be same when looked at something

So it is freedom
And wisdom
That keeps us as one
Obedient and loving citizens

No officers should take law
Into hand and allow
Ruffians or law breakers 
To allow with open venture

So arrest all
And put in fail
For violating sacred norms
And gains the spirit of freedom

No one allowed to burn
Public property in turn
Attack the police offers on duty
And burn leader's effigy

This all shown intolerance
Disrespect for governance
And encouragement to hooliganism
And against the norms of humanism toohooray say the roses, today is blamesday
and we are red as blood.

hooray say the roses, today is Wednesday
and we bloom wher soldiers fell
and lovers too,
and the snake at the word.

hooray say the roses, darkness comes
all at once, like lights gone out,
the sun leaves dark continents
and rows of stone.

hooray say the roses, cannons and spires,
birds, bees, bombers, today is Friday
the hand holding a medal out the window,
a moth going by, half a mile an hour,
hooray hooray
hooray say the roses
we have empires on our stems,
the sun moves the mouth:
hooray hooray hooray
and that is why you like us.



eve. 

Hope was but a timid friend;
She sat without the grated den,
Watching how my fate would tend,
Even as selfish-hearted men. 

She was cruel in her fear;
Through the bars, one dreary day,
I looked out to see her there,
And she turned her face away! 

Like a false guard, false watch keeping,
Still, in strife, she whispered peace;
She would sing while I was weeping;
If I listened, she would cease. 

False she was, and unrelenting;
When my last joys strewed the ground,
Even Sorrow saw, repenting,
Those sad relics scattered round; 

Hope, whose whisper would have given
Balm to all my frenzied pain,
Stretched her wings, and soared to heaven,
Went, and ne'er returned again

ive thought to myself
why do i bother living
what am i waiting for
why do i stall
but i still hesitate
hesitate to end it
i hesitate because i still hope
i still wonder
what if i miss something
what if something better will come along
what if i find a cure
then i wold have ended it in vain
then there would have been no point in finishing it
there was still a chance
and i missed it
i wasted my life
what do i have to show of my time
nothing 
i should have stayed 
i'm such an idiot
why did i give up
why did i loose hope
why didn't i just be strong
it could have gotten better
but instead i give up
and bring pain 
not only to myself
but those who supposedly cared for me
who loved me but never told me
how could i have been so foolish
how could i have been so selfish
what did i gain out of it
nothing
i only lost
lost my life
lost my chance of happiness
lost my chance of hope
how could i do this to myself
everything i thought was wrong
i wasn't alone
people did care for me
people would have missed me
i was noticed
how was i unaware of all this
why didn't anybody tell me
why did they let me suffer
why.  

I'm writing you this poem, 
For you being you, 
I'm writing you this poem, 
Because I wanted to.

I'm writing you this poem, 
Cause I thought of you, 
I'm writing you this poem, 
For the wonderful things you do.

You have taught me right from wrong, 
You taught me how to love and praise, 
You taught me how to be hopeful, 
And now to be amazed.

Now it's my turn, 
to be like you, 
and look up to. 

You are a friend 
in a strange place.
In a crowd of people
you are a familiar face

You are a light
in a dark room.
You are the sun
that helps flowers bloom

You gave me happy thoughts
when all i knew was doom.
You protect me. 
like a baby in a womb

You saved my life
when I wanted to die.
you always held me
when I thought I would cry

You made me feel loved. 
you made me understand
when I was confused
you held my hand

I wish I could do the same
I wish I could help you too
but I guess I'm just a f*** up
through and through

I want to make you better
but I only make you worse
I guess I can only help you
once I'm laying in a hearse

You gave me hope
now I'm giving you some
once I'm gone, think 
of everything you can become

I'll leave you a note
tied onto my rope
where I hang by my neck
'Don't ever lose hope'We speak with the lip, and we dream in the soul,
 Of some better and fairer day;
And our days, the meanwhile, to that golden goal
 Are gliding and sliding away.
Now the world becomes old, now again it is young,
But "The better" 's forever the word on the tongue.

At the threshold of life hope leads us in--
 Hope plays round the mirthful boy;
Though the best of its charms may with youth begin,
 Yet for age it reserves its toy. 

This Is For Me
so many years of pain.
self inflicted. of course
trying to feel was my intention
It's been weeks since I last cut
never in my life did I imagine how consumed I was
this is MY problem. I will fix it
the scars I bear are merely my own 'Battle Scars'
with heaps of ink, and a focused mind
I WILL BEAT THIS! 
because
This Is For Me


there is Hope for all who suffer


Hope, anything that one wants, and at
the moment of 'hope' they do not have.

If hope were a feeling, I would hope, 
it be one of honesty and integrity.
I would hope it would be love and empathy.

If hope were a food, I would hope it
would be filled with nourishment.

If hope were music, I would hope, it
was the kind of music, that you loved.

If hope were a sound, I would hope it
would by a symphony of love.

If hope were a religion, I would hope it
was your religion.

If hope were belief, then I would hope, 
that belief would be, that there is one
Supreme Being; who is by-lingual and
of all faiths, and all creeds and colors.

If hope were knowledge, I would hope, 
it had patience, understanding, the
ability of comprehending the other
persons point of view. I would also hope, 
that it had an unquenchable thirst, 
to continue to learn by experience and
research.

If hope could be seen, I would hope, all
would see, the good in their fellow man.

If hope were a wish, I would hope
that all your dreams, and ambitions
came true.

If hope were you.  

if hope were me, I
would hope, we never lost sight of
those less fortunate. I would hope
we would never be so self-centered
or busy, that we neglected to extend
a helping hand, to those in need.

Finally if you hope this ends, let me
conclude by saying

If hope were a human, I would hope, that it
realized, that if we want a better world, 
then we have to be better ourselves.

she hangs around the pruned rose bushes, 
with the hope that someday the spring will come, 
and the flowers will bloom again in the garden.

What is hope, ask the blue bird pair in early spring, 
they work diligently to bring every twig and grass, 
to build their nest in the corner nook of my house, 
I see the hope in the eyes of this lovely pair, 
They are dreaming of a happy home for their family. 

What is hope,  ask a lonesome soul, 
When the uncertainties linger around in mind, 
hope is the only refuge to calm our fears, 
When the loneliness sends one in depression, 
the hope of a companionship overshadows the despair.

What is hope, ask a human being, 
our life is a sand castle of hope on a sandy beach, 
with the lingering fear of drowning in occasional high tide, 
our destiny, our future, and our own survival, 
hangs around the magical hope, the hope that is the eternal inspiration. 

Hope in its eloquent presence, 
Flying in breeze with fragrance, 
Touching the heart thro’the fence-
Of Cheeks exquisite elegance, 
To revive the life’s essence; 

Hope dancing in hearts meadow, 
With flowers of color motley, 
Under promise of future shadows, 
Singing song of forgotten sorrow, 
With the hopeful hearts violin bow;The spirit killeth, but the letter giveth life.
The week is dealt out like a hand
That children pick up card by card.
One keeps getting the same hand.
One keeps getting the same card.
But twice a day -- except on Saturday --
With a hiss of soles, a rattle of tin,
My own gray Daemon pauses on the stair,
My own bald Fortune lifts me by the hair.
Woe's me! woe's me! In Folly's mailbox
Still laughs the postcard, Hope:
Your uncle in Australia
Has died and you are Pope,
For many a soul has entertained
A Mailman unawares --
And as you cry, Impossible,
A step is on the stairs.
One keeps getting the same dream
Delayed, marked "Payment Due,"
The bill that one has paid
Delayed, marked "Payment Due" --
Twice a day, in rotting mailbox,
The white grubs are new:
And Faith, once more, is mine
Faithfully, but Charity
Writes hopefully about a new
Asylum -- but Hope is as good as new.
Woe's me! woe's me! In Folly's mailbox
Still laughs the postcard, Hope:
Your uncle in Australia
Has died and you are Pope,
For many a soul has entertained
A mailman unawares --
And as you cry, Impossible,
A step is on the stairs. 

Our lives, discoloured with our present woes,
May still grow white and shine with happier hours.
So the pure limped stream, when foul with stains
Of rushing torrents and descending rains,
Works itself clear, and as it runs refines,
till by degrees the floating mirror shines;
Reflects each flower that on the border grows,
And a new heaven in it's fair bosom shows. 

At summer eve, when heaven's aerial bow
Spans with bright arch the glittering hills below,
Why to yon mountain turns the musing eye,
Whose sunbright summit mingles with the sky?
Why do those cliffs of shadowy tint appear
More sweet than all the landscape smiling near? -
'Tis distance lends enchantment to the view, 
And robes the mountain in its azure hue. 

Once upon a time, a crow was flying
 With its injured wings
With a hope of
He can fly high and high 
Hope never alone anyone, 
It gives rise to life
Like a new sun give rise to day
Like stars give rise to night 
Hope is bliss of life
Without hope life is nothinghope turned over
like a shell on the sand, 
echoing the waves, 

lapping at some distant shore
unheard, untouched, 
words fall on the graves

of desire and longing, 
marked by time. 
who are you? 

do you remember my name? 
the faint memory of your kiss, 
grown bitter on my lips

I feel darkness around me, 
Though I know there is Light.
I feel empty inside, 
Though I know there is Abundance.
Space makes me feel lonely, 
Though I know there is Love.
Thinking I am caged, 
Yet—I have Wings.
The bird inside me whispers: 
"Fly! "Hope is a seed
Saying; there are better things ahead
It's a good deed
Cause happiness it spread

When life turns down
With sadness and pain
We feel we are drown
But Hope is gain

Hope is a vision
We have in our minds
It's a Decision
To stand firm it reminds

It's dark for the world
But hope is light
Just a little hope
Can reach us to height


Far lit a shimmering lamp; it is seen, 
I am not alone, in the deep forest, I mean, 
Under the sun, I moved, lonely, forlorn, 
Moment ago, I was sleeping on the thorn, 

Then fearful wood, now lovely and good
With the tiny light, far lit, in the lively hood, 
No heat, no lumen, lamp must be of the hut, 
Realization: someone is there, safe and shut, 

 Whole day searched I, for like resemblance,  
Weary and tired and fearful, dark Somnolence, 
The thing which we can't see in bright light, 
Can be seen even a spark in the dark of night, 

Day means what? It is both, Dark and Bright 
Life means what? Is it both? Bark  and fight

Beneath the shadow of dawn's aerial cope,
With eyes enkindled as the sun's own sphere,
Hope from the front of youth in godlike cheer
Round the dark door that prayers nor dreams can ope,
And makes for joy the very darkness dear
That gives her wide wings play; nor dreams that fear
At noon may rise and pierce the heart of hope.
Then, when the soul leaves off to dream and yearn,
May truth first purge her eyesight to discern
What, once being known, leaves time no power to appall;
Till yoiuth at last, ere yet youth be not, learn
The kind wise word that falls from years that fall- 
'Hope thou not much, and fear thou not at all.

'I shall want to surge
And emerge
As an ordinary
But an exemplary 

I was trying 
But shying
For the fear 
Of pain to bear

It was drawback
That I failed to brush off as stake
But of now I firmly stand
And fully understand 

I do no miracle
But struggle
Against odd 
To add feather

I shall succeed
But heed
To each advice
That is rendered with hope and promise


Hope can blossom
While it kills clots, 
It can set morales
Or cover thy front.

Thou, whose worth
Is over thy rigors, 
Made a life curt
To smell the flowers.

Hope can blossom
While it makes thee sob, 
But no more dolor
Can remove an aplomb. 

Grey church sits lonely on the hill, 
Awaiting its next Sunday thrill.
Voices rising up to the spire, 
Kept in tune by the local choir.
Regulars that every week, 

Its rural town’s a busy place, 
Harbouring a mixed human race.
On the seventh day most sleep late, 
Don’t venture through the old lychgate.
They think about the open shops 
And whether lunch requires pork chops.

The bells ring out, the faithful meet, 
For some it is their only treat.
They catch up on the parish news, 
And who will this week, clean the pews.
Then wander home their minds refreshed, 
By words spoken when they were blessed.

Grey church that stands through passing time, 
Listening to its own clock chime.
Could tell a million happenings, 
Of centuries of natterings.
All the souls who have passed away, 
Laid to their rest, and there to stay.

So many feet this path have trod.
But it remains steadfast and true, 
All the inclement weather through.
Solitude for the broken heart, 
Hope for heaven when all depart.


  understand whilst you live: for in life deliverance abides.
If your bonds be not broken whilst living, what hope of
  deliverance in death? 
It is but an empty dream, that the soul shall have union with Him
  because it has passed from the body:
If He is found now, He is found then,
If not, we do but go to dwell in the City of Death.
If you have union now, you shall have it hereafter.
Bathe in the truth, know the true Guru, have faith in the true
  Name! 
Kabîr says: 'It is the Spirit of the quest which helps; I am the slave of this Spirit of the quest. 

Hope for you is right
hoping will never go wrong
I'm hoping for you.

dawn greets the violet heart
with a pink smile hopes. . . . . . . .
To take His lovely likeness more and more. 
It will not well, so she would bring about 
An ever brighter burnish than before 
And turns to wash it from her welling eyes
And breathes the blots off all with sighs on sighs. 
Her glass is blest but she as good as blind 
Holds till hand aches and wonders what is there; 
Her glass drinks light, she darkles down behind, 
All of her glorious gainings unaware.

The hissing wind and the swishing sea
with a vengeance turns the wind to lee

Ragging sails, the ship is free 
Seagull screams in the distance see

Distraught people in a ship at sway 
Creaking stern and the ropes'll, fray 

Vociferous sounds of the angry spray
To ghastly thoughts the heart a prey

Not a soul aboard that doth not pray
Rising hands against the wicked gray

Confusion mounting screams of dismay

Such was the scene and even yet 
A man in white I cannot forget

Unaware of all the cold and wet 
he sat eyes closed and face all set

He muttered to himself now and then
free from feelings of where and when

The calm of his face in darkness shown
with a majestic grandeur; he left his throne

Thus he spoke to the people aloud
'Brothers and sisters look at the cloud

The lord remembers his creation's plight
Through the crevice comes a ray of light 

The rescue boats you need not fight 
For yonder look the land’s in sight'

          Hope in my heart will never die
          .  

Hope is a strange invention - 
A Patent of the Heart - 
In unremitting action
Yet never wearing out - 

Of this electric Adjunct
Not anything is known
But its unique momentum
Embellish all we own -Hope is a tattered flag and a dream of time.
Hope is a heartspun word, the rainbow, the shadblow in white
The evening star inviolable over the coal mines,
The shimmer of northern lights across a bitter winter night,
The blue hills beyond the smoke of the steel works,
The birds who go on singing to their mates in peace, war, peace,
The ten-cent crocus bulb blooming in a used-car salesroom,
The horseshoe over the door, the luckpiece in the pocket,
The kiss and the comforting laugh and resolve—
Hope is an echo, hope ties itself yonder, yonder.
The spring grass showing itself where least expected,
The rolling fluff of white clouds on a changeable sky,
The broadcast of strings from Japan, bells from Moscow,
Of the voice of the prime minister of Sweden carried
Across the sea in behalf of a world family of nations
And Bach being broadcast from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania
And tall skyscrapers practically empty of tenants
And the hands of strong men groping for handholds

Hope is leaving me
or I'm giving up either.
Time is not tameless, 
I can't tame it rather.
The void cosmos has come down
down on my dreamless sleep and day.
Only I see the pebbles of past
upon the endless bay.
I am not proud of my any work, 
Yet I haven't filled the page, 
which can excel time and tense, 
and can win the cruel age

Hope is not for the wise, fear is for fools;
Change and the world, we think, are racing to a fall,
Open-eyed and helpless, in every newscast that is the news:
The time's events would seem mere chaos but all
Drift the one deadly direction. But this is only
The August thunder of the age, not the November.
Wise men hope nothing, the wise are naturally lonely
And think November as good as April, the wise remember
That Caesar and even final Augustulus had heirs,
And men lived on; rich unplanned life on earth
After the foreign wars and the civil wars, the border wars
And the barbarians: music and religion, honor and mirth
Renewed life's lost enchantments. But if life even
Had perished utterly, Oh perfect loveliness of earth and heaven.

'Hope' is the thing with feathers—
That perches in the soul—
	                        

	                        
	                          .  
	                        

	                        
	                          .  


That perches in the soul—
And sings the tune without the words—
And never stops—at all—

And sweetest—in the Gale—is heard—
And sore must be the storm—
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm—

I've heard it in the chillest land—
And on the strangest Sea—
Yet, never, in Extremity,
It asked a crumb—of Me. 

After all the misery
That one often has 
That plagues our lives
We drown all our sorrows
In addictions of life

We slowly pull away
From people who care
And walk alone
Without a care

We fight off imaginary 
Monsters of the dark
We feed off of our own
Misery and plight

Then paths we trod
Have sickened our soul
We start to fight back
To regain our soul

Hour after hour
Day after day
We finally see hope
A new light 
A new day

Then looking back
From danger you fled
You smile to your self
There's hope in the end


Hope Was Hoping
That Hopefully
It would be
Able to Fulfil
The Hopes Of 
The Many Hopeful 
Humans But
Hope Is What Still keeps
The Hope Going. 

Hope, like the short-lived ray that gleams awhile
Through wintry skies, upon the frozen waste,
Cheers e'en the face of misery to a smile;
But soon the momentary pleasure's past.

How oft, my Delia, since our last farewell,
(Years that have rolled since that distressful hour), 
Grieved I have said, when most our hopes prevail,
Our promised happiness is least secure.

Oft I have thought the scene of troubles closed,
And hoped once more to gaze upon your charms;
As oft some dire mischance has interposed,
And snatched the expected blessing from my arms.

The seaman thus, his shattered vessel lost,
Still vainly strives to shun the threatening death;
And while he thinks to gain the friendly coast,
And drops his feet, and feels the sands beneath,

Borne by the wave steep-sloping from the shore,
Back to the inclement deep, again he beats
The surge aside, and seems to treat secure;
And now the refluent wave his baffled toil defeats.

Had you, my love, forbade me to pursue
My fond attempt, disdainfully retired,
And with proud scorn compelled me to subdue
The ill-fated passion by yourself inspired;

Then haply to some distant spot removed,
Hopeless to gain, unwilling to molest
With fond entreaties whom I dearly loved,
Despair or absense had redeemed my rest.

But now, sole partner in my Delia's heart,
Yet doomed far off in exile to complain,
Eternal absence cannot ease my smart,
And hope subsists but to prolong my pain.

Oh, then, kind Heaven, be this my latest breath!
Here end my life, or make it worth my care;
Absence from whom we love is worse than death,
And frustrate hope severer than dismay. 

Aurora that came with
the dawn, 
Strengthened the the ties of life, 
With a bouquet of new songs, 
For scattering on the face of life, 
In the same dawn, 
The waves of sound flown, 
The face of moon turned dim, 
Frightened all In the distant skies, 
The stars also turned dim, 
Diversion of sky turned in
conversion, 
The temples and the churches, 
Played the same music, 
Yes, same in the vocal music of
mosques, 
And the lyric of Nanak, 
All dissolved in the wine of hope, 
For the hungry thirsty living hearts

Hope pinned

It is rightly said
The rules are not laid
But it is to be observed
And be given justice if it deserved

We are right thinking people
Who always struggle? 
And get desired effect
After putting into act

So we need someone
Who can be best one? 
Walk along risky path
Without being afraid of death

We want no applauses
But steps 
To march with resolve
And intention to solve

If such combination is possible
It shall be blessings for the individual
To go ahead as planned
And hope definitely pinned


Unfading Hope! when life's last embers burn -
When soul to soul, and dust to dust return, 
Heaven to thy charge resigns the awful hour!
Oh! then thy kingdom comes, Immortal Power!
What though each spark of earth-born rapture fly
The quivering lip, pale cheek, and closing eye!
Bright to the soul thy seraph hands convey
The morning dream of life's eternal day -
Then, then, the triumph and the trance begin,
And all the phoenix-spirit burns within!

Oh, deep enchanting prelude to repose,
The dawn of bliss, the twilight of our woes!
Yet half I hear the parting spirit sigh,
It is a dread and awful thing to die!
Mysterious worlds, untravell'd by the sun!
Where Time's far-wandering tide has never run,
From your unfathom'd shades, and viewless spheres,
A warning comes, unheard by other ears.
'Tis Heaven's commanding trumpet, long and loud,
Like Sinai's thunder, pealing from the cloud!
While Nature hears, with terror-mingled thrust,
The shock that hurls her fabric to the dust;
With mortal terrors clouds immortal bliss,
And shrieks and hovers o'er the dark abyss!

Daughter of Faith, awake, arise, illume
The dread unknown, the chaos of the tomb!
Melt and dispel, ye spectre-doubts, that roll
Cimmerian darkness on the parting soul!
Fly, like the moon-eyed herald of dismay,
Chased, on his night-steed, by the star of day!
The strife is o'er - the pangs of Nature close,
And life's last rapture triumphs o'er her woes.
Hark! as the spirit eyes, with eagle gaze,
The noon of heaven, undazzled by the blaze,
On heavenly winds, that waft her to the sky,
Float the sweet tones of star-born melody;
Wild as that hallow'd anthem, sent to hail
Bethlehem's shepherds in the lonely vale,
When Jordan hush'd his waves, and midnight still
Watch'd on the holy towers of Zion hill!

Soul of the just! companion of the dead!
Where is thy home, and whither art thou fled?
Back to its heavenly source thy being goes,
Swift as the comet wheels to whence he rose;
Doom'd on his airy path awhile to burn,
And doom'd, like thee, to travel and return.
Hark! from the world's exploding centre driven,
With sounds, that shook the firmament of heaven,
Careers the fiery giant, fast and far,
On bickering wheels, and adamantine car: 
From planet whirl'd to planet more remote,
He visits realms beyond the reach of thought:
But, wheeling homeward, when his course is run,
Curbs the red yoke, and mingles with the sun!
So hath the traveller of earth unfurl'd
Her trembling wings, emerging from the world;
And, o'er the path by mortal never trod,

I can't stand feeling 
That time is running out
But I do
And I don't think there is much 
That I can do about it
It is engraved into me
It is apart of my genetic structure
I'm in a panic searching for a heart
That is not beating
Well it is 
It's just not in earshot yet
I can complain and complain
But where is that really going to get me
Well I'll tell you where 
Because I have been there before

It gets me thinking about
How life is hopeless
And I am hopeless
But in all actuality 
It is not and I am not
But I am not one who believes in hope
Hope is a long term word
It is the future 
And right now my mind is fixed on the present
Hope will not make me happy today


I hope your happy with your life
I hope your happy with your wife
I hope you see what you have done
I hope you see that this is all wrong

I hope you realise that your not perfect
I hope you see that money's not worth it
I hope you realise that family comes first
I hope you see that my smile was rehearsed

I hope you see that your tearing me apart
I hope you someday grow a heart
I hope someday I will want to see you
I hope someday I wont have to see you

I hope you suffer, but I dont want that
I hope you die, but I dont mean that
I hope someday your 'love' will be real
I hope someday you will 'feel'

I hope you realise that money cant heal
I hope someday you'll feel, what I feel
I hope that before you die
I hope to tell you, I wont cry

I hoped you would be a good dad
I hoped you wouldnt make me mad
But all my hopes from before are gone
just like the love you had for their mom

I hope that I see you one last time
I hope I get to tell you this: 
'I wish I never knew you
because of you. . 

I wish I didnt exist

'hopeless is nothing knew 
hopeless is a crazy view
hopeless is in me and you.

Hopeless rule over everyone
hopeless has a fairy wand
hopeless has always won.
hopeless is never fun.

Hopeless leads to severe depression
but yet its our confession
hopeless is in our consesion
hopeless is a profession.

Hopeless just let me be
hopeless them and not for me.
hopeless never sets me free. 

Did you hear the scream

the day he died? 

It haunts me still.

 

Whats stronger then love? 

Is it death's sweet embrace? 

A tear running down his cheek

as he picks up the gun? 

His blood in the fire? 

 

Did you hear the scream

the day he died? 

It haunts me still.

 

Death is stronger then love.

For when he died

my heart died with him. 

 

Did you hear the scream

the day he died? 

It haunts me still.

 

Pictures of him

follow me now.

The memories.  .  

never fade.

 

Did you hear the scream

the day he died? 

It haunts me still.

 

he is gone

and i am not.

 

It haunts me still.

 

Did you hear the scream

the day he died? 

It haunts me still.

 

he is gone

and i am not.

 

Did you hear the scream

the day he died? 

 

Where were you 

the day he died? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ill see you on the other side.

i love you. Goodbye. 

Strength is built upon fear, What is there to fear when you have no strength, You can't carry on if your weak. Some were chose to win, to lose its fate or is it destiny? You choose where to begin.

Time goes and you start to grow, Bad choices are made and you need to go. Do something wrong and you will feel it ten fold your body, Mind, And spirit will not hold, Like a baby bird without a mother defenseless and humble, Easy prey to strike at, Once your spotted they will never back down, Throw more things at you to see if you will drown.

You dodged the bullet its time to restart be honest and you will get a fresh start, We will take something you love because you are weak, They say it will keep you out of trouble which in the end will turn your brain into rubble. 

Father forgive me I have sinned why do I even care you will always win. Your chance is over who cares if you made it one little thing and it will be fated, determined were you are your still a threat you can't pass it, Why let you be rewarded when punishment can be afforded. 

I think through the long, long evenings,
Such thoughts of intensest pain,
And I hope and watch for her coming,
But I hope and watch in vain,
My life is a long, long journey
Over a barren moor,
With nought but my own dark shadow
Hastening on before.

I'm weary of all this watching,
Aweary of life and thought;
For there's little hope in the distance,
And for peace-I know it not!
Oh, why must we think and shudder,
And shudder and think again?
When life's but a dance of shadows
Haunting a barren plain

I can see it in your eyes, theres something you must say. 
It will be ok. 
Please don't go away. 
I want you to stay, but your moving so far away. 
Maybe some other day, we can be ok.  
Is that what you were gonna say? 
You don't seem to know, how everyday I go. 
Just a little bit further down this road. 
Im not coming back, you''ll be dressed in black. 
Long before you ever know, that everything you said it was all in your head.  
You never needed to care about someone who wasn't even there. Don't get me wrong I really did care, life just wasn't fair, it was to much to bare. 
I can't be there anymore. 
I've given in to something pure. 
 Now begins the very end. 
The days that never seem to end, I'll never ever hurt again. 
For the rest of my days I'll be lost in a haze. 
Line after line, takes me further away. 
We'll never ever be ok, I'll never quit fading away. . 

A wave 
That breaks softly and
Hurts stormily and
Vanishes horizontally

A tempest 
That blows calmly and
Destroys aimlessly and
The head is messed up


Staring at my reflection in the mirror, 
Hating everything I see, 
Wishing I was someone else, 
Wishing someone was there for me.
The feeling of lonliness, neglect, and rejection, 
Has finally reached my full attention.

I'm living a life with no purpose or appeal, 
This nightmare that I'm having is actually real.
Walking into my room, I see sharp objects not being used, 
I pick one of them up & start to abuse.

I'm slashing my veins with a razorblade, 
Watching the blood fall to the floor, 
The pain is unbearable and my breathing has stopped, 
As I crash into the door.

I collapse in the cold blood that once filled my wrisits, 
Lying there dead with a limp body, 
Giving death a kiss.

Suicide gave me everything I wanted, 
It gave me recognition from the people who neglected. 

When a pine is felled in the forest
what can the other pines do, but rue. 
helplessly rooted to their spots.

They rattle their boughs in scared demur, 
rock their trunks as if trying to uproot, 
but all in vain.  

it is but  the nature's rule 
to stand desolate amongst piling ruins
waiting in silence for their turn.

But in what way is a common man
better than the immovable pines
.  

walking, talking, eating and sleeping
.  

yet a vegetable enduring
domineering Machiavellians
and living like a forlorn human-pine, 
without a fight, bending his spine
by yielding down to ruthless exploitation? ! 

.

(The first stanza and the basic idea of this poem are inspired by a sloka (Sanskrit poem)    from Ramayana by Audikavi Valmiki)Loneliness has made me a hopeless romantic, 
I don't have the youth or charm to offer you, 
I don't have the great health or wealth to share with you, 
I only have me, a hopeless romantic, to make you smile at me.

When you first smiled at me, 
your greetings ignited the sparkles of love in me, 
I saw the mirage of the love oasis in your eyes, 
I daydreamt of the fountain of affection in your smiles.

When you first touched my hands, 
I almost got electrocuted by the loving sensation, 
When I squeezed your hands with mine, 
the sweats of love were born in the warmth of our affection.

When we were together for a few moments, 
my loneliness hid itself in some distant corner, 
Those few hours of conversation, fun and games, 
will remain in my thoughts for days to come.

When you bid farewell with a gentle hug, 
I thought I lost the biggest treasure in the world, 
Even if you will be gone for a while, 
Till we meet, I will be daydreaming about you day and night. 



HOPELESSLY HOPING


Hopelessly hoping
as I keep on yearning
for a love that was lost
to return to the coast
where I let my heart
wait where we depart.

Upon that vast coast
of lying sand all accross
I painted my promise
to wait you in the premise
that I'll keep my heart
loving you from the start.

Days and season's pass
Yet my yearning never last 
Even if I'm hopelesly hoping
for your love to be returning
yet  I'll wait until the last
breath of a love unsurpassed. 

I look in the mirror and my eyes consume me, 
I'm lost in a void seeking the person i should be.
I once knew the girl, but she cowered, she ran; 
far from this place I've created, far from these destructive hands.

I tread a path that fades to grey, 
but I'm so sure I've lost my way.
I beg and i plead; I drop to my knees and pray; 

I remember when I was just a little kid, 
walkin' down the street and holdin' my mother's hand-
but she's no longer proud of me so alone I stand
glaring at my shattered past wishing so desperately it'd mend. 

Failure and disappointment is my most popular trend, 
I'm trapped in a maze of sorrow within', 
Someone, help me escape this, please make this end.

I ravage my thoughts, time and time again; 
contemplating what could be my last suicide attempt. 
with a shot glass to my right and a pipe to my lips
I convince myself to give my life another chance.

Then my mind throws to me yet another question, 
Doesn't everyone long for a sense of acceptance.? 
but I come back with the mere suggestion-
that maybe my wounds won't heal because this pain is destined. 

My suffering intensifies and the treachery is relentless; 
I writhe inside as i whimsy the thought of being nonexistent. 
I try and lose myself in false bliss but all happiness remains fiction, 
and the worst part is that I allow my agony to be unwitnessed. 

As I inhale what alters my mind-
I mutilate my body with razors and and tell myself that I'm fine.
Blood stains my clothing with the scent of iron
as silent, profound tears, smear my eye liner.

Then once again I stare upon my reflection
and I remember the identity of the girl in the mirror-
So traumatized by terror, of trial and error-
I bound my wounds and walk away as my heart remains dismantled.


('Hope springs eternal in the human breast'. Alexander Pope ( . From 'An Essay On Man') .
 


Hope is more practical two  other religious virtues.
Hope sustains us in the present; and into the future, 
which may turn out extremely  well or ill.
Who among us can see into the future, good or ill? 

Patience and Endurance are the friends of Hope.
Together these three virtues will get you through 
times of serious ill health and financial worries.
Times when you moved to a new town, searching.
 
Many hope for wealth and a spacious, well-built house
on a large section, then a rambling mansion and more property: 
Others want fame and prestige through their wealth; 
they wish  to be on the newspapers' rich list.

Most hope to find romantic love by and by. 
It is  a game you will probably win, but could lose.
To be dumped by your girlfriend is like a shock, 
but in time you should recover and find a new love.

Comparatively few hope to succeed as writers, 
in fiction or nonfiction, poet or playwright.
Success may await the writer, in all genres, who has hope, 
and practises every day, to improve by fine-tuning.

             - July,"She rules world"
As we are told
Her kingdom is unique
Her glory is at peak

Yes, she has kindness 
That is seen on face
With no concern for tomorrow
She stands alone and allows

She brings in 
Real spring
With beautiful kids
For real home to lead

In her refuge
We look so huge
Shape our dreams for tomorrow
And silently go 

She closes eyes satisfactorily 
As her work is seen not temporarily
She stands supreme in all eyes
With high hopes to fly


There must be something in this breeze
To my heart it may bring peace; 
But how will you get a lifetime of ease
When you're lost in a maze

The year has passed
The New Year has arrived
All the pains sadness and angriness has become past
All the happiness, sweetness and love has arrived
All the sickness, Madness and childishness has gone
All the maturity, intelligence and hopes has arrived 
My all the things are now my past
My all concentration is just focusing on future
New Year has arrived with hope
A hope of goodness in everything
A hope that my country will be in peace
A hope that all problems may come with a simple solution
May my all the relations become more sweet and loveable? 
May my all pathetic memories be just past
May my life be quite simple
May my life be full of joy
Past year is a past don’t matter what was it
But the future is unknown and unseen
Don’t know that what will happen
Just hope that everything will be good and ok
So I hope that every hope will not just hope
Hope we can say next year with hope that Happy New Year


Hoppity, hoppity,
Hoppity, hoppity, hop.
Whenever I tell him
Politely to stop it, he
Says he can't possibly stop.

  If he stopped hopping,
He couldn't go anywhere,
Couldn't go anywhere. 
That's why he always goes
Hoppity, hoppity,
Hoppity,
Hoppity,
Hop. 

Beneath the willow wound round with ivy
we take cover from the worst
of the storm, with a greatcoat round
our shoulders and my hands around your waist.

I've got it wrong. That isn't ivy
entwined in the bushes round
the wood, but hops. You intoxicate me!
Let's spread the greatcoat on the ground. 

The stars hang thick in the apple tree, 
The south wind smells of the pungent sea, 
Gold tulip cups are heavy with dew. 
The night's for you, Sweetheart, for you! 
Starfire rains from the vaulted blue. 

Listen! The dancing of unseen leaves. 
A drowsy swallow stirs in the eaves. 
Only a maiden is sorrowing. 
'T is night and spring, Sweetheart, and spring! 
Starfire lights your heart's blossoming. 

In the intimate dark there's never an ear, 
Though the tulips stand on tiptoe to hear, 
So give; ripe fruit must shrivel or fall. 
As you are mine, Sweetheart, give all! 
Starfire sparkles, your coronal. 

How will this beauty, when I am far hence,
Sweep back upon me and engulf my mind!

How will these hours, when we twain are gray,
Turned in their sapphire tide, come flooding o'er us

His portrait hung upon the wall.
     Oh how at us he used to stare.
Each Sunday when I made my call! --
     And when one day it wasn't there,
Quite quick I seemed to understand
     The light was green to hold her hand.

Her eyes were amorously lit;
     I knew she wouldn't mind at all.
Yet what I did was sit and sit
     Seeing that blankness on the wall . . .
Horatio had a gentle face,--
     How would my mug look in his place?

That oblong of wall-paper wan!
     And while she prattled prettily
I sensed the red light going on,
     So I refused a cup of tea,
And took my gold-topped cane and hat--
     My going seemed to leave her flat.

Horatio was a decent guy,
     And when she ravished from her heart
A damsite better man than I,
     She seemed to me,--well, just a tart:
Her lack of tact I can't explain.
     His picture,--is it hung again

A Lay Made About the Year Of The City CCCLX

I

Lars Porsena of Closium
That the great house of Tarquin
Should suffer wrong no more.
And named a trysting day,
And bade his messengers ride forth,
East and west and south and north,
To summon his array.

II

East and west and south and north
The messengers ride fast,
And tower and town and cottage
Have heard the trumpet's blast.
Shame on the false Etruscan
Who lingers in his home,
When Porsena of Clusium
Is on the march for Rome.

III

The horsemen and the footmen
Are pouring in amain
From many a stately market-place,
From many a fruitful plain,
From many a lonely hamlet,
Which, hid by beech and pine,
Like an eagle's nest, hangs on the crest
Of purple Apennine;

IV

From lordly Volaterrae,
Where scowls the far-famed hold
Piled by the hands of giants
For godlike kings of old;
From seagirt Populonia,
Whose sentinels descry
Sardinia's snowy mountain-tops
Fringing the southern sky;

V

From the proud mart of Pisae,
Where ride Massilia's triremes
Heavy with fair-haired slaves;
From where sweet Clanis wanders
Through corn and vines and flowers;
From where Cortona lifts to heaven
Her diadem of towers.

VI

Tall are the oaks whose acorns
Drop in dark Auser's rill;
Fat are the stags that champ the boughs
Of the Ciminian hill;
Beyond all streams Clitumnus
Is to the herdsman dear;
Best of all pools the fowler loves
The great Volsinian mere.

VII

But now no stroke of woodman
Is heard by Auser's rill;
No hunter tracks the stag's green path
Up the Ciminian hill;
Unwatched along Clitumnus
Grazes the milk-white steer;
Unharmed the water fowl may dip
In the Volsminian mere.

VIII

The harvests of Arretium,
This year, old men shall reap;
This year, young boys in Umbro
Shall plunge the struggling sheep;
And in the vats of Luna,
This year, the must shall foam
Round the white feet of laughing girls
Whose sires have marched to Rome.

IX

There be thirty chosen prophets,
The wisest of the land,
Who alway by Lars Porsena
Both morn and evening stand:
Evening and morn the Thirty
Have turned the verses o'er,
Traced from the right on linen white
By mighty seers of yore.

X

And with one voice the Thirty
Have their glad answer given:
'Go forth, go forth, Lars Porsena;
Go forth, beloved of Heaven;
Go, and return in glory
To Clusium's royal dome;
And hang round Nurscia's altars
The golden shields of Rome.'

XI

And now hath every city
Sent up her tale of men;
The foot are fourscore thousand,
The horse are thousands ten.
Before the gates of Sutrium
Is met the great array.
A proud man was Lars Porsena
Upon the trysting day.

XII

For all the Etruscan armies
Were ranged beneath his eye,
And many a banished Roman,
And many a stout ally;
And with a mighty following
To join the muster came
The Tusculan Mamilius,
Prince of the Latian name.

XIII

But by the yellow Tiber
Was tumult and affright:
From all the spacious champaign
To Rome men took their flight.
A mile around the city,
The throng stopped up the ways;
A fearful sight it was to see
Through two long nights and days.

XIV

For aged folks on crutches,
And women great with child,
And mothers sobbing over babes
That clung to them and smiled,
And sick men borne in litters
High on the necks of slaves,
And troops of sun-burned husbandmen
With reaping-hooks and staves,

XV

And droves of mules and asses
Laden with skins of wine,
And endless flocks of goats and sheep,
And endless herds of kine,
And endless trains of wagons
That creaked beneath the weight
Of corn-sacks and of household goods,
Choked every roaring gate.

XVI

Now, from the rock Tarpeian,
Could the wan burghers spy
The line of blazing villages
Red in the midnight sky.
The Fathers of the City,
They sat all night and day,
For every hour some horseman come
With tidings of dismay.

XVII

To eastward and to westward
Have spread the Tuscan bands;
Nor house, nor fence, nor dovecote
In Crustumerium stands.
Verbenna down to Ostia
Hath wasted all the plain;
Astur hath stormed Janiculum,
And the stout guards are slain.

XVIII

I wis, in all the Senate, [wis: know]
There was no heart so bold,
But sore it ached, and fast it beat,
When that ill news was told.
Forthwith up rose the Consul,
Up rose the Fathers all;
In haste they girded up their gowns,
And hied them to the wall.

XIX

They held a council standing,
Before the River-Gate;
Short time was there, ye well may guess,
For musing or debate.
Out spake the Consul roundly:
'The bridge must straight go down;
For, since Janiculum is lost,
Nought else can save the town.'

XX

Just then a scout came flying,
All wild with haste and fear:
'To arms! to arms! Sir Consul:
Lars Porsena is here.'
On the low hills to westward
The Consul fixed his eye,
And saw the swarthy storm of dust
Rise fast along the sky.

XXI

And nearer fast and nearer
Doth the red whirlwind come;
And louder still and still more loud,
From underneath that rolling cloud,
Is heard the trumpet's war-note proud,
The trampling, and the hum.
And plainly and more plainly
Now through the gloom appears,
Far to left and far to right,
In broken gleams of dark-blue light,
The long array of helmets bright,
The long array of spears.

XXII

And plainly and more plainly,
Above that glimmering line,
Now might ye see the banners
Of twelve fair cities shine;
But the banner of proud Clusium
Was highest of them all,
The terror of the Umbrian,
The terror of the Gaul.

XXIII

And plainly and more plainly
Now might the burghers know,
By port and vest, by horse and crest,
Each warlike Lucumo.
There Cilnius of Arretium
On his fleet roan was seen;
And Astur of the four-fold shield,
Girt with the brand none else may wield,
Tolumnius with the belt of gold,
And dark Verbenna from the hold
By reedy Thrasymene.

XXIV

Fast by the royal standard,
O'erlooking all the war,
Lars Porsena of Clusium
Sat in his ivory car.
By the right wheel rode Mamilius,
Prince of the Latian name;
And by the left false Sextus,
That wrought the deed of shame.

XXV

But when the face of Sextus
Was seen among the foes,
A yell that rent the firmament
From all the town arose.
On the house-tops was no woman
But spat towards him and hissed,
No child but screamed out curses,
And shook its little fist.

XXVI

But the Consul's brow was sad,
And the Consul's speech was low,
And darkly looked he at the wall,
And darkly at the foe.
'Their van will be upon us
Before the bridge goes down;
And if they once may win the bridge,
What hope to save the town?'

XXVII

Then out spake brave Horatius,
The Captain of the Gate:
'To every man upon this earth
Death cometh soon or late.
And how can man die better
Than facing fearful odds,
For the ashes of his fathers,
And the temples of his gods,

XXVIII

'And for the tender mother
Who dandled him to rest,
And for the wife who nurses
His baby at her breast,
And for the holy maidens
Who feed the eternal flame,
To save them from false Sextus
That wrought the deed of shame?

XXIX

'Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul,
With all the speed ye may;
I, with two more to help me,
Will hold the foe in play.
In yon strait path a thousand
May well be stopped by three.
Now who will stand on either hand,
And keep the bridge with me?'

XXX

Then out spake Spurius Lartius;
A Ramnian proud was he:
'Lo, I will stand at thy right hand,
And keep the bridge with thee.'
And out spake strong Herminius;
Of Titian blood was he:
'I will abide on thy left side,
And keep the bridge with thee.'

XXXI

'Horatius,' quoth the Consul,
'As thou sayest, so let it be.'
And straight against that great array
Forth went the dauntless Three.
For Romans in Rome's quarrel
Spared neither land nor gold,
Nor son nor wife, nor limb nor life,
In the brave days of old.

XXXII

Then none was for a party;
Then all were for the state;
Then the great man helped the poor,
And the poor man loved the great:
Then lands were fairly portioned;
Then spoils were fairly sold:
The Romans were like brothers
In the brave days of old.

XXXIII

Now Roman is to Roman
More hateful than a foe,
And the Tribunes beard the high,
And the Fathers grind the low.
As we wax hot in faction,
In battle we wax cold:
Wherefore men fight not as they fought
In the brave days of old.

XXXIV

Now while the Three were tightening
Their harness on their backs,
The Consul was the foremost man
To take in hand an axe:
And Fathers mixed with Commons
Seized hatchet, bar, and crow,
And smote upon the planks above,
And loosed the props below.

XXXV

Meanwhile the Tuscan army,
Right glorious to behold,
Come flashing back the noonday light,
Rank behind rank, like surges bright
Of a broad sea of gold.
Four hundred trumpets sounded
A peal of warlike glee,
As that great host, with measured tread,
And spears advanced, and ensigns spread,
Rolled slowly towards the bridge's head,
Where stood the dauntless Three.

XXXVI

The Three stood calm and silent,
And looked upon the foes,
And a great shout of laughter
From all the vanguard rose:
And forth three chiefs came spurring
Before that deep array;
To earth they sprang, their swords they drew,
And lifted high their shields, and flew
To win the narrrow way;

XXXVII

Aunus from green Tifernum,
And Seius, whose eight hundred slaves
Sicken in Ilva's mines;
And Picus, long to Clusium
Vassal in peace and war,
Who led to fight his Umbrian powers
From that gray crag where, girt with towers,
The fortress of Nequinum lowers
O'er the pale waves of Nar.

XXXVIII

Stout Lartius hurled down Aunus
Into the stream beneath;
Herminius struck at Seius,
And clove him to the teeth;
At Picus brave Horatius
Darted one fiery thrust;
And the proud Umbrian's gilded arms
Clashed in the bloody dust.

XXXIX

Then Ocnus of Falerii
Rushed on the Roman Three;
And Lausulus of Urgo,
The rover of the sea;
And Aruns of Volsinium,
Who slew the great wild boar,
The great wild boar that had his den
Amidst the reeds of Cosa's fen,
And wasted fields, and slaughtered men,
Along Albinia's shore.

XL

Herminius smote down Aruns:
Lartius laid Ocnus low:
Right to the heart of Lausulus
Horatius sent a blow.
'Lie there,' he cried, 'fell pirate!
No more, aghast and pale,
From Ostia's walls the crowd shall mark
The track of thy destroying bark.
No more Campania's hinds shall fly
To woods and caverns when they spy
Thy thrice accursed sail.'

XLI

But now no sound of laughter
Was heard among the foes.
A wild and wrathful clamor
From all the vanguard rose.
Six spears' lengths from the entrance
Halted that deep array,
And for a space no man came forth
To win the narrow way.

XLII

But hark! the cry is Astur:
And lo! the ranks divide;
Comes with his stately stride.
Upon his ample shoulders
Clangs loud the four-fold shield,
And in his hand he shakes the brand
Which none but he can wield.

XLIII

He smiled on those bold Romans
A smile serene and high;
He eyed the flinching Tuscans,
And scorn was in his eye.
Quoth he, 'The she-wolf's litter
Stand savagely at bay:
But will ye dare to follow,
If Astur clears the way?'

XLIV

Then, whirling up his broadsword
With both hands to the height,
He rushed against Horatius,
And smote with all his might.
With shield and blade Horatius
Right deftly turned the blow.
The blow, though turned, came yet too nigh;
It missed his helm, but gashed his thigh:
The Tuscans raised a joyful cry
To see the red blood flow.

XLV

He reeled, and on Herminius
He leaned one breathing-space;
Then, like a wild cat mad with wounds,
Sprang right at Astur's face.
Through teeth, and skull, and helmet
So fierce a thrust he sped,
The good sword stood a hand-breadth out
Behind the Tuscan's head.

XLVI

Fell at that deadly stroke,
As falls on Mount Alvernus
A thunder smitten oak:
Far o'er the crashing forest
The giant arms lie spread;
And the pale augurs, muttering low,
Gaze on the blasted head.

XLVII

On Astur's throat Horatius
Right firmly pressed his heel,
And thrice and four times tugged amain,
Ere he wrenched out the steel.
'And see,' he cried, 'the welcome,
Fair guests, that waits you here!
What noble Lucomo comes next
To taste our Roman cheer?'

XLVIII

But at his haughty challange
A sullen murmur ran,
Mingled of wrath, and shame, and dread,
Along that glittering van.
There lacked not men of prowess,
Nor men of lordly race;
For all Etruria's noblest
Were round the fatal place.

XLIX

But all Etruria's noblest
Felt their hearts sink to see
On the earth the bloody corpses,
In the path the dauntless Three:
And, from the ghastly entrance
Where those bold Romans stood,
All shrank, like boys who unaware,
Ranging the woods to start a hare,
Come to the mouth of the dark lair
Where, growling low, a fierce old bear
Lies amidst bones and blood.

L

Was none who would be foremost
To lead such dire attack;
But those behind cried, 'Forward!'
And those before cried, 'Back!'
And backward now and forward
Wavers the deep array;
And on the tossing sea of steel
To and frow the standards reel;
And the victorious trumpet-peal
Dies fitfully away.

LI

Yet one man for one moment
Strode out before the crowd;
Well known was he to all the Three,
And they gave him greeting loud.
'Now welcome, welcome, Sextus!
Now welcome to thy home!
Why dost thou stay, and turn away?
Here lies the road to Rome.'

LII

Thrice looked he at the city;
Thrice looked he at the dead;
And thrice came on in fury,
And thrice turned back in dread:
And, white with fear and hatred,
Scowled at the narrow way
Where, wallowing in a pool of blood,
The bravest Tuscans lay.

LIII

But meanwhile axe and lever
Have manfully been plied;
And now the bridge hangs tottering
Above the boiling tide.
'Come back, come back, Horatius!'
Loud cried the Fathers all.
'Back, Lartius! back, Herminius!
Back, ere the ruin fall!'

LIV

Back darted Spurius Lartius;
Herminius darted back:
And, as they passed, beneath their feet
They felt the timbers crack.
But when they turned their faces,
And on the farther shore
Saw brave Horatius stand alone,
They would have crossed once more.

LV

But with a crash like thunder
Fell every loosened beam,
And, like a dam, the mighty wreck
Lay right athwart the stream:
And a long shout of triumph
Rose from the walls of Rome,
As to the highest turret-tops
Was splashed the yellow foam.

LVI

And, like a horse unbroken
When first he feels the rein,
The furious river struggled hard,
And tossed his tawny mane,
And burst the curb and bounded,
Rejoicing to be free,
And whirling down, in fierce career,
Battlement, and plank, and pier,
Rushed headlong to the sea.

LVII

Alone stood brave Horatius,
But constant still in mind;
Thrice thirty thousand foes before,
And the broad flood behind.
'Down with him!' cried false Sextus,
With a smile on his pale face.
'Now yield thee,' cried Lars Porsena,
'Now yield thee to our grace.'

LVIII

Round turned he, as not deigning
Those craven ranks to see;
Nought spake he to Lars Porsena,
To Sextus nought spake he;
But he saw on Palatinus
The white porch of his home;
And he spake to the noble river
That rolls by the towers of Rome.

LVIX

'Oh, Tiber! Father Tiber!
To whom the Romans pray,
A Roman's life, a Roman's arms,
Take thou in charge this day!'
So he spake, and speaking sheathed
The good sword by his side,
And with his harness on his back,
Plunged headlong in the tide.

LX

No sound of joy or sorrow
Was heard from either bank;
But friends and foes in dumb surprise,
With parted lips and straining eyes,
Stood gazing where he sank;
And when above the surges,
They saw his crest appear,
All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,
And even the ranks of Tuscany
Could scarce forbear to cheer.

LXI

But fiercely ran the current,
Swollen high by months of rain:
And fast his blood was flowing;
And he was sore in pain,
And heavy with his armor,
And spent with changing blows:
And oft they thought him sinking,
But still again he rose.

LXII

Never, I ween, did swimmer,
In such an evil case,
Struggle through such a raging flood
Safe to the landing place:
But his limbs were borne up bravely
By the brave heart within,
And our good father Tiber
Bare bravely up his chin.

LXIII

'Curse on him!' quoth false Sextus;
'Will not the villain drown?
But for this stay, ere close of day
We should have sacked the town!'
'Heaven help him!' quoth Lars Porsena
'And bring him safe to shore;
For such a gallant feat of arms
Was never seen before.'

LXIV

And now he feels the bottom;
Now on dry earth he stands;
Now round him throng the Fathers;
To press his gory hands;
And now, with shouts and clapping,
And noise of weeping loud,
He enters through the River-Gate
Borne by the joyous crowd.

LXV

They gave him of the corn-land,
That was of public right,
As much as two strong oxen
Could plough from morn till night;
And they made a molten image,
And set it up on high,
And there is stands unto this day
To witness if I lie.

LXVI

It stands in the Comitium
Plain for all folk to see;
Horatius in his harness,
Halting upon one knee:
And underneath is written,
In letters all of gold,
How valiantly he kept the bridge
In the brave days of old.

LXVII

And still his name sounds stirring
Unto the men of Rome,
As the trumpet-blast that cries to them
To charge the Volscian home;
And wives still pray to Juno
For boys with hearts as bold
As his who kept the bridge so well
In the brave days of old.

LXVIII

And in the nights of winter,
When the cold north winds blow,
And the long howling of the wolves
Is heard amidst the snow;
When round the lonely cottage
Roars loud the tempest's din,
And the good logs of Algidus
Roar louder yet within;

LXIX

When the oldest cask is opened,
And the largest lamp is lit;
When the chestnuts glow in the embers,
And the kid turns on the spit;
When young and old in circle
Around the firebrands close;
When the girls are weaving baskets,
And the lads are shaping bows;

LXX

When the goodman mends his armor,
And trims his helmet's plume;
When the goodwife's shuttle merrily
Goes flashing through the loom;
With weeping and with laughter
Still is the story told,
How well Horatius kept the bridge
In the brave days of old. 

When the sky is azure blue, 
the horizon draws a line
between heaven and earth.

On a misty day it gets blurred, 
closing the distance, limiting
your vision: seen and unseen.

When clouds gather, erasing
the skyline, darkness descends, 
enveloping the surroundings. 
 
And, then, clouds disappear, 
the dark lifts, mist clears, 
the view is sunlit, unimpeded.

The curve of earth beckons.
You try to outstrip; it recedes, 
alluring yet with new horizons. 

Horizon
Towards you as I walk on
To get nearer
you go farther

Horizon
You are an illusion
You are infinitely stretching points
Where sky meets earth
And the duet they dance

Horizon
You are the point Where blue mist of sky
And lovely green of earth
Mingle and merry
So close and yet so distant. 

The sun rises from within it
The sun sets behind it.
But what is it really? 
A fine line of the eye's imagination? 
We see it, but we will never touch it.
When in space we pass it by, 
So is it real? 
It's not like the equator with coordinates.
It has no exact location, no points.
Some say its the edge of the earth.
But I think not because the earth does not have edges.
It is where the naked eye can't see any farther.
To the mind's eye it is where we can no longer see what lays beyond..
Maybe its the fine line seperating sane from insane.
But does that mean if we can never cross this line then there will never be insanity? 
But see we do cross this line when we go into space, so does that mean space is insane? 
No, but insanity is also uncertainty and space is uncertain and unknown.
This line so called the 'Horizon' is uncertain and has no points.
We can always see it, but never touch it, this might mean it is a feigning line of fantasy, 
Seems real but it could just be an allusion.
So what is the Horizon exactly? 
There are no points pinpointing its location other than the image of the mind's eye.
So this mean that the Horizon can not be classified as real because things that we see
aren't always real. 
Are we not all just all living in a dream within a dream, where we make our wishes of 
imaginations seem real? 
Really were all living in a fantasy that we have created.
The Horizon is a feigning line of imaginaion, where we can no longer see the reality 
of our own world. . 

No idle sage in wakeful dreams
Or medicine man in tribal lands
hath pinned his words to uncaring ears
of deranged misfits or merry men bands

no wisdom sparkles
from buffed and burnished stone
nor sky be lit, or in
all engulfing nights shown

they naively seek heaven, in
matted hair around oozed glue
finger, wads’ ecstatic buzz, as
dominoes fall white black and blue

with machetes hack, maim
left writhing, bake in pools red
condors’ waste plaster white
where they grazed, dropped dead

once ranged over pearly earth
now in pockets far and few
Viet and Asian men may gloat
fancy nails, that the world just threw

Callous mix of black and white
spells pain and death of horn’s strife
no booming resolutions shall ever stay
plunged in Africa’s heart the knife

Wealthy I am! Can wager on vices
Eager they’re too to take me zenith
Avarice-whisky, anger-cigarettes and
Lust-harlots lined up to keep me afloat
Through pseudo-pleasures of life
Hornpipes somewhere inside hoot cautions
"Yards nigh you’re to Judgment day"Deep night blows sign of danger, 
Few are in alert, rest are in dark.
Joy is abandoned in whisper of air, 
No morning dew has to come soon.

Deep night will fight with light, 
Vices bring danger, joy trembles.
War breaks humanity, love goes far.
Carelessness results conflicts.

In a steady look we see and feel, 
We need harmony, love and peace.
Even in walking in horrendous path
There is no need to fear to cross.

Violating rules of nature is so sad, 
Pollution breaks trust and movement.
You surrender and accept wisdom soon. 




Reflected Horror

From that sky, bizarre and livid, 
Distorted as your destiny, 
What thoughts into your empty soul 
Descend? Answer me, libertine.

— Insatiably avid 
For the dark and the uncertain, 
I shall not whimper like Ovid 
Chased from his Latin paradise.

Skies torn like the shores of the sea,
You are the mirror of my pride;
Your vast clouds in mourning

Are the black hearses of my dreams, 
And your gleams are the reflection 
Of the Hell which delights my heart.



Sympathetic Horror 

From livid skies that, without end, 
As stormy as your future roll, 
What thoughts into your empty soul 
(Answer me, libertine!) descend?

— Insatiable yet for all 
That turns on darkness, doom, or dice, 
I'll not, like Ovid, mourn my fall, 
Chased from the Latin paradise.

Skies, torn like seacoasts by the storm!
In you I see my pride take form,
And the huge clouds that rush in streams

Are the black hearses of my dreams, 
And your red rays reflect the hell, 
In which my heart is pleased to dwell.




Horrible experience

Yes, it was deceptive signal
I failed to notice it on arrival
I was mad in love 
He was to be believed 

I had built many bridges
To cross over and reach
Each end was leading me to him
The lamp at the end was glowing dim

It was giving me warmth
And safety with each count of breathe 
Till that time I was under magical spell
Thereafter nothing going to be well 

I was to be left alone
In desert to face cyclone
It was to be horrible experience
The life was to be torn apart at once


It is condemned as horrified tale  
The position constantly abused by male 
Simple story of domination and torture of female
I fail to understand and face turns pale 

What has happened to woman folk? 
Why same story is repeated to talk? 
Each time we come across when walk? 
Emerges out of ignorance as they reveal and soak

How can one say she was influenced? 
By sweet talks and personality she got induced
When time came for honor to be reduced? 
All ideas rush and state of mind gets confused

No soul may fall for easy pray
As no human being likes complete sway
She has third sense to alert the mind
If danger is around and likely to be found

You may speak with low voice
But had submitted with no noise
Whatever may be the strength of powerful man! 
No one on earth can subdue a woman

Women today are educated and self reliant
They face bravely and can't act as humble client
Everything moves on with agreed formula and terms
But something unusual too happens in turn 

There remains one thing to be seen
Rape cases do happen and always scene
Sometimes it is forced one and sometimes agreed one
But rape as such can't be denied by anyone 

Male and female are two sides of the coin
Both are at opposite pole and constantly remain
Some attraction takes place and stage is set
Either of the party likes it and it is willingly let

I hear about atrocities against woman
Sometime I feel against and consider it as inhuman
But certain things can't be taken off the list
More one denies and less other insist

I feel pinch of salt and feel depression
Such things can be termed as naked aggression
A clever ploy employed against woman and her wish
Not at all admirable gesture to talk of and finish


Horrifying deaths 

Make no secret
And let
Your outburst be made open
You want to live on earth and not in heaven

To pass through
An ordeal of poor
And neighbors

Nobody was to disturb
And insult
Anyone under pretext
It was humanitarian test

What are we trying? 
And denying
With framing of lies on head

How can you kill children? 
From parents even
What have they witnessed on earthy? 
Except horrifying deaths


The darkest hour of my life
Was the spring’s hottest night
When I watched a dream in excite
That dream in my memory is still bright 
I was on a constructive site
It was full of glooming and sparkling light
The stars on the sky were glowing
The harsh wind was also blowing 
Someone called up my name
I to myself ran to find any place
After running I saw a height
Where people were in anger and fight
Seeing this I felt my breathe tight
And exactly at the corner of my right
There was black cat’s; staring eye
Looking deep, behind my sight
I felt like it was saying me something to write
She came near to me and get ready to bite
I closed my eyes, a soft hand touched me
I shouted and sudden woke up
Mom was near to me holding my hand
Saying "Dear it was nothing, just a dream"Ploughing paddy fields
Irrigating fertile lands
Moisture laden
Planting saplings
Sowing seeds
Scattering here and there
Greeny everywhere
Working on
Sunrise through sunset
Ready to be home
Eager to earn well rest
All at home
Waiting in patience
Though night returned
He never returned
Anxious family men
Went in search
Looking near and far
Not to say
Terrible to see him
In pieces
Here and there
Torn and mutilated
Hunted by a leopard
Turned man eating cannibal
What to say? 
Everyone prayed
Let things be fine
By driving the beast
To disappear into wild

What does the horse give you
That I cannot give you?

I watch you when you are alone,
When you ride into the field behind the dairy,
Your hands buried in the mare's
Dark mane.

Then I know what lies behind your silence:
Scorn, hatred of me, of marriage. Still,
You want me to touch you; you cry out
As brides cry, but when I look at you I see
There are no children in your body.
Then what is there?

Nothing, I think. Only haste
To die before I die.

In a dream, I watched you ride the horse
Over the dry fields and then
Dismount: you two walked together;
In the dark, you had no shadows.
But I felt them coming toward me
Since at night they go anywhere,
They are their own masters.

Look at me. You think I don't understand?
What is the animal
If not passage out of this life

The prairie blows the grasses
And whips the horse’s mane.
They travel, horse and rider, 
Through the sea of amber grain
 
Hills roll by, and clouds pass
But steady are the horse’s hooves
Upon the wind blown grass
As they travel, horse and rider

There is no trail that they follow
No path that can be seen
There they travel, horse and rider
Upon the endless blowing green


FIRST I would like to write for you a poem to be shouted in the teeth of a strong wind.
Next I would like to write one for you to sit on a hill and read down the river valley on a late summer afternoon, reading it in less than a whisper to Jack on his soft wire legs learning to stand up and preach, Jack-in-the-pulpit.
As many poems as I have written to the moon and the streaming of the moon spinners of light, so many of the summer moon and the winter moon I would like to shoot along to your ears for nothing, for a laugh, a song,
  for nothing at all,
  for one look from you,
  for your face turned away
  and your voice in one clutch
  half way between a tree wind moan
  and a night-bird sob.
Believe nothing of it all, pay me nothing, open your window for the other singers and keep it shut for me.
The road I am on is a long road and I can go hungry again like I have gone hungry before.
What else have I done nearly all my life than go hungry and go on singing?
Leave me with the hoot owl.
I have slept in a blanket listening.
He learned it, he must have learned it
From two moons, the summer moon,
And the winter moon
And the streaming of the moon spinners of light. 

Horse drinking water
From a barrel in the field
Swishing flies with tail


I was riding my horse one day
When he suddenly stopped in the Way
Along came a car
My horse went far
Really far, far away


Those lumbering horses in the steady plough,
On the bare field - I wonder, why, just now,
They seemed terrible, so wild and strange,
Like magic power on the stony grange.

Perhaps some childish hour has come again,
When I watched fearful, through the blackening rain,
Their hooves like pistons in an ancient mill
Move up and down, yet seem as standing still.

Their conquering hooves which trod the stubble down
Were ritual that turned the field to brown,
And their great hulks were seraphims of gold,
Or mute ecstatic monsters on the mould.

And oh the rapture, when, one furrow done,
They marched broad-breasted to the sinking sun!
The light flowed off their bossy sides in flakes;
The furrows rolled behind like struggling snakes.

But when at dusk with steaming nostrils home
They came, they seemed gigantic in the gloam,
And warm and glowing with mysterious fire
That lit their smouldering bodies in the mire.

Their eyes as brilliant and as wide as night
Gleamed with a cruel apocalyptic light,
Their manes the leaping ire of the wind
Lifted with rage invisible and blind.

Ah, now it fades! It fades! And I must pine
Again for the dread country crystalline,
Where the blank field and the still-standing tree
Were bright and fearful presences to me. 

Pounding hooves, flying manes
Thundering feet, over music strains
A rushing wind, a darkening sky
Horse rush, sending dust rising high

A flash of color, black and white
A crash of bodies, horses in the night
Lightening flashes, thunder rumbles
Across the open prairie, grasses tumble

Past trees, over and through brush
Over rising hills, past plains they rush
Thundering feet, above the music strains
Pounding hooves and flying manes


Let us sit by a hissing steam radiator a winter's day, gray wind pattering frozen raindrops on the window, 
And let us talk about milk wagon drivers and grocery delivery boys. 

Let us keep our feet in wool slippers and mix hot punches--and talk about mail carriers and 
messenger boys slipping along the icy sidewalks. 
Let us write of olden, golden days and hunters of the 
Holy Grail and men called "knights" riding horses in the rain, in the cold frozen rain for ladies they loved. 

A roustabout hunched on a coal wagon goes by, icicles drip on his hat rim, sheets of ice wrapping 
the hunks of coal, the caravanserai a gray blur in slant of rain. 
Let us nudge the steam radiator with our wool slippers and write poems of Launcelot, the hero, and 
Roland, the hero, and all the olden golden men who rode horses in the rain. 

Our heart wanders lost in the dark woods.
Our dream wrestles in the castle of doubt.
But there's music in us. Hope is pushed down
but the angel flies up again taking us with her.
The summer mornings begin inch by inch
while we sleep, and walk with us later
as long-legged beauty through
the dirty streets. It is no surprise 
that danger and suffering surround us.
What astonishes is the singing.
We know the horses are there in the dark
meadow because we can smell them,
can hear them breathing. 
Our spirit persists like a man struggling 
through the frozen valley
who suddenly smells flowers
and realizes the snow is melting
out of sight on top of the mountain,
knows that spring has begun. 

What makes things flower
more than go green? 

Ashes



Hospital! 
The temple of healing
and acquiring a healthy life
with so many Doctors and Nurses
nurturing the life
to fasten the pace of life
where a life is reborn
denying the frivolous death
which is unconqured
but with the help of Doctors and Nurses
life conquers the death.

Hospital is a temple
where every one gets life.

Who makes it filthy
is ever sinner in life. 

Budging the sluggard ripples of the Somme,
A barge round old Cerisy slowly slewed.
Softly her engines down the current screwed,
And chuckled softly with contented hum,
Till fairy tinklings struck their croonings dumb.
The waters rumpling at the stern subdued;
The lock-gate took her bulging amplitude;
Gently from out the gurgling lock she swum.

One reading by that calm bank shaded eyes
To watch her lessening westward quietly.
Then, as she neared the bend, her funnel screamed.
And that long lamentation made him wise
How unto Avalon, in agony,
Kings passed in the dark barge, which Merlin dreamed.

Hospitals are to cure you of your diseases.
The aches, the pains and such kinds
They are to relieve you of concerns 
about you, your family kith and kin 


Hospitals are here to cure you from money
the time, happiness, joy and care
they relieve you of humanity concerns
about the doctor, nurses and the attendants


The hospitals provide food
and cure your appetite for good
The food is little and very bland
or it is still little and very spicy

The rooms are but railway bogies small, 
narrow and without privacy
The convenience is little and small
but is sure to cost you a fortune


You earn in your healthy days
and save for the rainy day
Your saving is completely empty
if you go to the hospital even for a day


Many tests are done after many pricks
keeping you in the hospital for days to weeks 
Diagnose they don't for many days
you'll go back home without any improvement

At gauzy dusk, thin haze like cigarette smoke 
ribbons past Chrysler Building's silver fins 
tapering delicately needletopped, Empire State's 
taller antenna filmed milky lit amid blocks 
black and white apartmenting veil'd sky over Manhattan, 
offices new built dark glassed in blueish heaven--The East 
s & s covered with castles & watertowers, seven storied 
tar-topped house-banks over York Avenue, late may-green trees 
surrounding Rockefellers' blue domed medical arbor-- 
Geodesic science at the waters edge--Cars running up 
East River Drive, & parked at N. 

Y. Hospital's oval door 
where perfect tulips flower the health of a thousand sick souls 
trembling inside hospital rooms. Triboro bridge steel-spiked 
penthouse orange roofs, sunset tinges the river and in a few 
Bronx windows, some magnesium vapor brilliances're 
spotted five floors above E h St under grey painted bridge 
trestles. Way downstream along the river, as Monet saw Thames 
years ago, Con Edison smokestacks h street, 
& Brooklyn Bridge's skeined dim in modern mists-- 
Pipes sticking up to sky nine smokestacks huge visible-- 
U. 

N. Building hangs under an orange crane, & red lights on 
vertical avenues below the trees turn green at the nod 
of a skull with a mild nerve ache. Dim dharma, I return 
to this spectacle after weeks of poisoned lassitude, my thighs 
belly chest & arms covered with poxied welts, 
head pains fading back of the neck, right eyebrow cheek 
mouth paralyzed--from taking the wrong medicine, sweated 
too much in the forehead helpless, covered my rage from 
gorge to prostate with grinding jaw and tightening anus 
not released the weeping scream of horror at robot Mayaguez 
World self ton billions metal grief unloaded 
Pnom Penh to Nakon Thanom, Santiago & Tehran. 
Fresh warm breeze in the window, day's release 
>from pain, cars float downside the bridge trestle 
and uncounted building-wall windows multiplied a mile 
deep into ash-delicate sky beguile 
my empty mind. A seagull passes alone wings 
spread silent over roofs. 

A few gourd leaves that waved about
Cut down and boiled;--the feast how spare!
But the good host his spirits takes,
Pours out a cup, and proves them rare.

A single rabbit on the mat,
Or baked, or roast:--how small the feast!
But the good host his spirits takes,
And fills the cup of every guest.

A single rabbit on the mat,
Roasted or broiled:--how poor the meal!
But the guests from the spirit vase
Fill their host's cup, and drink his weal.

A single rabbit on the mat,
Roasted or baked:--no feast we think!
But from the spirit vase they take,
Both host and guests, and joyous drink. 

Sharing with people
In need is the practice of
Hospitality


Hospitality and style

Like her many people
Who is part of struggle? 
For freedom and liberty 
I wish them success frogman almighty

She is gracious
But not famous
She will on one day
The star in sky any way

What makes her special? 
Facial expression
Or good and kind smile
Really it is African hospitality and style 

Her black color reminds me of plight
That might have gone not right 
Her smile disapproves of everything
As her smile adds sun's shining

There may be many more mullions
Who might have suffered rebellion? 
Undergone heavy casualty and destruction
But it is lifeline for any nation



HOSTAGE DILEMMA
 

Hostage taker of a bloody massacre 
of Visiting nationals is a stupid culprit 
of a crime to express his great anger 
against his dismissal is out of mind and wit. 

Over and over again, I firmly condemn 
such act of a man even he is a fellowmen 
for it's against law and decency's helm 
it's against life, honor and dignity of men. 

Such is a heinous crime of satanic tendency 
in airing grievances at the expense of many 
tarnished the great honor and dignity 
of the Filipinos as a nation of great hospitality. 

Taking a life of a brother of no mercy 
Is beyond reason of morale decency 
hence, it must be condemn by all humanity 
even he is a kin or a part of our community. 

An act of prudence, understanding and mercy, 
 Is my personal  appeal to the victim's family, 
to the affected Nationals for their decency 
Not to retaliate against our brothers in their country. 

and give upon them forgiveness of their sins 
and to their families, peace, love and freedom. 

Everybody knows this is an isolated act 
Not sanction at all or like by the Filipinos 
Who are known to be peace loving product 
of co-existence with other nations across.

she was hot, she was so hot
I didn't want anybody else to have her,
and if I didn't get home on time
she'd be gone, and I couldn't bear that-
I'd go mad. 
it was foolish I know, childish,
but I was caught in it, I was caught.
I delivered all the mail
and then Henderson put me on the night pickup run
in an old army truck,
the damn thing began to heat halfway through the run
and the night went on
me thinking about my hot Miriam
and jumping in and out of the truck
filling mailsacks
the engine continuing to heat up
the temperature needle was at the top
HOT HOT
like Miriam.
leaped in and out
more pickups and into the station
I'd be, my car
waiting to get me to Miriam who sat on my blue couch
with scotch on the rocks
crossing her legs and swinging her ankles
like she did,
more stops. 
the truck stalled at a traffic light, it was hell
kicking it over
again. 
I had to be home by was the deadline for Miriam.
I made the last pickup and the truck stalled at a signal
block from the station. 
it wouldn't start, it couldn't start. 
I locked the doors, pulled the key and ran down to the 
station. 
I threw the keys down.  

signed out. 
your goddamned truck is stalled at the signal,
I shouted,
Pico and Western. 
.  

I ran down the hall,put the key into the door,
opened it.  

her drinking glass was there, and a note: 

  sun of a bitch:
  I waited until after ate
  you don't love me
  you sun of a bitch
  somebody will love me
  I been wateing all day
 
 

I poured a drink and let the water run into the tub
there were bars in town
and I'd make of them
looking for Miriam
her purple teddy bear held the note
as he leaned against a pillow
I gave the bear a drink, myself a drink
and got into the hot
water. 

The atmosphere was explosive. 
While the heat just bathed our skin--
Sauna beads of sweat covered us. 
As we were carried off within; 
Ravaged by sensualities ways. 
Enamored in deep deep kiss. 
Carried beyond the rapture--
Captured-one another in total bliss; 
The very nature of loves haves and have nots. 
Seem to shake our entire core. 
Knowing without a single word--
That we'd be back for much more; 

Walking out the door of passions play. 
Did not come easy for me---
But the memory was forever imprinted. 
With the knowledge that we were meant to be; 
Soon-oh so very soon-we'll return--
Without even a moments thought---
And wrap ourselves once again in love. 
Working ourselves once again into 'Hot'; 


The Essence
August, saw a hot air balloon flying over my house: 
Most of the time, it was as quiet as a mouse, 
But, every so often, its burners suddenly roared, 
And higher, up into the sky, it suddenly soared.

My excitement, I found hard to keep at bay, 
As, a hot air balloon, you don't see every day.
A passenger balloon floating through the air, 
For me, is so special, as the sight is so rare.

The sight of the balloon, filled me with delight, 
And I stood watching it, until it flew out of sight.
My eyes were stuck to the balloon, just like glue, 
As it floated across a sky of cornflower blue.

I wonder what it's like to float through the sky, 
Watching the world down below gliding on by.
I've always wanted to ride in a hot air balloon: 
I hope I will one day, and I hope that it's soon. 

A woman who my mother knows
Came in and took off all her clothes.

Said I, not being very old,
'By golly gosh, you must be cold!'

'No, no!' she cried. 'Indeed I'm not!
I'm feeling devilishly hot!


'Hot digitty dog! Now, ain't it queer,
I've been abroad for over a year;
Seen a helluva lot since then,
Killed, I reckon, a dozen men;
Six was doubtful, but six was sure,
Three in Normandy, three in the Ruhr.
Four I got with a hand grenade,
Two I shot in a midnight raid:
Oh, I ain't sorry, except perhaps
To think that my jerries wasn't japs.

Hot digitty dog! Now ain't it tough;
I oughta be handed hero stuff -
Bands and banquets, and flags and flowers,
Speeches, peaches, confetti showers;
"Welcome back to the old home town,
Colour Sargent Josephus Brown.
Fought like a tiger, one of our best,
Medals and ribands on his chest.
cheers for a warrior, fresh from the fight . . 

"
Sure I'd 'a got 'em - - had I been white.

Hot digitty dog! It's jist too bad,
Gittin' home an' nobody gald;
Sneakin' into the Owl Drug Store
Nobody knowin' me any more;
Admirin' my uniform fine and fit -
Say, I've certainly changed a bit
From the lanky lad who used to croon
To a battered banjo in Shay's Saloon;
From the no-good nigger who runned away
After stickin' his knife into ol' man Shay.

They's a lynched me, for he was white,
But he raped my sister one Sunday night;
So I did what a proper man should do,
And I sunk his body deep in the slough.
Oh, he taunted me to my dark disgrace,
Called me a nigger, spat in my face;
So I buried my jack-knife in his heart,
Laughin' to see the hot blood start;
Laughin' still, though it's long ago,
And nobody's ever a-gonna know.

Nobody's ever a-gonna tell
How Ol' Man Shay went straight to hell;
nobody's gonna make me confess -
And what is a killin' more or less.
I've slain a dozen, and each was white,
And none of 'em ever did me no harm,
And my conscience is clear - I've no alarm;
So I'll go where I sank Ol' Man Shay in the bog,
And spit in the water . . . Hot digitty dog!


'That girls hot! '
Hmmm, sounds like the kind of woman, 
you'd get burned with! 


Come on! I’m in a kiln
Burning is my bare skin! "
Further whines and complains
"Don’t you have compassion? 
For a suffering fellow-man"

A Wiseman explains, "Well! 
That’s your hand-made hearth
Smouldering in it are fuels
Raw, rough and cruel charcoals
You dug out from darkest
Corners of your heart and
Piled out around in your life
Lust, greed and great anger
Envy, passion and dirty conceit
All ensembled to blaze hellfires
In your hollow mind furnace
To pull you out: there’s none
A friend can wipe your tears
As an act of mere solace
Can give you only strength
To endure this scorching pain
To pull you out there’s none! ! 

The man in woebegone kiln
Shouts again "What’s the solution? "
 Wiseman smiled and advised
"It’s simple my dear friend
Stand up and just walk out"

When hot it is good
But, O' Coffee upon kiss
You just burnt my lips


There is someone I like who's
in h grade
he's cute he's hott
he never cocks off
his personality is stupid smart 
and dumb
but he is still my little sugar plum
he has the cutest name 
I could blow up and go to heaven 
whenever I hear his name
when I see him I practically faint
to my perfect place
where he is
he likes another girl not me
that breaks my heart
I try really hard to impress him 
but like he gives a crap how I look
he has an adorable smile
it makes me laugh
when he talks to me
I want to faint
he does drugs (I think)   
but I dont care
he is still my perfect boy
he wears the cutest clothes that are
baggy on him
it shows his boxers 
but it's all good. 

Ahhh summer, 
when the nights are hot
and love is even hotter.

There are memories 
of a summer like that
down in the Florida Keys, 
a whole block of time I call 
the loving days, 

racing our jet skis with the wind
to the outer islands for shells, 
then docking at a tiki bar
for buffalo wings and
icy Coronas with lime.

But it was the nights.  
I miss the nights the most, 
when the perspiration was there
before the passion even began, 
and the only thing that cooled after 
was a dip in the emerald Gulf
and maybe a frozen marguerita, or two, 

and overhead in the night sky, 
heaven’s own stars shimmied 
like diamonds strip-dancing 
on the surface of the water.

Hot summer nights 
in the loving days, 
when the nights were hot 
but love was even hotter. 

I was in a big city and got
a hotdog from a street vendor
It tasted so damn good
Ketchup, onions, chili and cheddar

As I walked home with a smile
My stomach started to dance
I didn't make it five blocks
Before that hotdog was in my pants


BEWARE of Street Vendor

Do not use elevators

Hotels pillows, I find
Are meticulously designed
To carefully keep
You from your sleep

A pillow that is guaranteed
To always succeed
In making your neck sore
And your ear hurt galore

The best pillow they offer
Is the one in the sauna
So you can just relax
Your head on its wooden slats

That's why I've decided
Not to try and fight it
And now wherever I go
I take along my own pillow


The hound dog is 
going to work
he is going to work
he is out there
running in the woods
he is going to work
he is going to work
he is ready
he is going to work
going to work
he is out there
he is going to work
going to work
he's the hound dog


And were the last to choose the settled ground,
Its boredom of the desk or of the spade, because
So many years companioned by a hound,
Our voices carry; and though slumber-bound,
Some few half wake and half renew their choice,
Give tongue, proclaim their hidden name -- 'Hound Voice.'

The women that I picked spoke sweet and low
And yet gave tongue.  'Hound Voices' were they all.
We picked each other from afar and knew
What hour of terror comes to test the soul,
And in that terror's name obeyed the call,
And understood, what none have understood,
Those images that waken in the blood.
Some day we shall get up before the dawn
And find our ancient hounds before the door,
And wide awake know that the hunt is on;
Stumbling upon the blood-dark track once more,
Then stumbling to the kill beside the shore;
Then cleaning out and bandaging of wounds,
And chant




S of victory amid the encircling hounds. 

There is music on disc and on wireless, 
Band-music, dance-tunes for the tireless, 
Sweet music from day unto day; 
But the music a man will remember 
Shakes down the last leaves of November, 
And speeds the wild geese in December, 
And greets the first oak-bud in May.
What string with such beauty can tremble? 
What bugle such raptures assemble? 
What trumpet can sound such a call? 
Is there ever a melody nearer 
The quick-beating heart of the hearer? 
Is there ever a tune that is dearer 
As it chooses a dance for us all? 
No song is so sweet in the setting, 
No lilt so forbids all forgetting 
Or lingers so long by the way; 
When the shadows of night gather o’er us, 
And the scarlet has faded before us, 
The ring of that ravishing chorus 
Dies not with the death of the day. 




Lovers no longer in harmony.

Disagreements put out the fire.

Understanding had flown far faraway, 

Repressing their youthful desire.

Sadly, romance was over. 

Absence of love darkened their eyes.

The hour of hopelessness threatened

And goodbye came as no surprise. 



the cell door slams shut! 
staring through the barred window,

flying just over the treetops

can feel the sunlight turning
the wheel, as seasons change.
can hear the big trucks
out on the interstate. 

lying back on his bunk, 
he closes his eyes
can feel his spirit leaving
his beaten body behind

turning back time, and years, 
and most of all, choices
back before the cars, the whores, 
the dope, the money, and the guns



he can see his mother
washing clothes in the sink.

can hear her reading her Bible

can see the hope drenched walls
that poverty closed them in with
and the keys.  the books, the faith,

lone crow flying into the distance, 
smaller and smaller, almost gone.
the part of him so real he'd forgotten, 
lost to the hammer and chains

and a house made of stone

Shall I mount to a hope-hill 
And draw my love with a bill.
Worm-eaten words of rude mouth- 
Will wound no more my life path.
From thy high and wide skies 
To my lonely heart and my eyes
To cover the miles of dark night.
Anf I befriend with thy stars
To forget my tears.



Love sickness, 
And the depths thereof is an endless vault
A vacuum feeding on the crumbs of existence

Wherein my heart is a hidden chamber, 
And the more pain and suffering I have 
The more rooms I create 

To keep pain out of sight, 
Suffering below the surface
Until I’m in a labyrinth of doors
A kaleidoscope of cages, 

In a mansion, 
Alone in a lobby in horrific amazement
A million and one rooms
I dare not enter




Oh, to ensconce in a house of the absurd, 
airy steads so owned by those recherche 
that open their nostrils so people like we-
can see straight thru' their hollow skulls, 
and muse about how they all sleep at night, 
observing fine lines on their bedroom ceilings
imbrued by the maize of stale nicotine; 

strange folk, I've heard of some tell-tales
of Menage à trois by their own DNA, 
and so curious me at such hideous practice, 
so abhorrent, yet the mind owns my queries, 
along with Curiosity, my semi-Persian cat; 
not so strange as I think it more blasphemous, 
and I know I want nothing to do with the likes-
of them all, and their effete behavior; 

it's no wonder common folk upon seeing them
walking down Main Streets narrow sidewalk, 
option to cross in between the crossing paths 
and walk home on the other side of the street.
I wonder if within their bizarre persuasions
have they ever considered their reputations; 
Foolish, me, as such cultishness be blind, 
Oh, but still to be a fly on their ceiling, 
or perhaps just a fine line in shadow, 
to see if I see what they see, 
every night in their house of absurdity, 



Indoors the tang of a tiny oil lamp. Outdoors
The winking signal on the waste of sea.
Indoors the sound of the wind. Outdoors the wind.
Indoors the locked heart and the lost key.


Outdoors the chill, the void, the siren. Indoors
The strong man pained to find his red blood cools,
While the blind clock grows louder, faster. Outdoors
The silent moon, the garrulous tides she rules.


Indoors ancestral curse-cum-blessing. Outdoors
The empty bowl of heaven, the empty deep.
Indoors a purposeful man who talks at cross
Purposes, to himself, in a broken sleep. 

These little window dwellers, in cottages and halls, were always
entertaining to me; after dancing in the window all day from sunrise
to sunset they would sip of the tea, drink of the beer, and eat of the
sugar, and be welcome all summer long. They look like things of mind
or fairies, and seem pleased or dull as the weather permits. In many
clean cottages and genteel houses, they are allowed every liberty to
creep, fly, or do as they like; and seldom or ever do wrong. In fact
they are the small or dwarfish portion of our own family, and so many
fairy familiars that we know and treat as one of ourselves. 

Exceeding tall, but built so well his height
Half-disappears in flow of chest and limb;
Moustache and whisker trooper-like in trim;
Frank-faced, frank-eyed, frank-hearted; always bright
And always punctual-morning, noon, and night;
Bland as a Jesuit, sober as a hymn;
Humorous, and yet without a touch of whim;
Gentle and amiable, yet full of fight.
His piety, though fresh and true in strain,
Has not yet whitewashed up his common mood
To the dead blank of his particular Schism.
Sweet, unaggressive, tolerant, most humane,
Wild artists like his kindly elderhood,
And cultivate his mild Philistinism. 


A mason came forth and said, "Speak to us of Houses
 


And he answered and said: 

Build of your imaginings a bower in the wilderness ere you build a house within the city walls. 

For even as you have home-comings in your twilight, so has the wanderer in you, the ever distant and alone. 

Your house is your larger body. 

It grows in the sun and sleeps in the stillness of the night; and it is not dreamless. 

Does not your house dream? And dreaming, leave the city for grove or hilltop? 

Would that I could gather your houses into my hand, and like a sower scatter them in forest and meadow. 

Would the valleys were your streets, and the green paths your alleys, that you might seek one another through vineyards, and come with the fragrance of the earth in your garments. 

But these things are not yet to be. 

In their fear your forefathers gathered you too near together. And that fear shall endure a little longer. A little longer shall your city walls separate your hearths from your fields. 

And tell me, people of Orphalese, what have you in these houses? And what is it you guard with fastened doors? 

Have you peace, the quiet urge that reveals your power? 

Have you remembrances, the glimmering arches that span the summits of the mind? 

Have you beauty, that leads the heart from things fashioned of wood and stone to the holy mountain? 

Tell me, have you these in your houses? 

Or have you only comfort, and the lust for comfort, that stealthy thing that enters the house a guest, and becomes a host, and then a master? 

Ay, and it becomes a tamer, and with hook and scourge makes puppets of your larger desires. 

Though its hands are silken, its heart is of iron. 

It lulls you to sleep only to stand by your bed and jeer at the dignity of the flesh. 

It makes mock of your sound senses, and lays them in thistledown like fragile vessels. 

Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul, and then walks grinning in the funeral. 

But you, children of space, you restless in rest, you shall not be trapped nor tamed. 

Your house shall be not an anchor but a mast. 

It shall not be a glistening film that covers a wound, but an eyelid that guards the eye. 

You shall not fold your wings that you may pass through doors, nor bend your heads that they strike not against a ceiling, nor fear to breathe lest walls should crack and fall down. 

You shall not dwell in tombs made by the dead for the living. 

And though of magnificence and splendour, your house shall not hold your secret nor shelter your longing. 

For that which is boundless in you abides in the mansion of the sky, whose door is the morning mist, and whose windows are the songs and the silences of night


"Houses"—so the Wise Men tell me—
"Mansions"! Mansions must be warm!
Mansions cannot let the tears in,
Mansions must exclude the storm!

"Many Mansions," by "his Father,"
I don't know him; snugly built!
Could the Children find the way there—
Some, would even trudge tonight

You took my empty dreams
 And filled them every one
With tenderness and nobleness,
 April and the sun.

The old empty dreams
 Where my thoughts would throng
Are far too full of happiness
 To even hold a song.

Oh, the empty dreams were dim
 And the empty dreams were wide,
They were sweet and shadowy houses
 Where my thoughts could hide.

But you took my dreams away
 And you made them all come true - 
My thoughts have no place now to play,
 And nothing now to do

"Houses"—so the Wise Men tell me—
"Mansions"! Mansions must be warm!
Mansions cannot let the tears in,
Mansions must exclude the storm!

Could the Children find the way there—
Some, would even trudge tonight

at the door waiting
to decide whether to step
out and melt away

or close the door quick
and breath stale airconditioned
coolness while alive



com (How could I be so wrong? 
How could wrong feel so right? 
How could I not see what was hiding? 
So easily in plain sight? 

Trouble is what you were
I dont know how I didn't see
I guess my eyes made you
More that you could ever be

Part of me knew from the beginning
But part of me didn't care
I knew his world burned to bright for me
But I was convinced what we had 
Was special and rare

How could I be so foolish
To think that this would last? 
I knew you were trouble
But part of me liked that

How could I not listen
To the voice inside my head? 
Because my heart had made of its mind
To ignore everything that voice said


I've not been beaten up today, 
but still I don't always get my way.
No ice cream, today, have I had, 
'cause I've not been good, but BAD! 

I only tied one shoe today; 
'cause I was in a hurry to play.
Also I did not brush each tooth.
These are the facts



the truth. 

How an ordinary man can steer the course? 
Of a mighty nation crumbled under its own weight of course
Relentless struggle with no support from people
Yet so much zeal and enthusiasm and capable

How difficult and dangerous is half won struggle? 
How dangerous is it to interpret the law of jungles? 
Where each individual animal is in search of easy pry
When find the field is open then why not to try? 

Country can go to dogs if not nurtured
Not imparted rights and duties and ignorantly ventured
Who else can shed the blood for country’s in dependence? 
And yet very much linked to each other for dependence

Anna Hazare showed the way to harness people’s energy
It was neither funded by any group or helped with money
It was self emancipation of like minded people with resolve
Stick on the roads if not tried earnestly for problems to solve

Only people are supreme in nation’s voice
People choose the representatives to work on promises
Rules and regulations are for smooth functioning
Not to subvert it for self interest and undermining

What does the constitution guarantee to its people? 
Administration free from fear, strong and capable
Independent judiciary to uphold the basic rights
Where does the question arise leading to fights! 

Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If things are not pursued positively
Rulers have to draw strength from the source
That can’t come away by manipulating force

Parliament or anybody can be called holy home
Members or representatives are always welcome
They are our sign of hopes and guardians
Why are we put to shame to call them as custodians? 

Take for granted if population rises in revolt
Demands better facilities and control over faults
Things must be takes as possible eruption of volcano
They will be forced out and this they must know

If crowd remain silent with no provocation
It is nice, good and healthy indication 
We have lost no love or turned enemy in relation
But today it is the answer we are searching in question


'How are you and where are you? ' 
Would you mind if I so ask you? 
Urge ran high so I asked you, 
Do you think it right if I so ask you? 

You were so nice and dear, 
You are far away as I hear, 
Pain is so high but I bear, 
Find no means to stay just near, 

Did I so offend? 
lived so simple and ways also mend, 
flowers and roses found its way, 
I still found no other say, 

You declined for a photo, 
Even I had no such motto, 
Still asked for a flicker, 
But alas! you proved tinker, 

Had it not been the business? 
and love a commodity, 
Had I not a been gentle man? 
and you be a businesswoman 

It would have been a reality, 
A mere necessaisity and not the quality, 
Be that not even turn farce, 
Be that not rude but always be nice 

Found in you always a treasure, 
Enjoyment more but never a measure, 
safety and securiy always I assure, 
But you buckled under so pressure, 

Was it a right path? I don't know, 
In a prayer always I bow, 
Still a mystery and no reason how, 
It can be any but not sacrad cow, 

You may stay calm and cool, 
All will be fine and I only fool, 
continue to stare but find no glare, 
blaze from within but take no care


I am a mother of four children 
One out of four gives me lots of pain 
At ease when I am at home 
She comes at my door and asks 
How is your work? 

In the morning before I get up
She brings a dream 
After  disturbing  my sound sleep
With a tired voice she asks 
How are you doing?  

When I should remain awake 
And do my job sincerely 
She crawls into my work and asks  
How is your home? 

With my soul I sit and relax 
But before I enjoy my moment 
Miles away she calls me up and asks 
How is your life?



'How pleasant is the color of tea, 
In the morning, 
In open weather! 
How nice is the weather! 
How pretty is the boy! 
How pleasant is the tea

How beautiful the Earth is still 
To thee–how full of Happiness; 
How little fraught with real ill 
Or shadowy phantoms of distress;
How Spring can bring thee glory yet 
And Summer win thee to forget 
December's sullen time! 
Why dost thou hold the treasure fast 
Of youth's delight, when youth is past 
And thou art near thy prime?

When those who were thy own compeers, 
Equal in fortunes and in years, 
Have seen their morning melt in tears,
To dull unlovely day; 
Blest, had they died unproved and young 
Before their hearts were wildly wrung, 
Poor slaves, subdued by passions strong, 
A weak and helpless prey!

'Because, I hoped while they enjoyed, 
And by fulfilment, hope destroyed 
As children hope, with trustful breast, 
I waited Bliss and cherished Rest.

'A thoughtful Spirit taught me soon 
That we must long till life be done; 
That every phase of earthly joy 
Will always fade and always cloy--

'This I foresaw, and would not chase 
The fleeting treacheries, 
But with firm foot and tranquil face 
Held backward from the tempting race, 
Gazed o'er the sands the waves efface 
To the enduring seas–

'There cast my anchor of Desire 
Deep in unknown Eternity; 
Nor ever let my Spirit tire 
With looking for What is to be.

'It is Hope's spell that glorifies 
Like youth to my maturer eyes 
All Nature's million mysteries-- 
The fearful and the fair–

'Hope soothes me in the griefs I know, 
She lulls my pain for others' woe 
And makes me strong to undergo 
What I am born to bear. 
'Glad comforter, will I not brave 
Unawed the darkness of the grave? 
Nay, smile to hear Death's billows rave, 
My Guide, sustained by thee?

The more unjust seems present fate 
The more my Spirit springs elate 
Strong in thy strength, to anticipate 
Rewarding Destiny!







Once fired from gun
The bullet has to run
In air and strike the target
It may hit on the sport and direct 

Such is reality in life to shape the fate
Spoken words are like bullets
They may destruct the good relation 
If uttered in disgust with bad intention 

Life is granted to you as token of love 
One must live within and believe
It is precious and has to be preserved
Some of the golden rules are to be observed

If you act carefree and like idiot
You will be encountered and caught 
Each move will be observed and pointed out 
You conduct will be openly talked about 

We know it is open ended
It can never be traded
There is no loss or gain 
It is hard and full of pain

How best we make use? 
Understand its essence and do not confuse
The middle way can be made worth living
It is no use for aimless diving 

So take it in a way you like
Concentrate fully and strike
Something will be yielded
Two joints may remain welded


Words make fresh
When words are flowers
Words define paths
When they are stars
Precious they are
In hopelessness
Words bring life

Words are far
When one wants more
Words are sunset
At some sea shore

When words are stones
Hit so hard
Words do tear
When they are sword
Words create darkness
When they are fear
Words are poison
Beat till death
Drop by drop

Words of people
Flow to my ear
Words are same
The same I hear
How can I know! 
Who is sincere! 

A moment of breath is how much life! 
How many times.  death is coming with a breath inside! 
How can I count! 

How can I forget the charm of your touch
And make your memories out of thy sight
For no matter what I do, I can't do so much
To seal the tomb of the past out of flight.

Whenever I am awake, all my thoughts
Take me back to the time we have light
Candle of the charm of your loving touch
As we sip together a love of first sight.

I never thought  I'm just part of your catch
From the net of your charm so full of might
That from the time I set my eyes to such
My heart beats great love at first sight.

You just made me a token of your past
In your ardent desire to taste my lust
But for me, my love to thee will always last
And be forever glowing and always be just. 

Hey baby, this one is for you.
I need some instruction on what to do.
Anyone can see that you're unwell, 
But how can I help you escape the this hell? 

I know what it's like cuz I've went through it before, 
But how can I get in if you always lock the door? 

It hurts me to see you hurting, 
And I want to find a way to assist.
I've felt like it's my job to help you
Ever since that first time we kissed.

Can you tell me what to do? 
Is there something I can say? 
How can I help you, 
So you no longer feel that way? 

I worry because I love you. 
That will never change.
But I need to go to bed each night
Certain in the morning, 
That you'll always be all right.

Maybe it's the world's fault
That you feel this way.
With everyone's selfish actions, 
And the right things they never say.

Maybe I should stop being just like them, 
And rushing people along.
And rather than saying, 'Hurry it up'
Saying, 'How can I help you? ', or 'What's wrong? 

'Wide as the sky was my heart, 
Where I found a light all above; 
When I devot'd myself for an emerald dove-
Burnig my soul in the furnace of pain apart, 
Where I was hoverin' in dawn and dusk 
To follow you e'erywhere like your shadow, 
Alone; o'er the hill and o'er the meadow; 
With my sunlit eyes that was always brisk.
If, the worst arrows of sorrow you lanced, 
Unto my silent dreams and you danced, 
O'er the bosom of my herat's coral island, 
Pouring the embers of anger in its sand    
As a blooming flower holdin' all its pride, 
Once I waited to embrace you as my bride, 
Or as a breeze to caress you so coyly
But you wounded me so mercilessly, 
Sent my noble dreams in pilgrimage, 
And forsook my heart's hive as sewage. 
Oh! all this way how can I enshrine, 
You as the godess of my heart's shrine, 
To pacify the waves of my heart's brine? 
When many nymphs tempted me to crown-
Them as the godesses' of my soul's palace; 
When many of them wanted to drown, 
In my sea of love to adorn that holy place   
Lo, the Poseidon may be loving the Amphitrite 
But a dead man never be in love with a sprite..>
how many of my actions
.  

are shallow graves, 
for the children, unnamed, 

and unborn

how many of my thoughts
.  

are their tombstones, 
standing, testifying

in the sun

how many of my words
.  

are their epitaphs, 
written with the greed

that feeds the self? 

how many of my days
. . 

at the expense of theirs, 
and how can i not know, 

or care

How can I tell her, for I am lost for words 
That hers is a love so precious and fine 

– a sip of elixir from one so divine 
A moment so precious I want to freeze time. 
That this is a passion I want to embrace 

– as deep as the oceans and as timeless as space. 
My happiness hinged on the smile on her face 
 
How can I convey, for words aren’t enough 
That she holds my heart in the palm of her hand 

– I fear it will leak like fine grains of sand 
Forever dispersing the life we had planned. 
That my love is eternal and always shall last 

– Never diminished by the future or past 
To burn so bright though time so vast 
 
How can I express, what language can’t say 
That you expel darkness and brighten my day 

– keep all the nightmares safely at bay 
Anchor my mind and keep madness away. 
That I am devoted entirely to you 

– in all that I say and all that I do 
My love is pure and totally true. 

How clear she shines! How quietly
I lie beneath her guardian light;
While heaven and earth are whispering me,
" Tomorrow, wake, but, dream to-night

"
Yes, Fancy, come, my Fairy love!
These throbbing temples softly kiss;
And bend my lonely couch above
And bring me rest, and bring me bliss. 

The world is going; dark world, adieu!
Grim world, conceal thee till the day;
The heart, thou canst not all subdue,
Must still resist, if thou delay! 

Thy love I will not, will not share;
Thy hatred only wakes a smile;
Thy griefs may wound - thy wrongs may tear,
But, oh, thy lies shall ne'er beguile!
While gazing on the stars that glow
Above me, in that stormless sea,
I long to hope that all the woe
Creation knows, is held in thee! 

And, this shall be my dream to-night;
I'll think the heaven of glorious spheres
Is rolling on its course of light
In endless bliss, through endless years;
I'll think, there's not one world above,
Far as these straining eyes can see,
Where Wisdom ever laughed at Love,
Or Virtue crouched to Infamy; 

Where, writhing 'neath the strokes of Fate,
The mangled wretch was forced to smile;
To match his patience 'gainst her hate,
His heart rebellious all the while.
Where Pleasure still will lead to wrong,
And helpless Reason warn in vain;
And Truth is weak, and Treachery strong;
And Joy the surest path to Pain;
And Peace, the lethargy of Grief;
And Hope, a phantom of the soul;
And Life, a labour, void and brief;
And Death, the despot of the whole

How could love have done this, 
It brought me so much bliss, 
So many laughs and cheers, 
Making everything nice at the least, 
All was bright and beatiful, 
So much, the inspiration was plentiful, 
Kites seems like angels' winged tools, 
Regret seemed like it's only for a fool, 
Eventhough, it started to change, 
Making me feel so much pain, 
Oh, all my things my tears did stain, 
Very much did happiness turned into pain, 
Everyday, I wish to be with her, 
Doing even simple things together, 
To be able to know her better, 
On things she told me never, 
So many wishes did I make, 
How stupid were my actions awake, 
Overwhelming feeling, it wasn't fake, 
Wondering how long the suffering will take, 
Through all this, I still feel love, 
How could all this come be of love, 
Every little thing has me traped, 
Why would her smiles still bring me back up, 
Oh why is love tearing me apart, 
Right when it had just completed my art, 
Love is so confusing in my part, 
Did the pain relly had to start, 
Have I sinned too much, 
Oh how would I change it back, 
Would I still feel the love, 
I've always dreamed to have, 
For me she is the only one, 
Even if others say I be dumb, 
Even if time that she finds her partner in life, 
Love for her, from me will never change


if you've never known hunger, 
how could you know? 
if you've never been homeless, 
how could you know? 
if you've never been sick, 
and couldnt get medical care, 
how could you know? 

if you've never hid in the night
while the bombs fell around you, 
how could you know? 
if you've never killed, or
wanted to but didnt, 
how could you know? 
if you've never been abused, 
beaten, or taken advantage of, 
how could you know? 
if you've never been imprisoned
for something you didnt do, 
or for something you did, 
how could you know? 

if you've never been left alone, 
without hope, without a prayer, 
how could you know? 

but if your brother or sister, 
from anywhere around the world, 
has done and felt and experienced
these things. 
how could you not know?-- for Jane kenyon


It is a day after many days of storms.
Having been washed and washed, the air glitters;
small heaped cumuli blow across the sky; a shower
visible against the firs douses the crocuses.
We knew it would happen one day this week.
Now, when I learn you have died, I go
to the open door and look across at New Hampshire
and see that there, too, the sun is bright
and clouds are making their shadowy ways along the horizon;
and I think: How could it not have been today?
In another room, Keri Te Kanawa is singing
the Laudate Dominum of Mozart, very faintly,
as if in the past, to those who once sat
in the steel seat of the old mowing machine,
cheerful descendent of the scythe of the grim reaper,
and drew the cutter bars little
reciprocating triangles through the grass
to make the stalks lie down in sunshine.
Could you have walked in the dark early this morning
and found yourself grown completely tired
of the successes and failures of medicine,
of your year of pain and despair remitted briefly
now and then by hope that had that leaden taste?
Did you glimpse in first light the world as you loved it
and see that, now, it was not wrong to die
and that, on dying, you would leave
your beloved in a day like paradise?
Near sunrise did you loosen your hold a little?
How could you not already have felt blessed for good,
having these last days spoken your whole heart to him,
who spoke his whole heart to you, so that in the silence
he would not feel a single word was missing?
How could you not have slipped into a spell,
in full daylight, as he lay next to you,
with his arms around you, as they have been,
it must have seemed, all your life?
How could your cheek not press a moment to his cheek,
which presses itself to yours from now on?
How could you not rise and go, with all that light
at the window, those arms around you, and the sound,
coming or going, hard to say, of a single-engine
plane in the distance that no one else hears

In the thinking West
Who think they think
It is always how and how
They worry how things work

In my India 
It is always cow and cow
They conceive and sanctify
An udder that never fails
To deliver all their needs

And in a few other places
It is a lot of bou and bou
Loud barks that clamor
To be heard at all nooks and corners

How dare you treat me like this? 
You must be taking the Mick.
Have you no respect to pay? 
Will you just send me 
On my way? 

The problem's Yours my friend.
With you I can't contend.
You are just me, me, me.
You've left me totally free.

I'm better off alone, 
With no-one in my zone.

You're such a bigot and a snob
And nothing but a knob
Who fobs me off 
With drivel
From your gob.

Your haughty arrogance makes me mad
As you are nothing but a cad.
Okay so you have all the power, 
And over me you sure do tower.
But don't be thinking that I'll cower: 
I glower waiting for my hour, 
For my dog's day
When You I shall devour

How dear to me the hour when daylight dies, 
And sunbeams melt along the silent sea, 
For then sweet dreams of other days arise, 
And memory breathes her vesper sigh to thee. 

And, as I watch the line of light, that plays 
Along the smooth wave toward the burning west, 
I long to tread that golden path of rays, 
And think 'twould lead to some bright isle of rest. 

full moon, low hung. 
bare branches brush
darkness wet skies.
listening, listening, 
to the tin roof
rusting with the dew, 
to the bricks groaning
and chipping with time, 
to the brown grasses weeping
for a new start. 

old cars that wont crank, 
window screens duct taped.
the lie on the stove
smells like long ago supper, 
the mail on the table unopened.
and the light in the bedroom
flickers, almost done.
who are we? 
and how did we get here? 

somewhere far off a baby cries, 
a dog barks, a screen door slams.
here there is nothing left, 
but the smell of old shoes, 
and cardboard boxes no one dares
to look into

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. 
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height 
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight 
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace. 
I love thee to the level of every day's 
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight. 
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right; 
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise. 
I love with a passion put to use 
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. 
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose 
With my lost saints, -- I love thee with the breath, 
I shall but love thee better after death. 

If I could put it into words -
All that my heart is feeling, 
Would they help to warm your heart
Or would they send you reeling? 

There are so many emotions
So many words to say, 
But which ones would you savor
And which ones throw away? 

I live in indecision -
Which formula is best? 
Overwhelm you with my thoughts
Or give your heart a rest; 

It's difficult to hold inside
This flood of raw emotion
That threatens now to drown me
Like a shipwreck on the ocean; 

I would die a thousand deaths
To think you never knew
Just how much you mean to me

But how do I reach you? 


ven those of us who've worked very hard
at not being prejudiced, have some type of
prejudice remaining.  for example: 
it could be prejudice by color, over religion, 
over political views, concerning sexual orient-
ation. . prejudice against those who have money, 
or those who dont!


etc.
all prejudice is wrong by nature, most of it grounded
in the 'self'.  in our own irrational fears, and our 
stubborn streak of ignorance
it's always taught, but doesnt have to be allowed! 
it ofen hides under the banner of morality, or the
flags of patriotism. 
we battle prejudice by being open minded, being
willing to listen, and learning to see ourselves
in other people. 
if we say we have no prejudices, we have lost, 
and prejudice has us bound.
if we admit our prejudices, name them, look at
them with naked eyes and resolve, then we're making
headway
prejudice in the end is humanity failing to be human! 
being human is a hour a day,days a week job

How do you,
Asks the chief of police,
Patrol a city
Where the butcher shops
Are guarded by vultures;
Where bulls get pregnant,
Cows are barren,
And calves give milk
Three times a day;
Where mice are boatmen
And tomcats the boats
They row;
Where frogs keep snakes
As watchdogs,
And jackals
Go after lions?

Does anyone know
What I’m talking about?
Says Kabir. 

The word success means many things to many people
To be considered a success, means that you have made it
The question here is – made it as what? 
How do you define success? 
Is it by passing an exam? 
Is it by becoming a landlord or landlady? 
Is it by been promoted at work? 
Is it by winning the lottery? 
Is it by marrying the woman of your dreams? 
Is it by marrying the man of your dreams? 
Is it by been in an executive position? 
Is it by winning an election? 
How do you define success? 
Are you successful as a pilot or a stewardess? 
What does the word – "success" mean to you? 
Is it by been the head of your organization? 
Is it by having lots of money? 
And how much money determines success? 
Are you successful as a member of the armed forces? 
Are you successful as a member of the police force? 
What is your own definition of success? 
Are you successful by been a writer, teacher, 
Pastor, evangelist, taxi driver, congressperson, 
Medical doctor or a reputed musician 
Are you successful by been a sole proprietor
Mechanic, movie star, or the chairman of the board
Are you successful as an architect or builder? 
Do you consider yourself a success as a banker? 
Success is in the eyes of the beholder
The meaning of success varies and differs
From one person to the other


Oh Supreme Artist! How do you do? 
This art of universe is amazing too.
Neither can we imagine nor can see, 
Who can buy this who can pay fee? 

Wonder your cosmic law with action, 
This returns equal response in reaction.
Such perfection in this art we do feel, 
Oh father to know we increase our zeal.

Amazing planets you hang in a space, 
Multiple stars in sky you keep in base.
Grace of yours is unlimited with season, 
How Super you are, super is your vision.

At each step we need you, we do pray all, 
We soon awake while you in love us call.
We follow your laws as you command, 
You give us resources we do not demand.

You do give free air, free water and life, 
Your wisdom breaks surely human strife.
Our father you are, heaven you do write, 
How do you do this art? How do you light? 

Because we hide the pain
I hear no evil 
Because you’re too scared to say
I speak no evil
Because I never could tell anyone
About what was hidden deep inside? 
Sad because this is how a victim feels


Ice on the moon and life on the mars
Big bang or something else originated the universe

It is pre-biotic, chemical, biochemical evolution
That has preceded the species evolution

All this is the food for thought of the intellectuals; 

I am the species which will be alive for sixty to seventy years maximum
Food, clothing and shelter are my requirements minimum

Fresh air to breathe, clean water to drink and enjoy food
And participate in reproducing activities, 
Are my primary and preliminary needs; 

Many do not seem to bother about this
How does it matter to me all the intellectual debates 
When my minimum needs are not on the radar
Of the ‘aviation’ experts of the nationsthere is a farther hill
a higher mountain, a brighter star
there's a light beyond this darkness
another step, dont know how far

there are wings and poet's dreams
that free and feed the hungry soul
a cross, a tree, a hidden path
that i can feel but cannot hold

there is a justice, a dignity
a place where walls crumble and fall
there's the truth beyond all fears
that comes to one, and comes to all

there is a knowing i cant define
that words cannot contain
a stillness that heals and fills
in the wind and in the rain

there is a time and an end
from which new beginnings are made
form to formless, stone and sand
a time to dance, a time to pray

there is a farther hill
a higher mountain, a brighter star
there's a light beyond this darkness, 
another step, just dont know how far!How far is it to Heaven?
As far as Death this way—
Of River or of Ridge beyond
Was no discovery.

How far is it to Hell?
As far as Death this way—
How far left hand the Sepulchre
Defies Topography.

'How far is Mexico? ' 
An expert of Geography said, 
'Thousand miles.'

'How long does one need to reach Mexico? ' 
A boatman said, 'Months after months.'

A pilot said, 'At least half a day.'

When I said to them, 'I reach there 
within few seconds every day', 
they all got astonished, 
'How is it possible? '

I said, 'There are many things strange
which happen in case of love.
I am the poor Orpheus of Bangladesh.
My Eurydice Lorena lives in Mexico.
Every moment I visit her, she visits me.
We need not have any boat or any aircraft.
Our love is our Borrak* which explores earth and the sky
faster than the speed of light.'



my ancestors walked barefoot, 
followed the herds, 
danced in the firelight

played instruments made by hand, 
prayed to the god of wind and rain
made love in the moonlight

owned nothing, owned by no one
how far we have fallen, 
how long the journey home

But bites of gorgeous work
Are stupendous as flight and duty.
How can service be kept for the brave? 
Armies relax to fight one more day, 
Fast relief arrives once more.
I am a beleaguered warlord of height, 
How fast does my enemy travel
To pick me up, to show me its strength? 
Sentences concern me in this war
Of attrition, the war of oblivion. 

How firm Eternity must look
To crumbling men like me
The only Adamant Estate
In all Identity - 

How mighty to the insecure
Thy Physiognomy
To whom not any Face cohere - 
Unless concealed in thee


How fits his Umber Coat
The Tailor of the Nut?
Combined without a seam
Like Raiment of a Dream - 

Who spun the Auburn Cloth?
Computed how the girth?
The Chestnut aged grows
In those primeval Clothes - 

We know that we are wise - 
Accomplished in Surprise - 
Yet by this Countryman - 
This nature -  how undone!How fortunate the Grave—
All Prizes to obtain—
Successful certain, if at last,
First Suitor not in vain. 




You saw sagacious Solomon
You know what came of him,
To him complexities seemed plain.
He cursed the hour that gave birth to him
And saw that everything was vain.
How great and wise was Solomon.
The world however did not wait
But soon observed what followed on.
It's wisdom that had brought him to this state.
How fortunate the man with none.

You saw courageous Caesar next
You know what he became.
They deified him in his life
Then had him murdered just the same.
And as they raised the fatal knife
How loud he cried: you too my son! 
The world however did not wait
But soon observed what followed on.
It's courage that had brought him to that state.
How fortunate the man with none.

You heard of honest Socrates
The man who never lied:
They weren't so grateful as you'd think
Instead the rulers fixed to have him tried
And handed him the poisoned drink.
How honest was the people's noble son.
The world however did not wait
But soon observed what followed on.
It's honesty that brought him to that state.
How fortunate the man with none.

Here you can see respectable folk
So far he hasn't taken heed.
You who sit safe and warm indoors
Help to relieve our bitter need.
How virtuously we had begun.
The world however did not wait
But soon observed what followed on.
It's fear of god that brought us to that state.
How fortunate the man with none. 

Thru the jungle of your sleep
I had a passage of my dreams
You had a bookish face
I had a school bag in my hand.

Since first it was my fate to know thee! 
- Have the slow years not brought to view 
How great my grief, my joys how few, 
Nor memory shaped old times anew, 
   Nor loving-kindness helped to show thee 
How great my grief, my joys how few, 
   Since first it was my fate to know thee?How happy I was if I could forget
To remember how sad I am
Would be an easy adversity
But the recollecting of Bloom

Keeps making November difficult
Till I who was almost bold
Lose my way like a little Child
And perish of the cold.How happy is the little Stone
That rambles in the Road alone,
And doesn't care about Careers
And Exigencies never fears—
Whose Coat of elemental Brown
A passing Universe put on,
And independent as the Sun
Associates or glows alone,
Fulfilling absolute Decree
In casual simplicity—How heavy the days are.
There's not a fire that can warm me,
Not a sun to laugh with me,
Everything bare,
Everything cold and merciless,
And even the beloved, clear
Stars look desolately down,
Since I learned in my heart that
Love can die.






How Human Nature dotes
On what it can't detect.
The moment that a Plot is plumbed
Prospective is extinct - 

Prospective is the friend
Reserved for us to know
When Constancy is clarified
Of Curiosity - 

Of subjects that resist
Redoubtablest is this
Where go we - 
Go we anywhere
Creation after this

allows itself to die and will not defend itself in front of those
with the ax, not wanting to cause them
shame.
 
but only in front of His closest ones.
 
And a beautiful animal is being beaten to death,
to the masses
and say,
 
"Stop, please stop, why are you doing this
to Me? "
 
Kabir wept
when I 
knew. 

It all began when I was a small girl, 
Nowhere to go, 
No one to love me
So I just sat on the footpath and dreamed.
I didn’t know how to read or write, 
To play sport, or to just muck around with friends.
I couldn’t do anything without help.
But one day, one day, 
A woman named Mary Mac


Killop passed by, saw me
And took me to her place and cared for me.
Her spirituality showed when she opened up a school for
People who couldn’t afford to send their children to school.
When I left, I was  
I went out into the big unknown world, 
Doing what Mary Mac


Killop did to me.
I went out and helped the orphans, the poor and the sick, 
Just like Mary Mac


Killop taught me.
What an inspiring person Mary Mac


Killop was, 
Not only then, but for all times.
Her spirituality lives on, 
Through the young women of today. 

I thank you for the breath in my body as I arise
 
Thank you for the sky above
And for family you loaned to us to love
 
Thank you for tonight
Thank you for tomorrow too
For all of your mercy and forgiveness and all you do
 
Friends come and go but you remain the same
I am so thankful I can call upon your wonderful name
 
Father teach me guide me help me to be more like you
 
I will serve you all of my days
I will glorify your name with my ways
 
But help us to be humble
As we wait to go home with you
And upon this earth continue to trod
 
Let us not look back but forward to seeing you
How we thank you! 
were a women says
its ok to rape
how can that be
when forced upon
how is that ok
when you have no choice
how is that ok
when you fight to no avail
how can what he dose to you be ok
how would you feel 
if you were the victim 
that walked around thinking
your worthless in life
how would you feel
if you felt dead all your life
not caring, not loving
just not giving a.  .
defeats the purpose
and meaning of lifeduring my worst times
on the park benches
in the jails
or living with
whores
I always had this certain
contentment-
I wouldn't call it
happiness-
it was more of an inner
balance 
that settled for
whatever was occuring
and it helped in the
factories
and when relationships 
went wrong
with the 
girls. 


YOU saw go up and down Valladolid,	
A man of mark, to know next time you saw.	
His very serviceable suit of black	
Was courtly once and conscientious still,	
And many might have worn it, though none did:	        
The cloak that somewhat shone and showed the threads	
Had purpose, and the ruff, significance.	
He walked and tapped the pavement with his cane,	
Scenting the world, looking it full in face,	
An old dog, bald and blindish, at his heels.	        
They turned up, now, the alley by the church,	
That leads no whither; now, they breathed themselves	
On the main promenade just at the wrong time.	
You 'd come upon his scrutinizing hat,	
Making a peaked shade blacker than itself	        
Against the single window spared some house	
Intact yet with its mouldered Moorish work;	
Or else surprise the ferrel of his stick	
Trying the mortar's temper 'tween the chinks	
Of some new shop a-building, French and fine.	        
He stood and watched the cobbler at his trade,	
The man who slices lemons into drink,	
The coffee-roaster's brazier, and the boys	
That volunteer to help him turn its winch.	
He glanced o'er books on stalls with half an eye,	        
And fly-leaf ballads on the vender's string,	
And broad-edged bold-print posters by the wall.	
He took such cognizance of men and things,	
If any beat a horse, you felt he saw;	
If any cursed a woman, he took note;	        
Yet stared at nobody,—they stared at him,	
And found, less to their pleasure than surprise,	
He seemed to know them and expect as much.	
So, next time that a neighbor's tongue was loosed,	
It marked the shameful and notorious fact,	        
We had among us, not so much a spy,	
As a recording chief-inquisitor,	
The town's true master if the town but knew!	
We merely kept a Governor for form,	
While this man walked about and took account	        
Of all thought, said, and acted, then went home,	
Who has an itch to know things, he knows why,	
And reads them in his bedroom of a night. 


How lonesome the Wind must feel Nights - 
When people have put out the Lights
And everything that has an Inn
Closes the shutter and goes in - 

How pompous the Wind must feel Noons
Stepping to incorporeal Tunes
Correcting errors of the sky
And clarifying scenery

How mighty the Wind must feel Morns
Encamping on a thousand dawns
Espousing each and spurning all
Then soaring to his Temple Tall -‘How long is it dear, since we were wed, 
when first I ventured into your bed.
We’ve made it through together since then, 
time filled with laughter, and counting to ten’.

‘How long is it since we were wed, 
teapot filled up, toast with butter spread.
Memories formed and loved treasures kept, 
times of bright smiles, moments when we’ve wept’.

‘How long is it dear since we were wed, 
letters and cards, so numerous, read.
Funny jokes told and stories so sad, 
accepting good, along with the bad’.

‘How long is it dear, since we were wed, 
and what’s for us in the times ahead.
Shall we go on in the same old way, 
each looking back to our own heyday’.

‘How long is it since we were wed, 
no, cannot remember either, Ted.
But never mind, it was long ago, 
and anyway I still love you so’.


Of this wild war that wraps the world, a roaring dragon-flame
Fed on earth's glorious youth, high hearts all passionate to cope
—O Chivalry of Hope!—
With the cloudy host of the infidel and the Holy Earth reclaim.
For each dear land is Holy Land to her own fervent sons
Who fling in loyal sacrifice their lives before the guns,
But when they meet their foes above the battlesmoke, they laugh,
And all together quaff
The cup of welcome Honor pouts for her slain champions.
Oh, if a thousandth part of all this treasure, purpose, skill,
Were poured into the crucible transforming wrong and ill,
By the white magic of a wise and generous brotherhood,
To righteousness and good,
The world would be divine again, with eery war-cry still.
Poor world so worn with wickedness, bedimmed with rage and fear,
O yet may Love's creative breath renew thee, fashioned twice
A shining Paradise,
Unsullied in the astral choir, with Joy for charioteer.
How long shall bomb and bullet think for human brains? How long
Shall folk of the burned villages in starving, staggering throng
Flee from the armies that, in turn, are mangled, maddened, slain,
Till earth is all one stain
Of horror, and the soaring larks are slaughtered in their song?
Oh, may this war, this blasphemy that blots the globe with blood,
Slay war forever, cleanse the earth in its own mighty flood
Of tears, tears unassuageable, that will not cease to fall
Till Time has covered all
Our guilty century with sleep, and the new eras bud!
How long? The angels of the stars entreat the clouded Throne
In anguish for their brother Earth, who stands, like Cain, alone,
And hides the mark upon his brow, the while their harps implore
The Silence to restore
Come swiftly, Peace! Oh, swiftly come, with healing in thy feet;
Bring back to tortured battlefields the waving of the wheat;
Bring back to broken hearths, whereby the wistful ghosts will walk,
Blithe hum of household talk,
Till childhood dare to sport again and maiden hood be sweet,
Though thou must come by crimson road, with grief and mercy come,
Not with the insolence of strength, the boast of fife and drum;
Come with adventure in thine eyes for the splendid tasks that wait,
To weld these desolate
Crushed lands into the fellowship of thy millennium.
O Peace, to rear thy temple that no strife may overawe!
O Purity, to fashion thee a palace without flaw! Galilee,
To build the state on thee,
And shape the deeds of nations by thy yet untested law


How long, and yet how long,
Our leaders will we hail from over seas,
Master and kings from feudal monarchies,
And mock their ancient song
With echoes weak of foreign melodies?

That distant isle mist-wreathed,
Mantled in unimaginable green,
Our fathers have bequeathed
Too deep a love for her, our hearts within.

She made the whole world ring
With the brave exploits of her children strong,
And with the matchless music of her song.
Too late, too late we cling
To alien legends, and their strains prolong.

This fresh young world I see,
With heroes, cities, legends of her own;
With a new race of men, and overblown
By winds from sea to sea,
Decked with the majesty of every zone.

I see the glittering tops
Of snow-peaked mounts, the wid'ning vale's expanse,
Large prairies where free herds of horses prance,
Exhaustless wealth of crops,
In vast, magnificent extravagance.

These grand, exuberant plains,
These stately rivers, each with many a mouth,
The exquisite beauty of the soft-aired south,
The boundless seas of grains,
Luxuriant forests' lush and splendid growth.

The distant siren-song
Of the green island in the eastern sea,
Is not the lay for this new chivalry.
It is not free and strong
To chant on prairies 'neath this brilliant sky.

The echo faints and fails;
It suiteth not, upon this western plain,
Out voice or spirit; we should stir again
The wilderness, and make the vales
Resound unto a yet unheard-of strain. 


sit here 
watching 
thinking 
for how long? 
just sitting 
alone 
unnoticed 
unseen 
how long 
until someone notices  
how long to sit here 
alone
just unnoticed 
& unseen



a vessel, an artist that was black, 
In a sea of white suppression, that he carried on his deck, -
He made us laugh so hard that we were all reduced to tears, 
His message helped us overcome our anger and our fears.

Rich became a voice that we deep down did all desire; 
Fearlessly he broached topics that set our souls on fire.
From his first appearance on TV, to his albums and his roles, ..
He steadfastly endured and made the truth part of his goals.
 
Although his life was mired in addiction and excess, 
His heart was filled with love that he did openly express.
His legacy lives on in all our hearts and memories, 
Because he knew that racism was not a joke, but a disease.


Let the tears bedew our cheek, 
For a man from Tallangatta 
Has been missing for a week. 
Where the roaring flooded Murray 
Covered all the lower land, 
There he started in a hurry, 
With a bottle in his hand. 

And his fate is hid for ever, 
But the public seem to think 
That he slumbered by the river, 
'Neath the influence of drink. 

And they scarcely seem to wonder 
That the river, wide and deep, 
Never woke him with its thunder, 
Never stirred him in his sleep. 
As the crashing logs came sweeping, 
And their tumult filled the air, 
Then M'Ginnis murmured, sleeping, 
`'Tis a wake in ould Kildare.' 
So the river rose and found him 
Sleeping softly by the stream, 
And the cruel waters drowned him 
Ere he wakened from his dream. 

And the blossom-tufted wattle, 
Blooming brightly on the lea, 
Saw M'Ginnis and the bottle 
Going drifting out to sea. 



How many
Admirers
Do you
Need -
In life? 

Let there be
Many. 
Even if you
Don't admire
Any ;) 

But
Just
One
Would
Do. 
If you
Admire
Him
Too :)How many bards gild the lapses of time!
A few of them have ever been the food
Of my delighted fancy,—I could brood
Over their beauties, earthly, or sublime:
And often, when I sit me down to rhyme,
These will in throngs before my mind intrude:
But no confusion, no disturbance rude
Do they occasion; 'tis a pleasing chime.
So the unnumbered sounds that evening store;
The songs of birds—the whispering of the leaves— 
The voice of waters—the great bell that heaves
With solemn sound,—and thousand others more,
That distance of recognizance bereaves,
Makes pleasing music, and not wild uproar.



Mommy, how many fish in the ocean? 
How many peas in a pod? 
How many steps up to Heaven 

How many kisses are too many? 
How many bees in a swarm? 
How many teeth will fit in my mouth? 
How many snowflakes in a storm? 

If it takes one night to count fireflies, 
would it take two nights to count stars? 
How many roads can there be in a mile? 
How many miles is too far? 

How many hairs are on my head? 
Why did Daddy’s hairs all fall out? 
If I count all day long then get tired, 
how many numbers am I able to count? 

How many rocks in a mountain? 
How many shells on a beach? 
How many hugs am I missing
'cause Grammy lives where I can't reach? 

How many bricks in that building? 
How many leaves in a tree? 
How do you count how old someone is 
if you only can count what you see? 

When I get big, I’ll be a teacher. 
I’ll show kids how to count every way. 
Mommy, if I do teach them counting, 
how many kids can I teach every day? 

I wish I could know every number. 
I’m gonna try - it’s fun to do! 
There are so many things to be counted.  
but only one me and one you. 

How many demands the beloved can make!
The woman discarded, none.
How glad I am that today the water
Under the colorless ice is motionless.

On this shroud that is brittle and bright,
But save my letters
So that our descendants can decide,

So that you, courageous and wise,
Will be seen by them with greater clarity.
Perhaps we may leave some gaps
In your glorious biography?

Too sweet is earthly drink,
Too tight the nets of love.
Sometime let the children read
My name in their lesson book,
And on learning the sad story,
Let them smile shyly. . . 
Since you've given me neither love nor peace
Grant me bitter glory.How many Flowers fail in Wood—
Or perish from the Hill—
Without the privilege to know
That they are Beautiful—


How many cast a nameless Pod
Upon the nearest Breeze—
Unconscious of the Scarlet Freight—
It bear to Other Eyes—How many slams in an old screen door? 
Depends how loud you shut it. 
How many slices in a bread? 
Depends how thin you cut it. 
How much good inside a day? 
Depends how good you live 'em. 
How much love inside a friend? 
Depends how much you give 'em. 

Lesbia, you ask how many kisses of yours
would be enough and more to satisfy me.
As many as the grains of Libyan sand
that lie between hot Jupiter’s oracle,
at Ammon, in resin-producing Cyrene,
and old Battiades sacred tomb:
or as many as the stars, when night is still,
gazing down on secret human desires:
as many of your kisses kissed
are enough, and more, for mad Catullus,
as can’t be counted by spies
nor an evil tongue bewitch us. 

How many lives I live! 
To son-daughters I give
Love, affection, kindness, 
Teaching, shelter, fine dress.

To my bad harmful foes
Only my hatred goes, 
Nothing good I give them; 
Isn't a matter of shame? 

To my friends I am kind, 
My cruelty others find.
In the mosque I like loss, 
In office a cruel boss.


For this life that I live

HOW many of the body's health complain, 
When they some deeper malady conceal; 
Some unrest of the souled, some secret pain, 
Which thus its presence doth to them reveal. 
Vain would we seek, by the physician's aid, 
A name for this soul-sickness e'er to find; 
A remedy for health and strength decayed, 
Whose cause and cure are wholly of the mind 
To higher nature is the soul allied, 
And restless seeks its being's Source to know; 
Finding not health nor strength in aught beside; 
How often vainly sought in things below, 
Whether in sunny clime, or sacred stream, 
Or plant of wondrous powers of which we dream!How many times these low feet staggered—
Only the soldered mouth can tell—
Try—can you stir the awful rivet—
Try—can you lift the hasps of steel!

Stroke the cool forehead—hot so often—
Lift—if you care—the listless hair—
Handle the adamantine fingers
Never a thimble—more—shall wear—

Buzz the dull flies—on the chamber window—
Brave—shines the sun through the freckled pane—
Fearless—the cobweb swings from the ceiling—
Indolent Housewife—in Daisies—lain

How much are we like a tiny universe
Self contained, we exist within our own set of laws
Metaphysically present in more than one dimension
Where we came from, nobody remembers
Where we disappear to, nobody knows
It's as if we sprout out of a potent nothingness
Put on the clothing of physicality and location
For a specific length of time, itself unknown
And go away, although having no obvious
Other place to disappear into-
All of it seems like nothing so much as a dream
But who is the dreamer, and where rests the dream


is never enough.
How much is tough, 
Can be so rough.
We only can learn, 
and then apply.
We only can turn, 
the truth from lie.

A force to be reckon with, 
A force that knowledge gives.
Be wise in wielding power.
Be wise in sharing knowledge.﻿

What we receive, 
in turn we give.
what comes around, 
will come another round﻿.


What is wrong will go wrong.
But when it's wrong, we sing a song.
Not of regret, but of forget.
Never succumb to human nature.﻿
Move on to a better future. 


How my heart yearns towards my friends at home!
Poor suffering souls, whose lives are like the trees,
Bent, crushed, and broken in the storm of life!
A whirlwind of existence seems to roam
Through some poor hearts continually. These
Have neither rest nor pause; one day is rife
With tempest, and another dashed with gloom;
And the few rays of light that might illume
Their thorny path are drenched with tearful rain.
Yet these pure souls live not their lives in vain;
For they become as spiritual guides
And lights to others; rising with the tides
Of their full being into higher spheres,
Brighter and brighter still through all the coming years. 


I.
Now I have seen everything. 
The wake is going on right now from two to four
And it’s a quarter to three
And I look out the window 
And I see Tony in shorts and a baseball cap, 
Walking around, moving cars, 
Not at his brother’s wake 
Which is only today

II.
So I go to the funeral 
Tony shows up late
And gives a speech
He hardly says a word about his brother
He starts talking about his business
And how it wasn’t going well
And somebody ripped him off
But now things will get better
And he talks about some charity he’s giving to
And the importance of giving to charity

III.
That evening from his yard 
He told me that I smile all the time and 
That my life must be going well.
"You’ve always been one of the nice ones, " he said. 


I wanted to write some poetry
I wrote down words that I thought were beautiful
Enough to crawl; but they could not stroll: 
They slammed the door in my face

I wrote love poems, loss poems
Poems of unrequited love, of love that took the wrong bus downtown; 
They threw my manuscript in the corner dumpster

Over all my words, rubbed it into metaphors; 
They mailed all my writing to Zimbabwe

I gashed my jugular, jumped up and down on rejection slips
Stabbed myself with paper clips, 
Screamed obscenities, refuted my core humanity
Pronounced myself an alien; and re-opened all my old wounds again: 
They padlocked the offices

I threw up, gave up
Burnt my words, sold my soul for pennies
Became another rumor; homeless, unwashed, beyond hope or despair: 
Found out they had hunted me for weeks to tell me
Finally, I was deemed good enough to see print
But by then I had decided to found a new religion
And just forget about poetry. 


How oft has the Benshee cried, 
How oft has death untied 
Bright links that Glory wove, 
Sweet bonds entwined by Love. 
Peace to each manly soul that sleepeth; 
Rest to each faithful eye that weepeth; 
Long may the fair and brave, 
Sigh o'er the hero's grave. 

We're fallen upon gloomy days!
Star after star decays. 
Every bright name, that shed 
Light o'er the land, is fled. 
Dark falls the tear of him who mourneth 
Lost joy, or hope that ne'er returneth: 
But brightly flows the tear, 
Wept o'er a hero's bier. 

Quench'd are our beacon lights -- 
Thou, of the Hundred Fights!
Thou, on whose burning tongue 
Truth, peace, and freedom hung!
Both mute, -- but long as valour shineth, 
Or mercy's soul at war repineth, 
So long shall Erin's pride 
Tell how they lived and died. 


How often dose ones dream become reality 
how often do we feel safe and sound 
among-est. family and friends 
how often does a stranger 
touch our lives that 
leaves ripples of time 
that affect the way we think 
changing the shifting of sands 

We sit alone in the dark 
contemplating what is life 
how do we let the years go pass 
with the patches of blackness 
that dapples the paths we chose 
as we jump from sunbeam to sunbeam 
thinking how often there are highs and lows 
in one’s life as we learn to live and breathe 

How can you tell loved ones 
how much they mean to you 
as a friend, a husband, a wife, 
a son, a daughter, your best friend 
your soul mate for life 
You tell them with meaning 
behind each word, and saying 
that you love, respect them 
for the rest of their lives


How old is my heart, how old, how old is my heart,
and did I ever go forth with song when the morn was new?
I seem to have trod on many ways: I seem to have left
I know not how many homes; and to leave each
was still to leave a portion of mine own heart,
of my old heart whose life I had spent to make that home
and all I had was regret, and a memory.

So I sit and muse in this wayside harbour and wait
till I hear the gathering cry of the ancient winds and again
I must up and out and leave the members of the hearth
to crumble silently into white ash and dust,
and see the road stretch bare and pale before me: again
my garment and my house shall be the enveloping winds
and my heart be fill'd wholly with their old pitiless cry.



For weeks and weeks the autumn world stood still,
Clothed in the shadow of a smoky haze;
The fields were dead, the wind had lost its will,
And all the lands were hushed by wood and hill,
In those grey, withered days.

Behind a mist the blear sun rose and set,
At night the moon would nestle in a cloud;
The fisherman, a ghost, did cast his net;
The lake its shores forgot to chafe and fret,
And hushed its caverns loud.

Far in the smoky woods the birds were mute,
Save that from blackened tree a jay would scream,
Or far in swamps the lizard's lonesome lute
Would pipe in thirst, or by some gnarled root
The tree-toad trilled his dream.

From day to day still hushed the season's mood,
The streams stayed in their runnels shrunk and dry;
Suns rose aghast by wave and shore and wood,
And all the world, with ominous silence, stood
In weird expectancy:

When one strange night the sun like blood went down,
Flooding the heavens in a ruddy hue;
Red grew the lake, the sere fields parched and brown,
Red grew the marshes where the creeks stole down,
But never a wind-breath blew.

That night I felt the winter in my veins,
A joyous tremor of the icy glow;
And woke to hear the north's wild vibrant strains,
While far and wide, by withered woods and plains,
Fast fell the driving snow. 



How pale the light lies, beneath the closing door-
Sleepless or sleeping- in shadow evermore.
How the words die, on lips like wilted rose; 
But whence the words go, no one ever knows.

How sad the mirror, that only sad eyes shows; 
Forlorn the moon, though each night fatter grown.
When dark returns, the door will still be closed-
No moon nor shine, where barren rose is sown. 

Choose one word and say it over
and over, till it builds a fire inside your mouth.
Adhafera, the one who holds out, Alphard, solitary one,
the stars were named by people like us.
Each night they line up on the long path between worlds.
They nod and blink, no right or wrong
in their yellow eyes. Dirah, little house,
unfold your walls and take us in.

My well went dry, my grandfather's grapes
have stopped singing. I stir the coals,
my babies cry. How will I teach them
they belong to the stars?
They build forts of white stone and say, "This is mine"



How will I teach them to love Mizar, veil, cloak,
to know that behind it an ancient man
is fanning a flame?
He stirs the dark wind of our breath.
He says the veil will rise
till they see us shining, spreading like embers
on the blessed hills.

Well, I made that up. I'm not so sure about Mizar.
But I know we need to keep warm here on earth
And when your shawl is as thin as mine is, you tell stories. 

How pleasant to know Mr. Lear, 
Who has written such volumes of stuff. 
Some think him ill-tempered and queer, 
But a few find him pleasant enough. 

His mind is concrete and fastidious, 
His nose is remarkably big; 
His visage is more or less hideous, 
His beard it resembles a wig. 

He has ears, and two eyes, and ten fingers, 
(Leastways if you reckon two thumbs); 
He used to be one of the singers, 
But now he is one of the dumbs. 

He sits in a beautiful parlour, 
With hundreds of books on the wall; 
He drinks a great deal of marsala, 
But never gets tipsy at all. 

He has many friends, laymen and clerical, 
Old Foss is the name of his cat; 
His body is perfectly spherical, 
He weareth a runcible hat. 

When he walks in waterproof white, 
The children run after him so! 
Calling out, "He's gone out in his night- 
Gown, that crazy old Englishman, oh!" 

He weeps by the side of the ocean, 
He weeps on the top of the hill; 
He purchases pancakes and lotion, 
And chocolate shrimps from the mill. 

He reads, but he does not speak, Spanish, 
He cannot abide ginger beer; 
Ere the days of his pilgrimage vanish, 
How pleasant to know Mr. Lear

It comes blundering over the 
Boulders at night, it stays
Frightened outside the
Range of my campfire
I go to meet it at the
Edge of the light


My heart cries for you, 
You can't hear that cry.
My eyes wet with dew, 
Before you see, it gets dry.



Tell me, o Dove, 
How shall I prove my love

How shall my animal
Whose wizard shape I trace in the cavernous skull,
Vessel of abscesses and exultation's shell,
Endure burial under the spelling wall,
The invoked, shrouding veil at the cap of the face,
Who should be furious,
Drunk as a vineyard snail, flailed like an octopus,
Roaring, crawling, quarrel
With the outside weathers,
The natural circle of the discovered skies
Draw down to its weird eyes?

How shall it magnetize,
Towards the studded male in a bent, midnight blaze
That melts the lionhead's heel and horseshoe of the heart
A brute land in the cool top of the country days
To trot with a loud mate the haybeds of a mile,
Love and labour and kill
In quick, sweet, cruel light till the locked ground sprout
The black, burst sea rejoice,
The bowels turn turtle,
Claw of the crabbed veins squeeze from each red particle
The parched and raging voice?

Fishermen of mermen
Creep and harp on the tide, sinking their charmed, bent pin
With bridebait of gold bread, I with a living skein,
Tongue and ear in the thread, angle the temple-bound
Curl-locked and animal cavepools of spells and bone,
Trace out a tentacle,
Nailed with an open eye, in the bowl of wounds and weed
To clasp my fury on ground
And clap its great blood down;
Never shall beast be born to atlas the few seas
Or poise the day on a horn.

Sigh long, clay cold, lie shorn,
Cast high, stunned on gilled stone; sly scissors ground in frost
Clack through the thicket of strength, love hewn in pillars drops
With carved bird, saint, and suns the wrackspiked maiden mouth
Lops, as a bush plumed with flames, the rant of the fierce eye,
Clips short the gesture of breath.
Die in red feathers when the flying heaven's cut,
And roll with the knocked earth:
Lie dry, rest robbed, my beast.
You have kicked from a dark den, leaped up the whinnying light,
And dug your grave in my breast. 


Your word should be such
Those increase the enthusiasm
"Well done, your work is good"
Captivate minds like museum.

Your words should be such
Which gives other happiness? 
Use words like "You are very good
You are a star of brightness"

Your words should be such 
Those improve courage, 
Say, "You have good effort
Definitely you will success without damage."

Your words should be such
Which pardons the person? 
"Does not matter, take care of future"
You say and show in action.

Your words should be such
Which bless the individual? 
In whatever you do it will be visual.

Your words should be such
Which felicitates chums? 
Say "Please come and sit down
You are welcome" and have hums. 

Why do I care at all what next I do in life? 
After all I'm the boss of me.  

though I don't say that to my wife.



Well sometimes I do care, but should it really matter? 
Is it better to be Alice or better to be Mad Hatter? 

What it really comes down to is the LITTLE decisions I make.
Shall I immerse myself in a novel, or out-the-garbage-take? 
Well, luckily, as I'm retired, I've more leeway in my choices.
I've got time to respond to my mind's contradictory voices.

I should not feel guilty, and try not to feel guilty, about what I do next.
I'm the boss after all, so 'Let me not be vexed'! 
Shall I start a new poem?  It seems the thing to do.
The household chores I have in mind can wait a day or two.

I've lived a pretty full life.  I'm satisfied with myself.
What things I don't do from now on can just stay on 'the shelf'.

I think I've done enough to live up to expectations, 
and if I don't 'measure up' then DAMN the calculations! ! 

My dear Mother is long since gone, but still her lead I follow.
I think my days contain some goodness; they are not just hollow.
that I've done what is expected, and She'd smile at me.
 
And although I've had relationships in which 'some' have said I failed, 
I truly believe they ended because my EFFORTS were bewailed.
And perhaps as some small evidence that I was not a cad: 
my major former partners, to talk to me these days, are glad.  

And if you believe humans have a duty to pass on DNA, 
I've performed my 'duty'.  (But it was only to let my first wife have her way.)   

Well I guess I got a little carried away with this poem, but ain't it all the same? 
To take out garbage, or write a poem, or have a child-it's all a game.
It's part of the game of life and who's to say what and if it does matter. 
But let not this, my casual-view-of-life, your outlook on YOUR life shatter.   



My brother was aftaid, even as a boy, of going blind- so deeply
that he would turn the dinner knives away from, looking at him,

he said, as they lay on the kitchen table.
He would throw a sweatshirt over those knobs that lock the car door

from the inside, and once, he dismantled a chandelier in the middle
of the night when everyone was sleeping.

We found the pile of sharp shining crystals in the upstairs hall.
So you understand, it was terrible

when they clamped his one eye open and put the needle in through
 his cheek
and up into his eye from underneath

and left it there for a full minute before they drew it slowly out
once a week for many weeks.  He learned to, lean into it,

to settle down he said, and still the eye went dead, ulcerated,
breaking up green in his head, as the other eye, still blue

and wide open, looked and looked at the clock.

My brother promised me he wouldn't die after our father died.
 five years,

as clearly as he promised he'd be home for breakfast when I watched him
walk into that New York City autumn night.  By nine, I promise,

and he was- he did come back.  And five years later he promised five
 years more.
So much for the brave pride of premonition,

the worry that won't let it happen.
You know, he said, I always knew I would die young.  And then I got sober

and I thought, OK, I'm not.  I'm going to see thirty and live to be an old
 man.
And now it turns out that I am going to die.  Isn't that funny?

- One day it happens:  what you have feared all your life,
the unendurably specific, the exact thing.  No matter what you say or do.

This is what my brother said:  Here, sit closer to the bed
so I can see you. 



How soon the servant sun,
(Sir morrow mark),
Can time unriddle, and the cupboard stone,
(Fog has a bone
He'll trumpet into meat),
Unshelve that all my gristles have a gown
And the naked egg stand straight,

Sir morrow at his sponge,
(The wound records),
The nurse of giants by the cut sea basin,
(Fog by his spring
Soaks up the sewing tides),
Tells you and you, my masters, as his strange
Man morrow blows through food.

All nerves to serve the sun,
The rite of light,
A claw I question from the mouse's bone,
The long-tailed stone
Trap I with coil and sheet,
Let the soil squeal I am the biting man
And the velvet dead inch out.

How soon my level, lord,
(Sir morrow stamps
Two heels of water on the floor of seed),
Shall raise a lamp
Or spirit up a cloud,
Erect a walking centre in the shroud,
Invisible on the stump

A leg as long as trees,
This inward sir,
Mister and master, darkness for his eyes,
The womb-eyed, cries,
And all sweet hell, deaf as an hour's ear,
Blasts back the trumpet voice. 

Even if his single, weeping eye
Could still shout with a hoarse, salient fury, 
Could stab as swiftly and as deep
As flames can lick a still living tree, 
And the slender branches withering there, 
Each glowing with it’s own tongue of fire.

Though that eye pierce me completely
Through to the other side, 
And hold me in its stiffening fascination
Against the claustrophobic seam of the wall, 
It would already be too late; 

Already I should have squeezed out
My million or so after-births of words, by then
Lying quietly, in branching pools of splendor
Beneath a smoking, once verdant forest. 

How still, how happy! Those are words
That once would scarce agree together;
I loved the plashing of the surge -
The changing heaven the breezy weather, 

More than smooth seas and cloudless skies
And solemn, soothing, softened airs
That in the forest woke no sighs
And from the green spray shook no tears. 

How still, how happy! now I feel
Where silence dwells is sweeter far
Than laughing mirth's most joyous swell
However pure its raptures are. 

Come, sit down on this sunny stone:
'Tis wintry light o'er flowerless moors -
But sit - for we are all alone
And clear expand heaven's breathless shores. 

I could think in the withered grass
Spring's budding wreaths we might discern;
The violet's eye might shyly flash
And young leaves shoot among the fern. 

It is but thought - full many a night
The snow shall clothe those hills afar
And storms shall add a drearier blight
And winds shall wage a wilder war, 

Before the lark may herald in
Fresh foliage twined with blossoms fair
And summer days again begin
Their glory - haloed crown to wear. 

Yet my heart loves December's smile
As much as July's golden beam;
Then let us sit and watch the while
The blue ice curdling on the stream 


-How sweet I roam'd from field to field,
And tasted all the summer's pride
'Til the prince of love beheld
Who in the sunny beams did glide!

He shew'd me lilies for my hair
And blushing roses for my brow;
He led me through his garden fair,
Where all his golden pleasures grow.

With sweet May dews my wings were wet,
And Phoebus fir'd my vocal rage
He caught me in his silken net,
And shut me in his golden cage.

He loves to sit and hear me sing,
Then, laughing, sports and plays with me;
Then stretches out my golden wing,
And mocks my loss of liberty. 

HOW sweet it is, when mother Fancy rocks
The wayward brain, to saunter through a wood!
An old place, full of many a lovely brood,
Tall trees, green arbours, and ground-flowers in flocks;
And wild rose tip-toe upon hawthorn stocks,
Like a bold Girl, who plays her agile pranks
At Wakes and Fairs with wandering Mountebanks,--
When she stands cresting the Clown's head, and mocks
The crowd beneath her. Verily I think,
Such place to me is sometimes like a dream 
Or map of the whole world: thoughts, link by link,
Enter through ears and eyesight, with such gleam
Of all things, that at last in fear I shrink,
And leap at once from the delicious stream. 

The dust of their coming and going
Sifts down through the years, 
Their gravity once knotted fabric to flesh; 
Even though they're near, 
Just the ashes, are all can impress.

Since time snapped in two between their fingers, 
They haven't aged much, except to uncoil, 
Unwind branching strands; 
Under satin recoil
Beneath brass sheaths, the body banal.

We walk upon the faces of kings, and sleep
High, on the ruined backs of strangers; 
All unknowing, how the dust gets laid, 
Unaware of the danger-
Every generation becomes the new day

"Aye," said the boozer, "I tell you it's true, sir, 
I once was a punter with plenty of pelf, 
But gone is my glory, I'll tell you the story 
How I stiffened my horse and got stiffened myself. 
"'Twas a mare called the Cracker, I came down to back her, 
But found she was favourite all of a rush, 
The folk just did pour on to lay six to four on, 
And several bookies were killed in the crush. 

"It seems old Tomato was stiff, though a starter; 
They reckoned him fit for the Caulfield to keep. 
The Bloke and the Donah were scratched by their owner, 
He only was offered three-fourths of the sweep. 

"We knew Salamander was slow as a gander, 
The mare could have beat him the length of the straight, 
And old Manumission was out of condition, 
And most of the others were running off weight. 

"No doubt someone 'blew it', for everyone knew it, 
The bets were all gone, and I muttered in spite, 
'If I can't get a copper, by Jingo, I'll stop her, 
Let the public fall in, it will serve the brutes right.' 

"I said to the jockey, 'Now, listen, my cocky, 
You watch as you're cantering down by the stand, 
I'll wait where that toff is and give you the office, 
You're only to win if I lift up my hand.' 

"I then tried to back her -- 'What price is the Cracker?' 
'Our books are all full, sir,' each bookie did swear; 
My mind, then, I made up, my fortune I played up 
I bet every shilling against my own mare. 

"I strolled to the gateway, the mare, in the straight way 
Was shifting and dancing, and pawing the ground, 
The boy saw me enter and wheeled for his canter, 
When a darned great mosquito came buzzing around. 

"They breed 'em at Hexham, it's risky to vex 'em, 
They suck a man dry at a sitting, no doubt, 
But just as the mare passed, he fluttered my hair past, 
I lifted my hand, and I flattened him out. 

"I was stunned when they started, the mare simply darted 
Away to the front when the flag was let fall, 
For none there could match her, and none tried to catch her -- 
She finished a furlong in front of them all. 

"You bet that I went for the boy, whom I sent for 
The moment he weighed and came out of the stand -- 
"Who paid you to win it? Come, own up this minute
 

 





"Legs in the air
The crest of the wave
The water of a spark
The song of a heart
All we ever are
Is what we become there

The bucket drowns in the well
Like sound sings in the bell
Like day dwells in a dawn
Like life's song playing on

Tears hide in the mirror
Sobs muffle in dark
Didn't stay around long
To keep it from going wrong
All we ever are
Is what we become there

The bucket drowns in the well
Like sound sings in the bell
Like day dwells in a dawn
Like life's end stops a song. 


When the cabin port-holes are dark and green
Because of the seas outside
When the ship goes wop (with a wiggle between)
And steward falls into the soup-tureen,
And trunks begin to slide;
When Nursey lies on the floor in a heap,
And Mummy tells you to let her sleep,
And you aren't waked or washed or dressed,
Why, then you will know (if you haven't guessed)
You're "Fifty North and Forty West!"I do not know how one writes poetry
or how bright stars shine only at night-
Although there are theories to be found, in certain writings
that say stars may be seen in the bottoms of the deepest wells
during daytime- if one stares long enough, without blinking.


I do not understand how the sea
may be heard in a conch shell one has stolen
from the bosom of the ocean, 
however I have seen children, listening patiently at the open end; 
And also, I do not understand how pearls may arise
in some hidden place, simply from an irritation.


They say the earth is round, not flat-
though I have found only the flat parts, in all my wanderings.
Still, I feel sure there is poetry enough left over in the world
that stars and wells and seashells-
And even the occasional irritant-
can write their story in the sky, the sea, 
and in granite and oyster-shell, leaving it safe there
so that our children's children, and even their children, after them
can someday find and read again old tales, reborn. 



I.

I sprang to the stirrup, and Joris, and he;
I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three;
Good speed!'' cried the watch, as the gate-bolts undrew;
Speed!'' echoed the wall to us galloping through;
Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,
And into the midnight we galloped abreast.

	II.

Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace
Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place;
I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,
Then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right,
Rebuckled the cheek-strap, chained slacker the bit,
Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.

	III.

'Twas moonset at starting; but while we drew near
Lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear;
At Boom, a great yellow star came out to see;
At Dffeld,'twas morning as plain as could be;
And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the half-chime,
So, Joris broke silence with, Yet there is time!''

	IV.

At Aershot, up leaped of a sudden the sun,
And against him the cattle stood black every one,
To stare thro' the mist at us galloping past,
And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last,
With resolute shoulders, each hutting away
The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray:

	V.

And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back
For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track;
And one eye's black intelligence,---ever that glance
O'er its white edge at me, his own master,  askance!
And the thick heavy spume-flakes which aye  and anon
His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on.

	VI.

By Hasselt, Dirck groaned; and cried Joris, Stay spur!
Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault's  not in her,
We'll remember at Aix''---for one heard the quick wheeze
Of her chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering knees,
And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,
As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.

	VII.

So, we were left galloping, Joris and I,
Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;
The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh,
'Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff;
Till over by Dalhem a dome-spire sprang white,
And Gallop,'' gasped Joris, for Aix is in sight!''

	VIII.

How they'll greet us!''---and all in a moment his roan
Rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone;
And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight
Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate,
With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,
And with circles of red for his eye-sockets' rim.

	IX.

Then I cast loose my buffcoat, each holster let fall,
Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all,
Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear,
Called my Roland his pet-name, my horse without peer;
Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good,
Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and  stood.

	X.

And all I remember is---friends flocking round
As I sat with his head 'twixt my knees on the ground;
And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,
As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,
Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)
Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent. 


Snow capped mountains sharply pierce the sky, 
Ragged peaks jut upwards stiff and stark.
Cold and frozen wilderness so high, 
Standing out, a permanent landmark.

Vastness that amazes all who see
These giants made of  rock, rising sheer.
Inhospitable. Only a few
Dare to climb them even though they fear.

These pinnacles soar above the hills, 
And give views that take one’s breath away, 
How massive they, from a distance seem, 
Steep and lofty in their grand array.

They stay the same as year after year, 
The elements attack endlessly.
But strong remain, how they command, 
And move the rapt soul to ecstasy.


To live. Five for a softball. Four for a book,
A handful of ones for coffee and two sweet rolls,
Bus fare, rosin for your mother's violin.
We're completing our task. The tip I left
For the waitress filters down
Like rain, wetting the new roots of a child
Perhaps, a belligerent cat that won't let go
Of a balled sock until there's chicken to eat.
As far as I can tell, daughter, it works like this:
You buy bread from a grocery, a bag of apples
From a fruit stand, and what coins
Are passed on helps others buy pencils, glue,
Tickets to a movie in which laughter
Is thrown into their faces.
If we buy a goldfish, someone tries on a hat.
If we buy crayons, someone walks home with a broom.
A tip, a small purchase here and there,
And things just keep going. I guess. 


How thought you that this thing could captivate? 
   What are those graces that could make her dear, 
   Who is not worth the notice of a sneer, 
To rouse the vapid devil of her hate? 
A speech conventional, so void of weight, 
   That after it has buzzed about one's ear, 
   'Twere rich refreshment for a week to hear 
The dentist babble or the barber prate; 

A hand displayed with many a little art; 
   An eye that glances on her neighbor's dress; 
       A foot too often shown for my regard; 
An angel's form -- a waiting-woman's heart; 
   A perfect-featured face, expressionless, 


Remember who was the first true being ascendant
The portal; and then don't neglect beautiful beginnings; 
Every change here bringing opportunity's window, 
Nor can, nor should everything be just about winning.

Leaving and entering, never by the self-same door, 
Opportunities knocking for those for whom they'd knock.
Discarding the dross, or reclaiming the discarded, 
To seize the day and choose your own path, forevermore.

Yes, even heaven's in a flower; and everywhere we look
Change dividing chaos, of the conquering and freed.
The Tao becoming, while life's a beat recording, 
Everything worth doing once, if you saw the need. 

How time spirals outward like the sea, 
And breaks, divides upon the lea
As smaller eddies ripple docks; 
The stuff of time, tides and clocks.

Low-tide, high-tide; in due time, 
The seas rise up to make a rhyme, 
They smooth the beach with words of shell
And floating timbers wild tales tell. 

On changeable Earth human beings are wise, 
They want to perpetuate the progress in rise.
Some vie in earning wealth to live happily, 
Attractive edifices they build to reside properly.

To lead a prosperous life some are on keen, 
To live peacefully they try hard and do gin.
Some are on moonshine and they visualize peace, 
They visualize peace by wealth, pedantry and dish.

Do persons indeed get peace from wealth? 
Or do they avail eternal happiness or mental health? 
Peace can’t be obtained where there is vexation, 
Nor it can be acquired in fuss and transgression.

Perplexity and agitation don’t bring peace, 
Wealth can bring transient happiness and bliss.
Eternal peace we can acquire through noble work, 
Truthfulness, nonviolence can remove anxiety-murk. 

We can acquire eternal peace through meditation, 
Value in life can save persons from damnation.
These help a person to acquire eternal peace-bud.

Then finally

from Heaven above. 


How to be happy? 
Such a tall order, as none of us 
Seems to have time.
In these days of disorder
To think of that question  -
Of happiness being essential
For creating sublime
Feelings of bliss
Which we all miss! 
But here's a suggestion.

Sages, down through centuries
Wrote of the 'happy heart'.
They said to begin with the action
Of fighting our Pride, 
Which is a determined reversal
Right from the start, as
Harbouring hurt
Means expiring inside.

Resentment can fester, 
Cause ulcerous anger
Which never achieves the state
Of the free, - instead
Of learning forgiveness
Revenge starts to rancour, 
Harassing happiness
And killing it - dead.

How to be happy
In one easy lesson means
We're fostering daydreams.
Instead we must learn
That the effort in making     
Someone else happy keens
Our awareness, and that
The joy we receive   
We have to earn. 

Oh there once was a woman 
and she kept a shop 
selling trinkets to tourists 
not far from a dock 
who came to see what life could be 
far back on the island. 

And it was always a party there 
always different but very nice 
New friends to give you advice 
or fall in love with you which is nice 
and each grew so perfectly from the other 
it was a marvel of poetry 
and irony 

And in this unsafe quarter 
much was scary and dirty 
but no one seemed to mind 
very much 
the parties went on from house to house 
There were friends and lovers galore 
all around the store 
There was moonshine in winter 
and starshine in summer 
and everybody was happy to have discovered 
what they discovered 

And then one day the ship sailed away 
There were no more dreamers just sleepers 
in heavy attitudes on the dock 
moving as if they knew how 
among the trinkets and the souvenirs 
the random shops of modern furniture 
and a gale came and said 
it is time to take all of you away 
from the tops of the trees to the little houses 
on little paths so startled 

And when it became time to go 
they none of them would leave without the other 
for they said we are all one here 
and if one of us goes the other will not go 
and the wind whispered it to the stars 
the people all got up to go 
and looked back on love


Don't be polite.
Bite in.
Pick it up with your fingers and lick the juice that
may run down your chin.
It is ready and ripe now, whenever you are.
You do not need a knife or fork or spoon
or plate or napkin or tablecloth.

For there is no core
or stem
or rind
or pit
or seed
or skin
to throw away. 

I see everyday all are busy
For gathering food and clot
Nature has given hunger to us
We move in search of rice.

We take care of bodies daily
But this is truth we notice
We have to leave these at last
Then who are we? Are not souls? 

Ye, yes travelers we are souls
Caring body we have life journey
Caring selves we know us and you.

But still illusion attracts us
We wander in dilemma very often
How to get you then you tell? 

Start by getting a boyfriend 
Mix in school and other people
Add a pinch of clubs and jobs
Kneed until they become smooth
Pull apart and put in different city's 
Let sit until they raise tepers
And watch them move further away from eachother


They have seen the signs.
Quick, let's hide Him.
Let's think; carpenter,
fishermen's friend,
disturber of religious comfort.
Let's award Him a degree in theology,
a purple cassock
and a position of respect.
They'll never think of looking here.
Let's think;
His dialect may betray Him,
His tongue is of the masses.
Let's teach Him Latin
and seventeenth century English,
they'll never think of listening in.
Let's think;
humble,
Man of Sorrows,
nowhere to lay His head.
We'll build a house for Him,
somewhere away from the poor.
We'll fill it with brass and silence.
It's sure to throw them off.

Quick, let's hide Him..


I want to be alone, so to forget the World. Want

To be forgotten  – myself –  indeed: 'Me', a

Syllable only, dispersed in the night glow.


.-lights out- 
fall, hands a-clasped, into instantaneous
ecstasy like a shot of heroin or morphine,
the gland inside of my brain discharging
the good glad fluid (Holy Fluid) as

down to a deadstop trance-Healing
all my sicknesses-erasing all-not
even the shred of a 'I-hope-you' or a
Loony Balloon left in it, but the mind
blank, serene, thoughtless. When a thought
comes a-springing from afar with its held-
forth figure of image, you spoof it out,
you spuff it off, you fake it, and
it fades, and thought never comes-and
with joy you realize for the first time

Add another friend into the mix
Slide a boyfriend into it

As I wake up in the morning, 
sip my first cup of coffee
Walk my first step out the door
And say my first hello
Till I lay myself down these empty sheets
with my last yawn in the evening, 

only one name lingers my lips.

And it's funny
how I never stop uttering
such beautiful syllables
that makes up a song.

A drum in my chest
A hum to my soul

If only one name could make up a song
then let me write a thousand more

If only love can save the world
then let me write this love song

With only your name
on a sheet of paper. 

Must I know what I write down
Meaningless or meaning found
Making poem, don’t know how
Must I know what I write down

Does a poem need to breathe
To plan a knit into a weave
Or can it start not to conceive
A poemed haze is free to breathe

Writing breath from writing down
The poem tilts as I think now
Bias nature changing how
The poem writes, still writing down

No thought, no poem, here with me
Should I stop or let it be
Bleeding brain, becoming free
Rereading, learning, me for me


I lay in bed and ruminate some words.
Sometimes I jot them down.
Then up I get and type.
I sit alone
So still, 
To concentrate.
All focus.
In a trance.

Not quite, today, for Mum is here, 
On holiday: reading me the news.
I dream of soaring high
Above the ground. 
Then dropping, 
Swooping down
To skim along the surface of this world.
Possessed by eagle freedom.

I can go anywhere, 
Any time.
Can pick and choose my planet.
My mind has Hopkins mountains, 
I spot a deep crevasse.
The clouds are crawling over hilltops, 
Creeping down to valley floors.
A floodplain widens, 
Broken only by a snaking river.
Cascading mountain waterfalls
Have led to this meandering sheet
Of water.

Yes, my Muse, anywhere can take me, 
As I said; 
But with Mum reading the news out, 
Not today.




Their hands and fingers must be tragic when they reach for tragic food.

The hero must be a half-breed, half white and half Indian, preferably
from a horse culture. He should often weep alone. That is mandatory.

If the hero is an Indian woman, she is beautiful. She must be slender
and in love with a white man. But if she loves an Indian man

then he must be a half-breed, preferably from a horse culture.
If the Indian woman loves a white man, then he has to be so white

that we can see the blue veins running through his skin like rivers.
When the Indian woman steps out of her dress, the white man gasps

at the endless beauty of her brown skin. She should be compared to nature: 
brown hills, mountains, fertile valleys, dewy grass, wind, and clear water.

If she is compared to murky water, however, then she must have a secret.
Indians always have secrets, which are carefully and slowly revealed.

Yet Indian secrets can be disclosed suddenly, like a storm.
Indian men, of course, are storms. The should destroy the lives

of any white women who choose to love them. All white women love
Indian men. That is always the case. White women feign disgust

at the savage in blue jeans and T-shirt, but secretly lust after him. 
White women dream about half-breed Indian men from horse cultures.

Indian men are horses, smelling wild and gamey. When the Indian man
unbuttons his pants, the white woman should think of topsoil.

There must be one murder, one suicide, one attempted rape.
Alcohol should be consumed. Cars must be driven at high speeds.

Indians must see visions. White people can have the same visions
if they are in love with Indians. If a white person loves an Indian

then the white person is Indian by proximity. White people must carry
an Indian deep inside themselves. Those interior Indians are half-breed

and obviously from horse cultures. If the interior Indian is male 
then he must be a warrior, especially if he is inside a white man.

If the interior Indian is female, then she must be a healer, especially if she is inside
a white woman. Sometimes there are complications.

An Indian man can be hidden inside a white woman. An Indian woman
can be hidden inside a white man.  In these rare instances, 

everybody is a half-breed struggling to learn more about his or her horse culture.
There must be redemption, of course, and sins must be forgiven.

For this, we need children. A white child and an Indian child, gender
not important, should express deep affection in a childlike way.

In the Great American Indian novel, when it is finally written, 
all of the white people will be Indians and all of the Indians will be ghosts. 


From the first hello, 
From the get go.
When we first met, 
on the internet, 
know not real name, 
nor what's your game, 
or if you are fame, 
or even lame.

from what i know, 
you are not slow.
from what you say, 
you are not gay.
at any rate, 
 straight.

from what you write, 
you are quite right.
you have a sister, 
you nickname' monster.'
and Hunter big dog, 
in heaven, sob sob.
but now you have newbies.
handsome pupppies, 
I call them blackies, 
Monster call them lollies, 
or was it poppies? 

That all I have so far. 
Your turn to write
and show your bright
or rapper's might
and take the flight

So make a try
until next time
you have a rhyme, 
Adieu, goodbye. 

I look into your eyes, 
And I see, 
Some one staring back, 
Who really cares about me, 
You made me forget him, 
I’ve forgotten my past, 
You’re my future, 
And I want it to last. 

The tears start to roll, 
Down my face at night, 
Cause I am scared of the truth, 
I’m full of fright.
You’re the beat in my heart, 
The wind in my face, 
That feeling I get, 
Makes my heart race.

When you touch my skin, 
I just want to scream, 
The feeling is wonderful, 
My cheeks start to gleam. 
The world is worried, 
But I don’t care, 
There is something up there, 
Floating in the air. 

I just want to hold you, 
To kiss you all night, 
To laugh at your jokes, 
But never to fight. 
We’re both scared of this thought, 
Of a relationship happening, 
You’re not ready to be attached, 
And I am just listening. 

I sit on my bed, 
And wonder why, 
How could I meet, 
Such a wonderful guy. 
You make me laugh, 
You make me smile, 
But best of all, 
It is all worthwhile.  


~i want to try. . 

Howling is an act of religion, 
Beneath it is the urge to cry and be in a fog, 
When flowers burst with fruit
And actions desire each other
To make a few mountains and mounts.
The future rings doorbells, 
Feeling inside the prison cells
Like balloons rising, 
Being blown across the waters
Of the Atlantic Ocean, 
When suddenly or at once a land
Beams on us from nowhere.
It is the real authority to nevertheless
Be certain about. 



I  consume my all alcoholic rhymes
when I see your reflection in moonlit night
The minerva exists in splendid paradise
but i long to march for heavenly truth
the ascent of singing soul never ceases
but misery of life always preaches
unto that reflection of your persistent
I dive my dreams for beckoning thoughts
when I stand upon your pageantry
facing towards north wind then i sparse
my emotions with redolent feelings
I stare at your wide range
yearning to outcast my depressed thoughts
then my dreaded nightmare becomes mute. 

Hovering over a flashing sign
At the portal to Ahmadi**
Chirped the fluttering sparrow
To the tiny desert flower
That had just offered
Its first golden smile
To the rising sun of spring: 

"Eh, ye! What are these guys upto
Erecting these boards all around
That change colours and scenes
Like lights on a festival ground? "

The flower smiled again, 
This time philosophically: 
"My flying friend of the sky, 
Haven’t you yet heard
Home, Home, Home! 

"Having all these years, 
Burnt and smoked earth and air, 
Men choked of breath, 
Have now seen some sense
And know for sure
The dance of death awaits
If they don’t change their traits."

"Nature, the teacher, 
Has taught them the lesson
That they should have known
From day one – but Alas! 
They had chosen
The peril of undoing

"Isnt’t it strange that it took
A hole in the polar skies, 
Countless clogged windpipes, 
Scarred lungs and hearts, 
Scary seas of slick and waste, 
Smoky dark afternoons, 
Gasping towns asthmatic
For them to understand
This ‘blue marble’ of the cosmos
Is a treasure to be preserved, 
Be whatever the cost? "

"Listen friend, they have now begun, 
Singing a chorus in unison, 
"Home, Home, Home! "
In utter repentance and in hope, 
Determined to salvage
The oases senselessly ravaged".

"Young men and women
Who put up these signs
Have a vision of what their home
Should be  like, unlike the ones
Who rushed before them
Defiling nature’s sacred realms
In  wanton, hasty sacrilege."



"Home, Home, Home! "
Echoed the sparrow, 
As it soared in the brilliant sun, 
Buoyed by the February wind, 
Hope infused by the flower, 
On to a eucalyptus branch
That smelt health and well-being.

A bemused alley cat
That sat under the tree
Wondered what all this joy could be.
Her whiskers rayed out
Untold  happiness
Deep from a sunny heart
As she mewed with the wind
"Home, Home, Home! ".

"Home, Home! " sang the kids
Their voice filled with mirth.
"Home, Home" sang the winds
As they hissed and kissed the trees.
"Home, Home" sang the heart
Dreaming a world clean and green
Where all His children lived and preened
Letting every creature live
In peace, endowed with healthy breath, 
Safe and secure without care

Above our Earth so high
The Hubble telescope now hangs
Beyond our vault-like sky: 
An all embracing eye; 
Now showing us the universe
In all her glory.
Those swirling galaxies give way to seemingly endless
Tracts of quasars, dust and gas.
Through Hubble we look back through time, 
At remnants of the Big Bang: 
The Birth, they tell us, of Creation, 
That might be repeated, 
Over and over again.

Yet, before this satellite was launched, 
Or telescopes invented, 
Just what did humans know? 
What did the Aztecs know of England, 
Or fourteenth century English folk know of America? 
As technological advances have
Been swift, so our state of ignorance
Has been revealed for all to see.
For no-one knows The Purpose of Life.

     Why? 
   Oh Why! 
Do We Live
   To Die
     Why? 

For we will Die
Not Knowing Why.

He’ll show The Way.
Anyone you like; 
And Me, I’ll tell you just to Hope, 
For Love will see us through. 

Hubby snores, a midnight train, 
Left arm is giving me pain, 
Eyes wide open, energy drain, 
Can't fall asleep, I speak plain.

Fried chicken's to be blame, 
High salt, High oil, the same.
In part I have to claim
I do feel a little shame, 
Resistance futile, lame
Can't sleep, my hubby's train.

Cravings came, hard to resist. 
We live to eat, what a twist. 
Love of food  so persist,  
No use, give up resist. 


The most destructive and strongest within the NI ocean, 
Caused extensive damage
And shook the entire nation.

Post which the administration geared up
For the rescue and relief operations, 
People were evacuated to safe places
Relief funds were aided by PM.

Has all this really benefitted the victims
This saga only they can say, 
The hudhud they had in their lives
May or may not heal any day! 

Similarly, when there is a Hudhud in our life
When life's blow makes us kneel, 
It's a great time to pray.  though for some, 
life's Hudhud claims the most precious deal.

The victim here goes thru major phases
Impact stage, Reorganizing stage and Recovery stage, 
Every person takes time to heal, 
No matter what time or age

The recovery period does differ
As per the individuals strength in all, 
Some recover fully, Some partially
Some do not recover at all! 

Falling is part of life
But doesnt living mean, getting up after the fall, 
What is full recovery then? 
Forgetting everything and stand tall! 

No, It means giving to others what was taken away from the impacted person, 
Withstanding a rude shock by overcoming all the negative emotion, 
And yet choose to stand taller
in any circumstance or situation.

This is something only the most positive souls can do
Have the courage to stand in the same spot where he lost something precious, 
prefer to stand in the same spot, 
so that others don't have to go through anything vicious.

This is a lesson of life for all of us
To deal with our own difficult situations, 
And rise like a Phoenix  into a totally transformed being
With a resolve to contribute to others with a solution. 

love has no age face and no barriers, 
 Its like the sun and the moon, 
It’s like the day and night, 
It’s like the seasons, 
When one shines 
The other shadows, 
But each enfolding its charms.

 Love comes with a kiss, 
 enchantingly-, 
 And then it strikes 
Without a miss, 
You cant escape this sword of love, 
 But hang your head in sweet sublimation.

 People say -its an energy, 
A force to reckon with, which does not fail, 
But evolves through lifes’ synergies, 
From infancy to adulthood. 

First it’s the child and mother, 
Then follows sweet sixteens, 
Then comes the serious loves behold. 
This could just go on and on--
 not bound by any time.
Love is ageless, 
As long as that ripple, 
Stirs the passion with sweet intensity. 

Love is and is rightly said, 
 In a beautiful prayer: 
 Love it was that made us, 
 And love it was that saved us, 
When he made man, 

A big tree
Calm of dignity
Aside in lonely 
Cannot bent down

Beneath the shadow
Small trees
Play and move
Cuddling each other

No one nearby
Though feels
Far away eyes
Reminds past


I have this
Surging urge
To hug you
So much
That if I
Cling to you
Like a creeper
Nobody-
Can separate
Me from you. 

Hug 

by steven g taylor


something supernatural, 

occurs when people hug, 

an essence of what is wonderful, 

what is purposeful and personal, 

so powerful each hug, each tug, 

wish they could put it in a jug, 

from which I would daily drink til full, 

and then nightly I would plug.

Coalesce into oneness
Exchanging body heat


I will not play at tug o' war. 
I'd rather play at hug o' war, 
Where everyone hugs 
Instead of tugs, 
Where everyone giggles 
And rolls on the rug, 
Where everyone kisses, 
And everyone grins, 
And everyone cuddles, 
And everyone wins. 

A huge gun fires its load of lead
Internationally, yet on this nation
It has pitfalls to burn and rub.
One clock is a place for change, 
The huge gun manages its stare, 
The time slims down with forces.

I want to find a mathematical treatise
Binding the truth with spacious items, 
It needs a place called seawater or such.
The ocean can be on fire with itself, 
Boiling fluids smother us within, 
Liking the huge pistols and rifles of late.

A huger big man has importance of steering, 
He has walls of the huge diet, 
He combines me with himself.
I like to feed the ocean with the ocean, 
Has it got walls to be bored with? 
Has it been an ocean or a sea

My heart and soul seeks for splendor, 
The beautiful ones try their poetry and words
For riches to come in the Hereafter.
I see unity as a bridge, a sign will tell, 
The beloved sleeps and awakes once, 
When the huger tasks are complete.
This perfectly undoes the ruin of illness, 
Pure liquids are ingested to refrain from 
The hissing of the Serpent, which whispers
Into the ear and wants your eyes to deceive
The parent and the boy, the son and daughter, 
The family of the Heaven.

My heart has taken this soul as a medicine, 
A remedy or vial that rests your dust
And happiness.
My companion in Heaven spells her name, 
Understanding the thoughts in the experience, 
One has been looking at other gazers, 
One feels like a man or a woman.

My joys are numberless in the Garden, 
With maidens that cause delight, 
And milk has been with honey, 
And rivers blow with the heavenly breezes
Liking the sweeping of animals
And happiness of flowers. 

For the most part, 'The Faith' has always 
been worth keeping; it is the deeply corrupt 
'church leaders' who continually and devastatingly 
undermine those beliefs. Monstrous hypocrites who've already
lost their souls and are now intent on destroying ours.
So many of modern clergy have depraved minds 
and graceless souls. 

On an island the soft hue of memory,
moss green, kerosene yellow, drifting, mingling
in the Caribbean Sea,
a six-year-old named Alfred
learns all the words to all the songs
To learn the words is not so hard.
Many barmaids and teenagers have done as well.
But to sing as Alfred sings—
how can a giant whale live in the small pool of his chest?   
How can there be breakers this high, notes crashing   
at the beach of the throat,
and a reef of coral so enormous only the fishes know its size?

The grandparents watch. They can’t sing.
They don’t know who this voice is, trapped in their grandson’s body.   
The boy whose parents sent him back to the island
to chatter mango-talk and scrap with chickens—
three years ago he didn’t know the word "sad"!
Now he strings a hundred passionate sentences on a single line.   
He bangs his fist so they will raise the volume.

What will they do together in their old age?   
It is hard enough keeping yourself alive.
And this wild boy, loving nothing but music—
When a record pauses, that live second before dropping down,   
Alfred hugs tighter, arms stretched wide,   
head pressed on the luminous belly. "Now!" he yells.
A half-smile when the needle breathes again.

They’ve tried putting him to bed, but he sings in bed.   
Even in Spanish—and he doesn’t speak Spanish!
O mama I was born with a trumpet in my throat   
      spent all these years tryin’ to cough it up -

He can’t even read yet. He can’t tell time.
But he sings, and the chairs in this old dance hall jerk to attention.   
The grandparents lean on the counter, shaking their heads.
The customers stop talking and stare, goosey bumps surfacing on their arms.   
His voice carries out to the water where boats are tied
and sings for all of them, a wave.
For the hens, now roosting in trees,
for the mute boy next door, his second-best friend.
And for the hurricane, now brewing near Barbados—
a week forward neighbors will be hammering boards over their windows,   
rounding up dogs and fishing lines,
the generators will quit with solemn clicks in every yard.

will still be singing, doubly loud now, teasing his grandmother,   
"Put a coin in my mouth!" and believing what she wants to believe;   
this is not the end of the island, or the tablets this life has been   
scribbled on, or the song.


For three years, out of key with his time,
He strove to resuscitate the dead art
Of poetry; to maintain "the sublime"
In the old sense. Wrong from the start --

No, hardly, but, seeing he had been born
In a half savage country, out of date;
Bent resolutely on wringing lilies from the acorn;
Capaneus; trout for factitious bait:

"Idmen gar toi panth, os eni Troie
Caught in the unstopped ear;
Giving the rocks small lee-way
The chopped seas held him, therefore, that year.

His true Penelope was Flaubert,
He fished by obstinate isles;
Observed the elegance of Circe's hair
Rather than the mottoes on sun-dials.

Unaffected by "the march of events",
He passed from men's memory in l'an trentiesme
De son eage; the case presents
No adjunct to the Muses' diadem.

II.

The age demanded an image
Of its accelerated grimace,
Something for the modern stage,
Not, at any rate, an Attic grace;

Not, not certainly, the obscure reveries
Of the inward gaze;
Better mendacities
Than the classics in paraphrase!

The "age demanded" chiefly a mould in plaster,
Made with no loss of time,
A prose kinema, not, not assuredly, alabaster
Or the "sculpture" of rhyme.

III. 

The tea-rose, tea-gown, etc.
Supplants the mousseline of Cos,
The pianola "replaces"
Sappho's barbitos.

Phallic and ambrosial
Made way for macerations;
Caliban casts out Ariel.

All things are a flowing,
Sage Heracleitus says;
But a tawdry cheapness
Shall reign throughout our days.

Defects -- after Samothrace;
We see to kalon
Decreed in the market place.

Faun's flesh is not to us,
Nor the saint's vision.
We have the press for wafer;
Franchise for circumcision.

All men, in law, are equals.
Free of Peisistratus,
We choose a knave or an eunuch
To rule over us.

A bright Apollo,

tin andra, tin eroa, tina theon,
What god, man, or hero
Shall I place a tin wreath upon?

IV. 

These fought, in any case,
and some believing, pro domo, in any case ..

Some quick to arm,
some for adventure,
some from fear of weakness,
some from fear of censure,
some for love of slaughter, in imagination,
learning later . 

some in fear, learning love of slaughter;
Died some pro patria, non dulce non et decor" ..

walked eye-deep in hell
believing in old men's lies, then unbelieving
came home, home to a lie,
home to many deceits,
home to old lies and new infamy;

usury age-old and age-thick
and liars in public places.

Daring as never before, wastage as never before.
Young blood and high blood,
Fair cheeks, and fine bodies;

fortitude as never before 

frankness as never before,
disillusions as never told in the old days,
hysterias, trench confessions,
laughter out of dead bellies.


V. 

There died a myriad,
And of the best, among them,
For an old bitch gone in the teeth,
For a botched civilization.

Charm, smiling at the good mouth,
Quick eyes gone under earth's lid,

For two gross of broken statues,
For a few thousand battered books.

Yeux Glauques

Gladstone was still respected,
When John Ruskin produced
"Kings Treasuries"; Swinburne
And Rossetti still abused.

Fœtid Buchanan lifted up his voice
When that faun's head of hers
Became a pastime for
Painters and adulterers.

The Burne-Jones cartons
Have preserved her eyes;
Still, at the Tate, they teach
Cophetua to rhapsodize;

Thin like brook-water,
With a vacant gaze.
The English Rubaiyat was still-born
In those days.

The thin, clear gaze, the same
Still darts out faun-like from the half-ruin'd face,
Questing and passive 
"Ah, poor Jenny's case" . 

Bewildered that a world
Shows no surprise
At her last maquero's 
Adulteries.

"Siena Mi Fe', Disfecemi Maremma" 

Among the pickled fœtuses and bottled bones,
Engaged in perfecting the catalogue,
I found the last scion of the
Senatorial families of Strasbourg, Monsieur Verog.

For two hours he talked of Gallifet;
Of Dowson; of the Rhymers' Club;
Told me how Johnson (Lionel) died
By falling from a high stool in a pub . 

But showed no trace of alcohol
At the autopsy, privately performed --
Tissue preserved -- the pure mind
Arose toward Newman as the whiskey warmed.

Dowson found harlots cheaper than hotels;
Headlam for uplift; Image impartially imbued
With raptures for Bacchus, Terpsichore and the Church.
So spoke the author of "The Dorian Mood",

M. Verog, out of step with the decade,
Detached from his contemporaries,
Neglected by the young,
Because of these reveries.

Brennbaum. 

The sky-like limpid eyes,
The circular infant's face,
The stiffness from spats to collar
Never relaxing into grace;

The heavy memories of Horeb, Sinai and the forty years,
Showed only when the daylight fell
Level across the face
Of Brennbaum "The Impeccable".

Mr. Nixon 

In the cream gilded cabin of his steam yacht
Mr. Nixon advised me kindly, to advance with fewer
Dangers of delay. "Consider
Carefully the reviewer.

"I was as poor as you are;
"When I began I got, of course,
"Advance on royalties, fifty at first", said Mr. Nixon,
"Follow me, and take a column,
"Even if you have to work free.

"Butter reviewers. From fifty to three hundred
"I rose in eighteen months;
"The hardest nut I had to crack
"Was Dr. Dundas.

"I never mentioned a man but with the view
"Of selling my own works.
"The tip's a good one, as for literature
"It gives no man a sinecure


And no one knows, at sight a masterpiece.
And give up verse, my boy,
There's nothing in it


* * * 

Likewise a friend of Bloughram's once advised me:
Don't kick against the pricks,
Accept opinion. The "Nineties" tried your game
And died, there's nothing in it.

X. 

Beneath the sagging roof
The stylist has taken shelter,
Unpaid, uncelebrated,
At last from the world's welter

Nature receives him,
With a placid and uneducated mistress
He exercises his talents
And the soil meets his distress.

The haven from sophistications and contentions
Leaks through its thatch;
He offers succulent cooking;
The door has a creaking latch.

XI. 

"Conservatrix of Milesien"
Habits of mind and feeling,
Possibly. But in Ealing
With the most bank-clerkly of Englishmen?

No, "Milesian" is an exaggeration.
No instinct has survived in her
Older than those her grandmother
Told her would fit her station.

XII. 

"Daphne with her thighs in bark
Stretches toward me her leafy hands", --
Subjectively. In the stuffed-satin drawing-room
I await The Lady Valentine's commands,

Knowing my coat has never been
Of precisely the fashion
To stimulate, in her,
A durable passion;

Doubtful, somewhat, of the value
Of well-gowned approbation
Of literary effort,
But never of The Lady Valentine's vocation:

Poetry, her border of ideas,
The edge, uncertain, but a means of blending
With other strata
Where the lower and higher have ending;

A hook to catch the Lady Jane's attention,
A modulation toward the theatre,
Also, in the case of revolution,
A possible friend and comforter.



Conduct, on the other hand, the soul
"Which the highest cultures have nourished"


Beside this thoroughfare
The sale of half-hose has
Long since superseded the cultivation
Of Pierian roses. 

The vane on Hughley steeple 
Veers bright, a far-known sign, 
And there lie Hughley people 
And there lie friends of mine. 
Tall in their midst the tower 
Divides the shade and sun, 
And the clock strikes the hour 
And tells the time to none. 

To south the headstones cluster, 
The sunny mounds lie thick; 
The dead are more in muster 
At Hughley than the quick. 
North, for a soon-told number, 
Chill graves the sexton delves, 
And steeple-shadowed slumber 
The slayers of themselves. 

To north, to south, lie parted, 
With Hughley tower above, 
The kind, the single-hearted, 
The lads I used to love. 
And, south or north, 'tis only 
A choice of friends one knows, 
And I shall ne'er be lonely 
Asleep with these or those. 


Hugs come in different sizes.
Hugs feel different, too.
There are sad hugs when you're crying
(that's when nothing else will do) .

There are happy hugs for laughing.
There are hugs for scary, too.
But the hugs that I like best of all. 
are hugs for I Love You


are at that difficult stage

teenagers.

They sit around in my mind
all day

doing nothing except
lying there.

I remember
when I gave birth to them

they were so
cute

now they are just so
annoying

scoffing biscuits
over the computer

so the crumbs
get stuck between the words

leaving their dirty
metaphors

scattered all over the sofa

borrowing my similes 
without telling me

corrupting words
too young to know better.

I long for them
to leave home

go find a book
of their own

live in a little
poetry magazine

or the tip of
somebody’s tongue.

Instead they go
to all night raves

stagger home

their adjectives 
all wide-eyed

their nouns
intoxicated

(I just hate it)    

misquoting themselves

or thinking 
they were written

by someone more
famous.

"We wish we were 
Onelia’s babies! "
They scream & holler! 

"Well.  

you ain’t! "
I scream back at them
screaming back at me.

So now I have left
my brain

upon the coffee table 
with the dirty magazines.

They’re welcome
to it.

"I’ve given up
the ghost! "

"You’ll be back! "
they boast.





"Don’t you use that
easy rhyme on me! "

I laugh at them
floundering now

not knowing where
the next line is. 

.  

coming from.

Huh! Poems.  

who’d have them

Hulking wedges create mischief among others, 
Peevish thoughts are taken from them
As they collide within the bodies and corpses, 
Radiating within the customs of zealots.
Negotiated battles regard us with victory, 
Commandants praise the strategies of your
Highness, higher than the ideals of nature.
Predicted from eatables, they spoke a terrorism, 
Once the sudden nature of their requests came.
Snappy, like tartlets, entangled by neglect, 
The worst monsters arrive on the scene
To battle and eat the apples off the shore.
The ether wisely manifests, and the extent
Of this worrying essence is proclaimed.
Nests of neurosurgical waste are given wedges
Driven into the souls of cadavers. 



Armageddon did the job
Gog & Magog Gog & Magog
Armageddon did the job
Gog & Magog Gog & Magog
Gog & Magog Gog & Magog
Armageddon does the job


Stomp ahead, stomp ahead, stomp,

Take the thoughts 
From my mind 
And the feelings 
From my heart 
And the words 
From my mouth 
And what's left.  

The grains of sand.  

lost in the sea of infinity.  

lost in the sea of infinity.  

Human body
A perfect structure 
Created by god
Send by god
On the earth
Holy earth
To survive
To starve
A body
Which can 
Inhale 
Exhale
Pain
Grief
Have a mind
Sometimes
Conscious
Otherwise
Un conscious
Given a heart
Which 
Feels
Believe
Disbelieve
Anguish
 Is 
A troublesome

Sometimes
For self
Troubleshooter
For you
For me
Bear torment
Few times

Creep for nectar

A body

Human brain is considered to be very active
It remains on move and is selective
When nothing comes on hand? 
Foe is seen or reflected even in the friend

It may drive you to corner
But success has to come later or sooner
It may not stay for indefinite years
Something good will be disclosed to your ears

Some people are destined to be poor
They will be shown gate or door
Nothing may come out from their concerted efforts
Ship may be sunk before reaching to ports

But as is seen, nothing remains permanent
You must trust almighty and never resent
As everything hinges on fate or luck
At some place you may feel struck

It is natural rule and is bound to occur
No one is destined to stay same and suffer
As light emerges after long night spell
Everything is transformed for something to tell

Take it as positive aspect
Bit all depends on your good act
If you are sincere and honest
Everything will be looked upon as best


The formation of human brain is so complex
Each cell, tissue, vein, point, joint bears max
Of arts, acts, thoughts and wisdom for the wise
Each unseen cell by bear eyes is a big chapter, 
If the cells are seen, one earth needs for a brain
If all the veins of a brain are joined at length, 
It will wrap the earth several thousand times
Is as hard as soft needs food extraction and rest. 

The calibre of a human exceeds all acts, 
They subjugate me after the knowledge, 
Their ambulances surpass us in wisdom, 
We create the learning to excesses.

Let the mountain of pride be our subject, 
Open the food-doors and the drinking hours
Maybe the wisdom of indoor activity
Shall express an inner desire

When I am asked just what I endorse
My reply is, "Love, sans being forced"
There's no reason to cite
An edict to do right
We do not need a spiritual source


Vortex of cortex
Too dense to sense
Complex reflex: 
Make Love, Not War


I let the man that stands before me speak, I listen to his words and listen tell he begins to bleed, tell the floor is covered in his liquid and his embrace on life slips falling to his knees he begins to choke, Choking on his own words as the blood spills from his mouth as his lies begin to kill him eating him inside out, tell there is nothing but a pile of clothes soaking in his blood.

My head begins to throb as I listen to the woman who stands before me, yelling at my mistakes and pointing a finger at my defeats I watch every movement she makes every step she paces, I tune out the sound of her annoying voice as she begins to quiver my hearing clears, She begins to gasp and cough I watch in utter amazement her tongue turns green her face turns blue her speech starts to shake and her body drops in front of me. Her eyes stare at me I stare back into her emptiness I see someone as sadistic as a murderer, she wheezes out one last word and its hate.

I walk alone in a world misguided in evil I hold on hope waiting to find this person who speaks truth and tranquility, They say we have the right to the pursuit of happiness why have I not found it? Are those eyes I stare into my only fate of comfort? Are those lies I hear the misguided truth? Am I the only one who can seem to believe them? 

The man that told the lies bled the woman who only seeks oppression rots, is it in his nature to only lie, is it in her personality to overpower the weak why give them the chance to breath? Is it every humans right for a second chance but what if they failed that chance? Who decides if they can carry on and manipulate the right leading the young in the wrong path? 

It's those who follow only the wrong, the ones who follow wealth over human health, to destroy the human condition and make life harder to advance for those who have tried, I already gave up and the inside of me has died. 


Like Dr Jekyl and Mr Hyde
Accountant by day
Werewolf by night
A quiet soul by sunny day
Soul less creation by moonlight
Where does it end? 
A never ending nightmare
or dreams could bend
A journey of flight
or a spiraling fright. ﻿
When we dig, the more we feel
Burrowing deep multi layers
Complex creatures, to reveal
a play, a band of multi players


I heard a man on TV say
Five hugs are needed every day
Eight hugs to keep the blues away
Twelve hugs a happy chap to stay

A universal recipe
For contentment and for harmony
Essential both for you and me
And the entire human family


I could be rich like a king
but I prefer to live poor

o’ come on Kamran! 
you all the time use defenses
to calm the agony
of your unwanted existence

look honey! 
there is kid
playing with a ball
in the park
beside the lake
and there is another
fishing at the lake
same gorgeous dawn
might be the one fishing
knows better
how to play the ball
but he is destined
to kill fishes
merely to fill the aching stomach
of his starving siblings

we are predestined
to live a life
we love to live
even we are living in misery
we are blessed with the skills
to change our fate
but are restrained
by the human factor


July  note the obvious differences
in the human family.
Some of us are serious,
some thrive on comedy.

Some declare their lives are lived
as true profundity,
and others claim they really live
the real reality.

The variety of our skin tones
can confuse, bemuse, delight,
brown and pink and beige and purple,
tan and blue and white.

I've sailed upon the seven seas
and stopped in every land,
I've seen the wonders of the world
not yet one common man.

I know ten thousand women
called Jane and Mary Jane,
but I've not seen any two
who really were the same.

Mirror twins are different
although their features jibe,
and lovers think quite different thoughts
while lying side by side.

We love and lose in China,
we weep on England's moors,
and laugh and moan in Guinea,
and thrive on Spanish shores.

We seek success in Finland,
are born and die in Maine.
In minor ways we differ,
in major we're the same.

I note the obvious differences
between each sort and type,
but we are more alike, my friends,
than we are unalike.

We are more alike, my friends,
than we are unalike.

We are more alike, my friends,
than we are unalike. 

And the words 
Became flesh 
Moment 
I came 
Across them  

And the flesh 
Praised through song 
And became human 
Forever again


And the words 
Became flesh 
Moment 
I came 
Across them  

And the flesh 
Praised through song 
And became human 
Forever again


So you’ve made mistakes
That only proves you’re human
Not a fatal thing


Since thou readest in her what thou thyself hast there written,
      And, to gladden the eye, placest her wonders in groups;--
    Since o'er her boundless expanses thy cords to extend thou art able,
      Thou dost think that thy mind wonderful Nature can grasp.
    Thus the astronomer draws his figures over the heavens,
      So that he may with more ease traverse the infinite space,
    Knitting together e'en suns that by Sirius-distance are parted,
      Making them join in the swan and in the horns of the bull.
    But because the firmament shows him its glorious surface,
      Can he the spheres' mystic dance therefore decipher aright

If dead, we cease to be ; if total gloom
     Swallow up life's brief flash for aye, we fare
As summer-gusts, of sudden birth and doom,
     Whose sound and motion not alone declare,
But are their whole of being ! If the breath
     Be Life itself, and not its task and tent,
If even a soul like Milton's can know death ;
     O Man ! thou vessel purposeless, unmeant,
Yet drone-hive strange of phantom purposes !
     Surplus of Nature's dread activity,
Which, as she gazed on some nigh-finished vase,
Retreating slow, with meditative pause,
     She formed with restless hands unconsciously.
Blank accident ! nothing's anomaly !
     If rootless thus, thus substanceless thy state,
Go, weigh thy dreams, and be thy hopes, thy fears,
The counter-weights !--Thy laughter and thy tears
     Mean but themselves, each fittest to create
And to repay the other ! Why rejoices
     Thy heart with hollow joy for hollow good ?
     Why cowl thy face beneath the mourner's hood ?
Why waste thy sighs, and thy lamenting voices,
     Image of Image, Ghost of Ghostly Elf,
That such a thing as thou feel'st warm or cold ?
Yet what and whence thy gain, if thou withhold
     These costless shadows of thy shadowy self ?
Be sad ! be glad ! be neither ! seek, or shun !
Thou hast no reason why ! Thou canst have none ;
Thy being's being is contradiction. 

What mortal, when he saw,
Life's voyage done, his heavenly Friend,
Could ever yet dare tell him fearlessly:
'I have kept uninfringed my nature's law ; 
The inly-written chart thou gavest me, 
To guide me, I have steer'd by to the end'?

Ah! let us make no claim,
On life's incognisable sea, 
To too exact a steering of our way;
Let us not fret and fear to miss our aim, 
If some fair coast have lured us to make stay,
Or some friend hail'd us to keep company.

Ay! we would each fain drive
At random, and not steer by rule.
Weakness! and worse, weakness bestow'd in vain 
Winds from our side the unsuiting consort rive,
We rush by coasts where we had lief remain;
Man cannot, though he would, live chance's fool.

No! as the foaming swath
Of torn-up water, on the main, 
Falls heavily away with long-drawn roar
On either side the black deep-furrow'd path
Cut by an onward-labouring vessel's prore, 
And never touches the ship-side again;

Even so we leave behind, 
As, charter'd by some unknown Powers
We stem across the sea of life by night 
The joys which were not for our use design'd;--
The friends to whom we had no natural right,
The homes that were not destined to be ours. 

The human life is marked by desire, 
A newly born desires to cry, 
An hour old desires to be fed.
A girl child desires for a doll, 
A boy child desires for a toy car.
A grown up child desires to play, 
A youth desires a lover, 
A middle aged desires for status.
An aged desires for support, 
An old aged desires for peaceful death.
You will not find none without desire, 
And if so, will not be a man. 

We sow the glebe, we reap the corn,  
 We build the house where we may rest,  
And then, at moments, suddenly,  
We look up to the great wide sky,  
Inquiring wherefore we were born-          
 For earnest or for jest?  
 
The senses folding thick and dark  
 About the stifled soul within,  
We guess diviner things beyond,  
And yearn to them with yearning fond;         
We strike out blindly to a mark  
 Believed in, but not seen.  
 
We vibrate to the pant and thrill  
 Wherewith Eternity has curled  
While, freshening upward to His feet,  
In gradual growth His full-leaved will  
 Expands from world to world.  
 
And, in the tumult and excess  
 Of act and passion under sun,         
We sometimes hear—oh, soft and far,  
As silver star did touch with star,  
The kiss of Peace and Righteousness  
 Through all things that are done.  
 
 Just on the outside of man’s dream;  
In diapason slow, we think  
To hear their pinions rise and sink,  
While they float pure beneath His eyes,  
 Like swans adown a stream.         
 
Abstractions, are they, from the forms  
 Of His great beauty?—exaltations  
From His great glory?—strong previsions  
Of what we shall be?—intuitions  
Of what we are—in calms and storms,         
 Beyond our peace and passions?  
 
Things nameless! which, in passing so,  
 Do stroke us with a subtle grace.  
We say, ‘Who passes?’—they are dumb.  
We cannot see them go or come:         
Their touches fall soft, cold, as snow  
 Upon a blind man’s face.  
 
Yet, touching so, they draw above  
 Our common thoughts to Heaven’s unknown,  
Our daily joy and pain advance         
To a divine significance,  
Our human love—O mortal love,  
 That light is not its own!  
 
And sometimes horror chills our blood  
 To be so near such mystic Things,         
And we wrap round us for defence  
Our purple manners, moods of sense—  
 Stand hidden in their wings.  
 
And sometimes through life’s heavy swound         
 We grope for them!—with strangled breath  
We stretch our hands abroad and try  
To reach them in our agony,—  
And widen, so, the broad life-wound  
 Which soon is large enough for death. 

a call came thru today
from a woman 
I hardly know who said
her girlfriends husband
hung himself
he had five children
and a wife
did it over financial strife
I gasped
then, wondered how, 
someone I didn't know
had made me feel
a mourning
''why make a drama 
out of a crisis'', I thought
then it hit me 
like, ''a ton of bricks''-
what I was feeling 
was the ''link'' 
that connects us together
as human beings. 

It is human mind
That reads nice and kind
No immorality if steps are taken
In direction to seek heaven

It is natural to seek and hide
Let our opinion not divide
We all live behind mask
But find time with good start

Why people say "love in excess is bad"? 
Why do we have worry line to make sad? 
It is not excess but natural attachment
It is different matter if one dislikes and resents

It is not supposed to be one sided
Here we can stand as divided
Nothing can be achieved through force
It shall end then in tragic end or with remorse

Lust or love makes no difference
It is sought in life at once
Whether it comes in organized way or pleasurably
It is always welcome if offered preferably

Let us consider it as weakness
Let us not bring displeasure on f ace
Let us make love as memorable part
As no one can afford to depart


Humans have the need to know
The need to know is a human trait
when it turns inward to be of no mind
it slips, spinning like a spider's thread. 

No mind in humans will then unwind
the humans trait of this need to know
to find that in Truth, they already know
then it silences the need for the need to know
into Nothingness.  

After putting everything at sake
Never knew it may otherwise
But yes it was step considered very wise

Many learned people have said in this regard 
And reformed the concept to look forward
As it has the capacity to perform miracles
It can create lot many problems too 

It can make long tunnels
Dig the whole mountain 
Cut through sea lanes
Turn foes into friends

Such are the main attributes
But alas! It is not evenly distributed
We witness to and pro cons of its usage
Sometimes feel ashamed of the young or old age

It is often said and believed
Idle mind is not relieved
From working and thinking
It may also thrust us into sinking

So it needs exposure
To make it very much sure
With fresh air in the morning
And full assessment of work in the evening 

If it is utilized at its maximum or peak
The worth of it may openly speak
Either for good part or bad 
And narrate whether to be glad or sad

If person comes out with positive aspect
It may be appreciated and command respect
There is overall and general recognition
That is want one must take as intuition


Why dose human nature 
make life a misery 
Never really knowing 
the paths you chose to lead 

For some their lives are easy 
for others not so good 
The consequences of actions 
often blind the good 

At times in life you feel 
right choices you have made 
But then you start to see 
those choices weren't meant to be 
The regrets that often stem 
From bad choices in one's life
Makes you feel unworthy 
to live a better life 

So how does one learn 
to forgive one self's mistakes 
That has hurt so many beings 
and made them weary of your plight 

Is it true what people say 
You learn from your mistakes 
are you careful not to make 
another foolish mistake 

So now I take a step 
Towards healing all my regrets 
and hope that one day 
I'll be a better human being


As the human nature knows no bounds
Many areas of left over area is found
Otherwise who cares for left over and forgotten? 
Mother has taken care of lappers and orphans even  
 
When the wind is in favor and honesty at peak
There is nothing more to appreciate or speak
The goal is scored over every adversary
 
Long live all those who live with holiness
As world has always lived with hollowness
Some may prove to be guiding star
We may have all the satisfaction even they go away very far

I salute their efforts for mankind 
We are alive and not gone blind
How do we forget their efforts and dedication? 
It is matter of satisfaction with good indication


Human nature is as such
Nothing can be done much
It is temperamentally not suiting
We may know it but still muting

We will close the eyes and pass
We will not extend hand at last
We have no sympathy for passers by
We desperately do things and other ways try

We have ready made reasons to ask for excuses
It may not solve the problems but complicate and confuse
It will increase defeatist tendencies in future
It will make you vulnerable through out life’s tenure 

"To err is human" many may argue and forward 
This is the only reason to in digest insult and fall backward
What does it indicate when you say you are helpless? 
Where as matter of fact is that you are trying only less

You are escaping every time and this makes you easy
You may think almighty is happy with you and picture is rosy
Think seriously at once what will be fate if you miss only once
You will loose everything and watch helplessly from the fence


Human nature differs
From man to man and offers
Different feeling with different angle
That decides quantum of troubles 

Some people are adding fuel to fire
Some people run to rescue and admire
Give some solace and encourage not to loose hope
Some prefer to stand by and walk along tight rope 

Noble man tries his own way
Shares the pain and stays 
Good neighbor always provides assistance
Shares the burden and provides everything at once 

Some people enjoy over the demise of enemy
Some shed tears over departure and pray to almighty
Such is the nature that helps only some one 
Wise people know everything and condemn no one 

So the good people are always preferred
Given honor and dais is offered 
He is pleased with rise of others
He is always open with help and offers


It is human nature to shed tears
Pain and agony make them to suffer and bear
Compel them to feel weary about present
Live in foolish world as if with mind so absent

The world is beyond that
We shape our destiny and fate
Something may come early or late
But maintain composure and repeatedly statue

Thre is no use if you cry in open
That may only worsen and reopen
Your past worries and stress
You will then be unable to face

Make the way out of race
Turn around and see in case
You may find world so enterprising
Many things may be there and suprising


The Sun is beaming direct ultra rays
Sea waves rising and blocking the ways
Moon is hiding face with no cool shine
Nothing seems to be going very fine

Sudden change is causing alarm
Snow bound areas are turning warm
Greenery is disappearing along with farms
You don’t feel warmth when embraced by arms

Glaciers are melting with floods so common
Volcanoes erupt with force all of sudden
Earthquakes take toll with so much destruction
Human error tragedies too----

Nothing is going on in normal way
Nature is infuriated with complete sway
She has been naked by uprooting trees
Natural holocaust is asking for free

Spreading of virus and birth of new diseases
Human misery doesn’t stop or never ceases
What we are waiting for on earth to witness? 
All able bodied human beings with weakness

We may loose complete natural resources
Helplessly we may watch all destructive forces
Nothing will be left to cry or lament upon
We may be digging grave for our own

Poisonous snakes and animals rush to population
Human hunt by them is on rise with escalation
We are inching forward for complete annihilation
This has got direct bearing on human-nature relation

How to protect and preserve our natural heritage? 
Do we consider nature and its source as vintage? 
Is nature loosing its prominence and advantage? 
Let there be any thing but it has got an edge

It is still not late to act with honest intention
We must act fast for its loss or prevention
We may survive if nature is protected
Go for remedies or plugging holes if detected


Human need

Power corrupts absolutely
It is detest humanly
But very much essential
For an individual

Human being longs for more
To secure future
For family
And members entirely 

So innovative ways are found
Like an eagle he goes around
Find good pry
And remains on constant try 

People say about divine power
But such talk only adds anger
As power and wealth have poisoned ears
Eyes refuse to see or ears to hear

No one has claimed so far
To be very far
Or free from any greed
It has always remained as need


                                    my exam; 
        please help me to clear 
                                    my arrears;

                                  his Exam. 

we never stop asking..
we never wait for HIM..
we never be satisified with what we have. 

Lets try to be more happy with what we have got already from HIM. 

Human being may never be afraid
Unless the danger is laid on path
He may certainly be frightened
Fear is developed and life is threatened

It is most dangerous sign
Man may not easily resign
He may try to put brave face
In face he has given up the chase 

Individual may love life dearly
He may venture rarely 
If that has some hidden danger
He may choose the course safe

He may think twice
Before committing with promise
The fear may stop him from doing so
He shall allow it to go 

It is human psychology
That makes him to shiver with pity
He may ask for peace 
And prefer the life to pass at ease 

The fear may take his health away
He shall try for easy way
The daring attitude has disappeared
The next moment is very much feared


Black as coffee
without the cream.
Playfully happy, 
A face that makes you beam.
Licking, Jumping, 
Lovable and so it seem
Man's best friend, 
Boys and girls dream. 

Cuddly and cute puppies
They huddle together
Puppies are not just for yuppies
Warming each other
They are for everyone of all ages
Free them from the steel cages
Love them and they will love you back
Unconditionally.
Can you become a puppy
to your human love, lack

No animals
Or humans
Can think of peace
And promise

Look at rose
And suppose
Will you spare her beauty? 
In the name of almighty

Even though it spreads fragrance
Appeals us in their presence
Yet we crush them against their wishes
And finish the existence

It is our nature
To make sure
That natural object
Never exist in their original form 

Flowers at least
With their best
Present the case
Before human race

Nature is always appealing
And repealing
Any ideas
That is wrong or false"To dig one's own grave"
Nice attempt to behave
One should be called brave
As he can claim little sense to have 

It is order of the day 
Everybody wants to have little say 
For nice effort in bringing down the tree
As we have liberty to pull it down free
 
Kill a person and get bail
Commit the scam for facilities to avail
Cause the pain and trouble the innocents
Enjoy the life and never resent

This is what we are doing today
In the name of progress all the way
Majority of people suffer and only few enjoy
Lead the life in luxury with almost decoy 

Bread and essential commodity has become rare
Two square meals now no one can dare
It is called luxury to dream and have
Men in street have nothing more to crave

We are calling for revolution 
Spend the time in passing the resolutions
It all remains in paper
People are on rampage over distribution of water

Who will bell the cat? 
Where is enough to eat? 
Grain rot in open 
Naked eyes can see it even 

We are free and democratic
Depend on figures and statistics 
Millions die daily of starvation 
Little aid reaches on the name human relation


In democracy over every Issue 
No question whether it is a lie or truth 
Prevails the tyranny of majority 
Under this   unfortunate condition 
Still the light of hope burns 
In the matter of human rights violation 
What outwardly rejected that is the majority opinion. 

I have seen birds singing in the morning
They do not fear for any warning 
They have full trust in nature for survival
How much happiness sun brings on arrival? 

It is opening of new chapter
The life to be made joyous and roar in laughter 
Each day is to be lived new challenges and outcome
Not to be afraid of any eventuality but always welcome

We need not go anywhere to seek for inspiration
It is in the fresh air when we attempt for inhalation
What a joy of freshness when lungs are filled? 
The resolve for something more with confidence is instilled 

The darkness or gloominess is removed with sunlight
It makes us to move with whatever we have as our might
It is not the limited strength but sources at disposal
Nice and swift action for result with very good proposal

As the day reaches its peak we are some where near zenith
We know for sure how much is still left the beneath
Some more confidence is needed for final push
As the sun is racing towards west with so much rush

It is time to reap the harvest in the evening
Time to return home for rest and dinning
Birds too are back returned in the nest
They have no time to think but we think always of best

We have been very lucky to be provided with sense
The atmosphere around never let us down or make tense
There is solution for everything but needs observation
Everything is there and opens for revelation

What soothing comfort in cool night? 
It is time to relax and not to think or fight
The body needs rest and ready for sleep
You may be out in seconds and fast asleep

The whole cycle is destined for good
Everybody is in need or search of food
It is got when enough efforts are made
Nothing goes in waste and it is duly paid


We may not be satisfied and seek more
New avenues or possibilities are explored
There may not be any end for desire
It will go on endlessly and not expire

There has to be some degree of contentment
Any work done should not bring resentment
It has to be strong and healthy movement
The failure or success can be at any moment

It is better to seek and love the nature
It has to be guiding principle for future
Everything thing is around and one can honorably ask
There is no need to put life at risk


Beating drums and playing trumpets
Brutalized shamans squat at the binary sides
In between the valetudinarian and 
Devil dance when night comes

A voice far away from the scene
Closed ears for the justice
Blindfolded subjects seem to be subdued
Like prisoners of deceit  

Victims and valetudinarians are
Commodity in the markets
Profit projected investors

Humanity being bargained 
Chamber of the council
Justice being balanced
Collects evidence of evil

Rights and justice
It is now in a paradigm shift
No more for the victims
It is a kind of business

But such a business
Could be a shift for transcend
Where the humanity and rights 
Are disappeared as a genocide

In a time of everything violated
No result, genuine hope of purified
Time and space may be splendid
Who would together and well mixed

This is a white magic 
A bowl of interests cooks
This is a place of power
You cannot flee for ever


The place where I live is a damp swamp space 
Here not only live human beings 
But also live cockroaches, mosquitoes and flies 
 India is her name 
If I go more specific then it is called west Bengal 
Around me is only 
Heap of mud, dust and dirt 
Along with some liars, traitors and hypocrites 
Strange, peculiar and odd things always happen 
Most bewildering thing in this place is their mind 
So superstitious are they 
If you listen to their beliefs your head will start to spin  
Take only one here, 
 They banned the cow slaughtering 
As they think it is a great sin 
But human sacrifice is not bad enough to be stopped
Rather still they believe 
Human sacrifice could bring them huge fortune


Can be called internal window
It shows status 
How much value it carries with trust 

Peron is known by his virtue
Not by religion or family value
He stands tall in public eye
Shadow should not allowed to grow more or try

The tragedy lies in human nature
It gets arrogant when honor is assured
He takes it granted for each step
Sometimes that leads to slap on face 

As the person tries to near the peak
He starts with high ideals to speak
Sometimes that grows larger than size
It lends to shameful position and capsizes

Man should confine to ordinary position
That brings near to people with good relation
It gives added weight to person’s favor
Helps to grow in relation with honor


HUMAN SHIELD

there was a field for war those days
in ramayana a hindu epic.  

the hero lord rama let go ravana
when he din't have a weapon in hand
 
when the marudhu pandiar brothers were fighting the british
at one point the marudhu brothers fled into the forest. 
a place they were very familiar with.  

a place in which
the british knew they could'nt win over the valiant brothers
 
the british took over the kalayarkoil temple near madurai.  

and
the people of that place were captured.  

and this news reached
the marudhu brothers.  

who were ACTUALLY fighting for the people
not willing to give up the cause the marudhu brothers surrendered
 
the cause was kept alive in that case. 
the marudhu brothers were hanged and their entire dynasty killed
still the cause was alive.  

then
the subjects were not used as shields.  

then
 
today ttere are people as shields for of militants in srilanka
the  srilankan military is advancing forward killing them.  

unarmed untrained killed
both the fighter and the fought are killing the cause along.

To believe 
In the deeds 
And sayings 
In which 
We increase 
The honour 
Of humanity 
Is the best definition 
Of humanism 
In which 
The best point 
To see 
How we 
Born 
Our origin 
Is it the left rib 
Of Adam 
Or the monkey? 
Is it automatic 
Or have 
Specific 
Reasons 
Or 
The question 
You leave 
Suspended 
Animation? 
It is up to
 You 
To your 
Humanism. 

The definition of humanism is too complicated 
And as diverse as the universe 
But to me it is to disbelieve 
Rather than to have a belief upon 
Ideas and notions which lower my dignity 
And curtail my freedom 
In the journey of my life 
From the time I am born till I go to grave


I may never reach even one person
That is not a reason not to try
It takes more than you know
I care about truth, about knowledge
About trying to know
So I am the one who is deluded
My humanity is stripped
I cannot be moral, trusted-saved
Just because I truly care
Aids must, and can be eliminated
Condoms are not evil
Stem cells can heal
Women are equal
Gays are equal
All are equal
Except in rationality


IT is full Winter now: the trees are bare,
     Save where the cattle huddle from the cold
   Beneath the pine, for it doth never wear
     The Autumn's gaudy livery whose gold
   Her jealous brother pilfers, but is true
   To the green doublet; bitter is the wind, as though it blew

   From Saturn's cave; a few thin wisps of hay
     Lie on the sharp black hedges, where the wain
   Dragged the sweet pillage of a summer's day
     From the low meadows up the narrow lane;
   Upon the half-thawed snow the bleating sheep
   Press close against the hurdles, and the shivering house-dogs creep

   From the shut stable to the frozen stream
     And back again disconsolate, and miss
   The bawling shepherds and the noisy team;
     And overhead in circling listlessness
   The cawing rooks whirl round the frosted stack,
   Or crowd the dripping boughs; and in the fen the ice-pools crack

   Where the gaunt bittern stalks among the reeds
     And flaps his wings, and stretches back his neck,
   And hoots to see the moon; across the meads
     Limps the poor frightened hare, a little speck;
   And a stray seamew with its fretful cry
   Flits like a sudden drift of snow against the dull grey sky.

   Full winter: and the lusty goodman brings
     His load of faggots from the chilly byre,
   And stamps his feet upon the hearth, and flings
     The sappy billets on the waning fire,
   And laughs to see the sudden lightening scare
   His children at their play; and yet,--the Spring is in the air,

   Already the slim crocus stirs the snow,
     And soon yon blanched fields will bloom again
   With nodding cowslips for some lad to mow,
     For with the first warm kisses of the rain
   The winter's icy sorrow breaks to tears,
   And the brown thrushes mate, and with bright eyes the rabbit peers

   From the dark warren where the fir-cones lie,
     And treads one snowdrop under foot, and runs
   Over the mossy knoll, and blackbirds fly
     Across our path at evening, and the suns
   Stay longer with us; ah! how good to see
   Grass-girdled Spring in all her joy of laughing greenery

   Dance through the hedges till the early rose,
     (That sweet repentance of the thorny briar!)
   Burst from its sheathed emerald and disclose
     The little quivering disk of golden fire
   Which the bees know so well, for with it come
   Pale boys-love, sops-in-wine, and daffadillies all in bloom.

   Then up and down the field the sower goes,
     While close behind the laughing younker scares
   With shrilly whoop the black and thievish crows,
     And then the chestnut-tree its glory wears,
   And on the grass the creamy blossom falls
   In odorous excess, and faint half-whispered madrigals

   Steal from the bluebells' nodding carillons
     Each breezy morn, and then white jessamine,
   That star of its own heaven, snapdragons
     With lolling crimson tongues, and eglantine
   In dusty velvets clad usurp the bed
   And woodland empery, and when the lingering rose hath shed

   Red leaf by leaf its folded panoply,
     And pansies closed their purple-lidded eyes,
   Chrysanthemums from gilded argosy
     Unload their gaudy scentless merchandise,
   And violets getting overbold withdraw
   From their shy nooks, and scarlet berries dot the leafless haw.

   O happy field! and O thrice happy tree!
   And crown of flowre-de-luce trip down the lea,
     Soon will the lazy shepherds drive their flock
   Back to the pasture by the pool, and soon
   Through the green leaves will float the hum of murmuring bees at
         noon.

   Soon will the glade be bright with bellamour,
     The flower which wantons love, and those sweet nuns
   Vale-lilies in their snowy vestiture
     Will tell their beaded pearls, and carnations
   With mitred dusky leaves will scent the wind,
   And straggling traveller's joy each hedge with yellow stars will
         bind.

   Dear Bride of Nature and most bounteous Spring!
     That can'st give increase to the sweet-breath'd kine,
   And to the kid its little horns, and bring
     The soft and silky blossoms to the vine,
   Where is that old nepenthe which of yore
   Man got from poppy root and glossy-berried mandragore!

   There was a time when any common bird
     Could make me sing in unison, a time
   When all the strings of boyish life were stirred
     To quick response or more melodious rhyme
   By every forest idyll;--do I change?
   Or rather doth some evil thing through thy fair pleasaunce range?

   Nay, nay, thou art the same: 'tis I who seek
     To vex with sighs thy simple solitude,
   And because fruitless tears bedew my cheek
     Would have thee weep with me in brotherhood;
   Fool! shall each wronged and restless spirit dare
   To taint such wine with the salt poison of his own despair!

   Thou art the same: 'tis I whose wretched soul
     Takes discontent to be its paramour,
   And gives its kingdom to the rude control
     Of what should be its servitor,--for sure
   Wisdom is somewhere, though the stormy sea
   Contain it not, and the huge deep answer ''Tis not in me.'

   To burn with one clear flame, to stand erect
     In natural honour, not to bend the knee
   In profitless prostrations whose effect
     Is by itself condemned, what alchemy
   Can teach me this? what herb Medea brewed
   Will bring the unexultant peace of essence not subdued?

   The minor chord which ends the harmony,
     And for its answering brother waits in vain,
   Sobbing for incompleted melody
     Dies a Swan's death; but I the heir of pain
   A silent Memnon with blank lidless eyes
   Wait for the light and music of those suns which never rise.

   The quenched-out torch, the lonely cypress-gloom,
     The little dust stored in the narrow urn,
   The gentle XAIPE of the Attic tomb,--
     Were not these better far than to return
   To my old fitful restless malady,
   Or spend my days within the voiceless cave of misery?

     Is like the watcher by a sick man's bed
   Who talks of sleep but gives it not; his rod
     Hath lost its virtue, and, when all is said,
   Death is too rude, too obvious a key
   To solve one single secret in a life's philosophy.

   And Love! that noble madness, whose august
     And inextinguishable might can slay
   The soul with honied drugs,--alas! I must
     From such sweet ruin play the runaway,
   Although too constant memory never can
   Forget the arched splendour of those brows Olympian

   Which for a little season made my youth
     So soft a swoon of exquisite indolence
   That all the chiding of more prudent Truth
     Seemed the thin voice of jealousy,--O Hence
   Thou huntress deadlier than Artemis!
   Go seek some other quarry! for of thy too perilous bliss

   My lips have drunk enough,--no more, no more,--
     Though Love himself should turn his gilded prow
   Back to the troubled waters of this shore
     Where I am wrecked and stranded, even now
   The chariot wheels of passion sweep too near,
   Hence! Hence! I pass unto a life more barren, more austere.

   More barren--ay, those arms will never lean
     Down through the trellised vines and draw my soul
   In sweet reluctance through the tangled green;
     Some other head must wear that aureole,
   For I am Hers who loves not any man
   Whose white and stainless bosom bears the sign Gorgonian.

   Let Venus go and chuck her dainty page,
     And kiss his mouth, and toss his curly hair,
   With net and spear and hunting equipage
     Let young Adonis to his tryst repair,
   But me her fond and subtle-fashioned spell
   Delights no more, though I could win her dearest citadel.

   Ay, though I were that laughing shepherd boy
     Who from Mount Ida saw the little cloud
   Pass over Tenedos and lofty Troy
   In wonder at her feet, not for the sake
   Of a new Helen would I bid her hand the apple take.

   Then rise supreme Athena argent-limbed!
     And, if my lips be musicless, inspire
   At least my life: was not thy glory hymned
     By One who gave to thee his sword and lyre
   Like aeschylus at well-fought Marathon,
   And died to show that Milton's England still could bear a son!

   And yet I cannot tread the Portico
     And live without desire, fear, and pain,
   Or nurture that wise calm which long ago
     The grave Athenian master taught to men,
   Self-poised, self-centred, and self-comforted,
   To watch the world's vain phantasies go by with unbowed head.

   Alas! that serene brow, those eloquent lips,
     Those eyes that mirrored all eternity,
   Rest in their own Colonos, an eclipse
     Hath come on Wisdom, and Mnemosyne
   Is childless; in the night which she had made
   For lofty secure flight Athena's owl itself hath strayed.

   Nor much with Science do I care to climb,
     Although by strange and subtle witchery
   She draw the moon from heaven: the Muse of Time
     Unrolls her gorgeous-coloured tapestry
   To no less eager eyes; often indeed
   In the great epic of Polymnia's scroll I love to read

   How Asia sent her myriad hosts to war
     Against a little town, and panoplied
   In gilded mail with jewelled scimetar,
     White-shielded, purple-crested, rode the Mede
   Between the waving poplars and the sea
   Which men call Artemisium, till he saw Thermopylae

   Its steep ravine spanned by a narrow wall,
     And on the nearer side a little brood
   Of careless lions holding festival!
     And stood amazed at such hardihood,
   And pitched his tent upon the reedy shore,
   And stayed two days to wonder, and then crept at midnight o'er

   Some unfrequented height, and coming down
     The autumn forests treacherously slew
   What Sparta held most dear and was the crown
     Of far Eurotas, and passed on, nor knew
   In the small bay of Salamis,--and yet, the page grows dim,

   Its cadenced Greek delights me not, I feel
     With such a goodly time too out of tune
   To love it much: for like the Dial's wheel
     That from its blinded darkness strikes the noon
   Yet never sees the sun, so do my eyes
   Restlessly follow that which from my cheated vision flies.

   O for one grand unselfish simple life
     To teach us what is Wisdom! speak ye hills
   Of lone Helvellyn, for this note of strife
     Shunned your untroubled crags and crystal rills,
   Where is that Spirit which living blamelessly
   Yet dared to kiss the smitten mouth of his own century!

   Speak ye Rydalian laurels! where is He
     Whose gentle head ye sheltered, that pure soul
   Whose gracious days of uncrowned majesty
     Through lowliest conduct touched the lofty goal
   Where Love and Duty mingle! Him at least
   The most high Laws were glad of, he had sat at Wisdom's feast,

   But we are Learning's changelings, know by rote
     The clarion watchword of each Grecian school
   And follow none, the flawless sword which smote
     The pagan Hydra is an effete tool
   Which we ourselves have blunted, what man now
   Shall scale the august ancient heights and to old Reverence bow?

   One such indeed I saw, but, Ichabod!
     Gone is that last dear son of Italy,
     And whose unrisen bones sleep peacefully.
   O guard him, guard him well, my Giotto's tower,
   Thou marble lily of the lily town! let not the lour

   Of the rude tempest vex his slumber, or
     The Arno with its tawny troubled gold
   O'erleap its marge, no mightier conqueror
     Clomb the high Capitol in the days of old
   When Rome was indeed Rome, for Liberty
   Walked like a Bride beside him, at which sight pale Mystery

   Fled shrieking to her farthest sombrest cell
     With an old man who grabbled rusty keys,
   Fled shuddering for that immemorial knell
     With which oblivion buries dynasties
   Swept like a wounded eagle on the blast,
   As to the holy heart of Rome the great triumvir passed.

   He knew the holiest heart and heights of Rome,
     He drave the base wolf from the lion's lair,
   And now lies dead by that empyreal dome
     Which overtops Valdarno hung in air
   By Brunelleschi--O Melpomene
   Breathe through thy melancholy pipe thy sweetest threnody!

   Breathe through the tragic stops such melodies
     That Joy's self may grow jealous, and the Nine
   Forget a-while their discreet emperies,
     Mourning for him who on Rome's lordliest shrine
   Lit for men's lives the light of Marathon,
   And bare to sun-forgotten fields the fire of the sun!

   O guard him, guard him well, my Giotto's tower,
     Let some young Florentine each eventide
   Bring coronals of that enchanted flower
     Which the dim woods of Vallombrosa hide,
   And deck the marble tomb wherein he lies
   Whose soul is as some mighty orb unseen of mortal eyes.

   Some mighty orb whose cycled wanderings,
     Being tempest-driven to the farthest rim
   Where Chaos meets Creation and the wings
     Of the eternal chanting Cherubim
   Are pavilioned on Nothing, passed away
   Into a moonless void,--and yet, though he is dust and clay,

   He is not dead, the immemorial Fates
     Forbid it, and the closing shears refrain,
   Lift up your heads ye everlasting gates!
     Ye argent clarions sound a loftier strain!
   For the vile thing he hated lurks within

   Still what avails it that she sought her cave
     That murderous mother of red harlotries?
   At Munich on the marble architrave
     The Grecian boys die smiling, but the seas
   Which wash aegina fret in loneliness
   Not mirroring their beauty, so our lives grow colourless

   For lack of our ideals, if one star
     Flame torch-like in the heavens the unjust
   Swift daylight kills it, and no trump of war
     Can wake to passionate voice the silent dust
   Which was Mazzini once! rich Niobe
   For all her stony sorrows hath her sons, but Italy!

   What Easter Day shall make her children rise,
   Shall find their graveclothes folded? what clear eyes
     Shall see them bodily? O it were meet
   To roll the stone from off the sepulchre
   And kiss the bleeding roses of their wounds, in love of Her

   Our Italy! our mother visible!
     Most blessed among nations and most sad,
   For whose dear sake the young Calabrian fell
     That day at Aspromonte and was glad
   One man could die for Liberty! but we, burnt out and cold, 

   See Honour smitten on the cheek and gyves
     Bind the sweet feet of Mercy: Poverty
   Creeps through our sunless lanes and with sharp knives
     Cuts the warm throats of children stealthily,
   And no word said:--O we are wretched men
   Unworthy of our great inheritance! where is the pen

   Of austere Milton? where the mighty sword
     Which slew its master righteously? the years
   Have lost their ancient leader, and no word
     Breaks from the voiceless tripod on our ears:
   While as a ruined mother in some spasm
   Bears a base child and loathes it, so our best enthusiasm

   Genders unlawful children, Anarchy
     Freedom's own Judas, the vile prodigal
   Licence who steals the gold of Liberty
     And yet has nothing, Ignorance the real
   One Fratricide since Cain, Envy the asp
   That stings itself to anguish, Avarice whose palsied grasp

   Is in its extent stiffened, monied Greed
     For whose dull appetite men waste away
   Amid the whirr of wheels and are the seed
     Of things which slay their sower, these each day
   Sees rife in England, and the gentle feet
   Of Beauty tread no more the stones of each unlovely street.

     By weed and worm, left to the stormy play
   Of wind and beating snow, or renovated
     By more destructful hands: Time's worst decay
   Will wreathe its ruins with some loveliness,
   But these new Vandals can but make a rainproof barrenness.

   Where is that Art which bade the Angels sing
     Through Lincoln's lofty choir, till the air
   Seems from such marble harmonies to ring
     With sweeter song than common lips can dare
   To draw from actual reed? ah! where is now
   The cunning hand which made the flowering hawthorn branches bow

   For Southwell's arch, and carved the House of One
     Who loved the lilies of the field with all
   Our dearest English flowers? the same sun
     Rises for us: the seasons natural
   Weave the same tapestry of green and grey:
   The unchanged hills are with us: but that Spirit hath passed away.

   And yet perchance it may be better so,
   Murder her brother is her bedfellow,
     And the Plague chambers with her: in obscene
   And bloody paths her treacherous feet are set;
   Better the empty desert and a soul inviolate!

   For gentle brotherhood, the harmony
     Of living in the healthful air, the swift
   Clean beauty of strong limbs when men are free
     And women chaste, these are the things which lift
   Our souls up more than even Agnolo's
   Gaunt blinded Sibyl poring o'er the scroll of human woes,

   Or Titian's little maiden on the stair
     White as her own sweet lily and as tall,
   Or Mona Lisa smiling through her hair,--
     Ah! somehow life is bigger after all
   Than any painted angel could we see

   Which curbs the passion of that level line
     Of marble youths, who with untroubled eyes
   And chastened limbs ride round Athena's shrine
     And mirror her divine economies,
   And balanced symmetry of what in man
   Would else wage ceaseless warfare,--this at least within the span

   Between our mother's kisses and the grave
     Might so inform our lives, that we could win
   Such mighty empires that from her cave
     Temptation would grow hoarse, and pallid Sin
   Would walk ashamed of his adulteries,
   And Passion creep from out the House of Lust with startled eyes.

   To make the Body and the Spirit one
     With all right things, till no thing live in vain
   From morn to noon, but in sweet unison
     With every pulse of flesh and throb of brain
   The Soul in flawless essence high enthroned,
   Against all outer vain attack invincibly bastioned,

   Mark with serene impartiality
     The strife of things, and yet be comforted,
   Knowing that by the chain causality
     All separate existences are wed
   Into one supreme whole, whose utterance
   Is joy, or holier praise! ah! surely this were governance

   Of Life in most august omnipresence,
     Through which the rational intellect would find
   In passion its expression, and mere sense,
     Ignoble else, lend fire to the mind,
   And being joined with in harmony
   More mystical than that which binds the stars planetary,

   Strike from their several tones one octave chord
     Whose cadence being measureless would fly
     Return refreshed with its new empery
   And more exultant power,--this indeed
   Could we but reach it were to find the last, the perfect creed.

   Ah! it was easy when the world was young
     To keep one's life free and inviolate,
   From our sad lips another song is rung,
     By our own hands our heads are desecrate,
   Wanderers in drear exile, and dispossessed
   Of what should be our own, we can but feed on wild unrest.

   Somehow the grace, the bloom of things has flown,
     And of all men we are most wretched who
   Must live each other's lives and not our own
     For very pity's sake and then undo
   All that we live for--it was otherwise
   When soul and body seemed to blend in mystic symphonies.

   But we have left those gentle haunts to pass
     With weary feet to the new Calvary,
   Where we behold, as one who in a glass
     Sees his own face, self-slain Humanity,
   And in the dumb reproach of that sad gaze
   Learn what an awful phantom the red hand of man can raise.

   O smitten mouth! O forehead crowned with thorn!
     O chalice of all common miseries!
   Thou for our sakes that loved thee not hast borne
     An agony of endless centuries,
   And we were vain and ignorant nor knew
   That when we stabbed thy heart it was our own real hearts we
         slew.

   Being ourselves the sowers and the seeds,
     The night that covers and the lights that fade,
   The spear that pierces and the side that bleeds,
     The lips betraying and the life betrayed;
   The deep hath calm: the moon hath rest: but we

   Is this the end of all that primal force
     Which, in its changes being still the same,
   From eyeless Chaos cleft its upward course,
     Through ravenous seas and whirling rocks and flame,
   Till the suns met in heaven and began
   Their cycles, and the morning stars sang, and the Word was Man!

   Nay, nay, we are but crucified and though
     The bloody sweat falls from our brows like rain,
   Loosen the nails--we shall come down I know,
     Staunch the red wounds--we shall be whole again,
   No need have we of hyssop-laden rod,



I came across enthusiastic person
So many dreams in life and to be realized with reasons
To undertake on the spot study about misery and plight 
To wage a war against poverty and in real terms a fight 

In his opinion it was crusade or holy war
So far he had not come out of his luxury car
He had specious villa and many servants to the service
Yes he felt like doing some noble service with promises

He used to boost me about his venture
Jokingly we may remind him about adventure
He will jump to his feet and make it sure
He will take it in no time in near future

He had heard about old people and not looked after well
Left alone by their children with horrified tell 
Full of pathetic condition and almost tears in eyes
What was left for him to decide and earnestly try? 

He took his car and preferred long drive in country yard
They were not far away but lived life substandard
Not enough to feed for family and for aged parent
They had all the curses for self only to resent 
 
"It can't be called adventure" I will pose question and satire
What you dream about can not be called as your future? 
Millions rot in same condition here
Make your thrust felt in real areas or somewhere  
 
"Some kind of interest is to be developed"
You are future hope and must think how it can be stopped 
Pick your carrier and start form grass root level
You ambition and goal may certainly speak well

He was persuaded to remain realistic
As he had not even figures which can be called statistic
He decided to look through all relative terms
And then go on with the schemes to deliver in turn 

I wished him success in life and prosper
Many people may simple dream abut and whisper
Here was person with at least some novel scheme
With no clue how to start with yet working on humanitarian theme


Religion & Atheism are like the two sides of the coin, 
Atheism preaches reason & rationale; 
Belief & faith are the essence of religion of mine, 
Both are adversaries having treasure of reason &  morale; 

World is in balance when they are in friendship; 
when all preach & practice love and common sense, 
Religion finds reason in the unquestioned worship; 
Atheism is the strong reason of the people themselves; 

Belief and atheism are always in contravention, 
But they remain the essentials of balanced pragmatism, 
Both  in harmony can prevent modern extremism, 
In proportion they form paradisal societal composition; 

Deep ideas of philosophies are difficult to imbibe, 
For some religion provides solace in their grief, 
For some atheism provides their individualistic belief, 
Both these rest on the personal faith and belief; 

Both of these for the prosperity of humanity, 
Should preach anything of mass utility; 
For everyone to practice societal values and morality, 
To live happily and prosperous with humility; 

In excess they lead to misanthropy, 
Like serene Ocean suddenly turning stormy; 
Resulting in fanatism, chaos and extremity; 
They meet at a single point of convergence, 
For  the reason of human benevolence; 


Even though they differ on law of contradictions, 
Like the laws of nature of action leading to reaction; 
Under the influence of un equal opposition, 
Society will never be in peaceful equilibrium; 

Whole of reality is too big for any ideology, 
In vain we fathom the life through theology; 
For it can be discussed only beyond the known, ironically, 
Such paradoxes are in abundance in both ideology; 

Atheism is right or wrong is within the limited reasons, 
They both are everyone’s personal belief and compulsion; 
Let us all love everyone and respect each others perception, 

No religion or atheism shall be larger than the welfare of mankind, 
All those tenets and dogmas should preach everyone to be kind, 
Neither of these should be taken too seriously to extreme mind, 
They should be instrumental to bring together everyone and bind;



Aristotle was a little man with 
eyes like a lizard, and he found a streak 
down the midst of things, a smooth place for his feet 
much more important than the carved handles 
on the coffins of the great. 


He said you should put your hand out 
at the time and place of need: 
strength matters little, he said, 
nor even speed. 


His pupil, a king's son, died 
at an early age. That Aristotle spoke of him 
it is impossible to find—the youth was 
notorious, a conqueror, a kid with a gang, 
but even this Aristotle didn't ever say. 


Around the farthest forest and along 
all the bed of the sea, Aristotle studied 
immediate, local ways. Many of which 
were wrong. So he studied poetry. 
There, in pity and fear, he found Man. 


Many thinkers today, who stand low and grin, 
have little use for anger or power, its palace 
or its prison— 
but quite a bit for that little man 
with eyes like a lizard. 

What simple profundities
What profound simplicities
To sit down among the trees
and breathe with them
in murmur brool and breeze —

And how can I trust them
who pollute the sky
with heavens
the below with hells

Well, humankind,
I’m part of you
and so my son

but neither of us
will believe
your big sad lie


Humanity and culture

Yes, father wants someone to take care
Look after
And ask or offer glass of water
That only can done be by daughter  

This is an attachment
That is with parents
They want lovely daughter
With some smile on her face

Daughter is most beautiful
In the eyes of painful parents
When they have no one to confide
Daughter rushes to take care of dad

Daughter is first choice
As she keeps promise
Mother too wants daughter
To be always by the side of her 

So daughter must follow
And grow
With father's guidance
And take chance 

Be poetess
With lovely face
And access
To humanity and culture


We have seen many ancient cultures
Through the excavated sites or in pictures
Golden past with lot more engineering skill
So many unanswered questions to fill 

So many changes have taken place with advent of time
Gradual improvement too from time to time 
Some addition and deletion of customs
Never with rigid stand on them 
 
Culture is not our future
Wrongly interpreted and made sure
No one breaks it to create another one
Even though there is scope for refined and improved one 
 
River water can remain pure
Only when it flows and detour
Culture thrives on bank
Many new have come up and many have sunk

We have learnt enough from the material
Shown to world that it existed before and not superficial
So many races disappeared in past with no trace
What we are today is the real face 

Let us prove best to the world
We can remain in cultural fold
Let it remain as identity and community mark
No more clashes over it and unnecessary sparks 

Out culture is humanity and tolerance
Peaceful living and harmonious coexistence
Time demands such an atmosphere





Humanity cries

Whether it is Islamic militant movement
Or separatists bomb attacks
The innocent public has to undergo suffering
With little in receipt of aid offerings

How many children die daily? 
For the want of medical facility
Where bullets are flying like hell
The militants have something more to add fuel

Safe passage has to be made
For people to come out of blockade
To count their dead
And for help to plead

What on earth they are doing well? 
What do they want to convey or tell? 
No civilized world shall accept genocide
On the name of religion to decide

Let the hell be rained 
Let their strength be drained
Attack more and annihilate 
They have no place on this date 

People have suffered enough
What do they talk about heaven through? 
Is there any place for giving life and taking livers? 
The humanity in street really cries"Humanity demands"
That should be our clear stand 
We long for peace
And want to leave at ease

Let there be moratorium
More space for stadiums
Where sports come up for youth
No love lost further and only words to soothe

Let us turn new leaf
As we have turned deaf
Stop the use of guns
As they are not meant for fun

There is great use of blood
As made after prolonged process of food
Let it not go as wastage
Hatred may not be wiped even after ages 

Let us build new bridge
Let the relation not freeze
Have warmth and feelings for each other
There is lot more to think and bother 

Can we create new page for good? 
Have we taken out few words and understood? 
If not, this is real time to turn the table
Life may then be only peaceful and stable 

Let us sing together and praise
Explore new goal and chase
Hands together with great resolve
We can build and certainly solve


What is there to write? 
There is one thing to fight
Express dismay at behavior
We all have become creator

We want to change world order
With lucrative offer
Follow our fold
And act as has been told 

I want to write
But do not fight
With pen
As nothing comes out of it even

I have no reason
To feel about humanity in person
It is all past story
We have nothing to show it as glory

Where are freedom fighters? 
Where are religious preachers? 
Who taught about greatness of creator? 
Led us with ideals to live with honor


All are playing the track of humanity
but humanity is at stake
ostenration is at high peak
rambling to show better before
volcanoes of death are whistling
at every step of life
threatening for death punishment
instead of life, as holding still
old values of life.

Humanity is waiting for the day
when life is rewarded
for the sake of life.

Humanity can not survive
with the selfish world.

Devoid of submission and integration
humanity is frail
awaiting for distortion.

To  make the  life  beautiful
needs to be adored beautifully. 

Humanity is lost
At tremendous cost
Good mentality is dead
We have failed to read

No hard feelings
Towards others 
As they are same
From whom we claim

Our souls have become dead and inactive
Remain unconcerned and subjective
Cheating, deception and lies
Are now parts of each family? 

We need not feel bad
And also too much sad 
As it happens in one or another form 
Child learns it as soon borne

We have no feeling
For life, death or anything
It has become customary 
Not felt essential or necessary 

Bur and forget the person 
No one has time to remember with reasons
So ling he was alive
They had every reason to believe

So think badly about utility
Of life, wealth, health and capability
Use it for welfare of poor
Some times they will remember when come to your door


I loved the named and tried to view
Asked about its existence to few
'No, we will never compromise on religion'
But same views were heard in every region
 
Yes, we have faith and shall hold
'He is the only one and savior' I was told
I did not dispute their belief
As it provided me immense relief

I was glad for one reason
His existence was recognized by everyone 
Only it spelled different name 
There was hard fight for supremacy to claim

I tried to pick thread
They were all led
By one belief
To provide the real relief

We are brethren 
So there should least concern 
Love is to rule all over
Religion must provide bond and shelter

Fine nothing wrong in it
So long love reigns and meets
The aspiration of people
With no hatred and trouble 

I saw people looking at sky
They had only one question to ask for why 
Why were they so helpless? 
Why had they all to face? 

I hoped one day they may
Get all answers and way
To live peacefully with one religion 
Humanity may be the answer for union


An intergalactic encounter, 
They arrived from a distant universe, 
Discovering we were the closest planet
Containing living creatures.

Leagues of futuristic flying mechanisms
Shade Earth from the sun
As the indestructible Space Voyagers
Collided with our infrastructure

Amidst the chaotic destruction, 
Hideous life forms emerge unscathed, 
Dripping acidic substances from an unidentifiable orifice.
They scatter and breathe devastation.

Entire cities are demolished thoroughly.
The land is mercilessly ravaged.
Earthly military forces combine, 
Attempting an assault on the invaders.

Although possessing much potency, 
The military forces cannot contend
With what appears to be thaumaturgy.
The otherworldly beings are unfathomably powerful.

Humanity’s end appears imminent.
The milieu throughout Earth is grim, 
And the terror is unimaginable.

Amidst the pandemonium which swallows the planet, 
A man stands upon a hill, 
Staring down at the carnage that is unfolding.
He falls to his knees and speaks.

"What have I done? "I went into mosque and churches 
Prayed earnestly with frantic search 
"Appear before or whisper some words" I pleaded 
"No my son, search within" replied lord

I could follow nothing’
It gave indication of something
Why was I searching some where? 
When He was around and here 

This gave me eternal joy
It was pleasant to hear and enjoy
"Give no excuse or reason for someone to annoy"
Heart is temple to see through with no decoy 

Kabir* was right in asserting 
"Follow heart dictates and never desert"
The inner call is your real strength

In fact we are great villain
Greed and unhappiness is adopted to gain
Real happiness and enjoyment is in giving 
You may feel eternal strength while forgiving 

Are we not forgetting one aspect? 
Humanity suffers from our neglect
We enjoy at the cost of others 
By giving pain and causes to bother 





Humanly advice

I commit sins
Those are not seen
Only known to me
Personally to feel free

If it is compulsion
Find some regulation
Whereby it is kept at low level
But felt at not with big curse to reveal

Let individuals speak little untruth
For survival and avoiding death
It is allowed but not in all the cases
Make no intentional mistakes

Even if you are not natural offender
Offer some prayers
At night in the bed
You will be rightly led

It is preached
And advised
To be natural human
With intent and kind man or woman


What on earth is humanly impossible? 
"The answer may be nothing" 


but may need lots of struggle
Strong resolve with full dedication
Resolute move with firm action 

It is said once and often repeated
Human mind is really equated
With fastest means available
That can lead you to conclusion 

This is possible with firm ground
If ideas is feasibly found
Mere illusory things can not be achieved
Only scientific work can be proved 

Legend says" the black headed man can do everything"
There should be clear possibility for everything 
Simple shot in air can not bring any result
The foundation for reality can certainly be built 

It may need well concerted effort
The ship can certainly be anchored at port
The wind may not be favorable 
Yet impossible can be made possible


I read and reread
And all of sudden felt as if was dead
It was burst of unbearable anger
I really thought of life in danger

There is simple saying 
Never stand alone when someone is spraying 
Words as powerful bullets
To penetrate in your mind and crash the gate

Friend  was shivering with rage
As if to make my existence on page
Never to be known to world 
And push the entire memory in cold 

What was he trying to say? 
I wondered but still tried to pay 
Some attention to his words
He was still readiness to use sword

I smiled at him with no more comment
Kept quiet and let him make some movement 
He was finding it difficult
To carry with anger that was permanently inbuilt

"What type of person is this person" he might have thought 
Not ready to exchange words with any of the reasons
I stood my ground well and responded nothing
That was the end of great battle to offer as something 

World can be won over if one remains quite cool
Not those others are unreasonable and fool
But needs some special care and attention 
With good behavior and humanly relation


Humans are not us, 
Our moods do not suit, 
Birth is desirable, 
Death is absolute.

Humanity can keep us and we keep, 
Lots of them are unhappy but we are, 
As much as solitude, and all we care
Is the happiness to use our life.

Human help is against the rule of ours, 
Good deeds must permeate our souls, 
But happiness is utilised, again I go.
Humanity did not suit us when we cared.

Humans will speak more today, 
The next day is like each for us
For we design the joke of eternity like humans 
But no. 





"Humans have developed, 
Then why not us? "
Fired the rats at me; 
When I stomped towards them, 
For the rest of my juicy plum.

You won’t believe this, guys, 
Rats have almost grounded me, 
‘Cause they cut the wires, 
When I sat down, 
For my favourite show on T. 

V! 

Women rats are filled with envy, 
At my silk dresses, 
This is truth as the day, 
 ‘Cause they stole my favourite
And gave it back in ruins! 

Disaster occurred one day, 
When Dad checked for his bills
What he found was paper crumbs, 
As if paid out in full! 
This drove him mad and after them, 
And he took in that it was of no use, 
When he gaped at his toes, 
Which were sticking out of-
His fresh set of socks! 

These rats are perfect, 
For starring Tarzan, 
See for yourself, 
If you don’t trust me, 
‘Cause they traverse, 
Through their network, 
Of our T. 

V cables! 


Didn’t they find a sharpener? 
To cut my brand new pencil? 
‘Cause when I checked for writing, 
I found it badly wounded.

Forgave them, did I
"But who wants that? "
They snapped at me, 
And what they did next was to
Eat my painting brushes.

Drove me insane, did that, 
And I went about a
Fruitless goose chase
And what they told me was
"We were only painting"

For a while, they left me, 
To feast in mother’s kitchen, 
Where she bellowed at them, 
Into my toy heaven-! 

When I woke up next day, 
After a peaceful sleep, 
A battle field, did I see
With balls and dolls, here and there! 
But what was even dreadful
Was my doll Pup’s poor nose, 
Torn apart, was her nostrils
And pulled out, was her eyes! ! 

And I bawled at my voice’s top
"Who’ll pay for her plastic surgery? ! "






Your sweetness in the nightingale, your white- ness in the swan.

You haunt my waking like a dream, my slumber like a moon, 
Pervade me like a musky scent, possess me like a tune. 

Yet, when I crave of you, my sweet, one tender moment's grace, 
You cry, "I sit behind the veil, I cannot show my face


Shall any foolish veil divide my longing from my bliss? 
Shall any fragile curtain hide your beauty from my kiss?

What war is this of Thee and Me? Give o'er the wanton strife, 
You are the heart within my heart, the life within my life. 


species, species one and all
who is smartest of them all-
domestic animals invented, breeds
caged to feed, to work, to please
for comfort and our ease, 

can they think, ache and communicate
we gathered and wandered
vast steepes, arid deserts, smokey jungles
climbed craggy cliffs, immigrated
to seashores and off shores

ranged and roamed the planet
paternal scientists became
of their fate and destiny
feed starve and eat, often make extinct
humane and humble ask, can they think


Yes nature grants you peace
To lead the life at ease
No matter what is surrounding
But thoughts are rounding

Head is clear
Stands erect without fear
For raising no banner
But to prove as healer

You are sensible person
Find some logic with reason
It is only love for country 
Simple thought even liked by almighty 

Love for land stands supreme
People too occupy position same
Why not worry for their well being? 
Some help for needy people to bring

Nature has it in abundance
Only visit in morning and avail the chance
Birds may provide lovely devotional melody 
Freedom in air to feel no worry 

Yes believe in what you can
Contribute little as ordinary man
That may carry forward the mission 
It may be called humble submission


Neither I have right to express opinion, 
Nor do I have any desire to make humble submission, 
It is just the guilt of admission, 
To ask for something can be out of question, 



Not to sway but essence to prove, 
Where not a blade of grass could move, 
Millions followed and love chariot drove, 

Love and brotherhood was never a load, 
Bestowed with message of harmony and peace, 
World would live divine light at ease, 

Every corner is gifted with many saints, 
Dead come alive and not even faint, 
Where do I have words to explain and paint? 
Still there remains one reason to point, 

Can you not make or produce hundreds more? 
Where each looks to them and simply adore, 
Where nothing is available to reach at shore, 
Can you not send great souls more and more? 

Why do we fail to catch and understand you? 
Are you not the same if different forms of THOU? 
Can’t you come once again on holy land? 
Where we see you with eyes and raise our hands? 

Do you not know whom you are sending here? 
Can’ you make some quota system there? 
Less bad but packed with more earthly man, 
This surely you have power and can? 

I may die unnatural death and meet worst fate? 
Still if you deliver, it will not be late, 
World will have no game of love and hate, 
I am here to pray and not your act to rate, 

It struck my mind to make an appeal, 
All with earnest and evils to repeal, 
You had ill treatment and worst fears, 
You could digest but still same we bear, 

We are sitting on volcano and fear annihilation, 
Nothing seems more congenial with reconciliation, 
Situation goes out of control with frequent oscillations, 
Day and night I die with dishonour and humiliation


I try with all my ability
Maintaining tact and civility
To describe my own brain
It's too hard to restrain
Despite my profound humility


He was proud that he 
perceived the strands
of everyday life, until
he met someone who
revealed the tapestry. 

Once perishing in blood I lay,
Creatures no help could give,
He saw, and bid me live. 



And all his arts employed;
That mighty Word his rage restrained,
I could not be destroyed. 

At length the time of love arrived
Then Satan, of his pow'r deprived,
Was forced to let me go. 

O can I e'er that day forget
Poor soul, my blood has paid thy debt,
And now I break thy yoke. 

Henceforth I take thee for my own,
And give myself to thee;
Forsake the idols thou hast known,
And yield thyself to me. 

Ah, worthless heart! it promised fair,
And said it would be thine;
I little thought it e'er would dare
Again with idols join. 

And pardon all that's past?
Sure, if I am not made of steel,
Thou hast prevailed at last. 

My tongue, which rashly spoke before,
This mercy will restrain;
Surely I now shall boast no more,
Nor censure, nor complain. 

humbled
our soul's remorse
he gives us a new covenant
repent

It has purpose
To create the universe
Not for the consumption of few

We are an intelligent animal
Think so much on arrival
As if He has created mistake
For remedial steps to be undertaken

Think about death
If that was not stopping your breathe 
The human beings could have threatened

Why do we think so much? 
And try to reach
At the peak level of misunderstanding 
And challenge the supreme ordering 

It is better to live with harmony
And obey the normal dictates of an almighty
No one cares for what we think or advocate 
They shall follow only when we humbly relate


I humbly serve
Even if do not deserve
As an ordinary poet
I shall never remain quiet 

Why do you think? 
And unreasonably sink
You can express views
With a logic to benefit few

I shall be glad
And never be sad 
If you can present same poem
In your way for benefit of them 

Poetry is all about imagination
Two person can not have same indication
One may always differ and feel otherwise
As lover may sometimes be called "mad" by wise 

So never collide
But confide
By heart and 
Take it as an art

Love is expression
Poetry is confession
Speak your heart freely
The field is wide open really

Why someone must be blocked? 
Unless his words derogatory and smoked
No one has right to criticize
If has nothing to oblige—After Robert Pinsky
Defier of closed space, such as the head, opener 
Of the sealed passageways, so that 
Sunlight entering the nose can once again 

Exit the ear, vaporizer, mist machine, whose 
Soft hiss sounds like another human being 

But less erratic, more stable, or, if not like a human being, 
Carried by one, by my mother to the sick chamber 
Of my childhood  as Freud said, 

Why are you always sick, Louise? his cigar 
Confusing mist with smoke, interfering 
With healingEmbodied 

Summoner of these ghosts, white plastic tub with your elegant 
Clear tub, the water sanitized by boiling, 
Sterile, odorless, 

In my mother's absence 
Run by me, the one machine 

I understand: what 
Would life be if we could not buy 
Objects to care for us 

And bear them home, away from the druggists' pity, 
If we could not carry in our own arms 
Alms, alchemy, to the safety of our bedrooms, 
If there were no more 

Sounds in the night, continuous 
Hush, hush of warm steam, not 
Like human breath though regular, if there were nothing in the world 

More hopeful than the self, 
Soothing it, wishing it well. 

Marinated air
Gripping every inch of flesh
Making foreheads cry


Viscous atmosphere
Saturates the pervious
Dampens the spirit






Humpty-dumpty, Humpty-dumpty come, come, come, 
You are looking short and round and very handsome
Play with our Kuna, Mona and our Kunai Muni, 
Show them the interesting play with lovely Tiny.

Humpty-dumpty, Humpty-dumpty go, go, go, 
Junket is waiting you don't worry for no foe.
Grandfather and grandmother are looking for you, 
Teach them everywhere the discipline by queue. 

Humpty-dumpty, Humpty-dumpty you sit, sit, sit, 
Students are waiting for you all give them a list.
Which are good which is bad saying them all? 
Teach them each how to play virtuous pure ball.

Humpty-dumpty, Humpty-dumpty show how to dump, 
Vices, greed, nonviolence, sin and unkind show hump.
How have we love peace kindness and bliss dream. 

Humpty-dumpty, humpty-dumpty sleep, sleep, sleep, 
It is the eleventh hour of confluence age, feet may slip.
People show unjust here and disobey law and order, 
You can't get peace here nice sleeping is better. 


In winter, when the fields are white,
I sing this song for your delight.

In Spring, when woods are getting green,
I'll try and tell you what I mean.

In Summer, when the days are long,
Perhaps you'll understand the song.

In Autumn, when the leaves are brown,
Take pen and ink, and write it down.

I sent a message to the fish:
I told them 'This is what I wish.'

The little fishes of the sea,
They sent an answer back to me.

The little fishes' answer was
'We cannot do it, Sir, because-'

I sent to them again to say
'It will be better to obey.'

The fishes answered, with a grin,
'Why, what a temper you are in!'

I told them once, I told them twice:
They would not listen to advice.

I took a kettle large and new,
Fit for the deed I had to do.

My heart went hop, my heart went thump:
I filled the kettle at the pump.

Then someone came to me and said
'The little fishes are in bed.'

I said to him, I said it plain,
'Then you must wake them up again.'

I said it very loud and clear:
I went and shouted in his ear.

But he was very stiff and proud:
He said 'You needn't shout so loud!'

And he was very proud and stiff:
He said 'I'd go and wake them, if-'

I took a corkscrew from the shelf:
I went to wake them up myself.

And when I found the door was locked,
I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked.

And when I found the door was shut,
I tried to turn the handle, but-Journey to the center
pulling, swirling
Energies anew
Vibration and colors
churning into one
Dark rift on
the horizon
Stars and sun align
Destruction 
Rebirth 
Enlightenment
Illumination

Hundreds of years from now, the passage
of time will have changed much.

However, for all eternity there is
one constant. One single thing that
shall never change.  Love.



And landed in my po.
Oh pss! I cried and picked it out.
An old bedraggled Crow.

What shall I do with it, I asked.
As it began to caw.
Oh, shove it down the bog, you said.
No one will ever know.

It's not much use to anyone
All it does is swear.
They may fly high to some we know
But they're really lowly liars. 

I only find within my bones, A taste for eating earth and stones. 
When I feed, I feed on air, Rocks and coals and iron ore. 
My hunger, turn. Hunger, feed: A field of bran.
Gather as you can the bright, Poison weed. 
Eat the rocks a beggar breaks, 
The stones of ancient churches' walls, 
Pebbles, children of the flood, Loaves left lying in the mud. 

* * * 

Beneath the bush a wolf will howl, Spitting bright feathers 
From his feast of fowl: Like him, I devour myself.
Waiting to be gathered, Fruits and grasses spend their hours; 
The spider spinning in the hedge, Eats only flowers.
Let me sleep! Let me boil, On the altars of Solomon; 
Let me soak the rusty soil, And flow into Kendron. 

Finally, O reason, O happiness, I cleared from the sky the blue which is darkness, and I lived as a golden spark of this light, Nature. In my delight, I made my face look as comic and as wild as I could: 

It is recovered. 
What? Eternity. 
In the whirling light 
Of the sun in the sea. 
O my eternal soul, 
Hold fast to desire 
In spite of the night 
And the day on fire. 
You must set yourself free 
From the striving of Man 
And the applause of the World! 
You must fly as you can.  
No hope, forever; No _orietur._ 
Science and patience, 
The torment is sure. 
The fire within you, 
Soft silken embers, 
Is our whole duty-- 
But no one remembers. 
It is recovered. 
What? Eternity. 
In the whirling light 
Of the sun in the sea. 


O seasons, O chateaus! Where is the flawless soul? 
I learned the magic of Felicity. It enchants us all. 
To Felicity, sing life and praise, Whenever Gaul's cock crows. 
Now all desire has gone-- It has made my life its own. 
That spell has caught heart and soul, And scattered every trial. 

O seasons, O chateaus! And, oh, the day it disappears, Will be the day I die.
O seasons, O chateaus! All that is over. Today, I know how to celebrate beauty. 

As long as there is hunger and poverty, 
how can man sleep? Should we not share
our bread with the gaunt face of the
hungry? Can we ever rest as long as one
lies their body upon an asphalt mattress? 

Should we not reach out to our brothers
and sisters of the poor? 

When? When will we all.  

do that? 


 The fisherman said: Will you have her, carelessly,
 trailing his nets and his nerves, as though his words
 sanctified the purpose with which he faced himself.
 I saw his white bone thrash his eyes.

I followed him across the sprawling sands,
 my mind thumping in the flesh's sling.
 Hope lay perhaps in burning the house I lived in.
Silence gripped my sleeves; his body clawed at the froth
his old nets had only dragged up from the seas.

In the flickering dark his lean-to opened like a wound.
The wind was I, and the days and nights before.
 Palm fronds scratched my skin. Inside the shack 
an oil lamp splayed the hours bunched to those walls.
Over and over the sticky soot crossed the space of my mind.

I heard him say: My daughter, she's just turned fifteen. 
 Feel her. I'll be back soon, your bus leaves at nine.
 The sky fell on me, and a father's exhausted wile.
Long and lean, her years were cold as rubber.
 She opened her wormy legs wide. I felt the hunger there,
the other one, the fish slithering, turning inside


Write it. Write. In ordinary ink
on ordinary paper: they were given no food,
they all died of hunger. "All. How many?
It's a big meadow. How much grass
for each one?" Write: I don't know.
History counts its skeletons in round numbers.
A thousand and one remains a thousand,
as though the one had never existed:
an imaginary embryo, an empty cradle,
an ABC never read, 
air that laughs, cries, grows,
emptiness running down steps toward the garden,
nobody's place in the line.

We stand in the meadow where it became flesh,
and the meadow is silent as a false witness.
Sunny. Green. Nearby, a forest
with wood for chewing and water under the bark-
every day a full ration of the view
until you go blind. Overhead, a bird-
the shadow of its life-giving wings
brushed their lips. Their jaws opened.
Teeth clacked against teeth.
At night, the sickle moon shone in the sky
and reaped wheat for their bread.
Hands came floating from blackened icons,
empty cups in their fingers.
On a spit of barbed wire,
a man was turning.
They sang with their mouths full of earth.
"A lovely song of how war strikes straight
at the heart

" Write: how silent.
"Yes
 





Bubbles surface to disrupt the calm
Mind can't find, the key to 
The heart's vault, where tempests
of  desires  echo.

A cold morning ray bounces off
The gleaming bonnet, acids climb up
high on  litmus of heart. 

Soft cushions
stay far, elusive as a fading horizon


A lonely dropp may be a prelude 
to rich harvest, but the time is
Now, the day is today, fingers 
desperate to snap, to grab.

Color blinded eyes, blood stained 
Gold pulled out, a leaf separated 
from tree of life, Cold stone stands
on dark fossilized dreams.

Joys grab at quick roads, that 
lead to doors of nothingness.

Hungry Mungry sat at supper,
Took his knife and spoon and fork,
Ate a bowl of mushroom soup, ate a slice of roasted pork,
Ate a dozen stewed tomatoes, twenty-seven deviled eggs,
Fifteen shrimps, nine bakes potatoes,
Thirty-two fried chicken legs,
A shank of lamb, a boiled ham,
Two bowls of grits, some black-eye peas,
Four chocolate shakes, eight angel cakes,
Nine custard pies with Muenster cheese,
Ten pots of tea, and after he,
Had eaten all that he was able,
He poured some broth on the tablecloth
And ate the kitchen table.
His parents said, 'Oh Hungry Mungry, stop these silly jokes.'
Mungry opened up his mouth, and 'Gulp,' he ate his folks.
And then he went and ate his house, all the bricks and wood,
And then he ate up all the people in the neighborhood.
Up came twenty angry policeman shouting, 'Stop and cease.'
Mungry opened his mouth and 'Gulp,' he ate the police.
Soldiers came with tanks and guns.
Said Mungry, 'They can't harm me.'
He just smiled and licked his lips and ate the U. 



The President sent all his bombers- Mungry still was calm,
Put his head back, gulped the planes, and gobbled up the bomb.
He ate his town and ate the city- ate and ate and- 
And then he said, 'I think I'll eat the whole United States.'

And so he ate Chicago first and munched the Water Tower,
And then he chewed on Pittsburgh but he found it rather sour.
He ate New York and Tennessee, and all of Boston town,
Then drank the Mississippi River just to wash it down.
And when he'd eaten every state, each puppy, boy and girl
He wiped his mouth upon his sleeve and went to eat the world.

He ate the Egypt pyramids and every church in Rome,
And all the grass in Africa and all in ice in Nome.
He ate each hill in green Brazil and then to make things worse
He decided for dessert he'd eat the universe.

He started with the moon and stars and soon as he was done
He gulped the clouds, he sipped the wind and gobbled up the sun.
Then sitting there in the cold dark air,
He started to nibble his feet,
Then his legs, then his hips
Then his neck, then his lips
Till he sat there just gnashin' his teeth
'Cause nothin' was nothin' was
Nothin' was nothin' was
Nothin' was left to eat. 

A few grains of dust more or less 
On ancient shoulders 
Locks of weakness on weary foreheads

Fears of rejection, 
Tears of dejection, 
She is an ordinary girl, 
A dark complexion! 

A few women are coming, 
To see her, 
They want a match, 
For a promising youth, 
She is excited, 
Her heart is beating, 
She is twenty nine! 

She is attractive.
She is lean and smart, 
She is educated, 
A working woman, 
A bank officer, 
She is famous for her cooking, 
She is famous for her sewing, 
She is famous for her knitting, 
Well behaved, 
Nice manners, 
Has a kind heart, 
Ready to serve, 
And helpful! 


She had made up, 
Her eyes like stars, 
She has dressed her hairs, 
Shining and silky, 
She has selected, 
The best dress she has.

At the scheduled time, 
The promising youth, 
With her mother, 
And two younger sisters, 
All having dark complexion, 
And a bulky body, 
And the belly of the youth, 
A real fun! 
Came to see her, 
They saw her, 
They talked her, 
They asked questions, 
About her job and her salary, 
And while leaving, 
The old woman said, 
Although her complexion is dark, 
Although we don't expect, 
A handsome dowry, 
Still, We select her.

After their departure, 
The girl went in her room, 
And started crying, 
She could not say her mother, 
They haven't selected me, 
They selected my income

As he moves the mine detector
A few inches over the ground,
Making it vitally float
Among the ferns and weeds,
I come into this war
Slowly, with my one brother,
Watching his face grow deep
Between the earphones,
For I can tell
If we enter the buried battle
Of Nimblewill
Only by his expression.

Softly he wanders, parting
The grass with a dreaming hand.
No dead cry yet takes root
In his clapped ears
Or can be seen in his smile.
But underfoot I feel 
The dead regroup,
The burst metals all in place,
The battle lines be drawn
Anew to include us
In Nimblewill,
And I carry the shovel and pick

More as if they were
Bright weapons that I bore.
A bird's cry breaks 
In two, and into three parts.
We cross the creek; the cry
Shifts into another,
Nearer, bird, and is
Like the shout of a shadow—
Lived-with, appallingly close—
Or the soul, pronouncing
'Nimblewill':
Three tones; your being changes.

We climb the bank;
A faint light glows
On my brother's mouth.
I listen, as two birds fight
For a single voice, but he
Must be hearing the grave,
In pieces, all singing
To his clamped head,
For he smiles as if 
He rose from the dead within
Green Nimblewill
And stood in his grandson's shape.

No shot from the buried war
Shall kill me now,
For the dead have waited here
A hundred years to create
Only the look on the face
Of my one brother,
Who stands among them, offering
A metal dish
Afloat in the trembling weeds,
With a long-buried light on his lips
At Nimblewill
And the dead outsinging two birds.

I choke the handle
Of the pick, and fall to my knees
To dig wherever he points,
To bring up mess tin or bullet,
To go underground
Still singing, myself,
Without a sound,
Like a man who renounces war,
Or one who shall lift up the past,
Not breathing 'Father,'
At Nimblewill,
But saying, 'Fathers! Fathers!



'As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled
Once, twice, and again!
And a doe leaped up -- and a doe leaped up
From the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup.
This I, scouting alone, beheld,
Once, twice, and again!

As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled
Once, twice, and again!
And a wolf stole back -- and a wolf stole back
To carry the word to the waiting Pack;
And we sought and we found and we bayed on his track
Once, twice, and again!

As the dawn was breaking the Wolf-pack yelled
Once, twice, and again!
Feet in the jungle that leave no mark!
Eyes that can see in the dark -- the dark!
Tongue -- give tongue to it! Hark! O Hark!
Once, twice, and again!



His spots are the joy of the Leopard: his horns are the Buffalo's pride -- 
Be clean, for the strength of the hunter is known by the gloss of his hide.

If ye find that the Bullock can toss you, or the heavy-browed Sambhur can gore;
Ye need not stop work to inform us; we knew it ten seasons before.

Oppress not the cubs of the stranger, but hail them as Sister and Brother,
For though they are little and fubsy, it may be the Bear is their mother.

"There is none like to me!" says the Cub in the pride of his earliest kill;
But the Jungle is large and the Cub he is small. Let him think and be still.



W HEN misty, misty mornings come,
When wild geese low are flying,
And down along the reedy marsh
The mallard drakes are crying;
When cattle leave the highest hills,
And blackbirds flock together -- 
By all these signs the hunter knows
Has come good hunting weather. 


The road seems impassible and surely hope is gone, 
Everyone else is finished; it’s a struggle to be strong, 
Why does it have to be this difficult you might say? 
Well, allow me to introduce my friend, Hupomone.
 
Actually, more of an acquaintance, we are together now, 
Steadfastness, constancy, endurance are three ways how,  
Put your tribulation in perspective by looking far beyond, 
Not swerved from deliberate purpose, faithfully moving on.

We’ll see that some seem are even getting a bigger share, 
Traveling the same distance some just pay a higher fare.

It is the biggest, longest storm you will ever have to face, 
Although it looks like it, trust you’re not alone in this race, 
Even by the greatest trial and suffering do not be swayed, 

A Greek word that means, "patient continuance" as we wait, 
By enduring with cheerfulness what a difference that makes, 
We all want storms with delectable meals and birthday cake, 
But, this one is hard to digest and desert is bitter to the taste.

Like going from London to New York on a raft not a cruise, 
The Chicago Symphony is playing Mozart you hear the blues, 
Money is bet on the best team and yet to the worst they loose, 
With your feet aching wearing too small, hand me down shoes.

Quality of character that does not allow believers to surrender, 
Another word to look up is Makrothumia they are twin brothers, 
Thankfully there aren’t any more because we don’t need another.

What’s that my Father, speak louder, who was nailed to a tree? 
I will put my best effort in top gear, thanks for grace and mercy.

Right now, you have to be determined and get in your mind, 
No matter how difficult the test you will cross the finish line, 
It may not be with arms raised overhead while standing tall, 
However, a victory is a victory even if you will have to crawl.

Hupomone & Makrothumia are not for the faint of heart, 
This combination will seriously try to rip your faith apart, 
It’s the old saying about separating the men from the boys, 
Well, here it is but when you breakthrough, oh what a joy.  

Because there is no breakthrough from questioning if it will work, 
As a casket is not buried in the ground until it is covered with dirt, 
Not one single hero in the bible or life itself became great without, 
Surviving storms of the greatest magnitude by a whimper or a shout? 

Exiting the wilderness is by faith; it’s never accomplished by chance, 
Makrothumia’s patience with people, Hupomone’s with circumstance, 
Endurance is the ability to operate w/o complaining while under attack, 
A soldier continues standing up while the quitter falls flat on their back. 



Obstacles, do come our way, normally
Barriers, confronted, as we engage on things
Constrains, experienced only when we perform
Discouragements ‘n regrets, are realities in life 
Derailments  ‘n breakdowns are eventualities 

No obstacle seem totally insurmountable 
No barrier is impenetrable in entirety
No constrain remains unsolvable at all
No discouragement 'n regret, once faced
should remain entirely unbeatable, for ever

Let willingness awake you, for a fresh day
Allow courage give strength to the new way
When determination sets in, for what ever it may
Sure, you'll accomplish your objective
even partially, at the end of the day


Sleep at noon. Window blind 
rattle and bang. Pay no mind. 
Door go jump like somebody coming: 
let him come. Tin roof drumming: 
drum away — she's drummed before. 
Blinds blow loose: unlatch the door. 
Look up sky through the manchineel: 
black show through like a hole in your heel. 
Look down shore at the old canoe: 
rag-a-tag sea turn white, turn blue, 
kick up dust in the lee of the reef, 
wallop around like a loblolly leaf. 
Let her wallop — who's afraid? 
Gale from the north-east: just the Trade . . . 

And that's when you hear it: far and high — 
sea-birds screaming down the sky 
high and far like screaming leaves; 
tree-branch slams across the eaves; 
rain like pebbles on the ground . . . 



and the sea turns white and the wind goes round. 

We stop at the dry cleaners and the grocery store   
and the gas station and the green market and   
Hurry up honey, I say, hurry,   
as she runs along two or three steps behind me   
her blue jacket unzipped and her socks rolled down.   

Where do I want her to hurry to? To her grave?   
To mine? Where one day she might stand all grown?   
Today, when all the errands are finally done, I say to her,   
Honey I'm sorry I keep saying Hurry—   
you walk ahead of me. You be the mother.   

And, Hurry up, she says, over her shoulder, looking    
back at me, laughing. Hurry up now darling, she says,   
hurry, hurry, taking the house keys from my hands. 

The time’s wheel is charged with speed
The eras like picture flash
All civilizations, culture, creed 
Down they go, turning trash.

The chariot in eternal desert sail 
Inhale-exhaling all souls mime
Infinite life cannot be trailed
Save the life’s valuable time.   

Birth and death, forever destined
Time separates the two
The beginning and end are governed by Him
The middle part for us is due

Hurry up it’s time! 
Be happy in what you owe 
Waiting long may become a crime.
Indomitable doom will gift us woe.

Yesterday
I told Hurt
Not to come
Visiting me.

Today it
Popped in
Again to say
‘Hi' to me.

I retorted: 
You are such
An ugly, 
Unwelcome guest.

It winked
And said: 
Don't you
Know ;) 
I'm the
Common
Household
Pest -
That thrives
In every home
And family-
It's not just
You and me


you are beautiful but why
do i cry at night and day
because you cheated on me
you took my heart away from
me that is no good so ill stay
away and never love again 




I sit here and cry
Tears I thought were gone
My heart breaks
When I thought I no longer had a heart

You brought back the tears
You dug up my heart
All without my permission
And now you toss them aside

Do you have any idea what you've done? 
Do you even care? 
Do you know you captured my soul? 
You held it like a rose holds a dropp of dew

And like that dropp it was unique
Once destroyed never to be replaced
A single, beautiful, precious drop
Once gone never to be seen again



I

The broken pillar of the wing jags from the clotted shoulder,
The wing trails like a banner in defeat, 

No more to use the sky forever but live with famine
And pain a few days: cat nor coyote
Will shorten the week of waiting for death, there is game without talons.

He stands under the oak-bush and waits 
The lame feet of salvation; at night he remembers freedom
And flies in a dream, the dawns ruin it. 

He is strong and pain is worse to the strong, incapacity is worse.
The curs of the day come and torment him
At distance, no one but death the redeemer will humble that head, 

The intrepid readiness, the terrible eyes. 
That ask mercy, not often to the arrogant. 

You do not know him, you communal people, or you have forgotten him; 
Intemperate and savage, the hawk remembers him;
Beautiful and wild, the hawks, and men that are dying, remember him.

                                II

I'd sooner, except the penalties, kill a man than a hawk; 
but the great redtail
Had nothing left but unable misery
From the bone too shattered for mending, the wing that trailed under his talons when he moved. 

We had fed him six weeks, I gave him freedom,
He wandered over the foreland hill and returned in the evening, asking for death,
Not like a beggar, still eyed with the old
Implacable arrogance. 

I gave him the lead gift in the twilight.
What fell was relaxed, Owl-downy, soft feminine feathers; but what
Soared: the fierce rush: the night-herons by the flooded river cried fear at its rising
Before it was quite unsheathed from reality. 


Seeing a loved one suffer, 
Cuts my heart quite deeper.
Especially when I can foresee, 
None I can do to set her free.

Sometimes fate is cruel, 
Pins us down to a duel.
No matter what we try to do? 
Somehow, we can not let go.

As I witness to feel sorrow, 
I pray there still tomorrow.
And our present tribulation, 
Becomes a blissful situation.

What can I do to deter, 
All difficulties and get better.
Should I make a drastic move, 
Beyond what is consider good? 

Nah, I will stand by the fact, 
All things are relatively tact.
What has man sows today, 
Same shall he reaps one day. 

Depression hurts
inside and out.

On the inside your heart tears
And it starts to bleed, 
You feel the pain
And you have the need.

Outside you drag the knife
Accross bare flesh, 
You feel the relief
But the scars are sketched.

Back inside you cry
Because the marks will remain, 
But you're also calm now
and feel no pain.

Depression hurts
No matter what
Depression follows
Even after the cuts.

Depression may go, 
but the memories will stay forever. 



no dispute about it, marvin boy
realities hurt

but what hurt worse
are illusions

what hurt worst
are delusions about the grandeur

that was never therefor Argee Atienza

I am the bow
you are the arrow

by my arm
you are the sling

together we aim
ideal home of life

I am the Husband
you are the Wife


Hush! Ascetic in the wavy cowl
Holding forth the life's bowl.! 




hush my darling, listen to our hearts. 
as they beat as one. In the stillness
of this quiet time.  

can you see the gift
of yesterdays and the promise of tomorrow? 
Can you hear the choir of the angels, 
as they sing their songs of love? 

Hush.  

can you hear my muted words of
love and caring? Can you feel my soul. 
as it merges with yours? 

Hush.  

as the wind plays in the trees and
the rain falls gently, as it plops against the
window and dances on the roof.

Hush.  

our baby sleeps and a distant violin, 
plays softly in night. The cat.  

upon the bed. 
and the dog is quiet.  and close by.

Hush.  

discover the secrets of the silence
of the night. Can you feel that we are one
with the rain.  

and the night.  

and all we
can see.  

or not? 

Hush my darling.  

as I drink you in and tell you
of my love. Hush.  

as we melt together.  

and
drift peacefully in the night.

Hush.  

hush.  

hush.  

and good night.



Ultimately depriving me of words to talk.
Someday, Some way, I'll make muteness a choice.
'Hush' will no longer be the word with which I walk. 

HUSH'D be the camps to-day;
   And, soldiers, let us drape our war-worn weapons;
   And each with musing soul retire, to celebrate,
   Our dear commander's death.

   No more for him life's stormy conflicts;
   Nor victory, nor defeat--no more time's dark events,
   Charging like ceaseless clouds across the sky.


   But sing, poet, in our name;
   Sing of the love we bore him--because you, dweller in camps, know it
         truly.





of her arms, this was her sin: 
where the wood berries bin 
of forest was new and full, 
she crept out by its tall 
posts, those wooden legs, 
and heard the sound of wild pigs. 
calling and did not wait nor care. 
The leaves wept in her hair 
as she sank to a pit of needles 
and twisted out the ivyless 
gate, where the wood berries bin 
was full and a pig came in. 






Is that an attitude for a flower, to stand 
like a club at the walk; poor slain boy, 
is that a way to show 
gratitude to the gods? White 
with colored hearts, the tall flowers 
sway around you, all the other boys, 
in the cold spring, as the violets open. 

         There were no flowers in antiquity 
but boys' bodies, pale, perfectly imagined. 
So the gods sank to human shape with longing. 
In the field, in the willow grove, 
Apollo sent the courtiers away. 

         And from the blood of the wound 
a flower sprang, lilylike, more brilliant 
than the purples of Tyre. 
Then the god wept: his vital grief 
flooded the earth. 

         Beauty dies: that is the source 
of creation. Outside the ring of trees 
the courtiers could hear 
the dove's call transmit 
its uniform, its inborn sorrow— 
They stood listening, among the rustling willows. 
Was this the god's lament? 
They listened carefully. And for a short time 
all sound was sad. 

         There is no other immortality: 
in the cold spring, the purple violets open. 
And yet, the heart is black, 
there is its violence frankly exposed. 
Or is it not the heart at the center 
but some other word? 
And now someone is bending over them, 
meaning to gather them— 

         They could not wait 
in exile forever. 
Through the glittering grove 
the courtiers ran 
calling the name 
of their companion 
over the birds' noise, 
over the willows' aimless sadness. 
Well into the night they wept, 
their clear tears 
altering no earthly color.

Song of the Hydrographer

If, as you set sail, you take note of the flash
Of a lighthouse to mark the way
You will know it to be our desire
That you never sail alone. 

By June our brook's run out of song and speed.
Sought for much after that, it will be found
Either to have gone groping underground
(And taken with it all the Hyla breed
That shouted in the mist a month ago,
Like ghost of sleigh-bells in a ghost of snow)--
Or flourished and come up in jewel-weed,
Weak foliage that is blown upon and bent
Even against the way its waters went.
Its bed is left a faded paper sheet
Of dead leaves stuck together by the heat--
A brook to none but who remember long.
This as it will be seen is other far
Than with brooks taken otherwhere in song.
We love the things we love for what they are. 



Since I am coming to that holy room,
         Where, with thy choir of saints for evermore,
     I shall be made thy music; as I come
         I tune the instrument here at the door,
         And what I must do then, think here before.

     Whilst my physicians by their love are grown
         Cosmographers, and I their map, who lie
     Flat on this bed, that by them may be shown
         That this is my south-west discovery,
       [lang l]Per fretum febris[lang e], by these straits to die,

       I joy, that in these straits I see my west; 
       For, though their currents yield return to none,
   What shall my west hurt me? As west and east
       In all flat maps (and I am one)  are one,
       So death doth touch the resurrection.

   Is the Pacific Sea my home? Or are
       The eastern riches? Is Jerusalem? 
   Anyan, and Magellan, and Gibraltar,
       All straits, and none but straits, are ways to them,
       Whether where Japhet dwelt, or Cham, or Shem.

   We think that Paradise and Calvary,
       As the first Adam's sweat surrounds my face,
       May the last Adam's blood my soul embrace.

       By these his thorns, give me his other crown; 
   And as to others' souls I preach'd thy word,
       Be this my text, my sermon to mine own:
when I was first asked to bed.



          And after a day's and night's deliberation, accepted. That was me: nothing on a whim back then.  Everything thought through. I had for months been resorting morals to clear the way for love's approach. But no one came.  All my college friends saw me as I saw myself: completely unbeautiful,  completely lost in logic's cold embrace.

          How stiffly I sat on his couch -  a statue with sweaty palms. Unable the first date to even touch back, I had to learn from distrust of any hand all the way to lovemaking - a crash course in six weeks - until I would allow him to enter
           And pound that hot sweet pain into me, 
           Pound to the music of moans, 
           Cracking the husk of childhood, 
           To release the pulp of woman: 
           Stone-ground blood flow. 


At morn- at noon- at twilight dim-
       Maria! thou hast heard my hymn!
       In joy and woe- in good and ill-
       When the hours flew brightly by,
       And not a cloud obscured the sky,
       My soul, lest it should truant be,
       Thy grace did guide to thine and thee;
       Now, when storms of Fate o'ercast
       Darkly my Present and my Past,
       Let my Future radiant shine
       With sweet hopes of thee and thine

A new song to the Lamb that was slain.



Behold the glories of the Lamb
Amidst his Father's throne;
Prepare new honors for his name,
And songs before unknown.

Let elders worship at his feet,
The church adore around,
With vials full of odors sweet,
And harps of sweeter sound.

Those are the prayers of the saints,
And these the hymns they raise,
He loves to hear our praise.

[Eternal Father, who shall look
Into thy secret will?
Who but the Son shall take that book,
And open every sea]?

He shall fulfil thy great decrees,
The Son deserves it well:
Lo! in his hand the sovereign keys
Of heav'n, and death, and hell!]

Now to the Lamb that once was slain
Be endless blessings paid;
Salvation, glory, joy, remain
For ever on thy head.

Thou hast redeemed our souls with blood,
Hast set the pris'ners free;
And we shall reign with thee.

The worlds of nature and of grace
Are put beneath thy power;
Then shorten these delaying days,
And bring the promised hour. 

Believe and be saved.




Not to condemn the sons of men,
No weapons in his hands are seen,
No flaming sword nor thunder there.

He loved the race of man so well,
He sent his Son to bear our load
Of sins, and save our souls from hell.

Sinners, believe the Savior's word,
Trust in his mighty name and live;
A thousand joys his lips afford,
His hands a thousand blessings give.

But vengeance and damnation lies
On rebels who refuse the grace;
The hottest hell shall be their place. 

Rise, O my soul! with thy desires to heaven,
And with divinest contemplation use
Thy time, when time's eternity is given, 
And let vain thoughts no more thy thoughts abuse;
But down in darkness let them lie;
So live thy better, let thy worse thoughts die.

And thou, my soul, inspired with holy flame,
View and review with most regardful eye
That holy cross whence thy salvation came,
On which thy Saviour and thy sin did die!
For in the sacred object is much pleasure,
And in that Saviour is my life treasure.

To Thee, O Jesu! I direct mine eyes,
To Thee my hands, to Thee my humble knees;
To Thee my heart shall offer sacrifice;
To Thee my thoughts, who thoughts only see; 
To Thee myself, myself and all I give;
To Thee I die, to Thee I only live. 

OH, Thou! before whose radiant shrine,
Entranc'd, adoring seraphs bend;
Eternal source of light divine!
Wilt Thou thy hallow'd ear incline!
And mortal pray'r attend?
Yes, Father! yes, benignant Pow'r!
Around Thee beams fair Mercy's purest ray;
No awful terrors round Thee low'r,
Save when, in Judgment's dreaded hour,
Thou bidst Creation tremble and obey!

Then, rob'd in darkness and in clouds,
That solemn veil thy glory shrouds;
Chaos and night thy dark pavilion form;
Thy spirit on the whirlwind rides,
Impels the unresisting tides,
Glares in the lightning, rushes in the storm!

But Thou wilt meet the suppliant eye,
And Thou wilt mark the lowly sigh;
And Thou the holy tear wilt see,
Which penitence devotes to Thee;
That sigh thy breezes waft to heav'n,
That holy tear is grateful incense giv'n
Low, humble, sad, to Thee I bend,
Oh! listen from thy blest abode!
And though celestial hymns ascend,
Oh! deign a mortal's prayer attend,

Teach me if hope, if joy, be mine,
To bless thy bounteous hand divine;
And still, with trembling homage, raise
The grateful paean of exalted praise!

When deep affliction wounds my soul,
Still let me own thy mild control;
Teach me, submissive and resign'd,
To calm the tempest of the mind;
To lift the meek, adoring eye,
Suppress the tear and hush the sigh;
Gaze on one bright, unclouded star,
And hail 'the day-spring' from afar,
Bid angel-faith dispel surrounding gloom,
And soar, on cherub-wing—beyond the tomb. 

THE spacious firmament on high, 
With all the blue ethereal sky, 
And spangled heavens, a shining frame, 
Their great Original proclaim. 
Th' unwearied Sun from day to day 
Does his Creator's power display; 
And publishes to every land 
The work of an Almighty hand. 

Soon as the evening shades prevail, 
The Moon takes up the wondrous tale; 
And nightly to the listening Earth 
Repeats the story of her birth: 
Whilst all the stars that round her burn, 
And all the planets in their turn, 
Confirm the tidings as they roll, 
And spread the truth from pole to pole. 

What though in solemn silence all 
Move round the dark terrestrial ball; 
What though nor real voice nor sound 
Amidst their radiant orbs be found? 
In Reason's ear they all rejoice, 
And utter forth a glorious voice; 
For ever singing as they shine, 
'The Hand that made us is divine.

'To the too-dear, to the too-beautiful,
who fills my heart with clarity,
to the angel, to the immortal idol,
All hail, in immortality!
She flows through my reality,
air, mixed with the salt sea-swell:
into my soul’s ecstasy,
pours the essence of the eternal;
Ever-fresh sachet, that scents
the dear corner’s atmospheric light,
hidden smoke, of the burning censer,
in the secret paths of night.
How, incorruptible love,
to express your endless verities?
Grain of musk, unseen, above,
in the depths of my infinities!
To the too-dear, to the too-beautiful,
who is my joy and sanity,
to the angel, to the immortal idol,
All hail in immortality


Cor.  

How heavy is the night
That hangs upon our eyes,
Over our souls arise!

Our guilty spirits dread
To meet the wrath of Heav'n;
But, in his righteousness arrayed,
We see our sins forgiv'n.

Unholy and impure
Are all our thoughts and ways;
His hands infected nature cure
With sanctifying grace.

The powers of hell agree
To hold our souls in vain;
He sets the sons of bondage free,
And breaks the cursed chain

Thy sovereign power, thy healing grace,
And thine atoning blood. 

Stones made children of Abraham.

Matt.  

Vain are the hopes that rebels place
Upon their birth and blood,
Descended from a pious race;

He from the caves of earth and hell
Can take the hardest stones,
And fill the house of Abram well
With new-created sons.

Such wondrous power doth he possess
Who formed our mortal frame,
Who called the world from emptiness,
The world obeyed and came. 

The earth is full of anger,
 The seas are dark with wrath,
The Nations in their harness
 Go up against our path:
Ere yet we loose the legions --
 Ere yet we draw the blade,
 
High lust and froward bearing,
 Proud heart, rebellious brow --
Deaf ear and soul uncaring,
 We seek Thy mercy now!
The sinner that forswore Thee,
 The fool that passed Thee by,
Our times are known before Thee --
 
For those who kneel beside us
 At altars not Thine own,
Who lack the lights that guide us,
If wrong we did to call them,
 By honour bound they came;
Let not Thy Wrath befall them,
 But deal to us the blame.
 
From panic, pride, and terror,
 Revenge that knows no rein,
Light haste and lawless error,
 Protect us yet again.
Cloak Thou our undeserving,
 Make firm the shuddering breath,
In silence and unswerving
 To taste Thy lesser death!
 
Ah, Mary pierced with sorrow,
 Remember, reach and save
The soul that comes to-morrow
Since each was born of woman,
 For each at utter need --
True comrade and true foeman --
 Madonna, intercede!
 
E'en now their vanguard gathers,
 E'en now we face the fray --
As Thou didst help our fathers,
 Help Thou our host to-day!
Fulfilled of signs and wonders,
 In life, in death made clear --



Hast thou a charm to stay the morning-star
   In his steep course? So long he seems to pause
   On thy bald awful head, O sovran BLANC,
   The Arve and Arveiron at thy base
   Rave ceaselessly; but thou, most awful Form!
   Risest from forth thy silent sea of pines,
   How silently! Around thee and above
   Deep is the air and dark, substantial, black,
   An ebon mass: methinks thou piercest it,
  As with a wedge! But when I look again,
  It is thine own calm home, thy crystal shrine,
  Thy habitation from eternity!
  O dread and silent Mount! I gazed upon thee,
  Till thou, still present to the bodily sense,
  Didst vanish from my thought: entranced in prayer
  I worshipped the Invisible alone.

     Yet, like some sweet beguiling melody,
  So sweet, we know not we are listening to it,
  Thou, the meanwhile, wast blending with my Thought,
  Yea, with my Life and Life's own secret joy:
  Till the dilating Soul, enrapt, transfused,
  Into the mighty vision passing--there
  As in her natural form, swelled vast to Heaven!

     Awake, my soul! not only passive praise
  Thou owest! not alone these swelling tears,
  Mute thanks and secret ecstasy! Awake,
  Voice of sweet song! Awake, my heart, awake!
  Green vales and icy cliffs, all join my Hymn.

     Thou first and chief, sole sovereign of the Vale!
  O struggling with the darkness all the night,
  And visited all night by troops of stars,
  Or when they climb the sky or when they sink:
  Companion of the morning-star at dawn,
  Thyself Earth's rosy star, and of the dawn
  Co-herald: wake, O wake, and utter praise!
  Who sank thy sunless pillars deep in Earth?
  Who filled thy countenance with rosy light?
  Who made thee parent of perpetual streams?

     And you, ye five wild torrents fiercely glad!
  Who called you forth from night and utter death,
  From dark and icy caverns called you forth,
  Down those precipitous, black, jagged rocks,
  For ever shattered and the same for ever?
  Who gave you your invulnerable life,
  Your strength, your speed, your fury, and your joy,
  Unceasing thunder and eternal foam?
  And who commanded (and the silence came),
  Here let the billows stiffen, and have rest?

     Ye Ice-falls! ye that from the mountain's brow
  Adown enormous ravines slope amain--
  Torrents, methinks, that heard a mighty voice,
  And stopped at once amid their maddest plunge!
  Motionless torrents! silent cataracts!
  Who made your glorious as the Gates of Heaven
  Beneath the keen full moon? Who bade the sun
  Clothe you with rainbows? Who, with living flowers
  Of loveliest blue, spread garlands at your feet?--
  Ye pine-groves, with your soft and soul-like sounds!
  And they too have a voice, yon piles of snow,

     Ye living flowers that skirt the eternal frost!
  Ye wild goats sporting round the eagle's nest!
  Yet eagles, play-mates of the mountain-storm!
  Ye lightnings, the dread arrows of the clouds!
  Ye signs and wonders of the element!

     Thou too, hoar Mount! with thy sky-pointing peaks,
  Oft from whose feet the avalanche, unheard,
  Shoots downward, glittering through the pure serene
  Into the depth of clouds, that veil thy breast--
  Thou too again, stupendous Mountain! thou
  That as I raise my head, awhile bowed low
  In adoration, upward from thy base
  Slow travelling with dim eyes suffused with tears,
  Solemnly seemest, like a vapoury cloud,
  To rise before me--Rise, O ever rise,
  Rise like a cloud of incense from the Earth!
  Thou kingly Spirit throned among the hills,
  Thou dread ambassador from Earth to Heaven,
  Great Hierarch! tell thou the silent sky,
  And tell the stars, and tell yon rising sun



Suppliant now before You, 
Our Father, from Your children's plea 
Turn not, we implore You! 

From the depths implore You; 
Our Father, let us not, this day, 
Cry in vain before You. 

All our sins before You; 
Our Father, for Your Mercy's sake, 
Pardon, we implore You. 

Prayers and tears implore You; 
Our Father, take the gift we lay, 
Contrite hearts, before You. 

Gather them before You; 
Our Father, let Your shepherd love 
Guide us, we implore You. 

That in truth, implore You; 
Our Father, let our evening prayer 
Now find grace before You. 

Suppliant now before You; 
Our Father, from Your children's plea 
Turn not, we implore You

If thou wouldst perfect be,
Sell all thou hast and give it to the poor,
And come and follow me!' 

Those sacred words hath said,
And his invisible hands to-day have been
Laid on a young man's head. 

And evermore beside him on his way
That he may lean upon his arm and say,

Beside him at the marriage feast shall be,
To make the scene more fair;
Beside him in the dark GetHomemane
Of pain and midnight prayer. 

O holy trust! O endless sense of rest!
Like the beloved John
To lay his head upon the Saviour's breast,
And thus to journey on

O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer's praise,
The triumphs of his grace! 

Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honours of thy name. 

That bids our sorrows cease;
'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
'Tis life, and health, and peace. 

He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean,
His blood availed for me. 

He speaks, and, listening to his voice,
New life the dead receive,
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
The humble poor believe. 

Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Saviour come,
And leap, ye lame, for joy. 

Look unto him, ye nations, own
Look, and be saved through faith alone,
Be justified by grace. 

His soul was once an offering made
For every soul of man. 

Awake from guilty nature's sleep,
Cast all your sins into the deep,
And wash the aethiop white. 

With me, your chief, ye then shall know,
Shall feel your sins forgiven;
Anticipate your heaven below,
And own that love is heaven. 

Come, sinners, to the gospel feast,
Let every soul be Jesu's guest;
Ye need not one be left behind,

The invitation is to ALL:
Come, all the world; come, sinner, thou!

Come, all ye souls by sin opprest,
Ye restless wanderers after rest,
Ye poor, and maimed, and halt, and blind,

Come, and partake the gospel feast;
And eat his flesh, and drink his blood! 

Ye vagrant souls, on you I call;
(O that my voice could reach you all!)
Ye all may now be justified,

O let his love your hearts constrain,
Nor suffer him to die in vain! 

His love is mighty to compel;
His conquering love consent to feel,
Yield to his love's resistless power,

See him set forth before your eyes,
That precious, bleeding sacrifice!
His offered benefits embrace,
And freely now be saved by grace. 

This is the time; no more delay!
This is the acceptable day,
Come in, this moment, at his call,
And live for him who died for all. 

He utters a cry, Ye sinners, give ear!
From hell to retrieve you He spreads out his hands;
Now, now to receive you, He graciously stands. 

If any man thirst, And happy would be,
The vilest and worst May come unto me,
May drink of my Spirit, Excepted is none,
Lay claim to my merit, And take for his own. 

Whoever receives The life-giving word,
In him a pure river Of life shall arise,
Shall in the believer Spring up to the skies. 

My soul on thy word Of promise I stay,
Thy kind invitation I gladly embrace,
Athirst for salvation, Salvation by grace. 

O hasten the hour! Send down from above
The Spirit of power, Of health, and of love,
Of filial fear, Of knowledge and grace,
Of wisdom and prayer, Of joy and of praise;
The Spirit of faith, Of faith in thy blood,
Removes the huge mountain Of indwelling sin,
And opens a fountain That washes us clean. 

Ho! every one that thirsts, draw nigh!
Mercy and free salvation buy;
Buy wine, and milk, and gospel grace. 

Come to the living waters, come!
Sinners, obey your Maker's call;
Return, ye weary wanderers, home,
And find my grace is free for all. 

See from the Rock a fountain rise!
For you in healing streams it rolls;
Money ye need not bring, nor price,
Ye labouring, burdened, sin-sick souls. 

Nothing ye in exchange shall give,
Leave all you have and are behind,

Why seek ye that which is not bread,
Nor can your hungry souls sustain?
On ashes, husks, and air ye feed;
Ye spend your little all in vain. 

In search of empty joys below,
Ye toil with unavailing strife;
Whither, ah! whither would ye go?
I have the words of endless life. 

Hearken to me with earnest care,
And freely eat substantial food,
The sweetness of my mercy share,
And taste that I alone am good. 

I bid you all my goodness prove,
My promises for all are free,
Come, taste the manna of my love,
And let your souls delight in me. 

Your willing ear and heart incline,
My words believingly receive;
Quickened your souls by faith divine
An everlasting life shall live. 

Sinners, obey the gospel-word!
Be wise to know your gracious day;
All things are ready, come away! 

Ready the Father is to own
And kiss his late-returning son;
Ready your loving Saviour stands,
And spreads for you his bleeding hands. 

Ready the Spirit of his love
Just now the stony to remove,
To apply, and witness with the blood,

Ready for you the angels wait,
To triumph in your blest estate;
Tuning their harps, they long to praise
The wonders of redeeming grace. 

The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
Is ready, with their shining host:
All heaven is ready to resound,
"The dead's alive! the lost is found!" 

His proffered benefits embrace,
The plenitude of gospel grace: 

A pardon written with his blood,
The seeing eye, the feeling sense,
The mystic joys of penitence; 

The godly grief, the pleasing smart,
The meltings of a broken heart,
The tears that tell your sins forgiven,
The sighs that waft your souls to heaven; 

The guiltless shame, the sweet distress,
The unutterable tenderness,
The genuine, meek humility,
The wonder, "Why such love to me?" 

The o'erwhelming power of saving grace,
The sight that veils the seraph's face;
The speechless awe that dares not move,
And all the silent heaven of love. 



I.
The sleepless Hours who watch me as I lie,
Curtained with star-inwoven tapestries,
From the broad moonlight of the sky,
Fanning the busy dreams from my dim eyes,--
Waken me when their Mother, the gray Dawn,
Tells them that dreams and that the moon is gone.

II.
Then I arise, and climbing Heaven's blue dome,
I walk over the mountains and the waves,
Leaving my robe upon the ocean foam;
My footsteps pave the clouds with fire; the caves
Are filled with my bright presence, and the air
Leaves the green Earth to my embraces bare.

III.
The sunbeams are my shafts, with which I kill
Deceit, that loves the night and fears the day;
All men who do or even imagine ill
Fly me, and from the glory of my ray
Good minds and open actions take new might,
Until diminished by the reign of Night.

IV.
I feed the clouds, the rainbows, and the flowers,
With their ethereal colors; the Moon's globe,
And the pure stars in their eternal bowers,
Are cinctured with my power as with a robe;
Whatever lamps on Earth or Heaven may shine,
Are portions of one power, which is mine.

V.
I stand at noon upon the peak of Heaven;
Then with unwilling steps I wander down
Into the clouds of the Atlantic even;
For grief that I depart they weep and frown:
What look is more delightful than the smile
With which I soothe them from the western isle?

VI.
I am the eye with which the Universe
Beholds itself, and knows it is divine;
All harmony of instrument or verse,
All prophecy, all medicine, is mine,
All light of art or nature; - to my song
Victory and praise in its own right belong. 



THE careful text-books measure
(Let all who build beware!) 
The load, the shock, the pressure
Material can bear. 
So, when the buckled girder
Lets down the grinding span, 
'The blame of loss, or murder, 
Is laid upon the man. 
Not on  the Stuff - the Man!

But in our daily dealing 
With stone and steel, we find

Of justice toward mankind. 
To no set gauge they make us- 
For no laid course prepare-
And presently o'ertake us
With loads we cannot bear: 
Too merciless to bear.  

The prudent text-books give it 
In tables at the end
'The stress that shears a rivet 
Or makes a tie-bar bend-
'What traffic wrecks macadam-
What concrete should endure-
but we, poor Sons of Adam
Have no such literature,
To warn us or make sure! 

We hold all Earth to plunder -
All Time and Space as well-
Too wonder-stale to wonder
At each new miracle;
Till, in the mid-illusion
Falls multiple confusion
On all we did or planned-
 The mighty works we planned.  

We only of Creation
(, luckier bridge and rail) 
Abide the twin damnation-    
To fail and know we fail.
Yet we - by which sole token
Take shame in being broken
However great the odds-
The burden of the Odds. 

Oh, veiled and secret Power
Whose paths we seek in vain,
Be with us in our hour
Of overthrow and pain;
That we - by which sure token
We know Thy ways are true -
In spite of being broken,
Because of being broken
May rise and build anew
Stand up and build anew. 



In the grey beginning of years, in the twilight of things that began,
The word of the earth to the spheres her sisters, the note of her song,
The sound of her speech in the ears of the starry and sisterly throng,
Was it praise or passion or prayer, was it love or devotion or dread,
When the veils of the shining air first wrapt her jubilant head?
When her eyes new-born of the night saw yet no star out of reach;
When her maiden mouth was alight with the flame of musical speech;
When her virgin feet were set on the terrible heavenly way,
And her virginal lids were wet with the dew of the birth of the day:
Eyes that had looked not on time, and ears that had heard not of death;
Lips that had learnt not the rhyme of change and passionate breath,
The rhythmic anguish of growth, and the motion of mutable things,
Of love that longs and is loth, and plume-plucked hope without wings,
Passions and pains without number, and life that runs and is lame,
From slumber again to slumber, the same race set for the same,
Where the runners outwear each other, but running with lampless hands
No man takes light from his brother till blind at the goal he stands:
Ah, did they know, did they dream of it, counting the cost and the worth?
The ways of her days, did they seem then good to the new-souled earth?
Did her heart rejoice, and the might of her spirit exult in her then,
Child yet no child of the night, and motherless mother of men?
Was it Love brake forth flower-fashion, a bird with gold on his wings,
Lovely, her firstborn passion, and impulse of firstborn things?
Was Love that nestling indeed that under the plumes of the night
Was hatched and hidden as seed in the furrow, and brought forth bright?
Was it Love lay shut in the shell world-shaped, having over him there
Black world-wide wings that impel the might of the night through air?
And bursting his shell as a bird, night shook through her sail-stretched vans,
And her heart as a water was stirred, and its heat was the firstborn man's.
For the waste of the dead void air took form of a world at birth,
And the waters and firmaments were, and light, and the life-giving earth.
The beautiful bird unbegotten that night brought forth without pain
In the fathomless years forgotten whereover the dead gods reign,
Was it love, life, godhead, or fate? we say the spirit is one
That moved on the dark to create out of darkness the stars and the sun.
Before the growth was the grower, and the seed ere the plant was sown;
But what was seed of the sower? and the grain of him, whence was it grown?
Foot after foot ye go back and travail and make yourselves mad;
Blind feet that feel for the track where highway is none to be had.
Thou and I and he are not gods made men for a span,
Our lives are as pulses or pores of his manifold body and breath;
As waves of his sea on the shores where birth is the beacon of death.
We men, the multiform features of man, whatsoever we be,
Recreate him of whom we are creatures, and all we only are he.
Indivisible spirit and blood, indiscernible body from soul.
Not men's but man's is the glory of godhead, the kingdom of time,
The mountainous ages made hoary with snows for the spirit to climb.
A soul that labours and lives, an emotion, a strenuous breath,
From the flame that its own mouth gives reillumed, and refreshed with death.
His bed is in all men's graves, but the worm hath not hold on his limbs.
Night puts out not his eyes, nor time sheds change on his head;
With such fire as the stars of the skies are the roots of his heart are fed.
Men are the thoughts passing through it, the veins that fulfil it with blood,
With spirit of sense to renew it as springs fulfilling a flood.
Men are the heartbeats of man, the plumes that feather his wings,
Storm-worn, since being began, with the wind and thunder of things.
Things are cruel and blind; their strength detains and deforms:
And the wearying wings of the mind still beat up the stream of their storms.
Still, as one swimming up stream, they strike out blind in the blast,
In thunders of vision and dream, and lightnings of future and past.
We are baffled and caught in the current and bruised upon edges of shoals;
As weeds or as reeds in the torrent of things are the wind-shaken souls.
Spirit by spirit goes under, a foam-bell's bubble of breath,
That blows and opens in sunder and blurs not the mirror of death.
For a worm or a thorn in his path is a man's soul quenched as a flame;
For his lust of an hour or his wrath shall the worm and the man be the same.
What world shall shake at his nod? at his coming what wilderness glow?
What help in the work of his hands? what light in the track of his feet?
His days are snowflakes or sands, with cold to consume him and heat.
He is servant with Change for lord, and for wages he hath to his hire
Folly and force, and a sword that devours, and a ravening fire.
From the bed of his birth to his grave he is driven as a wind at their will;
Lest Change bow down as his slave, and the storm and the sword be still;
Lest earth spread open her wings to the sunward, and sing with the spheres;
Lest man be master of things, to prevail on their forces and fears.
By the spirit are things overcome; they are stark, and the spirit hath breath;
It hath speech, and their forces are dumb; it is living, and things are of death.
But they know not the spirit for master, they feel not force from above,
While man makes love to disaster, and woos desolation with love.
Yea, himself too hath made himself chains, and his own hands plucked out his eyes;
For his own soul only constrains him, his own mouth only denies.
The herds of kings and their hosts and the flocks of the high priests bow
Thou madest man in the garden; thou temptedst man, and he fell;
Thou gavest him poison and pardon for blood and burnt-offering to sell.
Thou hast sealed thine elect to salvation, fast locked with faith for the key;
Make now for thyself expiation, and be thine atonement for thee.
Ah, thou that darkenest heaven--ah, thou that bringest a sword -
By the balefires of ages that burn for thine incense, by creed and by rood,
By the famine and passion that yearn and that hunger to find of thee food,
By the children that asked at thy throne of the priests that were fat with thine hire
For bread, and thou gavest a stone; for light, and thou madest them fire;
By the kiss of thy peace like a snake's kiss, that leaves the soul rotten at root;
By the savours of gibbets and stakes thou hast planted to bear to thee fruit;
By torture and terror and treason, that make to thee weapons and wings;
By thy power upon men for a season, made out of the malice of things;
O thou that hast built thee a shrine of the madness of man and his shame,
And hast hung in the midst for a sign of his worship the lamp of thy name;
That hast shown him for heaven in a vision a void world's shadow and shell,
And hast fed thy delight and derision with fire of belief as of hell;
That hast fleshed on the souls that believe thee the fang of the death-worm fear,
With anguish of dreams to deceive them whose faith cries out in thine ear;
By the face of the spirit confounded before thee and humbled in dust,
By the dread wherewith life was astounded and shamed out of sense of its trust,
By the scourges of doubt and repentance that fell on the soul at thy nod,
Thy slave that slept is awake; thy slave but slept for a span;
Yea, man thy slave shall unmake thee, who made thee lord over man.
For his face is set to the east, his feet on the past and its dead;
The sun rearisen is his priest, and the heat thereof hallows his head.
His eyes take part in the morning; his spirit out-sounding the sea
Asks no more witness or warning from temple or tripod or tree.
He hath set the centuries at union; the night is afraid at his name;
Equal with life, in communion with death, he hath found them the same.
Past the wall unsurmounted that bars out our vision with iron and fire
He hath sent forth his soul for the stars to comply with and suns to conspire.
His thought takes flight for the centre wherethrough it hath part in the whole;
The abysses forbid it not enter: the stars make room for the soul.
Space is the soul's to inherit; the night is hers as the day;
Lo, saith man, this is my spirit; how shall not the worlds make way?
Space is thought's, and the wonders thereof, and the secret of space;
Is thought not more than the thunders and lightnings? shall thought give place?
Is the body not more than the vesture, the life not more than the meat?
The will than the word or the gesture, the heart than the hands or the feet?
Is the tongue not more than the speech is? the head not more than the crown?
And if higher than is heaven be the reach of the soul, shall not heaven bow down?
Time, father of life, and more great than the life it begat and began,
Earth's keeper and heaven's and their fate, lives, thinks, and hath substance in man.
Time's motion that throbs in his blood is the thought that gives heart to the skies,
And the springs of the fire that is food to the sunbeams are light to his eyes.
The minutes that beat with his heart are the words to which worlds keep chime,
And the thought in his pulses is part of the blood and the spirit of time.
He saith to the ages, Give; and his soul foregoes not her share;
Who are ye that forbid him to live, and would feed him with heavenlier air?
Will ye feed him with poisonous dust, and restore him with hemlock for drink,
Till he yield you his soul up in trust, and have heart not to know or to think?
He hath stirred him, and found out the flaw in his fetters, and cast them behind;
His soul to his soul is a law, and his mind is a light to his mind.
The seal of his knowledge is sure, the truth and his spirit are wed;
Men perish, but man shall endure; lives die, but the life is not dead.
He hath sight of the secrets of season, the roots of the years and the fruits;
His soul is at one with the reason of things that is sap to the roots.
He can hear in their changes a sound as the conscience of consonant spheres;
He can see through the years flowing round him the law lying under the years.
Who are ye that would bind him with curses and blind him with vapour of prayer?
Your might is as night that disperses when light is alive in the air.
The bow of your godhead is broken, the arm of your conquest is stayed;
Will ye turn back times, and the courses of stars, and the season of souls?
Nay, cry on him then till he show you a sign, till he lift up a rod;
Is no heat of him left in the ashes of thousands burnt up for his sake?
Can prayer not rekindle the flashes that shone in his face from the stake?
Is he drunk or asleep, that the rod of his wrath is unfelt and unseen?
Is the fire of his old loving-kindness gone out, that his pyres are acold?
Hath he gazed on himself unto blindness, who made men blind to behold?
Cry out, for his kingdom is shaken; cry out, for the people blaspheme;
Cry aloud till his godhead awaken; what doth he to sleep and to dream?
Cry, cut yourselves, gash you with knives and with scourges, heap on to you dust;
He will hear not again the strong crying of earth in his ears as before,
And the fume of his multitudes dying shall flatter his nostrils no more.
By the spirit he ruled as his slave is he slain who was mighty to slay,
And the stone that is sealed on his grave he shall rise not and roll not away.
Yea, weep to him, lift up your hands; be your eyes as a fountain of tears;
Where he stood there is nothing that stands; if he call, there is no man that hears.
He hath doffed his king's raiment of lies now the wane of his kingdom is come;
Ears hath he, and hears not; and eyes, and he sees not; and mouth, and is dumb.
His red king's raiment is ripped from him naked, his staff broken down;
And the signs of his empire are stripped from him shuddering; and where is his crown?
And in vain by the wellsprings refrozen ye cry for the warmth of his sun -
Kingdom and will hath he none in him left him, nor warmth in his breath;
Till his corpse be cast out of the sun will ye know not the truth of his death?
Surely, ye say, he is strong, though the times be against him and men;
Yet a little, ye say, and how long, till he come to show judgment again?
They cry out, thine elect, thine aspirants to heavenward, whose faith is as flame;
By thy name that in hell-fire was written, and burned at the point of thy sword,
And the love-song of earth as thou diest resounds through the wind of her wings -
Glory to Man in the highest! for Man is the master of things. 



FROM the forests and highlands
                We come, we come;
            From the river-girt islands,
                Where loud waves are dumb
    Listening to my sweet pipings.
        The wind in the reeds and the rushes,
            The bees on the bells of thyme,
        The birds on the myrtle-bushes,
            The cicale above in the lime,
        And the lizards below in the grass,
Were as silent as ever old Tmolus was,
    Listening to my sweet pipings.

    Liquid Peneus was flowing,
        And all dark Temple lay
    In Pelion's shadow, outgrowing
        The light of the dying day,
    Speeded by my sweet pipings.
        The Sileni and Sylvans and fauns,
            And the Nymphs of the woods and wave
        To the edge of the moist river-lawns,
            And the brink of the dewy caves,
And all that did then attend and follow,
Were silent with love,--as you now, Apollo,
    With envy of my sweet pipings.

    I sang of the dancing stars,
        I sang of the dedal earth,
    And of heaven, and the Giant wars,
        And love, and death, and birth.
    And then I changed my pipings,--
Singing how down the vale of Maenalus
    I pursued a maiden, and clasped a reed:
    It breaks in our bosom, and then we bleed.
All wept--as I think both ye now would,
If envy or age had not frozen your blood--
    At the sorrow of my sweet pipings. 

When the dying flame of day
Through the chancel shot its ray,
Far the glimmering tapers shed
Faint light on the cowled head;
And the censer burning swung,
Where, before the altar, hung
The crimson banner, that with prayer
Had been consecrated there.
And the nuns' sweet hymn was heard the while,
Sung low, in the dim, mysterious aisle.



   "Take thy banner!  May it wave
    Proudly o'er the good and brave;
    When the battle's distant wail
    Breaks the sabbath of our vale.
    When the clarion's music thrills
    To the hearts of these lone hills,
    When the spear in conflict shakes,
    And the strong lance shivering breaks.

   "Take thy banner! and, beneath
    The battle-cloud's encircling wreath,
    Guard it, till our homes are free!
    In the dark and trying hour,
    In the breaking forth of power,
    In the rush of steeds and men,
    His right hand will shield thee then.

    "Take thy banner!  But when night
     Closes round the ghastly fight,
     If the vanquished warrior bow,
     Spare him!  By our holy vow,
     By our prayers and many tears,
     By the mercy that endears,
     Spare him! he our love hath shared!
     Spare him! as thou wouldst be spared!

    "Take thy banner! and if e'er
     Thou shouldst press the soldier's bier,
     And the muffled drum should beat
     To the tread of mournful feet,
     Then this crimson flag shall be
     Martial cloak and shroud for thee



The warrior took that banner proud,
And it was his martial cloak and shroud

Hail, mildly pleasing solitude,
Companion of the wise and good;
But, from whose holy, piercing eye,
The herd of fools, and villains fly.
Oh! how I love with thee to walk,
And listen to thy whisper'd talk,
Which innocence, and truth imparts,
And melts the most obdurate hearts. 

A thousand shapes you wear with ease,
And still in every shape you please.
Now wrapt in some mysterious dream,
A lone philosopher you seem;
Now quick from hill to vale you fly,
And now you sweep the vaulted sky;
A shepherd next, you haunt the plain,
And warble forth your oaten strain;
A lover now, with all the grace
Of that sweet passion in your face:
Then, calm'd to friendship, you assume
The gentle-looking Hertford's bloom,
As, with her Musidora, she,
(Her Musidora fond of thee)
Amid the long withdrawing vale,
Awakes the rival'd nightingale. 

Thine is the balmy breath of morn,
Just as the dew-bent rose is born;
And while meridian fervours beat,
Thine is the woodland dumb retreat;
But chief, when evening scenes decay,
And the faint landskip swims away,
Thine is the doubtful soft decline,
And that best hour of musing thine. 

Descending angels bless thy train,
The virtues of the sage, and swain;
Plain Innocence in white array'd,
Before thee lifts her fearless head:
Religion's beams around thee shine,
And cheer thy glooms with light divine:
About thee sports sweet Liberty;
And rapt Urania sings to thee. 

Oh, let me pierce thy secret cell!
And in thy deep recesses dwell!
Perhaps from Norwood's oak-clad hill,
When meditation has her fill,
I just may cast my careless eyes
Where London's spiry turrets rise,
Think of its crimes, its cares, its pain,
Then shield me in the woods again. 

IT was the Winter wilde, 
While the Heav'n-born-childe, 
   All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies; 
Nature in aw to him 
Had doff't her gawdy trim, 
   With her great Master so to sympathize: 
It was no season then for her 
To wanton with the Sun her lusty Paramour. 

Only with speeches fair 
She woo's the gentle Air 
   To hide her guilty front with innocent Snow, 
And on her naked shame, 
Pollute with sinfull blame, 
   The Saintly Vail of Maiden white to throw, 
Confounded, that her Makers eyes 
Should look so neer upon her foul deformities. 

But he her fears to cease, 
Sent down the meek-eyd Peace, 
   She crown'd with Olive green, came softly sliding 
Down through the turning sphear 
His ready Harbinger, 
   With Turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing, 
And waving wide her mirtle wand, 
She strikes a universall Peace through Sea and Land. 

No War, or Battails sound 
Was heard the World around, 
   The idle spear and shield were high up hung; 
The hooked Chariot stood 
Unstain'd with hostile blood, 
   The Trumpet spake not to the armed throng, 
And Kings sate still with awfull eye, 

But peacefull was the night 
Wherin the Prince of light 
   His raign of peace upon the earth began: 
The Windes with wonder whist, 
Smoothly the waters kist, 
   Whispering new joyes to the milde Ocean, 
Who now hath quite forgot to rave, 
While Birds of Calm sit brooding on the charmeed wave. 

The Stars with deep amaze 
Stand fixt in stedfast gaze, 
   Bending one way their pretious influence, 
And will not take their flight, 
For all the morning light, 
   Or Lucifer that often warn'd them thence; 
But in their glimmering Orbs did glow, 

And though the shady gloom 
Had given day her room, 
   The Sun himself with-held his wonted speed, 
And hid his head for shame, 
As his inferiour flame, 
   The new enlightn'd world no more should need; 
He saw a greater Sun appear 
Then his bright Throne, or burning Axletree could bear. 

The Shepherds on the Lawn, 
Or ere the point of dawn, 
   Sate simply chatting in a rustick row; 
Full little thought they than, 
That the mighty Pan 
   Was kindly com to live with them below; 
Perhaps their loves, or els their sheep, 
Was all that did their silly thoughts so busie keep. 

When such musick sweet 
Their hearts and ears did greet, 
   As never was by mortall finger strook, 
Divinely-warbled voice 
Answering the stringed noise, 
   As all their souls in blisfull rapture took 
The Air such pleasure loth to lose, 
With thousand echo's still prolongs each heav'nly close. 

Nature that heard such sound 
Beneath the hollow round 
   Of Cynthia's seat, the Airy region thrilling, 
Now was almost won 
To think her part was don, 
   And that her raign had here its last fulfilling; 
She knew such harmony alone 
Could hold all Heav'n and Earth in happier union. 

At last surrounds their sight 
A Globe of circular light, 
   That with long beams the shame-fac't night array'd, 
The helmed Cherubim 
And sworded Seraphim, 
   Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displaid, 
Harping in loud and solemn quire, 
With unexpressive notes to Heav'ns new-born Heir. 

Such musick (as 'tis said) 
Before was never made, 
   But when of old the sons of morning sung, 
While the Creator Great 
His constellations set, 
   And the well-ballanc't world on hinges hung, 
And cast the dark foundations deep, 
And bid the weltring waves their oozy channel keep. 

Ring out ye Crystall sphears, 
Once bless our human ears, 
   (If ye have power to touch our senses so) 
And let your silver chime 
Move in melodious time; 
   And let the Base of Heav'ns deep Organ blow 
And with your ninefold harmony 
Make up full consort to th'Angelike symphony. 

For if such holy Song 
Enwrap our fancy long, 
   Time will run back, and fetch the age of gold, 
And speckl'd vanity 
Will sicken soon and die, 
   And leprous sin will melt from earthly mould, 
And Hell it self will pass away, 
And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day. 

Yea Truth, and Justice then 
Will down return to men, 
   Th'enameld Arras of the Rain-bow wearing, 
And Mercy set between, 
Thron'd in Celestiall sheen, 
   With radiant feet the tissued clouds down stearing, 
And Heav'n as at som festivall, 
Will open wide the Gates of her high Palace Hall. 

But wisest Fate sayes no, 
This must not yet be so, 
   The Babe lies yet in smiling Infancy, 
That on the bitter cross 
Must redeem our loss; 
   So both himself and us to glorifie: 
Yet first to those ychain'd in sleep, 
The wakefull trump of doom must thunder through the deep, 

With such a horrid clang 
As on mount Sinai rang 
   While the red fire, and smouldring clouds out brake: 
The aged Earth agast 
With terrour of that blast, 
   Shall from the surface to the center shake; 
When at the worlds last session, 
The dreadfull Judge in middle Air shall spread his throne. 

And then at last our bliss 
Full and perfect is, 
   But now begins; for from this happy day 
Th'old Dragon under ground 
In straiter limits bound, 
   Not half so far casts his usurped sway, 
And wrath to see his Kingdom fail, 
Swindges the scaly Horrour of his foulded tail. 

The Oracles are dumm, 
No voice or hideous humm 
   Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving. 
Apollo from his shrine 
Can no more divine, 
   With hollow shreik the steep of Delphos leaving. 
No nightly trance, or breathed spell, 
Inspire's the pale-ey'd Priest from the prophetic cell. 

The lonely mountains o're, 
And the resounding shore, 
   A voice of weeping heard, and loud lament; 
From haunted spring, and dale 
Edg'd with poplar pale, 
   The parting Genius is with sighing sent, 
With flowre-inwov'n tresses torn 
The Nimphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn. 

In consecrated Earth, 
And on the holy Hearth, 
   The Lars, and Lemures moan with midnight plaint, 
In Urns, and Altars round, 
A drear, and dying sound 
   Affrights the Flamins at their service quaint; 
And the chill Marble seems to sweat, 
While each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat 

Peor, and Baalim, 
Forsake their Temples dim, 
   With that twise-batter'd god of Palestine, 
And mooned Ashtaroth, 
   Now sits not girt with Tapers holy shine, 
The Libyc Hammon shrinks his horn, 
In vain the Tyrian Maids their wounded Thamuz mourn. 

And sullen Moloch fled, 
Hath left in shadows dred, 
   His burning Idol all of blackest hue, 
In vain with Cymbals ring, 
They call the grisly king, 
   In dismall dance about the furnace blue; 
The brutish gods of Nile as fast, 
Isis and Orus, and the Dog Anubis hast. 

Nor is Osiris seen 
In Memphian Grove, or Green, 
   Trampling the unshowr'd Grasse with lowings loud: 
Nor can he be at rest 
Within his sacred chest, 
   Naught but profoundest Hell can be his shroud, 
In vain with Timbrel'd Anthems dark 
The sable-stoled Sorcerers bear his worshipt Ark. 

He feels from Juda's Land 
The dredded Infants hand, 
   The rayes of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn; 
Nor all the gods beside, 
Longer dare abide, 
   Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine: 
Can in his swadling bands controul the damned crew. 

So when the Sun in bed, 
Curtain'd with cloudy red, 
   Pillows his chin upon an Orient wave, 
The flocking shadows pale, 
Troop to th'infernall jail, 
   Each fetter'd Ghost slips to his severall grave, 
And the yellow-skirted Fayes, 
Fly after the Night-steeds, leaving their Moon-lov'd maze. 

But see the Virgin blest, 
Hath laid her Babe to rest. 
   Time is our tedious Song should here have ending, 
Heav'ns youngest teemed Star, 
Hath fixt her polisht Car, 
And all about the Courtly Stable, 
Bright-harnest Angels sit in order serviceable. 

Daughter of Jove, relentless Power,
Thou tamer of the human breast,
Whose iron scourge and tort'ring hour
The Bad affright, afflict the Best!
Bound in thy adamantine chain
The Proud are taught to taste of pain,
And purple Tyrants vainly groan
With pangs unfelt before, unpitied and alone.

When first thy Sire to send on earth
Virtue, his darling child, designed,
To thee he gave the heav'nly Birth,
And bade to form her infant mind.
Stern rugged Nurse! thy rigid lore
With patience many a year she bore:
What sorrow was, thou bad'st her know,
And from her own she learned to melt at others' woe.

Scared at thy frown terrific, fly
Self-pleasing Folly's idle brood,
Wild Laughter, Noise, and thoughtless Joy,
And leave us leisure to be good.
Light they disperse, and with them go
The summer Friend, the flatt'ring Foe;
By vain Prosperity received,
To her they vow their truth, and are again believed.

Wisdom in sable garb arrayed
Immersed in rapt'rous thought profound,
And Melancholy, silent maid
With leaden eye, that loves the ground,
Still on thy solemn steps attend:
Warm Charity, the gen'ral Friend,
With Justice, to herself severe,
And Pity dropping soft the sadly-pleasing tear.

Oh, gently on thy Suppliant's head,
Not in thy Gorgon terrors clad,
Not circled with the vengeful Band
(As by the Impious thou art seen),
With thund'ring voice, and threat'ning mien,
With screaming Horror's funeral cry,
Despair, and fell Disease, and ghastly Poverty.

Thy milder influence impart,
Thy philosophic Train be there
To soften, not to wound my heart.
The gen'rous spark extinct revive,
Teach me to love and to forgive,
Exact my own defects to scan,
What others are, to feel, and know myself a Man. 


Throned in splendor, immortal Aphrodite! 
Child of Zeus, Enchantress, I implore thee 
Slay me not in this distress and anguish, 
Lady of beauty. 
 
Hither come as once before thou camest, 
When from afar thou heard'st my voice lamenting, 
Heard'st and camest, leaving thy glorious father's Palace golden, 
 
Yoking thy chariot. Fair the doves that bore thee; 
Swift to the darksome earth their course directing, 
Waving their thick wings from the highest heaven 
Down through the ether. 
 
Quickly they came. Then thou, O blessed goddess, 
All in smiling wreathed thy face immortal, 
Bade me tell thee the cause of all my suffering, 
Why now I called thee; 
 
What for my maddened heart I most was longing. 
"Whom," thou criest, "dost wish that sweet Persuasion 
Now win over and lead to thy love, my Sappho? 
Who is it wrongs thee? 
 
"For, though now he flies, he soon shall follow, 
Soon shall be giving gifts who now rejects them. 
Even though now he love not, soon shall he love thee 
Even though thou wouldst not
 

 
Come then now, dear goddess, and release me 
From my anguish. All my heart's desiring 
Grant thou now. Now too again as aforetime, 
Be thou my ally. 


      And of the golden lyre,
And of the golden hair,
      And of the golden fire,
            Charioteer
            Of the patient year,
      Where---where slept thine ire,
When like a blank idiot I put on thy wreath,
      Thy laurel, thy glory,
      The light of thy story,
Or was I a worm---too low crawling for death?
      O Delphic Apollo!

The Thunderer grasp'd and grasp'd,
      The Thunderer frown'd and frown'd;
The eagle's feathery mane
      For wrath became stiffen'd---the sound
            Of breeding thunder
            Went drowsily under,
      Muttering to be unbound.
O why didst thou pity, and beg for a worm?
      Why touch thy soft lute
      Till the thunder was mute,
Why was I not crush'd---such a pitiful germ?
      O Delphic Apollo!

The Pleiades were up,
      Watching the silent air;
The seeds and roots in Earth
      Were swelling for summer fare;
            The Ocean, its neighbour,
            Was at his old labour,
      When, who---who did dare
To tie for a moment, thy plant round his brow,
      And grin and look proudly,
      And blaspheme so loudly,
And live for that honour, to stoop to thee now?
      O Delphic Apollo


Wreathed in myrtle, my sword I'll conceal
Like those champions devoted and brave,
When they plunged in the tyrant their steel,
And to Athens deliverance gave. 

Beloved heroes! your deathless souls roam
In the joy breathing isles of the blest;
Where the mighty of old have their home -
Where Achilles and Diomed rest. 

In fresh myrtle my blade I'll entwine,
Like Harmodious, the gallant and good,
When he made at the tutelar shrine
A libation of Tyranny's blood. 

Ye deliverers of Athens from shame!
Ye avengers of Liberty's wrongs!
Endless ages shall cherish your fame
Embalmed in their echoing songs

Hail! Power Divine, who by thy sole command,
From the dark empty space,
Made the broad sea and solid land
Smile with a heavenly grace.

Made the high mountain and firm rock,
Where bleating cattle stray;
And the strong, stately, spreading oak,
That intercepts the day.

The rolling planets thou madest move,
By thy effective will;
And the revolving globes above
Their destined cours fulfil.

His mighty power, ye thunders, praise,
As through the heavens ye roll;
And his great name, ye lightnings, blaze,
Unto the distant pole.

Ye seas, in your eternal roar,
His sacred praise proclaim;
While the inactive sluggish shore
Re-echoes to the same.

Ye howling winds, howl out his praise,
And make the forests bow;
While through the air, the earth, and seas,
His solemn praise ye blow.

O yon high harmonious spheres,
Your powerful mover sing;
To him your circling course that steers,
Your tuneful praises bring.

Ungrateful mortals, catch the sound,
And in your numerous lays, 
To all the listening world around,

The awful shadow of some unseen Power
Floats through unseen among us, -- visiting
This various world with as inconstant wing
As summer winds that creep from flower to flower, --
Like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower,
It visits with inconstant glance
Each human heart and countenance;
Like hues and harmonies of evening, --
Like clouds in starlight widely spread, --
Like memory of music fled, --
Like aught that for its grace may be
Dear, and yet dearer for its mystery.

Spirit of Beauty, that dost consecrate
With thine own hues all thou dost shine upon
Of human thought or form, -- where art thou gone?
Why dost thou pass away and leave our state,
This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate?
Ask why the sunlight not for ever
Weaves rainbows o'er yon mountain-river,
Why aught should fail and fade that once is shown,
Why fear and dream and death and birth
Cast on the daylight of this earth
Such gloom, -- why man has such a scope
For love and hate, despondency and hope?

No voice from some sublimer world hath ever
To sage or poet these responses given --
Therefore the names of Demon, Ghost, and Heaven,
Remain the records of their vain endeavour,
Frail spells -- whose uttered charm might not avail to sever,
From all we hear and all we see,
Doubt, chance, and mutability.
Thy light alone -- like mist oe'er the mountains driven,
Or music by the night-wind sent
Through strings of some still instrument,
Or moonlight on a midnight stream,
Gives grace and truth to life's unquiet dream.

Love, Hope, and Self-esteem, like clouds depart
And come, for some uncertain moments lent.
Man were immortal, and omnipotent,
Didst thou, unknown and awful as thou art,
Keep with thy glorious train firm state within his heart.
Thou messgenger of sympathies,
That wax and wane in lovers' eyes --
Thou -- that to human thought art nourishment,
Like darkness to a dying flame!
Depart not as thy shadow came,
Depart not -- lest the grave should be,
Like life and fear, a dark reality.

While yet a boy I sought for ghosts, and sped
Through many a listening chamber, cave and ruin,
And starlight wood, with fearful steps pursuing
Hopes of high talk with the departed dead.
I called on poisonous names with which our youth is fed;
I was not heard -- I saw them not --
When musing deeply on the lot
Of life, at that sweet time when winds are wooing
All vital things that wake to bring
News of birds and blossoming, --
Sudden, thy shadow fell on me;
I shrieked, and clasped my hands in ecstasy!

I vowed that I would dedicate my powers
To thee and thine -- have I not kept the vow?
With beating heart and streaming eyes, even now
I call the phantoms of a thousand hours
Each from his voiceless grave: they have in visioned bowers
Of studious zeal or love's delight
Outwatched with me the envious night --
They know that never joy illumed my brow
Unlinked with hope that thou wouldst free
This world from its dark slavery,
That thou - O awful Loveliness,
Wouldst give whate'er these words cannot express.

The day becomes more solemn and serene
When noon is past -- there is a harmony
In autumn, and a lustre in its sky,
Which through the summer is not heard or seen,
As if it could not be, as if it had not been!
Thus let thy power, which like the truth
Of nature on my passive youth
Descended, to my onward life supply
Its calm -- to one who worships thee,
And every form containing thee,
Whom, Spirit fair, thy spells did bind
To fear himself, and love all human kind. 

Joy, thou goddess, fair, immortal,
 Offspring of Elysium,
Mad with rapture, to the portal
 Of thy holy fame we come!
Fashion's laws, indeed, may sever,
 But thy magic joins again;
All mankind are brethren ever
 'Neath thy mild and gentle reign.

CHORUS.
Welcome, all ye myriad creatures!
 Brethren, take the kiss of love!
 Yes, the starry realms above
Hide a Father's smiling features!

He, that noble prize possessing--
 He that boasts a friend that's true,
He whom woman's love is blessing,
 Let him join the chorus too!
Aye, and he who but one spirit
 On this earth can call his own!
He who no such bliss can merit,
 Let him mourn his fate alone!

CHORUS.
All who Nature's tribes are swelling
 Homage pay to sympathy;
 For she guides us up on high,
Where the unknown has his dwelling.

From the breasts of kindly Nature
 All of joy imbibe the dew;
Good and bad alike, each creature
 Would her roseate path pursue.
'Tis through her the wine-cup maddens,
 Love and friends to man she gives!
Bliss the meanest reptile gladdens,--

CHORUS.
Bow before him, all creation!
 Seek him high the stars above,--
Yonder is his habitation!

Joy, in Nature's wide dominion,
 Mightiest cause of all is found;
And 'tis joy that moves the pinion,
 When the wheel of time goes round;
From the bud she lures the flower--
 Suns from out their orbs of light;
Distant spheres obey her power,
 Far beyond all mortal sight.

CHORUS.
As through heaven's expanse so glorious
 In their orbits suns roll on,
 Brethren, thus your proud race run,
Glad as warriors all-victorious!

Joy from truth's own glass of fire
 Sweetly on the searcher smiles;
Lest on virtue's steeps he tire,
 Joy the tedious path beguiles.
High on faith's bright hill before us,
 See her banner proudly wave!
Joy, too, swells the angels' chorus,--
 Bursts the bondage of the grave!

CHORUS.
Mortals, meekly wait for heaven
 Suffer on in patient love!
 In the starry realms above,

 Praise for every good they grant;
Let us, with devotion tender,
 Minister to grief and want.
Quenched be hate and wrath forever,
 Pardoned be our mortal foe--
May our tears upbraid him never,
 No repentance bring him low!

CHORUS.
Sense of wrongs forget to treasure--
 Brethren, live in perfect love!
 In the starry realms above,

Joy within the goblet flushes,
 For the golden nectar, wine,
Every fierce emotion hushes,--
 Fills the breast with fire divine.
Brethren, thus in rapture meeting,
 Send ye round the brimming cup,--
Yonder kindly spirit greeting,
 While the foam to heaven mounts up!

CHORUS.
He whom seraphs worship ever;
 Whom the stars praise as they roll,
 Yes to him now drain the bowl
Mortal eye can see him never!

Courage, ne'er by sorrow broken!
 Aid where tears of virtue flow;
Faith to keep each promise spoken!
 Truth alike to friend and foe!
'Neath kings' frowns a manly spirit!--
 Brethren, noble is the prize--
Honor due to every merit!
 Death to all the brood of lies!

CHORUS.
Draw the sacred circle closer!
 By this bright wine plight your troth
 To be faithful to your oath!
Swear it by the Star-Disposer!

Safety from the tyrant's power!
 Mercy e'en to traitors base!
Hope in death's last solemn hour!
 Pardon when before His face!
Lo, the dead shall rise to heaven!
 Brethren hail the blest decree;
Every sin shall be forgiven,
 Hell forever cease to be!

CHORUS.
When the golden bowl is broken,
 Gentle sleep within the tomb!
 Brethren, may a gracious doom
By the Judge of man be spoken

The hair falling on your forehead
                           suddenly lifted.
Suddenly something stirred on the ground.
The trees are whispering
                        in the dark.
Your bare arms will be cold.

Far off
     where we can't see,
          the moon must be rising.
It hasn't reached us yet,
     slipping through the leaves
          to light up your shoulder.
But I know
           a wind comes up with the moon.
The trees are whispering.
Your bare arms will be cold.

From above,
from the branches lost in the dark,
                    something dropped at your feet.
You moved closer to me.
Under my hand your bare flesh is like the fuzzy skin of a fruit.
Neither a song of the heart nor "common sense"--
before the trees, birds, and insects,
my hand on my wife's flesh
                is thinking.
Tonight my hand
                 can't read or write.
Neither loving nor unloving. 
It's the tongue of a leopard at a spring,
                                  a grape leaf,
                                      a wolf's paw.
To move, breathe, eat, drink.
My hand is like a seed
                    splitting open underground.
Neither a song of the heart nor "common sense,"
neither loving nor unloving.
My hand thinking on my wife's flesh
                              is the hand of the first man.
Like a root that finds water underground,
it says to me:
"To eat, drink, cold, hot, struggle, smell, color--
not to live in order to die
but to die to live..


And now
as red female hair blows across my face,
as something stirs on the ground,
as the trees whisper in the dark,
and as the moon rises far off
                   where we can't see,
my hand on my wife's flesh
before the trees, birds, and insects,
I want the right of life,
of the leopard at the spring, of the seed splitting open--
                        I want the right of the first man.



Without its climax, death, what savour hath
Life? an impeccable machine, exact
He paces an inane and pointless path
To glut brute appetites, his sole content
How tedious were he fit to comprehend
Himself! More, this our noble element
Of fire in nature, love in spirit, unkenned
Life hath no spring, no axle, and no end.

His body a bloody-ruby radiant
With noble passion, sun-souled Lucifer
Swept through the dawn colossal, swift aslant
On Eden's imbecile perimeter.
He blessed nonentity with every curse
And spiced with sorrow the dull soul of sense,
Breathed life into the sterile universe,
With Love and Knowledge drove out innocence
The Key of Joy is disobedience. 



Thrill with lissome lust of the light,
O man ! My man !
Come careering out of the night
Of Pan ! Io Pan .
Io Pan ! Io Pan ! Come over the sea
From Sicily and from Arcady !
Roaming as Bacchus, with fauns and pards
And nymphs and styrs for thy guards,
On a milk-white ass, come over the sea
To me, to me,
Coem with Apollo in bridal dress
(Spheperdess and pythoness)
Come with Artemis, silken shod,
In the moon, of the woods, on the marble mount,
The dimpled dawn of of the amber fount !
Dip the purple of passionate prayer
In the crimson shrine, the scarlet snare,
The soul that startles in eyes of blue
To watch thy wantoness weeping through
The tangled grove, the gnarled bole
Of the living tree that is spirit and soul
And body and brain -come over the sea,
(Io Pan ! Io Pan !)
Devil or god, to me, to me,
My man ! my man !
Come with trumpets sounding shrill
Over the hill !
Come with drums low muttering
From the spring !
Come with flute and come with pipe !
Am I not ripe ?
I, who wait and writhe and wrestle
With air that hath no boughs to nestle
My body, weary of empty clasp,
Strong as a lion, and sharp as an asp-
Come, O come !
I am numb
With the lonely lust of devildom.
Thrust the sword through the galling fetter,
All devourer, all begetter;
Give me the sign of the Open Eye
And the token erect of thorny thigh
And the word of madness and mystery,
O pan ! Io Pan !
Io Pan ! Io Pan ! Pan Pan ! Pan,
I am a man:
Do as thou wilt, as a great god can,
O Pan ! Io Pan !
Io pan ! Io Pan Pan ! Iam awake
In the grip of the snake.
The eagle slashes with beak and claw;
The gods withdraw:
The great beasts come, Io Pan ! I am borne
To death on the horn
Of the Unicorn.
I am Pan ! Io Pan ! Io Pan Pan ! Pan !
I am thy mate, I am thy man,
Goat of thy flock, I am gold , I am god,
Flesh to thy bone, flower to thy rod.
With hoofs of steel I race on the rocks
Through solstice stubborn to equinox.
And I rave; and I rape and I rip and I rend
Everlasting, world without end.
Mannikin, maiden, maenad, man,
In the might of Pan.
Io Pan ! Io Pan Pan ! Pan ! Io Pan 


Dread Mother of Forgetfulness
Who, when Thy reign begins,
Wipest away the Soul's distress,
And memory of her sins.

The trusty Worm that dieth not--
The steadfast Fire also,
By Thy contrivance are forgot
In a completer woe.

Thine are the lidless eyes of night
That stare upon our tears,
Through certain hours which in our sight
Exceed a thousand years:

Thine is the thickness of the Dark
That presses in our pain,
As Thine the Dawn that bids us mark
Life's grinning face again.

Thine is the weariness outworn
No promise shall relieve,

And when Thy tender mercies cease
And life unvexed is due,
Instant upon the false release
The Worm and Fire renew.

Wherefore we praise Thee in the deep,
And on our beds we pray
For Thy return that Thou may'st keep
The Pains of Hell at bay




    I have lived long enough, having seen one thing, that love hath an end;
    Thou art more than the day or the morrow, the seasons that laugh or that weep;
    For these give joy and sorrow; but thou, Proserpina, sleep.
    Sweet is the treading of wine, and sweet the feet of the dove;
    But a goodlier gift is thine than foam of the grapes or love.
    Yea, is not even Apollo, with hair and harpstring of gold,
    I am sick of singing; the bays burn deep and chafe: I am fain
   To rest a little from praise and grievous pleasure and pain.
   We know they are cruel as love or life, and lovely as death.
   From your wrath is the world released, redeemed from your chains, men say.
   But for me their new device is barren, the days are bare;
   Things long past over suffice, and men forgotten that were.
   Draining a little life from the barren breasts of love.
   I say to you, cease, take rest; yea, I say to you all, be at peace,
   Till the bitter milk of her breast and the barren bosom shall cease.
   Wilt thou take all, Galilean? but these thou shalt not take,
   The laurel, the palms and the paean, the breasts of the nymphs in the brake;
   Breasts more soft than a dove's, that tremble with tenderer breath;
   And all the wings of the Loves, and all the joy before death;
   All the feet of the hours that sound as a single lyre,
   Dropped and deep in the flowers, with strings that flicker like fire.
   More than these wilt thou give, things fairer than all these things?
   Nay, for a little we live, and life hath mutable wings.
   A little while and we die; shall life not thrive as it may?
   For no man under the sky lives twice, outliving his day.
   And grief is a grievous thing, and a man hath enough of his tears:
   Why should he labour, and bring fresh grief to blacken his years?
   Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath;
   We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fullness of death.
   Laurel is green for a season, and love is sweet for a day;
   But love grows bitter with treason, and laurel outlives not May.
   Sleep, shall we sleep after all? for the world is not sweet in the end;
   For the old faiths loosen and fall, the new years ruin and rend.
   Fate is a sea without shore, and the soul is a rock that abides;
   But her ears are vexed with the roar and her face with the foam of the tides.
   O lips that the live blood faints in, the leavings of racks and rods!
   Though all men abase them before you in spirit, and all knees bend,
   I kneel not neither adore you, but standing, look to the end.
   All delicate days and pleasant, all spirits and sorrows are cast
   Far out with the foam of the present that sweeps to the surf of the past:
   Where beyond the extreme sea-wall, and between the remote sea-gates,
   Waste water washes, and tall ships founder, and deep death waits:
   Where, mighty with deepening sides, clad about with the seas as with wings,
   And impelled of invisible tides, and fulfilled of unspeakable things,
   White-eyed and poisonous-finned, shark-toothed and serpentine-curled,
   Rolls, under the whitening wind of the future, the wave of the world.
   The depths stand naked in sunder behind it, the storms flee away;
   In the hollow before it the thunder is taken and snared as a prey;
   In its sides is the north-wind bound; and its salt is of all men's tears;
   With light of ruin, and sound of changes, and pulse of years:
   With travail of day after day, and with trouble of hour upon hour;
    And bitter as blood is the spray; and the crests are as fangs that devour:
   And its vapour and storm of its steam as the sighing of spirits to be;
   And its noise as the noise in a dream; and its depth as the roots of the sea:
   And the height of its heads as the height of the utmost stars of the air:
   And the ends of the earth at the might thereof tremble, and time is made bare.
   Will ye bridle the deep sea with reins, will ye chasten the high sea with rods?
   All ye as a wind shall go by, as a fire shall ye pass and be past;
   In the darkness of time, in the deeps of the years, in the changes of things,
   Ye shall sleep as a slain man sleeps, and the world shall forget you for kings.
   Though the feet of thine high priests tread where thy lords and our forefathers trod,
   Though before thee the throned Cytherean be fallen, and hidden her head,
   Yet thy kingdom shall pass, Galilean, thy dead shall go down to thee dead.
   Of the maiden thy mother men sing as a goddess with grace clad around;
   Not as thine, not as thine was our mother, a blossom of flowering seas,
   Clothed round with the world's desire as with raiment, and fair as the foam,
   And fleeter than kindled fire, and a goddess, and mother of Rome.
   For thine came pale and a maiden, and sister to sorrow; but ours,
   Her deep hair heavily laden with odour and colour of flowers,
   White rose of the rose-white water, a silver splendour, a flame,
   Bent down unto us that besought her, and earth grew sweet with her name.
   For thine came weeping, a slave among slaves, and rejected; but she
   Came flushed from the full-flushed wave, and imperial, her foot on the sea.
   And the wonderful waters knew her, the winds and the viewless ways,
   And the roses grew rosier, and bluer the sea-blue stream of the bays.
   Ye are fallen, our lords, by what token? we wise that ye should not fall.
   Ye were all so fair that are broken; and one more fair than ye all.
   But I turn to her still, having seen she shall surely abide in the end;
   O daughter of earth, of my mother, her crown and blossom of birth,
   I am also, I also, thy brother; I go as I came unto earth.
   In the night where thine eyes are as moons are in heaven, the night where thou art, 
   Where the silence is more than all tunes, where sleep overflows from the heart,
   Where the poppies are sweet as the rose in our world, and the red rose is white,
   And the wind falls faint as it blows with the fume of the flowers of the night,
  Grows dim in thine ears and deep as the deep dim soul of a star,
  In the sweet low light of thy face, under heavens untrod by the sun,
  Let my soul with their souls find place, and forget what is done and undone.
  Let these give labour and slumber; but thou, Proserpina, death.
  Therefore now at thy feet I abide for a season in silence. I know
  I shall die as my fathers died, and sleep as they sleep, even so.
  For the glass of the years is brittle wherein we gaze for a span;
  A little soul for a little bears up this corpse which is man.
  So long I endure, no longer; and laugh not again, neither weep.



Science! thou fair effusive ray
     From the great source of mental day,
         Free, generous, and refin'd!
     Descend with all thy treasures fraught,
     Illumine each bewilder'd thought,
         And bless my lab'ring mind.

       But first with thy resistless light,
     Disperse those phantoms from my sight,
         Those mimic shades of thee;
   The scholiast's learning, sophist's cant,
   The visionary bigot's rant,
       The monk's philosophy.

     O! let thy powerful charms impart
   The patient head, the candid heart,
       Devoted to thy sway;
   Which no weak passions e'er mislead,
   Which still with dauntless steps proceed
       Where Reason points the way.

     Give me to learn each secret cause;
   Let number's, figure's, motion's laws
       Reveal'd before me stand;
   These to great Nature's scenes apply,
   And round the globe, and thro' the sky,
       Disclose her working hand.

     Next, to thy nobler search resign'd,
   The busy, restless, human mind
       Thro' ev'ry maze pursue;
   Detect Perception where it lies,
   Catch the ideas as they rise,
       And all their changes view.

     Say from what simple springs began
   The vast, ambitious thoughts of man,
       Which range beyond control;
   Which seek Eternity to trace,
   Dive thro' th' infinity of space,
       And strain to grasp the whole.

     Her secret stores let Memory tell,
   Bid Fancy quit her fairy cell,
       In all her colours drest;
   While prompt her sallies to control,
   Reason, the judge, recalls the soul
       To Truth's severest test.

     Then launch thro' Being's wide extent;
   Let the fair scale, with just ascent,
       And cautious steps, be trod;
   And from the dead, corporeal mass,
   Thro' each progressive order pass

     There, Science! veil thy daring eye;
   Nor dive too deep, nor soar too high,
       In that divine abyss;
   To Faith content thy beams to lend,
   Her hopes t' assure, her steps befriend,
       And light her way to bliss.

     Then downwards take thy flight agen;
   Mix with the policies of men,
       And social nature's ties:
   The plan, the genius of each state,
   Its interest and its pow'rs relate,
       Its fortunes and its rise.

     Thro' private life pursue thy course,
   Trace every action to its source,
       And means and motives weigh:
   Put tempers, passions in the scale,
   Mark what degrees in each prevail,
       And fix the doubtful sway.

     That last, best effort of thy skill,
   To form the life, and rule the will,
       Propitious pow'r! impart:
   Teach me to cool my passion's fires,
   Make me the judge of my desires,
       The master of my heart.

     Raise me above the vulgar's breath,
   Pursuit of fortune, fear of death,
       And all in life that's mean.
   Still true to reason be my plan,
   Still let my action speak the man,
       Thro' every various scene.

   Hail! charm of age, and guide of youth;
       Sweet refuge of distress:
   In business, thou! exact, polite;
   Thou giv'st Retirement its delight,
       Prosperity its grace.

     Of wealth, pow'r, freedom, thou! the cause;
   Foundress of order, cities, laws,
       Of arts inventress, thou!
   Without thee what were human kind?
   How vast their wants, their thoughts how blind!
       Their joys how mean! how few!

     Sun of the soul! thy beams unveil!
   Let others spread the daring sail,
       On Fortune's faithless sea;
   While undeluded, happier I
   From the vain tumult timely fly,
       And sit in peace with thee. 




From every quarter we,
Who bent the trembling knee
And cowered or grovelled prostrate day and night,
Now come once more to sing
A dirge before thee, King,
Once more with earnest heart to do thee right.

Our weary feet have trod
The vasty barren sands and treacherous ice,
With many a bitter cry,
To pile thine altar high
With pallid human hearts in sacrifice.

We hated thee and came
With eyes of shifty shame,
With heavy steel above the craven breast,
Yet evermore we did
The ill thy servants bid,
For everywhere thy might was manifest.

At thy sibilant word
We were filled with distrust,
And we glared on each other,
All horribly stirred
Against sister and brother;
Our green hopes were wilted and riven, our red-running blood was as dust.

And a foul poison ran
Through the veins of the world,
And we waited and wondered.
By magical ban
We were cruelly sundered,
Then a maniac hatred upcaught us and deep into hell we were hurled.

In the day of thy wrath,
We have wept, we have fasted,
We have crimsoned the sod
That thy worship has blasted,
And have seen thee stalk pale and triumphant where nations fell flat in thy path.

Yet out of the dust and the flame,
The squalor and muddle of crime,
A red waving blossom there came
And a scent on the tempest of time.
Heroic and splendid, we threw
Our lives to be oil in the fire,
But a marvel of fellowship grew
As the blaze bickered broader and higher,
And the soul of a people stood up, and spoke to us all from the pyre.

And lo, we are come to thy shrine,
For our hearts are made glad with a wine
That is death to the craven and base,
And thy shrine shall be burnt for our mirth
And thine altar be turned to thy bier,
What corner is left for thee here?
The veil of thy temple is rent—and behold, thou hast vanished, O Fear



I heard the trailing garments of the Night
     Sweep through her marble halls!
I saw her sable skirts all fringed with light
     From the celestial walls!

I felt her presence, by its spell of might,
     Stoop o'er me from above;
The calm, majestic presence of the Night,
     As of the one I love.

I heard the sounds of sorrow and delight,
     The manifold, soft chimes,
That fill the haunted chambers of the Night
     Like some old poet's rhymes.

From the cool cisterns of the midnight air
     My spirit drank repose;
The fountain of perpetual peace flows there,--
     From those deep cisterns flows.

O holy Night! from thee I learn to bear
     What man has borne before!
Thou layest thy finger on the lips of Care,
     And they complain no more.

Peace!  Peace!  Orestes-like I breathe this prayer!
     Descend with broad-winged flight,
The welcome, the thrice-prayed for, the most fair,
     The best-beloved Night



Yet one Song more! one high and solemn strain
Ere PAEAN! on thy temple's ruined wall
I hang the silent harp: there may its strings,
When the rude tempest shakes the aged pile,
Make melancholy music. One Song more!
PENATES! hear me! for to you I hymn
The votive lay. Whether, as sages deem,
Ye dwell in the inmost Heaven, the COUNSELLORS
Of JOVE; or if, SUPREME OF DEITIES,
All things are yours, and in your holy train

And wisest of Immortals, aweful Maid
ATHENIAN PALLAS. Venerable Powers!
Hearken your hymn of praise! tho' from your rites
Estranged, and exiled from your altars long,
In many a long and melancholy hour
Of solitude and sorrow, has my heart
With earnest longings prayed to rest at length
Beside your hallowed hearth--for PEACE is there!

Yes I have loved you long. I call on you
Yourselves to witness with what holy joy,
Shunning the polished mob of human kind,
I have retired to watch your lonely fires
And commune with myself. Delightful hours
That gave mysterious pleasure, made me know
All the recesses of my wayward heart,
Taught me to cherish with devoutest care
Its strange unworldly feelings, taught me too
The best of lessons--to respect myself!

Nor have I ever ceas'd to reverence you
DOMESTIC DEITIES! from the first dawn
Of reason, thro' the adventurous paths of youth
Even to this better day, when on mine ear
The uproar of contending nations sounds,
But like the passing wind--and wakes no pulse
To tumult. When a child--(for still I love
To dwell with fondness on my childish years,
Even as that Persian favorite would retire
From the court's dangerous pageantry and pomp,
To gaze upon his shepherd garb, and weep,
Rememb'ring humble happiness.) When first
A little one, I left my father's home,
I can remember the first grief I felt,
And the first painful smile that cloathed my front
With feelings not its own: sadly at night
I sat me down beside a stranger's hearth;
And when the lingering hour of rest was come,
First wet with tears my pillow. As I grew
In years and knowledge, and the course of Time
Developed the young feelings of my heart,
When most I loved in solitude to rove
Amid the woodland gloom; or where the rocks
Darken'd old Avon's stream, in the ivied cave
Recluse to sit and brood the future song,
Yet not the less, PENATES, loved I then
Your altars, not the less at evening hour
Delighted by the well-trimm'd fire to sit,
Absorbed in many a dear deceitful dream
Of visionary joys: deceitful dreams--
Not wholly vain--for painting purest joys,
They form'd to Fancy's mould her votary's heart.

By Cherwell's sedgey side, and in the meads
Where Isis in her calm clear stream reflects
The willow's bending boughs, at earliest dawn
In the noon-tide hour, and when the night-mists rose,
I have remembered you: and when the noise
Of loud intemperance on my lonely ear
Burst with loud tumult, as recluse I sat,
Pondering on loftiest themes of man redeemed
From servitude, and vice, and wretchedness,
Your peaceful altars and serener rites.
Nor did I cease to reverence you, when driven
Amid the jarring crowd, an unfit man
To mingle with the world; still, still my heart
Sighed for your sanctuary, and inly pined;
And loathing human converse, I have strayed
Where o'er the sea-beach chilly howl'd the blast,
And gaz'd upon the world of waves, and wished
That I were far beyond the Atlantic deep,
In woodland haunts--a sojourner with PEACE.

Not idly fabled they the Bards inspired,
Who peopled Earth with Deities. They trod
The wood with reverence where the DRYADS dwelt;
At day's dim dawn or evening's misty hour
They saw the OREADS on their mountain haunts.
And felt their holy influence, nor impure
Of thought--or ever with polluted hands
Touched they without a prayer the NAIAD'S spring;
Yet was their influence transient; such brief awe
Inspiring as the thunder's long loud peal
Not such your empire! in your votaries' breasts
No momentary impulse ye awake--
Nor fleeting like their local energies,
The deep devotion that your fanes impart.
O ye whom YOUTH has wilder'd on your way,
Or VICE with fair-mask'd foulness, or the lure
Of FAME that calls ye to her crowded paths
Return! for not in VICE's gay abodes,
Not in the unquiet unsafe halls of FAME
Does HAPPINESS abide! O ye who weep
Much for the many miseries of Mankind,
More for their vices, ye whose honest eyes
Frown on OPPRESSION,--ye whose honest hearts
Beat high when FREEDOM sounds her dread tocsin;--
O ye who quit the path of peaceful life
Crusading for mankind--a spaniel race
That lick the hand that beats them, or tear all
Return, for by their altars VIRTUE dwells
And HAPPINESS with her; for by their fires
TRANQUILLITY in no unsocial mood
Sits silent, listening to the pattering shower;
For, so SUSPICION sleep not at the gate
Of WISDOM,--FALSEHOOD shall not enter there.

As on the height of some huge eminence,
Reach'd with long labour, the way-faring man
Pauses awhile, and gazing o'er the plain
With many a sore step travelled, turns him then
Serious to contemplate the onward road,
And calls to mind the comforts of his home,
And sighs that he has left them, and resolves
To stray no more: I on my way of life
Muse thus PENATES, and with firmest faith
Devote myself to you. I will not quit
To mingle with the mob your calm abodes,
Where, by the evening hearth CONTENTMENT sits
And hears the cricket chirp; where LOVE delights
To dwell, and on your altars lays his torch
That burns with no extinguishable flame.

Hear me ye POWERS benignant! there is one
Must be mine inmate--for I may not chuse
But love him. He is one whom many wrongs
Have sicken'd of the world. There was a time
When he would weep to hear of wickedness
And wonder at the tale; when for the opprest
He felt a brother's pity, to the oppressor
A good man's honest anger. His quick eye
Betray'd each rising feeling, every thought
Leapt to his tongue. When first among mankind
He mingled, by himself he judged of them,
And loved and trusted them, to Wisdom deaf,
And took them to his bosom. FALSEHOOD met
Her unsuspecting victim, fair of front,
And lovely as Apega's sculptured form,
Like that false image caught his warm embrace
And gored his open breast. The reptile race
Clung round his bosom, and with viper folds
Encircling, stung the fool who fostered them.
His mother was SIMPLICITY, his sire
BENEVOLENCE; in earlier days he bore
His father's name; the world who injured him
Call him MISANTHROPY. I may not chuse
In the same school.

                   PENATES! some there are
Who say, that not in the inmost heaven ye dwell,
Gazing with eye remote on all the ways
A dearer interest to the human race
Links you, yourselves the SPIRITS OF THE DEAD.
No mortal eye may pierce the invisible world,
No light of human reason penetrate
That depth where Truth lies hid. Yet to this faith
My heart with instant sympathy assents;
And I would judge all systems and all faiths
By that best touchstone, from whose test DECEIT
Shrinks like the Arch-Fiend at Ithuriel's spear,
And SOPHISTRY'S gay glittering bubble bursts,
As at the spousals of the Nereid's son,
When that false Florimel, by her prototype
Display'd in rivalry, with all her charms
Dissolved away.

                Nor can the halls of Heaven
Give to the human soul such kindred joy,
As hovering o'er its earthly haunts it feels,
When with the breeze it wantons round the brow
Of one beloved on earth; or when at night
In dreams it comes, and brings with it the DAYS
And JOYS that are no more, Or when, perchance
With power permitted to alleviate ill
And fit the sufferer for the coming woe,
Some strange presage the SPIRIT breathes, and fills
The breast with ominous fear, and disciplines
For sorrow, pours into the afflicted heart
The balm of resignation, and inspires
With heavenly hope. Even as a Child delights
To visit day by day the favorite plant
His hand has sown, to mark its gradual growth,
And watch all anxious for the promised flower;
Thus to the blessed spirit, in innocence
And pure affections like a little child,
Sweet will it be to hover o'er the friends
Beloved; then sweetest if, as Duty prompts,
With earthly care we in their breasts have sown
The seeds of Truth and Virtue, holy flowers
Whose odour reacheth Heaven.

                      When my sick Heart,
(Sick with hope long delayed, than, which no care
Presses the crush'd heart heavier   from itself
Seeks the best comfort, often have I deemed
That thou didst witness every inmost thought
SEWARD! my dear dead friend! for not in vain,
Oh early summon'd in thy heavenly course!
Was thy brief sojourn here: me didst thou leave
With strengthen'd step to follow the right path
Till we shall meet again. Meantime I soothe
The deep regret of Nature, with belief,
My EDMUND! that thine eye's celestial ken
Pervades me now, marking no mean joy
The movements of the heart that loved thee well!

Such feelings Nature prompts, and hence your rites
With ceaseless grief Syrophanes bewail'd,
Mourning his age left childless, and his wealth
Heapt for an alien, he with fixed eye
Still on the imaged marble of the dead
Dwelt, pampering sorrow. Thither from his wrath
A safe asylum, fled the offending slave,
And garlanded the statue and implored
Softened the father, and he loved to see
The votive wreath renewed, and the rich smoke
Curl from the costly censer slow and sweet.
From Egypt soon the sorrow-soothing rites
Divulging spread; before your idol forms
By every hearth the blinded Pagan knelt,
Pouring his prayers to these, and offering there
Vain sacrifice or impious, and sometimes
With human blood your sanctuary defil'd:
Till the first BRUTUS, tyrant-conquering chief,
Arose; he first the impious rites put down,
He fitliest, who for FREEDOM lived and died,
The friend of humankind. Then did your feasts
Frequent recur and blameless; and when came
The solemn festival, whose happiest rites
Emblem'd EQUALITY, the holiest truth!
Crown'd with gay garlands were your statues seen,
To you the fragrant censer smok'd, to you
The rich libation flow'd: vain sacrifice!
For nor the poppy wreath nor fruits nor wine.
Ye ask, PENATES! nor the altar cleans'd
With many a mystic form; ye ask the heart
Made pure, and by domestic Peace and Love
Hallowed to you.

               Hearken your hymn of praise,
PENATES! to your shrines I come for rest,
There only to be found. Often at eve,
Amid my wanderings I have seen far off
The lonely light that spake of comfort there,
It told my heart of many a joy of home,
And my poor heart was sad. When I have gazed
From some high eminence on goodly vales
And cots and villages embower'd below,
The thought would rise that all to me was strange
Amid the scene so fair, nor one small spot
Where my tir'd mind might rest and call it home,
There is a magic in that little word;
It is a mystic circle that surrounds
Comforts and Virtues never known beyond
The hallowed limit. Often has my heart
Ached for that quiet haven; haven'd now,
I think of those in this world's wilderness
Who wander on and find no home of rest
Till to the grave they go! them POVERTY
Hollow-eyed fiend, the child of WEALTH and POWER,
Bad offspring of worse parents, aye afflicts,
Cankering with her foul mildews the chill'd heart--
Them WANT with scorpion scourge drives to the den
Of GUILT--them SLAUGHTER with the price of death
Buys for her raven brood. Oh not on them
Let fall thy thunder!

                     HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!
Then only shall be Happiness on earth
When Man shall feel your sacred power, and love
Your tranquil joys; then shall the city stand
A huge void sepulchre, and rising fair
Amid the ruins of the palace pile
The Olive grow, there shall the TREE OF PEACE
Strike its roots deep and flourish. This the state
Shall bless the race redeemed of Man, when WEALTH
And POWER and all their hideous progeny
Shall sink annihilate, and all mankind
Live in the equal brotherhood of LOVE.
Heart-calming hope and sure! for hitherward
Tend all the tumults of the troubled world,
Its woes, its wisdom, and its wickedness
Alike: so he hath will'd whose will is just.

Meantime, all hoping and expecting all
I come, studious of other lore than song,
Of my past years the solace and support:
Yet shall my Heart remember the past years
With honest pride, trusting that not in vain
Lives the pure song of LIBERTY and TRUTH. 

Giver of glowing light! 
Though but a god of other days, 
The kings and sages 
Of wiser ages 
Still live and gladden in thy genial rays! 
King of the tuneful lyre, 
Still poets' hymns to thee belong; 
Though lips are cold 
Whereon of old 
Thy beams all turn'd to worshipping and song! 
None triumph now for Python's death; 
But thou dost save 
From hungry grave 
The life that hangs upon a summer breath. 
Father of rosy day, 
No more thy clouds of incense rise; 
But waking flow'rs 
At morning hours, 
Give out their sweets to meet thee in the skies. 
No more thou listenest to hymns sublime; 
But they will leave 
On winds at eve, 
A solemn echo to the end of time. 


So true to thy word, So loving and kind!
Thy mercy so tender To all the lost race,
The vilest offender May turn and find grace. 

The mercy I feel To others I show,
Ye all may find favour Who come at his call,
O come to my Saviour, His grace is for all! 

To save what was lost, from heaven he came;
He offers you pardon; He bids you be free;
"If sin be your burden, O come unto me!" 

O let me commend My Saviour to you,
The publican's friend And Advocate too,
For you he is pleading His merits and death,

Then let us submit His grace to receive,
Fall down at his feet And gladly believe:
Our title to heaven His merits we take. 


Sinners, turn, why will ye die?
Made you with himself to live -
He the fatal cause demands,
Asks the work of his own hands,
Why, ye thankless creatures, why
Will ye cross his love, and die? 

Sinners, turn, why will ye die?
Died himself, that ye might live;
Will you let him die in vain?
Why, ye ransomed sinners, why
Will you slight his grace, and die? 

Sinners, turn, why will ye die?
He who all your lives hath strove,
Wooed you to embrace his love:
Will you not his grace receive?
Will you still refuse to live?
Why, ye long-sought sinners, why

Dead, already dead within,
Spiritually dead in sin,
Pant ye after second death?
Will you still in sin remain,
Greedy of eternal pain?
O ye dying sinners, why,
Why will you for ever die

Let the beasts their breath resign,
Strangers to the life divine;
Let their spirit downward go.
You for higher ends were born,
Dwell with him above the sky;
Why will you for ever die? 

You, on whom he favours showers,
You, possest of nobler powers,
You, of reason's powers possest,
You, with will and memory blest,
You, with finer sense endued,
Noblest of his creatures, why,
Why will you for ever die? 

You, whom he ordained to be
Transcripts of the Deity;
You, whom he in life doth hold;
You, for whom himself was sold;
You, on whom he still doth wait,
Whom he would again create;
Made by him, and purchased, why,
Why will you for ever die? 

You, who own his record true,
You, his chosen people, you,
You, who read his written word,
You, who see the gospel-light,
Claim a crown in Jesu's right;
Will the house of Israel die

What could your Redeemer do
More than he hath done for you?
Could he more than shed his blood?
After all his waste of love,
All his drawings from above,
Why will you resolve to die? 

Turn, he cries, ye sinners, turn;
He would have you turn and live,
He would all the world receive.
If your death were his delight,
Would he you to life invite?
Would he ask, obtest, and cry,
Why will you resolve to die? 

Dare not think him insincere:
Now, even now, your Saviour stands,
All day long he spreads his hands,
Cries, Ye will not happy be!
No, ye will not come to me!
Me, who life to none deny:
Why will you resolve to die? 

If to all His bowels move?
Will you not his word receive?
Will you not his OATH believe?
Mingled with his blood, they cry,
Why will you resolve to die

And take, through his blood, A power to draw near;
His kind invitation Ye sinners embrace,
Accepting salvation, Salvation by grace. 

Sent down from above, Who governs the skies,
In vehement love To sinners he cries,
Drink into my Spirit, Who happy would be,
And all things inherit By coming to me. 

O Saviour of all, Thy word we believe!
And come at thy call, Thy grace to receive;
The blessing is given Wherever thou art.
The earnest of heaven Is love in the heart. 

To us at thy feet The Comforter give,
Who gasp to admit Thy Spirit, and live;
The weakest believers Acknowledge for thine,
And fill us with rivers Of water divine. 

Ambassadors to rebels sends;
His messengers his place supply,

To cast our arms, our sins, away,
And find forgiveness at his feet. 

And proffered mercy, we embrace;
And gladly reconciled to thee,
Thy condescending goodness praise. 

A full acquittance we receive!
And criminals, with pardon blest,
We, at our Judge's instance, live

And let your joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet accord,
While ye surround his throne:
Let those refuse to sing
But servants of the heavenly King
May speak their joys abroad. 

That all the earth surveys
That rides upon the stormy sky,
And calms the roaring seas-
Our Father and our love;
He will send down his heavenly powers,
To carry us above. 

There we shall see his face,
And never, never sin;
There, from the rivers of his grace,
Drink endless pleasures in:
Yea, and before we rise
To that immortal state,
The thoughts of such amazing bliss
Should constant joys create. 

The men of grace have found
Glory begun below;
Celestial fruit on earthly ground
From faith and hope may grow:
Then let our songs abound,
And every tear be dry;
We are marching through Immanuel's grounds
To fairer worlds on high. 

Happy soul that free from harms
Rests within his Shepherd's arms!
Who his quiet shall molest?
Who shall violate his rest?
He who found the wandering sheep,

O that I might so believe,
On his only love rely,
Smile at the destroyer nigh;
Free from sin and servile fear,
All his care rejoice to prove,
All his paradise of love! 

Bring me back, and lead, and keep;
Take on thee my every care,
Bear me, on thy bosom bear:
Let me know my Shepherd's voice,
More and more in thee rejoice,
More and more of thee receive,
Ever in thy Spirit live: 

Live, till all thy life I know,
Gladly then from earth remove,
Gathered to the fold above. 

O that I at last may stand
With the sheep at thy right hand,
Take the crown so freely given,
Enter in by thee to heaven

Happy the man that finds the grace,
The wisdom coming from above,
The faith that sweetly works by love. 

Happy beyond description he
Who knows, The Saviour died for me,
The gift unspeakable obtains,
And heavenly understanding gains. 

Wisdom divine! Who tells the price
Of wisdom's costly merchandise
Wisdom to silver we prefer,
And gold is dross compared to her. 

Her hands are filled with length of days,
True riches, and immortal praise,

To purest joys she all invites,
Chaste, holy, spiritual delights;
Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
And all her flowery paths are peace. 

Happy the man who wisdom gains,
Thrice happy who his guest retains!
He owns, and shall for ever own,

Rejoice evermore With angels above,
With glad exultation Your triumph proclaim,

Hast saved us from grief, Hast saved us from sin;
The power of thy Spirit Hath set our hearts free,
And now we inherit All fulness in thee; 

All fulness of peace, All fulness of joy,
And spiritual bliss That never shall cloy:
A kingdom of heaven, A heaven below. 

No longer we join While sinners invite,
Nor envy the swine Their brutish delight;
Their joy is all sadness, Their mirth is all vain,
Their laughter is madness, Their pleasure is pain. 

O might they at last With sorrow return,
The pleasures to taste For which they were born;
The joy of believing, The heaven of love

And saved by grace alone,
Walking in all his ways they find
Their heaven on earth begun. 

The church triumphant in thy love,
Their mighty joys we know;
They sing the Lamb in hymns above,
And we in hymns below. 

Thee in thy glorious realm they praise,
And bow before thy throne,
We in the kingdom of thy grace:
The kingdoms are but one. 

The holy to the holiest leads,
From thence our spirits rise,
And he that in thy statutes treads
Shall meet thee in the skies. 

Happy the souls that first believed,
Joined by the unction from above
In mystic fellowship of love. 

Meek, simple followers of the Lamb,
They lived, and spake, and thought the same;
They joyfully conspired to raise
Their ceaseless sacrifice of praise. 

With grace abundantly endued,
A pure, believing multitude,
They all were of one heart and soul,
And only love inspired the whole. 

O what an age of golden days!
O what a choice, peculiar race!
Washed in the Lamb's all-cleansing blood,

Ye different sects, who all declare,
Your stronger proofs divinely give,

The gates of hell cannot prevail;
The church on earth can never fail;
Ah, join me to thy secret ones!
Ah, gather all thy living stones! 

Scattered o'er all the earth they lie,
Till thou collect them with thine eye,
Draw by the music of thy name,
And charm into a beauteous frame. 

For this the pleading Spirit groans,
And cries in all thy banished ones;
Greatest of gifts, thy love impart,
And make us of one mind and heart. 

Join every soul that looks to thee
In bonds of perfect charity;
And all in all for ever live

Great builder of thy church below,
If now thy Spirit moves my breast,
Hear, and fulfil thine own request! 

And wait thy sanctifying word,
And thee their utmost Saviour own,
Unite, and perfect them in one. 

O let them all thy mind express,
Stand forth thy chosen witnesses,
Thy power unto salvation show,
And perfect holiness below! 

In them let all mankind behold
Mighty their envious foes to move,
A proverb of reproach - and love. 

From every sinful wrinkle free,
Redeemed from all iniquity,
The fellowship of saints make known;

O might my lot be cast with these,
The least of Jesu's witnesses!
To wash his dear disciples' feet! 

This only thing do I require:
Thou knowest 'tis all my heart's desire
Freely what I receive to give,
The servant of thy church to live; 

And wait upon thy saints below;
Enjoy the grace to angels given,
And serve the royal heirs of heaven. 

And ask according to thy will,
Confirm the prayer, the seal impart,
And speak the answer to my heart. 

Father, Saviour of mankind,
Who hast on me bestowed
An immortal soul, designed
Come, and now reside in me,
Never, never to remove;
Make me just and good, like thee,
And full of power and love. 

Bid me in thy image rise,
A saint, a creature new,
True, and merciful, and wise,
And pure, and happy too.
This thy primitive design,
That I should in thee be blest,
Should within the arms divine
For ever, ever rest. 

Let thy will on me be done;
Fulfil my heart's desire,
Thee to know and love alone,
And rise in raptures higher;
Thee, descending on a cloud,
When with ravished eyes I see,
To all eternity

Weary souls, that wander wide
From the central point of bliss,
Fly to those dear wounds of his:
Sink into the purple flood;

Peace unspeakable, unknown;
By his pain he gives you ease,
Life by his expiring groan;
Rise, exalted by his fall,

O believe the record true,
Ye may now be happy too,
Find on earth the life of heaven,
Live the life of heaven above,
All the life of glorious love. 

This the universal bliss,
Bliss for every soul designed,
Blest to all eternity

Ye simple souls that stray
Far from the path of peace,
That lonely, unfrequented way
To life and happiness,
Why will ye folly love,
And throng the downward road,
And hate the wisdom from above,

Madness and misery
Ye count our life beneath;
And nothing great or good can see,
Or glorious, in our death:
As only born to grieve,
Beneath your feet we lie;
And utterly contemned we live,
And unlamented die. 

So wretched and obscure,
The men whom ye despise,
So foolish, impotent, and poor,
Above your scorn we rise:
We, through the Holy Ghost,
Can witness better things;
For He whose blood is all our boast
Hath made us priests and kings. 

Riches unsearchable
In Jesu's love we know;
And pleasures, springing from the well
Of life, our souls o'erflow;
The Spirit we receive
Of wisdom, grace, and power;
And always sorrowful we live,
Rejoicing evermore. 

Angels our servants are,
And keep in all our ways,
And in their watchful hands they bear
The sacred souls of grace;
Unto that heavenly bliss
They all our steps attend;

With him we walk in white,
We in his image shine,
Our robes are robes of glorious light,
Our righteousness divine;
On all the kings of earth
With pity we look down,
And claim, in virtue of our birth,
A never-fading crown. 


Behold the Saviour of mankind
Nailed to the shameful tree!
How vast the love that him inclined
To bleed and die for thee! 

Hark, how he groans! while nature shakes,
And earth's strong pillars bend;
The temple's veil in sunder breaks,
The solid marbles rend. 

'Tis done! the precious ransom's paid,
"Receive my soul," he cries!
See where he bows his sacred head!
He bows his head, and dies! 

But soon he'll break death's envious chain,
And in full glory shine:
Was ever love, like thine

Extended on a cursed tree,
Besmeared with dust, and sweat, and blood,
See there, the king of glory see!

Who, who, my Saviour, this hath done?
Who could thy sacred body wound?
No guilt thy spotless heart hath known,
No guile hath in thy lips been found. 

I, I alone, have done the deed!
'Tis I thy sacred flesh have torn;
Pointed the nail, and fixed the thorn. 

The burden, for me to sustain
To heal me, thou hast borne my pain;
To bless me, thou a curse wast made. 

In the devouring lion's teeth,
Torn, and forsook of all, I lay;
Thou sprang'st into the jaws of death,
From death to save the helpless prey. 

Saviour how shall I proclaim?
How pay the mighty debt I owe?
Let all I have, and all I am,
Ceaseless to all thy glory show. 

Too much to thee I cannot give;
Too much I cannot do for thee;
Let all thy love, and all thy grief,
Graven on my heart for ever be! 

The meek, the still, the lowly mind,
And love, with softest pity joined,
For those that trample on thy blood! 


Still let thy tears, thy groans, thy sighs,
O'erflow my eyes, and heave my breast,
Till loose from flesh and earth I rise,
And ever in thy bosom rest. 



Saviour, if thy precious love
Could be merited by mine,
Faith these mountains would remove;
Faith would make me ever thine:
But when all my care and pains
Worth can ne'er create in me,
Nought by me thy fulness gains;
Vain the hope to purchase thee. 

Cease, O man, thy worth to weigh,
Give the needless contest o'er;
Mine thou art! while thus I say,
Yield thee up, and ask no more:
What thy estimate may be,
Only can by him be told
Who, to ransom wretched thee,
Thee to gain, himself was sold. 

But when all in me is sin,
How can I thy grace obtain?
How presume thyself to win?
Or if thou the means supply,
Lo to thee I all resign!
How I ask not, - ever thine. 

Come, ye weary sinners, come,
All who groan beneath your load,
Come, ye guilty spirits oppressed,
Answer to the Saviour's call,
"Come, and I will give you rest,
Come, and I will save you all
 


We thy kindest word obey;
Faithful let thy mercies prove,
Take our load of guilt away;
Fain we would on thee rely,
Cast on thee our every care,
To thine arms of mercy fly,
Find our lasting quiet there. 

Burdened with a world of grief,
Burdened with our sinful load,
Burdened with this unbelief,
Lo! we come to thee for ease,
True and gracious as thou art,
Now our groaning souls release,
Write forgiveness on our heart. 

He comes to meet us from the sky
In mildest majesty;
Full of unutterable grace,
He calls the weary burdened race,
"Come all for help to me



Hymn to Beauty

Do you come from Heaven or rise from the abyss, 
Beauty? Your gaze, divine and infernal, 
Pours out confusedly benevolence and crime, 
And one may for that, compare you to wine.

You contain in your eyes the sunset and the dawn; 
You scatter perfumes like a stormy night; 
Your kisses are a philtre, your mouth an amphora, 
Which make the hero weak and the child courageous.

Do you come from the stars or rise from the black pit? 
Destiny, bewitched, follows your skirts like a dog; 
You sow at random joy and disaster, 
And you govern all things but answer for nothing.

You walk upon corpses which you mock, O Beauty! 
Of your jewels Horror is not the least charming, 
And Murder, among your dearest trinkets, 
Dances amorously upon your proud belly.

The dazzled moth flies toward you, O candle!
Crepitates, flames and says: 'Blessed be this flambeau!'
The panting lover bending o'er his fair one
Looks like a dying man caressing his own tomb,

Whether you come from heaven or from hell, who cares, 
O Beauty! Huge, fearful, ingenuous monster! 
If your regard, your smile, your foot, open for me 
An Infinite I love but have not ever known?

Who cares, if you make, — fay with the velvet eyes, 
The world less hideous, the minutes less leaden?



Hymn to Beauty 

Did you spring out of heaven or the abyss, 
Beauty? Your gaze infernal, yet divine, 
Spreads infamy and glory, grief and bliss, 
And therefore you can be compared to wine.

Your eyes contain both sunset and aurora: 
You give off scents, like evenings storm-deflowered: 
Your kisses are a philtre: an amphora 
Your mouth, that cows the brave, and spurs the coward.

Climb you from gulfs, or from the stars descend? 
Fate, like a fawning hound, to heel you've brought; 
You scatter joy and ruin without end, 
Ruling all things, yet answering for naught.

You trample men to death, and mock their clamour. 
Amongst your gauds pale Horror gleams and glances, 
And Murder, not the least of them in glamour, 
On your proud belly amorously dances.

The dazzled insect seeks your candle-rays, 
Crackles, and burns, and seems to bless his doom. 
The groom bent o'er his bride as in a daze, 
Seems, like a dying man, to stroke his tomb.

What matter if from hell or heaven born, 
Tremendous monster, terrible to view? 
Your eyes and smile reveal to me, like morn, 
The Infinite I love but never knew.

The answer — Fay with eyes of velvet, ray, 
Rhythm, and perfume! — if you make less hideous 
Our universe, less tedious leave our day.



Hymn to Beauty

Did you fall from high heaven or surge from the abyss, 
O Beauty? Your bright gaze, infernal and divine, 
Confusedly pours out courage and cowardice, 
Or love and crime. Therefore men liken you to wine.

Your eyes hold all the sunset and the dawn, you are 
As rich in fragrances as a tempestuous night, 
Your kisses are a philtre and your mouth a jar 
Filling the child with valor and the man with fright.

Did the stars mould you or the pit's obscurity? 
You bring at random Paradise or Juggernaut. 
Fate sniffs your skirts with a charmed dog's servility, 
You govern all and yet are answerable for naught.

Beauty, you walk on corpses of dead men you mock. 
Among your store of gems, Horror is not the least; 
Murder, amid the dearest trinkets of your stock, 
Dances on your proud belly like a ruttish beast.

Candle, the transient moth flies dazzled to your light, 
Crackles and flames and says: 'Blessed this fiery doom!' 
The panting lover with his mistress in the night 
Looks like a dying man caressing his own tomb.

Are you from heaven or hell, Beauty that we adore? 
Who cares? A dreadful, huge, ingenuous monster, you!
So but your glance, your smile, your foot open a door
Upon an Infinite I love but never knew.

Who cares? Sister to sirens or to seraphim?
So but, dark fey, you shed your perfume, rhythm and sheen
To make the world less hideous and Time less grim.






Faint, bleeding, of his robes bereft,
'Ready to perish' by the way,
'Mid craggy wilds by robbers left,
A lonely Jewish traveller lay.


A priest of Judah, passing by,
The sufferer saw, and help denied.
A Levite toward him turned his eye,
And 'passed by on the other side.'


A traveller from Samaria came,-
Whose nation's bosom long had burned
With hatred of the Jewish name,-
And toward the wounded stranger turned.


As nearer, on his beast, he drew,
A thrill of pity through him ran;-
He saw not there a hated Jew;
He only saw a suffering man.


He saw him;-from his own scant store
Of oil and wine he filled his cup,
From his own robe a bandage tore,
And bathed his wounds and bound them up;


On his own beast the sufferer laid,
And to an hospitable shed
Bore him,-for all his nursing paid,
And left him on a grateful bed.


'Go, do thou likewise!' Thus said He,
Who gave the world this touching tale;-
Tread, each alone, Death's shadowy vale. 

Weary travellers are we,
And our word is briefly spoken;
We must lean on charity,
For our 'stay and staff' is broken.


We are widows;-o'er the dead
Oft we bend, to feed our sorrow;
But the grave can give no bread,
And we have none for to-morrow.


We are fatherless;-the crowd
Passes by and does not heed us.
We are hungry;-but the proud
Shelter not, nor clothe, nor feed us.


From our loved and lost ones parted,
We are journeying on alone.
We are sick and broken-hearted,-
For our hearts were not of stone.


We would gladly serve you, neighbour,
Could we earn the coarsest meal;
But, we 're yet too young to labor;-
Must we starve,-or, must we steal?


We'll do neither!-there are, round us,
Pitying hearts and willing hands;
Woman's melting eye has found us;
She beside us pleading stands.


Our fair friends, here, have been vying
With each other in our aid,
Night and day their needles plying,-
See, what charming things they've made!


Let us lead you to this table,
By their fairy fingers dressed;-
As you stand here, you'll be able
To look round on all the rest.


This young lady is our sister;-
Is n't this a rare display?
There! we knew you'd not resist her;-
Pray you, Madam, step this way.


This good woman is our mother,
For a mother's heart is hers.
All good people help each other,


Friends, we have been faint and weary
Travellers on life's thorny way;
But our path looks now less dreary;
Sunshine falls upon 't to-day.


Love's warm sunshine! How resplendent
Art thou to the Orphan boy,
Whom thou makest Independent,
On this day of general joy

Shall that old chamber be forgot,
Where first the light divine
Shone on our infant Sunday School,
So pleasant, but lang syne?
'T was pleasant, but lang syne, my friends,
'T was pleasant, but lang syne,
We'll not forget that chamber where
We prayed and sung lang syne.


Shall Friend-Street Chapel be forgot,
To which, in lengthening line,
When that old room was full, we marched,
In twenty eight or nine?
O, that appears lang syne, my friends,
But, though it was lang syne,
We'll not forget the Chapel where
We used to meet lang syne.


Shall our old teachers be forgot,
Whose voice and look benign
First drew us to the Sabbath School,
And taught us there lang syne?
O, was not that lang syne, my friends,
O, was it not lang syne?
But still we thank and bless them all,
For teaching us lang syne.


Some of those voices death hath hushed,
And closed those kindly eyen,
That were so cheering to our hearts,
When we were sad lang syne.
O, was not that lang syne, my friends?
It was, indeed, lang syne;
And heavenly hymns those voices sing,
That sung with us lang syne.


Our white-haired Pastor, should he soon
Earth's toils and joys resign,
Shall be remembered by us all,
For what he did lang syne.
O, how he loved us all, my friends,
He loved us all lang syne,
And great be his reward in heaven,
For loving us lang syne!


Nor be our present friends forgot,
Who work the Gospel mine,
The gems of truth lang syne.
O, that was lang, lang syne, my friends,
Yes, that was lang, lang syne,
But still those gems are just as bright,
As were they lang, lang syne.


O Father! with those gems, more rich
Than gold or silver fine,
Be all our spirits crowned, as were
Thy Son's and saints' lang syne.
They've worn their crowns lang syne;
O, help us tread the paths they trod,
While serving thee lang syne

Before all the wondrous shows of the widespread space around him, what living, sentient thing loves not the all-joyous light -- with its colors, its rays and undulations, its gentle omnipresence in the form of the wakening Day? The giant-world of the unresting constellations inhales it as the innermost soul of life, and floats dancing in its blue flood -- the sparkling, ever-tranquil stone, the thoughtful, imbibing plant, and the wild, burning multiform beast inhales it -- but more than all, the lordly stranger with the sense-filled eyes, the swaying walk, and the sweetly closed, melodious lips. Like a king over earthly nature, it rouses every force to countless transformations, binds and unbinds innumerable alliances, hangs its heavenly form around every earthly substance. -- Its presence alone reveals the marvelous splendor of the kingdoms of the world. 

Aside I turn to the holy, unspeakable, mysterious Night. Afar lies the world -- sunk in a deep grave -- waste and lonely is its place. In the chords of the bosom blows a deep sadness. I am ready to sink away in drops of dew, and mingle with the ashes. -- The distances of memory, the wishes of youth, the dreams of childhood, the brief joys and vain hopes of a whole long life, arise in gray garments, like an evening vapor after the sunset. In other regions the light has pitched its joyous tents. What if it should never return to its children, who wait for it with the faith of innocence? 


Must the morning always return? Will the despotism of the earthly never cease? Unholy activity consumes the angel-visit of the Night. Will the time never come when Love's hidden sacrifice shall burn eternally? To the Light a season was set; but everlasting and boundless is the dominion of the Night. -- Endless is the duration of sleep. Holy Sleep -- gladden not too seldom in this earthly day-labor, the devoted servant of the Night. Fools alone mistake thee, knowing nought of sleep but the shadow which, in the twilight of the real Night, thou pitifully castest over us. They feel thee not in the golden flood of the grapes -- in the magic oil of the almond tree -- and the brown juice of the poppy. They know not that it is thou who hauntest the bosom of the tender maiden, and makest a heaven of her lap -- never suspect it is thou, opening the doors to Heaven, that steppest to meet them out of ancient stories, bearing the key to the dwellings of the blessed, silent messenger of secrets infinite. 

Once when I was shedding bitter tears, when, dissolved in pain, my hope was melting away, and I stood alone by the barren mound which in its narrow dark bosom hid the vanished form of my life -- lonely as never yet was lonely man, driven by anxiety unspeakable -- powerless, and no longer anything but a conscious misery. -- As there I looked about me for help, unable to go on or to turn back, and clung to the fleeting, extinguished life with an endless longing: -- then, out of the blue distances -- from the hills of my ancient bliss, came a shiver of twilight -- and at once snapt the bond of birth -- the chains of the Light. Away fled the glory of the world, and with it my mourning -- the sadness flowed together into a new, unfathomable world -- Thou, Night-inspiration, heavenly Slumber, didst come upon me -- the region gently upheaved itself; over it hovered my unbound, newborn spirit. The mound became a cloud of dust -- and through the cloud I saw the glorified face of my beloved. In her eyes eternity reposed -- I laid hold of her hands, and the tears became a sparkling bond that could not be broken. Into the distance swept by, like a tempest, thousands of years. On her neck I welcomed the new life with ecstatic tears. It was the first, the only dream -- and just since then I have held fast an eternal, unchangeable faith in the heaven of the Night, and its Light, the Beloved. 

Now I know when will come the last morning -- when the Light no more scares away Night and Love -- when sleep shall be without waking, and but one continuous dream. I feel in me a celestial exhaustion. Long and weariful was my pilgrimage to the holy grave, and crushing was the cross. The crystal wave, which, imperceptible to the ordinary sense, springs in the dark bosom of the mound against whose foot breaks the flood of the world, he who has tasted it, he who has stood on the mountain frontier of the world, and looked across into the new land, into the abode of the Night -- truly he turns not again into the tumult of the world, into the land where dwells the Light in ceaseless unrest. 

On those heights he builds for himself tabernacles -- tabernacles of peace, there longs and loves and gazes across, until the welcomest of all hours draws him down into the waters of the spring -- afloat above remains what is earthly, and is swept back in storms, but what became holy by the touch of love, runs free through hidden ways to the region beyond, where, like fragrances, it mingles with love asleep. 

Still wakest thou, cheerful Light, that weary man to his labor -- and into me pourest joyous life -- but thou wilest me not away from Memory's moss-grown monument. Gladly will I stir busy hands, everywhere behold where thou hast need of me -- praise the lustre of thy splendor -- pursue unwearied the lovely harmonies of thy skilled handicraft -- gladly contemplate the clever pace of thy mighty, luminous clock -- explore the balance of the forces and the laws of the wondrous play of countless worlds and their seasons. But true to the Night remains my secret heart, and to creative Love, her daughter. Canst thou show me a heart eternally true? has thy sun friendly eyes that know me? do thy stars lay hold of my longing hand? and return me the tender pressure and the caressing word? was it thou did adorn them with colors and a flickering outline -- or was it she who gave to thy jewels a higher, a dearer weight? What delight, what pleasure offers thy life, to outweigh the transports of Death? Wears not everything that inspires us the color of the Night? She sustains thee mother-like, and to her thou owest all thy glory. Thou wouldst vanish into thyself -- in boundless space thou wouldst dissolve, if she did not hold thee fast, if she swaddled thee not, so that thou grewest warm, and flaming, begot the universe. Truly I was, before thou wast -- the mother sent me with my brothers and sisters to inhabit thy world, to hallow it with love that it might be an ever-present memorial -- to plant it with flowers unfading. As yet they have not ripened, these thoughts divine -- as yet is there small trace of our coming revelation -- One day thy clock will point to the end of time, and then thou shalt be as one of us, and shalt, full of ardent longing, be extinguished and die. I feel in me the close of thy activity -- heavenly freedom, and blessed return. With wild pangs I recognize thy distance from our home, thy resistance against the ancient, glorious heaven. Thy rage and thy raving are in vain. Unscorchable stands the cross -- victory-banner of our breed. 

Over I journey 
And for each pain 
A pleasant sting only 
Shall one day remain. 
Yet in a few moments 
Then free am I, 
And intoxicated 
In Love's lap lie. 
Life everlasting 
Lifts, wave-like, at me, 
I gaze from its summit 
Down after thee. 
Your lustre must vanish 
Yon mound underneath -- 
A shadow will bring thee 
Thy cooling wreath. 
Oh draw at my heart, love, 
Draw till I'm gone, 
That, fallen asleep, I 
Still may love on. 
I feel the flow of 
Death's youth-giving flood 
To balsam and ether 
Transform my blood -- 
I live all the daytime 
In faith and in might 
And in holy fire 
I die every night. 

In ancient times, over the widespread families of men an iron Fate ruled with dumb force. A gloomy oppression swathed their heavy souls -- the earth was boundless -- the abode of the gods and their home. From eternal ages stood its mysterious structure. Beyond the red hills of the morning, in the sacred bosom of the sea, dwelt the sun, the all-enkindling, living Light. An aged giant upbore the blissful world. Fast beneath mountains lay the first-born sons of mother Earth. Helpless in their destroying fury against the new, glorious race of gods, and their kindred, glad-hearted men. The ocean's dark green abyss was the lap of a goddess. In crystal grottos revelled a luxuriant folk. Rivers, trees, flowers, and beasts had human wits. Sweeter tasted the wine -- poured out by Youth-abundance -- a god in the grape-clusters -- a loving, motherly goddess upgrew in the full golden sheaves -- love's sacred inebriation was a sweet worship of the fairest of the god-ladies -- Life rustled through the centuries like one spring-time, an ever-variegated festival of heaven-children and earth-dwellers. All races childlike adored the ethereal, thousand-fold flame as the one sublimest thing in the world. There was but one notion, a horrible dream-shape -- 

That fearsome to the merry tables strode, 
A wrapt the spirit there in wild fright. 
The gods themselves no counsel knew nor showed 
To fill the anxious hearts with comfort light. 
Mysterious was the monster's pathless road, 
Whose rage no prayer nor tribute could requite; 
'Twas Death who broke the banquet up with fears, 
With anguish, dire pain, and bitter tears. 

Eternally from all things here disparted 
That sway the heart with pleasure's joyous flow, 
Divided from the loved ones who've departed, 
Tossed by longing vain, unceasing woe -- 
In a dull dream to struggle, faint and thwarted, 
Seemed all was granted to the dead below. 
Broke lay the merry wave of human bliss 
On Death's inevitable, rocky cliff. 

With daring spirit and a passion deep, 
Did man ameliorate the horrid blight, 
A gentle youth puts out his torch, to sleep -- 
The end, just like a harp's sigh, comes light. 
Cool shadow-floods o'er melting memory creep, 
So sang the song, into its sorry need. 
Still undeciphered lay the endless Night -- 
The solemn symbol of a far-off might. 

The old world began to decline. The pleasure-garden of the young race withered away -- up into more open, desolate regions, forsaking his childhood, struggled the growing man. The gods vanished with their retinue -- Nature stood alone and lifeless. Dry Number and rigid Measure bound it with iron chains. Into dust and air the priceless blossoms of life fell away in words obscure. Gone was wonder-working Faith, and its all-transforming, all-uniting angel-comrade, the Imagination. A cold north wind blew unkindly over the rigid plain, and the rigid wonderland first froze, then evaporated into ether. The far depths of heaven filled with glowing worlds. Into the deeper sanctuary, into the more exalted region of feeling, the soul of the world retired with all its earthly powers, there to rule until the dawn should break of universal Glory. No longer was the Light the abode of the gods, and the heavenly token of their presence -- they drew over themselves the veil of the Night. The Night became the mighty womb of revelations -- into it the gods went back -- and fell asleep, to go abroad in new and more glorious shapes over the transfigured world. Among the people who too early were become of all the most scornful and insolently estranged from the blessed innocence of youth, appeared the New World with a face never seen before -- in the poverty of a poetic shelter -- a son of the first virgin and mother -- the eternal fruit of mysterious embrace. The foreboding, rich-blossoming wisdom of the East at once recognized the beginning of the new age -- A star showed the way to the humble cradle of the king. In the name of the distant future, they did him homage with lustre and fragrance, the highest wonders of Nature. In solitude the heavenly heart unfolded to a flower-chalice of almighty love -- upturned toward the supreme face of the father, and resting on the bliss-foreboding bosom of the sweetly solemn mother. With deifying fervor the prophetic eye of the blooming child beheld the years to come, foresaw, untroubled over the earthly lot of his own days, the beloved offspring of his divine stem. Ere long the most childlike souls, by true love marvellously possessed, gathered about him. Like flowers sprang up a strange new life in his presence. Words inexhaustible and the most joyful tidings fell like sparks of a divine spirit from his friendly lips. From a far shore, born under the clear sky of Hellas, came a singer to Palestine, and gave up his whole heart to the wonder-child: 

The youth thou art who ages long hast stood 
Upon our graves, so deeply lost in thought; 
A sign of comfort in the dusky gloom 
For high humanity, a joyful start. 
What dropped us all into abyssmal woe, 
Pulls us forward with sweet yearning now. 
In everlasting life death found its goal, 
For thou art Death who at last makes us whole. 

Yet weep thy loved ones tears of joy, tears of feeling and endless thanksgiving over your grave -- joyously startled, they see thee rise again, and themselves with thee -- behold thee weep with sweet fervor on the blessed bosom of thy mother, solemnly walking with thy friends, uttering words plucked as from the Tree of Life; see thee hasten, full of longing, into thy father's arms, bearing with thee youthful humanity, and the inexhaustible cup of the golden future. Soon the mother hastened after thee -- in heavenly triumph -- she was the first with thee in the new home. Since then, long ages have flowed past, and in ever-increasing splendor have stirred your new creation -- and thousands have, away from pangs and tortures, followed thee, filled with faith and longing and fidelity -- walking about with thee and the heavenly virgin in the kingdom of love, serving in the temple of heavenly Death, and forever thine. 

Uplifted is the stone -- 
And all mankind is risen -- 
We all remain thine own. 
And vanished is our prison. 
All troubles flee away 
Thy golden bowl before, 
For Earth and Life give way 
At the last and final supper. 

To the marriage Death doth call -- 
The virgins standeth back -- 
The lamps burn lustrous all -- 
Of oil there is no lack -- 
If the distance would only fill 
With the sound of you walking alone 
And that the stars would call 
Us all with human tongues and tone. 

Unto thee, O Mary 
A thousand hearts aspire. 
In this life of shadows 
Thee only they desire. 
In thee they hope for delivery 
With visionary expectation -- 
If only thou, O holy being 
Could clasp them to thy breast. 

With bitter torment burning, 
So many who are consumed 
At last from this world turning 
To thee have looked and fled, 
Helpful thou hast appeared 
To so many in pain. 
Now to them we come, 
To never go out again. 

At no grave can weep 
Any who love and pray. 
The gift of Love they keep, 
From none can it be taken away. 
To soothe and quiet his longing, 
Night comes and inspires -- 
Heaven's children round him thronging 
Watch and guard his heart. 

Have courage, for life is striding 
To endless life along; 
Stretched by inner fire, 
Our sense becomes transfigured. 
One day the stars above 
Shall flow in golden wine, 
We will enjoy it all, 
And as stars we will shine. 

The love is given freely, 
And Separation is no more. 
The whole life heaves and surges 
Like a sea without a shore. 
Just one night of bliss -- 
One everlasting poem -- 
And the sun we all share 

Longing for Death 


Into the bosom of the earth, 
Out of the Light's dominion, 
Death's pains are but a bursting forth, 
Sign of glad departure. 
Swift in the narrow little boat, 
Swift to the heavenly shore we float. 

Blessed be the everlasting Night, 
And blessed the endless slumber. 
We are heated by the day too bright, 
And withered up with care. 
We're weary of a life abroad, 
And we now want our Father's home. 

What in this world should we all 
Do with love and with faith? 
That which is old is set aside, 
And the new may perish also. 
Alone he stands and sore downcast 
Who loves with pious warmth the Past. 

The Past where the light of the senses 
In lofty flames did rise; 
Where the Father's face and hand 
All men did recognize; 
And, with high sense, in simplicity 
Many still fit the original pattern. 

The Past wherein, still rich in bloom, 
Man's strain did burgeon glorious, 
And children, for the world to come, 
Sought pain and death victorious, 
And, through both life and pleasure spake, 
Yet many a heart for love did break. 

The Past, where to the flow of youth 
And truly to an early death 
Did commit his sweet life. 
Fear and torture patiently he bore 
So that he would be loved forever. 

With anxious yearning now we see 
That Past in darkness drenched, 
With this world's water never we 
Shall find our hot thirst quenched. 
To our old home we have to go 
That blessed time again to know. 

What yet doth hinder our return 
To loved ones long reposed? 
Their grave limits our lives. 
We are all sad and afraid. 
We can search for nothing more -- 
The heart is full, the world is void. 

Infinite and mysterious, 
Thrills through us a sweet trembling -- 
As if from far there echoed thus 
A sigh, our grief resembling. 
Our loved ones yearn as well as we, 
And sent to us this longing breeze. 

Down to the sweet bride, and away 
Have courage, evening shades grow gray 
To those who love and grieve. 
A dream will dash our chains apart, 
And lay us in the Father's lap. 

Companies produce commodities in different types, 
And then have marketing and have hypes.
Selling increases due to proper advertisement, 
It develops through mass media and investment.

We do get hype in radio and T. 

V screen, 
In hype role of biddies is important as seen.
In bus stand and platform we see attractive poster, 
We too see in waiting places and in cloister.

It is seen many people purchase commodities, 
It is for their looking at T. 

V and hope of facilities.
The selling of product too depends upon packing, 
Dinky cover of product ensures people banking.

There is beautiful photo in pack and in label, 
It attracts the children to buy, it is not fable.
There are some institutions that they advertise, 
Among those private educational institutions do rise.

Guardians of the students wish here admission, 
To make them earning tree is their ambition.
Rare guardians do search spiritual education, 
In where value of life is main and is foundation.

The people in society must pay attention, 
They should aim at value and life perfection.
They oughtn't to purchase commodities as they like, 
They should judge the quality first than to hike.

BOOK I
     DEEP in the shady sadness of a vale
Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,
Far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star,
Sat gray-hair'd Saturn, quiet as a stone,
Still as the silence round about his lair;
Forest on forest hung above his head
Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,
Not so much life as on a summer's day
Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass,
But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.
A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more
By reason of his fallen divinity
Spreading a shade: the Naiad 'mid her reeds
Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips.

     Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went,
No further than to where his feet had stray'd,
And slept there since.  Upon the sodden ground
His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,
Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed;
While his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the Earth,
His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.

     It seem'd no force could wake him from his place;
But there came one, who with a kindred hand
Touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low
With reverence, though to one who knew it not.
By her in stature the tall Amazon
Had stood a pigmy's height: she would have ta'en
Achilles by the hair and bent his neck;
Or with a finger stay'd Ixion's wheel.
Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx,
Pedestal'd haply in a palace court,
When sages look'd to Egypt for their lore.
But oh! how unlike marble was that face:
How beautiful, if sorrow had not made
Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty's self.
There was a listening fear in her regard,
As if calamity had but begun;
As if the vanward clouds of evil days
Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear
Was with its stored thunder labouring up.
One hand she press'd upon that aching spot
Where beats the human heart, as if just there,
Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain:
The other upon Saturn's bended neck
She laid, and to the level of his ear
Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake
In solemn tenor and deep organ tone:
Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue
Would come in these like accents; O how frail
"Saturn, look up!---though wherefore, poor old King?
I have no comfort for thee, no not one:
I cannot say, 'O wherefore sleepest thou?'
For heaven is parted from thee, and the earth
And ocean too, with all its solemn noise,
Has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air
Is emptied of thine hoary majesty.
Thy thunder, conscious of the new command,
Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house;
And thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands
Scorches and burns our once serene domain.
O aching time! O moments big as years!
All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,
And press it so upon our weary griefs
That unbelief has not a space to breathe.
Saturn, sleep on:---O thoughtless, why did I
Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?
Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes?
Saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep


     As when, upon a tranced summer-night,
Those green-rob'd senators of mighty woods,
Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,
Dream, and so dream all night without a stir,
Save from one gradual solitary gust
Which comes upon the silence, and dies off,
As if the ebbing air had but one wave;
So came these words and went; the while in tears
She touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground,
Just where her fallen hair might be outspread
A soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet.
One moon, with alteration slow, had shed
Her silver seasons four upon the night,
And still these two were postured motionless,
Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern;
Until at length old Saturn lifted up
His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone,
And all the gloom and sorrow ofthe place,
As with a palsied tongue, and while his beard
Shook horrid with such aspen-malady:
"O tender spouse of gold Hyperion,
Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face;
Look up, and let me see our doom in it;
Look up, and tell me if this feeble shape
Is Saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice
Of Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow,
Naked and bare of its great diadem,
Peers like the front of Saturn? Who had power
To make me desolate? Whence came the strength?
How was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth,
While Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp?
But it is so; and I am smother'd up,
And buried from all godlike exercise
Of influence benign on planets pale,
Of admonitions to the winds and seas,
Of peaceful sway above man's harvesting,
And all those acts which Deity supreme
Doth ease its heart of love in.---I am gone
Away from my own bosom: I have left
My strong identity, my real self,
Somewhere between the throne, and where I sit
Here on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search!
Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round
Upon all space: space starr'd, and lorn of light;
Space region'd with life-air; and barren void;
Spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.---
Search, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest
A certain shape or shadow, making way
With wings or chariot fierce to repossess
A heaven he lost erewhile: it must---it must
Be of ripe progress---Saturn must be King.
Yes, there must be a golden victory;
Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival
Upon the gold clouds metropolitan,
Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir
Of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be
Beautiful things made new, for the surprise
Of the sky-children; I will give command:
Thea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?"
This passion lifted him upon his feet,
And made his hands to struggle in the air,
His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat,
His eyes to fever out, his voice to cease.
He stood, and heard not Thea's sobbing deep;
A little time, and then again he snatch'd
Utterance thus.---"But cannot I create?
Cannot I form? Cannot I fashion forth
Another world, another universe,
To overbear and crumble this to nought?
Where is another Chaos? Where?"---That word
Found way unto Olympus, and made quake
The rebel three.---Thea was startled up,
And in her bearing was a sort of hope,
As thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe.

     "This cheers our fallen house: come to our friends,
O Saturn! come away, and give them heart;
I know the covert, for thence came I hither

"
Thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went
With backward footing through the shade a space:
He follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the way
Through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist
Which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.

     Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,
More sorrow like to this, and such like woe,
Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe:
The Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound,
Groan'd for the old allegiance once more,
And listen'd in sharp pain for Saturn's voice.
But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept
His sov'reigny, and rule, and majesy;---
Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire
Still sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up
For as among us mortals omens drear
Fright and perplex, so also shuddered he---
Not at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech,
Or the familiar visiting of one
Upon the first toll of his passing-bell,
Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp;
But horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve,
Oft made Hyperion ache.  His palace bright,
Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold,
And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks,
Glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts,
Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries;
And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds
Flush'd angerly: while sometimes eagles' wings,
Darken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard
Also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths
Of incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills,
Instead of sweets, his ample palate took
Savor of poisonous brass and metal sick:
And so, when harbor'd in the sleepy west,
After the full completion of fair day,---
For rest divine upon exalted couch,
And slumber in the arms of melody,
He pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease
With stride colossal, on from hall to hall;
While far within each aisle and deep recess,
His winged minions in close clusters stood,
Amaz'd and full offear; like anxious men
Who on wide plains gather in panting troops,
When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.
Even now, while Saturn, rous'd from icy trance,
Went step for step with Thea through the woods,
Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,
Came slope upon the threshold of the west;
Then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope
In smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes,
Blown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet
And wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies;
And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,
In fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,
That inlet to severe magnificence

     He enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath;
His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,
And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,
That scar'd away the meek ethereal Hours
And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared
From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,
Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,
And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,
Until he reach'd the great main cupola;
There standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot,
And from the basements deep to the high towers
Jarr'd his own golden region; and before
The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd,
His voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,
To this result: "O dreams of day and night!
O monstrous forms! O effigies of pain!
O spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom!
O lank-eared phantoms of black-weeded pools!
Why do I know ye? why have I seen ye? why
Is my eternal essence thus distraught
To see and to behold these horrors new?
Saturn is fallen, am I too to fall?
Am I to leave this haven of my rest,
This cradle of my glory, this soft clime,
This calm luxuriance of blissful light,
These crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes,
Of all my lucent empire?  It is left
Deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine.
The blaze, the splendor, and the symmetry,
I cannot see but darkness, death, and darkness.
Even here, into my centre of repose,
The shady visions come to domineer,
Insult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.---
Fall!---No, by Tellus and her briny robes!
Over the fiery frontier of my realms
I will advance a terrible right arm
Shall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove,
And bid old Saturn take his throne again

"---
He spake, and ceas'd, the while a heavier threat
Held struggle with his throat but came not forth;
For as in theatres of crowded men
Hubbub increases more they call out "Hush!"
So at Hyperion's words the phantoms pale
Bestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and cold;
And from the mirror'd level where he stood
A mist arose, as from a scummy marsh.
At this, through all his bulk an agony
Crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown,
Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular
Making slow way, with head and neck convuls'd
From over-strained might.  Releas'd, he fled
To the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours
Before the dawn in season due should blush,
He breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals,
Clear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them wide
Suddenly on the ocean's chilly streams.
The planet orb of fire, whereon he rode
Each day from east to west the heavens through,
Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds;
Not therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid,
But ever and anon the glancing spheres,
Circles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure,
Glow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling dark
Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep
Up to the zenith,---hieroglyphics old,
Which sages and keen-eyed astrologers
Then living on the earth, with laboring thought
Won from the gaze of many centuries:
Now lost, save what we find on remnants huge
Of stone, or rnarble swart; their import gone,
Their wisdom long since fled.---Two wings this orb
Possess'd for glory, two fair argent wings,
And now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense
Rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were;
While still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse,
Awaiting for Hyperion's command.
Fain would he have commanded, fain took throne
And bid the day begin, if but for change.
The sacred seasons might not be disturb'd.
Therefore the operations of the dawn
Stay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis told.
Those silver wings expanded sisterly,
Eager to sail their orb; the porches wide
Open'd upon the dusk demesnes of night
And the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes,
Unus'd to bend, by hard compulsion bent
His spirit to the sorrow of the time;
And all along a dismal rack of clouds,
Upon the boundaries of day and night,
He stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint.
There as he lay, the Heaven with its stars
Look'd down on him with pity, and the voice
Of Coelus, from the universal space,
Thus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear:
"O brightest of my children dear, earth-born
And sky-engendered, son of mysteries
All unrevealed even to the powers
Which met at thy creating; at whose joys
And palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft,
I, Coelus, wonder, how they came and whence;
And at the fruits thereof what shapes they be,
Distinct, and visible; symbols divine,
Manifestations of that beauteous life
Diffus'd unseen throughout eternal space:
Of these new-form'd art thou, O brightest child!
There is sad feud among ye, and rebellion
Of son against his sire.  I saw him fall,
I saw my first-born tumbled from his throne!
To me his arms were spread, to me his voice
Found way from forth the thunders round his head!
Pale wox I, and in vapours hid my face.
Art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is:
Divine ye were created, and divine
In sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd,
Now I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath;
Actions of rage and passion; even as
I see them, on the mortal world beneath,
In men who die.---This is the grief, O son!
Sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall!
Yet do thou strive; as thou art capable,
And canst oppose to each malignant hour
Ethereal presence:---I am but a voice;
My life is but the life of winds and tides,
No more than winds and tides can I avail:---
But thou canst.---Be thou therefore in the van
Of circumstance; yea, seize the arrow's barb
Before the tense string murmur.---To the earth!
For there thou wilt find Saturn, and his woes.
Meantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun,
And of thy seasons be a careful nurse

"---
Ere half this region-whisper had come down,
Hyperion arose, and on the stars
Lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide
Until it ceas'd; and still he kept them wide:
And still they were the same bright, patient stars.
Then with a slow incline of his broad breast,
Like to a diver in the pearly seas,
Forward he stoop'd over the airy shore,
And plung'd all noiseless into the deep night.


BOOK II
JUST at the self-same beat of Time's wide wings
Hyperion slid into the rustled air,
And Saturn gain'd with Thea that sad place
Where Cybele and the bruised Titans mourn'd.
It was a den where no insulting light
Could glimmer on their tears; where their own groans
They felt, but heard not, for the solid roar
Of thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse,
Pouring a constant bulk, uncertain where.
Crag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem'd
Ever as if just rising from a sleep,
Forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns;
And thus in thousand hugest phantasies
Made a fit roofing to this nest of woe.
Instead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon,
Couches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge
Stubborn'd with iron.  All were not assembled:
Some chain'd in torture, and some wandering.
Caus, and Gyges, and Briareus,
Typhon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion,
With many more, the brawniest in assault,
Were pent in regions of laborious breath;
Dungeon'd in opaque element, to keep
Their clenched teeth still clench'd, and all their limbs
Lock'd up like veins of metal, crampt and screw'd;
Without a motion, save of their big hearts
Heaving in pain, and horribly convuls'd
With sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse.
Mnemosyne was straying in the world;
Far from her moon had Phoebe wandered;
And many else were free to roam abroad,
But for the main, here found they covert drear.
Scarce images of life, one here, one there,
Lay vast and edgeways; like a dismal cirque
Of Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor,
When the chill rain begins at shut of eve,
In dull November, and their chancel vault,
The Heaven itself, is blinded throughout night.
Each one kept shroud, nor to his neighbour gave
Or word, or look, or action of despair.
Creus was one; his ponderous iron mace
Lay by him, and a shatter'd rib of rock
Told of his rage, ere he thus sank and pined.
Iapetus another; in his grasp,
A serpent's plashy neck; its barbed tongue
Squeez'd from the gorge, and all its uncurl'd length
Dead: and because the creature could not spit
Its poison in the eyes of conquering Jove.
Next Cottus: prone he lay, chin uppermost,
As though in pain; for still upon the flint
He ground severe his skull, with open mouth
And eyes at horrid working.  Nearest him
Asia, born of most enormous Caf,
Who cost her mother Tellus keener pangs,
Though feminine, than any of her sons:
More thought than woe was in her dusky face,
For she was prophesying of her glory;
And in her wide imagination stood
Palm-shaded temples, and high rival fanes
By Oxus or in Ganges' sacred isles.
Even as Hope upon her anchor leans,
So leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk
Shed from the broadest of her elephants.
Above her, on a crag's uneasy shelve,
Upon his elbow rais'd, all prostrate else,
Shadow'd Enceladus; once tame and mild
As grazing ox unworried in the meads;
Now tiger-passion'd, lion-thoughted, wroth,
He meditated, plotted, and even now
Was hurling mountains in that second war,
To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird.
Not far hence Atlas; and beside him prone
Phorcus, the sire of Gorgons.  Neighbour'd close
Oceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap
Sobb'd Clymene among her tangled hair.
In midst of all lay Themis, at the feet
No shape distinguishable, more than when
Thick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds:
And many else whose names may not be told.
For when the Muse's wings are air-ward spread,
Who shall delay her flight? And she must chaunt
Of Saturn, and his guide, who now had climb'd
With damp and slippery footing from a depth
More horrid still. Above a sombre cliff
Their heads appear'd, and up their stature grew
Till on the level height their steps found ease:
Then Thea spread abroad her trembling arms
Upon the precincts of this nest of pain,
And sidelong fix'd her eye on Saturn's face:
At war with all the frailty of grief,
Of rage, of fear, anxiety, revenge,
Remorse, spleen, hope, but most of all despair.
Against these plagues he strove in vain; for Fate
Had pour'd a mortal oil upon his head,
A disanointing poison: so that Thea,
Affrighted, kept her still, and let him pass
First onwards in, among the fallen tribe.

     As with us mortal men, the laden heart
Is persecuted more, and fever'd more,
When it is nighing to the mournful house
Where other hearts are sick of the same bruise;
So Saturn, as he walk'd into the midst,
Felt faint, and would have sunk among the rest,
But that he met Enceladus's eye,
Whose mightiness, and awe of him, at once
Came like an inspiration; and he shouted,
Some started on their feet; some also shouted;
Some wept, some wail'd, all bow'd with reverence;
And Ops, uplifting her black folded veil,
Show'd her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan,
Her eye-brows thin and jet, and hollow eyes.
There is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines
When Winter lifts his voice; there is a noise
With hushing finger, how he means to load
His tongue with the filll weight of utterless thought,
With thunder, and with music, and with pomp:
Such noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines;
Which, when it ceases in this mountain'd world,
No other sound succeeds; but ceasing here,
Among these fallen, Saturn's voice therefrom
Grew up like organ, that begins anew
Its strain, when other harmonies, stopt short,
Leave the dinn'd air vibrating silverly.
Thus grew it up---"Not in my own sad breast,
Which is its own great judge and searcher out,
Can I find reason why ye should be thus:
Not in the legends of the first of days,
Studied from that old spirit-leaved book
Which starry Uranus with finger bright
Sav'd from the shores of darkness, when the waves
Low-ebb'd still hid it up in shallow gloom;---
And the which book ye know I ever kept
For my firm-based footstool:---Ah, infirm!
Not there, nor in sign, symbol, or portent
Of element, earth, water, air, and fire,---
At war, at peace, or inter-quarreling
One against one, or two, or three, or all
Each several one against the other three,
As fire with air loud warring when rain-floods
Drown both, and press them both against earth's face,
Where, finding sulphur, a quadruple wrath
Unhinges the poor world;---not in that strife,
Wherefrom I take strange lore, and read it deep,
Can I find reason why ye should be thus:
No, nowhere can unriddle, though I search,
And pore on Nature's universal scroll
Even to swooning, why ye, Divinities,
Should cower beneath what, in comparison,
Is untremendous might. Yet ye are here,
O'erwhelm'd, and spurn'd, and batter'd, ye are here!
O Titans, shall I say 'Arise!'---Ye groan:
Shall I say 'Crouch!'---Ye groan. What can I then?
O Heaven wide! O unseen parent dear!
How we can war, how engine our great wrath!
O speak your counsel now, for Saturn's ear
Is all a-hunger'd. Thou, Oceanus,
Ponderest high and deep; and in thy face
I see, astonied, that severe content
Which comes of thought and musing: give us help!"

Sophist and sage, from no Athenian grove,
But cogitation in his watery shades,
Arose, with locks not oozy, and began,
In murmurs, which his first-endeavouring tongue
Caught infant-like from the far-foamed sands.
"O ye, whom wrath consumes!  who, passion-stung,
Writhe at defeat, and nurse your agonies!
Shut up your senses, stifle up your ears,
My voice is not a bellows unto ire.
Yet listen, ye who will, whilst I bring proof
How ye, perforce, must be content to stoop:
And in the proof much comfort will I give,
If ye will take that comfort in its truth.
We fall by course of Nature's law, not force
Of thunder, or of Jove. Great Saturn, thou
Hast sifted well the atom-universe;
But for this reason, that thou art the King,
And only blind from sheer supremacy,
One avenue was shaded from thine eyes,
Through which I wandered to eternal truth.
And first, as thou wast not the first of powers,
So art thou not the last; it cannot be:
Thou art not the beginning nor the end.
From Chaos and parental Darkness came
Light, the first fruits of that intestine broil,
That sullen ferment, which for wondrous ends
Was ripening in itself.  The ripe hour came,
And with it Light, and Light, engendering
Upon its own producer, forthwith touch'd
The whole enormous matter into life.
Upon that very hour, our parentage,
The Heavens and the Earth, were manifest:
Then thou first born, and we the giant race,
Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms.
Now comes the pain of truth, to whom 'tis pain;
O folly! for to bear all naked truths,
And to envisage circumstance, all calm,
That is the top of sovereignty.  Mark well!
As Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far
Than Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs;
And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth
In form and shape compact and beautiful,
In will, in action free, companionship,
And thousand other signs of purer life;
So on our heels a fresh perfection treads,
A power more strong in beauty, born of us
And fated to excel us, as we pass
In glory that old Darkness: nor are we
Thereby more conquer'd, than by us the rule
Of shapeless Chaos. Say, doth the dull soil
Quarrel with the proud forests it hath fed,
And feedeth still, more comely than itself?
Can it deny the chiefdom of green groves?
Or shall the tree be envious of the dove
Because it cooeth, and hath snowy wings
To wander wherewithal and find its joys?
We are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs
Have bred forth, not pale solitary doves,
But eagles golden-feather'd, who do tower
Above us in their beauty, and must reign
In right thereof; for 'tis the eternal law
That first in beauty should be first in might:
Yea, by that law, another race may drive
Our conquerors to mourn as we do now.
My dispossessor? Have ye seen his face?
Have ye beheld his chariot, foam'd along
By noble winged creatures he hath made?
I saw him on the calmed waters scud,
With such a glow of beauty in his eyes,
That it enforc'd me to bid sad farewell
To all my empire: farewell sad I took,
And hither came, to see how dolorous fate
Had wrought upon ye; and how I might best
Give consolation in this woe extreme.
Receive the truth, and let it be your balm


     Whether through pos'd conviction, or disdain,
They guarded silence, when Oceanus
Left murmuring, what deepest thought can tell?
But so it was, none answer'd for a space,
Save one whom none regarded, Clymene;
And yet she answer'd not, only complain'd,
With hectic lips, and eyes up-looking mild,
Thus wording timidly among the fierce:
"O Father! I am here the simplest voice,
And all my knowledge is that joy is gone,
And this thing woe crept in among our hearts,
There to remain for ever, as I fear:
I would not bode of evil, if I thought
So weak a creature could turn off the help
Yet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell
Of what I heard, and how it made me weep,
And know that we had parted from all hope.
I stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,
Where a sweet clime was breathed from a land
Of fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers.
Full of calm joy it was, as I of grief;
Too full of joy and soft delicious warmth;
So that I felt a movement in my heart
To chide, and to reproach that solitude
With songs of misery, music of our woes;
And sat me down, and took a mouthed shell
And murmur'd into it, and made melody---
O melody no more! for while I sang,
And with poor skill let pass into the breeze
The dull shell's echo, from a bowery strand
Just opposite, an island of the sea,
There came enchantment with the shifting wind,
That did both drown and keep alive my ears.
I threw my shell away upon the sand,
And a wave fill'd it, as my sense was fill'd
With that new blissful golden melody.
A living death was in each gush of sounds,
Each family of rapturous hurried notes,
That fell, one after one, yet all at once,
Like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string:
And then another, then another strain,
Each like a dove leaving its olive perch,
With music wing'd instead of silent plumes,
To hover round my head, and make me sick
Of joy and grief at once.  Grief overcame,
And I was stopping up my frantic ears,
When, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,
A voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune,
And still it cried, 'Apollo! young Apollo!
The morning-bright Apollo! young Apollo!'
I fled, it follow'd me, and cried 'Apollo!'
O Father, and O Brethren, had ye felt
Those pains of mine; O Saturn, hadst thou felt,
Ye would not call this too indulged tongue
Presumptuous, in thus venturing to be heard


     So far her voice flow'd on, like timorous brook
That, lingering along a pebbled coast,
Doth fear to meet the sea: but sea it met,
And shudder'd; for the overwhelming voice
Of huge Enceladus swallow'd it in wrath:
The ponderous syllables, like sullen waves
In the half-glutted hollows of reef-rocks,
Came booming thus, while still upon his arm
He lean'd; not rising, from supreme contempt.
"Or shall we listen to the over-wise,
Not thunderbolt on thunderbolt, till all
That rebel Jove's whole armoury were spent,
Not world on world upon these shoulders piled,
Could agonize me more than baby-words
In midst of this dethronement horrible.
Speak! roar! shout! yell! ye sleepy Titans all.
Do ye forget the blows, the buffets vile?
Are ye not smitten by a youngling arm?
Dost thou forget, sham Monarch of the waves,
Thy scalding in the seas?  What! have I rous'd
Your spleens with so few simple words as these?
O joy! for now I see ye are not lost:
O joy! for now I see a thousand eyes
Wide-glaring for revenge!"---As this he said,
He lifted up his stature vast, and stood,
Still without intermission speaking thus:
"Now ye are flames, I'll tell you how to burn,
And purge the ether of our enemies;
How to feed fierce the crooked stings of fire,
And singe away the swollen clouds of Jove,
Stifling that puny essence in its tent.
O let him feel the evil he hath done;
For though I scorn Oceanus's lore,
Much pain have I for more than loss of realms:
The days of peace and slumbrous calm are fled;
Those days, all innocent of scathing war,
When all the fair Existences of heaven
Carne open-eyed to guess what we would speak:---
That was before our brows were taught to frown,
Before our lips knew else but solemn sounds;
That was before we knew the winged thing,
Victory, might be lost, or might be won.
And be ye mindful that Hyperion,
Our brightest brother, still is undisgraced---
Hyperion, lo! his radiance is here!"

     All eyes were on Enceladus's face,
And they beheld, while still Hyperion's name
Flew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks,
A pallid gleam across his features stern:
Wroth as himself.  He look'd upon them all,
And in each face he saw a gleam of light,
But splendider in Saturn's, whose hoar locks
Shone like the bubbling foam about a keel
When the prow sweeps into a midnight cove.
In pale and silver silence they remain'd,
Till suddenly a splendor, like the morn,
Pervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps,
All the sad spaces of oblivion,
And every gulf, and every chasm old,
And every height, and every sullen depth,
Voiceless, or hoarse with loud tormented streams:
And all the everlasting cataracts,
And all the headlong torrents far and near,
Mantled before in darkness and huge shade,
Now saw the light and made it terrible.
It was Hyperion:---a granite peak
His bright feet touch'd, and there he stay'd to view
The misery his brilliance had betray'd
To the most hateful seeing of itself.
Golden his hair of short Numidian curl,
Regal his shape majestic, a vast shade
In midst of his own brightness, like the bulk
Of Memnon's image at the set of sun
To one who travels from the dusking East:
Sighs, too, as mournful as that Memnon's harp
He utter'd, while his hands contemplative
He press'd together, and in silence stood.
At sight of the dejected King of day,
And many hid their faces from the light:
But fierce Enceladus sent forth his eyes
Among the brotherhood; and, at their glare,
Uprose Iapetus, and Creus too,
And Phorcus, sea-born, and together strode
To where he towered on his eminence.
There those four shouted forth old Saturn's name;
Hyperion from the peak loud answered, "Saturn!"
Gave from their hollow throats the name of "Saturn!"


BOOK III
THUS in altemate uproar and sad peace,
Amazed were those Titans utterly.
O leave them, Muse!  O leave them to their woes;
For thou art weak to sing such tumults dire:
A solitary sorrow best befits
Thy lips, and antheming a lonely grief.
Leave them, O Muse! for thou anon wilt find
Many a fallen old Divinity
Wandering in vain about bewildered shores.
Meantime touch piously the Delphic harp,
And not a wind of heaven but will breathe
In aid soft warble from the Dorian flute;
For lo! 'tis for the Father of all verse.
Flush everything that hath a vermeil hue,
Let the rose glow intense and warm the air,
And let the clouds of even and of morn
Float in voluptuous fleeces o'er the hills;
Let the red wine within the goblet boil,
Cold as a bubbling well; let faint-lipp'd shells,
On sands, or in great deeps, vermilion turn
Through all their labyrinths; and let the maid
Blush keenly, as with some warm kiss surpris'd.
Chief isle of the embowered Cyclades,
Rejoice, O Delos, with thine olives green,
And poplars, and lawn-shading palms, and beech,
In which the Zephyr breathes the loudest song,
And hazels thick, dark-stemm'd beneath the shade:
Apollo is once more the golden theme!
Where was he, when the Giant of the sun
Stood bright, amid the sorrow of his peers?
Together had he left his mother fair
And his twin-sister sleeping in their bower,
And in the morning twilight wandered forth
Beside the osiers of a rivulet,
Full ankle-deep in lilies of the vale.
The nightingale had ceas'd, and a few stars
Were lingering in the heavens, while the thrush
Began calm-throated.  Throughout all the isle
There was no covert, no retired cave,
Unhaunted by the murmurous noise of waves,
Though scarcely heard in many a green recess.
He listen'd, and he wept, and his bright tears
Went trickling down the golden bow he held.
Thus with half-shut suffused eyes he stood,
While from beneath some cumbrous boughs hard by
And there was purport in her looks for him,
Which he with eager guess began to read
Perplex'd, the while melodiously he said:
"How cam'st thou over the unfooted sea?
Or hath that antique mien and robed form
Mov'd in these vales invisible till now?
Sure I have heard those vestments sweeping o'er
The fallen leaves, when I have sat alone
In cool mid-forest.  Surely I have traced
The rustle of those ample skirts about
These grassy solitudes, and seen the flowers
Lift up their heads, as still the whisper pass'd.
And their eternal calm, and all that face,
Or I have dream'd

"---"Yes," said the supreme shape,
"Thou hast dream'd of me; and awaking up
Didst find a lyre all golden by thy side,
Whose strings touch'd by thy fingers, all the vast
Unwearied ear of the whole universe
Listen'd in pain and pleasure at the birth
Of such new tuneful wonder. Is't not strange
That thou shouldst weep, so gifted? Tell me, youth,
What sorrow thou canst feel; for I am sad
When thou dost shed a tear: explain thy griefs
To one who in this lonely isle hath been
The watcher of thy sleep and hours of life,
From the young day when first thy infant hand
Pluck'd witless the weak flowers, till thine arm
Could bend that bow heroic to all times.
Show thy heart's secret to an ancient Power
Who hath forsaken old and sacred thrones
For prophecies of thee, and for the sake
Of loveliness new born

"---Apollo then,
With sudden scrutiny and gloomless eyes,
Thus answer'd, while his white melodious throat
Throbb'd with the syllables.---"Mnemosyne!
Thy name is on my tongue, I know not how;
Why should I tell thee what thou so well seest?
Why should I strive to show what from thy lips
Would come no mystery? For me, dark, dark,
And painful vile oblivion seals my eyes:
I strive to search wherefore I am so sad,
Until a melancholy numbs my limbs;
And then upon the grass I sit, and moan,
Like one who once had wings.---O why should I
Feel curs'd and thwarted, when the liegeless air
Yields to my step aspirant? why should I
Spurn the green turf as hateful to my feet?
Are there not other regions than this isle?
What are the stars? There is the sun, the sun!
And the most patient brilliance of the moon!
And stars by thousands!  Point me out the way
To any one particular beauteous star,
And I will flit into it with my lyre,
And make its silvery splendor pant with bliss.
I have heard the cloudy thunder: Where is power?
Whose hand, whose essence, what divinity
Makes this alarum in the elements,
While I here idle listen on the shores
In fearless yet in aching ignorance?
That waileth every morn and eventide,
Tell me why thus I rave about these groves!
Mute thou remainest---Mute! yet I can read
A wondrous lesson in thy silent face:
Names, deeds, gray legends, dire events, rebellions,
Majesties, sovran voices, agonies,
Creations and destroyings, all at once
Pour into the wide hollows of my brain,
And deify me, as if some blithe wine
Or bright elixir peerless I had drunk,
And so become immortal

While his enkindled eyes, with level glance
Beneath his white soft temples, steadfast kept
Trembling with light upon Mnemosyne.
Soon wild commotions shook him, and made flush
All the immortal fairness of his limbs;
Most like the struggle at the gate of death;
Or liker still to one who should take leave
Of pale immortal death, and with a pang
As hot as death's is chill, with fierce convulse
Die into life: so young Apollo anguish'd:
His very hair, his golden tresses famed,
Kept undulation round his eager neck.
During the pain Mnemosyne upheld
Her arms as one who prophesied. At length
Apollo shriek'd;---and lo! from all his limbs
Celestial


Deep in the shady sadness of a vale
Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,
Far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star,
Sat gray-hair'd Saturn, quiet as a stone,
Still as the silence round about his lair;
Forest on forest hung above his head
Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,
Not so much life as on a summer's day
Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass,
But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.
A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more
By reason of his fallen divinity
Spreading a shade: the Naiad 'mid her reeds
Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips.

Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went,
No further than to where his feet had stray'd,
And slept there since. Upon the sodden ground
His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,
Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed;
While his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the Earth,
His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.

It seem'd no force could wake him from his place;
But there came one, who with a kindred hand
Touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low
With reverence, though to one who knew it not.
By her in stature the tall Amazon
Had stood a pigmy's height: she would have ta'en
Achilles by the hair and bent his neck;
Or with a finger stay'd Ixion's wheel.
Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx,
Pedestal'd haply in a palace court,
When sages look'd to Egypt for their lore.
But oh! how unlike marble was that face:
How beautiful, if sorrow had not made
Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty's self.
There was a listening fear in her regard,
As if calamity had but begun;
As if the vanward clouds of evil days
Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear
Was with its stored thunder labouring up.
One hand she press'd upon that aching spot
Where beats the human heart, as if just there,
Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain:
The other upon Saturn's bended neck
She laid, and to the level of his ear
Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake
In solemn tenor and deep organ tone:
Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue
Would come in these like accents; O how frail
'Saturn, look up!--though wherefore, poor old King?
I have no comfort for thee, no not one:
I cannot say, 'O wherefore sleepest thou?'
For heaven is parted from thee, and the earth
And ocean too, with all its solemn noise,
Has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air
Is emptied of thine hoary majesty.
Thy thunder, conscious of the new command,
Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house;
And thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands
Scorches and burns our once serene domain.
O aching time! O moments big as years!
All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,
And press it so upon our weary griefs
That unbelief has not a space to breathe.
Saturn, sleep on:--O thoughtless, why did I
Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?
Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes?
Saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep.'

As when, upon a tranced summer-night,
Those green-rob'd senators of mighty woods,
Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,
Dream, and so dream all night without a stir,
Save from one gradual solitary gust
Which comes upon the silence, and dies off,
As if the ebbing air had but one wave;
So came these words and went; the while in tears
She touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground,
Just where her fallen hair might be outspread
A soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet.
One moon, with alteration slow, had shed
Her silver seasons four upon the night,
And still these two were postured motionless,
Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern;
Until at length old Saturn lifted up
His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone,
And all the gloom and sorrow ofthe place,
As with a palsied tongue, and while his beard
Shook horrid with such aspen-malady:
'O tender spouse of gold Hyperion,
Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face;
Look up, and let me see our doom in it;
Look up, and tell me if this feeble shape
Is Saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice
Of Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow,
Naked and bare of its great diadem,
Peers like the front of Saturn? Who had power
To make me desolate? Whence came the strength?
How was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth,
While Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp?
But it is so; and I am smother'd up,
And buried from all godlike exercise
Of influence benign on planets pale,
Of admonitions to the winds and seas,
Of peaceful sway above man's harvesting,
And all those acts which Deity supreme
Doth ease its heart of love in.--I am gone
Away from my own bosom: I have left
My strong identity, my real self,
Somewhere between the throne, and where I sit
Here on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search!
Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round
Upon all space: space starr'd, and lorn of light;
Space region'd with life-air; and barren void;
Spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.--
Search, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest
A certain shape or shadow, making way
With wings or chariot fierce to repossess
A heaven he lost erewhile: it must--it must
Be of ripe progress--Saturn must be King.
Yes, there must be a golden victory;
Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival
Upon the gold clouds metropolitan,
Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir
Of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be
Beautiful things made new, for the surprise
Of the sky-children; I will give command:
Thea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?'
This passion lifted him upon his feet,
And made his hands to struggle in the air,
His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat,
His eyes to fever out, his voice to cease.
He stood, and heard not Thea's sobbing deep;
A little time, and then again he snatch'd
Utterance thus.--'But cannot I create?
Cannot I form? Cannot I fashion forth
Another world, another universe,
To overbear and crumble this to nought?
Where is another Chaos? Where?'--That word
Found way unto Olympus, and made quake
The rebel three.--Thea was startled up,
And in her bearing was a sort of hope,
As thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe.

'This cheers our fallen house: come to our friends,
O Saturn! come away, and give them heart;
I know the covert, for thence came I hither.'
Thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went
With backward footing through the shade a space:
He follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the way
Through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist
Which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.

Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,
More sorrow like to this, and such like woe,
Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe:
The Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound,
Groan'd for the old allegiance once more,
And listen'd in sharp pain for Saturn's voice.
But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept
His sov'reigny, and rule, and majesy;--
Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire
Still sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up
For as among us mortals omens drear
Fright and perplex, so also shuddered he--
Not at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech,
Or the familiar visiting of one
Upon the first toll of his passing-bell,
Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp;
But horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve,
Oft made Hyperion ache. His palace bright,
Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold,
And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks,
Glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts,
Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries;
And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds
Flush'd angerly: while sometimes eagles' wings,
Darken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard
Also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths
Of incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills,
Instead of sweets, his ample palate took
Savor of poisonous brass and metal sick:
And so, when harbor'd in the sleepy west,
After the full completion of fair day,--
For rest divine upon exalted couch,
And slumber in the arms of melody,
He pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease
With stride colossal, on from hall to hall;
While far within each aisle and deep recess,
His winged minions in close clusters stood,
Amaz'd and full offear; like anxious men
Who on wide plains gather in panting troops,
When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.
Even now, while Saturn, rous'd from icy trance,
Went step for step with Thea through the woods,
Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,
Came slope upon the threshold of the west;
Then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope
In smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes,
Blown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet
And wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies;
And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,
In fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,
That inlet to severe magnificence

He enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath;
His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,
And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,
That scar'd away the meek ethereal Hours
And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared
From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,
Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,
And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,
Until he reach'd the great main cupola;
There standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot,
And from the basements deep to the high towers
Jarr'd his own golden region; and before
The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd,
His voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,
To this result: 'O dreams of day and night!
O monstrous forms! O effigies of pain!
O spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom!
O lank-eared phantoms of black-weeded pools!
Why do I know ye? why have I seen ye? why
Is my eternal essence thus distraught
To see and to behold these horrors new?
Saturn is fallen, am I too to fall?
Am I to leave this haven of my rest,
This cradle of my glory, this soft clime,
This calm luxuriance of blissful light,
These crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes,
Of all my lucent empire? It is left
Deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine.
The blaze, the splendor, and the symmetry,
I cannot see but darkness, death, and darkness.
Even here, into my centre of repose,
The shady visions come to domineer,
Insult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.--
Fall!--No, by Tellus and her briny robes!
Over the fiery frontier of my realms
I will advance a terrible right arm
Shall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove,
And bid old Saturn take his throne again.'--
He spake, and ceas'd, the while a heavier threat
Held struggle with his throat but came not forth;
For as in theatres of crowded men
Hubbub increases more they call out 'Hush!'
So at Hyperion's words the phantoms pale
Bestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and cold;
And from the mirror'd level where he stood
A mist arose, as from a scummy marsh.
At this, through all his bulk an agony
Crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown,
Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular
Making slow way, with head and neck convuls'd
From over-strained might. Releas'd, he fled
To the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours
Before the dawn in season due should blush,
He breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals,
Clear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them wide
Suddenly on the ocean's chilly streams.
The planet orb of fire, whereon he rode
Each day from east to west the heavens through,
Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds;
Not therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid,
But ever and anon the glancing spheres,
Circles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure,
Glow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling dark
Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep
Up to the zenith,--hieroglyphics old,
Which sages and keen-eyed astrologers
Then living on the earth, with laboring thought
Won from the gaze of many centuries:
Now lost, save what we find on remnants huge
Of stone, or rnarble swart; their import gone,
Their wisdom long since fled.--Two wings this orb
Possess'd for glory, two fair argent wings,
And now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense
Rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were;
While still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse,
Awaiting for Hyperion's command.
Fain would he have commanded, fain took throne
And bid the day begin, if but for change.
The sacred seasons might not be disturb'd.
Therefore the operations of the dawn
Stay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis told.
Those silver wings expanded sisterly,
Eager to sail their orb; the porches wide
Open'd upon the dusk demesnes of night
And the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes,
Unus'd to bend, by hard compulsion bent
His spirit to the sorrow of the time;
And all along a dismal rack of clouds,
Upon the boundaries of day and night,
He stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint.
There as he lay, the Heaven with its stars
Look'd down on him with pity, and the voice
Of Coelus, from the universal space,
Thus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear:
'O brightest of my children dear, earth-born
And sky-engendered, son of mysteries
All unrevealed even to the powers
Which met at thy creating; at whose joys
And palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft,
I, Coelus, wonder, how they came and whence;
And at the fruits thereof what shapes they be,
Distinct, and visible; symbols divine,
Manifestations of that beauteous life
Diffus'd unseen throughout eternal space:
Of these new-form'd art thou, O brightest child!
There is sad feud among ye, and rebellion
Of son against his sire. I saw him fall,
I saw my first-born tumbled from his throne!
To me his arms were spread, to me his voice
Found way from forth the thunders round his head!
Pale wox I, and in vapours hid my face.
Art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is:
Divine ye were created, and divine
In sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd,
Now I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath;
Actions of rage and passion; even as
I see them, on the mortal world beneath,
In men who die.--This is the grief, O son!
Sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall!
Yet do thou strive; as thou art capable,
And canst oppose to each malignant hour
Ethereal presence:--I am but a voice;
My life is but the life of winds and tides,
No more than winds and tides can I avail:--
But thou canst.--Be thou therefore in the van
Of circumstance; yea, seize the arrow's barb
Before the tense string murmur.--To the earth!
For there thou wilt find Saturn, and his woes.
Meantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun,
And of thy seasons be a careful nurse.'--
Ere half this region-whisper had come down,
Hyperion arose, and on the stars
Lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide
Until it ceas'd; and still he kept them wide:
And still they were the same bright, patient stars.
Then with a slow incline of his broad breast,
Like to a diver in the pearly seas,
Forward he stoop'd over the airy shore,
And plung'd all noiseless into the deep night. 

a woman dreams that she turns
into an orange bird
and on the other hand the orange
bird seeing her so beautiful and complete
less the orange wings and feathers
dreams of having woman-hands
soft and a flowing body like a slender
river curving through along
the side of a big mountain where
the orange bird perches on a branch
of an olive tree beside it

convoluted, the thoughts unwind
themselves in sleep wanting rest
from all these warping of time
and seasons and images and swapping
between reality and dream
surreal and mundane


Hypnosis-
That's what this is; 
I'm crazy-
All I can see
Is spots and lines-
I've lost all track of time
I just realized
I must be hypnotized.

Life rollin', rollin' past
My head is spinnin', spinnin' fast.
I don't get it, I don't understand
Why green is water and blue is land
Things keep flippin out of control
I'm seeing things through a purple fishbowl-

Zonin' as the days go by-
Dyin' never knowin' why; 
TV makes my life look weird, 
I'm a senior without a beard; 
Girls don't know me, they don't care, 
Because inside I'm not all there-

Seein' in my crystal ball
Tyin to make sense of it all
Never gettin' all of it
Blocked because my head don't fit
Zippin' out of reality
Don't know which of me is me.

Stop these voices in my head, 
Let me get some sleep in bed; 
I want to be normal, 
Like the rest of them all.
I'm sick of-
Hypnosis-
That's what this is; 
I'm crazy-
All I can see
Is spots and lines-
I've lost all track of time
I just realized
I must be hypnotized.

Not once but twice 
The same glass has been broken 

On the same act
You react 

Twice 
In two different ways 

Once you become very angry    
Like ember 
 
The other time you remain cool 
Like frozen ice 

You are under of a spell 
Of a sense 

That sense works 
In you  again 

When  a glass of milk 
taken not once but  twice 

and  not by the same  child
but by two different children 

again you react 

once you abuse 
the other time glad 

a sense works 
in you 

let the later  sense
posses  you 

and get it wings 
let it  fly all over  
 
or spread
 like insecticide 

over the first reaction 
and let it die like weeds 

other wise 
we fall short to be called human.. 

That seemingly
Respectable man
With a seemingly
Happy family-
Runs good websites
And preaches
Women's issues
But watches
Pornography in private
And seeks online sex.

No wonder, 
There are two sides
To a moon
As there are two sides
To a coin. 

You say that you love rain. 
But when it starts raining, you raise 
your umbrella over your head.

You say you love the Sun. 
But when it spreads its rays, you start
looking for shade. 

You say that you love storm. 
But when it starts blowing, closing doors and 
windows, you alone get seated.

You say that you love man. 
But when a poor man comes at your door in danger, 
in anger and in scorn your face turns red.

You say you love revolution. 
But when revolution knocks at your door, 
you fall asleep fast on your bed.

O my Love, in that way 
do you say to me 'I love you' each day

We are breathing in a society, 
Declining some more with the every new breath, 
Hypocrisy that ruled the world even when angles came on the earth, 
Is still rotating like electrons, 
In various orbits, 
Around the nucleus of all the ethics, 
The orbits whether legislature, judiciary or executive, 
Have the same electron of money.

Properties of matter depend on the electrons, 
That dance in the outermost orbit, 
And not on the nucleus, may be beautiful and nice, 
We are chasing the money, 
We are breathing for money, 
And there is no exception in it.

I can see various elements, 
Of periodic table! 
May be a scholar of ethics, 
A justice or a general, 
A dirty politician, 
No doubt in it, all is hypocrites! 


Being a common man, 
I am a little better, 
Not enjoying powers to blackmail, 
No arms no guns, not even law of necessity, 
No media on my back, 
I am not a justice or a general, 
I am not a politician or an executive, 
I am not a scholar, who delivers a sermon, 
I am a common poor man, 
Enjoying only few and limited joys, 
And insufficient money to meet the both ends, 
I am living with a peace of mind, 
No powerful man knows the insect, 
Off course, sometimes in explosions on the roads, 
I am often killed or injured, 
I don’t complain, that was written in my fate.
Who can fight with a deaf and dumb, cruel bind write! 

Dear powerful men, 
I just want to remind you all, 
Above all the laws, power and arms, 
There is a natural law, 
Nature is slow but when activated, 
It reshuffles the universe, 
Including this earth, 
That is what I found in all Holy Books. 

Rarely will one find a place of wealth
where hypocrisy, greed and deceit
are not in residence.



Spent a million to spruce up his home
Every Sunday at eight
He’d pass around the plate
After preaching prudence from his tome


Hate me, 
If you will.
Hypocrite-
Buried in the supposed hidden fortress
Of your dark secrets. 
You think you are righteous, 
Good, 
Perfect.
Am I so foul to you? 
You don't even know me, 
Yet you avoid me.
Do I make you uncomfortable? 
Good: 
I'm glad we have something in common-
You make me uncomfortable, too.
I do not trust you: 
I have learned never to trust
A hypocrite. 



( 
Our epoch takes a voluptuous satisfaction 
In that perspective of the action 
Which pictures us inhabiting the end 
Of everything with death for only friend. 


Not that we love death, 
Not truly, not the fluttering breath, 
The obscene shudder of the finished act— 
What the doe feels when the ultimate fact 
Tears at her bowels with its jaws. 


Our taste is for the opulent pause 
Before the end comes. If the end is certain 
All of us are players at the final curtain: 
All of us, silence for a time deferred, 
Find time before us for one sad last word. 
Victim, rebel, convert, stoic— 
Every role but the heroic— 
We turn our tragic faces to the stalls 
To wince our moment till the curtain falls.

A world ends when its metaphor has died. 

An age becomes an age, all else beside, 
When sensuous poets in their pride invent 
Emblems for the soul’s consent 
That speak the meanings men will never know 
But man-imagined images can show: 
It perishes when those images, though seen, 
No longer mean. 


( 
A world was ended when the womb 
Botticelli’s image neither speaks nor can 
To our kind. His star-guided stranger 
Teaches no longer, by the child, the manger, 
The meaning of the beckoning skies. 


Sophocles, when his reverent actors rise 
To play the king with bleeding eyes, 
No longer shows us on the stage advance 


No woman living, when the girl and swan 
Embrace in verses, feels upon 
Her breast the awful thunder of that breast 


Empty as conch shell by the waters cast 
The metaphor still sounds but cannot tell, 
And we, like parasite crabs, put on the shell 
And drag it at the sea’s edge up and down. 


This is the destiny we say we own. 

( 
But are we sure 
The age that dies upon its metaphor 
Among these Roman heads, these mediaeval towers, 
Is ours?— 
Or ours the ending of that story? 
The meanings in a man that quarry 
Images from blinded eyes 
And white birds and the turning skies 
To make a world of were not spent with these 
Abandoned presences. 


The journey of our history has not ceased: 
Earth turns us still toward the rising east, 
The metaphor still struggles in the stone, 
The allegory of the flesh and bone 
Still stares into the summer grass 
That is its glass, 
The ignorant blood 
Still knocks at silence to be understood. 


Poets, deserted by the world before, 
Turn round into the actual air: 
Invent the age! Invent the metaphor

Hypocrite women, how seldom we speak 
of our own doubts, while dubiously 
we mother man in his doubt! 


And if at Mill Valley perched in the trees 
the sweet rain drifting through western air 
a white sweating bull of a poet told us 


our cunts are ugly—why didn't we 
admit we have thought so too? (And 
what shame? They are not for the eye!) 


No, they are dark and wrinkled and hairy, 
caves of the Moon
And when a 
dark humming fills us, a 


coldness towards life, 
we are too much women to 
own to such unwomanliness. 


Whorishly with the psychopomp 
we play and plead—and say 
nothing of this later. And our dreams, 


with what frivolity we have pared them 
like toenails, clipped them like ends of 
split hair.

'Live life to the fullest', 
That's what they say, 
Yet here we are, 
Hidden away.

Locked in a building, 
Kept out of sight, 
So visitors cant see us, 
And call us horribly unright.

We're given work to do all day, 
And sent home late at night.
When home, we do reach, 
We're still kept out of sight.

They give us curfews, 
and lock us in
and just to be sure, 
they pile on homework with a grin.

And just to be safe, 
we have chores to do too, 
Locked safely away, 
like animals in a zoo.

If we question their motives on locking us away, 
They plast on a smile and so politely say
'Your an immature child 
And so horribly vile

You wear all black, 
From head to toe, 
And offend and cuss, 
No matter where you go.'

And upon this lie, 
We intelligently replie, 
'Well, when put to the test, 
We've learned from the best.'

And with our innocent smile, 
Which we've put on for the while, 
We turn and we grin, 
As we're told how we've sinned.

But when will they see, 
The intelligent me
Has figured it out
And turned the situation about.

For all things do end, 
I tell you my friend, 
As will their parade, 
And beautifully crafted charade.

For i've learned everything from them, 
And it'll bring about their end, 
For once and for all
The truth is installed

For the guns and the roses
We've been taught how to use 
To love or to hate
Either as we choose

And what they dont know
As they teach us to row
Is they skills can be used 
To free the abused

So as they teach us for them
They inevitably hurt themselves
For the rules have been bent 
And taken off the shelf

The lessons we learned
Have not been ruined or burned
But cleverly crafted
To save us from our hell.

(i was bored in geometry.  cant you tell? : D)Hypocritical: 
yet write hate in verse.


The hearts crawling on each other, 
Were satisfied and content, 
But time was jealous and could not see, 
The two innocents in love only love.
It started snatching the beauty of life, 
One by one everything was gone, 
Emotions were gone, 
Sentiments were gone, 
Passions were gone, 
Understanding was gone.

The cruel age, 
Coated a layer on everything, 
A layer that needs a name, 
Distances were increased, 
The beloved when turned, 
In a living hysteria, 
The act was reacted, 
And one day the lover, 
Broke two glasses, 
Were it merely the glasses, 
Or the hearts were broken.

Many days gone, 
Time started reverting, 
They didn’t talk each other, 
They are sleeping in different bed rooms, 
The nature intervened, 
And gave wings to the hearts, 
With a bitter smile, 
Asked the hearts to fly, 
And to go back, 
In her lovely arms, 
For an unending sleep, 
And the dreams unseen, 
Well in advance, 
Before the cruel time, 
Manages to snatch, 
The beauty of love! 





I thought once how Theocritus had sung
Of the sweet years, the dear and wished-for years,
Who each one in a gracious hand appears
To bear a gift for mortals, old or young:
And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,
I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,
The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,
Those of my own life, who by turns had flung
A shadow across me. Straightway I was 'ware,
So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move
Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair:
And a voice said in mastery, while I strove,--
'Guess now who holds thee ? '--' Death,' I said. But, there,
The silver answer rang,--' Not Death, but Love.

I am a soul
Your life force
I am the driver
Really just a pinpoint of life
My throne between my brows
Detach from the world around me.

I am a ruler
Ruler of all my sense organs
In the problems of days
Your changing ways
I remain as I am, as
I am just a peaceful soul.

I feel far away from you
Away from the physical world
I am beyond your world
Beyond from intellect and traits
I am peaceful here 
I am a meta soul. 

I am the cuteness of mangoose 
the delecacy of swans
the innocence of dews
the eagerness of crows.

I am the sparkle of gems
that collect on leaf blades
which hung delicately
like Mercury balls insecure.

I am the silver richness of Moon
the blazing warmth of Sun
the mystery of mists
the sublime sanctity of dawns.

I am the speed of King Fisher
its intelligence, its wisdom
the arrowy plunge 
the focus, complete and clear.

I am the love in dogs
their urge to be petted
and urge to lick and hugged
their gratitude, their consistent affections.

I am the whistling of greens
the howling of winds
the humming of birds
the breezing of trees.

I am the smell of soil
its first fragrance
when rain drops just penetrates
after long hot summers.

I am the deep voice of Cuckoo
its urge and despair
its 'never say die' pitches
clear and steep, climbing to sky and beyond.

I am the angelic fish moves
the lusty beauties
their lovely symphonic dashes
their amazing flexibility and quashes.

I am the blue of sky
flight of clouds
velocity of waves
as they beat across the chests of Ocean.

I am the twinkling stars
the radiance in their looks
the immortal beauties
the secrecy of their lights.

I am the scent of life
of buds unopened and nameless wonders
the butterfly's stunning modesties
the moth's murmuring touches.

I am the white of snow
the smile of a child
giggles of mischief
gurgling of brooks.

I am the sanctity of lamp light
Echo of church bells
jump of squirrels
chirp of sparrows.

I live in fire
in its consuming enormity
and kind love to feed
and disturbing friendliness to yield.

I live in water
its moist transparencies
living energy, soaking fancies
it gives me hugs of passion's dancing.

I love the sky
up above daying and nighting
an illusion though
fills me life

it makes me wonder
how unsure are my days
like moon my beloved die
like sun my passions blaze.

it has stars-secrets of night lives
gems of erotic illusions
fuelled by Moon in full-the consummated nights
the clueless clouds-full breasted now, flying then.

I live in Earth
the mother upon whose breast
I walk upon and wean to dryness
she is an angel, endurance in patience.

Earth and love
Immortal love in every grain
full of melting urge
to love her babies, selfless sacrificed.

Air rests my solitary soul
as I close my eyes and sink into the pools
the touch of air-embracing charm
sings in some meaning into my drowning calms. 

Where was I? 
I rose from null 
And one day 
Vanish into void
For a short period
I play 
On this stage.
I pluck my words
From the trees
There are millions and millions
I choose a few only
To write here
And put my sign
Because when they will come
They will find me
In these letters
Because in these letters
I am and will always be
In my presence and absence
For generations from here
Because these words
Were there and will be there
In their  absence and presence. 

Here in this city 
where dust drifts 
Settles on you pretty
much so swift
Dont let the dust
Settle in your heart
It will surely rust
Your emotions n impart
A deathly crust
Which will crumble
Your heart
 
Here in this city
Where everything is so loud
My cries are not  heard
Getting lost in the crowd
Wish I was a wandering cloud
That rained on the city
My drops, it endowed
A sparkling vision
Without the dust
Removing the crust
From your heart


I wonder if I know him
In whose speech is my voice,
In whose movement is my being,
Whose skill is in my lines,
Whose melody is in my songs
In joy and sorrow.
I thought he was chained within me,
Contained by tears and laughter,
Work and play.
I thought he was my very self
Coming to an end with my death.
Why then in a flood of joy do I feel him
In the sight and touch of my beloved?
This 'I' beyond self I found
On the shores of the shining sea.
Therefore I know
This 'I' is not imprisoned within my bounds.
Losing myself, I find him
Beyond the borders of time and space.
Through the Ages
I come to know his Shining Self
In the life of the seeker,
In the voice of the poet.
From the dark clouds pour the rains.
I sit and think:
Bearing so many forms, so many names,
I come down, crossing the threshold
Of countless births and deaths.
The Supreme undivided, complete in himself,
Embracing past and present,
Dwells in Man.
Within Him I shall find myself -
The 'I' that reaches everywhere. 

Stroking the round belly
He burps
Centuries of being fed
Centuries of having read
The Vedas
By Hindus to wash away their sins
Brahmins- 
Why, aren't they the 'superior' caste? 

Entry from the rear
Close the bathrooms, mom says
The 'Jamaadaar' is here 
Centuries of persecution
Centuries of mortification
The Untouchables
By Hindus to wash away their faeces
Bhanghis
Why, aren't they the most 'inferior' caste? 

Yes
It exists
In some form or the other
In Your mind
In My mind
Made us blind
When will it perish? 
When will it be abolished? 
Stop calling them for 'havan'
For all our auspicious events
The others dont deserve to be shunned
Clean our own johns
Clean our own minds
Of all the centuries of castes
Let it unwind. 

Is love a skin of the snake
Which sheds off every other day? 
Is love a fluttering butterfly
That darts on a different flower, never stays? 
Is love a hurricane that storms
Rages, pries and withers away? 
Is love a wisp of the mist
That was there and now is gone? 
Is love a kindling glowing fire
That ends up in ashes that can be blown away? 
Is love just a snowflake
That falls on you and melts away? 

Is love just a letter word

Inappropriate at best

Aggravating
Mistrustful

Mis take-maker
Erratic



I Accidently Died

Once upon a something (or other) .
I was talking to the brother
I knew I'd never forgive.
When, suddenly I forgot to live.

I accidently died by accident.
Gladly, one can forget to repent.
It was an accident, I swear! 
I shall not miss anything: neither love nor fresh air.

For only in death I can see the light! 
It was an accident that I did not fight.
Living days, so dark they are.
Death had healed my living scar.

Only in death, you can see
Life's not what it's meant to be.
Hell is better than we thought.
If only we were rightly taught! 

Sad for you that Hell is full.
Sad the Devil can't push or pull.
So sad that all the people have lied.
Happily, I accidently died. 


I  admire with pleasure
when cloud thundered with musical note
a flashing crew toucher my heart
the breeze whispered in my ear
the fragrance of distant flower 
came with blowing wind when
the atmosphere was tranquil and silent
my vow spreaded its wings
to fly over sky to sing and dance
the old banyan was also dancing
with pleasure but mute
to understand the language of my heart
I came across the sky flower
cheered with its fragrance. 

Why do overweight people, continually
say, 'does this make me look fat? '


And he calls me a kid
But I know I’m big.

I got a tank, an aircraft
And a gun to play with.
Big boys like John
Also got these things.

John’s in the army
And he calls me a kid
But I know I’m big.

I hurt no one and play in peace
With all my big boy things.
So who’s wiser and who’s a kid, 
Is it John or is it me? 

(December I always  get, a lot of heat 
While at rest
 or moving, 
 I think 
I will  be  very  rich
just by  selling all these 
 in the market
 bereft of good poetry. 

 I am  restless and
 the temperature is   rising, 
so  I sit down to count
 the  money
 in my would be  bank account 
but suddenly I find my fever has  gone.
What a relief!  
 but she has left for me 
 a full sack of  jittery 
 What a pity! 
I can not  any more change  my destiny 
It is all  about the forgetting to blame 
though  
I am not a rich man  
today  but I am  very lucky 
as I avoided 
 to become a mad man
successfully. 


I am: yet what I am none cares or knows,
My friends forsake me like a memory lost;
I am the self-consumer of my woes,
They rise and vanish in oblivious host,
Like shades in love and death's oblivion lost;
And yet I am! and live with shadows tost

Into the nothingness of scorn and noise,
Into the living sea of waking dreams,
Where there is neither sense of life nor joys,
But the vast shipwreck of my life's esteems;
And e'en the dearest--that I loved the best--
Are strange--nay, rather stranger than the rest.

I long for scenes where man has never trod;
A place where woman never smil'd or wept;
And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept:
Untroubling and untroubled where I lie;
The grass below--above the vaulted sky. 


I am the stream, I am the rivulet
I am the river flowing to the east or the west, south or north
I am the sea, I am the ocean
I am the delightful union of the river and the ocean; 

I am the hills, I am the valleys, I am the peaks of the mountains; 
I am the plants, I am the trees piercing the earth, 
I am the black clouds, I am the incessant down pour, 
I am the deafening thunder, I am the blinding lightening

I am the Sun, I am the Illumination, 
I am the moon, I am the pleasant moonlight, 
I am the earth holding all life and all the moving and stationary; 
I am the green fields, I am the red flames

I am the flowers full of honey, 
I am the sound made by the bees sucking honey; 

I am the stone, I am the rock, I am the ravishing beauty of youthful women, 
I am the insect, I am the reptile, I am the delightful flow of poetry, 
I am the bird, I am the Man, I am the consort of the Nature; 

I am the planets, I am the revolutions of planets, 
I am the universe, I am the cosmos, 
I am the form of all worlds, 
I am the holder of the universe in me; 

I am the knower, I am the known, 
I speak, I understand; 

I am the frolic play of boys and girls, 
I am the amorous feelings of the youth, 
I am the beautiful smiles of the infants and the aged; 

All the nature, planets, stars, universe, celestial worlds, cosmos
Are originating, growing and dissolving in me; 

I am the liberty, I am the independence
I am the peace, I am the glow of all life; 


Such I am


Can not be caged
By castes, religions, languages, regions, nationalities, 
Ideologies, cultures, cults, isms or fanatic slogans; 

Even though arrows are pierced through me, 
Swords cut me into pieces; bullets make my body and heart a sieve
Bombs scatter my body parts; tanks roll over me and make me a paste, 
Kings, Emperors, Rulers, fanatic religious heads, Caste leaders, 
Champions of ideology though stand in rows 
Can not bind me; 

All the efforts to annihilate me 
Will be consumed by the flames of
My fiery nature


With a love a madness for Shelley
Chatterton   Rimbaud
and the needy-yap of my youth
     has gone from ear to ear:
       I HATE OLD POETMEN!
Especially old poetmen who retract
who consult other old poetmen
who speak their youth in whispers,
saying:--I did those then
      but that was then
      that was then--
O I would quiet old men
say to them:--I am your friend
           what you once were, thru me
           you'll be again--
Then at night in the confidence of their homes
rip out their apology-tongues
         and steal their poems. 

From babies screaming, 
And Barney singing, 
Of love and of like, 
As we sat on the floor.

From fire on birthdays, 
And flooded out tents, 
To Jeremy and Justin, 
Who away they went.

Now Rosy plus baby, 
Ben and his wife, 
Tyler and Aubrey, 
Spoiled through life.

From  grandmas and grandpas, 
And Dr. Mario all day, 
From counting to  
And staying in to play.

From daycare to Holmes to Franklin and more, 
From Poston to Mountain View - Westwood galore, 
From penguin pajamas and hopping about, 
From Amy and dolly and the bears gone out.

From 'Brothers Are A Bother, ' 
In Voices  
From Who's Who Among Students, 
And NJHS no more.

And now as i look back and see where I've been, 
And the people i met and what I've learned from them, 
I see that fate in this world is not always fair, 
And just 'cause they say it, it doesn't mean they'll be there. 

I create and destroy
I am the wheel sunk in the mud
I am the path and the clouded dust 
I am you

I am the star, and that twinkle
inside the eye
I am the cotton that fleets through  the sky
I am that I am.

I am the lust, the desire and  the evil
I am the greed and the reason behind it
I am the thrill and the boredom
I am the fruition

I am the flow, word, music and the meter
I am simile and  the metaphor
I am the moment and the spur
The poem is reflection of me

I am the past that couldn't last
I am the present 
That I only sent 
I am the unknown future 
I am the yesterday, today and the tomorrow.

I am the station, the passenger and the journey
I am departure and the destination 
I am the milestone
I am the wait 

I am the beaten sound, and the drum 
I am the celebration of  birth and cause of death
I am the night and the cold dark

I am the wild child 
I am the moody youth
I am the sunrise and the sunset
I am the age of stars

I am the zero, and the infinite 
I am the dividend and the divider
I am the remainder 
I am.   

I am
nothing more than part of time
by being has a clock
so too this universe of stars..
we both evolved from-
rock-

I am. 
an unwrapped gift of endless love, -
I am mother, father, friend and foe-
I am husband, - I am wife

I am. 
brother, sister, uncle, aunt. 
I am mountain, I am sea. 
I am neighbor, I am stranger
I am prisoner, .. I am free

I am
nothing more than part of time
each second is a gift
a fleeting chance to share-
to love, - to find someone-
their burden I can lift


I am from Boar and Lion
From Sword and Shield
From Crest and Clan
From Woman and Man
I know who I am.


I am what I am, don’t tell me I’m wrong
I march to my own band, I sing my own song
I don’t judge you because of what you do
As long as to yourself you are true

Because I love women you think I’m a freak
Look at yourself, your prejudices make you weak
I don’t ask what it is that makes you you
I don’t care what it is you do

I tried to be "normal", I tried to conform
I’m not consciously trying to abandon the norm
But I’m not like you, I’m just trying to be me
At least with me, you get what you see

I could be your daughter, your sister, your friend
But all you can see is I am Lesbian
You don’t care that I’m human, I hurt inside
You continue being rude and snide

You try to thrust your beliefs upon me
When you look at yourself what do you see
You tell me I’m wrong, talk about evil and sin
When you look inside, are  you  perfect within

I stand tall, I walk proud
I am a Lesbian, I’ll say it out loud
I embrace what I am
I don’t give a damn

I am a bard - I am a heaven bird,
I need no any richness of the world.

I love a flower and so charming lass
In aromatic springs that never pass.

I love a whisper, very gentle and long,
And, in full silence, a despondent song. 

I failed to think what I should have thought
I failed to do what I should have done
I failed to be what I should have been
I fail to continue in failingi know nothing, i am a big zero
i have no shape, size, colour, taste, 
i am just a big zero.
all hues mingles into me with glee
and i am the whiteness of swans and sunny sky

i am a fool, silly stupid, idiot
all i know is to watch the clouds and sky
enjoy this morning, with cool air and cooling lovers
the birds, the leaves, the clouds and the breeze that blows
all seems to intoxicate me, i feel i am in an ethereal sexy glow

i feel empty minded, cant think at all neither count my pay even
but i can feel the Brahmini Kite when it picks up its back
with bulging feathery body full of lovely lovely chocalate brown
white foaming breast, the feathers all dove tailed to the ends
its piercing eyes, which could zoom me to unfathomed heights
i love the bulgy bosoms of birds, want to lick and hug and eat them
they are so cute that i want to do something, but i am a beastly
i could only eat i know not how to love without eating things
all things i love i eat up and end them up in toilets, 
oh what a empty headed bullshit am I, a stupid nothing.

love the way morning is, silent but seriously cool and 
warmth it exudes through its cool breeze, it makes me kiss 
hug, play, loudly sing and scream, i am happiness overflowing
i dont know if sex would suffice my inner urges and interior motives
i feel i need something more, the more the cool air touches me
the more i want to get wet both inner and innermost, shivering out

Oh what a beauty, the entire cosmos vibrates within me and i a big zero
cool air, it is like a celestial beauty, like Venus, willingly playing
with my voluptuous emotions and voluntary passions, I love this dawn
though i am nothing, i melt into it, my being is making love with nature, ha ha ha, oh what an enjoyment, when the object, subject and predicate becomes one with the Abstract Noun of existence, simple ecstasy, Orgasm, is it.  .

I am a bird flying free with my thoughts, 
Form my nesting tree I gallantly fought, 
Every sinister wing and feather flown, 
That tried to endanger my happy home.

Imagination is my sky, countless as stars, 
Smoothly I fly pass the Moon, Sun & Mars, 
Landing on Jupiter gently wetting my beak, 
Lest on the return trip I get too tired or weak.

I chirp for my freedom with a heavenly song, 
This way the journey will not seem as long, 
My wings are better known as love and peace, 
Embracing wisdom, reason never fails to cease. 

From the hunter my fears are light years away, 
Because of his shots in the air I choose to stay, 
Not alone in flight, yeah with others it all began, 
Free from deceit & bitterness of the wicked man.

Or should I rightly pronounce hatred by evil ones? 
The devil’s daughters hand in hand with his sons, 
Planet of my youth has grown callused and cold, 
Just had to escape for the joy of experiencing old.

Of course no one lives forever that would be long, 
Eventually even the birds would run out of song, 
Life is meant for happiness with a taste so sweet, 
Not combativeness destruction, win against defeat.

The Soulful Creator of the universe never did intend, 
For His flock to be devoured savagely in the lions den, 
Shaken by the piercing, thunderous, king of beast roar, 
Escaping from forced captivity through the air we soar.  

Up, up and away like a Siamese cloud of common feathers, 
United in one thought unaffected by all seasonal weather, 
Our tails bearing the sign of a glorious Tunisian insignia, 
An eloquent masterpiece by Miss Glamorous Enigma. 

All things were their impossibility
But only one can make it free.
I was bounded to an array of trials
Where my fingers stroll the keys; 
It seems as though all are possible
Overwhelmed as I am underway! 

It is as if I was shooting in the air
Where the birds fly like jets in the sky; 
Nothing to worry about underneath
But the beauty of the views to see.
I was then bounded by a unique array
Where my wings can fly high in a stroll; 
It seems as though all are impossible
Overwhelmed as I am underway! 

Hush and hush and hush and hush. 
My flying is not a climb nor a push; 
Flush and flush and flush and flush. 
Birds like me can endure the cruise

Stumble you get in treading the path of life
Or you may get your steps upon dirt
And inside develop a spot, a dot, 
A scratch even a crack
To remove them you may try
Collins, wheels, Nirma or acids
But they will not get out
In this case I may help you
I am a trader
I sell broom of forgiveness
Buy to use it and see how they are gone with a swipe. 

As I perused the list of poems by Madathil R. Nair, 
I suddenly noticed: "I Am A Butterfly! " ---there.
This got my brain cells [I still have a few] working.
Yes, my head started to rock.  It was wildly jerking! ! 

And this poem was 


forthcoming.  Yes!  I gave it birth.
I hope it will add (to YOUR day)  SOME measure of mirth!

"I was a butterfly
That knew not the Sun
Who showed me this and that
In whose dazzle I lost the sight
Of the One that shone in all

My eyes were closed
As I drowned
In the sweetness that nectar bore
Thought that was all
There to be known

Alas, I was a butterfly
Inebriate dumb and deaf
That moved and died in time
Like leaves on autumn eve

Till I landed on the beads
Clung to them in mortal grief
The lute and lotus then I saw 
With the One who sat on it
Whose Lotus Feet said it all

I am a butterfly
Who now sees the Sun
In whose light shines one and all
I am a butterfly
Who knows where
Sweet immortality rears

The lute is me
The flower is me
As the Mother who smiles
And shines around

I am a butterfly
That knows no fret
For fret I am, the Feet I am
The sweetness  too I am
I am a butterfly
Lost in Love
That sees only butterflies around
And that Oneness - the seat of all

I was a butterfly
That knew not the Sun
Who showed me this and that
In whose dazzle I lost the sight
Of the One that shone in all

My eyes were closed
As I drowned
In the sweetness that nectar bore
Thought that was all
There to be known

Alas, I was a butterfly
Inebriate dumb and deaf
That moved and died in time
Like leaves on autumn eve

Till I landed on the beads
Clung to them in mortal grief
The lute and lotus then I saw 
With the One who sat on it
Whose Lotus Feet said it all

I am a butterfly
Who now sees the Sun
In whose light shines one and all
I am a butterfly
Who knows where
Sweet immortality rears

The lute is me
The flower is me
As the Mother who smiles
And shines around

I am a butterfly
That knows no fret
For fret I am, the Feet I am
The sweetness  too I am
I am a butterfly
Lost in Love
That sees only butterflies around
And that Oneness - the seat of all

I am a citizen of the world
and my home is my abode: 
Rivers, lakes and valleys
are my sources of life; 
Trees, birds and mountains
are my pride! 
I am a citizen of the world
and my home is my abode: 
Seas, fishes and oceans
are my sources of hope; 
Shorelines, rocks and beaches
are my cliches! 
I am a citizen of the world
and my peace is your company: 
My children, relatives and friends
are my sources of strength; 
Their love, care and tender touch
are my tabernacles.
I am a citizen of mankind
and the whole world is my abode. 

It was or it is a bad dream
I was very innocent
Beautiful and exquisite
Before I drank the liquor of common life
I was so special
So gifted, blissful, pure and blessed
It was an endless ocean of paranormal souls
Around my continuously changing skins
Red Turkish carpet 
Pining to touch the sole of my intangible feet 
Little girls of unknown ethnicities
Holding bouquets of red roses and oriental lilies
Louis Armstrong playing his flashy trumpet 
For hours in my homage
O’ I was so special once


Today
I’m a commoner
Living a common life
Lying, stealing and two-timing
Knowingly turning obscured reality into a glittery mirage
Willfully embracing the slaps of cruel Time
Alluringly writing meaningless poems
On the gorgeous-white skins of colored whores
Brutally beaten yet walking swift
Through the carpeted roads of modern cities
And proudly pronouncing that
I am a common man of this uncommon world


So pure was that span
When I was nothing
So filthy is this time
When I am something
Yesterday
I was nothing but special
Today
I am something but a commoner



Sep uffering of the people
Gives  me  a pain poisonous
In the heart rubs
The sorrow, the delirium delirious
Just to lessen the sadness
I laughed, the laugh was loud
Before I was very sane
Now I am a complete mad man.
Ha, ha, he, he, ho, ho.
 

People cut a joke make a  fun
I don't care  
As they are found
Coarse and blunt 
The dullards
Dolling out dull
So I walk
Like a king insane
The owner of
The sun and the moon.
Ha, ha  he, he ho, ho.
 
 
I could save myself
If I was a vagabond 
Totally stoic indifferent
But I had a heart very sensitive
And could not bear the grief
Just to lesson   it,  I laughed, 
The laugh was very loud
Before I was sane
Now I am a complete mad man.
Ha, ha he, he hi, hi ho, ho. 

I am a dish
Best served re-heated
And enjoyed 
tongue-in cheek.

Fresh from the oven
I was too hot, flavours
Not yet diffused, 
Meat a little underdone
And sauce unperfected.

I would have burned your lips.

Still, I provided 
Nourishment for some
Who supped 
And were satisfied, 
Seeking from me
The choicest morsels.

But not finding them all.

So if you find me
Cold, resting in the fridge of life, 
You may not be too impressed
If you lift my lid and peer inside.

But if you warm me
Taste me, 
Slowly stir me, 
Add back a little 
Of what was taken, 
I will enfold you
In the aromas of desire, 
And leave you breathless
With the taste of life. 

I know how to flow 
More than a tide of a stream 
Less than a gust of wind 
I know who I am 
 I am cool 
Less than ice more than rain 
I know how to contain myself 
And fall upon everything 
To glitter more than gold 
And to reflect less than diamond  
But when I wish I fly to the height 
No birds can reach 
I know who I am 
I am cool 
Live a subtle life 
Sitting upon the leaves



I am a Filipino, in blood and spirit
born from immortal seeds of heroes
Whose heart were willing to commit
their lives to fight any kind of  foes
even those that has the power to spit
the nation of my  birth with volcanoes
of fire and balls of cannon that can split
thy land unto tiny dusts to unseen echoes. 

I am a Filipino, proud of my humble roots
of a gentle loving and valiant Malayan spirit
land been conquered but never surrendered
the culture of its birth  and ancestor's merit
of great love for country that can't  be toppled
even by nation with powers that can delete
this land out of the face of this great world
as all thy children  vow to die with all valor 
to defend the pride and honor of the Filipinos. 

Some of my friends who later turned enemies
Once told me, get out or come out of this place
And let not the theme of your poems only be concerning us
Global issues are dealt by the global poets
Here lowly people live; they eat low, talk low
Totally mean people, they don't talk what they mean
What they mean they don't speak out, such meanly low, 
For the time being i thought they are not wrong
But later like a dream I wake up
And understand I should pull things upside down and downside up
Show the things inside out where i am born
Let people know from top to bottom
Here is nothing but all over is only dirty mud
Yet I bloom yet I flourish
And all these are possible because i am a flower, lotus. 

I am the same Tweetie bird
Which flew off from the cage
Which came once again
Into this unknown world
Full of words and love.
Once I was caught
And caged for many years
Was made to sing and dance
To the tune of others.
I am the same Tweetie bird
Which will never allow to be
Get caught in the cage once again.
No hands can catch me
As no one knows me 
That I was the caged bird.
I have come here and tweet once again.
If again you catch me
Again I will free myself 
And again come to tweet
Just to make my presence felt.
I am happy that I am a free bird
Which can fly here and there
And everywhere
As long as I want.
But will be cautious of unknown sounds.
Now my words can flow freely
Loudly and silently
As no one knows me
I am new to this world.
I Am a new birdie 
Will fly higher and higher
On the new wings of imagination.
I am a cutie birdie! 
Welcome me please! 



I am a girl thats loud and proud
I am a girl thats big and tall
I am a girl that has  a big mouth to tell everybody off and to let them know that i'm there for them.
I am a girl that has  abig head filled of dreams and ideas. 

If I say I am handsome with charm and grace
Tall and dark with the most brilliant eyes and face
You will not believe
If I say I am the ugly of the ugliest
You may believe in
 
 
If I say I have an unbelievable potentiality
I can do a havoc in the field of poetry
You will not  believe
If I say I am the dull of the dullest
You may believe in
 
If I say I have a strong character of honesty
I have a  heart  full  of kindness and mercy
You will not believe
But if I say I am the  cruel of  the cruelest
You may believe in
 
If I say I have a fair mind unbiased clean
A soul as white as a paper unwritten
You will not believe
If I say I am the  lousy crook of the crook est
You may believe in.
 
If I say I am the most marginalized
The most deprived, the most victimized
You will not believe  
If I say I am a servant, a slave, born to serve
You may believe in.
 
If I say I am different, uncommon
I have different attitude and  opinion
You will not believe
If I say I am   the  dissident of the most dissident
You may believe in.
 
If I say I am a human being
I have a wish and a desire, 
To roam to fly to rise higher, 
Need equality, justice and honor, 
Some one to love and some one to care
Do you believe me

Rudyard was his name
Rude was his 'If'
but to me it was the Bible
and I pasted in in every table.

Kipling was his Surname
and he was my very dame
when I was lame
when I was framed
when I dont know
which way to go.
when they fooled me
and called me a fool
I sit alone watching their game.
when they made me idiot
and started playing idiot
among the stupids as I was thrown insipid
I pretended and wondered
so its okay to be a stupid.

As I was shuttled
from this court to that
among the mob
who dont know a cob
from a crowning lob
I sat in the hay stack
gazingly at crows courting
and squirrels mating
and leaves tasting
the breeze of love
with shimmer and shine.

Days passed by, 
chilhood joys were my ploys
I grew, yet I pretended to be baby
they called me mentally retarded
I laughed more, ensuring they repeated
they called me crazy, I acted noisy
and commented hastily, simply tastily
they called me a bully, I acted silly
few knew what is life
those who knew were in kitchen strife
sacrificed saints knew life noble
nobles risked ignorance and gambled.


I was motionless, they called me blank
I was meaningless they spoke ear to eardrums
I was allergic, they started gossiping
they mated me with men I found curious
They dated me with men I saw peculiarly obvious.
they studied my dress, they started disdressing
in distress am I they conjured upon
colluded and found I am unmarried hence forlorn
in Solitude as I built my mansions
and as started arranging balls and ballets
they cock and bull fairy tales did sold
I was watching every bee and belly
I loved every move, every twitch, every miss
every boy, every man, his style and his singing
every limb swinging and every hip cuddling
every eye twinkling and every hug spinning
every beauty and every creative arty 
simply I loved, to watch, to watch and I grew diabetic
I ate too much of life and living patterns
men and manly passions, women and womenly profusions
thus my digestive juices did not secrete enough
I ate some Kipling, 'If' was my tonic
it helped to vomit and appeased my stomach problems
Now with every new thing, I take a pill of 'If' 
and sleep in my own arms, with my own world hugged around. 


I am a lady of a stunning age, 
I can still perform on a stage.
I can still be someones pride, 
My range of interests is wide.

Putting on a stunning dress
I'll make every man confess
She is a woman of super class
Who hates swagger and sass.

With sniper fidelity and my charm, 
Without any noise and extra alarm
I'll kill all men on the spot, at once.
Not giving anyone a chance.

I can become someones prize.
That someone will have to realize
How much I am expressive, 
All in me is just impressive.

I can still be someone's Sunday, 
Make an ordinary day a holiday, 
Get a bottle of laugh from a store, 
At breakneck speed new explore.

And due to my fascinating view
I can make anything to become true
For example, replacing old with new
But - I just don't feel like to.

The h of April, am no more a man of my word
I lie each day to each person I see
I am a liar
Each gaze of my twinkling eyes
Would definitely tell you a new story
Each new time would you see me
I am no more persistent
No more constant fears
No more eternal sorrows
No more everlasting moments
Of temporary joys
No more psychedelic dreams
I am called sober
As I am respectable now
Still
I lie like I breathe
With each pulse of my arrhythmic heart
I sing a beautiful song
Wrapped in a glittery red paper
Of deceit and betrayal

Wow 
I am a Liar
I can make people believe in 
What I deny each night
Before going to bed
As I am an expert now
Hats off to me
What a great human I make
I can make words look like an ancient painting
Stroked with the brush 
Of vivid revelations
And people would believe
As it is divine


I am a liar today
I may be a saint tomorrow-         


I am a little rabbit, hrum – hrum, 

-         I like sweet carrot, hrum – hrum, 

-         I’m like a ferret, hrum – hrum, 

-         Live in a burrow, hrum – hrum, 

-         Though it’s narrow, hrum – hrum, 

-         Now I am eating cabbage, hrum – hrum, 

-         It’s for my courage, hrum – hrum.

-         Dear little rabbit, tell me about your habit! 

-         Hrum – hrum

Hundreds of thousands people 
Hundreds of thousands years
In the corner of their hearts 
Lives the black grain dolorous 
Creates a web
Gives a poisonous  pain 
I become very sad 
To lessen the sadness I laughed 
The laugh was very loud 
Before that I was very sane 
Now I am a mad man.

 
Now in the corner of my heart the sorrows dwell 
Making a bonfire taking the sense as a fuel
The fire has a too much glow too much heat
My heart bleeds, my mind takes a fit
To me now there is no difference of compassion and cruelty
People are making fun out of me very cheaply.
I could have saved myself very easily
If I was a blunt  
If I was an indifferent
But I was very sensitive 
I could not bear with the grief
Just to lessen my sadness, I laughed
The laugh was very loud 
Before that I was very sane 
Now I am a mad man.




My children planned a visit to a zoo, 
They invited me, I replied with a shoo, 
I already have a zoo inside, within me, 
I cannot show and you cannot see.

All the animals are present in a man, 
You can see them with an honest scan.
Both for the friends and their enemies, 
They have long, very long memories.

Like funny camels, like large elephants, 
Whether old or youths or innocent infants.
They often behave like a beast so wild, 
They don't hesitate to abuse a child.

For many centuries they've been killing fellow men, 
They have misused their sword and their pen, 
Most of their killings were in His religion and name, 
Man was never shy of this bloody game.

Men cast their thinking in a too old mold.
Those adventurists seeking silver and gold, 
Left footprints of animals in fact, 
I see in the prints many criminals in fact.

On the other hand like birds they twit, 
Under blue moons are lovely and sweet, 
Loyal and faithful like horses and dogs, 
Swim and jump just like the frogs, 

Entertain the children like a dolphin or a monkey, 
Before pretty women they flirt like a donkey, 
Like a peacock they dance in a hall, 
Like a sweet cuckoo, girlfriends they call.

They are handsome when they love fellow men, 
Praise them with their words and use their pen.
I don't need to watch a zoo, 
I am a man but an animal too. 

I am a parcel of vain strivings tied
By a chance bond together,
Dangling this way and that, their links
Were made so loose and wide,
Methinks,
For milder weather.

A bunch of violets without their roots,
And sorrel intermixed,
Encircled by a wisp of straw
Once coiled about their shoots,
The law
By which I'm fixed.

A nosegay which Time clutched from out
Those fair Elysian fields,
With weeds and broken stems, in haste,
Doth make the rabble rout
That waste
The day he yields.

And here I bloom for a short hour unseen,
Drinking my juices up,
With no root in the land
To keep my branches green,
But stand
In a bare cup.

Some tender buds were left upon my stem
In mimicry of life,
But ah! the children will not know,
Till time has withered them,
The woe
With which they're rife.

But now I see I was not plucked for naught,
And after in life's vase
Of glass set while I might survive,
But by a kind hand brought
Alive
To a strange place.

That stock thus thinned will soon redeem its hours,
And by another year,
More fruits and fairer flowers
Will bear,
While I droop here. 

I love my dog, a sweet dog, 
she is so big breasted
that when I wake up in the morning early
she gives me hai, good morning
when I go for jogging, 
she says well done, keep it up giggling
when i go for bathing, she says cool cool
when I rest in the noon, she says wake up, wake up
my mother is too proud of me that she hates my photos
lest others shall envy my beautiful handsome cheetos
I am a puppy proud, with a mother milking me aloud
I am a puppy proud, with a mother cuddling me growled. 


I never lie to myself                                                 Nor to anyone else                                                    Because I was raised good,                                           I am a real one in this world                                         And I am very optimistic anytime, but                                 I don't know about the other people                                       Because it's not my business,                                        I love all people even those who                                      Sometimes offend me in words or in actions,                          If someone slaps me on the right side of my face                      I will turn the left side of my face for him to slap me               And I am going to forgive him,                                       That's me all the time                                                Because this is way to forgive and to love all people, then             I can say proudly - to my sweetheart - that                           I am a real one in our world                                          Like the sun that rises in the east and sets in the west and         


I am a sacred being.
My sacred altar is the world around me.
I am sacred.
I am divine.
All begins and ends with love.

My purity of love
shall touch all around me.
This is my soul experience.


net)This evening I prayed
To the Mother of the Universe
Ma, get into my veins
My nerves and skin
And sing, sing and sing

She just smiled
As She ever does
The unfailing Mother
And here I am trying to sing
In sheer abandon

On a sultry evening
When friendly west winds
Have begun their amorous strokes
On the heads of sleeping palms
Across the plains
Against crimson skies

That have imbued into them
The hope of impending rains
Sing, sing, west wind
Sing you the lonely bird
That seeks a nest for the night
To hatch an egg
That breaks out next morn
In a universal song

The world is indeed beautiful
Grant me Ma discerning eyes
And a mind that can sing
Your eternal songs in ceaseless strains

A singer here I am
Who can't sing
Unyielding vocal cords
Yet, your song reverberates
In the silent skies
Of my thoughts
Through the bird
The hatching egg
And the stars who guard the nest

Sing, sing and sing
That is all I can do
Through everything that is a thing
That can sing
Ma You are nonpareil
It doesn't matter
If my vocal cords have failed 

The song still comes along
Gushing out through so many blessed things
The whole world is a song
Who cares if it is a cuckoo
Or a quail that sings
Whoever said I can't sing
When everything that I am is a song
I am a song that never stops to sing

I am a star
Larger than the moon
Size cannot be seen
I’m because of so far

My brightness and light
More powerful than the sun
It doesn’t feel
As the moon is so close

I am an outsider
And also an exoplanet*
To the solar system
And far away from light years

I ‘m also a moon
But not a parasite
And but more sensitive
To the dark and to the moon
But a star to you
Because of so far

Though I bring the light
To the thick darkness
You have been cheated and mislead 
As it is moon
Because of we both are so far 
At two ends




Who am I? 
Am I the descendant of slaves, cotton pickers, & civil right activists
Am I the child of parents who white America use to call nigger
Am I just someone that can only dance, sing, & play sports
Or am I just like you? 
Am I a great leader like Fredrick Douglas, Malcom X, & Dr. King 
I also have dream. In my dream a man is not judge by color
So a man of color can finally become that CEO, VP, or even president
A long time coming that is what they said.
Jim Crow was the law or at least that is what the sheriff & mayor said
But this is a new day I'll be damned if my kind is lynched again
I am not a Black Panther, but I preach black power & damn the klan
A long time coming that is what they said.
Well the time is here, the time is now, & we aren't going no where.
In the words of the late & great James Brown 
'Say it loud, I am black & I am proud'I am a woman up to the tips of my hair.
I am a woman by spirit and nature.
As no one I have got an innate flair.
As no one I need a daily rapture.



I can make an elephant out of a fly, 
My ‘yes’ a man can never deny.

I do not burn in the fire, 
In the water I do not sink, 
I know exactly who is a liar, 
And know what a man think.

Of cause I can stop even a train.
And to stop a horse is not the main.

I am a woman and a man doesn’t realize
How can I wear shoes of not my size.
I can do anything to get a chocolate
Or a beautiful with emeralds bracelet.

When autumn comes I want spring, 
In winter I want summer to ding.

I won’t give you any good reason
Why my mood depends on a season.
Out of the blue I’ll arrange drama
Picking the colorful makeup gamma.
 
But anyway, I am miracle of miracles, 
My inner world always sparkles.

I am a woman! I am like a sip of wine.
For Him I will do anything I can. 



i am accused of tending to the past
as if i made it,
as if i sculpted it
with my own hands. i did not.
this past was waiting for me
when i came,
a monstrous unnamed baby,
and i with my mother's itch
took it to breast
and named it
History.
she is more human now,
learning languages everyday,
remembering faces, names and dates.
when she is strong enough to travel
on her own, beware, she will. 

They are human beings, 
They have emotions, 
They have sentiments, 
They have passions, 
They feel and they think, 
What's wrong in it? 
If they want a change! 
If they desire, 
A needful revolution! 

They have been constrained, 
To stand on a road, 
Wherein all forks, 
Have been blocked, 
Behind them is a gun, 
Before them is a sun, 
Shining just on their heads! 
But enlightening paths as well! 

The rotten system, 
The dirty politics, 
The selfish politicians, 
Corruption and violence, 
Ignorance and illiteracy, 
Communal riots, 
Terror and extremism, 
Unemployment and street crimes, 
Rapes and robberies, 
And above all, 
The hungry poor men, 
Discussing all time, 
The conditions and situation, 
Now ripe to burst, 
For a change and revolution! 


I didn't see my shadow, 
I was alone, 
How helpless I looked! 
But truth is power, 
Could I speak the truth? 
I could not! 
For nine months, 
I regretted my past, 
I condemned my present, 
Too worried for my future, 
It wasn't only me, 
Everybody knew, 
What's going on to happen.
In a cold night of December, 
After a long bloodshed, 
After a deadly war, 
My heart was cut, 
Into two pieces, 
It could have been done, 
Without bloodshed! 

Afternoon is it, 
Length of shadows, 
Show a linear propagation, 
Soon these shadows, 
Will disappear, 
But why don't you think, 
That may be a deadly night, 
Of a bloody revolution! 

For the sake of men, 
For the sake of women, 
For the sake of children, 
For the sake of nation, 
Can't you get rid of ego, 
For a while only! 
And accept the fate, 
And move to a side, 
And avoid bloodshed! 

Let them come forward, 
Let them change the world, 
If they succeed, 
It will bring some good, 
To you even, sir.
And if they fail, 
The angry mobs, 
Will sweep them out, 
Like a dirty garbage.

I remind you, sir, 
Waleed told to Quraish, 
Let Muhammad (pbuh)   continue, 
If he succeeds, 
Will be honor for Arabs, 
And if he fails, 
He will be no more, 
But he was ignored, 
And I know it well, 
You will also ignore,

It is not a habit to be alone                                         With myself, but                                                     I watch the whole world with                                          Care because I am not carefree                                        Anytime, anywhere, and everywhere,                                   I am alone in this world because                                      I find myself better with myself                                      Rather than with people who can not                                   Respect my personal life and more,                                   It is difficult to be alone, but                                      What do you want to do with things                                    Around you anytime and anywhere?                                     I love to be alone with myself                                        And at the same time I love all                                       People on earth anywhere and everywhere,                             So being alone sometimes does not                                     Mean one-hundred percent to be far from the                                     Pretty people in our world, but it's                                  A pretty break with myself and my                                     Thoughts and my pretty words about the world.

  . .. 

The pair of eyes that I have, 
is restricted and limited for a few colors only, 
the rainbow I see is amazing, 
but I know the divine artist has trillion of colors, 
I couldn't see yet.
The beating prism, a spectroscope, 
makes a spectrum, 
having all the colors, 
the white screen placed at the focus, 
makes a real image, 
the deficient eyes cannot feel.
Being tired of my converging lenses, 
I brought a pair of diverging lenses, 
my thoughts are better to feel, 
the virtual image with all the colors.
when I saw all the colors, 
the beating prism once again, 
played its ancient role, 
my exercise was futile, 
as the colors were converged once again, 
in the white color of love, 
and I am already in love

Like a computer I too have disks, 
My operating system is installed in it, 
But I have derives in that I insert, 
A removable disk of my choice, 
My naughty beloved, 
Has infected my hard disk, 
What a virus is she! 
I tried to see porn of a beautiful girl, 
I don’t know how I found myself, 
And my beloved on the LCD, 
Oh! We look so ugly while loving each other! 
I am going to format my hard disk, 
I shall re-install the operating system, 
With a latest version of an anti-virus program 
I am at all not worried, 
The porn is saved in a removable disk, 
I never knew the virus of a real beloved, 
Cannot be cleaned and repeated attempts, 
May end in the failure of the old hard disk, 

(Just a fun, hope the readers will enjoy it)Why can't you collect your thoughts? 

It's not so easy, I am always busy.

When I want to collect them

They tell me they are busy. 

When I saw her first glimpse, 
I was amazed, what a beauty was she! 
but then I found I am unhappy with her, 
I wanted to see her more and more.
When I saw her in my sunny daylights, 
and in my starry moonlights, 
Oh! Here is she with the charms of an Eve! 
But when she left with a promise to come soon, 
I was again unhappy with her.
When she walked with me, 
and talked with me, 
I looked in her deep brown eyes, 
nothing came out of thirsty lips, 
when she gave her soft and pinkish right hand, 
in my rough and hot left hand, 
I was again unhappy with her.
I wanted a hug but she left me standing, 
I just watched her back and waist, 
slowly  moving away from me, 
suddenly she turned waived her hands, 
and left me alone! 
When she blossomed on blossom, 
and I kissed her, I was too unhappy, 
I wanted something more, 
While leaving me alone, 
she pointed the partition of her silky hairs, 
she shown me her empty wrists, 
there were no rings in her pinkish ears, 
she enveloped her neck, 
there was no necklace round it, 
this time she was unhappy with me! 
And with her I was also unhappy! 
Then she came in a lovely night, 
with colors on her palms, 
with jewels for her charms, 
with her open arms.
I saw an Eve has tides and storms, 
and the pearl of love when came with a wave, 
I, the naughty Adam! In fact a knave, 
I was once again unhappy, 
I wished the courtship would have prolonged some more

I am light, neither I am black nor I am white, 
These are the objects that react and write, 
Having many radiations of several wave lengths, 
And the objects grasp according to strengths, 
Properties and approach they have in all, 
Some digest all whether large or small, 
Keeping seven radiations of my lovely kite, 
They appear as black but their soul is white.

I am not sticking, the objects have glue, 
I'm neither violet nor indigo nor blue, 
Nor green nor yellow nor orange nor red, 
Neither I'm alive nor am I dead, 
Invisible I am and colors I grant, 
That depends on reflection and its want.

One reflects the seven and white is the write, 
I like colors, keep a few and reflect the elite, 
Sometimes appear as the printed violets, 
On indigo uniforms of girls' sweet sonnets, 
As blue sun glasses of a beauty on a bike, 
Like green belts their belly I strike, 
Like yellow ribbon in the silky hair, 
Like orange socks in the soft cute pair, 
Like red shoes I kiss their feet, 
This is how the beauty I love to treat.
Extremely amorous I am the nature, 
And you're my carvings and sculpture. 

I cry and you hear me laughing, 

I am angry and you see me smiling, 

I pray and you think I live, 

I tell you the truth and you don't believe, 

I make mistakes and you do not forgive, 

I am so week and you say I am strong, 

I am right and you say I am wrong, 

I look at your eyes and you look at the floor, 

I don't want to argue and you want more, 

I hate and you flatter, 

I suffer and you say it doesn't matter, 

I hold out my hand and you clench a fist, 

I speak about love and you say it doesn't exist, 

I am happy and you do not see it, 

I run and you make me to stumble, 

I show you my love and you just gamble.

I've got so many masks

and you do not try to take them off.

I am an actress and you are watching a film

which is not on the screen but in reality. 

I am an Anti War Creature

 

War is no more

Like before

War is all that politicians adore

War is hate, blood and death we abhor

War is erasing earth’s core

War is closing life’s door

War kills innocence that you ignore

War is widening the gap between the four

The East, the West, the South and the North

War will just devour

Our entire civilization store

You, warriors, what do-you explore? 

Your humanity and manhood I implore

You are throwing seas offshore

War murdered children then tore

Their parents under their eyes on the floor

Would you, please, tell me what’s the score

He gazes the Sun, he says I am an Atheist.
Now who is an atheist, he who denies god, 
now how do you deny something, you deny love, when you had loved early
now you deny permission, since you had already permitted somebody
now you say no, no, when there had been a scope for yes, yes.
What the eyes does not see, the mind does not grieve, that being so, 
what you don't know, how can you deny, or if you know, then how? 

Either you don't know god, or if you have conceived him, why did you? 
or how did you conceive him first hand, why dint you like the way
or the smell or the type or category or did not it suit your means
and ends? 

would you prefer nectar to be god, if you are a bee, 



thanks to: says-Your god is not my god, 
so how can you say that god does not, it is that the perception
of god, that had been seeded in your mind and thoughts does not
suit your present style of life, that's all, isn't it, 
now all Atheists are happy about one thing, that their common joy
is now sealed in a sealed cover, but if tomorrow never dies, 
then all are you are James Bonds Guy, then, you may love that lady

I am an echo
Overtaken by vibrations long ago created
Words and deeds resonated from the past
My present memory
A confluence in harmonic singularity
I am an echo
All that I am is all that I’ve been
My future self is an expectation of all echoes
Past, present and to be
I reverberate even now, sending forth echoes
To catch up and overtake myself
In every future
An echo, once started, propagates unidirectionally
Forward
Tomorrow exists today, for an echo
Ten years from now exists today, for an echo
I am an echo
Helping to create my future self
With every present moment
Themselves influenced by every past’s echo


I am emo
and emo is me
I choose darkness over light
for that is just what I like
I chose anger 
over joy
I don’t know how I became this way
prolly from all the pain I have been through
and am unable to let go
but even now I would not choose to be different
for I am who I am 
you do not like it too bad
you do not like the words I write
stop reading them
you can not judge me 
for you have not walked in my shoes
you have not seen the world through my eyes
until you feel the pain I have felt
do not judge me
I am emo
which mean I am emotional
I choose safe emotions
ones I know what will happen 
anger and hate
depression and pain
have now become my only friends
for they will never leave me
they will never betray me
you may see me and wonder why I am so angry
well I have my reasons
and all are sound
I am sick of trying to become some happy go lucky person
in truth I do not want to be one of them 
I am sick of running from myself 
trying to please those around me
I like being dark 
I like being angry
I like who I am 
I am emo
I bleed black ink
that is my release
my pen pours away my pain
the words flow from my soul
releasing all I used to try and hide
but I have now accepted
I have now learned to channel it all
channel it out through my pen
I am an emo poet
poetry and pain
those are my ways
my ways of life
you don’t like my ways
too bad not your life now is it
don’t read them


I'm drenched
in the flood 
which has yet to come 

I'm tied up 
in the prison
which has yet to exist
Not having played
the game of chess
I'm already the checkmate
Not having tasted
a single cup of your wine
I'm already drunk
Not having entered
the battlefield
I'm already wounded and slain
I no longer
know the difference
between image and reality
Like the shadow
I am
And
I am not



In this world                                                         I have no choice, but                                                 To be angry with everything and                                       Everyone because everything and                                       Everyone are angry with me and                                        I don't know why!                                                    I am angry with myself because                                        Myself is angry with me,                                             I am very sad and I am swimming                                       In a cup of water and my house                                        Is a nasty tent somewhere,                                           I live in abject poverty because                                      I am a forgotten refugee somewhere,                                  I have broken dreams and nasty                                        Nightmares everywhere,                                               I die a million of times everywhere                                   Because I am suffering this ugly life,                               I am angry with everything and everyone                               And even with myself, so no one should                                Blame me for that anytime and anywhere.

I am as I am and so will I be
But how that I am none knoweth truly,
Be it evil be it well, be I bond be I free
I am as I am and so will I be.

I lead my life indifferently,
I mean nothing but honestly,
And though folks judge diversely,
I am as I am and so will I die.

I do not rejoice nor yet complain,
Both mirth and sadness I do refrain,
And use the mean since folks will fain
Yet I am as I am be it pleasure or pain.

Divers do judge as they do true,
Some of pleasure and some of woe,
Yet for all that no thing they know,
But I am as I am wheresoever I go.

But since judgers do thus decay,
Let every man his judgement say:
I will it take in sport and play,
For I am as I am who so ever say nay.

To judge the best therefore intend,
For I am as I am and so will I end.

Yet some that be that take delight
To judge folks thought for envy and spite,
But whether they judge me wrong or right,
I am as I am and so do I write.

Praying you all that this do read,
To trust it as you do your creed,
And not to think I change my weed,
For I am as I am however I speed.

But how that is I leave to you;
Judge as ye list, false or true;
Ye know no more than afore ye knew;
Yet I am as I am whatever ensue.

And from this mind I will not flee,
But to you all that misjudge me,
I do protest as ye may see,
That I am as I am and so will I be. 

Do not weep for me when I no longer dwell
among the wonders of the earth; for my larger
self is free, and my soul rejoices on the other
side of pain.  

on the other side of darkness.

Do not weep for me, for I am a ray of sunshine
that touches your skin, a tropical breeze
upon your face, the hush of joy within your heart
and the innocence of babes in mothers arms.
I am the hope in a darkened night. And, in your
hour of need, I will be there to comfort you.
I will share your tears, your joys, your fears, 
your disappointments and your triumphs.

Do not weep for me, for I am cradled
and hear the music beyond the stars.

Do not weep for me, for I am within you; 
I am peace, love, I am a soft wind that caresses
the flowers. I am the calm that follows a
raging storm. I am an autumns leaf that floats
white snow that softly falls upon your hand.

Do not weep for me, for I shall never die, 
as long as you remember me. 
with a smile and a sigh.


To the twinkle of my eyes, 
From the swing of my hips
To the curve of my thighs, 
From the way I walk
And laugh, and talk, 
I AM Beautiful! 

Unashamed I am, 
Proud and joyful in my skin, 
Living an uncontained life, 
Free at last from hatred, 
Filled with love for all, 
Standing proud and tall, 
I AM Beautiful! 

December  am
because you are.
You are
because I am.

In the  familiar peace 
of our deepest joys, 

In the ignited space
of our deepest sufferings, 

in the release of
our deepest fears, 

we are each other.

Without the other
We have no happiness. 

My smiles are buds, 
my laughter are flowers, 
my hairs are silk, 
my eyes are stars, 
my cheeks are aurora, 
my teeth are diamonds
my lips rose petals, 
neck, a bottle of wine, 
my face is a moon.
Do you know who I am? 
I'm beloved of a poet! 

My complexion is fair, 
my skin is butter, 
my sweat aromatic, 
in my round soft arms, 
I have so many charms, 
my body has waves, 
my thighs are knaves, 
my leg is smooth, 
my feet are small, 
Do you know who I am? 
I'm beloved of a poet! 

But above all, 
I have a heart, 
it has love inside, 
not only for humans, 
for animals as well, 
and when my poet, 
a perfect human, 
becomes animal, 
I, too, become a beast, 
I cut him into pieces, 
don't leave any piece, 
I take all of him, 
and when he is dead in my arms, 
and in my unkind thighs, 
I stitch his pieces, 
and kiss the joints, 
he is alive once again, 
Do you know who I am? 
I'm beloved of a poet

Did I Love you
- because you are a diamond
- because you are a gold
- because you are a star
adored by the world
- because you are a song
that enlightened my soul
as my solitude is my heaven
only song can awaken my soul to joy

I say no for whatever reason
all of those I can't see and hear

For whatever reason
- I love you how
For whatever reason
- I love you who you are
For whatever reason
- the world will tell against you
- no matter what
- I don't listen
- I only listen to my heart

For whatever past you have
- I remain tongue - tied
For whatever particular darkness
you had been
- I will not insist to see
For I will light up your life
- with my body, soul and heart



Taken from my book- Bits and Pieces Of Thoughts


I am building a skeleton within, 
My first accomplishment of adulthood.
All other projects and five-year plans have failed.
And seeing others soaring on careers
While I, unable yet to walk, 
Have known what was the 'missing link' -
That deep bone structure of self-love.
As if born premature 
and on a diet too meager of that essential mineral
To ever harden cartilage, 
I remained soft as a baby's ear, 
Or like a jellyfish unable to withstand
the punch and thrust of life
Except to ride upon it.
As soon as I could feed myself
I wanted this more than anything: to ossify.

But in my childhood all I could manage
Was to toughen skin to a crustacean shield, 
Hiding the soft pulp from abuse.
And it would work for a while -
I could crawl about, retreat from harm.
But I sensed my shell was not what I needed: 
Encumbered in armor, 
The taste, warmth and texture
Of skin-to-skin remained out of reach.

So slowly plate by plate of mail
Sloughed off like scales, as the core
Thickens with the salt of tears
Held back, un-shed, but seeping
Into bone to fill the spaces. 

I haven’t been there, but my eyes can see it. 
Adorned in righteous robes, I’ll stand by the king. 
I will see angels flying with their angelic wings. 
Battles may be waged for my soul, but satan that 
I belong to JESUS, JESUS, JESUS, JESUS and JESUS! 
Your tricks and deceits would get to me anymore. 
You lost since you first started this spiritual war. 
I haven’t been there, but my eyes can see it. 

I am conscious of my inner Self.
I love my inner Self.

My negative experiences of life
are occasions to work on my inner Self
to understand my dualities.


It is this process of purification 
that leads me closer to my inner Self.



I am done trying hard to please you, 
I am done calling you baby, 
I had it with your lies, 
I had it with you playing with my emotions like it wasn’t nothing to you, 
You made me feel invisible, 
You made me want to disappear, 
You make me cry at nights, 
Wondering where you are, how you doing, or why haven’t you called me or IM me, 
I am done with you, 
I am fed up with all these heart breaks, 
No more you, 
Once more no more me yet again, 
I am done with it all, with you and everyone else with it. 

I am driven everywhere from a clinging home, 
O autumn eves! and I ween'd that you would yet 
have made, when your smouldering dwindled to odorous fume, 
close room for my heart, where I might crouch and dream 
of days and ways I had trod, and look with regret 
on the darkening homes of men and the window-gleam, 
and forget the morrows that threat and the unknown way. 
But a bitter wind came out of the yellow-pale west 
and my heart is shaken and fill'd with its triumphing cry: 
You shall find neither home nor rest; for ever you roam 
with stars as they drift and wilful fates of the sky

They see them drowning                                                     Like a piece of stone or                                              A piece of rock                                                       In the depths of the scary seas                                       Without doing anything to rescue                                      The pretty kids with their mothers                                    And the rest of men,                                                 They just watch                                                       Pretty souls drowning in the sea's                                    Abdomen to be delicious food to all                                   Sharks, whales, and the rest of the fish,                            It's a shame on this world and on                                     Everything in it because we let poor                                  Refugees die like this for ever,                                     It's a shame on all of us anywhere and                                And everywhere if we live after today,                               I am drowning in the seas of our corruption                           And our darkness without any pretty hopes, then                       Peace be upon those who got drowned near the                          The shores of shame without being rescued by anyone

They see them drowning                                                     Like a piece of stone or                                              A piece of rock                                                       In the depths of the scary seas                                       Without doing anything to rescue                                      The pretty kids with their mothers                                    And the rest of men,                                                 They just watch                                                       Pretty souls drowning in the sea's                                    Abdomen to be delicious food to all                                   Sharks, whales, and the rest of the fish,                            It's a shame on this world and on                                     Everything in it because we let poor                                  Refugees die like this for ever,                                     It's a shame on all of us anywhere and                                And everywhere if we live after today,                               I am drowning in the seas of our corruption                           And our darkness without any pretty hopes, then                       Peace be upon those who got drowned near the                          The shores of shame without being rescued by anyone

I don't drink wine and                                                   I never drank wine in my life, but                                       
 I am completely drunk all the time                                      Because all that goes on around us                                      
Makes me like this upon seeing innocent                                  Kids, innocent women, innocent men,                                      
Innocent animals, and all innocent souls                                  Die without any logical reasons,                                         
 Our hearts are made of stainless steel and                                                  Not made of iron and our minds are completely dead                       In a cruel world that allows killers and murderers                        Walk freely and go shopping for knives to kill,                          
It's a shame and it's a shame and it's one trillion                     Of shames on all of us for allowing massacres and                           Mass murders to happen by very well-known criminals                       And dirty tyrants in clear daytime and in dark nights,                    This world of ours is absurd and meaningless as long as            We are incapable of doing anything to save the pretty human souls           And to save the pretty humanity amid cruel revenge and brutal               Hatred by cruel tyrants who do not have pretty hearts, so                   O pretty world, go to bed for ever and ever because                       A new tomorrow will bring something new to everyone

I am tired
tired of the walls closed around me
tired of blindness when I wish to see
I am scared
scared of the love that will never come
scared of where the darkness is from
I am angry
angry at truths that are perceived wrong
angry at the uselessness of a happy song
I am sad
sad for those left behind
sad for the happiness they cannot find
I am confused
confused with the madness of this world
confused with the life into which I'm hurled
I am helpless
helpless to keep my innocence
helpless of it to make any sense
I am dead
dead to the world around me
dead to the people, who refuse see


I am happy
Happy with the life I have been living
Happy with the kindness I have been giving
I am thankful
Thankful for a family's love unconditional
I am wise
Wise enough to know when something is wrong
Wise enough to be uplifted by a joyous song
I am understanding
Understanding that life is not always fair
Understanding that anger leads to despair
I am brave
Brave enough to right wrongs of late
Brave enough to accept my own fate
I am patient
Patient for my future and what is in store
Patient for love, career, horses, and more
I am alive
Alive in the world that I was meant to be
Alive to everyone whom I make see


Every morning when I feel the sunshine, 
filtering in my room over the hills and trees, 
I remember my care free childhood mornings, 
when my parents would happily toss me up and down in air, 
I remember the beautiful dawn of my married life, 
when me and my wife would feel eternally bonded together in the sunshine, 
Now I am all alone welcoming the cheerful day, 
The shadows of the past have made me think that I am getting old.

I look at my picture album sometimes, 
I wonder why my hairline is shrinking away, 
I wonder why it is getting harder to chew the food everyday, 
I wonder where my adrenaline is gone these days, 
why can't I play the soccer and the tennis as I used to, 
till my kids and people around me remind me, 
that I am not only getting old, but I am old.

I used to look for respect in my younger days, 
till I realized that the respect is given not expected, 
now I find it everywhere even from people I never knew, 
Now I feel relaxed with no fears and pressures of life's turmoil’s, 
I love young and old, I try to find the meaning of my life, 
I am at peace with myself, I am in love with nature, 
I am glad, I am getting old. 

There is light on the other shore.
I have to walk into light.

Unknown, 
without a body, 
without a form
without a figure.

My senses are incapable
to sense the Almighty.


A human being can 
very Personally
more than mummy and Dad.

even when I commit sins. 

Teeth of flowers, hairnet of dew,
hands of herbs, you, perfect wet nurse,
prepare the earthly sheets for me
and the down quilt of weeded moss.

I am going to sleep, my nurse, put me to bed.
Set a lamp at my headboard;
a constellation; whatever you like;
all are good: lower it a bit.

Leave me alone: you hear the buds breaking through . . .
a celestial foot rocks you from above
and a bird traces a pattern for you

so you'll forget . . . Thank you. Oh, one request:
if he telephones again
tell him not to keep trying for I have left . . . 

I am greedy for I longed to hear few heartfelt words
That never came from you.

I am greedy
I expected a few kind words for I cared and  looked after you lovingly

I am greedy
I expected a few soothing words for
I drank the tears of pain and hatred given by you.

I am greedy I expected something in return from you.
Which I never should have.

Words are very precious.
Its like drops of water.
Its true. 
A few drops of water can really save ones life.

It may be in human nature
A words of appreciation can do wonders.

The fact of life is
One should not be addicted to words
Without that life will become lifeless.
One should not feel low
If one doesn't get appreciation.
Think it was our duty and free yourself from expecting anything in return.
This will bring peace in ones life.

Expecting something in return
May be a few words, 
Make me feel
I am greedy! 



I am happieee cos 
Every morning I wake up, 
I feel I am the blessed on earth to see.
The most handsome man lying next to me.
He's the one I cherish and love, 
He is the one I live for, 
A blessing sent from Heaven above on hearing my prayers.
I love him more and more and will
love him as a faithful wife should, 
Do everything for him I could.
As he is my everything.
I would let him know everyday, 
That I love him more than words can say.
Cannot think of a second without him.
He is my blessing from Heaven.
For the  smart little one we have together, 
It will keep our love for each other strong, 



I AM he that aches with amorous love;
   Does the earth gravitate? Does not all matter, aching, attract all
         matter?
   So the Body of me, to all I meet, or know. 

I am here, though it does not feel like it. 

Every time I wake, I wonder am I really here? 

Or am I dreaming from heaven or hell? 

Even some place in between-

It takes me a while to realize that I am still here, 

Alive and well, physically, anyways.

With so many thoughts running through my head, 

So early, it is, in the morning, 

I often wonder if I will make it through the day.

I rise from my bed, 

Thinking about what excuse I can make, 

To convince myself to stay in this world.

Some days, I can find a reason to live.

Other days, I am just to numb to do anything.

But many other days I am so down, 

And no matter what anyone says or does, 

I want to die.

It’s that simple.

Nothing more, nothing less.

By nightfall I am so lonely, 

With no one around to hold my hand, 

Or comfort me in anyway.

Not because they are not there, 

But because in my mind they have left me.

Alone-

Misunderstood-

I feel like nothing is left and finally I drift into sleep.

Waiting for tomorrow to come so I can once again, 

Try to convince myself to find a reason, 

A reason for living



I am here and you are there
And you are here and I am there
As each to each the other moves
Constant as the murmuring waves
Breaking in soliloquies
Upon a silent shore, 
The sea and sand together and apart
Yet always touching as you touch my heart.
For I am here and you are there
It matters not how far the where.
Each to each the love shall move
Since you are here and I am there. 

I Am Human

I am human! Hear me roar! 
Fear my shout that kills the shore.

I am human!  Watch me kill.
My bill for death will never fill.

I am human!  Smell my waste.
In the sea, death's the taste.

I am human!  Taste my sweat.
As I slaughter each animal sans threat.

I am human!  Feel me feel.
You'll get nothing that is real.

I am human!  Is that so great? 
Animals are to early for late.
I am human!  Do you see? 
Being human is not for me. .. 

let me flatter a friend (or is she. . a foe?)     

. . 

i am imitating him. Oh i want a color. . 

red? 

or.   

blue? I'll take something else.  . . 

green? 

how about trees? apple trees for a background.
how about sighs? for some sounds.
how about.  yes. .. 

moans. . lots of moans.
sex? could you? 

. .. 

you are bored and old and. .. 

dying? . . 

are you? 

how about cheese? lots of cheese
oh i love fumodoro tomatoes? lots of sauce.

i love being with you. 
I love doing things with you inside the room.
Let me have you.
 Please stay.
 I still have lots of cheese, and tomatoes, 
and apple trees, and reds and greens, and. 

sighs. ..! am and this is time of my own universe
as when mine is truncated by the guiles 
by the crowd yet known or unknown 
own ness is the desire of the soul own 

earth still divides into cells infinitesimal 
onto the dusts, even by years and hours divisible
by the flex of moments in second in detraction
when inflicted upon by the reeks of vagaries.

the galloping inevitable the flux yet unspecified 
dream when bridles in the hands of unknown
embarking upon need of hours on the sands
in the desert never when  asserts its home

room of ownership riffles through the soul
the legacy of love when rocked up by the blue
laid over the hatred of the minion demand
curve of meaning meandering forward intoned

time when unrestrained by the infringement
if you love me I may not be with you absolute
still I follow the chilled snow heath as abandoned
even the breath of fire when flounced upon glow
 
boat still moves trudging path by the truth
along depthless sojourn of uncertainty as despised
looking to the deathless journey ahead of timeless death
I may disappear from the dust but the raved up tones!

I am in chains, O maiden-rose,
And yet, not shameful of these guards;
A nightingale, thus, - in dense laurels -
A feathered king of the woods' bards,
A proud and charming rose over,
In a sweet bondage - lives for long
And softly sings for her a song
Under a sensual night's cover. 

I am often so attracted, 
Mesmerized and enchanted, 
Having watched pretty things, 
With magic in their wings, 
Flying at human height, 
Touching eyes like a light, 
Getting inside very deep, 
With a pleasant soul peep, 
Then my eyes smile, 
Making heart juvenile, 
And I say to myself, 
Put book in the shelf, 
Watch beauty an' sacrifice, 
Your self, may be nice, 
I then sing like a dove, 
I am now in love. 

Oh Mother
I am
That daughter of yours
Who you see
as capable for every thing
You dream your unrealised  dreams
Through my eyes
You see me as one
Who progresses  ahead
Setting  aside all hurdles
My every success
Becomes your pride.

You say
I am beautiful
All  Sarees  look nice on me
I also admit
I can wear nicely
All colour Sarees
Be it of  anger or anguish
Neglect or intolerance
I drape them
So  dexterously 
That I look beautiful to all.
No, No, 
Perhaps I look beautiful to you
You say
Your daughter is beautiful
You don't know
How much strength 
Is there in your words
Only I know
It is   your  love 
That are my weapons
My  power
I  dazzle in this  light  and
I look beautiful 
So  beautiful

I am in need of music that would flow
Over my fretful, feeling fingertips,
Over my bitter-tainted, trembling lips,
With melody, deep, clear, and liquid-slow.
Oh, for the healing swaying, old and low,
Of some song sung to rest the tired dead,
A song to fall like water on my head,
And over quivering limbs, dream flushed to glow!

There is a magic made by melody:
A spell of rest, and quiet breath, and cool
Heart, that sinks through fading colors deep
To the subaqueous stillness of the sea,
And floats forever in a moon-green pool,
Held in the arms of rhythm and of sleep. 

Look at me in your great kindness. 
In  mercy turn towards me.
Boundless is your kindness.

I am in pain, 
terribly afflicted.
 
Come down to me 
with your saving hands.

Revive my lowly heart.
Help me to sing 
a song of praise
to glorify your name 
even in dire distress. 

A stone's throw from my house
There is a broken window
It wasn't my fault, honest.
I was aiming for the door. 

I try to do
the right thing, because it is right.
Morally from good book's made thus.
Like Paul, 
I to was once in Florida's prison's.
I have 
no disire to have my head cut off
nor boiled alive in oil.
Just for, 
the ignorant amusement of Trump, my neighbor.
Reading a book by Hitler, called fear.
While forcing me to read, Sun Tzu's, Art of War. 

I am a killer, 
Yes, I have a slow poison, 
It is pollution, 
I have polluted the air, 
I have polluted the water, 
I have polluted the rivers, 
I have polluted the oceans
I have shaved the forests.
I am trying to kill my mother, 
How ignorant I am, 
I know she will survive always, 
If anyone is to die it’s me, 
I am born to die, 
But before my death, 
I am leaving behind my children, 
I am struggling for their present, 
I am struggling for their future, 
But what will be the future of my grand grandchildren? 
My mother will not die, 
Even if she goes in coma, 
She will get up once again, 
With my green brothers and sisters, 
My race will die, 
But she will give birth to another race, 
Just a matter of time, 
Even if it takes millions of years, 
My mother will come out of the coma, 
But I will not see that spring, 
I will not see the virgin snow falls, 
I will not see those lake and streams
I will not see the virgin rivers, 
I will not see the virgin oceans, 
That will be a virgin race of my brothers and sisters, 
Smiling in the cradle of her lovely arms! 

The ozone belt if damaged too much, 
Will increase temperature of the earth, 
Glaciers will melt, 
Sea level will rise, 
Most of the earth, 
Will turn into oceans! 

A mother is a mother, 
It’s a matter of time, 
The mother can replace the existing sons, 
Like me with slow poisons!


'I am left alone'
I was left alone, 
She left me for a reason I know not.
She didn't care to think of me, 
But she left me for a reason I know not.
She left alone not only me, 
But she left everyone on earth.
My only friend-  now no more, 
I am left alone! ! 

They befriended me-
I knew not why.
I was their puppet, used for their expense.
Can't imagine why such a rude game, 
Why all those tricks on me.
All those back stabs, all those heartless behaviours, 
Makes me miss her more, 
My only friend-  now no more.
I am left alone! ! 

Then they all abandoned me
Cos this puppet started boring them.
They abandoned me causing me to hate my life, 
But they started enjoying life.

I grew weak, 
I grew timid.
I miss her, 
My only friend-  now no more, 
I am left alone! ! 

All my boldness gone, all my happiness gone, all my strength gone.
Then I realised- all those went along with her.

Miss you my friend, my only friend-  now no more.
I am left alone! 

I am lonely everyday
as I watch the world
pass my way.

I am lonely in my room
as I stare at the walls
and been thinking of you.

I am lonely outside
as I see you
passing me by.

I am lonely inside
as I see that day
you had died. 

I am a simple being love
Uncomplicated my love
Easy to be a friend love
Easy to be fully connected love
I am what you see love

My heart very delicious
You will never lose your appetite
Let me fill your heart with delight
My heart truly luscious
Lets fall in love again and again.


***The Book of Passion (Till death do us apart)


I am the way you see the world.
I prompt the thoughts you have every day.
Find me in your gasp of delight
When viewing dawn's sunrise, then I will stay.

I will be fire, in your breast, 
Setting ablaze all the dreams of your mind.
I am your scales, the weights you use
To judge motives fairly of humankind.

I am your bridge to measure truths.
I go beyond conditions,  yearning
To teach you peace, I bring release
Into your soul freely, which you can't earn.

I am Love, - -  please deal with me tenderly
Then your best interests I can defend. 

I am love's Savant
Of perilous divining; 
No simpering hierophant, 
Of the desperately climbing.

For love arrives naked, 
Sans cloak or cloche, 
While love's finger beckons, 
For me to come close.

I'm privy to his prophecy; 
To the keyholes I tiptoe, 
Where I see the aristocracy-
In flagrante delicto.

As his scribe, I'm resigned
To write impassioned words; 
Still, desires will not rewind-
Even though they be absurd. 

I am mad with love 
And no one understands my plight. 
Only the wounded 
Understand the agonies of the wounded, 
When the fire rages in the heart. 
Only the jeweller knows the value of the jewel, 
Not the one who lets it go. 
In pain I wander from door to door, 
But could not find a doctor. 
Says Mira: Harken, my Master, 
Mira's pain will subside 
When Shyam comes as the doctor. 

I am a man of passion, of conviction, of faith.
I am a man of love, of laughter and of anger.
I am a man of strength, who despairs, who weeps.
I am a man enraged by mans inhumanity to man
and perplexed by He who seems unable to
stop the madness.

I feel, touch, smell, taste and I see the good
in man. In my deepest despair, somehow I
know that all will be right, for I am an eternal
optimist. I am compelled to hope for the
best in humanity.

I weep for those who worship at the alter
of ambition, for they shall leave in their
wake, their children, their loved ones, 
millions of orphans of success.

I am man and in my failures and in my
short comings, I continue my utmost
to do His will.

I am the most unique animal in the Kingdom.
I am the most intelligent and I have many faults.
I am all these things and more.  

for I am man.

I won't change.
Love me or hate me; 
Doesn't matter, I'm to blame.

Controversial to the core, 
You'll see what there is, nothing more.
Accuse me of something, 
I may prove you right.

I'm a little gift; 
Fed


Ex'd from h*ll.
Sorry, Mum and Dad, 
You didn't deserve this; Oh, well.

I guess it's a pity
That people like you
Should have a daughter
They can't bear to endure.


I am not as beautiful
Don't come so close
I am not made of flowers
I am me
And I cannot be nobody else
You must love me
All my flaws regardless


I am much too alone in this world, yet not alone 
enough
to truly consecrate the hour.
I am much too small in this world, yet not small 
enough
to be to you just object and thing, 
dark and smart.
I want my free will and want it accompanying 
the path which leads to action;
and want during times that beg questions, 
where something is up, 
to be among those in the know, 
or else be alone.

I want to mirror your image to its fullest perfection, 
never be blind or too old
to uphold your weighty wavering reflection. 
I want to unfold.
Nowhere I wish to stay crooked, bent; 
for there I would be dishonest, untrue. 
I want my conscience to be 
true before you;
want to describe myself like a picture I observed 
for a long time, one close up, 
like a new word I learned and embraced, 
like the everday jug, 
like my mother's face, 
like a ship that carried me along 
through the deadliest storm. 

everyone fears the monster under their bed
I fear the monster in my bed 
I fear me
for I am the one that continues on in pain
I am the one that seeks comfort in the darkness
into this pain and suffer
I am my own monster
my mind is my deepest fear
my thoughts are the only  bumps in the night that fear
most fear the darkness
well I live in it
my mind fears the light
for we fear what we do not understand
and I do not understand the light
happiness.  

what is that
love. .. 

what does that feel like
I fear not only the light but the rejection if I ever tried to come into the light
for when you live in the darkness
you live alone
no possibility of rejection
I feel safe and cold in the darkness
but what is this warmth I hear the light tease about
it do not know how it feels to be warm
I love the darkness’s cold embrace
when I feel it I know I am safe
when I feel it slip away that is when I start to worry 
I start to fear
it usually means the light is near
I want to make it in to the light
I want to feel these things 
warmth 
love
and happiness
but my mind screams no
it starts to worry
it starts to over think
it feeds the fear 
and I am stuck feeling it grow within
drowning in fear 
I turn and run into the darkness
searching for its 
cool embrace
and only then 
do the screams of fear stop
only then does my mind slow
and try to rest
only then do I feel no fear\none at all
sure I feel pain and suffering
but I have felt those for so long 
they have become my only company
my only friends
I know everything about them 
and they know me 
and accept me
unlike the light I am certain of the darkness
sure it is full of pain and suffering 
but I know how those feel
I understand the darkness
I know the darkness 
the light is totally unknown to me
and for that reason it scares me
really scares me


I am not the sun, 

I do not radiate light, 

I like to have fun, 

don't like to fight.



I am not the sun, 

I can't live alone, 

even having fun

I'd like to be flown.



Someone calls me sunny

and I certainly like it, 

but prefer to hear honey, 

for me it's more a fit.



I am not the sun, 

I am just a woman.

Yes, I like to have fun

but dream about a romance.



I am not an angel, 

I have no wings, 

when I read the Bible

it touches my souls strings.



I am not an angel, 

I am on earth, 

I go to the temple, 

I know it's worth.



Yes, I am not an angel, 

you should know that.

I prefer to be real

but.  sorry.  not a pet.



I am not to follow an example

but always try to win.

I hate those who trample beauty, 

I think it's one of the biggest sins. 

Nor I am inborn poet.
Nor with any special talent driving me to be a poet.
Just picked few words of dew drops
Each dews looked like a glittering pearl.
Guided the dew drops to flow freely through a channel painted in canvas.
Finally, went on binding pearls into a thread of passion.
Enchanting fragrance of jasmine gave a glow of touch to the poetic garland.
Each petals of rose added a beauty to its looks.
Poetic ice cream with cherry toppling just ready to be served.
Savoured by your lovely comments.
Your each comments, I have kept as treasures in my heart.

I drove the poetic vehicle without following proper rules and regulations.
Went on switching lanes of tense.
Grammatical errors were chasing me from behind.
With some sparks of punctuations! 
Many horns buzzed me to correct the lines.

I am not a poet yet..
As I learnt a lot from you and still learning from you.
As you showed me the different paths through which a poem can travel.
You taught me, 
Poem is like a reflecting diamond where each angles reflects differently.
You taught me, 
To understand what critics wanted to tell.
My some poems ended just into a question mark.
With no way of turning back.
I couldn't revert it back.

I attract a penalty.
My poetic vehicle is towed by a traffic police for reverse driving.
I was charged for over speeding poems in a wonderful way, 
one after the another
Made a traffic jam to enter PH highway road.
My van will be released only if I gave a confirmation stating
No more further mistakes! ! 




welcome to the real world
I will no longer be your toy
for I am a real person
I am no ones toy
and never will be again
all you did 
was push me and push me
over and over
to see when I would break
then you would push again
testing me 
to see how much I can take
is that really what pleases you? 
Watching me break
over and over
well I will no longer take
it for you have push me over the edge
too many times to count
and I have had enough
boy will you be shocked 
for the next time you try to push me
I will stand my ground
for the truth is
you can no longer affect me
I am finally free of your evil and twisted games
you can no longer play with me
I am not a toy
I can see it now
you will try to push me 
over and over
and I will not budge
oh boy will I laugh
just as you laughed 
every time you watched me break
as if I was in no real harm
well I will stare right into your eyes
and you will no longer see pain in them
you will see laughter
for I will then watch you break 
and then 
only then will you learn
how it feels
maybe then you your twisted mind will stop


The night, it is deserted 
from the mountains to the sea. 
But I, the one who rocks you, 
I am not alone! 

The sky, it is deserted 
for the moon falls to the sea. 
But I, the one who holds you,
I am not alone ! 

The world, it is deserted. 
All flesh is sad you see. 
But I, the one who hugs you, 
I am not alone

I am not far from you 
Your eyes shall know to look, I am in your looks 
Perhaps closer to you than yourself 
I am at every beat of your heart.  

I am not I.
              I am this one
walking beside me whom I do not see,
whom at times I manage to visit,
and whom at other times I forget;
the one who remains silent while I talk,
the one who forgives, sweet, when I hate,
the one who takes a walk when I am indoors,
the one who will remain standing when I die. 

Until I have broken the form
Until madness has not prevailed
Until I am not drunk dead
Until my mind speaks the sense
Until I recognize faces
Until my memory is intact
Until I have flown without wings
Until the rules of love I break
Until the beloved is one with me
Until the friends leave me not
Until the self speaks in agony
Until I am not the song
Until heart chords in passion rupture
Until I am the tear in your eyes
Until in enchantment I dance
Until my head is blown in the air
I am not in love
I just lay here
battered and broken
used and abused
for I am just a rag doll

they used me 
until I broke
and then they leave me
toss me aside
for I am just a rag doll

I lay here 
battered and broken
used and abused
waiting
for I am just a rag doll

I lay here
waiting 
waiting for someone new
someone who will not break me
for I am just a rag doll

once there was one
one who tried to fix me
but then he broke 
and tossed me aside
for I am just a rag doll

one after another 
I’m used and abused
I’m now broken beyond repair
I will forever be tossed aside
for I am just a rag doll

will one of them 
ever realize that I am not just a rag doll 
even though that is what I’ve been told
and even though that is how I act
will any of them ever see past that
for I am not just a rag doll

for I all I want 
is to be someone’s
something
for then if they try to fix me I think I’ll be able to fix the rest
I just want someone to want me 
not just to used me and then toss me aside
but want to keep me
call me theirs
for I am not just a rag doll

and then only then 
I will heal
I will no longer be just a rag doll
I will be theirs
I will no longer be tossed aside
I will no longer be used and abused
for I will finally belong somewhere
for I will finally belong with someone
for I am not just a rag dollthere is something really wrong
with you, 
you have cut yourself off from
the intestines of mankind, 

what is it that makes you stay? 
that makes you look like a closed jar, 
what made you cut off that tongue
what sharp difference have you made
out of that lonely self? 

' i am not lonely' he quipped.
and the room fell silent, the wall
embarrassed about its nature.
and the window, compromised
with a smile, perhaps 'well said'. 

This road is too long, but                                            It's not impossible because                                           I made up my mind to walk it                                          Till the end,                                                        I am not a superman to be, but                                        Things can be done if there is                                        A strong will, so I am going                                          To be anytime your pretty man. 

A woman in control, that's what everyone sees
Don't look too far, don't go within
The me you see is only my skin

My emotions are shattered, I'm not all together
My inner thoughts you could never weather
Leave me alone, just let me be
The me you see is not the one you want me to be


I am not yours, not lost in you,
Not lost, although I long to be
Lost as a candle lit at noon,
Lost as a snowflake in the sea.

You love me, and I find you still
A spirit beautiful and bright,
Yet I am I, who long to be
Lost as a light is lost in light.

Oh plunge me deep in love--put out
My senses, leave me deaf and blind,
Swept by the tempest of your love,
A taper in a rushing wind. 

I am, O Anxious One. Don't you hear my voice
surging forth with all my earthly feelings?
They yearn so high, that they have sprouted wings
and whitely fly in circles round your face.
My soul, dressed in silence, rises up
and stands alone before you: can't you see?
don't you know that my prayer is growing ripe
upon your vision as upon a tree?
If you are the dreamer, I am what you dream.
But when you want to wake, I am your wish,
and I grow strong with all magnificence
and turn myself into a star's vast silence
above the strange and distant city, Time.

'I am of Ireland,
And the Holy Land of Ireland,
And time runs on,' cried she.
'Come out of charity,
Come dance with me in Ireland.'

One man, one man alone
In that outlandish gear,
One solitary man
Of all that rambled there
Had turned his stately head.
That is a long way off,
And time runs on,' he said,
'And the night grows rough.'

'I am of Ireland,
And the Holy Land of Ireland,
And time runs on,' cried she.
'Come out of charity
And dance with me in Ireland.'

'The fiddlers are all thumbs,
Or the fiddle-string accursed,
The drums and the kettledrums
And the trumpets all are burst,
And the trombone,' cried he,
'The trumpet and trombone,'
And cocked a malicious eye,
'But time runs on, runs on.'

I am of Ireland,
And the Holy Land of Ireland,
And time runs on,' cried she.
"Come out of charity
And dance with me in Ireland.'.  

that I am lost. 
I hid for so long who I am
and had to pay the highest cost
for what cost could be more dear
than not knowing who you are
so I am of the opinion I fear. 
.  

that I am lost.  

I am offering this poem to you,
since I have nothing else to give.
Keep it like a warm coat,
when winter comes to cover you,
or like a pair of thick socks
the cold cannot bite through,

I love you,

I have nothing else to give you,
so it is a pot full of yellow corn
to warm your belly in the winter,
it is a scarf for your head, to wear
over your hair, to tie up around your face,

I love you,

Keep it, treasure it as you would
if you were lost, needing direction,
in the wilderness life becomes when mature;
and in the corner of your drawer,
tucked away like a cabin or a hogan
in dense trees, come knocking,
and I will answer, give you directions,
and let you warm yourself by this fire,
rest by this fire, and make you feel safe,

I love you,

It's all I have to give,
and it's all anyone needs to live,
and to go on living inside,
when the world outside
no longer cares if you live or die;
remember,

I love you. 

I’ll put on diet my fattish ass
So that the doorway I could pass.
I’ll do some exercises to lose weight
As fat asses I just hate.
I would like to look a model of super class
Or may be like a slander lass.
I know it’s too bad to amass fat, 
But-while rhyming this couplet
I am looking at an apple pie
And a big saliva appears in my eye.

I am a sister! 
I am a lover! 
I am a wife! 
I am a mother! 
I am a grand mother! 

I am all in one! 
I am one in all! 

I am leaving it to you.



not the beloved herself:
true love is for the treasure,
not for the coffer that contains it.'
The real beloved is that one who is unique,
who is your beginning and your end.
When you find that one,
you'll no longer expect anything else:
that is both the manifest and the mystery.
That one is the lord of states of feeling,
dependent on none;
month and year are slaves to that moon.
When he bids the 'state,'
it does His bidding;
when that one wills, bodies become spirit. 

I am pale with longing for my beloved;
     People believe I am ill.
Seizing on every possible pretext,
     I try to meet him 'by accident.'

They have sent for a country doctor;
     He grabs my arm and prods it;
How can he diagnose my pain?
     It's in my heart that I am afflicted.

Go home, country doctor,
     Don't address me by my name;
     Don't force your medicines on me.

The sweetness of his lips is a pot of nectar,
     That's the only curd for which I crave;
     He will feed me nectar again and again.

Not rightly balanced
I drop off in the grass,
like the old Cave-sleepers, to browse
wherever I fall. 

For hundreds of thousands of years I have been dust-grains
floating and flying in the will of the air, 
often forgetting ever being
in that state, but in sleep
I migrate back. I spring loose
from the four-branched, time -and-space cross,
this waiting room.

I walk into a huge pasture
I nurse the milk of millennia

Everyone does this in different ways.
Knowing that conscious decisions
and personal memory
are much too small a place to live,
every human being streams at night
into the loving nowhere, or during the day,
in some absorbing work. 

The confidence I spent years belittling down
To nothing somehow regained its strength.
The insecurities I let dictate my happiness I now see
Not as imperfections, but perfections that make me me.  
I have figured out making myself feel unworthy of anything, 
Has hidden amazing things I could be sharing.  
No longer am I afraid of the light that shines within me.  
I won't let fear conceal the happiness I know I deserve.  
There is no one like me, and for that reason, 
I deserve nothing but the best.  
I will look at my reflection and not run from it 
But embrace it.  
I am perfect the way I am. 

A diamond am I-
Rejected? Dejected not-
Unaffordable! ! 

I am restless. I am athirst for far-away things.
My soul goes out in a longing to touch the skirt of the dim distance.
O Great Beyond, O the keen call of thy flute!
I forget, I ever forget, that I have no wings to fly, that I am bound in this spot evermore.

I am eager and wakeful, I am a stranger in a strange land.
Thy breath comes to me whispering an impossible hope.
Thy tongue is known to my heart as its very own.
O Far-to-seek, O the keen call of thy flute!
I forget, I ever forget, that I know not the way, that I have not the winged horse.

I am listless, I am a wanderer in my heart.
In the sunny haze of the languid hours, what vast vision of thine takes shape in the blue of the sky!
O Farthest end, O the keen call of thy flute!
I forget, I ever forget, that the gates are shut everywhere in the house where I dwell alone

Friends, I can't run with you, 
But I enjoy all fun with you, 
You do something and me a talker
You are splinters and I am a walker, 
Even my jogging is not uniform, 
How can I what you perform.
Present is for you I am living in the past, 
It does not mean a complete contrast! 

Wait, I recall her lovely long jumps, 
Sexy, beautiful her high strong jumps, 
Attractive exposure during javelin throws, 
Her lips, her arms and the lovely eye brows, 
When javelin went high and far in skies, 
The javelin of beauty through my dim old eyes, 
Put a magic in the heart and vigor in me, 
I am running faster, can't you see

It’s such a joyful day! 

A rainbow glitters in the bright sky, 
Majestic as it arches over Heaven.

Such an outstanding display of nature’s grace.
Amidst the visages painted with cheer, 
Darkness encompasses my soul. 

I used to live in the kingdom, 
Had the best of everything, 
Anything and whatever I needed, 
A snap of my fingers would bring.

Although I wasn’t the number one guy, 
For sure I was definitely number three, 
Were ranked slightly ahead of me.

Wait a minute, what is this, and I don’t understand? 
Just what is that from his rib you have made? 
I thought the two of us were on the same page? 

Well, I simply refuse to be pushed back to number five, 
Let’s see how long in the garden they can stay alive, 
Who said the apple you are not allowed to eat? 
So red, so ripe, so juicy and most of all it’s sweet.

He never should have created two to take the place of me, 

I am the great one known as Satan, 
I even have my own legion of angels, 
I will bet I am just as powerful as He.

Hey, just what do think you are doing? 
This simply cannot be done to me, 
How dare you banish the angels, 
Who practice and believe in my philosophy. 

This is the beginning and certainly not the end, 
You’ll regret the day I stopped being Your friend, 
I will wreak havoc, hate, murder & jealousy to all men, 

Of course we can only imagine exactly what went on, 
So whatever happened or however it went wrong, 
This scenario is played out in many a play and song, 
Certainly we will soon find out because it won’t be long.

Hell was originally designed to fit the devil and his crew, 
Satan is good at filling our minds with unscrupulous doubt, 

I am shut out of mine own heart
because my love is far from me,
nor in the wonders have I part
that fill its hidden empery:

the wildwood of adventurous thought
and lands of dawn my dream had won,
the riches out of Faery brought
are buried with our bridal sun.

And I am in a narrow place,
and all its little streets are cold,
because the absence of her face
has robb'd the sullen air of gold.

My home is in a broader day:
at times I catch it glistening
thro' the dull gate, a flower'd play
and odour of undying spring:

the long days that I lived alone,
sweet madness of the springs I miss'd,
are shed beyond, and thro' them blown
clear laughter, and my lips are kiss'd:

- and here, from mine own joy apart,
I wait the turning of the key: -
I am shut out of mine own heart
because my love is far from me


I am sinful, not trying to be saint, 

Just want to live, not to complain.

 

I am a woman with a feminine beauty, 

Just want to love, not to be snooty.

 


But with an open soul say what I mean.

 

Down on earth I am, not in paradise

I get what I give, this I well realize.

 

I see the richness in the sun and the rain

Don't like pittance, truth is the main.

 

Avoiding a scam, I am going my way, 

I am as I am and as such I will stay.

 



' i am ' sky
my colors are my moods
' i am' light blue when i'm at peace
' i am ' dark blue when i'm troubled
' i am ' dark clouds when i cry for justice
' i am ' light clouds when i'm in thought
    the stars are my teeth in a smile
with the universe.
   the lightning bolts is my anger in full fury.
the heavy rains are my tears.
 
the light rains is my contentment
of a new birth.
   the rainbows is my heart at rest.

' i am' SKY. 

I am so loyal to him within my heart-
But he's disloyal to me, with his others; 
With anyone disdainful, them of me, 
He feels quite free to treat me, as a bother.

I have never given my heart lightly away-
And to find I've been in error, all these years
Is become a tremendous, grievous pain inside me; 
The source of many hidden, disgraced tears.

I have no where to go, as he's too wise; 
Far wiser than I am, and so I stay-
But he should not be too surprised to find, 
That I will have gone missing, some bright day.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Streams of  apologies 
Runs through my heart
The tears of regret 
Are wetting my face
Bitterness fills my plate
Guilt makes my heart break
Because I am wrong
Humble are my words
I'm a humble man
My heart has cried
One hundred  times
Forgive me please
A Hundred pardons
For the hundredth time
Please, I am sorry.


Sorry is the only word that comes from my heart today
For any hurting words or  any misunderstandings
From my heart I can never curse any one
As I have only love and respect for you all.
I remember we had a great time together.
But today you feel  I have changed a lot
Today you feel my ego speaking in my words.
May be you are right in judging me.
Never ever I thought a day 
Will come like this in my entire life.
Still I remember all those days
Where you shared my pain and joys.
I don't know today whether I am
There in you heart or I am 
In your hatred words.
Like everyday morning sunlight
Each of you are there in my heart.
I can never forget anyone of you
As your each words of respect, love and courage 
Still rules my heart.
Sorry, is the word Comes from my heart.
I never ever did anything to rise to any popularity level.
Only My love for writing poems brought  me here.
My many poems were purely
My imagination, not meant especially for anyone.
And brought a misunderstanding in you.
Which I realized it too late.
So today, you are too far away from me.
Yes, I do recollect your each words of
Encouragement did made me to come up 
With new poems.
I want to thank each one of you
For your sincere comments and valuable suggestion did bring
a change in my writings a lot.
I appreciate every one of you.
To lend a encouraging words to
Each new comer, whoever come
On your way.
Yes, you all did a lot for me
Which I will never forget.
Thank you for all the words
That came sincerely from your heart for me, once.
Thanks a lot! 


For the time being, I wont be coming with new poems
Nor I may be able to comment on your poems.
Thanks a lot! 



You gave me so much, 
But I gave you nothing but pain.
You gave me the freedom I yearned, 
But in return I bind you in chains.
You gave me the identity, 
But I took that from you.
You gave me a place I could call home, 
But I left you scared, deserted and alone.
Oh! I am so sorry Pakistan, 
Forgive me for burning you alive.
Forgive me for letting you down, 
Forgive me for all the times a finger was pointed at you.
Forgive me for being silent at times when I had to stand for up for you.
Forgive me for giving you the recognition of a terrorist country, 
Forgive me for making you the charity box.
There is so much to say, 
And so much to apologize for
.
If you cut my veins, I bleed Pakistan, 
I ache when you ache, Pakistan, 
I am because of you, Pakistan.

I am not flesh
I am not bone
I can not be burnt
I can not be dived
I am free from pains and pleasures
Body of a creature is dead
without my existence
i am to operate the body
with power of all cosmic forces
i have no shape
i am free from all bondage
i am the part of super soul
pervaded over the nature
because i am nature


Life looks so hard with out you

All those emotions are stuck in my head..
I couldn find words anywhere to express..
NO one around me seems to understand, 

It looks so simple and pass time  for others
to hear my story
But to me.  .

I'm ALL STUCK

All I want is for someone to hole my hand, 
Just a simple hug is all that I am longing for..

When will the day come, tat will make me 
totally free from those dark days? ? ? ? 

My happy moments with you are 
becoming fewer..

I only wish with all of my might. 
That I won't cry myself to sleep tonite. 

Missing you.. 

I know you are powerful
By your command I rise
I am sun with rays more
To light humanity I come
I know you support me
Moon borrows light sure
To do the same task here
Moon follows my path
While I take rest at night
To light another side I dream
In reality moon lights
Calmness blooms at night, 
While day darkness passes
I rise again in your sky
I swim with light wings
From East to West I reach
Birds sing and welcome
Twice they do this duty
I feel this prayer and sing
Before you I too bow twice
Oh dear super power you feel
You know everything I tell
I am sun rising in your sky
By grace you have gifted me. 

I am the soul, 
I am immortal, 
But I am dependent on a mortal body, 
Whenever I wish to do something, 
I have to use my hands, 
Whenever I want to look at something, 
I have to use my eyes, 
Whenever I want to smell something, 
I have to use my nose, 
Whenever I want to listen to, 
I have to use my ears, 
Whenever I want to think, 
I have to use my brain, 
All these are electromagnetic impulses, 
These impulses touch me, 
And I rebound it to the body, 
The body then feels pleasures and pains, 
That is why I created mirrors, 
These mirrors reflect my virtual image, 
Immortality depends on the mortality. 

Behind the movies scenes, behind the protagonist's smiles, 
Beneath the orchestra's strings, back of the ticket booths, 
There is a message found in all of this; 
That this is the now, and you are here alive, 
As alive as anything that ever lived, 
Furthermore, this is not a dream; 
Though if it were, it would be the most wonderful dream imaginable, 
Even though it's impossibly, unbelievably true, 
And you want to keep on having it-
This dream- for as long as you can, 
Because being alive is such a splendid
Once-in-a-lifetime, first-run, no-repeat event; 
It's worth everything it has ever cost you or anybody else, 
Because you're now one of the wealthiest creatures on the planet-
In all your improbable aliveness. 

Sometimes a mortal feels in himself Nature 
-- not his Father but his Mother stirs 
within him, and he becomes immortal with her
immortality. From time to time she claims 
kindredship with us, and some globule 
from her veins steals up into our own.

I am the autumnal sun,
With autumn gales my race is run;
When will the hazel put forth its flowers,
Or the grape ripen under my bowers?
When will the harvest or the hunter's moon
Turn my midnight into mid-noon?
I am all sere and yellow,
And to my core mellow.
The mast is dropping within my woods,
The winter is lurking within my moods,
And the rustling of the withered leaf
Is the constant music of my grief.  

I am my own church, and own religion; 
I worship whatever I must.
I worship what no other man could fathom-
Because it is my own, and no one else's.

I order myself to, 
I order myself fro, 
All day long; every day, day by day: 
A soldier would be as proud.

Even if it is all delusion.
At least it is my delusion, 
No other body may lay claim upon it.
I run this body, and not one can make it breathe, 
or move, or turn this way or that, as I do.

I am the body of my own invention. 

Ocean of my memory 
Turbulent and violent 
I  bob at its surface 
Feeling a force buoyant


The thread, the strands 
The beginning the ends 
The moments, the spur 
Clarity and the blur 
The ecstasy the fun 
The limp the run
The vacuum that once 
Filled the urn

Endless debates 
To be or not 
To do or to leave  
The tasks those were rough 
The decisions that seemed tough
So much to be done  
For life, you never know 
May not offer a chance 
Another one 

So I took them all 
And finished 

To the end 
Straightened the road 
With my tools
Wherever I saw a silly bend
Larger than life uncertainty
Then morphed into 
A well planned destiny 


Then one day down the street 
I saw her smiling, at me 
Bringing in oodles, 
Much awaited glee-
Radiance of her face 
Unmistakable grace 
Lady luck, a date with her 
My actions had struck

I am the destiny 
I am the fun 
I am the decision and indecision
The exasperation and coercion 
I am the bridge between them


I am, 
Loving father, 
Forgiving  incarnate, 
The most merciful and benevolent 
The alpha and the omega 
Austere  but compassionate 

I play ball with time 
on playground of universe 
And display fireworks 
amidst colorful galaxies 
Lo! Blazing sun my heater 
Ah! soothing moon my cooler 

My breakfast is stars 
which I dip in tasty milky ways 
My chariot 
rainbow hued 
variegated sun rays 

Rings of Saturn 
adorn my svelte fingers 
With Mar’s redness my 
my cheek blushes 

Venus is my honeymoon house 
Wherein I holiday with my nature-spouse 
I sleep in clandestine dark holes 
and wake up in bright supernovas 

I travel on  truculent storms of Jupiter 
And clap in sound of thunderstorms 
Lightning flash from my eyes 
When I stare from angry skies 

Earth is my live theatre 
Wherein plays my human actors 
I am reticent director 
I am thesauraus script writer 
I AM HEI am the Fat Girl
                 the one that everyone hates, 
                      holds in contempt

                         makes fun of
          the one who has Jenny Craig dreams of being thin; 

                 who learns to hate her self

                      because of cupcakes; 

                  who can walk pass ice cream
                     and gain five pounds

                    whose parents are thin

         while telling me I just have to watch my calories

                  I am the one who is mean

                          and retaliates

                      by spreading rumors

               that the pretty girls are lesbian

                           or whores

                     or that they take drugs.

                           That is me;  
            the last chosen in gym class for the team

                      The object of fat jokes; 

             The one who is watched in the cafeteria

                    to see what I am eating

               who has to sit and see the small girls

                      eat whatever they want
          who has to declare that she doesn't like chocolate    

                the one who can never go to the beach

                           to pool parties
                      never find clothes that fit; 
                           wearing sheets; 

                     who can't neck with thin boys

                    who can never touch down there

                       because I hate myself  so

                 who has to watch TV after TV  show
                               which show
                                   that

            fat people are the most hated people in the world
                           and contemptible; 

            no one ever says anything good about the 'fatties'

                    they make fun of you to your face

                or speak with patronizing sentences
                        or offer dieting tips

                   and false statements of support.

             Even your thin parents think you eat too much

                      will never get married
                   and secretly give up on you.

                 If the parents are fat like you

                 they don't want to go out anywhere

                 because fat draws attention

                            to them

                         at the movies. 

                      In the restaurant; 

                            Fat is bad

                   You are told horror stories: 
                   that you will get diabetes

                that you will die of heart failure
            that your babies will have complications

                  that you really are worthless

                     and might as well die.

                          That is fat.

                           And worse

                       no one understands

                    or even want to understand; 
                      fat is the new leper

                           repulsive

                       even as they smile

                           in your face
                     while secretly believing

                    that it is all your fault
                        and it never stops.

                    I see the women over forty

                  crazed over their fat arms
                        their weight gains
                   their cottage cheese thighs.
                       Some of them will

                    finally understand fat.

                  I got a boyfriend after college

                  from Asia where fat is beautiful
                         yes fat is beautiful
                    in many parts of the world, 
                         a sign of wealth
                   but he was a woman beater
            and I had to walk away from the relationship

                    marrying my present husband
                      who is fatter than I am.

                 Now we go to the ice cream store

                     suck the ice-cream cones

                            our fingers

                        licking Dorito dust

                            both of us

                         having given up

                        Thanks everyone; 

                             fat it seems
                                is 
                              forever. 

I Am The Illuminati 

I am that force you can't fight back

I am that full scale, all out attack

I am your culture's utter doom

I am driving your children to your tomb

With every dollar I'm chasing cheese

With every vote I whimper, a feeble, pathetic please

With every war my kids believe

With the way I worship god

Following after every every political fraud

It's allowing kings to reign

For States to sanction pain

And militaries to remain

I am the Illuminati 

And there ain't  nothing that can stop me






I remember scenes as if from some old movie, 
Voices calling, as though across a void; 
Things forgotten, through the glass most darkly-
As though some giant, with my brain had toyed.

The past lives on in places now quite hidden; 
The dying man, whose life through his mind whirled-
Those days come back to haunt, mostly unbidden: 
My parts of them, still living in this world. 

I am the little raindrop
That now has seen the sea
Though once it thought itself
The world of water, be

The surface tension grew
Until it burst it's skin
And, falling on the wave
It heard a growing din

It thought the sea a whole
A solid thing, that roll
To crush the little drop
Beneath it's giant bowl

But just before it fell
The little dropp woke up
And saw the shining faces
In the splashes, spraying up

The other drops did play
In the water's mighty hand
And from sea to farthest sea
Did the water's smile expand

Until horizon's bloomed
Upon some sunny shore
Where the little raindropp rose
Into the sky once more. 

I am one of those who likes to live, 
to be a friend and to forgive.
I am one of those who hates a lie, 
if it were for me a war I would deny.
I am one of those who likes to dream, 
if to play games then in a family team.
I am one of those who likes to sing
and listen to the bells ring.
I am one of those who likes to laugh, 
the time with my dear ones is not enough.
I am one of those who likes fairy tales
and I know that even a hero sometimes fails.
to prolong my days
so that to look for the new ways.
I am one of those who tries to find the door 
leading to more happiness, 
I always try to avoid loneliness.
I am one of those who likes to give, 
I am one of those who likes to live.

No tongue would ask no eye would mourn
I never caused a thought of gloom
A smile of joy since I was born 

In secret pleasure - secret tears
This changeful life has slipped away
As friendless after eighteen years
As lone as on my natal day 

There have been times I cannot hide
There have been times when this was drear
When my sad soul forgot its pride
And longed for one to love me here 

But those were in the early glow
Of feelings since subdued by care
And they have died so long ago
I hardly now believe they were 

First melted off the hope of youth
Then Fancy's rainbow fast withdrew
And then experience told me truth
In mortal bosoms never grew 

'Twas grief enough to think mankind
All hollow servile insincere -
But worse to trust to my own mind
And find the same corruption there


I am the only

On the sleeting road
Spit Karunka   squid spittle 
I am the only


I am the one outside the group
outside the circle
the one who fell through
the holes in the net
The stranger
the outsider
I came close
and you said come closer; 
and I made every effort -
eager, naïve and persistent -
but you had sophistication; 
you always have sophistication; 
and you played with me; 
you needed bodies and responses
to fill in forms and information
and your Bureau of Statistics
and  I was there - guided, directed
and you knew
all the while, 
I was the stranger, the outsider
And you whispered to one another
while your smooth talk was practiced and distinct
I was the stranger, am the outsider
which you knew all the while
which I only saw late in the hour
and so I live now at the borders, at the periphery
and now when we walk past each other
we gaze at each other with caution
with careful disregard


I am the Reaper.  
 All things with heedful hook  
Silent I gather.  
Pale roses touched with the spring,  
Tall corn in summer,          
Fruits rich with autumn, and frail winter blossoms—  
Reaping, still reaping—  
All things with heedful hook  
Timely I gather.  
 
I am the Sower.         
All the unbodied life  
Runs through my seed-sheet.  
Atom with atom wed,  
Each quickening the other,  
Fall through my hands, ever changing, still changeless.         
Ceaselessly sowing,  
Life, incorruptible life,  
Flows from my seed-sheet.  
 
Maker and breaker,  
I am the ebb and the flood,         
Here and Hereafter,  
Sped through the tangle and coil  
Of infinite nature,  
Viewless and soundless I fashion all being.  
Taker and giver,         
I am the womb and the grave,  
The Now and the Ever


I am black, white, yellow and brown. 
I am a quadruped, biped and a triped.
I am physically and mentally challenged.
I am beautiful, adventurous and fierce.
I am afraid, fearless, good and evil.
I am love, estranged and indifferent.
I am a believer.
I am hope.
I am different, but I am the same. 

i am the hoodie you pass on the street
i am the one you dread to meet
i am the one in the park 
i am the one who stands outside in the dark
i am the one who stands in a gang
i am the one you look at when you hear a bang
i am the drunken youth
i am the binge drinking culture thats so uncouth
i am the thing you detest
while i sit here distressed
about all the exams i have to complete
and all the sport events in which i have to compete
but all you see is my hooded disposition
i am the one stood out side your local shop
i am your next local cop

I am very bothered when I think
of the bad things I have done in my life.
Not least that time in the chemistry lab
when I held a pair of scissors by the blades
and played the handles
in the naked lilac flame of the Bunsen burner;
then called your name, and handed them over. 

O the unrivalled stench of branded skin
as you slipped your thumb and middle finger in,
then couldn't shake off the two burning rings. Marked,
the doctor said, for eternity.

Don't believe me, please, if I say
that was just my butterfingered way, at thirteen,
of asking you if you would marry me. 

I am very still
But not the world around me

This land quivers, 
Teeming with unseen life

I am very still
The clouds tumble past

Each cloud white
Against the bright azure sky

I am very still
The lark on the grass sings

The birds fly
Taking to the air with joy

I am very still
Upon this lush prairie land

With the wind
Whispering through the grass


I had just won $from the headshakers and 
was naked upon my bed 
listening to an opera by one of the Italians 
and had just gotten rid of a very loose lady 
when there was a knock upon the wood, 
and since the cops had just raided a month or so ago, 
I screamed out rather on edge— 
who the hell is it? what you want, man? 
I’m your publisher! somebody screamed back, 
and I hollered, I don’t have a publisher, 
try the place next door, and he screamed back, 
peeked through the iron grill to make sure it wasn’t a cop, 
and I placed a robe upon my nakedness, 
kicked a beercan out of the way and bade them enter, 
an editor and a poet. 
only one would drink a beer (the editor) 
so I drank two for the poet and one for myself 
and they sat there sweating and watching me 
and I sat there trying to explain 
that I wasn’t really a poet in the ordinary sense, 
I told them about the stockyards and the slaughterhouse 
and the racetracks and the conditions of some of our jails, 
and the editor suddenly pulled five magazines out of a portfolio 
and tossed them in between the beercans 
and we talked about Flowers of Evil, Rimbaud, Villon, 
and what some of the modern poets looked like: 
J. 

B. May and Wolf the Hedley are very immaculate, clean fingernails, etc.; 
I apologized for the beercans, my beard, and everything on the floor 
and pretty soon everybody was yawning 
and the editor suddenly stood up and I said, 
are you leaving? 
and then the editor and the poet were walking out the door, 
and then I thought well hell they might not have liked 
what they saw 
but I’m not selling beercans and Italian opera and 
torn stockings under the bed and dirty fingernails, 
I’m selling rhyme and life and line, 
and I walked over and cracked a new can of beer 
and I looked at the five magazines with my name on the cover 
and wondered what it meant, 
wondered if we are writing poetry or all huddling in 
one big tent 
clasping assholes.

Many bright days have ended in the nights, 
Many moon lights have ended in sun lights, 
I am still waiting, I have no alternate, 
Hope you'll come you are always late, 
Your face I see in the lovely full moon, 
Sitting at the bank since early afternoon, 
Aroma of your love I carry with me, 
Springs have gone now an autumn I see, 
Your house boat now inhabited by rats, 
Don't go inside but I see the bats, 
Come out during nights and look at me, 
As if they say a stranger they see, 
The spiders have knitted a web inside, 
Is it for me, a groom-less bride? 
A web knitted by the human spiders, 
That captures the amateur riders, 
It's easy to go, difficult to come back, 
It's swamp of terror, that can hack, 
To paradise it leads or to the hell, 
Who knows it and who can tell? 
May be in paradise but I'm in a hell, 
That's the truth certainly I can tell, 
Wish could know you are sleeping in me, 
Day by day you are creeping in me, 
One that shares breaths-in and out, 
I am just waiting for his sprout, 
 You went on the bank that is other side, 
I cannot swim and I cannot glide, 
Giving you in the arms of your mother once again
I shall go inside with tears and pain, 
I am a weak woman can't cut my throat, 
I can make a hole in the bottom of the boat, 
Can row the boat to the bank other side, 
River is a river not an ocean of tide, 
 If it is sunk, we shall meet somewhere, 
Paradise or hell any place anywhere, 
I know the risk I may be shot dead, 
My story will be written and widely read, 
Shall make an attempt to get you out of the swamp, 
That's all I can do, to get rid of the cramp, 
I am a woman having cleared many tests, 
Have tears in my eyes and milk in the breasts, 
Humanity I create in elastic womb, 
Being over-raged I can built a tomb, 
My milk gives life my tears a flood, 
Beware of the fire I have in the blood, 
I shall bury the terror alive in the tomb, 
The helpless insect of a woman's womb! 
Determined and firm not a mental slave, 
Doomsday I may bring when I am brave! 




I see what I wish to see.  
Only the light within me 

I hear what I wish to hear.  
Only the music within me  

I smell what I wish to smell.  
Only the success within me  

I taste what I wish to taste.  
Only kindness within me 

I touch what I wish to feel.  
Only love within me


I am what I am.  

I see what I wish to see.  
Only the light within me 

I hear what I wish to hear.  
Only the music within me  

I smell what I wish to smell.  
Only the success within me  

I taste what I wish to taste.  
Only kindness within me 

I touch what I wish to feel.  
Only love within me


Descended from the very first man
And lasting until the end of time.

I may be short on the outside, 
But on the inside, I am a surprise package, 
Full of the strength of ten, 
A Superman, 
Able to leap tall buildings 
In a single bound, 
A Paul Bunyan hero, 
Striding through the forest of life! 

A spider has nothing on me, 
For I, too, spin my webs! 
Webs which hold those I love
Tightly to my heart.
I am like a Venus Flytrap, 
Keeping close to myself
All that is mine.

I am a cream colored opal, 
Sparkling fire in all directions.  
Silver haired, 
And wise in my age, 
I go striding through life, 
Hurrying to my next adventure.




February if we defended rose and woman
and the mighty verse . 
and the blueness of sky . 
A dominion .. nothing left therein. 
No water, no air ..
No tent, no camel,
and not even dark Arabica coffee!!

We are accused of terrorism:
if we defended with guts
the hair of Balqis
and the lips of Maysun
if we defended Hind, and Da`d
Lubna and Rabab ..
and the stream of Kohl
coming down from their lashes like the verses of revelation.
You will not find with me
a secret poem
or a secret logos
or books I put behind doors.
I do not even have one poem
walking down the street, wearing veil.

We are accused of terrorism:
if we wrote about the ruins of a homeland
torn, weak . 
a homeland with no address
and an nation with no names

I seek the remnants of a homeland
none of its grand poems is left
except the bemoans of Khansa.

I seek a dominion in whose horizons
no freedom can be found
red .. blue or yellow.

A homeland forbidding us from bying a newspaper
or listening to the news.
A dominion wherein birds are forbidden
from chirping.
A homeland wherein, out of terror [ru`b],
its writers got accustomed to write about
nothing.
A homeland, in the likeness of poetry in our lands:
It is vain talk,
no rhythm,
imported
Ajam, with a crooked face and tongue:
No beginning
No end
No relation with people's worry
mother earth
and the crisis of man.

A dominion . 
going to peace talks
with no honor
no shoe.

A homeland,
men peed in their pans ..
women are those left to defend honor.

Salt in our eyes
Salt in our lips
Salt in our words
Can the self carry such dryness?
An inheritance we got from the barren Qahtan?
In our nation, no Mu`awiya, and no Abu Sufiyan
No one is left to say 'NO'
and face the quitters
they gave up our houses, our bread and our [olive] oil.
They transformed our bright history into a mediocre store.

In our lives, no poem is left,
since we lost our chastity in the bed of the Sultan.

They got accustomed to us, the humbled.
What is left to man
when all that remains
is disgrace.

I seek in the books of history
Ussamah ibn al-Munqith
Uqba ibn Nafi`
Omar, and Hamzah
and Khalid, driving his flocks conquering the Shem.
I seek a Mu`tasim Billah
Saving women from the cruelty of rape
and the fire.

I seek latter days men
All I can see is frightened cats
Scared for their own souls, from
the sultanship of mice.

Is this an overwhelming national blindness?
Are we blind to colors?

We are accused of terrorism
If we refuse to die
with Israel's bulldozers
tearing our land
tearing our history
tearing our Evangelium
tearing our Koran
tearing the graves of our prophets
If this was our sin,
then, lo, how beautiful terrorism is?

We are accused of terrorism
if we refused to be effaced
by the hands of the Mogul, Jews and Barbarians
if we throw a stone
at the glass of the the Security Council
after the Ceasar of Ceasars got a hold of it.

We are accused of terrorism
if we refuse to negociate with the wolf
and shake the hand with a whore
America
Against the cultures of the peoples
with no culture
Against the civilizations of the civilized
with no civilization
America
a mighty edifice
with no walls!

We are accused of terrorism:
if we refused an era
America became
the foolish, the rich, the mighty
translated, sworn
in Hebrew.

We are accused of terrorism:
if we throw a rose
to Jerusalem
to al-Khalil
to Ghazza
to an-Nasirah
if we took bread and water
to beleaguered Troy.

We are accused of terrorism:
if we raised our voices against
the regionalists of our leaders.
All changed their rides:
from Unionists
to Brokers.

If we committed the heinous crime of culture
if we revolted against the orders of the grand caliph
and the seat of the caliphate
If we read jurisprudence or politics
and read verse al-Fat-h
[that Chapter of Conquest].
If we listened to the Friday sermon
then we are well-established in the art of terrorism

We are accused of terrorism
if we defended land
and the honor of dust
if we revolted against the rape of people
and our rape
if we defended the last palm trees in our desert
the last stars in our sky
the last syllabi of our names
the last milk in our mothers' bosoms
if this was our sin
how beautiful is terrorism.

I am with terrorism
if it is able to save me
from the immigrants from Russia
Romania, Hungaria, and Poland

They settled in Palestine
set foot on our shoulders
to steal the minarets of al-Quds
and the door of Aqsa
to steal the arabesques
and the domes.

I am with terrorism
and the virgin, Meriam Betula
and the holy city
from the ambassadors of death and desolation

Yesteryear
The nationalist street was fervent
like a wild horse.
The rivers were abundant with the spirit of youth.

But after Olso,
we no longer had teeth:
we are now a blind and lost people.

We are accused of terrorism:
if we defended with full-force
our poetic heritage
our national wall
our rosy civilization
the culture of flutes in our mountains
and the mirrors displaying blackened eyes.

We are accused of terrorism:
if we defended what we wrote
El azure of our sea
and the aroma of ink
if we defended the freedom of the word
and the holiness of books

I am with terrorism
if it is able to free a people
from tyrants and tyranny
if it is able to save man from the cruelty of man
to return lemon, olive tree, and bird to the South of Lebanon
and the smile back to Golan

I am with terrorism
if it will save me
from the Caesar of Yehuda
and the Caesar of Rome

I am with terrorism
as long as this new world order
is shared
between America and Israel
half-half

I am with terrorism
with all my words
and all my teeth
as long as this new world
is in the hands of a butcher.

I am with terrorism
if the U. 

S. Senate
enacts judgment
decrees reward and punishment

I am with Irhab [terrorism]
as long this new world order
hates the smell of A`rab.

I am with terrorism
as long as the new world order
wants to slaughter my off-spring.
and send them to dogs.

For all this
I raise my voice high:
I am with terrorism
I am with terrorism
I am with terrorism


I am your baby Mum.
I did not come on my own Mum.
from the mighty heavens
and placed me in your holy womb.

I did not come on my own mum; 

I was so happy in my new cave of love, 
in your holy womb
and slept there peacefully.
The angles watched.
They prayed 
to keep me safe always
till I will be born on the face of the earth.

They practiced heavenly songs of birth
to play on their golden harps on my birthday.

When I was sleeping in your womb
The angels used to come to me.
You did not know it, my dearest Mum.

I was happy to be born
as your beloved  child.

I wanted to smile
I wanted to sing
I wanted to play
I wanted to suck your breast milk
Until you were satisfied.
I wanted to see the smile on your face
When I suck all your milk from your loving breasts.

 They were my dreams in your womb, Mum.

But on a cruel day
you decided to kill me.


The devils in the Hades
heard about your decision.
They brought the loudest drum, 
played in the devilish rhythms.
All the devils came together, 
came and danced in circles, 
jumping and singing.
They danced in lines.
They danced in circles.
They danced on the toes.
They danced on their heads.
They sang the wildest of songs
and the devil drummers played.
The whole hell was happy
that you decided to kill me.



You know how much I cried? 
You know how many angels cried? 
Do you know how the whole heaven cried
on my day of death in your holy womb? 

A moment before i was cruelly murdered

I am your hiding angel
May i stay in your heart 
as an angel undercover
I am your hiding angel.
No one knows that I am here.

When you cry I will feel your pain.
When it is dark in your heart
I shall bring little twinkling stars.

When tears flow down your cheek
I will come unseen to wipe your tears.

I shall invite the nightingales 
to sing and make you happy.

I shall sing in your ears
a sweet lullaby
when the nightingales go to sleep.

And when you sleep
I shall kiss your sweet lips
until you dream of flowers
birds, skies and heavenly beings.

I am the angel of harmony.
I want to hide inside you.




My beloved is verse
I am short-fiction

She is novel
I am play

She is drama
I am dialogue

She is memoirs
I am travelogue

She is autobiography
I am prose

She is article 
I am essay

She is epic
I am monologue

We are together
Like verse and poet
Like literature and writer
Like language and alphabet
Like sentence and structure

Like disciple and teacher
Like sense and word


As I walk along the beach of sorrow
a tiny bird flew above my morrow, 
the only thing's left and done
a lone footstep marked on the ground.
As I see the sunlight drew it limits
a tiny bird sang above its own zenith, 
the only thing's left and shown
a lone footstep she marked on the ground.
Ah, this tiny bird hark like an eagle, 
she blew a gaggled horn unscored; 
it wiggled her feathers unfurled
she spread out her even wings cold.
Now, I have only one thing to reckon, 
in my own lovely world of imagination, 
the only thing's left for me is gone
inside a heart's hidden comprehension! 
Now, I see no more than world's frictions, 
my mind travels above certain wanderings
as the desert of woes called illusions
forgone's well in my own confusions!


   I approach, and I withdraw:
who but I could find
absence in the eyes,
presence in what's far?

   From the scorn of Phyllis,
now, alas, I must depart.
One is indeed unhappy
who misses even scorn!

   So caring is my love
that my present distress
minds hard-heartedness less
than the thought of its loss.

   Leaving, I lose more
than what is merely mine:
in Phyllis, never mine,
I lose what can't be lost.

   Oh, pity the poor person
who aroused such kind disdain
that to avoid giving pain,
it would grant no favor!

   For, seeing in my future
obligatory exile,
she disdained me the more,
that the loss might be less.

   Oh, where did you discover
so neat a tactic, Phyllis:
denying to disdain
the garb of affection?

   To live unobserved
by your eyes, I now go
where never pain of mine
need flatter your disdain. 

I arise from dreams of thee 
In the first sweet sleep of night, 
When the winds are breathing low, 
And the stars are shining bright 
I arise from dreams of thee, 
And a spirit in my feet 
Has led me -  who knows how? -  
To thy chamber-window, sweet! 

The wandering airs they faint 
On the dark, the silent stream, -  
The champak odors fall 
Like sweet thoughts in a dream, 
The nightingale's complaint, 
It dies upon her heart, 
As I must die on thine, 
O, beloved as thou art! 

O, lift me from the grass! 
I die, I faint, I fall! 
Let thy love in kisses rain 
On my lips and eyelids pale, 
My cheek is cold and white, alas! 
My Heart beats loud and fast 
Oh! press it close to thine again, 
Where it will break at last

She begins, and my grandmother joins her. 
Mother and daughter sing like young girls. 
If my father were alive, he would play 
his accordion and sway like a boat. 

I've never been in Peking, or the Summer Palace, 
nor stood on the great Stone Boat to watch 
the rain begin on Kuen Ming Lake, the picnickers 
running away in the grass. 

But I love to hear it sung; 
how the waterlilies fill with rain until 
they overturn, spilling water into water, 
then rock back, and fill with more, 

Both women have begun to cry. 
But neither stops her song. 

What scene would I want to be enveloped in
more than this one,
an ordinary night at the kitchen table,
floral wallpaper pressing in,
white cabinets full of glass,
the telephone silent,
a pen tilted back in my hand?

It gives me time to think
about all that is going on outside--
leaves gathering in corners,
lichen greening the high grey rocks,
while over the dunes the world sails on,
huge, ocean-going, history bubbling in its wake.

But beyond this table
there is nothing that I need,
not even a job that would allow me to row to work,
or a coffee-colored Aston Martin DBwith cracked green leather seats.

No, it's all here,
the clear ovals of a glass of water,
a small crate of oranges, a book on Stalin,
not to mention the odd snarling fish
in a frame on the wall,
and the way these three candles--
each a different height--
are singing in perfect harmony.

So forgive me
if I lower my head now and listen
to the short bass candle as he takes a solo
while my heart
thrums under my shirt--
frog at the edge of a pond--
and my thoughts fly off to a province
made of one enormous sky
and about a million empty branches. 

I asked the little angel to sing
There is a little angel in my heart
always playful and gay.

I asked the little angel to sing.
Then playfully she flew to flowers
and birds and bees
and all those beautiful creations.

Then she flew to me, 
sat on my nose
looked into my shining eyes
and sang a beautiful song.

For a moment I was lost
in ecstatic moods
and my heart jumped 
in joy and knew for myself
the beauty of my soul.


Swans dance on the ripping waves. 
Wing and wing, 
as tempest blows temperature south, 
Leaves change form green to red. 
For not long the leaves wither and fade. 
Soon the snow will kiss the moss. 
passing seasons, are not lost
When all the while white, 
delightful, feather's of white fill my heart, 
at last the wait was worth it.
For spring has released the song birds, 
Now my heart is light free as a wing of a swan
for winter has released us, 
once again. 

and touch her hand 
lifting unspoken words 
from beneath her pillow


he accelerator pedal jammed. I couldn't ease up a bit on it, and. . 
as the curve ahead would not straighten for me, . .. 

the tree I hit. 
The pain flashed through my body, and 'thank god', I did pass out. 
I ended up with a concussion, three broken ribs, and one broken snout. 

The first thing I recall after awakening, were lights shining from above. 
Would I soon be staring at an angel? One wearing wings like a dove? 
Or would I find myself confronted by the dreaded  instead of  
To my GREAT surprise I faced a lawyer, with contract-in-hand-to-sign.
 

The temple of body
Lay in ruins rocked by disease; 
The innermost shrine 
Lay ravaged, piece by piece.
This evangelic devotee
Who worshiped his brethren
Writhing in pain, 
Could his devotion
Never restrain.
He took up the task
With courage.
So the temple stood again
Open to pilgrimage.
Its facade now 
A little disfigured lay; 
A few pillars now
Stood in disarray; 
Still the shrine was now
Restored its lost glory
For this inspired devotee
Knew that the soul
And not the body
Was what was more precious
And holy.
He always treated 
The wounds outside
But took more care 
To heal the wounds inside.
Took more care
To feel and heal
The feelings beaten
The feelings frozen
The feelings stolen. 

when I open up and trust 
will create goodness and harmony
through who and how I am.




I beg her for forgiveness, for what I did (when she wasn’t lookin’) .
I beg her for forgiveness, or I won’t get, tonight, home cookin’.

I beg her for forgiveness, though my wrongs are ONLY.. in her mind.
I beg her for forgiveness,
or another home I’ll have to find.




The new day is hope 
The beginning is wonder
Life starts again each morning
I begin the day with a blessing
Wonder upon wonder upon wonder
Light and more light 
I am beginning again today 
Long long is my dream of today. 

I, being born a woman and distressed 
By all the needs and notions of my kind,
Am urged by your propinquity to find
Your person fair, and feel a certain zest
To bear your body's weight upon my breast:
So subtly is the fume of life designed,
To clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,
And leave me once again undone, possessed.
Think not for this, however, the poor treason
Of my stout blood against my staggering brain,
I shall remember you with love, or season
My scorn wtih pity, -- let me make it plain:
I find this frenzy insufficient reason
For conversation when we meet again. 


I believe that the sun shines after the rain
I believe if you don't get hurt you'll never gain
I believe in not doing things the easy way
I believe that being selfish doesn’t pay

I believe in a second chance
I believe in a life long romance
I believe there is life after death
And standing up to a life of mess

I believe in love at first sight
I believe that revenge isn’t right
I believe that first impressions last
And there is nothing better then a good laugh

I believe that dreams do come true
I believe there's destiny for me and you
I believe that good things come to those who wait
I believe love never arrives too late

I believe something good comes from something bad
I believe that for tears of happiness there are tears of sad
I believe everyone has a guardian angel
And the good you do will be rewarded well

I believe sometimes there is no explanation
I believe money can't buy people's affection
I believe you don't know what you've got until it's gone
I believe a new day arrives with every dawn

I believe a smile can be contagious
I believe in being very outrageous
I believe in living with no regrets
I believe that life is as good as it gets

I believe the little things are worth the fuss
I believe you have each friend for a reason
I believe you will get punished for treason

I believe that what comes first is family
I believe we should all live in harmony
I believe in making the most of a beautiful day
And it's not the end until everything's okay

I believe absence makes the heart grow fonder
I believe you will lose if you sit and wonder
I believe every experience teaches you a lesson
And nothing cures better then a drinking session

I believe everyone has one true love
I believe sometimes we need a little shove
I believe the whole world is a stage 
I believe we only get better with age

I believe that to learn you have to live
I believe that to love someone you have to give
I believe one moment can change your life
And there's still help when you’re in strife

I believe everyone has one true friend
I believe love helps a broken heart mend
I believe in the power of a song
And things will change before too long

I believe living is the best experience
I believe in not laughing at other people’s expense
I believe it’s hard to watch a lover leave
And when they’re gone all you can do is breath

I believe to always look on the bright side
I believe that life is just one big ride
I believe when I die people will grieve
But it’s ok because I believe


When I wake up every morn, 
Its with the awe of jus being alive
 and being with you, 
To reach out for that specialness, 
Which the almighty has bestowed upon me, 
And rouse those around me
 to the potential of each new morn.

I am not afraid to admit, 
That often, I am less than perfect.
Life is nothing but trial and error, 
I believe in my heart
And my powers, 
That something great is about to happen.
This keeps the sun - all time shining, 
 and the Rainbows that  we built together.

With every breath that I take, 
Mystery lies deep within.
Your voice resonating, 
Like seagulls on the shore.
Your wavy essence washes over me, 
Flooding me with emotions.
Tosses me into that special place-
I long to be.

You are the diamonds of my night sky, 
You are the sparkling  crystals of grainy  dust, 
 in the desert of my solitude.
Your serene face draws me to tranquility, 
That’s where I long to belong for eternity.
Yes I believe in miracles, 
All my avenues and possibilities are open., 
And look with hope to the horizon of  today, 
For Today is truly all that I really have.
For the morrow I cannot say.

and my bodies waiting oh so patiently
cuz I believe in you indeed
Is there someone imitating me
bring her back because I'm jealous please
cuz I believe in you indeed
searching deep down trying to find and see
see the life that's right in front of me
cuz I believe in you indeed
find that person that I want to be
find her deep down way inside of me
cuz I believe in you indeed
doesn't take a miracle you'll see
there's that sweet person inside of me just waiting
cuz I believe in you indeed
who's the person that I claim to be
a mere glimpse of the past of me
cuz I believe in you indeed

I BELIEVE IN MY LIFE AGAIN

I believe in my life again
Thank G-d 
I was beginning to lose it
I'm back now
May G-d have mercy on all those who cross the line. 

Young love made promises
It couldn’t keep
But
You were there
Beside me that day; 
To give me away
To my future.    
I believed 
In forever
But you weren’t
As ageless  
As those precious moments
Captured 
In old photographs. 

I BELONG TO A DREAM WHOSE TIME HAS PASSED 

I belong to a Dream whose time has passed-
Even if I realize it in old age
It will not mean that much. 

A hundred billion human beings or more
Have lived and died on this earth
I am just one of them. 

I wanted to be friends but you wanted to be more 
so i gave you what I thought was my all 
But then it was token 
and my heart was broken. 

How could you do this? 
what did i do so wrong? 

You took every moment 
and an left me with you terrible memory's.

do you still think you did the right thing? 
because i still think how wrong i was to let you in my territory
you teared me apart so bad
i was clearly stupid. 

My heart just wouldn't let out! 
i hate you with all my heart missing parts
How could you hurt me so bad
i Dont know what i did to deserve this.

If you ever come back ill walk away just like you did to me, 
 i'll never let someone hurt me as bad as you did. 

- I bet it sucks to be you right now. 

I bet with every Wind that blew
Till Nature in chagrin
Employed a Fact to visit me
And scuttle my Balloon -My arteries have been opened
to  bleed on the altar of heaven.
I kneel there, begging mercy from
the insatiable priestess of love.

She chortles loudly, 
laughing  behind my back, 
leaving an empty gluttony of life
after all the fleshly words are eaten.

I screwed twisted, 
empty words into angry screams.
There are memories of raging pain, 
and our faces awkardly breathe torture.

The greedy lovers hold deep emotion, 
but they are irrevocably alone.
Boundless distinction is requisite and
there is no dimension  to solitude.

The screaming rampage is not open.
All the rage words are inside.
My need is weary but my pen voice will speak
brilliant, delicious words.

For Gina O. and Gregory G. 

I bless you, forests, valleys, fields, mountains, waters,
I bless freedom and blue skies.

I bless my staff and my humble rags.
And the steppe from beginning to end,
And the sun's light, and night's darkness,

And the path I walk, pauper that I am,
And, in the field every blade of grass,
and every star in the sky!

O! if only I could encompass all life,
And join my soul with yours.
O! if only I could embrace you all,
Enemies, friends and brothers, and all nature,
And enfold all nature in my arms

I breathe white.
So do spruce
And Moose
And the Alaskan Highway.

We're all a prayer, 
A white prayer, 
Cool communion with each other, 
And white mountains, 
And white lynx cat-dancing
On a white evening, 
Chasing Halley-comet's tail. 

I buy rags 
and turn them into stars 
Musique is the food of the soul 
I am crazy about musique 
I write poetry 
I write poetry and buy rags 
In exchange for rags I buy musiques 
If also I could be a fish in a bottle of rakı..

I am calling my maiden home
For in a distant land does she roam
There is no distance between us too great
For our meeting is bound by undeniable fate
The love within us has long been awaken
And never will that love ever be forsaken
She shall enter my home into love's sweet embrace
And I will finally be able to gaze upon her face
I await this day with an ever burdened heart
Once she is at my side, never shall we part! 
So I call thee my sweet maiden, I call thee home
I call thee from the distant land of which you roam


You gotta wake up every mornin', tip toe in the
kitchen cook me great T-bone steak
Serve it to me in bed go down the street and hustle
bring me back all the money you make
You gotta rub my body with sweet scented oil, 
cool me with a 'lectric fan
I wanna thank you for that man' 
And I'll call that true love, true and sweet
That ain't the kind of love I'm gettin
but baby that's the kind of love I need 
I wanna come home every evenin' to a great big meal
of wine and roasted pheasant
Say to me 'Shel this is Susy, this is Nell, I brought 'em
both home to you for a present'
Cops bust in and find my stash, you gotta tell 'em
it belongs to you
And when you're sittin' in slam tell all the other
chickies when they get out
They should look me up too 
And I call that true love. (. ) 
Some guy accuses me of foolin' with his wife
and threatens to tear me apart
Points a gun at me, I want you to jump in the middle
and take the bullet in your own heart
And as you're lyin' on the floor and dyin', I want
you to look up at me and say
'Shel I'm sorry I messed up the rug, just roll
my body out of the way' 
And I call that true love,. (. ) 
Movie people call you on the telephone
I want you to turn down the part
And when we're ballin' baby, ride my top
So I never strain my heart 
And I call that true love. (. )I can be
a sparrow
if you promise
not to be
a cage


I can hear the water moving beneath me
I can hear the rush of the waves as they try to eat me
I can hear the wind as it blows around my face
I can hear the dogs barking in a shadowy place
I can hear my mother calling from behind the shore
I can hear my father screaming as he slams the door
I can hear death calling my name
I can hear the devil say he's so happy I came
I can hear the sound of my best friends voice
I can hear the sadness as it leaks through
I can hear someone whisper I love you
I can hear my name being called a billion times
I can hear the sound of water moving as someone drops dimes
I can hear the sound of footsteps as I move forward
I can hear the sound of my breathing as I moved onward
I can hear the sound of my screaming as I fall to the ground
I can hear everyone that gathered around
I can hear as they all start to cry
I can hear my breathing stop as I start to die

I do not share
But how to dare! 
No place to go any where
Single roof and alone to stare

It has good and bad memory 
I feel so sorry 
He left me alone in this room
To feel lonely with gloom 

He used to ask me often  
Will you think of leaving me alone? 
Where am I going after leaving you? 
But I failed to understand and had to pass all these through 

People will come to me with fresh proposals
Force me to speed up with quick disposal 
"We will take care of your son "
Bring him up like gentleman and good person 

They wanted me to marry again
They wanted to see me in no pain 
I too realized it as long way go 
Without man it shall be no easy flow 

Their eyes are piercing me through
But what they tell is also true 
I must have some one in life
As life would be like an edge of knife

It will be certainly nice
To keep his words with promise
That I shall cherish his dream in son 
What else I need in life for reasons! 

I brush all apprehensions
Raise no more questions 
I felt it decisively that I can manage


I can't be thankless
For all other cheerful faces
Who have shared all their feeling? 
Made me feel at home and being

I owe a lot to unknown readers
Who might be playing for me as wonder? 
I know only few of best known 
As they consider me of their own 

I have now whole world to claim
Its people, trust and faith to name
I have breathed their feelings and sentiments
It was pleasant and happiest moment

How do I feel for them at heart? 
I find no appropriate words to start
They have allowed me some space 
To be stationed permanently in any case 

I shall store their words as everlasting
I could have been finished of the scene
Yet they allowed me as player to be seen 

I feel shy to express thanks often and again
It causes me anguish and pain
As if I am purchasing their precious time
They have spared it for me over considerable time ‘

I shall express in poems
That may reach definitely to them 
They are smart enough to pick the signals
Take care of their urgent need for originals


Before me walks this a shadow.
Is it yours.
I can not come to close too say.
Crossing over from where
I know you remain.
Oceans of love, play solarium 
left behind from before.
Even though in believing.
Passing through, 
Deep inside go on believing
and this 
you must, answered feeling.
It pulls 
you so far off
 completely staid away. 

In a certain time
Rise you
And down
As a result
The world is black
And white

World itself adjust
In that
Everything is adjusted
In order to
Rise they
And down

To me the certain time
Is obviously uncertain
When you rise
I set down
Sometimes stagnant 
Silent and hidden

Hasty time insists 
And its world is
Angry with me
I am called mad
Look around you and
I can only smile


You can ask anything of me and I will attempt
You can tell me to smile, when grief is my shadow
You can stick me with pins and require my stillness
Take all my possessions and demand more
You can mandate the improbable and I will comply
But I can promise only this
To do my best


I can see the sun shine
In the distant time of doubt
giving me hope to see 
a light of harmony 

I can feel the rain drop
falling down on me 
as I close my eyes and say 
I thank you for the day 

I can hear the birds sing 
sing a melody 
one that's says I love you 
for all eternity 

My eyes have seen
My ears can hear
the feelings you hide from me
but all I say to you 
Is I'll love you every day


A giraffe, a pelican, 
even a monkey too
wanted their own business; 
not a more unlikely crew.

Cleaning windows up so high
easy for giraffe
with that neck to the sky; 
pelican opened wide for the pay.

But none seemed more fitted 
than the monkey who spitted; 
and created the work along the way. 

I can see you even in dark, 
You did not believe me, 
Come to me in a too dark night, 
Off the lights and hide yourself, 
Anywhere in the house, 
I shall count up to hundred, 
And shall go straight, 
At your hiding place, 
I know your soul.

In complete dark, 
You call any part, 
Of your charming body, 
I shall touch it sweet heart, 
In a single attempt, 
I know your body.

If I fail to do that, 
I shall allow you to kiss, 
My thirsty dry lips, 
But if I succeed, 
You will have to allow, 
To kiss you anywhere, 
That will be my love, 
That will be my choice. 

I can still feel the restless Dakota wind 
Fan the dusty plains and me 
My lips dry till I reached that stream
Where Tully's cabin used to be 
All alone at the end of his long journey
The old man couldn't hardly see
Guitar in hand, we'd walk to the water
And sit on two rocks by a big tree

Then he would strum a lick, and get half lit
And go to readin' the writin' on the wall
Singin' Freedom's song common sing along
The Spirit of our fathers comes to call
Now jus coz you can, your dreams in hand
You climb up a mountain, just to fall
Paddle your canoe, do whatcha gotta do
Gotta be nuthin' to ever be sumpin' at all.

Ole Jim Tully he taught me a chord or two 
Till I could finally hold out on my own.
How to read a track, spearfish in the sun
And bow hunt all my own food down
Used dip and chew, smoked the peace pipe
Saw the need for a man to stand alone
But Jim went to the happy hunting grounds
And this song's called, Jim Tully's stone. 





Nice your hand 
you stretched to clasp
profound sky stopped to stoop
a little palm its clear invitation 
opened your soul to touch my heart
confused I hesitated I with dirt-stained coarse
beyond beach an ocean of uncertain 
chained my legs to hold all passion

gravity fails to deploy its magnetic bind
a me more than me widened ecliptic axis
with blunt my eyes, fixed my toes, shut my arms
when shouted your name with every dropp of blood 
absolutely unheard by unsoud treachery

waited long 
humiliated
no song sung by warm
holding sky again waving your buds
you returned 

and I a fourth dimensional doll
hanging alone in the space to loose 
all moments of esteemed staying 
simply to draw a line of dark
just to demonstrate a life more than death


How can I be different from others? 
This idea always hounds and bothers, 
I got to move smoothly and fall in lines, 
Even if not to liking but pay the fines, 

I can’t stand as only person, 
Humble humble submission as only son, 
I can’t be fed with advises in spoon, 
I stand to loose race very soon, 

I will have to steal the show, 
Side with wrong and weight throw, 
Not always with but ready to go, 
Chances to be had and can’t forgo, 

How to survive in selfish world, 
Where hollow promises and matter the word, 
Cheating, deceiving are strong parameters, 
Situation differs but never alters, 

I have to lie and show wrong cry, 
All just show but people feel why? 
I never feel regret and shy, 
Role different but have to ply, 

I can’t stand alone but have to side, 
Keeping al secret but not to confide, 
May be wrong but not all the time, 
Life to believe with simple goal prime


I can't believe, 
That nobody listens to me, 
To what I have to say.
I can't believe, 
That there is nobody to talk to, 
When I need to be able to talk to someone.
I can't believe, 
That your not here, 
Not talking to me, 
Not acknowledging me.
I can't believe, 
That you would ignore me, 
When I need you the most.
I can't believe, 
I can't believe. 

I am totally unaware
Not because I can’t dare
I am not ignorant too
But not willing to pass through

I have known through critical phase
That you can’t make hasty chase
You got to be careful and alert
Else you may get hurt

Body harm can be healed
Hurt feelings can be concealed
But what is about emotional cracks? 
When everything is at stake

I may make my self available
I know you are responsible and capable
Yet I doubt about your endurance skill
If mishandled then it may surely land me in trouble or kill

I wish I am safe in your arms
Nothing is done to me as harm
I dream of and wish complete surrender
It may not be miracle when clouds thunder

I shall make no double cross
Even if that meant irreparable loss
What I need is complete faith and trust
I think it is needed and definitely must


I can’t escape from this place, 
I am caged inside from this nightmare, 
So what if you can see the darkest side of me, 
Too many lies you told me, 
Somebody help me, 
From the person I have become, 
I can’t escape from you, 
Somebody help me escape from this nightmare, 
We believe that I can be a good person, 
Yet something sweet as you, 
Just fades away like the rest, 
I can’t escape from this place, 
This place that calls out my name, 
My heart is empty, 
My eyes are black, 
I am cold as ice, 
Forget me, 
Forget that we ever met, 
I am on the edge of falling off, 
My mind is scattered, 
I can’t escape from this place no matter where I run to. 

I am overwhelmed with sadness as I watch you walk away.
Even though I know you’ll be there when I wake.
I feel the tears run down my face.
And the loneliness becomes my favorite place.
There’s not comfort here anymore.
My body feels so out of place in this world of amazing grace.
No longer am I feeling safe.
Left out from my thoughts that race.
As I lay in bed at night I cry myself to sleep.
I wake up in a massive heap.
My head is throbbing from everything I keep.
It’s like a funnel draining down.
Starting at my head and working its way around, 
Until the life is gone from my body.
I lie there on the floor trying to think of a way to not believe you anymore.
All things you've done for me I need to give away.
The kindness and the friendship you gave me, 
Is nothing short of a home for me to stay.
I cannot stand hurting you while I pretend to feel.
Please forgive me for what I‘ve done, 
And remember you kept me from my hurt inside and that should feel real. 

I can't pretend to be your friend, when all I do is think of you. 
All day long, and through the night, I dream of you, this just ain't right. 
You see its me, the real me, the guy you refuse to see. 
Now I'm drained, always in pain, feeling like I'm going insane. 
Its because of you, the real you, the one who can't see who is who.  

I can't stop
The sunlight
Peeping through the window
Of my bedside.
I can't stop 
The rain
When it starts
To drain all my pain.
I can't stop
The tears
Of someone
Shivering with fears.
I can't stop 
The amusing style
Of children
When they give smiles.
I can't stop
The dried leaves
Falling from the trees.
I can't stop
The brightness of 
Moonlight
In lonely nights.
I can't stop
The sights
Waving in my eyes.
I can't stop
Myself
When it comes to write a poem.







Even if I want
I can't stop
As my fancy is right on top

I shall die
If I don't try
Next only to feel shy

Many beautiful faces 
Enter in race
I pick only one in that case

Natural smile with no regret
Whole world to watch on lovely set
She is mine so I can't forget

I have passion 
But can't be called compassion
It is pure relation

I write
For people to unite
Vow to live together and not to fight 

If I touch their heart
With very good start
I shall take it as human art

We are for others
Simple peaceful soldiers
Prophet's messengers

Take glass of water
Nothing will alter
Sea is full of it and ready to cater

Love to live and propagate 
Think of helpless and state
Their grief and plight to relate

So I am here
With you and forever
Will you lead me by holding finger

Behind her doors, live a pool of joy.
Whiles smiles cover our face
A mist of confusion
Awaits at our gates
After days of gladness
The bitterness of love kicks in
Like hungry dogs we fight! 
Spitting words that can break a heart! 
Like branches we fall apart
Her memories torture my head
Loneliness keeps creeping in
Whiles love sucks the air I breathe
My mind finds it  difficult
To erase her sweet memories
Enough my heart surrenders! 
I'm back knocking on her doors.

Thanks for reading

June h f I cry, can you hear my voice, 
In my lines; 
Can you touch, 
My tears, with your hands? 
I didn't know that songs were this beautiful, 
Whereas words were this insufficient 
Before I had this trouble. 
There is a place, I know; 
It is possible to say everything; 
I am pretty close, I can feel; 
I can't tell. 

No I can't touch the clouds for you I've never reached the sun for you
I've never done the things that you need done for you
I've stretched as high as I can reach I guess I'm not the one for you
Cause I can't touch the clouds or reach the sun for you
No I can't reach the clouds or touch the sun

No I can't turn back time for you and make you sweet sixteen again
I can't turn your barren fields to green again
And I can't sit around and talk of how might have been again
No I can't turn back time and make you young again
I can't turn back time and make you young

I can't look inside your mind and see the things you're hopin' for
I can't help you chase the dream you're gropin' for
I know your heart is open wide but I don't know who it's open for
Cause I can't know your mind or chase your dreams for you
Mhm I can't chase your dreams or know your mind

So say goodbye and don't look back I've had some happy days with you
I'm sorry but I can't be the one who stays with you
And if they ask about me you can say I was the one with you
Who never touched the clouds or reached the sun with you
I can't touch the clouds or reach the sun for you
I can't touch the clouds or reach the sun


I can't write poetry when I'm happy, 
Just as you can't see the sun in the night, 
As you can't hope for peace while you fight.
I'm a poet, and a poet of the tears, 
Rhyming sadness, illusions and fears, 
While hoping for the vanish of the pain.
Hoping and praying - I'm hoping in vain. 

I cannot be known
Better than you know me 

Your eyes in which we sleep
We together
Have made for my man's gleam
A better fate than for the common nights 

Your eyes in which I travel
Have given to signs along the roads
A meaning alien to the earth 

In your eyes who reveal to us
Our endless solitude 

Are no longer what they thought themselves to be 

You cannot be known
Better than I know you. 

I CANNOT love thee, tho' thy soul 
Be one which all good thoughts control; 
Altho' thy eyes be starry bright, 
And the gleams of golden light 
Fall upon thy silken hair, 
And thy forehead, broad and fair; 
Something of a cold disgust, 
(Wonderful, and most unjust,) 
Something of a sullen fear 
Weighs my heart when thou art near; 
And my soul, which cannot twine 
Thought or sympathy with thine, 
With a coward instinct tries 
To hide from thy enamour'd eyes, 
Wishing for a sudden blindness 
To escape those looks of kindness; 

Sad she folds her shivering wings 
From the love thy spirit brings, 
Like a chained thing, caress'd 
By the hand it knows the best, 
By the hand which, day by day, 
Visits its imprison'd stay, 
Bringing gifts of fruit and blossom 
From the green earth's plenteous bosom; 
All but that for which it pines 
In those narrow close confines, 
With a sad and ceaseless sigh-- 
Wild and winged Liberty! 

Can it be, no instinct dwells 
In th' immortal soul, which tells 
That thy love, oh! human brother, 
Is unwelcome to another? 
Can the changeful wavering eye, 
Raised to thine in forced reply,-- 
Can the cold constrained smile, 
Shrinking from thee all the while,-- 
Satisfy thy heart, or prove 
Such a likeness of true love? 

Seems to me, that I should guess 
By what a world of bitterness, 
By what a gulf of hopeless care, 
Our two hearts divided were: 
Seems to me that I should know 
All the dread that lurk'd below, 
By want of answer found 
In the voice's trembling sound; 
By the unresponsive gaze; 
By the smile which vainly plays, 
In whose cold imperfect birth 
Glows no fondness, lives no mirth; 
By the sigh, whose different tone 
Hath no echo of thine own; 
By the hand's cold clasp, which still 
Held as not of its free will, 
Shrinks, as it for freedom yearn'd;-- 
That my love was unreturn'd. 

When thy tongue (ah! woe is me!) 
Whispers love-vows tenderly, 
Mine is shaping, all unheard, 
Fragments of some withering word, 

Which, by its complete farewell, 
Shall divide us like a spell! 
And my heart beats loud and fast, 
Wishing that confession past; 
And the tide of anguish rises, 
Till its strength my soul surprises, 
And the reckless words, unspoken, 
Nearly have the silence broken, 
With a gush like some wild river,-- 
'Oh! depart, depart for ever!' 

But my faltering courage fails, 
And my drooping spirit quails; 
So sweet-earnest looks thy smile 
Full of tenderness the while, 
And with such strange pow'r are gifted 
The eyes to which my own are lifted; 
So my faint heart dies away, 
And my lip can nothing say, 
And I long to be alone,-- 
For I weep when thou are gone! 

Yes, I weep, but then my soul 
Free to ponder o'er the whole, 
Free from fears which check'd its thought, 
And the pain thy presence brought, 
Whispers me the useless lie,-- 
'For thy love he will not die, 
Such pity is but vanity.' 
And I bend my weary head 
O'er the tablets open spread, 
Whose fair pages me invite 
All I dared not say to write; 
And my fingers take the pen, 
And my heart feels braced again 
With a resolute intent;-- 
But, ere yet that page be sent, 
Once I view the written words 
Which must break thy true heart's chords; 
And a vision, piercing bright, 
Rises on my coward sight, 
Of thy fond hand, gladly taking 
What must set thy bosom aching; 
While too soon the brittle seal 
Bids the page the worst reveal, 
Blending in thy eager gaze-- 
Scorn, and anguish, and amaze. 

Powerless, then, my hand reposes 
On the tablet which it closes, 
With a cold and shivering sense 
Born of Truth's omnipotence: 
And my weeping blots the leaves, 
And my sinking spirit grieves, 
Humbled in that bitter hour 
By the very consciousness of power! 
What am I, that I should be 
Such a source of woe to thee? 
What am I, that I should dare 
Thus to play with thy despair, 
And persuade myself that thou 
Wilt not bend beneath the blow? 

Rather should my conscience move 
Me to think of this vain love, 
Which my life of peace beguiles, 
As a tax on foolish smiles, 
Which--like light not meant for one 
Who, wandering in the dark alone, 
Hath yet been tempted by its ray 
To turn aside and lose his way-- 
Binds me, by their careless sin, 
To take the misled wanderer in. 

And I praise thee, as I go, 
Wandering, weary, full of woe, 
To my own unwilling heart; 
Cheating it to take thy part 
By rehearsing each rare merit 
Which thy nature doth inherit. 
To myself their list I give, 
Most prosaic, positive:-- 
How thy heart is good and true, 
And thy face most fair to view; 
How the powers of thy mind 
Flatterers in the wisest find, 
Seem as held in trust for Heaven; 
Labouring on for noble ends,-- 
Steady to thy boyhood's friends,-- 
Slow to give, or take, offence,-- 
Full of earnest eloquence,-- 
Hopeful, eager, gay of cheer,-- 
Frank in all thy dealings here,-- 

Ready to redress the wrong 
Of the weak against the strong,-- 
Keeping up an honest pride 
With those the world hath deified, 
But gently bending heart and brow 
To the helpless and the low;-- 
How, in brief, there dwells in thee 
All tht's generous and free, 
All that may most aptly move 
My Spirit to an answering love. 

But in vain the tale is told; 
Still my heart lies dead and cold, 
Still it wanders and rebels 
From the thought that thus compels, 
And refuses to rejoice 
Save in unconstrain&emacr;d choice. 

Therefore, when thine eyes shall read 
This, my book, oh take thou heed! 
In the dim lines written here, 
All shall be explained and clear; 

All my lips could never speak 
When my heart grew coward-weak,-- 
All my hand could never write, 
Tho' I planned it day and night,-- 
All shall be at length confest, 
And thou'lt forgive,--and let me rest! 
None but thou and I shall know 
Whose the doom, and whose the woe; 
None but thou and I shall share 
In the secret printed there; 
It shall be a secret still, 
Tho' all look on it at will; 
And the eye shall read in vain 
What the heart cannot explain. 
Each one, baffled in his turn, 
Shall no more its aim discern, 
Than a wanderer who might look 
On some wizard's magic book, 
Of the darkly-worded spell 
Where deep-hidden meanings dwell. 
Memory, fancy, they shall task 
This sad riddle to unmask,-- 
Or, with bold conjectural fame, 
Fit the pages with a name;-- 

But nothing shall they understand, 
And vainly shall the stanger's hand 
Essay to fling the leaves apart, 
Which bear MY message to THY heart

I can realize buds, flowers 
and their blooming in the gardens of earth; 
only I cannot realize their falling down from trees.

I can realize clouds, rain 
and the sweet soft sound of their fall; 
only I cannot realize thunder.

Rivers, fields, oceans, forests, 
hills and mountains— 
I can realize them all; 
only I cannot realize deserts.

I can realize fishes, sharks, deer 
and the bright striped tigers; 
only I cannot realize a shark beside a fish 
and a tiger beside a deer.

I can realize life 
and many turns of life I can realize very clearly; 
only I cannot realize the ice-cold death any way. 

I hear your voice
On the song of the wind.
It follows me, 
Haunts me, 
Blowing through the crevices
Of my mind.

It follows me 
Into my dreams, 
Softly whispering, 
Torturing me
With your name. 
And I cannot run.

I cannot hide, 
For in midnight's darkness, 
I see your eyes.
I feel your body's heat
In the midday sun. 
Everywhere I go, 
You follow me, 
And I cannot run. 

Is it a better death in any significant way 
to leap from a fiery hell? 
I'm sure I cannot say. 

Than to feel the daisy-cutter's slashing scythe 
cut through flesh and frame? 
I'm sure I cannot say. 

Or to glance as your smart-bombed roof of slate or rock 
collapses and crushes your bones? 
I'm sure I cannot say. 

Do you prefer the bullet boring through your head 
passing swiftly through brain and puss? 
I'm sure I cannot say. 

Perhaps the gleaming thrust of knife to gut attracts, 
the romance of blood in dust? 
I'm sure I cannot say. 

Cleansing fingers on your throat, clenching in neighborly hate 
when comity has fled? 
I'm sure I cannot say. 

To die in bed? Knowing you've lost your mortal friends, 
foes and kin alike, all dead? 
I'm sure I cannot say. 

In a fearful land of loneliness and pain 
Death will surely have its way. 
That I can say. 

Words. . 

words
Tripping ever so lightly 
Off the tongue. 
Sometimes, 
They mean nothing.
They are just
Meaningless babble.

More often, 
It is 
The very things
You cannot say
That mean
Everything! ! 

The things you think. 
Held close 
To your heart, 
Are the things
Which choke
In your throat.

Those precious words, 
Which cannot be said
To the one
Who needs
To hear them most
Are the words
I cannot say.




I  can't stop missing you 


Sitting in a gloomy place
Enjoying life's aloof phase
I Kindle my soul
With your love's environment
To breathe  my only assignment
Every moment your presence renew
I seek far and wide for you
Because I can't stop missing you.

My life's getting dragged
Memories are getting stacked
Wish to listen your loving whispers
Fulfil your desires as your ambassador
Understand your heart's hunches
Despite, bearing life's punches 
The cosmos paints a vanishing hue
But I can't stop missing you

Everyday is a haunting raid
Still early to go into Hades
Seems I've lost in the crowd
Light years from your beautiful sound
My heart wants to run and eschew
But nothing can part me from you
As I can't stop missing you

Seems I'm in an endless queue
Perspiring like morning dew
Everyday is a new Halloween
The Ghost is always following
But nothing can part me from you
As My heart just seeks for you
Because I can't stop missing you



I care now less
And tell him on the face
About my decision
'There can be no more relation'

He has been unreasonable
Almost unbearable with lots problems
Daily beating with no reason
He has turned now insane person

Children are growing
I give in silently and allowing
But now it is almost beyond limit
I want him to know how I shall greet.

I am serving woman
Take care for him and children
It is the only reason I tolerate
Keep silent and never state 

He has entered home
With no more happiness to welcome
He is not in his usual sense
His entry makes me tense 

'you whore I shall push you out'
I heard him whispering about
He was falling on ground and rising
His next act was not at all surprising


I created flutter by saying 'I care too hoots'
All raised eyebrows but certainly misunderstood
It was not for uncaring the friends around
It was for finding new love on the ground

The creator of universe has given us beautiful heart
To feel grace from within as an art
You feel elated with each step you start
To make the people feel as an inseparable part

It is not meant for feeling stone tendency
Where water rolls away with same frequency
It has nothing to feel and nothing to store
What else it can gather and ask for more! 

With each breathe heart pumps fresh blood
New feelings supplied in as tonic or food
Eyes shine with blessings to others
With sole aim of spreading it further

Heart may bleed if caused harm to any one
That grief will be shared by none
Heart may ache and cry with curse and regret
Give no more worries to feel and seal the fate

Neither is it designed to deliver shocks
Nor to receive blows from fresh stocks
It is simple mechanism to receive and store
Feel it from its depth and wishfully adore

Love to spread and love to propagate
Nothing else to mind and helplessly narrate
Shun the talk if that doesn't properly relate
Be the first person to kind gesture and never be late

Cry over every single act of emission
That may wash your dirt with honest admission
What else we need to desire than to love fellow brethrens! 
World is so big to take note of with lot many concerns


The sound of love breathes
On me words to curl around 
Your heart. Carried with my care
They come tenderly bound.

I have words which spring
From nectar's well, heaven-blown
Into my soul, ocean deep
They speed across the foam.

Weighty with comfort
My words flow gently along.
Meant to warm you, and carried
Willingly is my word-song. 


In the morning I cast my net into the sea.

I dragged up from the dark abyss things of strange aspect and strange beauty -- some shone like a smile, some glistened like tears, and some were flushed like the cheeks of a bride.

When with the day's burden I went home, my love was sitting in the garden idly tearing the leaves of a flower.

I hesitated for a moment, and then placed at her feet all that I had dragged up, and stood silent.

She glanced at them and said, 'What strange things are these? I know not of what use they are!'

I bowed my head in shame and thought, 'I have not fought for these, I did not buy them in the market; they are not fit gifts for her.'

Then the whole night through I flung them one by one into the street.

In the morning travellers came; they picked them up and carried them into far countries. 

The low lands call
I am tempted to answer
They are offering me a free dwelling 
	                        

	                        
	                          .  
	                        

	                        
	                          .  


I am tempted to answer
They are offering me a free dwelling 
Without having to conquer

The massive mountain makes its move
Beckoning me to ascend
A much more difficult path
To get up the slippery bend

I cannot choose both 
I have a choice to make
I must be wise
This will determine my fate

I choose, I choose the mountain
With all its stress and strain
Because only by climbing
Can I rise above the plain

I choose the  mountain 
And I will never stop climbing
I choose the mountain
And I shall forever be ascending

I choose the mountaini no longer play the victim, 
that no longer who i am, 
i'm the girl who finds my own way, 
not afraid to ask for help, 
cuz it will only help me go far, 

i no longer play the victim, 
i can do for myself, 
even when i'm injured, 
i will find my way, 
don't feel sorry for me, 

i'm no longer the victim, 
i say what's on my mind, 
and bite my tongue, 
when i will only create more drama, 
it who i am, and who i will continue to be, 

no longer a victim, 
to people hating who i want to be, 
to me hating where i can't be, 
action speak louder than words, 
and right now they are saying, 


'And I start wondering how they came to be blind.
If it was congenital, they could be brothers and sister,
and I think of the poor mother
brooding over her sightless young triplets.

Or was it a common accident, all three caught
in a searing explosion, a firework perhaps?
If not,
if each came to his or her blindness separately,

how did they ever manage to find one another?
Would it not be difficult for a blind mouse
to locate even one fellow mouse with vision
let alone two other blind ones?

And how, in their tiny darkness,
could they possibly have run after a farmer's wife
or anyone else's wife for that matter?
Not to mention why.

Just so she could cut off their tails
with a carving knife, is the cynic's answer,
but the thought of them without eyes
and now without tails to trail through the moist grass

or slip around the corner of a baseboard
has the cynic who always lounges within me
up off his couch and at the window
trying to hide the rising softness that he feels.

By now I am on to dicing an onion
which might account for the wet stinging
in my own eyes, though Freddie Hubbard's
mournful trumpet on "Blue Moon,"

which happens to be the next cut,
cannot be said to be making matters any better. 

The fact is i cannot tolerate to be a statue,
hence i work hard to achieve my dreams. 



I close my eyes like a good little boy at night in bed, 
as I was told to do by my mother when she lived, 
and before bed I brush my teeth and slip on my pajamas, 
as I was told, and look forward to tomorrow. 


I do all things required of me to make me a citizen of sterling worth. 
I keep a job and come home each evening for dinner. I arrive at the 
same time on the same train to give my family a sense of order. 


I obey traffic signals. I am cordial to strangers, I answer my 
mail promptly. I keep a balanced checking account. Why can’t I 
live forever

I CLOSED MY EYES
I closed my eyes just to see the light
Because the world I am in is like dead
Men walking in their bloodshed ways, 
They had lost their faith, and the blind eyes
Are leading the way, 

The angels cry day and night, 
While I lift my eyes for the light to shine
My eye lids felt heavy and my body weak
I fallen to my knees; 
like I was being born again
To the true spirit of true love, 

Parts of me think I had made you up
When it comes to darken dreams 
I see many things, I must always ask myself
What is truly real and what isn't, 
Things are never what they seem
in darken dreams, 

The stars are dancing around
upon into the heavenly skies, 
while the moon slowly waltz out of its gloom
in that ancient time of late June; 
I can see the colored velvet moon
shine love upon the sea.





I closed my eyes to creation when I beheld his beauty, I became 
intoxicated with his beauty and bestowed my soul. 
For the sake of Solomon’s seal I became wax in all my body, 
and in order to become illumined I rubbed my wax. 
I saw his opinion and cast away my own twisted opinion; I 
became his reed pipe and likewise lamented on his lip. 
He was in my hand, and blindly I groped for him with my 
hand; I was in his hand, and yet I inquired of those who were 
misinformed. 
I must have been either a simpleton or drunk or mad that 
fearfully I was stealing from my own gold. 
Like a thief I crept through a crack in the wall into my own 
vine, like a thief I gathered jasmine from my own garden. 
Enough, do not twist my secret upon your fingertips, for I have 
twisted off out of your twisted fist. 
Shams-e Tabriz, from whom comes the light of moon and 
stars–though I am grieving with sorrow for him, I am like the 
crescent of the festival. 

Before i used to sperm on the floor,
while i was watching erotic movies!
I enjoy it, because even today
i'm still masturbating!
The only difference is. 
i got woman & girls,
who manipulate me!
It's a miracle,
because they come to me like it's personal. 
but i can never touch. 
except to feel them!


KFM PRODUCTIONSI conquer the world with words,
conquer the mother tongue,
verbs, nouns, syntax.
I sweep away the beginning of things
and with a new language
that has the music of water the message of fire
I light the coming age
and stop time in your eyes
and wipe away the line
that separates
time from this single moment. 

I take my dreams and make of them a bronze vase
and a round fountain with a beautiful statue in its center.
And a song with a broken heart and I ask you:
Do you understand my dreams?
Sometimes you say you do,
And sometimes you say you don't.
Either way it doesn't matter.
I continue to dream. 

I could be dead for I do not feel. 
Life around it seems unreal, 
I do exist with eyes in observation
Scenes displayed in acts duration; 
Either expressed with sense of comedy, 
To me no difference, as well as tragedy.

I preserve existence to its basic needs, 
Survival, which with my essence feeds; 
And day by day I am dying more, more
Than already dead; to be no more! 
Living numb in my own slavery, 
My final death welcome; an end to misery! 

O, no! I do not wish it, don't I? 
I cannot leave with just a sigh! 
Hope concealed is under veil, 
For how could I've lived my life in vain? 
I have Control and Human Pride, 
Ridiculous it is.  

Although My Life

I had the feeling that something was off
Something too grand to even think of
But I've hardly ever been wrong before
And now I know more than I could have asked for

Keep on deleting, wipe out a past
Based on lies, it just couldn't last
There's only one winner to come out of this mess
So go on and tie your sharp claws to someone else

Now you better leave and refrain from what always was mine
From now on it's only a matter of time
I say my thanks as I take a bow
I survived, but I could die happy right nowi know-
you won’t join me
beneath the moon 
to taste ferments
from crystalline glass
nesting on satin

though you 
have that longing
wedge within-
embering to a glow
warming winter cold
to degree of comfortability
yet doubts drape
with gentle feathery clouds passing, 
sprouting buds concealed
too young to foresee
blooms on mistletoe

but i’m most hopeful.  enough
that i could.  i could laugh


I was a child before sure sixty one years ago, 
Mother's lap was pleasure I couldn't forgo.
She was dandling me, was feeding me often, 
I remembered her now how did she soften.

I was bare she was making me dapper, 
When I was reading she supplied me paper.
With care she was sending me to School, 
I was walking with school-bag, Tiffin can full.

She was singing spiritual songs in sweet voice, 

She was training me to go in right path, 
Timely I was doing my works and taking bath.
She was giving me advice to have value in life, 
I would have simplicity, honesty and nonviolence-rife.

She was looking after me when I was ill, 
I was coming round soon for Doctor's will.
Her care was marvellous towards whole of day
To keep patience all time ever she again did say.

One day in sudden did not know what happened, 
In my early teenage I lost her forever I saddened 
She was no more but at all I couldn't forget her, 

I remembered her back as I was in her lap more, 
She unexpectedly crossed the life boat and shore.
From her core of heart, fell pure affection for me
Still I wandered in path playing life I could not see.

Before she left she called, 'come on eat sweet rice, '
Showing moon last night she did feed me thrice.
With pot-herb fry and rice full of palm with salt, 
She did feed telling many stories of Indian epic cult.

She called all brothers, sisters, relatives and father, 
'I am really very fine for me all at all do not bother.
Life is like this only sometimes blooms, does wither, 
Without hesitation and sorrow you all live better.'

She worried for me and my sister thinking younger, 
Advised without her time to adjust, become stronger.
No longer was she in strength she was getting a pain, 
The rivers and streams were flooded it was heavy rain.

Looked at sky and she said, 'Oh children you do adore, 
Whoever may tell what you must tolerate all of them, 
Whatever they will give you eat in pleasure of name.'

'Do not fall down from righteousness and true track, 
Nowhere victory comes in life due to courage lack.'
She advised many more things at her last time to all, 

The mercury of life went away shining body of mother, 
She was no more for time I looked at her face further.
I cried out of agony with still stood in courage to right, 
I could not forget her, my beloved mom was soul light.I could not prove the Years had feet—
Yet confident they run
Am I, from symptoms that are past
And Series that are done—

I find my feet have further Goals—
I smile upon the Aims
That felt so ample—Yesterday—
Today's—have vaster claims—

I do not doubt the self I was
Was competent to me—
But something awkward in the fit—
Proves that—outgrown—I see—An Angel knocked upon my door, 
I could not understand what for, 
And in a soft sweet voice he said, 
Do you realise that you are dead! 
I replied, I did not think it so, 
But then again how could I know.
How was I to believe this news, 
Yet he was not wearing any shoes, 
And he was floating around my place, 
With a beaming smile upon his face.
I sort of thought that he may be right, 
Something strange had happened in the night.
For I had felt myself begin to rise
Up from my bed. Maybe my demise! 
He turned and placed together his palms, 
Then opened up his slender arms, 
And taking my hand he flew with me, 



I could suffice for Him, I knew—
He—could suffice for Me—
Yet Hesitating Fractions—Both
Surveyed Infinity—

"Would I be Whole" He sudden broached—
My syllable rebelled—
'Twas face to face with Nature—forced—

Withdrew the Sun—to Other Wests—
Withdrew the furthest Star
Before Decision—stooped to speech—
And then—be audibler

The Answer of the Sea unto
The Motion of the Moon—
Herself adjust Her Tides—unto—
Could I—do else—with Mine

a great poet with a singular style, 
"I could never write like this and so 

"
Kelly! Poets like you put life in the lifeless clay, 
I am not a poet, I am a lover, 
I love the clay fermented by you, 
I make it a singing and dancing doll, 
let me love this doll.
If I write something like that of a poem, 
It's not poetry, just a magic of love, 
transformed in words and lines, 
Dear Friend! The bitter truths, 
about the Creator and the Creatures, 
when make me suffocating on the earth, 
and my Dr. Heart prescribes beauty
as a medicine to restore my breaths
and to wash ugliness of human caricature, 
I survey the earth and its beauty, 
And I ask to myself, 
"Is there anything more beautiful other than love? 
And is there anything more lovely than a doll? 
So I write poems on the beauty of a doll, 
That's all I can do at this stage of life.
But when my breaths are restored, 
and ugliness is decreased to a certain extent
I look into other matters, 
and write some poems, 
that make me sick once again, 
a doll comes again in my dreams
and inspires me to write one more love poem

"I crave your mouth, your voice, your hair.
Silent and starving, I prowl through the streets.
Bread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day
I hunt for the liquid measure of your steps. 

I hunger for your sleek laugh,
your hands the color of a savage harvest,
hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails,
I want to eat your skin like a whole almond. 

I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body,
the sovereign nose of your arrogant face,
I want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes, 

and I pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight,
hunting for you, for your hot heart,
like a puma in the barrens of Quitratue.



I cried at Pity—not at Pain—
I heard a Woman say
"Poor Child"—and something in her voice
Convicted me—of me—

So long I fainted, to myself
It seemed the common way,
And Health, and Laughter, Curious things—
To look at, like a Toy—

To sometimes hear "Rich people" buy
And see the Parcel rolled—
And carried, I supposed—to Heaven,
For children, made of Gold—

But not to touch, or wish for,
Or think of, with a sigh—
And so and so—had been to me,

I wish I knew that Woman's name—
So when she comes this way,
To hold my life, and hold my ears
For fear I hear her say

She's "sorry I am dead"—again—
Just when the Grave and I—
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep,
Our only Lullaby—I cried out to you in the morning
Did it from despair
I cried out to you in the midlight
Hoping you would care
I cried out to you in the evening
Please answer my prayer
I cried out to you in the midnight
Wishing you were there

Trapped in a pit I had dug myself
Blinded from within
Mine enemy being filled with glee
Enhanced my chagrin
Then, begged I forgiveness from Thyself
You rescued me, causing foe to flee
And healing to begin

I praise you for your mercy
I am grateful for your love
Thank you for my sanity
You have sent from up above










 




I cross till I am weary
A Mountain—in my mind—
More Mountains—then a Sea—
More Seas—And then
A Desert—find—

And My Horizon blocks
With steady—drifting—Grains
Of unconjectured quantity—
As Asiatic Rains—

Nor this—defeat my Pace—
It hinder from the West
But as an Enemy's Salute
One hurrying to Rest—

What merit had the Goal—
Except there intervene
Faint Doubt—and far Competitor—
To jeopardize the Gain?

At last—the Grace in sight—
I shout unto my feet—
I offer them the Whole of Heaven
The instant that we meet—

They strive—and yet delay—
They perish—Do we die—
Or is this Death's Experiment—
Reversed—in Victory

Sometimes when I'm alone
I Cry, 
Cause I am on my own.
The tears I cry are bitter and warm.
They flow with life but take no form
I Cry because my heart is torn.
I find it difficult to carry on. 
If I had an ear to confide in, 
I would cry among my treasured friend, 
but who do you know that stops that long, 
to help another carry on.
The world moves fast and it would rather pass by.
Then to stop and see what makes one cry, 
so painful and sad. 
And sometimes. 
I Cry 
and no one cares about why. 

In the midst of the night
my heart longs for you.

The spirit in me seeks you.

I feel i am conceived
in your presence.

i squirm and writhe.

i cry out in pangs.


When you are born in me
i close my tearful eyes.

I smile in the radiant dew.

(radiant dew is an expression of indescribable joy of the soul)


Children born of fairy stock
Never need for shirt or frock,
Never want for food or fire,
Always get their hearts desire:
Jingle pockets full of gold,
Marry when they're seven years old.
Every fairy child may keep
Two ponies and ten sheep;
All have houses, each his own,
Built of brick or granite stone;
They live on cherries, they run wild--
I'd love to be a Fairy's child. 

I'd mourn the hopes that leave me, 
If thy smiles had left me too; 
I'd weep when friends deceive me, 
If thou wert, like them, untrue. 
But while I've thee before me, 
With heart so warm and eyes so bright, 
No clouds can linger o'er me, 
That smile turns them all to light. 

'Tis not in fate to harm me, 
While fate leaves thy love to me: 
'Tis not in joy to charm me, 
Unless joy be shared with thee. 
One minute's dream about thee 
Were worth a long, an endless year 
Of waking bliss without thee, 
My own love, my only dear! 

And though the hope be gone, love, 
That long sparkled o'er our way, 
Oh! we shall journey on, love, 
More safely, without its ray. 
Far better lights shall win me, 
Along the path I've yet to roam -- 
The mind that burns within me, 
And pure smiles from thee at home. 

Thus, when the lamp that lighted 
The traveller at first goes out, 
He feels awhile benighted, 
And looks round in fear and doubt. 
But soon, the prospect clearing, 
By cloudless starlight on he treads, 
And thinks no lamp so cheering 
As the light which Heaven sheds. 

I'd Rather Have Habits Than Clothes,
For that's where my intellect shows.
And as for my hair,
Do you think I should care
To comb it at night with my toes?

I'd rather have ears than a nose,
I'd rather have fingers than toes,
But as for my hair:
I'm glad it's all there;
I'll be awfully sad when it goes.

I wish that my Room had a Floor;
I don't so much care for a Door,
But this walking around
Without touching the ground
Is getting to be quite a bore

i'd support obama 

by steven g taylor

 

i'd support obama, . 

if the 'gitmo' base was closed, 

if all the torture was disclosed, 

if investigations of the plot 

were at least proposed! ! ; 

if the press was not so juxtaposed, 

and if the jew elite class was exposed

i'd support obama if he cared, 

that truth to the masses is not shared; 

instead, please know, i am truly scared, 

his rule will be by most dispaired, 

for all that's evil he is paired.

lifting up my hands and leg
standing on the tip of my leg
like the Indian sanyasins.

Like a yogi and a sadhu 
in your unseen presence
I shall dance forgetting myself.

Would you come to me
dancing in prema, 
in affection, in emotion, 
virtue and kindness, 
compassion, in eros, 
in creative intimacy. 

There it hung gracefully in the darkness, 
So beautiful I could not resist, 
I shall go to the silk ball and dance with the stars.

I used the clouds as steps and the stars formed me a ladder, 
And I touch the ball, 
It is so silky and as smooth as milk, 
I dance all night with it.

I come back home and tell the amazing news, 
But of course no-one believed me, 
But, I shall treasure it as my memory for ever.
For I danced with the ball of silk! 


oh my god i must have flipped
the wolf inside came out
grief.. bottled inside, i have to shout
I have no control i need control 
i have no control i need control! 

if i kill i again it will be my blood shed
then the beast inside will stay unfed
I, Atreyu will have to die
to leave the werewolf inside behind


I want to have the extremes of your Love,
See, how silly am I, wishing for unachievable.

I don't care if you maltreat me or promise to unveil your beauty,
I just want something unbearable to test my fortitude

For, instead I want to be face to face with you.
(I don't want to go to paradise but want to observe the Divine Beauty) 

O fellows, I am here for a few moments, as a gust, 
Like morning star I will fade and vanish in a few moments.

I disclosed the secret in public,
I need to be punished for being so rude. 

He was tired; I could see
His hands were shaking and dirty.
How long since a good bath; 
A decent meal, only he knew
If he could even remember.
Never looking up
When we passed, 
He softly asked
If we could spare a buck or two.
A few steps later 
I offered my husband a few dollars 
To bring back to him.
I did not want to look into his face; 
Know his story
Be embraced by his pain. 
He did not want to look into mine; 
Be confronted again with his shame. 

I didn't go to church today,
The surf was swirling blue and white,
The children swirling on the sand.
He knows, He knows how brief my stay,
How brief this spell of summer weather,
He knows when I am said and done
We'll have plenty of time together. 

I Didn't Inhale, I Promise! ! 

Oh, Well, What The Heck! ! 

Maybe I did, after all! ! 

That Would Explain
The Rosy Glow, 
Wouldn't IT? ? 

Or, could love have been
The real explaination
For what we both seemed
To feel
That Day? 

March  didn't write this poem, I did not choose these words
I'd never give my name to something so absolutely absurd
The idea of this poem is anathema to my senses
It should be locked away behind some very high fences

If I would write a poem, I'd pick a different theme
I'd write about a vivid and fascinating dream
A galloping steed upon which sat a handsome knight
Would be a poem subject on which I'd like to write

There are certain standards that I like to maintain
And many topics from which I choose to abstain
This poem is one from which I'd keep my distance
I cannot see a reason for its very existence

So if you read this poem, I can't believe you've got this far
Do not blame me if it leaves a sad and sorry scar
I tried to warn you that it's got nothing to do with me
It doesn't even come provided with a valid warranty


I died for beauty, but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb,
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room. 

He questioned softly why I failed?
"For beauty," I replied.
"And I for truth - the two are one;
We brethren are," he said. 

And so, as kinsmen met a-night,
We talked between the rooms,
Until the moss had reached our lips,
And covered up our names. 

I died for beauty but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb,
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room.

He questioned softly why I failed?
'For beauty,' I replied.
'And I for truth,--the two are one;
We brethren are,' he said.

And so, as kinsmen met a night,
We talked between the rooms,
Until the moss had reached our lips,
And covered up our names. 

It's time I disappear
And cause a tear
From those who find me dear
My resting place was never clear

It's time I disappear
To a place not so near
To vanish with hardly a trace
From the salty-aired place

It's time I disappear
And put to rest that fear
That I went up or down
After I had drown

It's time I disappear
And make things unclear
To the big guy
Who thought I could fly


I do but ask that you be always fair 
That I forever may continue kind; 
Knowing me what I am, you should not dare 
To lapse from beauty ever, nor seek to bind 
My alterable mood with lesser cords; 
Weeping and such soft matters must invite 
To further vagrancy; and bitter words 
Chafe soon to irremediable flight, 
Wherefore I pray you if you love me dearly, 
Less dear to hold me than your own bright charms, 
Whence it may fall that until death, or nearly, 
I shall not move to struggle from your arms: 
Fade if you must,--I would but bid you be 
Like the sweet year, doing all things graciously. 

Tis better to expire by the knife
Than endure a cacophonous life
That is the penalty
Sentence for bigamy
The price for having more than one wife


How wise I am to have instructed the butler
to instruct the first footman to instruct the second
footman to instruct the doorman to order my carriage;
I am about to volunteer a definition of marriage.
Just as I know that there are two Hagens, Walter and Copen,
I know that marriage is a legal and religious alliance entered
into by a man who can't sleep with the window shut and a
woman who can't sleep with the window open.
Moreover, just as I am unsure of the difference between
flora and fauna and flotsam and jetsam,
I am quite sure that marriage is the alliance of two people
one of whom never remembers birthdays and the other
never forgetsam,
And he refuses to believe there is a leak in the water pipe or
the gas pipe and she is convinced she is about to asphyxiate
or drown,
And she says Quick get up and get my hairbrushes off the
windowsill, it's raining in, and he replies Oh they're all right,

it's only raining straight down.
That is why marriage is so much more interesting than divorce,
Because it's the only known example of the happy meeting of
the immovable object and the irresistible force.
So I hope husbands and wives will continue to debate and
combat over everything debatable and combatable,
Because I believe a little incompatibility is the spice of life,
particularly if he has income and she is pattable. 

Baby we're the perfect two, there's no complication.
The only mathematics we need is me plus you it's the perfect equation.
But when we're in science we create a chemical reaction.
Ten out of Ten is our love expressed as a fraction.

In geography, to the clouds we will go.
Out of this world to the universe our love will flow.
We're learning in health how the heart is the strongest tendant.
All of mine you possess, one hundred as a percentage.

Don't let people tell you about the past, as we learn that in history.
Together we have come; our love is no longer a mystery.
If painted on canvas, you'd be the perfect piece of art.
That smile, those eyes, has been imprinted in my heart.

What would Socrates theory be on loves philosophy? 
He would say such chemistry, was only created by you and me.
Thomas Edison was the inventor of electricity.
We invented a bigger spark that gained publicity.

In legal, there is law of the criminal.
Into my heart you shot your love, so subliminal.
As we learn in religion about Adam and Eve.

I know I'm young but I know love.
And I know an angel when I see one.
And I'm standing here in front of you.
And I know you feel that connection that I do too.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that you are my love.
Thanking him for sending me an angel into my heart.
Blessed by her presence, hopefully we'll never be apart.

If you're sad or upset, just let me know.
And my love upon you, I will bestow.
I will be your sunshine to the rain.
And your aspirin when you're in pain.

When it's dark, I'll be your luminous light.
To guide you through the loneliest night.
Even when we get into minor discrepancies.
I reminisce about Friday night, in which is my favourite memory.

I care for you and I do love you baby, 
I'll be on my knee to make you my lady.
Although this won't happen for a while, 
I can't wait to see you on your father's arm, walking down the aisle. 

Proceeding to my office, I was on my bike, 
I noticed an open man hole in the street, 
Welcoming the visitors to adore and like, 
The grander of the hole with smells so sweet! 

The addicts had stolen and sold its covers, 
The police being paid every month by purchaser, 
A handsome sum for it and others, 
Popularly known as 'bhatta', a right of enforcer.

I saw a dog in the open man hole, 
Trying hard and hard to get out of it, 
He looked at me with his hopeful sole, 
Please help me, my lord, just a bit.

I was so late and I knew it well, 
If I help him I'll have to change, 
My affected dress with a bad smell, 
A struggle was inside, with my goodness in a cage.

Meanwhile a sweeper with a bamboo in his hand, 
Came for the rescue of the helpless dog, 
He was looking like an angel, great and grand, 
Helped the dog who jumped out like a frog.

He moved his tale, the nature had trained, 
Looked at the sweeper with his grateful eyes, 
If I would have helped him! I exclaimed, 
The sweeper's name I saw at the skies.

You are much taller and greater than me, 
We are men with garbage, and you are the cleaner, 
The lord of the moment you are taller than me, 
It doesn't matter that you are a sweeper.

And what of myself, a selfish white collar! 
The worst on the face of this lovely earth, 
Never thankful, to my helpful Master! 
I do not, but the dog has some worth. 

I DO not love thee! - no! I do not love thee! 
And yet when thou art absent I am sad; 
   And envy even the bright blue sky above thee, 
Whose quiet stars may see thee and be glad. 

   I do not love thee! - yet, I know not why, 
Whate'er thou dost seems still well done, to me: 
   And often in my solitude I sigh 
That those I do love are not more like thee! 

   I do not love thee! - yet, when thou art gone, 
I hate the sound (though those who speak be dear)  
   Which breaks the lingering echo of the tone 
Thy voice of music leaves upon my ear. 

   I do not love thee! - yet thy speaking eyes, 
With their deep, bright, and most expressive blue, 
   Between me and the midnight heaven arise, 
Oftener than any eyes I ever knew. 

   I know I do not love thee! yet, alas! 
Others will scarcely trust my candid heart; 
   And oft I catch them smiling as they pass, 
Because they see me gazing where thou art. 

I do not love you except because I love you; 
I go from loving to not loving you,
From waiting to not waiting for you
	                        

	                        
	                          .  
	                        

	                        
	                          .  


I go from loving to not loving you,
From waiting to not waiting for you
My heart moves from cold to fire.

I love you only because it's you the one I love; 
I hate you deeply, and hating you
Bend to you, and the measure of my changing love for you
Is that I do not see you but love you blindly.

Maybe January light will consume
My heart with its cruel
Ray, stealing my key to true calm.

In this part of the story I am the one who
Dies, the only one, and I will die of love because I love you,
Because I love you, Love, in fire and blood. 

I do not ask for mercy for understanding for peace
And in these heavy days I do not ask for release
I do not ask that suffering shall cease.

To give an ear attentive to my cry
To pause in his marching and not hurry by.

I do not ask for anything I do not speak
I do not question and I do not seek
I used to in the day when I was weak.

Now I am strong and lapped in sorrow
As in a coat of magic mail and borrow
From Time today and care not for tomorrow. 

I do not wonder that the Druids built
Their sacred altars in the sacred groves.
Of our poor weak humanity behoves
That we should set aside no little part
Of the devotion of the yearning heart
To rest and peace, as typical of that
Sweet tranquil rest to which the good aspire.
Calm thoughts are as the purifying fire
That burns the useless dross from life's mixed gold,
And lights the torch of mind. While grasping at
The shadow for the substance, youth grows old,
And groves of palm spring up in every heart-

Again my car is back to the mechanic, 
To see what is wrong once more, 
Will he rip me off and begin to laugh? 
As I’m making my way out the door? 

The teacher who's handling thirty students, 
Robert’s still failing and unlikely to pass, 
And do her part tutoring him after class? 

If you found an Indian head nickel, 
Judging by your skin at a coin collector’s, 
Would you still receive what's it's worth? 

More often than not in our lifetime, 
A fair shake we will not receive, 
It really doesn’t matter what the reason, 
Only that someone is going to deceive.

Caught in the act she had to be stoned, 
Let him among you is without sin do it, 
In the end she was left standing alone.

We can’t be caught up with how others treat, 
Be sure the road’s straight in placing your feet, 
Let misguided feelings constantly linger on, 
You’ll become the one who is in the wrong. 

While we were warming up in rehearsal, 
A half hour before the radio broadcast, 
Mrs. Lowe criticizes our choir on a song, 
They had just sung it way too fast.

Saying, we're not going to do this song, 
Sounds like you're singing out of a trunk, 
With a stern look in her eye Debbie say’s, 

What’s wrong with you people today choir? 
You don’t drink so you cannot be drunk, 
That song sounded so bad if it was a smell, 
I would have to say you are a Skunk.

Shake off whatever is stuck in your mind, 
Just kick it in the butt and leave it behind, 
I will not stand for this kind of behavior.

Sharpen up those voices and clear your throat, 
I refuse to be held by you as a scapegoat, 
Pay close attention because I want all to know, 
Don’t ever bring that jack near Debbie Lowe.

But we care enough
To say 'I don't care'

My head is bald, 
but I don't care.
I'm not so tall, 
but I don't care.

I'm overworked
and underpaid.
It's been ten years
since I got

sick, and my boss says
'That don't count a lick! '

I'm disapproved, 
misunderstood, 
have all that's bad
and nothing good.

I am so ugly
that I find
that parents shove
their kids behind
their backs to keep
me from shocking
them to sleep.

And then those parents
stand and stare
but I don't care. 

I am proud of the way i grew up, because i ommit myself from bad activities.
I am famous across the world, but i won't forget my background.
The fact is in order to ' know where you are going,
you must know where you are coming from'.
I disindulge myself from crime, drugs, alcohol, teenage pregnancy,
sti's, std's & HIV/AIDS.



I don't know
What to
Call him

But the
Sheer
Pleasure

That his
Writing
Gives me

Makes me
Want to
Call him
A poet seer


For an equilibrium, 
Three forces are needed, 
For equilibrium of my heart, 
The first force is truth, 
And the second is evil, 
And the third force? 
I don't know.


My heart is hungry, 
My heart is thirsty, 
My heart is dirty, 
My heart is a slave, 
Of desires and emotions, 
And my soul! 
I don't know.

I tried to clean, 
I tried to sweep, 
I removed the dust, 
I removed the rust, 
Why so sticky? 
The layer of frust! 
I don't know.

Sometimes I am good, 
Sometimes I am bad, 
Why it's so? 
Someone from inside, 
Replied me dear! 
The third hidden force, 
Is nothing but moderation! 

Extremism is a sin, 
Be moderate, 
Moderation is essence, 
Of ethics at the vertex
Wash it with tears, 
And remove the frust, 
Live carefree.

Who replied me? 
Was it truth in me? 
Or the evil in me, 
Was it my soul? 
I don't know. 

You must be kidding
I don't know rhymes 
I don't know complicated wording 
I don't have a pen 
I haven’t got a paper
It is so boring 
It is too hard 
I've got the flu, I need to see the nurse 
I've got to run, I need to go home 
Time's up? Uh oh! 
All I have is a dumb list of excuses.
You like it? Really? No kidding.
Thanks a lot. Would you like to see another one


I don't Know if history repeats itself
But I do know that you don't.

I remember that city was divided 
Not only between Jews and Arabs,
But Between me and you,
When we were there together.

We made ourselves a womb of dangers
We built ourselves a house of deadening wars
Like men of far north 
Who build themselves a safe warm house of deadening ice.

The city has been reunited
But we haven't been there together.
By now I know
That History doesn't repeat itself, 
As I always knew that you wouldn't. 

I don't know if you're alive or dead.
Can you on earth be sought,
Or only when the sunsets fade
Be mourned serenely in my thought?

All is for you: the daily prayer,
The sleepless heat at night,
And of my verses, the white
Flock, and of my eyes, the blue fire.

No-one was more cherished, no-one tortured
Me more, not
Even the one who betrayed me to torture,
Not even the one who caressed me and forgot. 

In fantasy all is credible
The whole world is wholly edible
The foulest of cheese
Is eaten with ease
Even if it is unspreadablestill I-m quite sure
I am.  an object required
still undefined
surfing an erroneous ground
tapping a shoulderledd slumber
unforeseen url http something
misty sound'I don't like the poems 
with angels' she warns me
every time I want to read her 
some lines.

'why' I ask her
in the end.

'I'm afraid I'll give birth
to a winged child.

'I don't like flowers - they do remind me often
Of funerals, of weddings and of balls; 
Their presence on tables for a dinner calls.

But sub-eternal roses' ever simple charm
Which was my solace when I was a child,
Has stayed - my heritage - a set of years behind,
Like Mozart's ever-living music's hum. 

My sister is someone who I cannot comprehend
Never in my wildest dreams could I ever call her "Friend"
I can easily say we do not get along
She argues, she fights, she hates to be wrong
There’s not much I can say about this relation to me
Other than of her presence I wish to be set free
But if she would go away, I admit I would miss her
What can I say?  After all, she is my sister
There’s nothing I can do! I will always be her brother
No matter how much I deny it, there is still no other
Even though she is behind the worst times ever had
All in all, my sister isn’t that bad
Admitting this to myself, somewhat gives me joy
But still I wonder, "What if she’d been a boy? "The fact is i don't trust anyone, 
hence i have been used by my father.  

I don't want to pretend
things are ok all
people ok all
and that bad things never happen
or happen only to not nice people

I don't want not to see
while you're stirring 
'milk and sugar'coffee spoons of your liquids
galaxies being indifference devoured within 

I don't want to listen any more
to those really nice phrases
capturing sort of subtle air like
concepts of freedom equality and duty free rights
back broken grounded by some really nice pictures

I don't want to downspeed the thoughts
turn them into an instant success
I'll drink my Yes coffee Byzantine style
in no rush cultural No thank you No Ness please manner
because not being Ness nice I might still get
some life long friends

I don't want to take a nice look at the sky
marvel at it regardless the patchwork above
and fill the ozone holes with eye catching
anti hole slogans that make me feel good
about an adequate level of my civilian initiative

I don't want to be swallowed by eyes
I'll eat my food without the brand names
glittering foils and evenly cultivated over sized
shelf categorized bar coded items 

I don't want to be nice


I Don't Want to Die

I don't want to die.
I'm too busy living my lie.
I enjoy my family and friends.
I'm too far too short from the end.
I don't want death and death doesn't want me.
I love life's liberty that sets me free.

This is what I used to let control my head(?) 
The thoughts stopped when I noticed I was dead. 

Despite being your child's mother

Why can't we be together

Hmm.. Let see

You lack trust

I lack love

You have an 'I don't want to hear' attitude when you're mad

You irritate me

I don't want you 

 

You don't want me? ? ? 

After all we have been to each other

I never thought having a baby would bring us together 

You don't want me 

My heart hurts 

Even though I know my worth

My feelings for you are silenced 

My world has become imbalanced


You don't want me and I totally understand 

You don't want me and I wanted was you to be my man

At least we'll be Co parents to our child

You do you while I shall move on with my life

 

I am grateful for my son

For him I will no longer live like this 

Because I love you I wish joyous bliss 

 

I will reverse my emotions 

I will stop this devotion 

This is not a desperate cry

Nor is it a stalkers best kept lie

 

For my son 

I will be strong

For me 

I will do what it takes to be happy 

You can now refer to me as Djalo's mummy

 

I am tired of reminiscing 

About our happy past

I am tired of daydreaming 

About being your last

If you want me.  I still want me


If you cry 
If you hurt inside
I don't care
If you whimper and sigh
If you break someone's heart 
I don't care
If you get high 
If you get in trouble
I don't care 
If you lie
If you die 
I don't care


Your Mother laughs 
And this Lover is dying
Like Death in the cards
Riding a horse into the unknown
Maybe we should ask the High Priestess 
Or your Mother herself
Aphrodite always had a way with beauty
The likes of none other
Not even words

My moon 
My stars
My bright night sky
Did she create you
Vast for the eye to behold
Or did she create you
To illustrate perfected form

I posted guards
At the gates of my heart
And you, Aphrodite’s love child
Walked right through
But that’s just a small comparison
After all

Did Aries sire you
Or was it the Sun
Did the Muses help her do it alone? 
Or did Zeus just let her swallow a star
And there
There and here
You became and were
Here and now
You are

My wind
My air
My breath I need
Did Aeolus purse his lips
And carry you to safety
On wispy lullaby winds
Of the Golden Times

Were the Fates being kind
When they set you on this world
I’d shout yes
From the tops of hundreds of mountains
Because they were kind to me
To let me see
Humming birds and bees
With eyes of honey
Spring with winds of love
For letting me meet
You

And your elusive brother
That Cupid child
Who plays with golden bows
And lead arrows
Runs around us
As child and youths do
But when the arrows graze
They make me fall all over again for you

Does your Mother smile on us? 
Though there has not been much ease
We have no trials like your brother
And Psyche 
Would we go down as well
In their history

Or would we create a new pantheon
A new mythology 
Between us


I don't mind walking an extra mile
I don't mind taking extra care
I don't mind carrying extra burden
I don't mind spending extra time

I don't mind lifting you high
I don't mind turning around
I don't mind jumping down
I don't mind backing up

I don't mind sharing 
I don't mind sticking
I don't mind ringing
I don't mind waiting

I just don't mind loving more- cos it's all for YOUI dreaded that first Robin, so,
But He is mastered, now,
I'm accustomed to Him grown,
He hurts a little, though—

I thought If I could only live
Till that first Shout got by—
Not all Pianos in the Woods
Had power to mangle me—

I dared not meet the Daffodils—
For fear their Yellow Gown
Would pierce me with a fashion
So foreign to my own—

I wished the Grass would hurry—
So—when 'twas time to see—
He'd be too tall, the tallest one
Could stretch—to look at me—

I could not bear the Bees should come,
I wished they'd stay away
In those dim countries where they go,
What word had they, for me?

They're here, though; not a creature failed—
No Blossom stayed away
In gentle deference to me—

Each one salutes me, as he goes,
And I, my childish Plumes,
Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment
Of their unthinking Drums—I dream I am lying in the mud on my back and staring up into the sky.
Which do I prefer, since I have the power to fly into the blue slate of
air? It is summer. I decide quickly that by lying face up I have a view
of the sky I could not get by flying in it, while I'd be missing the mud. 

I dream a world where man
No other man will scorn,
Where love will bless the earth
And peace its paths adorn
I dream a world where all
Will know sweet freedom's way,
Where greed no longer saps the soul
Nor avarice blights our day.
A world I dream where black or white,
Whatever race you be,
Will share the bounties of the earth
And every man is free,
Where wretchedness will hang its head
And joy, like a pearl,
Attends the needs of all mankind-
Of such I dream, my world

I dream a world where there's no war, 
no suffering, crying, sorrow.
I dream a world where all are rich, 
a man needs nothing to borrow.

I dream a world- there's no hatred; 
both Love and Peace run there their rule.
I dream a world full of delight, 
smile and smell- the most beautiful.

I dream a world where no children
and the disabled cry for alms, 
where all men live equally, 
all are for peace always welcome.

I dream a world where no woman
is tortured and no virgin raped, 
no acid-throwing on a girl's face
deforms, our daughters' lives are safe. 

I DREAM'D in a dream, I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the
         whole of the rest of the earth;
   I dream'd that was the new City of Friends;
   Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love--it led the
         rest;
   It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city,
   And in all their looks and words. 

Hung amid my daily routines 
Deaf to noises around, 
To dream. 
Putting my darling kids
To sleep fast, 
To dream, 
Forcing my stubborn eyes to sleep, 
Off the TV screen, 
To dream. 
Dragging my depressed mind to sleep, 
Off the PC monitor, 
To dream. 
I shut my eyes tight, 
To sleep deep, 
To dream, 
I dream.  

yes, 
I dream, dream and dream. 
To escape into
Fairy worlds of Alice? 
Or Utopia of
Everlasting happiness
And tranquility sans, 
Troubles and hassles! 
A fairy land of-
My dreams come true
I slide down the rainbow
Swinging on a glistening
Rope of rain drops, 
Up the heavens I reach
And down reverse, 
Fairies pushing me 
From rear side, 
Above a serene stream
Of placid waters
With fish applauding to my 
Ecstasy and birds chirping
As reply to my melody; 
Butterflies kissing me
On my face printing
Their colours onto me; 
With peacocks dancing
To my tweets so sweet; 
A land of never ending 
Happiness and peace, 
Floating am I in ecstasy
Free from worries, 
I dream dream and dream, 
Hearing my favourite album, 
Smiling broad, 
I wriggle, 
I wriggle towards
The melody only to, 
My obedient mobile, 
Waking me up to 
The morning alarm
Singing my favourite number; 
Back to reality of harshness-
Swirling like a wound top

Watch me as I evoke fury
I’m walking the tightrope in my sleep
Watch me act as judge and jury
Cloaked in peace I slowly creep

Breached defenses, safe house cracked
Treaty signed yet I attack
Ally turns to mortal foe
Where life wont venture, dreams will go

Encouraged by lust for power and wealth
The seeds for carnage have been sown 
A master race of myself
My isolated fear has grown

Breached defenses, safe house cracked
The people slain the city sacked
Ally turns to mortal foe
In blackened field where poppies grow

Outrage vented in my direction
Moral high ground has been lost
The people demand reparation
Conquest achieved, but at high cost

Breached defenses, safe house cracked
Defenders rally to attack
Ally turns to mortal foe
Within my dreams the blood will flow


There is a dream
Of rushing wind
And riding o’er 
The growing green

There is a hope
That rises in the heart
Of flowing manes
And pounding hooves

There is an idea
Of roaming the plain
Just you and your horse
Free and wild

There is a story 
Of horses and glory-
But now I am awake
And the dream is gone

There is a dream
That I wake up from
That I long to return to
And fly again


When I lay down to sleep
Visions of running horses, 
In my slumber so deep, 
Gallop through my mind

I dream of running my hand
Through the silky mane
Fingertips feeling every strand
Of that long black hair

I picture myself on his back
My face pressed into his neck
The wind pulling my hair back
As the dream goes on-Girls even dream of fathers
Not just of their young lovers! 
Let me fly on my own
The world around be unknown

I know father you will hold me
Force of gravity may even flee.
Want a smile on your lips
While you give all your tips.

Smile and love, love me endless
What I mean, can you guess? 
Bear with me and my mess
Add not to my utter stress. 

I dream with my eyes open
Of the life I wish to live
And myself, I must believe

I dream with my eyes open
For the lover far away
Whose words of love, with my heart do play

I dream with my eyes open
Of journeying well on this path
‘Though stones and thorns will scrape o’er some parts

I dream with my eyes open
To walk under a benevolent sun
Feeling warm and mellow

I dream with my eyes open
To find the reason I’m here
And in that call, relish every day, my dear

I dream with my eyes open
That when its time to go
I bid adieu, when I’ve done what I had to here


I dreamed I already loved you.
I dreamed I already killed you.

But you rose again; another form, but you, 
a girl on the little ball of the earth, 
naive simplicity, curve-necked
on that early canvas of Picasso, 
and prayed to me with your ribs: 
'Love me, ' as though you said, 'Don't push me off.'

I'm that played-out, grown-up acrobat, 
hunchbacked with senseless muscles, 
who knows that advice is a lie, 
that sooner or later there's falling.

I'm too scared to say: 'I love you, '
because I'd be saying: 'I'll kill you.'

For in the depths of a face I can see through
I see the faces-can't count them-
that, right on the spot, or maybe
not right away, I tortured to death.

You're pale from the mortal balance. You say: 
'I know everything; I was all of them.
I know you've already loved me.
I know you've already killed me.
But I won't spin the globe backwards: 
Love again, and then kill again.'

I'm tired of killing. I'm not a damn thing but old.

You move the earth beneath your little feet, 
you fall, 'Love me.'
It's only in those eyes, so similar, you say: 
'This time don't kill me! '


In converse with sweet women long since dead;
And out of blossoms which that meadow yields
I wove a garland for your living head.
Danai, that was the vessel for a day
Of golden Jove, I saw, and at her side,
Whom Jove the Bull desired and bore away,
Europa stood, and the Swan's featherless bride.
All these were mortal women, yet all these
Above the ground had had a god for guest;
Freely I walked beside them and at ease,
Addressing them, by them again addressed,
And marvelled nothing, for remembering you,
Wherefore I was among them well I knew. 

I opened the casement this morn at starlight,
And, the moment I got out of bed,
The daisies were quaking about in their white
And the cowslip was nodding its head.
The grass was all shivers, the stars were all bright,
And Robin that should come at e'en--
I thought that I saw him, a ghost by moonlight,
Like a stalking horse stand on the green.

I went bed agen and did nothing but dream
Of Robin and moonlight and flowers.
He stood like a shadow transfixed by a stream,
And I couldn't forget him for hours.
I'd just dropt asleep when I dreamed Robin spoke,
And the casement it gave such a shake,
As if every pane in the window was broke;
Such a patter the gravel did make.

So I up in the morning before the cock crew
And to strike me a light I sat down.
I saw from the door all his track in the dew
And, I guess, called 'Come in and sit down.'
And one, sure enough, tramples up to the door,
And who but young Robin his sen?
And ere the old folks were half willing to stir
We met, kissed, and parted agen. 

I dreamt of sunshine in water pools
Of drops and ripples smiling though undone
Of a moonlit Luna and her ancient fools
Barking at the newly born sun

I dreamt of people their hands and eyes
Of sunscraped glitter flashing through the storm
I burn each time when somebody dies
Again to light up again to be born

I dreamt of my Aprils my springs and risen words
To clay dead live in the skies above
I know I'm alive for it still hurts
To live here again knowing there's no love

In someone else's dream to see
Someone else's vision to be


I dreamt too much and lived too little. 
And yet, in dreams I lived the most; 
All that life made non-permissible, 
With whole my heart in dream, I felt it most; 
Though what I lived was just illusion, 
Yet, how can I tell what is delusion? 

By now, I'm older than I am, a little: 
I've lived a life in joy completely, 
And we fulfilled the unfinished dream, my lovely! 
The angelic fruit of our love is little: 
It grows in love, embodying us in future, 
We hold each other's soul in nurture.

I dreamt too much and lived too little. 
And yet, in dreams I lived the most; 
All that life made non-permissible, 
Has been alive in mind, in form of ghost. 
O, no! It is not a tragedy! —
Just my dream's reality.I dwell in Possibility—
A fairer House than Prose—
More numerous of Windows—
Superior—for Doors—

Of Chambers as the Cedars—
Impregnable of Eye—
And for an Everlasting Roof
The Gambrels of the Sky—

Of Visitors—the fairest—
For Occupation—This—
The spreading wide of narrow Hands
To gather Paradise—I edged my smile on the limits of your tomb
each time I kissed our cross made of stone
heated by summer rays drying the flowers I brought
I know you're there and you can hear my thought
I know you'd urge me to dance with fire and sing
I know for it's our way for a death to be fought
for a life to be lived and a skin to be bought
I know you dead and me alive - we're the same thing


I am not able to speak sometimes.
My prayers are engulfed in deep silence.
I do not utter a word in prayer.
Just being in your presence 
is my prayer and it is beautiful.
I enjoy those silent moments
in which I feel your presence.


I envy Seas, whereon He rides—
I envy Spokes of Wheels
Of Chariots, that Him convey—
I envy Crooked Hills

That gaze upon His journey—
How easy All can see
What is forbidden utterly
As Heaven—unto me!

I envy Nests of Sparrows—
That dot His distant Eaves—
The wealthy Fly, upon His Pane—
The happy—happy Leaves—

That just abroad His Window
Have Summer's leave to play—
The Ear Rings of Pizarro
Could not obtain for me—

I envy Light—that wakes Him—
And Bells—that boldly ring
To tell Him it is Noon, abroad—
Myself—be Noon to Him—

Yet interdict—my Blossom—
And abrogate—my Bee—
Lest Noon in Everlasting Night—
Drop Gabriel—and Me—It never was again
When on insistence love germinated
Like incense it breaths its attitude
The aroma in the hairs when touched
With lips for a kiss before it goes
Deeper to the glandular chemistry
I am like a sculpture conveying deep cuts
Stone eyes and helpless arms
Again the rose blossomed
The red tulip cup so deep
The offerings are just one time
Happenings once out of sight
Out of mind love goes to come
Memories haunt but it is proved
In rush of hour when time lets nothing
The ordinariness exposed when unveiled
The statue sits alone when days of holiness
Gone and he is weeping for bygone days
In the garden when autumn takes away
Wailing is but the fortune on the flower
The corner of the holy wall as I place
The enrichment is like wine in my blood
To the dawn or dusk in the moon 
I exist or I do not exist or I exist 
Not to exist or I do not exist to exist
I have no answer
Though you never know I am here, 
I wish somehow you look my way.
Perhaps you will see me at same corner.
I will always be here until you find.

Though you don’t know where I am.
Or doesn’t know that I am existing, 
I’m still, stay the same waiting.
Always be holding on until u came.

Even if you’re coming be too late, 
It doesn’t mean that I’d forget.
My existence will not be fulfilled.
Not until the time you’ve seen me.

Even this too all may an illusion, 
I’ll never be cease for it to ask.
I’m hoping you’d realize that I exist.
And you’re so real to be mine. 

I explain the silvered passing of a ship at night, 
The sweep of each sad lost wave, 
The dwindling boom of the steel thing's striving, 
The little cry of a man to a man, 
A shadow falling across the greyer night, 
And the sinking of the small star; 
Then the waste, the far waste of waters, 
And the soft lashing of black waves 
For long and in loneliness. 

Remember, thou, O ship of love, 
Thou leavest a far waste of waters, 
And the soft lashing of black waves 
For long and in loneliness. 

I faint, I perish with my love! I grow
Frail as a cloud whose [splendours] pale
Under the evening's ever-changing glow:
I die like mist upon the gale,
And like a wave under the calm I fail


There is some confusion underneath
Some doubts, some questions lying beneath
Some things which make me tumble down
And that is the point when I FALL DOWN
 
There is some point of time
When all problems cut their mime
Each second just deepens the wound
And that's the second when I FALL DOWN
 
Wait a second, you know what I think? 
Life has become so bore, just in a blink
Just a moment back, I was walking in a lawn
Lightning struck me and I did FALL DOWN
 
Why didn't everything happen as I expected? 
Why did you break my heart just when it started beating? 
Oh pretty lady, you must be so proud after annihilating
Why the efforts didn't count, "They weren't enough"? 
Oh Mr. Perfect is the journey of our dreams that tough? 
Situation my friend! It makes the king loose his crown
It makes me bow and I FALL DOWN
 
 
After all this trauma, I wonder why aren't I dead? 
Even after breaking bones, tearing muscles and all bloodshed
I've started collecting broken pieces and rising on new ground
And that's the reason, I REFUSE TO FALL DOWNwhat i fear  are these
ones called homo sapiens 
more than aliens


I fear I will be lost one day
In this bitter world's way
From where I will never find
Even myself or the peace of mind
I need some peace and some place
To sit and look for the happiness trace
And hope to get for me some
Breath of fresh air to numb
My injured mind and my soul
So peacefully I can live in the bowl
The bowl of death to sleep in the care

I fear a Man of frugal Speech—
I fear a Silent Man—
Haranguer—I can overtake—
Or Babbler—entertain—

But He who weigheth—While the Rest—
Expend their furthest pound—
Of this Man—I am wary—
I fear that He is Grand—As I usually do, 
I've spent my morning 
Thinking of you; 
Obsessively repeating, 
Repeating your words: 

" You mentioned that dreams do come true

" —
O, my darling! Dreams do come true! 

As a mad woman, 
Frenetically waiting, 
Waiting for a ghost; 
For a ghost to appear.

And I fear- I fear. 
That you may never appear.

After all these years, 
I'm so used to it, 
That it became my daily routine; 

And I fear, my darling- I fear-
That you may never appear.

I've heard your words today, 
Then I saw you at mid-day; 
I saw you smiling, looking at me; 
O, I saw you! I saw you today! 

"You mentioned that dreams do come true

" —
O, my darling! Dreams do come true! 

But if you only knew, 
How I forced myself — and intentionally 
I turned my face away from you.

For I fear, my darling.  I fear-
That you may never appear; 

Oh! I fear- I fear. 
That I may no longer be your dream. 

Lost
Alone
Sad
Unhappy
Not smiling anymore
Just so. .. 

alone
sigh
Tears fall
as they cascade down
I feel so. . 

tired of it all
Of just being. 
Does that make sense. 
Perhaps not
Hmmm.  

have a good night


When morning wears crown, 
with white light of early dawn 
When the sun goes down, 
and day removes its gown 
When night shows frown, 
and stars brighten up their town 

i feel alone 
i feel alone 

When quaking eve arrives, i bemoan 
there in no one of my own 
When tantalizing spring, 
glamorizes the lawn 
Ah! all the desires, now have flown 
None to reckon upon 
like a bird, being tied to pinion 

i feel alone 
i feel alone 

'In fall season, 
when storms rigadoon
to me, no shelter is known
not any shoulder to rest on
When cuckoo sings, 
in summer's morn
Indeed! I am hapless and forlorn
Life always glares with scorn'

I feel alone
I feel alone

alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alonealone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alone


I feel horrible. She doesn't 
love me and I wander around
like a sewing machine
that's just finished sewing
a turd to a garbage can lid. 

You're the first overwhelming feeling that engulfs me
When I wake up to behold the dawn that has come
I feel you in the rays of light that seep in slowly
Through my curtain blinds, straight to my dimmed eyes
I see you through the leaves that would always sway
And sometimes bow in awe of your stunning beauty
I breathe you in the air that I inhale into my nose
You've got the fragrance of a perfumed, red rose
I feel, I see, I breathe you just to stay alive

And when I retire to my bed at night to think and sleep
Your feelings untamed run deeper and deeper in my heart
I feel you in my irregular rapid and violent heartbeats
You bring intense joy and satisfaction to my peaceful mind
I see you, you are right there, up and high in the skies
The galaxies are but a reflection of your shiny pupils
I breathe you in the sea breeze that brings so much warmth
I feel, I see, I breathe you, so don't take your breath away


Nobody cares for flowers.
Nobody cares for birds.
 
Nobody wants to believe that Little Garden is dying,
Nobody wants to believe that Little Garden’s heart-
is swollen in this parching heat.
 
Nobody wants to know that Little Garden's mind-
is slowly losing its green past.
 
And it seems that Little Garden's sense is a distinct piece,
perishing fast, in the isolating scent of the air.
 
Our courtyard is feeling lonely.
Our courtyard is yawning-
in hope of a possible visit from a raining cloud.
 
Our pool is drained.
And young, tiny leaves-
are collapsing from the heights of the trees.
 
And from the pastel windows of the cage,
song of the birds breaks suddenly-
into the attacks of coughing.
Our courtyard is feeling lonely.
 
 
My father says:
"I am done with life,
I am done with life and I did my work."
 
In his room, all day long-
he is reading history and poems.
 
He tells my mom:
"Who cares about upkeep of the yard?
I am ill and old and my pension-pay, is just to carry on."
 
My mother’s entire life is a prayer book,
spread at the doors of fright of Hell.
My mother is looking every where-
for the blessed parts of things.
 
She thinks that Little Garden is spoiled by a depraved plant.
My mom is gifted with tons of innate sins.
She has to pray every day to save her restless soul.
 
She sends blessing to flowers and birds,
She sends blessing to me, my sister and herself,
She is longing for the resurrection day-
and Divine Pardon that will descend.
 
 
My brother calls Little Garden "Graveyard".
My brother laughs at the chaos of the lawn-
He is counting the bloated bodies of birds,
My brother is addicted to Philosophy.
 
My brother knows:  to salvage Little Garden,
we must wipe it out, as soon as we can!
 
My bother gets drunk,
My brother blows up mirrors,
plates and painting frames.
 
He is trying so hard, so hard, so hard to show-
that he is very desperate, sad and drawn.
 
He takes his ID, his lighter, and his despair-
to streets, to bistros and to shops.
His despair is so tiny that every night,
it gets lost in the crowd of a bar.
 
My sister was friend with flowers and birds.
When my mother was mad, wanted to scold her,
she was hiding behind the green mass of the trees.
She loved to keep company of wounded, unwell birds.
 
My sister is living in uptown now.
Now, she has a sham house,
Now, she has an artificial plant.
She stays with her fake husband,
They listen to synthetic music,
And they will make lots of natural kids.
 
My sister comes to visit.
She doesn’t like dusts of Little Garden.
She always brings perfumed, hydrating creams.
 
 
Our courtyard is feeling lonely.
Our courtyard is feeling lonely.
The whole day, it sounds like razing and hammering:
Our neighbors are implanting mines in their field,
Our neighbors are mounting a safety cover for their pool,
Our neighbors’ basement looks like a secret arsenal base.
Our neighbor’s children are fighting with noisy guns and bombs.
Our courtyard is feeling scared.
 
And I am scared of this Heartless Time.
I am scared of all those Wasted Hands.
I am scared of all these Stranger Heads.
I am so lonely, like a nerd in Math Class.
 
I think we have to bring Little Garden to the clinic.
I think-
I think-
I think-
And Little Garden’s heart is swollen in this parching heat.
And Little Garden’s mind is slowly losing its green past.
 
 
T
My  soul is mellow
The  hues  of  this eve sallow
And  the old moon a queer
Shade  of yellow.

Your life seems to be drifting
On  a stream so silent
That  my breathing seems labored
My  heartbeats clamored
My  pulse like a hammer
Against  the cool routine
Of  your  dispassion.

Did  i tell you I’m dying dear? 
Did  that not come up
In  the course of the conversation
We  were having over dinner? 
Oh  don’t bother to waste a tear
I  shall not linger longer
Than  your patience
Could  persevere
I  know how things
Out  of the commonplace
Irk  you so very much, my dear
And  so, I’ve made it clear
To  my doctor, Peter Peirce, 
That  no ventilator 
Or  resuscitation required, 
No  chances at life needed here.


to the apathy and loveless  years of a stale marriage.  

i see it happen and i dread ever having to feel that kind of apathy for a loved one. 

life is so cruel


I feel so alone
I feel so out of place
something is wrong
and won't go away
please save me
from this thought
save me from this
save me from me

As I was resting I could feel your arms
around me and you smiling squeezing me tight
and it felt so very good warming my soul and heart.
Your love is so strong and abundant 
it can overwhelm and in the best way possible.
I could feel your arms and smile.
I love you sweet lady you truly are spectacular.

I can feel you here with me hand in hand
all the loving care and warmth you hold, 
I can also smell your hair and feel
you lying here right next to me.
Darling you truly are an amazing blessing
and I'm so thankful for you endlessly.

I feel and know within my heart that in spirit
we knew each other long before we came to earth, 
we clicked so very fast and I can count on
one hand alone how often I've encountered that, 
sweet darling I was in love with you before I even realized it.
I could feel from then you were the woman
I would always want and need.

So to this day I feel our bond so strong
and your beautiful spirit next to me, 
I feel a love so immense and deep, truly profound.
I can feel your hand in mine you're here with me, 
I love you deeply and I feel your love in full as well, 
Oh my sweet darling I'll feel this way forever
and I want to spend forever by your precious side. 

I did not know what you meant
When you said you feel my soul
What you saw of me was just a fragment
Thus to even know me was impossible

You said "My Dear, don’t dictate
What I think or feel about you"
Oh Wow! Must be the image you create
An illusion away from truth you construe

But when you went inside my dream
You remained in my mind like the rain
I hear you I feel you though it seem
And we don’t even exist on the same plane

Now I say "Oh dear, I feel you too"
No matter where you are or even no longer here
Feeling your soul is like I am with you
How was it possible I can still taste your tear? 

Now you are in my heart and feeling your soul
This is the only time I can be with you
The universe you created remained in control
Even if you are lost forever, I can still hold you


In my tearful dreams
I saw the path of light.
Lead me to the abode of love.
Let me sit and rest for a while. 

My lips longed for his kisses
I spoke of my deepest longings
I saw my beloved
Walking slowly to me like a fairy.

In the ecstasy of love 
Joy tremendous filled my mind. 
I fell into the arms of my beloved
And my heart danced to his rhythms. 

I felt a cleaving in my mind
   As if my brain had split;
I tried to match it, seam by seam,
   But could not make them fit.

The thought behind I strove to join
   Unto the thought before,
But sequence ravelled out of reach
   Like balls upon a floor. 

I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
And Mourners to and fro
Kept treading--treading--till it seemed
That Sense was breaking through-- 

And when they all were seated,
A Service, like a Drum-- 
Kept beating--beating--till I thought
My Mind was going numb-- 

And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul
With those same Boots of Lead, again,
Then Space--began to toll,

As all the Heavens were a Bell,
And Being, but an Ear,
And I, and Silence, some strange Race
Wrecked, solitary, here--

And then a Plank in Reason, broke,
And I dropped down, and down-- 
And hit a World, at every plunge,
And Finished knowing--then--I felt his fragrance on my lips.
I slept.
Deep was my sleep.
He came in when the moon shone
to sit near me.

He touched my eyebrows softly.
He saw my eyelashes sleeping.
He kissed me 
on my sleeping lips.

The morning rays 
shower me with its glory.
I wake up.

I feel his fragrance on my lips, 
on my eyebrows, 
on my eyelashes.

(This is a mystical experience. a mystic expresses it in human terms) .

The snow on my shoes melted
Now, my socks, feet and toes were wet
It had been colder	
But today, I felt it! 
Ignored in the past, knowing it wouldn’t last
I shrugged off such things
But today I shivered
I felt it
I wanted it to end
A few more steps and I would be inside
But as I reached the door
I paused
Only four months ago I sweltered
Leaves shuddered in hot breezes
In this same spot, I saw the heat rise in waves
Now, white was the uniform
Seven steps into the yard
I made a snow angel
The snow angel made me
For that moment
Cold as the North, I came inside
It took a while
But I warmed up
I felt it allI felt my life with both my hands
To see if it was there—
I held my spirit to the Glass,
To prove it possibler—

I turned my Being round and round
And paused at every pound
To ask the Owner's name—
For doubt, that I should know the Sound—

I judged my features—jarred my hair—
I pushed my dimples by, and waited—
If they—twinkled back—
Conviction might, of me—

I told myself, "Take Courage, Friend—
That—was a former time—
But we might learn to like the Heaven,
As well as our Old Home!"I find my self alone
cold and in the dark
I find my self in tears
all because of this pain
I find my self thinking
I can do better than this
I find my self loseing
the battle to get to you
I find my self in a dream
this is all not real


I find no peace, and all my war is done. 
I fear and hope. I burn and freeze like ice. 
I fly above the wind, yet can I not arise;
And nought I have, and all the world I season.
That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison 
And holdeth me not--yet can I scape no wise-- 
Nor letteth me live nor die at my device, 
And yet of death it giveth me occasion.
Without eyen I see, and without tongue I plain.
I desire to perish, and yet I ask health.
I love another, and thus I hate myself.
I feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain;
Likewise displeaseth me both life and death,
And my delight is causer of this strife. 

I know it's wrong to feel this way.
I lack of you, but can not say.
In your bed I'm dead.
We're dead.
To this bed I wed.
I fled. 

Jean Paul, a contemporary of Goethe, had a  dream.

He writes about his dream: 
I walked through the worlds.
 I climbed into the sun 
and flew on the Milky Way
 across the deserts of the sky; 

I climbed down, 
to look into the abyss 
and shouted: Father, where are you? 

But I heard only the eternal storm
 that no one ruled, 
and saw the shimmering rainbow
without a sun that creates a rainbow
over the abyss and dripped down.

And when I looked up 
to the immeasurable world 
for the divine eye, 
she stared at me 
with a blank bottomless eye socket; 
 and eternity was in  chaos.

And he was glad when he woke up: 
'My soul wept for joy' he writes, 
and the joy and the crying 
in faith  was  prayer.'



The birdie chirped on decorative sheet, 
In the sky the roar has begun, has gone a downpour, 
From fear she became mute. 
But air was present such charm, 
She has again wanted to fly -
And on wings the wind she has appeared on a cloud, 
`I fly! ' 
She again and again was enticed.  

Life's celestial shores
Traps me! Like prison bars
I fall as a victim
To it's bitter roots
Struggling, fighting
To swallow some juice
Behind life's doors
I wear the black  suit
Sadness sits on their face
Like birds I fly away
To a land of gladness
Where joy never ends.





June h Feeling
Recalling times
I forget
The instances
The spirit
The mindset
Sensation
Emotion disperses
Ambience evaporates
Facts remain
A subtle cue
Happenings morph
To tales of tales
A story read? 
An anecdote heard? 
A movie watched? 
Dreamlike, artificial
Recollection mocks
Tantalizes, manipulates
The periodic chart
I committed
The human bones
I memorized
Fifty some years of facts
Infused indelibly
But I forget experiences
I forget

For what I did openly, 
and what I did secretly, 
What I got I in aurora of a dawn, 
I didn't see in that of dusk, 
I lost beauty with the sweats, 
sweats melted the color 
you gave to my face, 
where is my glace, 
where is my grace, 
ahead of me is a night, 
whether a dark night, 
or a moon lit night, 
I don't know, 
so I forgive every one, 
who gave me pains, 
and in return 
I hope the same, 
I know lives 
that have senses to feel pains, 
if forgive me, 
from my conscience, 
that is how He forgives us, 
I am hopeful 
I shall sleep 
with a neat and clean conscious, 
this neatness 
this cleanliness 
will get in my sub conscious 
and from there to my unconscious, 
with a holy ego 
I shall hug and kiss my super ego, 
and through out the night, 
I don't know 
how long it would be, 
I shall dream of beauty, 
beauty that leads to love, 
love that leads to peace, 
I am hopeful of a pleasant sleep, 
till an eternal dawn, 
with aurora 
that will not melt with sweats, 
so I forgive every one, 
who gave me pains, 
not because I am a saint, 
I am a selfish man, 
I forgive every one
because 
I need the same from others

Slap! 
I never do anything wrong
even though I don't you hit me all day long
Slap! 
you just hit me again till I'm black and blue
all just because I looked at you
Slap! 
you hit me hard across the face
screaming at me saying I'm a disgrace
Slap! 
you hit me again just because I asked you why
why do you shout ugly words at me
why do you wish I would die
Slap! 
you never hear my screams
you always break my dreams
you never hear my beg
you throw me against the wall and break my leg
Slap! 
you hit me for talking back
you hit me so hard I heard a crack
Slap! 
Daddy I don't care what you do
I will always love you
I can no longer make a sound
For now I'm buried in the ground
Even though now I look down upon you from above
I will always send you my love
Oh daddy I love you but I wish you would learn
your supposed to look at a child with love but your look is so stern
But remember what I told you daddy before I died
I don't care daddy what you do
I will always love you


The stereo was on as I sat down to write
I had more ideas than in the last five days combined
After just a few clumsy pecks on the keyboard
A song from my youth came on
My fingers came to an abrupt halt
As the melody and lyrics transfixed me
Time stood still
No, it was in retrograde
I don’t remember anything else
Except, as it ended, I roused with a gasp
I forgot to breathe


Life is a matter of choices
made at every fork in the road, 
and none made for an easy way
to carry or lighten the load.
But I’ve been strong, 
carried on through the fog of life; 
able to say
I fought the good fight, 
did my very best, 
triumphed over my fears 
and laid them all to rest.
I’ve made my share of mistakes, 
but by my choices I still stand, 
for in all my chosen paths, 
reaching out to guide and comfort
in each and every day, 
and in all my darkest hours, 
that grace has shone the way. 

I considered the sunset
While listening to the whitecaps
And thinking of home
I found a poem


I found a sweet secret
to tuck deep inside, 
When you told me
my precious friend
that we will be best buds
for now and evermore.

I looked often around
to find my heart's yearning.
No one can live alone in this world.
Friendship should come from
deep within the heart.
Your wonderful friendship 
means so much to me.

For there's little that lasts.
So much fades away.

I found her out there
On a slope few see,
That falls westwardly
To the sharp-edged air,
Where the ocean breaks
On the purple strand,
And the hurricane shakes
The solid land.


I brought her here,
And have laid her to rest
In a noiseless nest
No sea beats near.
She will never be stirred
In her loamy cell
By the waves long heard
And loved so well.


So she does not sleep
By those haunted heights
The Atlantic smites
And the blind gales sweep,
Whence she often would gaze
At Dundagel's far head,
While the dipping blaze
Dyed her face fire-red;


And would sigh at the tale
Of sunk Lyonnesse,
While a wind-tugged tress
Flapped her cheek like a flail;
Or listen at whiles
With a thought-bound brow
To the murmuring miles
She is far from now.


Yet her shade, maybe,
Will glide underground
Till it catch the sound
Of that western sea
As it swells and sobs
Where she once domiciled,
And joy in its throbs
With the heart of a child. 

I found love in a strange place
A place I never thought it would be
but it seemed to have proven me wrong
For love has already caught me

Its indescribable way
of showing up unexpected
making me believe in faith
and destiny to be corrected.

It's drifting me in a different direction
Opposite of what I've known
For so many years I've been hiding
in the feeling of being alone.

Always been anonymous
and sheltering myself from love
but it's impossible to keep inside
and I've been suffering enough

I want the whole world to know
To experience what I've found
For love has a strange way
Of always coming around.

I found love in a strange place
A place I never thought it would be
but it seemed to have proven me wrong
For love has already caught me. 

I painted in orange and red colours
with fiery power of passion
Your face 
on the canvas of my heart.

In your warmth
you illuminated my being always.
In unspoiled white
In serene purity
gently
you kissed me into ecstasy.

My rainy tears of joy
flew down silently 
and washed me.

Loosing in your love 
I found myself. 

I found the phrase to every thought
I ever had, but one;
And that defies me,--as a hand
Did try to chalk the sun

To races nurtured in the dark;--
How would your own begin?
Can blaze be done in cochineal,
Or noon in mazarin

to a Daughter or a Son 
My blessing to you is under your mothers feet. 

When I made a mother  she had to be special.
I made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world, 
Yet gentle enough to care and  comfort you. 

I gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth
And the rejection that many times comes from her children! ! ! 

I gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going
 when you and everyone else gives up, 
And take care of her family through sickness and fatigue 
without complaint

I gave her the sensitivity to love her children 
under any and all circumstances, 
I gave her strength to carry her son  through his faults 
But sometimes tests her strengths 
And her resolve to stand beside you  when you done
.
I gave her  tears to shed
This is hers exclusively to use whenever shes hurting and sad


The beauty of a  mother  is not in the clothes she wears
The figure that she carries 
Or the way she combs her hair

The beauty of a mother is the care and the love in her eyes
My blessing to you is under your mothers feet.
That's the doorway to her heart 
The place where her love for you resides.

Salma torrez. 

I gave my heart to a woman –
I gave it her, branch and root.
She bruised, she wrung, she tortured,
She cast it under foot.

Under her feet she cast it,
She trampled it where it fell,
She broke it all to pieces,
And each was a clot of hell.

There in the rain and the sunshine
They lay and smouldered long;
And each, when again she viewed them,
Had turned to a living song. 

Since I met you for the very first time
My heart began to tinkle just like a chime
As I looked into your eyes so deep and true
It was then I knew it was just me and you
I gave you my heart

We knew there were times we would have to part
When this happened we'd make a brand new start
The love we shared was deep just like the ocean
Captured by its spell and dipped in its potion
I gave you my heart

When we are together time seems to stand still 
Being with one another is our greatest thrill
Can't wait until tomorrow until we meet again
Same place, same time, whether sunshine or rain
I gave you my heart





It's close to the anniversary of my mum and dad passing on

Sigh-miss them both-love them so much

(Tears form in my eyes-woe


it's getting easier now when I remember them now I just smile) 

This is for my Mum.  

Matalena George and My Father Vaine George.  

smiles. 

and was really lost the other day for awhile.
In my work to get better if I begin
to feel frustrated I must immediately back off.
It's to help cool my jets so I don't
burst into flames in an unnecessary way
just hurting others in my way.
In all that's surrounded me I got confused.

I'm so sorry I'm so stupid at times, 
my mind just spins around so fast with
the bipolar I can easily get lost.
I know you have seen it though I
most likely never told you or explained it.
I take full blame for that 
oversight and I'm filled with shame.

All I can say is I get scared and confused, 
especially when I think and 
feel I've done something wrong.
The methods I may have to use at times for
my improved temper and its cooled down demeanor
will need explaining or they 
can be up front offending.
I'm so sorry sweet one I just 
so often feel confused
and I feel ashamed with myself 
always because I deeply love you. 

Used and abandoned, ill sit in this chair
And cry my tears softly so no one can hear

Tired of bein used and hurt beyond repair, 
Life has lost all meaning, why am I still here? 

I work all day, I work all night
Homework and lonliness, all that’s left in my life

A love I cant hold, a life that’s not real
And even then, there’s nothing I feel

So ill sit all alone, as my life rolls on by
With my feelings my enemy, all I can ask is why? 

When he gets what he wants, he soon is gone
And I’ve stopped caring whats wrong or whats right

Apparently  forever means only one night
But who cares? ‘cuz there’s nothing left in my life

Live for today cuz tomorrow’s a mirror image
Once and for all, my love is lost in the distance

Im exhausted, tired of being tired, 
Today, tomorrow, yesterday, all just a blur

When without even a drink, my words start to slur

I used to rhyme, with rhythm and wit, 
But here I sit, alone and lost in me

Where am I? Who am I? 
Where am I going? Where have I been? 

I’m lost and confused-
All I need is a friend. 

I turn around on the gravel
and go back to the house for a book,
something to read at the doctor’s office,
and while I am inside, running the finger
of inquisition along a shelf,
another me that did not bother
to go back to the house for a book
heads out on his own,
rolls down the driveway,
and swings left toward town,
a ghost in his ghost car,
another knot in the string of time,
a good three minutes ahead of me—
a spacing that will now continue
for the rest of my life.
Sometimes I think I see him
a few people in front of me on a line
or getting up from a table
to leave the restaurant just before I do,
slipping into his coat on the way out the door.
But there is no catching him,
no way to slow him down
and put us back in synch,
unless one day he decides to go back
to the house for something,
but I cannot imagine
for the life of me what that might be.
He is out there always before me,
blazing my trail, invisible scout,
hound that pulls me along,
shade I am doomed to follow,
my perfect double,
only bumped an inch into the future,
and not nearly as well-versed as I
in the love poems of Ovid—
I who went back to the house
that fateful winter morning and got the book. 

Pelican blues, jay walking on velvet souls
Somber and detach, mayhem
Pickering the night of pre dawn
The choir of your anger, screaming
In tune to the decaying sounds
Of the strings Silverado
Ascending in D Minor
Descending in G Major
Flavor never a waiver
Impacts--


heart raptures
"Come and sway with me, " the voices say
"Absorb my tone, within the tone, 
You’ll hear the grumble mumble"
Sudden death and numb
The rhythm retires
The blues in dire
What come next will be your desperados
Attach the strings to your yester hellos
Soulful revival
My guitar humbles
The plucking and strumming
Erode-


to your gravely swing


Nothing I'm doing is right
I guess I'm just losing sight
Everything went so wrong
I can't take it I can still stay strong
I want to thank you for the pain
Never will I take back the memorie in the rain
Sisters forever I thought we would always be
Maybe the truth was just something I didn't want to see
You hurt me most out of all
You were the one I never thought would let me fall
My hearts slowly going cold
Its funny how things start to unfold
You know so many things are running through my head
My life feels ever so very dead
Without you its hard to breath
The feeling is worse than death
People tell me best freind last forever
Now I think thats bullshit! forever is more like NEVER! 
I don't want to hear anymore fucking lies
I can't take all these never ending cries! 
My love is turnd to hate! 
YOu can't take it back ITS to LAte! 
I'm done I'm through
I can't going thought this over and over again with you
There's not place for me here
I have got to go somewhere
No more fearful dreams
I hate this I just want to scream

I GRIEVED for Buonaparte, with a vain
And an unthinking grief! The tenderest mood
Of that Man's mind--what can it be? what food
Fed his first hopes? what knowledge could 'he' gain?
'Tis not in battles that from youth we train
The Governor who must be wise and good,
And temper with the sternness of the brain
Thoughts motherly, and meek as womanhood.
Wisdom doth live with children round her knees:
Books, leisure, perfect freedom, and the talk 
Man holds with week-day man in the hourly walk
Of the mind's business: these are the degrees
By which true Sway doth mount; this is the stalk
True Power doth grow on; and her rights are these. 

In trying to get all the clues
What living might be about

I know a man who said
You had a good life
If there are many people smiling
When you first shed the tears of being born
And if there are many people crying
When you’re long dead gone
I forgot his name
But I believe this is
What living might be about
A cradle and funeral treasure

I guess living is so true
In trying to get all the clues
What living might be about

Tasting the feel of questions
The dough of answers dwelling in different thoughts
And a blissful moment
When you suddenly do not care about either
But simply live a moment of your own truth
With an absurd credo that everything will be ok
Cannot prove anyhting
But pure joy of the choice you’ve made
A cradle and funeral treasure

I guess living is so true
In trying to get all the clues
What living might be about


I guess that this is the end, 
The end of our friendship.
We never did pretend, 
Never gave a tip, 
That it was anything more than this.

I don't know what I’ve done wrong, 
To make you break away, 
But I know inside your strong, 
We can take this day by day, 
And sometime our life will become bliss.


The most amazing dream
I was still; 
In a beautiful Rose Coffin
Laced with silk
My loved ones were crying
I didn't understand, why? 
I was so.  glamorous
My makeup, my hair, silky PJ's 
But Why? 
Why were they crying? 
In this room
There was Love, Support
But; Strength was missing
I then spoke
'I won't let you go'
No response
I knew then
My Journey had ended
A new beginning
'Alarm Bell'
I woke from that dream







Died at six months old

Tears fell but all was not well
With family at home

Barely remember 
His face his smile

I was only five years old
When angels took him away

Mum cried for days
Dad yelled and screamed
Why was he taken away? 

I could neither cry
Or shout out why
To young to understand

Just merely watched
The heartache and pain
As we grieved 
With each passing day

Soft brown eyes
Gentle soul 
That's all I could remember
Of my little brother
Another lost young soul

I sit and ponder
What would he be like? 
To discover this land
If he was still here
At home were he belonged

All misty eyed 
I start to cry 
And wish you were here
Besides your family 
And your friends


I had a little nut-tree,
Nothing would it bear.
I searched in all its branches,
But not a nut was there.

'Oh, little tree,' I begged,
'Give me just a few.'
The little tree looked down at me
And whispered, 'Nuts to you.

'closed down rumbling beating hard
Glass arrayed cold warmth untouched
Sorrowful frigid sterile surface glide in
Unopened crumbling crackling water sobs

And then a child a child came in
Looked at the window rumbling beating loud
It said ‘It looks like magic
Those racing drops and this rhythm blast
Restless trembling leaking down
Wow it’s a window full of steam
I think I will draw it a smile
I think I will draw it a heart
I think I’ll make it
A happy window pane
A laughing window pane.’With grandpa
while working in the fields
by a forest along the bank of a
rain-wet river; 
while the cattle grazed in the meadow, 
I, touching the gooseberry bushes, and
sitting under the shade of the
acacia; 
once became high while eating up
pickle and roti, and
while drinking water from the
low lying tap
I saw poetry
at the fringe, in her real image
The beginning was not known then
not even now -
but the end could be seen
with the naked eye; 
in all starkness of the reality
from the head to the toe
The fusion of life and death was
not a smaller intoxication; 
I'd learned silence from
grandpa's words, and
from the poeticized creation of god, 
the echoes of the songs of the sky
that were coming out from deep of the earth! 
Aristotle and Neruda still had
not awakened in me; 
only there was grandpa
and only was I -
There were terrains of land, and
there were breeze and clouds
And was a sudden shower of rains, 
and in the midst of all these
there was a random loneliness
that since then
hanging around in the same pose -
the pose that
it'd struck in the frame of the universe.
Just our perspectives have changed
grandpa has slept forever, and, 
I while away from my
ancestors' fading graveyard; 
hold the hand of my grandson, and
run in a nearby park-
taking small footsteps like him
While poetry sings ceaselessly
swaying in a swing
in a play land! 


but i have spilled it oh quite too soon
heart swelled flew colours of devotion
a rose it rose in an open bud bloom

now come and smell it kiss the petals dewed
it's all made of water deep in its root it's sewed
by a too late love drowned on banks of pain
by a too late love and never again


Pawned all of the life I had
And now these hands are bare.
Just a heart I had left- So, 
I had to take it there.

Fetched I quite a penny-
For that ugly little guy.
Not a day I pass that shop
Do I find mute its cry. 

I hate, 
hate that I can't trust
I hate, 
hate that I must lie because they'd rather believe I'm fine.

I hate, 
hate who I've been.
I hate, 
hate to make decisions.

I hate, 
hate that I can't hate those I should.
I hate, 
hate my life.

I hate, 
hate that I can't die.
I hate, 
hate to live in fear and hate.

I hate, 
hate my uncertainty.
I hate, 
hate the lies people tell me.

I hate, 
hate that I believe.
I hate, 
hate those that wish their lives were mine.

I hate, 
hate all emotion that's mine.
I hate, 
hate that I need others.

I hate, 
hate my own d*mn incompetence.
I hate, 
hate that there's so much to hate. 

I hate liars.
I hate the word perfect.
I hate pretending.
I hate fake people.
I hate names.
I hate judging.
I hate the word skinny.
I hate the media.
I hate that you have to fit in to be normal.
I hate mirrors.
I hate this feeling called insecurity.
I hate being out of place.
I hate weight.
I hate food.
I hate sterotyping.
I hate hurtfulness.
I hate my body.

I hate many things.
But the thing i hate the most

Is Myself. 

I hate my life, 
There were many times I wish I could die.
I at times really feel like dying, 
But I only end up crying.

I hate my life, 
And every thing (almost everything)   in it.
Sometimes I just want to end it.
To forget all my miseries and sorrows, 
Don't even bother about seeing another tomorrow.

At times I want to cut myself, 
It's hard to do but it's like that's only thing that would help.
I know I am talking out of vexation.
I don't care.
I want to hurt the people who hurt me so bad, 
Make them cry and feel real sad.

I feel so fed up, 
People from outside would say 'Shut Up! ! '
You don't know what you talking about.
But I am not them, 
And they are not me.
So please let me be.

At times I wonder what's my purpose, 
Is for me to stay on this earth, 
And basically just hurt, 
Wait till it gets more worse.

So many things I hate.
Living up to so many expectations, 
Wondering if I'll ever meet them.

Things people say to me it come off as me being dumb.
Not like that is what I think of myself.

There are times when I genuinely smile, 
A blow from reality tells me things ain't right.
Maybe just maybe things might go my way, 
And I'll actually see a brighter day.

Most times I feel so alone, 
Constantly reminded I've got problems in my own home.
I feel so tired I just want to rest my head, 
Days like these make me feel I'm better off dead! 







I hate the light, 
I hate the dark, 
I hate this gaping weaping hole inside of me.

I love silence, 
I love nothing, 
I love the sweat release of death.

I hate this space, 
I hate not knowing, 
I hate the truth of what's inside of me.

I love silence, 
I love nothing, 
I love the sweat relsease of death.

I hate you me and us, 
I hate the stars at night, 
I hate the way you look at me knowingly.

I love silence, 
I love nothing, 
I love the sweat release of death.

I hate the way you love me, 
I hate the way I love you too, 
I hate the way you make me feel.

I love silence, 
I love nothing, 
I love the sweat release of death.

I hate the way we are when we're apart, 
I hate us together, 
I hate the way we know we're going to be together forever. 

I love you so much and you can't even see, 
That every time u look away, it's like sticking a knife into me.
I want you so much, 
But you want me so little.
Your so conceited, 
And I hate it so much.
But everytime you smile, 
My knees give, my hearts melts, 
But you dont love you, so why should i stay? 
Those pills are too slow, 
Just like your desire to love me.
The knife hurts so bad, 
And the gun in the drawer is calling.
Maybe you'll read this after i leave, 
But i doubt it.
You'll probally laugh.
I'll cock the gun, 
Jessica, my friend, i love you, 
and boy, i hope you remember me.
I put it in my mouth, 
I pull the trigger, 

and there's nothing or nobody to pick me up again. 
when i wish to do something fun, 
but all there is to do is stay at home and do assignments, 
which land up being pushed back because of procrastination. 
i hate those days. 
especially seen as today is one of them.


but that is not true. 
If you wearing fancy clothes
people will respect & admire
you. 
I mean ladies will salute you,
but if you wearing the torn clothes,
they will undermine you. 
My point is we are all human beings,
hence we deserve to be treated
with respect & dignity
and that is what we call humanity.



I wish I were a poet to write about man and the tree
I wish all people could see
That life is beautiful and happiness is free
 I wish I could make all the children of the world happy
I wish all people could embrace honesty
I wish I could help the poor and the needy
I wish there were equality
I wish all peoples would enjoy liberty
I wish man would stop cruelty
I wish springs had not dried 
I wish the gap were not so wide
I wish our planet could be greener
I wish all hearts were tender
I wish friends would be sincere
I wish drinking water would be clear
                                                            I wish we heard birds at dawn
                                                      I wish peace would be the earth's crown
I wish parents could be more understanding
I wish children would be more obeying
I wish people knew money is a bad master
I wish they could respect each other
I wish I had power to stop wars
I wish my town were not so dirty
I wish my dreams became a reality
I wish we made an end to oppression and violence
I wish our kids were taught justice and tolerance
I wish they loved going to school
I wish I could convince them all.I have a fire for you in my mouth, but I have a hundred seals 
on my tongue. 
The flames which I have in my heart would make one mouth- 
ful of both worlds. 
Though the entire world should pass away, without the world 
I possess the kingdom of a hundred worlds. 
Caravans which are loaded with sugar I have in motion for 
the Egypt of nonexistence. 
The drunkenness of love makes me unaware whether I have 
profit of loss therefrom. 
The body’s eye was scattering pearls because of love, till now 
I have a pearl-scattering soul. 
Heaven. 
Thanks be to Him who gives soul to the body; if the soul 
should depart, yet I have the soul of the soul. 
Seek from me that which Shams-e Tabrizi has bestowed, for 
I have the same.I have a fire for you in my mouth, but I have a hundred seals

I have a freind
she is so sweet
I tell her alot
she's like my treasure
that i keep safe

(michelle this is to you i love you gurl)I have a rendezvous with Death
At some disputed barricade,
When Spring comes back with rustling shade
And apple-blossoms fill the air—
I have a rendezvous with Death
When Spring brings back blue days and fair.

It may be he shall take my hand
And lead me into his dark land
And close my eyes and quench my breath—
It may be I shall pass him still.
I have a rendezvous with Death
On some scarred slope of battered hill,
When Spring comes round again this year
And the first meadow-flowers appear.

Pillowed in silk and scented down,
Where love throbs out in blissful sleep,
Pulse nigh to pulse, and breath to breath,
Where hushed awakenings are dear . . .
But I've a rendezvous with Death
At midnight in some flaming town,
When Spring trips north again this year,
And I to my pledged word am true,
I shall not fail that rendezvous. 

I have a rendezvous with Life,
In days I hope will come,
Ere youth has sped, and strength of mind,
Ere voices sweet grow dumb.
I have a rendezvous with Life,
When Spring's first heralds hum.
Sure some would cry it's better far
To crown their days with sleep
Than face the road, the wind and rain,
To heed the calling deep.
Though wet nor blow nor space I fear,
Yet fear I deeply, too,
Lest Death should meet and claim me ere
I keep Life's rendezvous. 

I have become very hairy all over my body.
I'm afraid they'll start hunting me because of my fur.

My multicolored shirt has no meaning of love --
it looks like an air photo of a railway station.

At night my body is open and awake under the blanket,
like eyes under the blindfold of someone to be shot.

Restless I shall wander about;
hungry for life I'll die.

Yet I wanted to be calm, like a mound with all its cities destroyed,
and tranquil, like a full cemetery. ‘Ink runs from the corners of my mouth
There is no happiness like mine.
I have been eating poetry.'



O wonder of wonder
To eat and not get full
To taste, and smell and 
touch the words
always longing for
searching for
hungry for
just one more
divine morsel

I have been drinking 
the wine of words
distilled of many muses
vintage beyond the power
my poor palate
Drunk, yet I cannot
drink my fill.

Pour me another glass
set the table with your best
silver, linens, crystal
sparkling! 
Blind me with such verse

One thing though
I will request
give me only your very best
Spare me from
stale ideas
poems half-baked
warmed over words
ask yourself
would I offer such
to a starving reader? 

Strive to create Haute Cuisine
not fast food
Consider me but
a ravenous reader

I thirst for truth
I hunger for beauty
I starve for a perfect poem
Leftovers just won't do. 

What once was, is no more.
Now rises the sun on a day 
When contentment reigns; 
I have long been comforted 
Through dark nights of sorrow, 
Aching need, unfulfilled love.

A lost soul on shores of loneliness, 
I wandered empty desserts
Sludged through bogs of despair, 
And through it all, someone was there.

Time and time again, that presence
Became stronger through the years; 
As did my strength and confidence 
Till finally a day dawned upon faith.

A day when love was recognized, 
A day when that love lifted me; 
A day when I found my life and
A day to day sustaining grace. 

His heart to me, was a place of palaces and pinnacles and shining towers;
I saw it then as we see things in dreams,--I do not remember how long I slept;
I remember the tress, and the high, white walls, and how the sun was always on the
towers;
The walls are standing to-day, and the gates; I have been through the gates, I have
groped, I have crept
Back, back. There is dust in the streets, and blood; they are empty; darkness is over
them;
His heart is a place with the lights gone out, forsaken by great winds and the heavenly
rain, unclean and unswept,
Like the heart of the holy city, old blind, beautiful Jerusalem;


I have been tricked by flying too close 
to what I thought I loved. 
Now the candleflame is out, the wine spilled,
and the lovers have withdrawn
somewhere beyond my squinting.
The amount I thought I'd won, I've lost.
My prayers becomes bitter and all about blindness.
How wonderful it was to be for a while
with those who surrender.
Others only turn their faces on way,
then another, like pigeon in flight.
I have known pigeons who fly in a nowhere,
and birds that eat grainlessness,
and tailor who sew beautiful clothes
by tearing them to pieces. 

I have changed the numbers on my watch,
And now perhaps something else will change.
Now perhaps
At precisely . 

m.
You will not get up
And gathering your things together
Go forever.
Perhaps now you will find it is
Far too early to go,
Or far too late,
And stay forever


Life is neither so easy
Nor it is a bed of roses
Where no one can just do
Whatever he wishes to pose
For we have to find a way
And find out what to do
To bring a definite path
Of hope in to view
So work hard 'n try your best
And achieve what you can today
So you can proudly tell
I have come a long way.


I have dreamed of you so much that you are no longer real.
Is there still time for me to reach your breathing body, to kiss your mouth and make
your dear voice come alive again?

I have dreamed of you so much that my arms, grown used to being crossed on my 
chest as I hugged your shadow, would perhaps not bend to the shape of your body.
For faced with the real form of what has haunted me and governed me for so many 
days and years, I would surely become a shadow.

O scales of feeling.

I have dreamed of you so much that surely there is no more time for me to wake up. 
I sleep on my feet prey to all the forms of life and love, and you, the only one who 
counts for me today, I can no more touch your face and lips than touch the lips and 
face of some passerby.

I have dreamed of you so much, have walked so much, talked so much, slept so much 
with your phantom, that perhaps the only thing left for me is to become a phantom 
among phantoms, a shadow a hundred times more shadow than the shadow the 
moves and goes on moving, brightly, over the sundial of your life. 

I have got out of my own control, I have fallen into unconsciousness; in my utter unconsciousness how joyful I am with myself! 
The darling sewed up my eyes so that I might not see other than him, so that suddenly I opened my eyes on his face. 
My soul fought with me saying, "Do not pain me"; I said, "Take your divorce." She said, "Grant it"; I granted it. 
When my mother saw on my cheek the brand of your love she cut my umbilical cord on that, the moment I was born. 
If I travel to heaven and read the Tablet of the Unseen, O you who are my soul’s salvation, without you how I am ruined! 
When you cast aside the veil the dead become alive; the light of your face reminded me of the Covenant of Alast. 
When I became lost, O soul, through love of the king of the peris, hidden from self and creatures, I am as if peri-born myself. 
I said to the Tabriz of Shams-e Din, "O body, what are you?" Body said, "Earth"; Soul said, "I am distraught like the wind."I have felt Love
fermenting my nerves and my blood, 
raising my heart's pulse with velocity: 
banging the walls of my chest from within; 

I have felt Love
furtively, 
squeezing my heart in agony: 
depleting it of blood; 
and with each drop, 
imploring for more torment, 
for more, and more torture —
in a masochistic imploration
for unification; 

I have felt Love
immobilising my being
with profound, hypnotic eyes, 
strangulating my breath —
in a sort of sweet-poisonous swoon; 

I have felt Love
becoming the addiction of my existence; 
I dissolved, and I dissipated in its clenching: 
floating deliriously 
in its river of reveries-Why do you always 
Use to stare at me 
From the corner of your eyes
And i always catch your eye sight 
You always use to talk to each and every person
Nearby me 
But you never uttered a single word to me 
You always get that expression 
When you come in front of me 
Shy
Confused 
Blushed
Want to talk to me 
Every second of a single day 
You use to pass by class 
From different excuses 
I don't know how 
I am also confused little 
And surprised the most 
Every time 
Each time 
You pass 
I see you when go 
The expressionless person 
At that point of time 
I become 
You care for me always 
We met fifty times 
And still we are not friends 
Than what we are 
What you felt 
What I guessed
Then what I felt 
Some relations 
Are beyond the means 
And above the meanings 
Every time both of us 
Without uttering goodbye 
We say goodbye to Each other 
And each time we do not know 
And have any idea 
That 
When we will meet again 
But we use to meet 
With the same feeling 
Same expressions 
And with same 
Never said 
Many unspoken 
Silent 
Speechless words 
I think words can express many thing 
But not some thing
Because we ourselves 
Do not know what we are feeling 
What we want to say and know
What a feeling 
You have for me 
I have for you.. 

I have found, yes, I have found the wealth of the Divine Name's gem. 
My true guru gave me a priceless thing. With his grace, I accepted it. 
I found the capital of my several births; I have lost the whole rest of the world. 
No one can spend it, no one can steal it. Day by day it increases one and a quarter times. 
On the boat of truth, the boatman was my true guru. I came across the ocean of existence. 

I have found a guru in Raidas, he has 

given me the pill of knowledge. 

I lost the honor of the royal family, I 

went astray with the sadhus. 


temple, and dance, snapping my 

fingers. 

I don’t follow the norms as an oldest 

daughter-in-law, I have thrown 

away the veil. 

I have taken refuge with the great 

guru, and snapped my fingers at 

the consequences. 

jaded green palms prancing
so brave against freezing
about house height by ten
we stop to admire; wonder
what spray did the owner? 
so beautiful; admirable

could be surrounding pines
keeps temperature bearable 
no sign of plastic wrapper
it hasn't gone below F
my fingers hurt; ears ache
can't swing my club better


I pledged not nor am I the rose that climbeth
To the lips that sing loves tempests unknown
When the hanged verse thou hanged again 
In the mystic river of love when thou collecting self
In desire for the friend that showeth light in the dark
Watered thou sayeth by love and flourish in thy heart
The valentine for lovers thou left to search their names
Thou hast written a line for every one but whom
In the maze of words shall see or lost forever 

Love shalt not be faint as thou canst speaketh thy heart
Love the mysterious it is said but love the hidden revealeth 
Love shalt shine love like sun of the dawn the cry of the one
Love as my beloved like graffiti on the wall or the night
Love that falleth like dark Nox on every home with glint
Love the moon when the beloved stepeth into lovers abode
Love shalt taketh the nature into the beauties of the Eden
Love shalt be the open eye when all eyes closed
Love shalt be my guide whence my guides leave midway
Love is my destiny the prayer I have from the Soul
Love is the friend but alas who knoweth where liveth
In the heart of mine and thine and every lover
In the heart of the beloved I have heard also
"I have heard the sunset song of the birches, 
A white melody in the silence, 
I have seen a quarrel of the pines. 
At nightfall 
The little grasses have rushed by me 
With the wind men. 
These things have I lived," quoth the maniac, 
"Possessing only eyes and ears. 
But you -- 
You don green spectacles before you look at roses

"Oh, please let me say! 
Yes just say, I have HIV! 
And listen! If I may? 
Does it mean I cannot be? 

Deny me the right to breathe.
Bay for a sick man’s blood, 
Roil in rage, anger, seethe.

Are you the truth alone? 
I the epitome of amorality? 
Who will cast the first stone? 
Refuse to see sanity? 

Village barber’s spiked nick, 
often blooms our weekly beard.
Twists life to a punishing crick, 
frozen senses lost, gone, sheared.

Cruel doctor’s scalpel knife, 
in muddy pond’s water boiled.
Ah! our children and my wife, 
Alas, they too now, for ever soiled. 

I 

I have lived with shades so long, 
And talked to them so oft, 
Since forth from cot and croft 
I went mankind among, 
   That sometimes they 
   In their dim style 
   Will pause awhile 
   To hear my say; 

II 

And take me by the hand, 
And lead me through their rooms 
In the To-be, where Dooms 
Half-wove and shapeless stand: 
   And show from there 
   The dwindled dust 
   And rot and rust 
   Of things that were.

"Now turn," spake they to me 
One day: "Look whence we came, 
And signify his name 
Who gazes thence at thee

" - 
   --"Nor name nor race 
   Know I, or can," 
   I said, "Of man 
   So commonplace.

"He moves me not at all; 
I note no ray or jot 
Of rareness in his lot, 
Or star exceptional. 
   Into the dim 
   Dead throngs around 
   He'll sink, nor sound 
   Be left of him

"Yet," said they, "his frail speech, 
Hath accents pitched like thine - 
Thy mould and his define 
A likeness each to each - 
   But go! Deep pain 
   Alas, would be 
   His name to thee, 
   And told in vain!" 

"O memory, where is now my youth, 
Who used to say that life was truth?" 

"I saw him in a crumbled cot 
   Beneath a tottering tree; 
That he as phantom lingers there 
   Is only known to me
 


"O Memory, where is now my joy, 
Who lived with me in sweet employ?" 

"I saw him in gaunt gardens lone, 
   Where laughter used to be; 
That he as phantom wanders there 
   Is known to none but me
 


"O Memory, where is now my hope, 
Who charged with deeds my skill and scope?" 

"I saw her in a tomb of tomes, 
   Where dreams are wont to be; 
That she as spectre haunteth there 
   Is only known to me
 


"O Memory, where is now my faith, 
One time a champion, now a wraith?" 

"I saw her in a ravaged aisle, 
   Bowed down on bended knee; 
That her poor ghost outflickers there 
   Is known to none but me
 


"O Memory, where is now my love, 
That rayed me as a god above?" 

"I saw him by an ageing shape 
   Where beauty used to be; 
That his fond phantom lingers there 
   Is only known to me

I have lived with Shades so long,
So long have talked to them,
I sped to street and throng,
That sometimes they
In their dim style
Will pause awhile
To hear my say;

And take me by the hand,
And lead me through their rooms
In the To-Be, where Dooms
Half-wove and shapeless stand:
And show from there

That I wish that I could cry? 

Where are you tears? 

Aren't you supposed to run down my eye? 

Where are you tears? 

Shouldn't I cry for? 

Where are you tears

Won't you fly like a dove? 

where are you tears? 

I want you to run down my cheeks? 

Where are you tears? 

I wish to cry instead of speak?

I have loved hours at sea, gray cities,
The fragile secret of a flower,
Music, the making of a poem
That gave me heaven for an hour;

First stars above a snowy hill,
Voices of people kindly and wise,
And the great look of love, long hidden,
Found at last in meeting eyes.

I have loved much and been loved deeply --
Oh when my spirit's fire burns low,
Leave me the darkness and the stillness,
I shall be tired and glad to go. 

I have no one to blame
But you that plays head games, 
I don't understand why 
you entered my life
just to make me cry, 
you kept on mastering your skills 
casting your evil spells, 
you put my life in a living hell, 
your heart is cold, 
Yet you stand up to me very bold, 
you take me down
taken my heart and tore it apart, 
You lead me down a darken path
where lies are always being told, 
making life colder than it already was, 
the painful words of your neglect, 
the abuse from you, 
the pains were so real
but you always made everything a game, 
from the very start, 
you played the old game of false love
just to find a way to connect your hate
into my life, I prayed to get away from you
I didn't want a life of confused, 
You stress me out, 
You gave me so much doubts
Into a life of debts, 
I tried so hard to make my heart strong, 
But you just kept me feeling even more weaker
Then I already was; 
you would always ask me how I was feeling
I just put a smile on my face 
And just walked away, 
You were trying hard to catch my feelings
You thought I would let them just pour 
Out to you like rain, 
I guess I'm starting to get good at your games, 
You are so disloyal; 
But that is who you really are, 
You never held back your way of life, 
But you held back all your secrets
about how deadly you are, 
I could always feel your presence
even if I couldn't see you, 
Oh, how I can feel the cuts while you are 
marking up my heart; 
Your first words are I love You
The next I will never let you go.





I have nothing no more
No asset, no liability, no wrath, no pain
and no gain, no desire.
I'm empty vacant void and barren
you may shower on you may dump in 
You may walk by you may stay away
YOU CAN NO WAY DISREGARD; 
I SHALL RE-EMERGE
As sunshine, as flower
as brook stream water
as plants and greenery
I shall emerge emerge and emerge 
to recapture my right as a living creature. 
I shall!


'I have no power to change you
or explain your ways
Never believe a man can change a woman
Those men are pretenders
who think
that they created woman
from one of their ribs
Woman does not emerge from a man's rib's, not ever,
it's he who emerges from her womb
like a fish rising from depths of water
and like streams that branch away from a river
It's he who circles the sun of her eyes
and imagines he is fixed in place

I have no power to tame you
or domesticate you
or mitigate your first instincts
This task is impossible
I've tested my intelligence on you
also my dumbness
Nothing worked with you, neither guidance
nor temptation
Stay primitive as you are

I have no power to break your habits
for thirty years you have been like this
for three hundred years
a storm trapping in a bottle
a body by nature sensing the scent of a man
assaults it by nature
triumphs over it by nature

Never believe what a man says about himself
that he is the one who makes the poems
and makes the children
It is the woman who writes the poems
and the man who signs his name to them
It is the woman who bears the children
and the man who signs at the maternity hospital
that he is the father

I have no power to change your nature
my books are of no use to you
and my convictions do not convince you
nor does my fatherly council do you any good
to no one
Stay that way
You are the tree of femininity that grows in the dark
needs no sun or water
you the sea princess who has loved all men
and loved no one
slept with all men- and slept with no one
you are the Bedouin woman who went with all the tribes
and returned a virgin
Stay that way.

'I have no use for odic legions,
Or for the charm of elegiac play
For me, all verse should be off kilter
Not the usual way.

If only you knew what trash gives rise
To verse, without a tinge of shame,
Like bright dandelions by a fence,
Like burdock and like cocklebur.

An angry shout, the bracing smell of tar,
Mysterious mildew on the wall-
And out comes a poem, light-hearted, tender,
To your delight and mine. 

I have not forgotten you
For you have given me
Each blessed memory

I have not forgotten you
For I hold your hand
Each step I stand

I have not forgotten you
For you have taught me well
Each lesson I spell

I have not forgotten you
For in truth you are rare
Each thought I have spare










 


I  have  not  lived  my  life  alone
Lonely  though  I  be.
I'm  satisfied, just  as  I  am, 
To  share  the  world  with  thee.

No  one  knows, and  I  won't  tell, 
The  truth  about  our  lives; 
And  how  it  is  I've  managed  to
Make  sure  our  love  survives.

I  have  been  told  today  of  you, 
And  of  your  latest  trial.
And  so  it  was, I  once  again, 
Stared  lonely  at  your  smile.

It  made  me  think  that  once  again
It's  time  to  shed  a  tear.
Ere  I  should  lose  them  all  at  once
If  you  should  leave  me  here.

And  so  I  turned  the  little  valve
So  they  would  flow  a  bit.
And  take  some  note  of  it.

It's  in  this  way, though  far  apart, 
I'm  still  quite  near  to  you.
For  when  I  cry, I  feel  again; 
My  love, all  through  and  through.

In  sharing  in  your  joy  or  pain, 
Though  oh  so  far  apart; 
I  still  can  feel  the  warmth  and  love
That  lies  within  your  heart.

So  I  shall  shed  a  tear  or  two, 
And  keep  the  rest  at  bay.
I'll  surely  need  them  all  at  once, 
Should  you  depart  one  day.

The  only  hope  for  my  escape, 
From  drowning  in  their  flow.
Is  leaving  soon  enough; that  I'll
Have  left, before  you  go.

What  this  life  has  in  store.
Whenever  this  one  ends  for  us.
I'll  pray, we'll  share, one  more. 

The morning 
feels cool and crisp.
Smells of the fragrant earth
reeks the air, 
Hear- the twitter of the birds, 
I SEARCH FOR YOU THERE

In the bumble of the bees, 
the  slow opening of the rose
when the bee kisses the petals, 
the exuberance of the thunder, 
the flash  of the lightening, 
the lash of the sea waves
on the pebbled shore, 
I SEARCH FOR YOU THERE

The rapturous glow of the moon
the twinkle of the stars, 
the rise of the dawn, 
the flame of the afternoon
the closing shades of twililght
I SEARCH YOU THERE

In the velocity of the tornado
the pitter patter of the raindrops on my rooftop, 
the sway of the leaves of the tree
the lustre of the diamonds
the flow of your poetic verses
I SEARCH FOR YOU.

The beads of the rosary
in my hands doth move, 
on my lips with words of love, 
chant your name
a million times.
On my heart with folded palms
in devotion I pray for your wellbeing
But still, 
IM SEARCHING FOR YOU.





I have seen almost all the possible Troubles in my life,
The last one that I have to face is the Death. 

I have seen Bengal’s face, that is why I do not seek
Beauty of the earth any more: I wake up in the dark
And see the dawn’s magpie-robin perched under the parasol-like huge leaf
Of the fig tree – on all sides I see mounds of leaves of
Black plum – banyan – jackfruit – oak – pipal lying still;
Their shadows fall on the spurge bushes on zedoary clumps;
Saw such oaks – banyans – gamboge’s blue shades
Bengal’s beauty incomparable.

 
Behula too someday floating on raft on Gangur’s water –
When the fullmoon of the tenebrous twelfth night died on the river’s shoal –
Saw countless pipals and banyans beside the golden corn,
Alas, heard the tender songs of shama – and one day going to Amara.
When she danced like a torn wagtail in Indra’s court
Bengal’s river field, wild violets wept at her feet like anklet bells.

(Sonnet  Rupashi Bangla)Father of heaven says us, hear, 
I have sent my son strange seer.
My son is super will guide you, 
He has got this right, builds new.

My son is an artist of new wisdom, 
I have sent him to build kingdom.
You need all to become pure soon, 
Then only you can catch holy moon.

My son has strength and power, 
By his touch smiles small flower.
Tower of heaven he builds for all, 
Courage he gives you do not fall.

Tall my son is above ruling emperor, 
King of kings he is true adventurer.
I have sent my son to sacrifice there, 
For your sins he cries, washes in care.

Oh dear beloved children, follow him, 
I transfer wisdom by my son and vim.
I care you all while you hear my son, 
After knowing this secret you do stun.

And worthy friends are rare:
These carpet slippers on my feet,
That padded leather chair;
This old and shabby dressing-gown,
So well the worse of wear.

I have some friends, some honest friends,
And honest friends are few;
My pipe of briar, my open fire,
A book that's not too new;
My bed so warm, the nights of storm
I love to listen to.

I have some friends, some good, good friends,
Who faithful are to me:
My wrestling partner when I rise,
The big and burly sea;
My little boat that's riding there
So saucy and so free.

I have some friends, some golden friends,
Whose worth will not decline:
A tawny Irish terrier, a purple shading pine,
A little red-roofed cottage that
So proudly I call mine.

All other friends may come and go,
All other friendships fail;
But these, the friends I've worked to win,
Oh, they will never stale;
And comfort me till Time shall write
The finish to my tale. 

I have such a heart- 
utterly broken 
and destitute; 

I fear to show her that.

I fear she may turn her face from me
if she sees it. 

I now see that I have the power
as I open my eyes to all that is
I see that I am connected to all that I love
that I can transcend all that I loathe.  .

so, I now embrace all that comes my way
though I may not condone, 
I may not condemn, 
instead, I nurture my body in wellness
as I fill my mind with wisdom and peace.  .

and in justice, 
I use my voice to speak my innermost truth, 
on this day, in this hour
I now see that I have the power.  . . 

I have the power
To make the wind blow.  Grab my
Camera for a shot. 

He is cute as a button
A pain in the ass when he wants to play
Yet he is always there for me 
IN rain or hail regardless the time of the day 
When I cry he try's to comfort me
When I laugh.  

he keeps me company
When I take him for walks. . 

he runs around enjoying the moment
Oddly enough he doesn't belong to me
He belongs to my nephew that is more busy with work now a days
He use to sleep on the end of his bed.  

now he sleeps on mine
When he first came home I had decided not to be involved
Now its like he is a part of my world.  

smiles


I have this key 
That I wear around my neck

It means the world to me
Because he gave it to me

Telling me with love 
That it was the key to his heart

Attached to the key
Is a small shaped heart

It brings back memories 
Memories of love 

He passed away so long ago
But still I hold the key to his heart

I smile, I cry, I remember
And lovingly hold the chain 

That's attached to the key
That opens his heart


We live life as best we know how
Then we learn though degradation in life
Just how bad life can be
If you have not felt pain 
If you have not felt anguish
If you have not felt broken in two
How can you learn if you don’t know pain? 
How can you appreciate the life around you? 
Its beauty its simplicity that abounds around us all
Is that harsh to think like that I don’t know 
To be innocent for ever-an impossible dream
The hardest part now is move past all that
The pain 
The degradation
The anger
The hurt
It encompasses us as humans 
That- yes we can move on 
Yes we can learn from our mistakes
Yes we can embrace that forever evading bright light
Hardest part now is taking those first steps to healing
Taking someone’s hand and reaching out for help
That’s the hardest part in life 
The next steps
Well here I go

Taking the next step-
See you on the other side-
The lights calling me
It’s a good thing
Just means I am now happy and content
Try it you might like it-I do-smiles


I have this void. 

This yearning to be a part 

of something wonderful. 

This emptiness I feel.  

its all that I can do

Before it drives me insane with want and need

To feel alive.  

is that to much to ask

You ever have that pivotal moment in your life

Were you think you know what you want

But its just out of reach

You search for a life time to find it. . 

you think you have. 

Then poof.  

it disappears. . 

it was just in your grasp.  

then it just slips away.  

sigh

Sigh.  

its madness I tell you madness

You know what I mean. . 

sigh.  

I suppose 

Thats life. . 

gah. . 

shoot me know. . 

BIG SIGHNow I have to go.
I can not face another day.
Cant face another day in peril.
Im a shadow Of who I used to be.
So desperate to be free.

So now I must go.
Go for the to and throw.
Now I must go.
And leave my wreckaged 
Life behind me.

I must follow
My new path
Im being called home.
The voices want me gone


For a day when nothing will be wrong
When I can go in my dream's glen
And see if there I can pen

The precious memories of my good old days
That gave me joy in many ways
So down in the valley of my thoughts
I went aawaay deep and from there I brought

The memories of my kids who are small
Who were ssitting there in the middle of all
So then for hours I sat there and talked
In the language of silence that didn't block

The very warm wishes that I really had
For them so they can always be glad
And then I thought I know with time
Many things change and many decline

But all my affection, care and love
Are only and only surely reserved 
For the kids who are my only treasure
Who know how to bring me peace and pleasure

So I wish that this ditance that prevails
May give me chance so I can avail
This precious time and pray for them
And with happiness needle I can hem

Each and every moment of their lives
So they can happily and fainly survive
Because I have really waited long
For the day when I can sing the song

Of love and peace and provide its shadow
Where they can plaay in its tranquil meadow
That only and only exists in my mind
For my lovely kids who're nice and kind. 

I have wanted you, 
I have loved you, 
How to live without you, 
I have wanted you, 
I have loved you? 

I really love you, 
I really want you, 
You are my life, 
My life, O my love

At one time
Your darkness enveloped
My whole world; 
But you could NOT
Break this spirit.
I beat you 
At your own game; 
Prevailed
Against the savagery
That brought me to my knees. 
Then I broke you 'little c'
Down to nothing more
Than a mongrel disease
Cowering in the shadows.
I called you into light, 
Stood firm 
On holy ground; 
And by that Grace
Put an end to you.
How sweet now
Is my victory, 
For I am sound, 
No more of you
Can be found. 
And I HAVE WON! 

I Hear America singing, the varied carols I hear;
   Those of mechanics--each one singing his, as it should be, blithe and strong;
   The carpenter singing his, as he measures his plank or beam,
   The mason singing his, as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work;
   The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat--the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck;
   The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench--the hatter singing as he stands;
   The wood-cutter's song--the ploughboy's, on his way in the morning, or at the noon intermission, or at sundown;
   The delicious singing of the mother--or of the young wife at work--or of the girl sewing or washing--Each singing what belongs to her, and to none else;
   The day what belongs to the day--At night, the party of young fellows, robust, friendly,
   Singing, with open mouths, their strong melodious songs. 

I hear an army charging upon the land,	 
  And the thunder of horses plunging, foam about their knees:	 
Arrogant, in black armour, behind them stand,	 
  Disdaining the reins, with fluttering whips, the charioteers.	 
 
They cry unto the night their battle-name:	         
  I moan in sleep when I hear afar their whirling laughter.	 
They cleave the gloom of dreams, a blinding flame,	 
  Clanging, clanging upon the heart as upon an anvil.	 
 
They come shaking in triumph their long, green hair:	 
  They come out of the sea and run shouting by the shore.	  
My heart, have you no wisdom thus to despair?	 
  My love, my love, my love, why have you left me alone

I HEAR it was charged against me that I sought to destroy
         institutions;
   But really I am neither for nor against institutions;
   (What indeed have I in common with them?--Or what with the
         destruction of them?)
   Only I will establish in the Mannahatta, and in every city of These
         States, inland and seaboard,
   And in the fields and woods, and above every keel, little or large,
         that dents the water,
   Without edifices, or rules, or trustees, or any argument,
   The institution of the dear love of comrades. 

I hear the oriole's always-grieving voice, 
And the rich summer's welcome loss I hear 
In the sickle's serpentine hiss 
Cutting the corn's ear tightly pressed to ear. 
And the short skirts of the slim reapers 
Fly in the wind like holiday pennants, 
The clash of joyful cymbals, and creeping 
From under dusty lashes, the long glance. 

I don't expect love's tender flatteries, 
In premonition of some dark event, 
But come, come and see this paradise 
Where together we were blessed and innocent. 

I hear the stars still singing
To the beautiful, silent night,
As they speed with noiseless winging
Their ever westward flight.
I hear the waves still falling
On the stretch of lonely shore,
But the sound of a sweet voice calling
I shall hear, alas! no more. 

Even through 
time and space
you embrace me.
I sense your guidance
know you are near; 
feel you with me.
And I hear your voice
inside me.
Maybe there will
always be some 
connection; 
life connected to life.
How can death
ever turn out
the eternal light
that lives in us forever

I heard a sweet voice
Dripping honey in my ears
A lovely sound of my life
That I have enjoyed for many years

It brought me into the world
Into the world of laughs and smiles
That walks along with me forever
To bring me joy for endless miles

I loved the echo of that word
That special word that made me say
How can I thank to you today

I love to hear that sweet voice
The sweet voice of my Baby Doll
When she calls with love 'MY Dad'
It fills with fain and joy my world small

For nothing in the world can be
So powerful to bring me sunshine and stars
But the sweet voice of my Baby Doll
Who is looking for me and calling from far

That daughters go away very far
To make a house a sweet home dear
With love and care like a sparkling star

For my daughters who are thousands miles away
Please keep them under your shade of bliss
And fill happiness in their whole life's way.

***Feelings Of My Father's Love Penned Down***I heard an Angel singing 
     When the day was springing,
     'Mercy, Pity, Peace
     Is the world's release.'

     Thus he sung all day
     Over the new mown hay,
     Till the sun went down
     And haycocks looked brown.

     I heard a Devil curse
   Over the heath and the furze,
   'Mercy could be no more,
   If there was nobody poor,

   And pity no more could be,
   If all were as happy as we.'
   At his curse the sun went down,
   And the heavens gave a frown.

   Down pour'd the heavy rain
   Over the new reap'd grain . 
   And Miseries' increase
   Is Mercy, Pity, Peace. 

I heard that something's going on
I heard the fire alarms shouting and the wheels rolling fast
I heard the sounds of thunder and the truck stop lights blinking
I heard there's something going on that could drown my whole world
With a rain warm and burning from the passion retrieved
The black waters going to run clear again
I heard the rumours on the street corners passing
Steady and strong the floods burst the prisons
And the free ones reflect while standing on the mountain top
How one jump can indeed save your life
And the skies they rise and the tears flow back in my eyes
Because there's something going on
That I like


Their old familiar carols play, 
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men. 

I thought how, as the day had come, 
Had rolled along th'unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men. 

And in despair I bowed my head: 
'There is no peace on earth, ' I said 
'For hate is strong, and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.' 

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: 
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail, 
With peace on earth, good will to men.'

Till, ringing, singing on its way, 
The world revolved from night to day
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime, 
Of peace on earth, good will to men. 

I HEARD thee laugh, 
And in this merriment 
I defined the measure of my pain; 
I knew that I was alone, 
Alone with love, 
Poor shivering love, 
And he, little sprite, 
Came to watch with me, 
And at midnight 
We were like two creatures by a dead camp-fire. 

I HEARD you, solemn-sweet pipes of the organ, as last Sunday morn I
         pass'd the church;
   Winds of autumn!--as I walk'd the woods at dusk, I heard your long-
         stretch'd sighs, up above, so mournful;
   I heard the perfect Italian tenor, singing at the opera--I heard the
         soprano in the midst of the quartet singing;
  
  Heart of my love!--you too I heard, murmuring low, through one of
         the wrists around my head;
   Heard the pulse of you, when all was still, ringing little bells last
         night under my ear. 

I'm watching football, which is odd as
I hate football
in a hyperbolic and clinically revealing way,
but I hate Bill Parcells more,
because he is the illuminated manuscript
of cruel, successful men, those with the slitty eyes of ancient reptiles,
who wear their smugness like a tight white turtleneck,
and revel in their lack of empathy
for any living thing.
So I'm watching football, staying up late to watch football,
hoping to witness (as I think of it)
The Humiliation of the Tuna
(as he is called),
which is rightly Parcells's first time back in the Meadowlands
since taking up with the Cowboys,
who are, as we all know,
thugs, even by the NFL's standards. The reasons

I hate football are clear and complicated and were born,
as I was, in Nebraska,
where football is to life what sleep deprivation is
to Amnesty International, that is,
the best researched and most effective method
of breaking a soul. Yes,
there's the glorification of violence, the weird nexus
knitting the homo, both phobic and erotic,
but also, and worse, my parents in  drunk as
Australian parrots in a bottlebush, screeching
WE'RE # WE'RE #
when the Huskers finally clinched the Orange Bowl,
the two of them
bouncing up and down crazily on the couch, their index
fingers jutting holes through the ubiquitous trail of smoke rings
that was the weather in our house,
until the whole deranged mess that was them,
my parents, the couch, their lit cigarettes,
flipped over backward onto my brother and me. My husband
thinks that's a funny story and, in an effort to be a "good sport,"
I say I think it is, too.
 
Which leads me to recall the three Chihuahuas
who've spent the fullness of their agitated lives penned
in the back of my neighbor's yard.
Today they barked continuously for minutes (I timed it) as
the UPS guy made his daily round.
They bark so piercingly, they tremble with such exquisite outrage,
that I've begun to root for them, though it's fashionable
to hate them and increasingly dark threats
against their tiny persons move between the houses on our block.
But isn't that what's wrong with this version of America:
the jittering, small-skulled, inbred-by-no-choice-
of-their-own are despised? And Bill Parcells—
the truth is he'll win
this game. I know it and you know it and, sadly,
did it ever seem there was another possible outcome?
 
It's a small deposit,
but I'm putting my faith in reincarnation. I need to believe
in the sweetness of one righteous image,
in Bill Parcells trapped in the body of a teacup poodle,
as any despised thing,
forced to yap away his next life staked to
a clothesline pole or doing hard time on a rich old matron's lap,
dyed lilac to match her outfit.
I want to live there someday, across that street,
and listen to him. Yap, yap, yap. 

My hands did numb to beauty
as they reached into Death and tightened!

O sovereign was my touch
upon the tan-inks's fragile page!

Quickly, my eyes moved quickly,
sought for smell for dust for lace
for dry hair!

I would have taken the page
breathing in the crime!
For no evidence have I wrung from dreams--
yet what triumph is there in private credence?

Often, in some steep ancestral book,
when I find myself entangled with leopard-apples
and torched-skin mushrooms,
my cypressean skein outreaches the recorded age
and I, as though tipping a pitcher of milk,
pour secrecy upon the dying page. 

I hid my love when young till I
Couldn't bear the buzzing of a fly;
I hid my love to my despite
Till I could not bear to look at light;
I dare not gaze upon her face
But left her memory in each place;
Where'er I saw a wild flower lie
I kissed and bade my love goodbye. 

I met her in the greenest dells,
Where dewdrops pearl the wood bluebells;
The lost breeze kissed her bright blue eye,
The bee kissed and went singing by,
A sunbeam found a passage there,
A gold chain round her neck so fair;
As secret as the wild bee's song
She lay there all the summer long. 

I hid my love in field and town
Till e'en the breeze would knock me down;
The bees seemed singing ballads o'er,
The fly's bass turned to lion's roar;
And even the silence found a tongue,
To haunt me all the summer long;
The riddle nature could not prove
Was nothing else but secret love. 

I hide within a culture where black people
kill their brother everyday
no other culture on this earth
slaughter humans in this way..

listen to what I say! -

I hide within a culture where white rulers estimate
the body count-the after effects..
of the importation and proliferation 
of drugs and alcohol 
of guns and disease-and biased media..
that they control-

the ‘when and where and who -will fall’

these white men have no soul-
world domination is their goal

white rulers that get rich from war..
old racist men that know it all..

I hide within that culture 


I hoed and trenched and weeded, 
And took the flowers to fair: 
I brought them home unheeded; 
The hue was not the wear. 

So up and down I sow them 
For lads like me to find, 
When I shall lie below them, 
A dead man out of mind. 

Some seed the birds devour, 
And some the season mars, 
But here and there will flower, 
The solitary stars, 

And fields will yearly bear them 
As light-leaved spring comes on, 
And luckless lads will wear them 
When I am dead and gone. 

I hold to hope because I feel your love, 
I don't believe we're done yet because
we have a bond that holds us tight.
A true love we can't quite explain, 
all we need to know though is that it's there, 
and what we share is special and truly rare.

I hold to hope because I just know and feel it in my heart, 
your heart and spirit across the distance speak to me.
Keep the faith and be filled with peace my darling, 
just hold to hope because I love you sincerely and
I have faith in what my heart and soul know. 

I will honor you everyday and night my love 
as long as we both shall live and well beyond. 
Through the eternities I'll give you my 
best in everyway I know how. 
For I wish to honor the greatest woman 
earth has ever truly known. 

I will honor you to show you I love you truly 
and know how lucky I am and all you're worth. 
I love more and more with every second of everyday, 
I will never abandon my only one or walk away. 
My Angel and my guiding light I honor with 
all my will and might. 

The conqueror and holder of my heart and soul, 
my mind, my hopes, my dreams, my entire being. 
You are all the things I desire and need. 

I swear to you I'll always honor you. 
Through the eternities by your side I 
so truly cherish you. 
I confess my everlasting and undying love, 
come take my hand and let me hold you forevermore. 

I hope, 
That someday I will be heard.
I hope, 
That I will become someone, 
Instead of being invisible.
I hope, 
That I will be able to talk, 
To the person that I trust.
I hope, 
That, that person will listen.
I hope, 
That I will be able to get away, 
And find somewhere, 
Somewhere, where i am not annoyed, 
Or told what to do, 
When I already know.
I hope, 
That I will be able to show everyone, 
That I can acheive the things, 
That I wanted to acheive.
I hope. 

I hope that I can see you, 
I always wanted to meet you, 
But you always tried to meet me, 
You always wanted to be free, 
and even drink tea, 
Down by the sea.

I hoped that is all I need, 
because I don't smoke weed, 
so I never succeed.
that is in deed all that I need.





I hope so much that you'll come and talk to me. 
I love you more than anything there is. 
I need you in my life, 
you are my only true love. 

Let us take each other in our arms 
saying it's all alright. 
We're forever here planning on marrying each other, 
sealing our bond for eternity. 



I need to close my eyes
And envision us.

See us smiling
Walking together

With leaves and attraction
Around us falling.

I used to do such things alone.
Dream alone.

Then I found you
And your loneliness

Sweetly calling
Out for my help.

Then I decided
I don't want to need to close my 

Eyes to see us.
I need to see us

Even when my hazel eyes
Are open and bright. 

For as long as I can remember.
Right from the beginning, 
from the very start.
All I ever knew was hurt.

Life has dealt a rough hand.
On my own I try to understand.
Its my feet that do not stand.
For my soul has grown weak.
And the hurt I do not speak.

My heart has loads of secrets.
My eyes tell the pain.
My soul is ugly.
And my mind is lost.

Im forever searching.
For the way to be me.
And long for that day to be free. 

Blood running everywhere.
Dripping all down my skin.
Still not enough.
Must hurt some more.

It's my way.
To get through the day.
To keep my hell at bay.

Bang my head against the wall.
Still not enough.
Must hurt myself some more.

Find a weapon.
Find and open my speacial box.
Must do some more.

For hurt I do.
I'd rather hurt on the outside.
Hurt even more 


First, the self. Then, the observing self.
The self that acts and the self that watches. This
The starting point, the place where the mind begins,
Whether the mind of an individual or
The mind of a species. When I was a boy
I struggled to understand. For if I know
The self that watches, another watching self
Must see the watcher, then another watching that,
Another and another, and where does it end?
So my mother sent me to the barber shop,
My first time, to get my hair "cut for a part"
(Instead of the dutch boy she'd always given me),
As I was instructed to tell the barber. She
Dispatched me on my own because the shop,
Which had a pool table in the back, in that
Small town was the men's club, and no woman
Would venture there. Was it my first excursion
On my own into the world? Perhaps. I sat
In the big chair. The wall behind me held
A huge mirror, and so did the one in front,
So that I saw my own small strange blond head
With its oriental eyes and turned up nose repeated
In ever diminishing images, one behind
Another behind another, and I tried
To peer farther and farther into the succession
To see the farthest one, diminutive in
The shadows. I could not. I sat rigid
And said no word. The fat barber snipped
My hair and blew his brusque breath on my nape
And finally whisked away his sheet, and I
climbed down. I ran from that cave of mirrors
A mile and a half to home, to my own room
Up under the eaves, which was another cave.
It had no mirrors. I no longer needed mirrors. 




I

I, in my intricate image, stride on two levels,
Forged in man's minerals, the brassy orator
Laying my ghost in metal,
The scales of this twin world tread on the double,
My half ghost in armour hold hard in death's corridor,
To my man-iron sidle.

Beginning with doom in the bulb, the spring unravels,
Bright as her spinning-wheels, the colic season
Worked on a world of petals;
She threads off the sap and needles, blood and bubble
Casts to the pine roots, raising man like a mountain
Out of the naked entrail.

Beginning with doom in the ghost, and the springing marvels,
Image of images, my metal phantom
Forcing forth through the harebell,
My man of leaves and the bronze root, mortal, unmortal,
I, in my fusion of rose and male motion,
Create this twin miracle.

This is the fortune of manhood: the natural peril,
A steeplejack tower, bonerailed and masterless,
No death more natural;
Thus the shadowless man or ox, and the pictured devil,
In seizure of silence commit the dead nuisance.
The natural parallel.

My images stalk the trees and the slant sap's tunnel,
No tread more perilous, the green steps and spire
Mount on man's footfall,
I with the wooden insect in the tree of nettles,
In the glass bed of grapes with snail and flower,
Hearing the weather fall.

Intricate manhood of ending, the invalid rivals,
Voyaging clockwise off the symboled harbour,
Finding the water final,
On the consumptives' terrace taking their two farewells,
Sail on the level, the departing adventure,
To the sea-blown arrival.

II

They climb the country pinnacle,
Twelve winds encounter by the white host at pasture,
Corner the mounted meadows in the hill corral;
They see the squirrel stumble,
The haring snail go giddily round the flower,
A quarrel of weathers and trees in the windy spiral.

As they dive, the dust settles,
The cadaverous gravels, falls thick and steadily,
The highroad of water where the seabear and mackerel
Turn the long sea arterial
Turning a petrol face blind to the enemy
Turning the riderless dead by the channel wall.

(Death instrumental,
Splitting the long eye open, and the spiral turnkey,
Your corkscrew grave centred in navel and nipple,
The neck of the nostril,
Under the mask and the ether, they making bloody
The tray of knives, the antiseptic funeral;

Bring out the black patrol,
Your monstrous officers and the decaying army,
The sexton sentinel, garrisoned under thistles,
A cock-on-a-dunghill
Crowing to Lazarus the morning is vanity,
Dust be your saviour under the conjured soil.)

As they drown, the chime travels,
Sweetly the diver's bell in the steeple of spindrift
Rings out the Dead Sea scale;
And, clapped in water till the triton dangles,
Strung by the flaxen whale-weed, from the hangman's raft,
Hear they the salt glass breakers and the tongues of burial.

(Turn the sea-spindle lateral,
The grooved land rotating, that the stylus of lightning
Dazzle this face of voices on the moon-turned table,
Let the wax disk babble
Shames and the damp dishonours, the relic scraping.
These are your years' recorders. The circular world stands still.)

III

They suffer the undead water where the turtle nibbles,
Come unto sea-stuck towers, at the fibre scaling,
The flight of the carnal skull
And the cell-stepped thimble;
Suffer, my topsy-turvies, that a double angel
Sprout from the stony lockers like a tree on Aran.

Be by your one ghost pierced, his pointed ferrule,
Brass and the bodiless image, on a stick of folly
Star-set at Jacob's angle,
Smoke hill and hophead's valley,
And the five-fathomed Hamlet on his father's coral
Thrusting the tom-thumb vision up the iron mile.

Suffer the slash of vision by the fin-green stubble,
Be by the ships' sea broken at the manstring anchored
The stoved bones' voyage downward
In the shipwreck of muscle;
Give over, lovers, locking, and the seawax struggle,
Love like a mist or fire through the bed of eels.

And in the pincers of the boiling circle,
The sea and instrument, nicked in the locks of time,
My great blood's iron single
In the pouring town,
I, in a wind on fire, from green Adam's cradle,
No man more magical, clawed out the crocodile.

Man was the scales, the death birds on enamel,
Tail, Nile, and snout, a saddler of the rushes,
Time in the hourless houses
Shaking the sea-hatched skull,
And, as for oils and ointments on the flying grail,
All-hollowed man wept for his white apparel.

Man was Cadaver's masker, the harnessing mantle,
Windily master of man was the rotten fathom,
My ghost in his metal neptune
Forged in man's mineral.
This was the god of beginning in the intricate seawhirl,
And my images roared and rose on heaven's hill. 

I in search of Shiva, Shiva in search of me, 
Shiva Shiva, 
I I, 
Shiva I, 
I Shiva, 
Shivoaham, shivoaham, shivoaham, 
i am Shiva, I sam Shiva, I am shiva, 
Shiva am I, Shiva am I, Shiva am I, 
I in search of Shiva, Shiva in search of me. 

I is not important, 
What it is, is the earth, 
Green earth
Full of greenery
And vegetation, 
Rocks, rivers, mountains and hills, 
Valleys and marshes, 
What it is important is ecology, 
Environment, human co-existence
With birds, beats and flowers, 
Exotic flora and fauna. 

today or any other day
the less one expects
the less disappointed
one becomes

On second thoughts. 
one becomes
what one expects

I don't want to break this shell
I don't want any one to tell
I just want happiness to dwell
In every phase of my life
In every place where I survive
I just want the happiness drive
It's not that I cannot feel
It's not that it doens't appeal
I just don't want to steal
Others joy and give them tears
When they don't have anyone to share
Nor anyone to tell that they care
I don't want to lose hope
Neither I want to mope
I just want the happiness rope
That won't let me weep
Till I lie down forever to sleep
In earth's lap that is deep
Where no one for me can tell
To stop wishing for happiness to dwell
And to break up my built in shell. 

I just keep seeing you
Whenever get I time to see, 
I just keep seeing
Which but you do not, 
But what can I do
As I cannot help without it.

My love-talk do not say it to others
As they will laugh at me
Hearing it. 

Now tell you, 
What's your name, 
I won't let you go
Holding the hand.

I just saw you 
And fell in love, 
There was magic in your eyes, 
Love in your heart, 
Say, do you love me

I don't ask for the best. I don't want any more
Just break this sourness and let me enter the door

The door thta is full of hopes
And dreams that doesn't let me mope

Where waves are standing still
As if they were given the pills

The pills that will let them sleep
So there I can go and weep

And show him all those miles

That I covered alone in gloom
Where nothing I saw in bloom

There i wish to find tranquality
Because I don't want to face the reality

The reality that is sour and bitter
And is strewn around like a litter

Because the other vision of reality is pain
That puts everything in vain

And doesn't give any price
To tears taht roll from eyes

So its no use to cry or wait
As it will all be a waste

That will break all my pride
And won't let me hide

My teras I had tried to stop
And wished they wouldn't have dropped

Because I think now its good to assume
That pains are life's perfume

That're given to everyone for the test
And after which we are given the best. 

i don't want 
a boy that spends
more time on his hair
than i do

I just want that one one boy, 
who will be there
who doesn't mind
If I eat more than him, 
Who thinks I'm Beautifulfirst thing in the morning
who dosen't 
promise me everything
but gives me his everything
who doesnt mind
if i act dorky
who holds my hand
in front of everyone

I just want that one boy

who doesn't speak for me
who just loves me
unconditionally

I just want you


I just want to get away
From this mad evil world.
Only I cant
Each time I try
Some one is there to save me.
They wont let me forfill my wish.
Im in emotional pain
And cant live any longer.

Why must people save me? 
Is it not clear enough? 
Please just let me go.
Its all I want to do


I get so tired of worrying all the time, 
About where my next meal will come from
I feel like packing up, taking off, and just run
I wish one time when my phone rings
The bill collectors would not sing
That some old melody of how they will take everything
I want to go to my mailbox just once
And not come back feeling like I weigh a bunch
Cause all the notices in there
Sometimes I really get scared
How they don't even care
When my check gets lost
And I can't pay their costs
Then they tack on another fee
To let me know I am not free
And this is how things seem to be
So I just sit back and think
I just want to pay my bills


One morning I hope that I wake up next to you.
I'll pinch myself because there's no way that this dream came true, 
I'll be the happiest I have and will ever be.
When we're together, you and me.

I'll be so happy, I know I'll start to cry.
I'll never be happier, and you're my reason why.
I know I'll choke when I say I love you, 
But as long as you believe me that it is true.

I want to wake up oneday and look into your eyes.
I want to the one who whipes them when they cry.
I want to hold you in my arms and tell you its all ok.
I want to be the one to tell you, you're beautiful today.

I want to hold your hands up on my roof, 
I never want to wake up because it will all go poof.
I want to love you deeper and never let you go.
I love you, you're a keeper, I just wanted you to know. 

I keep six honest serving-men
(They taught me all I knew);
Their names are What and Why and When
And How and Where and Who.
I send them over land and sea,
I send them east and west;
But after they have worked for me,
I give them all a rest.

I let them rest from nine till five,
For I am busy then,
As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,
For they are hungry men.
But different folk have different views; 
I know a person small-
She keeps ten million serving-men,
Who get no rest at all!

She sends'em abroad on her own affairs,
From the second she opens her eyes-
One million Hows, two million Wheres,
And seven million Whys

I see past your eyes
I see through your disguise

You say that your ugly
You claim that your fat

You know that your not
You wont take my compliments

I say that your hot
And I kid you not

I'd choose you over anyone
If I had a choice

damn i killed the cat 
i can't believe it 
a well placed kick killed
the cat yet no remorse 
wait is that a smile 
yea peaceful nights now 
you waking up for cats yea
but no its not your life to take 
you killed a living thing
it only a cat
there no where near extinction 
so you have no problem
no the kids loved it 
how do i explain it to them
ooh bury it and say it ran away
but they will be sad 
sad! what sad face never killed 
no one but my boot did
it collided in its tiny skull
it moaned till it pass 
my god i killed the cat 
i killed the cat


I kissed you.
Do you remember? 
Our lips puckered in time.
Raindrops fell.
The sun dried up.
In that moment you were mine.
Clocks shot by.
And I flew home.
Well I walked, but that was fine. 

When we first kissed
On that chilly March night
I knew from that moment on
I had found my Ms. Right

It's wasn't your beautiful looks
Or the way you flaunted it as you walked by
What gave it away
Was the twinkle in your eye

That first night we spent together
As I held you close to me
I could tell the feeling was mutual
We both knew it was meant to be

Now that our wedding date approaches
My feelings are still true
Because until the day I die
I will always love you. 

I knew
it was just a dream, 
that you weren't real.

It couldn't have been you
laughing out loud, holding me; 
making our rankled past
disappear in insignificance.
It couldn't have been me
free to embrace you back; 
overjoyed to see you again
so happy and so vibrant.

I knew somehow
it had to be a dream, 
but I still didn't want to leave. 

I knew a man by sight, 
A blameless wight, 
Who, for a year or more, 
Had daily passed my door, 
Yet converse none had had with him. 

I met him in a lane, 
Him and his cane, 
About three miles from home, 
Where I had chanced to roam, 
And volumes stared at him, and he at me. 

In a more distant place 
I glimpsed his face, 
And bowed instinctively; 
Starting he bowed to me, 
Bowed simultaneously, and passed along. 

Next, in a foreign land 
I grasped his hand, 
And had a social chat, 
About this thing and that, 
As I had known him well a thousand years. 

Late in a wilderness 
I shared his mess, 
For he had hardships seen, 
And I a wanderer been; 
He was my bosom friend, and I was his. 

And as, methinks, shall all, 
Both great and small, 
That ever lived on earth, 
Early or late their birth, 
Stranger and foe, one day each other know. 

He was the apple of mine eyes
He taught me all about love
He was gentle in spirit
He was wise in his knowledge
He was patient 
He was kind
He captured my heart

He use to write poetry
Just like me
He inspired me to be
A poet that speaks from the heart
Trust worthy
Loving
He was a very gentle soul
I just hope I can be
Exactly like him 

A poet with meaning 
In every single word


I knew a woman, lovely in her bones, 
When small birds sighed, she would sigh back at them; 
Ah, when she moved, she moved more ways than one: 
The shapes a bright container can contain! 
Of her choice virtues only gods should speak, 
Or English poets who grew up on Greek 
(I'd have them sing in a chorus, cheek to cheek). 

How well her wishes went! She stroked my chin, 
She taught me Turn, and Counter-turn, and Stand; 
She taught me Touch, that undulant white skin; 
I nibbled meekly from her proferred hand; 
She was the sickle; I, poor I, the rake, 
Coming behind her for her pretty sake 
(But what prodigious mowing we did make). 

Love likes a gander, and adores a goose: 
Her full lips pursed, the errant notes to sieze; 
She played it quick, she played it light and loose; 
My eyes, they dazzled at her flowing knees; 
Her several parts could keep a pure repose, 
Or one hip quiver with a mobile nose 
(She moved in circles, and those circles moved). 

Let seed be grass, and grass turn into hay: 
I'm martyr to a motion not my own; 
What's freedom for? To know eternity. 
I swear she cast a shadow white as stone. 
But who would count eternity in days? 
These old bones live to learn her wanton ways: 
(I measure time by how a body sways). 

She sets
Beside me
In a booth
Her dress
A short-black-teaser
Above the knee
That
Made parts of my body move
At first sight
And 
I knew
She 
Would 
Be mine-

Later

Confirmed
With a stolen
Alleyway
Kiss
Grind
Grope
My hands
Found her
Ass
Beneath
Then 
Under
Her skirt
Cheeks
Bare
String
Up the middle
That 
I gently tugged
As we kissd
Pulling
Pressure
To 
Her spot
And 
I knew
She
Appreciated 
It
Now-

Setting
In a restaurant booth
One
Arm
Around 
Her
She teases me
With playful words
Coy
A little hard
Acting
Tough
In control-

I tell 
Her 
That 
If 
She 
Does not
Stop
I 
Will 
Spank 
Her 
When I get her home-

Then 
For emphasis, I lean close to her ear
And whisper 
Exactly
How

I will pull her skirt up
Twist her around
Letting my hand
Pull back and out
Then 
HARD
Slapping
Sharp
Between catching
Both 
Cheeks
Then 
Letting my fingers dive down
Across her rear
Below the string
To plunge
A stir
Into her
Sweetness
Then 
Pulling
Out 
Then
Doing it again
And again
And again
Until she is rosy red
And her panties
Are soaked-

For a whole
Minute
She stops
Eyes closed
Simply setting
Still
No chewing
Barely breathing
And
I feel the shiver
Crawl from her legs through her pelvis
To the top of her head.

She shakes a little more
Then
Her eyes open and
She turns to me
And says, 
"Let’s 
go 
NOW."

And 
I knew
She
Would be mine
Just
As I now 
Know
That she knew
That I
Was 
Hers.



The clocks don't have mercy
I knew you were trouble
And no work will distract me


I know
What I've
Been thru
With you. 

That's why
I'm never gonna
Come back to you


As I sd to my
friend, because I am
always talking,--John, I

sd, which was not his
name, the darkness sur-
rounds us, what

can we do against
it, or else, shall we &
why not, buy a goddamn big car,

drive, he sd, for
christ's sake, look
out where yr going. 

I know a man
who photographed the view he saw
from the window of the room where he made love
and not the face of the woman he loved there.




I know an aged Man constrained to dwell 
In a large house of public charity, 
Where he abides, as in a Prisoner's cell, 
With numbers near, alas! no company. 

When he could creep about, at will, though poor 
And forced to live on alms, this old Man fed 
A Redbreast, one that to his cottage door 
Came not, but in a lane partook his bread. 

There, at the root of one particular tree, 
An easy seat this worn-out Labourer found 
While Robin pecked the crumbs upon his knee 
Laid one by one, or scattered on the ground. 

Dear intercourse was theirs, day after day; 
What signs of mutual gladness when they met! 
Think of their common peace, their simple play, 
The parting moment and its fond regret. 

Months passed in love that failed not to fulfil, 
In spite of season's change, its own demand, 
By fluttering pinions here and busy bill; 
There by caresses from a tremulous hand. 

Thus in the chosen spot a tie so strong 
Was formed between the solitary pair, 
That when his fate had housed him 'mid a throng 
The Captive shunned all converse proffered there. 

Wife, children, kindred, they were dead and gone; 
But, if no evil hap his wishes crossed, 
One living Stay was left, and on that one 
Some recompence for all that he had lost. 

Oh that the good old Man had power to prove, 
By message sent through air or visible token, 
That still he loves the Bird, and still must love; 
That friendship lasts though fellowship is broken


I know destiny, fate intertwined, 
'neath a canopy of azure skies.
a poor repose, when its compared
to the light within my lovers eyes.
 
A million years, a million more, 
her smile tames, her beauty stuns   
and leaves me breathless, burns my soul 
with the pure light of ten thousand suns.

My selfishness cries out in fear, 
afraid that it might fade away.
That pride may die in her embrace, 
and sacrifice would rule the day.

Rules and reason do us wrong, 
unfair to call love 'yours' or 'mine'.
Amidst the truth of all concerns, 
the need and want for such.  

decline.


The tempest faced with strength of two, 
When strength is pressed by where we stand.
We find a peace within the gale, 
standing hand in blessed hand. 

I know I am but summer to your heart,
And not the full four seasons of the year;
And you must welcome from another part
Such noble moods as are not mine, my dear.
No gracious weight of golden fruits to sell
Have I, nor any wise and wintry thing;
And I have loved you all too long and well
To carry still the high sweet breast of Spring.
Wherefore I say: O love, as summer goes,
I must be gone, steal forth with silent drums,
That you may hail anew the bird and rose
When I come back to you, as summer comes.
Else will you seek, at some not distant time,
Even your summer in another clime. 

While sitting alone in my thought's today, 
I wonder what I am thinking, 
Of dreams and hopes I yet can live or of yesterday's? 
The dreams I live forever, 
I hope they never die, 
But yesterday's are in the past, 
They always seem to buy, 
Give up my dreams not ever, 
My hopes, I pray will live, 
My tomorrow will be, yesterday, 
Make them worth the gift, 
Each day I  live dreaming, 
Make room for hopes come true, 
If I make a good tomorrow, 
Then,  anything I can do
I live and learn for tomorrow, 
I hope and dream for today, 
But my tomorrow is here today, 
Soon to be yesterday, 
I will do myself  a favour
Take some time each day, 
To sit in thought on what was said? 
There are people who really think of me
Think of those  really care or just pretend, 
like I know I do. . 

I know them well, 
They will never call me a small poet even, 
As they like to publicize and promote
Their own group
As for self-praise and mutual admiration.


I know, I know it that you are in love, 
Yes, in love, 
The bees telling of the flower, 
Fragrance smacking of
And the ways taking me to
Holding the hands.

O, say you that you are, 
You are in love, 
The drizzling sunlight focussing upon, 
Sunnyness spread all round, 
The hills, dales, vales and rivers, 
They all, all have started calling, 
You are, yes, you are in love
And you admit that! 

Flowers smiling on the pathways and greeting you, 
Strong winds calling, 
Accept you, admit you
That you have given your heart to, 
You have fallen in love, 
Yes, love you, love you a girl


I plucked my soul out of its secret place, 
And held it to the mirror of my eye, 
To see it like a star against the sky, 
A twitching body quivering in space, 
A spark of passion shining on my face. 
And I explored it to determine why 
This awful key to my infinity 
Conspires to rob me of sweet joy and grace. 
And if the sign may not be fully read, 
If I can comprehend but not control, 
I need not gloom my days with futile dread, 
Because I see a part and not the whole. 
Contemplating the strange, I'm comforted 
By this narcotic thought: I know my soul. 

She promises, she smiles, she beguiles, 
but I know she lies, and through her smiles a child hides.
She says she'll be there for me, care for me, 
but when I call, she's never there.

Sometimes she telephones and I gush.
I smile even though I'm on my own.
Well, life's so full for her, you see, 
she hasn't time to spare for me.

Then came the change, work found me.
I became sought after, head hunted! 
I worked long hours, socialised, danced.
I became whole and my life was full.

She called me one day to complain, 
said I'd ignored her needs, 
done her ill deeds, was never there for her.
So I cancelled all my meetings, 

bought a train ticket and went to visit.
When I arrived I'd become invisible; ignored.
She promises, she smiles, she beguiles, 
but I know she lies. 

I know some people who lived rationally
I sometimes wonder whether they died the same way


Children are in the playground hours at a time, 
Parents get a much deserved break for them it’s fine, 
Many smiling faces as the ice cream truck drives near, 
America The Beautiful, we all had very little fear.
 
Playing tag football in the park one Saturday afternoon, 
Someone from the team limped off the field much too soon, 
One guy's too rough while the others are way too rowdy, 
Let’s hurry and finish the game, the skies are getting cloudy.
 
Eleven years ago to the day I met a young lady, 
Wow, was she ever a sight for my sore eyes, 
"Looks like you could use some ice packs" No, I said maybe dinner? 
She smiled and said yes, not football but in life I was a winner.

Our relationship blossomed then the new suddenly turned old, 
What sparkled with warmth and sunshine somehow became cold, 
Over a decade of separation as we each went our own paths of hurt, 
Too many years later why are we now members of the same church? 

Like sand in an hourglass and the old-time slips away, 
Or the sun replaces a moon as darkness is over taken by day, 
When toddlers grow older and no longer cry, "I have to potty, " 
These are positive changes in my life because, "I Know Somebody, "

Tell me, Jeff, exactly who is this Somebody that you know? 
And what do you mean by saying He is everywhere you go? 
How can He be standing here as we pray to make the total three? 
Because in looking around, my friend, I still only see you and me.

Often I have wondered why you’re always at peace, 
Situations that rattle me don’t disturb you in the least, 
Same neighborhood and schools we grew up together, 
How is it that when problems arise Jeff always come out better? 

OK, I can start with that for I certainly know how to read, 
Soon understanding there is only One necessary to please, 
So that’s all there is? So much more it seems like it should cost, 
Oh I definitely want to be found because I hate being lost.

At times you might feel that it is taking what seems like forever, 
When you have doubt and don’t believe then the word is never.
Just stand and keep on standing, He will show up with faith, 
Right after something happens you’ll see why you had to wait, 

 It is good to know that I’m no longer teetering on the brink, 
So tired of people telling me ten different wrong ways to think, 
Again, thank you so much, Jeff, for explaining exactly what is true, 
I can’t wait till I can proudly declare that, "I Know Somebody" too.




I know that I love you, my dear, yes! 

works with the infirm, comes home late, 
A role she plays, ordained by fate.
Study the tomes, all night long.
So can cut through, many a thong.
Pops a pill, to sack it late, 
across the bed, a pile of hate.

Few snatched moments, on the line.
Scarcely if ever; a quaff of wine.
Long now forgotten, is out to dine, 
weekends trudge, stringing laundry line.
Oh! Loved the firs and rustling pines
Cutting through wrists are daunting twines

	I know that I love you, my dear, yes! 

In a far off land only a name resides.
Hardly if ever the time coincides.
But a hope is kindled and kept alive.
A direction and path along which to strive.
Mops up home that's really not hers.
Nor was she ever gifted any furs.

A sweet simple girl, inside resides.
Needs an arm to hold and hide.
Who'll softly touch in a caring squeeze.
Who'll walk her along on the beech.
Look deep in her eyes and say not a bit.
Make her smile by his beam and wit.

	I know that I love you, my dear, yes! 



I know the face of Falsehood and her Tongue
Honeyed with unction, Plausible with guile,
Are dear to men, whom count me not among,
That owe their daily credit to her smile;
Such have been succoured out of great distress
By her contriving, if accounts be true:
Their deference now above the board, I guess,
Dishcharges what beneath the board is due.
As for myself, I'd liefer lack her aid
Than eat her presence; let this building fall:
But let me never lift my latch, afraid
To hear her simpering accents in the hall,
Nor force an entrance past mephitic airs
Of stale patchoulie hanging on my stairs. 

All sounds have been as music to my listening:
Pacific lamentations of slow bells,
The crunch of boots on blue snow rosy-glistening,
Shuffle of autumn leaves; and all farewells:

Bugles that sadden all the evening air,
And country bells clamouring their last appeals
Before [the] music of the evening prayer;
Bridges, sonorous under carriage wheels.

Gurgle of sluicing surge through hollow rocks,
The gluttonous lapping of the waves on weeds,
Whisper of grass; the myriad-tinkling flocks,
The warbling drawl of flutes and shepherds' reeds.

The orchestral noises of October nights
Blowing ( ) symphonetic storms
Of startled clarions ( )
Drums, rumbling and rolling thunderous and ( ).

Thrilling of throstles in the keen blue dawn,
Bees fumbling and fuming over sainfoin-fields. 

I KNOW the stars by their names,
Aldebaran, Altair,
And I know the path they take
Up heaven's broad blue stair.
I know the secrets of men
By the look of their eyes,
Their gray thoughts, their strange thoughts
Have made me sad and wise.
But your eyes are dark to me
Though they seem to call and call—
I cannot tell if you love me
Or do not love me at all.
I know many things,
But the years come and go,
I shall die not knowing
The thing I long to know. 

I know Thee, know Thee, 
Thy ways to man, 
Think I, 
Sometimes pride I over, 
But when asked to prove
Fail I in describing, 
As know I not, 
Just presume to be, 
Assume to be so. 



I know 'tis but a Dream, yet feel more anguish 
   Than if 'twere Truth. It has been often so:
   Must I die under it? Is no one near?
   Will no one hear these stifled groans and wake me



love was born
long time ago
from the womb
of sanctity

captivating hearts
tantalizing to eyes
magnetic to emotion
unrestrained all the way

roams all over the place
to your soul
to your being
with such demand
like to reach whatever

to the moon and the stars
travel across the ocean
hike the mountains
just for the thrill of it

but the essence of love
is just within
to cherish
the enlightenment
the serene of joy

and to the contrary
the unexplainable pain
the mental anguish
the sacrifices
the craziness

but despite all of this
we submit to the demand
because love
is what it is





I know what seeing is! 
As I saw you that  day for the first time 
So I know what liking is! 

I know what striking is! 
As I stroke stone against stone 
So I know what the spark is! 

I know what rubbing  is! 
As I rubbed heart against heart 
So I know what  love is! 

I know what  caring is! 
As I had been used to it since we met
So I know what  soft touch is! 

I know what  fire is! 
As I had been burning along with you 
So I know what nectar is! 

I know what compassion is! 
As I have experienced it   with you 
So I know what affection is! 

I know what addiction is! 
As I have been addicted to the smell of you 
So I know what obsession is! 

I know what memory is! 
As I have  experienced the break up 
So I know what the hurt is! 

I know what mistake is! 
As I have been the victim of misjudgement 
So I know what reconciliation is! 

I know what longing is! 
As I have  suffered from emptiness 
So I know what she is! 

I know what losing is! 
As I have  lost in the rough wind 
So I know what I miss!

I know, what not you
 The wind whistled, 
 As the street boy
 At dark  blind -alley. 

  

The man of eloquence
With all the aptness of words
 And craft of speech 
Silently sits on the fence 
Holding his tongue tight 
And see the fun when tasteless
 Jokes being cracked upon 
The poor, weak and downtrodden.  


But the dumb knows 
Neither rest nor respite 
Until he shoots his shouts 
Throws his disgust and anger 
Through the language of his body 
With the help of gesture 
Against the filth, lies 
Deception and injustice of an oppressor 

The man of rhetoric 
As if he knows neither the value 
Or the power of his logic 
His being mute is conspicuously inauspicious
As if he never joined to earn 
The right of freedom of speech  

Whereas, the dumb man
Knows the meaning of sound 
The value of the words 
So he tries to articulate them
With utmost care and sincerity 
Whenever he sees a slightest opportunity 
Against an unjust or a wrong 
As he knows speech is a special gift 
Either from nature or from god.

 
But the man with gift of the gab 
Wastes it when he holds his piece 
Or misuses it when he spreads 
 Hatred and blatant lies in fear, in greed. 

A free bird leaps on the back
Of the wind and floats downstream 
Till the current ends and dips his wing 
In the orange suns rays
And dares to claim the sky.

But a BIRD that stalks down his narrow cage
Can seldom see through his bars of rage
His wings are clipped and his feet are tied
So he opens his throat to sing.

The caged bird sings with a fearful trill
Of things unknown but longed for still
And his tune is heard on the distant hill for
The caged bird sings of freedom.

The free bird thinks of another breeze
And the trade winds soft through
The sighing trees
And the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright
Lawn and he names the sky his own.

But a caged BIRD stands on the grave of dreams
His shadow shouts on a nightmare scream
His wings are clipped and his feet are tied
So he opens his throat to sing.

The caged bird sings with
A fearful trill of things unknown
But longed for still and his
Tune is heard on the distant hill
For the caged bird sings of freedom. 



The sparkle in your eyes and sincerity of your smile
The trust in your heart and awareness for a while
The flash back of memories and strength that you show
The determination, optimism and decision's in a row
All tell me that you are still in there Ma.  ..

But then suddenly I see everything changes in the way
Fearfulness, insecurity and your teary eyes in the day
Your mood swings, forgetfulness, anxiety for a while
And your face with confusion without a glimpse of a smile
Even then I know you are still in there Ma.  . 

I wish to show patience to help and understand you 
I want to hold your hands, show love and hug you too
And hope I can learn to interpret your emotions call
And show empathy and care that you deserve above all
Because I know you are still in there Ma.  .

I want to assure you that you are very special dear Ma
You always live in the depth of my heart, spirit and soul
And you are a source of my strength and comfort in dole
And that is how I know you are still in there Ma.  




Lower my gaze, and hurry, full of dread,
Suddenly, silently, you still might rise
And I would have to gaze on all your grief
With my own eyes,
While you demand your happiness, that's dead.
I know, you walk beyond me, every night,
With a coy footfall, in a wretched dress
And walk for money, looking miserable!
The wind plays in your hair with lewd delight---
You walk, and walk, and find no home at all.






I, Lalla, willingly entered through the garden-gate,
There, O Joy! I found Siva united with Sakti;
There and then I got absorbed drinking at the Lake of Nectar.
Immune to harm am I, dead as I am to the world, though still alive.


I laugh, 
To pretend there's no pain.
I laugh, 
To make you feel okay.

I laugh, 
Because it's all a lie.
I laugh, 
Because I just can't cry.

I laugh, 
Because I need you near.
I laugh, 
Because you're just not here.

I laugh, 
Because you think I'm fine.
I laugh, 
'Cause I'm not okay inside.

I laugh, 
because I just don't know.
I laugh, 
because I'm gonna go.

I laugh, 
Because I need  you now, 
I laugh, 
Because you're gone, somehow.

I laugh, 
To hide myself from you.
I laugh, 
Because I have to. 

I laugh when I hear that the fish in the water is thirsty


You don't grasp the fact that what is most alive of all
      is inside your own house.
and so you walk from one holy city to the next with
      a confused look! 

Kabir will tell you the truth: go wherever you like,
      to Calcutta or Tibet; 
if you can't find where your soul is hidden,
for you the world will never be real


I am willing to maintain my ability to confront, 
but it is impossible, because of my environment. 
to omit a debate. 
The fact is i don't give up without a fight, 
hence i apply my strategic terms & conditions.I learned—at least—what Home could be—
How ignorant I had been
Of pretty ways of Covenant—
How awkward at the Hymn

Round our new Fireside—but for this—
This pattern—of the Way—
Whose Memory drowns me, like the Dip
Of a Celestial Sea—

What Mornings in our Garden—guessed—
What Bees—for us—to hum—
With only Birds to interrupt
The Ripple of our Theme—

And Task for Both—
When Play be done—
Your Problem—of the Brain—
And mine—some foolisher effect—
A Ruffle—or a Tune—

The Afternoons—Together spent—
And Twilight—in the Lanes—
Some ministry to poorer lives—
Seen poorest—thro' our gains—

And then Return—and Night—and Home—

And then away to You to pass—
A new—diviner—care—
Till Sunrise take us back to Scene—
Transmuted—Vivider—

This seems a Home—
And Home is not—
But what that Place could be—
Afflicts me—as a Setting Sun—
Where Dawn—knows how to be—I met a friend
She dreams 
about the summer
The flowers are on the table
Soon, 
she’ll sing, 
like Luciano Pavarotti
Without an audience

Her finial
Would be filled
With dithyramb.  . 
And phylactery




I left my head 
somewhere 
today. 
Put it down for 
just 
a minute. 
Under the 
table? 
On a chair? 
Wish I were 
able 
to say 
where. 
Everything I need 
is 
in it

I left my heart in a parking lot, 
Somewhere between a passed-out wino
And a cement block.
I extended my hand 
She didn't take it.
I offered everything I had, all that I am, 
She didn't want it
- just wasn't part of the plan.
Another dream left to rot
Where 'what if's and 'could've been's go
Until they fade and are forgot.
Who knows what of us died 
Then and there 
On that unmarked spot? 
(It's)    Funny how the deepest cut
Seem' to start with 
'I like you, BUT. 'I like a look of Agony,
Because I know it's true—
Men do not sham Convulsion,
Nor simulate, a Throe—

The Eyes glaze once—and that is Death—
Impossible to feign
The Beads upon the Forehead
By homely Anguish strung. 


By A Foreigner

I like Canadians.
They are so unlike Americans.
They go home at night.
Their cigarettes don't smell bad.
Their hats fit.
They really believe that they won the war.
They don't believe in Literature.
They think Art has been exaggerated.
But they are wonderful on ice skates.
A few of them are very rich.
But when they are rich they buy more horses
Than motor cars.
Chicago calls Toronto a puritan town.
But both boxing and horse-racing are illegal
In Chicago.
Nobody works on Sunday.
Nobody.
That doesn't make me mad.
There is only one Woodbine.
But were you ever at Blue Bonnets?
If you kill somebody with a motor car in Ontario
You are liable to go to jail.
So it isn't done.
There have been over people killed by motor cars
In Chicago
So far this year.
It is hard to get rich in Canada.
But it is easy to make money.
There are too many tea rooms.
But, then, there are no cabarets.
If you tip a waiter a quarter
He says 'Thank you.'
Instead of calling the bouncer.
They let women stand up in the street cars.
Even if they are good-looking.
They are all in a hurry to get home to supper
And their radio sets.
They are a fine people.
I like them. 

i like for you to be still
it is as though you are absent
And you hear me from far away
And my voice does not touch you
it seems as though your eyes had flown away
And it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth
As all things are filled with my soul
You emerge from the things
Filled with my soul
You are like my soul
A butterfly of dream
And you are like the word: Melancholy

i like for you to be still
And you seem far away
it sounds as though you are lamenting
A butterfly cooing like a dove
And you hear me from far away
And my voice does not reach you
Let me come to be still in your silence
And let me talk to you with your silence
That is bright as a lamp
Simple, as a ring
You are like the night
With its stillness and constellations
Your silence is that of a star
As remote and candid

i like for you to be still
it is as though you are absent
Distant and full of sorrow
So you would've died
One word then, One smile is enough
And i'm happy;
Happy that it's not true


I like poems that are
Technically flawed, imperfectly unique
When everything doesn’t rhyme
To convention, and there are
Surprising turns that zip

Capturing journeys of the spirit
Raw emotions of the heart
When laughter and delight 
At play in dappled sunlight
Cast their spell, with deft word-art

Inspiring stories of everyday heroes
Ironic legends of mountain-men
Tragic stories of love and war 
And the delightfully universal 
Everydayness, of wicked puns! 

I like poems that innately rhyme
To the special music imprinted 
In every soul, its almost like listening 
To a fascinating fable 
Around a warm campfire told


I like rain 

Lots of rain

To splash in the puddles

And jump, again and again 


I take an umbrella 

And twirl it around 

See the raindrops whirring

And splash to the ground


I like running in the rain 

To shout with my friends

When we are wet

And look like clowns


I like that you are crazy not with me,
I like that I'm not with you crazy, either,
That ne'er the heavy planet's globe will be
Drifting away under our feet, quite easy.
I like that one might funny be and brave,
And free-behaved - and not to play words, rather,
And not to blush with choking a wave,
At easy touching just a sleeve another's.

I thank you with my hand and all my heart
For loving me (that you don't even know!),
For the sweet peace, I own in the night,
For the scarce meeting in the eve's fast flow,
For our not-walking under the moonlight,
For our not-standing under the sun's glow -
That not with me - alas - you lose your mind,
That not with you - alas - I lose my own. 



I like to see it lap the miles,
And lick the valleys up,
And stop to feed itself at tanks;
And then, prodigious, step

Around a pile of mountains,
And, supercilious, peer
In shanties by the sides of roads;
And then a quarry pare

To fit its sides, and crawl between,
Complaining all the while
In horrid, hooting stanza;
Then chase itself down hill

And neigh like Boanerges;
Then, punctual as a star,
Stop--docile and omnipotent--
At its own stable door. 

Now, I like violence 
But, whenever I do it
I can hear you people moan

But, I see nothing wrong
With a punch in the face
A knife to the back
Or a good car chase

So, if you want feelings
Birds and bees and trees
Stay away from The Crow
Cause,  I like things that bleed

And I like to smoke weed
And take long pee's
Drive a great speed
And yell at the TV
ect.


I guess I'm weird (sarcastically said) , right

I like you calm, as if you were absent,
and you hear me far-off, and my voice does not touch you.
It seems that your eyelids have taken to flying:
it seems that a kiss has sealed up your mouth.
Since all these things are filled with my spirit,
you come from things, filled with my spirit.
You appear as my soul, as the butterfly’s dreaming,
and you appear as Sadness’s word.
I like you calm, as if you were distant,
you are a moaning, a butterfly’s cooing.
You hear me far-off, my voice does not reach you.
Let me be calmed, then, calmed by your silence.
Let me commune, then, commune with your silence,
clear as a light, and pure as a ring.
You are like night, calmed, constellated.
Your silence is star-like, as distant, as true.
I like you calm, as if you were absent:
distant and saddened, as if you were dead.
One word at that moment, a smile, is sufficient.
And I thrill, then, I thrill: that it cannot be so.

In the betting line the other
day
man behind me asked,
"are you Henry
Chinaski?"

"uh huh," I answered.

"I like your books," he went
on.

"thanks," I answered.

"who do you like in this
race?" he asked.

"uh uh," I answered.

"I like the horse," he
told me.

I made my bet and went back
to my seat

the next race I am standing in
line and here is this same man
standing behind me
again.
there are at least lines at
the windows but
he has to find mine
again.

"I think this race favors the
closers," he said to the back of
my neck. "the track looks
heavy


"listen," I said, not looking
around, "it's the kiss of death to
talk about horses at the
track..




Therefore my Love leads me inconstantly on
And when I believe there is too much sadness
Without thinking I find myself all free of  pain

And so when I believe my joy is so certain
And reaches the heights of my desire's gladness
I come once again to my incipient sickness. 


I don't know its name

I cry by the river 
I don't know its name

I die by the river
I don't know its name

I breathe by the river 
I don't know its name

but each droplet sings me
and fills me just the same





I live in the Twentieth Century 
and you lie here beside me. You 
were unhappy when you fell asleep. 
There was nothing I could do about 
it. I felt hopeless. Your face 
is so beautiful that I cannot stop 
to describe it, and there's nothing 
I can do to make you happy while 
you sleep. 

I will give my life for you
Do you know that it’s true
Coz I know my heart was made
Just for you- for you

(instrumental)  

Help me baby
I think I’m going insane
Everytime you cross my mind
I forget what it’s like
To cry

I’ve tried so many times
To erase you out of my mind
But the more I tried
The more I crave for your smile- your smile

I live my life 
Give what my heart desires
Just to reach you
And for your love
Everytime you smile at me
I forget all my fears
I live life
With just one smile

I live for this moment
First time, you smile
It makes me feel alright
Can’t define (can’t define)  
The way you touch my life
With your smile

I live my life
With my dreams
With my fears
And it’s what makes me real

I live my life
To love
And to cry
And to feel that
One special smile

(Repeat Chorus )UP out of the slime of human existence
I live like a DOG without resistance

I see, hear, smell and sense what is NOW
Much more than the frog, Man or cow

I live like a dog, right here and now
Some might say my talk is Bow-Wow

I don't study the Moon, Sun nor tomorrow
No Time, always timeless
no time for yesterday's pain, sorrow

Now I'm aware of all that IS
I'm changing my name, more fitting it is

Ruffus Barklay Wagner or Rex for short
I'm here for the petting, the food and sport

That is all

out of doors
no walls

not even
cat calls

Ruff is my life
Waggin' my game
Rex is my name
BOW-
W 
insane


I had a dream, I had a dream
That I saw you taking your clothes off
Your body glistening through the window lit by candle
You saw me stare, you didn’t care 
‘Cause you knew that the two of us were in love
You stepped outside in the nighttime sky and told me to come
It was the best, you were the best
We went skinny dipping out in the lake
Even though the water slid like oil off our skin
I didn’t wake, I couldn’t wait
And we made love under the starry sky
You kissed the scars off my skin, I couldn’t believe

But it really didn’t happen and I’m sad to know

[Chorus]
Everyday I long to feel your touch and
Every night I fall asleep alone and scared and
Every time I see you now you hurt me more but
I’ll always come back for more
I’ll always come back for more

I had a dream, I had a dream 
That I crawled out from under the ground
As I wept, the cross bled
Like a rain of astronomical visage
I drowned in this crimson pool and I was free (I was free!) 

But it really didn’t happen and I’m sad to know

[Chorus]

I see your face (I’ll always come back) 
I hear your songs (I’ll always come back) 
I still feel your skin (I’ll always come back) 
I’ll always come back (I’ll always come back) 
For more

Everyday I long to feel your touch and
Every night I fall asleep alone and scared and 
Every time I see you now you’re killing me but
I’ll always come back for more
I’ll always come back for
Everyday I fight the urge to kiss your hand
Every night I fight the urge to call your house
Every time I see you now you hurt me more but
I’ll always come back for more
I’ll always come back for more


I'll always love you till death do us part
I'll always love you with all of my heart
I'll worship you and build you a kingdom

I'll always smile at your beautiful face
No one knows exactly the way it makes me feel
It makes me feel twice younger my old age
Within my bones it quells every fire of rage

I'll always love you and remember your name
You made me shine; yes you brought me fame
I'll always love you and place no one above you


Because without you, there'd probably be no methe melancholy measures of the way
they used to write poetry
laying gold ingots side by side

then garnishing them with silver.
the moon disappearing every time
in the books on the cloudy Romantics

on my grandmother's/mother's bookshelf.
or they are edged with lace
as if they were valentines.

but they were, you insisted
and wanted to take all the poems
to school on Valentine's Day

to be read aloud.

who would listen
with the intercom blaring
every other minute with

announcements of school spirit
of snow days to come. 

pop quizzes popping
and talent shows full up

with tap dancing cheer leaders
brilliant in silver tap shoes, 
modest showgirl costumes.

ask if I feel nostalgic for this: 
I'll always say, no.

but rarely is found
Happiness is abiding
only in the NOW
 all around

It will never be
down the road a bit
nor will it be
when there is more wit

All that lies ahead
 in future is false
it's here right now 
dancing the NOW Waltz

If true happiness
 is not my lot
wrong interpretations 
I have bought

When all that disturbs
loses it power
happiness is restored
in that holy hour

Good fortune? 
'Maybe' or 'Is it so? '
I don't judge, 
just glow with the flow


For everything you are
For everything you have been
For making my life whole
For awakening life in me again
For being that ray of hope
For giving me faith to carry on
For giving me the courage to fight
Thank you my beloved son

Lauren Caitlin Upton must have gone to the state of Washington, 
(see observation which has Upton in its title to find what she said) 
She going west not east to get home, 
If she had a map then she could not miss, 
Because I firmly believe that she or her kin, 
Had made the newsletter informing the parents of Hutton School, 
That the holidays, the aforementioned in the title, 
Were the ones that were notated, 
If you had believed in Koran, Torah, Amnesty International, 
Some African American Holiday that was formed  
You were politically correct, 
In you believed in the New Testament, forget that date.
By the way Upton responded the question that was posed to her, 
By the way the Spokane School district handled the December newsletter, 
We are dumbing down America, 
We are in a lot of trouble, 
We are getting worse not better.



I will be knocking on the door
Knock knock knock
Knocking at deaths door
Begging to be let in.

I'm near to deaths door
An overdose
And slit wrists
Along besides me.

Knock knock
Please let me in
deaths door
Please open

Please let me in
I hate my life 
I cant cope
I'm desperate
plase let me in

Deaths door has opened
Now I've left it all behind
I'm in deaths world
Im gone 
Im free


I don't know when i can start writing again
my mind is floating somewhere i don't know, 
when it will drop again.
Can't think of what topic to write
love, friendship, nature, life, death
heartbreak or heartache? .

Scrolled up and down
i started to write but left hanging
eyes on my tablet but i saw nothing
frown.. yawning.

sometimes my thoughts underneath the ocean
 goes deeper without a plan
sometimes my thoughts flew high
flows and froze.

I'll come back soon


When  I  wake  in  early  morn, 
Each  time  the  day  is  new.
As  I'll  die  loving  you.

As  I  sit  alone  and  pray 
And  cling  to  love  so  true, 
I'll  hope  to  see  you  once  today
As  I'll  die  loving  you.

When  I  see  the  stars  at  night, 
I  wonder  if  you  do.
And  hope  they  have  us  both  in  sight
As  I'll  die  loving  you.

When  I  take  my  final  rest, 
This  day,  if  life  is  through; 
That  I  died  loving  you. 

I will die tonight, I will die
No longer a lifes burden.
No longer a strain.
To get through the day.

I will end my pain tonight
I will be gone a long way.
Life was shit
I had enough shit.

I never thought things could be so bad
I trusted the wrong sort
only to have it broken 
time and time again

I will die tonight 
My death is near
I slit my wrists

Now I'm dying 
not long to go
I am free of pain


Barber, barber, come and get me;
Hairy torrents irk and fret me.
Hair and hair again appears;
And climbs like ivy round my ears.
Hair across my collar gambols;
Down my neck it wayward ambles.
Ever down it trip it tickles;
Yes, where it trips it tickles.
Barber dear I wish I knew;
Why i do not visit you.
Why I grudge the minutes ten;
In your smiling den.
Why I choose to choke on hair;
Rather than to mount your chair.
Men no busier than I;
Weekly to your office hie.
Men no busier than myself;
Confront the armory on your shelf;
Men no wealthier than me;
Gladly meet your modest fee.
And for a fraction of a dollar;
Keep the jungle off their collar.
I alone am shy and flustered;
Solitary, cowardly custard.
Shaggy as a prize angore;
Overrun with the creeping flora.
Barber, barber, you’re in luck;
The bell has rung, the hour has struck.
Sloth strong, the hair is strong;
I cannot stand it any long.
Barber, barber here I come;
Shake up the odorous bay rum.
Bring on your shears your scythes, your snippers;
Bring on your crisp electric driers.
Employ a dozen extra sweepers;
Bring giant harvesters and reapers.
I warn you a bumper crop;
Waits to overwhelm your shop.
Braber, barber, be verbose;
Be anything but clip me close.
Leave me razored, leave me scissored
Leave me hairless, as a lizard;
Barber, barber, single and scald;
Barber can’t you make me bald?
I will be the happiest of men;
And never think of you again. 

I’ll give you a flower, mother
I’ll give you a flower, dear
For life is but a garden
To children of years

I’ll give you a flower, mother
I’ll give you a flower, dear
For to a bride, they’re lovely
Mother, hold your tears

I’ll give you a flower, mother
I’ll give you a flower, dear
I’ll lay it in your sweet hands
For our time has disappeared

I’ll give you a flower, mother
I’ll give you a flower, dear
When I see you there at heaven
When my time’s done here


Was this a terrorist deed?  
Was this the KGB? 
 Impossible.
It was one of our own, 
 in the NAVY.

Commander Michael Portland of the USS Hampton was relieved of his duty, 
For falsifying documents on the up keep of nuclear reactor on board.

Nimitz would be rolling in his grave, 
The commander failure to upkeep the proper of function of the water pumps, 
Could render the reactor to a critical mass, 
-overheat and create unchecked radio-activity.
His wasn’t derelict with his duty, 
-this was insanity.

If not unchecked, him and his crew would go an endless Voyage to the Bottom of Sea.
It’s good that the crew did not go Davy Jones’ Locker, 
As did the submarine, SSN-called the Thresher.

(



)Distant memories lost in time, 
I close my eyes and think of you.
Memories of the way we were, 
Glaze my eyes, like morning dew.

I hear your voice so clearly now, 
A loving smile, lights up your face.
We walk together, hand in hand, 
Then head for home, that special place.

I miss your love, I miss those times, 
The love you shared, your love for me.
It broke my heart, you fell asleep, 
No greater friend will ever be.

I'll hold your memory close to heart, 
Your love will flow within my veins.
I'll hold you close, right to the end, 
My dear Mum, we'll meet again. 

I'll stop loving you when 
Diamonds never sparkle 
And flowers cease to grow 
When thunder doesn't echo 
And rivers do not flow 
When hearts no longer wonder 
And hands are never held 
When smiles are only memories 
And hope is never felt 
When trees no long blossom 
And the stars refuse to shine
When autumn has no falling leaves 
And winter no longer dies 
When time has no more tomorrows 
And rainbows have no hue 
Then I'll still be in Love with you! 
When hot isnt hot
And cold isnt cold
When people grow young
Instead of old
When one plus one
Doesnt equal two
Then I will still be in love with you


I never forget what happened
I'll never forget what they did.
They used rape and abuse
To have power over me.

I'll always remember
Will I ever forget.
I long to break free
And take back my life.
The rape and abuse 
Has held me back for to long.

One day I will reclaim
What was taken from me


I promise you, I’ll never ever leave your side
I promise you, I’ll never desert you my bride
I’ll always be the safest shelter where you can hide
I’ll always be the one, in whom you can confide

I’ll forever stay stuck to you like a fish to its fin
Together, we’ll saunter through thick and thin
Weathering all the growling storms of our life
And you’ll always be my #irreplaceable wife

I’ll glow like the full moon over your darkest sky
I’ll always be the man who led you down the aisle
I’ll never intentionally make you feel awfully low
I won’t ever leave you to the comfort of your pillow

When you walk, I’ll walk with you in the boulevards
I’ll be your aces and hearts in an endless pack of cards
And when you decide to go alone, I’ll be your shadow
I’ll trail your footprints through the cold paths of snow

There is nothing that I wouldn’t do to be by your side
How I wish my bony ribcages could lock you up inside
I’ll be willing to defensively pull up my sharp edged sword
To show you how well I mean every single bit of my words


It's hard to lose a true friend, even if you are not feeling alone.
Is it possible for the prince to sacrifice with his princess for the throne? ! 
Is it possible for the clouds of evil to blow, after the flowers had grown? ! 
Before him/her you were in this dark world lonely thrown, 
till he/ came to your life, then a big smile on your face is drawn.
Now, I'm in my painful ocean of tears drown.

When I need him, I find him there.
When I'm in troubles, I hear his advices everywhere.
No one accepts to lose his friend, no one can even dare.
Yet, I lost my friend, and my life turned to a nightmare.

The disability isn't in being a deaf or a blind.
It's in missing the one who's always behind.

To me loosing a friend, is like loosing my life.
That's why I'm feeling now, that I'm not alive. 

I'll not confer with Sorrow 
Till to-morrow; 
But Joy shall have her way 
This very day.

Ho, eglantine and cresses 
For her tresses!-- 
Let Care, the beggar, wait 
Outside the gate.

Tears if you will--but after 
Mirth and laughter; 
Then, folded hands on breast 
And endless rest. 

Come, let me show you my home
Child, oh so greatful one
From the abandoned roads you roam
Child, oh so greatful one
Your ribs prove your hunger so
Your bare feet show your chill
The cuts and bruises show your woe
I'll help you, oh, yes I will
Come let me hold you close by
Draw me close to your beaten image now
No, you aren't going to die
Come let me help you somehow
This world you've seen isn't so caring
You've wandered upon its fragile ground
Stealing your hopes to them is daring
Don't be so down, don't be so down
Now you must come, let me show you my home
Child, oh so greatful one
From the abandoned roads you've roamed
Child, oh so greatful one


I'll stand by you
When you're blue
I'll stand by you
And make you feel new
I'll stand by you
Just like your silhouette
Like a shade over your head
Through your darkest hour
When you feel the world is over
And I promise I'll never leave you


I'd be honored to sit 
With y'all 
I'll start out with a fine chablis 
Civil-ed Spirits 
Are so very important 
Don't You agree? 



'I'll tell thee everything I can;
There's little to relate,
I saw an aged, aged man,
A-sitting on a gate.
'Who are you, aged man?' I said.
'And how is it you live?'
And his answer trickled through my head
Like water through a sieve.

He said, 'I look for butterflies
That sleep among the wheat;
I make them into mutton-pies,
And sell them in the street.
I sell them unto men,' he said,
'Who sail on stormy seas;
And that's the way I get my bread
A trifle, if you please.'

But I was thinking of a plan
To dye one's whiskers green,
And always use so large a fan
That they could not be seen.
So, having no reply to give
To what the old man said,
I cried, 'Come, tell me how you live!'
And thumped him on the head.

His accents mild took up the tale;
He said, 'I go my ways,
And when I find a mountain-rill,
I set it in a blaze;
And thence they make a stuff they call
Rowland's Macassar Oil
Yet twopence-halfpenny is all
They give me for my toil.'

But I was thinking of a way
To feed one's self on batter,
And so go on from day to day
Getting a little fatter.
I shook him well from side to side,
Until his face was blue,
'Come, tell me how you live,' I cried,
'And what it is you do!'

He said, 'I hunt for haddocks' eyes
Among the heather bright,
And work them into waistcoat-buttons
In the silent night.
And these I do not sell for gold
Or coin of silvery shine,
But for a copper halfpenny,
And that will purchase nine.

'I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,
Or set limed twigs for crabs;
I sometimes search the grassy knolls
For wheels of hansom-cabs.
And that's the way' (he gave a wink)
'By which I get my wealth
And very gladly will I drink
Your honor's noble health.'

I heard him then, for I had just
Completed my design
To keep the Menai bridge from rust
By boiling it in wine.
I thanked him much for telling me
The way he got his wealth,
But chiefly for his wish that he
Might drink my noble health.

And now, if e'er by chance I put
My fingers into glue,
Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot
Into a left-hand shoe,
Or if I drop upon my toe
A very heavy weight,
I weep, for it reminds me so
Of that old man I used to know
Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow,
Whose hair was whiter than the snow,
Whose face was very like a crow,
With eyes, like cinders, all aglow,
Who seemed distracted with his woe,
Who rocked his body to and fro,
And muttered mumblingly and low,
As if his mouth were full of dough,
Who snorted like a buffalo
That summer evening long ago,
A-sitting on a gate. 

I'll wait for the day, when the man becomes a dog 
All he can do- is to bark
I'll wait for the day, when he knows how it feels
To live with a- broken heart

And that day my friend, is waiting for us all
Waiting for us all to be men

I'll wait for the day, when birds again will sing-a song
The one, everyone- can hear 
I'll wait for the day, when the trees are allowed to breathe 
The air- that nobody owns

And that day my friend, is waiting for us all
Waiting for us all to be free

I'll wait for the day, when our tears won't be sour
Nobody ever- has to cry
I'll wait for the day, when I've to wait NO MORE
I'll live in a world- full of smiles

And that day my friend, is waiting for us all
Waiting for us all to believe¬¬I'll wait for you certainly my lovely princess
Inasmuch as it brings to you, intense happiness
I desire you in a way that may mar your life
But now, I'll wait for you to become my wife
I wouldn't take it as though you're so adamant
I feel you - you're scared of becoming pregnant
I'd lay low and wait until that undeniable day
When we shall be married and do things our way
Without hiding ourselves in secret or dark places
Then we shall stare lasciviously into our faces
Realizing our patient wait was worth the while
Thereafter we shall live each day with a smile
And I think I've got the answer to your question
I'll wait for you without any feeling of frustration


I lock the door.
Thinking what the heck.
I havent nothing left to live for.
I have noubt left to give.
I simply cannot forgive.

I locked the door.
Shutting the rest of the world out.
Knowing it'll be over soon.

I locked the door.
Taking the razor to my wrist.
And cut my throat.
As the blood spurts out.
It'll be over soon.

As they break down the door.
It's to late now.
I've gone.
Im dead.
And this time you couldnt stop me. 

I LONG FOR LIVES I NEVER HAD

I long for lives I never had
For women I never knew
For the joy of being with them 
And for the dream of our intimacy-

I long for lives I never had
And never will have-

And as I approach the end 
I long too for my own life 
that soon will cease to exist. 

And wonder 
What is it like to cut? 
Why would anyone 
Want to cut them self’s
I can understand the pain
I can understand the anguish
Quite a few times I wanted to end my life
But why for the life of me I cannot understand
Why why


would you want to cut yourself
This is a requiring question that seems to be ongoing
Just baffles me why you would want to even cut yourself with a knife
Sigh-I look at my wrists in dismay-it would be horrible to be disfigured
I would regret for the rest of my life what I have done out of remorse
I just don’t understand-really I don’t-shot me if you must-what ever you want
Just please I ask you from one human being to another stop your cuttings
It just kills your living soul
I have memories that I would like to gouge out of my soul
But I have to live with them for the rest of my life
So don’t tell me I don’t know what I am talking about
It’s an ongoing battle and damn it I’m still here
I will always be a part of me, pain


misery-fear 
But hell at least I bloody faced it, accepted it, it’s just there
Sad to say it’s a part of fucken life-sigh
Sorry excuse my profanity just then
Just so passionate about being human 
And wanting to live my life


I LOOK into my glass,
       And view my wasting skin,
       My heart had shrunk as thin!"

     For then, I, undistrest
       By hearts grown cold to me,
     Could lonely wait my endless rest
       With equanimity.

     But Time, to make me grieve,
       Part steals, lets part abide;
     And shakes this fragile frame at eve
       With throbbings of noontide. 

I look up at the sky
And what do I see? 
smiling at me. 

I LOOK UP AT THE SKY/ AND WAIT FOR A POEM 

I look up at the sky 
And wait for a poem- 
The deep dark green of this park surrounds me -
I have been blessed by so much
I have been given so much in my life-

This cool beautiful Yerushalmi night 

I looked here; 
I looked there; 
Nowhere could I see my love. 
And -- this time -- 
She was in my heart. 
Truly, then, I have no complaint, 
For though she be fair and fairer, 
She is none so fair as she 
In my heart. 

We were always together, 
We swore we'd never part.
Where I was, there you were, 
Best of friends from the start.
We both looked alike, 
With hair and eyes of brown.
When you were happy, I smiled, 
When I was upset you'd frown.
There was only you in my world, 
And no one but me in yours.
We shared everything friends could share, 
Our music, our clothes, our chores.
Then suddenly this friendship we knew, 
Began to change too fast.
The magic of 'us' has dissappeared, 
It was clear this wouldn't last.
We struggled and struggled to save it all, 
We were put to the ultimate test.
And even though I lost a friend, 
I somehow gained a me. 

When the world was awake
in awe of the dazzling light
showered by your resplendent face, 
I was slumbering in a corner
amidst the darkness of ignorance.

Filled with voidness, now, 
have all my life to rue, 
love could have blossomed, 
but instead, it flew.

Smiling at my ill fate, 
I feel I didn't deserve you
And that must be the reason why, 
I lost you. 

I love to see the dawn break 
across an empty sky. 
I love to hear two hearts beat 
as love captures two 
within a wink of an eye. 
I love to see the world awake 
every morning every day. 
I love to see all the wonders 
the world has to show. 
Everyday is different 
from the one we leave behind. 
We should appreciate it 
while we have it 
before we are left behind.

September  love-

I love your hair 
I love your eyes
I love your voice
I love every thing about you

I love the cute way you dress
I love your cricked smile
I love your dimples
I love every thing about you

I love the ring you always wear
I love the color of your hair
I love your height
I love every thing about you

I love your kindness
I love your love for everything
I love every thing about you 
I love you


I love a Saudi girl
And shall continue to love her, 
Even though hate you, 
I shall continue to love you, 
As religion does not teach
Hatred and vengeance. 

My love for him is true and great, 
But the fate is not for us, 
So we keep it for ourselves, 
And let destiny finds us in time.


I love him, , , 
And still i am waiting, , , 
Heaven knows, , , 
I will be yours forever. 

I love
loving you
ridiculously often

You
encourage me
to savour the ecstasy of us

You 
share my bliss
respond like no other

I love
loving 
you


I am ME
And I do ME always
Good luck finding YOU 
And good luck doing YOU
 
Why even bother to do ME? 
When YOU not ME
Why even bother? 
Any other ME is a fake! 
 
Do not look at ME
I am different
Do not compare MY luck to YOURS
They are totally different
 
MY swag is MY swag
MY luck is MY luck
MY tragedy is MY tragedy
None bears a resemblance to YOU
 
You are not better than ME
Listen carefully. 
I never said, I was better than YOU
If YOU get this, YOU have got it all
 
Go find YOU
Get an appreciation for YOU
And the next time YOU see ME
Note that, I am not YOU
 
And that's just the way it is
And that's how it's going to be. 
Why waste time trying to be who YOU not? 
When YOU could be discovering YOURSELFMusic is what i love
The beat that makes me feel good inside
That's why I keep you close all the time
In my house, my headphones and even in my ride

When I plummet you pick me up from the ground
With you in my life I'll never frown
Because you make my world go round
Just know that we'll be best friends as long as you keep me around


I love loving my Daddy, 
I love it when he gives me love, 
It started when i was years old, 
It used to hurt when my Daddy loved me, 
But recently it started feeling good, 
I love it when he creeps into my room late at night, 
And reminds me as always that its our little secret, 
And that everyone does it they just dont like to talk about it, 
No wonder everyone does it when it feels so good, 
I love it when he touches my neck, 
To my lower soft spot, 
He touches so gently yet firmly, 
Slow then fast, 
then he lifts my arms above my head while kissing me passionately, 
Then he puts my arms around his neck and instructs me to wrap my legs around his waist, 
Then hands on my bottom he enters me, 
Pushing, harder and faster, he starts groaning, 
I groan wioth him, my Daddy feels so damn good, 
Then finaly we release, and my Daddy leaves me, 
Always whispering, 
Its our little secret. 

To be apart of a family like mine 
is so divine 
where love is shown 
hurt is shared 
our love for each other is never impaired 

we talk 
we laugh 
we cry 
but we are a family 
and we do it all together 
for as a family 
we do it all as one 

you hurt one 
you hurt all 
and as a family unit 
we will all stand tall 
for we are family 
a family full of strength 
a family full of love 
a family no one can touch 
that, s why I love my family so much. 

I love my life, but not too well
To give it to thee like a flower,
So it may pleasure thee to dwell
Deep in its perfume but an hour.
I love my life, but not too well.

I love my life, but not too well
To sing it note by note away,
So to thy soul the song may tell
The beauty of the desolate day.
I love my life, but not too well.

I love my life, but not too well
To cast it like a cloak on thine,
Against the storms that sound and swell
Between thy lonely heart and mine.
I love my life, but not too well. 

I love my teacher
He is full of life
I love my teacher
He doesn't cause any strife
I love my teacher
For he is full of light
I love my teacher
He is always bright
I love my teacher 
For he doesn't get in a fight
And, I love my teacher
For he tells me to look on the side that's bright

dusty RED

I LOVE REDThe India, 
Is affectionately known as the Hindustan, 
And as, that is Bharat
Whenever I think of the India
It always makes me pride.

From Kashmir to Kanyakumari
From the curving mountains of the State Uttaranchal
And the North-East, 
To the restful shores of Goa beach
And all the wonderful sights in between
That indeed by everyone should be seen.
Whenever I across our wonderful country
specially on highways, 
The beautiful, wonderful sights I see
Make me feel very glad to be born in India.

Also, if one attend our many high schools, 
colleges or Universities
And glance through live, will succeed
The India. is a very nice place to be, indeed. 

but what if the lights do not love me

I'm too human to build in the words of air
flesh triggers dust bone deep despair


I love the smiling you

I love the smiling you
Oh I love the smiling you
Ruffling my senses
Unguarded me from  fences
Life has nothing for me in lieu
When I see the smiling you
As I love the smiling you

Emotions are tantalizing
Feelings are fraternizing
Surprises are getting surprised
All these I never surmise
When I see  the smiling you
As I love the smiling you

I love the smiling you
Oh I love the smiling you 
My pains are getting vexed
Now they're really  stressed
Failures are getting redressed
Seek nothing but only success
I feel like a man born anew
When I see the smiling you
Oh I love the smiling you 



I love the volumes of Thy Word;
What light and joy those leaves afford
To souls benighted and distressed!
Thy precepts guide my doubtful way,
Thy fear forbids my feet to stray,
Thy promise leads my heart to rest.

From the discoveries of Thy law
The perfect rules of life I draw;
These are my study and delight:
Not honey so invites the taste,
Nor gold that hath the furnace past
Appears so pleasing to the sight.

Thy threat'nings wake my slumb'ring eyes,
And warn me where my danger lies;
That makes my guilty conscience clean,
Converts my soul, subdues my sin,
And gives a free, but large reward.

Who knows the errors of his thoughts?
And from presumptuous sins restrain:
Accept my poor attempts of praise,
That I have read Thy book of grace,
And book of nature, not in vain. 

I love the way you make me laugh
I love the way you make me cry
Tears of joy stream from my eyes
As I hear your voice, a loving surprise.
I love you when you are angry
I love you when you are sad
I love you when you are glad
When you tell me of the day you had

I love you truly
I love you deeply
Ever since the day
I met you
I missed you when you left
I miss you now more than ever
Making a mistake that I regret
Hoping that you are a forgiver

Without you, my life is strife
But now I ask for a second chance
Be with me and start a life
Together forever, an eternal dance
I wait for you as the days go by
My love is growing inch by inch
I cannot wait to see you again
But I wait for you, and your warm hug
I love you


I love thee
But thou doth not 
I, the darkness of night
Thou art the lumenier
I, the sadness
Thou art joy 
Thou never look back
I know it, I feel it
That is thine bitterly
Thou love me not
But I love thee, 
I love thee. 

I loved thee; and perchance until this moment
Within my breast is smouldering still the fire!
Yet I would spare thy pain the least renewal,
Nothing shall rouse again the old desire!

I loved thee with a silent desperation--
Now timid, now with jealousy brought low,
I loved devoutly,--with such deep devotion--



I loved you once: perhaps that love has yet
To die down thoroughly within my soul;
But let it not dismay you any longer;
I have no wish to cause you any sorrow.
I loved you wordlessly, without a hope,
By shyness tortured, or by jealousy.
I loved you with such tenderness and candor

I love thee—I love thee! 
'Tis all that I can say;— 
It is my vision in the night, 
My dreaming in the day; 
The very echo of my heart, 
The blessing when I pray: 
I love thee—I love thee! 
Is all that I can say. 
I love thee—I love thee! 
Is ever on my tongue; 
In all my proudest poesy 
That chorus still is sung; 
It is the verdict of my eyes, 
Amidst the gay and young: 
I love thee—I love thee! 
A thousand maids among. 
I love thee—I love thee! 
Thy bright hazel glance, 
The mellow lute upon those lips, 
Whose tender tones entrance; 
But most, dear heart of hearts, thy proofs 
That still these words enhance, 
I love thee—I love thee! 
Whatever be thy chance. 

When I came from my office, 
My father told me, 
Man reached moon, 
I rushed to the balcony, 
Started starring at the moon, 
Soon I realized my simplicity.

A few days latter, 
While going to office, 
I heard some men, 
It is a lie.

The illiterate and ignorant, 
Simple on the other hand, 
One of them a little literate, 
Looking wiser than others, 

Said not yet the man, 
Has reached Kohe Quaf, 
Where fairies live.
How can reach, 
The moon so far? 
Definitely a lie.

Sometimes latter, 
I read a news, 
In a leading newspaper, 
Neil Armstrong, 
Heard on the moon, 
A call for prayer.

How simple are the men, 
They do not know, 
Sound needs a medium, 
For propagation.

And on the surface, 
Of the moon, 
There's no atmosphere, 
No medium.

All our senses, are a touch, 
When a sound wave touches, 
The hearing sense, 
We feel a sound.

What is important, 
These simple men, 
Although simple, 
Although ignorant, 

Don't kill anyone, 
Women or children, 
May be illiterate, 
May be ignorant.

They are not one of, 
The hating terrorists, 
They are not one of, 
Killing activists, 
They are not one of, 
Religious extremists, 

How simple are the men, 
Deserving a song, 
I love them, 
Though they are wrong. 

Birds flying under sunlit blue skies
Crowded metro stations at night
A walk in the avenue
Chasing the butterflies

Sharing a kiss that tastes like vanilla
The smoke of your cigarette smells sweet
Fake fur coat over a mini skirt
We're Lolita replicas dressed up as Priscilla

The tears we cry in hotel rooms
Shine like diamonds in a fake card deck
The knife on my skin writes a bloody trademark
On my arm, your name and 'I love you'I can't remember ever telling my mother that I loved her.
Probably I did, when I was little, but I just can't remember.
She passed away when my youngest sister was only four.

It bothered me for years that I couldn't remember
if I had ever told her that I loved her.

Before my father passed away, I made sure
I told him that I loved him.

He lived for many years; she died young.

We never know how much time we have left.

Who's in your life that needs to hear those three words? 

Don't leave her life in disarray; 
Tell her that you love her today.
How long since she's heard? 
You must give her the word
TODAY, without delay

How many times I said I love you
I can’t remember, you forgot too
What we remember is the fragrance of love
How much we get never seems enough

Every time we get closer, embrace each other
Benevolence of love grows further ‘n’ further
Every touch of kiss writes a whole new story
Love poignantly glorifies, puts aside the worry

No matter how much time we’ve spent together
Never mind how many words said to each other
One moment of love is like an entire eternity
Love is the gospel; love is our sacred divinity

So worship the love, keep building love’s temple
As it can conquer everything and ample
Love me beyond the life and death’s hue
And once again, I’m saying I love you


I love you
Illusive intrusions like thunderous voices
Blowing my mind away

I am here to conceal the chronology
All facts and figures
Embezzling the dazzles
Digging deep into your soul
You’re the artifact
Of ancient’s sag
Beneath you history shines
Generating my consciousness
Chasing away insanity-
Sounds of silence passing by
Composing the song of ‘why’


I love you
Tell me why
Cry me a River Kwai
I’m your blue ocean
Albeit all confusions
Flesh aroma sizzling
Heart beat pending
Terracotta of your physique
Terrorizing my psyche
Help me to help me
Watching you like DVD
Pause and still
Inching you to frill
All your moves
For me to groove


I love you
Keeping your heart in invisible
Can not be seen but everywhere-
Waving my rational
Your sadness is my funeral
Your happiness is my survival
I could not survive-
Any day without you alive
Listen to our hearts
They’re playing the ‘why’ song
Get into the rhythm
Ensure and be firm
Do we need another love? 
Heart breaks
Soul cracks
So as to facilitate misery
Our love is a visionary
Open the windows
To hungry eyes


I love you
We are attached
Like a super glue
Bonded in true
Have you ever seen my mind naked? 
Yes-
When Moses parting the Red sea, 
And I walk through
Drown before reaching the other end
So to speak-
When you’re no longer mine
Repercussions are what-
You don’t want to know

I love you
As always I do
So many days
I pray
So many nights
I sigh
Wishing you eternally
To be by my side
Together we ride
The caravan of pride
Our love’s might


I love you is such a simple phrase 
that we use all the time 
to express our feelings towards one another. 
Pledging the feelings that we feel, 
hoping all the time they will be returned.

I love you, we shout it 
from the bottom our hearts. 
Eyes wide open as we advance 
through the gates of Eden 
and the pleasures that wait there.

We consume ourselves with fire 
that would outshine a thousand stars, 
when we say to someone special 
those three magic words; 
I love you. 

When April bends above me 
And finds me fast asleep 
Dust need not keep the secret 
A live heart died to keep.

When April tells the thrushes, 
The meadow-larks will know, 
And pipe the three words lightly 
To all the winds that blow.

Above his roof the swallows, 
In notes like far-blown rain, 
Will tell the little sparrow 
Beside his window-pane.

O sparrow, little sparrow, 
When I am fast asleep, 
Then tell my love the secret 
That I have died to keep.(for my wife, Daleen on February) 

I love you to the depth of the most distant reaches of my soul, 
in the innocent ways of a child, 
to the places where understanding does end, 
but also to the intimate need of a grown man.

I love you further than my life does go
and I love you in each day's 
simple and complicated experiences 

and on this birthday of yours
where we have been together for five years
I wish to love you to the very end of my days. 

As time flies by
when im with you
i fell your warmth
im safe with you

you hold me close
when you get scared
you kiss my lips
when you get bored

your love is all
that I need
i have words 
to say to you

I've said them
many time before
and always mean it
more and more

your love for me
might be low
but my love for you
is always there

as time passes
I hate to walk away
b'cuz i know
that you'll miss me so

just waiting to hear you
say those words back
I love you, I love you
my heart is for you! 

will you accept it? 
you'll be loved if you do
I truly accept it
and I love you too

your love is my life
your heart is my soul
your the love of my life
but am i yours? 

your hug is my savior
your kiss is my cure
for when I see you
I fall to the floor

but with the touch of your lips
i get right back up
and i hold you so tightly
you hold me so dear

your voice is so lovely
your hair is so soft
my love for you grows
through all the good times

we've been through it all
you still love me so
i now give you this
a kiss from my heart

I go for your cheek
you moved my head
I kissed your lips
and than you said

I love you, I love you
My heart is for you
do you accept it? 
you'll be loved if you do! 

I truly accept it
i really do
i know that you love me
cuz i love you to

the way that you smile
it makes my day
one step shorter
and a million times better

do you know what? 
I have something to say
these three words right now
I'll say to you today


I love you with all my heart

I won't talk about the clouds 
Or the shining, yellow rays 
I won't speak of the moon or the stars 
I tried not to think of you today 

Everytime I close my eyes 
I see your face and it's killing me 
That I can't be in your warm embrace 
Because you're there, and I'm still here 

Please look my way, but please don't look 
For I can't breathe everytime you do 
You take every beat of my heart 
And it's only beating for you 

Don't come to close 
Don't go too far 
Don't come so near 
Just stay by my heart 
Please take my hand 
Please don't let go 
Please say these words 
For I truly love you so


With a wish
That is true
I want to say
I love you
For your smile
Makes my day
And brings joy
In my way
I love you dear
Very much
And that's true
Dear as such
Because when I
Think of you
It makes me smile
With pleasure too
And that is why
For you I pray
His bliss way
And bestow on
You his love
That is a gift
Of heaven above.

Love You Sunny Dear


It seems that will never pass
The precious life we have
It seems that will never fade
The memories kept in mind

The king of my heart
You are hilarious, I bet! 
Damn precious man
As you was my lovely fun

I would be in a good shape
If I were there inside
In the home we have at all
With the peace that I am waiting for

Don’t go away you know what you mean to me
My salvation also my beloved body
Stay blessed for the one who loves you
For the one for me, your daughter too

Love poem for father of mine,Bitter pills
cure the ills they say
but I say
love 
heals the brokenness
salves the aches
takes away the need
entirely.
With love
there's little else to say
or do
except to hold you close; 
so you can 
hear me whisper 
I love you. 

I love you 
like dipping bread into salt and eating 
Like waking up at night with high fever 
and drinking water, with the tap in my mouth 
Like unwrapping the heavy box from the postman 
with no clue what it is 
fluttering, happy, doubtful 
I love you 
like flying over the sea in a plane for the first time 
Like something moves inside me 
when it gets dark softly in Istanbul 
I love you 

I love you.
How do you whether it is false or true.
I love you.
With you I do not want to argue.
Not like that means anything, 
I find it is a whole lot of time wasting.

I love you.
Some days I get vex, 
Some days I cry, I sigh, I laugh.
But everyday you make me smile.

I LOVE YOU. 

Reading my
Street light
Poem, he said: 
I'll come and
Hold you tight.
Look into you
Eye to eye and
Ask: 
Baby, you love me? 

I'll see if your eyes
Lie to me. 

I blushed a
Crimson red
And said: 
Won't let my eyes
Lie to you-
Instead, I'll
Close my eyes 
And say to you: 
Yes, I love you!

ID= love you for who you are, 
Not because you’re cool, hot, sexy or emo, 
You may think I don’t love you but you never asked if I loved you or not, 
Time won’t change what I said in the past, 
I want us to last, 
Not moving fast, 
I love you for you, 
I don’t care what people think of us, 
Let them talk about us, 
Let them be jealous of us, 
They’re just mad cause they ain’t us, 
Remember this I love you and that’s what counts. 

After a
Long
Lapse
I found
My laughter

It was
Hiding
At the
Back
Of your
Mouth

You laughed
I laughed too

We both
Laughed
Saying
I Love You


In my life you are a beautiful dream, 
but in my dream you are mine. 
You are the soul and the blood stream, 
that could make me an eternal life.

I've made the most important discovery of my life, 
It's only in the mysterious equation of love, 
that inspired the world arround me and changed my life, 
It was hard to find it, and harder to solve, 
It was like a dream to me as well as a great strife, 
and that is the great power and the magic of love, 

I love you although I've never met you, 
with you I can stand up for anything to do.
I love you although I've never met you, 
you changed my life and so my sky to blue.
I love you although I never met you, 
but in my dreams I really meet you.(An excerpt from my biography) 


I love you and don’t want to hurt you 
so I’m packing you up. She said. 
Her words hurt me as I walked away 
that I still remember them to this day

They are an understatement 
because you do not love someone 
and then push them away. 
However, that happened a long time ago 
and I’d like to thank her 
as strange as that may seem.

Her breaking my heart that night 
led me to what I do best today. 
She never knew it, but what she did 
I will be always grateful for. 
Its funny how in tragedy 
a better life can inspire 
and so it was the case in me.




when you settle the cat
companionably beside you
and stroke his soft fur
with your beautiful hands.

.  

when the Wizard of Id
tickles your fancy
and unleashes a roar
from the depths of your belly.

.  

when Sinatra sings
'only the lonely'
and your face crumples
like a paper napkin. 

I love you girl, 
you once again are making me young, 
while I find love in your heart
that touches my life, 
eternally I am bound to you
whatever we go through; 
nothing can devour our love, 

Like a Castle of Sand
Waves splashed
All is gone..


Like a Web
Rain strike
Spider run to hide..


Like a Rose
Splendid  blooms in May
But petals shriveled and fade away..


Like Words
Strummed in guitar cords
List'ning to sweet melody
But promises skip in the balcony.


Like withered leaf
Crumbled - crippled
Blown away. 
Wind goes steep..


Enough is enough..
You're a big flop! 
Trust no more
Lies no cure. 

'You can't..
 pull my sleeve 
 I am not your slave
 Don't stand at my door.
 I don't want to see you anymore'.  

When I look at my mom
I sing a thankful song
Because whatever she is today
Is because of Grandma's way

Her rare style and smile
Saying good things in trouble's pile
is all because of the hope
With which she clinged on to hope

With the trouble some situations of life
That surely do exist and survive
In which she appeared with zest
And passed all life's test

I have never tasted her love
But she seemed as if from above
For this world's sure uplift

To take her in his loving care
And plea for her, please reserve
Gift of love that she surely deserves. 

I love you! 
But I can not to say it, 
I am afraid that 
if I said it
I will be died! 
I am not afraid to die
I think if I died
No one love you such as I 

You love me
For once I feel content
I'll sit back and enjoy all that comes from being your heaven sent
You've made me feel so comfortable in my own skin
You make want to sing when I can't sing
And when angels sing best believe I'm leading the choir
You gratified my heart's desire
If it is 
. 

a mystery u are
Short lived
.   
I've been nice to you loved you unconditionally
Oh! I don't  wanna talk -good bye.. 

that's how you chose to treat me
What did I do.. 

is it me- can it be fixed
Yeah maybe if you quit
I'm confused-oh baby oh baby I love you
No I think you should leave do what you got to do
Okay- boy I'm tired.. my feelings are neutral
Stop with the games - it's futile
It's like one day you're in the next day you're  out-my heart is fragile
No- my heart is a mess
I, myself is asking how long must I live like this


I love you so, in this lifetime you will never know, 
when I see your face my whole being is aglow.
Love will come and love will go, but in my heart I will
always love you so. Wherever you are you must surely
know, I will always love you so.

Love is like a rose with a special glow, it's beauty
exceeds anything in this life that we know.
My love for you in like that rose, it has that special
glow, my life's work will always show, I will always
love you so.

Into the next life I shall go, taking with me this love
with a special glow, one thing you must know, in this
life or the next, I will always love you so. 

I love you.  Sounds just like three simple words 
I know you don't understand as I tell you these very often.
I know why you don't understand cos
How can these words include all my feelings that I have for you? 
How can these words explain my heart's rapid beat when you are beside me? 
How can these words describe my emotions that flow like rushing river when I hold your hand? 
How can these words explicate my pain when you are far? 
How can these words define importance of you in me? 
But, Till I find the best way to tell you how much I love you- 
Just know - 
You are only one whom I love beyond boundaries	
You are the only one who makes me feel complete
You are the only one who keeps me fulfilled
You are the only one with whom I want to share my past, present and future
So no matter - how many times I tell you I love you - I mean it 
I love you more and forever


A man risked his life to write the words.
A man hung upside down (an idiot friend
holding his legs?) with spray paint
to write the words on a girder fifty feet above
a highway.  And his beloved,
the next morning driving to work. ?
His words are not (meant to be) so unique.
Does she recognize his handwriting?
Did he hint to her at her doorstep the night before
of "something special, darling, tomorrow"?
And did he call her at work
expecting her to faint with delight
at his celebration of her, his passion, his risk?
She will know I love her now,
the world will know my love for her!
A man risked his life to write the world.
Love is like this at the bone, we hope, love
is like this, Sweatheart, all sore and dumb
and dangerous, ignited, blessed--always,
regardless, no exceptions,
always in blazing matters like these: blessed.




Why, oh why. Oh why, oh why, 
Does it have to be this way.
We were the best of friends, 
We could trust each other.
But I don’t understand, 
Why you’re telling me this, 
Telling me these things.
I never realised, 
That deep down inside, 
That you felt that way, 
Because of what happened before.
I never would have guessed, 
That you would have professed, 
What you are right now.
And that you would have said, 
Those three words I’d longed to hear.
‘I love you.’

I always had feelings for you, 
But brushed them aside, 
For I thought it would ruin what we had.
I never owned up to my feelings, 
That when I felt empty, 
You made me whole again.
I could never tell you these things, 
For fear of rejection, 
For fear of you saying, 
‘I still don’t want anyone, I still love her.’
But now I can, 
Now I can say, 
What I’ve always wanted to say.
‘I love you too.’



I love you with feelings that are true and right, 
I do love you through every day and night, 

even when times of joy are far from sight
as you make this earth a heavenly place.
I love you with feelings that are true and right, 

while I long to be to you the companion that I might
as the depth of our feelings are sometimes without a trace, 
I do love you through every day and night, 

and onward daily our lives do constantly race.
I love you with feelings that are true and right, 

with gentleness, without any fear and fright
although my childish ways might be commonplace
I do love you through every day and night.

Even if for you I have got struggle and fight
have got to face the most dangerous menace; 
I love you with feelings that are true and right, 
I do love you through every day and night.

[Reference: 'XLIII' 'How do I love thee? Let me count the ways']I do not love you for who you are
but for what you make me, 
for how you bring the days to meaning, 
touch me with love
and that you look past my mistakes
that I look wonderful in your eyes
and that you
and that you
love me and here I bring you honour.

I do not love you for who you are
and take you Daleen
to a eternal union
as the only one
and I promise to trust you, 
whatever the future holds
and I promise
and I promise
that my love will not abate.

I do not love you for who you are
and whatever comes
in every joy and hindrance
I do declare before Him
that I will stay with you always, 
that continually I will love you more
that I will, 
that I will

I loved a horse. I forget his name.
He studied me frankly from under his mane.
His nostrils flared like living holes, 
Two beautiful spheres and swelling above
The living hole of each of his eyes.
After he had run he would sweat so.
That is, he was shining and I pressed
Moons to his flanks beneath my child knees.
I loved a horse. I forget his name.
And often (for a beast knows better
What strength must bring us praise) 
Blowing, and furrowed with a network of veins. 

I love the way you look at me, 
I love the way you smile.
I love the way you lean on me, 
For just a little while.
I love it when you hold me tight, 
I love the way you smell.
I love the way your hand finds mine, 
Though you’d never tell.
I love the way I feel with you, 
I love it when you’re shy.
I love it when you fall asleep, 
And when I catch your eye.
I love it how you’re always there, 
And how we’re meant to be.
But mostly I just love you, 
Because of the way you love me. 

I loved you, and I probably still do,
And for a while the feeling may remain. 
But let my love no longer trouble you,
I do not wish to cause you any pain.
I loved you; and the hopelessness I knew,
The jealousy, the shyness - though in vain -
Made up a love so tender and so true


What do you mean you need space? 
I'm not moving an inch

How come you dont love me anymore? 
I am i not the same as before? 
Am i not the one you said u cared for? 

If its not the same, then how is it? 
If u got something to say, then commit! 
You know what i dont have time for your shit! 

I dont care anymore, in fact i hate you
You and me are forever through
I cant believe i ever said i loved you


Too many times, we leave things until later
Sometimes later never comes and the moments are lost
We never get the chance to say the most important things
That is to say, I loved you and goodbye
Our lives are like a second in each day
Here for a brief moment and forever gone away
Any tears of sorrow we leak from our eyes
Are there because of our missed chances 
Of saying, I loved you and goodbye


I loved you more than I should have had; 
No longer I could hold my ardent love inside; 
With such passion in need to share, and sad, 
Too late I realised — was all in vain because your pride; 
You wouldn't let me love you more than I already did, 
Yet in conceit, with my energy your ego fed.

But to me, my dear- you were the air I breathe, my life, 
The dream I dreamt when little girl — the purest love! 
My love for you, my inner child had brought to life, 
Electrifying senses: fire magnetised in love; 
Through you I've touched the magic of invisible, 
And found the secret gate to make palpable.

Through you I felt the girl, and I felt the woman
In timid glimmer first sensing her femininity; 
Euphorically beguiled by you — by you, My Man! 
And saint I felt as well, closer to divinity; 
But my human-warmth for a cold-blooded serpent, 
My heart in fear had frozen; and yet, — still fervent. 

I loved you once, nor can this heart be quiet;
For it would seem that love still lingers there;
But do not you be further troubled by it;
I would in no wise hurt you, oh, my dear.
I loved you without hope, a mute offender;
What jealous pangs, what shy despairs I knew!
A love as deep as this, as true, as tender,

I always have been something of a fool
I wasn't listening when I was at school
My mind would drift off into outer space
I had a vacant look upon my face

I never understood all Shakespeare's words
I thought thou art, and yonder were absurd
And please don't mention Trigonometry
That didn't mean an awful lot to me

As I grew older learning passed me by
I couldn't understand the reason why
It hasn't caused me harm, I'm sure of that
It's just that I have turned into a prat

I really am indebted to my dad
He spent all of his life going quite mad
He took me along with him, for the ride
And now I'm equal to him deep inside

So don't feel sorry for me, I'm okay
I've enjoyed every minute on the way
And now I am quite silly and a fool
For me, my whole life has been rather cool


I am a Syrian and i'm proud 
In this country people still have a heart.
Still their values are their guides
Although all the world have unreasonable hateful reaction against us
Without reason without whys

But after storms sun alway shins
Real


Ities no one can ever hide.
Through  darkness light will come

I am a syrian and I will survive
No one can ever shake my pride
Although all the world with pointing fingers are accusing us 
For those haters harmful acts
We are the victims of humanities  unfairly madden cruelest 
crims 
Their hands are filled 
with my brothers blood 

Bloodthirsty hands who used to change masks   
accused us with their acted crimes 
While their Poisoned swords still cuting our hearts
A thousands years worthy culture is destroyed
Churches 
Mosques
After a lifetime hard work people have lost all that they own
Returning back to begining poin but this time they are tired and old

Syrian matyrs
Suffering mothers woes
Homeless poor kids tears
Are asking you to leave
Leave Syria in peace as it always was
As I know even  animals have more pity and mercy! 
But you don't have a bit.
You kill innocent people for your nasty greed

I’ve stopped drinking.
                          I love my wife.
My own wife- I insist on this.
Living so like an angel, 
I almost quote Shchipachev.
This is a shriveled life.
I’ve shut my eyes to all other women.
My shoulders feel peculiar.
Aha! Wings must be sprouting! 
This makes me anxious. Moody.
And the wings keep sprouting-what a nuisance! 
                                                How awkward! 
Now I’ll have to slit
my jacket in appropriate places.
A true angel, 
                I bear life no grudge
for all its cruel hurts.
I’m a true angel. But I still smoke.
I’m the smoking type.
To be an angel  is strange work.
Pure spirit. Not an ounce of flesh.
And the women pass by.
A true angel, what good to them am I! 
I don’t count for the present, 
not while I hold celestial rank, 
but-bear in mind-in this life, 
a fallen angel is the worst devil of all! 




The poor become poorer each day
The rich turn richer every way
Corruption is the cause that may
Prevent a nation’s progress, Aye! 

Corruption rules the world in ways
Indiscernible yet, always; 
The common man’s heart, mind and face
Reveals the menace in each case

Corruption wears so many masks; 
The corrupt in lucre’s sun basks; 
All accept it and no one asks, 
‘Why burden-some turn daily tasks? ’

Corruption has gone too rampant; 
It runs amok like an elephant; 
The poor man’s life is like an ant; 
Mass rallies slogans only chant.

The war to curb corruption’s on; 
Good youth in India have been born; 
The people get gleanings of corn, 
While sheaves in rich men’s homes adorn.

Corruption’s the cause of price-rise; 
Share-markets play a game like dice; 
Taxes have grown mammoth in size; 
A tax-payer ashamed then dies.

Which leader will then stem this rot? 
– Democracy is badly caught; 
The fight must be much bravely fought
Till freedom after Freedom’s got! 
Shri. Anna Hazare

My mind and my pen is dating somewhere..
I can't think of idea what-
topic to write..
I just go with the flow and ride..
Hope this time its for good. 
wish I could..
wish I might..

Days and months passes by so fast.
every minute every hour is very important
I don't want to miss a single seconds.
for I believe opportunity knock at once.
 Strike while the iron is hot. 

I come back soon 
wait for me until dawn.. 

I'm bleeding words—sweet-diabolical pain; 
Monsters of emotions invading my chest: —
Have my heart, in love-beat is useless again! 
Though it keeps the survival, it's striving, restive; —
Travel with my in agony and despair, forgetting joy: 
Endless journey, confusing labyrinth of thoughts, 
Illusion and disillusion, pleasure and murder conjoined; 
Catching myself from fall, breathing the shots: —
Torture my bleeding wounds: get me in pulse-react! 
Tease me in blood—feel the metallic taste in it! 
Feed me with pain till I feel life's impact
Rekindling from ash—my soul, life to emit: —
Take my heart as a trophy; braving your Ego! —
Fail to succeed: —bitter your blood

With friends like us for others to see  
The beauty it has given me  
The more I know I'm blessed  With understanding and kindness  
You surround me with politeness  
The more I know I'm blessed  With a sharing, caring attitude  
The more I feel and care for you  
The more I know I'm blessed


I love you foremost
Tower of inspiration
And kindness utmost

Providing motivation
Giving me support
Helping ease frustration
With friendly comfort

I'm frozen by your beauty
Melted with your touch
In your arms I long to be
I love you so much

Even after many a year
The love of my life
You're the one I hold most dear
Blest you are my wife


 









And I hate intolerance and violence.
I'm Charlie Hebdo too, dear brothers; 
And I practice love and tolerance.

I am against all types of crimes.
Of violence, the weak and the poor of the Earth; 
The innocent, the artists and the enemies of war.

I'm Charlie. I protest against injustice, 
and I practice love and tolerance.
I'm Charlie. I draw caricatures, funny faces, 
and I hate intolerance and violence.

I'm for universal democracy, 
for freedom and the right to express our happiness and fears; 
I am for liberty, fraternity and equality.
I am against barbarism which is criminal.

I like shouting: long live freedom, long live the difference.
I abhor corruption and hypocrisy, 
and I practice humor and tolerance.
I'm Charlie Hebdo; I'm Charlie.


You are going to ask: and where are the lilacs?
and the poppy-petalled metaphysics?
and the rain repeatedly spattering
its words and drilling them full
of apertures and birds?
I'll tell you all the news.

I lived in a suburb,
a suburb of Madrid, with bells,
and clocks, and trees.

From there you could look out
over Castille's dry face:
a leather ocean.
My house was called
the house of flowers, because in every cranny
geraniums burst: it was
a good-looking house
with its dogs and children.
Remember, Raul?
Eh, Rafel? Federico, do you remember
from under the ground
my balconies on which
the light of June drowned flowers in your mouth?
Brother, my brother!
Everything
loud with big voices, the salt of merchandises,
pile-ups of palpitating bread,
the stalls of my suburb of Arguelles with its statue
like a drained inkwell in a swirl of hake:
oil flowed into spoons,
a deep baying
of feet and hands swelled in the streets,
metres, litres, the sharp
measure of life,
stacked-up fish,
the texture of roofs with a cold sun in which
the weather vane falters,
the fine, frenzied ivory of potatoes,
wave on wave of tomatoes rolling down the sea.

And one morning all that was burning,
one morning the bonfires
leapt out of the earth
devouring human beings --
and from then on fire,
gunpowder from then on,
and from then on blood.
Bandits with planes and Moors,
bandits with finger-rings and duchesses,
bandits with black friars spattering blessings
came through the sky to kill children
and the blood of children ran through the streets
without fuss, like children's blood.

Jackals that the jackals would despise,
stones that the dry thistle would bite on and spit out,
vipers that the vipers would abominate!

Face to face with you I have seen the blood
of Spain tower like a tide
to drown you in one wave
of pride and knives!

Treacherous
generals:
see my dead house,
look at broken Spain :
from every house burning metal flows
instead of flowers,
from every socket of Spain
Spain emerges
and from every dead child a rifle with eyes,
and from every crime bullets are born
which will one day find
the bull's eye of your hearts.

And you'll ask: why doesn't his poetry
speak of dreams and leaves
and the great volcanoes of his native land?

Come and see the blood in the streets.
Come and see
The blood in the streets.
Come and see the blood
In the streets

After a year of trials and doubts
The circle has closed on the greatest of days
I'm still wondering what all of this is about
And if I'll ever again see your face

The stars have aligned and the moon is attending
A ceremony that Heaven is sending
We stand up and celebrate as we say our vows
Pledging to make this victory ours

History is made and after all it makes sense
This special day has gifted me with another chance
Freedom has come, the nightmare is over
We will be resurrecting from this supernova

Whatever comes can't be as bad as before
I stand with you as long as I breathe
Can you rejoice in what someone else cries for? 
I don't care because I am loyal and free

I dropped the wedding ring in the gutter, 
slipped out of my mink, 
gave the guy selling papers the wink, 
lifted up my skirt and hailed a lift, 
whereupon I called the airport
for the first flight out of New York
going anywhere, somewhere 
away from everything I've ever known.
Finally able to say, I'm free. 

Im glad today's not sunny, 
Im glad today's not bright.
Why do I feel like Im loosing everone? 
Out of reach and out of sight.

This is no time to worry, 
cause theres no room for reason.
I guess I'll just have to wait, 
until I begin believeing.

Im happy no one can see me now, 
Im happy I'm alone today.
So I can cry myself to sleep, 
because that's the only way.

Im tired of living my life cold, 
Im tired I need to rest.
To lie down in his arms tonight, 
that would be the best.

I need to move, to fly away, 
untill I find your waiting face.
I will not stop, or stumble
I'll wait for your sweet tast. 

Every since the day I went away and left you 
So lonely and cold 
What could I do? 
I thought about myself
I never meant to hurt you
I had to go away to see if love was through

One day you send me a letter
Telling me that you loved me
And you still care
I broke down and cried
What did I do? 
I left a love so true

I’m going crazy
Out my mind, yeah
Don’t think that I’m lazy
To come back to you, girl
I want you to be my lady
I’m so sorry
For leaving me you my baby
Please forgive me
I’ve been so naïve 
I’m going crazy

Every word I say is hard to express myself
I have to start somewhere, baby
Can help me? 
Save me from myself
I just want to let you know that I love you too
Or else my heart gets broken
What a fool I’ve been
What else can I do? 

One day you send me a letter
Telling me that you loved me
And you still care
I broke down and cried
What did I do? 
I left a love so true

I’m going crazy
Out my mind, yeah
Don’t think that I’m lazy
To come back to you, girl
I want you to be my lady
I’m so sorry
For leaving me you my baby
Please forgive me
I’ve been so naïve 
I’m going crazy

I have to let you I need you so very much
I have to let you I need to feel your touch
I have to let you the things I done was so wrong
I just don't know
But I realize I need your love

Every since you wrote to me
I cannot speak
My eyes are gonna leak
I my heart’s getting so weak
Everything I do 
I think of you
What am I gonna do
Tell me if this love is true

One day you send me a letter
Telling me that you loved me
And you still care
I broke down and cried
What did I do? 
I left a love so true

I’m going crazy						 
Out my mind, yeah
Don’t think that I’m lazy
To come back to you, girl
I want you to be my lady
I’m so sorry
For leaving me you my baby
Please forgive me
I’ve been so naïve 
I’m going crazy


I'm going out,
flies, so relax,
make love.




Sometime u just have to hold ur head up high
blink away the tears and say good-bye
forget all the pain, stand up and try 
cuz nothing in this life tends u to cry 
A million tears will not bring him back 
u'll need me again, u'll come runin' back
say what u want, say I am a liar, say I am a hack 
I will never cry again, I will never come back 
I cried today, not cuz I miss u, or even wanted u, 
but cuz I realized I'm gonna be all right without u.. 

To High  heavens, 
To sun  and  earth, 
For every morning, 
And every night, 
 For every  smile, 
 For every  tear, 
For sweet sounds and 
  Every songs, 
For the blue-vine 
And for tenderness
For every second 
And elation
For every roses -
 scents generous
I am grateful

You left me! 
You left me! 
But you said you'd never leave
Of course it was that lie I chose to believe

You stole my heart
And ripped it in two.
Even though it's broken
It still belongs to you.

We don't speak anymore
But even if it's the last thing I ever hear you say, 
It would be really great
If you could tell me what I did to deserve this fate.

Even after all this pain you've put me through
I must admit, I'm still in love with you.
And maybe if I'm lucky, the luckiest girl in the world, 
Maybe once again, I can be your girl. 

she's young, she said,
but look at me,
I have pretty ankles,
and look at my wrists, I have pretty
wrists
o my god,
I thought it was all working,
and now it's her again,
every time she phones you go crazy,
you told me it was over
you told me it was finished,
listen, I've lived long enough to become a 
good woman,
why do you need a bad woman?
you need to be tortured, don't you?
you think life is rotten if somebody treats you
rotten it all fits,
doesn't it?
tell me, is that it? do you want to be treated like a 
piece of shit?
and my son, my son was going to meet you.
I told my son
and I dropped all my lovers.
I stood up in a cafe and screamed
I'M IN LOVE,
and now you've made a fool of me. . .
I'm sorry, I said, I'm really sorry.
hold me, she said, will you please hold me?
I've never been in one of these things before, I said,
these triangles. . .
she got up and lit a cigarette, she was trembling all 
over. 

she paced up and down,wild and crazy. 

she had
a small body. 

her arms were thin,very thin and when
she screamed and started beating me I held her
wrists and then I got it through the eyes:hatred,
centuries deep and true. 

I was wrong and graceless and
sick. 

all the things I had learned had been wasted.
there was no creature living as foul as I 
false. 

Your Stanzas are like your eyes that melts my heart
Your Lines are like your smile that softens my inner being
Your Themes are like your unique gestures that make me fall with you
You Titles are like your special message that deepens to know you more
 
VERSE me with your care
ODE me with your embrace
RHYME me with your share
PROSE me with your tender
 
I’m in love with you because you FLOW
     like spring in the falls
I’m in love with you because your SYLLABLES
     are like a zephyr in the skies
I’m in love with you because your RHYTHM
     are like the heartbeat of blissful happiness
I’m in love with you because your METER
     is like the immeasurable galaxies of passion
 
I’m in love with you, POETRYI wake up in the night
From perceptions in my sight
Inventions and poems to be

From universal law
To a washing machine’s flaw
De-straw-ing life in agony

Then future CPU
d engines won’t subdue
All my views can feel like debris

For I’m just a retard
It feels as if I work hard
At nothingness consistently


These words i speak taste oh so bitter
Sweet love of mine I'm sorry
I can not give what you patiently seek.
My heart has bled, my heart is weak.
You know I'll fall in the end.
You'll hurt for a moment, My hurt won't end.
Sweet lover of mine, I'm sorry.
Don't be afraid to leave me behind.
You'll heal and one day and soon you'll find.
Another sweet lover who is much more kind.
Please let go love, without me you'll live.
You'll be better off, if you forget me, that is.
I'll be fine if you give me your forgivness.
We can still be friends,  for I can offer endless friendship.
I'm tired of hurting you.
I don't want to play.
Lets end this miserable thing we call 
you 
and 
meyou tell me you understand
you tell me I can talk to you
you tell me to trust you
and that you've been put through this too

but you don't understand         
you don't know
I can't talk to you
because you'd tell some one

and even know you say it's for the best
I know your trying to make me like the rest
with pills and therapy
with talking and `help`

I know your hidden plan
you want to change me
you want me normal
you want me to be something I'm not

yes

I know your plan but you don't know mine
and that is just part of the game
the game you think your winning

the pills don't help
I pretend to take them
I don't listen to your help
and I hide in the dark instead of the light

just because I look happy 
you assume all is well
when deep in my mind
I'm living in hell


I think you are almost done 
this almonry that’s me 
and charity that’s you
tremors of hunger to receive 
last ravages of your bristles
I’m glad to be me no more
I’m ecstatic -about prospects 
of not having to call you
write poems about your absence 
drip saline, volumes of papers
for love that was 
I’m glad I’m you[to Carolyn Keene, for the entire series]

I'm missing a clue said Nancy Drew
maybe it's in the old clock, hidden under
the stairs under an oak tree when

the moon irradiates the clouds
but how clouded can life be
in a pale blue convertible

and your dad, a lawyer
when Hannah bakes chocolate cakes
every other minute and you can

still wear those pencil skirts with
the matching sweaters
and read other people's diaries? 

and there'll be a note in the bouquet
in of course, cryptic  handwriting
or a slight delay when the

operator puts you through; 
an objet d'arte  in the old junk shop
and luna moths in the attics of odd years

won't ravage the old silks. shhh. 
a click in the wall! my copy's late
again, from working on her story

a voice comes to you in a dream
when the spring to the hidden bookcase
swings out with the entire series and

you will finger your omnipresent string
of pearls and wonder who wrote
all this, really? 



I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us -- don't tell!
They'd banish -- you know!

How dreary to be somebody!
How public like a frog
To tell one's name the livelong day
To an admiring bog

Don't you see, 
i'm not .
Don't you see, 
i'm not like the rest.
Don't you see, 
i'm the outcast.
Don't you see, 
why can't you leave? 
Don't you see, 
I'm not the girl you believed.
Don't you see, 
i'm not number 
Don't you see, 
I lied about them.
Don't you see, 
I'm a fake.
Don't you see, 
I'm not like those other girls.
Don't you see, 
I don't get all A's.
Don't you see, 
I have imperfections.
Don't you see, 
I have those bad days.
Don't you see, 
I'm not .
Just go. 
Don't come back. 
You see
I'm lacking, 
I'm not a wren I'm a nightgingale she wept
into the rains where this was invisible
and if it's all the same to you

what then is music
that you hear the false note true
and claim the brass

rings o it rings like cristal
we shall be satisfied with sand dollars
in lieu of cake

and for the sake of your fortune finally rolling in
be tagged as if we were driftwood 
on the lacelike tides

and not pearls
so that you might enjoy your breakfast
your definitive worlds

the tray sent up with the eggs benedict
the orchid
and the morning papers

but bored by the odes to love
stressed more by the test of love
and harried by the thoughts of love
for though love makes the world revolve
and brings us all together
there's none so boring or so dull
as other folks love letters. 

I'm not lonely 
sleeping all alone 
you think i'm scared 
but i'm a big girl 
i don't cry or anything

I have a great 
big bed to roll around 
in and lots of space 
and i don't dream 
bad dreams like i used 
to have that you 
were leaving me 
anymore

Now that you're gone 
i don't dream 
and no matter 
what you think 
i'm not lonely 
sleeping 
all alone


Timur, I hear, took the trouble to conquer the earth.
I don't understand him.
With a bit of hard liquor you can forget the earth.

I'm not saying anything against Alexander,
Only I have seen people who were remarkable,
Highly deserving of your admiration
For the fact that they were alive at all.

Great men generate too much sweat.
In all of this I see just a proof that
They couldn't stand being on their own
And smoking and drinking and the like.
And they must be too mean-spirited to get
Contentment from sitting by a woman. 

I’m just going to sit here.
I won’t say a word.
I’ll be like the children
who are seen and not heard.

If I talk I’ll say something
I know I’ll regret, 
‘cause I’m so mad at Sissy, 
I may never forget.

She broke all my crayons, 
then she threw them away, 
and she blamed me for spilling
her milk yesterday.

I keep thinking about
what I learned when just small: 
either say something nice, 
or say nothing at all.

If I say what I want to say, 
I might be heard, 
so I’m just going to sit here
and not say a word. 

I'm not the folk tune said the princess
her head in her jeweled hands.
not even the broidered kerchief

with its thread of bluer skies than this.
I'm not the corn silk raveling
the flame petticoat cherished

by the dancer
washed out every night; the jacket
of gypsy green brocade

the flashpoint on the stage; 
the open locket
flung away.

because I am not meant to be these.
but I am the mist where you think it is the sea; 
the one white rose in the greenery

in a forest far from here.
the one at the ball with the least modern slippers, 

in the tearose gown of the screened in afternoons
and spinning amethyst riddles
not to be answered; not to be sing song sung; 

not to wear the hat of simple cherries
but the veil of moonrise.
the cost of moonrise.

and to prefer the abandoned hour
the mist when you think it is the sea
the sea arising when you think

it's only mist.
and this is only this and never again she said
from the tower of the last day 

Death be quick, 
Death blow out 
My mortal wick.

Death and the Woman 
(After Schubert)     

Death was not nimble, 
Death was not quick, 
But death blew out 
Her mortal wick
With cancer. 

I look at her smile
and realize that I could have tried harder, 
could have made things right when I had the chance.
Now, all I see is her in his arms, 
sweet memories
as I fight back tears, 
but I’m supposed to be a man
and men aren't supposed to cry.
But I don't give a damn ‘cause' I’m sad
and I’m mad.
I let her slip away: 
the girl of my dreams, 
the one that completes me
is now part of his destiny
and now I’m obsolete
out dated, 
replaced, 
a part of the past, 
sad, 
mad, 
dangerously.
She moved on without me. 

I'm off'n wild wimmen
An Cognac
An Sinnin'
For I'm in lo


OOOOOOOve. 

If I should die before my time 
And possibly lose my frame of mind 
I'm Ok with that! 

If I should not be able to speak, 
Where  you can't understand a word I peep, 
I'm Ok with that! 

Now if I should have an occasional mis-deed 
Where it caused you some pain or need 
Are YOU ok with that? 

You see, all of which was said before 
Is just of less, where there should be more 
And I'm Ok with that! 

He fills my cup with ALL His love
And, 
I'M OK WITH THAT

I'm only human, and in soul I wonder
About Nature and its display of feast, 
With seasons unfolding, their mystery under: 
How lovely before my eyes they manifest! 
Yet, we barely understand with naked eyes its splendour, 
But when with Soul it's contemplate it, 
Its warmth irradiates my heart.  

it's tender: 
No need to comprehend with Mind, no need its wit! 
If only, through Time and Space myself could travel, 
In millions of particles my spirit to expand, 
And whole the Universe to capture, in it to ravel. 
My mortal-fated nature, —closer to the Heaven Grande! 
But, I'm only human with frail capacity; 
With only dreams, obsessing of Eternity. 

When first I doffed my olive drab, 
I thought, delightfully though mutely, 
"Henceforth I shall have pleasure ab- 
Solutely


Dull with the drudgery of war, 
Sick of the name of fighting, 
I yearned, I thought, for something more 
Exciting.

The rainbow be my guide, quoth I; 
My suit shall be a brave and proud one 
Gay-hued my socks; and oh, my tie 
A loud one.

For me the theater and the dance; 
Primrose the path I would be wending; 
For me the roses of romance 
Unending.

Those were my inner thoughts that day 
(And those of many another million) 
When once again I should be a 
Civilian.

I would not miss the o. 

d.; 
(Monotony I didn't much like) 
I would not miss the reveille, 
And such the like.

I don't . . . And do I now enjoy 
My walks along the primrose way so? 
Is civil life the life? Oh, boy, 
I'll say so. 

Swaying in the wind
there was a small leaf of golden brown.
It landed in a pond
and rippled the water.

And the waves the leaf created
expanded further and further, 
and soon they started
crawling onto land.

The ground began to ripple, 
the Earth began to shake.
The creatures underground 
began to wake.

They left from their hiding
to hide once again
and to stay hidden
from the building quake.

But the ripple grew intense
throughout the world.
It split the ground apart
and swallowed people up.

of the golden leaf
from his Heavens.
He dried up the pond.

The waves ceased 
and the leaf shriveled in its barrenness.
It reached for water
but there was none to be found.

It died in the heat
of the laughing sun, 
but its impact
was not forgotten. 

Immediate: Not allowing doubt to arise between perception and fact, 
Manifestation: Full blooming of the planted seed(s)   to remain intact, 
Perceiving: Walking by faith not by sight no matter how bad it looks, 
Achieving: Desired outcome by scriptural promises in the holy book, 
Truth: When all is said and done you’re looking back with no regrets.

Anything done without an impact in the long run is a waste of time, 
Short-term success lasts as long as those involved are in their prime, 
The bible is an entity with the same impact Old Testament or New, 
Awareness increases even more as we read this through and through, 
Romans  s self explanatory, when shall greater impact begin? 

Because many choose not to listen to this word but the word of man, 
Comprised with an affinity of jealousy since human existence began, 
That flood only heightened mans resistance not to observe and obey, 
Now the world lies amidst the corruptive chaos we experience today.   

We’ve fallen short one time or another, have you tried to comeback? 
Whereas you continue to fall then whatever obviously had no impact, 
Champions aren’t born they’re trained, conditioned to withstand heat, 
And when the thermometer rises they run forward not away in retreat, 
Longing for battle seeking to advance in any arena dying to compete, 
As time marches on we must follow in unison never to sink in defeat.

Slowly but surely bible prophesy lives the world is coming to an end, 
Yet just like creation although there’s speculation we know not when, 
You cannot control time all the more reason there is no time to waste, 
An early bird catches the worm but the tortoise will not win this race, 
The evil one knows time is running out he has stepped up his attacks, 
Soldiers prepare for battle, protect the citizens, make an I.

When you say perfection, what do you mean
When you say the word perfect, what are you trying to underline
What are you trying to emphasize, are you trying to customize
Or are you trying to make me compromise
I don’t think you realize

Perfect to me, is only  for me to decide
Perfect is the imperfections that make us who we are
Perfect is the rejection that pushes us that bit too far
Perfect brings us closer to ourselves and the perfect we’re supposed to be
So don’t tell me what perfect is for me

I am perfect the way it looks to me
I’m perfect in my dictionary
If you don’t like it, there’s one thing you should know
Here is my number and call me, if you find perfection down the road


I try to be a noblewoman.
I reach out to those in need.
I believe in planting a seed.
I give to displaced children.
I open my home to abused and neglected children.
These children have seen too much sorrow.
Repeating the sins of yesterday, we can make a difference if we step up today.
We can possibly prevent a child from turning out wild.
Returning back to their past of drugs, alcohol, abuse and neglect.
We can show them unconditional love without reject.
We can show hurting children a positive reflection.
Of unconditional love

Out of the night that covers me,
    Black as the Pit from pole to pole, 
  I thank whatever gods may be
    For my unconquerable soul. 
  In the fell clutch of circumstance
    I have not winced nor cried aloud. 
  Under the bludgeonings of chance
    My head is bloody, but unbowed. 
  Beyond this place of wrath and tears
  Looms but the Horror of the shade, 
And yet the menace of the years
  Finds, and shall find, me unafraid. 
It matters not how strait the gate, 
  How charged with punishments the scroll, 
I am the master of my fate: 
  I am the captain of my soul. 

I'm ready to go.
Take me to heaven.
I'm ready to go.
End my suffering.
I'm ready to go.
Let me stop all this blubbering.

I can't help anyone.
Wish I could.
The grave of the good.
As much as I need to know whats not understood.
Conclusions so sour sometime I wish you would.

I'm ready to go.
Take me to heaven.
I'm ready to go.
End my suffering.
I'm ready to go.
Let me stop all this blubbering.

I've look into the abyss so many times before.
This time their is no going back.
Me and the angel of the death have a contract.
With blood as the ink it has been signed and sealed.
I'm sorry but I no longer want to feel.

I'm ready to go.
Take me to heaven.
I'm ready to go.
End my suffering.
I'm ready to go.
Let me stop all this blubbering.

My emotions ride me like a hound.
Biting at my heels.
A heart that isn't real.
Watch as another layer of skin I peel.
I stand then kneel.

I'm ready to go.
Take me to heaven.
I'm ready to go.
End my suffering.
I'm ready to go.
Let me stop all this blubbering.

Wishing for something I can never have.
Denied the right as stars shoot across the twilight.
Beating myself up on the inside.
I'm so ready to so ready to die.
I'm so ready to sail the skies.

I'm ready to go.
Take me to heaven.
I'm ready to go.
End my suffering.
I'm ready to go.
Let me stop all this blubbering.

But something won't let me.
A conscience.
A destiny.
Thoughts of the angry.
They pour into me.
It should be my choice.
A echoing of my voice.

I'm ready to go.
Take me to heaven.
I'm ready to go.
End my suffering.
I'm ready to go.
Let me stop all this blubbering.

I'm ready to go.
Take me to heaven.
I'm ready to go.
End my suffering.
I'm ready to go.
Let me stop all this blubbering. 

What you get is what you see. just except me for who i am. I know i'm a mystery waiting to be sloved. dont try to understand just know i'm there for you, i'm real, honey i know i can be mean,  i know i can be nice and sweet but hey


It's too big and brutal for me.
My nerve's on the raw and I don't give a damn
For all the "hoorah" that I see.
I'm pinned between subway and overhead train,
Where automobillies swoop down:
Oh, I want to go back to the timber again --
I'm scared of the terrible town.

I want to go back to my lean, ashen plains;
My rivers that flash into foam;
My ultimate valleys where solitude reigns;
My trail from Fort Churchill to Nome.
My forests packed full of mysterious gloom,
My ice-fields agrind and aglare:
The city is deadfalled with danger and doom --
I know that I'm safer up there.

I watch the wan faces that flash in the street;
All kinds and all classes I see.
Yet never a one in the million I meet,
Has the smile of a comrade for me.
Just jaded and panting like dogs in a pack;
Just tensed and intent on the goal:
Up there in the land of the Pole.

I wish I was back on the Hunger Plateaus,
And seeking the lost caribou;
I wish I was up where the Coppermine flows
To the kick of my little canoe.
I'd like to be far on some weariful shore,
In the Land of the Blizzard and Bear;
Oh, I wish I was snug in the Arctic once more,
For I know I am safer up there!

I prowl in the canyons of dismal unrest;
I cringe -- I'm so weak and so small.
I can't get my bearings, I'm crushed and oppressed
With the haste and the waste of it all.
The slaves and the madman, the lust and the sweat,
The fear in the faces I see;
The getting, the spending, the fever, the fret --
It's too bleeding cruel for me.

I feel it's all wrong, but I can't tell you why --
The palace, the hovel next door;
The insolent towers that sprawl to the sky,
The crush and the rush and the roar.
I'm trapped like a fox and I fear for my pelt;
I cower in the crash and the glare;
Oh, I want to be back in the avalanche belt,
For I know that it's safer up there!

I'm scared of it all: Oh, afar I can hear
The voice of my solitudes call!
We're nothing but brute with a little veneer,
And nature is best after all.
There's tumult and terror abroad in the street;
There's menace and doom in the air;
I've got to get back to my thousand-mile beat;
The trail where the cougar and silver-tip meet;
The snows and the camp-fire, with wolves at my feet;
Good-bye, for it's safer up there.

To be forming good habits up there;
To be starving on rabbits up there;
In your hunger and woe,
Though it's sixty below,
Oh, I know that it's safer up there

Now I'm warnin' all you women don't stand too close to me cause you might catch fire
Now you're talkin' to a man in a whole other kind of bag
Well I'm three parts tiger and one part snake
I'll ball you to sleep and I'll bite you awake
And I'm so good that I don't have to brag
I need an adding machine to count up all the women I've ruined for other men
Now compared to me Paul Bunyan is a screamin' fag
I can shift more gears and pump more juice I'll turn you every which way but loose
And I'm so damn good that I don't have to brag
Now there's twenty thirty beautiful women a sleepin' at the foot of my bed
And every night every night I hear 'em sighin'
They say that I don't miss a thing they say that I'm the lovin' king
And I'm too nice a guy to say they're lyin'
Now I've been makin' love professionally since I was only six years old
And I really learned the way to wiggly wag
And still I'm such a modest man you know I'm twice as great as I think I am
I'm so good that I don't have to brag
There's a line of chicks startin' at my window and reachin' across the street
And it stretches 'way to the other side of town
They come to me from across the seas on their knees just sayin' Please
And I'm too nice a guy to turn 'em down
Now I once got captured by some Amazon women down in the Fiji Isles
They were fightin' over me to see who'd be my bride
I had to kill them all and I will admit it and I won't tell you how I did it
But I'll tell you each one was smilin' when she died
Now the day I die every woman in the country's gonna go around dressed in black
And they'll probably add another star to the American flag
And they'll build me a monument forty feet high sayin' it's a shame he had to die
He was so damn good he never had to brag
And I'm tellin' you men keep your eighteen year old daughters off of my back
And your wives they like the way I carry on
And why don't you go look at your mother for a while
You notice she's wearin' a funny sorta smile
Well that just means I've been there and I've gone
Now if you got a frigid woman I'm gonna cure her for a hundred dollars
You can bring her around my house at four o'clock
And you can come and pick her up at if you can pry her off of me
I got a whole lot of others just waitin' 'round the block
Now if you're wonderin' how you're gonna get to me
Better bring a Cadillac full of money
Cause I sure as hell ain't gonna swing without no swag
I can make you creep I can make you crawl make you scream and climb the wall
And I'm so good that I don't have to brag
So Baby don't call me up at three o'clock in the mornin' no more threatenin' suicide
I mean go ahead and do it honey cause wakin' me up is a drag
And you can leave a note for all the rest sayin' at least you had the very best
And he's so damn good that he don't have to brag
Now I'm warnin' all you women don't stand too close to me cause you might catch fire
Now you're talkin' to a man in a whole other kind of bag
I'm three parts tiger and one part snake I'll ball you to sleep and I'll bite you awake
And I'm so good that I don't have to brag


I’m so tired of war, 
no matter what it’s for-
i’m so tired of police, 
who are no longer officers of peace-

 I’m so tired of manufactured food, 
no nutrition does it give, 
I’m so tired of television ads
that trick all who watch them how to live.

I’m so tired of drugs, 
no cures do them possess..
I’m so tired of the closed minded folks
that won’t accept the way I dress.

I’m so tired of laws, 
that distance god from man, 
I’m so tired of exploitation 
of poor people who can’t understand.

I’m so tired of money, -
so tired of greed, -
it steals from everyone in need-
and is the measure of the word succeed




Because I've made you resent me
'I'm sorry..' 
Only word I can say
If it's not enough
Or even hurt you more
Please tell me what to do
Tell me how to make you smile at me again


I am sorry if I ever pulled your hair, 
If I ever screamed at you, 
If I ever treated you unfair, 
If I ever put you in hard situations to go through, 
I am sorry.

I am sorry if I ever made you mad, 
If I ever caused you hurt, 
If I ever made you sad, 
I hope you know that I really never meant a word, 
I am sorry.

I am sorry if I ever caused you pain, 
If I ever told you I didn’t care, 
If I ever said it was you to blame, 
If I looked at you with an ugly stare, 
I am sorry.

I am sorry if I ever called you insane, 
If I ever blocked you out, 
If I ever said that  you were untamed, 
If I ever said it was you to doubt, 
I am sorry.

I am sorry if it were you I didn’t trust, 
If it were ever about you I gossiped, 
If I ever turned to you with my heart as cold as frost, 
And it was our friendship I tossed, 
I am sorry.

I know these are easy words to write, 
But they are not as easy to say, 
I know that this could have led to a fight, 
But I thank you because you avoid it to try to make it okay. 
I am sorry. 

I’m sorry for my lies
I’m sorry for your cries
I’m sorry things went wrong
Don’t worry, soon I’ll be gone

I’m sorry that I hurt you
I’m sorry that it’s true
I’m sorry if you hate me
But this is the way it will be

I’m sorry for hiding things
I’m sorry I lost my wings
I’m sorry I’m no longer an angel
But now I’m just too fragile

I’m sorry I caused you pain
I’m sorry I left you in the rain
I’m sorry for everything I’ve done wrong
But don’t worry no more-soon I’ll be gone


The dark grey road is glistening
in the late midnight rain.
I am feeling weak, 
But I am still standing, 
waiting for the last bus to Hell.

Look, Dad, I told you I 'd been listening; 
I followed your trail through the terrain.
You deceived me, 
Denied me every blessing -
see me now, 
Boarding the last bus to Hell.

Defiance was my only tool, 
in spite of what you told me to, 
I defied every single rule.
I am on the last bus to Hell, 
Dad, it’s too late to save me now.
I am among their rotting carcasses, 
I am singing their tortured songs.

Now, I know you never knew the answer, 
that I was fated to this somehow.
I have thrown away my crutches, 
I know where my soul belongs.

I am on the last bus to Hell, Dad, 
take a look at your darling dear! 
I stand here as your ill fated son
and its destiny’s revenge that you will fear.


I’m sorry I couldn’t say goodbye
I’m sorry I can’t hold you anymore mommy
I can’t comfort you as you cry
Your in the bedroom mom you haven’t moved from that place
You can’t see me mom but I’m kneeling in front of you my hands are on your face
Mommy I kissed you on your head
Like you did to me mommy before I went to bed
I want to stay with you mommy
I don’t want to go
I love you so much mommy
This you should know
I got a new outfit mommy
It’s a pretty white dress
And matching wings too
And guess what mommy 
now I can watch over you
I wish you could see me mommy
I wish you could see how I look
I know your upset because it was my life they took
But they can’t take my love, and they can’t take my tears
Because I’ll still have some to shed over the years
Mommy I know your upset but you being happy is what I want to see
Mommy I had a smile on my face as I flew out the doors
You were always my guardian angle mommy but now I can be yours(This is a fictional poem) 

I soar through the air as I shoot webs from my hands.
When people see me, they say there goes Spider-man.
A few years ago I was bitten by a radioactive spider.
After my uncle was murdered, I became a crimefighter.

My spider sense tingles and I can sense danger.
When I brought in my uncle's killer, I was full of anger.
I have spider strength and I can climb walls.
When I battle villains, I defeat them all.

I fight the Green Goblin, Doc Ock and other villains too.
It's what we superheroes have sworn to do.
Because of my contribution, the police just arrested the Kingpin.
Villains constantly try to defeat me but they never win. 

The song is not over till I say so.
I painted the river that is flowing.
So go ahead and try to destroy it.
Do it, do your worse.
Happily ever after.

Too soon and not long enough.
The stuffing is already coming out.
And this bear was just sewed up.
You defiled all my hard work.
How dare you, think I'm ever gonna stop? 

A heart beat is not something that just drops.
It takes time, a hill longing to be climbed.
Above running through the grassy meadows.
You can't destroy this day.
No matter how hard you try.

I'm still smiling.
Till the day I die.
You can't just kill what is inside.
The sleeping giant.
You made him all the larger.
With your words already forgotten.

Fortune grows in the stormy snows of tomorrow.
Hate me, love me, just don't ever get close to me.
Your touch is poisonous.
Your spirit is ravenous.
It just won't let up.
Even with a good meal fed.
A vulture of the unending feasting off both the live and dead.
Do the rotten taste better? 
Why can't you just control your self and try not to hurt anybody else

I found him sitting there
On his only and lonely chair
Lots  of papers on the floor
A candle of light on the table
And Beethoven's poster was on the door.
It looks so scary, cus the shadow of 
The vodoo talisman has fallen on it.

He was writing, my friend
What he calls a poem
And never said a word to me.
Infact he never wanted me 
In the room with him
For I'd only disturb the ideas on his mind.
So, knowin' that, I never said a word
But wrote a note
On a small torn paper
Saying 'tell me when you are done.'
And put  it on the table
Where his eyes can reach it.

An hour passed
With out a single vibration in the room
And that was when
I admired myself for my patience.
But he was really trying me, 
For I was so dying to tell him, 
what  I was going to tell.

I looked on my watch 
And he looked at me
And said smiling, 
'Just one more minute, I'm done'.

With out me realising
That one minute, turned out to be
Two hours and half
My watch  was saying, a quarter to three, 
And that really made me angry.

'Ok that's it I'm going'' 
I said opening the door
But he didn’t look like he gave a damn.
'I came here to tell you  an important something
But you are busy with your thing, 
Your  poem  or whatever'. I said
And when I turned away
He said ' aight I'm done, '
'Tell me what's on your mind? '

That was when 
After a moment of silence
I laughed and laughed and laughed
With anger
at my stupidity of forgetting 
what I came to say.


On the wings of darkness 
your soul will latch.
darkness knows your heart 
has a hole to patch.

It will wait 
till you're all alone.
Waiting for the moment 
when that guard sinks like stone.

It knows who you are, 
where you've been and why.
You can't fight it, 
but oh, you can try.

By the light-less moon
your soul shall fall.
You know you hear it-
darkness's call

"I'M THE GUILDFORD GUILDHALL CLOCK I AM! "

Oh I've been knocking out time now since-eh


let's see Minutes and decades flow through me
The everlasting skies above me.

I'm iconic I am
dressed in my black and gold.
I (if I may be so bold) 
AM GUILDFORD.

The pride of Surrey.

I watch the High Street
as it runs down to that

young whippersnapper statue
THE SCHOLAR or whatever.

People congregate about the chap
eat sandwiches


listen to a busker

busk opera.
Only in Guildford! 

But it's me they look up to! 

And is it time for tea? 
Why so it is and. 
citizens clatter over the cobbles.

I'm the Guildford Guildhall clock I am! 

Tip! top! 

Ticktock! Ticktock! Tiptop! Tip top! 





***Inky gear with million accessories
The - Wisps of clouds
Charismatic Moon 
And Celestial bodies.
You dazzle like a jewel
In the shinning carroty sun, 
You’re calm and poised
When ornamented by the twinkling stars.
‘You’re the Sky’.

Crystalline drops wetted with effervescence
The - Ebbing and soaring waves
Turbulence and tranquility
Azure brilliance.
I catch the morning light
And sketch the rising sun on me.
I shine, I glow and I feel beautiful
When complimented by the sky.
‘I’m The Ocean’.

I love it when you are in a mischievous mood
It’s when you stir up a breeze - And play with me.
I treasure and hold every pearly tear that you shed
Happy or otherwise - And I consume it.
I love it when you elevate the temperature
It’s then that you evaporate me - And fly me to your abode. 

We’re so much like the ‘Ocean and the Sky’ -
Eager to meet, 
Complimenting each other, 
Sharing Secrets, 
Seeming to kiss and embrace.

We’re so much like the ‘Ocean and the Sky’ -
Summiting at the horizon - 
Which is a mere apparition.

We touch, 
But the touch dosen't reach 
Beyond our borders.

(September I'm the one with the ruby slippers
I whispered to myself
in a scene of great

distress

in a dream it all came back to me: 
the captive feeling in the unfeeling
castle

and the witch

green as new grass
sprung up again

I'm the one with the ruby slippers; 
I'm not the one that melts
I muttered to myself again
under the witch's witchng stare: 

fire cannot quench
nor water burn

the singular heart annointed
in this.

or any other nightmare

The tension grows, an idea lingers, 
And yet somehow it’s stuck.
I’m thinking, ‘just my luck’! 

The pen is starting to want to play, 
Upon the paper, and have its say.
And yet there’s no feedback.
I’m thinking, ‘I’m off track’! 

The pen is tapping away frustrated, 
The owner’s now infuriated.
And yet one shall still strive.
I’m thinking, ‘it must arrive’! 

The pen is gyrating all about, 
There’s something definite coming out.
And yet, a nervous time.
I’m thinking, ‘will it rhyme? ’, 

The pen is slowing, and it will stop.
It’s done its writing and needs to flop.
And yet, this work of art, 
I’m thinking, ‘is from the heart’! 

The pen has finished its job and rests.
It has done well, its achieved its best.
And yet, it will do more, 
I’m thinking. ‘That’s for sure’! 

The pen -  has run out of ink.

I think

I'm tired, I'm tired of life, brother!
Of all that meets my eye;
And my weary spirit fain would pass
To worlds beyond the sky.
For there is naught on earth, brother,
For which I'd wish to live;
Not all the glittering gauds of wealth
One hour of peace can give.

I'm weary,--sick at heart, brother,
Of heartless pomp and show!
And ever comes some cloud to dim
The little joy I know.
This world is not the world, brother,
It seemed in days agone,
When I viewed it through the rainbow mists
Of childhood's rosy dawn.

I would not pain your heart, brother--
I know you love me well;
And that love is laid upon my soul,
E'en as a holy spell.
But I'm weary of this world, brother,
This world of sin and care;
And my spirit fluttereth to be free,
To mount the upper air!

I know not of the world, brother,
To which I wish to go;
And perhaps my soul may there awake
To know a deeper woe!
They say the pure of earth, brother,
Find there undying bliss;
While all the wicked ones are cast
Into a dark abyss!

I look upon the stars, brother,
That gem the vault of blue;
I feel it must be true;
For I see on all around, brother,
The impress of a hand
That blendeth and uniteth all
In one harmonious band.

I am that which I am, brother,
As the Creator made;
To _Him_, all-holy and all-pure,
No fault can e'er be laid.
He knows my weakness well, brother,
And I can trust his love
To bear me safe through Jordan's stream
To brighter worlds above. 

I wanted to send you this rhyme

To help you through this sad time

This time which the one you loved has earned their wings

But now there where the angel sings

Now they watch over you from above

They still and always shall send you their love

Their still with you from when the wind blows to looking at the sea

But now their spirit is finally free

Free from sadness, free from pain

Free to forget their bane

I am truly sorry about your loss

But they now stand beside our savior who died on the cross. 

Across the Irish Sea,
It's the only thing for me.

I've tried walking sideways,
And walking to the front,
But people just look at me,
And say it's a publicity stunt. 

To prove that I love you. 

An immigrant lad, loved an Irish colleen
From Dublin Galway Bay.
He longed for her arms,
But she spurned his charms,
And sailed o'er the foam away 

She left the lad by himself, on his own
All alone, a-sorrowing
And sadly he dreamed, or at least that's the
way it seemed, buddy,
That an angel choir did sing -
An angel choir did sing. 

Across the Irish Sea.
It's the finest thing for me. 

And so I've tried walking sideways,
And walking to the front.
But people just laughed, and said,
'It's a publicity stunt'. 

To prove that I love you. 

White, Asian, Black, Caucasian were all minorities
Everyone seems to have their own priorities.
Religion and intolerance is a big factor.
Our society doesn't know what they're after.
Noone likes to share, 
They fight over what really isn't their's.

In our world we have many religions
All with their own conformities.
White, Asian, Black, and Caucasian were all minorities
With priorities.

Be careful where it is you walk, 
How you dress, and how you talk.
Because out there in that vast world
We have race's and groups who
Will be offended if you break their rules.
We are all minorities with careless priorities.

Do not only love your own race
Because there will only be space left to discriminate with much disgrace.
This racisim of the world only generates hate, 
And we carry this madness farther when we discriminate.


Conformity is not always the way to go, 
Individuality is something we all need to show.
Were all the same within this massive game.
This game is no joke nor a laugh
You got one chance to succeed and finish every task.
So don't waste your time hurting others
It gets you nowhere and the feeling only smothers.

Everyone is different, you can't change that.
You can't make them like you, you can't beat that.
Killing eachother has nothing to prove.
Its not just a pick and choose, its not something we should do.
We are all human, we all have souls.
We all live together and to keep ourselves progressing, 
Through life we must learn to lean on others.

What makes us human? 
Well this is the answer, 
Our emotions is what makes us human.
With no emotions we would be machines that wouldn't
Be able to experience what life really is.
But since we have emotions doesn't make it right to use
What we feel to inflict plight on people 
Who are searching for a light.
Were all different whether its on the outside or in, 
Were all fighting to win, this isn't a sin.
But discriminating is a sin that comes from within.

We may look different on the outside.
But we all have feelings and we all have a heart.
Now lets as a Movement Of Unity block this
Unrighteous deed that we see in our communities.

Take Hitler and the Jewish.
Hitler discriminated against the Jewish and many followed, by force.
Many followed because he had the power, the upper hand.
They were afraid they would be killed if they didn't accept his commands.

The world as a whole wants to live in Peace and Harmony.
But that will only happen if 
We stop this scrutiny.

Peace and Harmony only come when we remember 
The true values of humanity and equality.
We must all be treated equally.
We can join to form a majority, we can all have the same priorities.

If we just all open our eyes and take a peek, 
You might be surprised at what you'll see.
Take a new perspective, and step into the shade.
You shall see that we are all basically the same. 
So please lets stop this discrimination, its not a game

If you want a lover 
I'll do anything you ask me to 
And if you want another kind of love 
I'll wear a mask for you 
If you want a partner 
Take my hand 
Or if you want to strike me down in anger 
Here I stand 
I'm your man


If you're looking for a shoulder to rest your head
Then please, I'm your man.

If you're feeling that your loads to heavy to carry
Then  please, I will help take some, I'm your man.

If you're feeling kind of down in the mouth
and can't seem to straighten life's problems out
Then please, come to me, I'm your man.

If you're wondering just who to turn in times of trouble
Turn to Me, I'm always here, I'm your man.

When the world seems not the place for you
Please reach out, and take My hand.

If you're looking for the right words to say
I will come to you and help you to pray.
For I was created you see in just that way
Please come to me, for I'm your man. 

Remember me? your alter ego
My face that haunts your tortured dreams
Reaching out to hold you back, 
I'm your yesterday
Do you remember how I robbed your youth? 
Suspended time for you alone, 
Telling you that life would wait for you? 
Oh so much older, but you're still a child, 
Living for today, but living it in my memory, 
Remember me, I'm your yesterday. 

I reached up into the top of the closet
and took out a pair of blue panties
and showed them to her and
asked 'are these yours? ' 
and she looked and said,
'no, those belong to a dog.' 
she left after that and I haven't seen
her since. she's not at her place.
I keep going there, leaving notes stuck
into the door. I go back and the notes
are still there. I take the Maltese cross
cut it down from my car mirror, tie it
to her doorknob with a shoelace, leave
a book of poems.
when I go back the next night everything
is still there. 
I keep searching the streets for that
blood-wine battleship she drives
with a weak battery, and the doors
hanging from broken hinges. 
I drive around the streets 
an inch away from weeping,
ashamed of my sentimentality and
possible love. 
a confused old man driving in the rain
wondering where the good luck
went. 

I'm tired of wakin' up
To this same story.
Life's h*ll, I hate
But there's no glory.

What would I give
If you really believed I was sorry? 

And I can hardly believe my fate, 
But it's slapping me in the face.
There's just nothing I wouldn't give. 
But what's done is done.

That's the way that it is.
Now I'm asking you for this: 
A second chance, just to prove I'm different.


(Written sometime between June and July to review my weaknesses 
and repair my faults 
then eat and drink 
and watch the list 
burn in the candle 
lit for that purpose

from California Breeze (I make this in a warring absence when
Each ancient, stone-necked minute of love's season
Harbours my anchored tongue, slips the quaystone,
When, praise is blessed, her pride in mast and fountain
Sailed and set dazzling by the handshaped ocean,
In that proud sailing tree with branches driven
Through the last vault and vegetable groyne,
And this weak house to marrow-columned heaven,

Is corner-cast, breath's rag, scrawled weed, a vain
And opium head, crow stalk, puffed, cut, and blown,
Or like the tide-looped breastknot reefed again
Or rent ancestrally the roped sea-hymen,
And, pride is last, is like a child alone
By magnet winds to her blind mother drawn,
Bread and milk mansion in a toothless town.

She makes for me a nettle's innocence
And a silk pigeon's guilt in her proud absence,
In the molested rocks the shell of virgins,
The frank, closed pearl, the sea-girls' lineaments
Glint in the staved and siren-printed caverns,
Is maiden in the shameful oak, omens
Whalebed and bulldance, the gold bush of lions,
Proud as a sucked stone and huge as sandgrains.

These are her contraries: the beast who follows
With priest's grave foot and hand of five assassins
Her molten flight up cinder-nesting columns,
Calls the starved fire herd, is cast in ice,
Lost in a limp-treed and uneating silence,
Who scales a hailing hill in her cold flintsteps
Falls on a ring of summers and locked noons.

I make a weapon of an ass's skeleton
And walk the warring sands by the dead town.
Cudgel great air, wreck east, and topple sundown,
Storm her sped heart, hang with beheaded veins
Its wringing shell, and let her eyelids fasten.
Destruction, picked by birds, brays through the jaw-bone,

And, for that murder's sake, dark with contagion
Like an approaching wave I sprawl to ruin.
Ruin, the room of errors, one rood dropped
Down the stacked sea and water-pillared shade,
Weighed in rock shroud, is my proud pyramid;
Where, wound in emerald linen and sharp wind,
The hero's head lies scraped of every legend,
Comes love's anatomist with sun-gloved hand
Who picks the live heart on a diamond.

'His mother's womb had a tongue that lapped up mud,'
Cried the topless, inchtaped lips from hank and hood
In that bright anchorground where I lay linened,
'A lizard darting with black venom's thread
Doubled, to fork him back, through the lockjaw bed
And the breath-white, curtained mouth of seed.'
'See,' drummed the taut masks, 'how the dead ascend:
In the groin's endless coil a man is tangled.'

These once-blind eyes have breathed a wind of visions,
The cauldron's root through this once-rindless hand
Fumed like a tree, and tossed a burning bird;
With loud, torn tooth and tail and cobweb drum
The crumpled packs fled past this ghost in bloom,
And, mild as pardon from a cloud of pride,
The terrible world my brother bares his skin.

Now in the cloud's big breast lie quiet countries,
Delivered seas my love from her proud place
Walks with no wound, nor lightning in her face,
A calm wind blows that raised the trees like hair
Once where the soft snow's blood was turned to ice.
And though my love pulls the pale, nippled air,
Prides of to-morrow suckling in her eyes,
Yet this I make in a forgiving presence. 

I married you for all the wrong reasons,
 charmed by your dangerous family history,
 by the innocent muscles, bulging like hidden
 weapons under your shirt, by your naive ties, 
the colors of painted scraps of sunset.
 I was charmed too by your assumptions
 about me: my serenity— that mirror waiting to be
 cracked, my flashy acrobatics with knives in the kitchen.
How wrong we both were about each other, 
and how happy we have been. 



help me in my unbelief, 

I so much want to surrender, 

I want to grow beyond this grief, 

I want to learn to really love, 

To be nourished like the tender leaf--



I want to see your hand in every failure, 

Your victory in every defeat, 

May you have compassion upon my struggle

That I may know I am strong when I am weak--





All my attempts to imitate you

I simply offer you as a beginner


That your good works I may not hinder 

For a poem 
Poet sits up late at night
Even more than one
For a full moon
We are to wait a fortnight
For a spring
We are to wait a monsoon
We are to wait a winter also.

For a field, full of paddy
For a sky, full of joy 
And for a heart, full of love
I may wait throughout  my life
I may wait in every birth. 

I meet you in your tears
like a pearl, keep under your eye lid
or else will be trampled by pedestrian
certainly it will pain me

I meet you in your smile
like a flower blossoms in early morning
do not let the sun rays to kiss
or else it will be withered

I meet you in your wrath
like the fire to burn the creation
do not let it to flare
or else it will  burn you first

I meet you in your love
like a rose smiling under your eye lid
embellishing the petal with tears
the dew drop on each petal of lips
with commotiom to fall on my palm
and kiss you to undulate your heart. 

I met a dragon face to face
the year when I was ten,
I took a trip to outer space,
I braved a pirate's den,
I wrestled with a wicked troll,
and fought a great white shark,
I trailed a rabbit down a hole,
I hunted for a snark.

I stowed aboard a submarine,
I opened magic doors,
I traveled in a time machine,
and searched for dinosaurs,
I climbed atop a giant's head,
I found a pot of gold,
I did all this in books I read 
when I was ten years old. 

I met a genius on the train
today
about years old,
he sat beside me
and as the train 
ran down along the coast
we came to the ocean
and then he looked at me
and said,
it's not pretty. 

I met a seer. 
He held in his hands 
The book of wisdom. 
"Sir," I addressed him, 
"Let me read
 

"Child -- " he began. 
"Sir," I said, 
"Think not that I am a child, 
For already I know much 
Of that which you hold. 
Aye, much
 


He smiled. 
Then he opened the book 
And held it before me. -- 
Strange that I should have grown so suddenly blind. 

Who laughed and smiled! 

And with absolute faith and conviction, 
She said to me, 
'All will be well, 
I know it'! 

She seems so familiar I thought, 
Maybe I've known her before, 
In another life? 

And we talked about science and philosophy, 
And the nature of reality.

And the evening was filled with Magic

Well, there I was in the candy store, 
choosing my candy from the counter. 
In she walked wings on her feet, 
and her head, way up in the clouds. 
I grabbed up a penny chew, 
before I could even get the wrapper off, 
she was on the other end of it. 
I looked down my nose; 
all I could see were teeth, 
and two big eyeballs looking at me.

Well, there I was looking at what I had hooked, 
the fish kept wriggling in front of me. 
When along she came bold as brass, 
and stood right there beside me. 
I grabbed up a penny chew, 
before I could even get the wrapper off, 
she was on the other end of it. 
I looked down my nose; 
all I could see were teeth, 
and two big eyeballs looking at me.

Well, I had had enough by now, 
so I asked her to marry me. 
Those big eyeballs rolled around, 
and the teeth said, "Yes please." 
So here we are on our wedding night, 
all tucked up in bed and I looked, 
not a penny chew in sight. 
I said, "No penny chews, my dear? "  
"I don’t believe it! Our wedding night and all he wants is a penny chew! "How to pick up a lily
And that its skin breaks under the steel
Of a too long gaze from the mountain top
And that its petal knows nothing of its root
And that the night falls only when it lowers the buds
Thirsty of the sun and the sun's only the wolf's one
Howling at the wounds of a torn out flower


Srela sam ljude koji nisu znali
Kako se bere ljiljan
I da njegova koža puca pod celikom
Suviše dugog pogleda sa vrha planina
I da njegova peteljka ne zna njegov korijen
I da kad spusti latice tek onda padne noc
Žedna sunca a ono samo vucje
Zavija na rane pokidanog cvijetatoo many clouds swelled the things of blue
the twins of planets moved down the currents
there where the rains happened
unknowingly innocently regretfully perhaps
someone delivered me
a parcel of flesh unopened imploding each day


I miss

I miss the way you say my name
I miss your smile 
I miss the way you make me feel
I miss you

I miss the sparkle in your eyes
I miss the love you had for me
I miss having your shoulder to cry on
I miss your arms around me

I miss the way you make me smile
I miss the way you hug me
I miss the way we always met
I miss everything about you

I miss your warmth
I miss the love raidiating from you
I miss the softness of your lips
I miss you


I met u after so many years
I saw u with my eyes in tears
I remember the stupid things we did
I think we just acted like a kid
we roamed about without any strain
we didn’t know whether we will meet again
we played and danced with joy and fright
and told each other what was right 
Not seeing u has hurt my heart 
but I know that it will not tear us apart 
I don’t know when I’ll see you again
we didn’t know whether we will meet again
but no matter for how long we part
we will always dwell in each others heart
I know you wouldn’t be as sad as me
but I know that u will be missing me


I miss you when I awake in the small hours of the
Morning, aching so deep I cannot sleep. 
It is you I crave – only with you beside me can there be peace. 

This was not meant to be – it cannot be! I rage inside 
To know that you cannot be mine. I reach across dark miles; 
Are you, too, awake – curled on your side in foetal agony? 

And in the morning I must pretend that I am rested, 
Bright and ready for a new day. And that you, my love, 
Are just another smile in my circle of happy friends.

This fire inside is held in check for love of you. 

I miss your laughter, fun, and gentleness.
I miss the things I used to do for you.
I miss the time, now filled with emptiness, 
When each day was a stage for something new.
I miss your love; though mine for you remains, 
A passion with no outlet to the sea, 
A teardropp in a desert, that contains

I miss, for my love's labor, the reward
Of seeing some small pleasure in your face.
All these I miss, and yet they are all here
Within my heart, far more than I can bear. 

I miss seeing your smiling face
I miss seeing your shining eye
I miss seeing your pretty smile
I miss seeing your love's tie
So for you I hope and wish
Falls upon you and your faith
So you can look and feel great. 

I miss you doc, wish you were here
to tend to all our ills
miss your prescriptions.  
miss your pills
the remedy you always gave
with your supernattra skills

I miss you doc, I miss the love, ..
fit me like a glove! 
through all the push and shove, ..
your care rose high above
soared graceful like a dove

I miss you doc, . .. 
miss your passion and your drive, 
wish you were still alive, 
still teaching black folks
how to survive 
once they've been stung
by the bees 
in this racist hive

I miss you doc


This world appears as a paradise
when i think of you my mom dear
Where I feel free to laugh and smile
And enjoy every bit that is here

I love you dearly my dear mom
You alwsy bring joy in my life
where sweet scent of evening breeze
Blows all around for fain to survive

I want to have you with me mom
To walk on the road I'm passing by

And wish to hold your hands my dear
For you're a prime source of life's joy
And you bring me happiness and cheer

Love you Ma


I miss you mom whenever I am
at school or at my homework see

I miss your hugs and kisses 
that you used to give me

I miss your sweet and 
caring voice calling me

I miss those presents on my 
birthday that you used to give me

I miss your beautiful face 
making smile looking at me

I miss your loveable anger
that had an advice for me

I miss whenever i got prizes 
and your happiness for me

I miss the breakfast that you
used to prepare for me

I miss whenever i was late
from school and your worry for me

I miss you mom whenever I am 
at school or at my homework see


No words can describe what i feel inside
No man nor woman can replace who you are to me
You've been my angel when the devils roamed
You were my shining light through my storms
You are my friend
You are the soul
You're always pushing me to reach any goals
I miss you so much
I'm missing you
And i hope that you are missing me too


I miss you so much.
As the morning rises.
And the day comes to a close.
The pain of missing you never ceases.
When I think of you my face creases.
All I can say is I miss you so.

Life hasn't been the same, 
since you webt away.
And my tears still stay.
And my heart aches for you every day.

I breath in your smell.
Oh how I wish you were here.
All I know now is that I miss you so.

You are the brightest star at night.
And your smile is in the sun.
As I remeber the fun.
I miss you so much.
I dont think my heart will ever mend.


Love you and miss you gran


I haven’t seen you in so many days.
Oh please don’t say we part ways.

Want to feel an I miss you so much.
Eye to eye I ache your loving touch.

Just your thoughts elevate my being.
Days drift I become lost unseeing.

My racing heart I can barely control.
My love to me you the only console.

I would have you sit by my side.
The world an heavens so I’d ride.

Oh lord please let her feel the same.
Send again love from whence it came.

(May Here I am sat thinking about you, 
Im sure I hear you call my name, 
Amy, Amy, Amy.
As I turn to see who's calling me
I see no one, only hear your voice.
What are you Trying to tell me? 

I glance across the room, 
To see if anyone else hears it too.
But no one seems to notice the look of shock on my face.

I miss you so much, I keep telling you, 
But you don't seem to hear me.
I wish Id told you I loved you more.

Still you're calling out my name, only louder, 
As the tears roll down my face, 
I miss you all the more.
As I look around the room.
I expect to see you there.

Then I realized  you are gone. 
I look to see if any one else has heard you too.
Seems it's only me who heard.

Are you trying to tell me something.
Cos i want you to no I love you.

Liberty fixation to fashiondom 
Elitists indulging jocund stardom, 
Rookie like me
It’s utter bedroom boredom.  

Joy of
Imprisoned liberty
Phew out 
Share shout yell: 
Futility of untidy elitedom, 
Utility of tidy weedom.

Stardom crispy pop corn
Aftertaste without
Weedom boiled barley
Aftertaste lingering with. 

Weedom is wisdom
Stardom is cliched Omnidom. 
Stardom the
Unhappy haveall
Weedom the
Happy havenot.

Stardom into-ing
Enjoying scanty in plenty
Weedom into-ing
Savoring plenty in scanty.

Stardom the clamp bottleneck
Acheful squeeze out, 
Weedom the zigzag rill
Flow drift in joy oozing out. 
 
Stardom is ‘selfhomicidal’
Weedom is heady survival.

Cloak off stardom
Cloak in weedom. 


-----

I sit in my room out of sight
I dont mean it by slight.

I look at a bottle of Pills and a knife
Wondering which one should end my life
I no longer want a life of strife

I must do it tonight 
Before Midnight
When there tucked up in bed
So they dont find me.

I learned life isn't fair
And No one Cares

I pick up the knife
My life is done
One quick slash
And In a flash I'm on the floor

I lie there dying as you walk in
You scream at the sight
You want to save.
I plead for you not to.

But as we get to the hospital
The machine goes dead.
They cant revive me.
I've gone

'Mum, I gave up the fight'
As I lay back
My whole world goes Black


I must go down to the sea again, 
to the lonely sea and the sky;
I left my shoes and socks there - 
I wonder if they're dry

unfortunately, i was wrong, 
so i must go on.
you're not what i thought
not who you said
not what i expected
just a figment of my imagination.
fooling my every thought.
proven to me, what you were not, 
and the unbearable pain, i can't take inside

your smile won't let me leave
your touch gives me so much grief
who you are won't let us be
it's true, loving you, is like loving me

i hate to let you go, 
and don't want you to be gone, 
but this is what i have to do 
because i can't let this continue.
unspeakable, inseparable, are my feelings for you
stuck to my heart like glue
it was perfect as i strived for perfection, 
but, it was too good to be true

i was doing you wrong, as you were doing me too
i never lied, although i didn't tell you
this can no longer be, 
it's most definitely true, 
because loving you, is like loving me

i'm sorry but i must go on"I Must Tell You This Story'
 
I have, A Story I Must Tell! 
Of a Prince who lived so long ago.
He came to earth as a babe with nothing
Birthed in a manger and wrapped in Swaddling clothes.

His name had not yet been given
But a King to some, it was known.
For one day to wear, a crown of jewels 
And to sit at the right hand, of His Father’s throne.

He came to earth given a task
To speak the words of His reason for coming.
But there were those who did not listen or like
The words of Love and mercy, His lips were compounding. 

"I am the way, the truth and the light! "
"For no man may come to the Father, but through me! "
But even though the people wanted to follow this Messiah
They knew they would be crucified, if thought to believe. 

One day this man was crucified
And nailed, and hung upon a plain wooden cross.
Still He lives to save all mankind
Cleansing sins, from all who
Are dying of sin and lost. 

This is a story that I had to tell
So that you could know the true meaning why.
And my heart aches for the Babe born
That on a cross for my sins, He died.

So while you’re opening up your presents
And shall remain, until the end of time! 




I must try haiku, 
There is nothing left to do, 
But try something new, 

Have I got it now? 
Should I not include a cow? 
I think not somehow.

This will take some time, 
I’m committing haiku crime, 
Not a verse should rhyme

So I’ll start again
And from rhyming I’ll refrain
Feeling quite inane

Doolittle said it thus 
By George I think she's got it, 
Con-que-ring hai-ku

See the setting sun, 
Reflect gold upon the sea, 
Clouds hold dazzling hue. 

I do not know him at all, 
Even his name for me is unknown, 
His works are mystery sound, 
But everyone loves him so much.

One day in my life, 
Something happen i can't understand why, 
Rains that pour so much in my eyes, 
An aching heart, , , a lonely soul.

I need a place, 
But not just an ordinary place to live, 
An abode, 
Where love exists.

I need a home, 
Like a heaven up in the sky
A merry heart, , , , 
Like an angel sings their favorite lines, hallelujah! ! ! . 

Sunday is a holiday then we are going to that place.
That silent place full of silence,  we are there standing, 
we  saw the so many coloured greenish leaves big trees.
 so many birds, and butterflies decorating the blue sky
Then a butterfly dancing in the sky.
Together we Keep  a released longing.
 sitting near in the shallow river.
We  see  fishes in the depth so calm
We  look up at the rainbow in the sky.

We look up at the bright sky.
So many little stars that saying i'never fallen in love.
We look up at the crescent in the sky never sleep, we are given peaceful light.
Together we to lean in the dark park a light below crescent.
Listening at angel voice we calling from heaven.

Leant we were below the coconut tree in the beautiful beach of silence*

The fish in sea was very calm*

The nine were for me enchanted*
The ten hmmm. .. 

continue in the room**When you travel you're never too far away
When you stay, you're always too near
And although there are times I miss you
There are times I wouldn't mind if you were to disappear

My mind has wrapped itself around you
Over and over, about a million times
It knows all the good and all the bad
I wish there was more to you, sometimes

Could you be new for me
A new voice, a new face, a reinvention, a supplant
With fresh ways, another phase
But you keep saying that you can't


I start to walk forward, 
With wishes, 
that won't come true.

While singing, 
The cold rain falls, 
On the thoughts left behind.

I want to forget, 
I need to forget.
As I keep wandering in circles.

I'll force all my depression, 
On you.
I'm telling a lie.

Because we are, 
A shapeless couple, 
I was important to me, 

I want to hear everything, 
Here and now.
If we discus it, 
Will thing change. 

I need not go 
Through sleet and snow 
To where I know 
She waits for me; 
She will wait me there 
Till I find it fair, 
And have time to spare 
From company. 

When I've overgot 
The world somewhat, 
When things cost not 
Such stress and strain, 
Is soon enough 
By cypress sough 
To tell my Love 
I am come again. 

And if some day, 
When none cries nay, 
I still delay 
To seek her side, 
(Though ample measure 
Of fitting leisure 
Await my pleasure) 
She will not chide. 

What--not upbraid me 
That I delayed me, 
Nor ask what stayed me 
So long? Ah, no! - 
New cares may claim me, 
New loves inflame me, 
She will not blame me, 
But suffer it so. 

I Need Thy Light (A Villanelle in


Tetrametre) 

To distinguish between black and white
Things of the world that go in disguise, 

To pierce the masks, too weak my sight.
Though ripe in age, I'm too unwise, 
To distinguish between black and white.

To clearly tell the day from night
And cream of Truth from scum of lies, 

Some say Right is mirror of Might; 
My mettle, to me, the power denies
To distinguish between black and white.

At times the Wrong appears as Right; 
From its dark dazzle to shield my eyes, 

Thou holdest Right at a great height! 
To reach that level help me rise.
To distinguish between black and white, 

I need you, not only because
I love you. I need you, because
I can not breath without you.
I can not find joy without you.
I can not hear the music withou you.
I can not find my way.  

without you.
I need you becauses. 
I can not live without you.
that I never knew, 
it was so amazing, 
I almost went insane, 
today you said, 
'I love you.

'Let us look into that, 
Yes, I will dear, 
You know that our best friend must be near. 

They say diamonds are a girls best friend, 
If this is true, 
Why are they measured in carrots then too. 

Diamonds come in different shapes and colors, and styles 
I asked her, 'I wouldn't just one do? ' 

She said, ' If you love, you will buy the best! ' 
I smiled and that is what I did, you know the rest! 

Now, since I have bought my intended the diamond, 
We no longer eat steak, 
I'm on a diet of green on my plate. 

The only thing I have of color, 
Are my carrots, 
And if I complain, 
I quickly learned that all words are the same. 

Words come in bunches, 
So do carrots, 
Now, if I mind my peas and q's 
And do upset her, 
I will be able to afford another type of dinner. 

However, all that I have learn from this is, 
Please allow your plate to full of good old carrots. 

The layers of dust I left 
Before the first morn birth
Think to dance even upon the tombs
Was a call of the cradle
Cast the dirge into echoes
To swell with laughter clouds
To the point of no return


She did not shed a single tear, 
the weeks that she lay dying.
No pain was felt to feed her fear
the morphine soaked up every tear
I never saw her crying.

She'd only ask, 'Don't leave me here
alone, she says, while sighing.
I held her hand, sat very near
played music loud so she could hear.
I never saw her crying.

And now the silence deafens, 
in the now quite empty house.
Unwelcome is the errant tear, 
from memories of this past year.
Reminding me, I never saw her crying.


I never saw myself getting this old, 
When I was young, this was something we weren't ever told. 

I look in disgust every time I must, 
Look into the mirror, 
I wonder, 
Do people really see what I see? 

Surely they must, 
I'm the same person, 
Of this I'm probably for certain, 
However, everywhere I go, 
I just ask one question, 
When you go to bed 
And when you wake up, 
Are you the same person

I never touched a Rainbow.
But seen I quite a few. 
I've never seen the Dawn's wet grass, 
But heard I of its Dew.

A Love has never reached Me, 
Yet sometimes Deserts rain. 
Quick I'd be to drink of it: 
As quick as Virgins wane. 

I never would have had the nerve
when you were around. 
With your bright mind, 
and your academic prowess
and your acerbic
(adorable)  
wit.

A wordsmith par excellence -
published no less -
you penned
persuasively, 
pedagogically, 
perspicaciously.
(I often needed a dictionary)  

I never would have had the nerve
when you were around. 
so I hid in the shadow
of your intellectual rigor, 
typing your scrawl
(you should have been a doctor)  
and offering you
draft after exhaustive draft
until it was perfect.

I never would have had the nerve
when you were around. 
but you're not here any more
are you? 
And I am learning, 
day by day
to tell MY story. 

Now I lay me down to sleep.
And pray the lord my soul to keep.
In the morning I hope I dont wake.
Its my shitty life I so want to take.

I now lay me down to sleep.
Once I've done the ugly deed.
My pain I do not need.

My life is shit.
I dont mean a thing.
Pain was all I was given.

And if it means I go to hell.
Then so be it.
It cant be any worse than this


How do you go out looking like that? 
Dressing just like a disheveled rat
With that scraggly grey beard
Making you look real weird
And you're hopelessly ugly and fat

Your hair style makes you look like you've quit
A skunk tail perched atop a big zit
Then they say; "If you care
Take a look over there
It's called a mirror; look into it

"I tell you that I see her still
At the dark entrance of the hall.
One gas lamp burning near her shoulder 
Shone also from her other side
Where hung the long inaccurate glass
Whose pictures were as troubled water.
An immense shadow had its hand
Between us on the floor, and seemed 
To hump the knuckles nervously, 
A giant crab readying to walk, 
Or a blanket moving in its sleep.

You will remember, with a smile
Instructed by movies to reminisce, 
How strict her corsets must have been, 
How the huge arrangements of her hair
Would certainly betray the least 
Impassionate displacement there.
It was no rig for dallying, 
And maybe only marriage could 
As when a great ship, coming home, 
Coasts in the harbor, dropping sail
And loosing all the tackle that had laced
Her in the long lanes.  
                                         I know 
We need not draw this figure out
But all that whalebone came for whales
And all the whales lived in the sea, 
In calm beneath the troubled glass, 
Until the needle drew their blood.
I see her standing in the hall, 
Where the mirror's lashed to blood and foam, 
Beat at the air till the light blows out. 

You fill this heart with warmth 
from your tender touch. 
You light up my life 
whenever you are around. 
You bring a spring to my step 
whenever you walk with me, 
and I only want to be with you.

Your tender words take 
all my blues away. 
Your smile lights up life 
every single day. 
You are all these things 
and much, much more, 
and I only want to be with you.

February ever, ever did I think, 
At anytime in my life, 
That I’d be the author of, 

Okay, Okay, I know, I know, 
Web sites haven’t been around that long, 
Alright, so how about this? 

The Masters’ plan is just that, 
It doesn’t matter where you want to be at, 
When your name is called and given a task, 

Firmly planted in a soulful root, 
Straight like an arrow your vine will shoot, 
Then to entwine all that you need, 
Complete the assignment and return the deed.

However, why would you settle for second best? 
Accept the challenge with vigor and grace, 
Knowing upon completion you’re in first place.

Why is it so easy to take a gift from man? 
As the present withers from human hands, 

People say they want the best from Him, 
And when He puts it front of their face, 
Because it’s not what they expected, 
Many seek answers in another place.

Alcohol, needles, sniff & swallow drugs, 
You poor little baby and all because, 
So now you are feeling abandoned, unloved.

To answer whatever call, 
Remember He will choose another, 
Should you quit, stumble and fall.

Isn’t always peaches and cream, 
Walk by faith and not by sight, 
Things aren’t as bad as they seem. 

I only wish to love you
A storm fills the valley
A fish the river

I have made you the size of my solitude
The whole world to hide in
Days and nights to understand

To see no more in your eyes
Than what I think of you
And a world in your image

And days and nights ruled by your eyelids. 

In a wilderness, in some orchestral swing 
through trees, with a wind playing all the high notes, 
and the prospect of a string bass inside the wood, 
I, or someone like me, had a kind of vision. 
As the person on the ground moved, bursting halos 
topped first one tree, then another and another, 
till the work of sight was forced to go lower 
into a dark lair of fallen logs and fungi.

His was the wordless death of words, worse 
for he remembered exactly where the words were 
on his tongue, and before that how they fell 
effortlessly from the brainpan behind his eyes.
But the music continued and the valley of forest floor 
became itself an interval in a natural melody 
attuned to the wind, embedded in the bass of boughs, 
the tenor of branches, the percussion of twigs.

He, or someone like him, laughed at first, 
dismissing what had happened as the incandescence 
of youthful metabolism, as the slight fermentation 
of the last of the wine, or as each excuse of love. 
Learning then the constancy of music and of mind, 
now he takes seriously that visionary wood 
where he saw his being and his future underfoot 
and someone like me listening for a resolution. 

i admire beauty
before my eyes
i trace curves; 
contours patiently
with gentleness
light as whisper

sometimes wondering
what makes them so; 
so special; not only
me who does but many
even i close my eyes
i can still see; feel


 And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping,
With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,
 To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping,
Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary,
 Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move,
And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,
 And all the little emptiness of love!

Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there,
 Where there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending,
  Naught broken save this body, lost but breath;
Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there
 But only agony, and that has ending;
  And the worst friend and enemy is but Death. 

I played day and night with my comrades, 
and now I am greatly afraid.

my heart trembles to mount its stairs: 
yet I must not be shy, if I would enjoy His love.

My heart must cleave to my Lover; 
I must withdraw my veil, 
and meet Him with all my body: 

Mine eyes must perform the ceremony of the lamps of love.

Kabîr says: 'Listen to me, friend: 
he understands who loves. 
If you feel not love's longing for your Beloved One, 
it is vain to adorn your body, 
vain to put unguent on your eyelids.

'I praise you so many times
Tell me, how many times
should I praise you

your lips are like petals of flower
I see your moon-knife eye-brow

The glare of your face
is making me blind
before canopy of your face
moonlight is getting fade

How should I praise you
tell me my dearest love
you are the beautiest one
glittering ever in my life. 

I  pray to always stay up
But around me are things, 
that pull me down.

A time will come 
and 
I will be forever up.. 

After I destroy things 
that pull me down.  . 

I prefer the gorgeous freedom,
And I fly to lands of grace,
Where in wide and clear meadows
All is good, as dreams, and blest.
Here they rice: the clover clear,
And corn-flower's gentle lace,
And the rustle is always here:
"Ears are leaning.  Take your ways!"
In this immense sea of fair,
Only one of blades reclines.
You don't see in misty air,
I'd seen it

It will be mine

I preferred to call smoke;  ONLY SMOKE; as it was disdainfully dirty and horrendously polluted the serene carpets of atmosphere, 

I preferred to call the stone ONLY STONE; as it was bereft of the slightest of empathy; stared in morbid silence for hours immemorial towards the blanket of
stars, 

I preferred to call the pig ONLY PIG; as it prolifically disseminated and perpetuated filth in every mesmerizing path it transgressed, 

I preferred to call the knife ONLY KNIFE; as it harbored the virtue of indiscriminate blood; ghastily ripped through innocent flesh at diabolical will, 

I preferred to call a chunk of obnoxious sewage ONLY SEWAGE;  as it punctuated the rhapsodic air with an unfathomably repulsive perfume, 

I preferred to call a tornado ONLY TORNADO; as it mercilessly annihilated the most minuscule trace of life existing on this planet, 

I preferred to call an earthquake ONLY EARTHQUAKE; as it gobbled up immaculate entities in the swirl of its viciously reverberating tremors, 

I preferred to call an avalanche ONLY AVALANCHE; as it impregnated an inexplicable wave of deathly chill in all those tangible scattered around; treacherously
engulfed heavenly children in cloudbursts of satanic snow, 

I preferred to call the thorn ONLY THORN;  as it invidiously pierced unsuspecting skin; propelled a flurry of hysterical tears to dribble down the cheeks, 

I preferred to call the footprint ONLY FOOTPRINT; as it triggered in me an inexorable nostalgia for the past; faded into obsolete wisps of nothingness with
the tiniest draught of wind, 


I preferred to call vulture ONLY VULTURE; as it insidiously plucked the flesh of my revered compatriots who had celestially relinquished breath to depart for their heavenly abode, 


I preferred to call the dustbin ONLY DUSTBIN; as it profusely fostered overwhelmingly crumpled fragments; which decimated traces of exuberant energy, 

I preferred to call the dungeon ONLY DUNGEON; as it ruthlessly abdicated all forms of vivaciously blistering sunlight; rotting in perennial darkness; bringing euphoric man closer to his grave, 

I preferred to call bombastic slang ONLY SLANG; as it hideously overpowered the rustically holistic rudiments of an individual; made him wholesomely oblivious to even the place where he was born, 

I preferred to call poison ONLY POISON; as it snapped the fangs of precious existence; with its lethally abominable venom, 

I preferred to call the devil ONLY DEVIL; as he dared the audacity to raise his savagely senseless head in front of my Omnipresent Creator, 

me birth to witness and relish this fabulous world, 


I preferred standing barechested under sweltering rays of the Sun; profusely basking in a pool of gloriously golden sweat, 
Rather than rotting away like a piece of dilapidated dirt incarcerated well within the dungeons; in fear of how the world would look outside.

I preferred plunging intrepidly into the vindictive; valiantly clashing my sword in the supreme exultation of defending my priceless integrity, 
Rather than listening to unsolicited abuse as the days unveiled by; petrified to venture outside in fear of being uncouthly assassinated.

I preferred swimming in full fledged fervor against the tumultuously turbulent waves of the ocean; taking the rhapsodically tangy spray full throttle on my cheeks, 
Rather than sitting like a disheveled banana on the shores; ruminating unsurpassable number of times; upon the aftermaths after being devoured by the sharks.

I preferred clambering up the treacherous slope of the mountain head on against the exuberant breeze; with the soles of my robustly sturdy feet the only respite, 
Rather than waiting countless decades for a golden helicopter to descend; catapult me to the absolutesummit within lightening flashes of the eye.

I preferred walking boundless kilometers in the astronomically dense forest; searching for the glamorous fruits of nature which I savored even in my dreams, 
Rather than wait like a frigidly parasitic mosquito on the ground; for destiny to place the fathomless festoon of berries; languidly in my lazy lap.

I preferred wholeheartedly embracing the euphorically crackling flames of fire; profusely relishing the flamboyant warmth that rejuvenated every dreary bone in my persona, 
Rather than running a million kilometers away from the blazing inferno; dreadfully afraid of being scorched to the corpse.

I preferred blurting out whatever was fulminating in the topmost compartment of my mind; candidly expressing even the most infinitesimal iota of my feelings, 
Rather than plotting a battalion of insidiously lethal ideas; like a trembling coward behind the back of my compatriots.

I preferred speaking the perpetual truth at the cost of my rubicund flesh; although it blended the sky and the earth together in the swirl of its irrefutably overwhelming agony, 
Rather than camouflaging my words with the cloud of deceitful lies; manipulatively evolving every word I spoke.

Rather than strangulating my senses painstakingly; bit by bit; as I watched them bonding her sacrosanct countenance with the mate of her choice.

And I preferred to die infinite deaths this very instant with my head held high; and the voice of my impeccably righteous conscience dictating me to execute every action of my existence, 

I can't say.  That I will never leave you in the roadway
All by your own-
But I promise that I will try my level best to hold your hand
As long as I can
 
I can't say.   That I will support you in any situation
That you'll be in
But I promise- That I won't let any situation
Come between us
 
I can't say.  That you will be the only charming special girl
In my life
But I promise.  That every girl coming into my life
Will remind me of you

Just for you
But I promise.  That wherever I'll go inside my heart
I'll be just with you

And I never will
But I promise.  That whatever is ahead in our life, 
We'll face it together

in the tenure of your convivially symbiotic life; and I promise I'll enchant you till times beyond infinite infinity; enchant you even more than ever before,

Date me like I've forever wanted to date even the most diminutive element of 
your majestically heavenly form; and I promise I'll date you till times beyond infinite infinity; date you even more than ever before, 

Bewitch me like I've forever wanted to bewitch each of your centripetally shy senses; and I promise I'll bewilder you till times beyond infinite infinity; bewilder you even more than ever before, 

Spell bind me like I've forever wanted to spell bind even the tiniest of vivacious hair extruding from your regally virgin skin; and I promise I'll spell bind you till times beyond infinite infinity; spell bind you even more than ever before, 

Fantasize me like I've forever wanted to fantasize every shade of your royal existence in a boundless myriad of forms and shapes; and I promise I'll fantasize you till times beyond infinite infinity; fantasize you even more than ever before, 

Preach me like I've forever wanted to preach every unwittingly dwindling nerve of your sporadically jittery persona; and I promise I'll preach you till times beyond infinite infinity; preach you even more than ever before,

comrade in whatever direction you choose to adventure; and I promise I'll accompany you till times beyond infinite infinity; accompany you even more than ever before, 

Stare me like I've forever wanted to stare at the unlimitedly panoramic and profoundly humanitarian depth in your innocuous eyes; and I promise I'll stare you till times beyond infinite infinity; stare you even more than ever before, 

Pat me like I've forever wanted to pat you at the most ephemeral of your accomplishment; and I promise I'll pat you till times beyond infinite infinity; pat you even more than ever before, 

Sketch me like I've forever wanted to sketch every fragrant rendezvous with your Omnipotently endowed grace; and I promise I'll sketch you till times beyond infinite infinity; sketch you even more than ever before, 

Breathe me like I've forever wanted to breathe every ubiquitously philanthropic goodness that emanated from your eternally resplendent creation; and I promise I'll breathe you till times beyond infinite infinity; breathe you even more than ever before, 

But Love me OR don't Love me like I've forever and ever and ever and unconquerably loved you; and I still promise to love you till times beyond infinite infinity; irrespective of your unjustifiable abhorrence for me; 
love you even more than ever before. 

I quote the mornings and awakening
And a sunbeam exploding in a treetop
I quote an old hope between my lips
And the fall of the sun down the abysses of the twilight
I quote the fire that cannot be extinct
In the torches of a cave-like current
The mark of the light on the palm of my hand
And the ashes of my future
I quote the passion of an eye
Destructive and horrifying
Fearing eyesight
I quote the alphabet that goes beyond words
Inexpressibility of every alpha and beta
Gamma and delta
I quote a life
And within my bosom I quote a fear
That everything will remain just a quotation





I thought I had the right of way.
He says He’s suing after all; 
Can you believe the Almighty gall.
"What happened to your spiel on Love? "
"Not right now, Ms. Gilles Villeneuve! 
I’ve been trying to get your whole attention; 
I’m tired of your so-called good intention! "
But I have things to do, a schedule to keep; 
That Sunday check, it is not cheap! 
Clients, family, even a yard, 
And a shoddy attempt to be a bard.
But He tells me He’s feeling quite neglected; 
Always the last one to be selected.
So I’m thinking "a little TLC"
And, just maybe, I could go scott-free.
I suggest coffee in a couple of days.
"I’m giving up caffeine! ", so He says. 
"So, what are my options? " I almost yell.
"I thought you’d never ask to tell.
Take Me with you. I’ll ride along! "
"A ride along? Now that's just wrong! 
Will You pick the radio stations too? "
"Is that too much to ask of you? "
I threatened I would write about this-
"Go ahead! Won’t be your first hit-and-miss! "
"Alright! Alright! Just come along, 
But don’t say much and don’t sing that song! "
So in order to prevent litigation, 
I’m taking Him along-even on vacation

No one gives a damn.
Begging for help.
But for why I dont know? 
It was all to avail.
As I realise no one actually gives a shit.
I may as well do  want.
End my life.
It was a pointless one anyway.

I have realised life wasnt meant for me.
Cos no one else gives a damn.
So why should I? 

You ask for help.
And dont get.
My fate is sealed.
To death I go


I  realised your arrival
when you knocked at the door of my heart
south wind told me yesterday
you were likely to come
I  knew it you would come
like the gale brings a storm with her
lighting  being followed by thnder
the black cloud can never replace 
the azure sky once formed

I'm waiting for your arrival
you are  to be followed by good fortune
It'd change your screaming to a mild smile

Rain is now tired to flood  the earth
certainly it  has to drizzle. 

You are my life
my soul
my cure, 
you are my drink
my water
crystal and pure, 
you are my heart 
my breath
my smile, 
you are my strength
my endurance
my every mile.

You are my taste
my bitter 
my sweet, 
you are my blood
my pulse
my heartbeat, 
you are my wings
my sky
my halo, 
you are my warrior
my knight
my hero.

You are my everything! 
.  

You are my everything

I am
supposed to be

forgetting you &

I find that 
it is

an easy
way of remembering. 

I don't know what else could I have so stupendously cherished for; without your majestically seductive and iridescently twinkling eyelashes? 

I don't know what else could I have so wonderfully fantasized for; without your fantastically vibrant and timelessly sensuous stride? 

I don't know what else could I have so bountifully felt for; without your compassionately divine and spell bindingly  blissful caress? 

I don't know what else could  I have so unrelentingly wished for; without your celestially fragrant and supremely sacrosanct lips? 

I don't know what else could I have so intransigently aspired for; without your philanthropically enchanting and invincibly mellifluous essence of symbiotic
mankind? 

I don't know what else could I have so timelessly yearned for; without your magnificently shimmering and flamboyantly fiery inferno's of passionate desire? 

I don't know what else could I have so unstoppably leapt for; without your beautifully fluttering and vivaciously mischievous shadow? 

I don't know what else could I have so uncontrollably slavered for; without your everlastingly heavenly and pristinely poignant; gorge of sweetness? 

I don't know what else could I have so endlessly strived for; without your synergistically godly and ebulliently extraordinary spirit of righteousness? 

I don't know what else could I have so fanatically obsessed for; without your majestically handsome and marvelously resplendent smiles? 

I don't know what else could I have so indomitably hoped for; without your perennially ecstatic and aristocratically opalescent artistry? 

I don't know what else could I have so boundlessly prayed for; without your magnanimously humanitarian and magically blessing ideals? 

I don't know what else could I have so fathomlessly endured for; without your ubiquitously unlimited and synergistically fructifying voice? 

I don't know what else could I have so ardently dreamt for; without your enigmatically uncanny and princely philandering demeanor? 
I don't know what else could I have so patriotically blazed for; without your altruistically unflinching and fearlessly impeccable conscience? 

I don't know what else could I have so effulgently sung for; without your freshly embellished and newborn bride; crimson cheeks? 

I don't know what else could I have so perpetually loved for; without your charismatically incarcerating and pricelessly infinite heartbeats? 

I don't know what else could I have so immortally exhaled for; without your Omnipotently reviving and optimistically enlightening; fireballs of breath? 
And I really don't know what else could I have so unconquerably lived for; without your undefeatedly godly and Omnisciently benign life

I would like to have my hair back.
It once was thick and nearly black.
Now it is thin and almost white, 
Bald spot reflecting lots of light.

On something else my thinking lingers: 
I'd like to have all of my fingers! 
I once had ten, and that was great.
Now they have been reduced to eight
And two-thirds. And, though it's hard to tell, 
My manhood seems decreased as well.

My eyesight once was twenty-twenty
And now it has diminished plenty! 
My ears are failing; fate's unkind, 
But most of all I miss my mind

And I liked the way you uninhibitedly chattered; caring an infinitesimal damn about the acrimoniously uncouth planet outside, 

And I liked the way you sensuously ambled; tantalizing even the dreariest blade of grass of threadbarely barren soil; to the most unprecedented limits, 

And I liked the way you flirtatiously winked; inevitably inviting even the most lackadaisically vindictive skies; to torrentially rain till times beyond infinite infinity, 

And I liked the way you unflinchingly paraded; as if the every speck of majestically virile earth; irrefutably belonged to you and solely you, 

And I liked the way you ardently stared; perpetually feasting your eyes on
 
And I liked the way you wholeheartedly laughed; wholesomely exhausting even
the minutest trace of your miserably entrapped energy; towards the 
aisles of vivaciously dancing paradise, 

And I liked the way you unconsciously snored; even as the tawdrily corrupt high society around; slept asphyxiating frozen under their frigidly air-conditioned quilts, 

And I liked the way you intrepidly galloped; fantastically discovering profoundly blessing newness; the golden dewdrops of untainted fantasy at every step that you victoriously tread, 

And I liked the way you fearlessly wrote; expressing your philanthropically
benign thoughts with such candour; which was visible only in the regally steaming rays of the Midday Sun, 

And I liked the way you inexhaustibly fought for anti terrorism; exhaled every breath of yours; solely to unite the ghoulishly estranged planet once again; into the 
threads of invincible brotherhood, 

And I liked the way you tackled adversity; staring it right into its pugnaciously imperiling eye; as if a newborn child Omnipotently stares into iridescently milky space, 

And I liked the way you said goodbye when it mattered the most; sacrificing
your umpteenth personal kin; for limitlessly serving your sacrosanct mother
soil, 
And I liked the way you earnestly prayed; not believing in any spuriously indiscriminating religion; but obeisantly bending down to the religion of humanity; even centuries after the last breath of your life, 

And I liked the way you spiritedly danced; liberating unbelievable spurts of magically rejuvenating energy into the sullenly reproachful atmosphere; igniting fireballs of passion even in the most lugubriously penalizing of night, 

And I liked the way you nimbly surrendered; altruistically donating each priceless ingredient of your blessed existence; to save the life of your haplessly staggering compatriots, 

And I liked the way you tirelessly preached; unequivocally advocating the sermons of amiably embracing camaraderie; even as every single organism on this earth cold-bloodedly laughed you out, 

And I liked the way you undauntedly embraced all fraternity of life; as if there existed no diabolical power on this fathomless Universe; which could ever squander 
your impregnably harmonious grip, 

And I liked the way you impeccably cavorted under the first rays of dawn; just as the mischievous infant bounced in the lap of its unconquerably divine mother, 

And I liked the way you sporadically angered; letting vent to the fallibly molecular human within you; which was as sensitive as the royally emerald globule of rain; 
of the very first monsoon, 

And I liked the way you unshakably promised; as if the virtue of your Samaritan commitment would forever shine; even as cadaverous mortuaries of hell blended 
with pragmatically spawning soil, 

And I liked the way you miraculously breathed; as if the gallows of the most
ghastliest of death; had been entirely transcended by the effulgently 
effervescent whirlpools of life, 

And I really loved you in whatever form; shape; color; fraternity; continent; that the Omnipresent Creator had created you in; in whatever stage of life that you met me; in whatever stage of death that your soul bonded with mine; O! Yes; irrespective of whatever yesterday; today or tomorrow that I ever confront; I really; truly and 
shall forever love you. 

Today, i recall you all. 
Across the winds  born of yesterday; 
Over moments spent in growth and - love. 
You, a breath-taking memory of my youth; 

What are you all, but the heartbeat of my childhood? 
When days lingered, it seemed, longer than forever-
When the Seattle rains caressed our nubile skin. 
And the not too frequent sunlight graced our summering shoulders; 

You are the 'Rose Garden' of my growing years
And the fragrance of joy misting itself through Washington State air.

Today, i recall all of you. 
In truth, you never left my heart or mind, ever! ! 
Who disappeared off of my horizons way too soon; 
 

You are as engraved heart prints- -
Who left their most precious marks
Upon times-all too fleeting moments. 
Moments cherished, yesterday, today and forever; 

Yes, today, i recall you all! !

how beautiful it is
with that sparkles
printing in my mind
those warmth, i hug
embedded in me deep

when my eyelids kiss
i find, find emptiness
and looking for reason
at times it wander far
reaching those laughs
fading; waves on rocks


I regret for being cute. 
hence people kiss me. 
by force, through whichcraft!
That is why i don't wash myself. 
So, i rather be stinky
and be surrounded by the flies. 




I remember the day before I was born. 

The sand castles and azure skies, 
I watched with wide impatient eyes.
I yearned to lie in seaside grass, 
Blue-green days where lovers pass.
Envying waves that touched the shore, 
I wanted all the LIFE in store. 
Palmettos swayed and seagulls praised the morn.
I remember the day before I was born! 
I was one with rain and waterfall, 
With canyon echoes and redwoods tall, 
The moon and sun in celebration. 
September birds in V formation.
Gazing upon the Earth below. 
So much to feel, so much to know.
Between Earth and Heaven, untouched, unworn, 
I remember the day before I was born! 


AFTER: 

(April  

I remember the day just after I died. 

A river-town with nectarine skies, 
I watched with tired but patient eyes.
Relieved, at last,  to shed my bones, 
As new colors replaced earth-tones, 
Flesh it was a familiar bond, 
And yet I craved this world beyond.
Endless space is as black as it is wide! 
I remember the day just after I died! 
The wind and rain, the graveside mass, 
Dirty headstones and yellow grass, 
The moon and sun in hesitation, 
I rose to join a V formation. 
Gazing upon the Earth below. 
So much was felt, the fear and woe, 
From Purgatory I heard as he said. 
'A gun in the mouth paints the bathroom red! . 
Damn you and your pain, Damn me and my pride! '
I remember the day just after I died

It was my bridal night I remember,
An old man of seventy-three
I lay with my young bride in my arms,
A girl with t. 

b.
It was wartime, and overhead
The Germans were making a particularly heavy raid on Hampstead.
Harry, do they ever collide?
I do not think it has ever happened,
Oh my bride, my bride. 

By the first of August 
the invisible beetles began 
to snore and the grass was 
as tough as hemp and was 
no color—no more than 
the sand was a color and 
we had worn our bare feet 
bare since the twentieth 
of June and there were times 
we forgot to wind up your 
alarm clock and some nights 
we took our gin warm and neat 
from old jelly glasses while 
the sun blew out of sight 
like a red picture hat and 
one day I tied my hair back 
with a ribbon and you said 
that I looked almost like 
a puritan lady and what 
I remember best is that 
the door to your room was 
the door to mine. 

I remember when i was young.  
I used to be a shy, ignorant & pathetic boy, 
today i made it. 

When I looked into your eyes, 
I knew it was true-
My heart never lies-
I was in love with you.

As you stood there
Just looking around
My whole body melted
into the ground.

I remember the day, 
I remember the time, 
I remember the place, 
It is always on my mind.

You looked so good
In your shirt and jeans.
I remember that night
You were in my dreams.

I wished I could be with you
day after day, 
Because I love you more
than words can ever say. 

I remember the way you forced me.
You spread my legs.
You took my clothes.
You took my childhood
And you stole my innocence.

You forced your tognue over me.
To the back of my throat.

You pinned me down.
I remember the green coat.
I cant even stand the coulour green.

I remember the red bus.
On the top deck.
I cant get a red bus.
Or im back there again.

But its all a joke
cos im stuck there every day.

What is it with scum like you? 
do you love the power
do you search for vualrable people.

I remeber everthing.
I wish the memories would die. 

street lights are still lit up 
as she fills my coffee cup 
with same greeting everyday 
"how's your mom doing today? " 
with a simple grin and "okay, " 
she hands me bagle and jelly 

pinching coins from my pocket 
dropping a quarter on the carpet 
i lean back to see where it lands 
rub my back on somebody's hands 
"excuse me, may i help you please? " 
i turn around my lips is on her face 

i blush, i feel my heart pounds 
i touch her arm; whisper sorry 
she waves her hand; smiles at me 
yes, i give a last quick look at her 
she's so pretty i could remember


I remember the world 
Lying in pieces at my feet
I remember being stronger than this
Yet I'm ready to admit defeat

I remember a simpler time 
When I knew heaven from hell 
Before my vision was blurred
And my soul I was willing to sell

I remember when the ground opened
And threatened to swallow me alive
I reached out my hand
But you didn't grasp it
You stepped back 
And watched me die

I remember learning the truth 
Like a hot shower going 
It was the bitter disappointment 
of finding lead
When I was looking for gold

Like flashes of light
It all comes back
Every once in a while 
Yes I can remember it all
But somehow 
I do so with a smile


I remember crying in my sleep.
I remember wiping my eyes 
on the blanket my Uncle 
brought back from the army, 
with his name and rank
emblazoned on the left hand corner.

The dream that made me unhappy
in my boyhood sleep. 

is private. 

i saw a child all bright and happy
picking cereal boxes, drinks, candy
putting on her moms grocery cart
yes, she knows what family needs
she constantly reminding her mom
i'm all envy, smooth flow of ideas

maybe a reason my mom let us
a fear we can't decide ourselves
oh! i never did consult her of any
i just went out there do it myself
i haven't been in big trouble yet
thanks mom, you taught me right


I Remember, I Remember

I remember, I remember 
The house where I was born, 
The little window where the sun 
Came peeping in at morn; 
He never came a wink too soon 
Nor brought too long a day; 
But now, I often wish the night 
Had borne my breath away.

I remember, I remember 
The roses red and white, 
The violets and the lily cups-- 
Those flowers made of light! 
The lilacs where the robin built, 
And where my brother set 
The laburnum on his birthday,-- 
The tree is living yet!

I remember, I remember 
Where I was used to swing, 
And thought the air must rush as fresh 
To swallows on the wing; 
My spirit flew in feathers then 
That is so heavy now, 
The summer pools could hardly cool 
The fever on my brow.

I remember, I remember 
The fir-trees dark and high; 
I used to think their slender tops 
Were close against the sky: 
It was a childish ignorance, 
But now 'tis little joy 
To know I'm farther off from Heaven 
Than when I was a boy. 

Do you know what I’d give
What I got, what I’d give to go back? 
Do you know that I’d give
Up my life just as easy as anything? 
And we pass and your voice
Like a death grip on my heart attack
It’s so superficial 
Such a f**king w***e don’t care about anything

[Chorus]
Hate is a word that describes what this
In a hall emptied up I’m a name on a list
Of a laundry bag filled with glass I punch with my fist
I remember
When suicide was just a joke

I believed what you said
You believed that I’d always be clean
A fresh slate of my arms
Couldn’t take the days that I hurt for you
Maybe if you weren’t so cruel
I wouldn’t ‘ve had to feel the pain
And if you weren’t so good lookin’
Maybe I wouldn’t want to die

[Chorus]
When suicide was just a joke [X

Well everybody knows you’re the one to call
When the girls get ugly on the back of the wall
You’re a polysaccharidal leaching germ to my brain
The camera sees the one thing leaving

Do you know what it is 
To make stop dropp offs of misery? 
And when I tell you I feel
Do you know that I’d really rather go? 
A mixed media chart
Tracing cold hard lies of my history
Yes I scream in the night
Because of you, I’ve never felt so low

[Chorus]

When suicide was just a joke
(I remember)     
When suicide was just a joke
(I remember)     
When suicide was just a joke 
[Spoken: This life was so funny]
When suicide was just a joke
[Take back your f**king things]
When suicide was just a joke
[I remember all your lies]
When suicide was just a joke

(fade out)Like an early morning tied, whos waves
endlessly washed upon a warm
sandy beach, so to, do the memories of
you, wash over my every waking moment.

I remember watching you sleep as the morning
sun filtered through the lace curtains you made.
I watched in silence, at the way the suns soft rays
kissed your sleeping form, never waking you.
Your face, so peaceful, and always with a
faint hint of a wry smile. I always wondered, 
what is she seeing? Thinking? 

That face, that so many times, was smothered
with thousands of gentle, caring, 
loving kisses from me.

I remember our being fused together as one.
Never wanting to stop. Never wanting to let go.
Kissing.  

hugging.  

touching places in body
and soul we never knew existed.

I remember my daily trek to the buildings of
the concrete jungle and my calling you
several times a day.  

just to hear your voice.

I remember the empty place within me, 
that only you could fill, with love, joy
and that good to be alive feeling.

I remember every laugh and every tear we
ever shed together.

I remember every time and every place you
said, 'I love you.'

I remember the day I came home and you
were not at the door. My heart skipped a
beat. You had been ill, and I raced to our bedroom.
You lay atop the covered bed. Your eyes, in a
blank stare. Open. As I moved to the bed, 
I knew you were gone, tears scalding my cheeks.
I sat beside you, holding your hands, 
closing your eyes and softly kissing them.

I remember that look; 'the light of life.  

had
left your eyes.' Like a dropp of water in the
desert, my passion for life and living, 
dried up and left with you.

I had traveled the world. From the Alps in
Switzerland to the flowers of the field
in the mid west. Yes, I saw the Vatican, 
paintings of the greats and historic places
a thousand years old. I saw the Pyramides.
I witnessed the beauty and promise of the world.
In all these things.  

you were the best
part of who I had become. In all these things. 
you were the most treasured.

And you went away.
And I miss you.
And I love you.

You were the grey beret and the still heart.
In your eyes the flames of the twilight fought on.
And the leaves fell in the water of your soul.

Clasping my arms like a climbing plant
the leaves garnered your voice, that was slow and at peace.
Bonfire of awe in which my thirst was burning.
Sweet blue hyacinth twisted over my soul.

I feel your eyes traveling, and the autumn is far off:
Grey beret, voice of a bird, heart like a house
Towards which my deep longings migrated
And my kisses fell, happy as embers.

Sky from a ship. Field from the hills:
Your memory is made of light, of smoke, of a still pond!
Beyond your eyes, farther on, the evenings were blazing.
Dry autumn leaves revolved in your soul. 

walking to a shed for no reason
just avoiding traffic at noon
i saw a man so familiar to me
we talk about going home to island
building house, owning piece of land
where ants will come to share farm

i am only thinking of vacation
not staying for a long season
maybe i've been away for so long
and this place is really my home
i love winter, snow christmas
maybe i will visit you in desert


There never was a mood of mine,
Gay or heart-broken, luminous or dull,
But you could ease me of its fever
And give it back to me more beutiful.
In many another soul I broke the bread,
And drank the wine and played the happy guest,
But I was lonely, I remembered you;
The heart belong to him who knew it best.

On the eve of All-Souls' day,
And left my grave for an hour or so
To call on those I used to know
Before I passed away.

I visited my former Love
As she lay by her husband's side;
I asked her if life pleased her, now
She was rid of a poet wrung in brow,
And crazed with the ills he eyed;

Who used to drag her here and there
Wherever his fancies led,
And talk of vain vague purposings
That she discredited.

She was quite civil, and replied,
'Old comrade, is that you?
Well, on the whole, I like my life. -
I know I swore I'd be no wife,
But what was I to do?

'You see, of all men for my sex
A poet is the worst;
Women are practical, and they
Crave the wherewith to pay their way,
And slake their social thirst.

'You were a poet - quite the ideal
That we all love awhile:
But look at this man snoring here -
He's no romantic chanticleer,
Yet keeps me in good style.

'He makes no quest into my thoughts,
But a poet wants to know
What one has felt from earliest days,
Why one thought not in other ways,
And one's Loves of long ago.'

Her words benumbed my fond frail ghost;
The nightmares neighed from their stalls,
The vampires screeched, the harpies flew,
And under the dim dawn I withdrew
To Death's inviolate halls. 

I rose up at the dawn of day--
`Get thee away! get thee away!
Pray'st thou for riches? Away! away!
This is the Throne of Mammon grey.'

Said I: This, sure, is very odd;
For everything besides I have:
It is only for riches that I can crave.

I have mental joy, and mental health,
And mental friends, and mental wealth;
I've a wife I love, and that loves me;
I've all but riches bodily.

And He never turns His face away;
The accuser of sins by my side doth stand,
And he holds my money-bag in his hand.

And he'd pay for more if to him I would pray;
And so you may do the worst you can do;
Be assur'd, Mr. Devil, I won't pray to you.

Then if for riches I must not pray,
So, as a church is known by its steeple,
If I pray it must be for other people.

I shall eat coarser food, and go worse shod;
So, as I don't value such things as these,

And god said I know.





Why didnt you listen? 
When I said no.
Why did you still carry on? 

I was only 
But Knew it was wrong.

I tryed to run.
I tryed to get free.
But you held me there.
You wouldnt let me go.
I was your prisoner.

I tryed to say no.
I was iggnored.

You iggnored me.
You carried on.

I remeber your sick words.
This is my pleasure.
You must give me pleasure.
You have to please me.

No I didnt.
Not that you cared.

Your sick in the head


I SAID, This misery must end:  
Shall I, that am a man and know  
that sky and wind are yet my friend,  
sit huddled under any blow?  
so speaking left the dismal room          
and stept into the mother-night  
all fill’d with sacred quickening gloom  
where the few stars burn’d low and bright,  
and darkling on my darkling hill  
heard thro’ the beaches’ sullen boom          
heroic note of living will  
rung trumpet-clear against the fight;  
so stood and heard, and rais’d my eyes  
erect, that they might drink of space,  
and took the night upon my face,          
till time and trouble fell away  
and all my soul sprang up to feel  
as one among the stars that reel  
in rhyme on their rejoicing way,  
breaking the elder dark, nor stay          
but speed beyond each trammelling gyre,  
till time and sorrow fall away  
and night be wither’d up, and fire  
consume the sickness of desire. 

I said to Love, 
"It is not now as in old days 
When men adored thee and thy ways 
   All else above; 
Named thee the Boy, the Bright, the One 
Who spread a heaven beneath the sun," 
   I said to Love. 

   I said to him, 
"We now know more of thee than then; 
We were but weak in judgment when, 
   With hearts abrim, 
We clamoured thee that thou would'st please 
Inflict on us thine agonies," 
   I said to him. 

   I said to Love, 
"Thou art not young, thou art not fair, 
No faery darts, no cherub air, 
   Nor swan, nor dove 
Are thine; but features pitiless, 
And iron daggers of distress," 
   I said to Love. 

   "Depart then, Love! . . . 
- Man's race shall end, dost threaten thou? 
The age to come the man of now 
   Know nothing of? - 
We fear not such a threat from thee; 
We are too old in apathy! 
Mankind shall cease.--So let it be," 
   I said to Love. 

I said to Love,

"Thou art not young, thou art not fair,
No elfin darts, no cherub air,
Nor swan, nor dove
Are thine; but features pitiless,
And iron daggers of distress,"
I said to Love.

"Depart then, Love!
Man's race shall perish, threatenest thou,
WIthout thy kindling coupling-vow?
The age to come the man of now
Know nothing of?
We fear not such a threat from thee;
We are too old in apathy!
Mankind shall cease.. -
So let it be,"
I said to Love. 

I said to Love,

We fear not such a threat from thee; 
We are too old in apathy! 
Mankind shall cease.--So let it be," 
     I said to Love. 

I said to the wanting-creature inside me:
What is this river you want to cross?
There are no travelers on the river-road, and no road.
Do you see anyone moving about on that bank, or nesting?

There is no river at all, and no boat, and no boatman.
There is no tow rope either, and no one to pull it.
There is no ground, no sky, no time, no bank, no ford!

And there is no body, and no mind!
Do you believe there is some place that will make the
soul less thirsty?
In that great absence you will find nothing.

Be strong then, and enter into your own body;
there you have a solid place for your feet.
Think about it carefully!
Don't go off somewhere else!

Kabir says this: just throw away all thoughts of
imaginary things,
and stand firm in that which you are. 

I sat for a few moments
before my work began. 
Sat and listened to 
the morning as it began. 
The little birds 
and their cheery wake up call, 
loud alarm clocks sounding, 
car engines starting up, 
 every sleepy head yawning. 
All getting up and out of bed, 
and me, 
I just sat there 
listening to it all 
at the beginning 
of a brand new day.


January  sat within the temple of her heart,
And watched the living Soul as it passed through,
Arrayed in pearly vestments, white and pure.
The calm, immortal Presence made me start.
It searched through all the chambers of her mind
With one mild glance of love, and smiled to view
The fastnesses of feeling, strong-secure,
And safe from all surprise. It sits enshrined
And offers incense in her heart, as on
Of an imperishable love passed through
The lattice of my senses, and I, too,
Did offer incense in that solemn place-
A woman's heart made pure and sanctified by Grace. 

I save this teardrop
Invaluable as it is
For my journey
Full of rocks and bushes thorny
And I drink it
As a drop of rain
In hot Summer. 

I saw a chapel all of gold 
     That none did dare to enter in,
     And many weeping stood without,
     Weeping, mourning, worshipping.

     I saw a serpent rise between
     The white pillars of the door,
     And he forc'd and forc'd and forc'd,
     Down the golden hinges tore.

     And along the pavement sweet,
   Set with pearls and rubies bright,
   All his slimy length he drew
   Till upon the altar white

   Vomiting his poison out
   On the bread and on the wine.
   So I turn'd into a sty
   And laid me down among the swine. 

I saw a man pursuing the horizon; 
Round and round they sped. 
I was disturbed at this; 
I accosted the man. 
"It is futile," I said, 
"You can never -- " 

"You lie," he cried, 
And ran on. 

I SAW a new world in my dream,  
Where all the folks alike did seem:  
There was no Child, there was no Mother,  
There was no Change, there was no Other.  
 
For everything was Same, the Same;  
There was no praise, there was no blame;  
There was neither Need nor Help for it;  
There was nothing fitting or unfit.  
 
Nobody laugh’d, nobody wept;  
None grew weary, so none slept;
There was nobody born, and nobody wed;  
This world was a world of the living-dead.  
 
I long’d to hear the Time-Clock strike  
In the world where people were all alike;  
I hated Same, I hated Forever;
I long’d to say Neither, or even Never.  
 
I long’d to mend, I long’d to make;  
I long’d to give, I long’d to take;  
I long’d for a change, whatever came after,  
I long’d for crying, I long’d for laughter.
 
At last I heard the Time-Clock boom,  
And woke from my dream in my little room;  
With a smile on her lips my Mother was nigh,  
And I heard the Baby crow and cry.  
 
And I thought to myself, How nice it is 
For me to live in a world like this,  
Where things can happen, and clocks can strike,  
And none of the people are made alike;  
 
Where Love wants this, and Pain wants that,  
Where all our hearts want Tit for Tat
In the jumbles we make with our heads and our hands,  
In a world that nobody understands,  
But with work, and hope, and the right to call  
Upon Him who sees it and knows us all

There stood a red rose of elegance, 
In a field of loneliness; 
The wind blows and each breeze takes a petal, 
Its stem is becoming weak; 
The clouds are closing in on the rose's place.
The raindrops begin to fall; 
Still the wind blows and takes away its beauty, 
After hours of pain, the remains stand limp; 
As the last petal hang, 
I saw a tear fall from its face and felt sorrow. 

I saw from the beach, when the morning was shining, 
A bark o'er the waters move gloriously on; 
I came when the sun o'er that beach was declining, 
The bark was still there, but the waters were gone. 

And such is the fate of our life's early promise, 
So passing the spring-tide of joy we have known; 
Each wave that we danced on at morning ebbs from us, 
And leaves us, at eve, on the bleak shore alone. 

Oh, who would not welcome that moment's returning 
When passion first waked a new life through his frame, 
And his soul, like the wood that grows precious in burning, 
Gave out all its sweets to love's exquisite flame. 

I saw his round mouth's crimson deepen as it fell,
Like a Sun, in his last deep hour;
Watched the magnificent recession of farewell,
Clouding, half gleam, half glower,
And a last splendour burn the heavens of his cheek.
And in his eyes
The cold stars lighting, very old and bleak,
In different skies.[I saw his round mouth's crimson deepen as it fell],
Like a Sun, in his last deep hour;
Watched the magnificent recession of farewell,
Clouding, half gleam, half glower,
And a last splendour burn the heavens of his cheek.
And in his eyes
The cold stars lighting, very old and bleak,
In different skies. 

I SAW in Louisiana a live-oak growing,
   All alone stood it, and the moss hung down from the branches;
   Without any companion it grew there, uttering joyous leaves of dark
         green,
   And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself;
   But I wonder'd how it could utter joyous leaves, standing alone
         there, without its friend, its lover near--for I knew I could
         not;
   And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it, and
         twined around it a little moss,
   And brought it away--and I have placed it in sight in my room;
   It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,
   (For I believe lately I think of little else than of them;)
   Yet it remains to me a curious token--it makes me think of manly
         love;                                                        For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in Louisiana,
         solitary, in a wide flat space,
   Uttering joyous leaves all its life, without a friend, a lover, near,
   I know very well I could not. 

I saw my friend to the front door
I stood in the golden dust.
Momentous sounds issued
From the little belfry close by.
Tossed! Such a made-up word-
What am I, a flower or a letter?
But my eyes already gaze grimly
Into the darkened looking glass. 

I saw my life as whitest flame 
light-leaping in a crystal sky, 
and virgin colour where it came 
pass'd to its heart, in love to die. 
It wrapped the world in tender harm 
rose-flower'd with one ecstatic pang: 
and all the trembling region rang 
music, whose silver veils dispart 
around the carven silences 
Memnonian in the hidden heart — 
now blithe, effulgurant majesties. 

I SAW old General at bay;
   (Old as he was, his grey eyes yet shone out in battle like stars;)
   His small force was now completely hemm'd in, in his works;
   He call'd for volunteers to run the enemy's lines--a desperate
         emergency;
   I saw a hundred and more step forth from the ranks--but two or three
         were selected;
   I saw them receive their orders aside--they listen'd with care--the
         adjutant was very grave;
   I saw them depart with cheerfulness, freely risking their lives. 

I saw the Devil yesterday, 
Children dead, their parents slain, 
People silenced for what they say, 
Leaders applauding sorrow and pain.

Tornados, floods, and hurricanes, 
And hatred on every land, 
The sky she cries her acid rain, 
More money is the main demand.

Holy wars with unholy actions, 
Diseases man made set loose, 
Drugs to cure non-satisfaction, 
Rape, and robbery, child abuse.

Genocide has become a fad, 
Prejudice is denied but true, 
People are bitter, angry, and sad, 
All innocence in through.

I saw the Devil yesterday, 
In wide screen a thousand clues, 
As I listened to all they say, 
On the channel fifteen news. 

I saw thee weep--the big bright tear
Came o'er that eye of blue;
And then methought it did appear
A violet dropping dew:
I saw thee smile--the sapphire's blaze
Beside thee ceased to shine;
It could not match the living rays
That filled that glance of thine.
As clouds from yonder sun receive
A deep and mellow dye,
Which scarce the shade of coming eve
Can banish from the sky,
Those smiles unto the moodiest mind
Their own pure joy impart;
Their sunshine leaves a glow behind
That lightens o'er the heart. 

I saw them walking
Along the forlorn street
At night against my headlights
Hand in hand together
Whispering into each other

The east wind had just begun
To whisper to the leaves
In hush hush
And what could be these love-birds
Crooning into the ears of each other? 

What could the chill of the night
Hold for them - a distant hut
Where dreams are made
With the feathers of paradise? 

Take a bit of me at least
Into your thoughts
When you share your warmth tonight
Love birds in your nest
So that my night is made
Sweet with the east wind
And soulful solitude
Aloneness sans any bounds

I saw thy form in youthful prime, 
Nor thought that pale decay 
Would steal before the steps of Time, 
And waste its bloom away, Mary! 
Yet still thy features wore that light, 
Which fleets not with the breath; 
And life ne'er look'd more truly bright 
Than in thy smile of death, Mary! 

As streams that run o'er golden mines, 
Yet humbly, calmly glide, 
Nor seem to know the wealth that shines 
Within their gentle tide, Mary! 
So veil'd beneath the simplest guise, 
Thy radiant genius shone, 
And that which charm'd all other eyes 
Seem'd worthless in thy own, Mary! 

If souls could always dwell above, 
Thou ne'er hadst left that sphere; 
Or could we keep the souls we love, 
We ne'er had lost thee here, Mary! 
Though many a gifted mind we meet, 
Though fairest forms we see, 
To live with them is far less sweet 
Than to remember thee, Mary

I saw you often with your head bowed low, 
As if in sorrow from some awful wound, 
Inflicted long ago.
And even when you smiled
Residual sadness lingered in your eyes, 
As though you carried blame
For a loved one's harm, 
Caused by another.
Unjust burden which I wished you shared.
I should have asked, if I'd dared.
It's now too late as we are far apart.
Yet I keep your warmth and sadness in my heart. 

Anyone here had a go at themselves
for a laugh? Anyone opened their wrists
with a blade in the bath? Those in the dark
at the back, listen hard. Those at the front
in the know, those of us who have, hands up,
let's show that inch of lacerated skin
between the forearm and the fist. Let's tell it
like it is: strong drink, a crimson tidemark
round the tub, a yard of lint, white towels
washed a dozen times, still pink. Tough luck.
A passion then for watches, bangles, cuffs.
A likely story: you were lashed by brambles
picking berries from the woods. Come clean, come good,
repeat with me the punch line 'Just like blood'
when those at the back rush forward to say
how a little love goes a long long long way. 

At night I like to run a bath, 
not round the block, 
don't laugh, don't laugh, 
it's not a dog, it is a bath.
Oh you're not daft, 
not daft, not daft. 

They say this love
will leave me sore, 
broken-hearted and torn.

They say I'm a fool, 
a hypocrite, 
a tool for the pulpit.

They say have fun, 
live life, 
get out of the mud.

I say I'm in love, 
that I'm free
and finally whole.

I say I'm happy, 
a truth-teller
of my own life.

I say I'm a sinner, 
who was forgiven, 
and given a life.

I say I'm a daughter, 
a princess of the king, 
who will never die. 

I see around me tombstones grey
Stretching their shadows far away.
Beneath the turf my footsteps tread
Lie low and lone the silent dead -
Beneath the turf - beneath the mould -
Forever dark, forever cold -
And my eyes cannot hold the tears
That memory hoards from vanished years
For Time and Death and Mortal pain
Give wounds that will not heal again -
Let me remember half the woe
I've seen and heard and felt below,
And Heaven itself - so pure and blest,
Could never give my spirit rest -
Sweet land of light! thy children fair
Know nought akin to our despair -
Nor have they felt, nor can they tell
What tenants haunt each mortal cell,
What gloomy guests we hold within -
Torments and madness, tears and sin!
Well - may they live in ectasy
Their long eternity of joy;
At least we would not bring them down
With us to weep, with us to groan,
No - Earth would wish no other sphere
To taste her cup of sufferings drear;
She turns from Heaven with a careless eye
And only mourns that we must die!
Ah mother, what shall comfort thee
In all this boundless misery?
To cheer our eager eyes a while
We see thee smile; how fondly smile!
But who reads not through that tender glow
Thy deep, unutterable woe:
Indeed no dazzling land above
Can cheat thee of thy children's love.
We all, in life's departing shine,
Our last dear longings blend with thine;
And struggle still and strive to trace
With clouded gaze, thy darling face.
We would not leave our native home
For any world beyond the Tomb.
No - rather on thy kindly breast
Let us be laid in lasting rest;
Or waken but to share with thee
A mutual immortality -fairly warm morning
to dropp rain from sky
trees would be trick
that it's spring too
let go of their shoots
to bear fruits early

maybe smarting from past
when frost have its toll
haven't seen much wintering
flocks covering southern sky
could it be they have orders
to stay put and wait months


I know that I don't have to guess, 
why you fit so perfect in my life. 

we now hold hands before His throne. 
You're my partner, my best friend, and now my wife. 

In all the trials you've been through, 
You've never paused to give Him all your praise. 

I see Him in the way you give, 
yourself to others in so many ways. 

I want to shout out 'I love you', 
but since humbled by the things you do, 
Instead I am reflective, and in prayer. 

To be the man that I should be, 
To love with strength and loyalty. 
To never let you doubt how much I care. 

It drives me to be strong and wise. 

I hope that you will always see, 

I see so deeply within myself.
Not needing my eyes, I can see everything clearly.
Why would I want to bother my eyes again
Now that I see the world through His eyes

I

I see the boys of summer in their ruin
Lay the gold tithings barren,
Setting no store by harvest, freeze the soils;
Theire in their heat the winter floods
Of frozen loves they fetch their girls,
And drown the cargoed apples in their tides.

These boys of light are curdlers in their folly,
Sour the boiling honey;
The jacks of frost they finger in the hives;
There in the sun the frigid threads
Of doubt and dark they feed their nerves;
The signal moon is zero in their voids.

I see the summer children in their mothers
Split up the brawned womb's weathers,
Divide the night and day with fairy thumbs;
There in the deep with quartered shades
Of sun and moon they paint their dams
As sunlight paints the shelling of their heads.

I see that from these boys shall men of nothing
Stature by seedy shifting,
Or lame the air with leaping from its hearts;
There from their hearts the dogdayed pulse
Of love and light bursts in their throats.
O see the pulse of summer in the ice.

II

But seasons must be challenged or they totter
Into a chiming quarter
Where, punctual as death, we ring the stars;
There, in his night, the black-tongued bells
The sleepy man of winter pulls,
Nor blows back moon-and-midnight as she blows.

We are the dark deniers, let us summon
Death from a summer woman,
A muscling life from lovers in their cramp,
From the fair dead who flush the sea
The bright-eyed worm on Davy's lamp,
And from the planted womb the man of straw.

We summer boys in this four-winded spinning,
Green of the seaweed's iron,
Hold up the noisy sea and drop her birds,
Pick the world's ball of wave and froth
To choke the deserts with her tides,
And comb the county gardens for a wreath.

In spring we cross our foreheads with the holly,
Heigh ho the blood and berry,
And nail the merry squires to the trees;
Here love's damp muscle dries and dies,
Here break a kiss in no love's quarry.
O see the poles of promise in the boys.

III

I see the boys of summer in their ruin.
Man in his maggot's barren.
And boys are full and foreign in the pouch.
I am the man your father was.
We are the sons of flint and pitch.
O see the poles are kissing as they cross. 

I see the flowers and feel about 
What is it that to pride over, 
What is it to speak in terms of
Ego and flattery
As I am not the type of person 
You are looking for? 

Had innocence been there a flower
And had I painted it, 
It would have been my great asset, 
Which but you too know it not; 
It would, would have better.

There are many like me
But the world knows them not, 
There are many talented like me
But strut and walk on tiptoe they not; 
I have many a thing to say
But they have not.

If I think it that I know it all, 
How can it be, 
You say it to me, 
As I myself know not, 
There is many a thing to me, 
Which but I know not, 
Which but you say it tome? 

What it had not been, I call that my own, 
Where I had not to be and  say it
That deserve I
And if this can be our ethics and sense of morality
Then what to say to you? 

There are many beautiful
Which bloom and fade away in the forest tract
But we know not, 
Come not to feel about their fragrance
And wild beauty, 
Even a child has its simple innocence to teach to
Which but you know not, I too know it not. 

I see the Four-fold Man, The Humanity in deadly sleep 
   And its fallen Emanation, the Spectre and its cruel Shadow. 
   I see the Past, Present and Future existing all at once 
   Before me. O Divine Spirit, sustain me on thy wings, 
   That I may awake Albion from his long and cold repose; 
   For Bacon and Newton, sheath'd in dismal steel, their terrors hang 
   Like iron scourges over Albion: reasonings like vast serpents 
   Infold around my limbs, bruising my minute articulations. 

   I turn my eyes to the schools and universities of Europe 
  And there behold the Loom of Locke, whose Woof rages dire, 
  Wash'd by the Water-wheels of Newton: black the cloth 
  In heavy wreaths folds over every nation: cruel works 
  Of many Wheels I view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic 
  Moving by compulsion each other, not as those in Eden, which, 
  Wheel within wheel, in freedom revolve in harmony and peace. 

Gazing the mountain from my windowpane 
A green monument seen estranged 
Sandwiched in between clouds 
Echo of thunder cried aloud 
At the eastern peak, where misty morning 
Climbed over the cliff, scaling 
Birds glided across, like rainbow rising 
Spreaded their wings, streaming 
Through the sheer rock faces 
Leaving trails in phases 
The pinnacles and crags are mouth watering 
Tempted and lured climbers, a reckoning 
Up above the northern peak 
Zephyr marching oh so weak 
Forming an adiabatic 
Submontane filled with organic 
At the bottom, river terraces 
One of the mountain multi faces 
The crystalline steep slopes 
Decorated with climbing ropes 
Heavenly as seen from above 
A sign of a divine love 
You flowed, like an Andean Amazon 
Our love grown full-blown 
I desire a woman 
I seek a mountain


And still I seem to roam.
With my way lost.
And the path not on track.
So still I continue to roam.
I've lost the way back home.

My hart is heavy.
My heart is all but very sad.
My head is pounding.
But my hart is broken.
It will not heal.
Becuase I am left to roam.

All I do is roam.
Fighting coping on my own.
I've never felt so alone.
As I still continue to roam.
Facing each day as it comes.
Wishing it was the last.
I still continue to roam. 

I send letters to my Beloved, 
The dear Krishna. 
But He sends no message of reply, 
Purposely preserving silence. 
I sweep his path in readiness 
And gaze and gaze 
Till my eyes turn blood-shot. 
I have no peace by night or day, 
My heart is fit to break. 
O my Master, You were my companion 
In former births. 
When will you come?I send Two Sunsets—
Day and I—in competition ran—
I finished Two—and several Stars—
While He—was making One—

His own was ampler—but as I
Was saying to a friend—
Mine—is the more convenient
To Carry in the Hand—I send you here a sort of allegory,
(For you will understand it) of a soul,
A sinful soul possess'd of many gifts,
A spacious garden full of flowering weeds,
A glorious Devil, large in heart and brain,
That did love Beauty only, (Beauty seen
In all varieties of mould and mind)
And Knowledge for its beauty; or if Good,
Good only for its beauty, seeing not
That beauty, Good, and Knowledge, are three sisters
That doat upon each other, friends to man,
Living together under the same roof,
And never can be sunder'd without tears.
And he that shuts Love out, in turn shall be
Shut out from Love, and on her threshold lie
Howling in outer darkness. Not for this
Was common clay ta'en from the common earth,
Of angels to the perfect shape of man. 

I shall be loved as quiet things
Are loved--white pigeons in the sun,
Curled yellow leaves that whisper down
One after one;

The silver reticence of smoke
That tells no secret of its birth
Among the fiery agonies
That turn the earth;

Cloud-islands; reaching arms of trees;
The frayed and eager little moon
That strays unheeded through a high
Blue afternoon.

The thunder of my heart must go
Under the muffling of the dust--
As my gray dress has guarded it
The grasses must;

For it has hammered loud enough,
Clamored enough, when all is said:
Only its quiet part shall live
When I am dead. 

when winter comes it will 
imprint its forgotten wrinkled face 
lengthening the future 
in silence 

the birds have all flown south 

I chose not to watch



from Parting/Departing (I shall go back again to the bleak shore
And build a little shanty on the sand
In such a way that the extremest band
Of brittle seaweed shall escape my door
But by a yard or two; and nevermore
Shall I return to take you by the hand.
I shall be gone to what I understand,
And happier than I ever was before.
The love that stood a moment in your eyes,
The words that lay a moment on your tongue,
Are one with all that in a moment dies,
A little under-said and over-sung.
But I shall find the sullen rocks and skies
Unchanged from what they were when I was young. 

I shall keep trying to end it
 
 
  I shall keep trying to go
With a new attempt
On my life.
Three attempts in a week
And still people must stop me.

I dont get it
Surely its my choice
To live or die.

I shall keep trying
You wont be there all the time
I will do it
What ever it takes. 


When I am gone from here, this place
called earth, I shall miss the ones I
hold so dear.

I shall miss the music of the brook, 
and the symphony of the sea.

I shall miss the meadows and the forest
and the flowers in the spring.

I shall miss the gray light of dawn, the blue
sky above and the gentle breeze on a
dark starry night.

I shall miss the hope of tomorrow, the rush
of the wind and the promise of love.

I shall miss the rain from the sky, the dew
on the grass and the softness of roses.

I shall miss the cold breath of winter, springs
gentle touch, the warmness of summer
and the beauty of fall.

I shall miss the joys in my life, the light that
is truth and the song of the blackbird.

I shall miss the laughter of chlidren, the
wisdom of age and my friends at my side.

I shall miss the silence of an early morn, 
the whisper of the wind and the peace
in my heart.

I shall miss all that there is about
this earth. I shall miss you.  

life.


       I reck not for gold or fame;
I await familiar dust
       These frail fingers to reclaim:
       Not for me the tiger flame.
 
Not for me the furnace glow,
       Rage of fire and ashen doom;
To sweet earth my bones bestow
       Where above a lowly tomb
       January roses bloom.

Fools and fools and fools are you
       Who your dears to fires confide;
Give to Mother Earth her due:
       Flesh may waste but bone will bide,--
       Let loved ones lie side by side.

       Shed your tears and blossoms bring;
On age-burnished bone will gleam
       Crucifix and wedding ring:
       Graves are for sweet comforting.

       Curst be those who my remains
       Hurl to horror of the flames

When I am dead and over me bright April 
Shakes out her rain-drenched hair, 
Though you shall lean above me broken-hearted, 
I shall not care. 

I shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful 
When rain bends down the bough; 
And I shall be more silent and cold-hearted 
Than you are now. 

I shall not go with pain
Whether you hold me, whether you forget
My little loss and my immortal gain.
O flower unseen, O fountain sealed apart!
Give me one look, one look remembering yet,
Sweet heart.

I shall not go with grief,
Whether you call me, whether you deny
The crowning vintage and the golden sheaf.
O, April hopes that blossom but to close!
Give me one look, one look and so good-bye,
Red rose.

I shall not go with sighs,
But as full-crowned the warrior leaves the fight,
Dawn on his shield and death upon his eyes.
O, life so bitter-sweet and heaven so far!
Give me one look, one look and so good night,
My star. 

I shall not return. And night, mildly warm, serene and silent, will lull the world, under beams of its solitary moon.
    My body will not be there, and through the wide-open window, a refreshing breeze will come inquiring for my soul.
    I don't know if any await the end of my double absence, or who will kiss my memory amidst caresses and weeping.
    But, there will be stars and flowers, there will be sighs and hopes, and love in the avenues in the shadows of the trees.
    And that piano will be playing as in this untroubled night, and no one there to listen, pensive, by my window frame. 

I shall return again; I shall return 
To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes 
At golden noon the forest fires burn, 
Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies. 
I shall return to loiter by the streams 
That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses, 
And realize once more my thousand dreams 
Of waters rushing down the mountain passes. 
I shall return to hear the fiddle and fife 
Of village dances, dear delicious tunes 
That stir the hidden depths of native life, 
Stray melodies of dim remembered runes. 
I shall return, I shall return again, 
To ease my mind of long, long years of pain. 

I shed a tear today
Silently, I felt it fall
You caught it
shared it
held it
felt it
then
suddenly
it wasn't
so big
after all. 

Love can only  originate from the Infinite.

Ego limits my  being and my thinking.
Therefore i repeat in my heart: 
I should become smaller, 

the heart that is not in love
will fail the test  of resurrection. 

You weren't my type, 
to begin with, 
well, until I got to know you
and even then I wouldn't have, 
couldn't have 
but, well I thought maybe
but then again maybe not 
and even though we didn't 
and we never would 
there's still a place in my heart
that misses you, needs you, 
your face, your expressions, 
your naughtiness, your humour, 
your ways, your voice. 
You always had a sadness, 
a look about you
that said you were, 
kind of, maybe, 
vulnerable
but I should have known
when I saw her face, 
those eyes, dark, 
bigger than mine
that you'd never 
fall for me. 

How could you not know I
loved you? For it was always
in my eyes, in every touch and
in every polite embrace we've ever
had. It was in all the hello's and
all the goodbye's I'v ever spoken.

Could you not hear the pounding
of my heart and see the soaring
of my spirit? How could you not
know I love you? I have asked
that question a thousand times.

If you are ever to love me, it must
be now, For it is nearly the end
of my time, when the shadow of
the trees grow long and then. 
and then appears no more.


   The armies of those I love engirth me, and I engirth them;
   They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,
   And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the
         Soul.

   Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal
         themselves;
   And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the
         dead?
   And if the body does not do as much as the Soul?
   And if the body were not the Soul, what is the Soul?


   The love of the Body of man or woman balks account--the body itself
         balks account;
   That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.    The expression of the face balks account;
   But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face;
   It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of
         his hips and wrists;
   It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist
         and knees--dress does not hide him;
   The strong, sweet, supple quality he has, strikes through the cotton
         and flannel;
   To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more;
   You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-
         side.

   The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the
         folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the
         contour of their shape downwards,
   The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the
         transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up, and rolls
         silently to and fro in the heave of the water,
   The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats--the horseman
         in his saddle,                                               Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,
   The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-
         kettles, and their wives waiting,
   The female soothing a child--the farmer's daughter in the garden or
         cow-yard,
   The young fellow hoeing corn--the sleigh-driver guiding his six
         horses through the crowd,
   The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty,
         good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sundown,
         after work,
   The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,
   The upper-hold and the under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding
         the eyes;
   The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine
         muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps,
   The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes
         suddenly again, and the listening on the alert,
   The natural, perfect, varied attitudes--the bent head, the curv'd
         neck, and the counting;                                      Such-like I love--I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother's
         breast with the little child,
   Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with
         the firemen, and pause, listen, and count.


   I know a man, a common farmer--the father of five sons;
   And in them were the fathers of sons--and in them were the fathers of
         sons.

   This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person;
   The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and
         beard, and the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes--the
         richness and breadth of his manners,
   These I used to go and visit him to see--he was wise also;
   He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old--his sons were
         massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome;
   They and his daughters loved him--all who saw him loved him;
   They did not love him by allowance--they loved him with personal
         love;                                                        He drank water only--the blood show'd like scarlet through the clear-
         brown skin of his face;
   He was a frequent gunner and fisher--he sail'd his boat himself--he
         had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner--he had
         fowling-pieces, presented to him by men that loved him;
   When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish,
         you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of
         the gang.

   You would wish long and long to be with him--you would wish to sit by
         him in the boat, that you and he might touch each other.


   I have perceiv'd that to be with those I like is enough,
   To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,
   To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is
         enough,
   To pass among them, or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly
         round his or her neck for a moment--what is this, then?
   I do not ask any more delight--I swim in it, as in a sea.

   There is something in staying close to men and women, and looking on
         them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the
         soul well;                                                   All things please the soul--but these please the soul well.


   This is the female form;
   A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot;
   It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction!
   I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor--
         all falls aside but myself and it;
   Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, the
         atmosphere and the clouds, and what was expected of heaven or
         fear'd of hell, are now consumed;
   Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it--the response
         likewise ungovernable;
   Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands, all
         diffused--mine too diffused;
   Ebb stung by the flow, and flow stung by the ebb--love-flesh swelling
         and deliciously aching;
   Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of
         love, white-blow and delirious juice;                        Bridegroom night of love, working surely and softly into the
         prostrate dawn;
   Undulating into the willing and yielding day,
   Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh'd day.

   This is the nucleus--after the child is born of woman, the man is
         born of woman;
   This is the bath of birth--this is the merge of small and large, and
         the outlet again.

   Be not ashamed, women--your privilege encloses the rest, and is the
         exit of the rest;
   You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.

   The female contains all qualities, and tempers them--she is in her
         place, and moves with perfect balance;
   She is all things duly veil'd--she is both passive and active;
   She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as
         daughters.                                                   As I see my soul reflected in nature;
   As I see through a mist, one with inexpressible completeness and
         beauty,
   See the bent head, and arms folded over the breast--the female I see.


   The male is not less the soul, nor more--he too is in his place;
   He too is all qualities--he is action and power;
   The flush of the known universe is in him;
   Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well;
   The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is
         utmost, become him well--pride is for him;
   The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul;
   Knowledge becomes him--he likes it always--he brings everything to
         the test of himself;                                         Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail, he strikes
         soundings at last only here;
   (Where else does he strike soundings, except here?)

   The man's body is sacred, and the woman's body is sacred;
   No matter who it is, it is sacred;
   Is it a slave? Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on
         the wharf?
   Each belongs here or anywhere, just as much as the well-off--just as
         much as you;
   Each has his or her place in the procession.

   (All is a procession;
   The universe is a procession, with measured and beautiful motion.)

   Do you know so much yourself, that you call the slave or the dull-
         face ignorant?                                               Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no
         right to a sight?
   Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float--and
         the soil is on the surface, and water runs, and vegetation
         sprouts,
   For you only, and not for him and her?


   A man's Body at auction;
   I help the auctioneer--the sloven does not half know his business.

   Gentlemen, look on this wonder!
   Whatever the bids of the bidders, they cannot be high enough for it;
   For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years, without one
         animal or plant;
   For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll'd.

   In this head the all-baffling brain;                              In it and below it, the makings of heroes.

   Examine these limbs, red, black, or white--they are so cunning in
         tendon and nerve;
   They shall be stript, that you may see them.

   Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition,
   Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant back-bone and neck, flesh not flabby,
         good-sized arms and legs,
   And wonders within there yet.

   Within there runs blood,
   The same old blood!
   The same red-running blood!
   There swells and jets a heart--there all passions, desires,
         reachings, aspirations;                                     Do you think they are not there because they are not express'd in
         parlors and lecture-rooms?

   This is not only one man--this is the father of those who shall be
         fathers in their turns;
   In him the start of populous states and rich republics;
   Of him countless immortal lives, with countless embodiments and
         enjoyments.

   How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring
         through the centuries?
   Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace
         back through the centuries?


   A woman's Body at auction!
   She too is not only herself--she is the teeming mother of mothers;
   She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the
         mothers.

   Have you ever loved the Body of a woman?                          Have you ever loved the Body of a man?
   Your father--where is your father?
   Your mother--is she living? have you been much with her? and has she
         been much with you?
   --Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all, in all
         nations and times, all over the earth?

   If any thing is sacred, the human body is sacred,
   And the glory and sweet of a man, is the token of manhood untainted;
   And in man or woman, a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is beautiful
         as the most beautiful face.

   Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool
         that corrupted her own live body?
   For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves.


   O my Body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women,
         nor the likes of the parts of you;                          I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the
         Soul, (and that they are the Soul;)
         that they are poems,
   Man's, woman's, child's, youth's, wife's, husband's, mother's,
         father's, young man's, young woman's poems;
   Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears,
   Eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eye-brows, and the waking or
         sleeping of the lids,
   Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw-
         hinges,
   Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition,
   Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck-slue,
   Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders, and the ample
         side-round of the chest.

   Upper-arm, arm-pit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews,
         arm-bones,                                                  Wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, fore-finger,
         finger-balls, finger-joints, finger-nails,
   Broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-bone, breast-
         side,
   Ribs, belly, back-bone, joints of the back-bone,
   Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward round, man-balls,
         man-root,
   Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above,
   Leg-fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under leg,
   Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel;
   All attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your
         body, or of any one's body, male or female,
   The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and clean,
   The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame,                    Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, maternity,
   Womanhood, and all that is a woman--and the man that comes from
         woman,
   The womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping,
         love-looks, love-perturbations and risings,
   The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud,
   Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming,
   Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and
         tightening,
   The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes,
   The skin, the sun-burnt shade, freckles, hair,
   The curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked
         meat of the body,
   The circling rivers, the breath, and breathing it in and out,     The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward
         toward the knees,
   The thin red jellies within you, or within me--the bones, and the
         marrow in the bones,
   The exquisite realization of health;
   O I say, these are not the parts and poems of the Body only, but of
         the Soul,
   O I say now these are the Soul

I SIT and look out upon all the sorrows of the world, and upon all
         oppression and shame;
   I hear secret convulsive sobs from young men, at anguish with
         themselves, remorseful after deeds done;
   I see, in low life, the mother misused by her children, dying,
         neglected, gaunt, desperate;
   I see the wife misused by her husband--I see the treacherous seducer
         of young women;
   I mark the ranklings of jealousy and unrequited love, attempted to be
         hid--I see these sights on the earth;
   I see the workings of battle, pestilence, tyranny--I see martyrs and
         prisoners;
   I observe a famine at sea--I observe the sailors casting lots who
         shall be kill'd, to preserve the lives of the rest;
   I observe the slights and degradations cast by arrogant persons upon
         laborers, the poor, and upon negroes, and the like;
   All these--All the meanness and agony without end, I sitting, look
         out upon,
   See, hear, and am silent.                                           sit back and think
What do young ones really know? 
How to be a mother
A friend who really knows
Then you meet a young person
With ideals and their dreams
And suddenly your face
With an adult not a kid
You know not their past
Of teething and games
That’s a life you have with your own

You look past the youthful
Way that they are
And let them be humans
And live life to the full
We use to be young
At one stage of our lives
What makes us different? 
Is were older and wiser
So we like to think

So I say with a smile
To young adults of this world
I bow down low and say
Hello my friend
We may be much older
And wiser we think
But at times you surprise us
With love and wisdom
That is beyond all your years
And yes I bow and acknowledge you all
Simply because you’re our future
Leaders of tomorrow
Good luck to you all


I said fate plays a game without a score,
and who needs fish if you've got caviar?
The triumph of the Gothic style would come to pass
and turn you on--no need for coke, or grass.
I sit by the window. Outside, an aspen.
When I loved, I loved deeply. It wasn't often.

I said the forest's only part of a tree.
Who needs the whole girl if you've got her knee?
Sick of the dust raised by the modern era,
the Russian eye would rest on an Estonian spire.
I sit by the window. The dishes are done.
I was happy here. But I won't be again.

I wrote: The bulb looks at the flower in fear,
and love, as an act, lacks a verb; the zer-
o Euclid thought the vanishing point became
wasn't math--it was the nothingness of Time.
I sit by the window. And while I sit
my youth comes back. Sometimes I'd smile. Or spit.

I said that the leaf may destory the bud;
what's fertile falls in fallow soil--a dud;
that on the flat field, the unshadowed plain
nature spills the seeds of trees in vain.
I sit by the window. Hands lock my knees.
My heavy shadow's my squat company.

My song was out of tune, my voice was cracked,
but at least no chorus can ever sing it back.
That talk like this reaps no reward bewilders
no one--no one's legs rest on my sholders.
I sit by the window in the dark. Like an express,
the waves behind the wavelike curtain crash.

A loyal subject of these second-rate years,
I proudly admit that my finest ideas
are second-rate, and may the future take them
as trophies of my struggle against suffocation.
I sit in the dark. And it would be hard to figure out
which is worse; the dark inside, or the darkness out.

I sit in solitude on the beach, 
In the silent early morning, 
To listen to the stirrings of my heart, 
And the voice of love, 
Who whispers in my ear.

There is joy as the sun rises, 
At the boundary of sea and sky, 
Its light nourishing my body and soul.

And now,  
A feeling of tears welling up, 
And of humble understanding.

In the silence the secrets spring forth, 
Revealing themselves, 
As the vortex of violet and golden light pulses and swirls at my brow, 
And the white light drips down, 
Filling me with the pure, blissful light of knowing, 
That the Universe is alive, 
And so am I. 

All time I m trying to sketch you
to make a portrait of you
I try to fill the color of life
which color would u like
is not known to me

Color of sanctity is significant to me
Colors of worldly attachment are always perishable
so I must not fill this color in you


I cherish to adore you
to embellish with dews of life
that are fragmentation of 
ecstasy, geminate revivification of life

I like to sketch you
on sea-shore of profound creation
which can not be blown up
by a little wave of devastation 

Thus, my sketch is not fragile
like the petal of a flower
which is withered  with a puff of time

a gorgeous sketch carved over ages
for submission of a portrait of you


I smelled the forest jasmine,   
wild but profound in its perfume.
My bones filled with the perfume
spread on my being to  wake me from my dreams.

I heard the silent music of the night
and felt it kissing my lips softly.
In my heart there were rhythms
unheard of before. 

My limbs moved
to a song and its rhythms
and I felt the softness of the petals
of  the sweet smelling  jasmine. 

Hopefully you’ll always love me 
The kisses the hugs 
Along with the tears that I cry
Thinking that you’re mine 
Trusting you that you’ll never leave me 
I sit here and wait
For your loving arms to embrace
The minute they do
I feel your love for me come true
Knowing that I smile


Only with the annihilation of selfhood 
comes the fulfillment of love.
 
About his austere and steadfast quest, 
when a mystic asked, 
would probably reply like Jacob Boehme: 
 "I am not come to this meaning 
or to this work and knowledge 
through my own reason 
or through my own will and purpose; 
neither have I sought this knowledge
nor so much as to know
anything concerning it. 

therein to hide myself" 

I speak not
As I feel
Speaking is not essential
Silence speaks for itself
Even eyes speak
Speak thousand words my quivering lips
Unsaid words travel million miles
Sun speaks 
Moon speaks
Speaks the thunderstorm
When hearts meet
Mouth says no words
Only the closeness knows
How louder is the heart
When it beats
Beating the loudness of sea-roars. 

I speak not, I trace not, I breathe not thy name;
There is grief in the sound, there is guilt in the fame;
But the tear that now burns on my cheek may impart
The deep thoughts that dwell in that silence of heart.
Too brief for our passion, too long for our peace,
Were those hours - can their joy or their bitterness cease?
We repent, we abjure, we will break from our chain, - 
We will part, we will fly to - unite it again!
Oh! thine be the gladness, and mine be the guilt!
Forgive me, adored one! - forsake if thou wilt;
But the heart which is thine shall expire undebased,
And man shall not break it - whatever thou may'st.
And stern to the haughty, but humble to thee,
This soul in its bitterest blackness shall be;
And our days seem as swift, and our moments more sweet,
With thee at my side, than with worlds at our feet.
One sigh of thy sorrow, one look of thy love,
Shall turn me or fix, shall reward or reprove.
And the heartless may wonder at all I resign - 
Thy lips shall reply, not to them, but to mine.

May,  

A falcon hovers at the edge of the sky. 
Two gulls drift slowly up the river.

Vulnerable while they ride the wind, 
they coast and glide with ease.

Dew is heavy on the grass below, 
the spider’s web is ready.

Heaven’s ways include the human: 
among a thousand sorrows, I stand alone. 

my crazy world 
broke 
by periods 
of sleeping sanity 
in dreams 
that imitate 
dreams 
that I step 
and stop 
to think I stopped
or did I step

I did my best to say I’ll carry you.
When you hate me enough to leave, 
please don’t return with my heart.

Blame me for not understanding
when your thoughts were left unspoken, 
when absence left your soul broken.

I don’t know how this bitter judgement
can overpower what now lies ended.
But you were the one who said it. You said it.

‘Cause I’ll still cradle me in your arms, 
even when you hate me enough to leave.
Please just don’t return with my heart.

Just never think about it now.
Holding onto me in the rain outside, 
Please don’t tell me when it’s goodbye.

For nothing can be done
and there ain’t a fight in me left.
I did my best to say I’ll carry you, 
and I swear I did, I swear I do. 

Daddy---
How I loved
to wear your big shirts
and
clamber after you on
the banistered stairs
Kissing your moustache
when you tickled my feet.  ..

Daddy---
How I loved
to swim in your oversized coats
and
dance with lungful of your cologne.
Listening to your
barreled laughter.

When you had pick me up
spinning me until I fell dizzy


Daddy-----
How things have changed
since I was your little boy
and
once your little pappu.

Now  you are no more, 
and
yet I still clamber after you. 


Some have told me the city will ruin me
Some said the city is an ugly place
The city has marred better men than me

I hadn’t lived in the city for quite some time, 
But living there again was an amazing experience

The city glowed with a dazzling beauty, 
Pumping a vitality in my veins
Through my heart, an exuberant, 
Youthful feeling of excitement

I let the city have my heart.
I thought the city gave me hers.
This love was not meant to last.
I had to leave the city for a little while.

The city couldn’t handle the distance, 
Provoking the city to eject me from
The city’s heart, ripping and tearing
Until I was only a memory, a fling

So I left the city in search of a new life.
I found myself alone in the desert.
I convinced myself the city was only
A memory locked away

The days were sweltering and arduous, 
The nights were frigid and excruciating

These times were spent alone, in silence
Where almost no life is sustainable, 
And I ignored the ghosts which
Maliciously brought about vibrant, 
Heartwarming thoughts of the city

I turned North, the city far passed
The horizon, though its glimmer
Reaches me still

Its lights do nothing but illuminate
The darkness this desert has
Brought into my heart
And the damage my lungs have
Sustained as they drown in my
Quiet tears

In this moment, I unleashed
An ugly, primal scream
From the depths of my marred soul, 
The waves traveling through miles of
Nothingness

It was then when I realized
I still love the city.
But the city doesn’t love me. 

I need a mother who would love me 
I need a mother who would take care of me 
I need a mother who would understand me 
I need a mother for who I am 
I need a mother to know me 
I need a mother who would be there for me 
I need a mother who would not yell at her son
I need a mother who won't push her son away 
I need a mother who would not throw me out of her life 

Even though I still need a mother 
Everyday I try to be nice 
Sometime she don't care about me 
What I need is a mother who would be there for me 
I need a mother who would watch me grow 
I need a mother who would celebrate my birthday 
I need a mother who would miss me 

I need a mother to cry on 
I need a mother to know that her son loves her 

But she won't let me know her 
What I need is a mother

Who is no more now. 

Croak, croak 
Croaks the frog
The sky is overcast 
With clouds
Raindrops falling 
And forming puddles
My friend tells
The frog will come and 
take away your mother.
See, how he calls.

Oh frog, do this never
Never take away my mother
Oh she loves me
She feeds me
She sends me to school
She tells me stories
She cares me when I fall sick
Oh frog, never
Never take away my mother.


I held my mother's hand
Pleaded her to take me in her lap
Ask her to hold me tight
And cover me with her saree
So that I can not hear
When the frog croaks.

My mother's assuring hand
Caressed my head
She sang me a lullaby
Planted a kiss on my forehead
Sat by my side till I fell asleep
With my mother by my side
Darkness thinned
Fear vanished.

Time has passed
Years have gone by
I have left mother for my new home
Mother has gone frail, 
Still I seek her
When I feel worn out
She wipes away the worry
With the ANCHAL of her saree. 

I stood musing in a black world, 
Not knowing where to direct my feet. 
And I saw the quick stream of men 
Pouring ceaselessly, 
Filled with eager faces, 
A torrent of desire. 
I called to them, 
"Where do you go? What do you see?" 
A thousand voices called to me. 
A thousand fingers pointed. 
"Look! look! There!" 

I know not of it. 
But, lo! In the far sky shone a radiance 
Ineffable, divine -- 
A vision painted upon a pall; 
And sometimes it was, 
And sometimes it was not. 
I hesitated. 
Then from the stream 
Came roaring voices, 
Impatient: 
"Look! look! There!" 

So again I saw, 
And leaped, unhesitant, 
And struggled and fumed 
With outspread clutching fingers. 
The hard hills tore my flesh; 
The ways bit my feet. 
At last I looked again. 
No radiance in the far sky, 
Ineffable, divine; 
No vision painted upon a pall; 
And always my eyes ached for the light. 
Then I cried in despair, 
"I see nothing! Oh, where do I go?" 
The torrent turned again its faces: 
"Look! look! There!" 

And at the blindness of my spirit 
They screamed, 
"Fool! fool! fool!"I stood upon a heaven-cleaving turret
Which overlooked a wide Metropolis--
And in the temple of my heart my Spirit
Lay prostrate, and with parted lips did kiss
The dust of Desolations [altar] hearth--
And with a voice too faint to falter
It shook that trembling fane with its weak prayer
'Twas noon,--the sleeping skies were blue
The city.  

I stood upon a high place, 
And saw, below, many devils 
Running, leaping, 
and carousing in sin. 
One looked up, grinning, 
And said, "Comrade! Brother!"I stood upon a highway, 
And, behold, there came 
Many strange peddlers. 
To me each one made gestures, 
Holding forth little images, saying, 
 


But I said, "Hence! 
Leave me with mine own, 
And take you yours away; 
The little gods you may rightly prefer

she is bedridden
lacking of medication
unable  to walk
I again put  a coin
in his pot




But
Ah! I summoned my love



Generous reader

burn this book

It’s not at all what I wanted to say

Though it was written in blood

It’s not what I wanted to say.

No lot could be sadder than mine

I was defeated by my own shadow:

My words took vengeance on me.

Forgive me, reader, good reader

If I cannot leave you

With a warm embrace, I leave you

With a forced and sad smile.

Maybe that’s all I am

But listen to my last word:

I take back everything I’ve said.

With the greatest bitterness in the world

I take back everything I’ve said.




I talk to my inner lover, and I say, why such rush?
We sense that there is some sort of spirit that loves
      birds and animals and the ants—
perhaps the same one who gave a radiance to you
      in your mother's womb.
Is it logical you would be walking around entirely
      orphaned now?
The truth is you turned away yourself,
and decided to go into the dark alone.
Now you are tangled up in others, and have forgotten
      what you once knew,
and that's why eveything you do has some weird
      failure in it. 

I taste a liquor never brewed,
From tankards scooped in pearl;
Not all the vats upon the Rhine
Yield such an alcohol!

Inebriate of air am I,
And debauchee of dew,
Reeling, through endless summer days,
From inns of molten blue.

When the landlord turn the drunken bee
Out of the foxglove's door,
When butterflies renounce their drams,
I shall but drink the more!

Till seraphs swing their snowy hats,
And saints to windows run,
To see the little tippler
Leaning against the sun

Oh! Reject me not! 
Pain is absolute
and I taste death. 

I taught myself to live simply and wisely,
and to wander long before evening
to tire my superfluous worries.
When the burdocks rustle in the ravine
and the yellow-red rowanberry cluster droops
I compose happy verses
about life's decay, decay and beauty.
I come back. The fluffy cat
licks my palm, purrs so sweetly
and the fire flares bright
on the saw-mill turret by the lake.
Only the cry of a stork landing on the roof
occasionally breaks the silence.
If you knock on my door
I may not even hear. 

nigga knew that he was blessed! 
knew every truth he claimed and taught 
would all be second guessed

got fired from his job 
began to hang out with some thugs, . 
a gang most feared would rob
 
when the temple he turned out 
got mad because he knew that wealth 
is not what faiths' about 

He told his partner Lazarus 
his money was no good, .. 
that camels pass through needle's eyes 

the night that he got popped 
his lookout partners went to sleep 
while Judas's plea was copped 

while dragged from judge to judge 
condemned to death and torture 
yet he never held a grudge 

cause I'm a black man too 
and though years have passed, -
What's changed for me and you

How could fate have separated us? 
I think of you and miss you.

I think of your warm and inviting smile
Of the laughter that now brings tears
And I miss you.

I think of your small body wrapped in my arms
Of the hands that caressed your hair
And I miss you.

I think of evenings in front of a fire
Of hot chicken soup now gone cold
And I miss you.

I think of you bravely waving good bye
Of the way you walked out of my sight
And I miss you.

I think of lessons you have taught me
Of the promises I keep
And I miss you.












When the stars shine
In the mighty heavens
I think of you mummy.
My dearest mummy, 
you are there in heaven.
You are there in the world of the stars.
You are a star.
You see me now, 
looking up to you
and calling your name  "Genova"

(Genova is the real name of my beloved mummy.
She died at the age of  She had cancer. I miss her so much)I think you are in love
But I’m not sure if it’s so 
Because how can you tell 
If love is something that you don’t know 

I think you love 
But you can’t really explain 
You know you feel this feeling 
Yet it is hard to say 

I think you love
But you don’t know how to say it 
You need a time and place that exist 
That’s perfect to tell this 

I think you love
But you don’t want to scare you 
due to your past repercussions
Because of crushing what you feel 
Could end too soon 

I think you love
But you ’ll keep this inside 
You ’ll let you know 
When you feel the time is right. 

FIRST VOICE.

I thirst, but earth cannot allay
The fever coursing through my veins,
The healing stream is far away­--
It flows through Salem's lovely plains.

The murmurs of its crystal flow
Break ever o'er this world of strife;
My heart is weary, let me go,
To bathe it in the stream of life;

For many worn and weary hearts
Have bathed in this pure healing stream,
And felt their griefs and cares depart,
E'en like some sad forgotten dream.


SECOND VOICE.

"The Word is nigh thee, even in thy heart


Say not, within thy weary heart,
Who shall ascend above,
To bring unto thy fever'd lips
The fount of joy and love.

Nor do thou seek to vainly delve
Where death's pale angels tread,
To hear the murmur of its flow
Around the silent dead.

Within, in thee is one living fount,
Fed from the springs above;
There quench thy thirst till thou shalt bathe

I thought I will achieve everything in life 
I thought I will get everything in life 
But I kept on loosing everything in life 

I don't know why my dreams broke 
I don't know why my dreams did not 
come true 
I don't know why my eyes kept on 
getting new dreams every time. 

I Thought about you
And lost my memory
In time
I could not remember
The loss
And yet
In you
I have a memory
Of a happier time








I THOUGHT I was not alone, walking here by the shore,
   But the one I thought was with me, as now I walk by the shore,
   As I lean and look through the glimmering light--that one has utterly
         disappeared,
   And those appear that perplex me. 

Church bells
rearrange the silence

scattering birds & sunshine 
disturbing the distance.

A perfect day
in 

Now today
in this

our here
& now

the bells ring out
(as they did then)  

bicycles
& birds

all set in motion

as if synchronized
by their appeals

making me smile
as they chime

for my delectation
& delight

Lou Reed's
PERFECT DAY.

Cool.  

a hip Dutch church
joining in with the clang clang of the trams.

Time now
meaning nothing

&
everything.

I raise my glass
and toast the peals

the time
to be

I only 
knowing that

I want to spend it
.  

with you. 

I thought of you and how you love this beauty,
And walking up the long beach all alone 
I heard the waves breaking in measured thunder
As you and I once heard their monotone.

Around me were the echoing dunes, beyond me
The cold and sparkling silver of the sea --
We two will pass through death and ages lengthen
Before you hear that sound again with me.




It's you who proved me wrong with unfairness.
For ten days we were friends to each other 
And like true friends we talked to each other.

When I appreciated your poetry, 
To read their verses some poets requested me
And few sent request to me to be friend
But you said, 'Why have you stolen my friend? '

I realized, 'You can't be friend; you're a witch.'
Being blocked, you continued insulting me.
On my success you suffer from envy.

Now you are very much afraid of me
As I do know your fake identity.

I thought you were for me, 
I thought you were the person
an the guy of my dreams 
How stupid was I 
to Believe it's the truth, 
The guy of my dreams is so
not like you.
As you lips lie 
my eyes begin to cry.
The love between us died, 
And there is nothin left between 
you an I. 
I should have known
that I had been used, 
I should of known that my 
love for you was fake, 
an saying those three words
now is too late.
You should of been real
You should have been true.
You should have felt the 
love i had for you.
As I'm walkin away, 
wit no words to say, 
Im leaving you behind, 
its all your fault, 
that we have to be a part, 
I dont kno you any more, 
maybe deep inside I do, 
but just remember, 
that tiny hole that 
you have inside, 
is a missing spot 
of the love i had for you. 

M. 

B. 

       I threw my arms about those shoulders, glancing 
       at what emerged behind that back, 
       and saw a chair pushed slightly forward, 
       merging now with the lighted wall. 
       The lamp glared too bright to show 
       the shabby furniture to some advantage, 
       and that is why sofa of brown leather 
       shone a sort of yellow in a corner. 
       The table looked bare, the parquet glossy, 
       the stove quite dark, and in a dusty frame 
       a landscape did not stir. Only the sideboard 
       seemed to me to have some animation. 
       But a moth flitted round the room, 
       causing my arrested glance to shift; 
       and if at any time a ghost had lived here, 
       he now was gone, abandoning this house. 

No sword, no crown

The strength of humility

And the understanding

Of exactly one's self-worth

Measured in the depth of soul

 
Cast away the ego

Of attributions too

Delight in only what you are

The beauty that is essential

Not the make-up, nor the finery

 
I delight in you

For only who you are

Not who I am, nor wish for you to be

 
And you, delight in you

For all you truly are

No more, no less

That who you're meant 

And called upon to be.  .

 
I to you and you to me
 

As we walk along

Outward shells remain, empty 

You and I frankincense infused, celebrating 

To be I to you, and you to me


Our cup overflows 

With wine that flows

Unending from the celestial cup

To be I to you, and you to me






Infused with Frankincense, from a special soul

I, too, sing America.

I am the darker brother.
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes,
But I laugh,
And eat well,
And grow strong.

Tomorrow,
I'll be at the table
When company comes.
Nobody'll dare
Say to me,
"Eat in the kitchen,"
Then.

Besides,
They'll see how beautiful I am
And be ashamed--

I, too, am America. 

Through sin; I failed to understand
I’m saved and born anew

When life’s too bad, for great and small
When empty is inside
We doubt for us! He died

We still believe the devil’s lies
When visiting "The Tree"

Yet darkness fills the wicked mind
Makes hard the heart of man
Just like a fool, I too was blind
To Satan’s evil plan

I failed to care what death would bring
Deceived! I lived in shame
The devil’s song, I loved to sing

His blood; has set me free
And makes these eyes to see

I see "The Truth" the Father’s will
The promised "Holy Flame"
I see the devil’s out to kill
Who think this life’s a game

Who think! to know their right from wrong
Who fail to sing Salvation’s song
Still blind; will surely die-I took my lover by the hand 
And we walked once again.
The forest of our childhood days
Just as it once had been.

And then we talked of her and me, 
The way we lived and died.
I told her that I dreamed of this, 
When she became my bride. 

I travelled among unknown men
In lands beyond the sea;
Nor, England! did I know till then
What love I bore to thee.

'Tis past, that melancholy dream!
Nor will I quit thy shore
A second time; for still I seem
To love thee more and more.

Among thy mountains did I feel
The joy of my desire;
And she I cherished turned her wheel
Beside an English fire.

Thy mornings showed, thy nights concealed,
The bowers where Lucy played;
And thine too is the last green field
That Lucy's eyes surveyed. 

Before this body turns to dust
Before this world I leave
Upon The Rock I’ll cleave


The innocent Lamb sacrificed
I trust His word alone


I trust He chose for man to die
Then rose again to reign
His flock when born-again


I trust His blood can cleanse the soul
I trust His blood can save
His very name can make us whole
And save us from the grave


I trust He bore my shame
I trust the love He came to share
Remains today the same


Can save this wretch from hell
I trust Salvation’s true report
My Saviour had to tell


Although the devil’s out to harm
Though Satan’s he’s out to kill
I trust His righteous will


I trust in Heaven’s Door
I’ll trust Him evermore-I trust you father to provide
a path for me to walk, . 
and wisdom to ignore the fools, . 
let them laugh and let them talk
 
I trust you father to instill
a roadmap for my life
that steers me towards the rightous few
and spares me pain and strife
 
I trust you father to remind
me of my own free will, 
that pitfalls lie within my path, 
 that I must climb uphill
 
I trust you father to accept
that sometimes I grow weak, 
and thrist for waters of this world, 
and other love I'll seek
 
I trust you father to forgive
and when I die my soul will rise, 
and salvation I can claim
 
I trust you father


My emotions are the forming's of insanity, 
to numb the pain I resort to vanity, 
to stop me from thinking of the girl I ought to be, 
to try and make you see, 
the truth that is inside of me, 
and not the girl I try to be. . 

All my friends, 
use to listen to what I had to say, 
all my friends, 
would love me in a special way, 
all my friends, 
treasured all my great ideas, 
all my friends, 
would comfort me when I was sad, 
all my friends, 
were with me in 'those times'.

I use to be the Wolf.
The one who was the lead.
I use to be the Wolf.
The major need.
The one who helped.
The one who scowled.
The one who yelped.
I use to be the wolf.
But then I slowly faded.
I use to be the wolf.
But then my days degraded.
I use to be the wolf.
Then something had gone wrong.
I use to be the wolf.
Now everything I hate.


I use to be the wolf

Until the  'new girl' came.


Now no one listens.
Now no one cares.
Now no one
thinks, 
glares, 
stares, 
ponders, 
compliments, 
or decide on my ideas.

I'm just a follower, 
i'm lost in the days, 
I can't really think for what I have to say.
I can't really judge for what others had to pay.
I can't really go any farther than a save.

I'm just a follower, 
But I use to be the Wolf, 

oh how I miss those days. 

I used to think that love will never come
But now I have found it in a strange place

I used to want to be just like my older brother
But now I have relized I'm like him in ways but in others I'm me

I used to wish I was somebody else
But now I am confident with myself

I used to be really shy 
But now I'm boisterous 

I used to not know who I was ment to be
But now I know who I am, and who I am ment to be

I used to want everything
But now I have most things

I used to think guys were immature 
But now I know they are 

I used to think I was the boss
But now I know I'm ment to follow sometimes


I hope that you'll forgive me
For all the bad I've done
But when I needed loving
You always were the one


Said the suffering Beckford; 
To her Doctor so dread. 
'Oh! what shall I take for't?'

Said this Doctor so dread 
Whose name it was Newnham. 
'For this pain in your head 
Ah! What can you do Ma'am?'

Said Miss Beckford, 'Suppose 
If you think there's no risk, 
I take a good Dose 
Of calomel brisk.'--

'What a praise worthy Notion.' 
Replied Mr. Newnham. 
'You shall have such a potion 
And so will I too Ma'am.

'I've been working so hard you just wouldn't believe,
And I'm tired!
There's so little time and so much to achieve,
And I'm tired!
I've been lying here holding the grass in its place,
Pressing a leaf with the side of my face,
Tasting the apples to see if they're sweet,
Counting the toes on a centipede's feet.
I've been memorizing the shape of that cloud,
Warning the robins to not chirp so loud,
Shooing the butterflies off the tomatoes,
Keeping an eye out for floods and tornadoes.
I've been supervising the work of the ants
And thinking of pruning the cantaloupe plants,
Calling the fish to swim into my nets,
And I've taken twelve thousand and forty-one breaths,
And I'm TIRED

I sit in a mood of reverie.
I've brought to Art desires and sensations:
things half-glimpsed,
faces or lines, certain indistinct memories
of unfulfilled love affairs.
Let me submit to Art:

Art knows how to shape forms of Beauty,
almost imperceptibly completing life,
blending impressions, blending day with day. 

I've burned my own house down,
the torch is in my hand.
Now I'll burn down the house of anyone
who wants to follow me. 

I never thought my life could be
Anything but catastrophe
But suddenly I begin to see
A bit of good luck for me

'Cause I've got a golden ticket
I've got a golden twinkle in my eye

I never had a chance to shine
Never a happy song to sing
But suddenly half the world is mine
What an amazing thing

'Cause I've got a golden ticket
It's ours, Charlie
I've got a golden sun up in the sky

I never thought I'd see the day
When I would face the world and say
Good morning, look at the sun
I never thought that I would be
Slap in the lap of luxury'
Cause I'd have said it couldn't be done
But it can be done

I never dreamed that I would climb
Over the moon in ecstasy
But nevertheless, it's there that I'm
Shortly about to be

'Cause I've got a golden ticket
I've got a golden chance to make my way
And with a golden ticket, it's a golden day

Good morning, look at the sun'
Cause I'd have said it couldn't be done
But it can be done

I never dreamed that I would climb
Over the moon in ecstasy
But nevertheless, it's there that I'm
Shortly about to be

'Cause I've got a golden ticket'
Cause I've got a golden ticket
I've got a golden chance to make my way
And with a golden ticket, it's a golden day


I've seen the, "I’ve Got Your  commercials & I have to laugh, 
Military sexual assault victims are afraid of superior’s wrath, 
When over per year victims report this type of crime, 
It is a single digit % their assailants will do little if any time.

What about, "Pay Day Loan" companies who fleece via greed, 
Military families needing assistance while spouses are overseas? 
Then there are those mortgage brokers who hurriedly foreclose, 
When the U. 

S. Government has told them time and again, "No! "

And yet, Salem-News Editor In Chief, Tim King has to ride, 
The entire continental states because Uncle Sam will hide, 
Information regarding toxic waste stored on military grounds, 
U. 

S. Government’s responsibility for sicknesses going around.

However, close to  of Veterans health claims are denied, 
So if, "I’ve Got Your  works then arises the question, why? "
Same for PTSD battle fatigued claimant’s doctors will dismiss, 
Even where there’s crystal clear evidence trauma readily exists.

These incidents aren’t theory but fact in other words truth not lies, 
A reason for, "Awareness Missions" by Operation Red Dragonfly, 
How many military bases were knowingly filled with toxic waste? 
With all the evidence, why is the Military still trying to save face? 

What about La


Vena Johnson, Morganne Mc


Beth & Amy Tirador? 
Just a few of the tens of thousands you have never heard before, 
I get it, " means the number of feet buried, covered with dirt, 
Well, one good thing about being deceased, it will no longer hurt.

A motorcycle ride across the U. 

S. called, "Operation Red Dragonfly, "
It takes a seasoned veteran to assail the lonely trek and find out why, 
Long after covered-up deplorable conditions surfaced at Walter Reed, 
Hospital just a couple miles from the White House, yet there’s a need.

A need for honesty from our government to attack problems head on, 
When soldiers are rushed into battle, treatment shouldn’t take so long, 
As fast as outdated weapons & technology are shipped to battle lines, 
Attacking problems should be more prevalent than enemy left behind. 

I’ve Got Your commercials are nothing more than Operation Dr. Spin, 
It’s an attempt to put a lid on inadequate care before Americans begin, 
To realize the plight that most enlisted personnel will face, but when? 
To the U. 

S. Government soldiers are simply throwaway cheap hit men.

Highly recognized celebrities versus a one man traveling show, 
Is it possible these mega-stars the truth they really don’t know? 
Or has the dollar amount clouded their reception hiding the fact? 
U. 

S. Government is lying when they say, "I’ve Got Your Back? " 

Veterans Vic Pittman, Jon Daggett, Jamal Belica have added a lick, 
Why use movie & TV celebrates in their spots for, I’ve Got Your  
Simply a smoke screen because if the program was actually for real, 
U. 

S. Government would not go that route to make it such a big deal.

Maybe Uncle Sam is getting into the comedy business, they are funny, 
Every year they loose billions of dollars but it’s only taxpayer’s money, 
Our current president is more openly concerned with the rights of gays, 
And thinking like General Mac


Arthur today’s soldiers will just fade away. 

I’ve had it up to here with politicians
I’ve had it up to here with all their spin
They lead to more dead-ends than most morticians
Their promises bring nothing but chagrin

I’ve had it up to here with movie goers
Who yap and yap throughout the movie show
Uncaring, inconsiderate bull throwers
Who loudly act so noisily gung-ho

I’ve had it up to here with racial bigots
Those hate-filled folk, so certain they’re supreme
The flow of hate pours out their odious spigots
I’ve had it up to here with bigots who demean

Though I’m neither perfect or unflawed
I’ve had it up to here with those less so
I find it easy never to applaud
All those others who are never apropos


I’ve heard the rushing of mountain torrents, gushing
Down through the rocks, in a cataract of spray,
Onward to the ocean;
Swift seemed their motion,
Till, lost in the desert, they dwindled away.

I’ve learnt the story of all human glory,
I’ve felt high resolves growing weaker every day,
Till cares, springing round me,
With creeping tendrils bound me,
And all I once hoped for was wearing fast away.

I’ve seen the river rolling on for ever,
Silent and strong, without tumult or display.
In the desert arid,
Its waters never tarried,
Till far out at sea we still found them on their way.

Now no more weary we faint in deserts dreary,
Toiling alone till the closing of the day;
All now is righted,
Our souls flow on united,
Till the years and their sorrows have all died away. 

I've learned that no matter how much I want someone
I have to let the decision be theirs
I have to let them come to me
Not force them to be with me

I want someone to be with me because they want to
Not because I threatened, cajoled and cried
Not because I begged and pleaded
But because it was left up to them and they decided

I've learned that no matter how much I love someone
It does not mean that they will automatically love me back
My love cannot make them feel the same way
My thoughts and emotions are not theirs

I've learned that no matter how much someone loves me
It does not mean that I will love them too
Their love cannot built a love within me
Their thougths and emotions are not mine

I cannot pretend to love when I don't
It is not fair on them and it is not fair on me
The pretence eventually becomes too hard
And both parties get hurt

I've learned to be honest and not scared
If I'm honest it reduces the hurt for both of us
The other person can move on without me
Or I can move on without them

In the end, I've learned that only if I'm true
To myself, to my heart and to others
Only then is there a chance of happiness
Only then is there a chance of finding love


Delicate you are, 
Fragile-agile roses! 
Thou art Boldness; 
Angels on earth you must be.
Praising you, I praise He.
 
‘Thorn bleeding  laugh'
Spaced into the beautiful eyes
Of many-many  wise, 
All must observe, I pray, 
If, not yet you observed, 

I told you dear, in brief, 
My brethren, Seeing them; 
I've learnt to laugh in grief. 

I’ve lived to see desire vanish,
With hope I’ve slowly come to part,
And I am left with only anguish,
The fruit of emptiness at heart.

Under the storms of merciless fate,
My worn and withered garland lies--
In sadness, lonesome, I await:
How far away is my demise?

Thus, conquered by a tardy frost,
Through gale’s whistling and shimmer,
Late, on a naked limb exposed
A lonesome leaf is left to quiver!.  

I've looked on beauty so much
that my vision overflows with it.
The body's lines. Red lips. Sensual limbs.
Hair as though stolen from Greek statues,
always lovely, even uncombed,
and falling slightly over pale foreheads.
. . . . in the nights when I was young,
encountered secretly in my nights. 

Do you feel sorry for men at war
it is a fact none can ignore
but you'll have to excuse my apathy
my total dismissal of your melancholy
for your sadness to me is a sadness without reason
for sadness of a death chosen is a grief in a wrong season
I infact have empathy with neonate and geriatric
the pain thrust upon the innocent
for war is the childhood-brat-grownup's way
of fighting and tantrum with rifle and bomb
the fight for earth and land
that does not belong 
to anyone.  
so no I do not feel sad
I do not feel sorry
for fighting for a country
signed at your own consent
is joining just a higher form of street gang
peace peace is what all want
peace is not something won by physical battle. 
so if to you I seem nonchalant
I am but just of opinion
that men at war are foolish toddlers
fighting for a toy
with human blood on their hands
blood of the innocent
I do not feel sorry for men at war. 

The sweet juices of your mouth
are like castles bathed in honey.
I've never had it done so gently before.
You have put a circle of castles
around my penis and you swirl them
like sunlight on the wings of birds. 

Being worm-eaten, ceaseless.  still
Giggling all the apples, one after another
Those green, rosy, red __

And gloomy, darkened clouds
Flying, flying, flying and flying away. 

What a sign of inauspicious days! 



People run after light and hope, always__
Keep it up more and more but jerks off less; 

Yet, keep up an eye, where there is darkness

I vex me not with brooding on the years 
That were ere I drew breath; why should I then 
Distrust the darkness that may fall again 
When life is done? Perchance in other spheres-- 
Dead planets--I once tasted mortal tears, 
And walked as now among a throng of men, 
Pondering things that lay beyond my ken, 
Questioning death, and solacing my fears. 
Offtimes indeed strange sense I have of this, 
Vague memories that hold me with a spell, 
Touches of unseen lips upon my brow, 
Breathing some incommunicable bliss! 
In years foregone, O soul, was all not well? 
Still lovelier life awaits thee. Fear not thou

I vow in my life
to serve the mankind
to establish fraternity
and a peaceful delight

I vow in my life
to make the Human being
a prosperous and a bright future

I vow in my life
for salvation of natural harmony

I vow in my life
to be a nice citizen
and discharge my duty
as assigned to me for universal kind. 

I wait for you. The years in silence pass 
And as the image, one, I wait for you again. 

The distance is in flame -- and clear one as  glass, 
I, silent, wait -- with sadness, love and pain. 

The distance is in flame, and you are coming fast, 
But I'm afraid that you will change your image yet, 

And will initiate the challenging mistrust 
By changing features, used, at long awaited end. 

Oh, how I will fell -- so low and so pine, 
Unable to overcome my dreams' continued set! 

The distance is such bright! And azure is so fine! 
But I'm afraid that you will change your image yet. 

I was like a withered flower in a barren desert, 
till I breathed your smile that brought life to my heart.

I was like a homeless child looking for a shelter.
till you got me in your heart, awh nothing is much better.

When I saw you, I felt my heart flying freely in the sky.
I said ' Angels don't exist, could she be a butterfly? ! '.
I waited a long time for the one who will wipe tears stuck in my eyes.
Then I met you, and to my lifelong loneliness said 'Good-bye'.

You taught me how to live, how to love, how to sacrifice.
Till you came into my life, my world turned to a paradise.

I wrote our story on the walls of my heart, to tell it to our children, 
to teach them what true love is, and let our souls rest in Heaven. 

I wake and feel the fell of dark, not day,
   What hours, O what black hours we have spent
   This night! what sights you, heart, saw; ways you went!
 And more must, in yet longer light's delay.
 With witness I speak this. But where I say
   Hours I mean years, mean life. And my lament
   Is cries countless, cries like dead letters sent
 To dearest him that lives alas! away.

 Bitter would have me taste: my taste was me;
   Bones built in me, flesh filled, blood brimmed the curse.
 Selfyeast of spirit a dull dough sours. I see
   The lost are like this, and their scourge to be
 As I am mine, their sweating selves; but worse. 

You throw your words, 
expecting me to fall.
You throw your knives, 
but I walk on.

You fight, 
ignite, 
and hurt me sore, 
but I walk on.

You burn down, 
everything
that we have found, 
but I walk on.

You rally my fears, 
my enemies, 
for the torment of me, 
but I walk on.

You can try to stop me, 
but you'll die trying.
No matter what, 
I won't stop walking on. 

I WALK AROUND THE BLOCK 

When I am anxious 
Or bored
Or feel the need to move 
When I want to get for a short time
From the darkness within
To the light outside
I walk around the block-

Just now I started out in the shade
Hoping at last the cool weather had come
But the last stretch to home
One long block in the afternoon sun-

I made it around 
I feel somewhat better
A walk of exercise 
In slightly unpleasant weather. 

I walk as slowly as I can
I look around and see more Beauty
Than I can possibly describe
I sing to myself in joy

I may be an old man but I have the spirit of youth within me
Joy is so easy for me now 
I just walk and look and sing and am happy
An old man 
Young at heart.



I walk down the hill of my own loneliness
It is a sad hill 
It is a long hill 
But it is my hill. 

I walk down the road toward another poem-
It will come before the road ends-
It is coming now
Surrounded as it often is by morning light-
 
I have made many poems in my life-
This is another one-
The one I am writing now-
Having stopped in the middle of the road
Before I get home. 

I WALK DOWN THIS ROAD OF BEAUTY 

 I walk down this road of Beauty- 
Its colors sing inside my mind-  

I have a happy life
When I go to pray each morning. 

I walk down this road of Beauty
And I am happy inside. 

I WALK HOME AFTER A MORNING OF CAREGIVING WORK 

I walk home after a morning of caregiving work
Duty done
Free
A sudden happiness overwhelms me
It is a feeling I had fifty years ago
Finishing all my university exams 
Release relief overwhelming joy 
The sky has never been more open
The trees and flowers never more beautifully greens and yellows
Free at last 
Free at last 
Free at last. 

I walk in pain now
Each step hurts
The pleasure of walking is gone
One of the great pleasures of my life
But I need to walk
To keep going
If I stop my lungs my heart will decline
I walk in pain now
I still have to walk 
A long time each day
One of my great pleasures is gone for now
I pray for the day
When I will walk without pain again


But it is morning for me
Blackness is everywhere 
But it makes the few stars brighter
The road ahead is a small circle to home
And I am wholly alone with the world
All of it is mine 
If I want it 
But the joy is in the feeling of my painless flexible limbs
And the briskness and freshness of the air

How I love being alive now
That at my age 
I can still walk with swiftness and ease
As if none of the disease growing silently within me
Will ever get me
And this kind of walk
Will be given to me
Forever. 

I walk in the morning light 
Peace in my heart 
Calm in my soul-

But I have so many problems 
Major worries-
Why now ‘Peace? ’

Morning light is only
For a certain time of day
It will go away soon
And the world will enter, 
And then I can be troubled
And think and think again-

Now just for now 
Let me be Quiet. 

I WALK IN THE QUIET PLACES

I walk in the quiet places 
Where I can hear myself think-
I love the beauty of the silence
And the pleasure of just seeing things-

To be able to walk
To be able to look and see
Is such a big thing -
I know so many no longer capable of this-

I walk and think and pray for them also. 

I WALK IN THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT’S CALM 

I walk in the silence of the night’s calm
Nothing disturbs me- 
The light wind makes me feel more alive 
I am overwhelmed by a sudden great happiness-
Why after so many years 
I walk in joy and gratitude 
So many years 
And I am still alive. 

I WALK ON HAMELECH GEORGE ST. IN THE MORNING LIGHT 


I walk on Ha


Melech George Street in the morning light- 
Worlds open up-
I remember walking here often many years ago-
Vague longing and regret mix with pleasure 
In my mind- 
Soon I may never walk here again. 

There is so much in Life to love and enjoy -
Soon there may be no more of it for me. 

A regret at my own life-
That I have not lived enough-
And that it will go
As all things go –

Yet there is pleasure 
In simply being alive  
In the fullness of feeling 
Inside 
I cannot describe- 

There is so much in Life to Love and Enjoy. 

I WALK OUT INTO THE DARKNESS OF ANOTHER DAY 

I walk out into the darkness of another day-
Even the light cannot save me-

Too much sinking -
Too much already done 
Which cannot be undone.

My life has passed me by. 

Writing this 
Trying to make a poem- 
Will it get me out of it again? 


I walk out into the night 
Away from the noise-
Away from everything from everyone- 
I hear the silence-
I am calm- 
I walk and walk and walk
Into the night- 
And into my own silence and calm-
And in this quiet, 
In this peace, 
I hear these words 
And write them down. 

I walked a Tamil street
Inebriate
On an October evening
When a cloud hesitated overhead
Unable to rain
Lost in thoughts

The North East monsoon is playing hide and seek
The weather bureau said
What could they say
About a thing unknown? 
When forecasts go wrong
There are excuses numberless
That shelter and comfort
The evenings swelter

A lonely star, perhaps Sirius
Or Betelgeuse
From behind the clouds
Looked down on the street
Where two buxom beauties
Rushed on a scooter
Loaded with jasmine on their heads
To unknown beds
Infested with bugs
To share carnal pleasures
With their sweating boyfriends

A barking stray dog
His eyes wary
Sought friendship
Of everyone on the street
Wagging his tail

Men and women
Walked up and down
As in a dream
Oh, how humans could be
So somnambulist
In so much physical discomfort! 

That is life
When ignorance drives
Why should men be any wise? 
An unwanted demand
Of those who think themselves high

May I therefore seek
My bed of bugs
Somewhere here
Comforted by a solitary breeze
This October night
Watched by lonely stars
With friendly barks
Jasmine, sweat, beauties
Life needless to say
Is always beautiful
Who cares here to breathe the last
Unless that is thrust upon

I walked in a desert. 
And I cried, 
A voice said, "It is no desert
 

I cried, "Well, But -- 
The sand, the heat, the vacant horizon
 

A voice said, "It is no desert

"I took my morning stroll in the drizzle
Up and down in Tucson
An umbrella resting on my shoulder
Between a grandma mesquite
Hunchback, her trunk and branches
Badly lacerated through years and years
Of exploitation by inhuman humans
And a conifer pine
Thrusting his head into the empty sky
In deep meditation in a philosophical high

The mesquite was senile
Dilapidated infirm
Asthmatic in the rain
The pine a scholar
Base fulsome
Head tapering into the void

I walked my old age path 
As the mountains looked down veiled
Like Arabian dames
Between the two
In that unceasing spray of rain
Reminiscing my teenage walks
Of miles and miles
In the drizzle
Just to spot a pair of eyes
Flash, mascara-lined 
Behind a window curtain
Or watch a river in abandon
After night-long heavy rains

Teenage infatuations
They were
Sweet to reminisce
On this morn of incessant drizzle
An umbrella resting on my shoulder
Bones in sweet pain and languor 
May I
Again look for those beautiful eyes
Behind a curtain
Or savour the fulsomeness
Of a youthful river in spate
Its course now bone-dry


I walked out one evening, , 
as the sun was setting low.
Trees were whispering in the breeze, 
as it yielded a gentle blow.
Skies transformed to reddish hues, 
as my feet crossed o’er the ground, 
Then along the path by the brook, 
dead leaves lay scattered all around, 
Birdsong filled the loud silence,  
one last song, for twilight creeps.
The sun has set behind the trees, 
as the darkness its vigil keeps.

I walked out one evening, 
observing such beauty spread.
To experience the colours, 
orange and gold so finely wed.
The music of the water, 
as it trickled down the stream.
Such peacefulness, silent, calming, 
a perfect floating  tranquil dream.
Now as the day is ending, 
such visions assail the eyes, 
One royal sky ‘s magnificent, 
enhanced by the night’s fireflies. 

I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
	                        

	                        
	                          .  
	                        

	                        
	                          .  


That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils; 
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed- and gazed- but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude; 
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils. 

i wandered there a little man.
along that broad causeway.
and every hand that pulled him up.
the other slides away.
his arm is hard to grab and hold, 
while currants turns around.
i wandered there a little man.
she shows him out the other side. 

What if the sun said ' Sorry, I'm not coming today '? ! 
What if the earth loved the moon, and couldn't even say? ! 

What if our glowing sky wasn't true? ! 
What if my beautiful life was without you? ! 

I wanna be there, do all what I can, only for you! 
I wanna be there, because I can't dream without you! 
I wanna be there, because you're the one who can make my life glows! 
I wanna be there, just because I do love you! ! 

Now! I'm on the summit of the mountain saying to my lifelong pain ' Good bye! '.
playing with the glowing stars, flying freely in the sky.
That's because I said what was stuck in my heart, I was about to die.
So I put the start of our story, and let my birds to fly. 

I want you
I want to walk with you
I want to talk
I want to talk to you
My heart wants
My heart wants your heart.

Will you walk 
Will you walk with me
Will you talk 
Will you talk to me
Your heart wants
Your heart wants my heart.

When all is set
Why you wanna leave
My lady you are mine
My dear am always yours. 

I want to wear twin-sets
With pearls and beige slacks
I want to do lunch
At a place named 'Chez Jaques'

I want to talk with
A plum in my mouth
And have a large property
By the sea, down South

I want to have servants
And a lady-in-waiting
To get me dressed up
For all my posh dating

I want to date ladies
in large-brimmed hats
Who only eat lean
Never touching the fats

I want to drink tonic
With a small splash of gin
With ice and a lemon 
Stuck onto the rim

I want to meet ladies
That fully-groom
And instead of the toilet
Use the powder-room


And all this
I'd like to do today
Then go back 
To my slovenly way

How do I get rid of you
you harass me, 
You torture me, 
you scare me.

You come in my dreams
you make me cry, 
Though I run away from you
you keep following me.

You give me a bad day
you spoil all the fun, 
You are like a trigger 
shot from a gun.

I want to get rid of you
'The Negative Thoughts' Yes, that's you, 
You are ruining my life in a big way
And am shrinking because of you day by day.

I know after reading this
My friends will say Meditate, Pray, 
Strike it off with a positive thought
That's the Art of Living people say.

All this gives solace only for a while
And then this demon again reappears 
How do I get rid of it
When it keeps on giving me tremors

Touch me, feel me, taste me
Take me in your arms
Let me do the same for you
Abandon yourself to my charms

I want to feel your body against mine
I want to taste you
Appreciate what we have
The minutes are too few

Soon it will be over
You will be gone
Memories will remain
And we will move on

For now, we create the memories
We dance the dance of lust
In time reality will intrude
And we will do what we must

Let us be young, ageless, timeless
Let us enjoy what we feel
Later there be the time
Enough to be real


I WANT
I want His Fire to burn
I want to join the faithful bride
And from The Master learn

I want my eyes The truth to see
And see that life is mine

I want true faith to make me strong
Humility to reign
And really born again

So much the world to share
Plant righteous seed where ere I go
And show how much I care

I want to serve Him well
I want to live and never die
And save the lost from hell

I want to sow Salvations seed
I want so much to give
I want to meet my neighbour’s need
I want to see them live

I want to see the devil fall
I want to hear my Saviour call
And join Him in the cloud   

To enter Heaven’s Door
And when I dwell The Promised Land
I want to want no more


I want a night
To spend with you
I want a night 
To love you through

I want a night
With you next to me
I want a night
For us to see

I want a night
To make love
I want a night under
The stars above

I want a night
So you can see
That I want you always
Next to me

I want a night
That never ends
I want a night
That transcends

I want a night
Filled with love
I want a night
That loves made of

Warm and tender to hold
I want her by my side
As the years make me grow old

I want to live my life
Sharing it with her
I always want to be the one
To see her gentle smile

I want her to be the one
To hold me when I cry
I want her to be the one
To wipe my tears all dry

I want her to be the one
Who sleeps with me at night
I want her to be the one
I see in the early morning light

I want her to be the one
To never let me go
I know that she is the one
Who’ll always love me so



I want my geese to lay gold eggs for easter
At least a hundred a day
And by the way

I want a feast
I want a bean feast
Cream buns and doughnuts
And fruitcake with no nuts
So good you could go nuts

No, now

I want a ball
I want a party
Pink macaroons
And a million balloons
And performing baboons and
Give it to me now

I want the world
I want the whole world
I want to lock it
All up in my pocket
It's my bar of chocolate
Give it to me now

I want today
I want tomorrow
I want to wear 'em
Like braids in my hair and
I don't want to share 'em

I want a party with roomfuls of laughter
Ten thousand tons of ice cream
And if I don't get the things I am after
I'm going to scream

I want the works
I want the whole works
Presents and prizes
And sweets and surprises
Of all shapes and sizes

And now

Don't care how, I want it now
Don't care how, I want it now"I want"—it pleaded—All its life—
I want—was chief it said
When Skill entreated it—the last—
And when so newly dead—

I could not deem it late—to hear
That single—steadfast sigh—
The lips had placed as with a "Please"
Toward Eternity—I want my freedom back, 
This can't be right, 
I'm a democrat! 

I was supportive of human and civil rights, 
I always thought that the government would take care of me, 
Cradle to grave, 
Yes sir re! 

Now, as I get older, 
I can truly see, 
Freedom for some gives us less liberty, 
I guess I traded in freedom from decisions, 
For government dependency. 
As a rule I thought I was getting a deal, 
Now they aren't through! 

The government controls every phase of my life, 
How much get for unemployment, 
Food Stamps, 
And what I pay in rent. 

My solution to this problem 
Is as simple as can be, 
Do as I did, 
But do as I should have done, 
Save, 
Invest, 
Put back into our great land, 
Travel, Talk, get out and walk, 
Meet your neighbors, 
But most of all ask questions, 
When it comes to the selection 
Of people who represent us, 
Don't vote for the promises of an election, 
Vote instead for self-development, 
Vote to restore or land to the home of the free 
Once again. 

Free from government, 
Free from fear, 
Free from big brother's ear, 
Because if we don't 
It won't be a country anymore, 
It would be just one big joke

I am a great lover of nature
Of its myriad forms, its hues and shades
I have preserved, 
In the folder  of my cognitive files 
Superscribed with my heart’s emotional bytes
(Among other things) 
Quite a good number of 
Sunsets and sunrises
Strung together in the timeline of my life
They supply me the much needed oxygen
When I feel drained
And asphyxiated 
During my run up to safety
battling for my own space
In the charming valley of 
This pristine nature


In the divine light
I want to bathe.
I am sick.
I pray and I will be healed today.

Pray in faith and you will be healed.
my mummy told me when I was a child.

All those memories enkindled in me
I began to pray like a little child.

My mummy died.
She had cancer.
I am alone here.

But she sees me when I stand in light
and pray with folded hands.
One day I will also join them
in the world of the angels with white robes
and shining silver wings. 

I want to be a fog, dark, gray, 
Billowing like smoke from a large bonfire.
Blocking sights from being spotted.
Stopping the sun from rising in the morning.
The largest of light reflects off you.
The smallest, however, cuts through.
Be a shapeless, odorless cloud of vapor.
I want to be a fog. 

A voice crying in the wilderness
Prepare yourself with 
humble prayers and offerings".

Replenished with the food 
of spiritual nourishment
I humbly beseech you
I want to be a part of your mystery.

Hold me firm to things of heaven.
Protect me in your mercy.
Lift up my soul  to you.

I have trusted you
I have set my hope in you.
Do not leave me alone. 

Don't want to meet you in group, 
Don't want to meet you alone.

Don't want you in my dreams, 
Don't want you in my thoughts.

Don't want you in my tears, 
Don't want you in my smile.

Don't want you to be reason of my life, 
Don't want you to be reason of my death.

Don't want to be a superman in your love, 
Don't want to be Dev


D in your pain.

Don't want to be someone special, 
Don't want to be someone's special.

Don't want to invest for handkerchiefs, 
Don't want to become poorer at this recession time.

Don't want to be an unclaimed article at public place, 
Don't want to explode into tears when touched by you.

I saw beyond what I can see in the mirror, 
saw the image what you can see in the mirror.

Go away, go away from my inspiration, 
Don't want to become a poet.

All I want is to be Alone. 

And a good man says, 
around I will be, promises made.
Modest as in song, blue birds sing.
Into each day, dawn will bring.
No good few have said, coming back.
In our youth things we want having had.
Up is down from the time I've had, I am here.
You are me I will play, play I will from a child.
Do you see what it is that I have become? 
What you had I now have I give up.
Simple things that I see we now have. 

I want to be lost
out of the bewildered world
loosing all my existance
loosing all my ponerology
where i can insist upon
divine solitude
the fragrance of which
may  ascend all corners of life
be not tangled with fewtrils

I may assume the universal vaccume
where lot of space is provided
will not argue for needle surface
a lot of soul  may be accomodated

wih deepest  exult of soul


Heavenly cursed and heavily sinned I
No more i like to add them, so, I want to die
And I want to become a holy ghost
Whom the people would like the most.
Like the retreating soldiers I like to come back
To my own permanent and eternal home 
You may call it a suicide or martyrdom.

In my real home I see the news
Coming from the lipstick coated lips 
In the television of my molten death 
People are sobbing with a heavy breath. 
The atmosphere is heavy and they feel the pain
This thrills me and gives a feeling of gain.


The only son of my father
The only darling of my mother
Fainted repeatedly on the cushion 
Peal like tear drops coming from my beloved son, 
Friends and relatives express grief in the community hall, 
All these excite  me and I sought to say'' I love you all.''

For the first time in my life in my last ritual I listen 
From those men that  I was really  a very very  good man.
In such intense atmosphere of gloom and sad 
My heart cheers and I become too much glad.

I 
want to die before you. 
Do you think that who passes later 
will find who's gone before? 
I don't think so. 
You'd better have me burned, 
and put me on the stove in your room 
in a jar. 
The jar shall be made of glass, 
transparent, white glass 
so that you can see me inside.  
You see my sacrifice: 
I renounced from being part of the earth, 
I renounced from being a flower 
to be able to stay with you. 
And I am becoming dust, 
to live with you. 
Later, when you also die, 
you'll come to my jar. 
And we'll live there together 
your ash in my ash, 
until a careless bride 
or an unfaithful grandson 
throws us out of there.  
But we 
until that time 
will mix 
with each other 
so much that 
even in the garbage we are thrown into 
our grains will fall side by side. 
We will dive into the soil together. 
And one day, if a wild flower 
feeds from this piece of soil and blossoms 
above its body, definitely 
there will be two flowers: 
one is you 
one is me. 
I 
don't think of death yet. 
I will give birth to a child. 
Life is flooding from me. 
My blood is boiling. 
I will live, but long, very long, 
but with you. 
Death doesn't scare me either. 
But I find our way of funeral 
rather unlikable. 
Until I die, 
I think this will get better. 
Is there a hope you'll get out of prison these days? 
A voice in me says: 
maybe. 

All night the army came up from Gilgal
To get to the killing field, and that's all.
In the ground, warf and woof, lay the dead.
I want to die in My own bed.
Like slits in a tank, their eyes were uncanny,
I'm always the few and they are the many.
I must answer. They can interrogate My head.
But I want to die in My own bed.

The sun stood still in Gibeon. Forever so, it's willing
to illuminate those waging battle and killing.
I may not see My wife when her blood is shed,
But I want to die in My own bed.

Samson, his strength in his long black hair,
My hair they sheared when they made me a hero
Perforce, and taught me to charge ahead.
I want to die in My own bed.

I saw you could live and furnish with grace
Even a lion's den, if you've no other place.
I don't even mind to die alone, to be dead,
But I want to die in My own bed.




I want to distribute my happiness
With poetry and with poets, but
The poets are not interested at all 
Any pleasure moment and told me, 
Go there please and leave us here
Where we are with sorrows of poetry, 
But I find poetry is no way
Related or concerned with anything
So-called pleasure and pain.
I told all I want nothing and yet
They are not taking interest and
Not in a position to believe me.
What to say to my own self, but
It is there in me and in deep sleep. 

I want to distribute myself, 
Of course in cheap, no bargain.
If any one is interested, then
I am willing to offer free of cost, 
But I see, no one is interested to
Take me with him, reason is that
I am writing poems and  to take
Me, would be a burden to them.
They think, I am useless and
Whatever I am, I shall continue
To be, I said to them and they
Listen me carefully and uttered
Okay then let us test this man, no harm

I want to do
I want to do something
Something that have a relation
With You, my dear.
And I know everything
Is related to You, 
And I know nothing is here
Without You.

Let me say, my dear, 
As long as You love me
And You like my writing
I am here, as I know
This area is Yours and I am
Here just to tell about You. 

Give me inner comfort and peace.

I want to follow my bliss

Help me to find the barriers 
within myself, psychological
which I built against me.

By being myself and loving myself
i am putting something wonderful
in the world that was not there before.


I pray
You yourself come
And show me the way
I have to take.


I want to go with the one I love.
I do not want to calculate the cost.
I do not want to think about whether it's good.
I do not want to know whether he loves me.
I want to go with whom I love. 


I want to kiss that girls lips; 
and she knows I hold her view.
She watches my eyes grow bold, 
she sees my eye and smiles.
I pay to much attention as she watches 
her fingers dance the curves are so.
I get lost in the glow of the glossy they are
strawberry fields full of red blush today.
They dance apart, with nothing better to do.
I put my dark sun glasses on. 
smiling lips now.  

she does to. 

I hated it 
I studied it
The very depth of it
Still, I fell in it
I want to know why? 

I have criticized it
I have commented it
I never liked it
Yet, I have experienced it
I want to know why? 

I used to condemn it
I always discouraged it
Yet, I fell and experienced it
I never knew and think will never know
But I want to know why

the resonance of pitiful voice of Nirbhaya
challenging the humanity, 
 defeated the humanity, could not be survived

She was born on the land
where Sita was kidnapped
yet she suffered revilement of society

from being her nude
yet she was made an impignoration
that crushed the humanity

She was born on the same land
where woman is worshiped 
yet she became victim 
of the paralyzed society

Nirbhaya! 
I feel the panic strive
to console your family
yet a question is left ever
the existence of Human society? 
where system is engaged
in money making job
planning for an insinuation.

Nirbhaya! ! 

You got the supreme abode
from where there is no return
but your words, ' I want to live '
has become the voice of entire female

Humanity is at stake 
crying for its survival

Contd.

I know my journey is coming to an end
Sleep has encamped in my eyes, and
Dark's tranquil resonance 
Can be heard from very close, but
I don't want to sleep now.
Muse, stay on with me for some more time
Talk to me.
Don't leave me alone
I want to see the morn of this night, and 
Like birds
I want to rise with you! 



I want to believe I don't just take up space
I want to know that who they see is not a random face
I want to know I have a purpose
I want to show there is more to me than what is on the surface
I want to believe I am the best me there is
I want to make all the difference

I want to know my voice is valid
I want to think my opinions mattered
I want to believe my thoughts are unique
I want to know they hear me when I speak
I want to know my quirks are mine
I want to believe my ways are refined

I want to believe in my reflection
I want to love my imperfections
I want to see the beauty inside and out
I want to put away all of my doubt
I want to see myself and smile
I want to love myself awhile

I want to know myself I can count on
I want to believe my heart is strong
I want my confidence to shine through
I want to trust my judgement true
I want no more second guessing 
I want no more constant pretending

I want to be happy for I am me
I want to rejoice in what I always will be
I want to want myself
I want no score or test
I want to love myself forever
I want to know anything I can weather

I need the love I know I can give
I need to know myself I can forgive
I need the sparkle back in my eyes
I need to know myself I am satisfiedi want too die a simple death; 
and when i look so very deep
within your eyes i die again.
But even as you labor and i labor
like once you did so long ago.
i know that in my long illness
i have become fatter and some 
what greater in tumescence 
and you know it always and
how it comes with age and thus, 
and do we reminisce of this and that.
and with each gentle squeeze and  
as you watch me, 
now so yellow off white, i jerk
and jerk then i convulse again 
and still you squeeze
untill you are absolutely sure 
that i am still at rest i am and 
i dont want too die like this
would you, allow it too be
if it were you, held off defiant, 
while your hands each bring 
me back from the ledge, 
each time too face my fate
and you now know with 
each suprised look 
that shoots
so high and wide
across your face 
and with each bright sun
drawn out warm
and a stream of squirts
and it grows so much harder 
for you too watch, 
whats
left of my life
as it ebbs and flows, 
and rushes 
towards 
that off holds on
yellow and white 
bright light of dawn
and bury me 
next to my friend

cummings. 

i want too die a simple death; 
still i can not but tell..

bright light..
and finaly when it dawns.

just what it is I have become.  

I want to change the way I think
Have thoughts as white as snow
And in His love to grow 


I want to be with Heaven right
Eternally in view


I want to live as Heaven’s planned
I want no more to stray
Throughout the youngest day


I want to know my Saviour more
To run and win life’s race
No longer break a single law
And see my Father’s face


I want to love those full of hate
The lost in darkest sin
I want their thoughts so elevate 


I want the world as free as me
With heart and soul aflame
The proudest fool on bended knee


I want to love my neighbour more
My friends no longer lost
I want to enter Heaven's Door
Regardless of the cost


Be grafted firm within The Vine 
Where all my wants will end


Even if it wasn't what I wanted.
Even if it was what you thought.
On the bar stool in the corner where I sat.
Wearing what I wore why I wear it every night.
And the dress that you have on is always why.
There where it parted.
It only takes one drink sometimes maybe two.
Even if it wasn't what I thought you somehow knew. 

I WANTED TO PRAY SO THAT OBVIOUSLY MY DESTINY.
I WANTED TO PRAY SO THAT MY HEART IS ALWAYS FRESH.
I WANTED TO PRAY SO THAT THE SUCCES IN MY LIFE.

I PRAYED BECAUSE I'WANTED TO HEAD THE HEAVEN ROAD.
I PRAYED BECAUSE I'WANTED TO AVOID HELL.
I PRAYED FOR THE BEST FROM THE WORLD TOWARDS HEAVEN.

I PRAYED BECAUSE I'BELIEVED.
I PRAYED BEFORE MY DEATH COME.
I PRAYED FOR ALL PEACEFULNESS IN MY LIFE.

CONSIDERING THE LIFE AND DIED I'WAS IN HIS HANDS.

I PRAYED TO AVOID THE DEJECTED FEELING.
I PRAYED TO AVOID THE FEELING OF THE SADNESS.
I PRAYED SO THAT I'NEVER FELL IN THE LIFE CHASM.

I PRAYED AND PRAYED.

THE PRAYER WAS THE LOVE.
THE PRAYER WAS THE HEART.
THE PRAYER WAS THE LIFE.
THE PRAYER WAS THE LIFE BREATH.

WHEN YOU BEGAN YOUR PRAYER? ? 

I was going to cut some flowers, 
But you never showed.

I was thinking of shorter hair, 
But now, I think I'll let it grow.

I was thinking about the days, 
We had so very long ago.

I was thinking of the love we had, 
I was just thinking, don't ya know? 

I was praying for a better world, 
Of a peace beyond compare.

So that all mankind could share.

I was going to cut some flowers', 
But you never came.

I think I'll cut them anyway, 
I'll cut them just the same

Love, such a fragile thing 
It breaks and fractures into pain
I don’t want to hurt anyone 
You are the loves of my life 

One prince and two kingdoms
He can only claim one princess
Love cannot guide me now
My mind blurred

Emotions are all astray and disarrayed 
My path not grounded into stone
My head is shattered like broken glass
And my heart is broke right down the center

Who am I? 
Who are we? 
Where will this take me

It took time for me.
It took me years 
to know you.

I was so entangled in 
material ways and thoughts.

I was a slave of this world.
All that was mundane attracted me.
I ran after and fell deep in mud.

I came to know you.

It took time for me 
to know you and love you. 

I was always yours
lost, adrift so long at sea, 
holding on, 'dear for all to see.

Held apart, for I to long
each last painful breath, 
was yours too take.
I having, 'no picture left of you.

Was I, 
when you tell me, ever wrong 
to sing that song, again. 

My scholar friend keeps his late Grandma's diary
And a certain page was highlighted in the color of yellow.
My old ferryman you never realized that how I deeply loved you? 
Since in the cradle the word 'depth' I heard several occasions from my parents.
They always talk about the mysterious river's depth.
But I am grown up now and I understand the nagging life is more deeper than the river.
A hidden alligator in the river takes a soul away once in a way
And you disappeared without saying me Goodbye! 
I murmur your everlasting song while sitting on my sick bed.
'This old vehicle stops at all railroad crossings
As I am really scared of painful death.'



I was born in the right time, in whole,
Only this time is one that is blessed,
Live without deceit on this earth.

And therefore, it's dark in my house,
And therefore, all of my friends,
Like sad birds, in the evening aroused,
Sing of love, that was never on land. 

I was called to serve, , , 
In a place where future is vague, , 
To give hope and love they need, 
Have mercy with us, my, plead.

I was called to heal the wounds, 
The cry of every heart that hurts, 
Bound with injustice and grievances, 
Root s of human destructions.

I was called for a simple prayer, 
An earnest supplication for everyone, 
To ask help from the almighty one, 

I was called to live again, 
To restore the broken spirit of thee, 
The second chance of life with HIM. 

I had my dinner and
Slept around of night
After a couple hour or so
I found myself dead
Ya, I was dead
My body had become motionless
Eyes shut, hands erect
What about my dreams and aims
All gone, all shattered
Man, I was dead
What next? 
Possibly burn, bury and ashes
Suddenly I heard someone shouting
Idiot get up!  it's of morning
If you want to know the truth
I was sleeping. 

don't afraid of me
or throw your groceries
I'm here to meet you
in white skeleton suit
I promise you that I'll be back
there were lots of things happened
from the time we said goodbye
I doubt you recognize me 
I've changed a lot
but I never forget you
you must have waited so long 
you don't know what's going on
I see you don't sleep enough
you are crying too much
don't worry about me
I'm no longer bleeding
please call me a fool
I just come back to tell you
sorry, I was dead


There are no substitutes for lips.
And as for hands.
The turning wheel of clay colored putty.
The color determines the length of the day.
The width of the road I can't cross.
Is there a place one can stand and stay wet.
Today in Clearwater Florida.
Homless a woman, 
gave up all hope and was hit by a bus.
Long slender fingers could have been at one time.
But for the rubber necks I would have then missed her.
My tongue was bound up in wire.
Transition from this to that.
Odd that the puddle around her head, 
was as yellow as the sun. that some dread. 

I was hoping I’d find that person
The one I once knew you to be. 
But the one I found that your life has made
Is not the one I thought that I would see.

You’re not anything like I’d remembered
You’re different in many ways. 
I can not place my finger on it
But I know I will some day.

I might have changed in your view too
However; you’ve never mentioned so. 
But if I had and it wasn’t good
I hoped that you’d tell me so. 

I know that years do change a man
Can make them better or maybe worse.
I choose to take Him over any friendship first.

He has always kept his promises to me
Something you I’m sorry will never be able to say. 
He never tells me good bye, fair well
His love for me doesn’t work that way. 

So all I can do from here on out 
Is to love you from afar. 
Because I am the way I am now
And you are now the way you are. 

Only to her that one, that only one
the one of whom there is but one is he
and no man has made this speech.

Speakable only to he, is she, 
whom speaks to you of he.
Remarkable is she, 
whom knows the touch of he.

Wet grass kept thus and always
by he for she is knowing
he is the animal, 
hers and hers, 
put their only for her by he, for that.
Safe in the knowledge of her sea. 

I was ignorant
Amorous glances
Arch of her brows
Scented ringlets
A mole near her mouth
Taught me a lot


Admiring the bird
Perched on the tree
I envied her
for she was free.
I am in awe  
of her flights.
I adore her for 
the pleasant sights.
 
 
Still admiring the bird
Her beauty I harboured.
Sudenly the same bird
Pooped right on me.
Neither did I complain 
Nor did I fume; 
Afterall it was her freedom
Her birth right I assume.
 

I looked up again at the bird
Perched on the tree.
With hateful eyes
No admiration, please.
Her freedom to poop
& to target anyone, 
I so have grown to hate
Ever since I was the it's prey! 
 


 There can be injury from sin while you’re dancing
Needn’t touch it directly you see. 
It sort of rubs off on us in someway
And can cause you grave unseen injury. 

Like when you catch your mind wandering
To those places it shouldn’t really go.
Even though you might not commit the deed
Your mind has already suffered it so. 

"But I wasn’t touching it, "Father"
"I was just dancing around and around.
And somehow I reached out my hand
And that sin was what now is bound."

We can’t dance around sinful thoughts or deeds
Eventually you’re going to get stuck! 
It will leave scars unseen by others
From the needles of sins cactus now plucked


I was lost without you, you and your green eyes.
The waves rare form, 
the moon above was not lost or found because.
A certain look and then again, I was.
Being man I long each night the candle you help burn.
At noon comes day and short was gone, it was gone away.
Grayer than the grayest is a snow flake lost at sea. 
I was lost without you hold me dearly, I like you one kind mind. 
Burning bright and few are light is beautiful, 
and you burn brighter am I bright inside you I lay still.
Still you find, however as I you deeply inside long and sing.
Then again I am never still, because the way you move and turn.
It was never gone that long and yet you say you will. 
I sink beneath you, stand above you, Oh of love I love you deeply.
The Clearing by the waterfalls the mist do you turn on, 
and off my feelings.
Feel the wind, it hurries past me staying.
Feel the rainstorm of your love but to the ear is not it audible? 
I was lost without you and I was like the branches. 
And green when leaves are thin, 
And in passing through the full half moons.
I would humbly stop, look up and you say.
Coming nearer to me passing, 
and when I leave help me over next to the blind person. 

I was made erect and lone,
And within me is the bone;
Still my vision will be clear,
Still my life will not be drear,
To the center all is near.
Where I sit there is my throne.
If age choose to sit apart,
If age choose, give me the start,
Take the sap and leave the heart. 

I was never yours, 
lost, adrift, so long I was, 
holding on for all to see.

Held apart, for I to long
each fragrent smell, 
I have no tast of the sea.

Was I, 
when you tell me, ever wrong 
to sing that song, too thee. 

I WAS not false to thee, and yet 
My cheek alone looked pale; 
My weary eye was dim and wet, 
My strength began to fail. 
Thou wert the same; thy looks were gay, 
Thy step was light and free; 
And yet, with truth, my heart can say, 
I was not false to thee!

I was not false to thee, yet now 
Thou hast a cheerful eye, 
With flushing cheek and drooping brow 
I wander mournfully. 
I hate to meet the gaze of men, 
I weep where none can see; 
Why do I only suffer, when 
I was not false to thee?

I was not false to thee; yet oh! 
How scornfully they smile, 
Who see me droop, who guess my woe, 
Yet court thee all the while. 
'Tis strange! but when long years are past, 
Thou wilt remember me; 
Whilst I can feel until the last, 
I was not false to thee

Yes I was once yours, so deep lost in you, 
Could it not be, nothing's meant to last
The light from the moon when seen at noon, 
Each wave that is seen different from the last.

If I am to be, what you meant to me, 
A perfect snug fit like a stone in a ring
From afar I have watched a bush and a tree, 
Hope made of hope a hand full of leaves.
 
If I fall any deeper, as deep as the sea, 
I shan't hold out, I shan't even breath
Swept in by the tide, swept back out to the sea, 
You were to me deaf, to the sound of my heart. 

Gone I once was with the wind in the South
back to a time when then as a child I once was, 
here where we lived time stood still.

Butter milk and moist
cornpone was never less always more
than a word home made grits.
Ox tails, green collards, 
fresh squeezed lime, potatoes mashed, 
pecan pie, butter and biscuits, ice tea.

Before it was to late
U. 

S. children could never understand it, all the
dark white hate, 
directed by them to our colored mothers their maids
whom brought
more than sweet syrup to our plates.

The railroad tracks were where we were warned of
before we became mirrored images of our parents.
A tad east and a bit west a little ways north, 
just a stones throw some ways off to the south of
were all of the wooden homes that we lived in.

Important men with well worn heals
without respect for decent folks, the ones whom
could not back then vote.
Knowing if they could twould vote mostly Democrat.
We were always curious about how they could
deny respect to U. 

S.
and give nothing to the other and stir up such hate? 


Now it is fifty years latter she they and them
have lived for over one hundred years
in the same home 
they come from the Church
and give U. 

S. a ride to vote inside of the van
we can't help 
but to speak about how we once lived in one district
represented by a community member
and how some old white man with white hair
gets on 


 have at least one family member
in some back woods hidden Prison he holds stock in. 

Thou hast not left the rough-barked tree to grow
Without a mate upon the river's bank;
Nor dost Thou on one flower the rain bestow,
But many a cup the glittering drops has drank;
The bird must sing to one who sings again,
Else would her note less welcome be to hear;
Nor hast Thou bid thy word descend in vain,
But soon some answering voice shall reach my ear;
Then shall the brotherhood of peace begin,
And the new song be raised that never dies,
That shall the soul from death and darkness win,
And burst the prison where the captive lies;
And one by one new-born shall join the strain,
Till earth restores her sons to heaven again. 

We came from dirt whats with all these

I'm talking to you..
Fools are fools pretending you are means 
your not when you say that you aren't are you

Dirt that flees has a quick broom behind it as

Some times I'm out and about just playing the fool.

My life is the gardener of my body. The brain—a hothouse closed tight
with its flowers and plants, alien and odd
in their sensitivity, their terror of becoming extinct.
The face—a formal French garden of symmetrical contours
and circular paths of marble with statues and places to rest,
places to touch and smell, to look out from, to lose yourself
in a green maze, and Keep Off and Don't Pick the Flowers.
The upper body above the navel—an English park
pretending to be free, no angles, no paving stones, naturelike,
humanlike, in our image, after our likeness,
its arms linking up with the big night all around.
And my lower body, beneath the navel—sometimes a nature preserve,
wild, frightening, amazing, an unpreserved preserve,
and sometimes a Japanese garden, concentrated, full of
forethought. And the penis and testes are smooth
polished stones with dark vegetation between them,
precise paths fraught with meaning
and calm reflection. And the teachings of my father
and the commandments of my mother
are birds of chirp and song. And the woman I love
is seasons and changing weather, and the children at play
are my children. And the life my life.

     I've never been in those places where I've never been
and never will be, I have no share in the infinity of light-years and dark-years,
but the darkness is mine, and the light, and my time
is my own. The sand on the seashore—those infinite grains
are the same sand where I made love in Achziv and Caesarea.
The years of my life I have broken into hours, and the hours into minutes
and seconds and fractions of seconds. These, only these,
are the stars above me
that cannot be numbered.

     And what is my life span? I'm like a man gone out of Egypt:
the Red Sea parts, I cross on dry land,
two walls of water, on my right hand and on my left.
Pharaoh's army and his horsemen behind me. Before me the desert,
perhaps the Promised Land, too. That is my life span.

     Open closed open. Before we are born, everything is open
in the universe without us. For as long as we live, everything is closed
within us. And when we die, everything is open again.
Open closed open. That's all we are.

    What then is my life span? Like shooting a self-portrait.
I set up the camera a few feet away on something stable
(the one thing that's stable in this world),
I decide on a good place to stand, near a tree,
run back to the camera, press the timer,
run back again to that place near the tree,
and I hear the ticking of time, the whirring
like a distant prayer, the click of the shutter like an execution.
in His big darkroom. And here is the picture:
white hair on my head, eyes tired and heavy,
eyebrows black, like the charred lintels
above the windows in a house that burned down.
My life span is over.

     I wasn't one of the six million who died in the Shoah,
I wasn't even among the survivors.
And I wasn't one of the six hundred thousand who went out of Egypt.
I came to the Promised Land by sea.
No, I was not in that number, though I still have the fire and the smoke
within me, pillars of fire and pillars of smoke that guide me
by night and by day. I still have inside me the mad search
for emergency exits, for soft places, for the nakedness
of the land, for the escape into weakness and hope,
I still have within me the lust to search for living water
with quiet talk to the rock or with frenzied blows.
Afterwards, silence: no questions, no answers.
Jewish history and world history
grind me between them like two grindstones, sometimes
to a powder. And the solar year and the lunar year
get ahead of each other or fall behind,
leaping, they set my life in perpetual motion.
Sometimes I fall into the gap between them to hide,
or to sink all the way down.

    I believe with perfect faith that at this very moment
millions of human beings are standing at crossroads
and intersections, in jungles and deserts,
showing each other where to turn, what the right way is,
which direction. They explain exactly where to go,
what is the quickest way to get there, when to stop
and ask again. There, over there. The second
turnoff, not the first, and from there left or right,
near the white house, by the oak tree.
They explain with excited voices, with a wave of the hand
and a nod of the head: There, over there, not that there, the other there,
as in some ancient rite. This too is a new religion.
I believe with perfect faith that at this very moment.~ I WATCH I WATCH I WATCH ~

Ye, 
You’re standing in the: 
Endless Universe, 
Endless Dark, 
Endless Light.

Ye, 
You’re standing beyond the: 
Boundaries of Life and Death.

Ye,

Silent Dark, 
Silent Light
Embosom Your foot prints
When minstrel oozing
From Your harp.

Achefully Joyfully
I watch I watch I watch
Without any utterance
Without any hope.

I was hungry on Thanksgiving
But I couldn't eat a thing
I couldn't eat a drumstick
And I couldn't eat a wing
I couldn't have the pickles
Or the gravy covered rice
The pumpkin pie was luscious
But I couldn't have a slice
I was starving for some stuffing
Or a tasty yellow yam
Or a puffy little muffin
Spread with homemade berry jam
Our dinner looked delicious
But I didn't dare to touch
I went hungry on Thanksgiving
My new braces hurt too much

I went out looking for a house  
down St. George's Road, on up to 
the Blockhouse Bay roundabout, 
turned right around it, downhill
past a  school, past memories
then uphill towards the shops.
I went out looking for a house.
I turned right into Bolton Street, 
another right turn into Marlowe Road, 
past Keats Street, then left into
Swinburne Street and parked the car. 
I wanted to see these poetic streets.
I saw a house with cream stucco walls, 
with 'buy me' written all over it.
I knocked on the door, which was  opened
by a woman who was packing her bags, 
but still had time to show me round
her two-storeyed two-bedroom house, 
which was red- carpeted throughout.
'I'm doing the packing myself', 
'I am an independent woman like Beyonce, '
she said. 'I'll buy that', I responded.





I wept
I wept bitterly when I was born

I wept bitterly and cried
where I had come

The Almighty consoled me
told me, you'd see me
in your mother's face

So, I did

The Almighty assured me
to provide all needs

So, he did

He made me acquaintance of
my father, brother, sister, all relatives
and friend

I followed Him what he said

He sent a teacher for me
and guided me

He told me to love them all

So, I did.

Now, I love all
I have become captive in love of all


You have made me captive of this world
which I love utmost
Now, you say me to be free
from all love and lust of this world

How it is possible? 
How can I ignore them all

I who could not measure with your heights, 
I who was not one of your kind; 
I whom you meet " a few years " — too late-
The one who loves you until death.

I whose thoughts are only you, 
I who persists in love, and you are cruel; 
I who loves you more in jealousy: 
The one to whom you're treasury.

I who you despise too mercilessly, 
I who deeply in scorn you humiliate; 
I who for so many years wept in silence: 
The one whose love for you is timeless.

I to whom you inform your future plans, 
I who alone in mind makes plans with you; 
I who feels you moving on: 
The one in love, still holding on.

I who lives because of you, 
I who only wants to hear of you; 
I whose only wish before I die: 
You, — to see just one more time. 

I will word my love a poem
Without the need for ending.
I will write my love a letter
Without the need for sending.

I will scribe my love a story
Which must be finished never.
I will pen my love a saga
Which must go on forever.

'Hope is the anchor of my soul..
 Faith is stronger than great wall..
 Love is powerful than the wind..
 We'll follow Your commandments.
 I will never astray, 
 I will never betray'.. 

I will think 
Of this death 
Only once 
When it comes 
I will accept 

I will look up 
To the heavens 
For gift of life 

I will see 
Through tears 
Of both pain 
And such joy 

I will hear 
Angelic 
Soul whispers 
Welcoming 

I will taste 
Unconditional 
Eternal love 
And cry no more

call me crazy, 
i just can't shake the facts, 
what are we so afraid of? 
we admit our lover for each other, 
when we met up again, 
when we found each other, 
all i knew was you were single, 
than three months of consent talking, 
you have a girl you want to marry, 

did i read the facts wrong? 
i was the girl you would call, 
late at night to talk and laugh, 
you asked for my opinion, 
and i often gave it, 
don't get me wrong, 
the girl you with is alot better, 
than the other girls, 
you've been with in the past, 
but why did you drag me along for the ride? 
and gave me hope, 
that one day we will be together? 

just like you always told me, 
when we were kids, 
but that all i'm here for, 
to be taken on a ride, 
that don't really include us, 
it always included just you, 

i get we no longer kids, 
but if you truely cared about me, 
like you said, 
why try to get me jealous of what you have? 
you did it when we were kids growing up, 
and you doing it now, 
if you knew i had a crush on you, 
and we opened up how we felt about each other, 
why did you not be honest about the other girl? 
i knew there were others, 
but you changed girls like seasons, 
none you were serious with, 
but out of the blue, 
this is the girl you want to marry?



I will no longer spend much time
On the plains - the cities and the fields
Though they give me almost everything
To lead a happy life with my Darling.

I will climb up 
Neither the mountains nor the hills 
Though they tempt me to watch  
The beauty of snow falling near Heaven.

I will choose the sea 
Filled with perils and dangers
As it calls me every time
To collect pearls from its womb. 

I will be a diver only to bring 
The pearls from the oysters 
Dwelling in the womb of the sea 
As I'll adorn my Mistress' crown with the pearls. 

Working, front's, word, is lines.
One step, backs up the other.
In your palm are all my, softer) I(s. 

I will come back again 
To you, to your garden 
As the days of spring appear
On this earth my dear.

I couldn't speak with you for years.
You may find me in the late night hours.
Like the full moon I will peep 
Through the window of your life. 

Like the jasmine in autumn 
I will blossom with passion.
I will spread my sweet fragrance 
To fill your mind with happiness. 

Like the shower of rain 
I will fall in summer again.
I will quench your thirst dear 
With the cold shower. 

I will come back again 
To your heart, to your garden. 
In autumn or winter, in spring or summer
Only for you- only for your love my dear. 

Those eyes with warm sight
Those hands with gentle touch
Those lips with tender smile

I will falling in love with that man
Who makes my heart beatfast
Who first holds me when I'm down
Who still loves me when I'm old

They say I'm just dreaming
about all novels and tearjerkers
but should I imagine my dream as nightmare? 

I just don't know but
I have, I want, I will
falling in love with a good man


Life seems to be nothing but hell to me
As I have been suffering from 
A prolonged disease for about one year. 
It seems as if I'm between life and death. 

So many doctors checked me up. 
Some of them said, 'It is Stomatitis.' 
Some opined, 'It is Mouth Ulcer.'
Some failed to diagnose my disease. 

I also searched on different sites 
By typing the symptoms of my ailments 
Only to know the name of the disease 
From which I've been suffering for a year. 

I find that there are white and red lesions 
Inside both of my cheeks and on my tongue. 
I am very very punctual in having medicines. 
Not a single dose has been missed so far. 

Two doctors treated me wrongly initially. 
Then an MD on Medicine advised me -
I should go to a dentist for my treatment.  
I went to a reputed Govt. Hospital in my city. 

One famous doctor checked me up
And prescribed few vitamin tablets 
And a liquid mouth wash for me 
And told me to go there after a month.

After a month I went to hospital. 
I saw that the sores were almost gone. 
The doctor checked up me for some time 
And he was satisfied with the improvement. 

The doctor prescribed vitamin A and C 
And a mouth wash for two weeks 
And asked me for scaling my teeth next time. 
I appeared before the board of the doctors. 

My teeth had been scaled for thirty minutes. 
Then I was prescribed an ointment for two weeks.
I was happy as I thought I would be recovered soon. 
After two weeks I stopped the prescribed medicines. 

After few days I saw the same white lesions 
Inside my cheeks and on my tongue. 
I was worried and then again I went to hospital.
The dentist took few minutes to examine me. 

Then he prescribed blood tests for 
TC, DC, ESR, HB, Sugar Test and Serum ANF. 
The tests were done within a week. 
I found nothing wrong with the reports.  

With several white lesions inside my mouth 
I went to the dentist surgeon of S. 

S. 

K. 

M..
The Head of the Deptt. prescribed 
A tab. Levocetrizine and Oint. Triamcinolone. 

I don't know what will happen with my destiny.
I only know that I am not at ease even for a second
And I should be cured from the disease like Stomatitis
Or Mouth Ulcer or Lichen Planus whatever may be. 

The doctor advised me not to feel tensed, 
Not to eat spicy foods, not to suffer from anxiety. 
I don't know whether I will be recovered or not.
I don't know whether I will be able to write poetry at ease.  

I will fight inside and outside like a great warrior
Even if the whole world turns its face from me. 
Like Keats I'll fight for my passion till my last breath.




I will follow you, 
Wherever you go
O'er this great expanse
This you should know.

If I stumble
Or if I fall
Will you reach out for me
Standing tall? 

My life is in your hands, 
You are my guide
Please don't ever leave me
Stay by my side.

Never forsake me, 
My heart is yours
Yearning for love 
It's you I adore.

Yes, I will follow you
Wherever it takes me
Climbing a mountain
Or sailing the seas.

You're in my heart
You dwell therein
You're here with me
Let our journey begin.

Yes, I will follow you
You've touched my soul
Leading the way
You've made me whole.

Yes, I will follow you! 

Meggie Gultiano
my warmest greetings to the sun,
and to the tender rivers that streamed in my veins,
and to the raining clouds that forever carried- my endless dreams-
to the other side.
 
Also,
my greetings go-
to the poplar trees in the yard-
and their sore but graceful aging-
under the comes and goes of sun:
They escorted me in all chilly visits-
of dry times.
 
 
And,
I am sending my greetings to the dark crowd of crows:
They always brought me the refreshing scent of nightly crops.
 
And,
my greetings go to my mother-
who stayed and lived  in the mirror,
and looked like my aged face.
 
And my greetings to this earth, this generous earth-
that the thrill of repeating me, filled its aroused inside- with countless greening seeds.
 
 
I will come, I will come,
I will arrive.
 
I will arrive:
With my flowing locks:
the winged scent of Earth;
With my eyes:
the bright insight of Night.
 
And I will bring to you-
all the flowers that I picked-
from the other side of the wall.
 
I will come, I will come,
I will arrive.
 
I will arrive!
And then,
all the closed gates will be shattered by Love,
And all the forsaken isles will be invaded by Love,
And there, I will greet everybody who loves.
 
And, I know:
There will be a girl,
still standing in front of the gates,
those soaked gates-
in the Deluge of Love.
I will greet her again as well.
I will greet her again as well.
 



I will keep
Broken
Things:
The big clay
Pot
With raised
Iguanas
Chasing
Their
Tails; 
Two
Of their
Wise

Heads
Sheared
Off; 

I will keep
Broken
things:
The old
Slave
Market
Basket
Brought
To my
Door

By Mississippi
A jagged
Hole
Gouged
In its sturdy
Dark
Oak
Side.

I will keep
Broken
things:
The memory
Of
Those
Long
Delicious
Nig ht
Swims
With
You; 

I will keep
Broken
things:
In my house
There
Remains
An

Honored
Shelf
On which
I will
Keep
Broken
Things.

Their beauty
Is
They
Need
Not
Ever
Be 
'fixed.'

I will keep
Your
Wild
Free
Laughter
Thoug h
It is now
Missing
Its
Reassuring
And
Gra ceful
Hinge.

I will keep
Broken
Things:

Thank you 
So much! 

I will keep
Broken
Things.

I will keep
You:

Pilgrim
Of
Sorrow.
I will keep
Myself. 

Everytime my eyelids fall 
Night after night in all my dreams
I see you, I feel you, and that is all
I need to know that my heart still screams

Easily across this distance
And all the miles apart
The echoes and resonance 
Of your name from my heart

Wherever to you ran away
I believe that our hearts still go on
For once you've come inside the doorway
You'll remain till we're gone

Love can't touch us one at a time
And of that I am sincerely sure
My love for you pursues a lifetime
And will fade away nevermore

Joy was when I loved you
True joy was when you loved me back
And though we've fallen apart it's true
my mind's on a one way track

One day I swear it
Like only lord knew
I will live until I hear the words from your lips
'I love you too'I will love pure song forever
said I to the rising wind
and whether the wind is

rising or falling, 
the music heard or
not heard

whether I disappear with it
without a word
whether it leaves me bereft

whether it is nothing

I have left, the birds having departed before me, 
and everything that soared
and I, alone on the pier

a mere stick figure without it
scarecrow of sound

and I bend down so far to hear
what signs of welcome I can

I know that without song

oh dearest song
I shall not enter in.

I love you so much, 
I love the sound of your voice
And the way that we touch.
I love your warm smile
And your kind, thoughtful way, 
The joy that you bring
To my life every day.
I love you today
As I have from the start, 
And I'll love you forever
With all of my heart. 

Look O, traveller
Before dying
Put your dreams
In the care
Of wind and water
I will make words out of dreams.
From the grime of your corpse
I will come to grow flowers! 

I will meet you soon.
I will spend hours with you 
In the palace of dream.

I will meet you, my dear! 
I will spends hours 
With you, only with you 
In the fair of bliss.

I will meet you, sweet Honey!  
I will walk with you 
Hour after hour 
On the beach of beauty and love. 

I will meet you, my beloved! 
I will spend every moment 
With you, only with you 
In the carnival of love.

I will meet you, my Love!  
I will spend with you 
And be ever youth 
By stopping time with my love.

Wait a bit, my sweet Love! 
I will meet you 
And spend hours silently 
To eternize the moments.  

must have been greatly inconvenienced
to clam up that suddenly concerning the blind dissident                     
who scaled a wall at midnight
in the name of everyone living.
the great players don't wish to appear
indelicate in their discussions
to speak with their mouths full or
to chew gum while whistling-
or to indicate to us at all that they have even barely heard
of the blind man in total darkness, hoisting himself
on a mouthful of air over the wall; 
crudely, with no stars to guide him.
treated now, at best, like a badly behaved child
shoved into a closet where the fine coats hang
of the distinguished guests, appalled-
while the Grownups  figure out what to do next.
the man with no protocols, I guess, 
to follow -  must be excused for his
crassness for putting the great players
-on short notice- into hipwaders 
through a predicament they thought they were well rid of-
imagine their horror, if you can-
what was he thinking? 
at such a precious moment in the history
of hushed corridors-
to be drawing attention away from
the muffled  footsteps of Giants? 
sitting glumly at thick tables
with their eyesight intact
their expensive water-
they'll try to take back lost heights of
professionalism I guess it's called now
but they'll keep slipping
on the 'situation'
falling a little flat-
Playground Bullies Are Mum, 
the papers read next day (half-right, you figure out, which half) : 
Counting Out Their Confliscated Marbles
For the Really Important Work That Lies Ahead-
it's such a critical lapse in judgment  
it's such a delicate moment in the single butterfly life-span
neither here nor there to the estimable diplomats=
who know how to play the game-
and should just table it-
I want my language back.  
forget the marbles. the lost pocketbook of the world-
where's the subject of the sentence here? 
the Big People behind the hush-hush doors or
the barely acknowledged man who risked his life? 
dear children, let's take a holiday from all this.
can you imagine this, children? 
can you imagine the rarest flower in the rarest garden.
now imagine the flower living and not plucked out-
now imagine this is not imaginary-
may I mention and mention even in my sleep
the blind man
who hoisted himself over the world at midnight
as if to see-  
and to feel the night air all around him-
breathing  all on his own the breath-taking gardens of the world.
may he be honored above nations-
who are silent when they should sing
and speaking when they should just
sit down and weep
for starry courage branching on
even in blind eyes at midnight.                                
 
something to shout about. don't you think? 
what's the point of discretion here? 
let's be glad there's at least one of us left
in the barricaded gardens of the world
who still remembers
how to leave at midnight-




I will never forget you, 
My people
I have carved you
on the palm of My hand
I will never forget you
I will not leave you orphan
I will never forget My own

Does a mother forget her baby, 
or a woman the child
within her womb? 
Yet even if these forget, 
yes even if these forget, 
I will never forget My own

I will never forget you, 
My people
I have carved you
on the palm of My hand
I will never forget you
I will not leave you orphan
I will never forget you, 
My people
I have carved you
on the palm of My hand
I will never forget you
I will not leave you orphan
I will never forget My own


I will not cry for satisfaction if I could get my choice,
Among the divine beautiful virgins of heaven, I want only you.

After killing me, do not bury me in your street,
Why should people know your home address with my reference.

Be chivalrous for you are the wine bearer (beloved) , or else I
use to drink as much wine as I get every night.

I have no business with you but O! dear friend,
Convey my regards to the postman if you see him,
(to remind him that he has to deliver my message to my beloved) .

I will show you what Majnoo did,
If I could spare some time of my inner grief.

I am not bound to follow the directions given by Khizar (A prophet who is believed to be still alive and guide the people, who have lost their way, to the right path) ,
I accept that he remained my companion during my journey.

O! The inhabitants of the street of my beloved see
if you could find the insane poet Ghalib there some where. 

I will not fight: though proud of pith
I hold no one worth striving with;
And should resentment burn my breast
I deem that silence serves me best:
So having not a word to say,
Contemptuous I turn away.

I will not fret: my rest of life
Free I will keep from hate and strife;
Let lust and sin and anger sleep,
I will not delve the subsoil deep,
But be content with inch of earth,
Where daisies have their birth.

I will not grieve: Till day be done
I will be tranquil in the sun,
With garden glow and quiet nook,
And song of bird and spell of book . . .
But love and dream until--Goodnight

I will not need to cheat on this or any test, 
Very long hours of study to be by the best, 
Many praise, encourage and show love to me, 
Fulfilling desires through my dreams I see. 

Freedom from sacrifice yes this work is hard, 
Cannot give defeat a silent chance to bombard, 
I will consider these choices my right of grace, 
A means of worldly greatness adorns my face. 

Relay an experience through proper decorum, 
Grace without wisdom defeating the boredom, 
Existence is only for the better rights of good, 
I doubt without feuding in my neighborhood. 

We should not desire wantonness feeling guilt, 
A circus big top clown I make my way in stilts, 
Successful through the truth, I am rigidly built, 
Bagpipes guide the masses in my Scottish Kilts.

A Pied Piper if you will, donned in holy array, 
By leading mediocrity of incompetence astray, 
Perfection is an art that many have lost in time, 
Yet we choose to move forward if only in mind.

What good is confession when words form a lie, 
And the problem is expanded from failure. why? 
Where there is a tendency to accept second best, 
A successful future has been solemnly laid to rest.

One familiar adage I have good and I have bad news, 
As the latter is more like American-Philippine Blues, 
We worked together knowing sometimes it takes two. 

So who is the monster inside, is it real or is it fake? 
Is it truly taking a chance where you have an escape? 
A heart beats not, without blood pumping in the chest, 
And again, I will not need to cheat on this or any test.



I will not sing today, 
I will not sing 
of roses and of bulbuls 
of irises and hyacinths 
I will not sing 
Those drunken and ravishing 
Dulcet and sleepy-eyed songs. 
No more such songs for me ! 
I will not sing those songs today. 
Dust clouds of war have robbed the 
iris of her hue, 
The bulbul lies silenced by the 
thunderous roar of guns, 
Chains are all a-jingle in the 
haunts of hyacinths. 
A haze has blinded lightning's eyes, 
Hill and mountain lie crouched in fear, 
And black death 
Holds all cloud tops in its embrace, 
I will not sing today 
For the wily warmonger with loins girt 
Lies in ambush for my land. 

She is mine.
She is my beloved.
She is my little angel.
Don't mess up with her.
She is mine.
I will protect her 
even if I will have to be killed. 

I will put Chaos into fourteen lines
And keep him there; and let him thence escape
If he be lucky; let him twist, and ape
Flood, fire, and demon — his adroit designs
Will strain to nothing in the strict confines
Of this sweet Order, where, in pious rape,
I hold his essence and amorphous shape,
Till he with Order mingles and combines.
Past are the hours, the years, of our duress,
His arrogance, our awful servitude:
I have him. He is nothing more nor less
Than something simple not yet understood;
I shall not even force him to confess;
Or answer. I will only make him good. 

I will rape thee-
With my savage love; 
Born from the rural pot.

I will rape thee
And while I rot-
I will pray that you do not.

But, I will save thee
Because, honey, 
You've needs: the sting of me. 

And I will rape thee-
Because I know
Only to love and rape thee. 

Now we've arrived to the end of the road 
No one can feel the weight of the load 
We were chosen to be forever on the road
But you chose for me to be abroad 
I still remember, you say we will be together 
Oh oh no I forgot, u say we will be forever 
But really I don't know if you forgot or whatever 
U know, u think i've forgotten, but yet I still remember
U know, I won't forget what u said to me yesterday 
'Birds could die, , flowers could dry.. pens could dry'
'But our friendship will never say good bye'
And I will never say goodbye, u know why? 
Because without you I will have a reason to die.. 

I will return to you, my city of emeralds
grasping at no straws

that were ever offered

a golden rain falls in the street

in my heart, another world revolves

why don't you see? in the
cherry balloon just overhead
I am

casting roses at your
incomprehension

into the state of perpetual zen
from the ashes to the flame.
from just a name, 
to the zenith of fame
know this o women, 
for me you are no bad omen

in me now  i find peace
once it used to be only disease
in the mirror of your purity, 
i see my sins, reflected.
in your love, my women
i see in me, the divine resurrected.
if i was the night 
you were the light.
if i was chaos, 
you were order.
as queer as it is, 
in you i fused
in you i forgot the  fallacy of oneness

like the chant of a unknown hymn
your word echo in my ears
weighed my love and  my bleak future
weighed more, which one i don't know
so unkind, never told me
leaving only your lingering odor.

walked away did you? my women, 
to play fiddle to god? 
break me, you will not
strangle i will not 
in the betrayal knot.
in those lips, my name may die
cuddling the summer sun, , u maybe
playing with morning breeze, u maybe
repent i will never, for loving u
for you made me  a man
man enough, to live without u

wait for me my women, at the banks of styx
fear not my women 
i will hold your hands
i will look in your eyes
i will raise my head
i will rise in your love


I sing at my shrine, and if you join with me


Pleasing all who swirl in the melody. 

I dance to step away from pain

And tired, find joy creeping into my being.

If you don’t come to the shrine, 

I will still sing and dance! 

For its better to let this offering, 

Ululate with the universe, 

Than not to sing at all, 

Shrouded in a deathly pall. 

It was long I lay
Awake that night
Wishing that night
Would name the hour
And tell me whether
To call it day
(Though not yet light)
And give up sleep.
The snow fell deep
With the hiss of spray;
Two winds would meet,
One down one street,
One down another,
And fight in a smother
Of dust and feather.
I could not say,
But feared the cold
Had checked the pace
Of the tower clock
By tying together
Its hands of gold
Before its face.

Then cane one knock!
A note unruffled
Of earthly weather,
Though strange and muffled.
The tower said, 'One!'
And then a steeple.
They spoke to themselves
And such few people
As winds might rouse
From sleeping warm
(But not unhouse).
They left the storm
That struck en masse
My window glass
Like a beaded fur.
In that grave One
They spoke of the sun
And moon and stars,
Saturn and Mars
And Jupiter.
Still more unfettered,
They left the named
And spoke of the lettered,
The sigmas and taus
Of constellations.
They filled their throats
With the furthest bodies
To which man sends his
Speculation,
The cosmic motes
Of yawning lenses.
Their solemn peals
Were not their own:
They spoke for the clock
With whose vast wheels
Theirs interlock.
In that grave word
Uttered alone
The utmost star
Trembled and stirred,
Though set so far
Its whirling frenzies
Appear like standing
in one self station.
It has not ranged,
And save for the wonder 
Of once expanding
To be a nova,
It has not changed
To the eye of man
On planets over
Around and under
It in creation
Since man began
To drag down man
And nation nation. 

I will starve you, Mind, from chaotic thoughts
Until you're cleansed crystal-clear, and purified; 
And from my Heart shall spring my words, 
Where there's no confusion, doubt un-clarified.

A self-confused antagonist is your neuronal web, 
Too wide and wild you correlate associations; 
Your blindness, sufferance to Heart it brings, 
When Love's irrational in your connections. 

A cup of coffee in the morning, 
Tuned-up a sweet music to sing, 
The book that you keep on reading, 
What a beautiful smile, the sun is dancing.

A teary eye shouldn't be, so please 
Don't be sad, if you cannot do it, 
Calm down, i will lift you up and rise, 
It is okay, your age is perfect and is a natural gift.

Your grey hairs is your beauty, 
Do not be shy and worry, 
Heart that speaks so affectionately, 
Your smile keeps me loving you for eternity.

I will take care of you. 

I will take you under my wing please don’t cry
I will take you under my wing so you won’t die
I will take you under my wing to get away from the bad
I will take you under my wing so you won’t be mad
I will take you under my wing so you won’t scream and shout 
I will take you under my wing so you won’t worry with that one doubt
I will take you under my wing so you can be safe forever
I will take you under my wing hay that’s pretty cleaver
I will take you under my wing during sick and during death 
I will take you under my wing so you won’t be in such a junky mess
I will take you under my wing so we can love each other 
I will take you under my wing because you are my fairy godmother


I will touch you as
breeze touches the tender leaves
or water touches a shoal of fish

I will touch you as
Zephyr touches the nubile flowers
or sunlight touches the cloud’s showers

I will touch you as
Morn sun touches, new sprung grass
or silky hair touches a face of lass

I will touch you as
Mother touches her newborn child
or sunlight touches the dew mild.

I will touch you as
Bard touches his inspired words
or tress nestle the chirpy birds

I will touch you as
Wind touches the dancing flame
or lovers touch her lovely dame

I will touch you as
Love touches the lover’s heart
or Artist touches his piece of art.

I will touch you as
Divine grace touche its devotee
or Rivers touch her beloved sea.

I will touch you------






I will traverse this winter distance
I will not forget
your white wonders

even with no gainful employment

the seal on my heart
that won't be broken

the wax of stars
when they cry out

melting on my last pages

a gate, leading to timeless union, 
created in starlight by such warm love.
brought, almost struggling, into
togetherness, not knowing why, 
you and I, now fated, must in patience
sit out our time at destiny's door.
Maybe sighing, but never denying
the beautiful bond that is ours..
Expansively wide is the opened gate, 
and I will wait there for eternity
knowing you will be with me
some day my dear.
If you join me  in spirit right now, 
I can assure you I will know. 

I will weep and weep for you, O Mind; 
(my Soul) The world hath caught you in its spell. 
Though you cling to them with the anchor of steel, 
Not even the shadow of the things you love Will go with you when you are dead. 
Why then have you forgot your own true Self 

I wish that I could wish upon a star.
A star so bright, that would be delightful.
It shines so bright, that the whole sky is as bright as day.

I wish I could have a friend.
A friend that is always there.
A friend who cares and is kind, 
And someone that you can trust.

I wish most hopefully that my wishes will come true.
And some day, just someday, they might come true. 

Where are you? 
where are you? 
i call you
recall you 
here call you my tears 
i wish you were here! 

where are you? 
where are you? 
i need you
and miss you
it's spring everywhere 
i wish you were here! 

where are you? 
where are you? 
i seek you
i just want to meet you
but you are nowhere
i wish you were here! 

it's blowing
it's raining 
it's fine everywhere
i wish you were here! 
i wish you were here

I wish your heart is as
Creamy as your body, 
Would not mind being
Addicted to your sweetness
I wish your heart is as
Hot as your long legs, 
Would not mind wrapping
Your warmth around my heart
I wish your heart is as
Beautiful as you look, 
Should not worry about it
Turning ugly in our holy union
I wish you are all
Before my loving sight.

***The Book Of Passion (Till death do us apart)

I wish I could be with you
Lying under the heavenly sky blue, 
Counting the stars bright
Holding your hands in twilight, 
Enjoying the radiant moon in the open beach
Openly our love we shall preach, 
I wanna feel the cool breeze in the open air
With you by my side anything else I dont care, 
I wanna pen down few romantic lines for you
Under the heavenly sky blue, 
I wish you could have seen my heart of gold
Together then we could have made things unfold! 
I wish. .. 

I wish. . 

Sky looks an angel in orange gown
Birds enchant beautiful sounds
Clouds run to be sky's crown
Winds blowing swiftly
Making themselves proud
Imbibed in rainbow's colors
All shining bright
Aiming for  new heights 
I wish  I could  be a  kite
 
Don't want to  be propelled
Don't want to be controlled
Want to sail in laminar  flow
Without hip hop and without any show
Leaping from one cloud to the other
Dancing and aiming  further and further
Without enrolling into fight
Aiming for new heights
I wish I could be a kite 
 
Love to dance with the avians
Nest clouds in thunder & rains
Enjoying as if space's guest
Makig mockery of  Mr  Everest (Mount Everest)     
Far  away from  everyone's sight
Cherishing the  beautiful flight
Aiming for new heights 
I wish  I could be a  kite


I wish I could, but I can't
I wish I would, but I won't
I can't do it, I don't believe
That is something I could never achieve

I couldn't do that, no way
Never, ever, the answer is nay
I will fail, I just know
Never succeed, it is just so

My mind does not compute success
It has no room for the word 'yes'
'No' has moved into every room
There are no vacancies in Hotel Doom

But wait a minute, maybe I can
Maybe, just maybe I can conjure up a plan
The failure program has just been superseded
It's obsolete, outmoded, can be completely deleted

 - my heart has been broken
and you ask if I love you
what can I love you with
if not my heart? 

my mind
my soul
none of these work
what is love
if you need a heart
why must we love
if it make our hearts fall apart? 

I wish I could say I love you
but I cant 
my heart has been broken, 
squished like an ant

so no I don't love you
I wish that I could
but my heart was taken
because  he thought he should

but I won't take yours
no 
I don't think that's right
because I want to love you
because I know you can fight

you can fight through the pain that's always there
you can kiss me and twist your fingers threw my hair
you can hold my body oh so tight
and whisper in my ear 'every things alright'
and trail your kisses down to my neck 
and whisper sweet words and it with a peck 

you love me so much I don't know what to do
I only wish I could love you too-I wish I was by that dim Lake,
Where sinful souls their farewell take 
Of this vain world, and half-way lie 
In death's cold shadow, ere they die. 
There, there, far from thee, 
Deceitful world, my home should be; 
Where, come what might of gloom and pain, 
False hope should n'er deceive again. 

The lifeless sky, the mournful sound 
Of unseen waters falling round; 
The dry leaves, quivering o'er my head, 
Like man, unquiet even when dead! 
These, ay, these shall wean 
My soul from life's deluding scene, 
And turn each thought, o'ercharged with gloom 
Like willows, downward towards the tomb. 

As they, who to their couch at night 
Would win repose, first quench the light, 
So must the hopes, that keep this breast 
Awake, be quench'd, ere it can rest. 
Cold, cold, this heart must grow, 
Unmmoved by either joy or woe, 
Like freezing founts, where all that's thrown 
Within their current turns to stone. 

I wish I was the person you would call
I wish I was the person to catch you when you fall

I wish I was the person you want to kiss
I wish I was the person who you would miss

I wish I was the person you cuddle at night
I wish I was the person to help you through your fright

I wish I was the person that you adored
I wish I was the person to see you when you’re bored

I wish I was the person who had the confidence to say
I wish I was THAT person maybe one day! ! 

If I were one and you were too
We'd end up in the local Zoo
Where W. Cs are free
No queues for entry
Have you quite finished in the LOO

I wish I were the tear falling from your eye
Gliding down your cheek
Sensing your skin
Soaking up a kiss
Standing tall on your chin
From then on falling, 
Falling in a puddle of sorrow
I would suffer less
Not feel so hollow
After giving you a heart break
And ending all that I faked.

But now I am sure, 
I’m not on a lie
‘I love you’
To say this everyday I die.
I want to right the wrong
Sing a love song
For you I long
But I know you won’t come back to me.

How I wish I were the tear falling from your eye
For at least I would have the company of-
Your cheek, your skin, your kiss, your chin
Your all 
And
Together 
We’ll drop In  a puddle of love.

I wish I were the tear falling from your eye
But even these wishes are dry. 

Here is a poem that i found when cleaning out a box that i hadn't opened in ages: 


I wish, I wish, 
What do I wish for? 
I wish, I wish.
What do i wish for? 
I haven't got a clue.
Hang on, 
I know what I'll wish for.

I'll wish for Justice, in the world, .
I'll wish for Peace, in the world.
I'll wish for Mercy, in the world.
I'll wish for Love, in the world.
I'll wish for Hope, in the world.
I'll wish for the rid of poverty in the world.
I'll wish that the poor geet helped.
I'll wish for so many other things, that I can't think of them all.



I wish you a red crayon heart of a day
bearing down hard on the crayon, remember? 
that way you get the darkest red

and fit for roses, the roofs of little houses
under a corner sun

and the rays extending
in dotted lines on you, on everyone.
these were our masterpieces of

the classroom afternoons clapping the erasers
so the chalkdust scattered like pollen
because it mattered to do everything

with that much heart to stay in tune so

as to fall on our aluminum foil swords
or shimmer,  the princess, 
in a tower of words

and that was all we knew of art
and all that we knew when
all schoolroom days parted from us

and the autographs of friends
scattered like petals
before a rising wind. 

I wish you could understand i need you in my life everyday, 
I wish you could understand the hurt in my voice, 
I wish you could understand the thoughts i see of us.

I dream every night that were together far
away to a better place its just you and me
were peaceful and chilled 
were loved and in love together. 

I miss you every day and every night i
just wish i could cry out! 
I Miss you when i breath 
I Miss you when i sleep
I Miss you more than anything 
and i wished you could see.

I wish you could see how happy you make me.
I  wish you could see how much i wanna be with you
I wish that in time i get to see the real you 
if i do i promise to always love you. 

I wish you enough sun to keep you bright
No matter how dark is your night

I wish you enough rain to fall you in love 
No need the passionate plea of above

I wish you enough joy to keep you alive 
No matter how toughly you survive

I wish you enough gain to satisfy your desire
No need to ask to require

I wish you enough pain to make you awake
No matter how painful is your ache

I wish you enough loss to remind you of your own
No need to groan or moan

I wish you enough hellos to light your eye
No matter how heavy is the final bye


I wished I had a man 
An understanding man
One that can even swim
one that might understand.

I wished I could win first prize and even fly, 
But none of this imply's 
Even if I eat fries.

Someone wishes he was here, 
Even when he's very near, 
Even can speak loud and clear.

I wished the sky was gray, 
Just so I know he will stay, 
I just wished he could say, 
That he never play's games.
Someone who knows everything bout me, even my name.

Even someone who loves tha Blue Jays, 
I wished he even cared, 
someone who's there when I am even scared.

I wished I passed highschoool
Even think I am cool
I even wished I had a pool

I wished my uncle was here on earth, 
Even was here at my birth, 
And to just say he even cared, 
But most of the time he stopped to stare.

I wished he was here when I need him the most, 
At that I just wished he was here whether he was a ghost.
I just wished! 


Age: years old


I wished I pray to everything
When I saw trees, branches, leaves, root
I pray they can get happiness
When I saw stones, sand, soil
I pray they can get happiness
Although they pray much than me

I wished I pray to everything
When I saw tiger, bear, crocodile, snake, cat, dog, hawk, worm, whale
I pray they can find pleasures
When I saw flower, sun, moon, star, comet, snow, fog, mud, desert
I pray they can find pleasures
Although they pray much than me

I wished I pray to everything
When I saw sea, foam, wave, fish, boats
I pray they can have brightness
When I saw sky, cloud, lightning, storm, birds
I pray they can have brightness
Although they pray much than me

I wished I pray to everything
When I saw river, lake, gulf, waterfall, flood
I pray they can sense the joy
When I saw mountain, cave, hill, earthquake
I pray they can sense the joy
Although they pray much than me

I wished I pray to everything
When I saw grandpa, grandma, father, mother, uncle, aunt, grandchildren
I pray they can feel peaceful
When I saw presidents, leaders, heroes, soldiers, directors, actors
I pray they can feel peaceful
Although they pray much than me

I wished I pray to everything
When I saw doctors, nurses, victims, hospitals, shelters
I pray they can receive relief
When I saw sellers, buyers, goods, markets, shop
I pray they can receive relief
Although they pray much than me


I woke alone, 
   ignorant of your absence.
I woke alone, 
   knowing what I can not have.
I will wake alone, 
   remembering what could have been. 

I woke up this morning
and I was mourning
weary and broken 
my life burnin' down to ashes and smokin'
and I frowned 
and looked around
and I saw my bedroom cluttered with all 
those keepsakes from the seashore and the doll
you sent from Vietnam and the dream catchers we made in mountain meadow
years and years ago 
and I saw the portraits of parents and grandparents and all their glory and all their fame 
trapped in olden and golden picture frames 
and I looked out the window
and I saw skyblue stretching from horizon to horizon in dawn's birthing glow
and I saw sparrows flitting daintily from bush to bush by twos and threes 
and I saw the morning breeze arrive and begin to trifle with the leaves of the trees

  .  .. 

and I wondered

   

What would happen if I refuse 

  .  .   

to lose 

   

the ability to see the magic

I won’t come
I won’t go
I won’t live
I won’t die

I’ll keep uttering
The name
And lose myself
In it

I’m bowl
And I’m platter
I’m man
And I’m woman

I’m grapefruit
And I’m sweet lime
I’m Hindu
And I’m Muslim

I’m fish
And I’m net
I’m fisherman
And I’m time

I’m nothing
Says Kabir
I’m not among the living
Or the dead. 

I come today to say to this life that I'm not afraid.
I don't even care anymore about what you made.
Everything has its end, but the smile won't fade.
Everything has its price, and so I have paid.

You think that you are strong enough to catch me in a cage, 
But sorry about your guesses, I just have opened a new page, 
where the pencil is in my hand, and the eraser is beside me, 
and the dream is mine, so you don't know what it gonna be.

So catch your breath, and take all your precautions, 
because in my world there are no any anticipations. 

I won't go back now- 
I've found a happier, better, place.
I'm sorry you've had some rough times, 
And I want to be here for you, 
But I won't go back now.
I'll be your friend, 
When all others leave you, 
But I won't be yours-
My heart is given
To another. 

Will you come in the promise night
Or have you forgotten me in your mind
The waiting is felt so long
My soul’s flakening

Until the fact spread opened
That you can’t put a lie anymore
And the world seems to disappear
My heart’s darkening

I would not go back
Won’t weave this hope inside my heart
Because I have clearly found
The lone road of my life
Without you

I would not cry again
Even night is unbearable cold
Because I have realized
The end right in my eyes
All with your love

If I could throw the love I have
Blame everything to your fault
And I will come as a winner
But I don’t feel ease

If I could grow vines of hatred
Cover all of reminiscent
Beautiful but trap me in vain
And I can not stand

I would not go back
Won’t weave this hope inside my heart
Because I have clearly found
My own way of my life
Without you

I would never regret
Though I want reply so many times
Because all those memories
Are just a memory
That will be passing by

Will you come in the promise night
Or have you forgotten me in your mind
Now you only like a shadow
And the morning comes


Malam ini akankah kau datang
Atau malah melupakan 
Penantianku begitu panjang
Jiwaku menyerpih

Hingga tiba fakta terbentang
Yang tak dapat kau dustakan
Dan dunia seakan menghilang
Hatiku menghitam

Takkan kembali
Takkan merajut asa di diri
Karena ku telah temui
Jalan sepiku sendiri
Tanpa dirimu

Takkan menangis
Walau malam dingin tak terperi
Karena ku telah sadari
Semua berakhir di sini
Bersama cintamu

Ingin cinta semua kubuang
Timpakan semua kesalahan
Dan ku kan menjadi pemenang
Tapi ku tak tenang

Ingin benci tumbuh berkembang
Menutupi semua kenangan
Indah tapi begitu mencengkeram
Dan ku tak tahan

Takkan kembali
Takkan merajut asa di diri
Karena ku telah temui
Jalan hidupku sendiri
Tanpa dirimu

Takkan sesali
Meski ingin kuulang kembali
Karena semua memori
Hanyalah sebuah memori
Yang kan berlalu

Malam ini akankah kau datang
Atau malah melupakan 
Kini kau hanya sebuah bayang 
Dan pagi menjelang


I won’t let it
I won’t let the wave of shadows
Clod my sky and hide my sun
I won’t let it
I won’t let a cold rejection
Frozen my attitude toward love’s warmth
I won’t let it
I won’t let insulting word
Hurt me more than it should be burnt before
I won’t let it
I won’t let stain of hate
Contaminate and conquer my heart
I won’t let it
I won’t let my head lower down
Though tears stream in my eyes
I won’t let it
I won’t let the hole of despair
Eating my chance to happiness
I won’t let it
I won’t let the tickling clock
Catch me in the fear of night
I won’t let it
I won’t let the bitter of life
Become the only one I remember
I won’t let it
I won’t let the pile of work
Suffocate and burden my soul
I won’t let it
I won’t let a hard future
Halt my feet to walk forward
I won’t let it
I won’t let the glamour of the world
Confuse and blind me to dream other
I won’t let it
I won’t let a wrong decision
Prevent me to search a better way
I won’t let it
I won’t let self pity
Close my insight of struggling hope
I won’t let it
I won’t let complaint and disappointment
Make me only share sorrow
I won’t let it
I won’t let stabbing lost
Shatter my will to survive
I won’t let it
I won’t let the spoken promise
Disappear easily like a mist


Yes, now I won't let you cry
Will keep your cheeks ever dry
See, I have widened my Eyes
To Vanish your widest cries
You being so subtle as a turtle
Having knowledge so little
Moved unknowingly for the vital.


When your reasons go beyond reasons
Clearly I will change your seasons
Will make the sorrows shorten
Till joys lead the curtain
Experience! the rays of my life
I have made the things alright.


I hear the upcoming coming
Your sweet days coming
Come, my shoulders are there
To care your tears
You may have a try
To roll smile over your cry.



Yes now I won't let your eyes cry


When I am away from you
I feel so very blue
I always sit and wonder
If you feel the same way to

Look at my knees, 
That island rising from the steamy seas! 
The candles a tall lightship; my two hands 
Are boats and barges anchored to the sands, 
With mighty cliffs all round;
They’re full of wine and riches from far lands


I wonder what it feels like to be drowned?

I can make caves, 
By lifting up the island and huge waves 
And storms, and then with head and ears well under
Blow bubbles with a monstrous roar like thunder, 
A bull-of-Bashan sound. 
The seas run high and the boats split asunder


I wonder what it feels like to be drowned?

The thin soap slips
And slithers like a shark under the ships. 
My toes are on the soap-dish—that’s the effect 
Of my huge storms; an iron steamer’s wrecked. 
The soap slides round and round; 
He’s biting the old sailors, I expect


I wonder what it feels like to be drowned

Sometimes I wonder 
Why many weird things run on my head
Why all the deadliest things on earth
In my mind are fed

I try a lot to think only Positive
Read all the motivational books in massive
That would help me rebuild my mind
So that peace and solace I shall find

I remain calm and composed
For the first few days I am poised
But whenever I hear anybody's misery
I start comparing to me and my life making myself jittery

My mind again starts wandering
Imagination of losing my loved ones, I start fearing
This creates troubled waves in my head
Disturbs my mood and makes me go red

Oh god! Help me attain tranquility
Help me control my feelings 
So that I can enjoy life peacefully
With only memories of joyful living

Returning at dawn from the port 
Monster avian hover around
Lied down, yet, bed never obliged 
For the turbulence within, I wonder why! 

Didn't hear the Buggy Guju-Guju-
Perturbing my midnight TV watch
Didn't do midnight run down either
To open the door, I wonder why --
! 

Didn't hear usual question answer session
Mom used to switch on, every night like
Only time his voice is heard, usually
Unheard tonight, I wonder why --! 

Room, emancipated his warmth from
Remains sealed and unattended 
Buggy gone in to a slumber, dejectedly like
Apparently for a spell, I wonder why 
! 

Of the three chicks raised in domicile
Only one hanged around, warming our nest
For his good, took to wings, away in to blues
Testing might, exploring global span

Adobe seems insipidly
Stay in feels lousily  
Contemplating moodily 
I wonder, I wonder why --


Ever since you left me, 
My life has been lonely and cold, 
It hasn’t been the same, 
If I had the chance to be with you one last time, 
I would give up everything, 
But that’s if I had the chance, 
I am crazy for you, 
Yet you too blind to see, 
To see how much I have missed you, 
I am falling for you, 
I am calling you, 
But you never pick up, 
As I break down, 
I never thought I would love someone like you, 
I never knew that love was real in it’s own special way, 
Someday you’ll know what you missed out on. 

I woulde it were not as it is
Or that I cared not yea or no;
I woulde I thoughte it not amiss,
Or that amiss mighte blamles goo;
 I woulde I were, yet woulde I not,
 I mighte be gladd yet coulde I not.


I coulde desire to know the meane
Or that the meane desyre soughte;
I woulde I coulde my fancye weane
From suche sweet joyes as Love hathe wroughte;
 Onlye my wishe is leaste of all
 A badge whereby to know a thrall.


O happy man whiche doste aspire
To that whiche semeleye thou dost crave!
Thrise happy man, if thy desyre
Maye winn with hope good happ to have;
 But woe to me unhappy man
 Whom hope nor happ acquiet cann.


The budds of hope are starvde with feare
And still his foe presents his face;
My state, if hope the palme shoulde beare
Unto my happ woulde be disgrace.
 As diamond in woode were set
 Or Irus raggs in goulde I frett.


For loe my tyred shoulders beare
Desyre's weery beatinge winges;
And at my feet a clogg I weare
Tyde one wth selfe disdayning stringes.
 My wings to mounte aloft make hast.
 My clog doth sinke me downe as faste.


This is our state, loe thus we stande
They ryse to fall that climbe to hye;
The boye that fled kynge Minos lande
Maye learne the wise more love to flye.
 What gaynde his poynte agaynste the sonne
 He drownde in seas himself, that wonne.


Yet Icarus more happy was,
By present deathe his cares to ende
Than I, pore mann, on whom alas
Tenn thousande deathes theire paynes do sende.
 Now greife, now hope, now loue, now spyghte
 Longe sorrows mixte withe shorte delyghte.


The pheere and fellowe of thy smarte
Prometheus I am indeede;
Upon whose ever livinge harte
The greedy gryphes do daylye feede;
 But he that lyfts his harte so hye
 Muste be contente to pine and dye.


Finis. 

I would I were a careless child, 
Still dwelling in my highland cave, 
Or roaming through the dusky wild, 
Or bounding o'er the dark blue wave; 
The cumbrous pomp of Saxon pride 
Accords not with the freeborn soul, 
Which loves the mountain's craggy side, 
And seeks the rocks where billows roll.

Fortune! take back these cultured lands, 
Take back this name of splendid sound! 
I hate the touch of servile hands, 
I hate the slaves that cringe around. 
Place me among the rocks I love, 
Which sound to Ocean's wildest roar; 
I ask but this -- again to rove 
Through scenes my youth hath known before.

Few are my years, and yet I feel 
The world was ne'er designed for me: 
Ah! why do dark'ning shades conceal 
The hour when man must cease to be? 
Once I beheld a splendid dream, 
A visionary scene of bliss: 
Truth! -- wherefore did thy hated beam 
Awake me to a world like this?

I loved -- but those I loved are gone; 
Had friends -- my early friends are fled: 
How cheerless feels the heart alone 
When all its former hopes are dead! 
Though gay companions o'er the bowl 
Dispel awhile the sense of ill; 
Though pleasure stirs the maddening soul, 
The heart -- the heart -- is lonely still.

How dull! to hear the voice of those 
Whom rank or chance, whom wealth or power, 
Have made, though neither friends nor foes, 
Associates of the festive hour. 
Give me again a faithful few, 
In years and feelings still the same, 
And I will fly the midnight crew, 
Where boist'rous joy is but a name.

And woman, lovely woman! thou, 
My hope, my comforter, my all! 
How cold must be my bosom now, 
When e'en thy smiles begin to pall! 
Without a sigh I would resign 
This busy scene of splendid woe, 
To make that calm contentment mine, 
Which virtue knows, or seems to know.

Fain would I fly the haunts of men-- 
I seek to shun, not hate mankind; 
My breast requires the sullen glen, 
Whose gloom may suit a darken'd mind. 
Oh! that to me the wings were given 
Which bear the turtle to her nest! 
Then would I cleave the vault of heaven, 
To flee away and be at rest. 

I would in that sweet bosom be 
(O sweet it is and fair it is!) 
Where no rude wind might visit me. 
Because of sad austerities 
I would in that sweet bosom be. 

I would be ever in that heart 
(O soft I knock and soft entreat her!) 
Where only peace might be my part. 
Austerities were all the sweeter 
So I were ever in that heart. 

I would like
            to be born
                      in every country, 
have a passport
               for them all
to throw
        all foreign offices
                           into panic, 
be every fish
             in every ocean
and every dog
             in the streets of the world.
I don’t want to bow down
                        before any idols
or play at being
                a Russian Orthodox church hippie, 
but I would like to plunge
                          deep into Lake Baikal
and surface snorting
                    somewhere, 
                              why not in the Mississippi? 
In my damned beloved universe
                             I would like
to be a lonely weed, 
                    but not a delicate Narcissus
kissing his own mug
                   in the mirror.
I would like to be
right down to the last mangy hyena-
but never a tyrant
                  or even the cat of a tyrant.
I would like to be
                  reincarnated as a man
                                       in any image: 
a victim of prison tortures, 
a homeless child in the slums of Hong Kong, 
a living skeleton in Bangladesh, 
a holy beggar in Tibet, 
a black in Cape Town, 
but never
         in the image of Rambo.
The only people whom I hate
                           are the hypocrites-
pickled hyenas
              in heavy syrup.
I would like to lie
                   under the knives of all the surgeons in the world, 
be hunchbacked, blind, 
                      suffer all kinds of diseases, 
                                                   wounds and scars, 
be a victim of war, 
                   or a sweeper of cigarette butts, 
just so a filthy microbe of superiority
                                       doesn’t creep inside.
I would not like to be in the elite, 
nor, of course, 
               in the cowardly herd, 
nor be a guard dog of that herd, 
nor a shepherd, 
               sheltered by that herd.
And I would like happiness, 
                           but not at the expense of the unhappy, 
and I would like freedom, 
                         but not at the expense of the unfree.
I would like to love
                    all the women in the world, 
and I would like to be a woman, too-
                                     just once. 
Men have been diminished
                        by Mother Nature.
Why couldn’t we give motherhood
                               to men? 
If an innocent child
                    stirred
                           below his heart, 
man would probably
                  not be so cruel.
I would like to be man’s daily bread-
say, 
    a cup of rice
                 for a Vietnamese woman in mourning, 
cheap wine
          in a Neapolitan workers’ trattoria, 
or a tiny tube of cheese
                        in orbit round the moon.
Let them eat me, 
                let them drink me, 
only let my death
                 be of some use.
I would like to belong to all times, 
                                    shock all history so much
that it would be amazed
                       what a smart aleck I was.
I would like to bring Nefertiti
                               to Pushkin in a troika.
I would like to increase
                        the space of a moment
                                             a hundredfold, 
so that in the same moment
                          I could drink vodka with fishermen in Siberia
and sit together with Homer, 
                            Dante, 
                                  Shakespeare, 
                                              and Tolstoy, 
drinking anything, 
                  except, of course, 
                                    Coca-Cola, 
-dance to the tom-toms in the Congo, 
-strike at Renault, 
-chase a ball with Brazilian boys
                                  at Copacabana Beach.
I would like to know every language, 
                                like the secret waters under the earth, 
and do all kinds of work at once.
                                 I would make sure
that one Yevtushenko was merely a poet, 
                                 the second-an underground fighter
                                                             somewhere, 
I couldn’t say where
                    for security reasons, 
the third-a student at Berkeley, 
                                 the fourth-a jolly Georgian drinker, 
and the fifth-
               maybe a teacher of Eskimo children in Alaska, 
the sixth-
       a young president, 
                    somewhere, say, modestly speaking, in Sierra Leone, 
the seventh-
             would still be shaking a rattle in his stroller, 
and the tenth. 
                the hundredth. 
                                the millionth. 
For me it’s not enough to be myself, 
                                    let me be everyone! 
Every creature
              usually has a double, 
                  with the carbon paper, 
and in his Paradise Publishing Corporation
                                          made a unique copy of me.
But I shall muddle up
I shall be in a thousand copies to the end of my days, 
so that the earth buzzes with me, 
                                 and computers go berserk
in the world census of me.
I would like to fight on all your barricades, 
                                             humanity, 
dying each night
                like an exhausted moon, 
and resurrecting each morning
                             like a newborn sun, 
with an immortal soft spot-fontanel-
                                      on my head.
And when I die, 
               a smart-aleck Siberian Francois Villon, 
do not lay me in the earth
                          of France
                                   or Italy, 
but in our Russian, Siberian earth, 
                                   on a still-green hill, 
where I first felt
                  that I was
                            everyone.


I would live in your love as the sea-grasses live in the sea, 
Borne up by each wave as it passes, drawn down by each wave that recedes; 
I would empty my soul of the dreams that have gathered in me, 
I would beat with your heart as it beats, I would follow your soul as it leads. 

I would not be a king--enough
Of woe it is to love;
The path to power is steep and rough,
And tempests reign above.
I would not climb the imperial throne; 
’Tis built on ice which fortune’s sun
Thaws in the height of noon.
Then farewell, king, yet were I one,
Care would not come so soon.
Would he and I were far away 
Keeping flocks on Himalay

If I could only paint the fate of thee, , , 
Their lament, all night they weep, , , 
I engrave their agony in my heart, , , 
And let my faith inscribes, so be it, , , 
They restore their strength by faith. 

I wrote a good omelet.  

and ate 
a hot poem.  after loving you
Buttoned my car.  

and drove my 
coat home.  

in the rain.  
after loving you
I goed on red.  

and stopped on 
green.  

floating somewhere in between.  
being here and being there.  
after loving you
I rolled my bed.  

turned down 
my hair.  

slightly 
confused but.  

I don't care. 
Laid out my teeth.  

and gargled my 
gown.  

then I stood 
.  

and laid me down. 
To sleep.  
after loving you


I WROTE NOTHING TODAY

I wrote nothing today
I did not do my work
I played around 
I read what I wanted
I searched the Internet for nonsense
I did not face the work and reality I have 
I wrote nothing today
I did nothing today
I am to blame
The world will fall apart
The sky will never be blue again
The night will go on forever
No birds will sing and no rivers will flow
All the trees will lose their green-
 
I did nothing today
It's all over 
I did nothing today and I am nothing and I will forever be nothing
And I am ashamed of being nothing and guilty for being nothing 
And still I am nothing 
And writing this does not make me something either
Because it is not the work I am supposed to do
Which I am still escaping 
What a loser I am 
What a failure- 

After this tirade 
Will I at last have the courage to begin the real work now

I wrote on a page of light; 
it vanished.
then there was night.

then there was night and
I heard the lullabies
and then there were dreams.

and when you woke
there were roses, lilies
things so rare a someone so silvery spoke, 

or was spoken into the silvery air that

you couldn't learn words for them
fast enough.
and then, 

you wrote on a page of light.

Poems about what rejection means
I wrote poems about the love of language
And poems about the love of life
And also Poetry of Fear Worry Despair Sorrow Sadness Pain Loss 
I wrote poems about what I knew
And what I most cared about 
I wrote them without recognition and without real acceptance
Perhaps they are all nothing
And not real poetry
And I am a delusion a made-up thing real only to myself
Perhaps I am not a poet at all
But only for years someone trying to be a poet and failing
Perhaps this matters so much and perhaps it matters nothing at all
I lived my life in this way
Perhaps that matters
The man who tried to be  a poet 
And was no poet at all
Yet lived his life as a poet
And wrote his soul and his years away


I WROTE THIS POEM AND THAT POEM AND ANOTHER POEM AGAIN

I wrote this poem and that poem and another poem again 
The world of poetry was open to me 
And I could go on and on in it
It was a dream come true 
A world which opened when I moved through it
A place I wanted to be 
A place of beauty and peace and spirit and imagination 
A good good place
The world of poetry was open to me
And as I wrote my way through it 
And I should at least know enough to be grateful for it-I wrung my hands under my dark veil. . .
"Why are you pale, what makes you reckless?"
-- Because I have made my loved one drunk
with an astringent sadness.

I'll never forget. He went out, reeling;
his mouth was twisted, desolate. . .
I ran downstairs, not touching the banisters,
and followed him as far as the gate.

And shouted, choking: "I meant it all
in fun. Don't leave me, or I'll die of pain

"
He smiled at me -- oh so calmly, terribly --
and said: "Why don't you get out of the rain?"ONE DAY I THOUGHT OF LEAVING 
, 
IT WAS A MOMENT.. I CLOSED MY EYES, 

MY SELF WAS TORN TO PIECES, 

APART OF ME WAS TAKEN AWAY.. 

THAT MOMENT I SAW A CRYING ORPHAN

BEGGING ME TO STAY. 

I FOUND MY SELF SURROUNDED BY ALL OF YOU, 

. YOUR TEARS FILLED MY EYES.

AND IN MY TURN STARTED TO CRY, 

HOW I FORGOT THAT MY PLACE AS HIGH THERE IN THE SKY

HE WHISPERED TO ME YOU ARE THE GIVER 
AND YOU WILL NEVER BE A MISER, 

IN YOUR EYES I SAW MY TOUCH HEALING YOU, 

WATCHFUL EYES GUARDING YOU, 

WHEN THE SKY WILL BE MEAN..

. 

I'M THE RAIN IN YOUR DESERT, 

THE SHINY SUN IN A STORMY WAY, 

I'M THE COVER IN THE LONEl


Y

NIGHTS, 

I'M THE BREEZE IN A SUMMER DAY. 

WE 

AS IT MAY SEEM FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE

WE ARE THE GUIDE FOR THE LOST IN UN KNOWN LAND, 

WE MAINTAIN OUR MOTTO PLEDGE TO PROVIDE THE NEEDY

NO ONE SHAKES US,

THE BLURRED PICTURES STARTED TO BE MORE CLEAR.  

Unhappy verse, the witness of my unhappy state,
Make thy self flutt'ring wings of thy fast flying
Thought, and fly forth unto my love, wheresoever she be:
Whether lying restless in heavy bed, or else
Sitting so cheerless at the cheerful board, or else
Playing alone careless on her heavenly virginals.
If in bed, tell her, that my eyes can take no rest:
If at board, tell her, that my mouth can eat no meat:
If at her virginals, tell her, I can hear no mirth.
Asked why? say: waking love suffereth no sleep:
Say that raging love doth appal the weak stomach:
Say, that lamenting love marreth the musical.
Tell her, that her pleasures were wont to lull me asleep:
Tell her, that her beauty was wont to feed mine eyes:
Tell her, that her sweet tongue was wont to make me mirth.
Now do I nightly waste, wanting my kindly rest:
Now do I daily starve, wanting my lively food:
Now do I always die, wanting thy timely mirth.
And if I waste, who will bewail my heavy chance?
And if I starve, who will record my cursed end?
And if I die, who will say: "This was Immerito"

We are the ones
who fly too close to the sun, 
with grace and such powerful ease.

Stopping to thank
the ones below
for never doing as they please.

The heat of the sun fills us all up
to the brim with joy and delight, 
and so we keep flying for as long as we can
'til we forget the dark of the night.

Soon the first feather begins to fall
and then a couple more, 
the wings that dear old dad made for us
will now take us to the shore.

Falling first, from the clear skies, 
we crash down to the sea.
Below still waters are beasts aplenty, 
waiting for you and me.

We fought them as we fought for life
we fought 'til we grew sore
gills, in fact, grew on our sides
so we could fight some more.

And so our plight had turned us into beasts
with a strangeness protruding from our heart
still we weren't discouraged in the least
to swim on back to the grimy start


Karen Soto(in memory of the space shuttle Challenger disaster, January   

[to my Grandfather, Milton B. Young-
and to my father, Robert R. Douglas-]

if only he had fallen in love with the moon.
I sometimes dream of him that way, 
in the winters since.

that cherishing starlight
kept him alive.
but he was a summer dreamer

all in all. a daylit king
bringing us gilded toys back
from the Fairs

or gold wrapped candies
in the atriums where we watched for him
or on the field flowered hills.

oh that we had sprinkled his waxwork wings
with guardian frosts in the long midnights, 
the horrid things

but when? 
he never slept.

it's so hard looking back.
we'll wear green ribands, 
sheens of mint-

paler than oceans' crests, diminishing.
over the wreckage
or pale blue ripples out toward

Arcturus-
playing swing-a-statue on
the attic lawns 

if only to dream till dawn
among ourselves in a code that won't redress: 
far far from the choric voices of the sun: 

to wish. and wish.
there have been another quest-

another flight than this one

How comes it then that this her cold so great
Is not dissolved through my so hot desire,
But harder grows the more I her entreat?
Or how comes it that my exceeding heat
Is not allayed by her heart-frozen cold,
But that I burn much more in boiling sweat,
And feel my flames augmented manifold?
What more miraculous thing may be told,
That fire, which all things melts, should harden ice,
And ice, which is congeal'd with senseless cold,
Should kindle fire by wonderful device?
Such is the power of love in gentle mind,
That it can alter all the course of kind. 

A sleepy little village, quiet
You look out the window
Daydreaming
In your eyes disquiet

So many sleepless nights
I have dreams about you
I must get some sleep
To dream you true
 
I awaken at dawn 
To find you beside me
I'm still half asleep
Keep me awake blue sea 

Being soul mate
This is
More than a pipe dream 
Oh dreamy blue eyes
Give me an ice cream! 

()My mom's hair is made of Chocolate Ice Cream.
My dad's hair is made of Mint Ice Cream.

A threat in winter
The streets become dangerous
My drinks watered down. 

Sally is just a typical woman and nosy
Upon reading this note - ICE Sally
and with her contact phone number
She got furious like a tiger, after
reading it from contact page of her husband cell phone
She summoned the husband, demanded for a reason
Why she is being iced, dumped or to divorce her? 
The husband just laughed at her
He said; Sally you are really so snoopy
ICE is short for - In Case of Emergency_________OVERTURE___________ 

In engaging a walk, 'pon a Winter's crisp morn, 
On a snow-feathered path, 
Draped by ice-ladened branches, 
My eye's found a pond of most striking impression- 
Mother Nature's touch of December's bliss; 
Crystalized Ice in the shape of a Heart, 
An ardor of Winter's majesty.


___________SCAPE__________

____________ | ____________

Subtle breezes stir the pines, 
As i approach the glaced pond.
Wafts of snow leave their landing 
My face [looking up] is bedaubed 
By a freckling of snowmist.
And the pond, an image of celestial capture, 
Is a figuration of amorous grandeur.


____________ | | ____________

Its surface iced and hued in shades of silver and amber; 
Like a prism slowly rising to the call of the new day.
A spindrifting breeze
Snares the cusp of my nose- 
And my eyes close.
The wind changes course.  

my ear's are alerted
To a clarion whispering about me.


______DANCE OF THE ICE______ 

_____________ | ____________
Opening my eyes with anxious emotion, 
I behold a most utopic image.
'Tis a Maiden donned softly in white linen gown, 
Kneeling, poised, at the edge of the pond.
Lacing gold bladed skates, with pearl-studded leather, 
Reflecting their beauty, off the Suns morning glare. 
Nodding her head, she acknowledges my presence. 
And my heart, skips a beat, as our eyes connect. 

_____________ | | ___________

I respond with a shy, boyish grin; 
A curling, sweet smile adorns her flawless visage.
She engages the Ice.  

spins, begins her dance; 
Swirling, encircling, captured in whimsy, 
Each movement a freeze-frame of eloquence.
My breath far behind me, as she raises her arms, 
And with her eyes, she beckons me closer. 
Closer yet.

Sweat on my temples, Sun gaining strength.

Mother Nature no friend now, to my Lady of Ice; 
I must counter and find her a cold winter shadow.
And, stumbling to the pond, alas I reach, but descry- 
A puddle.  chilled mudied water.  my Maiden, begone. 
Teardrops from my wincing eye in unashamed sorrow; 
The wonder if my Lady escaped her arctic eclipse - 
The soulburning Hope, I will see her dance once again.


____________HOPING____________
Now, I sit by this pond, 
awaiting the sunfall
and, night's frosted stage, 
For my Icedancer's Encore.

Than as I walked away from you that evening.
The forest swallowed me, the blue forest, ma soeur
The blue forest and above it pale stars in the west.

I did not laugh, not one little bit, ma soeur
As I playfully walked towards a dark fate -
While the faces behind me
Slowly paled in the evening of the blue forest.

Everything was grand that one night, ma soeur
Never thereafter and never before -
I admit it: I was left with nothing but the big birds
And their hungry cries in the dark evening sky. 

as thick as the earth
as hard as rock

my love for her 
is not fought

for once I saw
her beautiful smile

I couldn't let go
I knew wouldn't! ! 

her eyes so blue
her soul so pure

I knew.  

that for once in my life
I was not being teased or made fun of.

Ich Liebe Dich


Accreted phase shift
Reflecting and refracting
Serrating the eaves


Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too, 
Went for a ride in a flying shoe, 
'Hooray!' 
'What fun!' 
'It's time we flew!' 
Said Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too. 

Ickle was captain, Pickle was crew, 
And Tickle served coffee and mulligan stew 
As higher 
And higher 
And higher they flew, 
Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too. 

Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too, 
Over the sun and beyond the blue. '
Hold on!' 
'Stay in!' 
'I hope we do!' 
Cried Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too. 

Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too 
Never returned to the world they knew, 
And nobody 
knows what's 
happened to 
Dear Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too. 

Pointing dishes at galactic streams.
Sighing stars, echo faintly screams.

Deep in vistas amid glimmering clouds, 
incredible happenings in weird shrouds.

Translucent haze of billowing dust.
Worlds apart from our baking crust.

Collapse, group, twirls expands.
at once at bay with unseen strands.

Unfolding guise, deep abysmal depths.
A balance is kept in peeking stealths.

Traveler silhouetted on lonely moor.
Watches agog at his life and tour.

Gazes above at amazing shows.
Coaxing teams as he lifts and ploughs.

Unassuming mundane or regal garb! 
Tuned to melodious chimes or jesting barb! 

My enterprise afoot at warping speed, 
Zipping past, vantage seat on done deed.

Puny, naked, trivial I stand.
An icon of will in so much sand.

june,Buraydah-KSACrashing into icy waves, 
as I swim through your veins.

Each frigid beat reminds me, 
I'll never wash away these stains.

The ebb and flow I meet here
are certainly doing their part.

They might just convince me 
that you still have a heart.

Blessed are the heartless, 
Heart-broken they'll never be.

But I keep swimming hopeful
that there's still hope for me. 

You cannot proceed with what you never started
You cannot be the king of someone else’s throne
Nor claim to have the answers to all and everything they’ll ever ask
So what makes you shine brighter then the rest? 
What makes you seem so powerful and so untouchable? 

I’m not afraid to approach you from the front
Nor am I scared to say this to your face
I will not hide
Nor will I lie
I am not afraid to be exactly what I am
I’m not another manufactured product of your factory of greed
You cannot keep me down

The time will come when many more of me will spur
Spur out of the dust and smoke from your firing idiocy and superficial love
You won’t have any place to run, or hide behind
You won’t be able to kill us
We are bulletproof
Ideas are everlasting


I knew too that through them I knew too that he was through, I knew too that he threw them. I knew too that they were through, I knew too I knew too, I knew I knew them.
        I knew to them.

        If they tear a hunter through, if they tear through a hunter, if they tear through a hunt and a hunter, if they tear through different sizes of the six, the different sizes of the six which are these, a woman with a white package under one arm and a black package under the other arm and dressed in brown with a white blouse, the second Saint Joseph the third a hunter in a blue coat and black garters and a plaid cap, a fourth a knife grinder who is full faced and a very little woman with black hair and a yellow hat and an excellently smiling appropriate soldier. All these as you please.

        In the meantime examples of the same lily. In this way please have you rung.
 

WHAT DO I SEE?

        A very little snail.

        A medium sized turkey.

        A small band of sheep.

        A fair orange tree.

        All nice wives are like that.

        Listen to them from here.

        Oh.

        You did not have an answer.

        Here.

        Yes.
 

A VERY VALENTINE.

        Very fine is my valentine.

        Very fine and very mine.

        Very mine is my valentine very mine and very fine.

        Very fine is my valentine and mine, very fine very mine and mine is my valentine.
 

WHY DO YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY.

        Why do you feel differently about a very little snail and a big one.

        Why do you feel differently about a medium sized turkey and a very large one.

        Why do you feel differently about a small band of sheep and several sheep that are riding.

        Why do you feel differently about a fair orange tree and one that has blossoms as well.

        Oh very well.

        All nice wives are like that.

KNEELING

        One two three four five six seven eight nine and ten.

        The tenth is a little one kneeling and giving away a rooster with this feeling.

        I have mentioned one, four five seven eight and nine.

        Two is also giving away an animal.

        Three is changed as to disposition.

        Six is in question if we mean mother and daughter, black and black caught her, and she offers to be three she offers it to me.

        That is very right and should come out below and just so.
 

BUNDLES FOR THEM.

A HISTORY OF GIVING BUNDLES.

        We are able to notice that each one in a way carried a bundle, they were not a trouble to them nor were they all bundles as some of them were chickens some of them pheasants some of them sheep and some of them bundles, they were not a trouble to them and then indeed we learned that it was the principal recreation and they were so arranged that they were not given away, and to-day they were given away.

        I will not look at them again.

        They will not look for them again.

        They have not seen them here again.

        They are in there and we hear them again.

        In which way are stars brighter than they are. When we have come to this decision. We mention many thousands of buds. And when I close my eyes I see them.
 

        If you hear her snore

        It is not before you love her

        You love her so that to be her beau is very lovely

        She is sweetly there and her curly hair is very lovely

        She is sweetly here and I am very near and that is very lovely.

        She is my tender sweet and her little feet are stretched out well which is a treat and very lovely

        Her little tender nose is between her little eyes which close and are very lovely.

        She is very lovely and mine which is very lovely.
 

ON HER WAY.

        If you can see why she feel that she kneels if you can see why he knows that he shows what he bestows, if you can see why they share what they share, need we question that there is no doubt that by this time if they had intended to come they would have sent some notice of such intention. She and they and indeed the decision itself is not early dissatisfaction.
 

IN THIS WAY.

        Keys please, it is useless to alarm any one it is useless to alarm some one it is useless to be alarming and to get fertility in gardens in salads in heliotrope and in dishes. Dishes and wishes are mentioned and dishes and wishes are not capable of darkness. We like sheep. And so does he. 
 

                                                                  LET US DESCRIBE.
         Let us describe how they went. It was a very windy night and the road although in excellent condition and extremely well graded has many turnings and although the curves are not sharp the rise is considerable. It was a very windy night and some of the larger vehicles found it more prudent not to venture. In consequence some of those who had planned to go were unable to do so. Many others did go and there was a sacrifice, of what shall we, a sheep, a hen, a cock, a village, a ruin, and all that and then that having been blessed let us bless it. 

It’s good you came—she says.
You heard a plane crashed on Thursday?
Well so they came to see me
about it.
The story is he was on the passenger list.
So what, he might have changed his mind.
They gave me some pills so I wouldn’t fall apart.
Then they showed me I don’t know who.
All black, burned except one hand.
A scrap of shirt, a watch, a wedding ring.
I got furious, that can’t be him.
He wouldn’t do that to me, look like that.
The stores are bursting with those shirts.
The watch is just a regular old watch.
And our names on that ring,
they’re only the most ordinary names.
It’s good you came. Sit here beside me.
He really was supposed to get back Thursday.
But we’ve got so many Thursdays left this year.
I’ll put the kettle on for tea.
I’ll wash my hair, then what,
try to wake up from all this.
It’s good you came, since it was cold there,
and him just in some rubber sleeping bag,
him, I mean, you know, that unlucky man.
I’ll put the Thursday on, wash the tea,
since our names are completely ordinary—I am an uncaged bird 
Flying in your blue sky 
And bathing
In the golden sunshine 
To taste the freedom of life. 

I am the cool wind 
Coming out 
Of the vast sea 
To comfort 
Your scorching heart. 

I am a sweet bud of rose 
Blossoming
In your morn light
To spread sweet fragrance 
In your heart. 

I am the silver light 
Of the full moon 
Travelling at midnight 
In the sky of your mind 
To make it bright. 

I am the lover 
Of Love 
Worshipping you 
Round the clock
With the flowers of my heart. 

I was looking for identity.
I felt the silent of my soul.
No answer.
I looked at the stars one by one.
They asked for identity too. 

SOMEWHERE--in desolate wind-swept space-- 
In Twilight-land--in No-man's land-- 
Two hurrying Shapes met face to face, 
And bade each other stand. 
 
"And who are you?" cried one a-gape, 
Shuddering in the gloaming light. 
"I know not," said the second Shape, 
"I only died last night!"This is to the motherland
Where I have been born
This is to the teacher
Who taught me nothing
This is to my lover
Who turned away from me
Many are there to address
These few are to notice.

What you have taught? 
Why you came in? 
Why I opened my eyes mother! 
Hybridity, Modernization, Temporary
You all have lost me
Lost your identity in my life. 

When Hans Hofmann became a hedgehog
somewhere in a Germany that has
vanished with its forests and hedgerows
Shakespeare would have been a young actor
starting out in a country that was
only a word to Hans who had learned
from those who had painted animals
only from hearing tales about them
without ever setting eyes on them
or from corpses with the lingering
light mute and deathly still forever
held fast in the fur or the feathers
hanging or lying on a table
and he had learned from others who had
arranged the corpses of animals
as though they were still alive in full
flight or on their way but this hedgehog
was there in the same life as his own
looking around at him with his brush
of camel hair and his stretched parchment
of sheepskin as he turned to each sharp
particular quill and every black
whisker on the long live snout and those
flat clawed feet made only for trundling
and for feeling along the dark undersides
of stones and as Hans took them in he
turned into the Hans that we would see


Identity is not what I promise others
Identity is what I do when I am alone
Identity is what I think of others
Knowing all the hatred they've shown
 
Identity is what every wound reminds me
Identity is what I learn and what I pass by
Identity is what I see in the mirror
After giving my best try
 
Identity is what I make out of my given chance
Identity is what I accept and what I deny
No one else has control over me
Life is about me, and what I identify


I am fighting furiously with animals and bottles
In a short time perhaps ten hours have passed one
 after another
The beautiful swimmer who was afraid of coral wakes
 this morning
Coral crowned with holly knocks on her door
Ah! coal again always coal
I conjure you coal tutelary genius of dreams and my
 solitude let me let me speak again of the beautiful
 swimmer who was afraid of coral
No longer tyrannize this seductive subject of my
 dreams
The beautiful swimmer was reposing in a bed of lace
 and birds
The clothes on a chair at the foot of the bed were
 illuminated by gleams the last gleams of coal
The one that had come from the depths of the sky and 
 earth and sea was proud of its coral beak and great
 wings of crape
All night long it had followed divergent funerals toward
 suburban cemeteries
It had been to embassy balls marked white satin gowns with
 its imprint a fern leaf
It had risen terribly before ships and the ships had not 
 returned
Now crouched in the chimney it was watching for the 
 waking of foam and singing of kettles
Its resounding step had disturbed the silence of nights
 in streets with sonorous pavements
Sonorous coal coal master of dreams coal
Ah tell me where is that beautiful swimmer the swimmer
 who was afraid of coral?
But the swimmer herself has gone back to sleep
And I remain face to face with the fire and shall remain
 through the night interrogating the coal with wings of
 darkness that persists in projecting on my monotonous
 road the shadow of its smoke and the terrible 
 reflections of its embers
Sonorous coal coal pitiless coal


I suffer from the worldliness
I suffer in silence
A loss of identity
Adience 

I think
You give me 
A sense of identity
Love

(Slipping into your shoes
I rummaged through your litter
I found your name and postal code
and had a little titter.

Your credit card had almost dried.
Oh! No need to apologise, 
the bank was eager to oblige, 
and raised your credit to the skies.

Shredders are so popular, 
they're going cheap at Curry's. 
Go and buy one soon I say
you'll make it if you hurry.

I bought a TV there today
a laptop just for fun! 
Pity, such a pity that
you couldn't come. 

We had our jolts, numbing bolts.
Abortive muted true revolts.
Many tsunamis had us pound, 
Ever since history had us found.
Babers of yon had their stakes.
Babers today just lowly fakes.
Baring canines every now and then.
But unstoppable whir the arms of Ben.
And their Consigliere; a so called man.
All! Sollozzo the Turk and sponsored fan.
His hunger is more then a zillion mouths.
His entourage scary teeming uncouths
A practiced, haunting toothy smirk, 
Hides his face and the cavalier jerk.
Now shamelessly running from pillar to post.
Fed some few with cuisine and roast.
Belches and bravado from the rotund ones.
Fourth estate's talks and nauseating puns.
On the rim of a cauldron's stench bobs.
The black coats messiah sulks and sobs.
Scrunch! Goose foot; phalanxes start to march.
Sadly pointing to the ides of March.

(Islamabad)I KNOW not how it is, I have the knack, 
In lazy moods, of seeking no excuse; 
But holding that man's ease must be the juice 
Of man's philosophy, I give the sack 
To thought, and lounge at shuffle on the track 
Of what employment seems of the least use: 
And in such ways I find a constant sluice 
For drowzy humours. Be thou loth to rack 
And hack thy brain for thought, which may lurk there 
Or may not. Without pain of thought, the eyes 
Can see, the ears can hear, the sultry mouth 
Can taste the summer's favour. Towards the South 
Let earth sway round, while this my body lies 
In warmth, and has the sun on face and hair. 

I would not wish the burning blaze
Of fame around a restless world,
The thunder and the storm of praise
In crowded tumults heard and hurled.
I would not be a flower to stand
The stare of every passer-bye;
But in some nook of fairyland,
Seen in the praise of beauty's eye. 

How in these most idle moments 
I breathe out all negativity 
Inhale positive energy


Down in the pine needles
in the snowstorm-stogged ravine
an Evenki idol stands
fixing his eyes on the taiga.

Aggressively squinting, 
he watched until the time came
when Evenki women started
hauling presents to him.

they brought him honey and fur, 
figuring that he’d pray
but mainly think for them all.

In the dark assurance
that he’d understand, 
they’d smear his mouth
with warm deer blood.

But what could he do, the phony
little god, 
with his fierce, wooden
whittled-down soul? 

Now he’s looking through the branches, 
abandoned and dead.
No one believes in him; 
no one prays to him.

Did I just dream this up? At night
in his ravine, far off yonder, 
he sets his eyes
on fire, overgrown with moss, 

And listening to the snowstorm
blast down, licks
He wants blood.




Celebrating our common humanity
i am inspired by a seemingly endless divinity
Drawing on the information of my muse
Pen in hand i write of an 'imagined' eternity; 
 
An eternity of blessed souls and warriors
Gathering together as a union of 'one'
While removing all of the evils practiced under the sun; 


You know the ones linked to idol worship
The ones that cast spells  and curses of harm
The black witches of 'abstract and ugly'
The cold-blooded-'Amoral'-that are cause for alarm


Ending their accrued 'vile and hurtful'
Erasing these 'Blackbirds' of gloom
Wiping clean the scarlet stains they leave behind

Satan get thee behind us
We deny you any entrance in
Leaving you to receive the consequences of your egregious sins; 



July   weighed your virtues 
with a heart heavy with love —
now you are common


A fascinating woman in blue of skies
Kindness cord with her scented ringlets ties
Love's bird towards her arc of brows flies
Life water in her dimple supplies
Idols of paradise 
Are mesmerized by her bewitching hazel eyes

(Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel, and lower the proud;
  Turn thy wild wheel thro' sunshine, storm, and cloud;
  Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate. 

        Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;
  With that wild wheel we go not up or down;
  Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great. 

        Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;
  Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;
  For man is man and master of his fate. 

        Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;
  Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud;
  Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate. 

Dagonet, the fool, whom Gawain in his mood
    Had made mock-knight of Arthur's Table Round,
    At Camelot, high above the yellowing woods,
    Danced like a wither'd leaf before the hall.
    And toward him from the hall, with harp in hand,
    And from the crown thereof a carcanet
    Of ruby swaying to and fro, the prize
    Of Tristram in the jousts of yesterday,
    Came Tristram, saying, "Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?"

       For Arthur and Sir Lancelot riding once
   Far down beneath a winding wall of rock
   Heard a child wail. A stump of oak half-dead.
   From roots like some black coil of carven snakes,
   Clutch'd at the crag, and started thro' mid air
   Bearing an eagle's nest: and thro' the tree
   Rush'd ever a rainy wind, and thro' the wind
   Pierced ever a child's cry: and crag and tree
   Scaling, Sir Lancelot from the perilous nest,
   This ruby necklace thrice around her neck,
   And all unscarr'd from beak or talon, brought
   A maiden babe; which Arthur pitying took,
   But coldly acquiescing, in her white arms
   Received, and after loved it tenderly,
   And named it Nestling; so forgot herself
   A moment, and her cares; till that young life
   Being smitten in mid heaven with mortal cold
   Past from her; and in time the carcanet
   Vext her with plaintive memories of the child:
   So she, delivering it to Arthur, said,
   "Take thou the jewels of this dead innocence,
   And make them, an thou wilt, a tourney-prize


       To whom the King, "Peace to thine eagle-borne
   Dead nestling, and this honour after death,
   Why ye not wear on arm, or neck, or zone
   Those diamonds that I rescued from the tarn,
   And Lancelot won, methought, for thee to wear


       "Would rather you had let them fall," she cried,
   "Plunge and be lost--ill-fated as they were,
   A bitterness to me!--ye look amazed,
   Not knowing they were lost as soon as given--
   Slid from my hands, when I was leaning out
   Above the river--that unhappy child
   Past in her barge: but rosier luck will go
   With these rich jewels, seeing that they came
   Not from the skeleton of a brother-slayer,
   But the sweet body of a maiden babe.
   Perchance--who knows?--the purest of thy knights
   May win them for the purest of my maids


       She ended, and the cry of a great jousts
   With trumpet-blowings ran on all the ways
   From Camelot in among the faded fields
   To furthest towers; and everywhere the knights
   Arm'd for a day of glory before the King.

       But on the hither side of that loud morn
   Into the hall stagger'd, his visage ribb'd
   From ear to ear with dogwhip-weals, his nose
   Bridge-broken, one eye out, and one hand off,
    And one with shatter'd fingers dangling lame,
   A churl, to whom indignantly the King,

   Hath drawn his claws athwart thy face? or fiend?
   Man was it who marr'd heaven's image in thee thus?"

       Then, sputtering thro' the hedge of splinter'd teeth,
   Yet strangers to the tongue, and with blunt stump
   Pitch-blacken'd sawing the air, said the maim'd churl,

       "He took them and he drave them to his tower--
   Some hold he was a table-knight of thine--
   A hundred goodly ones--the Red Knight, he--
   Brake in upon me and drave them to his tower;
   And when I cal'd upon thy name as one
   That doest right by gentle and by churl,
   Maim'd me and maul'd, and would outright have slain,
   Save that he aware me to a message, saying,
   'Tell thou the King and all his liars, that I
   Have founded my Round Table in the North,
   And whatsoever his own knights have sworn
   My knights have sworn the counter to it--and say
   My tower is full of harlots, like his court,
   But mine are worthier, seeing they profess
   To be none other than themselves--and say
   My knights are all adulterers like his own,
   But mine are truer, seeing they profess
   To be none other; and say his hour is come,
   The heathen are upon him, his long lance
   Broken, and his Excalibur a straw.' "

       Then Arthur turn'd to Kay the seneschal,
   "Take thou my churl, and tend him curiously
   Like a king's heir, till all his hurts be whole.
   The heathen--but that ever-climbing wave,
   Hurl'd back again so often in empty foam,
   Hath lain for years at rest--and renegades,
   Thieves, bandits, leavings of confusion, whom
   The wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere,
   Friends, thro' your manhood and your fealty,--now
   Make their last head like Satan in the North.
   My younger knights, new-made, in whom your flower
  Waits to be solid fruit of golden deeds,
  Move with me toward their quelling, which achieved,
  The loneliest ways are safe from shore to shore.
  But thou, Sir Lancelot, sitting in my place
  Enchair'd to-morrow, arbitrate the field;
  For wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with it
  Speak, Lancelot, thou art silent: is it well?"


     Thereto Sir Lancelot answer'd, "It is well:
  Yet better if the King abide, and leave
  The leading of his younger knights to me.
  Else, for the King has will'd it, it is well



     Then Arthur rose and Lancelot follow'd him,
  And while they stood without the doors, the King
  Turn'd to him saying, "Is it then so well?
  Or mine the blame that oft I seem as he
  Of whom was written, 'A sound is in his ears'?
  The foot that loiters, bidden go,--the glance
  That only seems half-loyal to command,--
  A manner somewhat fall'n from reverence--
  Or have I dream'd the bearing of our knights
  Tells of a manhood ever less and lower?
  Or whence the fear lest this my realm, uprear'd,
  By noble deeds at one with noble vows,
  From flat confusion and brute violence,s
  Reel back into the beast, and be no more?"


     He spoke, and taking all his younger knights,
  Down the slope city rode, and sharply turn'd
  Working a tapestry, lifted up her head,
  Watch'd her lord pass, and knew not that she sigh'd.
  Then ran across her memory the strange rhyme
  Of bygone Merlin, "Where is he who knows?
  From the great deep to the great deep he goes



     But when the morning of a tournament,
  By these in earnest those in mockery call'd
  The Tournament of the Dead Innocence,
  Brake with a wet wind blowing, Lancelot,
  Round whose sick head all night, like birds of prey,
  The words of Arthur flying shriek'd, arose,
  And down a streetway hung with folds of pure
  White samite, and by fountains running wine,
  Where children sat in white with cups of gold,
  Moved to the lists, and there, with slow sad steps
  Ascending, fill'd his double-dragon'd chair.


     He glanced and saw the stately galleries,
  White-robed in honour of the stainless child,
  And some with scatter'd jewels, like a bank
  Of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire.
  He look'd but once, and vail'd his eyes again.


     The sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream
  To ears but half-awaked, then one low roll
  Of Autumn thunder, and the jousts began:
  And ever the wind blew, and yellowing leaf
  And gloom and gleam, and shower and shorn plume
  Went down it. Sighing weariedly, as one
  Who sits and gazes on a faded fire,
  When all the goodlier guests are past away,
  Sat their great umpire, looking o'er the lists.
  He saw the laws that ruled the tournament
  Broken, but spake not; once, a knight cast down
  Before his throne of arbitration cursed
  The dead babe and the follies of the King;
  And once the laces of a helmet crack'd,
  And show'd him, like a vermin in its hole,
  Modred, a narrow face: anon he heard
  The voice that billow'd round the barriers roar
  An ocean-sounding welcome to one knight,
  But newly-enter'd, taller than the rest,
  And armour'd all in forest green, whereon
  There tript a hundred tiny silver deer,
  And wearing but a holly-spray for crest,
  With ever-scattering berries, and on shield
  A spear, a harp, a bugle--Tristram--late
  From overseas in Brittany return'd,
  And marriage with a princess of that realm,
  Isolt the White--Sir Tristram of the Woods--
  Whom Lancelot knew, had held sometime with pain
  His own against him, and now yearn'd to shake
  The burthen off his heart in one full shock
  With Tristram ev'n to death: his strong hands gript
  And dinted the gilt dragons right and left,
  Until he groan'd for wrath--so many of those,
  That ware their ladies' colours on the casque,
  Drew from before Sir Tristram to the bounds,
  And there with gibes and flickering mockeries
  Stood, while he mutter'd, "Craven crests! O shame!
  What faith have these in whom they sware to love?
  The glory of our Round Table is no more



     So Tristram won, and Lancelot gave, the gems,
  Not speaking other word than "Hast thou won?
  Art thou the purest, brother? See, the hand
  Wherewith thou takest this, is red!" to whom
  Tristram, half plagued by Lancelot's languorous mood,
  Made answer, "Ay, but wherefore toss me this
  Like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound?
  And might of limb, but mainly use and skill,
  Are winners in this pastime of our King.
  My hand--belike the lance hath dript upon it--
  No blood of mine, I trow; but O chief knight,
  Right arm of Arthur in the battlefield,
  Great brother, thou nor I have made the world;



     And Tristram round the gallery made his horse
  Caracole; then bow'd his homage, bluntly saying,
  "Fair damsels, each to him who worships each

"
  And most of these were mute, some anger'd, one
  Murmuring, "All courtesy is dead," and one
  "The glory of our Round Table is no more



     Then fell thick rain, plume droopt and mantle clung,
  And pettish cries awoke, and the wan day
  Went glooming down in wet and weariness:
  But under her black brows a swarthy one
  Laugh'd shrilly, crying, "Praise the patient saints,
  Our one white day of Innocence hath past,
  Tho' somewhat draggled at the skirt. So be it.
  The snowdrop only, flowering thro' the year,
  Would make the world as blank as Winter-tide.
  And Lancelot's, at this night's solemnity
  With all the kindlier colours of the field



     So dame and damsel glitter'd at the feast
  Variously gay: for he that tells the tale
  Liken'd them, saying, as when an hour of cold
  Falls on the mountain in midsummer snows,
  And all the purple slopes of mountain flowers
  Pass under white, till the warm hour returns
  With veer of wind, and all are flowers again;
  So dame and damsel cast the simple white,
  And glowing in all colours, the live grass,
  Rose-campion, bluebell, kingcup, poppy, glanced
  About the revels, and with mirth so loud
  And wroth at Tristram and the lawless jousts,
  Brake up their sports, then slowly to her bower
  Parted, and in her bosom pain was lord.


     And little Dagonet on the morrow morn,
  High over all the yellowing Autumn-tide,
  Danced like a wither'd leaf before the hall.
  Then Tristram saying, "Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?"
  Wheel'd round on either heel, Dagonet replied,
  "Belike for lack of wiser company;
  Or being fool, and seeing too much wit
  Makes the world rotten, why, belike I skip
  To know myself the wisest knight of all

"
  "Ay, fool," said Tristram, "but 'tis eating dry
  To dance without a catch, a roundelay
  To dance to

" Then he twangled on his harp,
  And while he twangled little Dagonet stood
  Quiet as any water-sodden log
  Stay'd in the wandering warble of a brook;
  But when the twangling ended, skipt again;
  And being ask'd, "Why skipt ye not, Sir Fool?"
  Made answer, "I had liefer twenty years
  Skip to the broken music of my brains
  Than any broken music thou canst make

"
  Then Tristram, waiting for the quip to come,
  "Good now, what music have I broken, fool?"
  And little Dagonet, skipping, "Arthur, the King's;
  Thou makest broken music with thy bride,
  Her daintier namesake down in Brittany--
  And so thou breakest Arthur's music, too

"
  "Save for that broken music in thy brains,
  Sir Fool," said Tristram, "I would break thy head.
  Fool, I came late, the heathen wars were o'er,
  The life had flown, we sware but by the shell--
  I am but a fool to reason with a fool--
  Come, thou art crabb'd and sour: but lean me down,
  Sir Dagonet, one of thy long asses' ears,
  And harken if my music be not true.


     "`Free love--free field--we love but while we may:
  The woods are hush'd, their music is no more:
  The leaf is dead, the yearning past away:
  New leaf, new life--the days of frost are o'er:
  New life, new love, to suit the newer day:
  New loves are sweet as those that went before:
  Free love--free field--we love but while we may.'


     "Ye might have moved slow-measure to my tune,
  Not stood stockstill. I made it in the woods,
  And heard it ring as true as tested gold



     But Dagonet with one foot poised in his hand,
  "Friend, did ye mark that fountain yesterday
  Made to run wine?--but this had run itself
  All out like a long life to a sour end--
  And them that round it sat with golden cups
  To hand the wine to whosoever came--
  The twelve small damosels white as Innocence,
  In honour of poor Innocence the babe,
  Lent to the King, and Innocence the King
  Gave for a prize--and one of those white slips
  Handed her cup and piped, the pretty one,
  'Drink, drink, Sir Fool,' and thereupon I drank,
  Spat--pish--the cup was gold, the draught was mud



     And Tristram, "Was it muddier than thy gibes?
  Is all the laughter gone dead out of thee?--
  Not marking how the knighthood mock thee, fool--
  Sole follower of the vows'--for here be they
  Who knew thee swine enow before I came,
  Smuttier than blasted grain: but when the King
  Had made thee fool, thy vanity so shot up
  It frighted all free fool from out thy heart;
  Which left thee less than fool, and less than swine,
  A naked aught--yet swine I hold thee still,
  For I have flung thee pearls and find thee swine



     And little Dagonet mincing with his feet,
  "Knight, an ye fling those rubies round my neck
  In lieu of hers, I'll hold thou hast some touch
  Of music, since I care not for thy pearls.
  Swine? I have wallow'd, I have wash'd--the world
  Is flesh and shadow--I have had my day.
  The dirty nurse, Experience, in her kind
  Hath foul'd me--an I wallow'd, then I wash'd--
  I have had my day and my philosophies--
  Swine, say ye? swine, goats, asses, rams and geese
  Troop'd round a Paynim harper once, who thrumm'd
  On such a wire as musically as thou
  Some such fine song--but never a king's fool



     And Tristram, "Then were swine, goats, asses, geese
  The wiser fools, seeing thy Paynim bard
  Had such a mastery of his mystery
  That he could harp his wife up out of hell



     Then Dagonet, turning on the ball of his foot,
  "And whither harp'st thou thine? down! and thyself
  Down! and two more: a helpful harper thou,
  That harpest downward! dost thou know the star
  We call the harp of Arthur up in heaven?"


     And Tristram, "Ay, Sir Fool, for when our King
  Was victor wellnigh day by day, the knights,
  Glorying in each new glory, set his name
  High on all hills, and in the signs of heaven



     And Dagonet answer'd, "Ay, and when the land
  To babble about him, all to show your wit--
  And whether he were King by courtesy,
  Or King by right--and so went harping down
  The black king's highway, got so far, and grew
  So witty that we play'd at ducks and drakes
  With Arthur's vows on the great lake of fire.
  Tuwhoo! do ye see it? do ye see the star?"


     "Nay, fool," said Tristram, "not in open day

"
  And Dagonet, "Nay, nor will: I see it and hear.
  It makes a silent music up in heaven,
  And I, and Arthur and the angels hear,
  And then we skip

" "Lo, fool," he said, "ye talk
  Fool's treason: is the King thy brother fool?"
  Then little Dagonet clapt his hands and shrill'd,
  "Ay, ay, my brother fool, the king of fools!
  Figs out of thistles, silk from bristles, milk
  From burning spurge, honey from hornet-combs
  And men from beasts--Long live the king of fools!"


     And down the city Dagonet danced away;
  But thro' the slowly-mellowing avenues
  And solitary passes of the wood
  Rode Tristram toward Lyonnesse and the west.
  With ruby-circled neck, but evermore
  Past, as a rustle or twitter in the wood
  Made dull his inner, keen his outer eye
  For all that walk'd, or crept, or perch'd, or flew.
  Anon the face, as, when a gust hath blown,
  Unruffling waters re-collect the shape
  Of one that in them sees himself, return'd;
  But at the slot or fewmets of a deer,
  Or ev'n a fall'n feather, vanish'd again.


     So on for all that day from lawn to lawn
  Thro' many a league-long bower he rode. At length
  A lodge of intertwisted beechen-boughs
  Furze-cramm'd, and bracken-rooft, the which himself
  Against a shower, dark in the golden grove
  Appearing, sent his fancy back to where
  She lived a moon in that low lodge with him:
  Till Mark her lord had past, the Cornish King,
  With six or seven, when Tristram was away,
  And snatch'd her thence; yet dreading worse than shame
  Her warrior Tristram, spake not any word,
  But bode his hour, devising wretchedness.


     And now that desert lodge to Tristram lookt
  So sweet, that halting, in he past, and sank
  Down on a drift of foliage random-blown;
  But could not rest for musing how to smoothe
  Perchance in lone Tintagil far from all
  The tonguesters of the court she had not heard.
  But then what folly had sent him overseas
  After she left him lonely here? a name?
  Was it the name of one in Brittany,
  Isolt, the daughter of the King? "Isolt
  Of the white hands" they call'd her: the sweet name
  Allured him first, and then the maid herself,
  Who served him well with those white hands of hers,
  And loved him well, until himself had thought
  He loved her also, wedded easily,
  But left her all as easily, and return'd.
  The black-blue Irish hair and Irish eyes
  Had drawn him home--what marvel? then he laid
  His brows upon the drifted leaf and dream'd.


     He seem'd to pace the strand of Brittany
  Between Isolt of Britain and his bride,
  And show'd them both the ruby-chain, and both
  Graspt it so hard, that all her hand was red.
  Then cried the Breton, "Look, her hand is red!
  These be no rubies, this is frozen blood,
  And melts within her hand--her hand is hot
  With ill desires, but this I gave thee, look,
  Is all as cool and white as any flower

"
  Follow'd a rush of eagle's wings, and then
  A whimpering of the spirit of the child,
  Because the twain had spoil'd her carcanet.


     He dream'd; but Arthur with a hundred spears
  Rode far, till o'er the illimitable reed,
  And many a glancing plash and sallowy isle,
  The wide-wing'd sunset of the misty marsh
  Glared on a huge machicolated tower
  That stood with open doors, where out was roll'd
  A roar of riot, as from men secure
  Amid their marshes, ruffians at their ease
  Among their harlot-brides, an evil song.
  "Lo there," said one of Arthur's youth, for there,
  High on a grim dead tree before the tower,
  A goodly brother of the Table Round
  Swung by the neck: and on the boughs a shield
  Showing a shower of blood in a field noir,
  And therebeside a horn, inflamed the knights
  At that dishonour done the gilded spur,
  Till each would clash the shield, and blow the horn.
  But Arthur waved them back. Alone he rode.
  Then at the dry harsh roar of the great horn,
  That sent the face of all the marsh aloft
  An ever upward-rushing storm and cloud
  Of shriek and plume, the Red Knight heard, and all,
  Even to tipmost lance and topmost helm
  In blood-red armour sallying, howl'd to the King,


     "The teeth of Hell flay bare and gnash thee flat!
  Lo! art thou not that eunuch-hearted King
  Who fain had clipt free manhood from the world--
  Slain was the brother of my paramour
  By a knight of thine, and I that heard her whine
  And snivel, being eunuch-hearted too,
  Sware by the scorpion-worm that twists in hell,
  And stings itself to everlasting death,
  To hang whatever knight of thine I fought
  And tumbled. Art thou King?--Look to thy life!"


     He ended: Arthur knew the voice; the face
  Wellnigh was helmet-hidden, and the name
  Went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind.
  And Arthur deign'd not use of word or sword,
  But let the drunkard, as he stretch'd from horse
  To strike him, overbalancing his bulk,
  Down from the causeway heavily to the swamp
  Fall, as the crest of some slow-arching wave,
  Heard in dead night along that table-shore,
  Drops flat, and after the great waters break
  Whitening for half a league, and thin themselves,
  Far over sands marbled with moon and cloud,
  From less and less to nothing; thus he fell
  Head-heavy; then the knights, who watch'd him, roar'd
  And shouted and leapt down upon the fall'n;
  There trampled out his face from being known,
  And sank his head in mire, and slimed themselves:
  Nor heard the King for their own cries, but sprang
  Thro' open doors, and swording right and left
  Men, women, on their sodden faces, hurl'd
  The tables over and the wines, and slew
  Till all the rafters rang with woman-yells,
  And all the pavement stream'd with massacre:
  Then, echoing yell with yell, they fired the tower,
  Which half that autumn night, like the live North,
  Red-pulsing up thro' Alioth and Alcor,
  Made all above it, and a hundred meres
  About it, as the water Moab saw
  Come round by the East, and out beyond them flush'd
  The long low dune, and lazy-plunging sea.


     So all the ways were safe from shore to shore,
  But in the heart of Arthur pain was lord.


     Then, out of Tristram waking, the red dream
  Fled with a shout, and that low lodge return'd,
  Mid-forest, and the wind among the boughs.
  He whistled his good warhorse left to graze
  Among the forest greens, vaulted upon him,
  And rode beneath an ever-showering leaf,
  Till one lone woman, weeping near a cross,
  Hath left me or is dead"; whereon he thought--
  "What, if she hate me now? I would not this.
  What, if she love me still? I would not that.
  I know not what I would"--but said to her,
  "Yet weep not thou, lest, if thy mate return,
  He find thy favour changed and love thee not"--
  Then pressing day by day thro' Lyonnesse
  Last in a roky hollow, belling, heard
  The hounds of Mark, and felt the goodly hounds
  Yelp at his heart, but turning, past and gain'd
  Tintagil, half in sea, and high on land,
  A crown of towers.       Down in a casement sat,
  A low sea-sunset glorying round her hair
  And when she heard the feet of Tristram grind
  The spiring stone that scaled about her tower,
  Flush'd, started, met him at the doors, and there
  Belted his body with her white embrace,
  Crying aloud, "Not Mark--not Mark, my soul!
  The footstep flutter'd me at first: not he:
  Catlike thro' his own castle steals my Mark,
  But warrior-wise thou stridest thro' his halls
  Who hates thee, as I him--ev'n to the death.
  My soul, I felt my hatred for my Mark
  Quicken within me, and knew that thou wert nigh

"
  To whom Sir Tristram smiling, "I am here.
  Let be thy Mark, seeing he is not thine



     And drawing somewhat backward she replied,
  "Can he be wrong'd who is not ev'n his own,
  But save for dread of thee had beaten me,
  Scratch'd, bitten, blinded, marr'd me somehow--Mark?
  What rights are his that dare not strike for them?
  Not lift a hand--not, tho' he found me thus!
  But harken! have ye met him? hence he went
  To-day for three days' hunting--as he said--
  And so returns belike within an hour.
  Mark's way, my soul!--but eat not thou with Mark,
  Because he hates thee even more than fears;
  Nor drink: and when thou passest any wood
  Close vizor, lest an arrow from the bush
  Should leave me all alone with Mark and hell.
  Is as the measure of my love for thee.''


     So, pluck'd one way by hate and one by love,
  Drain'd of her force, again she sat, and spake
  To Tristram, as he knelt before her, saying,
  "O hunter, and O blower of the horn,
  Harper, and thou hast been a rover too,
  For, ere I mated with my shambling king,
  Ye twain had fallen out about the bride
  Of one--his name is out of me--the prize,
  If prize she were--(what marvel--she could see)
  Thine, friend; and ever since my craven seeks
  To wreck thee villainously: but, O Sir Knight,
  What dame or damsel have ye kneel'd to last?"


  And loveliness--ay, lovelier than when first
  Her light feet fell on our rough Lyonnesse,
  Sailing from Ireland

"          Softly laugh'd Isolt;
  My dole of beauty trebled?" and he said,
  "Her beauty is her beauty, and thine thine,
  And thine is more to me--soft, gracious, kind--
  Save when thy Mark is kindled on thy lips
  Most gracious; but she, haughty ev'n to him,
  Lancelot; for I have seen him wan enow
  Have yielded him her love



           To whom Isolt,
  "Ah then, false hunter and false harper, thou
  Who brakest thro' the scruple of my bond,
  Calling me thy white hind, and saying to me
  That Guinevere had sinn'd against the highest,
  And I--misyoked with such a want of man--
  That I could hardly sin against the lowest



     He answer'd, "O my soul, be comforted!
  If this be sweet, to sin in leading-strings,
  If here be comfort, and if ours be sin,
  Crown'd warrant had we for the crowning sin
  That made us happy: but how ye greet me--fear
  And fault and doubt--no word of that fond tale--
  Thy deep heart-yearnings, thy sweet memories
  Of Tristram in that year he was away



     And, saddening on the sudden, spake Isolt,
  "I had forgotten all in my strong joy
  To see thee--yearnings?--ay! for, hour by hour,
  Here in the never-ended afternoon,
  O sweeter than all memories of thee,
  Deeper than any yearnings after thee
  Seem'd those far-rolling, westward-smiling seas,
  Watch'd from this tower. Isolt of Britain dash'd
  Before Isolt of Brittany on the strand,
  Would that have chill'd her bride-kiss? Wedded her?
  Fought in her father's battles? wounded there?
  The King was all fulfill'd with gratefulness,
  And she, my namesake of the hands, that heal'd
  Thy hurt and heart with unguent and caress--
  Well--can I wish her any huger wrong
  Than having known thee? her too hast thou left
  To pine and waste in those sweet memories.
  O were I not my Mark's, by whom all men
  Are noble, I should hate thee more than love



     And Tristram, fondling her light hands, replied,
  Did I love her? the name at least I loved.
  Isolt?--I fought his battles, for Isolt!
  The night was dark; the true star set. Isolt!
  The name was ruler of the dark--Isolt?
  Care not for her! patient, and prayerful, meek,



     And Isolt answer'd, "Yea, and why not I?
  Mine is the larger need, who am not meek,
  Pale-blooded, prayerful. Let me tell thee now.
  Here one black, mute midsummer night I sat,
  Lonely, but musing on thee, wondering where,
  Murmuring a light song I had heard thee sing,
  And once or twice I spake thy name aloud.
  Then flash'd a levin-brand; and near me stood,
  In fuming sulphur blue and green, a fiend--
  Mark's way to steal behind one in the dark--
  For there was Mark: 'He has wedded her,' he said,
  Not said, but hiss'd it: then this crown of towers
  So shook to such a roar of all the sky,
  That here in utter dark I swoon'd away,
  And woke again in utter dark, and cried,
  And thou wert lying in thy new leman's arms



     Then Tristram, ever dallying with her hand,
  And past desire!" a saying that anger'd her.'
  And sweet no more to me!' I need Him now.
  For when had Lancelot utter'd aught so gross
  Ev'n to the swineherd's malkin in the mast?
  The greater man, the greater courtesy.
  Far other was the Tristram, Arthur's knight!
  But thou, thro' ever harrying thy wild beasts--
  Save that to touch a harp, tilt with a lance
  Becomes thee well--art grown wild beast thyself.
  How darest thou, if lover, push me even
  In fancy from thy side, and set me far
  In the gray distance, half a life away,
  Her to be loved no more? Unsay it, unswear!
  Flatter me rather, seeing me so weak,
  Broken with Mark and hate and solitude,
  Thy marriage and mine own, that I should suck
  Lies like sweet wines: lie to me: I believe.
  Will ye not lie? not swear, as there ye kneel,
  And solemnly as when ye sware to him
  Was once in vows when men believed the King!
  They lied not then, who sware, and thro' their vows
  The King prevailing made his realm:--I say,
  Swear to me thou wilt love me ev'n when old,
  Gray-hair'd, and past desire, and in despair



     Then Tristram, pacing moodily up and down,
  "Vows! did you keep the vow you made to Mark
  More than I mine? Lied, say ye? Nay, but learnt,
  The vow that binds too strictly snaps itself--
  My knighthood taught me this--ay, being snapt--
  We run more counter to the soul thereof
  Than had we never sworn. I swear no more.
  I swore to the great King, and am forsworn.
  For once--ev'n to the height--I honour'd him.
  'Man, is he man at all?' methought, when first
  I rode from our rough Lyonnesse, and beheld
  That victor of the Pagan throned in hall--
  His hair, a sun that ray'd from off a brow
  Like hillsnow high in heaven, the steel-blue eyes,
  The golden beard that clothed his lips with light--
  Moreover, that weird legend of his birth,
  With Merlin's mystic babble about his end
  Amazed me; then his foot was on a stool
  Shaped as a dragon; he seem'd to me no man,
  But Michael trampling Satan; so I sware,
  Being amazed: but this went by--The vows!
  O ay--the wholesome madness of an hour--
  They served their use, their time; for every knight
  Believed himself a greater than himself,
  Till he, being lifted up beyond himself,
  Did mightier deeds than elsewise he had done,
  And so the realm was made; but then their vows--
  Began to gall the knighthood, asking whence
  Had Arthur right to bind them to himself?
  Dropt down from heaven? wash'd up from out the deep?
  They fail'd to trace him thro' the flesh and blood
  Of our old kings: whence then? a doubtful lord
  To bind them by inviolable vows,
  Which flesh and blood perforce would violate:
  For feel this arm of mine--the tide within
  Red with free chase and heather-scented air,
  Pulsing full man; can Arthur make me pure
  As any maiden child? lock up my tongue
  From uttering freely what I freely hear?
  Bind me to one? The wide world laughs at it.
  And worldling of the world am I, and know
  The ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour
  Woos his own end; we are not angels here
  Nor shall be: vows--I am woodman of the woods,
  And hear the garnet-headed yaffingale
  Mock them: my soul, we love but while we may;
  And therefore is my love so large for thee,
  Seeing it is not bounded save by love



     Here ending, he moved toward her, and she said,
  "Good: an I turn'd away my love for thee
  To some one thrice as courteous as thyself--
  For courtesy wins woman all as well
  As valour may, but he that closes both
  Is perfect, he is Lancelot--taller indeed,
  Rosier and comelier, thou--but say I loved
  This knightliest of all knights, and cast thee back
  Thine own small saw, 'We love but while we may,'
  Well then, what answer?"          He that while she spake,
  Mindful of what he brought to adorn her with,
  The jewels, had let one finger lightly touch
  The warm white apple of her throat, replied,
  "Press this a little closer, sweet, until--
  Come, I am hunger'd and half-anger'd--meat,
  Wine, wine--and I will love thee to the death,
  And out beyond into the dream to come



     So then, when both were brought to full accord,
  She rose, and set before him all he will'd;
  And after these had comforted the blood
  With meats and wines, and satiated their hearts--
  Now talking of their woodland paradise,
  The deer, the dews, the fern, the founts, the lawns;
  Now mocking at the much ungainliness,
  And craven shifts, and long crane legs of Mark--
  Then Tristram laughing caught the harp, and sang:


     "Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that bend the brier!
  A star in heaven, a star within the mere!
  Ay, ay, O ay--a star was my desire,
  And one was far apart, and one was near:
  Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that bow the grass!
  And one was water and one star was fire,
  And one will ever shine and one will pass.
  Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that move the mere



     Then in the light's last glimmer Tristram show'd
  And swung the ruby carcanet. She cried,
  "The collar of some Order, which our King
  Hath newly founded, all for thee, my soul,
  For thee, to yield thee grace beyond thy peers



  Grown on a magic oak-tree in mid-heaven,
  And won by Tristram as a tourney-prize,
  And hither brought by Tristram for his last
  Love-offering and peace-offering unto thee



     He spoke, he turn'd, then, flinging round her neck,
  But, while he bow'd to kiss the jewell'd throat,
  Out of the dark, just as the lips had touch'd,
  Behind him rose a shadow and a shriek--
  "Mark's way," said Mark, and clove him thro' the brain.


     That night came Arthur home, and while he climb'd,
  All in a death-dumb autumn-dripping gloom,
  The stairway to the hall, and look'd and saw
  A voice clung sobbing till he question'd it,
  "What art thou?" and the voice about his feet
  Sent up an answer, sobbing, "I am thy fool,
  And I shall never make thee smile again

"That story which the bold Sir Bedivere,
    First made and latest left of all the knights,
    Told, when the man was no more than a voice
    In the white winter of his age, to those
    With whom he dwelt, new faces, other minds.
        For on their march to westward, Bedivere,
    Who slowly paced among the slumbering host,
    Heard in his tent the moanings of the King:
        "I found Him in the shining of the stars,
   I mark'd Him in the flowering of His fields,
   But in His ways with men I find Him not.
   I waged His wars, and now I pass and die.
   O me! for why is all around us here
   As if some lesser god had made the world,
   But had not force to shape it as he would,
   And enter it, and make it beautiful?
   Or else as if the world were wholly fair,
   But that these eyes of men are dense and dim,
   And have not power to see it as it is:
   Perchance, because we see not to the close;--
   For I, being simple, thought to work His will,
   And have but stricken with the sword in vain;
   And all whereon I lean'd in wife and friend
   Is traitor to my peace, and all my realm
   Reels back into the beast, and is no more.


       Then, ere that last weird battle in the west,
   There came on Arthur sleeping, Gawain kill'd
   In Lancelot's war, the ghost of Gawain blown
   Along a wandering wind, and past his ear
   Went shrilling, "Hollow, hollow all delight!
   Hail, King! to-morrow thou shalt pass away.
   Farewell! there is an isle of rest for thee.
   And I am blown along a wandering wind,
   And hollow, hollow, hollow all delight

"
   And fainter onward, like wild birds that change
   Their season in the night and wail their way
   From cloud to cloud, down the long wind the dream
   Shrill'd; but in going mingled with dim cries
   Far in the moonlit haze among the hills,
   As of some lonely city sack'd by night,
   When all is lost, and wife and child with wail
   Pass to new lords; and Arthur woke and call'd,
   "Who spake? A dream. O light upon the wind,
   Thine, Gawain, was the voice--are these dim cries
   Thine? or doth all that haunts the waste and wild
   Mourn, knowing it will go along with me?"

       This heard the bold Sir Bedivere and spake:
   "O me, my King, let pass whatever will,
   Elves, and the harmless glamour of the field;
   But in their stead thy name and glory cling
   To all high places like a golden cloud
   For ever: but as yet thou shalt not pass.
   Light was Gawain in life, and light in death
   Is Gawain, for the ghost is as the man;
   And care not thou for dreams from him, but rise--
   I hear the steps of Modred in the west,
    And with him many of thy people, and knights
   Once thine, whom thou hast loved, but grosser grown
   Than heathen, spitting at their vows and thee.
   Right well in heart they know thee for the King.
   Arise, go forth and conquer as of old


       Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
   "Far other is this battle in the west
   Whereto we move, than when we strove in youth,
   And brake the petty kings, and fought with Rome,
   Or thrust the heathen from the Roman wall,
   And shook him thro' the north. Ill doom is mine
   To war against my people and my knights.
   The king who fights his people fights himself.
   And they my knights, who loved me once, the stroke
   That strikes them dead is as my death to me.
   Yet let us hence, and find or feel a way
   Thro' this blind haze, which ever since I saw
   One lying in the dust at Almesbury,
   Hath folded in the passes of the world


       Then rose the King and moved his host by night,
   And ever push'd Sir Modred, league by league,
   Back to the sunset bound of Lyonnesse--
   A land of old upheaven from the abyss
   By fire, to sink into the abyss again;
   Where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt,
   And the long mountains ended in a coast
   Of ever-shifting sand, and far away
   The phantom circle of a moaning sea.
   There the pursuer could pursue no more,
   And he that fled no further fly the King;
   And there, that day when the great light of heaven
   Burn'd at his lowest in the rolling year,
   On the waste sand by the waste sea they closed.
   Nor ever yet had Arthur fought a fight
   Like this last, dim, weird battle of the west.
   A deathwhite mist slept over sand and sea:
   Whereof the chill, to him who breathed it, drew
   Down with his blood, till all his heart was cold
   With formless fear; and ev'n on Arthur fell
   Confusion, since he saw not whom he fought.


  For friend and foe were shadows in the mist,
  And friend slew friend not knowing whom he slew;
  And some had visions out of golden youth,
  And some beheld the faces of old ghosts
  Look in upon the battle; and in the mist
  Was many a noble deed, many a base,
  And chance and craft and strength in single fights,
  And ever and anon with host to host
  Shocks, and the splintering spear, the hard mail hewn,
  Shield-breakings, and the clash of brands, the crash
  Of battleaxes on shatter'd helms, and shrieks
  Look'd up for heaven, and only saw the mist;
  And shouts of heathen and the traitor knights,
  Oaths, insult, filth, and monstrous blasphemies,
  Sweat, writhings, anguish, labouring of the lungs
  In that close mist, and cryings for the light,
  Moans of the dying, and voices of the dead.


     Last, as by some one deathbed after wail
  Of suffering, silence follows, or thro' death
  Or deathlike swoon, thus over all that shore,
  Save for some whisper of the seething seas,
  A dead hush fell; but when the dolorous day
  Grew drearier toward twilight falling, came
  A bitter wind, clear from the North, and blew
  The mist aside, and with that wind the tide
  Rose, and the pale King glanced across the field
  Of battle: but no man was moving there;
  Nor yet of heathen; only the wan wave
  Brake in among dead faces, to and fro
  Swaying the helpless hands, and up and down
  Tumbling the hollow helmets of the fallen,
  And shiver'd brands that once had fought with Rome,
  And rolling far along the gloomy shores
  The voice of days of old and days to be.


     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere,
  And whiter than the mist that all day long
  Had held the field of battle was the King:


     "Hearest thou this great voice that shakes the world,
  And wastes the narrow realm whereon we move,
  And beats upon the faces of the dead,
  My dead, as tho' they had not died for me?--
  O Bedivere, for on my heart hath fall'n
  Confusion, till I know not what I am,
  Nor whence I am, nor whether I be King.
  Behold, I seem but King among the dead



     Then spake the bold Sir Bedivere: "My King,
  King everywhere! and so the dead have kings,
  There also will I worship thee as King.
  Yet still thy life is whole, and still I live
  Who love thee; but who hates thee, he that brought
  The heathen back among us, yonder stands,
  Modred, unharm'd, the traitor of thine house



     Then spake the King: "My house hath been my doom.
  But call not thou this traitor of my house
  Who hath but dwelt beneath one roof with me.
  My house are rather they who sware my vows,
  Yea, even while they brake them, own'd me King.
  And well for thee, saying in my dark hour,
  When all the purport of my throne hath fail'd,
  That quick or dead thou hottest me for King.
  King am I, whatsoever be their cry;
  And one last act of kinghood shalt thou see
  Yet, ere I pass

" And uttering this the King
  Made at the man: then Modred smote his liege
  Hard on that helm which many a heathen sword
  Had beaten thin; while Arthur at one blow,
  Striking the last stroke with Excalibur,
  Slew him, and all but slain himself, he fell.


     So all day long the noise of battle roll'd
  Among the mountains by the winter sea;
  Until King Arthur's Table, man by man,
  Had fall'n in Lyonnesse about their lord,
  King Arthur. Then, because his wound was deep,
  The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,
  And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,
  A broken chancel with a broken cross,
  That stood on a dark strait of barren land:
  On one side lay the Ocean, and on one
  Lay a great water, and the moon was full.


     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
  "The sequel of to-day unsolders all
  The goodliest fellowship of famous knights
  Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep
  They sleep--the men I loved. I think that we
  Shall never more, at any future time,
  Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,
  Walking about the gardens and the halls
  Of Camelot, as in the days that were.
  I perish by this people which I made,--
  Tho' Merlin sware that I should come again
  To rule once more; but, let what will be, be,
  I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm
  That without help I cannot last till morn.
  Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,
  Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how
  In those old days, one summer noon, an arm
  Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,
  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,
  Holding the sword--and how I row'd across
  And took it, and have worn it, like a king;
  And, wheresoever I am sung or told
  In aftertime, this also shall be known:
  But now delay not: take Excalibur,
  And fling him far into the middle mere:
  Watch what thou seest, and lightly bring me word



     To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:
  "It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,
  Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm--
  A little thing may harm a wounded man;
  Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,
  Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word



     So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept,
  And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,
  Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,
  Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang
  Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down
  By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock,
  Came on the shining levels of the lake.


     There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,
  And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon,
  Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth
  And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:
  For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,
  Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work
  Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long
  That both his eyes were dazzled as he stood,
  This way and that dividing the swift mind,
  In act to throw: but at the last it seem'd
  Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd
  There in the many-knotted waterflags,
  That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.
  So strode he back slow to the wounded King.


     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
  "Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave?
  What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"


     And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
  "I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,
  And the wild water lapping on the crag



     To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:
  "Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name,
  Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd
  Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight:
  For surer sign had follow'd, either hand
  Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.
  This is a shameful thing for men to lie.
  Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again,
  As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing
  I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word



     Then went Sir Bedivere the second time
  Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,
  Counting the dewy pebbles, fix'd in thought;
  But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,
  How curiously and strangely chased, he smote
  His palms together, and he cried aloud:


     "And if indeed I cast the brand away,
  Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,
  Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,
  Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.
  What good should follow this, if this were done?
  What harm, undone? Deep harm to disobey,
  Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.
  Were it well to obey then, if a king demand
  An act unprofitable, against himself?
  The King is sick, and knows not what he does.
  What record, or what relic of my lord
  Should be to aftertime, but empty breath
  And rumours of a doubt? But were this kept,
  Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,
  Some one might show it at a joust of arms,
  Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur,
  Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.
  Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps
  Upon the hidden bases of the hills.'
  So might some old man speak in the aftertime
  To all the people, winning reverence.
  But now much honour and much fame were lost



     So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,
  And hid Excalibur the second time,
  And so strode back slow to the wounded King.


     Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:
  "What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?'


     And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
  "I heard the water lapping on the crag,
  And the long ripple washing in the reeds



     To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:
  "Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,
  Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!
  Authority forgets a dying king,
  Laid widow'd of the power in his eye
  That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art,
  For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,
  In whom should meet the offices of all,
  Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;
  Either from lust of gold, or like a girl
  Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.
  Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,
  And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:
  But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,
  I will arise and slay thee with my hands



     Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,
  And, leaping down the ridges, lightly, plunged
  Among the bulrush beds, and clutch'd the sword,
  And strongly wheel'd and threw it. The great brand
  Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,
  And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch,
  Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,
  Seen where the moving isles of winter shock
  By night, with noises of the Northern Sea.
  So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur:
  But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm
  Clothed in white samite, mystic wonderful,
  And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him
  Three times, and drew him under in the mere.
  And lightly went the other to the King.


     Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:
  "Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.
  Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?"


     And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
  "Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems
  Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,
  Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,
  Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men,
  So great a miracle as yonder hilt.
  Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;
  But when I look'd again, behold an arm,
  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,
  That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him
  Three times, and drew him under in the mere



     And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:
  "My end draws nigh; 'tis time that I were gone.
  Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,
  And bear me to the margin; yet I fear
  My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die



     So saying, from the pavement he half rose,
  Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,
  And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes
  As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere
  Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears,
  And would have spoken, but he found not words;
  Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,
  O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,
  And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs.


     But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard,
  Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed
  When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King,
  Muttering and murmuring at his ear, "Quick, quick!
  I fear it is too late, and I shall die

"
  But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,
  Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd,
  Larger than human on the frozen hills.
  He heard the deep behind him, and a cry
  Before. His own thought drove him like a goad.
  Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves
  And barren chasms, and all to left and right
  The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based
  His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang
  Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels--
  And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,
  And the long glories of the winter moon.


     Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge,
  Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,
  Beneath them; and descending they were ware
  That all the decks were dense with stately forms,
  Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream--by these
  A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars,
  And, as it were one voice, an agony
  Of lamentation, like a wind that shrills
  All night in a waste land, where no one comes,
  Or hath come, since the making of the world.


     Then murmur'd Arthur, "Place me in the barge

"
  Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept.
  But she, that rose the tallest of them all
  And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,
  And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands,
  And call'd him by his name, complaining loud,
  And dropping bitter tears against a brow
  Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white
  And colourless, and like the wither'd moon
  Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;
  And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops
  Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls--
  That made his forehead like a rising sun
  High from the daïs-throne--were parch'd with dust
  Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,
  Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.
  So like a shatter'd column lay the King;
  Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,
  From spur to plume a star of tournament,
  Shot thro' the lists at Camelot, and charged
  Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.


     Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere:
  Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?
  For now I see the true old times are dead,
  When every morning brought a noble chance,
  And every chance brought out a noble knight.
  Such times have been not since the light that led
  The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.
  But now the whole Round Table is dissolved
  Which was an image of the mighty world,
  And I, the last, go forth companionless,
  And the days darken round me, and the years,
  Among new men, strange faces, other minds



     And slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge:
  "The old order changeth, yielding place to new,
  Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.
  Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me?
  I have lived my life, and that which I have done
  May He within himself make pure! but thou,
  If thou shouldst never see my face again,
  Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer
  Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice
  Rise like a fountain for me night and day.
  For what are men better than sheep or goats
  That nourish a blind life within the brain,
  Both for themselves and those who call them friend?
  For so the whole round earth is every way
  But now farewell. I am going a long way
  With these thou seest--if indeed I go
  (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)--
  To the island-valley of Avilion;
  Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,
  Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies
  Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard lawns
  And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea,
  Where I will heal me of my grievous wound



     So said he, and the barge with oar and sail
  Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan
  That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,
  Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood
  With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere
  Revolving many memories, till the hull
  Look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn,
  And on the mere the wailing died away.


     But when that moan had past for evermore,
  The stillness of the dead world's winter dawn
  Amazed him, and he groan'd, The King is gone.''
  And therewithal came on him the weird rhyme,
  "From the great deep to the great deep he goes



     Whereat he slowly turn'd and slowly clomb
  The last hard footstep of that iron crag;
  Thence mark'd the black hull moving yet, and cried,
  "He passes to be King among the dead,
  And after healing of his grievous wound
  He comes again; but--if he come no more--
  Who shriek'd and wail'd, the three whereat we gazed
  On that high day, when, clothed with living light,
  They stood before his throne in silence, friends
  Of Arthur, who should help him at his need?"


     Then from the dawn it seem'd there came, but faint
  As from beyond the limit of the world,
  Like the last echo born of a great cry,
  Sounds, as if some fair city were one voice
  Around a king returning from his wars.


     Thereat once more he moved about, and clomb
  Ev'n to the highest he could climb, and saw,
  Straining his eyes beneath an arch of hand,
  Or thought he saw, the speck that bare the King,
  Down that long water opening on the deep
  Somewhere far off, pass on and on, and go
  From less to less and vanish into light.
  And the new sun rose bringing the new year. 

If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; 
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; 
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too:
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise; 
 
If you can dream- -and not make dreams your master; 
  If you can think- -and not make thoughts your aim,
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same:.
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools; 
 
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings,
  And never breathe a word about your loss:
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on! '
 
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings- -nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much:
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And- -which is more- -you'll be a Man, my son

IF life were but a dream, my Love,
And death the waking time;
If day had not a beam, my Love,
And night had not a rhyme, —
A barren, barren world were this
Without one saving gleam;
I'd only ask that with a kiss
You'd wake me from the dream.
If dreaming were the sum of days,
And loving were the bane;
If battling for a wreath of bays
Could soothe a heart in pain, —
I'd scorn the meed of battle's might,
All other aims above
I'd choose the human's higher right,
To suffer and to love

Meanings according as their minds are moved more or less;
For writing what thou art, or showing what thou were,
Adds to the one disdain, to the other but despair,
      Thy mind of neither needs, in both seeing it exceeds. 

Perhaps if Death is kind, and there can be returning,
We will come back to earth some fragrant night,
And take these lanes to find the sea, and bending
Breathe the same honeysuckle, low and white.

We will come down at night to these resounding beaches
And the long gentle thunder of the sea,
Here for a single hour in the wide starlight
We shall be happy, for the dead are free.




If ever the lid gets off my head
And lets the brain away
The fellow will go where he belonged - 
Without a hint from me,

And the world -  if the world be looking on - 
Will see how far from home
It is possible for sense to live
The soul there -  all the time. 

what do you want? 

Certainly, I shall say
bestow me with the divine power
to create more and more
beautiful poems
that speaks the language
of all creatures
that expresses the mirth
of a blooming flower
that expresses the grief
of a withering flower
that expresses the pains and pleasures
of an ant working tough
for foster of baby ant
that expresses restless toils
of stars and planets
to keep the pace of nature
always in existence

about my requirement
i shall say
give me bread to feed my family
and to my friend and foe
who gave me love and lesson
give me shelter under your arms
and a sweet home to reside
under the roof of your divine soul

But must not i forget
to mention  the names
who creates poem in praise of His divine glory                                                and His infinite creation
despite of their destitute

And lo! my name be laid all the rest.

Amen


I shall lay my head on her knees
Then she will brush my hair with her fingers
And I shall tell her all my soul suffered from; 

I shall complain of the bouquet of roses
That pricked my hands despite the silk-ribbon
And scotch-tape woven around it carefully; 

I shall tell her the tricks of the winds
Blowing roughly on me leaving all others
And of clouds that shower benign rain
On all others leaving me, 
Though I stand under them with a bowl 
In my hands raised skywards
Which stays dried up; 

I‘ll feel she smoothes my hair
I am relieved, and her sweetness has removed
The wrinkles of my crumpled soul successfully-
I shall feel an urge to tell her
That I miss the apple-jam she used to prepare for me
In a sauce-pan, 
And that I have left eating the soaked and peeled off
Almonds and raisins with a glass of milk; 

I shall clarify that I am telling her all 
Because I don’t tell
Such things to anyone
Not because they won’t listen to this
But because I have lost my tantrums wild
Somewhere in the fields of my childhood; 

I shall ask her
Does she listen to my voice while I recite prayers
On her grave? 
Does she see when my brother removes the frozen candle wax? 
And washes the tomb-stone? 
Or showering petals on her earthly-bed? 

Yes, I shall tell her
That cooking shows are no more interesting now; 
That all the tragic tunes interpret my heart
And all the sad songs sing of my soul; 
But, will it be wise to tell her all 
That might cause pain to her? 

I shall have no idea of her allowed duration with me
So, I won’t tell her, or ask from her anything
But this, that we all are settled in life, 
And that I am happy
And then I shall smile 
as big as a smiley-sticker, ear to ear


I cannot be more lonely, 
More drear I cannot be! 
My worn heart beats so wildly 
'Twill break for thee--

And when the world despises-- 
When Heaven repels my prayer-- 
Will not mine angel comfort? 
Mine idol hear?

Yes, by the tears I'm poured, 
By all my hours of pain 
O I shall surely win thee, 
Beloved, again!If He dissolve—then—there is nothing—more—
Eclipse—at Midnight—
It was dark—before—
Sunset—at Easter—
Blindness—on the Dawn—
Faint Star of Bethlehem—
Gone down!

Or it be too late!
Say—that the pulse just lisps—
The Chariots wait—

Say—that a little life—for His—
Is leaking—red—
His little Spaniel—tell Him!
Will He heed

The moons eye has been blackened.
She looked so wrong when I saw her last.
But I know, I know, I know.
I can't save her, I can't even stop it from happening again.
It would help if she would just listen.
Subjects just better left alone.
But its so hard to swallow it down.
Threaten his life just won't work.
Because he's a cop.
A man in blue, 
Your suppose to be man of honor.
To protect and serve.
Then you go home and beat your wife within inches of her life.
That just isn't right.
She keeps making excuse for him.
The fault is all and only his.
And to think you soon gonna have his kid.
What are you now three months? 
Will that be the decider.
The clincher that makes finally makes you get the nerve to leave and put out a order of protection against him, 
I know what your afraid of.
Because he is cop he will get away with breaching it.
I will take a stand against him if when and you break it off in that way only, 
I am your friend.
But intill you do for yourself I can't help you.
As much as I want too..
I got others to think about in my life.
Behind bars I wouldn't do anyone any good.
There is a time and a place for everything.
Given it I would smile laying him out.
Take out all the aggression built up inside over the years.
Some days it just feels like my head will explode.
Meeting mr. closure.
Shaking hands, and do the dance.
Being prepared for the have to.
Choice is convenient but not always there.
Seeing despair from the inside.
Fears the holy ghost.
Broiling a pig roast.
Pressure applied in every way I know how.
All I do is hope and pray it doesn't come to life and death.
I will kill him.
Put in his grave to stay.
Sitting in jail, wondering if I could have done anymore before it got this far.
Looking up to the sky at night and knowing there will never be another light so bright.If He were living—dare I ask—
And how if He be dead—
And so around the Words I went—
Of meeting them—afraid—

I hinted Changes—Lapse of Time—
The Surfaces of Years—
I touched with Caution—lest they crack—
And show me to my fears—

Reverted to adjoining Lives—
Adroitly turning out
Wherever I suspected Graves—
'Twas prudenter—I thought—





and fold their hands
and look askance

because they can
when I catch the hem
of my dress on your clouds.

and I don't have a valentine
not even a sweetheart neckline
for the party

all in pink. I will step out
in the mists again I think
with you, with You

my only friend
if you'll defend me when
I catch the hem of my dress

on your clouds.

would be fulfilled.

If I could spend one hour with you I would 
remember every second. 

If i could spend a minute with you my heart 
would stop in seeing your eyes stare into 
mine.

If I could lie under the stars with you I 
would remember everything u said.

One night I drempt that you loved me and 
you held me in your arms but thats just a
dream and you will only love me in my dreams! 

I will just have to keep loving and wanting you
because you are the start that never ends! 
Just make my dreams come true.If I could bribe them by a Rose
I'd bring them every flower that grows
From Amherst to Cashmere!
I would not stop for night, or storm—
Or frost, or death, or anyone—
My business were so dear!

If they would linger for a Bird
My Tambourin were soonest heard
Among the April Woods!
Unwearied, all the summer long,
Only to break in wilder song
When Winter shook the boughs!

What if they hear me!
Who shall say
That such an importunity
May not at last avail?

That, weary of this Beggar's face—
They may not finally say, Yes—
To drive her from the Hall

If I could but forget 
The fullness of those first sweet days, 
When you burst sun-like thro' the haze 
Of unacquaintance, on my sight, 
And made the wet, gray day seem bright 
While clouds themselves grew fair to see. 
And since, no day is gray or wet 
But all the scene comes back to me, 
If I could but forget.

If I could but forget 
How your dusk eyes look into mine, 
And how I thrilled as with strong wine 
Beneath your touch; while sped amain 
The quickened stream thro' ev'ry vein; 
How near my breath fell to a gasp, 
When for a space our fingers met 
In one electric vibrant clasp, 
If I could but forget.

If I could but forget 
The months of passion and of pain, 
And all that followed in their train-- 
Rebellious thoughts that would arise, 
Rebellious tears that dimmed mine eyes, 
The prayers that I might set love's fire 
Aflame within your bosom yet-- 
The death at last of that desire-- 
If I could but forget. 

If I could fly high in the air like the birds up above
Then seek out any person that doesn't know how to love
Looking down upon the earth and seeing all of its glory
Take to the sky like the morning dove and tell the all time story

When flying far beneath the clear and brilliant skies
Listening to the hungry and hearing their solemn cries
Rising high above the rooftops and trying to see within
People fighting for their freedom and wanting ever to win

Soaring high like the eagle that is sharper than any bird
Spreading of food to the hungry and speaking a kind word
Darting up and down like the sparrow to and fro in the air
Flying around the whole wide world spreading nothing but cheer  

Sing like the robin perched on a fence near the gate
Peck at the heart that is filled with so much hate
Gather up the dried grapes hanging on the vines so free        
Circle around the lush green forest and rest upon a tree      

Coasting and careening up to the greatest of heights 
Seeking to understand mankind and his enormous plights
Finally to rest in a place where daylight turns to dark   
Yearning ever to fly again a new flight to embark




Or maybe two hundred more.
Would I have accomplished.  all I really wanted too? 
Than I have maybe.  in all of my eighty-four? 

Does one need to have all that time? 
To make their mark upon this earth? 
For I've known some that have only lived shorter lives
and some that have died.  

soon after birth.

Were their lives no more of a blessing? 
For all of whom they had touched. 
And did they not accomplish their mission.  

here on earth? 
Was it more of time.  that would have mattered 
or done that much? 

We are all given. . a certain amount of time
I know this.  from what I've seen in the past.
For no matter how much you want another to live
We each have our time on earth.  

and then we pass.

Be grateful for whatever.  

amount of life’s time you have
For ONE is all.  

one will ever be granted.
Like the flowers that bloom in the soil.  

they too
Are only given an amount of life.  




If i could love again, , , 
If i found someone new, , , 
Could i give my heart so true, , , 
And forget you so, , , 
If i could love again.  

Maybe, and only if I am not a sinner, I can talk to them, 
But, how? , , , If I only have the good heart, , , it could be, 
Perhaps, , , I am not the chosen one, , but, , , I can change, 
To talk to them in prayer, , , I know they hear it thee. 

If I could only find the way back home

If i could only find the way back home, 
I would spent my time with them, 
But since my days are too short, 
How could they feel that I missed them all.

If I could only find the way back home, 
Questions  are answered, 
But since i am from a distant mile, 
How would they know that i was sorry. 

I walked past fields of barley, on my way to somewhere new
I watched a skylark sing his song, and marvelled at the veiw
I stood beneath a willow, as the breeze made branches dance
And knew that I could stay awhile, If I just had the chance


If i could talk, i would tell you that i cared.
i would try to say how i've never felt this way
and no one else could make me feel like this

If you weren't blind you'd see, just how much you mean to me
you don't even see when you're standing next to me
just tell me why it's hard to let you go.  

Time will say nothing but I told you so
Time only knows the price we have to pay; 
If I could tell you I would let you know.

If we should weep when clowns put on their show,
If we should stumble when musicians play,
Time will say nothing but I told you so.

There are no fortunes to be told, although,
Because I love you more than I can say,
If I could tell you I would let you know.

The winds must come from somewhere when they blow,
There must be reason why the leaves decay; 
Time will say nothing but I told you so.

Perhaps the roses really want to grow,
The vision seriously intends to stay; 
If I could tell you I would let you know.

Suppose the lions all get up and go,
And the brooks and soldiers run away; 
Will Time say nothing but I told you so? 
Like leaves on an autumn forest floor,
What a bonfire my letters would make.

If I could speak words of water,
You would drown when I said
'I love you.

'If I cry
Don't stop me
Let the rain of tears fall on ground
And moisten the soil
For I like its silty fragrance.

If I cry
Don't look at me
For I will wipe off
The pearl like droplets
And become insomniac.

If I cry 
Don't befuddle me
For it will disrupt
The streamline flow
Of my contemplations.

If I cry
Don't pat my sodden cheeks
For it will not help me
Removing the clouds of self-pity
From my inner vibe.

If I cry
Don't halt me
Let the watermark form on the floor
For it will guide me
To the upcomings.

If I stop
And recoup myself
Don't interrupt me
Let a new thought be born
For the sake of my teardrops.

 


(

)When I am listening to you
it is  infinitely important 
that I LISTEN TO MYSELF

If I do not listen to myself
I will not hear you.

If I do not listen to myself
I may distort everything you say.

If I do not listen to myself
I may come to you with 
my own conditioning.

If I do not listen to myself
I may react to you
from my own insecurities. 

If I forget thee, Jerusalem,
Then let my right be forgotten.
Let my right be forgotten, and my left remember.
Let my left remember, and your right close
And your mouth open near the gate.

I shall remember Jerusalem
And forget the forest -- my love will remember,
Will open her hair, will close my window,
will forget my right,
Will forget my left.

If the west wind does not come
I'll never forgive the walls,
Or the sea, or myself.
Should my right forget
My left shall forgive,
I shall forget all water,
I shall forget my mother.

If I forget thee, Jerusalem,
Let my blood be forgotten.
I shall touch your forehead,
Forget my own,
My voice change
For the second and last time
To the most terrible of voices --
Or silence. 

To my Dear n Near’s 

To My DAD –
Dad you have been the Best Man I have ever met in life
You showed me how to handle life
You gave me everything such that I had nothing to ask more
But still I have one – would you be like Jacob (the Israel)  
Like he took Jospeh’s son to be his own- I wish
You take my son as your own
I trust in you – when you could make such a week kid like me a real good person
I am sure you will teach same faith to my son too.
You are the best man I ever met
Let me Rest in peace

To My MUM-
Mum – you are so great, you delivered me in pain
But never showed it on me till this min
I know you could have told a big NO to me 
But you did accept me even when I was such a Meek kid
Sick and thin, big and fat 
I have nothing to ask you as you have always done your best
Still I have one wish – will you be lik Naomi
Be a mother of my son –
You will be praised by generations 
I see bright light and I am feeling sleepy
I am going to rest in peace

To my Man
The good time started after you came into my life
I know it was not same for you
I let you go free with no bond
You can choose anyone you want
Tall n slim, from your favorite part of the world (Brazil/Argentina)  
Don’t worry about anything else
shower all your love 
All bonds settled once I am gone
I see bright light and I am feeling sleepy
Let me rest in peace

To my Son 
Baby – you changed my life 
I was nothing until you came to this world
Know what – you always felt I had rabbit in my heart
But baby – All my heart I had you
You were my most happiness on earth 
I don’t feel bad for missing anything else but you
Every day was bright and shinny cos of you
I have done my best for you 
Even when I am gone 
You will have the best people around you to care for
Remember to pray every day 
Faith will lead you to success
Never me weak or meek like me
Mommy is seeing bring light – and I am feeling sleepy
Let me rest in peace.
Let me rest in peace
Let me rest in peace


If I had a wishing well, I would wish me well.

If I had a wishing well, don't wish me well than go to hell.

If I had a wishing well, I really hope I won't go to hell.

If I had a wishing well, I wish I could turn back time.

If I had a wishing well, I wish there were no crime.

If I had a wishing well, I wish my life to be long.

If I had a wishing well, I wish everyone would just get along.

If I had a wishing well, I would wish upon a star.

If I had a wishing well, I wish I would have a new charted plane.

If I had a wishing well, I wish I knew what I were wishing.

If I had a wishing well, I wish I didn't wish so well.

If I had a wishing well, I would wish I had wishing well.

If I had a wishing well, I wish knew how this pain would end.

If I had a wishing well, I wish I would not have wished 
my life away. 

If I had a brontosaurus
I would name him Morris or Horace;
But if suddenly one day he had a lot of little brontosauri
I would change his name to Laurie. 

I wish I had the guts 
To tell you how I feel.
I wish I could tell you
That all of this is real.
I wish you would understand
That I am not just your friend.
I wish you would open your eyes, 
And realize that there is no end.
I will always be by your side day by day.
I will always be the person you lean on, 
And my love for you will NEVER fade away. 
I wish you knew that you are the one I want
And that I am the one for you.
I wish there was a way I could show you that I care. 
I wish you would wake up 
And see that I am sincere: 
I am always waiting, 
And I will always be here.
I wish you were with me, 
I wish you would stop and see, 
That I will always love you, 
And in my heart, you will be. 

In a room where god stores angels wings
Amongst his many other things
I wonder if there are some for me
So that I might wear them steadfastly

For when I'm gone and arrive back there
I'll have flown on wings from who knows where
And if I can flap my wings and fly
I'd really like the chance to try


I know not what I would ever say, 
i've pondered this of lately.
If came the day, you went away
the pain 'twould hurt me greatly.
-
I realize, that I would surely miss
your loving eyes to gaze upon.
Your oh so sweet and tender kiss
if this gift of bliss would be foregone.
-
Your sultry smile and dimpled cheeks
would then be only a memory. 'Tis
only you that mine heart seeks.
Your love, it is my destiny.
-
I'd never make it through the night
I would always feel a loneliness.
Without your arms to hold me tight.
This pain would surely then progress.
-
You are everything and so much more
Your charm and beauty are heavenly.
You're the only one that I adore, 
my love's for you, exclusively.
-
Each night before I go to sleep I pray.
That you will love me evermore. That
your love will never stray and that all
love's wonders we'll explore..

******************************** ***********

If I may have it, when it's dead,
I'll be contented—so—
If just as soon as Breath is out
It shall belong to me—

Until they lock it in the Grave,
'Tis Bliss I cannot weigh—
For tho' they lock Thee in the Grave,
Myself—can own the key—

Think of it Lover! I and Thee
Permitted—face to face to be—
After a Life—a Death—We'll say—
For Death was That—
And this—is Thee—

I'll tell Thee All—how Bald it grew—
How Midnight felt, at first—to me—
How all the Clocks stopped in the World—
And Sunshine pinched me—'Twas so cold—

Then how the Grief got sleepy—some—
As if my Soul were deaf and dumb—
Just making signs—across—to Thee—
That this way—thou could'st notice me—

I'll tell you how I tried to keep
A smile, to show you, when this Deep
All Waded—We look back for Play,
At those Old Times—in Calvary,

Forgive me, if the Grave come slow—
For Coveting to look at Thee—
Forgive me, if to stroke thy frost
Outvisions Paradise

IF I must go to heaven's end
Climbing the ages like a stair,
Be near me and forever bend
With the same eyes above me there;
Time will fly past us like leaves flying,
We shall not heed, for we shall be
Beyond living, beyond dying,
Knowing and known unchangeably. 


Inventing the machine to travel through the space and time.
To the day be before you lost your life.
I can save you.
Somehow someway.
Don't tell me it will be okay right before you die.
Oh a love that will survive till the end.

A delusion of you still standing right next to me.
Your sweet smell still envelopes all my senses.
Your soft touch I can still feel. 
The ghost of yesterday forever haunting me.
I open my eyes and your all I see is you.
In my heart and mind.

The sounds ring out as I hear the wind chimes.
I love you oh yes forever and always I do.
How I do I drown all this pain out? 
A angry approach.
I want to scream and shout at anyone willing to listen.

The gash, the grief, and the knowledge of the one I loved is now deceased. 
Crawling into the darkness.
Never wanting to come back into the light.
So afraid of the exposure.
All I need is some closure. 

If I could gain my happy childhood days 
I would fight with my brother 
For possessing all of our favourite toys 
But we would be gentle seeing our mother. 

If I came back to my childhood days 
We would love to touch the drops of rain 
Through the window of our cottage 
And how happiness and joy I would gain! 

Oh, if I got back those wintry evenings 
When my father used to return from market 
With cakes, sweets and play things 
I would be happy to share those with my mates. 

If I returned to my childhood days
I would make a world of bliss
And invite all of you my dear friends
To spend hours with you in peace. 

The course we've taken
If I say
I Love you? 
Doesn't it mean
The end of what we had
If what we had 
Was a beginning? 











 I say or if I withold this word
will the trees fountain more greenly
will the blue woods come closer

to the curb where I look both ways
uncertain when to cross.
I know that I will cross one day

the crossroads all must once
and I'm afraid I won't see the
light change quick enough

or there'll be some delay
I don't expect that hurts.

and I know you don't desert
but the earth is sometimes harsh
in the midst of so much beauty.

today I decide is this the word or not
in my small poem.
or is there a word that I forgot

that became a jewel obscure in
the cave of my mind or will I find
it's only You and laugh and remind

myself you're here beside me
all the Time and isn't that
the most beautiful word of all.


If I should cease to bring a Rose
Upon a festal day,
'Twill be because beyond the Rose
I have been called away—

If I should cease to take the names
My buds commemorate—
'Twill be because Death's finger
Claps my murmuring lip

If I should die and leave you
Be not like the others, quick undone
Who keep long vigils by the silent
dust and weep.

For my sake turn to life and smile
Nerving thy heart and trembling
hand to comfort weaker souls than thee.
Complete these unfinished tasks of mine
And I perchance may therein comfort thee.If I should die,
And you should live—
And time should gurgle on—
And morn should beam—
And noon should burn—
As it has usual done—
If Birds should build as early
And Bees as bustling go—
One might depart at option
From enterprise below!
'Tis sweet to know that stocks will stand
When we with Daisies lie—
That Commerce will continue—
And Trades as briskly fly—
It makes the parting tranquil
And keeps the soul serene—
That gentlemen so sprightly
Conduct the pleasing scene

If I should one day leave and disappear, 
promise to remember my love for you.
Watch white cotton clouds drifting heaven’s blue, 
I am the soft mist reaching to keep you near.
Leaves will brush you in the breeze to wipe tears
away, for we are joined forever two.
You're my brilliant star, while I'm the light who
first treads black paths, keeping our way clear.

And love, like your starlight, will find its way.
Ours sets me free to raise a mountain, 
for your dream house, with vast tulip rainbows.
By life’s bridge, we’ll wait to hug you again, 
with pink roses, and silk angel pillows
. . 

IF I should learn, in some quite casual way,  
   That you were gone, not to return again—  
Read from the back-page of a paper, say,  
   Held by a neighbor in a subway train,  
How at the corner of this avenue         
   And such a street (so are the papers filled)  
A hurrying man—who happened to be you—  
   At noon to-day had happened to be killed,  
I should not cry aloud—I could not cry  
   Aloud, or wring my hands in such a place—         
I should but watch the station lights rush by  
   With a more careful interest on my face,  
Or raise my eyes and read with greater care  
Where to store furs and how to treat the hair. 

If I was President
The first thing I would do
is call Mumia Abu-Jamal.
No,
if I was president
the first thing I would do
is call Leonard Peltier.
No,
if I was president
the first person I would call
is that rascal
John Trudell.
No,
the first person I'd call
is that other rascal
Dennis Banks.
I would also call
Alice Walker.
I would make a conference call.
And I would say this:
Yo, you troublemakers,
it is time to let all of us
out of prison.
Pack up your things:
Dennis and John,
collect Alice Walker
If you can find her:
In Mendocino, Molokai, Mexico or
Gaza,
& head out to the prisons
where Mumia and Leonard
are waiting for you.
They will be traveling
light.
Mumia used to own a lot
of papers
but they took most of those
away from him.
Leonard
will probably want to drag along
some of his
canvases.
Alice
who may well be
shopping
in New Delhi
will no doubt want to
dress up for the occasion
in a sparkly shalwar kemeez.
My next call is going to be
to the Cubans
all five of them; 
so stop worrying.
For now, you're my fish.
I just had this long letter
from Alice and she has begged me
to put an end
to her suffering.
What? she said.
You think these men are the only ones who suffer
when Old Style America locks them up
& throws away
the key? 
I can't tell you, she goes on,
the changes
this viciousness
has put me through,
and I have had a child to raise
& classes to teach
& food to buy
and just because
I'm a poet
it doesn't mean
I don't have to
pay the mortgage
or the rent.
Yet all these years,
nearly thirty or something
of them
I have been running around
the country
and the world
trying to arouse justice
for these men.
Tonsillitis
hasn't stopped me.
Migraine,
hasn't stopped me.
Lyme disease
hasn't stopped me.
And why? 
Because
knowing the country
that I'm in,
as you are destined to learn
it too,
I know wrong
when I see it.
If that chair you're sitting in
could speak
you would have it moved
to another room.
You would burn it.
So, amigos,
pack your things.
Alice and John and Dennis
are on their way.
They are bringing prayers from Nilak Butler and Bill Wapepah; 
they are bringing sweet grass and white sage
from Pine Ridge.
I am the president
at least until the Corporations
purchase the next election,
and this is what I choose
to do
on my first day..

If  I was the leader of the pack
I would eradicate
Murder wars and hate
Each person would have 
On his back
A rucksack containing
Three books
One on love of everything
One on Giving and sharing
Lastly one on religious understanding
If one prays to a stone or
A mountain a mosque or a church 
Do not mock them
Their belief is a divine right
If they shave their head
Wear a turban, cover their head
Grow long hair
Understand its faith
Look at each other with love
The sentence of murder
Would not be only in the hands 
Of murderers anywhere
The disgusting tolerance
Of babies skin and bone
STARVING WOULD NEVER HAPPEN
A Berlin armada of planes
Would stop that
A money bank for the starving
Should be filled daily by every 
Bank on the planet
Who is the man who can? 
Start all this
If I was the leader of the pack
It would be me

If I were a rabbit
I would hop all around
I would nibble carrots
Without making a sound
If I were a lion
And even if I was full of might
As I was defeated by an ant
So I am on a vegetarian diet
If I were a fish
I will swim in the water
I won’t dare come out
Because then it will be hotter
If I were a horse
I would participate in races
And secure the first place
And look at happy faces
If I were a giraffe
I would have a view from the top
But I am still unlucky
Because I can not hop
If I were a kangaroo
I would hop around with a pouch
But I hope I won’t fall down
Otherwise I will say ‘ouch! ! ’
If I were a penguin
I would walk like a baby
If the weather becomes hot
I will have a swim, may be
If I were a monkey
I would sit on a tree
And keep throwing berries
On a poor old donkey
If I was that donkey
I would chew up the monkey
Even though I know
He is not that tasty
If I were a cockroach
I would steal food from the larder
I just hope my other task
Doesn’t become harder
If I were an eagle
I would soar in the sky
And look at my sumptuous prey
From up so high
If I were a camel
I would store food on my back
And then I will move on
Carrying it like a sack
If I were a peacock
I will dance in the showers
Amongst the tall trees
Amongst the beautiful flowers
If I were a sparrow
I will fly or eat grains
Bur even if I only do that
I still have lots of brains
If I were a duck
I will wade in the lake
But I will stop the poem here 
Or you will shout, " stop for heaven’s sake"If I were a flower my petals would be fading now, 
drooping and withering in the early summer
but if by chance you glanced my way to warm me through, 
watered my weakened frame to give me strength, 
then I know I would survive to see the Autumn.

Strange that it should be this way for summer 
lends itself to life and love and laughter.
Here in this hole where all is dark and pained
all laughter is stifled by the dank air.
No sunlight filters through, no light at all.
 
I'm cut off from friends and faces I once knew.
Hemmed in by physical inabilities,  
dim eyes and ears that hear the nothingness.
The song of silence fills me so persistently, 
I hum its tune, remembering life’s symphony.

If I were a flower my petals would be fading now, 
drooping and withering in the early summer
but if by chance you glanced my way to warm me once again, 
watered my weakened frame to give me strength, 
then I believe your love would see me through.

'IF I were dead, you'd sometimes say, Poor Child!' 
The dear lips quiver'd as they spake, 
And the tears brake 
From eyes which, not to grieve me, brightly smiled. 
Poor Child, poor Child! 
I seem to hear your laugh, your talk, your song. 
It is not true that Love will do no wrong. 
Poor Child! 
And did you think, when you so cried and smiled, 
How I, in lonely nights, should lie awake, 
And of those words your full avengers make? 
Poor Child, poor Child! 
And now, unless it be 
That sweet amends thrice told are come to thee, 
Poor Child

Here Without You

Is a phase that will always put me into a daze.
Just thinking about it, oh how I would be in a haze.
A thousand lights wouldn't be able to dim the darkness
If I was
Here Without You.

I can't lose you
You can't be gone, 
I don't want to be scared
And I don't want to be wrong.
Don't open that window
Or step through that door.

My life is but a piece of thread
Hanging on to what you have said.
I can't possibly comprehend If I was
Here Without You.

This Life just won't shine
If your gone and I am
Here Without You! 

Somewhere there's someone who 
Thinks the same.
They are sitting right here
The one who wrote this is near.
You see them every day
It's the person at the end
Of this poem, they want you to
Stay and never go away.
They never want to be
Here Without You

If i were a flower
had i been transcendent in flavour
thy fragrance would spout the nature
for calamities of versatile feature


If i were the sand of desert
had i been blown away
thy sparkle would be too luminous
to enlighten the whole universe


If i were a dew drop
had i been fallen from the heaven
thy cosmo would embellish the world
with its rapture like on leaf withered


If I were in charge of the world
I'd cancel oatmeal,
Monday mornings,
Allergy shots, and also Sara Steinberg. 

If I were in charge of the world
There'd be brighter nights lights,
Healthier hamsters, and
Basketball baskets forty eight inches lower.

If I were in charge of the world
You wouldn't have lonely.
You wouldn't have clean.
You wouldn't have bedtimes.
Or "Don't punch your sister

"
You wouldn't even have sisters.

If I were in charge of the world
A chocolate sundae with whipped cream and nuts would be a vegetable
All movies would be G,
And a person who sometimes forgot to brush, 
And sometimes forgot to flush,
Would still be allowed to be 
In charge of the world. 

If i were a bird
had i been flying throughout the earth
singing the melody of nightingale
and murmuring with the gale


I often wish I were a King,
And then I could do anything.

If only I were King of Spain,
I'd take my hat off in the rain.

If only I were King of France,
I wouldn't brush my hair for aunts.

I think, if I were King of Greece,
I'd push things off the mantelpiece.

If I were King of Norroway,
I'd ask an elephant to stay.

If I were King of Babylon,
I'd leave my button gloves undone.

If I were King of Timbuctoo,
I'd think of lovely things to do.

If I were King of anything,
I'd tell the soldiers, "I'm the King!"If I were king, my pipe should be premier. 
The skies of time and chance are seldom clear, 
We would inform them all with bland blue weather. 
Delight alone would need to shed a tear, 
For dream and deed should war no more together. 

Art should aspire, yet ugliness be dear; 
Beauty, the shaft, should speed with wit for feather; 
And love, sweet love, should never fall to sere, 
If I were king. 

But politics should find no harbour near; 
The Philistine should fear to slip his tether; 
Tobacco should be duty free, and beer; 
In fact, in room of this, the age of leather, 
An age of gold all radiant should appear, 
If I were king. 

If I were old, a broken man and blind,
and one should lead me to Mid-Eildon's crest,
and leave me there a little time to rest
sharing the hilltop with the Border wind,
the whispering heather, and the curlew's cry,
I know the blind dark could not be so deep,
so cruel and clinging, but that I
should see the sunlit curve of Cheviot's steep
rise blue and friendly on the distant sky!

so heavy as to curtain from my sight
the beauty of those Border slopes that lie
far south before me, and a love-found light
would shine upon the slow Tweed loitering by
with gift of song and silver to the sea!-
No dark can ever hide this dear loved land from me


If I were tickled by the rub of love,
A rooking girl who stole me for her side,
Broke through her straws, breaking my bandaged string,
If the red tickle as the cattle calve
Still set to scratch a laughter from my lung,
I would not fear the apple nor the flood
Nor the bad blood of spring.

Shall it be male or female? say the cells,
And drop the plum like fire from the flesh.
If I were tickled by the hatching hair,
The winging bone that sprouted in the heels,
The itch of man upon the baby's thigh,
I would not fear the gallows nor the axe
Nor the crossed sticks of war.

Shall it be male or female? say the fingers
That chalk the walls with green girls and their men.
I would not fear the muscling-in of love
If I were tickled by the urchin hungers
Rehearsing heat upon a raw-edged nerve.
I would not fear the devil in the loin
Nor the outspoken grave.

If I were tickled by the lovers' rub
That wipes away not crow's-foot nor the lock
Of sick old manhood on the fallen jaws,
Time and the crabs and the sweethearting crib
Would leave me cold as butter for the flies
The sea of scums could drown me as it broke
Dead on the sweethearts' toes.

This world is half the devil's and my own,
Daft with the drug that's smoking in a girl
And curling round the bud that forks her eye.
An old man's shank one-marrowed with my bone,
And all the herrings smelling in the sea,
I sit and watch the worm beneath my nail
Wearing the quick away.

And that's the rub, the only rub that tickles.
The knobbly ape that swings along his sex
From damp love-darkness and the nurse's twist
Can never raise the midnight of a chuckle,
Nor when he finds a beauty in the breast
Of lover, mother, lovers, or his six
Feet in the rubbing dust.

And what's the rub? Death's feather on the nerve? 
Your mouth, my love, the thistle in the kiss? 
The words of death are dryer than his stiff,
My wordy wounds are printed with your hair.
I would be tickled by the rub that is:
Man be my metaphor. 

If I were to write a song for you
it would I think.  be written in my tears.
For the love I feel is Oh so deep
It has now been.  for many a year. 

It would play out a tune.  of the pain I so deeply felt
since, you went away.
It would also carry.  in its notes not inked
the words my heart just couldn't then.  

to you say. 

I think if the world were to hear it
they.  would know just how I feel.
The world might even cry along with me
as they hummed the tune.  of noted pain so real.

I know that I will never have your love
for you have given it to another I see.
But if I could go back in time
would your love then.  have been given just for me? 

If I could write a song for you
well, that is not my given of gifts.
But please know my darling.  that I will always love you
if only in poetic words.  such as this. 

If i were the brightness of the day
had i been shining the goodness of life
asking people of the world
to make their life more lustrous


If i were a diffusing light 
had i been spreading the light of wisdom
asking people of the world
to accumulate as much as in your vision


If I were you
I should rain
Everyday
Every moment
I should share my love
With the thirsty land 
Who is going to go on a fast
Again and again
If I were you

(If it is true, what the Prophets write,
That the heathen gods are all stocks and stones,
Shall we, for the sake of being polite,
Feed them with the juice of our marrow-bones?

And if Bezaleel and Aholiab drew
Shall we suffer the Roman and Grecian rods
To compel us to worship them as gods?

And worshipp'd them that they might make inspired art abhorr'd;

The wood and stone were call'd the holy things,
And their sublime intent given to their kings.
And criminals to sacrifices turn'd. 

If it should come to be,
This proof of you and me,
This type and sign
Of hours that smiled and shone,
And yet seemed dead and gone
As old-world wine:

Of Them Within the Gate
Ask we no richer fate,
No boon above,
For girl child or for boy,
My gift of life and joy,
Your gift of love. 

If my life was a book
It would be on a shelf
In a cobwebbed library
The jacket, long disintegrated
The cover, faded and stained
Two chapters, titled
Before and After
The solitary reader
Time


it would be in a downtown motel
marked by a helicopter's flashing bulb.
A traffic warden, working late,
would be the first upon the scene.
Later, at the expense of a TV network,
an eminent sociologist,
the host of a chat show
and a controversial author
would arrive with their good wishes
-the whole occasion to be filmed as part of the 
Childhood would be a blur of photographs and speculation
dwindling by his late teens into
'Where Is He Now?' features in Sunday magazines.

they wouldn't really care about the public ministry,
they'd be too busy investigating His finances
and trying to prove He had Church or Mafia connections.
The miracles would be explained by 
an eminent and controversial magician,
excellent examples of Spoken English
and immediately incorporated into
the O-Level syllabus,
His sinless perfection considered by moral philosophers
as, OK, but a bit repressive.

He'd be the fly in everyone's ointment-
the sort of controversial person who
stands no chance of eminence.
Communists would expel Him, capitalists
would exploit Him or have Him
Doctors would accuse Him of quackery,
soldiers would accuse Him of cowardice,
theologians would take Him aside and try 
to persuade Him of His non-existence.

end it all. Heretic, fundamentalist, literalist,
puritan, pacifist, non-conformist, we'd take Him
away and quietly end the argument.
But the argument would rumble in the ground
at the end of three days and would break out
and walk around as though death was some bug,
saying 'I am the resurrection and the life. 
No man cometh to the Father but by me'.
While the magicians researched new explanations
and the semanticists wondered exactly what
He meant by 'I' and 'No man' there would be those
who stand around amused, asking for something
called proof.~ IF LOVE NOT GIVEN ~






Why fire of tune
Ignite in my soul? 

Why lulu love
Deluge you in my soul? 

Why glittery starry garland
Decor you on my neck? 

Why touch-travel 
O’er my soul
Like rill breeze? 

Why vermillion red
Gander at me from east? 

Why sway me
By bedecking smile
Like refulgent sky? 

Why touch me
Like blooming buds
Smiling at me? 

How I’ll embosom
Encrypt bind moor
Your vast euphony
Riches rapture rhapsodic
In my wee bosom
If love not given? 

Your entire floral love decor
How I’ll keep wreath 
If love not 
Given in my soul? 

Why keep me
Pale placid turbid
Instead florid limpid
If love not
Given in my soul
In towering 
Pellucid teemingness? 

If love not given-? 

-----

I'd build you a fountain, 
And if love were like stone
I'd bring you a mountain.
If love were like air
I'd set whirlwinds free, 
But as these are not love
I'll just give you me.

(If man does what he can do to fly, 
Puts in a lot of effort to try, 
Man will have the peace to come by
And live so triumphantly high.

If man watching the sky makes him sane, 
And brings all the joy to remove pain.
Man will have blessings with so much gain.
Blessings coming in showers like the rain.

If man reaches out to find his way
To know the values of life to pay.
Man will come up with actions to play, 
For him to acquire a happy day.

If man seeks a divine gift as well, 
And gains to face barriers he must quell.
Man will have a wondrous life to tell.
Such tale will inspire those with great spell.

If man lives with his brothers as one, 
To abide in love for peace to go on.
Man will stand firm and bright like the sun, 
With his brothers to have health and fun.

Man will make progress that comes to light, 
And will prosper every day and night. 

Fireflies, fireflies, small yellow flowers, 
Lighting the woodlands in the wee small hours.
Consuela is playing her mellow guitar
Her eyes pale ochre, her lips cinnabar, 
She sings to them sweetly her gypsy refrain
And dreams of her home in far away Spain.
The fireflies swirl as if to her beat
As she sits on the porch, a stamping her feet.
As they dance to her notes, each rise and each fall.

'If my head hurt a hair's foot
Pack back the downed bone. If the unpricked ball of my breath
Bump on a spout let the bubbles jump out.
Sooner drop with the worm of the ropes round my throat
Than bully ill love in the clouted scene.

'All game phrases fit your ring of a cockfight:
I'll comb the snared woods with a glove on a lamp,
Peck, sprint, dance on fountains and duck time
Before I rush in a crouch the ghost with a hammer, air,
Strike light, and bloody a loud room.

'If my bunched, monkey coming is cruel
Rage me back to the making house. My hand unravel
When you sew the deep door. The bed is a cross place.
Bend, if my journey ache, direction like an arc or make
A limp and riderless shape to leap nine thinning months.'

Or a nacreous sleep among soft particles and charms
My dear would I change my tears or your iron head.
Thrust, my daughter or son, to escape, there is none, none, none,
Nor when all ponderous heaven's host of waters breaks.

'Now to awake husked of gestures and my joy like a cave
To the anguish and carrion, to the infant forever unfree,
O my lost love bounced from a good home;
The grain that hurries this way from the rim of the grave
Has a voice and a house, and there and here you must couch and cry.

'Rest beyond choice in the dust-appointed grain,
At the breast stored with seas. No return
Through the waves of the fat streets nor the skeleton's thin ways.
The grave and my calm body are shut to your coming as stone,
And the endless beginning of prodigies suffers open.

'If my mind has fragrance
i shall find you in the fragrance.
I shall sense you and hug your smell.
I shall breathe in, your fragrance
that will penetrate my cells.

My cells shall then, bring me into prayer
and make me fall in adoration. 

I'm just so sorry
No need to worry
Your not speaking anyways
And that's okay

I'm just so sorry
Anger begets anger my friend
Deny it till the end
But were like snakes each with our own venom

I'm just so sorry
Here please hand me a tissue
So I can wipe the floor with you
You have no clue

I'm just so sorry
I won't impersonate
I will speak my version of the truth
Let loose

I'm just so sorry
But you don't have read, or concede
Just breath
Count to ten and it will be fine again

I'm just sorry
But don't insult me with your self gratification
Your better then everyone else
To hell with you

I'm just so sorry
But what is done, is done
You don't even know me
Yet you hand your opinions like candy.

I'm just so sorry
But I didn't mention your name
You weren't dethroned or defamed
Point the finger and blame
By all means please do

I'm just sorry
But forgiveness is isn't mine to give
So its live and let live.
Deny me some of that beautiful constructive criticism
Still I won't miss it


Love knows it is called to love.

Lifting up my eyes to your eyes, 
you showed me your heart.
The love in me flowed into your heart. 
I was consoled in glorious surrender.
If not to surrender, why should i love? 

Love knows it is called to love. 

My pillow's wet with untold tears
My heart is wrenched by unshared fears
My mind is screaming from the pain
My soul cries out from constant rain.

If only my heart could form the words
If only my lips could tell
If only your soul could feel my pain
Then maybe all would be well. 

But my heart will not listen
My lips will not move
Your soul no longer touches mine
And my heart cannot prove. 

Sweet heart, if I only have a minute
to say goodbye to you, 
let me whisper what I’m thinking
when my time on earth is through.

I'll tell you how I’ve loved you
and how happy I have been, 
please, don't think of me as leaving, 
for I know we’ll meet again.

We'll hold each other close once more
and I'll kiss away your tears.
We'll talk of precious things we’ve shared
through all our loving years.

When my time with you has ended 
and He calls for me to come, 
Just know, I’ve always loved you.
Please take care of everyone. 

Fly me to your paradise, 
Through the midnight sky, 
Take me to your heavenly place, 
If only for a while.

Lead me to my loved ones, 
The ones I surely miss, 
So I can see them once again, 
To hug, to hold, to kiss.

We would chat and laugh aloud, 
The way we did back then, 
Walk together hand in hand, 

Fly me to your paradise, 
Fly me way up high, 
So we can be together, 
If only for a while.

If only I had known, had realised,
I would not have looked out of the window
as the dashing young man
rode along our street,
his hat worn cockily,
riding a frisky bay horse,
hooves clattering, mane flying,
rearing up before our windows!

If I had only known, had realised,
I would not have dressed up for him,
or woven a scarlet ribbon
into my hair;
or risen so early, before dawn,
or rush to the edge of the village,
or got my feet soaked in dew,
or watched the road
to see if he would come along,
falcon on his wrist.

If I had only known, had realised!

If I had only known, had realised,
I would not have waited late into the evening,
sitting sadly on the little hill
near our old well,
longing and hoping -
Will he not come - my beloved,
Will he not come to water his horse?

If I had only known, had realised


i would put sea in land, 
gold liquid in blood veins, 
send rain with currency notes attached to droplets, 
transform all humans to aquatic fish, 
having a mermaid like disposition, 
living in all equality with bundles of salt, 
for their plethora of misdeeds, 
charging them with the highest treason, 
sweeping them away like piece of dirt, 
with cheap broomsticks of twined bamboo.
then there would be, 
no poverty, indiscreet trampling of deprived, 
no panic stricken, aggrieved, mutilated, 
no innocent assaulted, 
by powerhouses of wealth and illegitimate pride, 
no shivering in chilly winters, 
no dying of sun strokes, 
no scope for inflicted brutalism, 
no supply of hazardous narcotic, 
absolute prohibition of life ending liquor, 
manufactured in dilapidated breweries, 
complete harmony amongst all tribes in flesh, 
beheading sinful chapters of mutual racism, 
dulling the nerves of rampant blood shed, 
elimination of traumatized anecdotes, 
of premature death, 
through vehicular clashes, 
air, water and rail collisions, 
no mammoth crowds flocking for, 
oil, petrol, gas, essential fodder for survival, 
no palaces for some, 
and unbaked cow dung plaster huts for others, 
uprooting all kinds of glamour, 
reinforcing it with simplistic existence, 
no indecent portrayal of stalwarts, 
sacrificing personal lives, releasing us from jaws of captivity, 
no inflation, unauthorized storage of food grain, 
no urchins left like garbage, 
in clammy interiors of unkempt orphanages, 
i would evaporate every trace of crime, 
with complete equality nestling in all quarters, 
all this and a host to follow, 
as i wish and pray fervently


If only mankind new.


   

In all holy wars between religious factions, 


He can speak every language


In the universe, 


  .  . .. 

NOBODY WINS NOBODY! 


  .  .. 

NOBODY LIVES IN PEACE

If only to suspect that, that hasn't been conquered yet.
With feeling discontent the words are mentioned.
Like the forgotten invention.
The art of prevention.

If only to suspect that, that hasn't been reached yet.
With a smiling face I'm going to another convention.
A man on a mission.
With thousands of people who are just not listening.

Can you hear me now





Then. I'd have loved you more invincibly than I loved anyone on this gigantically inscrutable Universe; as poetry was all I had; all I was made up of in each of my veins; bone and breath; and what I penned was exactly what I thought; was exactly how I was; was exactly my truest identity; irrespective of any caste; creed; status or tribe. 

If only you knew who I was, 
who I’ve been, 
who I am, 
you would then know that 
you need me in your life 
so we can complement each other 
Trust me you can take me home to your mother.

Together we can change outlooks,  
better imperfections, 
send love in the other’s direction 
unselfishly, 
but this can’t happen  
‘cause I don’t know you 
and you don’t know me, 
although I want to, 
I’m incomplete.

As I open my mouth to speak: 
silence; 
take the pen to paper: 
no words; 
open the memoir of my life: 
blank pages. 
A part of me is missing. 
I was born this way.

But if only you knew who I was, 
who I’ve been, 
who I am, 
you would know that without you, 
I am not fully me nor am I complete. 
I’m still wondering 
if we will ever be or 
if this all occurred in my dreams. 

Less and less people
Seem to care
About each other
And more about their
Material belongings
Their clothes, their car
If they loved more people
The world would be a far
Better place for everyone
We'd see more respect
If people knew better
They'd be able to connect
To others with empathy, 
Understanding and kind
If people loved people
We'd have happier minds


If drowning in the fathomlessly treacherous ocean seems inevitable; why not
start to stupendously relish the unbelievably tangy spray of the sea on 
every pore of your nakedly impoverished skin, 

If falling from the absolute epitome of Everest seems inevitable; why not start to passionately embrace every draught of exuberant air; as you unstoppably plummeted like thunderbolts of lightening towards heartless ground, 

If being bitten by the diabolically ominous serpent seems inevitable; why not start to unfathomably admire its majestically unconquerable hood; as it uncontrollably quivered under the pristinely impeccable light of the midnight moon, 

If being victimized by acrimoniously slandering isolation seems inevitable; 
why not start to unceasingly kiss the tranquil silence with the periphery of your rubicund lips; even as there wasn't a trace of civilization till countless centuries apart, 

If being excoriated into nothingness whilst trapped in a lion's cage seems inevitable; why not start to tirelessly feast your eyes upon the unflinching patriotism; that wafted from every ingredient of your blood that now almost overwhelmed the fabric of the Universe, 

If being slit open by a demonically gleaming knife seems inevitable; why not
start to mesmerize every cranny of the whites of your eye; with its magical
gleam even at the cruelest hour of the ribald night, 

If satanically crucifying starvation seems inevitable; why not start to fondle and massage each of your pathetically tyrannized bone; to the most ultimate epitomes of ecstasy and satisfaction, 

If cadaverously penalizing blindness seems inevitable; why not start to envisage the entire world as a paradise of uninhibited nakedness; eternally dancing in the winds of sensuously untamed blackness, 

If horrendously subjugating deafness seems inevitable; why not start to treat your ears only to the most opulently luxurious and vivaciously tinkling earrings, 

If heinously traumatizing poverty seems inevitable; why not start to fantasize about perpetually floating in the clouds; away from every earthly pleasure; and without a cloth to engulf your ebullient form, 

If the despairingly deteriorated gallows of jail seem inevitable; why not
start to wholesomely blindfold your effulgent eyes; and cognize a life after
this currently destitute lifetime of yours, 

If being buried under the gorily invidious avalanche seems inevitable; why
not start to ardently play and blend with the royally untainted iceflakes; being insurmountably tantalized by their velvety caress; just like a newly born child, 

If being salaciously torn apart from your beloved seems inevitable; why not
start to fervently appreciate the inexhaustible tenacity with which your heart still throbbed; for the destined remainder of your life, 

If being lost in the inexplicably gigantic labyrinth of tunnels seems inevitable; why not start to be enchanted and till the very last breath of your life; by the 
astoundingly pitch-dark stillness, 

If being pugnaciously aborted right in the womb of your mother seems inevitable; why not start to think that this was the greatest blessing that your mother could ever dream of bestowing upon you; even before you were born, 

If walking through an endless field of acridly abstruse thorns seems inevitable; why not start to feel perennially blessed; as the blood profusely oozing from your feet; unassailably enriched every ounce of spell-bindingly naked soil, 

If being crushed under the unstoppably speeding car seems inevitable; why
not start to feel that you're soon going to undergo; an unchallengeable world record for bearing maximum pain, 

If the unforgivable hands of death seem inevitable; why not start to unbelievably relish your expedition to either Heaven/Hell; feel like a quintessential ingredient of the boundaries of the uncannily unknown,  

And if treacherously besmirching rape seems inevitable; why not start to 
unprecedenteldy enjoy every conceivable contact of  skin with ignited skin; 
why not undyingly enjoy the ultimate dewdrops of virility; now sinfully but
eventually amalgamating two bodies as one. 

If seeing is believing, then I'm more than would have known, 
To see my words down in print,  now written in this poem.

If seeing is believing, then I see clearer then once did, 
For all this life was given, was all I needed then to live.

Accomplishing all I was formed to be, in my daily walks and haunts.

If seeing is believing, then why don't others view? 
The same it is my eyes have seen,  making better of a you? 

If seeing is believing, worlds and nations then would be
Living in peace and harmony, for more than just centuries.

Some views are blurred and foggy, not as I would pray they be.

If I were you real sister 
I would have been the first who touched your tiny feet when you were born
If I were you real sister 
I would have thought you how to play and walk
If I were you real sister 
The first word that came out of your mouth would be "Akka"
If I were you real sister 
I would have carried you everywhere 
If I were you real sister 
I would have known your friends
If I were you real sister 
I would have been you best friend in your ups and downs
If I were you real sister 
I would have been the first person to know your love
If I were you real sister 
You would have look up to me for everything
But 

May be if it was real we would have been fighting pulling our hair (like many other do) 
Thought we are not real sister’s we may be reel sister’s with loads of love.. 

I wish u a wonderful Happieeeeee B’day 
. 
Ten thousand years from now,
And smell—if still your orchards bear
Tart apples on the bough—

The early windfall under the tree,
And see the red fruit shine,
I cannot think your thoughts will be
Much different from mine.

Should at that moment the full moon
Step forth upon the hill,
And memories hard to bear at noon,
By moonlight harder still,
Form in the shadow of the trees, —
Things that you could not spare
And live, or so you thought, yet these
All gone, and you still there,

A man no longer what he was,
Nor yet the thing he'd planned,
The chilly apple from the grass
Warmed by your living hand—

I think you will have need of tears;
I think they will not flow;
Supposing in ten thousand years
Men ache, as they do now

'Tis a fabric of subtle distinction. 
For street wear it is superb. 
The chic of the Rue de la Paix-- 
The style of Fifth Avenue-- 
The character of Regent Street-- 
All are expressed in this new fabric creation. 
Leather-like, but feather-light-- 
It drapes and folds and distends to perfection. 
And it may be had in dull or glazed, 
Plain or grained, basket weave or moired surfaces! 


Subtly distinctive as a fabric fair; 
Nor Keats nor Shelley in his loftiest ode 
Could thrum the line to tell how it will wear.


The flair, the chic, that is Rue de la Paix, 
The style that is Fifth Avenue, New York. 
The character of Regent Street in May-- 
As leather strong, yet light as any cork. 
All these for her in this fair fabric clad. 
(Light of my life, O thou my Genevieve!) 
In surface dull or glazed it may be had-- 
In plain or grained, moired or basket weave. 

if the apple blossom, the cherry or the plum
were pink or white or peach or any such colour
perhaps we did not know in the beginning

only beginning to sense the lavishness
and that the wind took them away

so that they scattered at our feet
and we were the flower girls then and twirled
ourselves soft petals in the winds

and this was april, sometimes march
very rarely may but anyway spring
and we could spell all the pastels

the colour green and break off into singing
anything we were so glad to live in the world with flowers
to feel ourselves flowerlike

the honor of this,  to dream we were the
bridesmaids of Song
we longed for o our whole lives long.

Fine go ahead, with a clicky click, click take.
Wait, hang on a second I didn't put on my smiling face.
Now try try and try. 
For with my ugliness the camera might just break.

Do you want to take a picture? 
Fine go ahead, with a clicky click, click take.
Wait, hang on a second I didn't put on my smiling face.
Now try try and try. 
For with my ugliness the camera might just break.

If it does don't expect me pay.
And if you have pour gasoline on yourself, 
light the fire and jump out story window just to get the images out of your head.
Just don't expect me to feel guilty.

Do you want take a picture? 
Fine go ahead, with a clicky click, click take.
Wait, hang on a second I didn't put on my smiling face.
Now try try and try. 
For with my ugliness the camera might just break.

Do you want take a picture.
Fine go ahead, with a clicky click, click take.
Wait, hang on a second I didn't put on my smiling face.

Don't say I didn't warn you if the camera it breaks. 

If the clouds showered gold instead of rain; the minutest trace of poverty would be annihilated from earth, 
The indigent beggars on the street would catapult in sheer ecstasy; stashing as much of coin as they ever dreamt of; in their ragamuffin bags. 

If the clouds showered gold instead of rain; marriages round the globe would occur in chambers of impeccable silk, 
With the bride extravagantly embellished in silken cloth; and the bridegroom completely bereft of the onerous tension to earn. 

If the clouds showered gold instead of rain; the commoner would traverse on glistening roads of molded yellow, 
The thieves would forget to pilfer; and the Mafia would forget to maraud; as they were now blessed with opulence right from the colossal sky. 

If the clouds showered gold instead of rain; man would incorporate his house with gigantic slabs of the same, 
Articulately sculpturing his plates of the gold; ravenously consuming his food from it; profoundly lost in the scintillating glitter. 

If the clouds showered gold instead of rain; people would be saved from the tyranny of monotonous work, 
Transit from realms of despondency to one replete with ebullience; easily perishing the desire to perspire and slog. 

If the clouds showered gold instead of rain; clusters of birds would utilize gold in place of threadbare twigs to construct their nests, 
The armory of their eggs would hatch in an ambience of ostentatious gold; blended with profuse opulence. 

If the clouds showered gold instead of rain; abhorrent termites would tenaciously gnaw in their deadly pincers, 
They would be treated to a ravishing meal of currency coin for a change; were absolutely delighted; after being used to painstakingly nibbling decayed wood.

If the clouds showered gold instead of rain; severely afflicted patients would leave their disdainful hospital beds, 
Run out rampantly on the streets refraining to rue their pain; spreading out their febrile palms to clasp the gold. 

If the clouds showered gold instead of rain; the fighter pilots flying at unprecedented heights in the sky would forget to fire a fleet of hostile grenade, 
They would be too busy to concentrate on the pugnacious war; open the door of the cockpit to get hold of the gold. 

If the clouds showered gold instead of rain; every individual would feel overwhelmingly blessed initially; with the rigmarole and turmoil to work completely diminishing, 
However the plants sprouting from soil would die a gruesome death; the animal kingdom would fatally relinquish breath; 

And the most treasured species of man would disastrously succumb without crystal water; which was now replaced by gold in all forms and traces, 
Therefore it is my humble plea to you O! Divine creator; to shower upon the earth bountiful rain; wherein lies impregnated abundantly; the true spirit and the true gold. 


I don’t believe 
That I believed it before
I am insisted not to trust it
That I was believed

Last night what I dreamt
Ingrained a paradox in my present
In the difficulty of avoidance and acceptance
The judgment sways to here and there 

From the culture I was given 
Lives in me as metaphysical sign
From the knowledge I am derived
Conflicts in me as a voiceless sound

The dream that I have seen that night 
Not the dream that ever before I dreamt
Such a thing how it filmed in mind
Though I never ever thought of kind

I cannot explain because of you
You might not believe because of me
Though it’s a dream that belonged to me
Hide it and keep it since witness of you

I go to past and then come to present
Logics and ethics that together fly down
I cannot see the mirror with that dream
I wish, if it same way comes to me again


If the heart of a man is deprest with cares,
The mist is dispell'd when a woman appears;
Like the notes of a fiddle, she sweetly, sweetly
Raises the spirits, and charms our ears.
Roses and lillies her cheeks disclose,
But her ripe lips are more sweet than those.
Press her,
Caress her,
With blisses,
Her kisses
Dissolve us in pleasure, and soft repose


If the moon on the skies does not roam,
But cools, like a seal above,
My dead husband enters the home
To read the letters of love.

He remembers the box, made of oak,
With the lock, very secret and odd,
And spreads through a floor the stroke
Of his feet in the iron bond.

He watches the times of the meetings
And the signatures' blurry set.
Hasn't had he sufficiently grievings
And pains in this word until that

If the reflection in the mirror wasn't smiling
While I was standing there and grinning like a fool
If my feelings always had more clarification
Then everything would be so much easier to do-
It just seems I'm always dealing with a multitude-
Of things that need my immediate attention
While only living in remembrance of loving you

Daddy worked like a dog to make a livin' 
And it seems it ain't no different for what I do
I've seen a million yesterdays of not winnin'- 
It's gone and got me at a loss for what's the truth-
Heaven knows that it ain't for want of believing
That tomorrow holds somethin' good I never knew-
Still I keep comin' back and keeping on for one reason-
It's only livin' in the remembrance of loving you

And though it's like going through hell to get to heaven
But rainbows only happen up with the blues
And her lovin' raises my spirits like a leaven
I feel like I can have my cake and eat it too-
And when I look into the eyes of all my children
I know that what's most precious don't make news-
And everyday life a prayer of thanks, never ceasing-
When it's only livin' in the remembrance of loving you. 

If the sun is gold, to be found
In the sky with clouds—high and sound, 
Then every mind seeking wealth there
In doing so as each may care
Then will look for ways to ascend.
Even try to have wings extend
To reach up there without delay, 
To consume as much in their way.
If minds are adept to do so, 
Will their deeds cease the sun to glow? 
If that happens, what is the fate? 
Will life keep on to generate? 
Will the dark plunge minds to doom? 
There has to be when minds must groom
To dwell in kindness forever
For harmony to live longer. 

Writing another fast song.
Writing another slow song.

Passing the time.
My head is spinning then it is gone.
A long overdrawn sad tragic goodbye.
Painting the glorious skies.
Heavens rebirth.

Wheels ground down to the bare rims.
Sparks flying.
Putting axles right in reverse.
Full speed, cockpit ready.
Heart like a rock, solid and steady.
My mind is a pouring fountain of the perverse.
An simulation, to the starvation.

Enduring through it all over and over again.
This story has no ending.
No perfections, or pretty meaningful quotes.
It is something I wrote.
Not to gloat, but the truth to burn.

Images invade my dreams.
The changing of the sun.
When will it finally come? 
Watching the world come undone.
At the seams.
We need a quick patch job.
It is to keep it going.
Don't worry if the boats leaking keep rowing.
We have more then enough time to make it ashore.
Risks so great, and we underestimate.
There is no map to where we haven't traveled.
Blind folded, dizzy, and swinging at a donkey full of candy.
All to have a good time.

Running ourself ragged each and everyday.
Hunger like a plague it is spreading.
Equal and fairness in the hands of so few.
Who gets to decide for you? 
What if I told you I don't want to? 

The bad guy in so many eyes.
A man without a conscience, without a soul.
Tell me why he should be the one in control? 
You say well at least he ain't bias.
No your right he hates everybody the same.

So many names.
Masked demons.
Walking dead scourge.
A million dotted splurges.
A walk in front of cameras for all to see.
He is neither ashamed or remorseful.
He just ripped you off and he is all smiles, and denials.
Nah your right he would never do that.

But I just think you got some smoke in your eyes.
Burning right through the disguise.
Because his words are just not that smooth.
Feeding egos like fires.
Don't give them to much or they will get way to high.
The point of no return.
How far is it? 
Have we already reach it.
Do we even care? 
This is our one and only shot.
For the sake of all humanity.
If you even get this message. 
If you can even hear me.
Let me be the voice forever stuck on repeat.
We can prevent so much.
I've seen both worlds.
Cast through a shadow of the horrible storms.
Scarred mother earth, but she still lives.
Breathing, and providing the life that still exist.
It is our choice.
It has always been our choice.
The path to self destruction is not so far off.
We already started on the journey.
And it only gets worse each year.
Soon this world will just disappear.
Let me ask you, can you live with that? 
A satisfied temporary bliss.
So much wasted.
So much precious.
We can still save it. 
We can still save it.  

If the world was crazy, you know what I'd eat?
A big slice of soup and a whole quart of meat,
A lemonade sandwich, and then I might try
Some roasted ice cream or a bicycle pie,
A nice notebook salad, and underwear roast,
An omelet of hats and some crisp cardboard toast,
A thick malted milk made from pencils and daisies,
And that's what I'd eat if the world was crazy.

If the world was crazy, you know what I'd wear?
A chocolate suit and a tie of eclair,
Some marshmallow earmuffs, some licorice shoes,
And I'd read a paper of peppermint news.
I'd call the boys 'Suzy' and I'd call the girls 'Harry,'
I'd talk through my ears, and I always would carry 
A paper unbrella for when it grew hazy
To keep in the rain, if the world was crazy.

If the world was crazy, you know what I'd do?
I'd walk on the ocean and swim in my shoe,
I'd fly through the ground and I'd skip through the air,
I'd run down the bathtub and bathe on the stair.
When I met somebody I'd say 'G'bye, Joe,'
And when I was leaving - then I'd say 'Hello.' 
And the greatest of men would be silly and lazy 
So I would be king.  if the world was cazy. 

If then the stars should fall
Who would speak your name? 
If then the universe should collapse
Who would hold your hand? 
If then time should end
Who would remember your smile? 
If then oblivion
Who? 

Then all the stars, that in their place
Have aeons roamed abroad, 
Would long ago have lost the trace

Then justice in the heart of man
Would be a fake-a senseless fraud; 
Each for himself alone would stand-

If there is a witness to my little life, 
To my tiny throes and struggles, 
He sees a fool; 
And it is not fine for gods to menace fools. 

If there were any words to find 
For what you mean to me my Mother
If there was a dollar for every time
That you loved me like no other
If there were anyone who e'er was blind
To my faults- 'twas you, small wonder! 
If there's any doubt you're one of a kind
You're laughter drowns its sound like thunder.

If I could replicate just one more heart
That touched the world like yours
I'd have to pass through that celestial arch
But I could not tote but a little part
Of what's bigger than the ocean's roar-
So I'll simply practice your magic art
Of making keys to every other heart's door.

For who could have taught me patiently
The many truths a child must learn
Tending to me from seed to tree
In whose twigs the fire of wisdom burns
Your beauty now in my children seen
Who like me in their own turn-
Will love others bigger than the sea. 
Just as you lived on your earthly sojourn. 

if they believe in a mad thing, 
how will you dissuade them? 
you with your little spade

digging holes in the sandbox
waiting for radiance to appear.
it may take years to notice

no matter that you try
with a handful of stones to get by, 
Light -  must be elsewhere.

icarus maybe lacking wings to fly
at the beginning, only
looked at clouds and thought

how high is high.
but you'll see farther, 
melting the sun outloud.

    That Life can show to me;
If on my aching brow may fall
    No freshening dew from Thee, -- 
If with no brighter light than this
    The lamp of hope may glow,
And I may only dream of bliss,
    And wake to weary woe;

If friendship's solace must decay,
    When other joys are gone,
And love must keep so far away,
    While I go wandering on, --

Wandering and toiling without gain,
    The slave of others' will,
With constant care, and frequent pain,
    Despised, forgotten still; 

Grieving to look on vice and sin,
    Yet powerless to quell
The silent current from within,
    The outward torrent's swell: 

While all the good I would impart,
    The feelings I would share,
Are driven backward to my heart,
    And turned to wormwood, there;

If clouds must ever keep from sight
    The glories of the Sun,
And I must suffer Winter's blight,
    Ere Summer is begun;

If life must be so full of care,
    Then call me soon to Thee;
Or give me strength enough to bear
    My load of misery.

Acton


Hope gives in to longing thought, 
of all desires that I've sought.
A wanton heart might now be caught, 
if this be love, that you have brought.

Can love.. 

hope.. 

grow where pain abides; 
Where doubt and fear are justified? 
I willingly throw both arms wide, 
if faith can bring you to my side.

Give in! give in! My heart cries out, 
For once find out what loves about.
These walls I've built so strong and stout, 
like Jericho, fall at your shout.

A newborn babe, my soul lies bare; 
vulnerable to trap and snare.
I gladly place all in your care.
If this be love.  

that we would share.

If thou'lt be mine, the treasures of air, 
Of earth, and sea, shall lie at thy feet; 
Whatever in Fancy's eye looks fair, 
Or in Hope's sweet music sounds most sweet, 
Shall be ours -- if thou wilt be mine, love! 

Bright flowers shall bloom wherever we rove, 
A voice divine shall talk in each stream; 
The stars shall look like world of love, 
And this earth be all one beautiful dream 
In our eyes -- if thou wilt be mine, love! 

And thoughts, whose source is hidden and high, 
Like streams that come from heaven-ward hills, 
Shall keep our hearts, like meads, that lie 
To be bathed by those eternal rills, 
Ever green, if thou wilt be mine, love! 

All this and more the Spirit of Love 
Can breathe o'er them who feel his spells; 
That heaven, which forms his home above, 
He can make on earth, wherever he dwells, 
As thou'lt own, -- if thou wilt be mine, love

If walls could talk what would they say? 
Anything and everything come whatever may
Forget about the past and live only for today
Life is very short and will soon pass away

Walls cannot see nor can they hear
A cry for help or the shedding of a tear
When you need a friend and you're all alone
No one to talk to because all have gone

If walls could talk what would you say? 
Please send me someone that I don't have to pay  
To talk awhile with me then go on their way
Then I'll see the sunshine on a brand new day

Some walls are invisible and can't be seen by another
We know that it's there so we begin to say why bother
Walls can be torn down and with such a great fall
We're created to live together here on earth after all




Just remembering that, makes you feel as you're seeing the heavens after you were blind.
Remembering my dad pushing me while I was riding makes me feel out of my mind.
Remembering my sister hiding from me above the tree, and I got tired of find. 


Remembering my father raising me up on his shoulders, to fly the kite. 
Remembering, while me and my sister having the same toy, then we go in a fight, 
then I get mad, and complain to my dad, suddenly I find in my hand a bite, 
then I start crying, my dad suddenly come and hit me. Oh everything is white.


Remembering my dad taking me from my hand to learn me the Holy Qura'n. 
Remembering, while me and my friends hanging  the lanterns of Ramadan.
Remembering my dad be proud of me and taking me to the job by his van.
Remembering my Mum making a cup cake even if I get older and be a man.  

Memories just when I remeber it, I feel that I'm touching the stars. 
And when I get back to my mind.. I say why we're continueing these wars. 

If we could be brought to the surface
like a gleaming fish and served for supper,
if we could eat and swallow our own life
to make a good meal, if we could go fishing
for ourselves and feed on the gleaming
swimmer below the surface of our skin-
the fish that is our slippery life
and death. 

Where the sea meets the shore and the sand wets the feet
Where rainfall is epic, and has flooded the street
When the wind blows so strongly, it uproots the trees
Nature can bring every day to its' knees

Where the rivers flow faster and embankments recede
Where the cold and the snow mean our fingers will freeze
When the hottest of summers, dries up all the land
Nature is something we can't understand

Where the channels of governments block our reserve
Where we reap what we sow, and not what we deserve
When we all put our uses to help us prevail
Maybe we can succeed, or we might all just fail


If we must die, let it not be like hogs
Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,
While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,
Making their mock at our accursed lot.
If we must die, O let us nobly die,
So that our precious blood may not be shed
In vain; then even the monsters we defy
Shall be constrained to honor us though dead!
O kinsmen! we must meet the common foe!
Though far outnumbered let us show us brave,
And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow!
What though before us lies the open grave?
Like men we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack,
Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back

If you are angry
face your anger
as a friend, in love.
Meet your anger 
in non violence
with sympathy, 
and with a loving heart.



Borders closed rules in place, police are ready, and the faith is safe.
You oppress our people and give them no choice.
You suppress our people and take away our voice.
We will knock down the walls lets begin, again
If we are forced to believe that is not faith it is mental slavery.

Solution it is in the words that need to be heard
Evolution of the thought process that’s the word
Revolution of the mind and then it is a matter of time
Until the mind finds the means to an end
If we are forced to believe that is not faith it is mental slavery.

The mental slavery of you and me
For this lifetime for our eternity
Don’t you think it is time to be free? 
This needs to be said
We are no longer walking among the living dead.

Right is right and wrong is wrong 
Why won’t you let us sing our song
Blind, deaf, and dumb, now you have maimed us, you think that you have won
We know you are wrong, without ears, eyes, or tongue, 
I hear our voices rising in one glorious song
If we are forced to believe that is not faith that is mental slavery. 

You are followed
And I pleaded 
In return
I was chased

You are followed
And I was erudite
In the time
I was raced

You are not followed
And not plead
In that case
I am not chased
I am not raced

If you are free
Not far for me
Come to you
Come to me
Would give my arms
To embrace you'If you are old and have the shakes,
If all your bones are full of aches,
If you can hardly walk at all,
If living drives you up the wall,
If you're a grump and full of spite,
If you're a human parasite,
THEN WHAT YOU NEED IS WONKA–VITE!
Your eyes will shine, your hair will grow,
Your face and skin will start to glow,
Your rotten teeth will all drop out
And in their place new teeth will sprout.
Those rolls of fat around your hips
Will vanish, and your wrinkled lips
Will get so soft and rosy–pink
That all the boys will smile and wink
And whisper secretly that this
Is just the girl they want to kiss!
But wait! For that is not the most
Important thing of which to boast.
Good looks you'll have, we've told you so,
But looks aren't everything, you know.
Each pill, as well, to you will give
AN EXTRA TWENTY YEARS TO LIVE!
So come, old friends, and do what's right!
Let's make your lives as bright as bright!
Let's take a dose of this delight!
This heavenly magic dynamite!
You can't go wrong, you must go right!
IT'S WILLY WONKA'S WONKA–VITE!

Really I envy the men and women who sleep under the Banyan tree 
when hot sun kills us inside the cemented vaults, without fans
wind, sweet and smoothening, pleasantly fans the pennyless guy
oh, what a cool breeze full of oxygen rich supply, 
love his luxurious naps, I dweller of flats, flat gasping for health.

Now, what would a dying fish ask for, but a little water to breathe
what would a falling leaf ask for, only a branch tender to hang on
what could we humans ask for, but a red tulip showered all along
from the heavenly arms of divine, just nothing, no world can match
no coffer can equal, no vision could take you to the land of paradise
but the beep, the bell that chimes and takes you to the room of wise.

There is a Harun Al Rashid story, a beggar who asks to be hurt 
when a coin is dropped in his bowl, just to remind his guilt
now, when the coin of desire rolls down my bowl of pleasure
I kneel down before, in pure obeisance, like a slave mother, 
Oh Caliph of Caliphates, King of Kingdoms, Emperor of Empires, 
Oh king of kings, oh god of gods, Oh thousand eyed, Miracle head, 
Who would drink from the water of the well, who hath drunk one drop of wine from the golden chalice of yonder altar that dwells in your bed. 

My love, my love, if you could come once more
From your high place,
I would not question you for heavenly lore,
But, silent, take the comfort of your face. 

I would not ask you if those golden spheres
In love rejoice,
If only our stained star hath sin and tears,
But fill my famished hearing with your voice. 

One touch of you were worth a thousand creeds.
My wound is numb
Through toil-pressed, but all night long it bleeds
In aching dreams, and still you cannot come. 

Some say redemption is easy.
But when your hands are so bloody.
How can you just wash them clean? 
Like it never happen.
Completely innocent you say.
Then where was your vigilance while it was happening? 
Ignorance is a excuse without reason.
We should never accept it with a hand shake and a smile.
Bliss is only temporary.
Consequences must be faced.
Pain you must taste, before it can be truly felt.
Some say we only have to live with the hands we are dealt.
But we trade these cards for better ones all the time.
For some it requires hard work.
Others they bully people for them.
And yet even more stoop to thievery and manipulation.
A prize sits upon the highest roof top.
All you have to do is push this other guy off to get it.
Can you do it? 
All for something a little easier.
Convenience sits at mans door step.
He will lie for it.
He will fight for it.
He will kill for it.
And finally he will die for it.
Effort requires energy the lazy people of the time don't have.
They envelope their minds false and half truths to only feel a little better.
Build up the broken self esteem so it can be broken again.
A repetition in tiresome lessons.
Some will just never get it.
You don't do something because you have to.
You do it because you want to.
Getting up early in the morning.
Shoving a cup of coffee into your face.
Going to work, to come back to your own home.
Seeing some one stuck in the snow, will you help them? 
Or pretend you didn't see them so you don't get delayed.
Time matters to some too much when comes too money to be made.
How about if you see some women being brutally attacked.
Will risk your life to save her? 
And what reasons sit behind it? 
Are you so fearful you say screw her and just let her die? 
Are you so desperate you'll use it as a attempt to get laid.
'Hey now that your alright lets go back to my place.'
Is that your pickup line? 
Or you actually a caring person when one is need? 
Pleading for just a tid bit of help.
Selfishness is not only described by things you do for yourself.
But as things you do for others that also benefits you.
You have made many trades and left most of your guilt behind.
Even with the world so you think.
All the scores have been settled in one fell swoop.
No going back in for seconds.
If you couldn't get right the first time.
Then your just wasting my time. 

You're not just cutting the tree's artistically
slender branches; but by doing so you're infact
barbarously cutting the inimitably priceless hands of
triumphantly vivacious Mother Nature, 

You're not just plucking the tree's gorgeously affable
leaves; but  by doing so you're infact torturously
plucking the unparalleled divine sensitivity; of
spellbindingly undefeated Mother Nature, 

You're not just indenting the tree's poignantly
gregarious trunk; but by doing so  you're infact
sadistically indenting the unassailably jubilant
chastity of unbelievably proliferating Mother Nature, 

You're not just abusing the tree's incongruously
uninhibited contours; but by doing so you're infact
outrageously abusing the pricelessly unabashed swirl
of peerlessly undefeated Mother Nature, 

You're not just defecating on the tree's innocuously
protruding and sprawled roots; but by doing so you're
infact sacrilegiously defecating on the unshakably
redolent embodiments of wondrously enthralling Mother Nature, 

You're not just chopping the tree's merrily swaying
tendrils; but by doing so you're infact deliriously
chopping the perennially fructifying innocence of
gloriously Omnipotent Mother Nature, 

You're not just trimming the tree's ecstatically
liberated outgrowths; but by doing so you're infact
unnecessarily trimming the beautifully venerated womb
of victoriously blessing Mother Nature, 

You're not just kicking the tree's bountifully
untainted stem; but by doing so you're infact
ruthlessly kicking the sacredly spawning bosom of
brilliantly unfettered Mother Nature, 

You're not just peeling the tree's rustically majestic
corrugations; but by doing so you're infact
pervertedly peeling the invincibly silken skin of
effulgently burgeoning Mother Nature, 

You're not just burning the tree's unflinchingly
valiant wood; but by doing so you're infact insanely
burning the fearlessly formidable strength of
ebulliently cavorting Mother Nature, 

You're not just victimizing the tree's indisputably
royal foliage; but by doing so you're infact
truculently victimizing the insuperably unbridled
sensuality of ubiquitously ever-pervading Mother Nature, 

You're not just disorienting the tree's ardently
boisterous nests; but by doing so you're infact
hedonistically disorienting the eclectically
fascinating solar plexus of royally everlasting Mother Nature, 

You're not just ridiculing the tree's endlessly
inscrutable labyrinth of hollows; but by doing so
you're infact nefariously ridiculing the unfathomably
enigmatic belly of stupendously ameliorating Mother Nature, 

You're not just jailing the tree's effervescently
nubile body with an unceasing jugglery of devilishly
stabbing electric wire; but by doing so you're infact
unforgivably jailing the infallibly supreme identity
of impeccably Omnipresent Mother Nature, 

You're not just nailing the tree's immortally fragrant
heart; but by doing so you're infact diabolically
nailing the celestially undaunted fabric of
ecstatically frolicking Mother Nature, 

You're not just dumping the tree's philanthropically
unimpeachable cradle with your fetid garbage can
trash; but by doing so you're infact reproachfully
dumping the mellifluously humming mouth of exuberantly
evolving Mother Nature, 

You're not just bombarding the tree's timelessly
gargantuan splendor; but by doing so you're infact
baselessly bombarding the perennially beautiful
virility of unlimitedly stupefying Mother Nature, 

You're not just spitting upon the tree's resplendently
beaming face; but by doing so you're infact
unpardonably spitting on the impregnably spotless
heavenliness of vivaciously magical Mother Nature, 

You're not just uprooting the tree from its very
eternally compassionate soil; but by doing so you're
infact sinfully uprooting the quintessentially blessed
existence of benevolently healing Mother Nature, 

So always remember O! salaciously greedy man; that the
next time you  wretchedly pulverize; abuse; trade and
victimize Mother Nature; you'll be infact demonically
asphyxiating your very own Omniscient mother to the
most ghastly death; as your's and everyone else's
mother was first and foremost born out of the womb of
Mother Nature; was first and foremost the child of

Different Poems

 IT WAS SOON GOING TO RAIN

The squirrels suddenly commenced to boisterously
gallivant through the branches; jubilantly diffusing
into a festoon of uninhibitedly ecstatic sounds, 

The rivers suddenly increased their pace a trifle; 
ardently clashing against the resplendently glittering
rocks that confronted them in their way, 

The roses suddenly came back to vibrant life after the
sullen day; triumphantly radiating an unsurpassable
ocean of unassailably mesmerizing scent, 

And a cradle of voluptuously crimson clouds suddenly
embellished the sky; enveloping its fathomlessly
barren periphery with stupendously spell binding color and grace, 

O! Yes; your guess was as good as anybody else's on
this gargantuan planet; the truculent tyranny of heat
was soon about to disappear into the aisles of
nothingness; it was soon going to thunderously rain.



The sparrows suddenly started to ebulliently whistle; 
euphorically deluging every cranny of this fathomless
atmosphere with an everlasting entrenchment of
fantastically enamoring sounds, 

The kangaroos suddenly sprinted in air like never
before; ecstatically racing through the unfathomably
timeless wilderness; with the astronomically
indefatigable enthrallment of Mother nature in their stride, 

The eggs suddenly hatched into the most fabulously
beautiful of fledglings; permeating the fabric of the
gloomy air around with an unrelenting volley of
divinely new born life and sound, 

And a blanket of gorgeously titillating clouds
suddenly enlightened the sky; majestically painting
its empty belly with streaks of poignantly
compassionate and everlasting empathy, 

O! Yes; your guess was as good as anybody else's on
this boundless planet; the salacious whiplash of
acrimonious heat was soon about to wholesomely
abnegate; it was soon going to indefatigably rain.



The lions suddenly pumped their fur an extravagant
trifle; victoriously parading through the insatiably
untamed outgrowths of; euphoric scarlet and green, 

The bells in the sacrosanct temple suddenly started to
incessantly ring; casting a spell of impregnably
mystical incantation; upon every religion; caste; and
alike; heavenly alike, 

The shadows suddenly started to mischievously flirt
with the vividly life-yielding ground; merrily
jingling even as the serene tranquility of dusk was a
overwhelmingly far-fetched cry, 

And an unconquerable cistern of enchantingly vibrant
clouds suddenly perpetuated the sky from all sides; 
irrevocably crowning it as a royal prince of all times, 

O! Yes; your guess was as good as anybody else's on
this endless planet; all satanically impeding sweat
was soon about to evaporate till times beyond infinite
infinity; it was soon going to miraculously rain.



The peacocks suddenly unveiled their feathers a
wholesomely profound blossom; disseminating a wave of
ravishing excitement in even the most infinitesimally
deadened particle in the lugubrious atmosphere, 

The bees suddenly started to melodiously sing and
dance; Omnisciently replenishing many a traumatically
agonizing heart; with a mountain of incomprehensibly
unending sweetness, 

The snakes suddenly forgot to horrifically bite; 
sensuously intermingling for times immemorial; with the last rays of the setting Sun, 

And a panoramically exotic canvas of enigmatic clouds
suddenly enshrouded the Herculean sky; impregnably
clinging to it like the ultimate seductress of its
impoverished life, 

O! Yes; your guess was as good as anybody else's on
this timeless planet; the mercilessly decimating
battlefield of belligerent heat was soon about to
crumble like a pack of cards; it was soon going to
perpetually rain.

 RAIN, RAIN AND TRIUMPHANT RAIN

Infinite bodies had pathetically shriveled into
nothingness; as blistering rays of the Sun unsparingly
blazed left; right and profuse center, 

Whirlpools of obnoxiously debilitating sweat oozed
from umpteenth arenas of the body; as boundless scores
of innocuous organisms; reeled under the vicious
onslaught of sweltering heat, 

Fathomless kilometers of panoramically lush green
land; now disdainfully metamorphosed into torturously
slithering and lambasted deserts, 

Pristine flakes of spell binding snow perched
delectably on the mountaintops; now abominably melted
in meek submission; under the ferocious inferno of the simmering afternoon, 

The boisterously vivacious branches of the mystical
forests; now bore a sullenly barren look; as the
leaves mercilessly crackled under the outrageously
fuming Sun, 

Unfathomable hordes of innocuously philandering
cattle; were now rendered to disgustingly hollow
skeletons of sordid dilapidation; as the soil
penuriously scorched everything in conceivable
vicinity, 

The corporate tycoon now looked like an insane lunatic
with bloodshot eyes; as the most spell bindingly
impeccable of his shirt; was now enveloped in
abhorrent pools of grime and sweat, 

The most tenaciously resilient of abodes now creaked
an inconspicuous trifle; cursing till beyond realms of
eternal eternity; as the wave of summer horrendously
augmented its acrid propensity, 

The most voluptuous nimble and enchanting soles; now
barbarically bled at all quarters; as the earth on
which they holistically transgressed; had now
transformed itself into insidiously torching charcoal, 

Denizens sluggishly snubbed each other in truculent
exasperation; as diabolical rays of the unrelenting
Sun; austerely pulverized their dormitories of
exotically bountiful fantasy, 

The most majestic of lions in the inscrutable jungle; 
dastardly retreated into their caves; unbelievably
forgiving their prey; as the treacherously unruly heat
took firm roots into their fur, 

Children wholesomely forgot their innocently
replenishing smiles; as the day progressed more
tyrannically than ever; putting hideously crippling
brakes on even the most infinitesimal of their
activity, 

The newly wedded relinquished all desire to love; as
the only thing that they were remorsefully overwhelmed
with; was the adversely admonishing and severely
reprimanding light of the midday Sun, 

All anecdotes of irrefutably sparkling honesty; now
converted into the graveyard of blatantly manipulative
lies; as entities staggered more brutally than ever
under the salaciously whipping carpet of ominous summer, 

The squirrels and kangaroos now transgressed as slow
as the pot-bellied tortoise; feeling the
preposterously invidious heat horrifically hamper
their otherwise; astoundingly vivacious reflexes, 

Resplendent river levels had dramatically reduced; 
with an unsurpassable army of crabs; snakes and ants; 
frantically scurrying out of the mud every now and
again; as the earth cooked like an unstoppable volcano inside, 

The most lightening paced of rambunctious spiders now
sat dolorously in one corner of their den; wholesomely
fatigued in the onerously persevering heat; to
ecstatically reconstruct their broken webs, 

Fireballs of sensuously drifting and timelessly
exhilarating breath; now seemed as frantically last
bid to enter the gory corpse; in a valiantly vain
attempt to elope from the tumultuous heat, 

The passionately palpitating beats of the immortal heart; were slowly losing their fervency; too exhausted in pumping blood for the pugnaciously sapped and burnt body; rather than pulsate for the spirit of unassailable love, 

And if there was ever an invincibly singleton solution
to all of the above; then it was nothing but the most
pricelessly proliferating form of the ALMIGHTY LORD; 
O! yes it was RAIN, RAIN AND TRIUMPHANT RAIN.

 IMMORTALLY NATURAL.

An infinitesimal fraction accentuated was the tip of
the flamboyantly towering hill; pompously soaring
towards the Omnipotently golden Sun, 

An inconspicuous fraction accentuated was the salt
entrapped in the ravishingly undulating waves; 
simmering in poignantly untamed desire; as the froth
emphatically clashed against the marvelous rocks, 

A capricious fraction accentuated were the blades of
perennial grass; overwhelmingly encapsulated with
coats of effusively profuse green and a tantalizingly
enthralling carpet of scintillating dewdrops, 

A transient fraction accentuated were the clouds in
the fathomlessly ebullient sky; extravagantly
enveloped with shades of embellished scarlet and
streaks of voluptuously thunderous lightening, 

An ethereal fraction accentuated were the philosophers
in the classroom; tumultuously over-doing their acts
of portraying an unfathomably unending repertoire of
human emotions, 

A fugitive fraction accentuated were the roses in the
blissful meadows; indefatigably blooming to caress the
walls of eternal paradise; profoundly enticing the
mischievously philandering bees for a quick kiss, 

A diminutive fraction accentuated were the speeches of
the manipulative politicians; spuriously promising the
masses of things; they perhaps might not be able to
ever witness even in an infinite more lifetimes, 

A mercurial fraction accentuated was the melting of
the incomprehensibly mammoth iceberg; at times
deliberating wailing as the Sun caressed it an instant
longer; with its compassionately magical rays, 

An ephemeral fraction accentuated was the painting of
the sensuously romantic artist; intransigently
overwhelming even the most tiniest iota of the barren
canvas; with vibrantly loquacious color, 

A parsimonious fraction accentuated was the
scintillating shark's tail; bombastically flashing
every now and again in rustically volatile frostiness, 

An evanescent fraction accentuated was the regally
soaring eagle in the sky; shamelessly exhibiting its
mesmerizing wings a trifle more than necessary; and
more unabashedly as each second unfurled into a
wholesome minute, 

A tiny fraction accentuated was the exhilaratingly
dancing peacock; at times stretching its feathers
beyond the dormitories of comfort; just to replenish
and rejoice in the wonderfully glorious rain, 

A minute fraction accentuated was the song of the
melodiously enchanting nightingale; leaving its
ecstatically relentless reverberations even centuries
unprecedented even after; it emanated its first voice, 

A miniature fraction accentuated was the animated leap
of the boisterous frogs; incessantly bouncing in the
sleazily stray monsoon ponds; throughout the fabric of
the exotically divine night, 

A bizarre fraction accentuated were the parties of the
disconcertingly dissatisfied business tycoons; 
baselessly blowing quintessentially precious moments
of veritably vital life; in meaningless wisps of cigar
smoke and wine, 

An insipid fraction accentuated was the stride of the
sluggishly languishing tortoise; as it took
imperceptibly marathon hours on the trot; to even
sprout its neck out of its obdurately motionless shell, 

A non-existent fraction accentuated was the march of
the victoriously exuberant soldiers; tirelessly
brandishing their unflinching brawn and sword; to
realms beyond infinite infinity, 

An indecipherable fraction accentuated was the
frequency of unconquerably timeless breath; at moments
inadvertently expunging out with truculently volatile
ferocity; to release the inner most chords of the bereaved soul, 

But immortally natural; uninhibitedly priceless; 
invincibly Omniscient; was their eternally gratifying
love; as each beat of their heart kept on rhythmically
bonding with all philanthropically benign; as each
beat of their heart bountifully coalesced into a
symbiotic journey of oneness; which lasted for an
endless more lifetimes.

 DAY VERSUS ROMANTIC NIGHT

The day swelteringly blazed in the tyranny of
unrelentingly acrimonious heat; disdainfully simmering
with abominably intolerable harshness, 
While an unfathomable pearl of majestic enchantment; 
was the entrenchment of the fabulously titillating and
frosty night.

The day relentlessly scorched even the most minuscule
of entity that came in the trajectory of its vicious
swirl; charring blissful angels into a pool of
unbearably smoldering perspiration, 
While a resplendently melodious festoon of enigmatic
voices; was the fabric of the sensuously enamoring and
voluptuous night.

The day hideously burnt fathomless islands of
poignantly nubile skin; invidiously tanning even the
most impeccably scintillating patches of princely white, 
While a maelstrom of unendingly romantic titillation; 
a world of eternally tranquil freedom; was the
bedsheet of the miraculously everlasting night.

The day propelled insanely ominous abuse; as the
unsparing heat of the ferociously truculent Sun
brutally asphyxiated priceless reserves of liquid from
the; pathetically staggering body, 
While a garland of profoundly heartwarming
graciousness; seductively placating the thirst of one
aroma of the marvelously embellished night.

The day was horrendously indescribable; with the
mercury soaring literally out of the thermometer; 
barbarically torching boundless kilometers of celestial
land and atmosphere, 
While an unsurpassable stream of tantalizing
effervescence; was the wave of the ebulliently dancing
and charismatic night.

The day was ungainly traumatic; with diabolical chains
of gorily boiling heat diabolically jeopardizing the
lives of all those innocuously harmonious, 
While a gloriously bountiful cushion of amiable
togetherness; a cistern of spell binding empathy; was
the profusely compassionate inferno of the regale
night.

The day was a stagnantly debilitating pond of sordid
perspiration; as every organism on this planet
inevitably broke into despicable sweat; under the
blistering cauldron of ever-augmenting heat, 
While a nimbly obeisant salutation to the Almighty
the effusively chirping garden of the vivaciously
phlegmatic night.

The day was an unavoidable nightmare that every entity
on this colossal Universe had to live through; 
manipulatively struggling amidst the hostile horde of
bloodsucking wolves to earn their quintessential livelihood, 
While a ubiquitous ocean of philanthropic brotherhood; 
a magical river in which all uninhibitedly melanged
irrespective of caste; creed or spurious color; was
the mesmerizing intoxication of the wonderfully
moonlit night.

And a derogatorily devilish betrayer was the
unprecedentedly flaming day; insidiously snapping even
the most celestial of relationships; as lambasting
heat triggered tempers to disconcertingly flare, 
While an unassailably grandiloquent smile of
friendship; an immortally unshakable bond of divine
love; a harbinger of peace and serenely humanitarian
friendship; was the invincible sky of the gorgeously
heavenly night.

 THE POWER OF OMNIPOTENT MUD

You might ferociously abuse it for being monotonously
threadbare; disdainfully infiltrating the whites of
your eye; with the truculently blowing winds, 

You might indignantly kick at it in your times of
inexplicable frustration; at times profusely wounding
it with the uncouthly cold-blooded tip; of your spurious shoes, 

You might heinously spit on its shades of
compassionate brown; barbarically trampling it left
right and center; to insanely diffuse the abominable
tensions circumventing your brain, 

You might place its value as capriciously invidious specks of grit and stone; hardly ever casting even the most fugitive of glance towards its poignantly amiable periphery, 

But remember; irrespective of your caste; creed; 
color; blood or race; you all will inevitably blend
with its sacrosanct belly after abnegating your last
breath; such was the power of unassailably Omnipotent
and bountiful mud.



You might ominously abhor the fact that it lay abreast your dwelling; proving a remorsefully indigent mismatch to your pillars and porch of stupendously embellished gold, 

shocking disbelief; on the pretentiously worthless
pretext of it harboring ungainly dust, 

You might treacherously stab it with unrelentingly salacious strokes of your gleaming knife; frantically searching for surreptitious canopies of pricelessly glittering gold, 

You might propagate it as being lugubriously
meaningless; fretfully stagnating in dustbins of
forlorn isolation for centuries unprecedented, 

But remember; irrespective of your caste; creed; 
color; blood or race; you all will inevitably blend
with its sacrosanct belly after abnegating your last
breath; such was the power of immortally Omniscient
and spell binding mud.



You might ruthlessly mold it into fathomless sizes and shapes; just to flex the muscles of your irascibly blood soaked palms, 

You might relentlessly castigate it for its despicably
impoverished demeanor; drive your cars like an untamed
prince over its innocuously wailing contours, 

You might sleazily sell it to the most derogatorily manipulative strangers; inundate your pockets with scintillating silver; while bulldozers tyrannically razed it to construct edifices that sailed haughtily towards blue sky, 

You might lackadaisically dump all your decaying feces
from your abode into its silken carpet; laughing every
side of your body out; as you triumphantly feasted
upon its victimized integrity, 

But remember; irrespective of your caste; creed; 
color; blood or race; you all will inevitably blend
with its sacrosanct belly after abnegating your last
breath; such was the power of pricelessly divine and
everlasting mud.



You might tirelessly ostracize its sordidly ungainly
complexion; for horrendously tainting the outlines of
your spotlessly bombastic and bohemian feet, 

You might christen it as dreadfully morose and perniciously ghoulish; as it fostered your pathetically wavering shadow even in the most brilliantly sparkling Sun, 

You might at times construe it as your worst enemy; as
its unwitting undulations made you disastrously
stumble and kiss a world of despondently diminutive dirt, 

You might call it blasphemously adulterated; as
organisms of all shapes and fraternities; perpetually
embraced its rudimentarily scented skin, 

But remember; irrespective of your caste; creed; 
color; blood or race; you all will inevitably blend
with its sacrosanct belly after abnegating your last
breath; such was the power of impregnably Omnipresent
and humanitarian mud.

 SO WHAT

So what if the Sun disappeared behind the crimson
clouds; rendering the fabulously fathomless township
in a blanket of solitarily placid darkness, 

So what if the Sun sunk in wholesome entirety behind
the gargantuan mountains; entirely abdicating even the
tiniest trace of graciously bright light, 

So what if the Sun pathetically mellowed down in
blazing complexion; dismally obfuscating even the most
overwhelmingly towering entity in visible vicinity, 

So what if the Sun preposterously appeared to be an
infinitesimal minnow; even infront of the most
capriciously fleeting shadow around, 

The voluptuously enthralling still greeted you like a
majestically unassailable prince; and believe me the
night was more stupendously enchanting than the
acrimoniously sweltering day.



So what if the Sun horrendously dimmed as the hours
frantically unleashed by; blinding the boundless
Universe in whirlpools of inexplicably inscrutable
blackness, 

So what if the Sun nervously started to flutter; as
sombre winds of timidly serene evening commence to
perseveringly take complete control, 

So what if the Sun inevitably developed shades of
subtle darkness; pathetically mitigating its
tumultuously blistering ferocity upon the trajectory
of this unendingly colossal planet, 

So what if the Sun bid a transient adieu to the
gigantically sprawling earth; soon after celestially
placating dusk enshrouded its magical subtlety from
every conceivable side, 

The seductively euphoric night was still your
eternally resplendent companion for the countless
instants ahead; and believe me the night was more
ebulliently exhilarating than the tenaciously
tyrannical and monotonous day.



So what if the Sun started to lackadaisically waver in
unfathomable sky; obnoxiously hiding behind the
thunderous conglomerate of lightening and clouds, 

So what if the Sun languidly stretched its ferociously
blistering palms for ethereal rest; eventually
melanging with the Omnipotent horizons, 

So what if the Sun abruptly decided to relinquish the
periphery of this scintillating earth; leaving the
world around in bizarre blackness; without the most
diminutive of insinuation or prior notice, 

So what if the Sun sporadically felt its rays being
irrevocably overpowered by the onset of the
ecstatically titillating evening; making holistic way
for nocturnal intricacies to impregnably transcend, 

The marvelously bountiful night was still there for
you to spell bindingly rejoice; and believe me the
night was more Omnisciently captivating than the
manipulatively besieged corporate day.



So what if the Sun resolutely shut down its formidably invincible shutters; at the first signs of ephemerally fickle minded dusk, 

So what if the Sun intractably refrained to
unbelievably blaze till centuries unprecedented on the
trot; without the slightest of rest or evanescent interlude, 

So what if the Sun remorsefully departed for its short lived abode; transiently evicting its insurmountably replenishing treasuries of optimism; till it shone once again at glorious dawn, 

So what if the Sun lost its tinges of flaming red and
triumphant resurgence; non-invasively giving way to
dastardly darkness to be the uncrowned prince for some time, 

The magnificently immortal night was still a blissful
messiah for you to uninhibitedly exult; and believe me
the night was more compassionately bonding than the
truculently scorching and unsparing day.

 NATURE'S GLAMOROUS BEAUTY

The earth's surface of solid crust, 
has been uplifted in the form of rust.

The densely foliated trees sway in their rustic dress, 
capturing the bleary eyes of a children cresh.

The wind blows, the gale comes, the mountain river chanting a perfect rhyme, that will make people forget ghastly crime, 
to have several days of relevant peace, and let insane bloodshed on earth cease.

The wild creepers murmur amongst themselves, 
the days freshness, the cologne smell.

The frothy waterfall, the heavenly day, 
the obnoxious mountains lined in the way.

Smiling in heavy consternation, the evening owl glared menacingly, quietly devouring freshly laid bird egg, butchering red walls of manly courage.

 PLACID AND PERFECT

The stream lit days of peace, 
flow past the agony of time, 
so quiet, so serene, so blissful, 
yielding their touch softly, bit by bit, 
cruising smoothly over the field of messy emotions, 
to give life to the tiny molecules of beginning, 
in a supreme entrenchment of their own.

Sweet tunes pierce suspended carpets of air, 
gorgeously tranquil and splendid, 
oozing out silent tremors of love, 
in circular rings of boisterous feelings, 
far distance away from the trapped world of
complications, 
in an ambience of mustard green dew drops, 
depicting short parables of perfect excitement, 
precarious with the fading of time.

 WHEN I SAW THE SUN RISING IN THE SKY

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; I felt waves of unparalleled enchantment
circumvent my persona, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; nascent pores embedded in my skin sprung
up with exuberant intensity, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; I felt waves of marathon despair deeply
embodied in me; vanish into thin wisps of oblivion, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; I felt besieged by volatile
gushes of resplendent light, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; stale pools of air in my lungs got
profoundly reinvigorated; revitalizing my dreary senses, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; I felt innovative perceptions about
beauty circulating wildly through intricate pores of my mind, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; I felt newly born droplets of sweat
trickle down my nape; washing away sins of the previous day, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; I felt golden beams of light
gently caress my obscured eyes, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; I felt an unprecedented vigor suddenly
impregnate my feeble veins, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; I felt a compassionate warmth engulfing me from all sides; annihilating completely the barbaric chill I had encountered in the night, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; I felt my legs rhythmically sway; my ears absorbedly focused to melodious chirping of the humming bird, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; I felt catapulted to supreme heights of ecstasy; 
with benevolent feelings of forgiveness slowly creeping in my soul, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; I felt the palpitations of my
heart grow faster; loads of enthusiasm embodied in my blood, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; I felt the color of my skin
dramatically change; 
it had now acquired tinges of robust crimson; profusely replacing patches of pallid flesh, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; it made me retrospect more nostalgically
about my past; forming a pellucid picture of my entity, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; I felt inundated with images of celestial gods; hovering very near my silhouette, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; I made a plethora of resolutions before
commencing nondescript activities of the day, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; I pictured all my ancestors
living in coordinated harmony as the rays emanating out, 

When I saw the sun rising in the sky; I dreamt about my love which was
immortal as the perpetual shine, 

And when I saw the sun rising in the sky; I conceived a new beginning to life; 
felt like bestowed with another opportunity to prove my mettle in this
unsparing world.

dawn; enlightening every cranny of despairingly

majesty,

infant; profoundly enrapturing monotonously usurped

barren canvas; embellishing the chapter of mundanely
manipulative survival today; with unceasingly copious

painstakingly from the scorched rocks; bounteously
perpetuating the sweltering atmosphere around with
unbelievably rhapsodic exhilaration, 

Be it in the faintly rupturing of the outlines of the
immaculate egg; blissfully announcing the arrival of
unparalleled exuberance; in a world of otherwise
preposterously shriveled decay, 

Be it in the premature formation of pearly white mists
in the sky; triggering a ray of tantalizingly
unsurpassable hope in one and all alike on bereaved
earth; that sensuous rain was soon about to fall,

even bit of the gruesomely bedraggled ambience around
with celestially tangy happiness,

minute of the day and night; Newness was what
unconquerably fuelled every ingredient of my blood to
pump life; O! Yes Newness was what my soul wanted to
seek till even countless births after I died.



Be it in the singular star that regally twinkled in
the grotestquely cloudy and foggily obfuscated night; 
granting glorious reprieve from a countless
inadvertently committed sins, 

Be it in the match-boxed minuscule hutment barren
without any quintessential amenity of life; yet with a
roof so compassionate; that it sequestered you from
the most devastating of storm and rain,

the bumble bee; spawning into cisterns of invaluably
harmonious nectar; a sweetness which no power on this
turgid earth could ever transcend or destroy,

wanted to seek till even countless births after I
died.

a pathetic facsimile of the very previous day!

 CAN NEVER EVOLVE

The field which uncontrollably cries while ploughing; 
can never evolve into majestically fructifying and
ebulliently blissful crop, 

The sea which pathetically cries while undulating; can
never evolve into fantastically vibrant and
tantalizingly ecstatic adventure, 

The desert which discordantly cries while being
heated; can never evolve into fathomlessly regale and
timelessly seductive majesty, 

The cloud which hedonistically cries while showering
rain; can never evolve into boundlessly enthralling
and enchantingly heavenly freshness, 

The waterfall which insidiously cries while cascading
on handsome rock; can never evolve into stupendously
amiable and vividly mystical reinvigoration, 

The mountain which abhorrently cries while defending; 
can never evolve into symbiotically unflinching and
peerlessly unassailable unity, 

The nightingale which fretfully cries while singing; 
can never evolve into timelessly ubiquitous and
unequivocally resplendent melody, 

The artist who deplorably cries while sketching; can
never evolve into spell bindingly refreshing and
unsurpassably enamoring magnetism, 

The soldier who dolorously cries while fighting for
his country; can never evolve into insuperably
marvelous and blazingly fearless patriotism, 

The tree which dementedly cries while imparting
exuberant breeze; can never evolve into magnificently
euphoric and royally blossoming vivacity, 

The clown who preposterously cries while engendering
the audience to laugh; can never evolve into
bedazzlingly enviable and miraculously healing happiness, 

The lightening which uxoriously cries while
uninhibitedly diffusing into an enigmatic river of
brilliant white; can never evolve into compassionately
effulgent and fierily charged electricity, 

The lion who capriciously cries while crunching the
bones of his nimble prey; can never evolve into unfathomably bewitching and inimitably unconquerable kingliness, 

The dwelling which hedonistically cries while
harboring its impeccable occupants; can never evolve
into affably propitious and beautifully synergistic concord, 

The doctor who fecklessly cries while attending to his
beleaguered patients; can never evolve into miraculously Omnipotent and blessedly efficacious healing, 

The hand which frigidly cries while working for quintessential livelihood; can never evolve into eternally pacifying and emolliently deserving perseverance, 

The lips which dismally cry while unstoppably kissing; 
can never evolve into bounteously ingratiating and
timelessly candle-lit sensuousness, 

And the heart which sadistically cries while
perpetually bonding its beats with the person it
rhapsodically triumphant life.

 INFINITE TIMES BETTER

Infinite times better than the diminutively
diminishing flicker of the sleazily artificial bulb; 
was the Omnipotent blaze of the bountifully
unassailable Sun, 

Infinite times better than the truncated fantasies in
the manipulatively estranged mind; was the
unfathomably untainted paradise of poignantly
seductive clouds in the sky, 

Infinite times better than parsimoniously remorseful
water incarcerated beneath the lavatory seat; was the
thunderously untamed roar of the uninhibitedly
vivacious and mischievously dancing ocean, 

Infinite times better than the bawdily threadbare
stone; was the insuperably majestic and timelessly
sheltering swirl of the celestially compassionate mountain, 

Infinite times better than the lecherously parasitic
currency coin; was the river of pricelessly united and
Omnipresently blessing humanity, 

Infinite times better than the gaudily cadaverous crayons disparagingly sprawled on the floor; was the eternally royal rainbow and resplendently eclectic rainbow; twinkling in the firmament of azure sky, 

Infinite times better than the abhorrently shattered
glass; was the candidly perspicacious mirror of the impeccably unassailable and inimitably sacrosanct soul, 

Infinite times better than the preposterously stuffed
toys available in the manipulatively prejudiced market; was the indomitably peerless roar of the princely lion, 

Infinite times better than the emotionless chips of
the raunchily scintillating computer; was the unfathomably brilliant and tirelessly discovering human brain, 

Infinite times better than the disgustingly miserly
twig decaying in a bedraggled heap; was the unsurpassably pristine meadow of boisterously frolicking grass, 

Infinite times better than the uncontrollably shivering bottle of stingily corked wine; was the uninhibitedly royal forest of divinely endowing sensuousness, 

Infinite times better than the body of the forlornly decrepit air-conditioner; was the exuberantly mesmerizing kiss of the rhapsodically untamed storm, 

Infinite times better than the abjectly traded idols of gold and bombastically boorish silver; was the Omnipresent reflection of the perpetual Creator; in every single ingredient of the atmosphere and beyond, 

Infinite times better than the sparing shades of mechanical pencil on barren canvas; was the panoramically enamoring kaleidoscope of miraculously ameliorating nature, 

Infinite times better than the banefully blaring music of the pompous discotheque; was the fathomlessly enchanting carpet of marvelously iridescent and vibrantly twinkling stars, 

Infinite times better than the bizarrely squelched brick in the tyrannically rotting foundation; was the heaven of irrefutably venerated and eternally unshakable truth, '

Infinite times better than the ghoulishly devastating
coffin of death; was the chapter of immortally sacred
and perennially blossoming life, 

But ever since the first breath that the entire Universe took; and even centuries unprecedented afterit vanishes into traces of amorphously beleaguered
oblivion; infinite times better than " Immortal Love" was; is and shall forever be; once again only Love; Love and nothing else but the invincibly blessed fabric of "Immortal Love"

 LIFE'S THE WAY YOU SEE IT

For some it was a garden of bountifully mesmerizing
roses; while some could only indefatigably witness the
acrimoniously pugnacious thorns, 

For some it was a surreally rhapsodic cloud showering
perennial enchantment; while some could only
relentlessly feel penalized by the shades of
gruesomely pulverizing black, 

For some it was a forest of panoramically evergreen
the enigmatically inexplicable travails and trails, 

For some it was an ocean of unsurpassably unassailable
happiness; while some could only unrelentingly blame
the maliciously lambasting maelstrom of pernicious
waves, 

For some it was an unflinching fortress of timelessly
blissful solidarity; while some could only implacably
feel the disparagingly deteriorating abrasions with
the inevitably unstoppable unfurling of time, 

For some it was a tantalizingly celestial nightingale; 
while some could only dogmatically the curse the
inconspicuous pinches of harmlessly holistic
adulteration in the air, 

For some it was a meadow of eternally priceless peace; 
while some could only incorrigibly experience the
frigid chunks of obnoxiously threadbare dirt, 

For some it was a fireball of insuperably untamed
passion; while some could only intractably feel outlandishly intimidated by the wisps of hideously black smoke; that disastrously obfuscated their vision, 

For some it was an ebulliently fathomless book of
unendingly euphoric adventure; while some could only
tirelessly feel asphyxiated by the sheer and
inexplicably unfurling volume, 

For some it was a bountifully persevering ladder to
eternal success; while some could only intransigently
castigate the unfathomable array of steep stairs, 

For some it was an unbelievable rainbow of heavenly
versatility; while some could only ruthlessly feel the
incomprehensibly endless festoon of harsh shades, 

For some it was an Omnipotent Sun of invincibly
righteous hope; while some could only acrimoniously
feel the boundlessly austere rays left; right and spurious center, 
‘
For some it was a iridescently twinkling star of unprecedented optimism; while some could only remorsefully feel the infinitesimally uncanny flicker; inflamingly imperil their sanctimonious existence, 

For some it was an immortally patriotic march towards
glorious martyrdom; while some could only grievingly
feel the blood soaked sacrifices in the triumphant
odyssey in between, 

For some it was an unshakably sacrosanct mother who
survival; while some could only preposterously feel
the savage waves of bedlam labour pain; in between, 

For some it was the most blessed icing on even the
most diminutive little thing that they had achieved; 
while some could only relentlessly shiver to the winds
of rejuvenating coolness, 

O! Yes; For some it was an indomitably victorious
inferno of passionately loving heartbeats; while some
could only limitlessly grouse the reverberating sound; 
ignominiously admonishing it for bringing cacophony in
their dwindling stride, 

Because although the Omniscient Creator had bestowed
it in the most holistically unconquerable of forms
upon every organism symbiotically alike; Life's the
way you chose it to be; Life's the way you make of it; 
Life's the way you believe it to be; Life's the way
you see it.

 BELIEVE IT OR NOT

Whether you pulverize an invisibly infinitesimal worm; 
or whether you torch a vibrantly euphoric commoner; 
brutally alive, 

Whether you squelch a diminutively pertinent mosquito; 
or whether you massacre a patriotic soldiers scalp; 
for sleazily placating the diabolical politician's
palette, 

Whether you pluck an inconspicuous lotus petal; or
whether you barbarously run your obnoxiously
cold-blooded vehicle over the haplessly wailing beggar
boy, 

Whether you squat at a parsimoniously irascible
cockroach; or whether you ruthlessly asphyxiate the
neck of the police officer; simply in order to save
your very own existence, 

Believe it or not; in either case you commit the most
salaciously derogatory of crime; as whatever might
have been their size; shape; color; fraternity or
alike; as they both had exuberant life
.



Whether you dig mercurially chocolate brown mud to
erect your palaces of tawdry filth; or whether you
parasitically suck even the last iota of blood from
the poor man's skin; to raunchily enlighten your
non-existent facial contours, 

Whether you smash fugitively new born eggs with your
criminal sword; or whether you treacherously extricate
the kidneys of a helpless man; just in order to
fortify the body of your already robust pet dog, 

Whether you step over an petulantly infantile ant
while pompously transgressing towards your dogmatic
office; or whether you truculently strip flesh of
staggeringly destitute woman; to invidiously warm your
every winter night, 

Whether you kill the diminishingly small newborn
spider to placate the impudent itch in your bohemian
palms; or whether you viciously stab the withering old
man to death; just in order to devour every single
iota of his hard earned wealth, 

Believe it or not; in either case you commit the most
remorsefully dastardly of crime; as whatever might
have been their size; shape; color; fraternity or
alike; as they both had vivacious life-



Whether you insanely excoriate an obsoletely minuscule
seed to fulminate into sanctimoniously depraving
laughter; or whether you hedonistically snap the fangs
of the eclectic artist forever; so that there remained
nothing but abominable bloodshed on the trajectory of
this fathomless Universe, 

Whether you hack a timid tadpole to the most
ruthlessly ribald death thereby releasing your
libidinous frustration; or whether you slit the veins
of the innocent prisoner; to maliciously corroborate
your idiosyncratic supremacy to the world outside, 

Whether you ominously emaciate the newborn calf to
torturous death just to tease its sacrosanct mother; 
or whether you insidiously crucify every element of
the gentle giant; in order to become the most powerful
organism on this colossal earth, 

Whether you savagely roast the enchantingly
proliferating larvae to tantalize your taste buds for
morning breakfast; or whether you licentiously drill
the skull of the spell binding scientist; with
tumultuously torching embers of horrifically rusted iron, 

Believe it or not; in either case you commit the most
preposterously indescribable of crime; as whatever
might have been their size; shape; color; fraternity
alike; as they both had majestic life-



Whether you aim for the evanescent sparrow's eye just
in order to diffuse criminal blackness wherever you
went; or whether you deleteriously devoured the
unsuspecting denizens neck in a single gulp; to gorily
replenish your belly for the blazing afternoon, 

Whether you poked indefatigably at the harmlessly tiny
crab just to make wholeheartedly decrepit merry with
your sick mates; or whether you tyrannically tonsured
every iota of flesh from the bereaved widow's body; to
hold a sordidly macabre exhibition of shriveled skin, 

Whether you crushed an unbelievably insignificant
beetle under your fetidly marauding feet; or whether
you murdered the irrefutably truthful messiah of
humanity; so that manipulation was the only leech that
burgeoned till times immemorial, 

Whether you chopped a minutely petite snail into a
billion pieces just to profusely reinvigorate the
edges of your stagnating kitchen cleaver; or whether
you lasciviously snatched air from the lungs of
immaculate school children; to baselessly immortalize

Believe it or not; in either case you commit the most
ghoulishly dilapidated of crime; as whatever might
have been their size; shape; color; fraternity or
alike; as they both had fantastic life.

 OMNIPOTENT RAINDROP

It waded of even the most traumatically rapacious of
my tensions; with the astoundingly mellifluous cadence
in its glorious uninhibited cascade, 

It majestically cleared the deleterious morass of
manipulation enshrouding my eyes; with its stupendously sparkling and uninhibitedly rhapsodic globules, 

It victoriously beheaded all my bizarrely staggering
dereliction; with its perennially princely and
unrelenting shower of divine righteousness, 

It profoundly enlightened every cranny of my drearily
lambasted veins; with its fabulously rhythmic and
unbelievably magnetic melody, 

It perpetually replenished my lividly morose lips; with its unfathomable forest of timeless charisma; drenching each contour of my devastatingly limp persona; with cisterns of unconquerable ecstasy, 

It marvellously embellished even the most
infinitesimal follicle of my despairingly beleaguered
eyelashes; with its torrentially ebullient and
enchanting downpour, 

It triumphantly freed me of all my spuriously bellicose tawdriness; blissfully pacifying the innermost realms of my incarcerated soul; with its spell bindingly
united showering, 

It regally silenced the very essence of dastardly fear
in my countenance; with its unflinching spirit of
unassailably euphoric adventure, 

It impregnably taught me the morals of harmoniously
philanthropic existence; with its insatiably gregarious embracing of all tribes; benevolently and alike, 

It wholesomely massacred even the most mercurial trace
of desperation in my blood; with its unsurpassable
festoon of everlastingly seductive scent, 

It emolliently decorated even the most capricious step
that I transgressed; with its convivially vibrant
impressions of intoxicating life, 

It forever ensured that I frolicked through meadows of
fantastically resplendent childhood; triggering in me
an implacable urge to sensuous discover the beauty of
this entire Universe; drowning myself in obeisant
admiration of its untainted belly, 

It made me wholesomely oblivious to all gory death; 
agony and satanically horrific pain; with its fountain
of unbelievably exotic iridescence, 

It handsomely liberated me of my truculently barbarous
fanaticism; with its eternally indomitable rainbows of
truth and celestially burgeoning solidarity, 

It gorgeously transpired the most poignantly intricate artist from within the deepest ingredients of my blood; engendering me to spawn a civilization of synergistically intriguing newness; with its droplets of bountifully exultating compassion, 

It nursed me like what my sacrosanct mother used to
feed me when I was a newborn child; with its fabric of
ardently heavenly and unshakable togetherness, 

It profusely inundated my life with nothing else but
love; love and rivulets of invincibly immortal love; 
with its serendipitously gracious wave of priceless
humanity, 

And to imagine that it did all of the above without
even a minuscule pinch to my pocket; a fugitive
penalization to my advancing stride; O! Yes; such was
the Omnipotent magic of the tantalizingly beautiful
and aristocratically opalescent raindrop.

 AS LONG AS

It was perfectly OK; even if you were profusely
fastidious about your food; wanted to eat the most
flirtatiously rubicund morsels of tantalizing fruit
before commencing every of your delectable meal, 

It was perfectly OK; even if you were overwhelmingly
squeamish about the way you dressed; insatiably
desired to embellish your nimble countenance; with the
finest fraternity of regale silk that was found on the
rustic mountain sheep, 

It was perfectly OK: even if you were unfathomably
obsessive about the things you liked and abominably
disliked; at times even waking a countless night on
the incessant trot; to heavenly placate even the most
infinitesimal of your desire, 

It was perfectly OK: even if you euphorically danced
without the slightest rhyme or reason at the crackle
of voluptuous midnight; even as the world perpetually
snored in immutably forlorn unison, 

O! Yes it was perfectly OK even if you executed the
most wildest of your idiosyncracies; as long as you
burgeoning living kind; as long as you invincibly
stood with every sect of humanity; till the time you
aristocratically emanated your very last breath




It was perfectly OK: even if you assiduously clambered
fathomless nights on the trot; just to mischievously
roll every of your luridly beleaguered senses with the
ultimate epitome of the freezing Himalayas, 

It was perfectly OK; even if you uninhibitedly rolled
through marshes of uncouthly untamed wilderness; ardently scratching your frolicking flesh with every conceivable thorn that lay; disdainfully sprawled in vicinity, 

It was perfectly OK; even if you unrelentingly chased
unruly dogs in fields of hay; jubilantly philandered
with chuckling hen as the Sun set in spell binding
harmony behind the mesmerizing hills, 

It was perfectly OK; even if you sporadically nibbled
at chunks of obnoxiously worthless cheese like a new
born infant; although you had handsomely swept well
past the threshold of eclectic maturity; countless years ago, 

O! Yes; it was perfectly OK even if you exuded into
the most skittish of your tantrums left; right and
wayward center; as long as you perennially bonded with
saluted every religion and color alike; as the
religion of divinely mankind.



It was perfectly OK; even if you obsessively waited
for torrential drops of rain to thunderous rain to
pelt; sadly from the heart of a profanely cloudless sky, 

It was perfectly OK: even if you were the first
organism on this gargantuan planet to irately
soliloquize words grotesquely upside down; paving an
esoteric pathway of your very own; which had never
ever been replicated on this Universe before, 

It was perfectly OK; even if you intransigently wanted
the most ephemeral beauty of this unsurpassably
unending cosmos before your impeccable eyes all the
time; timelessly basking in the glory of nothing else
but sensuously ingratiating graciousness, 

It was perfectly OK; even if you uniquely chose to
transgress through the acridly flaming thorns of
truth; while the ostentatiously conventional society
danced in the aisles of horrifically derogatory
manipulation; outside, 

O! Yes; it was perfectly OK even if you drifted every
aspect of your life towards the most unimaginable of
your whims; as long as you philanthropically mitigated
all vindictively assaulted humanity from graveyards of
depravation; as long as you made eternally everlasting
righteousness the sole mantra of your nimble
existence.



It was perfectly OK; even if you ecstatically rollicked in the lap of your revered mother; every unraveling moment of the brilliantly stupendous day; and each wind of the resplendently star studded night, 

It was perfectly OK: even if you immutably plucked
stoical blades of lackadaisical grass all life; 
intrepidly staring at phlegmatic puffs of robustly
emerald sky to victoriously rejoice, 

It was perfectly OK; even if you erred more number of
times than you took quintessentially ravishing breath; 
stuttering like a nonchalant skeleton on every
exuberant step that you lamely tread, 

It was perfectly OK; even if you profoundly dedicated
infinite births of yours solely to the essence of
majestic artistry; although there was not an
inconspicuous penny in there; and as your robotically
mundane mates minted mines of imperially glittering
gold; outside, 

O! Yes; it was perfectly OK even if you gyrated your
uninhibited countenance solely to the tunes of your
heart; mind; conscience and no one else; as long as
you patriotically dazzle into the rainbows of a
vibrantly optimistic tomorrow; as long as you liberate
every beat of your heart to love the atmosphere of
oneness; to love the atmosphere of Omnipresent human
kind.

 DON'T YOU DARE O! DEVIL

It was a bundle of overwhelmingly sparkling joy; 
please don't mercilessly maraud its flesh; with your
obnoxiously uncouth nails, 

It was a sacrosanct leaf of freshly blossoming life; 
please don't invidiously inundate its immaculate
brain; with your horrendously truculent tales of
bizarre manipulation, 

It was a fairy having just descended from the heart of
celestial sky; please don't gruesomely maim it with
your indiscriminately cold-blooded stride, 

It was the ultimate fulfilling fantasy of any two
perpetual lovers; please don't heinously strangulate
the last iota of breath from its innocuously godly
body; with your infernos of undescribably sordid malice, 

chapter of timeless procreation; please don't ghastily
blind it forever; even before it could open its
mesmerizing eyes, 

It was an Omnipotent lantern illuminating countless
dwellings besieged with disparaging despair; please
don't ruthless snap its hands; with your fangs of
vindictive hatred, 

It was an unassailable harbinger of humanity; please don't venomously poison its holistically vibrant soul; with your lecherously stinking world of politics and crime, 

It was an astoundingly eclectic and unconquerable
prince; please don't lay a battlefield of your
pugnaciously acrid thorns in whatever path that it
crawled and blissfully tread, 

It was a fountain of inexorably unending happiness; 
please don't satanically thrash its ears; with your
whips of derogatorily unforgivable savagery, 

It was an everlastingly smiling doll which embraced
all mankind; please don't sinfully replace its
bountifully adorable laughter; with your ghoulish
teardrops of torturously penalizing hell, 

It was the most divine fantasy of every organism
alive; please don't hideously cripple its unblemished
originality; with your disparaging greed and
ostracizing prejudice, 

It was an unparalleled jewel of the poignant eye; 
please don't salaciously rip apart its skin; with your
profusely blood stained and barbaric butcher knife, 

It was a blessing from the cosmos to all fraternity of
mankind breathing and alive; please don't trade its
innocently benign flesh; for your sinister wads of
debasing money, 

It was the most impregnable Sun of tomorrow; a spell
bindingly guiding light; please don't horrifically
confound its boundless resplendence; with your
cloudcovers of treacherously gory night, 

It was an unfathomable cistern of perennial
enchantment; please don't bawdily kick it with your
bohemian toes; always sunk way beneath the graveyards
of insane lifelessness, 

It was the greatest star ever shining on marvelous
earth divine; please don't brutally plagiarize it with
corpses of illiteracy and pernicious sodomy; instead
of gifting it with effulgent toys, 

It was a horizon which had absolutely no end; please
don't vengefully asphyxiate its chords of celestial
existence; with the disdainful abhorrence for all
surviving; ostensibly burgeoning in your eyes, 

It was an immortal heartbeat pulsating with
unstoppable life; please don't tyrannically deprive it
of all the fathomless tributaries of love; that it was
destined to assimilate every unfurling minute of its
beautiful life, 

please don't in anyway harm the new born child; even
if your desire to kill transcends everything else on
this planet; you can readily take my life; but please
don't harm the child; don't you dare harm the freshest
outcry of newborn life

 THERE WAS NO PRICE ON EARTH

There was no price on earth which could ever
substitute; the untamed exhilaration which every pore
of my body experienced; while briskly philandering
through the thunderous cloudbursts of exuberant breeze, 

There was no price on earth which could ever
substitute; the profound wave of enlightenment that I
felt on my skin; every day at the very first light of
miraculously rejuvenating dawn, 

There was no price on earth which could ever
substitute; the irrefutable truth in the voice of the
little child; incoherently gazing towards my drearily
sagging demeanor, 

There was no price on earth which could ever
substitute; the astronomically resplendent enigma that
I felt enveloped with; when I intrepidly trespassed
through the wilderness of the forests and the
gloriously spell binding waterfalls, 

There was no price on earth which could ever
substitute; the unrelenting festoon of fantasies that
I dreamt all day and exotic night; the cloud of
majestically sensuous titillation that bountifully
enshrouded every ingredient of my blood, 

There was no price on earth which could ever
substitute; the uninhibitedly compassionate fabric of
humanity that profusely caressed me from all sides; 
the spirit of symbiotically superb camaraderie that I
felt in every aspect of my vibrant life, 

There was no price on this earth that could ever
substitute; those moments when I realized I was going
to become a father; the triumphantly unending smiles
on the faces of me and my wife; alike, 

There was no price on earth that could ever
substitute; the poignantly pristine freshness of the
ravishing oceans; which voraciously tickled me every
night under the gregariously milky moon, 

There was no price on earth that could ever
substitute; the fathomless sensitivity in the eyes of
my beloved; the Omnipotent replenishment that I had
felt on my lips; as she kissed me till the end of veritable time, 

There was no price on earth that could ever
substitute; the unprecedented urge in my body to once
again become an innocuously wandering child; regally
frolic with the feathers of the vivid peacock; until
the Sun bid the earth a final goodbye, 

There was no price on earth that could ever
substitute; the unsurpassable excitement that I had
indefatigably experienced; as the nubile seductress
deluged the colors of her embellished artistry; in the
famished whites of my lugubrious eye, 

There was no price on earth that could ever
substitute; the unconquerable faith that I had in the
paradise of righteousness; even as diabolically
marauding hell wholesomely blended with inconspicuous
granules of soil, 

There was no price on earth that could ever
substitute; the invincible exultation engulfing my
face; when I earned the first trace of quintessential
livelihood with my very own hands, 

There was no price on earth that could ever
substitute; the limitless euphoria that each element
of my visage experienced; as I nose-dived without a
parachute from the absolute summit of the beautifully
snow clad hills, 

There was no price on earth that could ever
substitute; the insurmountable care showered upon me
by my godly mother right since the first cry of my
birth; and even as she underwent the most horrifically
gory whippings from the conventionally
inclement society, 

There was no price on earth that could ever
substitute; the smile of perennial freshness on the
face of my newly born daughter; her insatiably innocent actions to nibble everything that came her way, 

There was no price on earth that could ever
substitute; the blissfully seductive scent of the
mesmerizing rose that drifted into my torturously
starved nostrils; the stupendous vivaciousness of the
atmosphere; royally perpetuating me from all ends, 

There was no price on earth that could ever
substitute; those two words of encouragement from the
haplessly withering dame; impregnating loads of
Herculean courage in my dwindling persona; even as she
was just about to leave the planet forever and die, 

There was no price on earth that could ever
substitute; the unbelievably supreme melody of the
ingratiatingly voluptuous nightingale; the Omniscient
sweetness that it instilled in my collapsing form; 
every time she unfurled her beak to sing and cry, 

And there was no price on earth that could ever
substitute; those instants when I fell in love at
first sight; those unassailable passions in my body
when we first united; those immortal bonds of love
that we had formed for infinite more births yet to
unveil; which were still my whole and sole mantra to
lead life.

more slippery than the surreptitiously perilous eel; 
triggering you to plummet headon on a snake of
slithering nonchalance, 

And at times an immortal bonding of existence
bountifully coalescing you with all those whom you
pricelessly loved; while at times more sardonically
bitter than venom could ever have tasted; such was the
vacillating chapter of vibrant life.

 THE SOLE REFLECTION OF MY SOUL

How could I ever get bored even an infinitesimally
insipid iota? 
When I had the perpetually golden rays of the
blistering midday Sun; filter a path of
scintillatingly righteous courage; through every
cranny of my disastrously impoverished demeanor.

How could I ever get bored even an inconspicuously
non-existent trifle? 
When I had the gregariously cascading waterfalls of
enlightening froth tickle me profusely from all sides; 
trigger in me an insatiably euphoric yearning; to
gallop ecstatically forward; through the fields of
mesmerizing life.

How could I ever get bored even a comically minuscule
whisker? 
When I had the voluptuously rustling breeze profoundly
caress each of manipulatively besieged senses; 
uninhibitedly freeing me to dance timelessly; till the
boundaries of enchanting eternity.

How could I ever get bored even a diminutively frigid
fraction? 
When I had the melodiously ebullient nightingale
singing right on my shoulder; profusely infiltrating
resplendent rays of hope; into my vindictively cold
blooded existence.

How could I ever get bored even a capriciously tiny
speck? 
When I had the divinely blooming flowers spinning a
web of majestically astounding artistry all across my
gruesomely bereaved senses; tirelessly drifting me
towards an unfathomable ocean of blissful scent.

How could I ever get bored even a parsimoniously
mercurial bit? 
When I had the unfathomable caravan of boisterously
buzzing bees incessantly enshrouding my lifelessly
stoical facial contours; inundate my mockingly dreary
survival with unprecedented enthrallment and tingling
sweetness.

How could I ever get bored even a lackadaisically
lackluster inch? 
When I had the fascinatingly ingratiating Moon shimmer
gorgeously on my despondently disheveled flesh; 
seductively caress me with unsurpassable fireballs of
magnificently silken delight.

How could I ever get bored even a languidly
inarticulate centimeter? 
When I had tantalizingly green meadows nestled with
exotic dew drops to rampantly roll in; expunge each
horrendously frustrated ingredient from my despairing
blood; to handsomely blend with the stupendously
reinvigorating soil.

How could I ever get bored even a ghoulishly
asphyxiated bit? 
When I had intransigently aristocratic carpets of
breath embracing my savagely extinguishing nostrils; 
irrefutably propelling me each instant to
unflinchingly disseminate the patriotic river of
truth; in every corner of this gigantic earth.

And how could I ever get bored even a trivially
transient second? 
When I had your immortally unassailable love
perennially romancing with my nervously fluttering
heartbeats; when I had your marvelously humanitarian
shadow; which had unconquerably become the sole
reflection of my soul.

 A CARPET OF LIFE

I wore a brilliantly orange cloak of vibrant oranges; 
when I felt I was ardently surging forward; towards
the fireballs of untamed exuberance, 

I wore a sedately tranquil apron of celestial
dewdrops; when I felt a wave of overwhelming
contentment wholesomely enshrouding; every iota of my
profusely fatigued countenance, 

I wore a seductive cistern of rustling tree leaves; 
when I felt the bountifully enchanting winds of the
astoundingly tantalizing night; tickle me like a new
born child, 

I wore a mystically fragrant garland of robust roses; 
when I felt every step of my impoverished existence; 
unfurling into an unfathomably priceless ocean of
virile dreams, 

I wore a thunderously poignant tiger skin; when I felt
the insatiable inferno of surreptitious carnal desire; 
transcend its ebullient spell over each of my; 
devastatingly beleaguered senses, 

I wore a titillating cloud of enamoring velvet; when I
felt the skies of profoundly enigmatic mysticism; 
unrelentingly bequeathing upon me; the spell binding
rain drops of perennial yearning, 

I wore a statue of profusely intrepid earth; when I
felt the unflinchingly impregnable mountain of blazing
patriotism; scintillating unleash from every pore of
my nimble visage, 

I wore a piquant shawl of tumultuously fiery chili; 
when I felt irascibly provoked by the uncouthly savage
and acrimoniously conventional society; when the
spirit of retribution was all that diffused from my
diminutive soul, 

I wore a gorgeous sheet of emphatically whistling
bells; when I felt jubilantly philandering through the
aisles of fascinating romance; euphorically
hoodwinking the majestic Sun; before it kissed the
horizons goodbye, 

I wore a sparkling scarf of innocuously radiating
pearls; when I felt as if the entire grandiloquence on
this Universe; had divinely blended with each droplet
of my effusively scarlet blood, 

I wore a dilapidated curtain of threadbare cotton; 
when I felt invidiously stabbed for centuries
immemorial; by dolorously depressing coffins of; 
bizarre loneliness, 

I wore a incredulously slim handkerchief of moisture; 
when I felt the blistering heat of the treacherously
sweltering Sun; disdainfully scorch my demeanor to; 
gruesomely livid ash, 

I wore a compassionately warm mattress of sheepskin; 
when I felt particles of forlorn remorsefulness
infiltrate deep down into my soul; when the avalanches
of freezing winter unsparingly endeavored their best; 
to asphyxiate the last breath out of my lungs, 

I wore boundless helmets of formidable solidarity; 
when the sky surrounding me rained down globules of
penalizing hell; ruthlessly lambasting my body with
whirlwinds of maliciously disparaging discontent, 

I wore colossal jackets of ravishing watermelon skin; 
when I felt my mind was going insanely berserk; when I
felt that I needed to melodiously placate that extra
iota of my; vindictive steam, 

I wore a robotic map of pragmatic commercialism; when
I felt that I was drifting a trifle too much; towards
the world of surreally meaningless and lackadaisical
nothingness, 

I wore an irrefutably unassailable fortress of truth; 
when I felt that I was blissfully transiting into
impeccable childhood; seeking the most mesmerizing of
solace in life; in the feet of my divinely mother, 

I wore a stupendously grandiloquent entrenchment of
breath; when I felt that I was deliberating dwindling
towards my morbidly insidious corpse; when I felt as
if I had abnegated all charm to exist, 

And I wore an immortal carpet of unconquerable life; 
when I felt I was falling in sacred love; perpetually
entwining every element of my persona with my heavenly
beloved; forever and ever and ever.

roaringly shine,

the boundaries of enamoring paradise; I was in
profound admiration of its drastically fading
complexion as it bid the earth an ephemeral goodbye,

left me searching for breath; I was in profound
admiration of its gorgeously new born pink; as
resplendence stars transcended the sky, 

As much as its sacrosanct aura enthralled me into

admiration of its charmingly flickering rays; 
eventually dissolving into short lived darkness, 

As much as its trail of flamboyant fire incredulously
made me its humble slave; I was in profound admiration
of its blissfully melodious harmony as the hours
gradually cascaded by, 

As much as its profusely majestic shimmer engendered
me to convolute into clouds of unparalleled ecstasy; I
was in profound admiration of its sedately contented
visage; as it settled to relish the breeze of the
star- studded midnight, 

As much as its irrefutably princely demeanor made me
gasp in stunned and utter disbelief; I was in profound
admiration of its handsomely extinguishing light; as
it immortally resolved to rise once again, 

As much as its unequivocal grandiloquence granted me
the tenacity to lead a countless more lives; I was in
profound admiration of its amber mellow; as it shrunk
serenely behind the poignant hills, 

As much as its ingratiatingly captivating beams
seduced me into a web of overwhelming mysticism; I was
in profound admiration of its rhapsodic enthrallment; 
as it coalesced wholesomely with the undulating sea, 

As much as its tumultuously compassionate aura
pacified all my traumatically agonized apprehensions
in life; I was in profound admiration of its divinely
silent withdrawal from the cosmos; as the onset of
every dusk, 

As much as its insurmountably flaming aura ignited
fireballs of untamed passion in my every dreary night; 
I was in profound admiration of its nascently slim
horizons; as it took the plunge into oblivion for some hours, 

As much as its remarkably stringent rays fumigated
each iota of my despondently dreary countenance; I was
in profound admiration of its marvelous obeisance; 
dissipating into a festoon of gorgeous empathy; as it
gave way to the Moon, 

And as much as its brilliantly fresh rays made me
salute it till countless births of mine; as immortal
SUNRISE; I was in profound admiration of it melanging
gloriously with the tepid horizons; settling deep
within my heart and soul as fantastic SUNSET

 STOP KILLING ANIMALS

They were wholesomely innocent; not entangled in any
discrepancy of spurious religion whatsoever, 

They didn't need any wealth to live; harmlessly
replenishing their innocuous stomachs; with Nature's
bountiful endowment, 

They hadn't a single cloth on their heavenly bodies; 
yet handsomely managed their survival; without
infiltrating the slightest into your conventional society, 

They safeguarded your possessions like an invincible
fortress; while you slept in the untamed luxury of
opulent wine and seductive vixen, 

They were bereft of a name; yet attended to the most
infinitesimal of your command; by whatever prefix; 
that you chose to call them, 

They gave the most exhilarating rides to your children
on their bare backs; at times wincing tumultuously
under the pain; while your kin had the time of their lives, 

They galloped like a profusely embellished prince
through the spiraling hills; timidly retreating back
as the Sun transcended beyond the ethereal horizons, 

They harbored a festoon of poignant empathy in their
eyes; feeling devastatingly distraught as man killed
man; for power, 

They frolicked playfully under the enchanting moon; 
cuddling their young ones securely to their womb, 

They had an astounding prowess of smell; at times
wholesomely depending upon it to find their way; as
their sight blinded in the most tenaciously brilliant
of sunshine, 

They splashed every dawn under rejuvenating waterfalls
of the mountains; yielding you frosty milk for your
appetizing breakfast, 

They imitated you at sporadic occasions; triggering
you to have the most wholehearted laugh of your lives, 

They wagged their tails in ecstatic jubilation witnessing the revered grace of their master; irrespective of the fact that he belted out his frustration of the day; ruthlessly on their nimble hindsides, 

They were complete oblivious to vicious circles of
hatred; lies; lecherous ambition; confronted each
moment of life as it came; with ardent simplicity in
their bodies, 

They soared like a king amidst the celestial clouds; 
rendering you their salubrious eggs; even before they
had hatched, 

They had not the slightest of moral education; yet
sacrificed their lives for their soldiers; in the
acrimonious battlefield of war, 

And they had a heart more passionately throbbing than
their human counterparts; weeping and profoundly
lamenting the loss of their loved ones, 

They were barbarically called; Chickens, Pigs, Dogs, 
Cats, Cows, Birds, Monsters, Wolves, Rabbits; Mice; 
Ants and Frogs, 

With people cutting; roasting; slaughtering; 
strangulating; consuming; them for their daily meals; 
as they still showered their blessings to all living
kind, 

Therefore it is my plea to all you humans out there; 
don't give them any status in your monotonous society; 
but at least can you STOP KILLING ANIMALS.

midnight,

countenance as you are enthralled by the creation of

 TURN VEGETARIAN- PART what I had consumed in my stomach; during the tenure
of the marathon month, 

Even if a droplet of it blended with the dusty road; I
wildly swerved my sedan; crashing face on against the
lanky tree; with my heart palpitating faster than
white lightening, 

Even if a droplet of it got smeared inadvertently with
my pillow; I relentlessly tossed and turned all night; 
fostering agonizing memories about the plight of my
fellow compatriots in suffering, 

Even if a droplet of it dribbled down from my mirror; 
I started to witness the entire world as disastrously
shattered; and all perceptions of mesmerizing beauty
just disappeared from my mind, 

Even if a droplet of it came tumbling from the
astronomically fathomless sky; I swooned in sheer
disbelief towards the ground; terrified that the
Creator might have now decided to end this magnificent earth, 

Even if a droplet of it plummeted into the gigantic
glass of water; I started to have insane
hallucinations about the sacrosanct spirit of life; to
be in grave danger, 

Even if a droplet of it oozed from my beloved's face; 
I had a horrendously ringing sensation in my bones; 
and I found tears of profound empathy slither down my eyes, 

Even if a droplet of it loitered on the periphery of
my shoe; my feet started to tremble inexplicably; and
the saliva in my throat froze brusquely midway; as I
felt helpless for mankind in hysterical grief, 

Even if a droplet of it lingered close to my breath; I
felt that the gates of doomsday had suddenly unveiled
themselves full throttle upon the Universe, 

Even if a droplet of it stuck to the luminous dial of
my watch; I commenced to conceive that time had
bizarrely condensed in its roots; and a treacherously
sinister glow hideously enveloped the whole planet, 

Even if a droplet of it appeared on the television
screen; I felt myself perpetuated with an insatiable
nostalgia for my countrymen; sacrificing their lives
in true patriotism; to ensure that I existed in perpetual peace, 

Even if a droplet of it coalesced with the
majestically shimmering stream; I felt as if the
entire assemblage of water was shivering in
unprecedented pain, 

Even if a droplet of it fell on the immaculately plain
sheet of writing paper; I felt that it was impossibly
irrevocable to remove the stains with even the most
incredulously powerful eraser in this world, 

Even if a droplet of it sprinkled itself on tree
leaves; I ruminated that wild life was pathetically
deteriorating; and infinite parasites crawled on the
prowl to pacify their lecherous gluttony, 

Even if a droplet of it adhered to my eyeball; the
world outside seemed gruesomely obfuscated; and every
path on which I transgressed seemed to be leading to
the corridors of satanic hell, 

Even if a droplet of it spurted out from the
impregnably formidable walls; I felt uncannily closer
to ghastly death and decay; and the pulse of my
exuberant existence remarkably slackened its pace, 

Even if a droplet of it sprang up on my palms; I
pondered upon the dire consequences that would
savagely constrict the tenacity of my destiny; the
gloomy perils that await me as I alighted my next step, 

Even if a droplet of it leaked from my luscious lips; 
I relinquished all sagaciously perceivable activity; 
poignantly disturbed at the most vital fluid bestowed

And it was simply beyond my most incomprehensible
limit of imagination; that if such a minuscule droplet
of blood fomented my sensitivity to abdicate almost
all traces of life, 

Then how could people round the globe; eat; drink; and
relish it; stupendously basking in its glory over a
glass of oligarchic port wine; ruthlessly slaughtering
impeccable animals for mere satisfaction of their
nocturnal supper? 

Therefore it is my humble plea to all of you on behalf
of the Omnipotent Creator; to try your best and TURN
VEGETARIAN.

 INFINITE INFINITY

An island which you incessantly dream of; but
miserably failed to reach, 

A height which is so unsurpassable; that each step you
clamber; still found you on obdurate chunks of rock
bottom ground, 

A size so astronomically colossal; that is beyond the
definitions of any size or veritable proportion, 

A tunnel so perpetually unending; that perennial
blackness engulfed you even if you took birth
relentlessly; for countless centuries, 

A land where no palpable organism can dare to
transgress upon; a land where only the Almighty
Creator resided since centuries immemorial; and would
continue to rule till the time he wanted; was the land
of INFINITE INFINITY.

A wave so mammoth; that rose and handsomely swirled
even unimaginable kilometers above the vivacious
clouds, 

A ray so unprecedented; that indefatigably pierced
even the most obsolete corner of this Universe with
its overwhelmingly stringent light, 

A shadow so profoundly mystical; that refrained to
subside even after the ghastly blanket of profuse
darkness; had wholesomely set in, 

A voice so incredulously echoing; that it kept eluding
you unrelentingly as it collided like a fulminating
tornado against the cold rocks, 

A land where no palpable organism can dare to
transgress upon; a land where only the Almighty
Creator resided since centuries immemorial; and would
continue to rule till the time he wanted; was the land
of INFINITE INFINITY.

A book so incomprehensibly long; that you remained on
the front page; even after browsing for decades
unfathomable, 

A painting so enigmatically fascinating; that each
time you saw it; it metamorphosed into a myriad of
fathomless shades, 

A tree so astoundingly gigantic; that kept blossoming
and proliferating into innumerable branches; as each
second unfurled, 

A storm so cyclonic; which continued even after the
entire planet had slept; caressing every object on
this globe with passionate cloudbursts of breeze, 

A land where no palpable organism can dare to
transgress upon; a land where only the Almighty
Creator resided since centuries immemorial; and would
continue to rule till the time he wanted; was the land
of INFINITE INFINITY.

A mountain with its summit augmenting till times
beyond eternity; stretching over the most bizarre
point of imagination, 

A fantasy tumultuously surpassing the realms of
unbelievable perception; incorrigibly refraining to
quell even after inevitable death, 

A cloud whispering an unending tale of existence; with
majestic streaks of white lightening royally
encompassing every tangible and intangible entity in
the inferno of its untamed ferocity, 

A mission impossible for anyone to comprehend even an
inconspicuous fraction of; a challenge which even the
mightiest of mighty pathetically floundered to
accomplish, 

A song which tirelessly continues to inexplicably
haunt every living being; right since the first day of
nascent life, 

A land where no palpable organism can dare to
transgress upon; a land where only the Almighty
Creator resided since centuries immemorial; and would
continue to rule till the time he wanted; was the land
of INFINITE INFINITY.

Overwhelmed by sedation; in the realms of fathomlessly
enchanting fantasy, 

Floating on a blanket of clouds; with a festoon of

Tell me where is death; Tell me where is pain; More

made this blissful planet of yours; a parasite from a
paradise.

Galloping through the fields of blossoming corn;

splashing euphorically in an unfathomable ocean of
tangy water,

cherries; lying in mute silence on the shimmering

importantly Tell me O! Almighty lord; why have people
made this blissful planet of yours; a parasite from a
paradise.

Placing the arms in the lap of insurmountably

in sheer ecstasy up the corrugated tree,

tantalizingly wet rain mud; gasping in dumbfounded
astonishment as the mirage loomed larger in the golden
desert soil, 

Listening with rapt attention to the incredulously
animated chirping of the amicable parrot; gallivanting
beside the fire as its royal flames crackled in the
midst of marvelous midnight, 

Savoring exuberantly cool coconut with rubicund pair
of lips; transiting into a rejuvenating reverie; 
boundless decades before this Universe was first
created,

evaporating every trace of evil from the gloomy
trajectory of ground, 

Some called it an amber bowl of boiling honey; causing
even the most impregnable of entity staring into it to
inevitably wink, 

Some called it a cascading waterfall of blistering
energy; taking the demon by tumultuous force in its
impetuous wrath, 

Some called it an inland of unprecedented courage; 
impregnating even the weakest body standing beneath
it; with daunting strength and fortitude, 

Some called it the King of all eggs always shining; 
fomenting boundless number of mammalian eggs to hatch
into innocuous fledglings; providing them with the
most conducive quantity of heat, 

Some called it a dazzling fountain of bubbling acid; 
which left no scope at all for misery; till the time
it grandiloquently glowed all day, 

Some called it the most unadulterated body ever
created; with every soul on this globe; unanimously
revering it for the irrefutable sanctity it possessed, 

Some called it a flamboyantly shimmering spoon; which
looked after each and every object breathing; saw to
it that everyone was sumptuously fed, 

Some called it a scintillating sword; having the
prowess to wholesomely annihilate the one it wanted
with its marvelously gleaming edge, 

Some called it the ultimate savior in times of
unwarranted distress; igniting rays of hope with its
omnipresent light, 

Some called it an immeasurable diamond; with its
unsurpassable depth; defeating the worst of chilly night, 

Different people living in different tribes christened
it by countless names and opinions; absolutely
astounded by the strength of its unconquerable beams, 

But I will always call and worship it as my undefeated

 LEAD LIFE LIKE A MAN

Drink like a rabbit, gently lapping at water cascading
from white water springs of the mountain, 

Sleep like a demon, snoring thunderously without even
moving a whisker to the most lethal of dynamite
explosion, 

Perspire like a bull, slogging it hard under the
steaming rays of the sun, 

Dance like a peacock, spreading your feathers to a
full plumage under exotic outbursts of rain, 

Smile like a wild chimpanzee, snaring your snow white
teeth without being the slightest overwhelmed by your
surroundings, 

Run like kangaroo, traversing the dense foliage of the
jungle, taking strides at a time, 

Scratch like a red ant, resurrecting your destroyed
cocoon every next second, 

Sing like the Nightingale, inundating every barren
spot in vicinity with the ecstatic melody in your
sound, 

Cry like a crocodile, shedding tears as gargantuan as
the cloud on every area you tread, 

Sting like a scorpion, piercing supple and innocuous
skin with the venomous poison in your fangs, 
Talk like a parrot, chattering incessantly as misty
wisps of air and the aroma of delectable food struck
you in entirety, 

Roar like a lion, waking up every entity sleeping
blissfully, with a single growl of yours, 

Smell like the roots, emanating a voluptuously raw
odor, just after the first spells of rain, 

Stand like an elephant, weathering each storm trying
to blow you with enviable ease, 

Dream like an angel, exploring the most wildest
regions around the globe with rampant frenzy, 

Shiver like a goose, with infinite strands of hair
standing up in animation, on the snow, 

Slaver like a dog, greedily protruding out your tongue
panting passionately for water, 

Bathe like the dolphins, diving acrobatically into the
sapphire sea's, with your body engulfed completely by
the majestic waves, 

Chew like a cow, slowly munching your meals with
rejuvenated gusto, 

Scamper around like a squirrel, leaping friskily on
the myriad of dangling branch, 

Fly high like the eagles, flapping your wings
exuberantly with the cotton cocoon of clouds gliding
past your hair, 

Kick like a donkey, swinging your legs viciously
towards those who tried to disturb your concentration, 

Lick like a cat, sucking every droplet of milk from
the steep edged bowl, 

Yawn like the hippopotamus, candidly announcing your
desire to sleep to even mortals buried in their
corpses, 

Scream like the dinosaur, with a single echo of yours
silencing all commotion in this world, 

Stare like the mammoth whale, making your opponent
blink a thousand times, 

Hear like a fox, detecting the most inconspicuous of
sound, coming to know of your adversary, before it
actually commenced to attack, 

Laze around like the tortoise, not bothering to poke
out your head even in the most scorching of sunlight, 

Shine like the stars, punctuating the eerie darkness
of the night with your spellbinding glimmer, 

Burn like fulminating lava, igniting the most
lackluster of individual with the ardor in your
flames, 

Dig like the mice, making your burrow in loose mud at
lightening speeds, 

Hide like the reptile, evading all traces of light
existing in the Universe, 

Peck like the woodpecker, chiseling your way through
the most obdurate of wooden log, 

Crawl like the spider, mystically weaving your way
across the strands of the flimsy web, 

Swish like a zebra, moving your tail to wade away the
most minuscule of fly buzzing intermittently around
your nose, 

Eat like a pig, greedily gobbling even the tiniest of
toffee wrapper loitering on the road, 

Change color like a chameleon, adapting yourself
furtively to virtually any surrounding you go into, 

Hunt like the vultures, hideously diving down and
capsizing your prey, 

Be wise like the owl, prudently opening your eyes in
the dark as well as stringent light, 

Care like the lioness, protecting your child from the
faintest signs of evil lurking around, 

Enjoy like the otters, having a party of beans and raw
wine well past after midnight, 

Explore like the panther, mercilessly paving your way
through the remotest corner of the forest, 

forever from your adulterated brain, 

And lead life like a man, wandering and discovering; 
struggling and romancing, dreaming and working to
transform all your dreams; as well as those of several
around you into an immortal reality.

 THE CHAPTER OF EXISTENCE

Just when I felt my eyes were closing; my lids incorrigibly wanting to
shut down, 
I saw the tiny buds of rose blossoming outside; the unsurpassable
grandeur of its petals engulfing the atmosphere in entirety.

Just when I felt my legs were going limp in exhaustion; the
indefatigable stress of the day inevitably pinning me down, 
I saw the pouch bellied kangaroo leap across with gigantic strides; 
traverse the marshy fields overlooking my window with uninhibited and gay
abandon.

Just when I felt my tongue relinquishing taste; infinite buds on its
surface had died a gruesome death, 
I saw the cow philandering in the leafy meadows; munching robust chunks
of grass with great relish.

Just when I felt my mouth aching; the chords in my throat abysmally
parched and dry, 
I saw the orchestra singing loquaciously; madmen screeching at the top
of their lungs; attempting to bring the roof on earth.

Just when I felt my hands go pale; every iota of strength sapped
wholesomely from the conglomerate of my bones, 
I saw uncouth barbarians bludgeoning their way through the forest; 
annihilating gargantuan tree stalks; exerting monstrous power with
their palms.

Just when I felt the skin encompassing my neck sagging profoundly; 
disdainful wrinkles inhabiting virtually every part of my demeanor, 
I saw a cluster of young maidens with sparkling skin; boisterously
bouncing on the silken couch.

Just when I felt the waves of sadness vacillate in my soul; bizarre
grief stabbing me like daggers of blistering coal, 
I saw the clowns of in the circus mischievously smile; with their loud
guffaws thunderously piercing the atmosphere.

Just when I felt pulsating pain in my forehead; an avalanche of thorns
curtailing it from perceiving further, 
I saw a medieval sage reciting hymns in blissful harmony; the
unperturbed expressions of his face; depicting that he was in a land of surreal
fantasy.

Just when I felt that I was about to sleep; the clockwork machinery in
my brain failing to tick forward, 
I saw a battalion of roosters flying high in the air; permeating the
crispness in the ambience around with their cacophonic sounds.

And just when I felt I was about to die; relinquish the final draught
of breath; to rest in my heavenly abode, 
I saw a child being born; crying innocuously in the tender palms of its
mother; trying to imbibe as much as it could with its large eyes
dancing around the earth; to better understand the place it was now going to
exist; diligently continuing the CHAPTER OF EXISTENCE.

 BEAUTY NEEDS TO BE APPRECIATED

The sun in the cosmos itself doesn't know the omnipotence in its shine; 
the blazing yellow circumventing its persona, 
Its only when we profoundly admire its tenacity; the blistering heat it
imparts to fumigate pallid earth; does it comes to realize that it is
indeed beautiful.

The crimson colored rose itself doesn't know the mesmerizing odor it
emanates; the voluptuous complexion profusely embedded in its core, 
Its only when we cherish its enchanting fragrance; the stupendous sight
it portrays when sighted at evanescent dawn; does it come to realize that
it is indeed beautiful.

The star twinkling amidst naked patches of sky itself doesn't know its
shine; the radiance that envelops its incongruous silhouette, 
Its only when we applaud it for its resplendence; the illumination it
provides in the chilly night; does it come to realize that it is indeed
beautiful.

The boundless ocean itself doesn't know about its infinite size; the
unfathomable depth it incorporates in its belly, 
Its only when we exuberantly praise its swirling waves; ravishing froth
striking the shores; scores of glistening white sharks swimming; does
it come to realize that it is indeed beautiful.

The opalescent butterfly itself doesn't know about its multicolored
wings; the swishing tentacles extruding from beneath its eyes, 
Its only when we acclaim it for its nimble footed flight in the air; 
the delectable draughts of wind it engenders while flying; does it come to
realize that it is indeed beautiful.

The vivacious reptile itself doesn't know about its hiss; the
mystically slithering body it possesses, 
Its only when we laud it for its tantalizingly shimmering skin; the
remarkably transparent eyes; does it come to realize that it is indeed beautiful.

The obdurate shell of coconut itself doesn't know about its stone
shell; the incredulous heights it projects from on the tall tree, 
Its only when we value it for its appetizing juice; the immaculate and
sumptuous pulp incarcerated in its walls; does it come to realize that
it is indeed beautiful.

The slime coated oyster itself doesn't know about its wealth; the loose
ferns agglutinated to its visage, 
Its only when we treasure it for its scintillating pearls; the
rejuvenating salty water which ejects when we slice its body; does it come to
realize that it is indeed beautiful.

The newly born infant itself doesn't know about its innocuous heart; 
the tiny legs that caress its mother, 
Its only when we clap at it for mustering courage to walk; the
frivolous smiles it does when tickled; does it come to realize that it is indeed
beautiful.

Beauty is a virtue embodied in all of us transgressing through the
surface of this earth; it is a blessing we are all born with, 
All though we remain indiscreetly oblivious to it; as we don't admire
it, 
Beauty is too precious to be neglected; too sacrosanct to be
ignominiously condemned; 'BEAUTY NEEDS TO BE APPRECIATED'.

 WATER IS PRECIOUS

If there was water on the surface of dry leaves; they would look
superbly mesmerizing; glistening profoundly under the sun, 

If there was water on mud coated wall; there would be a ravishing
scent that permeated the adulterated air, 

If there was water on vegetables lying sprawled in a forlorn heap; they
would bounce back to boisterous life; retrieving the plethora of minerals
they had lost in the blistering heat, 

If there was water on fossils languidly scattered in obsolete
territories of the dormant volcano; they would perspicuously depict the mysteries of
the past; besides shimmering magnificently under the moon, 

If there was water on wild buds of jungle mushroom; the unruly shoots
would sparkle tenaciously; drawing millions of mouths towards them to satiate
their famished taste buds, 

If there was water on a battalion of acrimonious thorns; their tips
would get dramatically softened; making them flounder in their conquest of
mercilessly puncturing soft skin, 

If there was water on scalp hair; their bedraggled texture would
miraculously transform into immaculately polished, 

If there was water on the obdurate foam of bed; there would be an
unprecedented cool that besieging the ambience; and I would find it
astoundingly easy to fall into a invincible siesta, 

If there was water on pairs of chapped lips; they would look
irrefutably voluptuous and longing to be kissed, 

If there was water on the scorched soil of arid desert; the surrounding
wildlife would get substantial reprieve from sweltering storms of heat, 

If there was water on rampant flames of fire ominously rising up by the
zipping second; the occupants inside would be saved from the tyranny of
being burnt alive, 

If there was water on the elevation of dusty window panes; they would
suddenly glitter in animation; explicitly exposing the panoramic view outside, 

If there was water on the river bed; scores of children would gleefully
toss in it; splashing it frivolously on passing pedestrians, 

If there was water on clusters of scarlet rose; they would diffuse a
blissful fragrance penetrating the claustrophobic environment with a
reinvigorating aroma, 

If there was water on feathers of the majestic peacock; it had the
potential to circulate waves of rhapsody even in the veins of a dying man; when
the bird unfurled its wings to a complete blossom, 

If there was water on soiled cloth; incorrigible stains would be
indiscriminately exonerated; and the fabric would now resemble an
impeccable white, 

If there was water on the serrated skin of chameleon; it would appear
more rubicund while wandering indefatigably through the bushes, 

And If there was water on the inverted eyelashes of my beloved; she
would look like a goddess bathed in exquisite gold, 

And let me tell you friends it was very easy for us to unflinchingly
achieve the above mentioned; if only we learnt to save and judiciously preserve
water, 
As its every droplet is inevitably worth a million; for it is the
source of all life beside us; an indispensable fuel to rejuvenate the depleted
reservoir of our energy; 'WATER IS PRECIOUS'.

 HUNCH BACKED CAMEL

It bore the acrimonious tyranny of scorching sun round the year; 
leaving bold footprints in the dust it tread, 

Traversed incessantly through blistering soil; with sandy winds blowing
across its eyes, 

Ambled languidly in the brilliant day; increasing its pace a trifle at
the onset of night, 

Intermittently munched parrot green tentacles of rustic cactus; 
immensely relished the dry meal of leaf and thorn, 

Occasionally rubbed its slender neck against the sandpaper skin of wild
tree; raising its eyes toward the almighty residing in heaven, 

Angrily swished the scanty clusters of hair on its tail; to drive away
scores of petulant mosquitoes, 

Wore a bedraggled rope dangling loose from its neck; a cushioned saddle
riveted to its angular sculptured body; Intricate pieces of leather
wound to its mouth; to maneuver it through labyrinth of routes, 

Possessed a firm pair of hooves; which glistened all the more
profoundly in the sunbeams and looked mesmerizing under the placid moon, 

Had a slimy nose with gaping nostrils; which remained wet despite the
acrid warmth irrevocably prevailing, 

Spawned many of its kind; suckling its young ones utterly bereft of a
cloistered shade, 

Walked marathon distances in a single day; unrelentingly stepping on
islands of steaming land, 

Stooped down as much as it could; when confronted with tumultuous
whirlpools blowing with full might, 

Moaned in high pitched exuberance as it sighted a solitary stream; 
storing the water for months till it found a fresh source, 

Gallantly fought an army of disdainful crabs; audaciously kicked loose
rocks that came its way, 

Seldom shed its tears; overwhelmingly inspiring those who feared life
to come out of their nonexistent shells, 
Had a passion to bask under the dazzling sun; thoroughly detested
crystal blue patches in the sky being obfuscated by clouds, 

It had remained as stoical as omnipotent god under the most bizarre of
circumstances; refraining to flounder under the pugnacious heat, 

Was quite glad to adopt the sizzling silver sands as its companion for
life; even dreaming about the same while in deep sleep, 

I offer my humble salutations to this silent warrior; as my 'HUNCH
BACKED CAMEL' carries me through the colossal expanse of the Sahara desert.

 RAIN, RAIN AND UNSTOPPABLY RAIN

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
lugubriously famished leaves; which wailed in
unrelentingly incongruous unison; for those eternally
blissful droplets of water, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
fathomless mounds of fetidly acrid mud; which
inevitably wanted to be refreshingly washed; since
years immemorial, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
miserably asphyxiated deserts; whose tears had
cadaverously metamorphosed into treacherously
meaningless sands; vindictively stabbing countless in
the afternoon heat, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
innocuously pristine cattle and animals; who were
these days solely busy; in counting each other's
haplessly shriveled cartilage of horrifically
emaciated bones, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
forlornly barren beds of the boundless ocean; which
had gruesomely died till the very last bone of their
non-existent spines, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
pricelessly new born infants; who embraced death by
the countless numbers; in the unsparingly diabolical
heat of the Sun, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
chunks of lividly impotent mud; from the periphery of
which there sprouted nothing else but an indescribably
fuming battalion of pugnaciously distorted cracks, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
impoverished villagers; whose inarticulately mud-caked
abodes pathetically melted; under the undying fury of
the heartlessly charring Sun, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
dolorously dried meadows of grass; which exuded into
unfathomable mortuaries of sadistic blood; rather than
a festoon of enchantingly golden dew-drops, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
dogmatically sweating scalps and skins; which could
suffer from any instant from a complete nervous
breakdown; without the tiniest droplet of water in
their taps, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
lecherously empty wells which fretted in the aisles of
decrepit oblivion; with their innumerable tumblers of
water now despondently replaced by impugning dust, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
unfinished lamenting desires of true lovers; which
could royally fructify only when two voluptuously wet
bodies; invincibly united into one sensuous breath, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
unlimited ingredients of the ruthlessly scorched
atmosphere; whose living ghost tirelessly haunted and
imperiled; even the most celestially bountiful of victory, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
vituperatively parched lips; which hurled an
unsurpassable volley of incoherent abuse; as whenever
they desperately opened; all they could taste was
sordidly tormented mud, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
resplendently inscrutable forests; which now resembled
robotically devastated factories of sacrilegiously
monotonous charcoal, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
unfortunately doomed nostrils; which had nothing else
but disdainfully belligerent bellows of venomous smoke
to quintessentially inhale, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
rustic farmers with endless kilometers of land; but
from whose soil sprouted nothing else but the most
brutally lambasting curses of starvation, 

If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all those
penuriously strangulated throats; from which emanated
only the most cursedly discordant wails of
preposterously imprisoning helplessness, 

And If not for me; then atleast for the sake of all
those immortally passionate hearts; which had now
transformed into the epitomes of satanically
unforgivable infidelity; in absence of the most
unconquerable elixir required to sustain life, 

Please open your vivaciously undefeated belly O! 
Omnipotent Sky; please culminate into the most
thunderously voluptuous of clouds; and please
torrentially rain; rain; rain and unstoppably RAIN.

 IF YOU CUT A TREE; YOU CUT YOUR OWN MOTHER.

You're not just cutting the tree's artistically
slender branches; but by doing so you're infact
barbarously cutting the inimitably priceless hands of
triumphantly vivacious Mother Nature, 

You're not just plucking the tree's gorgeously affable
leaves; but by doing so you're infact torturously
plucking the unparalleled divine sensitivity; of
spellbindingly undefeated Mother Nature, 

You're not just indenting the tree's poignantly
gregarious trunk; but by doing so you're infact
sadistically indenting the unassailably jubilant
chastity of unbelievably proliferating Mother Nature, 

You're not just abusing the tree's incongruously
uninhibited contours; but by doing so you're infact
outrageously abusing the pricelessly unabashed swirl
of peerlessly undefeated Mother Nature, 

You're not just defecating on the tree's innocuously
protruding and sprawled roots; but by doing so you're
infact sacrilegiously defecating on the unshakably
redolent embodiments of wondrously enthralling Mother Nature, 

You're not just chopping the tree's merrily swaying
tendrils; but by doing so you're infact deliriously
chopping the perennially fructifying innocence of
gloriously Omnipotent Mother Nature, 

You're not just trimming the tree's ecstatically
liberated outgrowths; but by doing so you're infact
unnecessarily trimming the beautifully venerated womb
of victoriously blessing Mother Nature, 

You're not just kicking the tree's bountifully
untainted stem; but by doing so you're infact
ruthlessly kicking the sacredly spawning bosom of
brilliantly unfettered Mother Nature, 

You're not just peeling the tree's rustically majestic
corrugations; but by doing so you're infact
pervertedly peeling the invincibly silken skin of
effulgently burgeoning Mother Nature, 

You're not just burning the tree's unflinchingly
valiant wood; but by doing so you're infact insanely
burning the fearlessly formidable strength of
ebulliently cavorting Mother Nature, 

You're not just victimizing the tree's indisputably
royal foliage; but by doing so you're infact
truculently victimizing the insuperably unbridled
sensuality of ubiquitously ever-pervading Mother Nature, 

You're not just disorienting the tree's ardently
boisterous nests; but by doing so you're infact
hedonistically disorienting the eclectically
fascinating solar plexus of royally everlasting Mother Nature, 

You're not just ridiculing the tree's endlessly
inscrutable labyrinth of hollows; but by doing so
you're infact nefariously ridiculing the unfathomably
enigmatic belly of stupendously ameliorating Mother Nature, 

You're not just jailing the tree's effervescently
nubile body with an unceasing jugglery of devilishly
stabbing electric wire; but by doing so you're infact
unforgivably jailing the infallibly supreme identity
of impeccably Omnipresent Mother Nature, 

You're not just nailing the tree's immortally fragrant
heart; but by doing so you're infact diabolically
nailing the celestially undaunted fabric of
ecstatically frolicking Mother Nature, 

You're not just dumping the tree's philanthropically
unimpeachable cradle with your fetid garbage can
trash; but by doing so you're infact reproachfully
dumping the mellifluously humming mouth of exuberantly
evolving Mother Nature, 

You're not just bombarding the tree's timelessly
gargantuan splendor; but by doing so you're infact
baselessly bombarding the perennially beautiful
virility of unlimitedly stupefying Mother Nature, 

You're not just spitting upon the tree's resplendently
beaming face; but by doing so you're infact
unpardonably spitting on the impregnably spotless
heavenliness of vivaciously magical Mother Nature, 

You're not just uprooting the tree from its very
eternally compassionate soil; but by doing so you're
infact sinfully uprooting the quintessentially blessed
existence of benevolently healing Mother Nature, 

So always remember O! salaciously greedy man; that the
next time you wretchedly pulverize; abuse; trade and
victimize Mother Nature; you'll be infact demonically
asphyxiating your very own Omniscient mother to the
most ghastly death; as your's and everyone else's
mother was first and foremost born out of the womb of
Mother Nature; was first and foremost the child of
unconquerable Mother Nature Divine.

 THUNDERBOLTS OF RAIN

Normally when I started back for home; I commenced my
journey languidly eating pop-corn; aimlessly kicking
small stones that came in my way, 
While today I tripped each time I raised my foot; 
relinquished all capacity to sight objects even a foot
further.

Normally when I started back for home; I hummed
melodious tunes; smiling flirtatiously at every girl I
encountered on the way, 
While today I looked at my watch a million times; 
grunted in exasperation as I couldn't bear to see the
disdainful blotches of slush adhering all across my
immaculate shirt.

Normally when I started back for home; I winked
mischievously at the sun; took marathon minutes in
idling my scooter to full gear, 
While today I trembled in the icy winds; felt utterly
miserable as my feather weight shoes; felt as heavy as
heavy ships floating on the sea.

Normally when I started back for home; I waved goodbye
to all my colleagues; wishing them a blissful and
tranquil sleep, 
While today as I stepped out in the ominous dark; I
closed my ears in alarm; to shun the chaotic
pandemonium of horns and blaring traffic.

Normally when I started back for home; I phoned my
wife on the mobile; romancing dreamily for long
minutes about our experiences of the past; 
While today I emptied my pants of all contraptions and
my wallet; scampered for safety like a rabbit for
under gigantic branches of the tree.

Normally when I started for home; my mind wandered
rampantly; envisaging all the delectable delicacies
which I would consume for supper in the night, 
While today the food in my stomach churned in nervous
energy; almost strangulating my senses as it tried to

Normally when I started for home; I always made it a
rule to halt my vehicle at signals; thereby letting
others pass peacefully before I proceeded further, 
While today my foot refrained to leave the
accelerator; as I sky rocketed cursing the skies; at
electric speeds towards my dwelling.

Normally when I started for home; I stopped
frequently in the way to munch sandwiches; smoked a
cigarette or two in the crowded shopping square, 
While today my sole focus was to wade myself
dexterously through the rivers overflowing; protecting
my cherished checkbook from getting soiled.

Normally when I started for home; I spent good amount
of time choosing my favorite pen; for signing the
company guestbook, 
While today I virtually dropped all what I was
carrying; dragged my weight outside like a charged
volcano; running at full speed and at the same time
yelling at the top of my breath.

And Normally when I started for home; the skies were
crystal clear; with the Sun god about to set
splendidly into the horizon; the birds chirping
boisterously to announce the onset of cool night, 
While today the reason for my behaving insane; was
that there were streaks of white lightening in the
sky; with thunderbolts of rain pelting in uncouth fury
all over.

 JUST A MINUTE TO DESTRUCTION

The tree took a century to grow to unprecedented
limits; blossoming into boundless branches and
resplendent foliage, 
And it took you just a minute to chop it to the
ground; with barbaric strokes of your gleaming
pickaxe.

The mountains took thousands of years to evolve; with
their summits towering handsomely towards the sky; 
camouflaged in a heap of pristine snow, 
And it took you just a minute to pulverize their
blissful demeanor to flimsy ash; bombarding them
ruthlessly with your hi-tech and contemporary bombs.

The colorful tribes trespassing on the planet took
several decades to spawn; indulging into a myriad of
festivity and sacrosanct beliefs, 
And it took you just a minute to make them the most
acrimonious of enemies; poisoning their minds against
each other; with your deceiving and manipulative talk.

The tantalizingly salty waters of the ocean took
centuries to form; harboring an ingratiating variety
of fish and vivacious coral weeds, 
And it took you just a minute to adulterate its entire
visage; dropping abominable buckets of crude oil from
the ship.

The atmosphere took infinite births to be created; 
kissing every part of the globe with its silken
caress, 
And it took you just a minute to pollute it
indiscriminately; blowing obnoxious gases from your
vehicle; at a full throttle.

The soil took millions of years to preserve wells of
precious liquid; entrapping droplets of scintillating
water deep within its core, 
And it took you just a minute to savagely plunder its
harmony; inserting your hydraulic and contemporary
drilling equipment to empty it; till it cried.

The cow wandering timidly on the slopes took loads of
agonizing time to fill the colossal buckets with its
milk; each globule of white oozing having the
fortitude to outclass the most ingenious of vitamins
single handedly, 
And it took you just a minute to blend it with cheap
saliva; to augment its quantity; before you
commercially sold it to unsuspecting customers.

The old men and women spent their entire lifetimes to
incessantly worship and revere their culture and
heritage; sacrificed their heads to prevent even a
single blemish from infiltrating into their land, 
And it took you just a minute to ruthlessly transgress
across them; satanically maraud their ideals; and
embracing alien winds just because they suited your
taste.

The World Trade Center took countless months to
construct; sheltered thousands of individuals; some of
the most innovative brains from all across the
continent, 
And it took you just a minute to squelch it to bellows
of black dust; using your cowardly and diabolical mind
to smash it with airplanes; having innocent people
trapped inside.

It took more than times ever perceivable to harness
the spirit of love; spreading it like wild fire into
the heart of every human being walking on this soil; 
every palpable entity gallivanting with a glimmer of
hope in its eyes, 
And it took you just a minute to completely destroy
its mesmerizing essence; leaving it no scope at all to
flourish with all your killings; war and hostility.

 RAINBOW

Violent streaks of nail polish V IOLET, 
circular shades of flaming I NDIGO, 
fat smear of bright parrot G REEN, 
thick envelope of heavenly cloud B LUE, 
thin smudges of neglected dirty Y ELLOW, 
peripheral paint lines of blazing O RANGE, 
encapsulating outlines of deathly R ED, 
prompted by brilliant sunshine in cascading rain, 
sky patches of light blue, 
sun ball shining in full heat at boiling point, 
thin wisps of pale white cloud cover, 
dispersed in distant boundaries of the sun, 
shriveled to an iota of their traditional attire, 
which is dark grey with blushes of black, 
now discharging rain in sunlight, 
forming a perfect VIGBYOR rainbow, 
to the unconquered delight of living organism, 
existing in spiceless moments of worldly life.

 CHANGING FACES OF WEATHER

Flashes of red swept across my eyes, 
blended with infinite dust particles of atmosphere, 
as fireballs of sun blazed through the sky, 
penetrating sapphire blue cloud covers, 
falling in strong beams of light, 
lightening dull patches of suspended moisture, 
filtering stringently through transparent tree leaf, 
submerging the entire galaxy with enchanting golden, 
fumigating stale drain water with shades of boiling heat, 
scorching naked stone pebbles strewn on beds of the
mountain river.

The car seat rocked violently, 
tender bones of my body reverberated with mounting speeds, 
curtain spreads of green rushed past my vision, 
meandering curves of the valley descended towards the horizon, hordes of wild monkey occasionally danced on car roof, a camouflage of ripened banana hung from tall tree, 
orphan splinters of ice cascaded down the valley, 
trajectory, the tropical weather displayed erratic fluctuation, 
vast layers of crystal sky developed blotches of dirty grey, 
bright spots of sunshine were overpowered by
thunderous cloud ravishing smiles crept from angular corners of my mouth, i then stretched my feet in the cozy interiors of my
crimson Mercedes, as gigantic droplets of rain pelted in fury, 
from the sky which now resembled, white canvas painted with pure deathly black.

charismatic evolution; under its unceasingly
enlightening and impeccably godly rays, 

The most bizarrely crippling and doomed hopelessness; 
became the winds of exuberantly galloping tomorrow; 
under its wonderfully effulgent and faultlessly fecund rays, 

And inspite of all this; isn't it strange; that you; 
me and virtually every other human being on earth; ran
away from the everlasting firebody of the Omnipotent
Sun; worthlessly complaining that it was a trifle too
harsh for our skins; burning us; blackening us; 
charring us; making us relentlessly perspire; 
worthlessly slandering the Sun infront of the stupidly
lifeless air-conditioner; for salaciously tiring us; 
whereas it was our sole reservoir of strength; 
inspiration and power to survive; in veritable
reality?

 BECOMING ONE IN MIND; BODY AND SPIRIT-AS THE SUNLIGHT KISSED

As it kissed the frigidly shriveled leaves of the tree; they suddenly simmered with boisterous currents of rhapsodic life; abruptly ending
the era of all that was rotten with adulterated man-made filth, 

As it kissed the lackadaisically stagnant swamps of water; they
suddenly metamorphosed into a fantabulous effervescent river; charming
one and all with its undulating ripples of unparalleled ecstasy, 

As it kissed the sullenly polluted particles of dust; they suddenly
became the most poignantly enthralling breeze of victory; mesmerizing
living kind of all ages and shapes with the freshness of priceless life, 

As it kissed the rocks miserably eroded with ominous bomb; they
suddenly stood with their chests unflinching and high; with an
alacrity now undefeated by any sinful artificial man or machine, 

As it kissed the parsimonious layers of brutally pulverized soil; 
they suddenly transformed into an uninhibited womb of procreation; 
now feeling relieved of all angst; fertilizer and robotized greed, 

As it kissed the disdainfully trembling roots of the tree; they
suddenly started to glow in anticipation of a fearless next life; 
forming the most blissful bonds of perpetuity with royal crusts of
sacrosanct soil, 

As it kissed the lividly lame weeds aimlessly squandering on the ocean; they suddenly sprang up with an untamed leap towards the sky; saluting the Almighty Divine with every euphoric rise of the frosty wave, 

As it kissed the silken webs shattered by barbarous prejudices of man; they suddenly coalesced together in the most perfect rhyme of all times; with each of their strand being an everlasting testimonial to the spirit of a united living kind,

As it kissed the non-existent shadow of the raunchily marauding devils; they suddenly entered the scepter of a new-found blessed life; whose aura of immortal love vanquished every trace of sin & lies-  forever and ever and ever, 

As it kissed the umpteen blades of squeamishly fetid moist grass; they suddenly started to emanate the scent of victory; miraculously rising in unison towards the heaven- -in the most vibrantly united fortress of green, 

As it kissed the irately squabbling religions of Hinduism; Islam; 

As it kissed the woefully wounded- -wailing every moment to somehow escape the grave; they suddenly levitated into bits of open blue sky; united hand in hand under just one Omnipotent Light of truth from the
Creator, 

As it kissed perverted minds rampantly ravaging the fabric of
impeccable humanity; they suddenly started to resound in the song of togetherness and calm; charring most insouciant iota of devilry to the invisible ashes,

 ARE YOU READY TO FULFILL THE TREE'S LAST WISH? 

You unsparingly spat leftovers of your food on its innocent body- -yet
the same tree granted you the most tranquil contentment under its
branches; as the afternoon glare fiercely torched even the last bone
of your creaking spine, 

You ruthlessly plucked a plentiful of its leaf without any reason or
rhyme- -yet the same tree enamored you with boundless an untold story; 
as you slumped your entire weight in tiredness; across its majestic
trunk, 

You barbarously scratched it to express frustration for your penurious
life- - yet the same tree healed even the most inexplicably bleeding
of your wounds; as you perched in its magical shadow which radiated
immortal love, 

You inhumanely dug a countless nails into its body to hang your
belongings- - yet the same tree stood like an infallible fortress
between you and the storm; perpetuating nothing but rejuvenating
friendship into every pore of your frigidly shivering skin, 

You insidiously drilled a hole through it to keep sight of your
enemy- -  yet the same tree transformed each of its tears into
blessings just for you; to give you new direction and fortitude to
righteously pursue chapters of a truthful life, 

You venomously reduced it into a practice punching bag as you pummeled
its form with your daily morning kicks and blows- - yet the same tree
imparted supreme enlightenment to your waveringly beleaguered vision; 
with its entrenchment of vivacious green, 

You insanely emptied all brutal lead in your gun into its unflinching
body as it served as the best target range- -  yet the same tree
provided royal shelter in its top branches to your trembling form; as
you hurriedly scampered up to escape the satanic wolves, 

You cannibalistically slit its throat an umpteen times to crackle up
your night with that quintessential firewood- -yet the same tree
welcomed you with the most everlasting embrace of its swishing arms
and leaf; as every of your beguilingly merciless kin had deserted you
to die of solitude, 

You vindictively defecated; vomited; urinated at its stem; to show you
give a damn—yet the same tree blessed and showered you with a festoon
of feathers; leaves; raindrops and goodness; with every single draught
of gusty wind; and made you feel like an ultimate prince, 

You diabolically whipped it with your waist-belt and walking stick to
release the volcanic energy of your numb shoulder and palm- -yet the
same tree befriended you with kisses of love; as you clung to it like
a child when the devastating earthquake struck, 

You hurled on it every abuse you'd learnt in the process of your life
as you knew it hadn't the power to retaliate- -yet the same tree gave
you the ultimate pillow to sleep on every night in its compassionately
protruding roots; when the hole in your tattered pockets grew larger
by the minute, 

You indiscriminately butchered its body many a time to get rid of
unkempt weeds that loitered your spurious courtyard- -yet the same
tree blossomed once again in due course of time taking its strength
from mother earth; only to bless you with that everlasting shade; cool
and mid-summer siesta, 

You ominously inscribed many an enthusing shape on its body with your
knife only to woo your girlfriend to profess- -yet the same tree saw
to it that your friendship immortalized into the truest of love; 
courtesy its now gruesomely bleeding countenance split into livid
rags, 

You tyrannically subjected it to all kinds of electricity; just to
assert how ingeniously you'd proved that it too had life- -yet the
same tree gave you a roof for your house when it'd blown away; 
chivalrously gave you its fruit to eat when your bowels were on the
verge of spewing famished blood, 

You belligerently stripped it of all its flower every morning to
empower your flower shop with its lifeless roots and scent- -yet the
same tree gave you that much missing whistle in your monotonous
existence; tantalizing you to fantasize about all goodness on this
fathomless planet, 

You sadistically burnt every bit of its charm on the spurious pretext
that ghosts were stuck to it- -yet the same tree once again evolved
into a kingly assortment of flowers; leaves and silken branch; to
comfort you in your bizarre sadness and prove that it was nothing but
nature's ultimate gift to all mankind, 

You greedily snatched its newborn tendrils each day to farcically
brush the already shines whites of your teeth- - yet the same tree
bore the brunt of every heinous sword; stone and bomb on its naked
body; singlehandedly wading off the fanatic mob; invincibly guarding
you as you snored, 

You unthinkably let countless of it felled down to read your books on
lavish paper instead of switching over to e-books- - yet the same tree
continued to enlighten your nostrils with its scent of a united earth; 
as you fancily flipped through your novel pages extracted from its
pristine bark, 

And even as you were about to criminally extricate it from its very
roots to make way for your new dwelling- - the tree only asked you to
fulfill its final wish- -that was to plant it at some place else; 
bless you with unsurpassable cisterns of luck; happiness; contentment; 
fantasy; shade and charm as it blossomed up towards blue sky, 

So are you ready to forgive it as it had also forgiven you a countless
times; Are you ready to fulfill the Tree's one last wish? 

 DEHRADUN AND MUSSORRIE (INDIA) .

A garland of formidably handsome mountains; royally decked
up in beautifully unparalleled tufts of emerald green vegetation, 

Dense and astoundingly profound clusters of clouds floating in
unfettered abandon; kissing the farthermost epitomes of the
hills with untold stories of enamoring benevolence, 

Delightfully robust creeks weaving their way in an unabashed
freshness through the rocky swirl; as they eventually melanged
with sobriety atthe rock bottom of the river bed, 

Tantalizing waterfalls of immaculate white froth cascading
majestically into a mist triumphant optimism; that thoroughly
charmed the spirit of a commercially depraved and
impoverished existence, 

Exuberant and curved lanes through the gigantic slopes that
rhapsodically led a beleaguered traveler to one of his most
cherished destinations; in an adventure towards exhilarating
righteousness, 

Fiercely mischievous monkeys gnawing at fruits of myriad
shapes and proportions - feasting at those occasional
succulent crumbs hurled by children - without giving a trifle
damn to vehicles that whizzed past at whirlwind speeds, 

Sporadic thunderstorms accompanied with indomitably
passionate streaks of silver lightening; that triggered
unmatched infernos of desire through the solitariness of
untainted valley, 

An instantaneous spell of torrential rain whilst sipping
marvelous hot tea in the garden; which to the utter and
incredulous amazement yielded impeccable white pearls of the
seasons virgin snow, 

An entire Herculean maze of tall trees that constituted the royal
approach to the spectacular city; an entrenchment so thickly
foliated; that it was here that wildlife existed to its unhesitatingly
glorious best, 

An unprecedented chill in the atmosphere as the night
romantically descended in the pristine gorge; and the woolens
which had become so obsolete in the sweltering city now
snatched impromptu from the innermost corners of the
suitcase, 

Unbelievably tall peaks clad in frosty coats of ice; looming
large and phlegmatically into the distant horizons as the car
entered and swerved sharply towards the last motorable patch
on the extraordinarily tenacious rock, 

A gloriously golden dawn which brought alongwith it an
optimistic desire to excel for the cause of goodness and truth -
as the invincible fireball of Sun brilliantly empowered the
surface of earth with the light of love and friendship, 

Gregarious grass buds sensuously draped in dew; with frogs
joyously scampering through the plush lawns - as nimble feet
indisputably relished their compassionate stroll on the ground
after ages; early morning, 

Tourists flocking from different parts of the globe; at their
vibrantly colorful best; cherishing the verdant landscapes and
that steeped to incomprehensibly surreal heights - ultimately
ending into bits of ebullient open space, 

A veritable treat for true lovers who philandered and flirted in
compassionate desire; on a land which was replete with
sumptuously ecstatic adventure and a serenity that befitted
perfect camaraderie, 

Poets, writers - described the town's imperious beauty in
verses, essays, that stupendously enthralled - and artists; 
sculptors; delivered their fantabulous best - amidst the aweinspiring
natural environment which mollified the tiniest of
apprehension, 

A panoramically adorable facilitator of peace - making the most
spitefully vengeful wholesomely shunt war and abominable
hatred - embrace the fellow living being in the essence of true
brotherhood, 

The palatial house of my wonderfully impressive grandparents
where I spent some of the most victorious moment of my
childhood - without worrying or contemplating an ounce on the
vagaries of the pompously spurious society, 

I salute my revered and sacrosanct birthplace - ‘ Dehradun '

If you die before me
I would jump down into your grave
and hug you so innocently
	                        

	                        
	                          .  
	                        

	                        
	                          .  


I would jump down into your grave
and hug you so innocently
that angels will become jealous.

I shall kiss you.
So intimately shall I kiss you
that your breath becomes mine.
In one breath of love shall 
we merge into hugs of true joy.

Your heart shall beat
in rhythms unheard
like the drums of the desert
and the wild forest in the night.

You shall murmur in my ears: 
'Oh  press me to your chest; 
Tear open your chest, 
Make way for me 
to enter into your loving heart
that beats only for me in resounding colors.

Tell me please Oh my lover
Is it a rainbow that I see? 
or the glow of a burning pyre? 
Why is it that I cannot utter it in words? 
Tell me glorious angels of love: 
What am I experiencing in uncountable
moments of indescribable inner comfort? 


Shivering in your presence
I shall long to dance with you.

If the dark souls lead you to Hades
I will dance and dance with you
even in the nether world.

We shall dance soft and then wild.
We shall dance together
as one body and soul 
and break the fetters of hell
through love that emanates from our dance.

Dance so long and fine like a poem

Breaking the fetters of Hades
the white angels  attired in beauty
shall fly down to pick you up on golden cradles

So  you will be free and fly away 
from me into the world of the heavens
where angels shall kiss your sacred body.
You will be attired in gold and white
and in varied colors in tune 
with the flowers of heaven.

Then you need no space to live and breathe.

Into that world of purity you will go
and I will be here on earth
dreaming of your joys with 
the Heavenly spirits.

Shall I wait? 

Shall I wait at dusk and dawn
in sobs and a heaving heart
with such desire and passion
to reach you one day 
in your world of happiness.

Here the living lover is ready to go to hell to dance with her most fiercely and save her from the hell)If you die before me
I will not weep, 
I will never shed a tear of sheep
I will not accompany you to graveyard
I will not come and see your decorated corpse
I will not show the courtesy to stand before
the full audience and say those words of mourning
i will not pray, nor will i share the agony
i will not tell all your friends that you are dead
and come to funeral and there we shall meet 
in his honour and respecting his dead body dear
I will not do the usual routines
which decent men do, speech of reverence 
to the departed soul, go to the mass, go to church, 
go to the papers and check and speak in low and voice sweet
about the obituary advertised and air your greatness
If you die before me
all I will do is to go to the lab near
and buy some Cyanide and eat it there 
and just laugh and dance, switch on the titanic song
and take a rum or a whisky or a wine or a blue label
and enjoy the way I join hands with you
into a land where no intruders can touch me and you
we will hide from their searching eyes
screen drawn across I shall rejoice in honeymoon bed
the stupid and idiots they will cry and weep
I will come with you, to the land of angels
there in all nude and naked garments
we will in public mate till mating season never ends
if it is winter here, we will mate here
if it is summer here, we will move on
and mate with lust and liberty in the next world
like musical chairs, we will move on and one
but the mating season, is it winter dear
we shall celebrate and spill all our babies dear
our seeds of ripened love, we shall sow in all gardens
the whole world and we, the eternal pairs, evergreen ewes
again and again i will become pregnant, 
again and again i will milk and suckle my babies innocent
every night, we shall uncover and in transparency do delight
every night, we shall squeeze into and hug and kiss and 
humbly shall I open my door of sweetness
and offer you all the modesties with heavenly desire
coffee, tea, sandwitches, cakes, biscuits, bananas, honey
cadbury sweets, cookies, delicious payasams, jalebis
mysore paks, padam halwas, dooth pedas, watering jack fruits
come onto my mansion my lord, i will ask you to enter
no entry passes, no licences, you shall walk, like a man
ha ha ha, oh no more can i write, they are peering and 
saying, oh god, what a dirty woman she is, never seen all life. 

I want you to know
one thing. 



	                        
	                          .  
	                        

	                        
	                          .  


one thing. 

You know how this is: 
if I look 
at the crystal moon, at the red branch 
of the slow autumn at my window, 
if I touch 
near the fire 
the impalpable ash 
or the wrinkled body of the log, 
everything carries me to you, 
as if everything that exists, 
aromas, light, metals, 
were little boats 
that sail 
toward those isles of yours that wait for me. 

Well, now, 
if little by little you stop loving me 
I shall stop loving you little by little. 

If suddenly 
you forget me 
do not look for me, 
for I shall already have forgotten you. 

If you think it long and mad, 
the wind of banners 
that passes through my life, 
and you decide 
to leave me at the shore 
of the heart where I have roots, 
remember 
that on that day, 
at that hour, 
I shall lift my arms 
and my roots will set off 
to seek another land. 

But 
if each day, 
each hour, 
you feel that you are destined for me 
with implacable sweetness, 
if each day a flower 
climbs up to your lips to seek me, 
ah my love, ah my own, 
in me all that fire is repeated, 
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten, 
my love feeds on your love, beloved, 
and as long as you live it will be in your arms 
without leaving mine. 

If you had a friend strong, simple, true,
Who knew your faults and who understood;
Who believed in the very best of you,
And who cared for you as a father would;
Who would stick by you to the very end,
Who would smile however the world might frown:
I'm sure you would try to please your friend,
You never would think to throw him down.

And supposing your friend was high and great,
And he lived in a palace rich and tall,
And sat like a King in shining state,
And his praise was loud on the lips of all;
Well then, when he turned to you alone,
And he singled you out from all the crowd,
And he called you up to his golden throne,
Oh, wouldn't you just be jolly proud?

If you had a friend like this, I say,
So sweet and tender, so strong and true,
You'd try to please him in every way,
You'd live at your bravest -- now, wouldn't you?
His worth would shine in the words you penned;
You'd shout his praises . . . yet now it's odd!
You tell me you haven't got such a friend;

An unfortunate set of events and circumstances.
A tragedy in its truest form.
Memories so cold yet they are still warm.
Some say his death could have been prevented.
But I know not how one could stop the stars from aligning that night.
Digging into the past can be traumatic.
Digging into the past can also be fantastic.
A heart felt thought of who you were back then.
What you did, who you loved.
A fun time that got blurred as you moved on.
We drift from one life to the next.
Sometimes one is more innocent of the mistakes made.
Ignorance is never a valid excuse if abused.
Repetition is the music that continues to beat.
Destiny is an eye opening ride so just take a seat.
Take it all in.
Be completely aware of all our surroundings.
Take part in it.
For we know not how long it will last.
Time leaves the the wind still.
A motionless body of a image that happen so fast.
No control over what we will see when we close our eyes.
To tell ourself otherwise is just another lie.
Putting colors into the skies
We not only must survive, but must put meaning to what we left behind.
What is an explanation without reason? 
How many times will we see these changes in the seasons? 
We will not know if its of a life not lived. 

If you keep reading, 
Reading 
Even in your old age, 
When, when
Will you smile with me, 
Talk with me, 
My love? 

As say they really
If he keeps reading, 
Reading all the time, 
He may go mad, 
Fully mad
As for being lost in studies
And researches.

If leave you, 
Leave you not your studies, 
I shall, 
Shall leave you
For my parents' home
And shall never, 
Never return.

My love, 
What has it happened 
To you
That smile you not, 
Talk you not, 
What has it to you? 

Have you, 
Have you not time
For talking with me, 
Gossiping, 
No time to see me, 
See me? 

Who will, 
Who will bring
The ribbon, lipstick, 
Nail polish, hair oil, 
Red water colour, 
Vermillion, bangles, 
If remain you lost in books? 

If leave you not your studies, 
If leave you not, 
I shall have the last option
Left with me
That to burn your papers
If leave you not our studies.

I shall fling
All of your books and papers, 
Shall burn them down
By pushing into
The hearth, 
The earthen oven
For the cooking purpose.    

Having said it, 
Marked it for sometime more, 
The rustic love started weeping
None but herself, 
Flinging the cups and dishes, 
Rolling on the muddy floor
Of the country home.

A pastoral girl
Who used to love and live
With the goats, sheep and cows
Dwelling in the country, 
Never could she take it
In a light way, 
A village girl she, 
A pastoral shepherd girl.

And what twitched it more
That somebody had communicated to her
That he would move overseas
If he went on reading as thus
Being lost in books and rapt in studies
Surely would to Vilayat
And so she before the happening of all this
Wanted to desist him from.

O, I see, 
He would got to foreign, 
Foreign
And would bring a rival, 
An English, 
And would smile in her company
Which but how shall I tolerate it

If you lift yourself up to me
with all your heart
I shall be with you in your distress
for you have heard the words of my mouth.

I shall clothe you with my robe of mercy
And gird you with my joy.
I shall fix you like a peg in a sure spot
I shall give you honor wherever you are.

- 
worshiping you in my secret temple
I  offer you the incense of love 
before your golden shrine.

I shall sing your praises 
playing on my veena.

Would you be pleased
when I dance
through the night
in your holy presence, 
until the dawn breaks 
into mild golden rays. 

(Veena is an Indian musical instrument)If you love me. 
you will never make me cry
If you love me. 
you will look into my eyes
If you love me. 
you will hold me in your arms
If you love me. 
you will keep me safe from harm
If you love me. 
you will say you understand
If you love me. 
you will smile and hold my hand
If you love me. 
you will say how you love me so
I love you. 
and I will never let you go.


Also writin by my friend hillary


Far from me and like the stars, the sea and all the trappings of poetic myth,
Far from me but here all the same without your knowing,
Far from me and even more silent because I imagine you endlessly.
Far from me, my lovely mirage and eternal dream, you cannot know.
If you only knew.
Far from me and even farther yet from being unaware of me and still unaware.
Far from me because you undoubtedly do not love me or, what amounts to the
same thing, that I doubt you do.
Far from me because you consciously ignore my passionate desires.
Far from me because you are cruel.
If you only knew.
Far from me, joyful as a flower dancing in the river at the tip of its aquatic stem,
sad as seven p. 

m. in a mushroom bed.
Far from me yet silent in my presence and still joyful like a stork-shaped hour
falling from on high.
Far from me at the moment when the stills are singing, at the moment when the
silent and loud sea curls up on its white pillows.
If you only knew.
Far from me, o my ever-present torment, far from me in the magnificent noise of
oyster shells crushed by a night owl passing a restaurant at first light.
If you only knew.
Far from me, willed, physical mirage.
Far from me there's an island that turns aside when ships pass.
Far from me a calm herd of cattle takes the wrong path, pulls up stubbornly at the
edge of a steep cliff, far from me, cruel woman.
Far from me, a shooting star falls into the poet's nightly bottle.
He corks it right away and from then on watches the star enclosed in the glass, the
constellations born on its walls, far from me, you are so far from me.
If you only knew.
Far from me a house has just been built.
A bricklayer in white coveralls at the top of the scaffolding sings a very sad little
song and, suddenly, in the tray full of mortar, the future of the house appears:
lovers' kisses and double suicides nakedness in the bedrooms strange beautiful
women
and their midnight dreams, voluptuous secrets caught in the act by the parquet
floors.
Far from me, If you only knew.
If you only knew how I love you and, though you do not love me, how happy I
am, how strong and proud I am, with your image in my mind,
to leave the universe.
How happy I am to die for it.
If you only knew how the world has yielded to me.
And you, beautiful unyielding woman, how you too are my prisoner.
O you, far-from-me, who I yield to.
If you only knew. 

If you're going to kill me tonight, 
do it slowly.

I promise you won't need to bind me.
I won't move.

If you choose a blade, let it be sharp
but make your cuts shallow.  

I want to feel the warmth of my blood on my skin.

I promise you wont need to gag me.
I won't scream.  I'll close my eyes
and bite through my lip.

If you're going to kill me tonight, 
let me feel my life slip away.  

As my breath slows, as the end nears, kiss
me gently on my forehead.  I love you. 

Just between the darkness and your smile
Lay an infinite chorus of inconspicuous resonance
Like light passed through reflections in self-contained waters
The moment I tried to catch you was already too late

I'm not gonna sink this time
I will sail the sorrowful cracks of emptiness
Until I have appeased your angel

The car is still parked up on that hill
Overgrown with barbed wire and bloody pedals of roses
The last place I had seen you before I choked
If I had another night, I might have you back

But I'm not gonna sink this time
I will sail the sorrowful cracks of emptiness
Until I have appeased your angel

I tried to stare down that endless grave
The coffin lay unsteady within the rocky ground
And the breath you took that blew the breeze against my neck
I still felt you there, I still feel you here

How could I resist? 
The temptation that's leading me closer to falling
To be right next to you againif you really love someone, ..
than make them feel so good, ..
share all your feelings, good or bad, . 
and never say you should

if you really love someone, ..
show them that you care, ..
call them up and talk to them
from any place, from any where

if you really love someone, ..
accept them as they are
and let them know that you will be
behind them near or far

if you really love someone, ..
than tell them every day, . 
because tomorrow is a gift; 
and you may not have the chance to say, 
i love you anyway


If you show patience, I'll rid you of this virtue.
If you fall asleep, I'll rub the sleep from your eyes.
If you become a mountain, I'll melt you in fire.
And if you become an ocean, I'll drink all your water. 

If you take away my breath
I will fall down and perish.
My body shall return to dust.

when in springtime the nature 
wakes up from the winter sleep.

You alone can renew
the face of the earth.

I shall open my mouth


If you've melted your desires
in the river of time, choose
to be a recluse, or choose
a family, the village job.

you'll be That, wherever. 

I trust you not to leave and go astray
My feelings would be lost, in disarray
There would be little I could think to say
If you ever went away

And if you ever left and broke my will
The thought of missing you would leave me still
Unable to perform my very best
If you ever took your heart and left

If I ever gave you cause to leave
No matter how I felt, I'm sure I'd grieve
And underneath it all, I'd fall apart
If you ever left and took your heart


You shared all sorrows of my life
you pained to transcend nostalgia 
of my solitude like a canoe 
to make me across the loneliness

If you were not my friend
had not I been sojourning
to entwine the garlands of poems
to make your offerings
when all petals will wilt
you will certainly throw it
but if you have ever muttered
its resonance shall echo through ages
you will realise to celebrate
your all feelings, but the withered flowers
will certainly be consoling your faith
to make your life a splendid castle
then you can live with true happiness
with full enthusiasm  of your life

Your delicacy would ever remind me
if you were not my friend. 

If  you  would  only  call  me  once, 
And  write  a  letter  too; 
It  might  just  end  the  pain  I  feel
That  comes  from  loving  you.

If  you  would  only  be  my  friend, 
And  when  you  see  me  smile; 
You'd  bring  me  happiness  unbound
And  make  my  life  worthwhile.

If  you  would  only  come  one  time, 
And  sit  down  by  my  side; 
I'd  tell  you  things  you'll  never  hear
That  others  choose  to  hide.

If  you  would  only  hold  my  hand, 
As  I  prepare  to  go; 
And  kiss  my  cheek  one  final  time, 
That's  all  I'd  have  to  know.

Yes,  all  I  need  from  you  my  dear  
Is  just  to  know  you  care; 
Then  I'll  have  joy  for  all  my  life  
And  still  have  some  to  spare.

Then  with  such  joy,  I'll  surely  be
Delivered  from  my  plight; 
And  go  to  sleep,  contented  then  
To  sleep  alone  at  night.

Yes,  if  you  did  these  simple  things, 
That's  all  I  would  require; 
Then  I  could  live  without  it  quenched, 
The  love  that  I  desire. 

If and only if we could transform to higher states
by just wishing self, I would fly into oblivion, 
where you cannot chase my mind or feelings pining in line

If and only if i could evaporate as I please
i will just escape into a drop in the pool yonder
and wipe off all human bondages just in one single flush.

If and only if i could fly away to Hybernating Artics, 
i will glide away with yonder swans into paradise lakes
never to come back and be with silly mortal prigs and fakes.

Iff I could delete all my memories with you and all others in my life
in one split second i would cut off my wings that are stained with those memories of mine and wash off my timelines and dissolve into hyacinths where none could trace my origin and end, me reduced to a single invisible self loving spot, I loving myself, shall rest in peace. 

Oh happy he who cannot see
      With scientific eyes;
Who does not know how flowers grow,
      And is not planet wise;
Content to find with simple mind
      Joys as they are:
To whom a rose is just a rose,
      A star--a star.
 
It is not good, I deem, to brood
      On things beyond our ken;
A rustic I would live and die,
      Aloof from learned men;
And laugh and sing with zest of Spring
      In life's exultant scene,--
For vain my be philosophy,
      And what does meaning mean?

I'm talking rot,--I'm really not
      As dumb as I pretend;
But happiness, I dimly guess,
      Is what counts in the end.
To educate is to dilate
      The nerves of pain:
So let us give up books and live
      Like hinds again.

The best of wisdom surely is
      To be not overwise;
For may not thought be evil fraught,
      And truth less kind than lies?
So let me praise the golden days
      I played a gay guitar,
And deemed a rose was just a rose,
      A star--a star. 

Sojourn, efficacy entrapped within the boundaries
Choreographing the dances of life, like calligraphies

The strokes, beckoned a second look

Chapters and plots changed hands
Flock of thoughts flowed tearlessly beyond close range

Lives perished out of humans’ faults
Catastrophes, presumed as null and void

Serial numbers on the death certificates
Escalating at no rates

Who, constituted for the loss? 

Could we share the common interest? 
To live possibly from rags to riches




What marvels are we, taming our surroundings
Unquestionably superior to all life
Mocking the mindsets of medieval civilizations
Scoffing at any extraterrestrial incursion
Confident that we know what we’re doing to this planet
The Earth is no longer deemed the center of the Cosmos
But only for a few hundred years
Half an eye blink of time from the trees
Still violent, mindless, instinctual animals
Ridiculously puny, fetal
Few species alive as fledgling
This universe,billion years old
And this is only what we call the year Two hundred-thousand years old as a species
Yet industrialization is barely a century old
The technology age, a mere few decades
The world, run by believers in Bronze Age myths
Divided into clans, tribes, packs
Still warring instead of cooperating
Spending the lion’s share on military
Shallow pursuits and interests
Worshipping actors and athletes
Idolizing money
Rampant consumerism
Political corruption and incompetence
Waste, selfishness, entitlement, conceit
Should we somehow persevere another two-hundred years
Let alone two-hundred thousand or more
Our descendants will look upon us as we do cavemen
Superstitious, primitive, irresponsible beasts
Unable to control our brains
Unwilling to be rational
Squandering the rarity of consciousness


If Ignorance be Bliss
One may not seek for this
But if Intelligence is Unwise
One might not choose such prize
Without Wisdom Mercy is naught
Leaving Conscience as peril fraught
For Wisdom grows best by Mercy fed
These two in turn by Conscience are lead
When Intelligence and Wisdom don’t marry
Empathy and Love shall never nearby tarry
One schooled, in the college of living, knows
The ready distance Kindly Compassion goes
Though, by Knowledge, one may find  Light
Learning does not instill an unlimited  Right
To deny other humans their separate choice
If opposing ideas they do sometimes voice
For Learning would be but a hollow start
If Knowledge be lacking in having Heart
When Heart has defined its own Bliss
Intellect would ere to challenge this
Prudence, therefor, persists
That Ignorance be Bliss


She taught me two things, 
‘Ignorance and Beautiful.'

One day, she told me, 

'Let me tell you, 
The meaning of Beautiful.
Nature is beautiful, 
Life is beautiful, 
Love is beautiful, 
Care is beautiful, 
Share is beautiful, 
Understanding is beautiful, 
Trust is beautiful, 
Faith is beautiful, 
Passion is beautiful, 
Compassion is beautiful, 
Air is beautiful, 
Water is beautiful, 
Earth is beautiful, 
Fire is beautiful, 
Energy is beautiful, 
Here is beautiful, 
There is beautiful, 
Everywhere is beautiful, 
Everyone is beautiful, 
Everything is beautiful.'

I had to intervene, 
'Looks the universe is beautiful, 
But what is most beautiful? '
The reply comes full and straight, 
'Ignorance is awesomely beautiful.'

where my mind is calm
and hungry.

nothing satisfies
my appetite or curiosity.

buildings shade
a relentless sun.

i can't be the only one
walking this city
ignorant of my
destination. 

Fools-
Glory, 
Beauty, 
Perfection itself, 
Lay once within your grasp.
No more-
You have lost that chance, 
When you settled yourselves 
Into your lazy, laid-back, ignorant routine.
You lack imagination-
Stuck in your childish mentality, 
You, lacking vision, 
Are jealous of her, 
Who can see the future.
The stars are in her grasp-
And you, who might have been 
Raised up by lofty dreams, 
Content yourselves instead to sling mud, 
As if by your meager efforts
You might dim her glory.
Not so, fools. 
And, lest you think she might miss your company, 
Realize that she could not reach the stars
Without leaving the earth behind. 
And you, fools, ignorant, remain earth-bound.
You lack, not only vision, 
But also brains, 
And -now- her, 
Who wisely leaves behind 
Your worthless company.
And now, you wish her gone, 
But foolishly- for she, 
And she alone, 
Lent your group its glory.
Now, with her brilliance gone, 
You can have no hope.
You, in your stupid hard-headed
Ignorance, 
Have left yourselves
Alone, 
Dying, in the cold, 
Dead. 

I take all the trouble 
To meet a politician who is wise 
I get him easily but not in single 
But in two different personalities 
The wise man I found 
In a place, secluded 
Coiled up like an isolated insect 
For the reason that he takes decision 
Of his own as a wise man does.
But he is surely an ignorant who develops the art 
To listen and take decision 
Simply on the basis of majority opinion 
Is a mass leader 
And sent to work 
To make our fate in the parliament


Ignorant before the heavens of my life,
I stand and gaze in wonder. Oh the vastness
of the stars. Their rising and descent. How still.
As if I didn't exist. Do I have any
share in this? Have I somehow dispensed with
their pure effect? Does my blood's ebb and flow
change with their changes? Let me put aside
every desire, every relationship
except this one, so that my heart grows used to
its farthest spaces. Better that it live
fully aware, in the terror of its stars, than
as if protected, soothed by what is near. 

If the world chose to open its eyes, 
What would its reaction be? 
The unsightly things in the world go 
Unnoticed for seeing them would change the image 
Already placed upon it.  
And changing the concrete thoughts 
Would require work and add a new way of examining. 
Two things the world has not practiced or be willing to attempt. 
Instead, the world rotates as if 
Nothing is wrong with blinders on the side and its eyes closed.  
Opening them may cause destruction.  
Destruction for the better. 

I took my eyes off of the clock —
I do not count its boring rhythm! 
Nor do waste my life in its "tick-tack"; 
Life's passing anyway: —I need no rhythm! 

Indisputable change Time brings upon my way. 
I see them everyday around; I see in Nature; 
Nothing is meant to last; nothing to stay: 
It is the course of life, and so, to human nature.

Sometimes I'm not on time, sometimes I'm out of it; 
Relating to annoying measure every time, 
The mind at rest — not even a bit.

Along with it my life in parallel I live: 
Both forward, yet we do not interfere; 
It knows my passage, it knows I grieve —
For it will carry on without me.  

and that's my fear

Have heard this word thou hast said,--Himself, beside
Thee speaking, and me listening ! and replied
So darkly on my eyelids, as to amerce
My sight from seeing thee,--that if I had died,
The deathweights, placed there, would have signified
Less absolute exclusion. 'Nay' is worse
Men could not part us with their worldly jars,
Nor the seas change us, nor the tempests bend;
Our hands would touch for all the mountain-bars:
And, heaven being rolled between us at the end,
We should but vow the faster for the stars. 

The brain, the blood, the busy thews
That quickened in the primal ooze
Support me yet; till ice shall grip
The heart of Earth, no strength they’ll lose.

They take my thought, they laugh, they run—
Ere megatherial moons, begun;
And shall, till they shall drop within
The shattering whirlwinds of the sun.

In subtle and essential ways,
Rich with innumerable days,
To mould, to charge, to impel me still,
Each through my broadest being plays.

They surged to this hour, this transfuse—
The brain, the blood, the busy thews;
That act of mine the ultimate stars
Shall look on sprang in primal ooze. 

Dear! of all happy in the hour, most blest
 He who has found our hid security,
Assured in the dark tides of the world that rest,
 And heard our word, `Who is so safe as we?'
We have found safety with all things undying,
 The winds, and morning, tears of men and mirth,
The deep night, and birds singing, and clouds flying,
 And sleep, and freedom, and the autumnal earth.
We have built a house that is not for Time's throwing.
 We have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever.
War knows no power.  Safe shall be my going,
 Secretly armed against all death's endeavour;
Safe though all safety's lost; safe where men fall;
And if these poor limbs die, safest of all. 

Secreta  Silvarum: Prelude

Oh yon, when Holda leaves her hill 
of winter, on the quest of June, 
black oaks with emerald lamplets thrill 
that flicker forth to her magic tune. 
At dawn the forest shivers whist 
and all the hidden glades awake; 
then sunshine gems the milk-white mist 
and the soft-swaying branches make 
along its edge a woven sound 
of legends that allure and flit 
and horns wound towards the enchanted ground 
where, in the light moon-vapours lit, 
all night, while the black woods in mass, 
serried, forbid with goblin fear, 
fay-revels gleam o'er the pale grass 
till shrill-throats ring the matins near. 
Oh there, oh there in the sweet o' the year, 
adventurous in the witching green, 
last feal of the errant spear, 
to seek the eyes of lost Undine 
clear blue above the blue cold stream 
that lingers till her plaint be done, 
oh, and perchance from that sad dream 
to woo her, laughing, to the sun 
and that glad blue that seems to flow 
far up, where dipping branches lift 
sidelong their soft-throng'd frondage slow 
and slow the thin cloud-fleecelets drift. 
Oh, there to drowse the summer thro' 
deep in some odorous twilit lair, 
swoon'd in delight of golden dew 
within the sylvan witches hair; 
the while on half-veil'd eyes to feel 
the yellow sunshafts broken dim, 
and seldom waftures moth-like steal 
and settle, on the bare-flung limb: 
or under royal autumn, pall'd 
in smouldering magnificence, 
to feel the olden heart enthrall'd 
in wisdoms of forgotten sense, 
and mad desire and pain that fill'd 
red August's heart of throbbing bloom 
in one grave hour of knowledge still'd 
where glory ponders o'er its doom: 
and, when the boughs are sombre lace 
and silence chisels silver rime, 
o'er some old hearth, with dim-lit face, 
to dream the vanish'd forest prime, 
the springtime's sweet and June's delight, 
more precious now that hard winds chill 
the dews that made their mornings bright, 
and Holda sleeps beneath her hill. 

I
What tho' the outer day be brazen rude 
not here the innocence of morn is fled: 
this green unbroken dusk attests it wed 
with freshness, where the shadowy breasts are nude, 
hers guess'd, whose looks, felt dewy-cool, elude — 
save this reproach that smiles on foolish dread: 
wood-word, grave gladness in its heart, unsaid, 
knoweth the guarded name of Quietude. 
Nor start, if satyr-shapes across the path 
tumble; it is but children: lo, the wrath 
couchant, heraldic, of her beasts that pierce 
with ivory single horn whate'er misplaced 
outrageous nears, or whinny of the fierce 
Centaur, or mailed miscreant unchaste. 

II
O friendly shades, where anciently I grew! 
me entering at dawn a child ye knew, 
all little welcoming leaves, and jealous wove 
your roof of lucid emerald above, 
that scarce therethro' the envious sun might stray, 
save smiling dusk or, lure for idle play, 
such glancing finger your chance whim allows, 
all that long forenoon of the tuneful boughs; 
which growing on, the myriad small noise 
and flitting of the wood-life's busy joys, 
thro' tenuous weft of sound, had left, divined, 
the impending threat of silence, clear, behind: 
and, noon now past, that hush descended large 
in the wood's heart, and caught me in its marge 
of luminous foreboding widely flung; 
so hourlong I have stray'd, and tho' among 
the glimpsing lures of all green aisles delays 
that revelation of its wondrous gaze, 
yet am I glad to wander, glad to seek 
and find not, so the gather'd tufts bespeak, 
naked, reclined, its friendly neighbourhood — 
as in this hollow of the rarer wood 
where, listening, in the cool glen-shade, with me, 
white-bloom'd and quiet, stands a single tree; 
rich spilth of gold is on the eastward rise; 
westward the violet gloom eludes mine eyes. 
This is the house of Pan, not whom blind craze 
and babbling wood-wits tell, where bare flints blaze, 
noon-tide terrific with the single shout, 
but whom behind each bole sly-peering out 
the traveller knows, but turning, disappear'd 
with chuckle of laughter in his thicket-beard, 
and rustle of scurrying faun-feet where the ground 
each autumn deeper feels its yellow mound. 
Onward: and lo, at length, the secret glade, 
soft-gleaming grey, what time the grey trunks fade 
in the white vapours o'er its further rim. 
'Tis no more time to linger: now more dim 
the woods are throng'd to ward the haunted spot 
where, as I turn my homeward face, I wot 
the nymphs of twilight have resumed, unheard, 
their glimmering dance upon the glimmering sward. 

III
The point of noon is past, outside: light is asleep; 
brooding upon its perfect hour: the woods are deep 
and solemn, fill'd with unseen presences of light 
that glint, allure, and hide them; ever yet more bright 
(it seems) the turn of a path will show them: nay, but rest; 
seek not, and think not; dream, and know not; this is best: 
the hour is full; be lost: whispering, the woods are bent, 
This is the only revelation; be content. 

IIII
The forest has its horrors, as the sea: 
and ye that enter from the staling lea 
into the early freshness kept around 
the waiting trunks that watch its rarer bound, 
after the glistening song that, sprinkled, leaves 
an innocence upon the glancing leaves; 
O ye that dream to find the morning yet 
secret and chaste, beside her mirror set, 
some glimmering source o'ershadow'd, where the light 
is coolness felt, whom filter'd glints invite 
thro' the slow-shifting green transparency; 
O ye that hearken towards pale mystery 
a rustle of hidden pinions, and obey 
the beckoning of each little leaf asway: 
return, return, or e'er to warn you back 
the shadow bend along your rearward track 
longer and longer from the brooding west; 
return, and evening shall bosom your rest 
in the warm gloom that wraps the blazing hearth: 
there hear from wither'd lips long wean'd of mirth 
the tale that lulls old watches; — How they rode, 
brave-glittering once, where the brave morning glow'd 
along the forest-edges, and were lost 
for ever, where the crossing trunks are most; 
and, far beyond the dim arcades of song, 
where moon-mist weaves a dancing elfin throng, 
and far beyond the luring glades that brood 
around a maiden thought of Quietude, 
the savage realm begins, of lonely dread, 
black branches from the fetid marish bred 
that lurks to trap the loyal careless foot, 
and gaping trunks protrude a snaky root 
o'er slinking paths that centre, where beneath
a sudden rock on the short blasted heath, 
bare-set, a cavern lurks and holds within 
its womb, obscene with some corroding sin, 
coil'd on itself and stirring, a squat shade 
before the entrance rusts a broken blade. 
The forest hides its horrors, as the sea.

V
No emerald spring, no royal autumn-red, 
no glint of morn or sullen vanquish'd day 
might venture against this obscene horror's sway 
blackly from the witch-blasted branches shed. 
No silver bells around the bridle-head 
ripple, and on no quest the pennons play: 
the path's romance is shuddering disarray, 
or eaten by the marsh: the knights are dead. 
The Lady of the Forest was a tale: 
of the white unicorns that round her sleep 
gamboll'd, no turf retains a print; and man, 
rare traveller, feels, athwart the knitted bale 
watching, now lord of loathly deaths that creep, 
maliciously the senile leer of Pan. 
Fire in the heavens, and fire along the hills, 
and fire made solid in the flinty stone, 
thick-mass'd or scatter'd pebble, fire that fills 
the breathless hour that lives in fire alone. 
This valley, long ago the patient bed 
of floods that carv'd its antient amplitude, 
in stillness of the Egyptian crypt outspread, 
endures to drown in noon-days tyrant mood. 
Behind the veil of burning silence bound, 
vast life's innumerous busy littleness 
is hush'd in vague-conjectured blur of sound 
that dulls the brain with slumbrous weight, unless 
some dazzling puncture let the stridence throng 
in the cicada's torture-point of song. 

Peace dwells in blessing o'er a place 
folded within the hills to keep 
and under dark boughs seawind-frayd: 
and the kind slopes where soothings creep, 
in the gold light or the green shade, 
wear evermore the ancient face 
of silence, and the eyes of sleep; 
because they are listening evermore 
unto the seawinds what they tell 
to the wise, nodding, indifferent trees 
high on the ridge that guard the dell, 
of wars on many a far grey shore 
and how the shores decay and fade 
before the obstinate old seas: 
and all their triumphing is made 
a tale that dwindles with the eves, 
while the soft dusk lingers, delay'd, 
and drifts between the indolent leaves. 

A gray and dusty daylight flows 
athwart the shatter'd traceries, 
pale absence of the ruin'd rose. 
Here once, on labour-harden'd knees, 
beneath the kindly vaulted gloom 
that gather'd them in quickening ease, 
they saw the rose of heaven bloom, 
alone, in heights of musky air, 
with many an angel's painted plume. 
So, shadowing forth their dim-felt prayer, 
the daedal glass compell'd to grace 
the outer days indifferent stare, 
where now its disenhallow'd face 
beholds the petal-ribs enclose 
nought, in their web of shatter'd lace, 
save this pale absence of the rose. 

Breaking the desert's tawny level ring 
three columns, an oasis; but no shade 
falls from the curl'd acanthus-leaves; no spring 
bubbles soft laughter for its leaning maid. 
The cell is waste: where once the god abode 
a burning desolation furls its wing: 
enter, and lo! once more, the hopeless road 
world-wide, the tawny desert's level ring. 

Before she pass'd behind the glacier wall 
that hides her white eternal sorceries 
the northern witch, in clinging ermine pall, 
cast one last look along the shallow seas, 
a look that held them in its numbing thrall 
and melted onward to the sandy leas 
where our lorn city lives its lingering fall 
and wistful summer shrinks in scant-clad trees. 
Hence came one greyness over grass and stone: 
the silent-lapping waters fade and tone 
into the air and into them the land; 
and all along our stagnant waterways 
a drown'd and dusky gleaming sleeps, unbann'd, 
the lurking twilight of her vanish'd gaze. 

Out of no quarter of the charted sky 
flung in the bitter wind intolerably, 
abrupt, the trump that sings behind the end 
exults alone. Here grass is none to bend: 
the stony plain blackens with rapid night 
that best reveals the land's inflicted blight 
since in the smitten hero-hand the sword 
broke, and the hope the long-dumb folk adored, 
and over all the north a tragic flare 
told Valhall perish'd and the void's despair 
to dwell as erst, all disinhabited, 
a vault above the heart its hungering led. 
The strident clangour cuts; but space is whole, 
inert, absorb'd in dead regret. Here, sole, 
on the bare uplands, stands, vast thro' the gloom 
staring, to mark an irretrievable doom, 
the stranger stone, sphinx-couchant, thunder-hurl'd 
from red star-ruin o'er the elder world.

This night is not of gentle draperies 
or cluster'd banners where the star-breaths roam, 
nor hangs above the torch a lurching dome 
of purple shade that slips with phantom ease; 
but, on our apathy encroaching, these, 
stable, whose smooth defiance none hath clomb, 
basalt and jade, a patience of the gnome, 
polish'd and shadow-brimm'd transparencies. 
Far, where our oubliette is shut, above, 
we guess the ample lids that never move 
beneath her brows, each massive arch inert 
hung high-contemptuous o'er the blatant wars 
we deem'd well waged for her, who may avert 
some Janus-face that smiles on hidden stars. 

Lightning: and, momently, the silhouette, 
flat on the far horizon, comes and goes 
of that night-haunting city; minaret, 
dome, spire, all sharp while yet the levin glows. 
Day knows it not; whether fierce noon-tide fuse 
earth's rim with sky in throbbing haze, or clear 
gray softness tinge afresh the enamell'd hues 
of mead and stream, it shows no tipping spear. 
Night builds it: now upon the marbled plain 
a blur, discern'd lurking, ever more nigh; 
now close against the walls that hem my reign 
a leaguer-town, threatening my scope of sky. 
So late I saw it; in a misty moon 
it bulk'd, all dusky and transparent, dumb 
as ever, fast in some prodigious swoon: 
its battlements deserted — who might come? 
— ay, one! his eyes, 'neath the high turban's plume, 
watch'd mine, intent, behind the breast-high stone: 
his face drew mine across the milky gloom: 
a sudden moonbeam show'd it me, my own! 

ONE! an iron core, shock'd and dispers'd 
in throbs of sound that ebb across the bay: 
I shudder: the one clang smites disarray 
thro' all my sense, that starts awake, inhears'd 
in the whole lifeless world: and some accurs'd 
where the dead tide lies flat round the green quay, 
hinting what self-fordone despairs it nurs'd. 
The corpse of time is stark upon the night: 
my soul is coffin'd, staring, grave-bedight, 
upon some dance of death that reels and feasts 
around its living tomb, with vampire grin, 
inverted sacraments of Satan's priests — 
and, mask'd no more, the maniac face of sin.

There is a far-off thrill that troubles me: 
a faint thin ripple of shadow, momently, 
dies out across my lucid icy cell. 
I am betrayed by winter to the spell 
of morbid sleep, that somewhere rolls its waves 
insidiously, gather'd from unblest graves, 
to creep above each distant crumbled mole. 
When that assault is full against my soul, 
I must go down, thro' chapels black with mould, 
past ruin'd doors, whose arches, ridged with gold, 
catch, in their grooves, a gloom more blackly dript, 
some stairway winding hours-long towards the crypt 
where panic night lies stricken 'neath the curse 
exuding from the dense enormous hearse 
of some old vampire-god, whose bulk, within, 
lies gross and festering in his shroud of sin. 

Unlike are we, unlike, O princely Heart !
Unlike our uses and our destinies.
Our ministering two angels look surprise
On one another, as they strike athwart
Their wings in passing. Thou, bethink thee, art
With gages from a hundred brighter eyes
Than tears even can make mine, to play thy part
Of chief musician. What hast thou to do
With looking from the lattice-lights at me,
A poor, tired, wandering singer, singing through
The dark, and leaning up a cypress tree ?
The chrism is on thine head,--on mine, the dew,--
And Death must dig the level where these agree. 

Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead!
 There's none of these so lonely and poor of old,
 But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold.
These laid the world away; poured out the red
Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be
 Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene,
 That men call age; and those who would have been,
Their sons, they gave, their immortality.

Blow, bugles, blow!  They brought us, for our dearth,
 Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain.
Honour has come back, as a king, to earth,
 And paid his subjects with a royal wage;
And Nobleness walks in our ways again;
 And we have come into our heritage. 

The tuberose thickens the air: a swoon 
lies close on open'd calyx and slipt sheath 
thro' all the garden bosom-bound beneath 
dense night that hangs, her own perturbing moon: 
no star: and heaven and earth, seeking their boon, 
meet in this troubled blood whereunder seethe 
cravings of darkling bliss whose fumes enwreathe 
some rose of rare-reveal'd delight: oh, soon! — 
Ay, surely near — the hour consents to bless! — 
and nearer yet, all ways of night converge 
in that delicious dark between her breasts 
whom night and bloom and wayward blood confess, 
where all the world's desire is wild to merge 
its multitude of single suffering nests. 

Cloth'd now with dark alone, O rose and balm, 
whence unto world-sear'd youth is healing boon, 
what lures the tense dark round thy pulsing calm? 
Or does that flood-tide of luxurious noon, 
richly distill'd for thy sweet nutriment, 
now traitor, hearken to some secret moon. 
Eve's wifely guise, her dower that Eden lent, 
now limbeck where the enamour'd alchemist 
invokes the rarer rose, phantom descent; 
thy dewy essence where the suns persist 
is alter'd by occult yet natural rite: 
among thy leaves it was the night we kiss'd. 
Rare ooze of odour drowns our faint delight, 
some spilth of love that languishes unshared, 
a rose that bleeds unseen, the heart of night; 
whose sweetness holds us, wondering, ensnared: 
for cunning she, the outcast, to entice 
to wake with her, remembering how she fared 
in times before our time, when Paradise 
shone once, the dew-gem in her heart, and base 
betrayal gave her to the malefice 
that all thro' time afflicts her lonely face, 
and all the mournful widowhood of night 
closed round her, and the wilderness of space: 
O bleeding rose, alone! O heart of night! 

This is of Lilith, by her Hebrew name 
Lady of Night: she, in the delicate frame 
that was of woman after, did unite 
herself with Adam in unblest delight; 
who, uncapacious of that dreadful love, 
begat on her not majesty, as Jove, 
but the worm-brood of terrors unconfest 
that chose henceforth, as their avoided nest, 
the mire-fed writhen thicket of the mind. 
She, monsterward from that embrace declined, 
could change her to Chimera and inspire 
doubt of his garden-state, exciting higher 
the arrowy impulse to dim descried 
o'erhuman bliss, as after, on the wide 
way of his travail, with enticing strain 
and hint of nameless things reveal'd, a bane 
haunted, the fabled siren, and was seen 
later as Lamia and Melusine, 
and whatsoe'er of serpent-wives is feign'd, 
or malice of the vampire-witch that drain'd 
fresh blood of fresh-born babes, a wicked blast: 
faces of fear, beheld along the past 
and in the folk's scant fireside lore misread, 
of her that is the august and only dread, 
close-dwelling, in the house of birth and death, 
and closer, in the secrets of our breath - 
or love occult, whose smile eludes our sight 
in her flung hair that is the starry night


Down through the tomb's inward arch
He has shouldered out into Limbo
to gather them, dazed, from dreamless slumber:
the merciful dead, the prophets,
the innocents just His own age and those
unnumbered others waiting here
unaware, in an endless void He is ending
now, stooping to tug at their hands,
to pull them from their sarcophagi,
dazzled, almost unwilling. Didmas,
neighbor in death, Golgotha dust
still streaked on the dried sweat of his body
no one had washed and anointed, is here,
for sequence is not known in Limbo;
the promise, given from cross to cross
at noon, arches beyond sunset and dawn.
All these He will swiftly lead
to the Paradise road: they are safe.
That done, there must take place that struggle
no human presumes to picture:
living, dying, descending to rescue the just
from shadow, were lesser travails
than this: to break
through earth and stone of the faithless world
back to the cold sepulchre, tearstained
stifling shroud; to break from 
them
back into breath and heartbeat, and walk
the world again, closed into days and weeks again,
wounds of His anguish open, and Spirit
streaming through every cell of flesh
so that if mortal sight could bear
to perceive it, it would be seen
His mortal flesh was lit from within, now,
and aching for home. He must return,
first, in Divine patience, and know
hunger again, and give
to humble friends the joy
of giving Him food--fish and a honeycomb. 

To wave as to billow
Across water, fire and land

Whirl in one's hand
With caresses sweet
Like a dancer smooth
Whirling and curving
To feed one's blood to whoosh

Like a spring of butterflies
Rising with the glory
And joy of gold from the horizon


It was in her white skirts that he loved to see
her run straight through the branches and leaves, gracefully,
but still gauche, and hiding her leg from the light,
when she tore her dress, on the briars, in her flight. 



The brood of Folly without father bred!
How little you bested
.  .   

Or fill the fixed mind with all your toys!
Dwell in some idle brain,
.  .   

And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess,
As thick and numberless
.  .   

As the gay motes that people the sun-beams,
Or likest hovering dreams,
.  .   

The fickle pensioners of Morpheus' train.
Hail, divinest Melancholy!
Whose saintly visage is too bright
To hit the sense of human sight,
And therefore to our weaker view
O'erlaid with black, staid Wisdom's hue;
Black, but such as in esteem
Prince Memnon's sister might beseem,
To set her beauty's praise above
The Sea-Nymphs, and their powers offended.
Yet thou art higher far descended:
Thee bright-haired Vesta long of yore
To solitary Saturn bore;
His daughter she; in Saturn's reign
Such mixture was not held a stain.
Oft in glimmering bowers and glades
He met her, and in secret shades
Of woody Ida's inmost grove,
Whilst yet there was no fear of Jove.
Come, pensive Nun, devout and pure,
Sober, steadfast, and demure,
All in a robe of darkest grain,
Flowing with majestic train,
And sable stole of cypress lawn
Over thy decent shoulders drawn.
Come; but keep thy wonted state,
With even step, and musing gait,
And looks commercing with the skies,
Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes:
There, held in holy passion still,
Forget thyself to marble, till
With a sad leaden downward cast
Thou fix them on the earth as fast.
And join with thee calm Peace and Quiet,
Spare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet,
And hears the Muses in a ring
Aye round about Jove's altar sing;
And add to these retired Leisure,
That in trim gardens takes his pleasure;
But, first and chiefest, with thee bring
Him that yon soars on golden wing,
Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne,
The Cherub Contemplation;
And the mute Silence hist along,
'Less Philomel will deign a song,
In her sweetest saddest plight,
Smoothing the rugged brow of Night,
While Cynthia checks her dragon yoke
Gently o'er the accustomed oak.
Sweet bird, that shunn'st the noise of folly,
Most musical, most melancholy!
Thee, chauntress, oft the woods among
I woo, to hear thy even-song;
And, missing thee,I walk unseen
On the dry smooth-shaven green,
To behold the wandering moon,
Riding near her highest noon,
Like one that had been led astray
Through the heaven's wide pathless way,
And oft, as if her head she bowed,
Stooping through a fleecy cloud.
Oft, on a plat of rising ground,
I hear the far-off curfew sound,
Over some wide-watered shore,
Swinging slow with sullen roar;
Or, if the air will not permit,
Some still removed place will fit,
Where glowing embers through the room
Teach light to counterfeit a gloom,
Far from all resort of mirth,
Save the cricket on the hearth,
Or the bellman's drowsy charm
To bless the doors from nightly harm.
Or let my lamp, at midnight hour,
Be seen in some high lonely tower,
Where I may oft outwatch the Bear,
With thrice great Hermes, or unsphere
The spirit of Plato, to unfold
What worlds or what vast regions hold
The immortal mind that hath forsook
Her mansion in this fleshly nook;
And of those demons that are found
In fire, air, flood, or underground,
Whose power hath a true consent
With planet or with element.
Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy
In sceptred pall come sweeping by,
Presenting Thebes, or Pelops' line,
Or the tale of Troy divine,
Or what (though rare) of later age
Ennobled hath the buskined stage.
But, O sad Virgin! that thy power
Might raise Musaeus from his bower;
Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing
Such notes as, warbled to the string,
Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek,
And made Hell grant what love did seek;
Or call up him that left half-told
The story of Cambuscan bold,
Of Camball, and of Algarsife,
And who had Canace to wife,
That owned the virtuous ring and glass,
And of the wondrous horse of brass
On which the Tartar king did ride;
And if aught else great bards beside
In sage and solemn tunes have sung,
Of turneys, and of trophies hung,
Of forests, and enchantments drear,
Where more is meant than meets the ear.
Thus, Night, oft see me in thy pale career,
Till civil-suited Morn appear,
Not tricked and frounced, as she was wont
With the Attic boy to hunt,
But kerchieft in a comely cloud
While rocking winds are piping loud,
Or ushered with a shower still,
When the gust hath blown his fill,
Ending on the rustling leaves,
With minute-drops from off the eaves.
And, when the sun begins to fling
To arched walks of twilight groves,
And shadows brown, that Sylvan loves,
Of pine, or monumental oak,
Where the rude axe with heaved stroke
Was never heard the nymphs to daunt,
Or fright them from their hallowed haunt.
There, in close covert, by some brook,
Where no profaner eye may look,
Hide me from day's garish eye,
While the bee with honeyed thigh,
That at her flowery work doth sing,
And the waters murmuring,
With such consort as they keep,
Entice the dewy-feathered Sleep.
And let some strange mysterious dream
Wave at his wings, in airy stream
Of lively portraiture displayed,
Softly on my eyelids laid;
And, as I wake, sweet music breathe
Above, about, or underneath,
Sent by some Spirit to mortals good,
Or the unseen Genius of the wood.
But let my due feet never fail
To walk the studious cloister's pale,
And love the high embowed roof,
With antique pillars massy proof,
And storied windows richly dight,
Casting a dim religious light.
There let the pealing organ blow,
To the full-voiced quire below,
In service high and anthems clear,
As may with sweetness, through mine ear,
Dissolve me into ecstasies,
And bring all Heaven before mine eyes.
And may at last my weary age
Find out the peaceful hermitage,
The hairy gown and mossy cell,
Where I may sit and rightly spell
Of every star that heaven doth shew,
And every herb that sips the dew,
Till old experience do attain
To something like prophetic strain.
These pleasures, Melancholy, give;
And I with thee will choose to live. 




THERE is an end of joy and sorrow;
Peace all day long, all night, all morrow,
But never a time to laugh or weep.
The end is come of pleasant places,
The end of tender words and faces,
The end of all, the poppied sleep.

No place for sound within their hearing,
No room to hope, no time for fearing,
No lips to laugh, no lids for tears.
The old years have run out all their measure;
No chance of pain, no chance of pleasure,
No fragment of the broken years.

Outside of all the worlds and ages,
There where the fool is as the sage is,
There where the slayer is clean of blood,
No end, no passage, no beginning,
There where the sinner leaves off sinning,
There where the good man is not good.

There is not one thing with another,
But Evil saith to Good: My brother,
My brother, I am one with thee:
They shall not strive nor cry for ever:
No man shall choose between them: never
Shall this thing end and that thing be.

Wind wherein seas and stars are shaken
Shall shake them, and they shall not waken;
None that has lain down shall arise;
The stones are sealed across their places;
One shadow is shed on all their faces,
One blindness cast on all their eyes.

Sleep, is it sleep perchance that covers
Each face, as each face were his lover’s?
Farewell; as men that sleep fare well.
The grave’s mouth laughs unto derision
Desire and dread and dream and vision,
Delight of heaven and sorrow of hell.

No soul shall tell nor lip shall number
The names and tribes of you that slumber;
No memory, no memorial.
"Thou knowest"—who shall say thou knowest?
There is none highest and none lowest:
An end, an end, an end of all.

Good night, good sleep, good rest from sorrow
To these that shall not have good morrow;
The gods be gentle to all these.
Nay, if death be not, how shall they be?
Nay, is there help in heaven? it may be
All things and lords of things shall cease.

The stooped urn, filling, dips and flashes;
The bronzed brims are deep in ashes;
The pale old lips of death are fed.
Shall this dust gather flesh hereafter?
Shall one shed tears or fall to laughter,
At sight of all these poor old dead?

Nay, as thou wilt; these know not of it;
Thine eyes’ strong weeping shall not profit,
Thy laughter shall not give thee ease;
Cry aloud, spare not, cease not crying,
Sigh, till thou cleave thy sides with sighing,
Thou shalt not raise up one of these.

Burnt spices flash, and burnt wine hisses,
The breathing flame’s mouth curls and kisses
The small dried rows of frankincense;
All round the sad red blossoms smoulder,
Flowers coloured like the fire, but colder,
In sign of sweet things taken hence;

Yea, for their sake and in death’s favour
Things of sweet shape and of sweet savour
We yield them, spice and flower and wine;
Yea, costlier things than wine or spices,
Whereof none knoweth how great the price is,
And fruit that comes not of the vine.

From boy’s pierced throat and girl’s pierced bosom
Drips, reddening round the blood-red blossom,
The slow delicious bright soft blood,
Bathing the spices and the pyre,
Bathing the flowers and fallen fire,
Bathing the blossom by the bud.

Roses whose lips the flame has deadened
Drink till the lapping leaves are reddened
And warm wet inner petals weep;
The flower whereof sick sleep gets leisure,
Barren of balm and purple pleasure,
Fumes with no native steam of sleep.

Why will ye weep? what do ye weeping?
For waking folk and people sleeping,
And sands that fill and sands that fall,
The days rose-red, the poppied hours,
Blood, wine, and spice and fire and flowers,
There is one end of one and all.

Shall such an one lend love or borrow?
Shall these be sorry for thy sorrow?
Shall these give thanks for words or breath?
Their hate is as their loving-kindness;
The frontlet of their brows is blindness,
The armlet of their arms is death.

Lo, for no noise or light of thunder
Shall these grave-clothes be rent in sunder;
He that hath taken, shall he give?
He hath rent them: shall he bind together?
He hath bound them: shall he break the tether?
He hath slain them: shall he bid them live?

A little sorrow, a little pleasure,
Fate metes us from the dusty measure
That holds the date of all of us;
We are born with travail and strong crying,
And from the birth-day to the dying
The likeness of our life is thus.

One girds himself to serve another,
Whose father was the dust, whose mother
The little dead red worm therein;
They find no fruit of things they cherish;
The goodness of a man shall perish,
It shall be one thing with his sin.

In deep wet ways by grey old gardens
Fed with sharp spring the sweet fruit hardens;
They know not what fruits wane or grow;
Red summer burns to the utmost ember;
They know not, neither can remember,
The old years and flowers they used to know.

Ah, for their sakes, so trapped and taken,
For theirs, forgotten and forsaken,
Watch, sleep not, gird thyself with prayer.
Nay, where the heart of wrath is broken,
Where long love ends as a thing spoken,
How shall thy crying enter there?

Though the iron sides of the old world falter,
The likeness of them shall not alter
For all the rumour of periods,
The stars and seasons that come after,
The tears of latter men, the laughter
Of the old unalterable gods.

Far up above the years and nations,
The high gods, clothed and crowned with patience,
Endure through days of deathlike date;
They bear the witness of things hidden;
Before their eyes all life stands chidden,
As they before the eyes of Fate.

Not for their love shall Fate retire,
Nor they relent for our desire,
Nor the graves open for their call.
The end is more than joy and anguish,
Than lives that laugh and lives that languish,
The poppied sleep, the end of all. 

If you can be convinced to accept absurdities
You can be convinced to commit atrocities
If you're waiting for something better to come
You will waste all the time you have now
If you are convinced you hold the moral high
You will more easily and severely judge
If you worship anything with reckless zeal
You have given up your dignity and humanity
If you also fear most, the one you love most
You have misplaced your devotion


Ill or well, whatever befalls, 
let it come. 
My ears will not hear, 
My eyes will not see. 
When the Voice calls from within 
the inmost mind, 
The lamp of faith burns steady and bright 
even in the wind. 

To bear a weight that cannot be borne, 
Sisyphus, even you aren't that strong, 
Although your heart cannot be torn 
Time is short and Art is long. 
Far from celebrated sepulchers 
Toward a solitary graveyard 
My heart, like a drum muffled hard 
Beats a funeral march for the ill-starred. 

—Many jewels are buried or shrouded 
In darkness and oblivion's clouds, 
Far from any pick or drill bit, 

Many a flower unburdens with regret 
Its perfume sweet like a secret; 
In profoundly empty solitude to sit. 






Guire


The first son is captivated by a virgin princess, and his father tells him the adventures of a beautiful and virtuous woman who attracts several men but miraculously survives their abuse and then forgives them. They acknowledge that carnal desire is necessary to propagate the race but also recognize that passionate love can lead to spiritual love, which can annihilate the soul in the beloved. 
Other stories indicate the importance of respecting the lives of other creatures such as ants or dogs. One only thinks oneself better than a dog because of one's dog-like nature. 



The fourth son seeks the water of life, and his father warns him against desire. A wise man considers Alexander the Great the slave of his slave, because the Greek conqueror has submitted to greed and desire, which this wise man controls. If the son cannot have the water of life, he asks for the knowledge that will illuminate his heart. In one story 'Attar concluded that if you are not faithful in love, you are in love only with yourself. The fifth son asks for the ring of Solomon that enables one to communicate with birds and other animals. The Way is summarized as seeing the true road, traveling light, and doing no harm. The father tells this son that he has chosen an earthly kingdom, because he has not heard of the kingdom of the next world. He advises this king that since his sovereignty will not endure not to load the whole world on his shoulders. Why take on the burden of all creation? The caliph suggests that his son practice contentment, which is an eternal kingdom that overshadows even the Sun. When Joseph was thrown into a pit, the angel Gabriel counseled him that it is better to notice a single blemish in yourself than to see a hundred lights of the Unseen. 


For many a year, 
It never existed, 
It was never built, 
And was never visited, 
Now since the cover has been blown, 
Why won't the government tell us what it has flown. 

Out in Nevada, 
In the desert, 
The aliens landed, 
The locals went beserk. 

The craft that landed, 
The government flew, 
Retrofitted the equipment, 
And put in a new drive too. 

Now, is the government, 
Trying to hide, 
All of the stuff that is taking place inside. 

What is this some kind of government mistake, 
All of the stuff that took place at Groom Lake

A Honduran man left his kids and wife
To give them all a better life
Of no more hunger, no more thirst
No more waiting on misery to spread worse
On an wheeler, he sneaks a ride
For days on in he hopes and hides
Riding through America, land of the free
Turned out nothing like it seemed to be
For when he ran off after the truck stopped today
He found himself as a hopeless stray
He can’t get a job since he has an illegal name
And he won’t accept food since he’s so ashamed
The government, they won’t take him back
They say it’s too much money for them to stack
So, what of this man do you blame him at all? 
The courage he held as he tried to stand tall
What would you have done to stop your families cries? 
How far would you have went to stop hunger in your children’s eyes? 
Would you go to the next country or two
To try and find something there for you
We have to look at him with our eyes and tears
And tell him we can’t help him here
Around the corner, he disappears
Why can’t we help him here? 
A Honduran man left his kids and wife
To give them all a better life-How does a proton know when to decay
Or a photon know when it's being spied
Entangled electrons, light years apart
Dark matter tell just where to hide
The cosmos of the vastly large and small
Obeying laws, or just doing their thing
We may never have all of the answers
But I will seize all that science can bring


If you listen to the song
If you watch the video
And you are years old
Feel the urge to have sex
Then it’s Illuminati.

If you worship Beyonce
If you worship Jay Z
You can never serve two kings
Then it’s Illuminati.

If you see them on television
If you read about them on the net
Like on their worthless dirty lyrics
Then it’s Illuminati.

If you fill their concerts every night
If you follow their tours everywhere
And not fill the house of the Almighty
In honor and praise as one Church
Then it’s Illuminati.

If you feel like you do not care morally
If you do not know the difference
Between the right and the wrong act
One example being naked on the internet
Then it’s Illuminati. 

Illuminati breaks the law.


***The Book Of End Of Times


One must be brilliant
To appreciate brilliance
Extorting bright light


I walked past a friend today.
I ignored her as effectively as if she weren't there.
Was she? 
Might I have imagined it, 
Hoping inside for a glimpse of a familiar face? 
Or
-Could it be? -
She was there, and I was not, 
But only, rather, dreaming

Slowly, 
I can feel your lips on me
Slowly, 
I can hear you whisper my name
To my ears

Ooh, I can see you and me
Swaying under these moonlit trees
At night
And as long as I hear you say
Those words that I long to hear

Suddenly. 
Suddenly.  


You are just like a blur to me.


(Instrumental) 

Someday, 
How I long to see you
Back to me
And someday, 
How I long to hear you say
Those words to me

Now, as I opened my eyes to see
Me catching this one last tear ooh 
And as I slowly watch your silhouette
Faded right through the night

Finally.  
Finally. 

Now I'm back into reality

But now, 
You are just.  
You are just a blur. 
To me. 

To weave about an eye
A dream
Forged in a sigh

To twine about a name
A hope
Stretched from the brain 

Is innocent relief
As long as you never
Speak about it

But I did
Oh I did


Blossoming far on faint horizon, 
Hope in its fake material realm, 
In the thoughts hidden dimension, 
Of virtual imagery macrocosm; 

Deceptive celluloid human face, 
Pretending unnatural spiritual farce, 
Fake friendship tempting to be true, 
Covering with veil of values scarce; 

Living Life in reckless haste, 
On a shadowy grinding stone, 
With apparent hopes, fluid as paste, 
Under influence of wasteful clone; 

Truth mundane is absolute apparent, 
Believing unpretentiously sacrosanct, 
Searching deep with spiritual penance, 
Finding void in flesh and skeleton tenant; 

Hypocritical opportunity thunder, 
Pouring in life’s chance showers, 
Decorating the delicate soul under, 
With a fictitious Rainbow cover; 

Resigning to devout faith and trust.
Following essence of divine light, 
To lead virtuous life without waste, 
Under metaphysical life’s pseudo twist;What is seen is not the Truth 
What is cannot be said 
Trust comes not without seeing 
Nor understanding without  words 
The wise comprehends with knowledge 
To the ignorant it is but a wonder 
Some worship His various forms 
In what way He is beyond these attributes 
Only the Knower knows 
That music cannot be written 
How can then be the notes 
Says Kabir,  awareness alone will overcome illusion


Beauty is what by clarity of vision
more we learn greater we know truth
as we read history as mirrored by facts
yet time seems  paradox in hand by realty
.
yet rain is indebted to clouds 
mystery dissipates by illusion 
reason never defies riffs of truth 
i am as i am by commiseration

ocean is beyond reach of moon 
horizon befuddles in silhouettes
tide and ebb reason to reason 
all earthly riffle by rise and fall

love of Florence ramifies by colors
do we ever judge our own strength? 
every bits of raves up redounds
rainbow rills on illusion by extermination


Curled 'round my memory
.  

with your clever trickery
Raw emotions bleed out the same. 
Sorrows of yesterdays fairwells
Mere casualties of illusionist blame. 

Your Top Hat magic. 
Rabbit with a Black Wand. 
Disappearing into the dusk. 
N'er returning with the Dawn

When you feel lost for "no belonging", 
In waves of sadness weeps your heart; 
In silent patience you are longing; 
Somewhere, in comfort, anew to start.

For less alone when not alone, you feel: 
To soul, —a mirror to reflect; 
And share and giving—part of deal; 
Your lonely nature to forget.

We come alone, and we leave alone, 
And in between, other lonely souls; 
In transient time we mingle—less alone, 
For in the end, to close the door.

And then, nostalgically you reminisce
About times you thought that you belong; 
But Fate plays its game of malice, 
And sole each one, and "no belong". 

The Rav
of Northern White Russia declined,
in his youth, to learn the
language of birds, because
the extraneous did not interest him; nevertheless
when he grew old it was found
he understood them anyway, having
listened well, and as it is said, 'prayed
          with the bench and the floor.' He used
what was at hand--as did
Angel Jones of Mold, whose meditations
were sewn into coats and britches.
          Well, I would like to make,
thinking some line still taut between me and them,
poems direct as what the birds said,
hard as a floor, sound as a bench,
mysterious as the silence when the tailor
would pause with his needle in the air. 

One night as I sat beneath the tree.
I looked up in to the open sky & hoped he'd answer me.
Please light the way and lead me back home.

I told him of my burdens.
And of the everlasting sadness in my hart.
That from his lost love I never felt so apart.
I just can not comprehend why.
No longer can I touch his face or hold his hand.
His loving smile has gone.

I'm missing him like mad.
I am drowning in my griefe and sorrow.
Please help to heal my griefe.
It was then that I head his gentle voice.
And felt his presence near.
How I longed for him to stay.
As I cried another tear.

He said I'm an angel now.
My spirit is free.
I'm an angel in heaven.
So please don't cry for me.
I was choosen by our lord above and now I am in his care.
When you need me look inside your hart.
I promise to be there.
I am an angel now.
And no longer roam.

So if you can not find your way.
Or the road home seems to far.
Look to the sky I'll be your guiding star.
He saisd Im an angel now.
My spirit is free.
Im an angel in heaven now.
No need to cry for me. 

Please don't grive for me for now I am free.
I am only following the path god had laid for me.
I took his hand as I heard him call.
I turned with one last glance.
I turned my back on it all and left it all behind.

I could not stay another day.
To laugh run or play.
I couldnt solve my pain.
There was nothing I could do to change past events.
Tasks left undone must stay that way.
I've found my place at the close of day.

If my passing leaves a void, 
then fill it with remembered joy.
For the crap I left behind I will not miss.

Prehaps my time seemed to short.
Dont lengthen it now with undue griefe.
Be not burdened In times of sorrow.
I wish you all love.
I wish you all well. 

I'm not sorry for the things I said
when I was hurting deep inside.
They were things I had to say, and
things I could no longer hide.

I get called spoiled and
also a brat
If people knew the real me
they would not say that.

I cry deep inside everyday.
Every night.
The only thing I wish is that
everything was right.

Nothing seems right.
Nothing seems fair.
It's harder for me cause
I have no one there.

No one to guide me or
help me at all.
I feel claustrophobic.
My world seems so small.

I gotta get out and try
being by myself.
If I don't there'll be
nothing left.

I hope for the best and
pray at night.
That one day everything
will be alright.

However long it takes
I'll be right here.
I won't say 'I'm sorry'
and I won't cry a tear. 

you took a needle & thread
and stitched up my wounded, battered heart.

you stayed.
im saved.

you said you wouldn't leave 
with you here, i believe.

i trust you, 
take this token of love
i call it my heart.

Do as you please, 
but when you no longer want it, 
burry it t under.

my heart will no longer function. 

Young men riding in the street
In the bright new season
Spur without reason
Causing their steeds to leap.

And at the pace they keep
Their horses' armoured feet
Strike sparks from the cobbled street
In the bright new season. 

The tremulously mirrored clouds lie deep,
Enchanted towers bosomed in the stream,
And blossomed coronals of white-thorn gleam
Within the water where the willows sleep—
Still-imaged willow-leaves whose shadows steep
The far-reflected sky in dark of dream;
And glimpsed therein the sun-winged swallows seem
As fleeting memories to those who weep.

So mirrored in thy heart are all desires,
Eternal longings, Youth's inheritance,
All hopes that token immortality,
All griefs whereto immortal grief aspires.
Aweary of the world's reality,
I dream above the imaged pool, Romance. 

I

Like a gondola of green scented fruits 
Drifting along the dark canals of Venice, 
You, O exquisite one, 
Have entered into my desolate city. 

II

The blue smoke leaps 
Like swirling clouds of birds vanishing. 
So my love leaps forth toward you, 
Vanishes and is renewed. 

III

A rose-yellow moon in a pale sky 
When the sunset is faint vermilion 
In the mist among the tree-boughs 
Art thou to me, my beloved. 

IV

A young beech tree on the edge of the forest 
Stands still in the evening, 
Yet shudders through all its leaves in the light air 
And seems to fear the stars -
So are you still and so tremble. 

V

The red deer are high on the mountain, 
They are beyond the last pine trees. 
And my desires have run with them. 

VI

The flower which the wind has shaken 
Is soon filled again with rain; 
So does my heart fill slowly with tears,O Foam-Driver, Wind-of-the-Vineyards, 
Until you return. 

I have an image in my head, 
It's of my mother 
in an old pinny, 
her hard, broad hands
that were soft and plump on the palm, 
with cigarette yellow
at the fingertips.

I have this image in my head 
It's of her with a washing board, 
sighing, tired 
and me, small and tubby, 
taking mini steps 
towards the wringer, 
'can I do it mummy, can I do it'

I have this image in my head
of her face, all lit up, 
her excitement
at her first ‘twin tub' 
and my heart aches for her.
I see her poor, over worked body, 
her anguished face and I cry for her.

I have this image in my head
and it never fades.
I wish she'd had a better life, 
taken more care of herself.
She had this matter of fact attitude, 
resololute, never to give in
and at the end, when all was done
there was nothing left but pain. 

Images too powerful for words, 
Piercing like a Sword—
Deeply searing the mind.
For, they yet cater
These many years later, 
Thus, I would find.

The gallery I would scroll
Displayed such haunting role
Of poverty unkind.
The message—stark and keen! 
Ne'er such images have I seen, 
Nor dare I rewind.

If e'er one felt poor, 
Are impoverished—unrefined: 
Gaunt were Mother and her lad.
Gaunt were daughter and her dad.
Gaunt were asses, sheep and kine. 

silky black legs shimmer
as she stands
he beckons the waiter

ebony black Cornish Rex
sits on the newspaper
her back to you

velvet black sky reveals
a pale thin moon
jealous the stars stare

ugly black despair
tortures his soul
empty without her


I caught a glimpse, an image, that has settled in my mind
My shape from this side angle, was a shock, and quite unkind
I never thought that such a sight would fill me with dismay
Whoever thought, at  that I would look this way? 

How could I store such fat reserves, that make me look unique, 
I’ve become a couch potato, and lost all my young physique
I’d make a welcome mannequin, for Big & Tall & Fat
I never thought, at  that I would look like that.

I’ve ripples running around my frame, that wobble when I walk, 
My feet are swollen from the strain, and my navel almost talks, 
It moves as if it hasn’t got another place to go, 
And like the tide, my belly has a daily ebb and flow.

So maybe I will move all mirrors to our cellar floor
So that I miss these images, when I walk through a door, 
It really is uncomfortable, when I see my reflection, 
I never thought, at  I would lose my complexion


I sleep as I imagine horses do
Galloping through my dreams at breakneck speed
And when I reached the finish line I knew
I was a thoroughbred and champion steed

I sleep as I imagine greyhounds would
Dreaming of that hare that leads the race
My heart is pulsing, raging streams of blood
As I race around with others at some pace

I’d like to sleep just like a three toed sloth
Almost motionless and with no cares
Until I wake from sleep, I can’t be both
A greyhound or a horse, but then, who Cares

The imaginary power takes over the world, and the people in it.
Making minute things important, and important things unnecessary.
And so the world turns.

The imaginary status places and artificial happiness over the world, and the people in it.
Creating avoidable conflicts to arise at new magnitudes.
And so the world turns.

The imaginary wealth controls the world, and the people in it.
Presenting new desirable ideas to replace the already insufficient ones.
And so the world turns.

The imaginary need drives selfishness in the world, and the people in it.
Allowing happiness, fear, and lust to lead their lives.
And so the world turns.

This world is unfortunately not imaginary, 
Going day to day with imaginary things at the center of the lives of all.
Soon the world will no longer turn. 

Huge granite monument, wayside
Tells the story, high and loud
Passersby to read ‘n mesmerize  
Until sun and moon decide.  

enough! 

Upholding the might of her breast feed
Eleven offspring rising to blue 
Treading on her yielding body
How they clamored loud for more

Emancipated physique of her
Getting separated in to bones
How elements stood for rituals
Of a woman, buried by government


There is a dish to hold the sea, 
A brazier to contain the sun, 
A compass for the galaxy, 
A voice to wake the dead and done! 

That minister of ministers, 
Imagination, gathers up 
The undiscovered Universe, 
Like jewels in a jasper cup. 

Its flame can mingle north and south; 
Its accent with the thunder strive; 
The ruddy sentence of its mouth 
Can make the ancient dead alive. 

The mart of power, the fount of will, 
The form and mould of every star, 
The source and bound of good and ill, 
The key of all the things that are, 

Imagination, new and strange 
In every age, can turn the year; 
Can shift the poles and lightly change 
The mood of men, the world's career. 

Fields of imagination with nothing to write but biographical one-liners that don’t make good reading.
Good poetry is all about the imagination, but how to open that door without revealing ones life story? 
Jumping through meadows of hay trying to find a gate to the other side, where the grass is always greener.
The caterpillar that turns into a butterfly, no more or less beautiful when you look at life, and the world doesn’t always appear less harsh through someone else’s eyes.

Days, months- a year, without rain where fields of life so easily turn to fields of death, 
caught up in a wishing well of cholera inducing death.

Russia and America circle each other, the wrong words at the wrong moment said with no one intent but interpreted as something completely different, the difference between wishing someone were gone and wishing they were dead- one mind, a world of people, one button.

Who can honestly assess great writing from bad? Was Shakespeare truly great? William Blake- disillusioned and driven insane by his own imagination, or a prophet? 

Dancing with disaster dancing with death not accepting that you love every minuet of its fatal kiss. Twisting and turning, coming back for more, a score unsettled, who could want more

Every imagination has its sanctity
it does exist, it can be possible
somewhere, at some place in creation
that so we can imagine or else
we can never imagine
that does not exist in creation.

So, imagine!  imagine !  imagine! 

Your imagination may bring
 a lot to this world and creation


I never imagined this new situation
I thought I had seen everything through all my years
I have often seen things that bore little relation
To the things I have witnessed through buckets of tears

How do we control, when the world is in turmoil? 
What do we accomplish, by just standing by? 
Unless we make sense of what makes our blood boil
We solve very little, and we then wonder why


I used to play at Pirates, 

And sailed the seven seas.

Then I was a cowboy, 

These simple things did me please.

 

I had a vivid imagination, 

Adventure was always on my mind.

I discovered the joys of reading, 

And escaped the daily grind.

 

Once I lived with the Eskimos, 

In the land of ice and snow, 

Went hunting and a fishing, 

My fantasy was all aglow.

 

I read a book of Jules Verne, 

And went off to the moon, 

It was just to take a look, 

Then it was time to return.

 

I spent time in the forests of Africa, 

With Dr. Livingstone as my guide, 

Then off again to America, 

With Huckleberry Finn I did hide.

 

In my world of fantasy and imagination, 

I performed such wonderful deeds.

A Hero of all the Nations, 

I was the one that did succeed.

 

Then I grew up my childish world at an end.

I had become serious it nearly drove me around the bend.

I still do like the mysterious, 

This is the message I am trying to send. 

A gaunt and hoary slab of stone
     I found in desert place,
And wondered why it lay alone
     In that abandoned place.
Said I: 'Maybe a Palace stood
     Where now the lizards crawl,
With courts of musky quietude
               And turrets tall.

Maybe where low the vultures wing
     'Mid mosque and minaret,
The proud pavilion of a King
     Was luminously set.
'Mid fairy fountains, alcoves dim,
     Upon a garnet throne
He ruled,--and now all trace of him
               Is just this stone.

Ah well, I've done with wandering,
     But from a blousy bar
I see with drunk imagining
     A Palace like a star.
I build it up from one grey stone
     With gardens hanging high,
And dream . . . Long, long ere Babylon
               It's King was I. 

I don't know what
you are, 
yet you have stretched
my mind.

I think of you 
every day
labouring in the fine silt
of memory, 
digging for an excuse
or reason
that was our demise, 
the imaginary status
I can't conceal.

Actually we are one
compatable movement, 
each, the others twin, 
joined by thought. 
as it ought to be. 

Imagination
it is a contemplation
place where food turns thought


beyond the coast of what is seen
in dreams, in the rustle of pages
in the green of a shadow on

a greener wall, being small
caught in the rain
distracted from pain

have you really witnessed
so many snows as this
you wonder to yourself in bliss

crystaled in the cold or blown
from the petaling trees of april magnified
magnifying a white white glory

have you really existed under the stars

you could not see in the city lights
or borne the flights of others on
your back or tracked beauty itself

have you really can you really
look back on so much gold squandered
and still there is more

the coinage of days

imagination's stored it up for you
in silos of the night
not ill met by moonlight, Titania

not ill met.
with my small border of roses, lilies
flowerets crowned and remembered, yet.

to morrow you experiment
day after to-morrow
you develop
one day your imagination
will come true, this  is the
true aspects


Imagine . 
the whole universe
cupped in a hand, 
sparkling and clear.
It is bright
in the night of the mind, 
pregnant and gently expanding.
Infinite.

Thought explodes.

The devils root
rose from the earth
laughing clouds
of sounds
made from the sky crying
red and silver, 
mixing the light
of day and night
in storms of stars
and spinning moons, 
with the sun burning
in its own heat
and the universe
coolly looking on
at its own destruction, 
then blaming the unknown..



Imagine how 

Long was the night 

And it broke into a day 
Loaded with shadows — As deep 
As open wounds 
Under the rhythmic shifting of the wind 

From the tree, forcibly confined 
In the garden, 
The leaves fell 
One by one 
Until –naked– 
The branches were dull 
Grayish-green skeletons. 

Imagine how 

Even emptier 
Would the universe be 

If the leaves 
If the branches 
If that tree 

If you 

Did not exist. 



. 

Imagine  ~
Being all alone, with no one there to call
your own. No one around to comfort you
if you were down and feeling blue.

Imagine  ~
The moonlight softly shimmering down 
and one silhouette there only to be found.
No one to hear your sighs. A pillow only
to dry those pretty eyes.

Imagine  ~
The stars shining so bright above and no
one to share a gentle kiss no one there for
you to love. But, I will be there always for
you. 

To see that this does not come true.

Imagine  ~
Only you and me and all of the love I shall 
bring to thee. How wonderful 'twill be to see.  
In the soft glow of moonlight shimmering down. 
Our '' two silhouettes together '' always there
forever to be found. .. 

***************************************** ********

Where everything is calm and clear
Decisions between wrong and right are simple
And you`d never have a second thought
Imagine a place
Where everyone belongs with someone
A soul mate for a soul mate
Everyone is happy
Forget the heartache 
Forget the pain
Breathe deeply in love
And never exhale 
There would never be a moment of doubt
But this isn`t a fairy tale
This is real life
There is heartache and pain
And not everything is clear
People make mistakes
People make good choices 
But in the end
There will always be something wrong
And maybe you`ll forget it
Maybe you won`t
There`s not always a soul mate
Not always someone to love
But it`s always nice
To imagine
Because you`re never too old
To create a block in your mind
And shut out reality
So, take a deep breath
And close your eyes
Imagine a place
Where their are happily ever afters 
And dreams that can come true

You  can  find  imagined  love
Right  there  between  the  lines.
It's  surely  there, the  love  we  see, 
The  one  our  heart  designs.

It  still  emerges  vaguely, 
Until  you  give  it  life.
It's  only  then, when  flourishing, 
It  causes  pain  and  strife.

You  never  can  return  it.
Nor  can  it  be  replaced.
It  seems  to  disappear  at  once, 
With  both  blind  souls  disgraced.

I  do  not  choose  to  give  you 
Another  soul's  torment.
So  I'll  just  ask  you  kindly  dear, 
Don't  change  the  words  I  meant.

They  are  not  written  vaguely.
Nor  can  I  thus  conceive, 
Of  how  you  can  imagine  them; 
The  things, you  now  believe.

So, just  remember  truly, 
Though  it's  the  one  you  see; 
Don't  focus  on  imagined  love, 
The  only  love  from  me. 

She woke me up at dawn,
her suitcase like a little brown dog at her heels.

I sat up and looked out the window
at the snow falling in the stand of blackjack trees.

A bus ticket in her hand.

Then she brought something black up to her mouth,
a plum I thought, but it was an asthma inhaler.

I reached under the bed for my menthols
and she asked if I ever thought of cancer.

Yes, I said, but always as a tree way up ahead
in the distance where it doesn't matter

And I suppose a dead soul must look back at that tree,
so far behind his wagon where it also doesn't matter.

except as a memory of rest or water.

Though to believe any of that, I thought,
you have to accept the premise

that she woke me up at all.-----


Sometimes
The young forgot the lessons they had learnt,
And lov'd when they should hate, like thee, Imelda! ~ 
Italy, a Poem




We have the myrtle's breath around us here,
Amidst the fallen pillars; this hath been
Some Naiad's fane of old. How brightly clear,
Flinging a vein of silver o'er the scene,
Up thro' the shadowy grass, the fountain wells,
And music with it, gushing from beneath
The ivy'd altar! that sweet murmur tells
The rich wild-flowers no tale of wo or death; 

Yet once the wave was darken'd, and a stain
Lay deep, and heavy drops but not of rain?
On the dim violets by its marble bed,
And the pale shining water-lily's head. 

Sad is that legend's truth. A fair girl met
One whom she lov'd, by this lone temple's spring,
Just as the sun behind the pine-grove set,
And eve's low voice in whispers woke, to bring
All wanderers home. They stood, that gentle pair
With the blue heaven of Italy above,
And citron-odours dying on the air,
And light leaves trembling round, and early love
Deep in each breast. What reck'd their souls of strife
Between their fathers? Unto them young life
Spread out the treasures of its vernal years;
And if they wept, they wept far other tears 

Than the cold world wrings forth. They stood, that hour,
Speaking of hope, while tree, and fount, and flower,
And star, just gleaming thro' the cypress boughs,
Seem'd holy things, as records of their vows. 

But change came o'er the scene. A hurrying tread
Broke on the whispery shades. Imelda knew
The footstep of her brother's wrath, and fled
Up where the cedars make yon avenue
Dim with green twilight: pausing there, she caught-
Was it the clash of swords? a swift dark thought
Struck down her lip's rich crimson as it pass'd,
And from her eye the sunny sparkle took
One moment with its fearfulness, and shook
Her slight frame fiercely, as a stormy blast
Might rock the rose. Once more, and yet once more,
She still'd her heart to listen all was o'er;
Sweet summer winds alone were heard to sigh,
Bearing the nightingale's deep spirit by. 

That night Imelda's voice was in the song,
Lovely it floated thro' the festive throng
Peopling her father's halls. That fatal night
Her eye look'd starry in its dazzling light,
And her cheek glow'd with beauty's flushing dyes,
Like a rich cloud of eve in southern skies,
A burning, ruby cloud. There were, whose gaze
Follow'd her form beneath the clear lamp's blaze,
And marvell'd at its radiance. But a few
Beheld the brightness of that feverish hue,
With something of dim fear; and in that glance
Found strange and sudden tokens of unrest,
Startling to meet amidst the mazy dance,
Where thought, if present, an unbidden guest,
Comes not unmask'd. Howe'er this were, the time
Sped as it speeds with joy, and grief, and crime
Alike: and when the banquet's hall was left
Unto its garlands of their bloom bereft,
When trembling stars look'd silvery in their wane,
And heavy flowers yet slumber'd, once again 

There stole a footstep, fleet, and light, and lone,
Thro' the dim cedar shade; the step of one
That started at a leaf, of one that fled,
Of one that panted with some secret dread:
What did Imelda there? She sought the scene
Where love so late with youth and hope had been;
Bodings were on her soul

a shuddering thrill
Ran thro' each vein, when first the Naiad's rill
Met her with melody

sweet sounds and low;
We hear them - yet they live along its flow -
Her voice is music lost! The fountain-side
She gain'd

the wave flash'd forth.


'twas darkly dyed
Ev'n as from warrior-hearts; and on its edge,
Amidst the fern, and flowers, and moss-tufts deep,
There lay, as lull'd by stream and rustling sedge,
A youth, a graceful youth. 'Oh! dost thou sleep,
Azzo?' she cried, 'my Azzo! is this rest?'


But then her low tones falter'd: 'On thy breast 

Is the stain - yes, 'tis blood! and that cold cheek -
That moveless lip! thou dost not slumber? speak,
Speak, Azzo, my belov'd - no sound - no breath -
What hath come thus between our spirits? Death!
Death? I but dream - I dream!' and there she stood,
A faint, frail trembler, gazing first on blood,
With her fair arm around yon cypress thrown,
Her form sustain'd by that dark stem alone,
And fading fast, like spell-struck maid of old,
Into white waves dissolving, clear and cold;
When from the grass her dimm'd eye caught a gleam?
'Twas where a sword lay shiver'd by the stream,?
Her brother's sword! - she knew it; and she knew
'Twas with a venom'd point that weapon slew!
Wo for young love! But love is strong. There came
Strength upon woman's fragile heart and frame, 

There came swift courage! On the dewy ground
She knelt, with all her dark hair floating round,
Like a long silken stole; she knelt, and press'd
Her lips of glowing life to Azzo's breast,
Drawing the poison forth. A strange, sad sight!
Pale death, and fearless love, and solemn night!
So the moon saw them last.
The Morn came singing
Thro' the green forests of the Appenines,
With all her joyous birds their free flight winging,
And steps and voices out amongst the vines.
What found that day-spring here? Two fair forms laid
Like sculptured sleepers; from the myrtle shade
Casting a gleam of beauty o'er the wave,
Still, mournful, sweet. Were such things for the grave?
Could it be so indeed? That radiant girl,
Deck'd as for bridal hours!

long braids of pearl 

Amidst her shadowy locks were faintly shining,
As tears might shine, with melancholy light;
And there was gold her slender waist entwining;
And her pale graceful arms how sadly bright!
And fiery gems upon her breast were lying,
And round her marble brow red roses dying.
But she died first! the violet's hue had spread
O'er her sweet eyelids with repose oppress'd,
She had bow'd heavily her gentle head,
And on the youth's hush'd bosom sunk to rest.
So slept they well! the poison's work was done;
Love with true heart had striven

but Death had won. 

The stream with languid murmur creeps,
In Lumin's flowery vale:
Beneath the dew the Lily weeps
Slow-waving to the gale.

'Cease, restless gale! 'it seems to say,
'Nor wake me with thy sighing!
The honours of my vernal day
On rapid wing are flying.

Tomorrow shall the Traveller come
Who late beheld me blooming:
His searching eye shall vainly roam
The dreary vale of Lumin.'

With eager gaze and wetted cheek
My wonted haunts along,
Thus, faithful Maiden! thou shalt seek
The Youth of simplest song.

But I along the breeze shall roll
The voice of feeble power;
And dwell, the Moon-beam of thy soul,
In Slumber's nightly hour. 

A MOST astonishing thing --
Seventy years have I lived;

(Hurrah for the flowers of Spring,
For Spring is here again.)

Seventy years have I lived
No ragged beggar-man,
Seventy years have I lived,
Seventy years man and boy,
And never have I danced for joy. 

If, while my passion I impart,
You deem my words untrue, 
O place your hand upon my heart,
Feel how it throbs for you!

Ah no! reject the thoughtless claim
In pity to your lover!
That thrilling touch would aid the flame
It wishes to discover. 

I saw the Death, and she was seating
By quiet entrance at my own home,
I saw the doors were opened in my tomb,
And there, and there my hope was a-flitting
I'll die, and traces of my past
In days of future will be never sighted,
Look of my eyes will never be delighted
By dear look, in my existence last.

Farewell the somber world, where, precipice above,
My gloomy road was a-streaming,
Where life for me was never cheering,
Where I was loving, having not to love!
The dazzling heavens' azure curtain,
Beloved hills, the brook's enchanting dance,
You, mourn -- the inspiration's chance,
You, peaceful shades of wilderness, uncertain,
And all -- farewell, farewell at once. 

Time is a taper waning fast!
Use it, man, well whilst it doth last:
Lest burning downwards it consume away,
Before thou hast commenced the labour of the day.

Time is a pardon of a goodly soil!
Plenty shall crown thine honest toil:
But if uncultivated, rankest weeds
Shall choke the efforts of the rising seeds.

Time is a leasehold of uncertain date!
Granted to thee by everlasting fate.
Neglect not thou, ere thy short term expire,
To save thy soul from ever-burning fire. 

Ne Rubeam, Pingui donatus Munere
      (Horace, Epistles II. 

i.
     While you, great patron of mankind, sustain 
    The balanc'd world, and open all the main;
    Your country, chief, in arms abroad defend,
    At home, with morals, arts, and laws amend;
    How shall the Muse, from such a monarch steal
    An hour, and not defraud the public weal?
        Edward and Henry, now the boast of fame,
    And virtuous Alfred, a more sacred name,
    After a life of gen'rous toils endur'd,
   The Gaul subdu'd, or property secur'd,
   Ambition humbled, mighty cities storm'd,
   Or laws establish'd, and the world reform'd;
   Clos'd their long glories with a sigh, to find
   Th' unwilling gratitude of base mankind!
   All human virtue, to its latest breath
   Finds envy never conquer'd, but by death.
   The great Alcides, ev'ry labour past,
   Had still this monster to subdue at last.
   Sure fate of all, beneath whose rising ray
   Each star of meaner merit fades away!
   Oppress'd we feel the beam directly beat,
   Those suns of glory please not till they set.

       To thee the world its present homage pays,
   The harvest early, but mature the praise:
   Great friend of liberty! in  kings a name
   Above all Greek, above all Roman fame:
   Whose word is truth, as sacred and rever'd,
   As Heav'n's own oracles from altars heard.
   Wonder of kings! like whom, to mortal eyes
   None e'er has risen, and none e'er shall rise.

       Just in one instance, be it yet confest
   Your people, Sir, are partial in the rest:
   Foes to all living worth except your own,
   And advocates for folly dead and gone.
   Authors, like coins, grow dear as they grow old;
   It is the rust we value, not the gold.
   Chaucer's worst ribaldry is learn'd by rote,
   And beastly Skelton heads of houses quote:
   And each true Briton is to Ben so civil,
   He swears the Muses met him at the Devil.

       Though justly Greece her eldest sons admires,
   Why should not we be wiser than our sires?
   In ev'ry public virtue we excel:
   We build, we paint, we sing, we dance as well,
   And learned Athens to our art must stoop,
   Could she behold us tumbling through a hoop.

       If time improve our wit as well as wine,
   Say at what age a poet grows divine?
   Shall we, or shall we not, account him so,
   Who died, perhaps, an hundred years ago?
   End all dispute; and fix the year precise
   When British bards begin t'immortalize?

       "Who lasts a century can have no flaw,
   I hold that wit a classic, good in law


       Suppose he wants a year, will you compound?
   And shall we deem him ancient, right and sound,
   Or damn to all eternity at once,
    At ninety-nine, a modern and a dunce?

       "We shall not quarrel for a year or two;
   By courtesy of England, he may do


       Then by the rule that made the horsetail bare,
   I pluck out year by year, as hair by hair,
   And melt down ancients like a heap of snow:
   While you, to measure merits, look in Stowe,
   And estimating authors by the year,
   Bestow a garland only on a bier.

       Shakespeare (whom you and ev'ry playhouse bill
   Style the divine, the matchless, what you will)
   For gain, not glory, wing'd his roving flight,
   And grew immortal in his own despite.
   Ben, old and poor, as little seem'd to heed
   The life to come, in ev'ry poet's creed.
   Who now reads Cowley? if he pleases yet,
   His moral pleases, not his pointed wit;
   Forgot his epic, nay Pindaric art,
   But still I love the language of his heart.

       "Yet surely, surely, these were famous men!
   What boy but hears the sayings of old Ben?
   In all debates where critics bear a part,
   Not one but nods, and talks of Jonson's art,
   Of Shakespeare's nature, and of Cowley's wit;
   How Beaumont's judgment check'd what Fletcher writ;
   How Shadwell hasty, Wycherley was slow;
   But, for the passions, Southerne sure and Rowe.
   These, only these, support the crowded stage,
   From eldest Heywood down to Cibber's age


       All this may be; the people's voice is odd,
   To  Gammer Gurton if it give the bays,
   And yet deny the  Careless Husband praise,
   Or say our fathers never broke a rule;
   Why then, I say, the public is a fool.
   But let them own, that greater faults than we
   They had, and greater virtues, I'll agree.
   Spenser himself affects the obsolete,
   And Sidney's verse halts ill on Roman feet:
   Milton's strong pinion now not Heav'n can bound,
  Now serpent-like, in prose he sweeps the ground,
  In quibbles, angel and archangel join,
  Not that I'd lop the beauties from his book,
  Like slashing Bentley with his desp'rate hook,
  Or damn all Shakespeare, like th' affected fool
  At court, who hates whate'er he read at school.


     But for the wits of either Charles's days,
  The mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease;
  Sprat, Carew, Sedley, and a hundred more,
  (Like twinkling stars the  Miscellanies o'er)
  One simile, that solitary shines
  In the dry desert of a thousand lines,
  Or lengthen'd thought that gleams through many a page,
  Has sanctified whole poems for an age.


     I lose my patience, and I own it too,
  When works are censur'd, not as bad, but new;
  While if our elders break all reason's laws,
  These fools demand not pardon, but applause.


     On Avon's bank, where flow'rs eternal blow,
  If I but ask if any weed can grow?
  One tragic sentence if I dare deride,
  Which Betterton's grave action dignified,
  Or well-mouth'd Booth with emphasis proclaims
  (Though but, perhaps, a muster-roll of names)
  How will our fathers rise up in a rage,
  And swear, all shame is lost in George's age!
  You'd think no fools disgrac'd the former reign,
  Did not some grave examples yet remain,
  Who scorn a lad should teach his father skill,
  And, having once been wrong, will be so still.
  He, who to seem more deep than you or I,
  Extols old bards, or Merlin's Prophecy,
  Mistake him not; he envies, not admires,
  And to debase the sons, exalts the sires.
  Had ancient times conspir'd to disallow
  What then was new, what had been ancient now?
  Or what remain'd, so worthy to be read
  By learned critics, of the mighty dead?


     In days of ease, when now the weary sword
  Was sheath'd, and luxury with Charles restor'd;
  In ev'ry taste of foreign courts improv'd,
  "All, by the King's example, liv'd and lov'd

"
  Then peers grew proud in horsemanship t'excel,
  Newmarket's glory rose, as Britain's fell;
  The soldier breath'd the gallantries of France,
  And ev'ry flow'ry courtier writ romance.
  Then marble, soften'd into life, grew warm,
  And yielding metal flow'd to human form:
  Lely on animated canvas stole
  The sleepy eye, that spoke the melting soul.
  No wonder then, when all was love and sport,
  The willing Muses were debauch'd at court:
  On each enervate string they taught the note
  To pant or tremble through an eunuch's throat.
  But Britain, changeful as a child at play,
  Now calls in princes, and now turns away:
  Now Whig, now Tory, what we lov'd we hate;
  Now all for pleasure, now for Church and state;
  Now for prerogative, and now for laws;
  Effects unhappy! from a noble cause.


     Time was, a sober Englishman would knock
  His servants up, and rise by five o'clock,
  Instruct his family in ev'ry rule,
  And send his wife to church, his son to school.
  To worship like his fathers was his care;
  To teach their frugal virtues to his heir;
  To prove that luxury could never hold,
  And place, on good security, his gold.
  Now times are chang'd, and one poetic itch
  Has seiz'd the court and city, poor and rich:
  Sons, sires, and grandsires, all will wear the bays,
  Our wives read Milton, and our daughters plays,
  To theatres, and to rehearsals throng,
  And all our grace at table is a song.
  I, who so oft renounce the Muses, lie,
  Not {-}{-}{-}{-}{-}'s self e'er tells more fibs than I;
  When sick of Muse, our follies we deplore,
  And promise our best friends to rhyme no more;
  We wake next morning in a raging fit,
  And call for pen and ink to show our wit.


     He serv'd a 'prenticeship who sets up shop;
  Ward tried on puppies and the poor, his drop;
  Ev'n Radcliffe's doctors travel first to France,
  Nor dare to practise till they've learn'd to dance.
  Who builds a bridge that never drove a pile?
  (Should Ripley venture, all the world would smile)
  But those who cannot write, and those who can,
  All rhyme, and scrawl, and scribble, to a man.


     Yet, Sir, reflect, the mischief is not great;
  These madmen never hurt the Church or state:
  Sometimes the folly benefits mankind;
  And rarely av'rice taints the tuneful mind.
  Allow him but his plaything of a pen,
  He ne'er rebels, or plots, like other men:
  Flight of cashiers, or mobs, he'll never mind;
  And knows no losses while the Muse is kind.
  To cheat a friend, or ward, he leaves to Peter;
  The good man heaps up nothing but mere metre,
  Enjoys his garden and his book in quiet;
  And then--a perfect hermit in his diet.
  Of little use the man you may suppose,
  Who says in verse what others say in prose:
  Yet let me show, a poet's of some weight,
  And (though no soldier) useful to the state.
  What will a child learn sooner than a song?
  What better teach a foreigner the tongue?
  What's long or short, each accent where to place,
  And speak in public with some sort of grace.
  I scarce can think him such a worthless thing,
  Unless he praise some monster of a king;
  Or virtue or religion turn to sport,
  To please a lewd, or unbelieving court.
  Unhappy Dryden!--In all Charles's days,
  Roscommon only boasts unspotted bays;
  And in our own (excuse some courtly stains)
  No whiter page than Addison remains.
  He, from the taste obscene reclaims our youth,
  And sets the passions on the side of truth,
  Forms the soft bosom with the gentlest art,
  And pours each human virtue in the heart.
  Let Ireland tell, how wit upheld her cause,
  Her trade supported, and supplied her laws;
  And leave on Swift this grateful verse engrav'd,
  "The rights a court attack'd, a poet sav'd

"
  Behold the hand that wrought a nation's cure,
  Stretch'd to relieve the idiot and the poor,
  Proud vice to brand, or injur'd worth adorn,
  And stretch the ray to ages yet unborn.
  Not but there are, who merit other palms;
  Hopkins and Sternhold glad the heart with psalms:
  The boys and girls whom charity maintains,
  Implore your help in these pathetic strains:
  How could devotion touch the country pews,
  Unless the gods bestow'd a proper Muse?
  Verse cheers their leisure, verse assists their work,
  Verse prays for peace, or sings down Pope and Turk.
  The silenc'd preacher yields to potent strain,
  And feels that grace his pray'r besought in vain;
  The blessing thrills through all the lab'ring throng,
  And Heav'n is won by violence of song.


     Our rural ancestors, with little blest,
  Patient of labour when the end was rest,
  Indulg'd the day that hous'd their annual grain,
  With feasts, and off'rings, and a thankful strain:
  The joy their wives, their sons, and servants share,
  Ease of their toil, and part'ners of their care:
  The laugh, the jest, attendants on the bowl,
  Smooth'd ev'ry brow, and open'd ev'ry soul:
  With growing years the pleasing licence grew,
  And taunts alternate innocently flew.
  But times corrupt, and nature, ill-inclin'd,
  Produc'd the point that left a sting behind;
  Till friend with friend, and families at strife,
  Triumphant malice rag'd through private life.
  Who felt the wrong, or fear'd it, took th' alarm,
  Appeal'd to law, and justice lent her arm.
  At length, by wholesome dread of statutes bound,
  The poets learn'd to please, and not to wound:
  Most warp'd to flatt'ry's side; but some, more nice,
  Preserv'd the freedom, and forbore the vice.
  Hence satire rose, that just the medium hit,
  And heals with morals what it hurts with wit.


     We conquer'd France, but felt our captive's charms;
  Her arts victorious triumph'd o'er our arms;
  Britain to soft refinements less a foe,
  Wit grew polite, and numbers learn'd to flow.
  Waller was smooth; but Dryden taught to join
  The varying verse, the full-resounding line,
  The long majestic march, and energy divine.
  Though still some traces of our rustic vein
  And splayfoot verse remain'd, and will remain.
  Late, very late, correctness grew our care,
  When the tir'd nation breath'd from civil war.
  Exact Racine, and Corneille's noble fire
  Show'd us that France had something to admire.
  Not but the tragic spirit was our own,
  And full in Shakespeare, fair in Otway shone:
  But Otway fail'd to polish or refine,
  And fluent Shakespeare scarce effac'd a line.
  Ev'n copious Dryden wanted, or forgot,
  The last and greatest art, the art to blot.


     Some doubt, if equal pains, or equal fire
  The humbler Muse of comedy require.
  But in known images of life, I guess
  The labour greater, as th' indulgence less.
  Observe how seldom ev'n the best succeed:
  Tell me if Congreve's fools are fools indeed?
  What pert, low dialogue has Farqu'ar writ!
  How Van wants grace, who never wanted wit!
  The stage how loosely does Astr{ae}ea tread,
  Who fairly puts all characters to bed!
  And idle Cibber, how he breaks the laws,
  To make poor Pinky eat with vast applause!
  But fill their purse, our poet's work is done,
  Alike to them, by pathos or by pun.


     O you! whom vanity's light bark conveys
  On fame's mad voyage by the wind of praise,
  With what a shifting gale your course you ply,
  For ever sunk too low, or borne too high!
  Who pants for glory finds but short repose,
  A breath revives him, or a breath o'erthrows.
  Farewell the stage! if just as thrives the play,
  The silly bard grows fat, or falls away.


     There still remains, to mortify a wit,
  The many-headed monster of the pit:
  A senseless, worthless, and unhonour'd crowd;
  Who, to disturb their betters mighty proud,
  Clatt'ring their sticks before ten lines are spoke,
  Call for the farce, the bear, or the black-joke.
  What dear delight to Britons farce affords!
  Farce once the taste of mobs, but now of lords;
  (For taste, eternal wanderer, now flies
  From heads to ears, and now from ears to eyes.)
  The play stands still; damn action and discourse,
  Back fly the scenes, and enter foot and horse;
  Pageants on pageants, in long order drawn,
  Peers, heralds, bishops, ermine, gold, and lawn;
  The champion too! and, to complete the jest,
  Old Edward's armour beams on Cibber's breast.
  With laughter sure Democritus had died,
  Had he beheld an audience gape so wide.
  Let bear or elephant be e'er so white,
  The people, sure, the people are the sight!
  Ah luckless poet! stretch thy lungs and roar,
  That bear or elephant shall heed thee more;
  While all its throats the gallery extends,
  And all the thunder of the pit ascends!
  Loud as the wolves on Orcas' stormy steep,
  Howl to the roarings of the Northern deep.
  Such is the shout, the long-applauding note,
  At Quin's high plume, or Oldfield's petticoat,
  Or when from Court a birthday suit bestow'd
  Sinks the lost actor in the tawdry load.
  Booth enters--hark! the universal peal!
  "But has he spoken?" Not a syllable.
  "What shook the stage, and made the people stare?"
  Cato's long wig, flow'r'd gown, and lacquer'd chair.


     Yet lest you think I rally more than teach,
  Or praise malignly arts I cannot reach,
  Let me for once presume t'instruct the times,
  To know the poet from the man of rhymes:
  'Tis he, who gives my breast a thousand pains,
  Can make me feel each passion that he feigns;
  Enrage, compose, with more than magic art,
  With pity and with terror tear my heart;
  And snatch me o'er the earth or thro' the air,
  To Thebes, to Athens, when he will, and where.


     But not this part of the poetic state
  Alone, deserves the favour of the great:
  Think of those authors, Sir, who would rely
  More on a reader's sense, than gazer's eye.
  Or who shall wander where the Muses sing?
  Who climb their mountain, or who taste their spring?
  How shall we fill a library with wit,
  When Merlin's Cave is half unfurnish'd yet?


     My Liege! why writers little claim your thought,
  I guess: and, with their leave, will tell the fault:
  We poets are (upon a poet's word)
  Of all mankind, the creatures most absurd:
  The season, when to come, and when to go,
  To sing, or cease to sing, we never know;
  And if we will recite nine hours in ten,
  You lose your patience, just like other men.
  Then too we hurt ourselves, when to defend
  A single verse, we quarrel with a friend;
  Repeat unask'd; lament, the wit's too fine
  For vulgar eyes, and point out ev'ry line.
  But most, when straining with too weak a wing,
  We needs will write epistles to the king;
  And from the moment we oblige the town,
  Expect a place, or pension from the Crown;
  Or dubb'd historians by express command,
  T'enroll your triumphs o'er the seas and land,
  Be call'd to court to plan some work divine,
  As once for Louis, Boileau and Racine.


     Yet think, great Sir! (so many virtues shown)
  Ah think, what poet best may make them known?
  Or choose at least some minister of grace,
  Fit to bestow the laureate's weighty place.


     Charles, to late times to be transmitted fair,
  Assign'd his figure to Bernini's care;
  And great Nassau to Kneller's hand decreed
  To fix him graceful on the bounding steed;
  So well in paint and stone they judg'd of merit:
  But kings in wit may want discerning spirit.
  The hero William, and the martyr Charles,
  One knighted Blackmore, and one pension'd Quarles;
  Which made old Ben, and surly Dennis swear,



     Not with such majesty, such bold relief,
  The forms august, of king, or conqu'ring chief,
  E'er swell'd on marble; as in verse have shin'd
  (In polish'd verse) the manners and the mind.
  Oh! could I mount on the M{ae}onian wing,
  Your arms, your actions, your repose to sing!
  What seas you travers'd! and what fields you fought!
  Your country's peace, how oft, how dearly bought!
  How barb'rous rage subsided at your word,
  And nations wonder'd while they dropp'd the sword!
  How, when you nodded, o'er the land and deep,
  Peace stole her wing, and wrapp'd the world in sleep;
  Till earth's extremes your mediation own,
  And Asia's tyrants tremble at your throne--
  But verse, alas! your Majesty disdains;
  And I'm not us'd to panegyric strains:
  The zeal of fools offends at any time,
  But most of all, the zeal of fools in rhyme,
  Besides, a fate attends on all I write,
  That when I aim at praise, they say I bite.
  A vile encomium doubly ridicules:
  There's nothing blackens like the ink of fools;
  If true, a woeful likeness; and if lies,
  "Praise undeserv'd is scandal in disguise

"
  Well may he blush, who gives it, or receives;
  And when I flatter, let my dirty leaves
  (Like journals, odes, and such forgotten things
  As Eusden, Philips, Settle, writ of kings)
  Clothe spice, line trunks, or flutt'ring in a row,
  Befringe the rails of Bedlam and Soho. 




People have been trying to kill me since I was born,
a man tells his son, trying to explain
the wisdom of learning a second tongue.

It's the same old story from the previous century
about my father and me.

The same old story from yesterday morning
about me and my son.
It's called "Survival Strategies
and the Melancholy of Racial Assimilation


It's called "Psychological Paradigms of Displaced Persons,'
called "The Child Who'd Rather Play than Study

"
Practice until you feel 
the language inside you, says the man. 

But what does he know about inside and outside,
my father who was spared nothing
in spite of the languages he used?

And me, confused about the flesh and soul,
who asked once into a telephone,
Am I inside you? 

You're always inside me, a woman answered, 
at peace with the body's finitude, 
at peace with the soul's disregard
of space and time.

Am I inside you? I asked once 
lying between her legs, confused
about the body and the heart.

If you don't believe you're inside me, you're not,
she answered, at peace with the body's greed,
at peace with the heart's bewilderment.
It's an ancient story from yesterday evening
called "Patterns of Love in Peoples of Diaspora,'

called "Loss of the Homeplace 
and the Defilement of the Beloved,'
called "I Want to Sing but I Don't Know Any Songs

"The nightmares
of the immigrant
to another's, 
someone else's bed, 
the one who leaves
an old nuptial couch
to look for softer one outside, 
for tender touch somewhere. 
there, sleeping
in someone's warm hug  
bad dreams of raid 
and deportation.  back


No ship of all that under sail or steam
Have gathered people to us more and more
But Pilgrim-manned the Mayflower in a dream
Has been her anxious convoy in to shore. 

We are all immigrants
We always pay our dues and our rents
Immigrants are not criminals
Immigrants are not animals
We are human beings
Who love all types of beans
We are all from somewhere
We're from here, we're from there
Immigrants are hard workers
We wear shoes, not over-priced sneakers
We are good people
Who wear blue and purple
When we're happy
When the old men are not grumpy
We are all passing by
We cry when we're sad
We laugh when we're not mad
We tell the truth, we don't lie
We are all immigrants
We love peace
And we want to go in one piece
When we die
We tell the truth, we do not lie
We are all immigrants
We are Canadians, Asians, Haitians, 
Jamaicans, Africans, Europeans
Mexicans, Australians, Americans
Islanders, Indians, and Native Americans
However, we're neither Aliens, nor Martians
We are all immigrants. 

We are born with dreams in our hearts,
looking for better days ahead.
At the gates we are given new papers,
our old clothes are taken
and we are given overalls like mechanics wear.
We are given shots and doctors ask questions.
Then we gather in another room
where counselors orient us to the new land
we will now live in. We take tests.
Some of us were craftsmen in the old world,
good with our hands and proud of our work.
Others were good with their heads.
They used common sense like scholars
use glasses and books to reach the world.
But most of us didn’t finish high school.

The old men who have lived here stare at us,
from deep disturbed eyes, sulking, retreated.
We pass them as they stand around idle,
leaning on shovels and rakes or against walls.
Our expectations are high: in the old world,
they talked about rehabilitation,
about being able to finish school,
and learning an extra good trade.
But right away we are sent to work as dishwashers,
to work in fields for three cents an hour.
The administration says this is temporary
So we go about our business, blacks with blacks,
poor whites with poor whites,
chicanos and indians by themselves.
The administration says this is right,
no mixing of cultures, let them stay apart,
like in the old neighborhoods we came from.

We came here to get away from false promises,
from dictators in our neighborhoods,
who wore blue suits and broke our doors down
when they wanted, arrested us when they felt like,
swinging clubs and shooting guns as they pleased.
But it’s no different here. It’s all concentrated.
The doctors don’t care, our bodies decay,
our minds deteriorate, we learn nothing of value.
Our lives don’t get better, we go down quick.

My cell is crisscrossed with laundry lines,
my T-shirts, boxer shorts, socks and pants are drying.
Just like it used to be in my neighborhood:
from all the tenements laundry hung window to window.
Across the way Joey is sticking his hands
through the bars to hand Felipe a cigarette,
men are hollering back and forth cell to cell,
saying their sinks don’t work,
or somebody downstairs hollers angrily
about a toilet overflowing,
or that the heaters don’t work.


I ask Coyote next door to shoot me over
a little more soap to finish my laundry.
I look down and see new immigrants coming in,
mattresses rolled up and on their shoulders,
new haircuts and brogan boots,
looking around, each with a dream in their heart,
thinking they’ll get a chance to change their lives.

But in the end, some will just sit around
talking about how good the old world was.
Some of the younger ones will become gangsters.
Some will die and others will go on living
without a soul, a future, or a reason to live.
Some will make it out of here with hate in their eyes,
but so very few make it out of here as human
as they came in, they leave wondering what good they are now
as they look at their hands so long away from their tools,
as they look at themselves, so long gone from their families,
so long gone from life itself, so many things have changed. 


I'll tell you why.
To survive

the onslaught of religion.
To outlive

the ghosts of martyrs.
To recover

from the world's longest war
since WWII. To live

beyond the hatreds
of patriotism. To see

the kinder face of humanity.
To think

free of the Faith's manacles.
To believe

without the obligation
of forming belief.

To discover
the basic joys of being.

The price? I'll tell you.
Evaporation.

Marginalised to the point
of disappearance.

Barred for nothing
more profound than a shade

of skin, a tone
of speech, a taste

of lifestyle. Alienated
beyond the word.

Ignored by the mighty.
Detested by the commoner.

Worth it? Doubtless.
To finally grasp

humanity's fraudulent truth.
To dream

the sweetness of equality.
To see past

the façade of brotherhood.
To be touched

you might say, by the rays
of a luminous discovery.

To abandon
all faith, and come to cherish

the immense solitude
of non-believing.

To desire. To know
the power of desire. To wait

joyfully amid unpalatable sadness.
Recommend it? 

Only to loathsome enemies
and to my dearest friends. 


Now Jordan's land of promise is the burden of my song.
Perhaps you've heard him lecture, and blow about it strong;
To hear him talk you'd think it was a heaven upon earth,
But listen and I'll tell you now the plain unvarnished truth.

Here mutton, beef, and damper are all you'll get to eat,
From Monday morn till Sunday night, all through the blessed week.
And should the flour bag run short, then mutton, beef, and tea
Will be your lot, and whether or not, 'twill have to do, you'll see.

Here snakes and all vile reptiles crawl around you as you walk,
But these you never hear about in Mr. Jordan's talk;
Mosquitoes, too, and sandflies, they will tease you all the night,
And until you get quite colonised you'll be a pretty sight.
Here are boundless plains where it seldom rains, and you'll maybe die of thirst;
But should you so dispose your bones, you'll scarcely be the first,
For there's many a strong and stalwart man come out to make his pile,
Who never leaves the fatal shore of this thrice accursed isle.

To sum it up in few short words, the place is only fit
For those who were sent out here, for from this they cannot flit.
But any other men who come a living here to try,
Will vegetate a little while and then lie down and die. 

They fled those who treated them like scum
Bees they have become; flying rose to rose
From across the world these poor souls have come
Working like slaves with sweat upon their brows.
Past the rapid rivers and steep mountains
Across the ocean and the desert, too.
In great hopes to drink from Golden fountains
Their willingness has managed to break through.
All they have is the hopes and dreams they made.
When they decided to make the journey
Oblivious to the game being played, 
All they yearned for was to at least be free.
   Immigrants, for a new life, theirs they have lost; 
   Their lives mean nothing if that is the cost. 

When darkness unveiled, 
sigh slithers across the thin corridor of will
 and all blurtd blues  sadulous shimmer 
over the dew -thrust dusts with thrumming silence 
that encores the tunes of love infallible 
like glazing tears dazzling over the lips of dusk.

that may reasons out of attrition in jittering stance
and the knackering thoughts inextricable smacks of myth
that slumps over the will mystified.
all the queries eclectic searching the soul deep & infinite
ruefully lodge over the distraught detracting.

when we search the love in baited breath in redolence
one may finds its way out of imminence of irrelevance
refusing all my gestures embarking upon milieu time-tossed. 


Children of my happier prime,
When One yet lived with me, and threw
Her rainbow over life and time,
Even Hope, my bride, and mother to you!
O, nurtured in sweet pastoral air,
And fed on flowers and light and dew
Of morning meadows -spare, ah, spare
Reproach; spare, and upbraid me not
That, yielding scarce to reckless mood,
But jealous of your future lot,
I sealed you in a fate subdued.
Have I not saved you from the dread
Theft, and ignoring which need be
The triumph of the insincere
Unanimous Mediocrity?
Rest, therefore, free from all despite,
Snugged in the arms of comfortable night. 

Have you heard, my friend, the slander that the Negro has to face?
Immorality, the grossest, has been charged up to his race.
Listen, listen to my story, as I now proceed to tell
Of conditions in the Southland, where the mass of Negroes dwell.

Ev'ry city, town or county, ev'ry state on Southern soil,
Has mulattoes in its borders, found among the sons of toil.
Can you tell from whence they landed; or to whither shall they go?
Is the Negro race responsible alone, I'd like to know?

When a man among the Negroes is the least suspected there
Of an intimate relation with a daughter that is fair,
Then an angry mob arises and he answers for the same
In a death, the worst in cruelty the company can name.

Though the noonday sun is shining at the time the lynching's done,
Still the officers of justice can't detect a single one,
Who partook in Negro killing, for the deed no one is blamed,
And inside the nation's senate comes a voice, 'We're not ashamed.'

Is the same true when a white man leads a Negro girl astray?
When he takes away her virtue, is the same true? tell me, pray,
Do the press and pulpit clamor or condemn the mighty wrong?
Is there sentiment against it? is the burden of my song.

When the case is thus presented, they are silent as the grave,
And the law at once is powerless a Negro's name to save,
So you see the same continues and the truth is like a flood,
That in veins of Southern Negroes flow the best of Southern blood.

Can you tell of these mulattoes, did they fall here from the sky?
How is this that they're among us? can you tell the reason why?
Who's to blame for their existence? is the Negro race alone?
If there are such freaks in nature it is time to make them known.

'Tis a custom born of slavery when master's law and might,
Was enforced upon the bondsman without question of the right,
And the parson preached on Sunday how the servant should obey
All the mandates of the master, let them be whate'er they may.

O, how sad the tales of bondage when persuasive measures failed, 
How they tortured Negro women till their hellish plans prevailed!
Women faithful to their virtue were as martyrs sent to rest,
Others yielded to the tempter, weary, helpless and distressed.

So the spirit lives at present for the master hand to rule,
Cook or washer, nurse or housemaid passes through this training school,
Lo! the greatest of temptations, men and devils there invent,
And present them to the servants, on their ruin so intent.

There's no friend to whom the dusky maiden can appeal for aid,
To the mistress of the home to speak of such she is afraid,
In the law there's no protection that a Negro girl can claim,
None to rescue, none to pity, so she enters into shame.

Now reflect for just a moment, in the light of what you see,
Which is worse, to yield the tempter or the evil one to be?
Can you still believe that Negroes are immoral more than whites?
O, how different the picture if the Negro had his rights!

So we know that sin and darkness cannot always hope to reign,
All the ills to Negro women will the Father bring to light,
For the Judge, the only Judge of all creation will do right. 

So soon my body will have gone 
Beyond the sound and sight of men, 
And tho' it wakes and suffers now, 
Its sleep will be unbroken then; 
But oh, my frail immortal soul 
That will not sleep forevermore, 
A leaf borne onward by the blast, 
A wave that never finds the shore. 

Such is this heart of mine
With a love to hide
With its every beat
Comes your name

With every distance
Is a shattered piece

Now it's bleeding so intense
In brightly colored redness
This innocent pain
running through my veins
Is a word of goodbye
Wounded by a knife

If only you knew my name
I know you do
But do you even care
When thou shall refuse
to resuscitate
This life support
hanging by a thread

The way you silenced 
My heart
With every beat of thy ignorance
Now I'm nothing
More than a rotting flesh
A corpse as cold as a lifeless

Now let me bury thy memory 
In my  lonely grave
Watch me as I surrender 
My heart back to the heavens
A mortality of fate
Caused by thy selfishness

Still I 
Here to stay
In this world of vile and contempt
A pledge till the very last breath
Never will I depart
In your memory 
I will always be a part

Henceforth, I
In thee, I shall find meaning
In thou, I shall find sin
At long last
I shall find
A long and lasting sleep.

aka. The Introvert Chick


I speak this poem now with grave and level voice 
In praise of autumn, of the far-horn-winding fall. 

I praise the flower-barren fields, the clouds, the tall 
Unanswering branches where the wind makes sullen noise. 

I praise the fall: it is the human season. 
Now 
No more the foreign sun does meddle at our earth, 
Enforce the green and bring the fallow land to birth, 
Nor winter yet weigh all with silence the pine bough, 

But now in autumn with the black and outcast crows 
Share we the spacious world: the whispering year is gone: 
There is more room to live now: the once secret dawn 
Comes late by daylight and the dark unguarded goes. 

Between the mutinous brave burning of the leaves 
And winter’s covering of our hearts with his deep snow 
We are alone: there are no evening birds: we know 
The naked moon: the tame stars circle at our eaves. 

It is the human season. On this sterile air 
Do words outcarry breath: the sound goes on and on. 
I hear a dead man’s cry from autumn long since gone. 
I cry to you beyond upon this bitter air. 

At dawn, when we suddenly awake, 
We feel the innocence of Blake.
As the day unfolds, on struggling most
There comes reflection, like roads of Frost.

Upon reading stories of woe
We revisit in poetry lines of Poe
Then we delve into love gems of Shakespeare
To keep up inspiration throughout the year.

For transcendental thought we move on
To understand 'Celestial Love' of Emerson.
This often leads us to mystical love poetry
In the company of Rumi.

A journey along 'Keep Me Fully Glad'
Adds sensitivity, freshness, lore of Tagore.
Now, a token of praise for major Pessoa
Whose heteronyms flood Lisboa. 

Immersed in their lines of Love, 
Beauty, Dreams, Wisdom galore
We humbly sing, yet learn and live more.  

Immortal love, forever full,
Forever flowing free,
Forever shared, forever whole,
A never ebbing sea!

Our outward lips confess the name
All other names above;
Love only knoweth whence it came,
And comprehendeth love.

The mists of earth away:
Shine out, O Light divine, and show
How wide and far we stray.

We may not climb the heavenly steeps
In vain we search the lowest deeps,
For Him no depths can drown.

But warm, sweet, tender, even yet,
A present help is He;
And faith still has its Olivet,
And love its Galilee.

The healing of His seamless dress
Is by our beds of pain;
We touch Him in life’s throng and press,
And we are whole again.

Through Him the first fond prayers are said
Our lips of childhood frame,
The last low whispers of our dead
Are burdened with His Name.

Whate’er our name or sign,
We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,
We test our lives by Thine.

The letter fails, the systems fall,
And every symbol wanes;
The Spirit over brooding all,
Eternal Love remains. 

the faint pink flower falling from the tree
does not ask where we can hear it anyway
will they remember me, 

not marble or the guilded monuments sighed Shakespeare.
immortal or not, obscurely the poet writes

brightening his own midnights, if
no one else's.
we are the folded wing asleep or

we are awake and dreaming.
maybe.  our poems, too

in the impearled libraries of the far Heavens

Myself I am, when I am; 
How I was before I've brought 
Into question: who am I? 

In numb emotions
Life is buried, 
To it till death -devotion; 
Yet the end.  

so scared! 

How to survive
This abyss dull and dark, 
To keep the soul alive, 
Protect its spark? —

When Love in light
I seek in heart, 
Then Soul is bright, 
Alive in start.

Angelic innocence -its core
Absorbed in childish game, 
Eager eyes do look for more: 
Beyond this life -its aim.

Impalpable floating. 
Transcending zenith, 
The rhythm dancing. 
Untouched beneath; 

In dust of Heaven
Wings painting Life; 
It flies with angels-
O! Shinny, bright! 

It knows the dance
As just arrived; 
I am in trance-
"Wake up to life! ; 

Be mortal, wait. 
You must return! " —
My inner voice, a saint? 
"For one day, it's yours to turn! ". 


Foil'd by our fellow-men, depress'd, outworn,
We leave the brutal world to take its way,
And, Patience! in another life, we say
The world shall be thrust down, and we up-borne.

And will not, then, the immortal armies scorn
The world's poor, routed leavings? or will they,
Who fail'd under the heat of this life's day,
Support the fervours of the heavenly morn?

No, no! the energy of life may be
Kept on after the grave, but not begun;
And he who flagg'd not in the earthly strife,

From strength to strength advancing--only he,
His soul well-knit, and all his battles won,
Mounts, and that hardly, to eternal life. 

In Sleeping Beauty's castle
the clock strikes one hundred years
and the girl in the tower returns to the world.
So do the servants in the kitchen,
who don't even rub their eyes.
The cook's right hand, lifted
an exact century ago,
completes its downward arc
to the kitchen boy's left ear;
the boy's tensed vocal cords
finally let go
the trapped, enduring whimper,
and the fly, arrested mid-plunge
above the strawberry pie
fulfills its abiding mission
and dives into the sweet, red glaze.

As a child I had a book
with a picture of that scene.
I was too young to notice
how fear persists, and how
the anger that causes fear persists,
that its trajectory can't be changed
or broken, only interrupted.
My attention was on the fly:
that this slight body
with its transparent wings
and life-span of one human day
still craved its particular share
of sweetness, a century later. 

O Liberty! thou goddess, heavenly bright,
profuse of bliss and pregnant with delight,
Eternal pleasures in thy presence reign,
And smiling Plenty leads thy smiling train.
Eased of her load Subjection grows more light,
And Poverty looks cheerful in thy sight.
Giv'st beauty to the sun and pleasures to the day.
thee, goddess, thee, Britannia's isle adores!
How oft has she exhausted all her stores!
How oft on fields of death thy presence sought,
Nor thinks the mighty prize too dearly bought!
On foreign mountains may the sun refine
the grape's soft juice and mellow it in wine.
With citron groves adorn a distant soil.
And the fat olives swell with floods of oil.
We envy not the warmer clime, that lies
in ten degrees of more indulgent skies;
Nor at the coarseness of our heaven repine,
Though o'er our heads the frozen Pleiads shine.
'Tis Liberty that crowns Britannia's isle,
And makes her barren rocks and her bleak mountains shine


All the creation is mortal
What ever floating before eyes
Will vanish one day.

Thousands of  universe floating
Have to sink one day.

But I  find rythem and knot
Are immortal, always alive
For new creation
After every devastation
To awake the sleeping soul. 

To understand the logic of greatness, 
we need to be inexplicably illogical, 
Neither by the artistic brilliance, never, 
Nor by the philantropic demeanour, 
Can one withstand Achilles, the warrior.

Those legends of the past, immortals.
Their surreal saga, immutable.
Gifted with the glory, unmatchable.
Surpassing their Stature, impossible.
Exactness of their excellence, debatable. 


AUTUMN to winter, winter into spring, 
Spring into summer, summer into fall,-- 
So rolls the changing year, and so we change; 
Motion so swift, we know not that we move. 
Till at the gate of some memorial hour 
We pause--look in its sepulchre to find 
The cast-off shape that years since we called 'I'-- 
And start, amazed. Yet on! We may not stay 
To weep or laugh. All which is past, is past 
Even while we gaze the simulated form 
Drops into dust, like many-centuried corpse 
At opening of a tomb. 
Alack, this world 
Is full of change, change, change,--nothing but change! 
Is there not one straw in life's whirling flood 
To hold by, as the torrent sweeps us down, 
Us, scattered leaves; eddied and broken; torn 
Roughly asunder; or in smooth mid-stream 
Divided each from other without pain; 
Collected in what looks like union, 
Yet is but stagnant chance,--stopping to rot 
By the same pebble till the tide shall turn; 
Then on, to find no shelter and no rest, 
Forever rootless and forever lone. 
Clouds on Thy sky. We do but move across 
The silent breast of Thy infinitude 
Which bears us all. We pour out day by day 
Our long, brief moan of mutability 
To Thine immutable--and cease. 
Yet still 
Our change yearns after Thine unchangedness; 
Our mortal craves Thine immortality; 
Our manifold and multiform and weak 
Imperfectness, requires the perfect ONE. 
For Thou art ONE, and we are all of Thee; 
Dropped from Thy bosom, as Thy sky drops down 
Its morning dews, which glitter for a space, 
Uncertain whence they fell, or whither tend, 
Till the great Sun arising on his fields 
Upcalls them all, and they rejoicing go. 

So, with like joy, O Light Eterne, we spring 
Thee-ward, and leave the pleasant fields of earth, 
Forgetting equally its blossomed green 
And its dry dusty paths which drank us up 
Remorseless,--we, poor humble drops of dew, 
That only wish to freshen a flower's breast, 
And be exhaled to heaven. 
O Thou supreme 
All-satisfying and immutable One, 
It is enough to be absorbed in Thee 
And vanish,--though 't were only to a voice 
That through all ages with perpetual joy 
          I will write a poem.

Delirious moon had
           picked me up from under the skin.

The safety pin was broken, 
           now a crowd will disrobe me.

Everytime when my pain makes you cry
            oranges are not meant for the sale.

A collegium will stich up the wound.
            Once upon a caste the country will go.






•	On reading Orange Crush of Simone Muench. 

Impart not esoteric truth to fools, 
Nor on molasses feed an ass. 
Do not sow seed in sandy beds, 
Nor waste your oil on cakes of bran. 

I offer prayers
renew the promise 
of my soul
at every smallest 
sin of life
repent, atone 
and daily sign 
the deal with devils
then ask forgiveness, 
mercy sweet, 
then daily gain 
some fatal apple, 
and daily lose my Paradise

Outside of the doorway to normalcy, 
I stand confined to a solitary existence
While society mocks me for eternity
I am merely a pariah behind the fence

An abnormality walking on the Earth, 
Wandering aimlessly while their eyes stare, 
Glowing with hatred since my birth, 
I am the outcast who you must beware

The King of Heaven has forsaken me, 
Every day, I pray and beg on my knees, 
Though survival continues to grow rougher

My eyes focus on the tempting blade
While the noose is another option
The hopeful light cannot reach the shade
Created by my bizarreness; time to die within

I prepare to vanish from the world unnoticed
My ultimate words immortalized and on the floor
I shall Cross the Rubicon, no one shall stop it
My imperfections will not curse the world any more

Before my transcendence is able to occur, 
I lay my eyes upon a piece of paper with a poem
Although very short, I could only concur
As the poem read the truth about who I am: 

"Perfection is unattainable, 
Seeking it is foolish, 
Our imperfections are the building blocks
For our individuality to shine
For our humanity to be reality
For you to be you, 
As you are amazing
And those who deny this are empty"Do not look at me in the eyes.

impermanent pressed my snow skies fold
above a line of liquid gold in the chill a. 

m.
I hear the crank and sighs; the steam rise, 

dreams of old radiators; happy at home
to be feeling this alive among

no more wandering wondering
under the Star and off from work
because the snow clouds fleece

flies thick as in the fairy tales when
the housekeepers of the skies
beat their pillows so fine into

the sodden crystal that sugar frost my windowpanes
and freedom.

continents shoving, crumpling down into the molten 
veins of fire deep in the earth and raising 
tons of rock into jagged crests of Sierra. 

Sometimes your hands drift on me, milkweed's 
airy silk, wingtip's feathery caresses, 
our lips grazing, a drift of desires gathering 
like fog over warm water, thickening to rain. 

Sometimes we go to it heartily, digging, 
burrowing, grunting, tossing up covers 
like loose earth, nosing into the other's 
flesh with hot nozzles and wallowing there. 

Sometimes we are kids making out, silly 
in the quilt, tickling the xylophone spine, 
blowing wet jokes, loud as a whole 
slumber party bouncing till the bed breaks. 

I go round and round you sometimes, scouting, 
blundering, seeking a way in, the high boxwood 
maze I penetrate running lungs bursting 
toward the fountain of green fire at the heart. 

Sometimes you open wide as cathedral doors 
and yank me inside. Sometimes you slither 
into me like a snake into its burrow. 
Sometimes you march in with a brass band. 

Ten years of fitting our bodies together 
and still they sing wild songs in new keys. 
It is more and less than love: timing, 
chemistry, magic and will and luck. 

One plus one equal one, unknowable except 
in the moment, not convertible into words, 
not explicable or philosophically interesting. 
But it is. And it is. And it is. Amen. 

Let me die and not tremble at death, 
But smile at the close of my day, 
And then, at the flight of my breath, 
Like a bird of the morning in May, 
Go chanting away. 

Let me die without fear of the dead, 
No horrors my soul shall dismay, 
And with faith's pillow under my head, 
With defiance to mortal decay, 
Go chanting away. 

Let me die like a son of the brave, 
And martial distinction display, 
Nor shrink from a thought of the grave, 
No, but with a smile from the clay, 
Go chanting away. 

Let me die glad, regardless of pain, 
No pang to this world to betray; 
And the spirit cut loose from its chain, 
So loath in the flesh to delay, 
Go chanting away. 

Let me die, and my worst foe forgive, 
When death veils the last vital ray; 
Since I have but a moment to live, 
Let me, when the last debt I pay, 
Go chanting away. 

Importing the blues
Listen  
Keys tickle
Horns make love
The haunting melody
Being sung 
Strings smile 

Look for the endless river
At the bottom of your soul
Where a mystic river of music flows  
Through the empty halls in your soul
There is were you will find the keys to 
Importing the blues from your soul


If you can stop the wind in its tireless march
If you can neutralize the sweet smile of the sun
If you can transform rain clouds into a desert
You may be able to stop me from loving youeverything in my life is impossible
nothing is plausible
im too young
to be hung
hung up on you
but everything i do
you're always there
i wish i didn't care
but i do
it's only you
i know its strong
i know it should be wrong
noone should feel like this
i'm too young to miss
just miss seeing you
i can't believe myself
this is affecting my mental health
my heartstrings are starting to whither
only you can can pull them together
you are my sickness
i cant believe this
and only you are my cure


Ha! Yes, I knew it, 
I knew I'd bring ya' to it! 
Titles that facinate
will always make you take the bait.
Now, Webster defines this term 
as not a very fascinating word, 
with not much spark or gleem 
in describing what it really means
which is: an inability to perform 
an action or task in norm/// 
inadequacy, incapability, 
incapacity, insufficiency 
and lack of eptitude, aplitude the 
inability to rule the roost! 
perhaps this term could use a little boost? ! 
Quite boring
I'm almost snoring. 
But it somehow made you muse
'bout scuttlebutting news. .! 
For shame, and down right lame. 
Do you have something to say? 

Oh, and, by the way and it's true. 
I would have read this poem just like you! 

Thanks for the read.  

Just having some late night fun, IS ALL


RSociety is a box, 
Straight lines and rectangles, 
No circles or triangles, 
No change in our pockets. 

In this world the biggest crime 
Is to term anyone unholy 
And the biggest lie is to be claimed
 By some one like divinity
In fact here none is devil 
Nor any one is like an angel 
Inside us we all nourish an animal 

Our success depends on 
How well we tame our pet 
And how well we harness our goodness 
By virtue of our deeds and contributions 
Done out of love 
But never for the fear of retribution 

We ask for more and more 
At the places of worships
As we never go to show any gratitude
 Or express our thanks  

The notion of charity appears 
By recognizing the infinite benevolence of nature
The purity of heart comes 
With the freedom of selfishness and desire 

The lower desires of us go 
When we are inspired to do better 
And moved by an urge to share 
As we become rich by what we give 
But impoverished we become when we only receive. 

See what a mass of gems the city wears 
Upon her broad live bosom! row on row 
Rubies and emeralds and amethysts glow. 
See! that huge circle like a necklace, stares 
With thousands of bold eyes to heaven, and dares 
The golden stars to dim the lamps below, 
And in the mirror of the mire I know 
The moon has left her image unawares. 

That's the great town at night: I see her breasts, 
Pricked out with lamps they stand like huge black towers. 
I think they move! I hear her panting breath. 
And that's her head where the tiara rests. 
And in her brain, through lanes as dark as death, 
Men creep like thoughts.  

The lamps are like pale flowersi pause for perfection earned (yours)   
And a reflection of days gone by. 
As this unfolding excellence is enough
While we gaze at a star lit sky.

Dreamers dream their own dreams. 
Their audience -  in balcony's ever high
The velvet curtain upon a grand stage (opens)   
So, too, the reflection's of days gone by.

The truth never leaves you (ever)   
As sure as actors know their lines. 
For once, they were merely caterpillar's crawling
Now as lofty butterflies perched upon the vine.

Pretend this is for the movies (partially)   
And for a child's idle play as time does, indeed, fly
Where 'reality' is as the footlight's shining brilliantly (always)   
So too, as my reflection's of my many days gone by.



April      Impressions

Important, first impressions, 
For we all seek to impress. 
Deceptive, first impressions, 
If we meet one in distress. 
Trust those first impressions
But account for man's duress. 

Important, first impressions, 
For they set acquaintance pace. 
Inclement first impressions
Many years may not erase, 
As friendship bears impressions
Of that first discomfort's trace. 

Reject the first impressions
Of one who would deceive
By flattering impressions, 
‘Tis a fool who would believe, 
And bitter last impressions
Are the insults you'll receive. 

The heart, which is wiser, 
Needs no mind's inclination
When impressions
Must be first
To be given consideration
Before they are weighed
And valued for application, 
Else, shadows of thought
Cast over an imposition, 
Deeper than reason
Penetrating imagination



the pigment you see.
Confidence, the lie, 
all, but me.

Doubts and fears, 
churning inside.
Hurt and anger, 
things I hide.

Persona a facade, 
a game of pretense.
Persona the wall, 
a wall immense. 

I
Phyllidula and the Spoils of Gouvernet

Where, Lady, are the days
When you could go out in a hired hansom
Without footmen and equipments?
And dine in a soggy, cheap restaurant?
Phyllidula now, with your powdered Swiss footman
Clanking the door shut,
and lying;
And carpets from Savonnier, and from Persia,
And your new service at dinner,
And plates from Germain,
And cabinets and chests from Martin (almost lacquer),
And your white vases from Japan,
And the lustre of diamonds,
Etcetera, etcetera, and etcetera?

II
To Madame du Chatelet

If you'd have me go on loving you
Give me back the time of the thing.

Will you give me dawn light at evening?
Time has driven me out from the fine plaisaunces,

The parks with the swards all over dew,
And grass going glassy with the light on it,
The green stretches where love is and the grapes
Hang in yellow-white and dark clusters ready for pressing.
And if now we can't fit with our time of life
There is not much but its evil left us.

Life gives us two minutes, two seasons
One to be dull in;
Two deaths and to stop loving and being lovable,
That is the real death,
The other is little beside it.

Crying after the follies gone by me,
Quiet talking is all that is left us
Gentle talking, not like the first talking, less lively;
And to follow after friendship, as they call it,
Weeping that we can follow naught else.

III
To Madame Lullin

You'll wonder that an old man of eighty
Can go on writing you verses. . . .

Grass showing under the snow,
Birds singing late in the year!

And Tibullus could say of his death, in his Latin:
'Delia, I would look on you, dying.'

And Delia herself fading out,
Forgetting even her beauty.

'I want to sleep the dream of the apples, 
to withdraw from the tumult of cemeteries
I want to sleep the dream of that child
who wanted to cut his heart on the high seas.'
-Federico Garcia-Lorca


of the child who wanted to cut his heart
on poetry of the child with the silvered over voice
fretted into diamonds continually; the child

set like a jewel on green velvet, set like a jewel; 
like starlight scissored out of the skies by other children
for a keepsake.  Mama?  see? 
and far away and here in both castles, simultaneously.

of the child who was cut, who was cut like moonlight
out of nocturnes endlessly
lamenting, pedaled over now:  a silence like snow; 

far off, like lunar snow.
and in the gardens of the kings not so mysteriously disappearing so that
even the roses whisper in the clouded nights: 
there is no more music like this.

and the trees on green velvet sobbing diamonds suddenly
for the breezes too young to know the voice
they will not carry now.

and the cut carnations in the vases of the Princess forming
no fit bouquets.
and the olive winds tossing the fevered ship

no longer.

Of where the beast had been before
Bones and feathers everywhere
From something that was in the air
Brought down by Buzzards for their tea
A grizzly sight for poor old me


My soles left imprints as I trod on autumn leaves
My heart was lifted by the feeling of the ground
This time of year is like no other season
I love the feeling, for that very reason

My breath was like a smokescreen from my mouth
The cold making it seem like I was smoking
The scene I set was very thought provoking
I revel in the way it makes me feel

The sound of crunching leaves as I walked on
The chillness of the ground that I trod on
The photographic scenes logged in my mind
Recalled when I feel down, from time to time

A favourite walk, in woods so close to home
Walking with the dogs, and yet, alone
I love the morning frost and the chill air
How wonderful I feel at home right there


On a young girl showing me a scar on her cheek where a stick of wood struck her.

In its own place 'tis very good 
Always to have plenty of wood ;
But, striking fair maid, that is rude,
And puts me in an angry mood.

'Where art thou wandering, little child?'
I said to one I met to-day.--
She pushed her bonnet up and smiled,
'I'm going upon the green to play:
Folks tell me that the May's in flower,
That cowslip-peeps are fit to pull,
And I've got leave to spend an hour
To get this little basket full.'

--And thou'st got leave to spend an hour!
My heart repeated.--She was gone;
--And thou hast heard the thorn's in flower,
And childhood's bliss is urging on:
Ah, happy child! thou mak'st me sigh,
This once as happy heart of mine,
Would nature with the boon comply,
How gladly would I change for thine. 

When from your gems of thought I turn 
To those pure orbs, your heart to learn, 
I scarce know which to prize most high — 
The bright i-dea, or the bright dear-eye. 

Before you, silently I sway.
I feel so anxious when you’re near me,
In vain, I cast a glance your way:
I’m sure that I will never say,
What I’m imagining so freely. 

Ancient Text have this not.
This feeling: never been recorded.
it is not love.
it is not infatuation.
It is a desire to give you my whole self, 
all of me.
and I ask nothing at all in return.
This is pure romanticism at its most potent.
It is a guilt free drug, most addictive. 




Yes, yes ! that boon, life's richest treat
He had, or fancied that he had ;
Say, 'twas but in his own conceit--
     The fancy made him glad !
Crown of his cup, and garnish of his dish !
The boon, prefigured in his earliest wish,
The fair fulfilment of his poesy,
When his young heart first yearn'd for sympathy !
But e'en the meteor offspring of the brain
     Unnourished wane ;
Faith asks her daily bread,
And Fancy must be fed !
Now so it chanced--from wet or dry,
It boots not how--I know not why--
She missed her wonted food ; and quickly
Poor Fancy stagger'd and grew sickly.
Then came a restless state, 'twixt yea and nay,
His faith was fix'd, his heart all ebb and flow ;
Or like a bark, in some half-shelter'd bay,
Above its anchor driving to and fro.

That boon, which but to have possess'd
In a belief, gave life a zest--
Uncertain both what it had been,
And if by error lost, or luck ;
And what is was ;--an evergreen
Which some insidious blight had struck,
Or annual flower, which, past its blow,
No vernal spell shall e'er revive ;
Uncertain, and afraid to know,
     Doubts toss'd him to and fro :
Hope keeping Love, Love Hope alive,
Like babes bewildered in a snow,
That cling and huddle from the cold
In hollow tree or ruin'd fold.

Those sparkling colours, once his boast
     Fading, one by one away,
Thin and hueless as a ghost,
     Poor Fancy on her sick bed lay ;
Ill at distance, worse when near,
Telling her dreams to jealous Fear !
Where was it then, the sociable sprite,
That crown'd the Poet's cup and deck'd his dish !
Poor shadow cast from an unsteady wish,
Itself a substance by no other right
But that it intercepted Reason's light ;
It dimm'd his eye, it darken'd on his brow,
A peevish mood, a tedious time, I trow !
     Thank Heaven ! 'tis not so now.

O bliss of blissful hours !
The boon of Heaven's decreeing,
While yet in Eden's bowers
Dwelt the first husband and his sinless mate !
The one sweet plant, which, piteous Heaven agreeing,
They bore with them thro' Eden's closing gate !
Of life's gay summer tide the sovran Rose !
Late autumn's Amaranth, that more fragrant blows
When Passion's flowers all fall or fade ;
If this were ever his, in outward being,
Or but his own true love's projected shade,
Now that at length by certain proof he knows,
That whether real or a magic show,
Whate'er it was, it is no longer so ;
Though heart be lonesome, Hope laid low,
Yet, Lady ! deem him not unblest :
The certainty that struck Hope dead,
Hath left Contentment in her stead :
     And that is next to Best 


In a bed of thorned roses. Always try to love those closest. Even with pain so unbearable. I will deny the attraction. Its this immense chemical reaction. I wish I could say I love you. But you look the other way. Hate me today, hate me tomorrow. Oh how I wish the sorrow wouldn't make me feel so hollow. Cold am I till the day I die. I would cry if it allowed me heal. What is real? How should I feel. Protecting myself from a fate unknown. So alone. Raise in a broken home. I'm fighting my soul for control. Its mine damn it I'm too close to just let go. To only know something a little less shallow. Where are my values. Ive been suck in a machine that keeps asking, more change please. Climbing over the shoulders of great men. Thank god for what I have been given. Pray that this isn't the end of a friend. If so I blame it on my god damn ambition. It created a barrier around me. It wont let anybody in. Nothing will be ever be forgiven. Not even worth trying. Because my heart already dieing. In a bed of thorned roses

Over the yawning chimney hangs the fog. Drip -- hiss -- drip -- hiss --
fall the raindrops on the oaken log which burns, and steams,
and smokes the ceiling beams. Drip -- hiss -- the rain never stops.


The wide, state bed shivers beneath its velvet coverlet. Above, dim,
in the smoke, a tarnished coronet gleams dully. Overhead hammers and chinks
the rain. Fearfully wails the wind down distant corridors, and there comes
the swish and sigh of rushes lifted off the floors. The arras blows sidewise
out from the wall, and then falls back again.


It is my lady's key, confided with much nice cunning, whisperingly.
He enters on a sob of wind, which gutters the candles almost to swaling.
The fire flutters and drops. Drip -- hiss -- the rain never stops.
He shuts the door. The rushes fall again to stillness along the floor.
Outside, the wind goes wailing.


The velvet coverlet of the wide bed is smooth and cold. Above,
in the firelight, winks the coronet of tarnished gold. The knight shivers
in his coat of fur, and holds out his hands to the withering flame.
She is always the same, a sweet coquette. He will wait for her.

How the log hisses and drips! How warm and satisfying will be her lips!


It is wide and cold, the state bed; but when her head lies under the coronet,
and her eyes are full and wet with love, and when she holds out her arms,
and the velvet counterpane half slips from her, and alarms
her trembling modesty, how eagerly he will leap to cover her, and blot himself
beneath the quilt, making her laugh and tremble.

Is it guilt to free a lady from her palsied lord, absent and fighting,
terribly abhorred?


He stirs a booted heel and kicks a rolling coal. His spur clinks
on the hearth. Overhead, the rain hammers and chinks. She is so pure
and whole. Only because he has her soul will she resign herself to him,
for where the soul has gone, the body must be given as a sign. He takes her
by the divine right of the only lover. He has sworn to fight her lord,
and wed her after. Should he be overborne, she will die adoring him, forlorn,
shriven by her great love.

Above, the coronet winks in the darkness. Drip -- hiss -- fall the raindrops.
The arras blows out from the wall, and a door bangs in a far-off hall.


The candles swale. In the gale the moat below plunges and spatters.
Will the lady lose courage and not come?

The rain claps on a loosened rafter.

Is that laughter?


The room is filled with lisps and whispers. Something mutters.
One candle drowns and the other gutters. Is that the rain
which pads and patters, is it the wind through the winding entries
which chatters?

The state bed is very cold and he is alone. How far from the wall
the arras is blown!


clasping someone! Through the sobbing storm he hears her love take form
and flutter out in words. They prick into his ears and stun his desire,
which lies within him, hard and dead, like frozen fire. And the little noise
never stops.

Drip -- hiss -- the rain drops.



He tears down the arras from before an inner chamber's bolted door.


II

The state bed shivers in the watery dawn. Drip -- hiss -- fall the raindrops.
For the storm never stops.

On the velvet coverlet lie two bodies, stripped and fair in the cold,
grey air. Drip -- hiss -- fall the blood-drops, for the bleeding never stops.
The bodies lie quietly. At each side of the bed, on the floor, is a head.
A man's on this side, a woman's on that, and the red blood oozes along
the rush mat.

A wisp of paper is twisted carefully into the strands of the dead man's hair.
for the high favour.'

Through the lady's silver fillet is wound another paper. It reads,
necklace of beads. But I have engaged that, on your return,
she shall welcome you here. She will not spurn your love as before,
you have still the best part of her. Her blood was red, her body white,
they will both be here for your delight. The soul inside was a lump of dirt,
I have rid you of that with a spurt of my sword point. Good luck
to your pleasure. She will be quite complaisant, my friend, I wager.'
The end was a splashed flourish of ink.

Hark! In the passage is heard the clink of armour, the tread of a heavy man.
The door bursts open and standing there, his thin hair wavering


Over the yawning chimney hangs the fog. Drip -- hiss -- drip -- hiss --
fall the raindrops. Overhead hammers and chinks the rain which never stops.

The velvet coverlet is sodden and wet, yet the roof beams are tight.
Overhead, the coronet gleams with its blackened gold, winking and blinking.
Among the rushes three corpses are growing cold.

In the castle church you may see them stand,
Two sumptuous tombs on either hand
In sculptured filigrees. And where the transepts of the church expand,
A crusader, come from the Holy Land,
Lies with crossed legs and embroidered band.
The page's name became a brand
For shame. He was buried in crawling sand,
After having been burnt by royal command. 

That flower unseen, that gem of purest ray, 
Bright thoughts uncut by men: 
Strange that you need but speak them, Thomas Gray, 
And the mind skips and dives beyond its ken, 

Finding at once the wild supposed bloom, 
Or in the imagined cave 
Some pulse of crystal staving off the gloom
As covertly as phosphorus in a grave.

Void notions proper to a buried head! 
Beneath these tombstones here 
Unseenness fills the sockets of the dead, 
Whatever to their souls may now appear; 

And who but those unfathomably deaf
Who quiet all this ground
Could catch, within the ear's diminished clef, 
A music innocent of time and sound? 

What do the living hear, then, when the bell
Hangs plumb within the tower
Of the still church, and still their thoughts compel
Pure tollings that intend no mortal hour? 

As when a ferry for the shore of death
Glides looming toward the dock, 
Her engines cut, her spirits bating breath
As the ranked pilings narrow toward the shock, 

So memory and expectation set 
Some pulseless clangor free
Of circumstance, and charm us to forget 
This twilight crumbling in the churchyard tree, 

Those swifts or swallows which do not pertain, 
Scuffed voices in the drive, 
That light flicked on behind the vestry pane, 
Till, unperplexed from all that is alive, 

It shadows all our thought, balked imminence
Of uncommitted sound, 
And still would tower at the sill of sense
Were not, as now, its honeyed abeyance crowned

With a mauled boom of summons far more strange
Than any stroke unheard, 
Which breaks again with unimagined range
Through all reverberations of the word, 

Pooling the mystery of things that are, 
The buzz of prayer said, 
The scent of grass, the earliest-blooming star, 
These unseen gravestones, and the darker dead. 


I wrote this note just simply as it is
A note for you from my soul with a kiss

Your shadow filled my empty room
Your voice as if music bounced in my dome

Your presence when you said hello
It took away my blue, my room glowed

As you touched me, it eased my pain
As you talked to me, it stopped the rain

With you, my despair was blown
I, my heart and soul felt the comfort zone

So thank you, as simply as it is
This note was sealed with a kiss


In a dark time, the eye begins to see, 
I meet my shadow in the deepening shade; 
I hear my echo in the echoing wood-- 
A lord of nature weeping to a tree. 
I live between the heron and the wren, 
Beasts of the hill and serpents of the den. 
What's madness but nobility of soul 
At odds with circumstance? The day's on fire! 
I know the purity of pure despair, 
My shadow pinned against a sweating wall. 
That place among the rocks--is it a cave, 
Or a winding path? The edge is what I have. 

A steady storm of correspondences! 
A night flowing with birds, a ragged moon, 
And in broad day the midnight come again! 
A man goes far to find out what he is-- 
Death of the self in a long, tearless night, 
All natural shapes blazing unnatural light. 

Dark, dark my light, and darker my desire. 
My soul, like some heat-maddened summer fly, 
Keeps buzzing at the sill. Which I is I? 
A fallen man, I climb out of my fear. 
And one is One, free in the tearing wind. 

The living come with grassy tread
To read the gravestones on the hill;
The graveyard draws the living still,
But never anymore the dead.
The verses in it say and say:
"The ones who living come today
To read the stones and go away
Tomorrow dead will come to stay

"
So sure of death the marbles rhyme,
Yet can't help marking all the time
How no one dead will seem to come.
What is it men are shrinking from?
It would be easy to be clever
And tell the stones: Men hate to die
And have stopped dying now forever.
I think they would believe the lie. 

A world created in a dream, 
otherworldly, 
and serene.

Lazed in a chaise, 
Her robe loosely tied around her waist.
A bare breast, 
exposed through the open window
to the neighborhood.

One arm dangling out the open glass
the other holding a Shiraz.
The glass absent.

There is no reason for poise
when drinking alone.





The smoke from a lit cigarette
billowing through the empty house.

Softly, 
spoken from the next room, 
'What kind of relationship are you looking for? '

A tear
softens the harsh line of her eyeliner, 
and drips black down her cheek
into the crease of her mouth.

No need for company
when you can create your own.

No need for a reply
when a question is asked
by a shaddow, 
invented by her own imagination.

'What am I to you?  Did you ever love me? '


She did
and
she does.

She puts the mouth of the bottle to her lips.
Her face: swollen.
Her eyes: red.
Her voice: choked.

And in the darkness of the afternoon
she takes her leave.

And in a whisp of cigarette smoke
smoldering in the ashtray
she exhales.

And behind her breast
her heart still beats, 
but she is forever gone. 

at fifty I approach myself,
eighteen years of age,
seated despondently on the concrete steps
of my father's house,
wishing to be gone from there
into my own life,
and I tell my young self,
Nothing will turn out right,
you'll want to avenge yourself,
on those close to you especially,
and they will want to die
of shock and grief. You will fall
to pleading and tears of self-pity,
filled with yourself, a passionate stranger.
My eighteen-year-old self stands up
from the concrete steps and says,
Go to hell,
and I walk off. 

There will a new President
Within a matter of days.
Countless citizens are hesitant; 
Now, they will have to alter their ways.

I do not know if that's good or not.
They say that the new guy is a nut.
We'll have to wait and see
If he will build a tower deep in the sea.

'Oh! Everything will be fantastic', 
He said repeatedly, like a parrot, 
Almost like a nerdy robot.

Being flamboyant is like a mystic
Way of doing things. Let the bells ring.
Please let the sad eagles sing. 

Gushing from the mouths of stone men
To spread at ease under the sky
In granite-lipped basins,
Where iris dabble their feet
And rustle to a passing wind,
The water fills the garden with its rushing,
In the midst of the quiet of close-clipped lawns.

Damp smell the ferns in tunnels of stone,
Where trickle and plash the fountains,
Marble fountains, yellowed with much water.

Splashing down moss-tarnished steps
It falls, the water;
And the air is throbbing with it.
With its gurgling and running.
With its leaping, and deep, cool murmur.

And I wished for night and you.
I wanted to see you in the swimming-pool,
White and shining in the silver-flecked water.
While the moon rode over the garden,
High in the arch of night,
And the scent of the lilacs was heavy with stillness.

Night, and the water, and you in your whiteness, bathing



In it there are ribbons
and bags
for drowning out a voice of an embarrassing Dad.

There are a few 
Abacrombie models, 
which come first, by far.

There is an entirely new colour, 
An entirely new clothing line, 
An entirely new sweet.

There is a glass pool
with a party inside.

There is the sea
turned upside down.

There is a fox with no brush.
A pack of cards without an Ace.
A land with no sky.

Somewhere in the corner of a girl’s head lies
a spark of friendship and a glow of love.



In a golden desert field  sparrows played.
The sun beamed down from heaven, there was little shade
While the ravens circled over keeping watch
The sparrows kept right on playing, they didn't stop
Along came some chipmunks to join in the game
Two squirrels in the distance wanted the same
So they came over and started a fun chase
Four brown bunnies set up to investigate
While the wind softly blowing carried the voice
Of the robins singing their song of choice
I sat there and watched in amazement
Thinking have I died and to heaven went


In a single heartbeat
she can change
and turn her head away.

In a single heartbeat
time moves on
and she's hand in hand
with someone else.

In a single heartbeat
plus a single heartbeat
plus a hundred more
will eventually turn into
eternity.

In a single heartbeat
he can change
and never let her go.

In a single heartbeat
plus a single heartbeat
can make a new beat
and keep love whole. 


In a lonely place, 
I encountered a sage 
Who sat, all still, 
Regarding a newspaper. 
He accosted me: 
'Sir, what is this? ' 
Then I saw that I was greater, 
Aye, greater than this sage. 
I answered him at once, 
'Old, old man, it is the wisdom of the age.' 
The sage looked upon me with admiration. 



OVER the long salt ridges 
And the gold sea-poppies between, 
They builded them wild-briar hedges, 
A church and a cloistered green. 
And when they were done with their praises, 
And the tides on the Fore beat slow, 
Under the white cliff-daisies 
They laid them down in a row.

Porphyry, Paul, and Peter, 
Jasper, and Joachim,– 
Was the psaltery music sweeter 
Than the throat of the thrush to him ? 
Tired of their drones and their dirges, 
Where the young cliff-rabbits play, 
Wet with the salt of the surges, 
They laid them down for a day. 


One may not call to the other 
There on the rim of the deep, 
Only the youngest brother 
Lies and smiles in his sleep. 
When the wild swan's shadow passes, 
When the ripe fruit falls to the sod, 
When the faint moth flies in the grasses 

Here for his hopes there follow 
The violets one by one. 
The dove is here and the swallow 
And the young leaf seeking the sun. 
And here when the last sail darkens 
And the last lone path is trod, 
Under the rose he harkens 


I.

The poem is important, but
not more than the people
whose survival it serves,

one of the necessities, so they may
speak what is true, and have
the patience for beauty: the weighted

grainfield, the shady street,
the well-laid stone and the changing tree
whose branches spread above.

For want of songs and stories
they have dug away the soil,
paved over what is left,

set up their perfunctory walls
in tribute to no god,
for the love of no man or woman,

so that the good that was here
cannot be called back
except by long waiting, by great

sorrows remembered and to come
by invoking the thunderstones
of the world, and the vivid air.

II.

The poem is important,
as the want of it
proves. It is the stewardship

of its own possibility,
the past remembering itself
in the presence of

the present, the power learned
and handed down to see
what is present

and what is not: the pavement
laid down and walked over
regardlessly--by exiles, here

only because they are passing.
Oh, remember the oaks that were
here, the leaves, purple and brown,

falling, the nuthatches walking
headfirst down the trunks,
crying "onc! onc!" in the brightness

as they are doing now
in the cemetery across the street
where the past and the dead

keep each other. To remember,
to hear and remember, is to stop
and walk on again

to a livelier, surer measure.
It is dangerous
to remember the past only

for its own sake, dangerous
to deliver a message
you did not get. 


FRAGRANT are the cedar-boughs stretching green and level,
Feasting-halls where waxwings flit at their spicy revel,
But O the pine, the questing pine, that flings its arms on high
To search the secret of the sun and escalade the sky!
Rueful hemlocks, gaunt and old, with boughs a-droop, despairing,
Clutch for touch of mother-earth; the while the pine is daring
To rock the stars amid its cones and lull them with its croon,
And snare the silver eagle that is nested in the moon. 


The sentencing goes blithely on its way
And takes the playfully objected rhyme
As surely as it takes the stroke and time
In having its undeviable say. 

The sentencing blithely on its way
And takes the playfully objected rhyme
As surely as it keeps the stroke and time
In having its undeviable say. 


A battalion 
of sun loungers

march down
to the sea

where wavelets 
dash off a quick signature

oce more
&
once more

as if signing for
the browning bodies

that one by one
(or by   

fill up
the empty loungers

with sweating
humanity

in all shapes
& sizes

all worshiping
with these their bodies

the great golden orb
of the sky. 


Any minute anything can happen
Human beings
have no control
over that! 
accidents emergencies
life or death
in the hands of fate
In a sense of speaking
Some of us
walk and some of us 
crawl
Some of us
have more happiness
Some of us
have more pain
As human beings
we cannot control the world
In a sense of speaking
the world controls us


Just taking a bath

Why some singing, awful song? 

Bad odor maybe? 


They wish to depict. 
Others as being threatening and wicked.
And yet. 
They leave death.
Wherever they step. 
To be greeted in peace.
As they give these perceptions, 
Upon such meetings! 

Those unsuspecting, 
Find themselves unexpectedly inspected.
And defending against those appearing as sheep. 
With sharpened teeth! 
Equipped with anesthetics. 
With dosages to put all to sleep, 
In a slow acceptance! 
With an essence expected! 

We hasten and chasten 'His will' to make known. 


'WHEN the tall bamboos are clicking to the restless little breeze,   
And bats begin their jerky skimming flight,   
And the creamy scented blossoms of the dark pittosporum trees,   
Grow sweeter with the coming of the night.   
 
And the harbour in the distance lies beneath a purple pall,           
And nearer, at the garden’s lowest fringe,   
Loud the water soughs and gurgles ’mid the rocks below the wall,   
Dark-heaving, with a dim uncanny tinge   
 
Of a green as pale as beryls, like the strange faint-coloured flame   
That burns around the Women of the Sea:           
And the strip of sky to westward which the camphorlaurels frame,   
Has turned to ash-of-rose and ivory—   
 
And a chorus rises valiantly from where the crickets hide,   
Close-shaded by the balsams drooping down—   
It is evening in a garden by the kindly water-side,           
A garden near the lights of Sydney town


I had thought at one time, 
We were all being cursed. 
With a sudden and unstoppable, 
Burst of flowing ignorance.
Until I awakened to realize. 
I wasn't the only one not chasing, 
The overwhelming blinding effect. 
Of the color of money.
With a wish to get as much of it, 
As I could get in a stampede rushing.
Or believed it controlled and ruled my life. 


The apparition of these faces in the crowd; 
petals on a wet, black bough. 


If a doing causes you undo strife, 
Why is it there in your life to live? 
And. 
If tears appear to flow and drop, 
Nonstop from your swollen eyes.
Why do you continue to hide your sighs? 
Why do you keep this undenied inside? 


Do you need someone that bad, 
That keeps you sad? 
Is a love you never had bestowing lots of sorrow? 
Don't wait too late in a suffered suffocating.
Why smother yourself just to survive? 

Open up the door and create some new rules.
Only you can change that attitude to choose.
And live your life to free from fear.
Open up the door and create some new rules.
Only you can change 'that' attitude. 
With a doing only you can choose, 
To know a happiness just for you.


If a doing causes you undo strife, 
Why is it there in your life to live? 
Don't wait too late in a suffered suffocating.
Why smother yourself just to survive? 
Open up the door and create some new rules.
Only you can change 'that' attitude. 
With a doing only you can choose, 
To know a happiness just for you. 
To be done and to do. 


Before me,
On either side of me,
I see sand.
If I turn the corner of my house,
I see sand,
Long, brown
Lines and levels of flat
Sand.

If I could only see a caravan
Heave over the edge of it:
The camels wobbling and swaying,
Stepping like ostriches,
With rocking palanquins
Whose curtains conceal
Languors and faintnesses,
Muslins tossed aside,
And a disorder of cushions.
The swinging curtains would pique and solace me.
But I only see sand,
Long, brown sand -
Sand.

If I could only see a herd of Arab horses
Galloping,
Their manes and tails pulled straight
By the speed of their going;
Their bodies sleek and round
Like bellying sails.
They would beat the sand with their fore feet,
And scatter it with their hind feet,
So that it whirled in a cloud of orange,
And the sun through it
Was clip-edged, without rays, and dun.
But I only see sand,
Long, brown, hot sand -
Sand.

If I could only see a mirage,
Blue-white at the horizon,
With palm-trees about it;
Tall, windless palm-trees, grouped about a-glitter.
If I could strain toward it,
And think of the water creeping round my ankles,
Tickling under my knees,
Leeching up my sides,
Spreading over my back.
But I only feel the grinding beneath my feet.
And I only see sand,
Long, dry sand,
Scorching sand -
Sand.

If a sand-storm would only come
And spit against my windows,
Snapping upon them, and ringing their vibrations;
Swirling over the roof;
Seeping under the door-jamb;
Suffocating me and making me struggle for air.
But I only see sand -
Sand lying dead in the sun.
Lines and lines of sand -
Sand.


I will paste newspapers over the windows to shut out the sand;
I will fit them into one another, and fasten the corners.
Then I will strike matches
And read of politics and murders and festivals
Three years old.
But I shall not see the sand any more,
And I can read
While my matches last. 


One of the twain was long and dusty grey,
And like a spark that in the ashes lies,
Satiric laughter glinted in his eyes
And made his nose auroral with its ray:
The other like a huge black bird of prey,
His hat enorm, his pipe of awful size,
His coat hung empty-sleeved in careless wise,
Loomed a fat angel from the pit astray.
A voice was booming ever: laugh and jeer
Mingled with noble praise of battling right,
And verse and girls were mixed with radiant beer
And all the city tram was given sight
Of the invisible dark and bidden hear
Unsplashing silence of the pouring light. 


My existance 'tis oft' times questioned
Seemingly lacking in presence of mind
Yet abreast of all necessary import
I am oft' elusive and difficult to find; 
Without my assuring words of adoration
Lacking my gentle nod of assent
Totally void of the wink of my eye
Leaves some totally incenced; 
Privacy 'tis my needful armor
Leaving me oft' times simply away
At times i am overwhelmed by too much attention
Seems these walls have ears yet today; 
In a world of back handed abuse
Where connections make this world ever small
I truly am getting quite fed up
With the Electrical Guru's gall; 
So, if fear 'twas what they were looking for
Intimidation-by their so-called being everywhere
I will not be their long suffering victim
As i promise to strip their reality bare; 
In the meantime, i will again withdraw unto shelter
I will again absent my place: ' on the air'
Overwhelmed by such a deluge of unwelcomed intrusions
Am at my Wits End-i retire from life, in solemn prayer;


In all honesty
today has been
something out of the ordinary.

In all honesty
I could do with some christmas carols
and a mug of hot chocolate.

In all honesty
walking on the road without a sidewalk
is more exhilerating than anything else.

In all honesty
watching fog settle over the road
can bring tears to anyones eyes.

In all honesty
you're the only person
I'm mostly honest to.

In all honesty
this poem
is entirely honest. 


In my young years I took pride in the fact that luck was called a lady. In fact, there were so few public acknowledgments of the female presence that I felt personally honored whenever nature and large ships were referred to as feminine. But as I matured, I began to resent being considered a sister to a changeling as fickle as luck, as aloof as an ocean, and as frivolous as nature. The phrase 'A woman always has the right to change her mind' played so aptly into the negative image of the female that I made myself a victim to an unwavering decision. Even if I made an inane and stupid choice, I stuck by it rather than 'be like a woman and change my mind.'

Being a woman is hard work. Not without joy and even ecstasy, but still relentless, unending work. Becoming an old female may require only being born with certain genitalia, inheriting long-living genes and the fortune not to be run over by an out-of-control truck, but to become and remain a woman command the existence and employment of genius.

The woman who survives intact and happy must be at once tender and tough. She must have convinced herself, or be in the unending process of convincing herself, that she, her values, and her choices are important. In a time a nd world where males hold sway and control, the pressure upon women to yield their rights-of-way is tremendous. And it is under those very circumstances that the woman's toughness must be in evidence.

She must resist considering herself a lesser version of her male counterpart. She is not a sculptress, poetess, authoress, Jewess, Negress, or even (now rare) in university parlance a rectoress. If she is the thing, then for her own sense of self and for the education of the ill-informed she must insist with rectitude in being the thing and in being called the thing.

A rose by any other name may smell as sweet, but a woman called by a devaluing name will only be weakened by the misnomer. She will need to prize her tenderness and be able to display it at appropriate times in order to prevent toughness from gaining total authority and to avoid becoming a mirror image of those men who value power above life, and control over love.

It is imperative that a woman keep her sense of humor intact and at the ready. She must see, even if only in secret, that she is the funniest, looniest woman in her world, which she should also see as being the most absurd world of all times. It has been said that laughter is therapeutic and amiability lengthens the life span. Women should be tough, tender, laugh as much as possible, and live long lives. The struggle for equality continues unabated, and the woman warrior who is armed with wit and courage will be among the first to celebrate victory. 





If there is nothing in an empty box, 
what do you do? 
You use an amazing thing called
imagination.

In a corner of the empty box was, 
A long lasting friendship.
A pattern with no end.
A light that will never go out.

In a corner of the empty box was, 
A devil, red as blood.
An ongoing argument.
A heart with no love.

In a corner of the empty box was, 
A charming prince waiting for his love.
A shimmering diamond, with an everlasting twinkle.
A sea with dancing waters.

As there are only four corners of a box, 
this is the last one, and in that corner there was, 
A patch of growing love.
A mind with no thoughts.
A bottle with a secret message inside.

There is always a middle of an empty box, 
and in the middle there was, 
a smaller box.
Which held every thought anyone could think.





In this old garden, fair, I walk to-day
Heart-charmed with all the beauty of the scene:
The rich, luxuriant grasses' cooling green,
The wall's environ, ivy-decked and gray,
The waving branches with the wind at play,
The slight and tremulous blooms that show between,
Sweet all: and yet my yearning heart doth lean
Toward Love's Egyptian fleshpots far away.

Beside the wall, the slim Laburnum grows
And flings its golden flow'rs to every breeze.
But e'en among such soothing sights as these,
I pant and nurse my soul-devouring woes.
Of all the longings that our hearts wot of,
There is no hunger like the want of love

A crackling fire. Light, heat in the felucca.
Pikes in the water. Pearl-white sand below.
The trident now! You'll get one if you're lucky.
Go slow, don't rush. A blow! Another blow!

A nightmare passion. Horror mixed with bliss.
Blood, writhing fish- Before it makes you sicker
You'd better stop. Come, douse the flames. Move quicker.
Push it all overboard!.. Smoke. Steam. A hiss.

The air feels light and cool. The shadows deepen.
Dim stars appear and flicker in the sky.
The boat rocks on the waves. The fish are sleeping.
Stretched on the stern, flat on my back I lie.

The oarlocks knock - how soft the sound and cheery!
A night at sea is never dull or dreary. 



You ask me for a sonnet. Ah, my Dear,
Can clocks tick back to yesterday at noon?
Can cracked and fallen leaves recall last June
And leap up on the boughs, now stiff and sere?
For your sake, I would go and seek the year,
Faded beyond the purple ranks of dune,
Blown sands of drifted hours, which the moon
Streaks with a ghostly finger, and her sneer
Pulls at my lengthening shadow. Yes, 'tis that!
My shadow stretches forward, and the ground
Is dark in front because the light's behind.
It is grotesque, with such a funny hat,
In watching it and walking I have found
More than enough to occupy my mind.


I cannot turn, the light would make me blind. 


Here in ashes do my tears now lie
for every dropp filled with unrequited love did i cry
a smile that always cloud my sky
hear in ashes do my tears lie

I  cannot smile a smile
but in one's eye its decieving
i cannot smile a smile
behind it lies choked words

words that i even hide from myself
it makes my tears taste even bitter
it makes the pain in my heart grow stronger and stronger
this smile is just a lie


so slowly is my smile fading
so slowly its secret is revealing
and so quickly im trying to stop the tears
but i cannot stop this secret from revealing the truth

i cannot hide the pain in my heart no more
i cannot hide the tears with laughter no more
all i can do is let it out
and slowly will it reveal the truth of what i have hidden for so long.


BESIDE the country road with truant grace
Wild carrot lifts its circles of white lace.
From vines whose interwoven branches drape
The old stone walls, come pungent scents of grape.
The sumach torches burn; the hardhack glows;
From off the pines a healing fragrance blows;
The pallid Indian pipe of ghostly kin
Listens in vain for stealthy moccasin.
In pensive mood a faded robin sings;
A butterfly with dusky, gold-flecked wings
Holds court for plumy dandelion seed
And thistledown, on throne of fireweed.
The road goes loitering on, till it hath missed
Its way in goldenrod, to keep a tryst,
Beyond the mosses and the ferns that veil
The last faint lines of its forgotten trail,
With Lonely Lake, so crystal clear that one
May see its bottom sparkling in the sun
With many-colored stones. The only stir
On its green banks is of the kingfisher
Dipping for prey, but oft, these haunted nights,
That mirror shivers into dazzling lights,
Cleft by a falling star, a messenger
From some bright battle lost, Excalibur. 


From the great trees the locusts cry
In quavering ecstatic duo-a boy
Shouts a wild call-a mourning dove
In the blue distance sobs-the wind
Wanders by, heavy with odors
Of corn and wheat and melon vines;
The trees tremble with delirious joy as the breeze
Greets them, one by one-now the oak
Now the great sycamore, now the elm.


And the locusts in brazen chorus, cry
Like stricken things, and the ring-dove's note
Sobs on in the dim distance. 

I know there are those who ask: Why does he not
sing with the same wild harmonies as before?
But they have not seen the labors of an hour
the work of a minute, the prodigies of a year.


I am an aged tree that, when I was growing.
uttered a vague, sweet sound when the breeze caressed me.
The time for youthful smiles has now passed by:
now, let the hurricane swirl my heart to song


railroad yard in San Jose 
I wandered desolate 
in front of a tank factory 
and sat on a bench 
near the switchman's shack. 


A flower lay on the hay on 
the asphalt highway 
--the dread hay flower 
I thought--It had a 
brittle black stem and 
corolla of yellowish dirty 
crown, and a soiled 
dry center cotton tuft 
like a used shaving brush 
that's been lying under 
the garage for a year. 

Yellow, yellow flower, and 
flower of industry, 
tough spiky ugly flower, 
flower nonetheless, 
with the form of the great yellow 
Rose in your brain! 
This is the flower of the World. 


In beauty we dwell
Blooming stark from spring, 
Who moves with flight, 
Seasons the air
In our abode
Concrete as gleam
Novelised with boons
Built in rock-like base
To glow as Eden.
Our hands knitted
With bond fixed glue-like, 
Rendered firm as steel.


Close as we nurture
Our hearts ring-mutual, 
Like in the garden
To sprout as flowers free
To ascend and sing.
No how the earthquakes, 
The volcanoes, 
The hurricanes, 
The tsunamis, 
The forest fire, 
Can ever sever
The cord of our love


Jane looks down at her organdy skirt
As if it somehow were the thing disgraced,
For being there, on the floor, in the dirt,
And she catches it up about her waist,
Smooths it out along one hip,
And pulls it over the crumpled slip.

On the porch, green-shuttered, cool,
Asleep is Bertram that bronze boy,
Who, having wound her around a spool,
Sends her spinning like a toy
Out to the garden, all alone,
To sit and weep on a bench of stone.

Soon the purple dark must bruise
Lily and bleeding-heart and rose,
And the little cupid lose
Eyes and ears and chin and nose,
And Jane lie down with others soon,
Naked to the naked moon.

In grayish doubt and black despair,
I drafted hymns to the earth and the air,
pretending to joy, although I lacked it.
The age had made lament redundant.


So here's the question -- who can answer it --
Was he a brave man or a hypocrite

We got a black-and-white television set
in about with prominent dials
an indoor aerial, and a curve-corner screen
that told you things straight.


Colour replaced black and white in the '
so that the TV screen got closer to reality
and the virtual world attracted more viewers.
There were only two or three channels in those days.

The Olympic Games and Tennis Opens now shone
with orange cinder tracks, the grass strips
of Wimbledon, the red clay of Roland Garrigues
and blue plexigrass of other Grand Slam venues.

I see flat-screen, digital sets in shops now: 
their slim presence lights up the show room
whether the screen is inch or inch


 


I would be wandering in distant fields 
Where man, and bird, and beast, lives leisurely, 
And the old earth is kind, and ever yields 
Her goodly gifts to all her children free; 
Where life is fairer, lighter, less demanding, 
And boys and girls have time and space for play 
Before they come to years of understanding-- 
Somewhere I would be singing, far away. 
For life is greater than the thousand wars 
Men wage for it in their insatiate lust, 
And will remain like the eternal stars, 
When all that shines to-day is drift and dust 
But I am bound with you in your mean graves, 
O black men, simple slaves of ruthless slaves. 


tonight, a torch song is burning, 
on the levee in Gramercy, 
a bonfire, a distant always, 
as hot as nineteen eighty-three. 
after church we walked in silence, 
beneath the tangled oaks, I knew, 
and fancied Satan was upset, 
when i sold my soul to you.  
for a moon you never owned, 
for a night of stars and bliss, 
baptized in broad darkness, 
by a Creole kind of kiss
divine and human, all at once 
it went beyond blood brothers, 
before we knew the sin and shame 
imposed by peers and holy mothers. 
southern closets grew damp and cold 
with fear and condemnation dealt 
for boys who did not fit the mold 
were beaten with the bible belt. 
tradition ruled, all else was odd, 
redeemed, I sought to please their god, 
through prayers for grace, my soul confessed

He is quick, thinking in clear images;
I am slow, thinking in broken images. 

He becomes dull, trusting to his clear images;
I become sharp, mistrusting my broken images. 

Trusting his images, he assumes their relevance;
Mistrusting my images, I question their relevance. 

Assuming their relevance, he assumes the fact;
Questioning their relevance, I question the fact. 

When the fact fails him, he questions his senses;
When the fact fails me, I approve my senses. 

He continues quick and dull in his clear images;
I continue slow and sharp in my broken images. 

He in a new confusion of his understanding;
I in a new understanding of my confusion. 


Among the blight-killed eucalypts, among
the yards and hillsides exhausted by five years of drought,

certain airy white blossoms punctually
reappeared, and dense clusters of pale pink, dark pink--
a delicate abundance. They seemed

like guests arriving joyfully on the accustomed
festival day, unaware of the year's events, not perceiving
the sackcloth others were wearing.


To some of us, the dejected landscape consorted well
with our shame and bitterness. Skies ever-blue,
daily sunshine, disgusted us like smile-buttons.

Yet the blossoms, clinging to thin branches
more lightly than birds alert for flight,
lifted the sunken heart

even against its will.
But not
as symbols of hope: they were flimsy
as our resistance to the crimes committed

--again, again--in our name; and yes, they return,
year after year, and yes, they briefly shone with serene joy
over against the dark glare

of evil days. They 
are, and their presence
is quietness ineffable--and the bombings 
are, were,
no doubt will be; that quiet, that huge cacophany

simultaneous. No promise was being accorded, the blossoms
were not doves, there was no rainbow. And when it was claimed
the war had ended, it had not ended. 


Pale, then enkindled, 
light 
advancing, 
emblazoning 
summits of palm and pine, 

the dew 
lingering, 
scintillas. 


Soon the roar 
of mowers 
cropping the already short 
grass of lawns, 

men with long-nozzled 
cylinders of pesticide 
poking at weeds, 
at moss in cracks of cement, 

and louder roar 
of helicopters off to spray 
vineyards where braceros try 
to hold their breath, 

and in the distance, bulldozers, excavators, 
babel of destructive construction. 

Banded by deep 
oakshadow, airy 
shadow of eucalyptus, 

miner's lettuce, 
tender, untasted, 
and other grass, unmown, 
luxuriant, 
no green more brilliant. 

Fragile paradise. 




At day's end the whole sky, 
vast, unstinting, flooded with transparent 
mauve, 
tint of wisteria, 
cloudless 
over the malls, the industrial parks, 
the homes with the lights going on, 
the homeless arranging their bundles. 




Who can utter 
the poignance of all that is constantly 
threatened, invaded, expended 

and constantly 
nevertheless 
persists in beauty, 

tranquil as this young moon 
just risen and slowly 
drinking light 
from the vanished sun. 

Who can utter 
the praise of such generosity 
or the shame


Without a bed we now sleep sound
And take our meals upon the ground;
And though the blazing atmosphere
Must dreadful to the eye appear,
The air though roaring cannons rend
While warriors with fierce rage contend,
The thoughtless French drink, laugh, and sing,
And with their mirth the heavens ring;
The walls of Philippsburg shall burn,
And all her towers to ashes turn
By fifty thousand Alexanders,
Who all deserve to be commanders,
Though they receive the paltry pay
Of only four poor sous a day.
Lavish of life, with high delight
I see them rushing to the fight;
They all appear both gay and jolly,
Quite covered o'er with fame and folly.
The Phantom, which we Glory name,
Spurs them to the pursuit of fame;
With threat'ning eye, and front all o'er
Bedusted, marching still before,
She holds a trumpet in her hand
To sound to arms, and cheer the band,
And loudly sings, with voice sonorous,
Catches, which they repeat in chorus.
Oh! people brilliant, gay, and vain,
Who drag with patience glory's chain,
'Tis great, an honorable grave
To seek, Eugene and death to brave.
But what will be your mighty prize?
What from your prowess will arise?
Regret your blood, in vain you spilt it;
At Paris cuckolded, or jilted. 


Everyone in me is a bird. 
I am beating all my wings. 
They wanted to cut you out 
but they will not. 
They said you were immeasurably empty 
but you are not. 
They said you were sick unto dying 
but they were wrong. 
You are singing like a school girl. 
You are not torn. 


Sweet weight, 
in celebration of the woman I am 
and of the soul of the woman I am 
and of the central creature and its delight 
I sing for you. I dare to live. 
Hello, spirit. Hello, cup. 
Fasten, cover. Cover that does contain. 
Hello to the soil of the fields. 
Welcome, roots. 


Each cell has a life. 
There is enough here to please a nation. 
It is enough that the populace own these goods. 
Any person, any commonwealth would say of it, 
"It is good this year that we may plant again 
and think forward to a harvest. 
A blight had been forecast and has been cast out." 
Many women are singing together of this: 
one is in a shoe factory cursing the machine, 
one is at the aquarium tending a seal, 
one is dull at the wheel of her Ford, 
one is at the toll gate collecting, 
one is tying the cord of a calf in Arizona, 
one is straddling a cello in Russia, 
one is shifting pots on the stove in Egypt, 
one is painting her bedroom walls moon color, 
one is dying but remembering a breakfast, 
one is stretching on her mat in Thailand, 
one is wiping the ass of her child, 
one is staring out the window of a train 
in the middle of Wyoming and one is 
anywhere and some are everywhere and all 
seem to be singing, although some can not 
sing a note. 


Sweet weight, 
in celebration of the woman I am 
let me carry a ten-foot scarf, 
let me drum for the nineteen-year-olds, 
let me carry bowls for the offering 
(if that is my part). 
Let me study the cardiovascular tissue, 
let me examine the angular distance of meteors, 
let me suck on the stems of flowers 
(if that is my part). 
Let me make certain tribal figures 
(if that is my part). 
For this thing the body needs 
let me sing 
for the supper, 
for the kissing, 
for the correct 
yes. 


I do things on the spur of the moment, (in) consistency is whose problem.




It is a great realization
to know that you are not false.

It comes from the consciousness
that You are true
to your own self
to others
to the world 
and to the Universe.

This is a revelation
and a permanent joy.

Then you are in contact
with the sweet point in your heart.

This point is mystically beautiful.

This point is still.
It does not reach out for you.
But it never abandons you.


I

Never and never, my girl riding far and near
In the land of the hearthstone tales, and spelled asleep,
Fear or believe that the wolf in a sheepwhite hood
Loping and bleating roughly and blithely shall leap,
My dear, my dear,
Out of a lair in the flocked leaves in the dew dipped year
To eat your heart in the house in the rosy wood.

Sleep, good, for ever, slow and deep, spelled rare and wise,
My girl ranging the night in the rose and shire
Of the hobnail tales: no gooseherd or swine will turn
Into a homestall king or hamlet of fire
And prince of ice
To court the honeyed heart from your side before sunrise
In a spinney of ringed boys and ganders, spike and burn,

Nor the innocent lie in the rooting dingle wooed
And staved, and riven among plumes my rider weep.
From the broomed witch's spume you are shielded by fern
And flower of country sleep and the greenwood keep.
Lie fast and soothed,
Safe be and smooth from the bellows of the rushy brood.
Never, my girl, until tolled to sleep by the stern

Bell believe or fear that the rustic shade or spell
Shall harrow and snow the blood while you ride wide and near,
For who unmanningly haunts the mountain ravened eaves
Or skulks in the dell moon but moonshine echoing clear
From the starred well?
A hill touches an angel. Out of a saint's cell
The nightbird lauds through nunneries and domes of leaves

Her robin breasted tree, three Marys in the rays.
_Sanctum sanctorum_ the animal eye of the wood
In the rain telling its beads, and the gravest ghost
The owl at its knelling. Fox and holt kneel before blood.
Now the tales praise
The star rise at pasture and nightlong the fables graze
On the lord's-table of the bowing grass. Fear most

For ever of all not the wolf in his baaing hood
Nor the tusked prince, in the ruttish farm, at the rind
And mire of love, but the Thief as meek as the dew.
The country is holy: O bide in that country kind,
Know the green good,
Under the prayer wheeling moon in the rosy wood
Be shielded by chant and flower and gay may you

Lie in grace. Sleep spelled at rest in the lowly house
In the squirrel nimble grove, under linen and thatch
And star: held and blessed, though you scour the high four
Winds, from the dousing shade and the roarer at the latch,
Cool in your vows.
Yet out of the beaked, web dark and the pouncing boughs
Be you sure the Thief will seek a way sly and sure

And sly as snow and meek as dew blown to the thorn,
This night and each vast night until the stern bell talks
In the tower and tolls to sleep over the stalls
Of the hearthstone tales my own, lost love; and the soul walks
The waters shorn.
This night and each night since the falling star you were born,
Ever and ever he finds a way, as the snow falls,

As the rain falls, hail on the fleece, as the vale mist rides
Through the haygold stalls, as the dew falls on the wind-
Milled dust of the apple tree and the pounded islands
Of the morning leaves, as the star falls, as the winged
Apple seed glides,
And falls, and flowers in the yawning wound at our sides,
As the world falls, silent as the cyclone of silence.


II

Night and the reindeer on the clouds above the haycocks
And the wings of the great roc ribboned for the fair!
The leaping saga of prayer! And high, there, on the hare-
Heeled winds the rooks
Cawing from their black bethels soaring, the holy books
Of birds! Among the cocks like fire the red fox

Burning! Night and the vein of birds in the winged, sloe wrist
Of the wood! Pastoral beat of blood through the laced leaves!
The stream from the priest black wristed spinney and sleeves
Of thistling frost
Of the nightingale's din and tale! The upgiven ghost
Of the dingle torn to singing and the surpliced

Hill of cypresses! The din and tale in the skimmed
Yard of the buttermilk rain on the pail! The sermon
Of blood! The bird loud vein! The saga from mermen
To seraphim
Leaping! The gospel rooks! All tell, this night, of him
Who comes as red as the fox and sly as the heeled wind.

Illumination of music! the lulled black-backed
Gull, on the wave with sand in its eyes! And the foal moves
Through the shaken greensward lake, silent, on moonshod hooves,
In the winds' wakes.
Music of elements, that a miracle makes!
Earth, air, water, fire, singing into the white act,

The haygold haired, my love asleep, and the rift blue
Eyed, in the haloed house, in her rareness and hilly
High riding, held and blessed and true, and so stilly
Lying the sky
Might cross its planets, the bell weep, night gather her eyes,
The Thief fall on the dead like the willy nilly dew,

Only for the turning of the earth in her holy
Heart! Slyly, slowly, hearing the wound in her side go
Round the sun, he comes to my love like the designed snow,
And truly he
Flows to the strand of flowers like the dew's ruly sea,
And surely he sails like the ship shape clouds. Oh he

Comes designed to my love to steal not her tide raking
Wound, nor her riding high, nor her eyes, nor kindled hair,
But her faith that each vast night and the saga of prayer
He comes to take
Her faith that this last night for his unsacred sake
He comes to leave her in the lawless sun awaking

Naked and forsaken to grieve he will not come.
Ever and ever by all your vows believe and fear
My dear this night he comes and night without end my dear
Since you were born:
And you shall wake, from country sleep, this dawn and each first dawn,
Your faith as deathless as the outcry of the ruled sun. 


In courage-you find
no fear
 and in courage-no weakness
does appear
In courage-steps toward
danger taken
and in courage-strength 
within awaken
In courage- a hero 
takes shape
and in courage- the villain
can't escape
In courage-there is a call
to duty
and in courage-out of ugliness
comes beauty


Must all of worth be travailled for, and those 
Life's brightest stars rise from a troubled sea 
Must years go by in sad uncertainty 
Leaving us doubting whose the conquering blows, 
Are we or Fate the victors? Time which shows 
All inner meanings will reveal, but we 
Shall never know the upshot. Ours to be 
Wasted with longing, shattered in the throes, 
The agonies of splendid dreams, which day 
Dims from our vision, but each night brings back; 
We strive to hold their grandeur, and essay 
To be the thing we dream. Sudden we lack 
The flash of insight, life grows drear and gray, 
And hour follows hour, nerveless, slack. 




Thru darkness
I've seen the light
the dark shadow of my life
the weakness
my black strength
that slave my sinful flesh
ever since

Thru darkness
I've raised my torch
flaming from the doubts
from the law of hindrances
stuck in unfulfilled dreams

Thru darkness
I've learned where did
I go wrong
in making of short-term decisions
in reaching out
long-term  goals

Thru darkness
I need to be shone
to erect out in the dark
to lit the lighting
candle
 guiding and sparkling 


now in the dark
I can see the lightas the most intimate companions
as the best of friend and foe
as the body and soul

in death. . 

when
the soul gets its wings to fly
what could have been
that one word of console

to bring back
peace and tranquility
to that dead body

in death.  

at that moment
what would have been
that one word of console



Dropped Alive
The air was dry. 
Spanked my butt
They made me cry
For some years, I sucked and crawled
Just to face.  

Life's senseless brawl

Do this! Do that! ! Oh what a pain. 
that 'home training'.  crap gist again
I need to break away to play
Just so my youth won't go to waste.

Oh yeah! Oh yeah! !


I've got my break
This 'free-life' stuff is surely great
Gun shots, Jail terms.  

I'm stuck with 'crack'

My life is grass. 


So you're back from up the country, Mister Lawson, where you went, 
And you're cursing all the business in a bitter discontent; 
Well, we grieve to disappoint you, and it makes us sad to hear 
That it wasn't cool and shady -- and there wasn't whips of beer, 
And the looney bullock snorted when you first came into view -- 
Well, you know it's not so often that he sees a swell like you; 
And the roads were hot and dusty, and the plains were burnt and brown, 
And no doubt you're better suited drinking lemon-squash in town. 
Yet, perchance, if you should journey down the very track you went 
In a month or two at furthest, you would wonder what it meant; 
Where the sunbaked earth was gasping like a creature in its pain 
You would find the grasses waving like a field of summer grain, 
And the miles of thirsty gutters, blocked with sand and choked with mud, 
You would find them mighty rivers with a turbid, sweeping flood. 
For the rain and drought and sunshine make no changes in the street, 
In the sullen line of buildings and the ceaseless tramp of feet; 
But the bush has moods and changes, as the seasons rise and fall, 
And the men who know the bush-land -- they are loyal through it all. 
                                                             * 

But you found the bush was dismal and a land of no delight -- 
Did you chance to hear a chorus in the shearers' huts at night? 
Did they 'rise up William Riley' by the camp-fire's cheery blaze? 
Did they rise him as we rose him in the good old droving days? 
And the women of the homesteads and the men you chanced to meet -- 
Were their faces sour and saddened like the 'faces in the street'? 
And the 'shy selector children' -- were they better now or worse 
Than the little city urchins who would greet you with a curse? 
Is not such a life much better than the squalid street and square 
Where the fallen women flaunt it in the fierce electric glare, 
Wher the sempstress plies her needle till her eyes are sore and red 
In a filthy, dirty attic toiling on for daily bread? 
Did you hear no sweeter voices in the music of the bush 
Than the roar of trams and buses, and the war-whoop of 'the push'? 
Did the magpies rouse your slumbers with their carol sweet and strange? 
Did you hear the silver chiming of the bell-birds on the range? 
But, perchance, the wild birds' music by your senses was despised, 
For you say you'll stay in townships till the bush is civilized. 
Would you make it a tea-garden, and on Sundays have a band 
Where the 'blokes' might take their 'donahs', with a 'public' close at hand? 
You had better stick to Sydney and make merry with the 'push', 
For the bush will never suit you, and you'll never suit the bush. 


When the King of Siam disliked a courtier, 
he gave him a beautiful white elephant. 
The miracle beast deserved such ritual 
that to care for him properly meant ruin. 
Yet to care for him improperly was worse. 
It appears the gift could not be refused. 

IN due observance of an ancient rite,
The rude Biscayans, when their children lie
Dead in the sinless time of infancy,
Attire the peaceful corse in vestments white;
And, in like sign of cloudless triumph bright,
They bind the unoffending creature's brows
With happy garlands of the pure white rose:
Then do a festal company unite
In choral song; and, while the uplifted cross
Uncovered to his grave: 'tis closed,--her loss
The Mother 'then' mourns, as she needs must mourn;
And joy returns, to brighten fortitude. 

If night should come and find me at my toil,
 When all Life's day I had, tho' faintly, wrought,
And shallow furrows, cleft in stony soil
 Were all my labour:  Shall I count it naught

If only one poor gleaner, weak of hand,
 Shall pick a scanty sheaf where I have sown?
"Nay, for of thee the Master doth demand
 Thy work:  the harvest rests with Him alone


am homesick after mine own kind,
Oh I know that there are folk about me, friendly faces,
But I am homesick after mine own kind.


'These sell our pictures'! Oh well,
They reach me not, touch me some edge or that,
But reach me not and all my life's become
One flame, that reaches not beyond
My heart's own hearth,
Or hides among the ashes there for thee.
Thee'? Oh, 'Thee' is who cometh first
Out of mine own soul-kin,
For I am homesick after mine own kind
And ordinary people touch me not.
And I am homesick
After mine own kind that know, and feel
And have some breath for beauty and the arts.

Aye, I am wistful for my kin of the spirit
And have none about me save in the shadows


T. says Beauty is most that, a
'calling to the soul'.
Well then, so call they, the swirlers out of the mist of my soul,
They that come mewards, bearing old magic.


But for all that, I am homesick after mine own kind
And would meet kindred even as I am,
Flesh-shrouded bearing the secret.
'All they that with strange sadness'
Have the earth in mockery, and are kind to all,
My fellows, aye I know the glory
Of th' unbounded ones, but ye, that hide
As I hide most the while
And burst forth to the windows only whiles or whiles
For love, or hope or beauty or for power,
Then smoulder, with the lids half closed
And are untouched by echoes of the world.

Oh ye, my fellows: with the seas between us some be,
Purple and sapphire for the silver shafts
Of sun and spray all shattered at the bows;
And some the hills hold off,
The little hills to east of us, though here we
Have damp and plain to be our shutting in.

And yet my soul sings ‘Up!' and we are one.
Yea thou, and Thou, and THOU, and all my kin
To whom my breast and arms are ever warm,
For that I love ye as the wind the trees
That holds their blossoms and their leaves in cure
And calls the utmost singing from the boughs
That Hhout him, save the aspen, were as dumb
Still shade, and bade no whisper speak the birds of how
'Beyond, beyond, beyond, there lies 



No need to be coy—
you know what 
she's doing
 

And so did Bernini,
when he found Teresa 
in the full-throttle of
her divine vision,
            caught her at it, 
 
carving this surrender
so fluidly you expect
the impossible:
 
for her tang to swell up, ripe
as seafoam, from the gulf
of her flushed and falling
figure. Perhaps this is how
 
or should come to us, all:
 
the bluntly and 
beautifully corporeal at
 
prayers in the Sunday
school of pleasure. Why
 
shouldn't He come to us
as He did to Teresa? A saint
 
on her back—
a girl tearing open 
the gift He gave her



They burnt a corpse upon the sand--
The light shone out afar;
It guided home the plunging dhows
That beat from Zanzibar.
Spirit of Fire, where'er Thy altars rise,
Thou art the Light of Guidance to our eyes



Here I am, patiently
Delineating the boundaries
Among the centrifugal forces
Touching my now complex life
Hoping to see again
An undistorted image of myself
When facing the mirror next time. 
Carefully avoiding the trap
Of another love's addiction. 
Living within a world
Filled with  misunderstandings
And contradictions. 
Ignorance, indeed, 
Turns out to be a blessing
For  lack of knowledge
You need to give no explanations. 
But when wisdom becomes your domain, 
And true changes are implemented, 
Destiny by default, 
Shall welcome the sunset
Of a new and brighter life
Stronger and well redefined.

Unawed by shame or fear,
Till a new object struck my sight,
And stopped my wild career.

I saw One hanging on a tree,
In agony and blood,
Who fixed His languid eyes on me,
As near His cross I stood.

Sure, never to my latest breath,
Can I forget that look;
It seemed to charge me with His death,
Though not a word He spoke.

My conscience felt and owned the guilt,
And plunged me in despair,
I saw my sins His blood had spilt,
And helped to nail Him there.

A second look He gave, which said,
"I freely all forgive;
This blood is for thy ransom paid;
I die that thou mayst live."

Thus, while His death my sin displays
In all its blackest hue,
Such is the mystery of grace,
It seals my pardon too.

With pleasing grief and mournful joy,
My spirit now is fill'd,
That I should such a life destroy,
Yet live by Him I kill'd. 


You -- you -- 
Your shadow is sunlight on a plate of silver; 
Your footsteps, the seeding-place of lilies; 
Your hands moving, a chime of bells across a windless air.

The movement of your hands is the long, golden running of light from a rising sun; 
It is the hopping of birds upon a garden-path.


As the perfume of jonquils, you come forth in the morning. 
Young horses are not more sudden than your thoughts, 
Your words are bees about a pear-tree, 
Your fancies are the gold-and-black striped wasps buzzing among red apples. 
I drink your lips, 
I eat the whiteness of your hands and feet. 
My mouth is open, 
As a new jar I am empty and open. 
Like white water are you who fill the cup of my mouth, 
Like a brook of water thronged with lilies.


You are frozen as the clouds, 
You are far and sweet as the high clouds. 
I dare to reach to you, 
I dare to touch the rim of your brightness. 
I leap beyond the winds, 
I cry and shout, 
For my throat is keen as is a sword 
Sharpened on a hone of ivory. 
My throat sings the joy of my eyes, 
The rushing gladness of my love.


How has the rainbow fallen upon my heart? 
How have I snared the seas to lie in my fingers 
And caught the sky to be a cover for my head? How have you come to dwell with me, 
Compassing me with the four circles of your mystic lightness, 
So that I say "Glory! Glory!" and bow before you 
As to a shrine?


Do I tease myself that morning is morning and a day after? 
Do I think the air is a condescension, 
The earth a politeness, 
Heaven a boon deserving thanks? 
So you -- air -- earth -- heaven -- 
I do not thank you, 
I take you, 
I live. 
And those things which I say in consequence 
Are rubies mortised in a gate of stone. 


It is half winter, half spring,
and Barbara and I are standing
confronting the ocean.
Its mouth is open very wide,
and it has dug up its green,
throwing it, throwing it at the shore.
You say it is angry.
I say it is like a kicked Madonna.
Its womb collapses, drunk with its fever.
We breathe in its fury.


I, the inlander,
am here with you for just a small space.
I am almost afraid,
so long gone from the sea.
I have seen her smooth as a cheek.
I have seen her easy,
doing her business,
lapping in.
I have seen her rolling her hoops of blue.
I have seen her tear the land off.
I have seen her drown me twice,
and yet not take me.
You tell me that as the green drains backward
it covers Britain,
but have you never stood on that shore
and seen it cover you?


We have come to worship,
the tongues of the surf are prayers,
and we vow,
the unspeakable vow.
Both silently.
Both differently.
I wish to enter her like a dream,
leaving my roots here on the beach
like a pan of knives.
And my past to unravel, with its knots and snarls,
and walk into ocean,
letting it explode over me
and outward, where I would drink the moon
and my clothes would slip away,
and I would sink into the great mother arms
I never had,
except here where the abyss
throws itself on the sand
blow by blow,
over and over,
and we stand on the shore
loving its pulse
as it swallows the stars,
and has since it all began
and will continue into oblivion,
past our knowing
and the wild toppling green that enters us today,
for a small time
in half winter, half spring. 



On a certain one's departure

‘Time's bitter flood'! Oh, that's all very well,
But where's the old friend hasn't fallen off,
Or slacked his hand-grip when you first gripped fame?
I know your circle and can fairly tell
What you have kept and what you’ve left behind:
I know my circle and know very well
How many faces I'd have out of mind. 


And All the ways he's Worked
     In Your Life. 
Count Them on your hands and toes, 
 Oops, There's not enough of those.   
But That's the way the story goes.

   In a New Born's Heart! 
  To be carried along, from, 
Generation after Generation, In
     A Song! . . Don't let Anyone
  or Anything. . 

Put Out That
 Flame.  

Even If we get Maimed.
          Carry on His Name! 



Whatever I may wonder, 
Your never far behind, 
When cancer rears it's ugly head, 
It nestles in the mind.
To hear the words all clear, 
Is a blessing that is true, 
But the evil of the Devil, 
Well it leaves its mark on you.
For fear lies in the shadows, 
True fear in every way, 
It's hard to shake off the feeling, 
You may return one day,A hard north-easter fifty winters long
Has bronzed and shrivelled sere her face and neck;
Her locks are wild and grey, her teeth a wreck;
Her foot is vast, her bowed leg spare and strong.
A wide blue cloak, a squat and sturdy throng
Of curt blue coats, a mutch without a speck,
A white vest broidered black, her person deck,
Nor seems their picked, stern, old-world quaintness wrong.
Her great creel forehead-slung, she wanders nigh,
Easing the heavy strap with gnarled, brown fingers,
The spirit of traffic watchful in her eye,
Ever and anon imploring you to buy,
As looking down the street she onward lingers,
Reproachful, with a strange and doleful cry.



In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
That mark our place; and in the sky
The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.

We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
Loved and were loved, and now we lie,
In Flanders fields.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch; be yours to hold it high.
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields. 



My curiosity was started by the sparks of the light
Comets glint opening the curtain of the sky at twilight
Presenting the wonderful show from haven
With whimsical lights from vaulted heaven

A view from the earth to the sky
Glimmering beams caught my eyes
Like with golden wings
Such enchantment they bring

The sky across the sea
Reflect the sea brightly
Like dancing lights
Light brights the night

How many stars those like eyes
From that wondrous sky
Lights beam over hills
And plains with daffodils

Lovely are those celestial beams
Beautiful colors enthrall my dreams
Perhaps to any lovers delight
With a moonlight smile so bright

I estimate to megabytes
Oh, its just sort of a unit of gigabytes
So I just laugh at my eccentricity
But it entertains my curiosity


When i devotedly turn
to the cries of my heart
and listen carefully, 
then I feel that my heart yearns
for something greater than all I have
the eternal,   the Almighty.

The respect and use of any countries money has never changed, 
Shekel, Denari, Peso, Yen, even solid gold, what’s in a name? 
May in church circles will not even bother to pay their  tithes, 
On that note, does it really matter and if so please elaborate why? 
 
It’s not how much you have but what is done with it that counts, 
The old woman put in two copper mites yet it was a greater amount, 
Than those who gave plenty more out of their abundant wealth,

Remember the phrase that, "a fool and money his soon will part, "
Any amount is useless unless it’s written upon the spender’s heart. 


 
Peter fetched a shekel from the mouth of a fish for taxes to pay, 
What phrase and whose picture was on money back in the day?

Yes, many people see this inscription as being a fresh new start, 
"They honor Me with their lips but despise Me with their heart, "
 
Good to know because this makes it even more shallow & hollow,

In Goya's greatest scenes we seem to see
                                           the people of the world   
       exactly at the moment when
             they first attained the title of
                                                             ‘suffering humanity'   
          They writhe upon the page
                                        in a veritable rage
                                                                of adversity   
          Heaped up
                     groaning with babies and bayonets
                                                       under cement skies   
            in an abstract landscape of blasted trees
                  bent statues bats wings and beaks
                               slippery gibbets
                  cadavers and carnivorous cocks

            they are so bloody real
                                        it is as if they really still existed

    And they do

                  Only the landscape is changed

They still are ranged along the roads   
          plagued by legionnaires
                     false windmills and demented roosters
They are the same people
                                     only further from home
      on freeways fifty lanes wide
                              on a concrete continent
                                        spaced with bland billboards   
                        illustrating imbecile illusions of happiness

                                                but more strung-out citizens
                                                                     in painted cars
                               and they have strange license plates   
                           and engines
                                           that devour America



I'm just a gate keeper
at the threshold between
life and death
simply collecting the souls
of the departed
maybe that's why some of you
know me as the reaper

You continue to blame me 
for all the departed
but then again, 
must I reject those 
who willingly come to me? 
am I just supposed to let them go? 
besides. 
can you blame me 
for simply doing my job? 

I patiently wait on all 
dying patients
to draw their last breath
I welcome and escort them
safely into the afterlife
I even take the trouble
to attend every funeral
I wait and watch as mourners
pay their last respects! 

I have been present 
at the frontline of every war
carrying the bruised 
and battered
into the next life
I am there simply, 
to present their war weary 
souls with a peaceful escape
an alternative to the carnage
happening all around them! 

But, you still have the guts
to call me the bad guy
despite what I do for this world? 
Don't get me wrong, 
I believe death is an ugly thing
but, who is going to clean up
the wreckage it leaves behind
when i am gone


The heavenly bay, ringed round with cliffs and moors,
Storm-stained ravines, and crags that lawns inlay,
Soothes as with love the rocks whose guard secures
  The heavenly bay.

O friend, shall time take ever this away,
This blessing given of beauty that endures,
This glory shown us, not to pass but stay?

Though sight be changed for memory, love ensures
What memory, changed by love to sight, would say -
The word that seals for ever mine and yours
  The heavenly bay.


II.

My mother sea, my fostress, what new strand,
What new delight of waters, may this be,
The fairest found since time's first breezes fanned
  My mother sea?

Once more I give me body and soul to thee,
Who hast my soul for ever:  cliff and sand
Recede, and heart to heart once more are we.

My heart springs first and plunges, ere my hand
Strike out from shore:  more close it brings to me,
More near and dear than seems my fatherland,
  My mother sea.

III.

Across and along, as the bay's breadth opens, and o'er us
Wild autumn exults in the wind, swift rapture and strong
Impels us, and broader the wide waves brighten before us
  Across and along.

The whole world's heart is uplifted, and knows not wrong;
The whole world's life is a chant to the sea-tide's chorus;
Are we not as waves of the water, as notes of the song?

Like children unworn of the passions and toils that wore us,
We breast for a season the breadth of the seas that throng,
Rejoicing as they, to be borne as of old they bore us
  Across and along.

IV.

On Dante's track by some funereal spell
Drawn down through desperate ways that lead not back
We seem to move, bound forth past flood and fell
  On Dante's track.

The grey path ends:  the gaunt rocks gape:  the black
Deep hollow tortuous night, a soundless shell,
Glares darkness:  are the fires of old grown slack?

Nay, then, what flames are these that leap and swell
As 'twere to show, where earth's foundations crack,
The secrets of the sepulchres of hell
  On Dante's track?

V.

By mere men's hands the flame was lit, we know,
From heaps of dry waste whin and casual brands:
Yet, knowing, we scarce believe it kindled so
  By mere men's hands.

Above, around, high-vaulted hell expands,
Steep, dense, a labyrinth walled and roofed with woe,
Whose mysteries even itself not understands.

The scorn in Farinata's eyes aglow
Seems visible in this flame:  there Geryon stands:
No stage of earth's is here, set forth to show
  By mere men's hands.

VI.

Night, in utmost noon forlorn and strong, with heart athirst and fasting,
Hungers here, barred up for ever, whence as one whom dreams affright
Day recoils before the low-browed lintel threatening doom and casting
  Night.

All the reefs and islands, all the lawns and highlands, clothed with light,
Laugh for love's sake in their sleep outside:  but here the night speaks, blasting 
Day with silent speech and scorn of all things known from depth to height.

Lower than dive the thoughts of spirit-stricken fear in souls forecasting
Hell, the deep void seems to yawn beyond fear's reach, and higher than sight
Rise the walls and roofs that compass it about with everlasting
   Night.

VII.

The house accurst, with cursing sealed and signed,
Heeds not what storms about it burn and burst:
No fear more fearful than its own may find
  The house accurst.

Barren as crime, anhungered and athirst,
Blank miles of moor sweep inland, sere and blind,

The low bleak tower with nought save wastes behind
Stares down the abyss whereon chance reared and nursed
This type and likeness of the accurst man's mind,
  The house accurst.

VIII.

Beloved and blest, lit warm with love and fame,
The house that had the light of the earth for guest
Hears for his name's sake all men hail its name
  Beloved and blest.

This eyrie was the homeless eagle's nest
When storm laid waste his eyrie:  hence he came
Again, when storm smote sore his mother's breast.

Bow down men bade us, or be clothed with blame
And mocked for madness:  worst, they sware, was best:
But grief shone here, while joy was one with shame,
  Beloved and blest. 

Their hearts clean extremely puts the whole place with love
That their goal is to bring about the beauty of
His Wonders of Beneficial Grace to generate
Salvation on the entire earth to live in peace, 
Which leads to confusion and disorder to cease.
Working with their hearts is what they have to aspire
To take the step to heaven that bliss they admire, 
By provoking within themselves to bring revealed
The good, to lead straight to the bond of love sealed.
It is that miracle displayed for them to see
How they can live in a world with harmony free. 



In heaven, 
Some little blades of grass 
"What did you do?" 
Then all save one of the little blades 
Began eagerly to relate 
The merits of their lives. 
This one stayed a small way behind, 
Ashamed. 
"And what did you do?" 
Memory is bitter to me, 
For, if I did good deeds, 
I know not of them
 

Arose from His throne. 
"Oh, best little blade of grass!" He said. 

In Heaven, color does not matter; 
There, there is no money, no color, 
No hypocrisy, no quandary, no beauty, 
No nepotism, no size and no celebrity.

On earth inequality reigns, 
When it pours, it rains, 
When it rains, it pours; 
Different weather patterns
Warrant different types of doors
And different types of lanterns.

In Heaven, these are not necessary, 
The temperature varies very often, 
Every holy minute and divine second, 
Keeping counts will be silly and crazy.

Believe me, there is no limousine
For earthly and mundane stars; 
Everything under the screen
Shall become dust, including fancy cars.

In Heaven, color does not matter, 
There, everybody is equal; 
There is no king, no corporal, 
No corrupt judge and no criminal lawyer.

In Heaven, one single iota matters: the soul, 
Which always flies like a wingless writer.
Spirit has no color, no smell, 
No shape, no life and no propeller. 



There you go again, driving out the yard.
You took with you tonight more than just my heart.
It’s sad to watch you leave and it hurts to see you go, 
and you might already comprehend; I’ll never leave you alone.

Time with you runs out way too quickly every night.
You’ll smile at me and send a shiver straight down my spine.
Sometimes I can’t help wondering what goes on inside your mind, 
and like clockwork you’ll say it’s me you think ‘bout all the time.

It was from the first few seconds that I realized the truth; 
you swept me off my feet in just one easy, perfect swoop.
Though we’ve spent a week apart before, it still doesn’t mean I’m fine
with watching as you drive out of the front yard every night.

I’ll even play an addictive love song just to keep your arms ‘round me, 
‘cause with both of us holding on, we can easily believe.
Like two dumbstruck fools in love we will keep this remedy
till our hearts stop beating, then in heaven we shall meet. 



I’m in heaven with you, 
Spirited away on a burning sphere, 
Inside of me are the new
Imprints of this adventure.  

You came like a dream from above, 
Then the world I knew change suddenly, 
And the things you love, 
I will take with me into eternity.

The presence of love joy and peace, 
Each emotion with its own truth, 
Holding intimacy in close embrace, 
Feels like the splendor of new birth.

You are here sharing the breath, 
And consciousness of my being, 
Transported on a paradise wreath, 
Into divinity of angelic realm.

I’m in heaven where my soul is alive, 
This earthly feeling never existed before, 
With countless reasons I do believe, 
We were meant to be with each other. 



Although in her every indication, the aim is something else
If she shows her affection(with me) , then different suspicion arises


Give 'them' another heart, if you don't give me a different tongue


Does that glance of coquetry have a connection with the eyebrow? 
It is certainly an arrow- perhaps it has a different bow


If you're in the city, then what grief do I have? when we get up
I will go and bring back from the bazaar a different heart and life


Although [I /we] became quick-handed / deft in idol-breaking
If I am alive, then in my path there will be many heavy-stones


The blood of the liver is in turmoil—or I would have wept to my heart's content
If I had had a number of different pure-blood-scattering eyes


I will die [of love] for that voice, although my head may fly off! 
But let her keep saying to the executioner,'Yes, more/another! '


People are deceived about the world-{heating/burning} sun
Every day I show one different hidden scar/wound

There are many good poets in this world.
But it is said that Ghalib is in a league of his own. 


How sweet to be thus nestling deep in boughs,
Upon an ashen stoven pillowing me;
Faintly are heard the ploughmen at their ploughs,
But not an eye can find its way to see.
The sunbeams scarce molest me with a smile,
So thick the leafy armies gather round;
And where they do, the breeze blows cool the while,
Their leafy shadows dancing on the ground.
Full many a flower, too, wishing to be seen,
Perks up its head the hiding grass between.-
In mid-wood silence, thus, how sweet to be;
Where all the noises, that on peace intrude,
Come from the chittering cricket, bird, and bee,
Whose songs have charms to sweeten solitude. 



He's in the barn, watching the golden rays of sun
     stream down. He's climbing the big, old oak tree, that 
      he's found. He's running off threw the blades of grass.
     He's thinking of, that cute, little girl who smiled at him
      last. He's full of wonder, young and free. He's imagining
     what there is yet to be. He's laying in the fresh cut hay.
      He's down by the river, listening to what it has to say. And
     as the pearly strands of rain come down. The fields become a 
      play ground. And in the mist and rain, of a warm summers
     morn,  a cool breeze blows, and new is born! There, he is, as
      he stares off in that glaze. There, .. There! 



In his eyes are empty wells
where waters only flow endless
when I stare; 
and in his eyes are dark skies
where stars only shine endless
when I glare.
You'll hear in his voice silent graveyards
where melodies only stream endless
when to me he sings. 
and together in his lips lie broken leaves
where flowers only bloom endless
when to me he speaks.
In his cheeks are forsaken streets
but sweetest heaven in my eye; 
in his heart are dying secrets
that live in mine, I know not why.
I read in his soul forgotten poems
that i write immortal in these lines.
For in his worst, I love him best.


 It was a scent.  

BUT not just any, . 
her scent filled the air

It was jasmine of lady faire

his contessa in the wind.  

singing him 
. 

dancing love, and the feet dancing bare, 

on the sound of his laughter, with the joy of her  hair, 
 lady fire always hope, lady fire who would  dare, 

first of year was so long, and the night was so young.

then arrived lady faire, 

loving temptress, loving him. 
her prince  waiting there

flying eagle and a raven may be odd, but united pair 
 their wings are bride, above the known seeking the rare 

my lady doth sleep, 
deeply  sleep  in heart of chair 

as the magic calling her 

little one.  

very deep, deeply sleep in my heart 
. . 

in my heart a golden chair


I remember when I delivered my daughter, 
Thinking as I held her in my arms, 
This miracle is what it’s all about, 
Who cares about the world and all its charm? 

I proudly presented Shari to her mother, 
By then my wife had calmed down, 
Our daughter seemed to struggle opening her eyes, 
While she cried and slowly looked around. 

Seeing the two of them together like that, 
Even caused a tear (or two)  to run down my face, 
For Your compassionate love, mercy & grace. 

I’ll never forget her first tiny little steps, 
Caught on the track video cam, 
Of course she stumbled several times at first, 
As the look on her face said, "today, yes I am." 

My goodness they sure do grow up fast, 
Even though you want the innocence to last, 
But then as they begin to grow and mature, 
Wanting them to stay young forever you’re not sure. 

One of the hardest things I ever had to do as a parent, 
Was teach my child to ride a bike without training wheels, 
I’ll never ever forget the huge smile on her year-old face, 
To both father and daughter it was such a very big deal. 

Working hard riding up a hill in the Metro Park, 
Through the grunts and groans I heard my child say, 
I feel like I’m going to have a baby, 
She was only years old on that day. 

That’s when I seriously began to wonder, 
As children all the wonders do they unconsciously know? 
Are they really born with the answers to the universe? 
Only to loose it as they continue to grow old. 

The next thing I knew we were in the lot of an old mall, 
She beamed brightly as I told her, "get behind the wheel, " 
And just a couple of weeks later she drove home, 
Like the bike without training wheels another big deal. 

Then there were all the times with my wife, 
Saturday dance class and her instrument a clarinet, 
More and more big smiles or our baby’s face, 
Many to remember & thankfully only a few to forget. 

Now she’s away doing just fine at college, 
And we can no longer hold her in our arms, 
That’s when the realization came upon us, 

Nor will any of us ever be able to make it through, 
It is not money, good luck, great looks or charm, 


Honour is flashed off exploit, so we say;
And those strokes once that gashed flesh or galled shield
Should tongue that time now, trumpet now that field,
And, on the fighter, forge his glorious day.
But be the war within, the brand we wield
Unseen, the heroic breast not outward-steeled,
Earth hears no hurtle then from fiercest fray. 

Earth, all, out; who, with trickling increment,
Veins violets and tall trees makes more and more)
Could crowd career with conquest while there went
Those years and years by of world without event
That in Majorca Alfonso watched the door. 




Proem. 

Yet thy loud Herald Fame, doth to the sky
Thy wondrous worth proclaim, in every clime, 
And so has vow'd, whilst there is world or time. 
So great's thy glory, and thine excellence, 
The sound thereof raps every human sense 
That men account it no impiety 
To say thou wert a fleshly Deity. 
Thousands bring off'rings (though out of date) 
Thy world of honours to accumulate. 
'Mongst hundred Hecatombs of roaring Verse, 
'Mine bleating stands before thy royal Hearse. 
Thou never didst, nor canst thou now disdain, 
T' accept the tribute of a loyal Brain. 
Thy clemency did yerst esteem as much
The acclamations of the poor, as rich, 
Which makes me deem, my rudeness is no wrong, 
Though I resound thy greatness 'mongst the throng. 

The Poem. 

No Ph{oe}nix Pen, nor Spenser's Poetry, 
No Speed's, nor Camden's learned History; 
Eliza's works, wars, praise, can e're compact, 
The World's the Theater where she did act. 
No memories, nor volumes can contain, 
The nine Olymp'ades of her happy reign, 
Who was so good, so just, so learn'd, so wise, 
From all the Kings on earth she won the prize. 
Nor say I more than truly is her due. 
Millions will testify that this is true. 
She hath wip'd off th' aspersion of her Sex, 
That women wisdom lack to play the Rex. 
Spain's Monarch sa's not so, not yet his Host: 
She taught them better manners to their cost. 
The Salic Law had not in force now been, 
But can you Doctors now this point dispute, 
She's argument enough to make you mute, 
Since first the Sun did run, his ne'er runn'd race, 
And earth had twice a year, a new old face; 
Since time was time, and man unmanly man, 
Come shew me such a Ph{oe}nix if you can. 
Was ever people better rul'd than hers? 
Was ever Land more happy, freed from stirs? 
Did ever wealth in England so abound? 
Her Victories in foreign Coasts resound? 
Ships more invincible than Spain's, her foe
She rack't, she sack'd, she sunk his Armadoe. 
Her stately Troops advanc'd to Lisbon's wall, 
Don Anthony in's right for to install. 
She frankly help'd Franks' (brave) distressed King, 
The States united now her fame do sing. 
She their Protectrix was, they well do know, 
Unto our dread Virago, what they owe. 
Her Nobles sacrific'd their noble blood, 
Nor men, nor coin she shap'd, to do them good. 
The rude untamed Irish she did quell, 
And Tiron bound, before her picture fell. 
Had ever Prince such Counsellors as she? 
Her self Minerva caus'd them so to be. 
Such Soldiers, and such Captains never seen, 
Her Sea-men through all straits the world did round, 
Terra incognitae might know her sound. 
Her Drake came laded home with Spanish gold, 
Her Essex took Cadiz, their Herculean hold. 
But time would fail me, so my wit would too, 
To tell of half she did, or she could do. 
Semiramis to her is but obscure; 
More infamy than fame she did procure. 
She plac'd her glory but on Babel's walls, 
World's wonder for a time, but yet it falls. 
Had put her Harness off, had she but seen
Our Amazon i' th' Camp at Tilbury,
(Judging all valour, and all Majesty) 
Within that Princess to have residence, 
And prostrate yielded to her Excellence. 
Dido first Foundress of proud Carthage walls 
(Who living consummates her Funerals), 
A great Eliza, but compar'd with ours, 
How vanisheth her glory, wealth, and powers.
Proud profuse Cleopatra, whose wrong name, 
Instead of glory, prov'd her Country's shame: 
Of her what worth in Story's to be seen, 
Zenobia, potent Empress of the East, 
And of all these without compare the best 
(Whom none but great Aurelius could quell) 
Her ashes not reviv'd more Ph{oe}nix she. 
Her personal perfections, who would tell, 
Must dip his Pen i' th' Heliconian Well, 
Which I may not, my pride doth but aspire 
To read what others write and then admire. 
Now say, have women worth, or have they none? 
Nay Masculines, you have thus tax'd us long, 
But she, though dead, will vindicate our wrong. 
Let such as say our sex is void of reason 
Know 'tis a slander now, but once was treason. 
O happy, happy, had those days still been, 
But happiness lies in a higher sphere. 
Then wonder not, Eliza moves not here. 
Full fraught with honour, riches, and with days, 
She set, she set, like Titan in his rays. 
No more shall rise or set such glorious Sun, 
Until the heaven's great revolution: 
If then new things, their old form must retain, 
Eliza shall rule Albian once again. 


Her Epitaph. 

O' th' Damask Rose, sprung from the white and red, 
Whose sweet perfume fills the all-filling air, 
This Rose is withered, once so lovely fair: 
On neither tree did grow such Rose before, 
The greater was our gain, our loss the more. 

Another. 

So blaze it fame, here's feathers for thy wings. 
Here lies the envy'd, yet unparallel'd Prince, 
Whose living virtues speak (though dead long since). 
If many worlds, as that fantastic framed, 
In every one, be her great glory famed




In hours of ebbing tide, oh trust not to the Sea!
It will come back to shore with redness of the morrow;
O don't believe in me when in the trance of sorrow
I swear I am no longer true to thee!

The waves will roll again in dazzling ecstasy,
From far away, with joy, to the beloved shore;
And I with breast aflame, beneath thy charm once more,
Shall haste to bring my liberty to thee

in humility
we grow bigger than ourselves
it never shrinks us


Only one cell in the frozen hive of night
is lit, or so it seems to us:
this Vietnamese cafe, with its oily light,
its odors whose colorful shapes are like flowers.
Laughter and talking, the tick of chopsticks.
Beyond the glass, the wintry city
creaks like an ancient wooden bridge.
A great wind rushes under all of us.
The bigger the window, the more it trembles. 

i could walk carefree
in tokyo streets and lanes
in october, november and early december 
in my T-Shirt treating it as spring but not january
when the temperature would suddenly take a dip
like an olympic swimmer with fiery ambition 
plunging into the pool
the chill bites into the most sensitive parts
near the chest, setting the bodice trembling, 
teeth hitting each other the way dad shunts his soroban beads 
shaking like the winter breeze on and off, on and off
throughout the lanes and streets
laughters, songs trail the ears 
on and off, on and off as the izakaya  door
opens to either welcome or sends off some customers
the cold and loneliness of the streets
make these drinking houses
feel like a happy family where children and parents
crowd together for their nightly fun
january in tokyo could either be warm or cold
for lovers to cling closer to each other in their  walk
for the homeless, everything  feels so colder than they  should be
their hearts take a dip each time they hear laughter and songs
from the izakaya

In January

Only one cell in the frozen hive of night
is lit, or so it seems to us: 
this Vietnamese cafe, with its oily light, 
its odors whose colorful shapes are like flowers.
Laughter and talking, the tick of chopsticks.
Beyond the glass, the wintry city
creaks like an ancient wooden bridge.
A great wind rushes under all of us.
The bigger the window, the more it trembles. 

In January it's so nice,
While slipping on the sliding ice,
To sip hot chicken soup with rice.
Sipping once, sipping twice,
Sipping chicken soup with rice. 

Goodbye, fame! Put someone else in my niche.
I’d swap a seat in the President’s jeep
for a warm corner in a ditch
where I could go soundly off to sleep.
Oh, how I would unload my fears, 
pour all my deadly, dreary pride
into the burdocks’ hairy ears
as I lay fidgeting on my side.
And I would wake up, with unshaven chin, 
amongst the bugs and little insects.
Oh how marvelously unknown! -
someone fit to dance gypsy steps.
Far off, people would grasp for power, 
hang by their nails from the top of the tower, 
but none of this would send me sour, 
in a ditch I would be lower.
And there, embracing a mangy dog, 
I would lie down and make my berth
in the friendly dust, holding dialogue
on the highest level-of the earth.
Alongside, the bare feet of a girl
would float innocently by, 
and pale blades of grass would twirl
down from the haycarts between me and the sky.
On a bench a smoker would toss out
a cigarette pack, squashed and empty, 
and from the label the twisted mouth
of Blok would sadly smile at me.




What glorious times she has lived! 
Bright days of enthusiasm for her activity
Surrounded by lots of friends and a happy family! 
Now treasuring plenty of gifts received. 

Clouds of gloom have come to fill the air. 
For family love and joy of life
She keeps struggling without a strife
Always facing it without despair

His beauty bore no token,
No sign our gladness shook;
With tender strength unbroken
The hand of Life he took:
But the summer flowers were falling,
Falling and fading away,
And mother birds were calling,
Crying and calling
For their loves that would not stay.

He knew not Autumn's chillness,
Nor Winter's wind nor Spring's.
He lived with Summer's stillness
And sun and sunlit things:
But when the dusk was falling
He went the shadowy way,
And one more heart is calling,
Crying and calling
For the love that would not stay. 

In life I sought neither wealth nor power, 
Nor ran after the pleasures of sense. 
Moderate in food and drink, 
I lived a controlled life, 

O what does the burning mouth
Of sun, burning in today's,
Sky, remind me


oh, yes, his
Mouth, and


his limbs like pale and
Carnivorous plants reaching
out for me, and the sad lie
of my unending lust.
Where is room, excuse or even
Need for love, for, isn't each
Embrace a complete thing a finished
Jigsaw, when mouth on mouth, i lie,
Ignoring my poor moody mind
While pleasure, with deliberate gaeity
Trumpets harshly into the silence of
the room- At noon
I watch the sleek crows flying
Like poison on wings-and at
Night, from behind the Burdwan
Road, the corpse-bearers cry ‘Bol,
Hari Bol' , a strange lacing
For moonless nights, while I walk
The verandah sleepless, a
Million questions awake in
Me, and all about him, and
This skin-communicated
Thing that I dare not yet in
His presence call our love.

[From Summer in Calcutta]Nothing is naked
unless everything is shown
Nothing is left
when everything is gone
In love all comes out
In love all comes out
that is what
Love is all about

Love welcomes the sunrise
love welcomes the night
Love comes walking
in plain sight
In love all comes out
In love all comes out
that is what
Love is all about

You can't  sweep it under the rug
because it won't go
Like a star in the sky
Love was meant to show
In love all comes out
In love all comes out
that is what
Love is all about


I've been in love for long
With what I cannot tell
And will contrive a song
For the intangible
That has no mould or shape,
From which there's no escape.

It is not even a name,
Yet is all constancy;
Tried or untried, the same,
It cannot part from me;
A breath, yet as still
As the established hill.

It is not any thing,
And yet all being is;
Being, being, being,
Its burden and its bliss. 
How can I ever prove
What it is I love?

This happy happy love
Is sieged with crying sorrows,
Crushed beneath and above
Between todays and morrows;
A little paradise
Held in the world's vice.

And there it is content
And careless as a child,
And in imprisonment
Flourishes sweet and wild;
In wrong, beyond wrong,
All the world's day long.

This love a moment known
For what I do not know
And in a moment gone
Is like the happy doe
That keeps its perfect laws
Between the tiger's paws
And vindicates its cause. 

In love profound, our hearts (truly)  we dip, 
Like the spring's warmth we cherish (all too)  deep.
Gives (even)  life eternal we let rip
To be virtuous with peace (done as)  we reap, 
Bountiful like the (warm and)  dulcet hip
Of the rose rich (with love)  to a great heap.
We plummet (within)  together to slip
(Densely)  in a locked away to love sleep.
In romance (found as)  cloying we kip, 
Love (we have)  tender for us to keep. 

between tick and tack
in love — an eternity
lived with whole your heart


The first time I saw you, 
I fell so deeply in love with you, 
I never even thought, there existed such a beauty, 
I didn’t even think it was reality.

I thought it was just a dream, 
A dream given by Him, 
And everytime the thought comes up, 
I always wish I would never wake up.

I don’t even care what you would say, 
I just want to have a way, 
To see you everyday, 
To talk to you if you may.

I guess it’s just a curse, 
Given to me by the source, 
To fall in love to such an angel, 
But never be able to mingle.

Just being a mere human, 
I feel really, really down, 
For I know that there could never be, 
A relationship with an angel and me. 

The feeling of love is euphoric
You're walking on clouds in the sky
A powerful rush of emotions
Produces the ultimate high

Mere thoughts of the object of your love
Bring comfort and warmth to your heart
These feelings give hope, and sustain you
Through seasons when you are apart

Real love is essential to living
Without it, new babies will die
And grownups who had it, and lost it
Can scarce do a thing, except crystress, stress, and more stress

i think i might be in love with stress
or stress is in love with me
stress always seems to find me
	relocate to be with me
and send me 
straight over the top

every circumstance brings stress
and when you let it in, it won't leave
stress is in love with me

i want to get everything done
and stress is in my way
over here and over there, 
sending my pressure higher
causing me more despair

stress, stress, and more stress

i think stress is in love with me
all day at work, 	
teasing and pleading
asking and begging
let me in, let me in

my stomach is in knots
my fingernails are low
my heart can't take it anymore
i think i'm in love with stress

can't eat, can't sleep
trying to get over you, 
but i can't, i won't
and the medicine won't help me

stress, stress, and more stress

i think i'm in love with stress, 
or stress is in love with me


O what a physical effect it has on me
To dive forever into the light blue sea
Of your acquaintance! Ah, but dearest friends,
Like forms, are finished, as life has ends! Still,
It is beautiful, when October
Is over, and February is over,
To sit in the starch of my shirt, and to dream of your sweet
Ways! As if the world were a taxi, you enter it, then
Reply (to no one), "Let's go five or six blocks

"
Isn't the blue stream that runs past you a translation from the Russian?
Aren't my eyes bigger than love?
Isn't this history, and aren't we a couple of ruins?
Is Carthage Pompeii? is the pillow the bed? is the sun
What glues our heads together? O midnight! O midnight!
Is love what we are,
Or has happiness come to me in a private car
That's so very small I'm amazed to see it there?

We walk through the park in the sun, and you say, "There's a spider
Of shadow touching the bench, when morning's begun

" I love you.
I love you fame I love you raining sun I love you cigarettes I love you love
I love you daggers I love smiles daggers and symbolism.

Inside the symposium of your sweetest look's
Sunflower awning by the nurse-faced chrysanthemums childhood
Again represents a summer spent sticking knives into porcelain raspberries, when China's
Still a country! Oh, King Edward abdicated years later, that's
Exactly when. If you were seventy thousand years old, and I were a pill,
I know I could cure your headache, like playing baseball in drinking-water, as baskets
Of towels sweetly touch the bathroom floor! O benches of nothing
Appear and reappear—electricity! I'd love to be how
You are, as if
The world were new, and the selves were blue
Which we don
Until it's dawn,
Until evening puts on
The gray hooded selves and the light brown selves of . . .
Water! your tear-colored nail polish
Kisses me! and the lumberyard seems new
As a calm
On the sea, where, like pigeons,
I feel so mutated, sad, so breezed, so revivified, and still so unabdicated—
Not like an edge of land coming over the sea

My heart tender all over you in many ways, 
Flickering like the vibrant sun that sends its rays
To keep you cozy and vivid throughout the days, 
With blissful serene so deep into you it lays
With the magnificent sound of pleasure that plays
To your pleasant nature well truly made with grace.
It is that well being of yours my heart did trace, 
For the feeling eternal quickened my heart's pace
To enclose you with the desire my heart took chase.
The appeal my heart has to have you in embrace. 

Life is difficult indeed
Race of very high speed
And of mad stampede
Among men trying to succeed.

I am lost in the proceed
None is paying me heed
Over me i don't have cede
I am like a lost sea weed.

Emotionally, how long i have to bleed
In the struggle of life, shall i concede? 
My self confidence is on the recede
For a micracle, i am in desperate need.

In making bodies Love could not express
Itself, or art, unless it made them less.
O what a monster had in man been seen,
Had every thumb or toe a mountain been!
What worlds must he devour when he did eat?
What oceans drink! yet could not all his meat,
Or stature, make him like an angel shine ;
Or make his Soul in Glory more Divine.
A Soul it is that makes us truly great,
Whose little bodies make us more complete.
An understanding that is infinite,
An endless, wide, and everlasting sight,
That can enjoy all things and nought exclude,
Is the most sacred greatness may be viewed.
'Twas inconvenient that his bulk should be
An endless hill ; he nothing then could see:
No figure have, no motion, beauty, place,
No colour, feature, member, light, or grace.
A body like a mountain is but cumber.
An endless body is but idle lumber:
It spoils converse, and time itself devours,
While meat in vain, in feeding idle powers;
Excessive bulk being most injurious found,
To those conveniences which men have crowned:
His wisdom did His power here repress,

Yes, I will spend the livelong day 
With Nature in this month of May; 
And sit beneath the trees, and share 
My bread with birds whose homes are there; 
While cows lie down to eat, and sheep 
Stand to their necks in grass so deep; 
While birds do sing with all their might, 
As though they felt the earth in flight. 
This is the hour I dreamed of, when 
I sat surrounded by poor men; 
And thought of how the Arab sat 
Alone at evening, gazing at 
The stars that bubbled in clear skies; 

And of young dreamers, when their eyes 
Enjoyed methought a precious boon 
In the adventures of the Moon 
Whose light, behind the Clouds' dark bars, 
Searched for her stolen flocks of stars. 
When I, hemmed in by wrecks of men, 
Thought of some lonely cottage then 
Full of sweet books; and miles of sea, 
With passing ships, in front of me; 
And having, on the other hand, 
A flowery, green, bird-singing land. 

In me, past, present, future meet
To hold long chiding conference.
My lusts usurp the present tense
And strangle Reason in his seat.
My loves leap through the future’s fence
To dance with dream-enfranchised feet.

In me the cave-man clasps the seer,
And garlanded Apollo goes
Chanting to Abraham’s deaf ear.
In me the tiger sniffs the rose.
Look in my heart, kind friends, and tremble,
Since there your elements assemble. 

O living will that shalt endure
When all that seems shall suffer shock,
Rise in the spiritual rock,
Flow thro' our deeds and make them pure, 

That we may lift from out of dust
A voice as unto him that hears,
A cry above the conquer'd years
To one that with us works, and trust, 

With faith that comes of self-control,
The truths that never can be proved
Until we close with all we loved,
And all we flow from, soul in soul. 

O true and tried, so well and long,
Demand not thou a marriage lay;
In that it is thy marriage day
Is music more than any song. 

Nor have I felt so much of bliss
Since first he told me that he loved
A daughter of our house; nor proved
Since that dark day a day like this; 

Tho' I since then have number'd o'er
Some thrice three years: they went and came,
Remade the blood and changed the frame,
And yet is love not less, but more; 

No longer caring to embalm
In dying songs a dead regret,
But like a statue solid-set,
And moulded in colossal calm. 

Regret is dead, but love is more
Than in the summers that are flown,
For I myself with these have grown
To something greater than before; 

Which makes appear the songs I made
As echoes out of weaker times,
As half but idle brawling rhymes,
The sport of random sun and shade. 

But where is she, the bridal flower,
That must be made a wife ere noon?
She enters, glowing like the moon
Of Eden on its bridal bower: 

On me she bends her blissful eyes
And then on thee; they meet thy look
And brighten like the star that shook
Betwixt the palms of paradise. 

O when her life was yet in bud,
He too foretold the perfect rose.
For thee she grew, for thee she grows
For ever, and as fair as good. 

And thou art worthy; full of power;
As gentle; liberal-minded, great,
Consistent; wearing all that weight
Of learning lightly like a flower. 

But now set out: the noon is near,
And I must give away the bride;
She fears not, or with thee beside
And me behind her, will not fear. 

For I that danced her on my knee,
That watch'd her on her nurse's arm,
That shielded all her life from harm
At last must part with her to thee; 

Now waiting to be made a wife,
Her feet, my darling, on the dead;
Their pensive tablets round her head,
And the most living words of life 

Breathed in her ear. The ring is on,
The "wilt thou" answer'd, and again
The "wilt thou" ask'd, till out of twain
Her sweet "I will" has made you one. 

Now sign your names, which shall be read,
Mute symbols of a joyful morn,
By village eyes as yet unborn;
The names are sign'd, and overhead 

Begins the clash and clang that tells
The joy to every wandering breeze;
The blind wall rocks, and on the trees
The dead leaf trembles to the bells. 

O happy hour, and happier hours
Await them. Many a merry face
Salutes them--maidens of the place,
That pelt us in the porch with flowers. 

O happy hour, behold the bride
With him to whom her hand I gave.
They leave the porch, they pass the grave
That has to-day its sunny side. 

To-day the grave is bright for me,
For them the light of life increased,
Who stay to share the morning feast,
Who rest to-night beside the sea. 

Let all my genial spirits advance
To meet and greet a whiter sun;
My drooping memory will not shun
The foaming grape of eastern France. 

It circles round, and fancy plays,
And hearts are warm'd and faces bloom,
As drinking health to bride and groom
We wish them store of happy days. 

Nor count me all to blame if I
Conjecture of a stiller guest,
Perchance, perchance, among the rest,
And, tho' in silence, wishing joy. 

But they must go, the time draws on,
And those white-favour'd horses wait;
They rise, but linger; it is late;
Farewell, we kiss, and they are gone. 

A shade falls on us like the dark
From little cloudlets on the grass,
But sweeps away as out we pass
To range the woods, to roam the park, 

Discussing how their courtship grew,
And talk of others that are wed,
And how she look'd, and what he said,
And back we come at fall of dew. 

Again the feast, the speech, the glee,
The shade of passing thought, the wealth
Of words and wit, the double health,
The crowning cup, the three-times-three, 

And last the dance,--till I retire:
Dumb is that tower which spake so loud,
And high in heaven the streaming cloud,
And on the downs a rising fire: 

And rise, O moon, from yonder down,
Till over down and over dale
All night the shining vapour sail
And pass the silent-lighted town, 

The white-faced halls, the glancing rills,
And catch at every mountain head,
And o'er the friths that branch and spread
Their sleeping silver thro' the hills; 

And touch with shade the bridal doors,
With tender gloom the roof, the wall;
And breaking let the splendour fall
To spangle all the happy shores 

By which they rest, and ocean sounds,
And, star and system rolling past,
A soul shall draw from out the vast
And strike his being into bounds, 

And, moved thro' life of lower phase,
Result in man, be born and think,
And act and love, a closer link
Betwixt us and the crowning race 

Of those that, eye to eye, shall look
On knowledge; under whose command
Is Earth and Earth's, and in their hand
Is Nature like an open book; 

No longer half-akin to brute,
For all we thought and loved and did,
And hoped, and suffer'd, is but seed
Of what in them is flower and fruit; 

Whereof the man, that with me trod
This planet, was a noble type
Appearing ere the times were ripe,

And one far-off divine event,
To which the whole creation moves. 

In Memoriam

What's missing is the eyeballs
in each of us, but it doesn't matter
because you've got the bucks, the bucks, the bucks.
You let me touch them, fondle the green faces
lick at their numbers and it lets you be
my 'Daddy!' 'Daddy!' and though I fought all alone
with molesters and crooks, I knew your money
would save me, your courage, your 'I've had
considerable experience as a soldier-
fighting to win millions for myself, it's true.
But I did win,' and me praying for 'our men out there'
just made it okay to be an orphan whose blood was no one's,
whose curls were hung up on a wire machine and electrified,
while you built and unbuilt intrigues called nations,
and did in the bad ones, always, always,
always came when my heart stood naked in the street
and they threw apples at it or twelve-day-old-dead-fish.

'Daddy!' 'Daddy,' we all won that war,
when you sang me the money songs
,  you sang
and I knew you drove a pure gold car
and put diamonds in you coke
for the crunchy sound, the adorable sound
and the moon too was in your portfolio,
as well as the ocean with its sleepy dead.
And I was always brave, wasn't I?
I never bled?
I never saw a man expose himself.
No. No.
I never saw a drunkard in his blubber.
I never let lightning go in one car and out the other.
And all the men out there were never to come.
Never, like a deluge, to swim over my breasts
and lay their lamps in my insides.
No. No.
Just me and my 'Daddy'
and his tempestuous bucks
rolling in them like corn flakes
and only the bad ones died.

But I died yesterday,
'Daddy,' I died,
swallowing the Nazi-Jap animal
and it won't get out
it keeps knocking at my eyes,
my big orphan eyes,
kicking! Until eyeballs pop out
and even my dog puts up his four feet
and lets go
of his military secret
with his big red tongue
flying up and down
like yours should have

as we board our velvet train. 

I mourn upon this battle-field,
But not for those who perished here.
Behold the river-bank
Whither the angry farmers came,
In sloven dress and broken rank,
Nor thought of fame.
Their deed of blood
All mankind praise;
Even the serene Reason says,
It was well done.
The wise and simple have one glance
To greet yon stern head-stone,
Which more of pride than pity gave
To mark the Briton's friendless grave.
Yet it is a stately tomb;
The grand return
Of eve and morn,
The year's fresh bloom,
The silver cloud,
Might grace the dust that is most proud.

Yet not of these I muse
In this ancestral place,
But of a kindred face
That never joy or hope shall here diffuse.

Ah, brother of the brief but blazing star!
What hast thou to do with these
Haunting this bank's historic trees?
Thou born for noblest life,
For action's field, for victor's car,
Thou living champion of the right?
To these their penalty belonged:
I grudge not these their bed of death,
But thine to thee, who never wronged
The poorest that drew breath.

All inborn power that could
Consist with homage to the good
Flamed from his martial eye;
He who seemed a soldier born,
He should have the helmet worn,
All friends to fend, all foes defy,
Frowning down the evil-doer,
Battling for the weak and poor.
His from youth the leader's look
Gave the law which others took,
And never poor beseeching glance
Shamed that sculptured countenance.

There is no record left on earth,
Save in tablets of the heart,
Of the rich inherent worth,
Of the grace that on him shone,
Of eloquent lips, of joyful wit;
He could not frame a word unfit,
An act unworthy to be done;
Honour prompted every glance,
Honour came and sat beside him,
In lowly cot or painful road,
And evermore the cruel god
Cried, 'Onward!' and the palm-crown showed.
Born for success he seemed,
With grace to win, with heart to hold,
With shining gifts that took all eyes,
With budding power in college-halls,
As pledged in coming days to forge
Weapons to guard the State, or scourge
Tyrants despite their guards or walls.
On his young promise Beauty smiled,
Drew his free homage unbeguiled,
And prosperous Age held out his hand,
And richly his large future planned,
And troops of friends enjoyed the tide,--
All, all was given, and only health denied.

I see him with superior smile
Hunted by Sorrow's grisly train
In lands remote, in toil and pain,
With angel patience labour on,
With the high port he wore erewhile,
When, foremost of the youthful band,
The prizes in all lists he won;
Nor bate one jot of heart or hope,
And, least of all, the loyal tie
Which holds to home 'neath every sky,
The joy and pride the pilgrim feels
In hearts which round the hearth at home
Keep pulse for pulse with those who roam.

What generous beliefs console
The brave whom Fate denies the goal!
If others reach it, is content;
To Heaven's high will his will is bent.
Firm on his heart relied,
What lot soe'er betide,
Work of his hand
He nor repents nor grieves,
Pleads for itself the fact,
As unrepenting Nature leaves
Her every act.

Fell the bolt on the branching oak;
The rainbow of his hope was broke;
No craven cry, no secret tear,--
He told no pang, he knew no fear;
Its peace sublime his aspect kept,
His purpose woke, his features slept;
And yet between the spasms of pain
His genius beamed with joy again.

O'er thy rich dust the endless smile
Of Nature in thy Spanish isle
Hints never loss or cruel break
And sacrifice for love's dear sake,
Nor mourn the unalterable Days
That Genius goes and Folly stays.
What matters how, or from what ground,
The freed soul its Creator found?
Alike thy memory embalms
That orange-grove, that isle of palms,
And these loved banks, whose oak-boughs bold
Root in the blood of heroes old. 

I envy not in any moods
The captive void of noble rage,
The linnet born within the cage,
That never knew the summer woods:

I envy not the beast that takes
His license in the field of time,
Unfetter'd by the sense of crime,
To whom a conscience never wakes;

Nor, what may count itself as blest,
The heart that never plighted troth
But stagnates in the weeds of sloth;
Nor any want-begotten rest.

I hold it true, whate'er befall;
I feel it, when I sorrow most;
'Tis better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all. 

O Sorrow, cruel fellowship,
O Priestess in the vaults of Death,
O sweet and bitter in a breath,
What whispers from thy lying lip? 

"The stars," she whispers, "blindly run;
A web is wov'n across the sky;
From out waste places comes a cry,
And murmurs from the dying sun: 

"And all the phantom, Nature, stands--
With all the music in her tone,
A hollow echo of my own,--
A hollow form with empty hands
 


And shall I take a thing so blind,
Embrace her as my natural good;
Or crush her, like a vice of blood,
Upon the threshold of the mind

His mother from celestial bower,
In the self same day and hour
Of her death, or Heavenly birth,
Gazed again upon the earth-
And saw her gentle, loving boy,
Once source of fond maternal joy,
In anguish, on a couch of pain,
She knew that earthly hopes were vain,
And beckoned him to realms above,
To share, with her, the Heavenly love. 

I wage not any feud with Death
For changes wrought on form and face;
No lower life that earth's embrace
May breed with him, can fright my faith. 

Eternal process moving on,
From state to state the spirit walks;
And these are but the shatter'd stalks,
Or ruin'd chrysalis of one. 

Nor blame I Death, because he bare
The use of virtue out of earth:
I know transplanted human worth
Will bloom to profit, otherwhere. 

For this alone on Death I wreak
The wrath that garners in my heart;
He put our lives so far apart
We cannot hear each other speak. 

Contemplate all this work of Time,
        The giant labouring in his youth;
        Nor dream of human love and truth,
    As dying Nature's earth and lime;
    But trust that those we call the dead
        Are breathers of an ampler day
        For ever nobler ends. They say,
    The solid earth whereon we tread
    In tracts of fluent heat began,
       And grew to seeming-random forms,
       The seeming prey of cyclic storms,
   Till at the last arose the man;

   Who throve and branch'd from clime to clime,
       The herald of a higher race,
       And of himself in higher place,
   If so he type this work of time

   Within himself, from more to more;
       Or, crown'd with attributes of woe
       Like glories, move his course, and show
   That life is not as idle ore,

   But iron dug from central gloom,
       And heated hot with burning fears,
       And dipt in baths of hissing tears,
   And batter'd with the shocks of doom

   To shape and use. Arise and fly
       The reeling Faun, the sensual feast;
       Move upward, working out the beast,
   And let the ape and tiger die. 

Sad Hesper o'er the buried sun
        And ready, thou, to die with him,
        Thou watchest all things ever dim
    And dimmer, and a glory done:
    The team is loosen'd from the wain,
        The boat is drawn upon the shore;
        Thou listenest to the closing door,
    And life is darken'd in the brain.
    Bright Phosphor, fresher for the night,
       By thee the world's great work is heard
       Beginning, and the wakeful bird;
   Behind thee comes the greater light:

   The market boat is on the stream,
       And voices hail it from the brink;
       Thou hear'st the village hammer clink,
   And see'st the moving of the team.

   Sweet Hesper-Phosphor, double name
       For what is one, the first, the last,
       Thou, like my present and my past,
   Thy place is changed; thou art the same. 

        And in his presence I attend
        To hear the tidings of my friend,
    Which every hour his couriers bring.
        And will be, tho' as yet I keep
        Within his court on earth, and sleep
    Encompass'd by his faithful guard,
    And hear at times a sentinel
       Who moves about from place to place,
       And whispers to the worlds of space,
   In the deep night, that all is well. 

O living will that shalt endure
        When all that seems shall suffer shock,
        Rise in the spiritual rock,
    Flow thro' our deeds and make them pure,
    That we may lift from out of dust
        A voice as unto him that hears,
        A cry above the conquer'd years
    To one that with us works, and trust,
    With faith that comes of self-control,
       The truths that never can be proved
       Until we close with all we loved,
   And all we flow from, soul in soul.------

   O true and tried, so well and long,
       Demand not thou a marriage lay;
       In that it is thy marriage day
   Is music more than any song.

   Nor have I felt so much of bliss
       Since first he told me that he loved
       A daughter of our house; nor proved
   Since that dark day a day like this; 

   Tho' I since then have number'd o'er
       Some thrice three years: they went and came,
       Remade the blood and changed the frame,
   And yet is love not less, but more;

   No longer caring to embalm
       In dying songs a dead regret,
       But like a statue solid-set,
   And moulded in colossal calm.

   Regret is dead, but love is more
       Than in the summers that are flown,
       For I myself with these have grown
   To something greater than before;

   Which makes appear the songs I made
       As echoes out of weaker times,
       As half but idle brawling rhymes,
   The sport of random sun and shade.

   But where is she, the bridal flower,
       That must be made a wife ere noon?
       She enters, glowing like the moon
   Of Eden on its bridal bower:

   On me she bends her blissful eyes
       And then on thee; they meet thy look
       And brighten like the star that shook
   Betwixt the palms of paradise.

   O when her life was yet in bud,
       He too foretold the perfect rose.
       For thee she grew, for thee she grows
   For ever, and as fair as good.

   And thou art worthy; full of power;
       As gentle; liberal-minded, great,
       Consistent; wearing all that weight
   Of learning lightly like a flower.

   But now set out: the noon is near,
       And I must give away the bride;
       She fears not, or with thee beside
   And me behind her, will not fear.

   For I that danced her on my knee,
       That watch'd her on her nurse's arm,
       That shielded all her life from harm
    At last must part with her to thee;

   Now waiting to be made a wife,
       Her feet, my darling, on the dead;
       Their pensive tablets round her head,
   And the most living words of life

   Breathed in her ear. The ring is on,
       The "wilt thou" answer'd, and again
       The "wilt thou" ask'd, till out of twain
   Her sweet "I will" has made you one.

   Now sign your names, which shall be read,
       Mute symbols of a joyful morn,
       By village eyes as yet unborn;
   The names are sign'd, and overhead

   Begins the clash and clang that tells
       The joy to every wandering breeze;
       The blind wall rocks, and on the trees
   The dead leaf trembles to the bells.

   O happy hour, and happier hours
       Await them. Many a merry face
       Salutes them--maidens of the place,
   That pelt us in the porch with flowers.

   O happy hour, behold the bride
       With him to whom her hand I gave.
       They leave the porch, they pass the grave
   That has to-day its sunny side.

   To-day the grave is bright for me,
       For them the light of life increased,
       Who stay to share the morning feast,
   Who rest to-night beside the sea.

   Let all my genial spirits advance
       To meet and greet a whiter sun;
       My drooping memory will not shun
   The foaming grape of eastern France.

   It circles round, and fancy plays,
       And hearts are warm'd and faces bloom,
       As drinking health to bride and groom
   We wish them store of happy days.

   Nor count me all to blame if I
       Conjecture of a stiller guest,
       Perchance, perchance, among the rest,
  And, tho' in silence, wishing joy.


  But they must go, the time draws on,
     And those white-favour'd horses wait;
     They rise, but linger; it is late;
  Farewell, we kiss, and they are gone.


  A shade falls on us like the dark
     From little cloudlets on the grass,
     But sweeps away as out we pass
  To range the woods, to roam the park,


  Discussing how their courtship grew,
     And talk of others that are wed,
     And how she look'd, and what he said,
  And back we come at fall of dew.


  Again the feast, the speech, the glee,
     The shade of passing thought, the wealth
     Of words and wit, the double health,
  The crowning cup, the three-times-three,


  And last the dance,--till I retire:
     Dumb is that tower which spake so loud,
     And high in heaven the streaming cloud,
  And on the downs a rising fire:


  And rise, O moon, from yonder down,
     Till over down and over dale
     All night the shining vapour sail
  And pass the silent-lighted town,


  The white-faced halls, the glancing rills,
     And catch at every mountain head,
     And o'er the friths that branch and spread
  Their sleeping silver thro' the hills;


  And touch with shade the bridal doors,
     With tender gloom the roof, the wall;
     And breaking let the splendour fall
  To spangle all the happy shores


  By which they rest, and ocean sounds,
     And, star and system rolling past,
     A soul shall draw from out the vast
  And strike his being into bounds,


  And, moved thro' life of lower phase,
     Result in man, be born and think,
     And act and love, a closer link
  Betwixt us and the crowning race


  Of those that, eye to eye, shall look
     On knowledge; under whose command
     Is Earth and Earth's, and in their hand
  Is Nature like an open book;


  No longer half-akin to brute,
     For all we thought and loved and did,
     And hoped, and suffer'd, is but seed
  Of what in them is flower and fruit;


  Whereof the man, that with me trod
     This planet, was a noble type
     Appearing ere the times were ripe,


     And one far-off divine event,
  To which the whole creation moves. 

To-night the winds begin to rise
        And roar from yonder dropping day:
        The last red leaf is whirl'd away,
    The rooks are blown about the skies;
    The forest crack'd, the waters curl'd,
        The cattle huddled on the lea;
        And wildly dash'd on tower and tree
    The sunbeam strikes along the world:
    And but for fancies, which aver
       That all thy motions gently pass
       Athwart a plane of molten glass,
   I scarce could brook the strain and stir

   That makes the barren branches loud;
       And but for fear it is not so,
       The wild unrest that lives in woe
   Would dote and pore on yonder cloud

   That rises upward always higher,
       And onward drags a labouring breast,
       And topples round the dreary west,
   A looming bastion fringed with fire. 

I envy not in any moods 
      The captive void of noble rage,
      The linnet born within the cage,
   That never knew the summer woods:
   I envy not the beast that takes
      His license in the field of time,
      Unfetter'd by the sense of crime,
   To whom a conscience never wakes;
   Nor, what may count itself as blest,
    The heart that never plighted troth
    But stagnates in the weeds of sloth;
  Nor any want-begotten rest.

  I hold it true, whate'er befall;
    I feel it, when I sorrow most;
    'Tis better to have loved and lost
  Than never to have loved at all. 

Old Yew, which graspest at the stones 
        That name the under-lying dead,
        Thy fibres net the dreamless head,
    Thy roots are wrapt about the bones.
    The seasons bring the flower again,
        And bring the firstling to the flock;
        And in the dusk of thee, the clock
    Beats out the little lives of men.
    O not for thee the glow, the bloom,
       Who changest not in any gale,
       Nor branding summer suns avail
   To touch thy thousand years of gloom:

   And gazing on thee, sullen tree,
       Sick for thy stubborn hardihood,
       I seem to fail from out my blood
   And grow incorporate into thee. 

The path by which we twain did go,
        Which led by tracts that pleased us well,
        Thro' four sweet years arose and fell,
    From flower to flower, from snow to snow:
    And we with singing cheer'd the way,
        And, crown'd with all the season lent,
        From April on to April went,
    And glad at heart from May to May:
    But where the path we walk'd began
       To slant the fifth autumnal slope,
       As we descended following Hope,
   There sat the Shadow fear'd of man;

   Who broke our fair companionship,
       And spread his mantle dark and cold,
       And wrapt thee formless in the fold,
   And dull'd the murmur on thy lip,

   And bore thee where I could not see
       Nor follow, tho' I walk in haste,
       And think, that somewhere in the waste
   The Shadow sits and waits for me. 

Old warder of these buried bones,
        And answering now my random stroke
        With fruitful cloud and living smoke,
    Dark yew, that graspest at the stones
    And dippest toward the dreamless head,
        To thee too comes the golden hour
        When flower is feeling after flower;
    But Sorrow--fixt upon the dead,
    And darkening the dark graves of men,--
       What whisper'd from her lying lips?
       Thy gloom is kindled at the tips,
   And passes into gloom again. 

How fares it with the happy dead?
        For here the man is more and more;
        But he forgets the days before
    The days have vanish'd, tone and tint,
        And yet perhaps the hoarding sense
        Gives out at times (he knows not whence)
    A little flash, a mystic hint;
    And in the long harmonious years
       (If Death so taste Lethean springs),
       May some dim touch of earthly things
   Surprise thee ranging with thy peers.

   If such a dreamy touch should fall,
       O turn thee round, resolve the doubt;
       My guardian angel will speak out
   In that high place, and tell thee all. 

The baby new to earth and sky,
        What time his tender palm is prest
        Against the circle of the breast,
    Has never thought that "this is I":
    But as he grows he gathers much,
        And learns the use of "I," and "me,"
        And finds "I am not what I see,
    And other than the things I touch

"
    So rounds he to a separate mind
       From whence clear memory may begin,
       As thro' the frame that binds him in
   His isolation grows defined.

   This use may lie in blood and breath
       Which else were fruitless of their due,
       Had man to learn himself anew
   Beyond the second birth of Death. 

I sometimes hold it half a sin
      To put in words the grief I feel;
      For words, like Nature, half reveal
   And half conceal the Soul within.
   But, for the unquiet heart and brain,
      A use in  measured language lies;
      The sad mechanic exercise,
   Like dull narcotics, numbing pain.
   In words, like weeds, I'll wrap me o'er,
     Like coarsest clothes against the cold;
     But that large grief which these enfold
  Is given in outline and no more. 

Be near me when my light is low,
	When the blood creeps, and the nerves prick
	And tingle; and the heart is sick,
And all the wheels of Being slow.

Be near me when the sensuous frame
	Is racked with pangs that conquer trust;
	And Time, a maniac scattering dust,
And Life, a Fury slinging flame.

Be near me when my faith is dry,
	And men the flies of latter spring,
	That lay their eggs, and sting and sing
And weave their petty cells and die.

Be near me when I fade away,
	To point the term of human strife,
	And on the low dark verge of life
The twilight of eternal day. 

Oh, yet we trust that somehow good
      Will be the final end of ill,
      To pangs of nature, sins of will,
   Defects of doubt, and taints of blood;
   That nothing walks with aimless feet;
      That not one life shall be destroy'd,
      Or cast as rubbish to the void,
   That not a worm is cloven in vain;
     That not a moth with vain desire
     I shrivell'd in a fruitless fire,
  Or but subserves another's gain.

  Behold, we know not anything;
     I can but trust that good shall fall
     At last--far off--at last, to all,
  And every winter change to spring.

  So runs my dream: but what am I?
     An infant crying in the night:
     An infant crying for the light:
  And with no language but a cry. 

The wish, that of the living whole 
        No life may fail beyond the grave,
        Derives it not from what we have
        That Nature lends such evil dreams?
        So careful of the type she seems,
    So careless of the single life;
    That I, considering everywhere
       Her secret meaning in her deeds,
       And finding that of fifty seeds
   She often brings but one to bear,

   I falter where I firmly trod,
       And falling with my weight of cares
       Upon the great world's altar-stairs

   I stretch lame hands of faith, and grope,
       And gather dust and chaff, and call
   And faintly trust the larger hope

"So careful of the type?" but no.
        From scarped cliff and quarried stone
        She cries, "A thousand types are gone:
    I care for nothing, all shall go.
    "Thou makest thine appeal to me:
        I bring to life, I bring to death:
        The spirit does but mean the breath:
    I know no more

" And he, shall he,
    Man, her last work, who seem'd so fair,
       Such splendid purpose in his eyes,
       Who roll'd the psalm to wintry skies,
   Who built him fanes of fruitless prayer,

       And love Creation's final law--
       Tho' Nature, red in tooth and claw
   With ravine, shriek'd against his creed--

   Who loved, who suffer'd countless ills,
       Who battled for the True, the Just,
       Be blown about the desert dust,
   Or seal'd within the iron hills?

   No more? A monster then, a dream,
       A discord. Dragons of the prime,
       That tare each other in their slime,
   Were mellow music match'd with him.

   O life as futile, then, as frail!
       O for thy voice to soothe and bless!
       What hope of answer, or redress?
   Behind the veil, behind the veil. 

One writes, that "Other friends remain," 
     That "Loss is common to the race"--
     And common is the commonplace,
   And vacant chaff well meant for grain.
   That loss is common would not make
     My own less bitter, rather more.
     Too common! Never morning wore
   To evening, but some heart did break.
   O father, wheresoe'er thou be,
     Who pledgest now thy gallant son,
     A shot, ere half thy draught be done,
  Hath still'd the life that beat from thee.

     Thy sailor,--while thy head is bow'd,
     His heavy-shotted hammock-shroud
  Drops in his vast and wandering grave.

   Ye know no more than I who wrought
     At that last hour to please him well;
     Who mused on all I had to tell,
   And something written, something thought;

  Expecting still his advent home;
     And ever met him on his way
     With wishes, thinking, "here to-day,"
  Or "here to-morrow will he come


  O somewhere, meek, unconscious dove,
     That sitteth ranging golden hair;
     And glad to find thyself so fair,
  Poor child, that waiteth for thy love!

  For now her father's chimney glows
     In expectation of a guest;
     And thinking "this will please him best,"
  She takes a riband or a rose;

  For he will see them on to-night;
     And with the thought her colour burns;
     And, having left the glass, she turns
  Once more to set a ringlet right;

  And, even when she turn'd, the curse
     Was drown'd in passing thro' the ford,
  Or kill'd in falling from his horse.

  O what to her shall be the end?
     And what to me remains of good?
     To her, perpetual maidenhood,
  And unto me no second friend. 

When on my bed the moonlight falls,
        I know that in thy place of rest
        By that broad water of the west,
    There comes a glory on the walls:
    Thy marble bright in dark appears,
        As slowly steals a silver flame
        Along the letters of thy name,
    And o'er the number of thy years.
    The mystic glory swims away;
       From off my bed the moonlight dies;
       And closing eaves of wearied eyes
   I sleep till dusk is dipt in gray:

   And then I know the mist is drawn
       A lucid veil from coast to coast,
       And in the dark church like a ghost
   Thy tablet glimmers to the dawn. 

Dark house, by which once more I stand 
        Here in the long unlovely street,
        Doors, where my heart was used to beat
    So quickly, waiting for a hand,
    A hand that can be clasp'd no more--
        Behold me, for I cannot sleep,
        And like a guilty thing I creep
    At earliest morning to the door.
    He is not here; but far away
       The noise of life begins again,
       And ghastly thro' the drizzling rain
   On the bald street breaks the blank day. 

Risest thou thus, dim dawn, again,
        And howlest, issuing out of night,
        With blasts that blow the poplar white,
    And lash with storm the streaming pane?
    Day, when my crown'd estate begun
        To pine in that reverse of doom,
        Which sicken'd every living bloom,
    And blurr'd the splendour of the sun;
    Who usherest in the dolorous hour
       With thy quick tears that make the rose
       Pull sideways, and the daisy close
   Her crimson fringes to the shower;

   Who might'st have heaved a windless flame
       Up the deep East, or, whispering, play'd
       A chequer-work of beam and shade
   Along the hills, yet look'd the same.

   As wan, as chill, as wild as now;
       Day, mark'd as with some hideous crime,
       When the dark hand struck down thro' time,
   And cancell'd nature's best: but thou,

   Lift as thou may'st thy burthen'd brows
       Thro' clouds that drench the morning star,
       And whirl the ungarner'd sheaf afar,
   And sow the sky with flying boughs,

   And up thy vault with roaring sound
       Climb thy thick noon, disastrous day;
       Touch thy dull goal of joyless gray,
   And hide thy shame beneath the ground. 

        The silent snow possess'd the earth,

    The yule-log sparkled keen with frost,
        No wing of wind the region swept,
        But over all things brooding slept
    The quiet sense of something lost.

    As in the winters left behind,
      Again our ancient games had place,
      The mimic picture's breathing grace,
  And dance and song and hoodman-blind.

  Who show'd a token of distress?
      No single tear, no mark of pain:
      O sorrow, then can sorrow wane?
  O grief, can grief be changed to less?

  O last regret, regret can die!
      No--mixt with all this mystic frame,
      Her deep relations are the same,
  But with long use her tears are dry. 

Risest thou thus, dim dawn, again,
        So loud with voices of the birds,
        So thick with lowings of the herds,
    Day, when I lost the flower of men;
    Who tremblest thro' thy darkling red
        On yon swoll'n brook that bubbles fast
        By meadows breathing of the past,
    And woodlands holy to the dead;
    Who murmurest in the foliaged eaves
       A song that slights the coming care,
       And Autumn laying here and there
   A fiery finger on the leaves;

   Who wakenest with thy balmy breath
       To myriads on the genial earth,
       Memories of bridal, or of birth,
   And unto myriads more, of death.

   O wheresoever those may be,
       Betwixt the slumber of the poles,
       To-day they count as kindred souls;
   They know me not, but mourn with me. 

Is it, then, regret for buried time
        That keenlier in sweet April wakes,
        And meets the year, and gives and takes
    The colours of the crescent prime?
    Not all: the songs, the stirring air,
        The life re-orient out of dust,
        Cry thro' the sense to hearten trust
    In that which made the world so fair.
    Not all regret: the face will shine
       Upon me, while I muse alone;
       And that dear voice, I once have known,
   Still speak to me of me and mine:

   Yet less of sorrow lives in me
       For days of happy commune dead;
       Less yearning for the friendship fled,
   Than some strong bond which is to be. 

Whom we, that have not seen thy face,
By faith, and faith alone, embrace,
Believing where we cannot prove;
Thine are these orbs of light and shade;
Thou madest Life in man and brute;
Thou madest Death; and lo, thy foot
Is on the skull which thou hast made.
Thou wilt not leave us in the dust:
Thou madest man, he knows not why,
He thinks he was not made to die;
And thou hast made him: thou art just.

Thou seemest human and divine,
The highest, holiest manhood, thou.
Our wills are ours, we know not how,
Our wills are ours, to make them thine.

Our little systems have their day;
They have their day and cease to be:
They are but broken lights of thee,

We have but faith: we cannot know;
For knowledge is of things we see;
And yet we trust it comes from thee,
A beam in darkness: let it grow.

Let knowledge grow from more to more,
But more of reverence in us dwell;
That mind and soul, according well,
May make one music as before,

But vaster. We are fools and slight;
We mock thee when we do not fear:
But help thy foolish ones to bear;
Help thy vain worlds to bear thy light.

Forgive what seem'd my sin in me,
What seem'd my worth since I began;
For merit lives from man to man,

Forgive my grief for one removed,
Thy creature, whom I found so fair.
I trust he lives in thee, and there
I find him worthier to be loved.

Forgive these wild and wandering cries,
Confusions of a wasted youth;
Forgive them where they fail in truth,
And in thy wisdom make me wise. 

Last Spring I stood
in front of the bronze statue
they’ve put up in your honour
on the banks of the Neva
not far from the prison's red wall
just as, half in jest, you requested it, 
never expecting this.  

the thaw had just started
and a white snow crystal, already half transparent, 
melted in the corner of your bronze eye
as if it were a tear

I watched it slide down Spring's warming bronze, 
down past your name on the base, 
across the trodden snow of the pavement, 
into the Neva whose memory is time itself, 
and as it joined the river's flow of breaking, creaking ice and snow
the sunlight caught it, briefly.

The next day
I walked to your dacha in the woods
as the first light rain of Spring
gently washed the birch saplings
and the brown leaves of last autumn now revealed
made a silent carpet for my feet; 
and the pale sunlight 
caught a raindrop, briefly.

In some future Spring
a poet’s tears fall as gentle rain. 

Dear friend, dear brother, I have owed you this
Since many days, the tribute of a song.
Shall I cheat you who never did a wrong
To any man ? No, therefore though I miss
All art, all skill, in this short armistice
From my soul's war against the bitter throng
Of present woes, let these poor lines be strong

In love enough to bear a brother's kiss.
Dear saint, true knight, I cannot weep for you,
Nor if I could would I call back the breath
All that this year had in its womb He knew,
And, loving you, He sent His Son like Death,
To put His hand over your kind gray eyes. 

I was spending a few days with families in Houston, 
When I heard of the abrupt passing of W. 

Houston, 
Which came naturally as a shock.
Death always demoralizes the fibers of our heart.
Death always brings emotions that rock, 
Break and devastate every part
Of our body and every ounces of our soul.
We can never fully describe the toll
That this mysterious phenomenon
Has on our lives. Death comes like a raging lion, 
Faster than the speed of sound, way beyond
Our scientific and artistic imagination.
Death is a criminal that no one is fond
Of, and that no one likes to talk about, 
However, death has a way of bringing people together, 
It has a way of forcing us to express our bout
With love, which is the greatest desire, 
The greatest feeling of emotions.
Love brings foes and friends together, 
Love brings strangers and nations
Together, Love is universal, 
And Love has no ethnicity and no boundaries.
Love, the greatest feeling of all, 
Is at times painful, and is full of amenities.
Human beings, my Brothers and Sisters, 
Have very short memories; Love should be practiced
Daily, not only when we encounter tragedies and disasters, 
Or when we are victimized by the worst beast, 
That ever existed, which is Death.
Let's honor Whitney by celebrating Love every day, 
Because death has a way of committing the biggest theft, 
And of stealing the very best Angels in the bay.
Our very best people have been snatched away
Toussaint Louverture, Dessalines, Martin Luther King, 
Malcolm X, Don Cornelius and today our favorite star, 
Singer and Sister Whitney Houston, who could sing, 
From morning to dawn, with the angelic orchestra.
It is the end of something good, the end of an era.
Let's us celebrate the greatest LOVE of all, 
Continue to fight the evils, and keep on walking tall.
May all our predeceased Brothers and Sisters
Rest eternally in peace, among the Angels! 



In the tired evening
Of the day’s long spell
The guitar in sweet melody
In lighter strings
When the pain of life
Was singing itself
Behind those weathered fingers
And the seasoned face
Like the ‘Old Guitarist’ of Picasso

Your memories have revisited
The haunting moments
In form I cannot go beyond
The raptures in my heart
Of the days past
For me one day to sit and ponder
But alas those small steps
Of the girl when she was her own

Where have the wit from your heart gone
Had the beloved been with you
The pain might have been lesser

In love I cherish but what is beyond
When the solace has given up hope
Come close my love for tonight
In tiptoe your memories
Enlightening me like the sitting Buddha
No new religion did you espouse
Except the religion of love
O heart! Lament not
For the ways of the lovers
Nothing but tears in memories


As a guest who may not stay
Long and sad farewells to say
Glides with smiling face away,

Of the sweetness and the zest
Of thy happy life possessed
Thou hast left us at thy best.

Warm of heart and clear of brain,
Of thy sun-bright spirit's wane
Thou hast spared us all the pain.

Now that thou hast gone away,
What is left of one to say
Who was open as the day?

What is there to gloss or shun?
Save with kindly voices none
Speak thy name beneath the sun.

Safe thou art on every side,
Friendship nothing finds to hide,
Love's demand is satisfied.

Over manly strength and worth,
At thy desk of toil, or hearth,
Played the lambent light of mirth,--

Mirth that lit, but never burned;
All thy blame to pity turned;
Hatred thou hadst never learned.

Every harsh and vexing thing
At thy home-fire lost its sting;
Where thou wast was always spring.

And thy perfect trust in good,
Faith in man and womanhood,
Chance and change and time, withstood.

Small respect for cant and whine,
Bigot's zeal and hate malign,
Had that sunny soul of thine.

But to thee was duty's claim
Sacred, and thy lips became
Reverent with one holy Name.

Therefore, on thy unknown way,
But a little while delay.

Keep for us, O friend, where'er
Thou art waiting, all that here
Made thy earthly presence dear;

Something of thy pleasant past
On a ground of wonder cast,
In the stiller waters glassed!

Keep the human heart of thee;
Let the mortal only be
Clothed in immortality.

And when fall our feet as fell
Thine upon the asphodel,
Let thy old smile greet us well;

Proving in a world of bliss
What we fondly dream in this,--
Love is one with holiness

In my memory lane
i wandered to and fro
to pluck the flowers
of my idleness, when
I'd be enchanting myself

I emphasis on my preluded moment
which are sanctity of my life
those are compliment and mystery
that survived my life. 

Blessed be Thou for all the joy
        My soul has felt today!
O let its memory stay with me
        And never pass away! 
I was alone, for those I loved
        Were far away from me,
The sun shone on the withered grass,
        The wind blew fresh and free. 

Was it the smile of early spring
        That made my bosom glow?
'Twas sweet, but neither sun nor wind
        Could raise my spirit so. 

Was it some feeling of delight,
        All vague and undefined?
No, 'twas a rapture deep and strong,
        Expanding in the mind! 

Was it a sanguine view of life
        And all its transient bliss­-
A hope of bright prosperity?
        O no, it was not this! 

It was a glimpse of truth divine
        Unto my spirit given
Illumined by a ray of light
        That shone direct from heaven! 

        By whom all things were made.
I saw His wisdom and his power
        In all his works displayed. 

But most throughout the moral world
        I saw his glory shine;
I saw His wisdom infinite,
        His mercy all divine. 

Deep secrets of his providence
        In darkness long concealed
Were brought to my delighted eyes
        And graciously revealed. 

But while I wondered and adored
        His wisdom so divine,
I did not tremble at his power,

I knew that my Redeemer lived,
        I did not fear to die;
Full sure that I should rise again
        To immortality. 

I longed to view that bliss divine
        Which eye hath never seen,
To see the glories of his face
        Without the veil between. 

FIVE-AND-TWENTY years have gone
Since old William pollexfen
Laid his strong bones down in death
By his wife Elizabeth
In the grey stone tomb he made.
And after twenty years they laid
In that tomb by him and her
His son George, the astrologer;
And Masons drove from miles away
To scatter the Acacia spray
Upon a melancholy man
Who had ended where his breath began.
Many a son and daughter lies
Far from the customary skies,
The Mall and Eades's grammar school,
In London or in Liverpool;
But where is laid the sailor John
That so many lands had known,
Quiet lands or unquiet seas
Where the Indians trade or Japanese?
He never found his rest ashore,
Moping for one voyage more.
Where have they laid the sailor John?
And yesterday the youngest son,
A humorous, unambitious man,
Was buried near the astrologer,
Yesterday in the tenth year
Since he who had been contented long.
A nobody in a great throng,
Decided he would journey home,
Now that his fiftieth year had come,
And 'Mr.  Alfred' be again
Upon the lips of common men
Who carried in their memory
His childhood and his family.
At all these death-beds women heard
A visionary white sea-bird
Lamenting that a man should die;
And with that cry I have raised my cry. 

Along the shore the tall thin grass,
That fringes that dark river,
While sinuously soft feet pass
Beings to bleed and quiver.

The great dark voice breaks with a sob
Across the womb of night;
Above your grave, the tom-toms throb
And the hills are weird with light.

The great dark beast is like a well
Drained bitter by the sky,
And all the honeyed lies they tell
Come there to thirst and die.

No lie is strong enough to kill
The roots that work below,
From your rich dust and slaughtered will
A tree with tongues shall grow. 

The words are always as
strange and dead as those
fragments and oddments that
the wave casts up on the shore:
I stand in the sea mist 
gazing down at the white
words and old bits of wood
and wonder what they were for.
I think that they were not
ever intended to do
what, when we seek to speak,
we believe that they may:
they cannot bear us up
the frothy words and like
wings at the lame foot
lift us out of the clay.

For all the reflections
I call up out of the sea
(they seem to speak as the shell
seems to speak for the sea)
are no more truly here
than the wind weaving sand
into shapes of things
we think that we know and see.

When in the evening sky
a single star appears
over my head, and the moon
out of the cloud lifts its face,
when the white gull turns
or the high plover hovers
to tell me with a cry
I trespass in this place:

What I see, then, with
that cloud my witness is
not shapes of the mind or wind
like the slow rainbowings
of the dolphin's skin as it dies
but, as though from the cloud
I saw my bone walk the shore,
the theology of all things.

The white stones and the old 
odd bits of sea blanched wood,
Overstrand and the swinging
lighthouse glimpsed in the mists,
they flash in the prisms and I 
believe for a moment I see 
the dazzling atoms dancing
in every thing that exists.

The children dance on the shore.
The waves dies on the sand.
The spray blows to and fro,
the children dance and die.
What waves are these that dance
with the children on the sand?
I hear them calling, but cannot
hear what it is that they cry.

I neither understand
nor know why I am moved
beyond these words by the 
odd bits of bleached wood
cast up on Overstrand
or by the black and twisted 
October evening tree
dying beside the road.

or by the child of midnight
so deep asleep but still
lost in the corridors 
of the mansions of dust,
by any or by all
ceremonial evidence
attesting that we love
simply because we must.

I walk upon Overstrand shore
and the crab at my foot
inscribes praise in the sand.
The wave bursts with glory
because it rises up like
angels out of the sea,
and the dead starfish burns
on Overstrand promontory.

Why do I hear them cry
out from the far side of life,
those forms and impulses
unborn beyond the sky?
Why should they hope and seek
above all else to be?
Tonight on Overstrand
I know for one moment why. 

Farewell dear babe, my heart's too much content,
Farewell sweet babe, the pleasure of mine eye,
Farewell fair flower that for a space was lent,
Then ta'en away unto eternity.
Blest babe why should I once bewail thy fate,
Or sigh the days so soon were terminate;
Sith* thou art settled in an everlasting state. *Since
By nature trees do rot when they are grown.
And plums and apples thoroughly ripe do fall,
And corn and grass are in their season mown,
And time brings down what is both strong and tall.
But plants new set to be eradicate,
And buds new blown, to have so short a date,
Is by His hand alone that guides nature and fate. 

My quietness has a man in it, he is transparent
and he carries me quietly, like a gondola, through the streets.
He has several likenesses, like stars and years, like numerals.

My quietness has a number of naked selves, 
so many pistols I have borrowed to protect myselves 
from creatures who too readily recognize my weapons 
and have murder in their heart!
				though in winter
they are warm as roses, in the desert
taste of chilled anisette.
At times, withdrawn,
I rise into the cool skies 
and gaze on at the imponderable world with the simple identification 
of my colleagues, the mountains. Manfred climbs to my nape, 
speaks, but I do not hear him,
I'm too blue.
An elephant takes up his trumpet, 
money flutters from the windows of cries, silk stretching its mirror 
across shoulder blades. A gun is "fired

"
 One of me rushes
to window #and one of me raises his whip and one of me 
flutters up from the center of the track amidst the pink flamingoes, 
and underneath their hooves as they round the last turn my lips 
are scarred and brown, brushed by tails, masked in dirt's lust, 
definition, open mouths gasping for the cries of the bettors for the lungs 
of earth.
 So many of my transparencies could not resist the race! 
Terror in earth, dried mushrooms, pink feathers, tickets, 
a flaking moon drifting across the muddied teeth, 
the imperceptible moan of covered breathing,
 love of the serpent!
I am underneath its leaves as the hunter crackles and pants 
and bursts, as the barrage balloon drifts behind a cloud 
and animal death whips out its flashlight,
whistling
and slipping the glove off the trigger hand. The serpent's eyes 
redden at sight of those thorny fingernails, he is so smooth!
 My transparent selves
flail about like vipers in a pail, writhing and hissing 
without panic, with a certain justice of response 
and presently the aquiline serpent comes to resemble the Medusa. 

I do not think of you lying in the wet clay
Of a Monaghan graveyard; I see
You walking down a lane among the poplars
On your way to the station, or happily

Going to second Mass on a summer Sunday -
You meet me and you say:
'Don't forget to see about the cattle - '
Among your earthiest words the angels stray.

And I think of you walking along a headland
Of green oats in June,
So full of repose, so rich with life -
And I see us meeting at the end of a town

On a fair day by accident, after
The bargains are all made and we can walk
Together through the shops and stalls and markets
Free in the oriental streets of thought.

O you are not lying in the wet clay,
For it is a harvest evening now and we
Are piling up the ricks against the moonlight
And you smile up at us - eternally. 

When there are so many we shall have to mourn,
when grief has been made so public, and exposed
to the critique of a whole epoch
the frailty of our conscience and anguish,

of whom shall we speak? For every day they die
among us, those who were doing us some good,
who knew it was never enough but
hoped to improve a little by living.

Such was this doctor: still at eighty he wished
to think of our life from whose unruliness
so many plausible young futures
with threats or flattery ask obedience,

but his wish was denied him: he closed his eyes
upon that last picture, common to us all,
of problems like relatives gathered
puzzled and jealous about our dying.

For about him till the very end were still
those he had studied, the fauna of the night,
and shades that still waited to enter
the bright circle of his recognition

turned elsewhere with their disappointment as he
was taken away from his life interest
to go back to the earth in London,
an important Jew who died in exile.

Only Hate was happy, hoping to augment
his practice now, and his dingy clientele
who think they can be cured by killing
and covering the garden with ashes.

They are still alive, but in a world he changed
simply by looking back with no false regrets;
all he did was to remember
like the old and be honest like children.

He wasn't clever at all: he merely told
the unhappy Present to recite the Past
like a poetry lesson till sooner
or later it faltered at the line where

long ago the accusations had begun,
and suddenly knew by whom it had been judged,
how rich life had been and how silly,
and was life-forgiven and more humble,

able to approach the Future as a friend
without a wardrobe of excuses, without
a set mask of rectitude or an
embarrassing over-familiar gesture.

No wonder the ancient cultures of conceit
in his technique of unsettlement foresaw
the fall of princes, the collapse of
their lucrative patterns of frustration:

if he succeeded, why, the Generalised Life
would become impossible, the monolith
of State be broken and prevented
the co-operation of avengers.

down among the lost people like Dante, down
to the stinking fosse where the injured
lead the ugly life of the rejected,

and showed us what evil is, not, as we thought,
deeds that must be punished, but our lack of faith,
our dishonest mood of denial,
the concupiscence of the oppressor.

If some traces of the autocratic pose,
the paternal strictness he distrusted, still
clung to his utterance and features,
it was a protective coloration

for one who'd lived among enemies so long:
if often he was wrong and, at times, absurd,
to us he is no more a person
now but a whole climate of opinion

under whom we conduct our different lives:
Like weather he can only hinder or help,
the proud can still be proud but find it
a little harder, the tyrant tries to

make do with him but doesn't care for him much:
he quietly surrounds all our habits of growth
and extends, till the tired in even
the remotest miserable duchy

have felt the change in their bones and are cheered
till the child, unlucky in his little State,
some hearth where freedom is excluded,
a hive whose honey is fear and worry,

feels calmer now and somehow assured of escape,
while, as they lie in the grass of our neglect,
so many long-forgotten objects
revealed by his undiscouraged shining

are returned to us and made precious again;
games we had thought we must drop as we grew up,
little noises we dared not laugh at,
faces we made when no one was looking.

But he wishes us more than this. To be free
is often to be lonely. He would unite
the unequal moieties fractured
by our own well-meaning sense of justice,

would restore to the larger the wit and will
the smaller possesses but can only use
for arid disputes, would give back to
the son the mother's richness of feeling:

but he would have us remember most of all
to be enthusiastic over the night,
not only for the sense of wonder
it alone has to offer, but also

because it needs our love. With large sad eyes
its delectable creatures look up and beg
us dumbly to ask them to follow:
they are exiles who long for the future

that lives in our power, they too would rejoice
if allowed to serve enlightenment like him,
even to bear our cry of 'Judas',
as he did and all must bear who serve it.

One rational voice is dumb. Over his grave
the household of Impulse mourns one dearly loved:
sad is Eros, builder of cities,
the same Mao 
smiles


But the essential advantage for a poet is not, to have a beautiful world with which to deal: it is to be able to see beneath both beauty and ugliness; to see the boredom, and the horror, and the glory. 


It was his story. It would always be his story. 
It followed him; it overtook him finally— 
The boredom, and the horror, and the glory. 


Probably at the end he was not yet sorry, 
Even as the boots were brutalizing him in the alley. 
It was his story. It would always be his story, 


Blown on a blue horn, full of sound and fury, 
But signifying, O signifying magnificently 
The boredom, and the horror, and the glory. 


I picture the snow as falling without hurry 
To cover the cobbles and the toppled ashcans completely. 
It was his story. It would always be his story. 


Lately he had wandered between St. Mark’s Place and the Bowery, 
Already half a spirit, mumbling and muttering sadly. 
O the boredom, and the horror, and the glory. 


All done now. But I remember the fiery 
Hypnotic eye and the raised voice blazing with poetry. 
It was his story and would always be his story— 
The boredom, and the horror, and the glory.

He disappeared in the dead of winter:
The brooks were frozen, the airports almost deserted,
The snow disfigured the public statues;
The mercury sank in the mouth of the dying day.
What instruments we have agree
The day of his death was a dark cold day.

Far from his illness
The wolves ran on through the evergreen forests,
The peasant river was untempted by the fashionable quays;
By mourning tongues
The death of the poet was kept from his poems.

But for him it was his last afternoon as himself,
An afternoon of nurses and rumours;
The provinces of his body revolted,
The squares of his mind were empty,
Silence invaded the suburbs,
The current of his feeling failed; he became his admirers.

Now he is scattered among a hundred cities
And wholly given over to unfamiliar affections,
To find his happiness in another kind of wood
And be punished under a foreign code of conscience.
The words of a dead man
Are modified in the guts of the living.

But in the importance and noise of to-morrow
When the brokers are roaring like beasts on the floor of the Bourse,
And the poor have the sufferings to which they are fairly accustomed,
And each in the cell of himself is almost convinced of his freedom,
A few thousand will think of this day
As one thinks of a day when one did something slightly unusual.
What instruments we have agree
The day of his death was a dark cold day.

You were silly like us; your gift survived it all:
The parish of rich women, physical decay,
Yourself. Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry.
Now Ireland has her madness and her weather still,
For poetry makes nothing happen: it survives
In the valley of its making where executives
Would never want to tamper, flows on south
From ranches of isolation and the busy griefs,
Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,
A way of happening, a mouth.

Earth, receive an honoured guest:
William Yeats is laid to rest.
Let the Irish vessel lie
Emptied of its poetry.

[Auden later deleted the next three stanzas.]

Time that is intolerant
Of the brave and the innocent,
And indifferent in a week
To a beautiful physique,

Worships language and forgives
Everyone by whom it lives;
Pardons cowardice, conceit,
Lays its honours at their feet.

Time that with this strange excuse
Pardoned Kipling and his views,
And will pardon Paul Claudel,
Pardons him for writing well.

In the nightmare of the dark
All the dogs of Europe bark,
And the living nations wait,
Each sequestered in its hate;

Intellectual disgrace
Stares from every human face,
And the seas of pity lie
Locked and frozen in each eye.

Follow, poet, follow right
To the bottom of the night,
With your unconstraining voice
Still persuade us to rejoice.

With the farming of a verse
Make a vineyard of the curse,
Sing of human unsuccess
In a rapture of distress.

In the deserts of the heart
Let the healing fountains start,
In the prison of his days
Teach the free man how to praise. 

A year has passed 
You left us on this day
The emptiness that got created
No one could ever say

You were no doubt a doting daughter
A loving sister and a dear friend
No one can replace you 
Nor our feelings can mend

Remembering you fondly today
And the moments we spent together
You are deeply missed
With every passing day

Sculpted in metal 
With tongues frozen
A white tiger
With plaited hairs
A black in background
To accentuate
The grandeur
A skull of a man
With headphones
Smiling
On his death
In ashes
Or in rivers
In the ground
So many souls
Angels where stored
The sculpted metal
Wanted to grow roots
A little girl
I see in her
In infertility
She spent her life
Another one
Having wit of sparrow
With same disease
In silence her life
Raising other children
The skull smiling
Their desires
The white tiger
The chauvinist 
The black in opportunity
The feet of those women
Like claws
Who the hell
Shall answer these questions


IN midnight sleep, of many a face of anguish,
   Of the look at first of the mortally wounded--of that indescribable
         look;
   Of the dead on their backs, with arms extended wide,
       I dream, I dream, I dream.


   Of scenes of nature, fields and mountains;
   Of skies, so beauteous after a storm--and at night the moon so
         unearthly bright,
   Shining sweetly, shining down, where we dig the trenches and gather
         the heaps,
       I dream, I dream, I dream.


   Long, long have they pass'd--faces and trenches and fields;
   Where through the carnage I moved with a callous composure--or away
         from the fallen,
   Onward I sped at the time--But now of their forms at night,
       I dream, I dream, I dream.                                     here's in my mind a woman
of innocence, unadorned but

fair-featured and smelling of
apples or grass. She wears

a utopian smock or shift, her hair
is light brown and smooth, and she

is kind and very clean without
ostentation-

but she has
no imagination

And there's a
turbulent moon-ridden girl

or old woman, or both,
dressed in opals and rags, feathers

and torn taffeta,
who knows strange songs

but she is not kind. 

In  my early childhood days something  is pleasant, something is not.
It  is very pleasant to hug  a pussy  with its bushy  tail
It  is also very pleasant  to sleep  on the oven  bench in the winter.
I t is    pleasant,   wake  up  in the morning   and see that pussy  has brought four kittens  on the haystack. 
It  is also very  pleasant, when the  water   floods the houses and sheds and the streets
In the rainy season and everyone wades through the water.
And  it is also funny to catch  young carp  and pike with  bare hand.
It  is pleasant to find a bird’s nest in the grass.
But  it is not pleasant at all  when  bees sting you
Or when mom  forces  to go to the study in the evening
And think how scary it is look at a house flames.
But it is  funny,  a little fire is pleasant.
It  is pleasant when a green mango was sour
And  magically turns out to be sweet.
It  is pleasant when father takes me
To   the  market   from my reading room! 
Or when my granny talks to the cows, 
As  if they were   people and it is very funny no doubt.
When  a stranger passing on the road at night and says "good evening"
Grandfather  answers gently in the darkness "god be with you"
Is  not  it pleasant

In my craft or sullen art
Exercised in the still night
When only the moon rages
And the lovers lie abed
With all their griefs in their arms
I labour by singing light
Not for ambition or bread
Or the strut and trade of charms
On the ivory stages
But for the common wages
Of their most secret heart. 

Not for the proud man apart
From the raging moon I write
On these spindrift pages
Nor for the towering dead
With their nightingales and psalms
But for the lovers, their arms
Round the griefs of the ages,
Who pay no praise or wages
Nor heed my craft or art


In my daughter’s eyes, 
I am a hero, strong and wise, 
and I know no fear.

But the truth is that
I see who I want to be
in my daughter’s eyes.

My child shall remember me
for the feeling that I cherished her.
The material possessions
are trivial when you love.

A mother’s love for her child 
is like nothing else in the world. 
It’s fierce, forever protective.
It will not allow anything
to stand in its path. 

The moonlight crept through
my window last night
and danced across the mirror, 
making star bursts on the floor
as it played a game
of hide and seek with the clouds above

Softly sighs the evening breeze
to stir the curtains
Its shadows circle and sway
Mixed with the star burst
it creates the illusion
of a grand ballroom

Wish you were in my arms
Softly caressing, beholding me
Misty eyed, breathing
The evening breeze, the moonlight
An illusion, never again a game
To remember in my dream


In my dreams I am always saying goodbye and riding away, 
Whither and why I know not nor do I care. 
And the parting is sweet and the parting over is sweeter, 
And sweetest of all is the night and the rushing air. 


In my dreams they are always waving their hands and saying goodbye, 
And they give me the stirrup cup and I smile as I drink, 
I am glad the journey is set, I am glad I am going, 
I am glad, I am glad, that my friends don't know what I think. 

In my dreams, 
I am powerful beyond measure, 
I can speak any language, 
I can ride on the wind, 
I can walk on my hands, 
And I can skate on water, 
I can do all this, 
Effortlessley, 
And it costs me nothing, 
Except the thought, 
When I awaken, 
That I am human after all. 

The lamp of the bright life had darkened.
It was the darkest moment ever
experienced by my mother and family.

We are family of ten. I am the eldest.
That time I was twenty years of age.
A new graduate and has no job yet.
My mother's teary, query eyes was on me.

I saw in her eyes what she meant
sickly diabetic mother, ten children
with five years old as the youngest.
Thats a lot to feed in one day and on.

I was dumbstruck. Like in a black cloak
on my face with small hole to peep.
I have to visualize the future. Survival
I have to toil and family to take care of.

In storm of life we are in. We should get out.
I step up, step in to my father's shoes.
And walk to search the sunshine of hope.
Then I took the road across the ocean.

From east, to west end road sunshine I found.
At that side of the world I got the decent job.
Earnings, enough to pay my mother's
health bills and family expenses.

Finally time came, self sacrifices paid off.
My brothers and sisters  finished college.
Load to my shoulders time to unload
That's I think of, but I can't.

Poverty in my native land, social cancer of sort.
Still I have to run, carry the load to bear.
To take the shoes off? Nay. Still to wear, support.
I have conscience, a heart, I care. 

In my heart I have a picture of you, 
the picture is old but you are as new.
For years I have carried it around with me, 
Jealously hiding it so that no one should see.
The picture changes depending on my mood, 
if I am hungry for love, you are my food.
When I am feeling sad you are my prop, 
helping me back on the way to the top.
Happy and cheerful I face each day, 
your smiling face guides me on my way.
Yours is a picture that never dims with age, 
with you free in my heart not in a cage.
You are with me both day and night, 
filling my years with strange delight.
I have seen many pictures in my long life, 
but none so beautiful as you my dear wife.
Yes in my heart I have a picture of you, 
the picture is old but you are as new. 

in my joy and in my distress.

With the lighted oil lamp
I place my feet
on to  your sanctuary
to love you and adore you.

Come to me in my joys and distress.
I cannot live without you.
All the experiences here on earth
will not last I know.

Even my sexual joys is doomed
not to last and I need you
my permanent lover.

Your pure love for me 
shall never fade. 

IN MY MIND’S EYE

I take a breath
I take a step
And look as far as I can see
Then close my weary jaded eyes
To dream (of you and me)  

I take a breath
Another step
Upon this crumbling patch of earth
But in my mind 
I have heaven-bound wings

Emptied my mind for expression
Music is broken in the formulae
Galen or another sage
From the cage the heart was bursting
Into desires so much in your laps
Like roses of black and white color
What holds you in the sweetness
Your tongue now speak angels
Devil’s eye had on the brow 
Unquenched thirst for the fountain
Whom shall you lead my love
From the bosom to the eternity 
Through the desert of smoothness
Like having seen no spring for ages
Like storm then I take your dunes
Every particle in your existence 
Shall have the energy of my lust
I shall not admit it as my fault
As you shall not admit your beauty
What causes me in flames inside
I see you naked in my phantasm
In my sky at twilight you are like a cloud
and your form and colour are the way I love them.
You are mine, mine, woman with sweet lips
and in your life my infinite dreams live.

The lamp of my soul dyes your feet,
the sour wine is sweeter on your lips,
oh reaper of my evening song,
how solitary dreams believe you to be mine!

You are mine, mine, I go shouting it to the afternoon's
wind, and the wind hauls on my widowed voice.
Huntress of the depth of my eyes, your plunder
stills your nocturnal regard as though it were water.

You are taken in the net of my music, my love,
and my nets of music are wide as the sky.
My soul is born on the shore of your eyes of mourning.
In your eyes of mourning the land of dreams begin. 

And see'st my dropping tears. 
My troubles all are Thee before, 
My longings and my fears.

Thy help my soul hath found. 
Though loss and sickness me assailed, 
Through Thee I've kept my ground.

And Thy abode Thou'st made with me; 
With Thee my soul can talk; 
In secret places Thee I find 
Where I do kneel or walk.

Though husband dear be from me gone, 
Whom I do love so well, 
I have a more beloved one 
Whose comforts far excel.

Uphold my fainting soul. 
And when I know not what to do, 
I'll on Thy mercies roll.

My weakness. Thou dost know full well 
Of body and of mind; 
I in this world no comfort have, 
But what from Thee I find.

Though children Thou has given me, 
And friends I have also, 
Yet if I see Thee not through them 
They are no joy, but woe.

Ev'n for my Saviour's sake; 
In Thee alone is more than all, 
And there content I'll take.

As Thou before hast done, 
Bring back my husband, I beseech, 
As Thou didst once my son.

So shall I celebrate Thy praise 
Ev'n while my days shall last 
And talk to my beloved one 
Of all Thy goodness past.

With praises shall recount 
And serve Thee better than before 
Whose blessings thus surmount.

Then better shall I be, 
To pay the vows which I do owe 
Forever unto Thee.

Unless Thou help, what can I do 
But still my frailty show? 
I shall Return Thee what I owe. 

In 
my soul
there is a temple, a shrine, a mosque, a church
where I kneel.

Prayer should bring us to an altar where no walls or names exist.

Is there not a region of love where the sovereignty is 
illumined nothing,

where ecstasy gets poured into itself
and becomes
lost,

where the wing is fully alive
but has no mind or 
body?

In
my soul
there is a temple, a shrine, a mosque,
a church

that dissolve, that 
dissolve in


Out over my study, 
  All ashen and ruddy, 
Sinks the December sun; 
  And high up over 
  The chimney’s soot cove, 
The winter night wind has begun. 

  Here in the red embers 
  I dream old Decembers, 
Until the low moan of the blast, 
  Like a voice out of Ghost-land, 

 
   Or memory’s lost-land, 
Seems to conjure up wraiths of the past. 

  Then into the room 
  Through the firelight and gloom, 
Some one steals,—let the night-wind grow bleak, 

 
  And ever so coldly,— 
  Two white arms enfold me, 
And a sweet face is close to my cheek


I stumbled much
False exhilarations of living
From the thick bush of trees
And a very dark silent night
Behind the open door
When my back was towards it
Some fears will visit me tonight
I had immensely felt before
The memory
I wanted to patch in
You
In my vast emptiness

Islamabad

O world invisible, we view thee, 
O world intangible, we touch thee, 
O world unknowable, we know thee, 
Inapprehensible, we clutch thee! 

Does the fish soar to find the ocean, 
The eagle plunge to find the air-  
That we ask of the stars in motion 
If they have rumor of thee there? 

Not where the wheeling systems darken, 
And our benumbed conceiving soars! -  
The drift of pinions, would we hearken, 
Beats at our own clay-shuttered doors. 

The angels keep their ancient places-  
Turn but a stone and start a wing! 
'Tis ye, 'tis your estranged faces, 
That miss the many-splendored thing. 

But (when so sad thou canst not sadder)  
Cry- and upon thy so sore loss 
Shall shine the traffic of Jacob's ladder 
Pitched betwixt Heaven and Charing Cross. 

Yea, in the night, my Soul, my daughter, 
Cry- clinging to Heaven by the hems; 
Not of Genesareth, but Thames

The leafless forests slowly yield 
    To the thick-driving snow. A little while
    And night shall darken down. In shouting file
  The woodmen's carts go by me homeward-wheeled,
  Past the thin fading stubbles, half concealed,
    Now golden-gray, sowed softly through with snow,
    Where the last ploughman follows still his row,
  Turning black furrows through the whitening field.
  Far off the village lamps begin to gleam,
    Fast drives the snow, and no man comes this way;
      The hills grow wintry white, and bleak winds moan
      About the naked uplands. I alone
    Am neither sad, nor shelterless, nor gray,
  Wrapped round with thought, content to watch and dream. 

I am afraid I am in too deep
You have taken off my head
And now you ask me for my heart
Are we connected 
By more than my imagination 
As I sit contemplating
I am searching for a direction 
Who what when where
How do I get out of here 
In one peace


Your heart is cherished as a treasure in my chest where my heart is.
In my chest there, the hearts, yours and mine will intertwine to pass on bliss.
Explosion of sensation in my chest plays with music from this
Recipe of passion to insinuate our hearts into a kiss.
I feel sweet pleasure inside arousing to a point not to miss.
Our hearts to superior heights, arousing incredible did prick.
Assortment of wonders experienced by our hearts that flick
By way of rhythmical thumping, so as to progress on to click
My chest enthusiastic on stipulation harmonious and quick
To embrace enlivening rapture; our hearts, yours and mine did pick. 

you  have not been
out of me
not even for a second
let the world declare
whatever
we will meet each other
for ever
in our minds


He. .., a gentleman generous and broad-minded
Who we can't stand without saying 'Yes'.
Sometimes, he may be sensitive.
But for us, he's like a sky positive.
Ow! dears, how splendid our Sayagyi(teacher)     is! 

She. .., a lady luminous and patient
Who we bow with paying respect.
Sometimes, she may be lazy.
But for us, she's like a sea steady.
Ow! dears, what our lovely Sayamagyi(teacher) ! 

There. .., a place fantastic and miraculous
Where our hearts and brains are ably absorbed.
Sometimes, it may have problems.
But for us, it's like a paradise of freedom.
Ow! dears, what our breathtaking symposium! 

We. .., guys kind-hearted and dutiful
Who also have legacy of confidence wonderful.
Sometimes, we may build up over friendship together.
But generally, we're just like brothers and sisters.
Ow! dears, be proud of being symposiast forever

You came in, unwanted and new. 
You came in, surprised you too. 
You came in, too late for us. 
You came in, thought it was lust. 

I wanted you out, too late. 
I wanted you out, but wait. 
I wanted you out, then in. 
I wanted you out, all over again. 

I used to drive with the radio up. 
I used to fill that f**kin cup. 
I used to run to sweat it out. 
I used this pen, instead of my mouth. 

Thought a year, was enough. 
Thought a year, was too much. 
Thought a year, would be good. 
Thought a year. .. 

maybe I should? 

But I'll just keep on doin'- what we do. 
I'll just keep leavin- it up to you. 
I'll just keep runnin my stupid mouth. 
I'll just keep drivin- You Out. 

Homes reach the stars, the sky's below,
The land in smoke to it is near.
Inside the big and happy Paris
Remains the secretive despair.

The evening boulevards are noisy,
Gone are the sundown's final rays,
And there are couples everywhere
Trembling of lips, daring of eyes.

I'm here alone. To trunk of chestnut
It is so nice one's head to lean!
And like in the abandoned Moscow
In heart weep verses of Rostand.

Paris at night is sad and alien,
Dear to the heart is madness gone!
I'm going home, there's vial of sorrow
And tender portrait of someone.

There's someone's glance, sad and fraternal.
There's tender profile on the wall.
Rostand and the Reichstadtian martyr
And Sara - in sleep come they all!

Within the big and happy Paris
I dream of grass, of clouds and rain
And laughter far, and shadow near,
And deep just like before is pain. 

Don't talk to me of love. I've had an earful
And I get tearful when I've downed a drink or two.
I'm one of your talking wounded.
I'm a hostage. I'm maroonded.
But I'm in Paris with you.

Yes I'm angry at the way I've been bamboozled
And resentful at the mess I've been through.
I admit I'm on the rebound
And I don't care where are we bound.
I'm in Paris with you.

	Do you mind if we do not go to the Louvre
	If we say sod off to sodding Notre Dame, 
	If we skip the Champs Elysees
	And remain here in this sleazy

	Old hotel room
	Doing this and that
	To what and whom
	Learning who you are, 
	Learning what I am.

Don't talk to me of love. Let's talk of Paris, 
The little bit of Paris in our view.
There's that crack across the ceiling
And the hotel walls are peeling
And I'm in Paris with you.

Don't talk to me of love. Let's talk of Paris.
I'm in Paris with the slightest thing you do.
I'm in Paris with your eyes, your mouth, 
I'm in Paris with.  all points south.
Am I embarrassing you? 
I'm in Paris with you. 

In Paulo Coelho
Who is utmost allegorical, 
Virtuous and righteous
I find it
Classicism converted to romanticism, 
Classico-romanticism, 
A writer attracted to classicism
But retreating too
After being disgusted with, 
A writer George Herbertian, 
Jonathan Swiftian, 
A gipsy like D. 

H. 

Lawrence, 
A vagabond like Walt Whitman
Always on a pilgrimage, a pilgrimage
Like C. 

G. 

Rossetti, John Bunyan
Learning from life, 
A Catholic but wholly a Catholic
But a Protestant, 
A Protestant that too not
But a neo-classicist
And that too not
But a neo-romanticist. 

A track of moonlight on a quiet lake,
Whose small waves on a silver-sanded shore
Whisper of peace, and with the low winds make
Such harmonies as keep the woods awake,
And listening all night long for their sweet sake
A green-waved slope of meadow, hovered o'er
By angel-troops of lilies, swaying light
On viewless stems, with folded wings of white;
A slumberous stretch of mountain-land, far seen
Where the low westering day, with gold and green,
Purple and amber, softly blended, fills
The wooded vales, and melts among the hills;
A vine-fringed river, winding to its rest
On the calm bosom of a stormless sea,
Bearing alike upon its placid breast,
With earthly flowers and heavenly' stars impressed,
The hues of time and of eternity
Such are the pictures which the thought of thee,
O friend, awakeneth,--charming the keen pain
Of thy departure, and our sense of loss
Requiting with the fullness of thy gain.
Lo! on the quiet grave thy life-borne cross,
Dropped only at its side, methinks doth shine,
Of thy beatitude the radiant sign!
No sob of grief, no wild lament be there,
To break the Sabbath of the holy air;
But, in their stead, the silent-breathing prayer
Of hearts still waiting for a rest like thine.
O spirit redeemed! Forgive us, if henceforth,
With sweet and pure similitudes of earth,
We keep thy pleasant memory freshly green,
Of love's inheritance a priceless part,
Which Fancy's self, in reverent awe, is seen
To paint, forgetful of the tricks of art,
With pencil dipped alone in colors of the heart. 

In peril is the Spring.

In  between the arrows omenslayers shot

smiting and tearing persistently  the air

swallows have not still  dared  fly, 

so that you doubt whether Spring is to come.

As far as the wildflowers announcing it already present, 

forget them, they assure, under the craze of climate anomaly.

In real peril, as you see, Cassandras Spring predict.

It is going to loose its turn

in the circle of seasonal rotation.

But, do not worry for the contretemps, 

about summer nothing yet said. 

Lamp-lit faces, to you
What is your starry dew ?
Gold flowers of the night blue !

Deep in wet pavement's slime
Mud-rooted is your fierce prime,
To bloom in lust's coloured clime.

The sheen of eyes that lust,
Which dew-time made your trust,
Lights your passionless dust. 

From whispers to heavy noise
My art of love as it melted
In fine connections invisible
From below the arch of brow
In pink I read your eyes
My pride bent in salutation
Your whole being is surrounded
By the music inside my head
My languor and your rhythm
The melody living in my steps
From the sorrows of silence
Sing the song of spring
To the colors of garden again
My empty cup waiting your glance

Come like zephyr from the east
In the street of rapture my garment
Be the banner of the lovers who
Stained in blood for the stones
Let not doubt like the old lady
When Farhad gave his life in blood
When in the dropp of my wine 
I see the earth descended in goblet
Red with wine is the horizon
From the depth of heart sing love
I carry the tradition of Majnun
Let’s hold hands
Stand shoulder to shoulder
Next to each other
Like brothers and sisters
Like brave and valiant soldiers
In poetry my friends
We do not use foul
Language
We use our heart and soul
Throughout our passage
We tell the truth
We describe the roof
Its contents, its color
Its shape and its odor
We expose the deficiencies
We explore the possibilities
We win because we’re not afraid to fail
We respect our brothers and sisters
As we work, as we pray, as we sail
We love Mother Earth, her flowers
Her beauty, the four seasons
And everyone with good reasons.

We despise the terrorists
The dictators and the racists
We’re never afraid
To fight hate and hatred
We do not use foul
Verbiage
We explicitly use soul
Language
Nobody can fool us
As we fight for justice
Reconciliation and peace
Let’s hold hands
Poetry is our weapons
Words are our bullets
We do not need guns
We use simile, verbs, epithets
We sing beautiful songs
We use different tongues
To warn our enemies
We are no dummies
Let’s hold hands
As siblings, as great friends
So we can get to the top together
So we can be stronger than a pillar
And taller than any tower
We have the power
Good will always defeat evils
Let’s vanquish all devils
He is protecting us as we ride
As we walk, as we march, as we fly
As we’re breathing happily under the sky.


Quivering fears, heart-tearing cares, 
Anxious sighs, untimely tears, 
Fly, fly to courts,
Fly to fond worldling's sports,
Where strained sardonic smiles are glossing still,
And grief is forced to laugh against her will, 
Where mirth's but mummery, 
And sorrows only real be. 

Fly from our country pastimes, fly,
Sad troops of human misery,
Come, serene looks,
Clear as the crystal brooks,
Or the pure azured heaven that smiles to see 
The rich attendance on our poverty;
Peace and a secure mind,
Which ail men seek, we only find. 

Abused mortals! did you know
Where joy, heart's ease, and comforts grow? 
You'd scorn proud towers,
And seek them in these bowers,
Where winds, sometimes, our woods perhaps may shake,
But blustering care could never tempest make; 
Nor murmurs e'er come nigh us, 
Saving of fountains that glide by us. 

Here's no fantastic mask nor dance,
But of our kids that frisk and prance; 
Nor wars are seen, 
Unless upon the green, 
Two harmless lambs are butting one the other,
Which done, both bleating run, each to his mother; 
And wounds are never found,
Save what the ploughshare gives the ground. 

Here are no entrapping baits
To hasten to too hasty fates;
Unless it be
The fond credulity
Of silly fish, which (worldling like) still look
Upon the bait, but never on the hook;
Nor envy, 'less among
The birds, for prize of their sweet song. 

Go, let the diving negro seek
For gems, hid in some forlorn creek;
We all pearls scorn,
Save what the dewy morn
Congeals upon each little spire of grass,
Which careless shepherds beat down as they pass; 
And gold ne'er here appears, 
Save what the yellow Ceres bears. 

Blest silent groves, O, may you be
Forever mirth's best nursery! 
May pure contents 
Forever pitch their tents 
Upon these downs, these rocks, these mountains,
And peace still slumber by these purling fountains, 
Which we may every year
Meet, when we come a-fishing here. 

I sight Her through my self
I sing Her with my heart
I know Her with my mind
I repeatedly chant Her in my thoughts
Into Kanakadurga, the very embodiment of bliss, 
Do I merge, submerging my false sense of self and identity.

I meditate upon the goddess hoping to augment her favour
I pray to Mahadevi, Tripura Sundari, Sarada
Sivakameswari, whose gaze makes all calm –
She offers unassailable, undivided loyalty.

I bow to Bhavani, Sri Devi, 
Her body a streak of lightning, her face ablaze with a cavernous smile.
She resides on Indra Kiladri, on the banks of the Krishna river.
Eternally pure, our lady of Vijayawatika.





A KOKILA called from a henna-spray: 
Lira! liree! Lira! liree! 
Hasten, maidens, hasten away 
To gather the leaves of the henna-tree. 
Send your pitchers afloat on the tide, 
Gather the leaves ere the dawn be old, 
Grind them in mortars of amber and gold, 
The fresh green leaves of the henna-tree.


A kokila called from a henna-spray: 
Lira! liree! Lira! liree! 
Hasten maidens, hasten away 
To gather the leaves of the henna-tree. 
The tilka's red for the brow of a bride, 
And betel-nut's red for lips that are sweet; 
But, for lily-like fingers and feet, 
The red, the red of the henna-tree. 

If it form the one landscape that we, the inconstant ones,
Are consistently homesick for, this is chiefly
Because it dissolves in water. Mark these rounded slopes
With their surface fragrance of thyme and, beneath,
A secret system of caves and conduits; hear the springs
That spurt out everywhere with a chuckle,
Each filling a private pool for its fish and carving
Its own little ravine whose cliffs entertain
The butterfly and the lizard; examine this region
Of short distances and definite places:
What could be more like Mother or a fitter background
For her son, the flirtatious male who lounges
Against a rock in the sunlight, never doubting
That for all his faults he is loved; whose works are but
Extensions of his power to charm? From weathered outcrop
To hill-top temple, from appearing waters to
Conspicuous fountains, from a wild to a formal vineyard,
Are ingenious but short steps that a child's wish
To receive more attention than his brothers, whether
By pleasing or teasing, can easily take.

Watch, then, the band of rivals as they climb up and down
Their steep stone gennels in twos and threes, at times
On the shady side of a square at midday in
Voluble discourse, knowing each other too well to think
There are any important secrets, unable
To conceive a god whose temper-tantrums are moral
And not to be pacified by a clever line
Or a good lay: for accustomed to a stone that responds,
They have never had to veil their faces in awe
Of a crater whose blazing fury could not be fixed;
Adjusted to the local needs of valleys
Where everything can be touched or reached by walking,
Their eyes have never looked into infinite space
Through the lattice-work of a nomad's comb; born lucky,
Their legs have never encountered the fungi
And insects of the jungle, the monstrous forms and lives
With which we have nothing, we like to hope, in common.
So, when one of them goes to the bad, the way his mind works
Remains incomprehensible: to become a pimp
Or deal in fake jewellery or ruin a fine tenor voice
For effects that bring down the house, could happen to all
But the best and the worst of us. 
That is why, I suppose,
The best and worst never stayed here long but sought
Immoderate soils where the beauty was not so external,
The light less public and the meaning of life
Something more than a mad camp. `Come!' cried the granite wastes,
`How evasive is your humour, how accidental
Your kindest kiss, how permanent is death.' (Saints-to-be
Slipped away sighing.) `Come!' purred the clays and gravels,
`On our plains there is room for armies to drill; rivers
Wait to be tamed and slaves to construct you a tomb
In the grand manner: soft as the earth is mankind and both
Need to be altered.' (Intendant Caesars rose and
Left, slamming the door.) But the really reckless were fetched
By an older colder voice, the oceanic whisper:
`I am the solitude that asks and promises nothing;
That is how I shall set you free. There is no love;
There are only the various envies, all of them sad.'

They were right, my dear, all those voices were right
And still are; this land is not the sweet home that it looks,
Nor its peace the historical calm of a site
Where something was settled once and for all: A back ward
And dilapidated province, connected
To the big busy world by a tunnel, with a certain
Seedy appeal, is that all it is now? Not quite:
It has a worldy duty which in spite of itself
It does not neglect, but calls into question
All the Great Powers assume; it disturbs our rights. The poet,
Admired for his earnest habit of calling
The sun the sun, his mind Puzzle, is made uneasy
By these marble statues which so obviously doubt
His antimythological myth; and these gamins,
Pursuing the scientist down the tiled colonnade
Remotest aspects: I, too, am reproached, for what
And how much you know. Not to lose time, not to get caught,
Not to be left behind, not, please! to resemble
The beasts who repeat themselves, or a thing like water
Or stone whose conduct can be predicted, these
Are our common prayer, whose greatest comfort is music
Which can be made anywhere, is invisible,
And does not smell. In so far as we have to look forward
To death as a fact, no doubt we are right: But if
Sins can be forgiven, if bodies rise from the dead,
These modifications of matter into
Innocent athletes and gesticulating fountains,
Made solely for pleasure, make a further point:
The blessed will not care what angle they are regarded from,
Having nothing to hide. Dear, I know nothing of
Either, but when I try to imagine a faultless love
Or the life to come, what I hear is the murmur
Of underground streams, what I see is a limestone landscape. 

Give me not
Your nubile girls
Experts on the course of life, 
Whose baby cheeks
Unshadowed eyes
Bespeak the fact
They've never cried.

Give to me
A love of sorrow
Whose flesh has known
Fear of tomorrow; 
Whose hands have shaken
With life's knowledge
Never gained
By years of college.

Give to me
A love whose sated
Scores of lovers
Proved ill-fated, 
Grateful for the touch
That brings
The revival of
Youth's fateful Spring.

Give me not
Your heart unbroken, 
The n'er betrayed
By words unspoken, 
Who never watched
Love walk away, 
The unforsworn
On rainy days. 

Wearily, drearily,
Half the day long,
Flap the great banners
High over the stone;
Strangely and eerily
Sounds the wind's song,
Bending the banner-poles.

While, all alone,
Watching the loophole's spark,
Lie I, with life all dark,
Feet tether'd, hands fetter'd
Fast to the stone,
The grim walls, square-letter'd
With prison'd men's groan.

Still strain the banner-poles
Through the wind's song,
Westward the banner rolls
Over my wrong. 

i like the silence at the lake
as little insects dance
plunging their little legs
every now and then
to create tiny swirls of ripples
the convulsive smile of a little child
as mom carresses him
head to toe
i like the frog on the lily pad
a haven for meditation
his eyes fixed onto sky and clouds
as it zooms onto zero thought
a zen monk in his familiar garden
that perceives himself 
that enviable space
between god and creation
that space where nothing exists
until he said 'Let it Bet'.
i like the peace and calm
when the tiniest  life is amplified
when the senses are sharpened
to every sound, sight, and action
when one finds oneself psyched
into the creative well of divinity


I thought money will give it to me
But I was so very wrong, 
I thought success will give it to me
Again I was wrong.

I thought if I struggle now
I can be happy later, 
If I earn now, 
I can enjoy it later.

But it seems not to come to me
However hard I try, 
It keeps going away from me
My priorities were probably wrong.

Happiness is in the outlook
Happiness is when you keep others happy
There is no point in the pursuit of happiness
It is always with you, just need to see it.

CR VGAIn the pursuit of happiness, ..
I have crossed many bridges-
Climbed many mountains
 & traveled many roads; 
Some very smooth..
 some very bumpy..
I have run very fast-
 sometimes very slow-
But, nevertheless, 
I have learned my lessons-
I have learned the hard & painful way-
That not all dreams come true..
Happiness becomes a matter.
of the mind and the heart-
Now I cry without tears. 
& try to mend my broken heart-

Now I realize.. 
that where there is an ending..
There is a new beginning..
& what I thought was a loss..
turned out to be..
a blessing from the sky. 


On the great waters of the unsounded sea,
Momently listening with suspended oar
For the low rote of waves upon a shore
Changeless as heaven, where never fog-cloud drifts
Over its windless wood, nor mirage lifts
The steadfast hills; where never birds of doubt
Sing to mislead, and every dream dies out,
And the dark riddles which perplex us here
In the sharp solvent of its light are clear?
Thou knowest how vain our quest; how, soon or late,
The baffling tides and circles of debate
Swept back our bark unto its starting-place,
Where, looking forth upon the blank, gray space,
And round about us seeing, with sad eyes,
The same old difficult hills and cloud-cold skies,
We said: 'This outward search availeth not
To find Him. He is farther than we thought,
Or, haply, nearer. To this very spot
Whereon we wait, this commonplace of home,
As to the well of Jacob, He may come
And tell us all things.' As I listened there,
Through the expectant silences of prayer,
Somewhat I seemed to hear, which hath to me
Been hope, strength, comfort, and I give it thee.

'The riddle of the world is understood
As only he can feel who makes his love
The ladder of his faith, and climbs above
On th' rounds of his best instincts; draws no line
Between mere human goodness and divine,
With a child's trust leans on a Father's breast,
And hears unmoved the old creeds babble still
Of kingly power and dread caprice of will,
Chary of blessing, prodigal of curse,
The pitiless doomsman of the universe.
Can Hatred ask for love? Can Selfishness
Invite to self-denial? Is He less
Than man in kindly dealing? Can He break
His own great law of fatherhood, forsake
And curse His children? Not for earth and heaven
Can separate tables of the law be given.
No rule can bind which He himself denies;
The truths of time are not eternal lies.'

So heard I; and the chaos round me spread
'Our sins are our tormentors, worst of all
Felt in distrustful shame that dares not call
Upon Thee as our Father. We have set
A strange god up, but Thou remainest yet.
All that I feel of pity Thou hast known
Before I was; my best is all Thy own.
From Thy great heart of goodness mine but drew
In Thy own time, by ways I cannot see,
All that I feel when I am nearest Thee!


'I was traveling by the sea-shore
in quest of my foe
i did not find and i m fully tired
to take rest
i find every one to be busy with one's job 
every one is running behind bread
even dry bread, some running behind
bread - butter with luxury life
but some are running behind salvation
but i could not find even a single foe
some one is suffering from some complexities
race, religion, caste, creed, society or
due to his money and status of life
I find all these the mean mindedness
So, i forgo  and leave it
I do not treat as the reason for being foe
I am tired, I do not find any foe
Please let me find my foe


Let us quest out a new world
where all  will be happy
where no one will have to think
for bread, butter and roof
I do not think there is any one
who does not work
but if all endeavors are getting futile
who is to reply.
Let us vow for a new world
happiest world
where the precious time of human being
will not be wasted
on war or unreasonable  cause
rather spend for human welfare
or bright prospects of 
universal kind


We see it each day in the paper, 
And know that there's mischief in store; 
That some unprofessional caper 
Has landed a shark on the shore. 
We know there'll be plenty of trouble 
Before they get through with the fun, 
Because he's been coming the double 
On clients, has "Gentleman, One". 
Alas for the gallant attorney, 
Intent upon cutting a dash! 
He starts on life's perilous journey 
With rather more cunning than cash. 
And fortune at first is inviting -- 
He struts his brief hour in the sun -- 
But, lo! on the wall is the writing 
Of Nemesis, "Gentleman, One". 

For soon he runs short of the dollars, 
He fears he must go to the wall; 
So Peters' trust-money he collars 
To pay off his creditor, Paul; 
Then robs right and left -- for he goes it 
In earnest when once he's begun. 
Descensus Averni -- he knows it; 
It's easy for "Gentleman, One". 

The crash comes as soon as the seasons, 
He loses his coin in a mine, 
Or booming in land, or for reasons 
Connected with women and wine. 
Or maybe the cards or the horses 
A share of the damage have done -- 
No matter, the end of the course is 
The same: "Re a Gentleman, One
 


He struggles awhile to keep going, 
To stave off detection and shame; 
But creditors, clamorous growing, 
Ere long put an end to the game. 
At length the poor soldier of Satan 
His course to a finish has run -- 
And just think of Windeyer waiting 
To deal with "A Gentleman, One"! 

And some face it boldly, and brazen 
The shame and the utter disgrace; 
While others, more sensitive, hasten 
Their names and their deeds to efface. 
They snap the frail thread which the Furies 
And Fates have so cruelly spun. 
May the great Final Judge and His juries 
Have mercy on "Gentleman, One"

I had eight birds hatched in one nest,
Four cocks there were, and hens the rest.
I nursed them up with pain and care,
Nor cost, nor labour did I spare,
Till at the last they felt their wing,
Mounted the trees, and learned to sing;
Chief of the brood then took his flight
To regions far and left me quite.
My mournful chirps I after send,
Till he return, or I do end:
Leave not thy nest, thy dam and sire,
Fly back and sing amidst this choir.
My second bird did take her flight,
And with her mate flew out of sight;
Southward they both their course did bend,
And seasons twain they there did spend,
Till after blown by southern gales,
They norward steered with filled sails.
A prettier bird was no where seen,
Along the beach among the treen.
I have a third of colour white,
On whom I placed no small delight;
Coupled with mate loving and true,
Hath also bid her dam adieu;
And where Aurora first appears,
She now hath perched to spend her years.
One to the academy flew
To chat among that learned crew;
Ambition moves still in his breast
That he might chant above the rest
Striving for more than to do well,
That nightingales he might excel.
My fifth, whose down is yet scarce gone,
Is 'mongst the shrubs and bushes flown,
And as his wings increase in strength,
On higher boughs he'll perch at length.
My other three still with me nest,
Until they're grown, then as the rest,
Or here or there they'll take their flight,
As is ordained, so shall they light.
If birds could weep, then would my tears
Let others know what are my fears
Lest this my brood some harm should catch,
And be surprised for want of watch,
Whilst pecking corn and void of care,
They fall un'wares in fowler's snare,
Or whilst on trees they sit and sing,
Some untoward boy at them do fling,
Or whilst allured with bell and glass,
The net be spread, and caught, alas.
Or lest by lime-twigs they be foiled,
Or by some greedy hawks be spoiled.
O would my young, ye saw my breast,
And knew what thoughts there sadly rest,
Great was my pain when I you fed,
Long did I keep you soft and warm,
And with my wings kept off all harm,
My cares are more and fears than ever,
My throbs such now as 'fore were never.
Alas, my birds, you wisdom want,
Of perils you are ignorant;
Oft times in grass, on trees, in flight,
Sore accidents on you may light.
O to your safety have an eye,
So happy may you live and die.
Meanwhile my days in tunes I'll spend,
Till my weak lays with me shall end.
In shady woods I'll sit and sing,
And things that past to mind I'll bring.
Once young and pleasant, as are you,
But former toys (no joys) adieu.
My age I will not once lament,
But sing, my time so near is spent.
And from the top bough take my flight
Into a country beyond sight,
Where old ones instantly grow young,
And there with seraphims set song;
No seasons cold, nor storms they see;
But spring lasts to eternity.
When each of you shall in your nest
Among your young ones take your rest,
In chirping language, oft them tell,
You had a dam that loved you well,
That did what could be done for young,
And nursed you up till you were strong,
And 'fore she once would let you fly,
She showed you joy and misery;
Taught what was good, and what was ill,
What would save life, and what would kill.
Thus gone, amongst you I may live,
And dead, yet speak, and counsel give:
Farewell, my birds, farewell adieu,
I happy am, if well with you. 

In the fair land o'erwatched by Ischia's mountains,
Across the charmed bay
Whose blue waves keep with Capri's silver fountains
Perpetual holiday,

A king lies dead, his wafer duly eaten,
His gold-bought masses given;
And Rome's great altar smokes with gums to sweeten
Her foulest gift to Heaven.

And while all Naples thrills with mute thanksgiving,
For the dead monster so abhorred while living
In mourning garb is seen.

By lone Edgbaston's side
Stands a great city in the sky's sad raining,
Bareheaded and wet-eyed!

Silent for once the restless hive of labor,
Save the low funeral tread,
Or voice of craftsman whispering to his neighbor
The good deeds of the dead.

For him no minster's chant of the immortals
Rose from the lips of sin;
No mitred priest swung back the heavenly portals
To let the white soul in.

But Age and Sickness framed their tearful faces
In the low hovel's door,
And prayers went up from all the dark by-places
And Ghettos of the poor.

The pallid toiler and the negro chattel,
The vagrant of the street,
The human dice wherewith in games of battle
The lords of earth compete,

Touched with a grief that needs no outward draping,
All swelled the long lament,
Of grateful hearts, instead of marble, shaping
His viewless monument!

For never yet, with ritual pomp and splendor,
In the long heretofore,
A heart more loyal, warm, and true, and tender,
Has England's turf closed o'er.

And if there fell from out her grand old steeples
No crash of brazen wail,
The murmurous woe of kindreds, tongues, and peoples
Swept in on every gale.

It came from Holstein's birchen-belted meadows,
And from the tropic calms
Of Indian islands in the sunlit shadows
Of Occidental palms;

From the locked roadsteads of the Bothniaii peasants,
And harbors of the Finn,
Where war's worn victims saw his gentle presence

To seek the lost, to build the old waste places,
To link the hostile shores
Of severing seas, and sow with England's daisies
The moss of Finland's moors.

Thanks for the good man's beautiful example,
Who in the vilest saw
Some sacred crypt or altar of a temple

And heard with tender ear the spirit sighing
As from its prison cell,
Praying for pity, like the mournful crying
Of Jonah out of hell.

Not his the golden pen's or lip's persuasion,
But a fine sense of right,
And Truth's directness, meeting each occasion
Straight as a line of light.

His faith and works, like streams that intermingle,
In the same channel ran
The crystal clearness of an eye kept single
Shamed all the frauds of man.

The very gentlest of all human natures
He joined to courage strong,
With sturdy hate of wrong.

Tender as woman, manliness and meekness
In him were so allied
That they who judged him by his strength or weakness
Saw but a single side.

Men failed, betrayed him, but his zeal seemed nourished
By failure and by fall;
Still a large faith in human-kind he cherished,

And now he rests: his greatness and his sweetness
No more shall seem at strife,
And death has moulded into calm completeness
The statue of his life.

Where the dews glisten and the songbirds warble,
His dust to dust is laid,
In Nature's keeping, with no pomp of marble
To shame his modest shade.

The forges glow, the hammers all are ringing;
Beneath its smoky vale,
Hard by, the city of his love is swinging
Its clamorous iron flail.


But round his grave are quietude and beauty,
And the sweet heaven above,--
The fitting symbols of a life of duty
Transfigured into love

Look above the big eyewear
Bold repertoires a woman making space
Sleeks out of many folds of silence
Speaks crisp she knows she can
Say light and from above the rims
All the way sleeping unlike others
Shrouded in mystery cloaks
My space on the edge holding 
Residences have seen more to talk
One space and another nothing 
Blessed is the one who gets a little

Islamabad
I will grieve alone,
As I strolled alone, years ago, down along
The Ohio shore.
I hid in the hobo jungle weeds
Upstream from the sewer main,
Pondering, gazing.

I saw, down river,
At Twenty-third and Water Streets
By the vinegar works,
The doors open in early evening.
Swinging their purses, the women
Poured down the long street to the river
And into the river.

I do not know how it was
They could drown every evening.
What time near dawn did they climb up the other shore,
Drying their wings?

For the river at Wheeling, West Virginia,
Has only two shores:
The one in hell, the other
In Bridgeport, Ohio.

And nobody would commit suicide, only
To find beyond death
Bridgeport, Ohio. 

As I went down to Dymchurch Wall,
I heard the South sing o'er the land
I saw the yellow sunlight fall
On knolls where Norman churches stand.

And ringing shrilly, taut and lithe,
Within the wind a core of sound,
The wire from Romney town to Hythe
Along its airy journey wound.

A veil of purple vapour flowed
And trailed its fringe along the Straits;
The upper air like sapphire glowed:
And roses filled Heaven's central gates.

Masts in the offing wagged their tops;
The swinging waves pealed on the shore;
The saffron beach, all diamond drops
And beads of surge, prolonged the roar.

As I came up from Dymchurch Wall,
I saw above the Downs' low crest
The crimson brands of sunset fall,
Flicker and fade from out the West.

Night sank: like flakes of silver fire
The stars in one great shower came down;
Shrill blew the wind; and shrill the wire
Rang out from Hythe to Romney town.

The darkly shining salt sea drops
Streamed as the waves clashed on the shore;
The beach, with all its organ stops
Pealing again, prolonged the roar. 

I

I gaze upon a city,— 
A city new and strange,— 
Down many a watery vista 
My fancy takes a range; 
From side to side I saunter, 
And wonder where I am; 
And can you be in England, 
And I at Rotterdam!

II

Before me lie dark waters 
In broad canals and deep, 
Whereon the silver moonbeams 
Sleep, restless in their sleep; 
A sort of vulgar Venice 
Reminds me where I am; 
Yes, yes, you are in England, 
And I'm at Rotterdam.

III

Tall houses with quaint gables, 
Where frequent windows shine, 
And quays that lead to bridges, 
And trees in formal line, 
And masts of spicy vessels 
From western Surinam, 
All tell me you're in England, 
But I'm in Rotterdam.

IV

Those sailors, how outlandish 
The face and form of each! 
They deal in foreign gestures, 
And use a foreign speech; 
A tongue not learn'd near Isis, 
Or studied by the Cam, 
Declares that you're in England, 
And I'm at Rotterdam.

V

And now across a market 
My doubtful way I trace, 
Where stands a solemn statue, 
The Genius of the place; 
And to the great Erasmus 
I offer my salaam; 
Who tells me you're in England, 
But I'm at Rotterdam.

VI

The coffee-room is open— 
I mingle in its crowd,— 
The dominos are noisy— 
The hookahs raise a cloud; 
The flavor, none of Fearon's, 
That mingles with my dram, 
Reminds me you're in England, 
And I'm at Rotterdam.

VII

Then here it goes, a bumper— 
The toast it shall be mine, 
In schiedam, or in sherry, 
Tokay, or hock of Rhine; 
It well deserves the brightest, 
Where sunbeam ever swam— 
'The Girl I love in England' 
I drink at Rotterdam!In Salem dwelt a glorious King, 
Raised from a shepherd's lowly state;
That did His praises like an angel sing
Who did the World create.
By many great and bloody wars
He was advanced unto Thrones
But more delighted in the stars
Than in the splendour of his precious stones;
Nor gold nor silver did his eye regard


A warlike champion he had been, 
And many feats of chivalry
Had done: in kingly courts his eye had seen
A vast variety 
Of earthly joys: Yet he despis'd 
Those fading honours, and false pleasures
Which are by mortals so much prized;
And placed his happiness in other treasures
No state of life which in this world we find
Could yield contentment to his greater mind.


His fingers touched his trembling lyre, 
And every quavering string did yield
A sound that filled all the Jewish quire,
And echoed in the field.
No pleasure was so great to him
As in a silent night to see
The moon and stars: A cherubim
Above them, even here, he seem'd to be:
Enflam'd with Love it was his great desire,
To sing, contemplate, ponder, and admire.


He was a prophet, and foresaw 
Things extant in the world to come:
He was a judge, and ruled by a law
That than the honeycomb
Was sweeter far: he was a sage,
And all his people could advise;
An oracle, whose every page
Contained in verse the greatest mysteries;
But most he then enjoyed himself when he
Did as a poet praise the Deity.


A shepherd, soldier, and divine,
A judge, a courtier, and a king,
Priest, angel, prophet, oracle, did shine
At once when he did sing.
Philosopher and poet too
Did in his melody appear;
All these in him did please the view
Of those that did his heavenly music hear
And every drop that from his flowing quill
Came down, did all the world with nectar fill


He had a deep and perfect sense
Of all the glories and the pleasures
Of such transcendent treasures
Made him on earth an heavenly king,
And filled his solitudes with joy ;
He never did more sweetly sing
Than when alone, though that doth mirth destroy:*
Sense did his soul with heavenly life inspire, 


Rich, sacred, deep and precious things
Did here on earth the man surround:
With all the Glory of the King of Kings
He was most strangely crowned. 
His clear soul and open sight 
Things filling Angels with delight: 
His ear did hear their heavenly melody,
And when he was alone he all became 
That Bliss implied, or did increase his fame.


All arts he then did exercise;
By secret ravishments above the skies
He carried was before
He died. His soul did see and feel
What others know not; and became,
A constant, heavenly, pure, seraphic flame.
Oh that I might unto his throne aspire,
And all his joys above the stars admire

Men say the world is full of fear and hate,
And all life's ripening harvest-fields await
The restless sickle of relentless fate.

But I, sweet Soul, rejoice that I was born,
When from the climbing terraces of corn
I watch the golden orioles of Thy morn.

What care I for the world's desire and pride,
Who know the silver wings that gleam and glide,
The homing pigeons of Thine eventide?

What care I for the world's loud weariness,
Who dream in twilight granaries Thou dost bless
With delicate sheaves of mellow silences?

Say, shall I heed dull presages of doom,
Or dread the rumoured loneliness and gloom,
The mute and mythic terror of the tomb?

For my glad heart is drunk and drenched with Thee,
O inmost wind of living ecstasy!
O intimate essence of eternity

Still sits the school-house by the road, 
A ragged beggar sleeping; 
Around it still the sumachs grow, 
And blackberry-vines are creeping. 

Within, the master's desk is seen, 
Deep-scarred by raps official; 
The warping floor, the battered seats, 
The jack-knife's carved initial; 

The charcoal frescoes on its wall; 
Its door's worn sill, betraying 
The feet that, creeping slow to school, 
Went storming out to playing! 

Long years ago a winter sun 
Shone over it at setting; 
Lit up its western window-panes, 
And low eaves' icy fretting. 

It touched the tangled golden curls, 
And brown eyes full of grieving, 
Of one who still her steps delayed 
When all the school were leaving. 

For near it stood the little boy 
Her childish favor singled; 
His cap pulled low upon a face 
Where pride and shame were mingled. 

Pushing with restless feet the snow 
To right and left, he lingered;--- 
As restlessly her tiny hands 
The blue-checked apron fingered. 

He saw her lift her eyes; he felt 
The soft hand's light caressing, 
And heard the tremble of her voice, 
As if a fault confessing. 

"I'm sorry that I spelt the word: 
I hate to go above you, 
Because,"---the brown eyes lower fell,--- 
"Because, you see, I love you!" 

Still memory to a gray-haired man 
That sweet child-face is showing. 
Dear girl! the grasses on her grave 
Have forty years been growing! 

He lives to learn, in life's hard school, 
How few who pass above him 
Lament their triumph and his loss, 
Like her, because they love him. 

From dusk to dawn,
From town to town,
Without a single clue,
I seek the tender, slender foot
To fit this crystal shoe.
From dusk to dawn,
I try it on
Each damsel that I meet.
And I still love her so, but oh,
I've started hating feet. 

Her short stories and novels are seen as part of history
Hercule Poirot was a fictional detective whose record of failure was zero
He is one of two famous detectives in the crime stories she wrote
Poirot was a Belgium immigrant to England during the First World War
His home and work address was  Whitehaven Mansions, London
which was never a bore
Poirot was a short little man with black hair and a moustache
who carried himself with elegance
He worked at solving crimes with great diligence
Poirot was impeccably neat, formal, vain, opinionated, and
almost compulsive in his behaviour
People who sought his help viewed him as their saviour
Poirot solved crimes by clues, logic, psychology, and intuition
He is so famous that to lunches and dinner parties
of the wealthy he gets an invitation
Poirot concealed important details of his plans
Figuring out the mystery has made readers and viewers his fans
Poirot tended not to examine crime scenes in detail
Rather he sought to discover what the nature of the victim or
the psychology of the murderer would entail
Poirot assumed that certain crimes were committed by certain types of people
The criminals he caught were usually among the cast of characters 
in the stories and were the most reachable
Poirot in his career has solved crimes in England
and the world all over
From his home base in London to Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, 
and the white cliffs of Dover
After many years of solving crimes Poirot was recently retired
This moral, intelligent, and sophisticated little detective was very tired
by popular demand
Millions of viewers and readers are virtually his to command
A new detective novelist, Sophie Hannah, has received the
Sophie Hannah has now written The Monogram Murders to the 
public's interest satiate
This new novel now means that Poirot is once again with us
but unlike the calm and composed Poirot the public is sure to make a fuss


O! my self! poor self! , 
What do you crave for? 
Don't you know? 
In the cradle of endurance, 
But you sail, 
In the coffin of whims, O Abdulrazak.

O! my self! poor self! , 
What are you proud of? 
Don't you know? 
That pride has a fall, 
And shame follows fame, 
But you exalt self, 
In the coffin of pride, O Abdulrazak.

O! my self! poor self! 
What do you beautify? 
Don't you know? 
That time takes away, 
And the body turns ugly, 
But you beautify, 
In the coffin of masks, O Abdulrazak.

O! my self! poor self! 
What are you hoarding? 
Don't you know? 
That no material wealth accompanies, 
And you depart alone, 
But you accumulate, 
In the coffin of wealth, O Abdulrazak.

O! my self! poor self! 
What do you wait for? 
Don't you know? 
That death awaits, 
In fall of every second, 
But you pass time, 
In the coffin of 'tomorrows', O Abdulrazak.

O! my self! poor self! 
What do you plan for? 
Don't you know? 
There's a mighty universal plan, 
To defend your plan, 
But you fabricate, 
In the coffin of plots, O Abdulrazak. 

Sleep, you ornery rascal, 
why is it you elude me? 

Like a crush, you tease the senses, 
you taunt me with your charms.

Needing you, I'm bribed and baited, 
much smitten with desire.

Your allure in awkward places
has me always hiding yawns.

You deflower me in a movie, 
you corrupt me on my couch.

Should you take up prostitution, 
might I gladly buy some time? 

Sleep come take me lying down, 
not driving in my car! 

Then sighing in depravity, 
again I call from bed -

Sleep, you naughty pervert, 
I want you, take me now

Embedding new rules 
in a new arrangement 
and having a new strategy, 
the white king is driving 
the opposing one to the wrong corner 
for being controlled by the bishop.
The white king is very rich.
He takes seemingly worthless properties 
from his own people 
and turns them into his own properties 
while defending a system 
which has enslaved and still exploits.
Thus, he gladly tries to see himself 
as a great hero while
thinking how smart and clever he is 
when he can encounter the Dark Essence. 
His citizens become blind and very poor.

The black king has the power, 
he has respect for the private property 
and for the rights of the people 
to freely acquire and use this property.
In his kingdom, there are people 
who are rich and people who are very rich.
But the black king is blind. 

The bishop gets greedy
 because his two cards are identical.
Moreover, he may split the cards into two hands
and his two hands 
can be played out independently. 


He tries to hide because 
he is paid to do this

He has a lot of knights, very good fighters, 
but they are fighting for nothing. 

The white is still trying 
his perfect chess mate.

I think that he is trying 
to force too much in the match. 

But he can win because 
the chess is a sport 
which is really picking up momentum.

You can see that the chess 
can become an easy game 
and the last thing to check, 
before you move up and down, 
is to see if you know its secrets 
or if you can highlight some key issues 
in the movement strategy 
because the movements 
do not adequately insert 
in the universal rules. 

The movements are set in real places
and, sometimes, include real events 
as well as imaginary ones
like that twirling zone, 
which is capable of moving itself 
in a stealthy or a secret manner. 

And you must have an infinity of ideas. 
When something can be dissolved, 
it can be reconstructed 
into new, complex formulas. 

If you have the courage to play no-limit, 
you can play no-limit. 

If you have no courage to play, 
then don't play. 

Who cares? 

In fact, it is the same 
bleeding atmosphere for all
and the same moribund Earth.  

Graceful, spiritual,
with the gentleness of arabesques
our life is similar
to the existence of fairies
that spin in soft cadence
around nothingness
to which we sacrifice
the here and now

Dreams of beauty, youthful joy
like a breath in pure harmony
with the depth of your young surface
where sparkles the longing for the night
for blood and barbarity

In the emptiness, spinning, without aims or needs
dance free our lives
always ready for the game
yet, secretly, we thirst for reality
for the conceiving, for the birth
we are thirst for sorrows and death


In seeking and searching myself, 
I was exhausted and yet, 
I could not reach mystic knowledge 
Sticking to it, 
I intensified my efforts 
Lo and behold: I attained my goal; 
Brimful there, are all vessels 
and no one's there to drink:some poems are not perfect
because the mind and the heart
fail meet eye to eye

usually it is the mind that fails
to deliver, going to where it 
does not belong failing 
the disciplinary test

the heart begs everything to be 
in place, so that 
the world can amplifly 
itself to her  as she interpretes 
the input word by word, image by image
- in correct sequence


You left the lines blank for me love 
And again you ask why wrote my plaint 
When you are in front of me I am lost 
In the beauty of your hair your lips 
In the gazelle eyes and the music 
From the tongue that licks honey 
When I open my mouth for my words 
You place your finger on your lips
Enter the silence of my love else 
I leave you in the oblivions vast 

Like a flute from the reed in silence 
Wail I long as separated from beloved 
You make my silence in colors float 
When in the bloom of spring I enter 
The garden where nightingale sings 
In silence sitting by the rose 
In silence my love I live in thou


Tagus, farewell! that westward with thy streams 
Turns up the grains of gold already tried
With spur and sail, for I go to seek the Thames
Gainward the sun that shewth her wealthy pride, 
And to the town which Brutus sought by dreams, 
Like bended moon doth lend her lusty side. 
My king, my country, alone for whome I live, 
Of mighty love the wings for this me give. 

Your grasses up north are as blue as jade, 
Our mulberries here curve green-threaded branches; 
And at last you think of returning home, 
Now when my heart is almost broken. . 
O breeze of the spring, since I dare not know you, 
Why part the silk curtains by my bed

In spring rain
a pretty girl
    yawning.
 



My garden blazes brightly with the rose-bush and the peach,
And the 
koil sings above it, in the siris by the well,
From the creeper-covered trellis comes the squirrel's chattering speech,
And the blue jay screams and flutters where the cheery 
sat-bhai dwell.
But the rose has lost its fragrance, and the 
koil's note is strange;
I am sick of endless sunshine, sick of blossom-burdened bough.
Give me back the leafless woodlands where the winds of Springtime range --
Give me back one day in England, for it's Spring in England now!

Through the pines the gusts are booming, o'er the brown fields blowing chill,
From the furrow of the ploughshare streams the fragrance of the loam,
And the hawk nests on the cliffside and the jackdaw in the hill,
And my heart is back in England 'mid the sights and sounds of Home.
But the garland of the sacrifice this wealth of rose and peach is,
Ah! 
koil, little 
koil, singing on the 
siris bough,
In my ears the knell of exile your ceaseless bell like speech is --
Can you tell me aught of England or of Spring in England now

In summer's heat and mid-time of the day,
To rest my limbs upon a bed I lay,
One window shut, the other open stood,
Which gave such light as twinkles in a wood
Like twilight glimpse at setting of the sun,
Or night being past and yet not day begun.
Such light to shamefaced maidens must be shown,
Where they may sport, and seem to be unknown.
Then came Corinna in a long, loose gown,
Her white neck hid with tresses hanging down,
Resembling fair Semiramis going to bed,
Or Lais of a thousand wooers sped.
I snatched her gown, being thin the harm was small,
Yet strived she to be covered therewithal,
And, striving thus as one that would be chaste,
Betrayed herself, and yielded at the last.
Stark naked as she stood before mine eye,
Not one wen in her body could I spy.
What arms and shoulders did I touch and see?
How apt her breasts were to be pressed by me?
How smooth a belly under her waist saw I?
How large a leg, and what a lusty thigh?
To leave the rest, all liked me passing well;
I clinged her naked body, down she fell.
Judge you the rest. Being tired, she bade me kiss.
Jove send me more such afternoons as this. 

In summer showers a skreeking noise is heard
Deep in the woods of some uncommon bird
It makes a loud and long and loud continued noise
And often stops the speed of men and boys
They think somebody mocks and goes along
And never thinks the nuthatch makes the song
Who always comes along the summer guest
The birdnest hunters never found the nest
The schoolboy hears the noise from day to day
And stoops among the thorns to find a way
And starts the jay bird from the bushes green
He looks and sees a nest he's never seen
And takes the spotted eggs with many joys
And thinks he found the bird that made the noise~

Arm unswung, hangs idly. Except for the bird's
Wings' clasp and musical wasp's flight
Dragon fly past a flower and bee suckling in deep.
Shadows change, by inch, creepers riding walls
Crimson autumn leaves and abundant fresh air.
The majestic mountains with their backs
Their fronts the other side in humble poise
As age has sharpened the furrows on them.
Even words float in the air. She spoke yesterday, 
And I am catching them today, many more wait 
For me, on the windows aisle and others swimming.
Pull anything anywhere, find it again after a year
Waiting upon you. Living cannot be more joyous -
The houses built three thousand years ago
Whose doors open for you on their swing.
The night will bring Jinn, their eyes slit vertical
Fairies with wings of butterfly and demons 
Whose feet are back turned walking by the wall, 
Expressed wish is no wish, fulfilled dream is no dream.



When I am old
I will not have you look apart
From me, into the cold,
Friend of my heart,
Nor be sad in your remembrance
Of the careless, mad-heart semblance
That the wind hath blown away
When I am old.

When I am old
And the white hot wonder-fire
Unto the world seem cold,
My soul's desire
Know you then that all life's shower,
The rain of the years, that hour
Shall make blow for us one flower,
Including all, when we are old.

When I am old
If you remember
Any love save what is then
Hearth light unto life's December
Be your joy of past sweet chalices
To know then naught but this
"How many wonders are less sweet
Than love I bear to thee
When I am old

"Coral rose in the garden in June, and another rose, 
another coral, the dye shading the garden floor, close 
to me, jewel after June rain, flare of integral color, 
rose in the dusk, hoist of the petals, pillar of thorns, 
the light on benches and doors going out.
The dream I started to remember went out of focus.
Suspicion of some kind in the dream, apprehension 
in the dream, left unverifiable. In a garden in June. 
The intent of the dream itself, an unknown act
whatever significance I give to it. And the mood 
that follows, how it happens, the connections 
come apart. The coral light is closer but unclear, 
also without intent. The coral light is open.
The nude coral, the color of her lips, the shadow 
color under the coral petal, under the hoist 
of the branches. And walking back up the stairs 
the dream is vaguely absorbed,  in the dusk, 
indeterminate sincere trust within that mood, 
another intent I can not name. A breeze comes 
out of the shade, remote coral and aquarial light 
in the casement window, opposite the garden. 
I will join her in there, the rounded coral shored up 
in the turn of her hips will draw me in, 
latent with another smell, all the little vague 
awakenings, and coral, and dusk full of moisture 
that feeds the rose beds. 

What shall I render to Thy name 
       Or how Thy praises speak? 
My thanks how shall I testify? 

I owe so much, so little can 
       Return unto Thy name, 
Confusion seizes on my soul, 
       And I am filled with shame.

       To Thee shall come all flesh 
Thou hast me heard and answered, 
       My plaints have had access.

What did I ask for but Thou gav'st? 
       What could I more desire? 
But thankfulness even all my days 
       I humbly this require.

       In number numberless, 
Impossible for to recount 
       Or any way express.

O help Thy saints that sought Thy face 
       T' return unto Thee praise 
And walk before Thee as they ought, 
       In strict and upright ways. 

In that other reality-
regardless of the slope or slant-
one cycles looking much like me
& Scales each hill w/out a pant; 

his title states he made the grade
& lessers seek him to sign a form.
He managed his financial aid
stayed in school, endured the dorm; 

commands particular stadium seating
while mantel sags w/ just rewards, 
presentable in jeans or cords; 

flustered friends await his blessing, 
the show can’t start ‘till he arrives, 
a frightened child craves his caressing, 
that reassurance he Provides.

In that other reality
the sun shines brightest on my street.
We all feel hear & plainly see
(each standing on our own true feat) 
just how much worse it all could be. 

She came and stood in the Old South Church,
A wonder and a sign,
With a look the old-time sibyls wore,
Half-crazed and half-divine.

Save the mournful sackcloth about her wound,
Unclothed as the primal mother,
With limbs that trembled and eyes that blazed
With a fire she dare not smother.

Loose on her shoulders fell her hair,
With sprinkled ashes gray;
She stood in the broad aisle strange and weird
As a soul at the judgment day.

And the minister paused in his sermon's midst,
And the people held their breath,
For these were the words the maiden spoke
Through lips as the lips of death:

All men my courts shall tread,
And priest and ruler no more shall eat
My people up like bread!

In thunder and breaking seals
Let all souls worship Him in the way
His light within reveals.'

She shook the dust from her naked feet,
And her sackcloth closer drew,
And into the porch of the awe-hushed church
She passed like a ghost from view.

They whipped her away at the tail o' the cart
Through half the streets of the town,
But the words she uttered that day nor fire
Could burn nor water drown.

And now the aisles of the ancient church
By equal feet are trod,
And the bell that swings in its belfry rings

And now whenever a wrong is done
It thrills the conscious walls;
The stone from the basement cries aloud
And the beam from the timber calls.

There are steeple-houses on every hand,
And pulpits that bless and ban,
That is set apart for man.

For in two commandments are all the law
And the prophets under the sun,
And the first is last and the last is first,
And the twain are verily one.

So, long as Boston shall Boston be,
And her bay-tides rise and fall,
Shall freedom stand in the Old South Church
And plead for the rights of all

I like to fly high, higher and highest in the sky
Being free from all these impending sorrows and strife
Wanting to fly high above, abundantly in the sky
Where there is no boundaries of anything
Nor any selfish desires and mean feelings of mine.

I intend to float along with the white moving clouds
Over the expanse of sprawling meadows, a rivulet
Quietly flowing by and a peaceful picturesque -
Solitary country side.

Being so tired -
In living in this suffocating jungle of human society
With it’s unending desires, selfishness and egos, 
With unbelievable torture, hatred and strife! ! 

Wanting to fly high above, abundantly in the sky
Where there is no boundaries of anything
Nor any selfish desires and mean feelings of mine.


Nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor
make up the air we breathe so they say.
There is much more nitrogen than oxygen: 
surprising really, as oxygen is vital to life.
Most mountaineers need oxygen flasks 
to breathe and climb on the high slopes 
of uncertainty winding to the top, 
which attracts like a magnet
In the air.

Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler
did not use artificial oxygen, though, 
when they pushed to the summit of Mt. Everest
alpine style with lightweight backpacks back
in  when anew courage, cold as ice, was
In the air.




In the Atlantic a glass-palace dreams, 
There brides are frightened waking and all wait.
Blue-lighted crystals snow out of sulphate, 
Because at clear bays still recalls the night.

There bride grooms pallid dream and are in fright.
And frigates after weary voyages stay, 
And down the masts the flags flat in the bay, 
As at the sea-ground still the palace lied.




What do you sell O ye merchants ?
Richly your wares are displayed.
Turbans of crimson and silver,
Tunics of purple brocade,
Mirrors with panels of amber,
Daggers with handles of jade.

What do you weigh, O ye vendors?
Saffron and lentil and rice.
What do you grind, O ye maidens?
Sandalwood, henna, and spice.
What do you call , O ye pedlars?
Chessmen and ivory dice.

What do you make,O ye goldsmiths?
Wristlet and anklet and ring,
Bells for the feet of blue pigeons
Frail as a dragon-fly’s wing,
Girdles of gold for dancers,
Scabbards of gold for the king.

What do you cry,O ye fruitmen?
Citron, pomegranate, and plum.
What do you play ,O musicians?
Cithar, sarangi and drum.
what do you chant, O magicians?
Spells for aeons to come.

What do you weave, O ye flower-girls
With tassels of azure and red?
Crowns for the brow of a bridegroom,
Chaplets to garland his bed.
Sheets of white blossoms new-garnered
To perfume the sleep of the dead. 

There is a fish, that quivers in the pool,
itself a shadow, but its shadow, clear.
Catch it again and again, it still is there.

Against the flowing stream, its life keeps pace
with death - the impulse and the flash of grace
hiding in its stillness, moves to be motionless.

No net will hold it - always it will return
Where the ripples settle, and the sand -
It lives unmoved, equated with the stream,
As flowers are fit for air, man for his dream. 

In the beginning was the three-pointed star,
One smile of light across the empty face,
One bough of bone across the rooting air,
The substance forked that marrowed the first sun,
And, burning ciphers on the round of space,
Heaven and hell mixed as they spun.

In the beginning was the pale signature,
Three-syllabled and starry as the smile,
And after came the imprints on the water,
Stamp of the minted face upon the moon;
The blood that touched the crosstree and the grail
Touched the first cloud and left a sign.

In the beginning was the mounting fire
That set alight the weathers from a spark,
A three-eyed, red-eyed spark, blunt as a flower,
Life rose and spouted from the rolling seas,
Burst in the roots, pumped from the earth and rock
The secret oils that drive the grass.

In the beginning was the word, the word
That from the solid bases of the light
Abstracted all the letters of the void;
And from the cloudy bases of the breath
The word flowed up, translating to the heart
First characters of birth and death.

In the beginning was the secret brain.
The brain was celled and soldered in the thought
Before the pitch was forking to a sun;
Before the veins were shaking in their sieve,
Blood shot and scattered to the winds of light
The ribbed original of love. 

Ever since those wondrous days of Creation
And He accepted this in His indulgence,
resigned to rest among the distant stars.

Our actions stopped Him from reacting,
for His fist-tight hand is numbed by sleep,
and the times brought in the age of heroes
during which our dark hearts plundered Him.

Sometimes He appears as if tormented,
and His body jerks as if plagued by pain;
but these spells are always outweighed by the
number of His countless other worlds.




WHEN sunshine met the wave,
Then love was born;
Then Venus rose to save
A world forlorn.

For light a thousand wings 
Of joy unfurled,
And bound with golden rings
The icy world.

And color flamed the earth
With glad desire, 
Till life sprang to the birth,
Fire answering fire,

And so the world awoke,
And all was done,
When first the ocean spoke 
Unto the sun. 

In the beginning
No date is givenbut now the lake of words is dry
the eyes produce no rain
from clouds of thoughts

the pink flamingo
of my nose bows down
to reach my mouth

i do not keep the silence 
i do not.  but guess 
the silence keeps me.  

or may be not.  

In the bosom of the fire is the mystery
At the heart of the mystery is a breath
The wind without knowledge or history
The life beyond length, breadth height or depth.

From nothing comes the 'all' for eternity
And eternally in nothingness is revealed
Spirited into being something past sanctity
Sublime from desecrated dying in the unseen

Now dwelling in the circle of the 'not yet'
Becoming unknowing in evolution undefined
Descending to be bourne up in living epithets
Only so.  

does the loved and broken read the signs. 

In the  Catacomb(s)  of Callixtus.
 (also known as the Cemetery of Callixtus) 


A woman prayed in the third century.
Her picture is on the walls of the Catacomb, 
covered the head with a veil
wearing a costly vestment
opening her palms like a shell
as if she prays for all of us.

All women and men of all religions
have lifted up their hands
opening up the palms
of the antique age.

Here in the Catacomb stays a woman
in the underground dark cemetery
praying at the face of death and graves.


come, we shall lift up our hands
and open it like an open shell.

will listen to our prayers for unity.

(There is the mural painting of praying woman
even now in the underground cemetery of the catacomb in Rom. This poem was written after seeing it) . 

For a long time I have been confined 
In the cell of loneliness. 
I am unable to look at the boundless sky 
Where the cloud and the sun play in happiness.

Being confined in the lone cell 
I am losing my strength and power
To enjoy the beauty of nature 
And living in the world of dark hour.

In the mirror of my imagination 
The beauty of a full moon night 
Is no longer reflected. 
There I see nothing but despair's light.  

In the chamber of solitude
Surrounded by empty spaces
Quietly drinking a beer
And smoking a cigarette. 
Unaware of the outside world
A meeting takes place
Of my mind and heart, 
Looking for a reconciliation
And a possible solution
For what I am going through
In this 'my tormented life'
Now and then
A thought of you comes across
Briefly I get excited but must stay cool. 
Just another thought which I shall reject, 
And gain back my self-respect. 
Now this point of time in my life
There are just words without sounds
I must let the music play in the outside
While my life is reviewed
In this chamber of solitude. 


Dust is in her beautiful eyes,
No more she breathes, nor feels, nor stirs;
At her feet and at her head
Lies a slave to attend the dead,
But their dust is white as hers. 

Was she a lady of high degree,
So much in love with the vanity
And foolish pomp of this world of ours?
And lowliness and humility,
The richest and rarest of all dowers? 

Who shall tell us? No one speaks;
No color shoots into those cheeks,
Either of anger or of pride,
At the rude question we have asked;
Nor will the mystery be unmasked
By those who are sleeping at her side. 

Hereafter?--And do you think to look
On the terrible pages of that Book
To find her failings, faults, and errors?
Ah, you will then have other cares,
In your own short-comings and despairs,
In your own secret sins and terrors

Here lies the gentle humorist, who died
In the bright Indian Summer of his fame!
A simple stone, with but a date and name,
Marks his secluded resting-place beside
The river that he loved and glorified.
Here in the autumn of his days he came,
But the dry leaves of life were all aflame
With tints that brightened and were multiplied.
How sweet a life was his; how sweet a death!
Living, to wing with mirth the weary hours,
Or with romantic tales the heart to cheer;
Dying, to leave a memory like the breath
Of summers full of sunshine and of showers,
A grief and gladness in the atmosphere. 

Mountains for my mansion
The forest for my pantry
The clouds for my carpet
The sky for my curtains
The sun for my candle
The wind for my chariot
In the company of eagles

Flying above fear
Floating above failures
Winging above worries
Gliding above gravity
Living above limits
Soaring to success
Come fly with me


This life is sweetest; in this wood 
I hear no children cry for food; 
I see no woman, white with care; 
No man, with muscled wasting here.

No doubt it is a selfish thing 
To fly from human suffering; 
No doubt he is a selfish man, 
Who shuns poor creatures, sad and wan.

But 'tis a wretched life to face 
Hunger in almost every place; 
Cursed with a hand that's empty, when 
The heart is full to help all men.

Can I admire the statue great, 
When living men starve at its feet! 
Can I admire the park's green tree, 
A roof for homeless misery

Here in the crowded city's busy street, 
Swayed by the eager, jostling, hasting throng, 
Where Traffic's voice grows harsher and more strong, 
I see within the stream of hurrying feet 
A company of trees in their retreat, 
Dew-bathed, dream-wrapped, and with a thrush's song 
Emparadizing all the place, along 
Whose paths I hear the pulse of Beauty beat. 
'Twas yesterday I walked beneath the trees, 
To-day I tread the city's stony ways; 
And still the spell that o'er my spirit came 
Turns harshest sounds to shy bird ecstasies, 
Pours scent of pine through murky chimney haze, 
And gives each careworn face a woodland frame. 

limbs grow in the dark to obstruct 
the chariot that ferries the heart, 
which now runs in a maddening speed 
so that it loses its noble direction
to heaven to hell to heaven to hell? 

menacing trees lull like spirits and
wave forlornly, outcasts of a life spent in 
the fearful dungeons of feuds, mistrust, hatred, 
tears and jealousies

the broken windows of a haunted house
sprout eyes that stare for sacrifices of souls
birds and bats flap in the wings of the full moon 
to cast flickering shadows that run on the lane
full of nightmarish tales of curses and evil 

in the stars the hymns of heavens tinkle   
to break through the thickness of night 

the angels wait in earnest to liven up the sky
with music and prayers, clasped hands at the heart
thumping to chase away anything ominous
to give the soul a second chance

and trapped in the broken windows with eyes growing dim 
the devil heaves and sighs


In the dark pine-wood 
I would we lay, 
In deep cool shadow 
At noon of day. 

How sweet to lie there, 
Sweet to kiss, 
Where the great pine-forest 
Enaisled is! 

Thy kiss descending 
Sweeter were 
With a soft tumult 
Of thy hair. 

O unto the pine-wood 
At noon of day 
Come with me now, 
Sweet love, away. 

I sat there, 
folded into myself
in the night
in the rain
in the darkness
in that black hole
in the abyss

without her this world has come down to black and white
the black means death
the white is silent
majority rules and death wins
far too selfless for death I can only live
and live in the dark

folded into myself
in the night
in the rain
in the darkness
in the darkness
with my tears for warmth
and my weeping for conversation


In the cell of life
Many cells which are parted
Parted cells are departed
Up to the electron proton and neutron

Over the light
Lights up the darkness
Over the dark
Switch off the light

Smiling heart hides the lament 
Lamenting heart shows up smile
Duality of sings turn to hybridity 
Hybridity finds a center of unity

Barren and fertile dig the soil
To catch the balance, creeps through the tunnel
On the way, lit up candle goes out
Desperate life invent a fire

In the cell where we live
Spiral tunnel guides us to live
Like a snake crawls 
To catch the prey

Hunger and thirst of desire
Kneels to push and pull
To open up a new cell of life
In the dark and out of the light


In the dead of night, a Sufi began to weep.
He said, 'This world is like a closed coffin, in which
We are shut and in which, through our ignorance,
We spend our lives in folly and desolation.
When Death comes to open the lid of the coffin,
Each one who has wings will fly off to Eternity,
But those without will remain locked in the coffin.
So, my friends, before the lid of this coffin is taken off,
Do all you can to develop your wings and your feathers.

'Alone I lie in the  dead of night
The moon is peeping  with it’s pleasing cool light.
Dreaming my love is  lying by my  side
Smelling your  maddening flesh and sweat.
Looking at  your two wide eyes
I am arrowed  by your lusty  gaze.
Cool breeze is blowing over -
I am caressing you holding tight.
Uniting hand in hand and lips together, 
Getting more close to each other. 

We shivered in warmth-
With unbound joy and lust, 
Caressing and clasping tight
We two become one.
With warm  breath and trembling limbs 
We both started to rise.

The moment you arrowed me 
With your love-hug and the kiss, 
I did have the goosebumps  
Feeling drowning inside you.
Fondled and stormed with kisses
From your hair down to the toe.
Ascending and descending-
On your peaks, valleys and caves.
Sensuality kicks in
And nothing else exists
We moaned and screamed elatedly
And exploded to conclude.
Later you gave me a hug, holding in your arms
We were so content and full as if in seventh sky.
With extreme  peace we slept together
Holding you gently within my arms.

Golden rays fell on my face 
I woke up on my bed.
Morning sun was peeping at me
I came back to myself. 

Setting a trotline after sundown 
if we went far enough away in the night 
sometimes up out of deep water 
would come a secret-headed channel cat, 


Eyes that were still eyes in the rush of darkness, 
flowing feelers noncommittal and black, 
and hidden in the fins those rasping bone daggers, 
with one spiking upward on its back. 


We would come at daylight and find the line sag, 
the fishbelly gleam and the rush on the tether: 
to feel the swerve and the deep current 
which tugged at the tree roots below the river. 

Of sort it animates the scene, 
Like the flapping wings of a bee, 
Like the crimped ridges of the sea, 
Star-likened that has ever been.
Sparking within that clutches me free
To mount within a flight so keen, 
To heart deep it works as the key
Makes me sing as the words I glean.
Sunshine within me it beams is glee.
Love and joy so I dance with sweet, 
Profound so in a sense I feel.
Charmed beauty I delight to meet, 
To me is of sensuous appeal.
I enter poem's depth, to so greet
Me in its world that so did heal
Me of harsh life it did delete, 
Strong for me to sink in a deal
Huge with tenderness truly neat
For love to wax as strong as steel. 

i exist in the depths of solitude
pondering my true goal
trying find peace of mind
and still preserve my soul
constantly yearning be accepted
and from all receive respect
never comprising but sometimes risky
and that is my only regret
a young heart with an old soul
how can there be peace
how can i be in the depths of solitude
when there r inside of me
this duo within me causes
the perfect oppurtunity
learn and live twice as fast
as those who accept simplicity


and  commented my spirit into your holy hands.

In the depths of the night i lifted my hands to you.
In the morning you made me know your love.

You were a rock of refuge for me  in the night.
You released me from the hidden snares of my enemies.


My ears are attentive and i shall never be disappointed.

(as i wrote it, i was very much influenced by the Book of Psalms in the Holy Bible) . 

In the desert 
I saw a creature, naked, bestial, 
who, squatting upon the ground, 
Held his heart in his hands, 
And ate of it. 
I said, "Is it good, friend?" 
"It is bitter -- bitter," he answered; 
"But I like it 
Because it is bitter, 
And because it is my heart

"I'm longing to be sunken 
In the divinity of peace.
I pray You  to  shower Your
Kindness and bliss.


Crossing this earth -
Over a colorful rainbow bridge, 
I step into the unbound, an infinite universe
I dream to be walking in an absolute free state.

With no grief no pain
Being elated with delight, 
A Shapeless, weightless
An  immortal soul I can feel.

O'  Almighty - give me the knowledge
You  enlighten me, 
I am to recognize and  realize  You
To be immersed in your divine love and peace.

Bless my soul with Your divine love
Exposing it to the infinite universe, 
Light up the lamp of wisdom in mine
To realize my soul to be a portion of Thine

light and darkness
merge and unite

In the dream territory of a woman
all things ensue
except for man

In the dream territory of a woman
through the open window
rain enters, and
the breeze teases the curtains

In the dream territory of a woman
night passes on
but never rises the sun; and
there is an endless wait for the morning"Only a pound," said the auctioneer, 
"Only a pound; and I'm standing here 
Selling this animal, gain or loss -- 
Only a pound for the drover's horse? 
One of the sort that was ne'er afraid, 
One of the boys of the Old Brigade; 
Thoroughly honest and game, I'll swear, 
Only a little the worse for wear; 
Plenty as bad to be seen in town, 
Give me a bid and I'll knock him down; 
Sold as he stands, and without recourse, 
Give me a bid for the drover's horse
 


Loitering there in an aimless way 
Somehow I noticed the poor old grey, 
Weary and battered and screwed, of course; 
Yet when I noticed the old grey horse, 
The rough bush saddle, and single rein 
Of the bridle laid on his tangled mane, 
Straighway the crowd and the auctioneer 
Seemed on a sudden to disappear, 
Melted away in a kind if haze -- 
For my heart went back to the droving days. 

Back to the road, and I crossed again 
Over the miles of the saltbush plain -- 
The shining plain that is said to be 
The dried-up bed of an inland sea. 
Where the air so dry and so clear and bright 
Refracts the sun with a wondrous light, 
And out in the dim horizon makes 
The deep blue gleam of the phantom lakes. 

At dawn of day we could feel the breeze 
That stirred the boughs of the sleeping trees, 
And brought a breath of the fragrance rare 
That comes and goes in that scented air; 
For the trees and grass and the shrubs contain 
A dry sweet scent on the saltbush plain. 
for those that love it and understand 
The saltbush plain is a wonderland, 
A wondrous country, were Nature's ways 
Were revealed to me in the droving days. 

We saw the fleet wild horses pass, 
And kangaroos through the Mitchell grass; 
The emu ran with her frightened brood 
All unmolested and unpursued. 
But there rose a shout and a wild hubbub 
When the dingo raced for his native scrub, 
And he paid right dear for his stolen meals 
With the drovers' dogs at his wretched heels. 
For we ran him down at a rattling pace, 
While the pack-horse joined in the stirring chase. 
And a wild halloo at the kill we'd raise -- 
We were light of heart in the droving days. 
'Twas a drover's horse, and my hand again 
Made a move to close on a fancied rein. 
For I felt a swing and the easy stride 
Of the grand old horse that I used to ride. 
In drought or plenty, in good or ill, 
The same old steed was my comrade still; 
The old grey horse with his honest ways 
Was a mate to me in the droving days. 

When we kept our watch in the cold and damp, 
If the cattle broke from the sleeping camp, 
Over the flats and across the plain, 
With my head bent down on his waving mane, 
Through the boughs above and the stumps below, 
On the darkest night I could let him go 
At a racing speed; he would choose his course, 
And my life was safe with the old grey horse. 
But man and horse had a favourite job, 
When an outlaw broke from the station mob; 
With a right good will was the stockwhip plied, 
As the old horse raced at the straggler's side, 
And the greenhide whip such a weal would raise -- 
We could use the whip in the droving days. 

----------------- 

"Only a pound!" and was this the end -- 
Only a pound for the drover's friend. 
The drover's friend that has seen his day, 
And now was worthless and cast away 
With a broken knee and a broken heart 
To be flogged and starved in a hawker's cart. 
Well, I made a bid for a sense of shame 
And the memories of the good old game. 

"Thank you? Guinea! and cheap at that! 
Against you there in the curly hat! 
Only a guinea, and one more chance, 
Down he goes if there's no advance, 
Third, and last time, one! two! three!" 
And the old grey horse was knocked down to me. 
And now he's wandering, fat and sleek, 
On the lucerne flats by the Homestead Creek; 
I dare not ride him for fear he's fall, 
But he does a journey to beat them all, 
For though he scarcely a trot can raise, 
He can take me back to the droving days. 




IN the dusky path of a dream I went to seek the love who was mine in a former life.

Her house stood at the end of a desolate street.
In the evening breeze her pet peacock sat drowsing on its perch, and the pigeons were silent in their corner.

She set her lamp down by the portal and stood before me.
She raised her large eyes to my face and mutely asked, 'Are you well, my friend?'
I tried to answer, but our language had been lost and forgotten.

I thought and thought; our names would not come to my mind.
Tears shone in her eyes. She held up her right hand to me. I took it and stood silent.

Our lamp had flickered in the evening breeze and died. 

Even though when I struggle and grapple
through the ups and downs of life
I will emerge stronger, 
more focused and vital.

In the encounter with pain, 
I am purified, 
emptied
and renewed.

I die only to rise
more hope-filled and grateful. 

It is for us poor that 
We sing different tunes 
Some one may on the way 
Listen while others ignore 
Those whom we freed from the cages 
On others shoulders laughing at us 
The pain of my longing 
When I was shown the way 
For the stars do not 
Make friends on earth 
Deep in heart burned into ashes 
Like red sniper when she aimed my heart 

But of pity never ask as my heart 
Your truth when revealed to you 
Much bitter but be in the illusion 
She once was my love forgone 
So what while leaving 
She did not look back at me 
Never let the stature of the self crumble 
In love were you born like a true lover 
Downcast eyes but your head upstreight 
Is what you possess in the end all alone
ill you loose your sence of fear, 
could you shead another tear? 
Is it possible to let her see, 
exacatly how much you care for me? 

Tell her nothing and tell her lies, 
untill she falls asleep tonight. 
You cry apon your secret shadow, 
knowing he could never tattle. 

She would cry, and she might kill, 
as you turn a sickley ill. 
Falling down a cliff so high, 
just to tell another lie. 

Building up through your head, 
should you tell them both instead? 
One she knows, and the other can't, 
but still you wonder is there a chance? 

As you jump onto your feet, 
feeling down, close to defeat. 
You go into your bathroom shelf, 
and place the gun into your mouth. 

You pull the trigger, sweet relief. 
lies tied up, and put to sleep. 
With a note that explains it all, 
in your hand, when they finaly call. . 

Coverage deciding and yet meaningless.
Who are you but a mere shadow held with little regard.
Still it doesn't stop them from their approach.
These little cockroaches lets crush them.
Here's a million give it to the men with the guns and lets sit back and watch the fun.
For your personal entertainment we proudly present.
More like resent the fact, of being bought.
But of the choices that sit before us what can one do.
A deluge of propaganda and plausible denial-ability.
Responsibility what is that? 
It is not our fault, it is but the squatters of this meagre society.
They bring nothing to table, so we are holding all the cards.
And we will play them as we see fit.
You can't do nothing about it like it or not.
So just watch as we take your home and make you sleep on street like the dog you are.
Money talks, and the poor must walk.
While we drive in prestigious cars.
Maim and marred they aren't even fit sit in our presence without being cleaned up.
Disgusting and homely.
We are so much better then them.
For we stole everything they had without them even taking notice.
Not even a blink of an eye. 
So we don't have to make any compromises.
We've earned every penny by an illusion of a given credit.
So tell me do you regret it

A lion has a tail and a very fine tail
And so has an elephant and so has a whale,
And so has a crocodile, and so has a quail-
They’ve all got tails but me.

If I had sixpence I would buy one;
I’d say to the shopman, ‘Let me try one’;
I’d say to the elephant, ‘This is my one.’
They’d all come round to see.

Then I’d say to the lion, ‘Why, you’ve got a tail!
And so has the elephant, and so has the whale!
And, look! There’s a crocodile! He’s got a
      tail !
You’ve all got tails like me!’I am the stranger at my own gates-
less than rationed
they have torn the wings
off the angels of my countries, 
rivers, suns-

and the dogs with their eyes
like saucers in a tinderbox story*

are staring me down: 
guarding a treasure sifting into dust; 
as I'm turned back from

appalling interviews
and the false floor falls through falls through

falls through

but I remember the rose windows
of the great cathedrals
and whisper the cadence of roses, themselves

like the names of Russian poets.


let me cling like a saint to their iconostatic wind. 

through an ageless winter the red berries
shown above the snow-shrouds

and the poems were bleeding-
in full view of everyone

this precisely crimson shade


And dasheth thee and me apart.
I sweep out seaward: --  be thou brave.
    And reach the shore, Sweetheart.

Beat back the backward-thrusting sea.
Thy weak white arm his blows may thwart,
    Till thou'rt ashore, Sweetheart.

Ah, now thy face grows dim apace,
And seems of yon white foam a part.
Canst hear me through the water-bass,
    Cry:  "To the Shore, Sweetheart?"

My lissome-armed sea-Britomart.
I sweep out seaward, never more
    To find the Shore, Sweetheart. 

In the footsteps of the walking air
Sky's prophetic chickens weave their cloth of awe
And hillsides lift green wings in somber journeying.

Night in his soft haste bumps on the shoulders of the abyss
And a single drop of dark blood covers the earth.

Now is the China of the spirit at walking
In my reaches.
A sable organ sounds in my gathered will
And love's inscrutable skeleton sings.

My seeing moves under a vegetable shroud
And dead forests stand where once Mary stood.

Sullen stone dogs wait in the groves of water . 
Though the wanderer drown, his welfare is as a fire
That burns at the bottom of the sea, warming
Unknown roads for sleep to walk upon. 

HERE, O my heart, let us burn the dear dreams that are dead, 
Here in this wood let us fashion a funeral pyre 
Of fallen white petals and leaves that are mellow and red, 
Here let us burn them in noon's flaming torches of fire. 


We are weary, my heart, we are weary, so long we have borne 
The heavy loved burden of dreams that are dead, let us rest, 
Let us scatter their ashes away, for a while let us mourn; 
We will rest, O my heart, till the shadows are gray in the west. 

But soon we must rise, O my heart, we must wander again 
Into the war of the world and the strife of the throng; 
Let us rise, O my heart, let us gather the dreams that remain, 
We will conquer the sorrow of life with the sorrow of song. 

Out of the mid-wood's twilight
Into the meadow's dawn,
Ivory limbed and brown-eyed,
Flashes my Faun! 

He skips through the copses singing,
And his shadow dances along,
And I know not which I should follow,
Shadow or song! 

O Hunter, snare me his shadow!
O Nightingale, catch me his strain!
Else moonstruck with music and madness
I track him in vain

There is no sadness here. Oh, that my heart
Were calm and peaceful as these dreamy groves!
That all my hopes and passions, and deep loves,
Could sit in such an atmosphere of peace,
Where no unholy impulses would start
Responsive to the throes that never cease
To keep my spirit in such wild unrest.
'Tis only in the struggling human breast
That the true sorrow lives. Our fruitful joys
Have stony kernels hidden in their core.
Life in a myriad phases passeth here,
And death as various-an equal poise;
Yet all is but a solemn change-no more;
And not a sound save joy pervades the atmosphere. 

in the forest of news of the nearly complete devastations
this I pray: you find the fairy tale clearing; 
that you get away from all this

as one poet said, if not one thousand, 
too much for us
somewhere where the far cathedral candles of

the stars will not

burn down the inner landscapes holy; wholly
where you are, on every hand
the kaleidoscopes breaks forth; 

their call not to jeweled alarms
in darkness careening but

only into singing
and Radiance, unforestalled.

results of the sin were great
Cain was of the evil one
his twin Abel, Adam's son

of the fruit did Eve partake
for satan was not a snake
serpent is just a title
hiding of the sin, vital

genealogies do tell
Seth is Adam's son as well
that's why Cain has his own line
tares of the field are their sign

the punishment fit the crime
with much pain at birthing time
bruised heels for The Son of Man
satan's head is future plan

Bird song trilled for those who were listening
What a great afternoon, thought Glenn feeling chipper
A perfect moment to start up his new whipper snipper
 
It purred smoothly in his experienced hands
Trimmed edges effortlessly at the most gentle command
But while promenading proudly around his neat lawn
Glenn spied a dog poo and he wanted it gone
 
It looked dry as dust so he thought he'd attack
With his fearless whipper snipper, just give it a smack
And it would harmlessly splinter and shatter
But it was still moist so it splished and splattered
 
It splattered with power, it splattered with grace
It splattered all over Glenn's spluttering face
Flew up his nostrils, did not want to be wasted
Left him a flavour the worst he'd ever tasted
 
It splattered his T-shirt, it splattered his jeans
It was very much a poo splishing, splattering scene
Poor Glenn hastily switched off the power
And raced indoors for an emergency shower



In the garden of love 
You might have never planted seeds 
But in hundreds in the farthest corners 
Swing in waves the heads of unwanted weeds 

Before they become tall and ugly 
And prevent anything beautiful from flourishing
Feed them not with sweet water 
Check them all before comes the spring 

In your lovely garden 
You might not see any pest with a naked eye 
But in thousands secretly they gather 
And at the roots or under the leaves like a cloud they lie 

Before they become menace
And destroy all the plants before blossoming 
Give them not any chance to spread
Spray insecticides before comes the spring.-for the love of karbis-

Her ivory hands on the ivory keys
Strayed in a fitful fantasy,
Like the silver gleam when the poplar trees
Rustle their pale-leaves listlessly,
Or the drifting foam of a restless sea
When the waves show their teeth in the flying breeze.

Her gold hair fell on the wall of gold
Like the delicate gossamer tangles spun
On the burnished disk of the marigold,
Or the sunflower turning to meet the sun
When the gloom of the dark blue night is done,
And the spear of the lily is aureoled.

And her sweet red lips on these lips of mine
Burned like the ruby fire set
In the swinging lamp of a crimson shrine,
Or the bleeding wounds of the pomegranate,
Or the heart of the lotus drenched and wet
With the spilt-out blood of the rose-red wine. 

O TO lie in long grasses!
O to dream of the plain!
Where the west wind sings as it passes
A weird and unceasing refrain;
Where the rank grass wallows and tosses, 
And the plains’ ring dazzles the eye;
Where hardly a silver cloud bosses
The flashing steel arch of the sky.

To watch the gay gulls as they flutter
Like snowflakes and fall down the sky, 
To swoop in the deeps of the hollows,
Where the crow’s-foot tosses awry,
And gnats in the lee of the thickets
Are swirling like waltzers in glee
To the harsh, shrill creak of the crickets, 
And the song of the lark and the bee.

O far-off plains of my west land!
O lands of winds and the free,
Swift deer—my mist-clad plain!
From my bed in the heart of the forest, 
From the clasp and the girdle of pain
Your light through my darkness passes;
To your meadows in dreaming I fly
To plunge in the deeps of your grasses,
To bask in the light of your sky

I.
            In the greenest of our valleys,
              By good angels tenanted,
            Once fair and stately palace --
              Radiant palace --reared its head.
            In the monarch Thought's dominion --
              It stood there!
            Never seraph spread a pinion
              Over fabric half so fair.

                            II.
            Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
              On its roof did float and flow;
            (This --all this --was in the olden
              Time long ago)
            And every gentle air that dallied,
              In that sweet day,
            Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
              A winged odour went away.

                           III.
            Wanderers in that happy valley
              Through two luminous windows saw
            Spirits moving musically
              To a lute's well-tuned law,
            Round about a throne, where sitting
              (Porphyrogene!)
            In state his glory well befitting,
              The ruler of the realm was seen.

                            IV.
            And all with pearl and ruby glowing
              Was the fair palace door,
            Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing
              And sparkling evermore,
            A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty
              Was but to sing,
            In voices of surpassing beauty,
              The wit and wisdom of their king.

                             V.
            But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
              Assailed the monarch's high estate;
            (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow
              Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)
            And, round about his home, the glory
              That blushed and bloomed
            Is but a dim-remembered story
              Of the old time entombed.

                            VI.
            And travellers now within that valley,
              Through the red-litten windows, see
            Vast forms that move fantastically
              To a discordant melody;
            While, like a rapid ghastly river,
              Through the pale door,
            A hideous throng rush out forever,
              And laugh --but smile no more. 

As one who long hath fled with panting breath
Before his foe, bleeding and near to fall,
I turn and set my back against the wall,
And look thee in the face, triumphant Death,
I call for aid, and no one answereth;
I am alone with thee, who conquerest all;
Yet me thy threatening form doth not appall,
For thou art but a phantom and a wraith.
Wounded and weak, sword broken at the hilt,
With armor shattered, and without a shield,
I stand unmoved; do with me what thou wilt;
I can resist no more, but will not yield.
This is no tournament where cowards tilt;
The vanquished here is victor of the field. 

Awake! arise! the hour is late!
Angels are knocking at thy door!
They are in haste and cannot wait,
And once departed come no more. 

Awake! arise! the athlete's arm
Loses its strength by too much rest;
The fallow land, the untilled farm
Produces only weeds at best. 

As treasures that men seek,
Deep buried in sea-sands,
Vanish if they but speak,
And elude their eager hands,

So ye escape and slip,
O songs, and fade away,
When the word is on my lip
To interpret what ye say.

Were it not better, then,
To let the treasures rest
Hid from the eyes of men,
Locked in their iron chest?

I have but marked the place,
But half the secret told,
That, following this slight trace,
Others may find the gold. 

The summer sun is sinking low;
Only the tree-tops redden and glow:
Only the weathercock on the spire
Of the neighboring church is a flame of fire;
All is in shadow below. 

O beautiful, awful summer day,
What hast thou given, what taken away?
Life and death, and love and hate,
Homes made happy or desolate,
Hearts made sad or gay! 

On the road of life one mile-stone more!
In the book of life one leaf turned o'er!
Like a red seal is the setting sun
On the good and the evil men have done,--
Naught can to-day restore

I.
What is this I read in history,
Full of marvel, full of mystery,
Difficult to understand?
Is it fiction, is it truth?
Children in the flower of youth,
Heart in heart, and hand in hand,
Ignorant of what helps or harms,
Without armor, without arms,
Journeying to the Holy Land! 

Who shall answer or divine?
Never since the world was made
Such a wonderful crusade
Started forth for Palestine.
Never while the world shall last
Will it reproduce the past;
Never will it see again
Such an army, such a band,
Over mountain, over main,
Journeying to the Holy Land. 

Like a shower of blossoms blown
From the parent trees were they;
Like a flock of birds that fly
Through the unfrequented sky,
Holding nothing as their own,
Passed they into lands unknown,
Passed to suffer and to die. 

O the simple, child-like trust!
O the faith that could believe
What the harnessed, iron-mailed
By their prowess, to achieve,
They, the children, could and must!

Little thought the Hermit, preaching
Holy Wars to knight and baron,
That the words dropped in his teaching,
His entreaty, his beseeching,
Would by children's hands be gleaned,
And the staff on which he leaned
Blossom like the rod of Aaron. 

As a summer wind upheaves
The innumerable leaves
In the bosom of a wood,--
Not as separate leaves, but massed
All together by the blast,--
So for evil or for good
His resistless breath upheaved
All at once the many-leaved,
Many-thoughted multitude. 

In the tumult of the air
Rock the boughs with all the nests
Cradled on their tossing crests;
By the fervor of his prayer
Troubled hearts were everywhere
Rocked and tossed in human breasts. 

For a century, at least,
His prophetic voice had ceased;
But the air was heated still
By his lurid words and will,
As from fires in far-off woods,
In the autumn of the year,
An unwonted fever broods
In the sultry atmosphere. 

II.
In Cologne the bells were ringing,
In Cologne the nuns were singing
Hymns and canticles divine;
Loud the monks sang in their stalls,
And the thronging streets were loud
With the voices of the crowd;--
Underneath the city walls
Silent flowed the river Rhine. 

From the gates, that summer day,
Clad in robes of hodden gray,
With the red cross on the breast,
Azure-eyed and golden-haired,
Forth the young crusaders fared;
While above the band devoted
Consecrated banners floated,
Fluttered many a flag and streamer,
And the cross o'er all the rest!
Singing lowly, meekly, slowly,
'Give us, give us back the holy
Sepulchre of the Redeemer!'
On the vast procession pressed,
Youths and maidens


III.
Ah! what master hand shall paint
How they journeyed on their way,
How the days grew long and dreary,
How their little feet grew weary,
How their little hearts grew faint! 

Ever swifter day by day
Flowed the homeward river; ever
More and more its whitening current
Broke and scattered into spray,
Till the calmly-flowing river
Changed into a mountain torrent,
Rushing from its glacier green
Down through chasm and black ravine.

Like a phoenix in its nest,
Burned the red sun in the West,
Sinking in an ashen cloud;
In the East, above the crest
Of the sea-like mountain chain,
Like a phoenix from its shroud,
Came the red sun back again. 

Now around them, white with snow,
Closed the mountain peaks. Below,
Headlong from the precipice
Down into the dark abyss,
Plunged the cataract, white with foam;
And it said, or seemed to say:
'Oh return, while yet you may,
Foolish children, to your home,
There the Holy City is!' 

But the dauntless leader said:
'Faint not, though your bleeding feet
O'er these slippery paths of sleet
Move but painfully and slowly;
Other feet than yours have bled;
Other tears than yours been shed
Courage! lose not heart or hope;
On the mountains' southern slope
Lies Jerusalem the Holy!' 
As a white rose in its pride,
By the wind in summer-tide
Tossed and loosened from the branch,
Showers its petals o'er the ground,
From the distant mountain's side,
Scattering all its snows around,
With mysterious, muffled sound,
Loosened, fell the avalanche.
Voices, echoes far and near,
Roar of winds and waters blending,
Mists uprising, clouds impending,
Filled them with a sense of fear,
Formless, nameless, never ending. 
* * * * * * * * * * * *The panting City cried to the Sea,
'I am faint with heat,--O breathe on me!' 

And the Sea said, 'Lo, I breathe! but my breath
To some will be life, to others death!' 

As to Prometheus, bringing ease
In pain, come the Oceanides, 

So to the City, hot with the flame
Of the pitiless sun, the east wind came. 

It came from the heaving breast of the deep,
Silent as dreams are, and sudden as sleep. 

Life-giving, death-giving, which will it be;
O breath of the merciful, merciless Sea

Four limpid lakes,--four Naiades
Or sylvan deities are these,
In flowing robes of azure dressed;
Four lovely handmaids, that uphold
Their shining mirrors, rimmed with gold,
To the fair city in the West. 

By day the coursers of the sun
Drink of these waters as they run
Their swift diurnal round on high;
By night the constellations glow
Far down the hollow deeps below,
And glimmer in another sky. 

Fair lakes, serene and full of light,
Fair town, arrayed in robes of white,
How visionary ye appear!
All like a floating landscape seems
In cloud-land or the land of dreams,
Bathed in a golden atmosphere

JANUARY 

Janus am I; oldest of potentates;
Forward I look, and backward, and below
I count, as god of avenues and gates,
The years that through my portals come and go.

I block the roads, and drift the fields with snow;
I chase the wild-fowl from the frozen fen;
My frosts congeal the rivers in their flow,
My fires light up the hearths and hearts of men. 


FEBRUARY 

I am lustration, and the sea is mine!
I wash the sands and headlands with my tide;
My brow is crowned with branches of the pine;
Before my chariot-wheels the fishes glide.
By me all things unclean are purified,
By me the souls of men washed white again;
E'en the unlovely tombs of those who died
Without a dirge, I cleanse from every stain. 


MARCH 

I Martius am! Once first, and now the third!
To lead the Year was my appointed place;
A mortal dispossessed me by a word,
And set there Janus with the double face.
Hence I make war on all the human race;
I shake the cities with my hurricanes;
I flood the rivers and their banks efface,
And drown the farms and hamlets with my rains. 


APRIL 

I open wide the portals of the Spring
To welcome the procession of the flowers,
With their gay banners, and the birds that sing
Their song of songs from their aerial towers.
I soften with my sunshine and my showers
The heart of earth; with thoughts of love I glide
Into the hearts of men; and with the Hours
Upon the Bull with wreathed horns I ride. 


MAY 

Hark! The sea-faring wild-fowl loud proclaim
My coming, and the swarming of the bees.
These are my heralds, and behold! my name
Is written in blossoms on the hawthorn-trees.
I tell the mariner when to sail the seas;
I waft o'er all the land from far away
The breath and bloom of the Hesperides,
My birthplace. I am Maia. I am May. 


JUNE 

Mine is the Month of Roses; yes, and mine
The Month of Marriages! All pleasant sights
And scents, the fragrance of the blossoming vine,
The foliage of the valleys and the heights.
Mine are the longest days, the loveliest nights;
The mower's scythe makes music to my ear;
I am the mother of all dear delights;
I am the fairest daughter of the year. 


JULY 

My emblem is the Lion, and I breathe
The breath of Libyan deserts o'er the land;
My sickle as a sabre I unsheathe,
And bent before me the pale harvests stand.
The lakes and rivers shrink at my command,
And there is thirst and fever in the air;
The sky is changed to brass, the earth to sand;
I am the Emperor whose name I bear. 


AUGUST 

The Emperor Octavian, called the August,
I being his favorite, bestowed his name
Upon me, and I hold it still in trust,
In memory of him and of his fame.
I am the Virgin, and my vestal flame
Burns less intensely than the Lion's rage;
Sheaves are my only garlands, and I claim
The golden Harvests as my heritage. 


SEPTEMBER 

I bear the Scales, where hang in equipoise
The night and day; and when unto my lips
I put my trumpet, with its stress and noise
Fly the white clouds like tattered sails of ships;
The tree-tops lash the air with sounding whips;
Southward the clamorous sea-fowl wing their flight;
The hedges are all red with haws and hips,
The Hunter's Moon reigns empress of the night. 


OCTOBER 

My ornaments are fruits; my garments leaves,
Woven like cloth of gold, and crimson dyed;
I do not boast the harvesting of sheaves,
O'er orchards and o'er vineyards I preside.
Though on the frigid Scorpion I ride,
The dreamy air is full, and overflows
With tender memories of the summer-tide,
And mingled voices of the doves and crows. 

NOVEMBER 

The Centaur, Sagittarius, am I,
Born of Ixion's and the cloud's embrace;
With sounding hoofs across the earth I fly,
A steed Thessalian with a human face.
Sharp winds the arrows are with which I chase
The leaves, half dead already with affright;
I shroud myself in gloom; and to the race
Of mortals bring nor comfort nor delight. 


DECEMBER 

Riding upon the Goat, with snow-white hair,
I come, the last of all. This crown of mine
Is of the holly; in my hand I bear
The thyrsus, tipped with fragrant cones of pine.
I celebrate the birth of the Divine,
And the return of the Saturnian reign;--
My songs are carols sung at every shrine.
Proclaiming 'Peace on earth, good will to men.

'Little sweet wine of Jurançon, 
You are dear to my memory still! 
With mine host and his merry song, 
Under the rose-tree I drank my fill. 

Twenty years after, passing that way, 
Under the trellis I found again 
Mine host, still sitting there au frais, 
And singing still the same refrain. 

The Jurançon, so fresh and bold, 
Treats me as one it used to know; 
Souvenirs of the days of old 
Already from the bottle flow, 

With glass in hand our glances met; 
We pledge, we drink. How sour it is 
Never Argenteuil piquette 
Was to my palate sour as this! 

And yet the vintage was good, in sooth; 
The self-same juice, the self-same cask! 
It was you, O gayety of my youth, 
That failed in the autumnal flask

Flow on, sweet river! like his verse
Who lies beneath this sculptured hearse;
Nor wait beside the churchyard wall
For him who cannot hear thy call. 

Thy playmate once; I see him now
A boy with sunshine on his brow,
And hear in Stratford's quiet street
The patter of his little feet. 

I see him by thy shallow edge
Wading knee-deep amid the sedge;
And lost in thought, as if thy stream
Were the swift river of a dream. 

He wonders whitherward it flows;
And fain would follow where it goes,
To the wide world, that shall erelong
Be filled with his melodious song. 

Flow on, fair stream! That dream is o'er;
He stands upon another shore;
A vaster river near him flows,
And still he follows where it goes. 

Have you seen Amanda Blaine in the hills of Shiloh
Wandering through the morning rain through the hills of Shiloh
Have you seen her at her door, listening for the cannon's roar
And a man who went to war from the hills of Shiloh

Have you heard her mournful cries in the hills of Shiloh
Have you seen her haunted eyes in the hills of Shiloh
Have you seen her running down searching through the sleeping
town
In her yellowed wedding gown in the hills of Shiloh

Have you seen her standing there in the hills of Shiloh
Wind a blowing through her hair in the hills of Shiloh
Listening for the sound of guns listening for the rolling drums
And a man who never comes to the hills of Shiloh

Have you heard Amanda sing in the hills of Shiloh
Whispering to her wedding ring in the hills of Shiloh
Hear her humming soft and low, poor Amanda doesn't know
'Twas ended forty years ago in the hills of Shiloh


SHE stood against the kitchen sink, and looked
Over the sink out through a dusty window
At weeds the water from the sink made tall.
She wore her cape; her hat was in her hand.
Behind her was confusion in the room,
Of chairs turned upside down to sit like people
In other chairs, and something, come to look,
For every room a house has—parlor, bed-room,
And dining-room—thrown pell-mell in the kitchen.
And now and then a smudged, infernal face
Looked in a door behind her and addressed
Her back. She always answered without turning.

"Where will I put this walnut bureau, lady?"
"Put it on top of something that's on top
Of something else," she laughed. "Oh, put it where
You can to-night, and go. It's almost dark;
You must be getting started back to town

"
Another blackened face thrust in and looked
And smiled, and when she did not turn, spoke gently,
"What are you seeing out the window, lady?"

"Never was I beladied so before.
Would evidence of having been called lady
More than so many times make me a lady
In common law, I wonder


"But I ask,
What are you seeing out the window, lady?"

"What I'll be seeing more of in the years
To come as here I stand and go the round
Of many plates with towels many times


"And what is that? You only put me off


"Rank weeds that love the water from the dish-pan
More than some women like the dish-pan, Joe;
A little stretch of mowing-field for you;
Not much of that until I come to woods
That end all. And it's scarce enough to call
A view


"And yet you think you like it, dear?"

"That's what you're so concerned to know! You hope
I like it. Bang goes something big away
Off there upstairs. The very tread of men
As great as those is shattering to the frame
Of such a little house. Once left alone,
You and I, dear, will go with softer steps
Up and down stairs and through the rooms, and none
But sudden winds that snatch them from our hands
Will ever slam the doors


"I think you see
More than you like to own to out that window


"No; for besides the things I tell you of,
I only see the years. They come and go
In alternation with the weeds, the field,
The wood


"What kind of years?"
"Why, latter years—
Different from early years

"
"I see them, too.
You didn't count them?"
"No, the further off
So ran together that I didn't try to.
It can scarce be that they would be in number
We'd care to know, for we are not young now.
And bang goes something else away off there.
It sounds as if it were the men went down,
And every crash meant one less to return
To lighted city streets we, too, have known,
But now are giving up for country darkness


"Come from that window where you see too much for me,
And take a livelier view of things from here.
They're going. Watch this husky swarming up
Over the wheel into the sky-high seat,
Lighting his pipe now, squinting down his nose
At the flame burning downward as he sucks it


"See how it makes his nose-side bright, a proof
How dark it's getting. Can you tell what time
It is by that? Or by the moon? The new moon!
What shoulder did I see her over? Neither.
A wire she is of silver, as new as we
To everything. Her light won't last us long.
It's something, though, to know we're going to have her
Night after night and stronger every night
To see us through our first two weeks. But, Joe,
The stove! Before they go! Knock on the window;
Ask them to help you get it on its feet.
We stand here dreaming. Hurry! Call them back!"

"They're not gone yet


"We've got to have the stove,
Whatever else we want for. And a light.
Have we a piece of candle if the lamp
And oil are buried out of reach?"
Again
The house was full of tramping, and the dark,
Door-filling men burst in and seized the stove.
A cannon-mouth-like hole was in the wall,
To which they set it true by eye; and then
Came up the jointed stovepipe in their hands,
So much too light and airy for their strength
It almost seemed to come ballooning up,
Slipping from clumsy clutches toward the ceiling.
"A fit!" said one, and banged a stovepipe shoulder.
"It's good luck when you move in to begin
With good luck with your stovepipe. Never mind,
It's not so bad in the country, settled down,
When people 're getting on in life, You'll like it

"
Joe said: "You big boys ought to find a farm,
And make good farmers, and leave other fellows
The city work to do. There's not enough
For everybody as it is in there

"
"Say that to Jimmy here. He needs a farm

"
But Jimmy only made his jaw recede
Fool-like, and rolled his eyes as if to say
He saw himself a farmer. Then there was a French boy
Who said with seriousness that made them laugh,
"Ma friend, you ain't know what it is you're ask

"
He doffed his cap and held it with both hands
Across his chest to make as 'twere a bow:
"We're giving you our chances on de farm

"
And then they all turned to with deafening boots
And put each other bodily out of the house.
"Goodby to them! We puzzle them. They think—
I don't know what they think we see in what
They leave us to: that pasture slope that seems
The back some farm presents us; and your woods
To northward from your window at the sink,
Waiting to steal a step on us whenever
We drop our eyes or turn to other things,
As in the game ‘Ten-step' the children play


"Good boys they seemed, and let them love the city.
Their coming out and making useful farmers


"Did they make something lonesome go through you?
It would take more than them to sicken you—
Us of our bargain. But they left us so
As to our fate, like fools past reasoning with.
They almost shook me


"It's all so much
What we have always wanted, I confess
It's seeming bad for a moment makes it seem
Even worse still, and so on down, down, down.
It's nothing; it's their leaving us at dusk.
I never bore it well when people went.
The first night after guests have gone, the house
Seems haunted or exposed. I always take
A personal interest in the locking up
At bedtime; but the strangeness soon wears off

"
He fetched a dingy lantern from behind
A door. "There's that we didn't lose! And these!"—
Some matches he unpocketed. "For food—
The meals we've had no one can take from us.
I wish that everything on earth were just
As certain as the meals we've had. I wish
The meals we haven't had were, anyway.
What have you you know where to lay your hands on?"

"The bread we bought in passing at the store.
There's butter somewhere, too


"Let's rend the bread.
I'll light the fire for company for you;
You'll not have any other company
Till Ed begins to get out on a Sunday
To look us over and give us his idea
Of what wants pruning, shingling, breaking up.
He'll know what he would do if he were we,
And all at once. He'll plan for us and plan
To help us, but he'll take it out in planning.
Well, you can set the table with the loaf.
Let's see you find your loaf. I'll light the fire.
I like chairs occupying other chairs
Not offering a lady—"

"There again, Joe!
You're tired


"I'm drunk-nonsensical tired out;
Don't mind a word I say. It's a day's work
To empty one house of all household goods
And fill another with 'em fifteen miles away,
Although you do no more than dump them down


"Dumped down in paradise we are and happy


"It's all so much what I have always wanted,
I can't believe it's what you wanted, too


"Shouldn't you like to know?"

"I'd like to know
If it is what you wanted, then how much
You wanted it for me


"A troubled conscience!
You don't want me to tell if I don't know


"I don't want to find out what can't be known.

But who first said the word to come?"

"My dear,
It's who first thought the thought. You're searching, Joe,
For things that don't exist; I mean beginnings.
Ends and beginnings—there are no such things.
There are only middles


"What is this?"
"This life?
Our sitting here by lantern-light together
Amid the wreckage of a former home?
You won't deny the lantern isn't new.
The stove is not, and you are not to me,
Nor I to you


"Perhaps you never were?"

"It would take me forever to recite
All that's not new in where we find ourselves.
New is a word for fools in towns who think
Style upon style in dress and thought at last
Must get somewhere. I've heard you say as much.
No, this is no beginning


"Then an end?"

"End is a gloomy word

"
"Is it too late
To drag you out for just a good-night call
On the old peach trees on the knoll to grope
By starlight in the grass for a last peach
The neighbors may not have taken as their right
When the house wasn't lived in? I've been looking:
I doubt if they have left us many grapes.
Before we set ourselves to right the house,
The first thing in the morning, out we go
To go the round of apple, cherry, peach,
Pine, alder, pasture, mowing, well, and brook.
All of a farm it is


"I know this much:
I'm going to put you in your bed, if first
I have to make you build it. Come, the light


When there was no more lantern in the kitchen,
The fire got out through crs in the stove
And danced in yellow wrigglers on the ceiling,
As much at home as if they'd always danced there. 

Here, in the rooms
of my childhood

I, an adult now

walk through memory
made real again

amazed at how small
the Past is
(to my Present self)  

I thought these rooms
immense

& now they shrink
before my shadow

climbing the stairs

the shadow of
 my footfall

this old house
no longer mine
(except in my mind)  

echoing with footsteps

as I walk
through my tears

& see the dead arise
To greet me

as if they were not
dead

& how
they exist

inside me

living still
as my beating heart

these walls once knew me
& still remember me

as they touch my fingertips
touching them

(almost believing)  

that the opening door
will still bring

me

you.


(For Brian. ’cos he knows)A stone's throw out on either hand
From that well-ordered road we tread,
And all the world is wild and strange;
Churel and ghoul and Djinn and sprite
Shall bear us company to-night,
For we have reached the Oldest Land
Wherein the powers of Darkness range. 

Greed's belongings, possessions
in bits and pieces of  crashed arrogance
escaped fugitives never back to come, 
wealth rushly spent into the air tο waft.
Left stubble on open plain
harsh wind's  defenceless  prey? 


It does not worth it over to cry.
Wish them farewell and let them fly.
No matter to world's  billions of humans   
what you are thinking of them or even yourself.
It only effects those whom your affinity concerns, 
everyone and everything that you during life surround, 
even the immigrant bird in your yard heavily snowbound, 
the hungry dog, the crippled cat, your mercy's  supplicants.

Leaves cast by wind
soar but fall  at  the end, to become, 
withered, wizened, earth soil's part.
You have not to loose heart 
deprived  of things  esteemed so much.
Very feathery leaves are they, as  are we.

Be to the trees and flowers of your yard
generous  in your new Spring it is to come.
Carefully dig the soil around, water them, prune, 
share the delight  in their  flourishing bloom
enjoy the fragrance, wait the  fruit.
Your heart's caring will make you feel  at last, 
hearing the flattering trill 
and content rustling at your yard, 
that you take pleasure in what you sorely lacked
when plunged in wealth's
arrogant abundance: 
In the Ηuman
Εssence. 

i saw my face vibrate  in the light of the water
and knew the Divine was waving back at me pleased 
that i am enjoying his agent of cleanliness, his freshness
i smiled to myself and knew that there was  more to me than meet
the eye, that the divine was too looking at me through this image
i heard my echo in the mountains and knew the Divine had rolled 
back the question whether I knew who i actually was
i cocked my ears knowing there was  more to sound than 
drumming up the ear and found a spiritual self coming from 
afar  to anchor himself in the heart


Whilst walking on shank’s mare 
With feet naked of shoes of care 
I traversed through 
jungle of life 

Wherein soothes the breeze of happiness 
and torments the tornado of strife. 
I rested under the leafy tree of love 
standing at friendship’s gates. 
I watered the plant shriveled 
by the scorching sunbeams of hate 

Therein I met the ravenous wolves 
Who plots and savors your fall, 
And the cunning foxes who 
whispers the deceiving calls. 

I saw the lions of terror 
reveling in the pool of blood, 
I saw the doves of peace 
helping the sorrow hit birds. 

I chanced upon the angels 
with the eyes akin to doe, 
And wondered at the earthlings 
bereft of ill wishers and foes. 

Whilst plucking the flower of love 
I was hurt by the thorns of hate 
While drinking the water of life 
I was dragged by the currents of fate. 

Now I know 
Be friend or foe, 
With whom we meet 
fight, love and depart.





Long ago in the kingdom of Glutendom
lived a wise King who sat on a golden throne.
He had a bit of bad luck, when his Kingly butt did get stuck
From eatting nothing but chocolate Ice cream and scones! 

He called for his baker and the royal candle stick maker.
'Have you got any goose fat or lard? '
They both looked at one another, than took off for cover
for they knew removing the King from his throne would be hard.

The King called for his prize royal bacon 
then began to rub it, on his arms and his sides.
He called for his scribes to rub this grease on his thighs
then soon popped out, with his Kingly blubber shakin.

'While I'm the wisest of King throughout the world
how could I have let myself get this way? '
To eat like I do, ice cream and all those scones too
I decree that no one will go on eatting this way! 

As the king tried to sit down and placeback his crown 
he'd forgotten the bacon grease on his chair.
He began to slip and slide, from side to side.
Like a large bowl of jiggly jell-o and squid.
 
For the King was all blubber and jiggly
and his throne did keep that fat in tact.
But when he got up, from his throne he was stuck
all could then see he was nothing but FAT

the cream of words that frothed the rim of
poetry gone by poured into the sleeping village overnight, 

the lowest ones with the last of the icicles flung and shining
unheard in the household the emerald lantern flashed and
clicked the train on its tracks, the ruby eyed

and the blue doves on the trees fluttering arise, arise
and the dolls woke up in their wrappings fluttering their
dolly lashes, the Florida oranges bursting into orangeade

in the kitchen, the steaming coffee made poured into the china cupswith the little  rosebuds and the large rolls
decked with cinnamon kingdoms iced themselves.

real blueberries in the muffins, this time just as the blueberries in the summer rhymes when you are counting clouds or stars or islands and fingering your necklaces of 

coral of the improvident jade
and have huckleberry pie for dinner followed by cold chicken
and a sudden picnic of pink cake under a pinker sky

raspberry lemonade at the party with the candycorn theme.

all Holidays are one sighed my sister and I telling our favorite story again, and should the Princess sprinkle the sugar
herself on the strawberries? 

rolled into a huge Snowball of fun
and flattening the dough with a  rainbow gemmed rolling
pin and the little dog laughed behind the rose divan

since that's where the Danish wedding cookies crumbled. 

The People are red white and blue,
They never blow noses,
Or ever wear closes,
What a sensible thing to do!

In the land of the Bumbley Boo
You can buy Lemon pie at the zoo;
They give away foxes
In little Pink Boxes
And Bottles of Dandylion Stew.

In the land of the Bumbley Boo
You never see a Gnu,
But thousands of cats
Wearing trousers and hats
Made of Pumpkins and Pelican Glue!


Chorus
Oh, the Bumbley Boo! the Bumbley Boo!
That's the place for me and you!
So hurry! Let's run!
The train leaves at one!
For the land of the Bumbley Boo!
The wonderful Bumbley Boo-Boo-Boo!
The Wonderful Bumbley BOO!!

In the long run fame finds the deserving man. 
The lucky wight may prosper for a day, 
But in good time true merit leads the van, 
And vain pretense, unnoticed, goes its way. 
There is no Chance, no Destiny, no Fate, 
But Fortune smiles on those who work and wait, 
In the long run.

In the long run all goodly sorrow pays, 
There is no better thing than righteous pain, 
The sleepless nights, the awful thorn-crowned days, 
Bring sure reward to tortured soul and brain. 
Unmeaning joys enervate in the end, 
But sorrow yields a glorious dividend 
In the long run.

In the long run all hidden things are known, 
The eye of truth will penetrate the night, 
And good or ill, thy secret shall be known, 
However well 't is guarded from the light. 
All the unspoken motives of the breast 
Are fathomed by the years and stand confest 
In the long run.

In the long run all love is paid by love, 
Though undervalued by the hosts of earth; 
The great eternal Governemnt above 
Keeps strict account and will redeem its worth. 
Give thy love freely; do not count the cost; 
So beautiful a thing was never lost 
In the long run. 

in the looking glass, it began to snow

the snow covered up
your eyes your
mouth; your

hands, with their own
snow-like gestures; 
you wept-

but not into

the frozen-mirror pond

we struggled through: 
emerging into
deeper snows, 

but with the same furniture-

and this was the
beginning of sorrows

In bronze with little flecks of gold— 
O royal lady, lift your hand, 
Shatter the stone museum cold, 

The wide Nile sleeps, the desert stings 
With color. Shake your tresses free, 
The sleepy lotus shines and swings— 
Loose your bound limbs and sail with me 
In a smooth shallop to the sea, 

So delicate, yet cold as snow, 
An ice-wind, boldly resolute,
Rippled your thin robe long ago,
And froze you into bronze—I know—
But left your garment's flecks of gold
And the slim grace men loved of old,

On Pelion among the chestnut trees the Centaur's shirt
slipped through the leaves to fold around my body
as I climbed the slope and the sea came after me
climbing too like mercury in a thermometer till we found the mountain waters.
On Santorini touching islands that were sinking
hearing a pipe play somewhere on the pumice stone
my hand was nailed to the gunwale by an arrow shot suddenly
from the confines of a vanished youth.
At Mycenae I raised the great stones and the treasures of the house of Atreus
and slept with them at the hotel 'Belle Helene de Menelas'; 
they disappeared only at dawn when Cassandra crowed, 
a cock hanging from her black throat.
On Spetses, Poros, and Mykonos the barcaroles sickened me. 

What do they want, all those who say they're in Athens or Piraeus? 
Someone comes from Salamis and asks someone else whether
he 'originates from Omonia Square? '
'No, I originate from Syntagma, ' replies the other, pleased; 
'I met Yianni and he treated me to an ice cream.'
Meanwhile Greece is travelling
and we don't know anything, we don't know we're all sailors out of work, 
we don't know how bitter the port becomes when all the ships have gone; 
we mock those who do know. 

Strange people! they say they're in Attica but they're really nowhere; 
they buy sugared almonds to get married
they carry hair tonic, have their photographs taken
the man I saw today sitting against a background of pigeons and flowers
let the hands of the old photographer smoothe away the
wrinkles left on his face by all the birds in the sky. 

Meanwhile Greece goes on travelling, always travelling
and if we see 'the Aegean flower with corpses'
it will be with those who tried to catch the big ship by swimming after it
those who got bored waiting for the ships that cannot move
the ELSI, the SAMOTHRAKI, the AMVRAKIKOS.
The ships hoot now that dusk falls on Piraeus, hoot and hoot, but no capstan moves, 
no chain gleams wet in the vanishing light, 
the captain stands like a stone in white and gold. 

Wherever I travel Greece wounds me, 
curtains of mountains, archipelagos, naked granite.
They call the one ship that sails AGONY  

O peace, that on a lilied bank dost love
To rest thine head beneath an olive tree,
I would that from the pinions of thy dove
One quill withouten pain yplucked might be!
For oh! I wish my Sara's frowns to flee,
And faint to her some soothing song would write,
Lest she resent my rude discourtesy,
Who vowed to meet her ere the morning light,
But broke my plighted word -- ah! false and recreant wight.

Last night as I my weary head did pillow
With thoughts of my dissevered fair engrossed,
Chill fancy drooped, wreathing herself with willow,
As tho' my breast entombed a pining ghost.
'From some blest couch, young rapture's bridal boast,
Rejected slumber! hither wing thy way;
But leave me with the matin hour, at most!'
As night-closed floweret to the orient ray,
My sad heart will expand, when I the maid survey.

But Love, who 'heard the silence of my thought,'
Contrived a too successful wile, I ween:
And whispered to himself, with malice fraught--
'Too long our slave the damsel's smiles hath seen:
To-morrow shall he ken her altered mien!'
He spake, and ambushed lay, till on my bed
The morning shot her dewy glances keen,
When as I 'gan uplift my drowsy head--
'Now, bard! I'll work thee woe!' the laughing elfin said.

Sleep, softly-breathing god! his downy wing
Was fluttering now, as quickly to depart;
When twanged an arrow from Love's mystic string,
With pathless wound it pierced him to the heart.
Was there some magic in the elfin's dart?
Or did he strike my couch with wizard lance?
For straight so fair a form did upwards start
(No fairer deck'd the bowers of old romance)
That sleep enamoured grew, nor moved from his sweet trance!

My Sara came, with gentlest look divine;
Bright shone her eye, yet tender was its beam
I felt the pressure of her lip to mine!
Whisp'ring we went, and love was all our theme--
Love pure and spotless, as at first, I deem,
He sprang from heaven! Such joys with sleep did 'bide
That I the living image of my dream
Fondly forgot. Too late I woke, and sighed -- 
'O! how shall I behold my love at even-tide!


'Beginning to dangle beneath 
The wind that blows from the undermined wood, 
I feel the great pulley grind, 


The thread I cling to lengthen 
And let me soaring and spinning down into marble, 
Hooked and weightlessly happy 


Where the squared sun shines 
Back equally from all four sides, out of stone 
And years of dazzling labor, 


To land at last among men 
Who cut with power saws a Parian whiteness 
And, chewing slow tobacco, 


Their eyebrows like frost, 
Shunt house-sized blocks and lash them to cables 
And send them heavenward 


Into small-town banks, 
Into the columns and statues of government buildings, 
But mostly graves. 


I mount my monument and rise 
Slowly and spinningly from the white-gloved men 
Toward the hewn sky 


Out of the basement of light, 
Sadly, lifted through time’s blinding layers 
On perhaps my tombstone 


In which the original shape 
Michelangelo believed was in every rock upon earth 
Is heavily stirring, 


Surprised to be an angel, 
To be waked in North Georgia by the ponderous play 
Of men with ten-ton blocks 


But no more surprised than I 
To feel sadness fall off as though I myself 
Were rising from stone 


Held by a thread in midair, 
Badly cut, local-looking, and totally uninspired, 
Not a masterwork 


Or even worth seeing at all 
But the spirit of this place just the same, 
Felt here as joy. 

in the margins of Song we will live
like the small birds after the rains
chirping near the puddles on the pavement

drinking the clouds.
how can I say outloud what I feel
in the public wayfares 

the heart could be stone
that listens there
the heart could be stone

write anywhere.
write on the pages of the sun
though like icarus you melt

into the uncomprehending sea.
write yourself into the music: 
liberty.

The helmsman dare not look behind,
But hears beyond his compass-light,
The blind bow thunder through the night,
And, like a harpstring ere it snaps,
The rigging sing beneath the caps;
Above the shriek of storm in sail
Or rattle of the blocks blown free,
Set for the peace beyond the gale,
This song the Needle sings the Sea;


Oh, drunken Wave! Oh, driving Cloud!
Rage of the Deep and sterile Rain,
We go, but we return again!

When leagued about the 'wildered boat
The rainbow Jellies fill and float,
And, lilting where the laver lingers,
The Starfish trips on all her fingers;
Where, 'neath his myriad spines ashock,
The Sea-egg ripples down the rock,
An orange wonder dimly guessed
From darkness where the Cuttles rest,
Moored o'er the darker deeps that hide
The blind white Sea-snake and his bride,
Who, drowsing, nose the long-lost Ships
Let down through darkness to their lips --
Safe-swung above the glassy death,
Hear what the constant Needle saith:


Oh, lisping Reef! Oh, listless Cloud,
In slumber on a pulseless main!
We go, but we return again!

E'en so through Tropic and through Trade,
Awed by the shadow of new skies,
As we shall watch old planets fade
And mark the stranger stars arise,
So, surely, back through Sun and Cloud,
So, surely, from the outward main
Shall we return -- return again!
Yea, we return -- return again

the rest were taken away

I live in the middle of nowhere, where nowhere's all around
And in the middle of nowhere, there are many nowhere sounds
Colourful birds in the middle of nowhere screech and squawk and trill
A choir of frogs sing in chorus in the centre of nowheresville

Sometimes I go to somewhere, where somewhere's all around
And in the middle of somewhere there are many somewhere sounds
Cars in the middle of somewhere screech their tyres and blare their horns
Jackhammers hammer, sirens wail singing the cacophonous somewhere song

Then I love to get back to nowhere, where nowhere's all around
Because in the middle of nowhere, there's something all around
Peace and harmony and stillness are everywhere I see
Right in the middle of nowhere is where I like to be




When we meet
in the midnight hour 
country girl 
I will bring you night flowers 
coloured like your eyes 
in the moonlight 
in the midnight 
hour

I remember

Your cold hand 
held for a moment among strangers 
held for a moment among dripping trees 
in the midnight hour

I remember

Your eyes coloured like the autumn landscape 
walking down muddy lanes 
watching sheep eating yellow roses 
walking in city squares in winter rain 
kissing in darkened hallways 
walking in empty suburban streets 
saying goodnight in deserted alleyways

in the midnight hour

Andy Williams singing `We'll keep a Welcome in the
Hillsides' for us
When I meet you at the station
The Beatles singing `We Can Work it Out' with James
Ensor at the harmonium
Rita Hayworth in a nightclub singing `Arcade Mia'

I will send you armadas 
of love vast argosies of flowers 
in the midnight hour 
country girl

when we meet

in the moonlight 
midnight 
hour 
country girl

I will bring you

yellow 
white 
eyes 
bright 
moon 
light 
mid 
night 
flowers 
in the midnight hour. 

In the midst of the ocean 
With unspun thread. 
I am towing the boat: 
My prayer and. 
Ferry me too, across: 
Water in my unbaked earthen plates 
Seeps in and none collects ' 
yearn and yearn 
To return Home


On the stairs by the sea, sitting down, 
I absorb the strength of violent winds.
The waves' white foam has turned brown.
Skies give away only a slit-like glimpse
of their deep and far-away azure beauty.
I inhale, melting in the view of the tree, 
feel intimately connected to the wild sea, 
while cloudy heavens seem to embrace me.
The soulful thoughts end quite abruptly, 
when my son from behind calls suddenly.

'LIAS! 'Lias! Bless de Lawd!
Don' you know de day's erbroad?
Ef you don' git up, you scamp,
Dey'll be trouble in dis camp.

Oh, you down, suh; huh, you down-

'We kiss
on the edge

of the cliff

dizzy with
the danger of it

the sea

greedily eating

the crumbling land
beneath us

& below us

waves crash
around the unseen

& seen
rocks.

You have to stand
on tip toe

to kiss me

& in my embrace
I lift you off your feet

as you dangle
from my kiss

you fasten your arms
tighter around my neck.

"Hold me over
the cliff. 

kiss me.  

over its nothingness! "

"So that I could fall
or you could dropp me

if you wanted to! "

Your mouth
kissing me intensely

as if you only
hanging from this

solitary
kiss

breathless
you tell me

it was like
".  

walking on air

& if fell

I wouldn’t have cared! "

The sea 
cheated of us

bellows below 
us

a minotaur
in this maze
of madness

you an Ariadne
I a Theseus

in the myth

of our own
making. 

The little bird
somehow
escapes the cat

but can't escape
the Death
that beats
under its feathers

bloodied in my hands
that hold it
I cradle it
& cry

the bird imaging
that when you die
comes

takes you gently
in its hands
& bathes you
in its tears

a sunset
staining a sky
that is 
fading
fading.

IN THE MYTHOLOGY OF FOXES

The foxes blood 
on the stone
still there two days
after

staring at me.
Only the day before
a daring raider

of my uncle's henhouse
the talk of our household.
But my uncle was patient
& stalked the lonely hourds

until the fox
came to meet her death
thinking only of her cubs
& how big & bright

the moon loomed
tonight
and how the fearful thunder
of the gun

had ended
everything
and how now
shot through the head

her carcass thrown
behind a hedge
she finds herself
still staring bak

into the mind
of the little boy
even more aware
of her presence

now that nothing
exists
and how for 
ever after

the boy
carries her death
cradling it
in his mind

trying to comfort
her
with his human
tears. 

A river of ice is melting
Deep down- I stir again
I am moved as a stone removed
From  a frozen winter bed

I have seen the light returning
Sparkles from the other side
Make a pavement out of crystal
Drops- to walk across-I would try. 

Taking a step-precarious
My feet feel not the way
Yet-I think-If I were worthy. 
I could become-as light- a ray. 
And blur improbability
Calumny-all the rest
Would sink-except 
Faith and our love
Believing-
Miracles possessed. 


All pains and pleasure of the mother

Mother is the reason of all evolution
Mother is the supreme protection

She guides us throughout our life
Mother has no substitute 
So, she is always in existence
throughout our life


In the Neolithic Age savage warfare did I wage
 For food and fame and woolly horses' pelt;
I was singer to my clan in that dim, red Dawn of Man,
 And I sang of all we fought and feared and felt.
 
Yea, I sang as now I sing, when the Prehistoric spring
 Made the piled Biscayan ice-pack split and shove;
 Were about me and beneath me and above.
 
But a rival, of Solutr]/e, told the tribe my style was ~outr]/e~ --
 'Neath a tomahawk of diorite he fell.
And I left my views on Art, barbed and tanged, below the heart
 Of a mammothistic etcher at Grenelle.
 
Then I stripped them, scalp from skull, and my hunting dogs fed full,
 And their teeth I threaded neatly on a thong;
And I wiped my mouth and said, "It is well that they are dead,
 For I know my work is right and theirs was wrong

"
 
But my Totem saw the shame; from his ridgepole shrine he came,
 And he told me in a vision of the night: --
"There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays,
 And every single one of them is right!"
 
     .    .    .    .    .
 
Then the silence closed upon me till They put new clothing on me
 Of whiter, weaker flesh and bone more frail;
And I stepped beneath Time's finger, once again a tribal singer
 [And a minor poet certified by Tr--ll].
 
Still they skirmish to and fro, men my messmates on the snow,
 When we headed off the aurochs turn for turn;
When the rich Allobrogenses never kept amanuenses,
 And our only plots were piled in lakes at Berne.
 
 Still we pinch and slap and jabber, scratch and dirk;
Still we let our business slide -- as we dropped the half-dressed hide --
 To show a fellow-savage how to work.
 
Still the world is wondrous large, -- seven seas from marge to marge, --
 And it holds a vast of various kinds of man;
And the wildest dreams of Kew are the facts of Khatmandhu,
 And the crimes of Clapham chaste in Martaban.
 
Here's my wisdom for your use, as I learned it when the moose
 And the reindeer roared where Paris roars to-night: --
There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays,
 And -- every -- single -- one -- of -- them -- is -- right

parents selling their children to get out of debt
just to make ends meet
a problem which they can not defeat.

yet we classify ourselves as humane? 
now that's a crying shame.

maybe it's time for noahs ark

so i guess the solution is not
just for the LORD to decide.

but for all of humanity to see
that this destruction has exceeded their realities.

the LORD has to soften our hearts

       In the night 
Grey heavy clouds muffled the valleys, 
    "O Master that movest the wind with a finger, 
    Humble, idle, futile peaks are we. 
    Grant that we may run swiftly across the world 
    To huddle in worship at Thy feet
 


In the morning 
A noise of men at work came the clear blue miles, 
And the little black cities were apparent. 
    "O Master that knowest the meaning of raindrops, 
    Humble, idle, futile peaks are we. 
    That we may sing Thy goodness to the sun
 


In the evening 
The far valleys were sprinkled with tiny lights. 
    "O Master, 
    Thou that knowest the value of kings and birds, 
    Thou hast made us humble, idle futile peaks. 
    Thou only needest eternal patience; 
    Humble, idle, futile peaks
 


In the night 
Grey heavy clouds muffled the valleys, 

In the silent midnight watches,
When the earth was clothed in gloom,
And the grim and awful darkness
Crept unbidden to my room-
On the solemn, deathly stillness
Of the night, there broke a sound,
Like ten million wailing voices
Crying loudly from the ground.


From ten million graves came voices,
East and West, and North and South,
Leagues apart, and yet together
Spake they, e'en as with one mouth:
'Men and women! men and women!'
Cried these voices from the ground,
And the very earth was shaken
With the strange and awful sound-


'Ye who weep in selfish sorrow,
Ye who laugh in selfish mirth,
Hark! and listen for a moment
To the voices from the earth:
Wake and listen! ye who slumber,
Pause and listen! ye who feast,
To the warning of the voices
From the graves in West and East.


'We, the victims of a demon,
We, who one, and each, and all,
Can cry out before high heaven,
'We are slain by alcohol!'-
We would warn you, youths and maidens,
From the path that we have trod-
From the path that leads 
to
ruin,


'We, the millions who have fallen,
Warn you from the ruddy glow
Of the wine in silver goblets,
For 
destruction
lies below.
Wine and gin, and rum and brandy,
Whiskey, cider, ale, and beer,
These have slain us and destroyed us-
These the foes that brought us here.


''You are safe,' you say. Ah heaven!
So 
we
said, and drank, and died.
'We are safe!' we proudly boasted,
Yet we sank down in the tide.
There is never any safety
From the snares of alcohol
For the youth who looks on liquor,
Tastes or touches it at all.


'We beseech you, men and women,
Fathers, mothers, sons, and wives,
To arise, and slay the demon
That is threatening dear ones' lives!
Do not preach of 
moderation

To your children; for, alas!
There is not a foe more subtle
Than the fateful 'social glass.'


'Thoughtless mother, wife, or sister,
Dash that poison cup away!
He, the husband, son, or brother
Who so gaily sips to-day,
May to-morrow stagger homeward,
Jeered and scorned by sober men.
Would you smile upon him proudly-
Would you say, 'I did it,' then?


'Ah! a vast and mighty number
Of the drunkards in all lands
Take the first step to destruction
Led by white and fragile hands.
Every smile you give the wine-cup,
Every glance, O lady fair!
Like a spade, digs down and hollows out
A drunkard's grave somewhere.


'Men in office, men in power,
Will you let this demon wild
Stalk unfettered through the nation,
Slaying woman, man, and child?
Oh! arouse, ye listless mortals,
There is work for every one!
We have warned you of your danger-
We have spoken, we have done.'


Round about me fell the silence
Of the solemn night once more,
And I heard the quiet ticking
Of the clock outside my door.
It was not a dreamer's fancy,
Not a romance of my brain,
But the warning of the victims
That old Alcohol had slain. 

THE leaves and tassels of the oak
Were golden-green with May,
Pavilion whence forever broke
Some angel roundelay.
A carol like a glory came
From topmost twig astir,
Enkindled by a flying flame,
The scarlet tanager.
The tree was glad as Paradise
When, eager soul on soul,
The saints flock home. There glistened twice
A wild-throat oriole;
And once the grosbeak's rosy breast
Poured its enchanted hymn;
While sunny wing and jewel crest
Lit many a blissful limb.
The whole wide world was in my oak
Whose catkins danced for mirth,
— Plumes gray as curling city smoke,
Plumes brown as fresh-plowed earth;
Even heaven had graced our festival,
For oft the loving eye
Would find, coaxed by a wistful call,
The bluebird's fleck of sky. 

I do not choose to dream; there cometh on me
Some strange old lust for deeds.
As to the nerveless hand of some old warrior
The sword-hilt or the war-worn wonted helmet
Brings momentary life and long-fled cunning,
So to my soul grown old - 
Grown old with many a jousting, many a foray, 
Grown old with namy a hither-coming and hence-going - 
Till now they send him dreams and no more deed;
So doth he flame again with might for action,
Forgetful of the council of elders,
Forgetful that who rules doth no more battle,
Forgetful that such might no more cleaves to him
So doth he flame again toward valiant doing. 

in the palace of incredible roses
we were breathing only the rose-filled air
and music fell in fountains freshly tuned

to so much jasmine.

in other rooms
in castles of the sun
I wandered freely-
turning, as in a dream, 

the Light-bound books
of neglected poets. 
while an Alhambran stillness grew

the air flamed out in little pink sighs and sang
'oh my extraordinary

crystal cancion'. 
'remember me, 

remember - me.'
I gathered rose dust everywhere
to build their house anew

but then
oh broken, broken
in a mistranslated instant: 

the splendid clocks
in the bell-towers

of a thousand ill-timed regimes
faltered and fell
so that we kept counting

without numbers-

new fractures in the poetry
of an old endurance



En El Palacio de Las Rosas Increibles

en el palacio de las rosas increibles
es que estaban respirando solo
el aire lleno de rosas
y cae la musica en
las fuentes frescas
afinada
a tanto jazmin.
en otros cuartos
en castillos del sol
descaminando-
libremente-
pasano los libros encuadernados
con La Luz
de los poetas olvidados
mientras que crece un quietud
como la de La Alhamra
hasta magnolias inmensos
cuidado por El Senor
quemado el aire
en suspiros pequenos
de color rosa
y cantan: 
ay mi cancion extraordinario
de cristal: 
acuerdate de mi
acuerdate de mi
y se reunieron
el polvo de las rosas
para construir de nuevo
sus hogares
pero entonces-
quebrantado-quebrantado
en un instante
mal traducido
los relojes esplendidos
en los torres de
las campanas
de mil regimenes
inoportunos
deshacerse
y se caen
de manera que
nosotros quedaban
contando
sin numeros
grietas nuevas
en un resistencia
antigua-

(poem in English,july Sitting on the bench 
Where to go
What to do 
Split thoughts 

On the grass 
Birds pick up their minds 
Children play 
Happy 

Time runs 
Some left out 
I have to go 
Time with me 

Someone like me 
Undecided 
Gazing at the space 
That is  I find 

I left the park 
Along the road 
With but without 
My direction


She sits in the park. Her clothes are out of date.
Two children whine and bicker, tug her skirt.
A third draws aimless patterns in the dirt
Someone she loved once passed by – too late

to feign indifference to that casual nod.
"How nice" et cetera. "Time holds great surprises."
From his neat head unquestionably rises

They stand a while in flickering light, rehearsing
the children’s names and birthdays. "It’s so sweet
to hear their chatter, watch them grow and thrive, "
she says to his departing smile. Then, nursing
the youngest child, sits staring at her feet.
To the wind she says, "They have eaten me alive.



"SIX thousand veterans practised in war's game,
Tried men, at Killicranky were arrayed
Against an equal host that wore the plaid,
Shepherds and herdsmen.--Like a whirlwind came
The Highlanders, the slaughter spread like flame;
And Garry, thundering down his mountain-road,
Was stopped, and could not breathe beneath the load
Of the dead bodies.--'Twas a day of shame
For them whom precept and the pedantry
Of cold mechanic battle do enslave. 
O for a single hour of that Dundee,
Who on that day the word of onset gave!
Like conquest would the Men of England see;
And her Foes find a like inglorious grave. 

A virtue which never dulls or die
Standing as a patriarch all along so high, 
What is truth is a truth only, 
Can never be stained by any lie.

Permanently it persists as a bold and beauty
While lie is always so mean and a sly.
These two always distance each other 
Maintaining a wide parallel line.

Truth is ever - lasting 
Being so joyful with a gleam.
And lie, being so treacherous and mean, 
Existing though but very short lived.

Truth shows the path towards
Liberation and  ultimate peace of mind, 
Finally connecting the soul 
With the Absolute, divine.

Sticking to lie and negotiating it, 
This life ends up 
With all distress, miseries and pains.

What is truth is a truth only, 
Can never be stained by any means.
Truth persists, truth exists
So bold and beautiful is this Truth.

there is an identity and harmony
between the mind and the things. 

When the experience of harmony
become so complete, 

when the beautiful become so sublime, 
 
a deep realization of that
 
leads the soul into true mystic state, 
 
and touches the absolute. 

So Davies wrote: ' This leaves me in the pink. ' 
Then scrawled his name: ' Your loving sweetheart Willie ' 
With crosses for a hug. He'd had a drink 
Of rum and tea; and, though the barn was chilly, 
For once his blood ram warm; he had pay to spend, 
Winter was passing; soon the year would mend. 

He couldn't sleep that night. Stiff in the dark 
He groaned and thought of Sundays at the farm, 
When he'd go out as cheerful as a lark 
In his best suit to wander arm-in-arm 
With brown-eyed Gwen, and whisper in her ear 
The simple, silly things she liked to hear. 

And then he thought: to-morrow night we trudge 
Up to the trenches, and my boots are rotten. 
Five miles of stodgy clay and freezing sludge, 
And everything but wretchedness forgotten. 
To-night he's in the pink; but soon he'll die. 
And still the war goes on; he don't know why. 

I was in the plane.
Someone asked: 
-Are you comfortable? 
-Oh, yes! Thank you! 
He has shortened
the space between the seats.
And now? – he asked again.
we were in the plane, 
otherwise I would 
smash his face, 
it could be a disgrace.
Some people feel discomfort
when you feel good.
They are so happy
when you are in a bad mood.



No, he didn't utter a word

Raised his hand in salutation

To return mine! 

No, I didn't have any inclination

Either to utter a word

Or entertain a thought

 

Thought had been suspended

 

The silence that followed

Wasn't a strain but wholesome

 

An uplifting feeling

Originated from the navel

To travel upward

 

How do people liken orgasm

That numbs the senses

In a downward thrust

To a moment of meditative vibes

That elevate one's core upward? 

 

The Master's presence

Benumbed me

His silence suspended me

On a bar of timelessness

The midsummer heat wasn't felt

 

We sat in silence with

Past and future faded

From the consciousness

The present didn't matter at all

We're transported to a realm

Where there's no time sequence

 

No wonder

While returning

The fullmoon that came with us

Looked like the afternoon sun

In whose presence we took solace

 

Last night

The fullmoon didn't leave

Any emptiness behind

It bloomed in several

Uplifting hues and

It filled me to brim

As the time when I sat in the

Avadhut's presence

Under the blazing sun! 



In the presence of my beloved
There is no sin or virtue
Darkness or light
No philosophy or theology

There are only flowers and fruits without a tree
There is only the radiant shine. 
There is no austere life.
There is no knowledge, 
No place and space.
There is nothing but you.
Only you are present, 
My beloved. 

i saw trees
shedding their leaves
i saw ponds
drying to their core
i saw rivers
running in spate
i saw trees 
blooming at their best


The day I missed your presence from this earth
Since then I remain - as my clone without heart.
My dream my anger my joy and desire-
They all followed you -in that blazing pyre.

Now, I am a pauper only, with a mindless head 
Sailing in a mast less boat with no goal no rest, 
Do not find any place 
with a little peace and solace, 

The only possession what I had with me
My tears drops in my eyes, 
They also are oozing in drops - 
Though, I tried my best to behold.

By clasping and closing my eyes, 
I tried to hold them in me, 
But they didn't listen at all 
And all had flown out. 


A handful of love, peace and romance.
You took them back all at a time - 
Suddenly in a glance.

I'm truly a vagrant pauper now -
With no tear, any near or dear.
Aimlessly I'm wandering, now
Behind an obscure mirage.

I don't know what You get - 
By paining and punishing in this way.
I even don't know what You'll do next
With a destitute like me! ! 



It rains with gentle showers
And I'm confined in my balcony
But my mind is soaked 
In the showers of agony. 

In this rainy afternoon 
I wish to be with you in joy 
In the showers of rain
Under the open sky. 

You are not with me now.
Once so joyfully we'd spend hours together.
The showers of rain remind me that
We were the inseparable souls to each other. 

We heed a voice so clearly
Joining us intensely! 
Tears of sorrow disappear
To give way to light, so near.

Bright lanes are opened widely
Therein we'd love to stay
To breathe that joy, feel that love, and pray.
We trust the Angel singing there
Hymns of purity and sweet care.

In such a a broad realm of light
There's no grey alley or darkness
No suffering as we witness
Just celestial chants sublime
Like the sweetest in our lifetime. 



They look best when they’re under the chupah 
And getting married-
The girl I used to sleep with in October, 
Surrounded by sharks: mazzeltoff, because now
You’ve found your better man practicing law
And oral sex, that ancient thing: 
How the tortoise beat the hare, that same old game; 
And there is no more reason to buy a new bed, 
Or carve the pumpkin, or kiss the mezuzah-
I am always the same old thing, 
Doing my lines better than you, 
Getting drunk and practicing the bicycle, 
the little truancies
I draw to give the cleaning ladies something to do, 
After midnight and all us unbounded and hung
Like exhausted sisters in the draperies and Laundromats
And landscaping with the cicadas in your suburbia; 
I am not dancing with anyone: Celibate, I am inventing
Humid electricity- See by which way I come and
Hold court smoking cigarettes in the old neighborhoods
And upon the old swing sets you’ve forgotten: 
Happily you are with child, or you are expecting; or taking offices, 
Always clinging to your traditions of silver and gefilte fish: 
He drapes the diamonds around your bones, you become
Kabalistic and forgetful- You don’t go outside anymore
Save to the dress codes of fine restaurants, and never anymore
To studious dreams; but you are something your mother
Wrought, while I still don’t care and even now cherish
In the revelry of our lost cause.(They are Tamils. I am a Sinhalese in same country called Sri Lanka.)  

They murmur and exchange
In their own mother tongue
I was a dumb person
Because of the language
I talk
In my tongue
He reacts and learns
As he knows little bit
In the same cell of same act
Between the death and life
We passed time without a meaning.
Looks at me
Makes change and 
Closes with loyalty
Clearing face with smiles

Thereafter
We 
Composed words
With crippling time
Exchanging a lot 
Among each other.

As mutes sometimes
Had to be with another's
Silence was the greatest tongue
Understood hearts to each other
Danger beckons untold secrets 
Came out at the sleepless nights
Identifying the souls.
The image changed
He and I brought
We together drew a new picture
Point of the pen of language
Taking the colors of trust
While the time
We imprisoned in the camp
Called "Boossa Detention camp"In the sea caves
there's a thirst there's a love
there's an ecstasy
all hard like shells
you can hold them in your palm.

In the sea caves
for whole days I gazed into your eyes
and I didn't know you nor did you know me. 


In the sea of darkness, I pretended to be blind, 
So I could savor your soul, and scent your beauty.
My hands are chasing the waves of your perfect body.
I am in heaven; you are sweet, silky, warm and kind.

The radio station is playing the best symphonies of Beethoven.
You are moaning, humming, and crying tears of joy and passion.
We’re flying without wings in the wintry wind; we’re in heaven.
You and I are diving deep in the sea of our imagination.

We are living our paradisiacal fantasies; no, it is not a dream, 
Because we are awake, we are having our favorite ice cream.

In the sea of darkness, I lit two huge vanilla scented candles, 
So I could admire the nuances of your smile, your classy handles, 
And curves.  We’re happy that we’re blessed by the Spirit above. 

In the secular night you wander around
alone in your house. It's two-thirty.
Everyone has deserted you,
or this is your story;
you remember it from being sixteen,
when the others were out somewhere, having a good time,
or so you suspected,
and you had to baby-sit.
You took a large scoop of vanilla ice-cream
and filled up the glass with grapejuice
and ginger ale, and put on Glenn Miller
with his big-band sound,
and lit a cigarette and blew the smoke up the chimney,
and cried for a while because you were not dancing,
and then danced, by yourself, your mouth circled with purple.

Now, forty years later, things have changed,
and it's baby lima beans.
It's necessary to reserve a secret vice.
This is what comes from forgetting to eat
at the stated mealtimes. You simmer them carefully,
drain, add cream and pepper,
and amble up and down the stairs,
scooping them up with your fingers right out of the bowl,
talking to yourself out loud.
You'd be surprised if you got an answer,
but that part will come later.

There is so much silence between the words,
you say. You say, The sensed absence
amount to much the same thing,
only in reverse.
You say, I have too much white clothing.
You start to hum.
Several hundred years ago
this could have been mysticism
or heresy. It isn't now.
Outside there are sirens.
Someone's been run over.
The century grinds on.[once more, to The Brothers Grimm]

how marvelous it seemed to you then
the cobbler asleep at his bench
too tired to dream

of the work still left to do
the leathern apron's torn
his own shoes full of holes

are fit for scorn
his tools are not the best but
he has hammered gold into slippers

in his time embroidered with
the thread of rose
and never glanced at the clock

painted light green, perhaps with red tulips
all around the edge
a wooden taskmaster with a shrill cuckoo

o' clock, the mayor comes at noon
or sooner if there's bad luck
how can one room contain

so much misfortune.
he sighs to his wife
munching a little toast and cheese

as if they were mice.
the dancers from the pantomime
in valentine tulle tap their toes

impatiently en pointe*
backstage for slippers new, 
encrusted with rubies ribbons

in the sheen of cherries
he hasn't seen for breakfast ever.
he slumbers on while

midnight's moon floods the shop
not caring if  business is better.
then wonder of wonders and none too soon

the green clock  ticks the elves in
one by well-skilled one to cobble
in fairy princess stitching

never seen
the rag tag edges of his dream
he will remember this in daylight hours




It was naughty to pinch all his clothes
and him all so wet and bedraggled
but he should have thought twice
when he chose to entice 
all us girls into the men's showers.
Mind you it was ever so funny
to watch as he cried for his mummy
and even more fun as we pinched his pert bum
while he hopelessly searched for his trousers. 

these are the showroom cakes why
don't they ever say to you
in the bakeries: 

won't you take one for a test drive? 
here's an eclair the size of

Mars and more, besides
the powdered doughnuts
light as fancies

the black forest tortes
so exquisitely chocolate
and cherried together

here: 
try a chorus or two
it's so creamy when paired

with the tiered raspberry orange
fluffsicle, only a nickel, 

our latest model.

in the silent shade
of wishes unfulfilled. 

in the single room

dreams of 
yesteryears
yesterdays drips-

all in each particles 
of each teardrops
flowing through the face 
of many a morphed faces
tears tearing through it’s veins
through that trillion cells
cry in the single room

where the single bed waits 
for human to wake 
for another moments
endless days 
endless nights
that and there 
you ease your angst 

standing in the corner 
that single frozen denude woman 
like the bride in exile 
still singing
have you ever seen her 
wailing too

still 
in the stillness

when you roar 
like the lion
have you seen her 
awaken too
when u sigh

when you beat the drums 
with eyes closed
have you seen her 
dance in the beats 

like the window 
masked inside 
by the creeping money-plants

like the birds making and unmaking love 
on tree top outside
like the buffaloes 
crossing the river 
from this bank to other bank 

sealed moments 
unmasked
everything crept all over me-
refracting and diffracting 
reflecting l
ike the pure light
with an universal unlimited speed of light 
crossing m per second

sometimes you-
like the light
sometimes me-
like the energy

light through energy
energy through light
like the time 
that never waits

everything traveling faster. 

like the two-stage process 
of negativities 
into positivities
developing black and white photograph 
with endless colors of images
imaginations 
inside the dark-room 
you cry 
in your single room

empty tables 
sealed with words
weaving words 
for the world
with your mouth shut 
you are healing 
these many wounds
marching heading 
changing 
and challenge to realities 
 
you cry in the single room
and
eyes swathed with  teardrops 
that sieved through eyelashes
failing to hold 
like you fail to hold thirst

like the bee 
that knows honey drips 
deep inside the flower
an impact of fertility 
of three colour of red-green-blue
and 
green in between [our dreams]
with colours inside

that creates green- 
that creates pure green-
and from the pure image
that teardrops 
like honey drips out 
on to the single leaf 
of the creeping money-plants
of my greennee

and you said 
dewdrops-in the single room

dreams of yesteryears
yesterdays drips-

and you said	
dewdrops-The eyelids meet. He'll catch a little nap. 
The grizzled, crew-cut head drops to his chest. 
It shakes above the briefcase on his lap. 
Close voices breathe, "Poor sweet, he did his best
 


"Poor sweet, poor sweet," the bird-hushed glades repeat, 
Through which in quiet pomp his litter goes, 
Carried by native girls with naked feet. 
A sighing stream concurs in his repose. 

Could he but think, he might recall to mind 
The righteous mutiny or sudden gale 
That beached him here; the dear ones left behind . . . 
So near the ending, he forgets the tale. 

Were he to lift his eyelids now, he might 
Behold his maiden porters, brown and bare. 
But even here he has no appetite. 
It is enough to know that they are there. 

Enough that now a honeyed music swells, 
The gentle, mossed declivities begin, 
And the whole air is full of flower-smells. 
Failure, the longed-for valley, takes him in. 

In the song of your smiles
Is hidden all joy. 
So, let me savor every lyric
Though my life
Will never last that long
And so all my memories are
With all the shadows you are
In the water and in the air
And I give myself to you 
As a shadow. 


Fade into a faint memory.
The memory of what you used to be
And the memory of the friends you used to see.
In the speed of light minds can change
Minds can change, for most bad
And in the end it could be sad.
In the speed of light the tables can turn
around and around they go
And when they stop you will know.
In the speed of light A friend into a foe.


It’s not a playground where
you run around shouting
without noticing whether
there’s a listener

or a playgroup where
there’s paper, paste, scissors, 
all over the place, 
thoughts pasted on thoughts, 
without noticing anyone else

no, it’s some specific calling, 
saying, see that far-off other? 
we’re related; see us as together, 
your surprise may tell you
about that vastness –

maybe, awe, wonder, beauty, 
wisdom, truth-goodness-

so treat me, metaphor, 
as if god’s priest: 
respectfully, sparingly, carefully; 
as you would look at twins, 
each sleeping, but holding hands; 

love requires that


I saw you, and became empty; 

then I saw you, and became full; 

then I saw you. 

why should I choose
when you made both

But is it an activity for
grown men and women? 

A kind of stocktaking: 
sit quietly, begin to feel grateful
for something, maybe your family, 
your life even; 

remember how your grandmother
said, count your blessings
and you at the age when
you couldn't wait to find them first
and then maybe remember them, maybe not.

The list grows; a feeling that
you should give something back.

It seems a small gift; just words
on paper. So you wrap it 
more carefully than other gifts, 
write the name of the recipient
carefully, watching the ink
make a thin river like a vein
along the paper.

Can you still remember
how to spell the name? 

The address seems
sometimes very far away; sometimes
very close. 

O My Beloved
when I first cast eyes on You, 

if You had looked as I expected
I would have greeted you as an old friend

whom I had waited for, 
knowing I would recognise You from afar; 

but instead, you appear to me
so unexpectedly, in so many new disguises -

as a baby; in the face of a passing stranger, 
as a new flower; waiting in the shade of a tree –

that, taken by surprise, I see only You
before I see all else.

This is Your greatest gift to me, 
beyond all old, beyond all new, 

O My Beloved. 

Oh, you’re 
such a tease! 

You strip
before the roaring fire

whip your
bra off

to reveal two
tasselled tits.

I laugh at this
unexpected piece of
Burlesque! 

And then a thumb
either side of your panties

expectantly. 
.  

when unexpectedly 

we hear footsteps
the laughter of your Mum
and her friends! 

We dive under
the cover
of the vast table

snatching at our clothes

a nylon stocking
disappearing like a snake

even as they come in
and the magnificent table cloth

hides us
from their eyes.


We hold 
each other
holding our breath.




Your bosom 
heaving against my chest! 

Tasselled tits
shaking with suppressed mirth
biting down on
your bra clenched in your teeth.

We watch as the feet
talk about who’s husband is having who and what is one to do about it? 

Chit chat
& whatnot.

After an hour
we fall asleep

still in our state
of distress and undress

awake to find
they’ve gone

an empty room
a dying fire

too tired now
for strips & such

we crawl back
under the table

and go
back to sleep

dreaming happily ever after
in the splendour of our

under the table 
world. 

In the spring moonlight the lord of love
Thro' the amorous ravel's maze doth move; 
The crown of love love's raptures proves; 
For Radha his amorous darling moves,
Radha the ruby of ravishing girls
With him bathed in love's moonlight whirls.
And all the merry maidens with rapture
Dancing together the light winds capture
And the bracelets speak with a ravishing cry.
And the murmur of waist -bells rises high-
Meanwhile rapture -waking string
Ripest of strains the sonata of spring
That lover and lord of love- languid notes
With tired delight in throbbing throats.
And rumours of violin and bow
And Radha's ravisher makes sweet measure
With the flute,that musical voice of pleasure.
Bidyapati's genius richly wove
For King Roupnaraian this rhythm of love.

You take my breath
My heart skips a beat

In your eyes
I bathe in a warm pool
Aglow with life

My words are frozen
The hairs on my neck rise 
Awaiting your touch
In the still of the night


In the stillness of the night, 
A faint cry for love is heard.
Echoing far into the distance, 
Soaring higher than any bird.

In the stillness of the night, 
Under the moonlight shining.
She hears his painful cry, 
While alone she is dining.

She starts on a journey, 
To seek out his heartfelt cry.
For if she ignores his plea, 
He may slowly but surly die.

In the stillness of the night, 
As she wanders on her way.
She must find this lost soul, 
She can not turn away.

For she is lost as well, 
Deep inside she also weeps.
Though she may not know it, 
He wanders himself, her soul he seeks.

His cry for love gets louder, 
Her cry as well echos out.
In the stillness of the night, 
Together they wander about.

As they draw closer, 
Their loneliness begins to fade.
For their journey is coming to an end, 
From this love that has conveyed.

They come together at last, 
Under the midnight sun.
In the stillness of the night, 
Two young lovers have begun.[to the soul of the marveling artist, sculptor vanished to
realms of gold, Michael Rolando Richards]

Knowledge teaches us 
How much  is our need
Vices inundate  
In the swirl of greed.

Increasing knowledge 
Lessens the needs
Guides the  soul 
Towards wisdom and  peace

Vices are like 
Cancerous germs
Increases the greed 
To destroy oneself. 

Goal of life
Is to attain love and peace
With greed 
We can never reach that place.

Greed is 
Like a hunting trap
It allures, attracts 
And ruins at last.

Increasing knowledge 
Lessens the needs
Guides the a soul 
Towards wisdom and  peace



Are dole and grief to-day,
For the flower of all the Indies
Has gone the silent way.

In the tents of Akbar
Are emptiness and gloom,
And where the dancers gather,
The silence of the tomb.

Across the yellow desert,
Across the burning sands,
Old Akbar wanders madly,
And wrings his fevered hands.

And ever makes his moaning
To the unanswering sky,
For Sutna, lovely Sutna,
Who was so fair to die.

For Sutna danced at morning,
And Sutna danced at eve;
Her dusky eyes half hidden
Behind her silken sleeve.

Her pearly teeth out-glancing
Between her coral lips,
The tremulous rhythm of passion
Marked by her quivering hips.

As lovely as a jewel
Of fire and dewdrop blent,
So danced the maiden Sutna
In gallant Akbar's tent.

And one who saw her dancing,
Saw her bosom's fall and rise
Put all his body's yearning
Into his lovelit eyes.

Then Akbar came and drove him--
A jackal--from his door,
And bade him wander far and look
On Sutna's face no more.

Some day the sea disgorges,
The wilderness gives back,
Those half-dead who have wandered,
Aimless, across its track.

And he returned--the lover,
Haggard of brow and spent;
He found fair Sutna standing
Before her master's tent.

'Not mine, nor Akbar's, Sutna!'
He cried and closely pressed,
And drove his craven dagger
Straight to the maiden's breast.

Oh, weep, oh, weep, for Sutna,
So young, so dear, so fair,
Her face is gray and silent
Beneath her dusky hair.

And wail, oh, wail, for Akbar,
Who walks the desert sands,
Crying aloud for Sutna,
Wringing his fevered hands.

In the tents of Akbar
The tears of sorrow run,
But the corpse of Sutna's slayer,
Lies rotting in the sun. 

this is the curtain they made for the one
window missing a pane of glass perhaps
and it is beautiful to you

coming after the fact with its unmistakeable rickrack.
or perhaps, it is not.
you should know under what conditions

anyway, this came to be, whatever the work of art; 
the glaze on the pond of their winter
without food or candle in the dark. the rainless ridicule

of the long days before the ark
was finished. 

the shimmer of it all, pre-rainbow.
and the lost feelings.
the cost of this. 

going up and down the mirroring scales, 
you too may shine in a different place
a more Elysian field

and time but keep in mind: 

where they piled twigs in the out of doors
and tried to light them-
to keep you warm coming so much later, down the years..

will  you came back to visit them
conquering your fears
with Telstar, 

a jar of cherry preserves? 
a shelf or two spray painted blue

or pretend you've done things
all by yourself.
and never really knew them.

mary  angela douglas august e put our heads together
(hide behind our hair) 

only kisses & promises

happen in here.


We put our heads together
(disappear behind our hair) 

the world reduced to a single heartbeat 

only love happens here.


We put our heads together
(the world disappears) 

Time seems to pass us by

.  

who cares

in the theatre of roses I took my seat.
of course the cushions were rose velvet.
now we begin.

each petal whispers from the floodlights of
a moon overhead, in wisps of tissue pink
resembling clouds, resembling dreams that

barely speak aloud, the hidden streams.
I hid you in my pockets thinking to keep you
alive and when you curled at the edges

I cried. we remember sighed the roses.
we remember you near the rosebushes
in a corner of the yard and how you

tried. and now we're here so you can see
that wishes are never wasted on anyone.
and their rose laughter was so sweet

in waves and waves it rose.
I curtseyed like Alice learning my lessons curiously.
then, outside in the blinding afternoon

on the uneven sidewalks of the world, 
I stood awhile- remembering life
as a little girl-

outside the matinee of roses.
I have finished now.
this was their song.

a woman by herself
singing the rice-planting song.
 



AS we rush, as we rush in the Train, 
   The trees and the houses go wheeling back, 
But the starry heavens above the plain 
   Come flying on our track. 

All the beautiful stars of the sky, 
   The silver doves of the forest of Night, 
Over the dull earth swarm and fly, 
   Companions of our flight. 

We will rush ever on without fear; 
   Let the goal be far, the flight be fleet! 
For we carry the Heavens with us, dear, 
   While the Earth slips from our feet

In a dull swiftness we are carried by 
With bodies left at sway and shaking knees. 
The wind has ceased, or is a feeble breeze 
Warm in the sun. The leaves are not yet dry 
From yesterday's dense rain. All, low and high, 
A strong green country; but, among its trees, 
Ruddy and thin with Autumn. After these 
There is the city still before the sky. 
Versailles is reached. Pass we the galleries 
And seek the gardens. A great silence here, 
Through the long planted alleys, to the long 
Distance of water. More than tune or song, 
Silence shall grow to awe within thine eyes, 
Till thy thought swim with the blue turning sphere. 

And now the green household is dark. 
The half-moon completely is shining 
On the earth-lighted tops of the trees. 
To be dead, a house must be still. 
The floor and the walls wave me slowly; 
I am deep in them over my head. 
The needles and pine cones about me 


Are full of small birds at their roundest, 
Their fist without mercy gripping 
Hard down through the tree to the roots 
To sing back at light when they feel it. 
We lie here like angels in bodies, 
My brothers and I, one dead, 
The other asleep from much living, 


In mid-air huddled beside me. 
Dark climbed to us here as we climbed 
Up the nails I have hammered all day 
Through the sprained, comic rungs of the ladder 
Of broom handles, crate slats, and laths 
Foot by foot up the trunk to the branches 
Where we came out at last over lakes 


Of leaves, of fields disencumbered of earth 
That move with the moves of the spirit. 
Each nail that sustains us I set here; 
Each nail in the house is now steadied 
By my dead brother’s huge, freckled hand. 
Through the years, he has pointed his hammer 
Up into these limbs, and told us 


That we must ascend, and all lie here. 
Step after step he has brought me, 
Embracing the trunk as his body, 
Shaking its limbs with my heartbeat, 
Till the pine cones danced without wind 
And fell from the branches like apples. 
In the arm-slender forks of our dwelling 


I breathe my live brother’s light hair. 
The blanket around us becomes 
As solid as stone, and it sways. 
With all my heart, I close 
The blue, timeless eye of my mind. 
Wind springs, as my dead brother smiles 
And touches the tree at the root; 


A shudder of joy runs up 
The trunk; the needles tingle; 
One bird uncontrollably cries. 
The wind changes round, and I stir 
Within another’s life. Whose life? 
Who is dead? Whose presence is living? 
When may I fall strangely to earth, 


Who am nailed to this branch by a spirit? 
Can two bodies make up a third? 
To sing, must I feel the world’s light? 
My green, graceful bones fill the air 
With sleeping birds. Alone, alone 
And with them I move gently. 
I move at the heart of the world. 

I snatched two poppies 
From the parapet’s ledge, 
Two bright red poppies 
That winked on the ledge. 
Behind my ear 
I stuck one through, 
One blood red poppy 
I gave to you. 

The sandbags narrowed 
And screwed out our jest, 
And tore the poppy 
You had on your breast

I am choked
safe
dust blind, I 
See trench floor poppies 
Strewn. Smashed you lie. 

I have lived in the underworld so long:
How can you, a creature of light,
Without terror understand the song
And unmoved hear what moves in night? 

I am a spirit that yours has found,
Strange, undelightful, obscure,
In terrible darkness, breathing breath impure.

Creature of light and happiness,
Deeper the darkness was when you,
With your bright terror eddying the distress,
Grazed the dark waves and shivering further flew.

I came up out of the subway and there were
people standing on the steps as if they knew
something I didn't. This was in the Cold War,
and nuclear fallout. I looked and the whole avenue
was empty, I mean utterly, and I thought,
The birds have abandoned our cities and the plague
of silence multiplies through their arteries, they fought
the war and they lost and there's nothing subtle or vague
in this horrifying vacuum that is New York. I caught
the blare of a loudspeaker repeatedly warning
the last few people, maybe strolling lovers in their walk,
that the world was about to end that morning
on Sixth or Seventh Avenue with no people going to work
in that uncontradicted, horrifying perspective.
It was no way to die, but it's also no way to live.
Well, if we burnt, it was at least New York.

Everybody in New York is in a sitcom.
I'm in a Latin American novel, one
in which an egret-haired viejo shakes with some
invisible sorrow, some obscene affliction,
and chronicles it secretly, till it shows in his face,
the parenthetical wrinkles confirming his fiction
to his deep embarrassment. Look, it's
just the old story of a heart that won't call it quits
whatever the odds, quixotic. It's just one that'll
break nobody's heart, even if the grizzled colonel
pitches from his steed in a cavalry charge, in a battle
that won't make him a statue. It is the hell
of ordinary, unrequited love. Watch these egrets
trudging the lawn in a dishevelled troop, white banners
trailing forlornly; they are the bleached regrets
of an old man's memoirs, printed stanzas.
showing their hinged wings like wide open secrets.

Who has removed the typewriter from my desk,
so that I am a musician without his piano
with emptiness ahead as clear and grotesque
as another spring? My veins bud, and I am so
full of poems, a wastebasket of black wire.
The notes outside are visible; sparrows will
line antennae like staves, the way springs were,
but the roofs are cold and the great grey river
where a liner glides, huge as a winter hill,
moves imperceptibly like the accumulating
years. I have no reason to forgive her
for what I brought on myself. I am past hating,
past the longing for Italy where blowing snow
absolves and whitens a kneeling mountain range
outside Milan. Through glass, I am waiting
for the sound of a bird to unhinge the beginning
of spring, but my hands, my work, feel strange
without the rusty music of my machine. No words
for the Arctic liner moving down the Hudson, for the mange
of old snow moulting from the roofs. No poems. No birds.

The Sweet Life Cafe

If I fall into a grizzled stillness
sometimes, over the red-chequered tablecloth
outdoors of the Sweet Life Cafe, when the noise
of Sunday traffic in the Village is soft as a moth
working in storage, it is because of age
which I rarely admit to, or, honestly, even think of.
I have kept the same furies, though my domestic rage
is illogical, diabetic, with no lessening of love
though my hand trembles wildly, but not over this page.
My lust is in great health, but, if it happens
that all my towers shrivel to dribbling sand,
joy will still bend the cane-reeds with my pen's
elation on the road to Vieuxfort with fever-grass
white in the sun, and, as for the sea breaking
in the gap at Praslin, they add up to the grace
I have known and which death will be taking
from my hand on this chequered tablecloth in this good place. 

Someone embraces me
Someone looks at me with the eyes of a wolf
Someone takes off his hat
So I can see him better

Everyone asks me
Do you know how I'm related to you

Unknown old men and women
Appropriate the names
Of young men and women from my memory

I ask one of them
Is George the Wolf still living

That's me he answers
With a voice from the next world

I touch his cheek with my hand
And beg him with my eyes
To tell me if I'm living too


You can't put in the ground swell of the organ

Croix, Anglican Church
behind the paratrooper's voice: 'Turned cop
after Vietnam. I made thirty jumps.'
Bells punish the dead street and pigeons lurch
from the stone belfry, opening their chutes,
circling until the rings of ringing stop.
'Salud!' The paratrooper's glass is raised.
The congregation rises to its feet
like a patrol, with scuffling shoes and boots,
repeating orders as the organ thumps:

You cannot hear, beyond the quiet harbor,
the breakers cannonading on the bruised
horizon, or the charter engines gunning for
Buck Island. The only war here is a war
of silence between blue sky and sea,
and just one voice, the marching choir's, is raised
to draft new conscripts with the ancient cry
half-empty still, or like a glass, half-full.
Pinning itself to a cornice, a gull
hangs like a medal from the serge-blue sky.

Are these boats all? Is the blue water all?
The rocks surpliced with lace where they are moored,
dinghy, catamaran, and racing yawl,
Wesley and Watts, their evangelical light
lanced down the mine shafts to our chapel pew,
its beam gritted with motes of anthracite
that drifted on us in our chapel benches:
ash on the dead mired in Flanders' trenches,
as a gray drizzle now defiles the view

of this blue harbor, framed in windows where
two yellow palm fronds, jerked by the wind's rain,
agree like horses' necks, and nodding bear,
slow as a hearse, a haze of tasseled rain,
and, as the weather changes in a child,
the paradisal day outside grows dark,
the yachts flutter like moths in a gray jar,
the martial voices fade in thunder, while
across the harbor, like a timid lure,
a rainbow casts its seven-colored arc.

Tonight, now Sunday has been put to rest.
Altar lights ride the black glass where the yachts
stiffly repeat themselves and phosphoresce
with every ripple - the wide parking-lots
of tidal affluence - and every mast
sways the night's dial as its needle veers
to find the station which is truly peace.
Like neon lasers shot across the bars
discos blast out the music of the spheres,
and, one by one, science infects the stars. 

In Worcester, Massachusetts,
I went with Aunt Consuelo
to keep her dentist's appointment
and sat and waited for her
in the dentist's waiting room.
It was winter. It got dark
early. The waiting room
was full of grown-up people,
arctics and overcoats,
lamps and magazines.
My aunt was inside
what seemed like a long time
and while I waited and read
the National Geographic
(I could read) and carefully
studied the photographs:
the inside of a volcano,
black, and full of ashes;
then it was spilling over
in rivulets of fire.
Osa and Martin Johnson
dressed in riding breeches,
laced boots, and pith helmets.
A dead man slung on a pole
"Long Pig," the caption said.
Babies with pointed heads
wound round and round with string;
black, naked women with necks
wound round and round with wire
like the necks of light bulbs.
Their breasts were horrifying.
I read it right straight through.
I was too shy to stop.
And then I looked at the cover:
the yellow margins, the date.
Suddenly, from inside,
came an oh! of pain
--Aunt Consuelo's voice--
not very loud or long.
I wasn't at all surprised;
even then I knew she was
a foolish, timid woman.
I might have been embarrassed,
but wasn't. What took me
completely by surprise
was that it was me:
my voice, in my mouth.
Without thinking at all
I was my foolish aunt,
I--we--were falling, falling,
our eyes glued to the cover
of the National Geographic,
February, 

I said to myself: three days
and you'll be seven years old.
I was saying it to stop
the sensation of falling off
the round, turning world.
into cold, blue-black space.
But I felt: you are an I,
you are an Elizabeth,
you are one of them.
Why should you be one, too?
I scarcely dared to look
to see what it was I was.
I gave a sidelong glance
--I couldn't look any higher--
at shadowy gray knees,
trousers and skirts and boots
and different pairs of hands
lying under the lamps.
I knew that nothing stranger
had ever happened, that nothing
stranger could ever happen.

Why should I be my aunt,
or me, or anyone?
What similarities
boots, hands, the family voice
I felt in my throat, or even
the National Geographic
and those awful hanging breasts
held us all together
or made us all just one?
How I didn't know any
word for it how "unlikely". . .
How had I come to be here,
like them, and overhear
a cry of pain that could have
got loud and worse but hadn't?

The waiting room was bright
and too hot. It was sliding
beneath a big black wave,
another, and another.

Then I was back in it.
The War was on. Outside,
in Worcester, Massachusetts,
were night and slush and cold,
and it was still the fifth
of February,  

All my words shall merge into
It shall be purified in the fire of love
in the furnace of my heart.

In the waiting womb of my soul, 
like seeds in pure stillness.

It will germinate there
in a centering silence
like the pupa bringing forth 
the colorful butterfly.

Conceived in love, 
the spirit shall flow 
from  heart to heart
with the nectar of love.

png)In the wave-strike over unquiet stones
the brightness bursts and bears the rose
and the ring of water contracts to a cluster
to one drop of azure brine that falls.
O magnolia radiance breaking in spume,
magnetic voyager whose death flowers
and returns, eternal, to being and nothingness:
shattered brine, dazzling leap of the ocean.
Merged, you and I, my love, seal the silence
while the sea destroys its continual forms,
collapses its turrets of wildness and whiteness,
because in the weft of those unseen garments
of headlong water, and perpetual sand,
we bear the sole, relentless tenderness. 

Full of blocky majesty, 
arrogant, dock-tailed, 
German princes glower
at the Russian communist.
                          All the presidents, chancellors
            in their different kinds of gut-
meanness look darkly out
                         each his own kind, 
his caste, and all their crooked
vulgarity is in that.
                      These are the wounders
of life. They warped it, 
                         suffocated it, and so
they're immortalized here- or, no, 
they're waxed.
               In the midst of these grown fat
these greasy fools, and emaciated, malicious monsters
how did you fall, 
                  Schiller? How about you, 
               Mozart? in luminous meadows; 
Should have come down among deep-woods flowers.
But you're here- my old buddies, 
Enemies-
         the whole damned lot. The enemies' looks are trying
To kill me, but it's not so bad, 
This not being liked
                     by Bismarck, and surely not
By Hitler. I keep looking, and gradually I see, 
Among them like fatal ghosts, 
                              the shaped, candle-stick figures
Of enemies still living. Yes. Still living.
There's one premier, 
There's another one, and he's
No shining example and he's not either.
But maybe they are examples: yes, 
but of the mean, the cruel, the phony. 
I'd like to get them here themselves, 
Into the wax museum by the scruff of the neck, 
By the seat of the britches! It'd be great
To arrange 'em according to their crimes-
And let 'em be buried in wax as ugly as they are! 
I tell you, the wax museum is wild
For more bums and bastards! 
                            Me, I'm sick and tired of 'em! Sons-of-bitches
Have been lying to us too damned long! 
It's time to drown 'em alive-
Right! In wax! 
               Let wax plaster their mouths
Shut, let it stop their hands
                              where they are
                                             and let them stand
Still, still very still
And dead like good little children very still, very
Obedient.
          Right here and now I'm coming out with my program
For revolution! I call on
EVERYONE! Drag 'em from their platform, 
And while you're doing it, laugh and whistle
As loud as you can! Go get 'em, 
People! Let's have a little more
Pure rage! 
           It's time to pull down all this trash
From their easy chairs
                       like pulling nails and being crazy
About pulling nails! 
                     It's time, under hot bright lights, 
To drag down out of their balconies
This collection of stupid faces
Like carp from scummy green pools.
It's time, it's really time at last
To get rid of junk like this! Into the wax museum
Of liars with these priests of a lousy temple! 
People! SAY IT! Don't clam up! 
                               Into the wax museum
With all heads of state
Who're headless! 
                 And if somebody lies, even
if he does it in a new way, then
Stuff his gullet with wax! 
                          Into the wax museum! 
There's still a lot of bullshit around, 
And plenty of liars.  Hey, 
BEES! Get off your ass! 
Wax, little brothers! We need it! 




Through throats where many rivers meet, the curlews cry,
Under the conceiving moon, on the high chalk hill,
And there this night I walk in the white giant's thigh
Where barren as boulders women lie longing still

To labour and love though they lay down long ago.

Through throats where many many rivers meet, the women pray,
Pleading in the waded bay for the seed to flow
Though the names on their weed grown stones are rained away,

And alone in the night's eternal, curving act
They yearn with tongues of curlews for the unconceived
And immemorial sons of the cudgelling, hacked

Hill. Who once in gooseskin winter loved all ice leaved
In the courters' lanes, or twined in the ox roasting sun
In the wains tonned so high that the wisps of the hay
Clung to the pitching clouds, or gay with any one
Young as they in the after milking moonlight lay

Under the lighted shapes of faith and their moonshade
Petticoats galed high, or shy with the rough riding boys,
Now clasp me to their grains in the gigantic glade,

Who once, green countries since, were a hedgerow of joys.

Time by, their dust was flesh the swineherd rooted sly,
Flared in the reek of the wiving sty with the rush
Light of his thighs, spreadeagle to the dunghill sky,
Or with their orchard man in the core of the sun's bush
Rough as cows' tongues and thrashed with brambles their buttermilk
Manes, under the quenchless summer barbed gold to the bone,

Or rippling soft in the spinney moon as the silk
And ducked and draked white lake that harps to a hail stone.

Who once were a bloom of wayside brides in the hawed house
And heard the lewd, wooed field flow to the coming frost,
The scurrying, furred small friars squeal, in the dowse
Of day, in the thistle aisles, till the white owl crossed

Their breast, the vaulting does roister, the horned bucks climb
Quick in the wood at love, where a torch of foxes foams,
All birds and beasts of the linked night uproar and chime

And the mole snout blunt under his pilgrimage of domes,
Or, butter fat goosegirls, bounced in a gambo bed,
Their breasts full of honey, under their gander king
Trounced by his wings in the hissing shippen, long dead
And gone that barley dark where their clogs danced in the spring,
And their firefly hairpins flew, and the ricks ran round--

(But nothing bore, no mouthing babe to the veined hives
Hugged, and barren and bare on Mother Goose's ground
They with the simple Jacks were a boulder of wives)--

Now curlew cry me down to kiss the mouths of their dust.

The dust of their kettles and clocks swings to and fro
Where the hay rides now or the bracken kitchens rust
As the arc of the billhooks that flashed the hedges low
And cut the birds' boughs that the minstrel sap ran red.
They from houses where the harvest kneels, hold me hard,
Who heard the tall bell sail down the Sundays of the dead
And the rain wring out its tongues on the faded yard,
Teach me the love that is evergreen after the fall leaved
Grave, after Beloved on the grass gulfed cross is scrubbed
Off by the sun and Daughters no longer grieved
Save by their long desires in the fox cubbed
Streets or hungering in the crumbled wood: to these
Hale dead and deathless do the women of the hill
Love for ever meridian through the courters' trees

And the daughters of darkness flame like Fawkes fires still. 

In the wilderness I sit
all alone
meditating on your wonders.

There is only the sky above.
The angels watch me when I pray.

Only in the aloneness 
I can lift up my heart and my brain

This aloneness 
gives me strength.
Let his Holy Name be praised. 

In the will of a man.
A broken life on the streets of Never.
In the will of a lady, 
Life just seems shady.
A grace of fire as she faces another day.
In the will of a child does their dreams add up.
Up to a step ahead of the crowd.
In the will of remembering.
Remember the days of the gone.
Grandparents, parents & the friends of the past.

Life in a dreams.
Life & all its mysteries of another life
born on the day of discovery.. 

In these latter-day,
Degenerate times,
   Cherry-blossoms everywhere!

In this Autumn of the year ther' be image
Divinite illustres. . 

Oui, l'utopie du Poete.
Flecks and shades, a bleeding hued spray 
Of Summer's closure. 

'cross the causway

In this Autumn of the year ther' be breeze
Whisp's feather red cheeks.  tip stiff lobes
Opposement to the gusts of Winter's sting
Autumn flails its limbs on goldened wings

In this Autumn of the year ther' be rainfall
A subtle, chilling mist. .. 

that feeds the soil
Preparing for the Harvest. .. 

Thanksgiving
Comes mornings frost, Decembers ringing

In this Autumn of the year. .. 

ther' be spice
Mother Natures encore. 


in full majesty
Hickory's flounce o'er ashed chimney tops
Country fairs, an' their sidewalk sale stops 

In this Autumn of the year ther' be romance
Love, that's shared beneath Harvest's Moon 
Spirit's dancing join ''Soul's'' of Hallows Eve
Cornucopia of nature- 'tis what Autumn be.

Wall Street stock prices have plummeted next to nothing, 
Our , and plans have lost more that half of their values.
The wars have exhausted our resources; no more fancy menus.
Downtown is like a ghost town, everybody is scared; nobody is shopping.

Big banks, who have ingeniously robbed us, are not lending money
To businesses, and to potential customers with immaculate credit.
The real estate market is in shambles, the perpetrator of this insanity.
Decent people are threatened to become homeless for bad debt.

Wall Street and Main Street collide; Main Street cannot take it anymore.
In this financial crisis, amidst this man-made tsunami, 
We all need a miracle; we all need help immediately; 
The last administration really fouled up to the core.

He is doing a super job and is using all sorts of avenues
To stimulate the economy, to create different venues; 

We still have hope; through hard works and discipline, 
We will see happier and better financial days again.
In this financial crisis, we all need the miracle of our prayers.




Rain falls like a silver glass shimmer
Swishing, sweeping, slipping, sliding
Over bushes and onto roofs and splattering on
Heads

Lying in my driveway with my mouth open
I embrace the rain
The refreshing cold, the inescapable wet, the intoxicating reality
The only sound is that of the swaying trees
And the dripping and dribbling of rain
Covering everything in a dream-like sheen
Pampering my nose
The smell of freshly fallen rain
Like wine to taste
Engulfs the world

And in this moment
There is no world

There is only rain
Grass
Sky
Me

Lifting my hands in praise, in adoration
Letting the clear droplets fall in my
Eyes
Belly button
Mouth

And it tastes far more real, far more alive
Than anything I have ever tasted


Can you listen to me my friend? 
Can you listen to me
when I play on my flute
benevolent notes of love? 
Can you listen to me my friend? 

Do you hear the music of sadness? 
Do you feel the sense of loss in my music? 
Do you hear the tiny drops of tears
that fall deep down in my soul? 

In this ocean of sadness
who will come to me to lift me up
when I play the  music of  love? 

(i lost my beloved niece yesterday. Her name was Manu. She was only  she died of cancer at such a young age. i was present for her burial. flying back to Germany i could not contain the sadness and wrote this poem. please pray my dear friends. thank you.  tony

we walk on the roof of hell,
gazing at flowers.




In time the wings of
- - - takes us to
another space.
Another day looms.
A room full of
many strangers.
Spaces, graces & aces.

A symphony of fire.
A symphony, as chariots of
fire light up this ocean.

In time we dream
per chance.
In time a dream
to hold.

Amy walking to a choco delight.
A time of romance.
A song of circumstance. 

A dance full of
stupid cupids.
Cupid's is on the rails.
The wind at your

A meal/steak with snails.
Sonic & tails.
A hedge hog.
Walk the dog.
London fog coming in.

In time of silver rain
The earth puts forth new life again,
Green grasses grow
And flowers lift their heads,
And over all the plain
The wonder spreads

Of Life,
Of Life,
Of life!

In time of silver rain
The butterflies lift silken wings
To catch a rainbow cry,
And trees put forth new leaves to sing
In joy beneath the sky
As down the roadway
Passing boys and girls
Go singing, too,

In time of silver rain When spring
And life
Are new. 

Who brought flowers to this grave?
I, said the wren.
I brought them as seeds and then
Watched them grow.

No, said the wind. That's not true.
I blew them across the moor and sea,
I blew them up to the grave's door.
They were a gift from me.

They came of their own accord,
Said the celandine.
I know best. They're brothers of mine.

I am Death's friend,
Said the crow. I ought to know.
I dropped them into the shadow of the leaning stone.
I brought the flowers.

No, said Love,
It was I who brought them,

With the help of the wren's wing,
With the help of the wind's breath,
With the help of the celandine and the crow.

It was I who brought them
For the living and the dead to share,
I was the force that put those flowers there. 

The weapon you used against me
That left me powerless
That made me blind: 
Your lips.
Like a puppet on strings
I would have done anything for you
As long as we sealed it 
With a single sinful kiss
The weapon that brought me to your knees
Your touch.
Holding my hand
Hands in my hair
I just couldn't get enough
And the weapon that pulled me in: 
Your eyes
The thing that helped mask
All your deadly lies.
It was like I was submerged in your ocean
Floating along
I didn't want to open my eyes
I didnt want to see
It was only when I started drowning
That I realized
I was in way too deep


I look at the swaling sunset 
And wish I could go also 
Through the red doors beyond the black-purple bar.

I wish that I could go 
Through the red doors where I could put off
My shame like shoes in the porch, 
My pain like garments, 
And leave my flesh discarded lying 
Like luggage of some departed traveller
Gone one knows not where.

Then I would turn round, 
And seeing my cast-off body lying like lumber,
I would laugh with joy. 

I Love to sit in the sun
And watch the foaming Lyell
Leap over its granite bed. 
I love these days that run 
On a burnished golden dial 
With the blue sky overhead.

I love to waken at night
And whisper the stars above me, 
And feel the fingering breeze. 
So still is the world, so right,
Where even the black pines love me, 
And the white moon guards my ease.

I love the upward ways
To the sun-tipped crest of the mountains
High over the billowy world; 
Where the wind sings hymns of praise,
And the snows break into fountains, 
And life is a flag unfurled.

I love—ah, beloved, what bliss 
Would shatter the ice like a river 
And sing all the way to the sea, 
If the world could be lost for this, 
And you from your sorrow forever 
Could rest on the heart of me 

Once upon a time I was sitting outside the cafe
watching twilight in Umbria when a girl came
out of the bakery with the bread her mother wanted.
She did not know what to do. Already bewildered
by being thirteen and just that summer a woman,
she now had to walk past the American.
But she did fine. Went by and around the corner
with style, not noticing me. Almost perfect.
At the last instant could not resist darting a look
down at her new breasts. Often I go back
to that dip of her head when people talk
about this one or that one of the great beauties. 



When things have reached the point of no return; 
When life's nadir is reached and you can't climb; 
When future looks uncertain gloomy, dark; 
When bridge to safety is not tread-worthy; 

When things have gone beyond the salvage stage; 
When odds are pitted heavily against; 
When all attempts for success were futile, 
When life looks dreary, meaningless to eke; 

When truth and facts can't help us anyway; 
When stage of verdict frightens and threatens; 
When things have gone too far to broker peace; 
When dialog was a wasted time and sums; 

Then hope still glimmers like a fading star; 
For He can do miracles if faith stays, 

through the green meadows
i reached the small chapel.

There in the silence 
I was happy.
All the angels around me were happy

My mother in heaven
smiled  from heaven.
I saw her smile in between 

I was filled with peace
which earth cannot give. 

With no cover ups, let me be frank
At times my mind goes utterly blank
When I sit down to write a poem
From topic to topic, my mind does roam
But nothing comes to spark off a rhyme
Often I feel the words do not chime
Today as I sat down to write something
I ended up conjuring nothing

No thoughts came to stir up my brain
And no topic I found save my strain
 But I wasn’t ready to willfully give up
And waited impatient for my mind to clear up
 I thought I shall settle with ‘Compassion’
But alas, it was charged with no passion

The urge to write had grown into a fad
And I felt I was growing altogether mad
Plagued by a fiery fancy to express
And a tormenting desire unable to suppress
With a mental state somewhat fierce
 I climbed up and down the stairs

I stood upside down and raked my head
So that a little poem, into it would be fed
Feeling dizzy, I stood suddenly upright
But on my head hung a heavy weight
I poured some water over my head
But knew my fever hadn’t fled
Madly pacing across the room
I tripped and fell down on a broom
Rising, I screamed with all my might
Making the household ring in fright
‘What the hell is it? ’ I did shout
And wriggled in pain as from gout
In mad frenzy, I ran round the house
No one knew the reason for my fuss
Soon it dawned on me that I needed some rest
For I was far more than stressed
So I sat down and closed my eyes
Thinking, attempting to squeeze out a poem is unwise

I don’t know how long I sat in meditation
On waking up I got a fresh direction
From the grip of an entangling rigour
I restored my sanity and vigour

The sun had gone out of sight
And the moon was beautiful and bright
It was already growing late
And I put off my futile fight


The stars in the sky
In vain
The tragedy of Hamlet
   In vain
The key in the lock
      In vain
The sleeping mother
      In vain
The lamp in the corner
         In vain
The lamp in the corner unlit
            In vain
Abraham Lincoln
                        In vain
The Aztec empire
                           In vain
The writing hand: in vain 
(The shoetrees in the shoes
         In vain
The windowshade string upon
            the hand bible
   In vain—
   The glitter of the greenglass
         ashtray
In vain
The bear in the woods
         In vain
The Life of Buddha
         In vain)She still smiled, 
even when she knew, 
life looped over her, 
like a hangman’s noose.
Imagined it was a melody she heard, 
in the rising cadence of a dirge.
But in her laughter was the echo, 
of smothered sighs, shot involuntary, 
from the corked up bottle of her heart.
In a hilarious company, she languished
like a cockle in the shell.
Seemed so calm
when a sizzling inferno burnt within! 
Tears, long held back
froze and hardened within her eye pits.
She is now a total stranger to herself! 

On the beach, 
as the sunset hurled ecstasy
across the skies, 
she only saw the virulent waves
lashing on the shore
and their tug, inviting.
On the way back, with an eerie interest, 
She often watched water lilies, 
withering in pools and ponds! 

Neither cursed nor moaned
over her soiled identity; 
but wondered why only discordant tunes
now came out from her flute
on which, once her rehearsed lips
created such harmonious melody! 

Under her calm demeanour, 
was veiled craftily
the anguish of a life time.

Yet in pitch darkness, 
counting the luminous stars
in the firmament, 
she lay-
a seed in wait
under furrowed lands
for the first summer shower

What are you doing here, poet, on the ruins
Of St. John's Cathedral this sunny
Day in spring?

What are you thinking here, where the wind
Blowing from the Vistula scatters
The red dust of the rubble?

You swore never to be
A ritual mourner.
You swore never to touch
The deep wounds of your nation
So you would not make them holy
With the accursed holiness that pursues
Descendants for many centuries.

But the lament of Antigone
Searching for her brother
Is indeed beyond the power
Of endurance. And the heart
Is a stone in which is enclosed,
Like an insect, the dark love
Of a most unhappy land.
I did not want to love so.
That was not my design.
I did not want to pity so.
That was not my design.
My pen is lighter
Than a hummingbird's feather. This burden
Is too much for it to bear.
How can I live in this country
Where the foot knocks against
The unburied bones of kin?

I hear voices, see smiles. I cannot
Write anything; five hands
Seize my pen and order me to write
The story of their lives and deaths.
Was I born to become
a ritual mourner?
I want to sing of festivities,
The greenwood into which Shakespeare
Often took me. Leave
To poets a moment of happiness,
Otherwise your world will perish.

It's madness to live without joy
And to repeat to the dead
Whose part was to be gladness
Of action in thought and in the flesh, singing, feasts
Only the two salvaged words:
Truth and justice. 


Tread softly here; the sacredest of tombs 
Are facile accidents of Time and Chance. 
Chance sets them on the heights, they climb not there! 
But he who from the darkling mass of men 
Is on the wing of heavenly thought upborne 
To finer ether, and becomes a voice 
His name shall be a star, his grave a shrine.


Tread softly here, in silent reverence tread. 
Beneath those marble cenotaphs and urns 
Lies richer dust than ever nature hid 
Packed in the mountain's adamantine heart, 
Or slyly wrapt in unsuspected sand-- 
The dross men toil for, and oft stain the soul. 
How vain and all ignoble seems that greed 
To him who stands in this dim claustral air 
With these most sacred ashes at his feet! 
This dust was Chaucer, Spenser, Dryden this-- 
The spark that once illumed it lingers still. 
O ever-hallowed spot of English earth! 
If the unleashed and unhappy spirit of man 
Have option to visit our dull globe, 
What august Shades at midnight here convene 
In the miraculous sessions of the moon, 
When the great pulse of London faintly throbs, 
And one by one the stars in heaven pale


Moonlight & owl
create the moment
in which this kiss exists
like a secret
(told shyly)  

or a bell
excitedly telling its tale
to the listening silence
moonlight & owl
create the moment

in which
we exist
trembling
inside this kiss. 


A dented spider like a snow drop white
On a white Heal-all, holding up a moth
Like a white piece of lifeless satin cloth -
Saw ever curious eye so strange a sight? -
Portent in little, assorted death and blight
Like the ingredients of a witches' broth? -
The beady spider, the flower like a froth,
And the moth carried like a paper kite.

What had that flower to do with being white,
The blue prunella every child's delight.
What brought the kindred spider to that height?
(Make we no thesis of the miller's plight.)
What but design of darkness and of night?
Design, design! Do I use the word aright

in you i couldn't look through
my eyes want it to see you, 
but the hallows sorrounds you
gives me narrow tattoo.
 
in you two feet cripples
and hands riddle to hold you, 
for i like you to catch me too
that Im longing to reach you.
 
in you i keep myself like a shadow
indeed, im happy to see you
ripping my thoughts to miss you, 
and let me say it again, i really do miss you! 
 
in you i wanna ask sorry
that created this kind of untold story
but if you give me chance
the answer is - In You.  

Little
rose,
roselet,
at times,
tiny and naked,
it seems
as though you would fit
in one of my hands,
as though I’ll clasp you like this
and carry you to my mouth,
but
suddenly
my feet touch your feet and my mouth your lips:
you have grown,
your shoulders rise like two hills,
your breasts wander over my breast,
my arm scarcely manages to encircle the thin
new-moon line of your waist:
in love you loosened yourself like sea water:
I can scarcely measure the sky’s most spacious eyes
and I lean down to your mouth to kiss the earth. 

In Your Eyes: Many Journeys in C Flat

I see in your eyes many dawns
Of promenade on the white beach lawns, 
Heavily sedated by the tropical aura, 
You and I facing the sea, you and facing the flora. 

At times, arms in arms, walking on the sands, 
Intermittently, hands in hands; 
Splashed in the warm air like two lost toads
Relaxing under some types of exotic roads.

A few hours before the arrival of midday, 
The raw melody of calypso was caressing our ears; 
We found ourselves enjoying wine and beers, 
 Under the shadow of a festive Saturday.

Patiently, we waited for the DJ to play some compas direct, 
Jazz, Soucousse, Reggae and salsa, 
Oh! That was an afternoon of fun with my diva! 

After the last sighing of the angelus, 
Came the splashing and floating in the pool for an hour, 
While diner was being kept warm on the burner, 
The roosters were singing not too far from the mini-bus.   

As always the cognac was divine and the dinner delicious; 
One more roll on the beach under the charms of the waves; 
We crisscrossed hands on the hips, many melodious
Rhythms were charming the boas hiding in the makeshift caves.

Somewhat tired and relaxed on the velvety bed, 
Under the pearly bright stars, you and I were drowning.
Shuttered curtains and under the moon lights quasi red, 
You and I were snoozing in the symphony of Beethoven

On the screen of your eyes, I watch
An eternal dream. On our path, 
I see love, the will to enjoy to the fullest
Life and the syrup of the poems at rest.








His eyes beguiled, 
From you he throbs
With waves of joy
Like dawn's cool air.
On you adorned, 
He views vivid
Stars of sheer bliss, 
For you do bloom
In his heart, warm
As the apt spring.
Sparkle you do
Like gold in eyes
Of his that soared
Projectile-like
To the sky's peak. 

In your mother's womb you vowed 
not to be born again.
When will you recall the vow ?

And die, even while alive 
(to all desire, and be released from birth and death): 
Great honor will be yours in this life and greater honor after death. 

Keep your palms together
and pray silently.

Close your eyes.
who loves all, without partiality.

In your weakness, my strength will shine.

I believe in these words.
I kneel down with lifted hands.

Pray always whenever you can
Pray more.  Worry less. 

How often we forget all time, when lone 
Admiring Nature's universal throne; 
Her woods - her winds - her mountains - the intense 
Reply of Hers to Our intelligence! 

I. 

In youth I have known one with whom the Earth 
 In secret communing held - as he with it, 
In daylight, and in beauty, from his birth: 
 Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit 
From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth 
 A passionate light - such for his spirit was fit - 
And yet that spirit knew - not in the hour 
Of its own fervour - what had o'er it power. 

                    II. 

Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought 
 To a fever by the moonbeam that hangs o'er, 
But I will half believe that wild light fraught 
 With more of sovereignty than ancient lore 
Hath ever told - or is it of a thought 
 The unembodied essence, and no more 
That with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass 
As dew of the night time, o'er the summer grass? 

                    III. 

Doth o'er us pass, when as th' expanding eye 
 To the loved object - so the tear to the lid 
Will start, which lately slept in apathy? 
 And yet it need not be - (that object) hid 
From us in life - but common - which doth lie 
 Each hour before us - but then only bid 
With a strange sound, as of a harpstring broken 
T' awake us - 'Tis a symbol and a token - 

                     IV. 

Of what in other worlds shall be - and given 
Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven 
 Drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone, 
That high tone of the spirit which hath striven 
 Though not with Faith - with godliness - whose throne 
With desperate energy 't hath beaten down; 
Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown.

an invisible connect, 
between
two hearts in love.
Conjuring 
wonders out of the blue
of which
others have no clue, 
Making the presence
magnetic
Rendering everything 
electric.
Concealed
from others
Hardly perceived
by anyone 
Rarely identified! 

But, 
an inaudible language
speaks it aloud, 
the language
of the eyes
the language
of the heart

A glitter
in the cornea
A flutter 
of the eyelid
An accelerated
rhythm
making the heart
heave
high and low
If observed intent

When in dark despair drowned
I was thinking, joy was nowhere around
A gentle breeze from the upland peaks	
Came and patted on my cheeks
Softly whispering- ‘joy is now here’

When the last ray of hope had been snuffed out
From the vapid plane of my arid heart, 
A cluster of orchids, beautiful and gay
Smilingly nodding their heads on my way
Sweetly murmured- ‘joy is now here

When I feared the earth was caving in
Under my feet with no chance to win
A butterfly with rainbow colors
Alighting on a bunch of flowers
Euphoniously hummed- ‘joy is now here’

When all my yearnings got shattered
And sustenance alone was what mattered
The blazing sun from behind the hills
Wiping away all morbid chills
Beamingly affirmed-‘joy is now here

When I thought I was drifting afloat
Without any moorings on my boat
A crystal drop precariously balancing
On the serrated edge of a leaf dancing
Playfully chimed-‘joy is now here’

When darkness settles on the scene
When life loses all tinge of green
When days seem inert and grey
Don’t be in a hurry to say
"Joy is nowhere around"

Before you jump to conclusions dismal
And write off life as abysmal
Wait to see the cycle of seasons change
From winter’s haze to spring’s lovesome range

Midway
over the Atlantic

the Starship Enterprise
gets hit up by

a Romulain warship.

They're not sure
if the deflector shields

can.  

take it! 

We too
tumblle from side to side

tossed by
turbulence

like a child's 
toy

flying boldly to
New York. 

Human reason is beautiful and invincible.
No bars, no barbed wire, no pulping of books,
No sentence of banishment can prevail against it.
It establishes the universal ideas in language,
And guides our hand so we write Truth and Justice
With capital letters, lie and oppression with small.
It puts what should be above things as they are,
Is an enemy of despair and a friend of hope.
It does not know Jew from Greek or slave from master,
Giving us the estate of the world to manage.
It saves austere and transparent phrases
From the filthy discord of tortured words.
It says that everything is new under the sun,
Opens the congealed fist of the past.
Beautiful and very young are Philo-Sophia
And poetry, her ally in the service of the good.
As late as yesterday Nature celebrated their birth,
The news was brought to the mountains by a unicorn and an echo.
Their friendship will be glorious, their time has no limit.
Their enemies have delivered themselves to destruction. 

A white well 
In a black cave; 
A bright shell 
In a dark wave.

A white rose 
Black brambles hood; 
Smooth bright snows 
In a dark wood.

A flung white glove 
In a dark fight; 
A white dove 
On a wild black night.

A white door 
In a dark lane; 
A bright core 
To bitter black pain.

A white hand 
Waved from dark walls; 
In a burnt black land 
Bright waterfalls.

A bright spark 
Where black ashes are; 
In the smothering dark 
One white star. 

Incarnate devil in a talking snake,
The central plains of Asia in his garden,
In shaping-time the circle stung awake,
In shapes of sin forked out the bearded apple,
And played down pardon from the heavens' hill.

When we were strangers to the guided seas,
A handmade moon half holy in a cloud,
The wisemen tell me that the garden gods
Twined good and evil on an eastern tree;
And when the moon rose windily it was
Black as the beast and paler than the cross.

We in our Eden knew the secret guardian
In sacred waters that no frost could harden,
And in the mighty mornings of the earth;
Hell in a horn of sulphur and the cloven myth,
All heaven in the midnight of the sun,
A serpent fiddled in the shaping-time. 

Our image of delight,   
Which whitens east and gleams   
And beckons from the height,   
Takes on her human form—is here in mortal sight.           
 
We two have loved her long,   
Have known her eyes for years;   
We worshipped her with song   
The spirit only hears,   
And now she comes to us new-washed with blood and tears.           
 
Her radiant self she veils   
With vesture meet for earth,   
And, knowing all, inhales   
The lethal air of birth,   
And wakes to restless dreams of misery and mirth.           
 
The fogs of learning rise   
And hide the light above,   
But in her steadfast eyes   
Will shine the light of love,   
Which many a gloomy dale may know the gladness of.           
 
What gift is ours to give,   
What truth is ours to teach   
That she may learn to live   
With joy within her reach?   
We can but let her learn the sound of human speech.           
 
By custom-fettered fools   
Her freedom will be blamed,   
Because by sleepy rules   
Her soul shall be untamed,   
And she will front the sun brown-skinned and unashamed.           
 
Her kinship she will know   
With beast and rock and tree,   
Wherever she may go   
The sky her home will be,   
The winds will be her mates, 
her crooning nurse the sea. 

That one small boy with a face like pallid cheese 
And burnt-out little eyes could make a blaze 
As brazen, fierce and huge, as red and gold 
And zany yellow as the one that spoiled 
Three thousand guineas' worth of property 
Is frightening---as fact and metaphor: 
An ordinary match intended for 
The lighting of a pipe or kitchen fire 
Misused may set a whole menagerie 
Of flame-fanged tigers roaring hungrily. 
And frightening, too, that one small boy should set 
The sky on fire and choke the stars to heat 
Such skinny limbs and such a little heart 
Which would have been content with one warm kiss 
Had there been anyone to offer this.

No stir in the air, no stir in the sea, 
The Ship was still as she could be; 
Her sails from heaven received no motion, 
Her keel was steady in the ocean. 

Without either sign or sound of their shock, 
The waves flow’d over the Inchcape Rock; 
So little they rose, so little they fell, 
They did not move the Inchcape Bell.

The Abbot of Aberbrothok 
Had placed that bell on the Inchcape Rock; 
On a buoy in the storm it floated and swung, 
And over the waves its warning rung.

When the Rock was hid by the surge’s swell, 
The Mariners heard the warning Bell; 
And then they knew the perilous Rock, 
And blest the Abbot of Aberbrothok

The Sun in the heaven was shining gay, 
All things were joyful on that day; 
The sea-birds scream’d as they wheel’d round, 
And there was joyaunce in their sound. 

The buoy of the Inchcpe Bell was seen
A darker speck on the ocean green; 
Sir Ralph the Rover walk’d his deck, 
And fix’d his eye on the darker speck. 

He felt the cheering power of spring, 
It made him whistle, it made him sing; 
His heart was mirthful to excess, 
But the Rover’s mirth was wickedness. 

His eye was on the Inchcape Float; 
Quoth he, "My men, put out the boat, 
And row me to the Inchcape Rock, 
And I’ll plague the Abbot of Aberbrothok." 

The boat is lower’d, the boatmen row, 
And to the Inchcape Rock they go; 
Sir Ralph bent over from the boat, 
And he cut the bell from the Inchcape Float.

Down sank the Bell with a gurgling sound, 
The bubbles rose and burst around; 
Quoth Sir Ralph, "The next who comes to the Rock,
Won’t bless the Abbot of Aberbrothok." 

Sir ralph the Rover sail’d away, 
He scour’d the seas for many a day; 
And now grown rich with plunder’d store, 
He steers his course for Scotland’s shore. 

So thick a haze o’erspreads the sky, 
They cannot see the sun on high; 
The wind hath blown a gale all day, 
At evening it hath died away. 

On the deck the Rover takes his stand, 
So dark it is they see no land. 
Quoth Sir Ralph, "It will be lighter soon, 
For there is the dawn of the rising Moon." 

"Canst hear," said one, "the breakers roar? 
For methinks we should be near the shore." 
"Now, where we are I cannot tell, 
But I wish we could hear the Inchcape Bell." 

They hear no sound, the swell is strong, 
Though the wind hath fallen they drift along; 
Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock, 

Sir Ralph the Rover tore his hair, 
He curst himself in his despair; 
The waves rush in on every side, 
The ship is sinking beneath the tide. 

But even is his dying fear, 
One dreadful sound could the Rover hear; 
A sound as if with the Inchcape Bell, 
The Devil below was ringing his knell. 

Once riding in old Baltimore,
    Heart-filled, head-filled with glee,
I saw a Baltimorean
    Keep looking straight at me.

Now I was eight and very small,
    And he was no whit bigger,
And so I smiled, but he poked out
    His tongue, and called me, 'Nigger.'

I saw the whole of Baltimore
    From May until December;
Of all the things that happened there
    That's all that I remember. 

We tell the story every year—
how we peered from the windows, shades drawn—
though nothing really happened,
the charred grass now green again.
We peered from the windows, shades drawn,
the charred grass still green. Then
we darkened our rooms, lit the hurricane lamps.
a few men gathered, white as angels in their gowns.
We darkened our rooms and lit hurricane lamps,
the wicks trembling in their fonts of oil.
It seemed the angels had gathered, white men in their gowns.
When they were done, they left quietly. No one came.
The wicks trembled all night in their fonts of oil;
by morning the flames had all dimmed.
When they were done, the men left quietly. No one came.
Nothing really happened.
By morning all the flames had dimmed.
We tell the story every year. 

ON his morning rounds the Master
Goes to learn how all things fare;
Searches pasture after pasture,
Sheep and cattle eyes with care;
And, for silence or for talk,
He hath comrades in his walk;
Four dogs, each pair of different breed,
Distinguished two for scent, and two for speed.

See a hare before him started!
--Off they fly in earnest chase; 
Every dog is eager-hearted,
All the four are in the race:
And the hare whom they pursue,
Knows from instinct what to do;
Her hope is near: no turn she makes;
But, like an arrow, to the river takes.

Deep the river was, and crusted
Thinly by a one night's frost;
But the nimble Hare hath trusted
To the ice, and safely crost; 
She hath crost, and without heed
All are following at full speed,
When, lo! the ice, so thinly spread,
Breaks--and the greyhound, DART, is overhead!

Better fate have PRINCE and SWALLOW--
See them cleaving to the sport!
MUSIC has no heart to follow,
Little MUSIC, she stops short.
She hath neither wish nor heart,
Hers is now another part: 
A loving creature she, and brave!
And fondly strives her struggling friend to save.

From the brink her paws she stretches,
Very hands as you would say!
And afflicting moans she fetches,
As he breaks the ice away.
For herself she hath no fears,--
Him alone she sees and hears,--
Makes efforts with complainings; nor gives o'er
Until her fellow sinks to re-appear no more. 

O my aged Uncle Arly!
Sitting on a heap of Barley
Thro' the silent hours of night,
Close beside a leafy thicket:
On his nose there was a Cricket,
In his hat a Railway-ticket
(But his shoes were far too tight).

Long ago, in youth, he squander'd
All his goods away, and wander'd
To the Tinskoop-hills afar.
There on golden sunsets blazing,
Every evening found him gazing,
Singing, 'Orb! you're quite amazing!
How I wonder what you are!'

Like the ancient Medes and Persians,
Always by his own exertions
He subsisted on those hills;
Whiles, by teaching children spelling,
Or at times by merely yelling,
Or at intervals by selling
'Propter's Nicodemus Pills.'

Later, in his morning rambles
He perceived the moving brambles
Something square and white disclose;
'Twas a First-class Railway-Ticket;
But, on stooping down to pick it
Off the ground - a pea-green Cricket
Settled on my uncle's Nose.

Never - never more - oh, never,
Did that Cricket leave him ever,
Dawn or evening, day or night;
Clinging as a constant treasure,
Chirping with a cheerious measure,
Wholly to my uncle's pleasure
(Though his shoes were far too tight).

So for three and forty winters,
Till his shoes were worn to splinters,
All those hills he wander'd o'er,
Sometimes silent; sometimes yelling;
Till he came to Borley-Melling,
Near his old ancestral dwelling
(But his shoes were far too tight).

On a little heap of Barley
Died my aged Uncle Arly,
And they buried him one night;
Close beside the leafy thicket;
There - his hat and Railway-Ticket;
There - his ever-faithful Cricket
(But his shoes were far too tight). 

Higher there, higher, far from the ways,
from the farms and the valleys, beyond the trees,
beyond the hills and the grasses’ haze,
far from the herd-trampled tapestries,
you discover a sombre pool in the deep
that a few bare snow-covered mountains form.
The lake, in light’s, and night’s, sublime sleep,
is never disturbed in its silent storm.
In that mournful waste, to the unsure ear,
come faint drawn-out sounds, more dead than the bell,
of some far-off cow, the echoes unclear,
as it grazes the slope, of a distant dell.
On those hills where the wind effaces all signs,
on those glaciers, fired by the sun’s pure light,
on those rocks, where dizziness threatens the mind,
in that lake’s vermilion presage of night,
under my feet, and above my head, 
silence, that makes you wish to escape;
that eternal silence, of the mountainous bed
of motionless air, where everything waits.
You would say that the sky, in its loneliness,
gazed at itself in the glass, and, up there,
the mountains listened, in grave watchfulness
to the mystery nothing that’s human can hear.
And when, by chance, a wandering cloud
darkens the silent lake, moving by,
you might think that you saw some spirit’s robe,
or else its clear shadow, travelling, over the sky. 

What is it you want from me, 
what have I to boast? 
Forgive me if I don't have
what it is you want the most.
There's not much I can do
when expectations rise too high, 
all that I can ever do
is present my finest try.
Some people don't acknowledge that
they shove my efforts away, 
and scream 'you are nothing! '
as if those words do not weigh
so heavily upon me, 
I think about them in my bed, 
they cling to me like glue.
I never ever ever forget
though I pretend that I've moved on.
Those words did truly thwart me
and my confidence has gone.
I wish that everyone could just accept
that I am not that strong.
I can only dance to one beat, 
and only sing to one song. 

When I think about you, my heart just breaks.
Or atleast I think it does, my heart just aches.
When I see how happy you are, I must admit.
I ask myself,  will I find happiness? 
When I talk about you, my words are lies.
My tone of voice like stone, like ice. 
When I dream about you, I do not wake.
For in my dreams, things have changed.

incomplete. . 

Life surrounding the creation
floats in an incompleteness and hollowness
parch the melody of life
attune  inabstinence of life
choosing stones instead of flower
finishes the life from births to its decay
sings a melancholic song
throughout the life lacking perfection
life can not be completed
during one life time, rather
it is completed after death
by the followers and inmates
by remembering the work
and renovating the residual. 

When this world

is no longer worth living, 

how do you convince him

not to take that final breath? 

 

With the razor in his hand, 

and tears running down his cheek, 

letters from you

beside that hateful poison.

Taunting him

to run that blade

down his veins.

 

The words that he writes, 

on the wall in his room, 

breaks my heart.

would even break yours.

 

Would you die with me, 

when this life

is no longer worth living? 

Would you die with me, 

when this world

is no longer worth living? 

 

How do you convince yourself

not to take that final breath

INCREASING TERRORISM
Terrorist attack in Ahmedabad
Which will be the next target? 
Govt. is blaming Huzi & simmi & other terrorist organizations.
Why they are killing innocent people by fixing bombs in this way? 
Many Islamic organizations are condemning them.
Still they are doing these shameful killings.
Now time has come to combat such organization on roads and on ideological front also.
Time has come to teach them that their acts are fruitless & in last will go in vein.
On the earth we want peace, food & harmony.
Fights for religious supremacy are not a good thing.
Their wars have been called religious war in the history.
 What result has come up to now? 
Only blood shed, arson, & killings have come in the lap of the human society. 
So we must live as little flowers are living with joy in this world. 

The new world honors him whose lofty plea
For England's freedom made her own more sure,
Whose song, immortal as its theme, shall be
Their common freehold while both worlds endure.

Indeed indeed, I cannot tell, 
Though I ponder on it well, 
Which were easier to state, 
All my love or all my hate. 
Surely, surely, thou wilt trust me 
When I say thou dost disgust me. 
O, I hate thee with a hate 
That would fain annihilate; 
Yet sometimes against my will, 
My dear friend, I love thee still. 
It were treason to our love, 
One iota to abate 
Of a pure impartial hate. 

I never did, I never did,
I never did like "Now take care, dear!"
I never did, I never did,
I never did want "Hold-my-hand";
I never did, I never did,
I never did think much of "Not up there, dear!"
It's no good saying it.
They don't understand. 

Come to my arms --- is it eve? is it morn? 
Is Apollo awake? Is Diana reborn? 
Are the streams in full song? Do the woods whisper hush 
Is it the nightingale? Is it the thrush? 
Is it the smile of the autumn, the blush 
Of the spring? Is the world full of peace or alarms? 
Come to my arms, Laylah, come to my arms! 

Come to my arms, though the hurricane blow. 
Thunder and summer, or winter and snow, 
It is one to us, one, while our spirits are curled 
In the crimson caress: we are fond, we are furled 
Like lilies away from the war of the world. 
Are there spells beyond ours? Are there alien charms? 
Come to my arms, Laylah, come to my arms! 

Come to my arms! is it life? is it death? 
Is not all immortality born of your breath? 
Are not heaven and hell but as handmaids of yours 
Who are all that enflames, who are all that allures, 
Who are all that destroys, who are all that endures? 
I am yours, do I care if it heals me or harms? 
Come to my arms, Laylah, come to my arms

Reach out to the leaves
As they fall from the trees
All at once the wind makes them run

They fly off alone
Each on their own
To wherever the breeze sends them

Now free to roam
Away from their home
Declaring their own independence


Independence, power of
Freely thinking and doing
Is birth right of each of
Human and living being, 
In the world for well living, 
But some who interfere
Anyway they are not fair.




Muzahidul Reza
for the sake of land; 
I killed mine, 
because he was not a believer.

Am I a human, 
or just belong to
certain race, religion, sect, ideology or tribe? 

Am I a free man, 
or just trapped in the self-created, six feet coffin
of pseudo-pride? 

I know not
either you are righteous
or I am truthful.

I just know
we are celebrating
our independence day
in the midst of
self-imposed bloodshed, 
corrupt leadership, 
on-sale dignity, 
mocking poverty, 
and dying morality.


 Columbia, the pride of the earth! 
We crown you with song- wreath and story; 
 We honour the day of your birth! 

The wrath of a king and his minions
 You braved, to be free, on that day; 
And the eagle sailed up on strong pinions, 
 And frightened the lion at bay.

Since the chains and the shackles are broken, 
 And citizens now replace slaves, 
Since the hearts of your heros have spoken
 How dear they held freedom - by graves.

Your beautiful banner is blotless
 As it floats to the breezes unfurled, 
And but for one blemish, all spotless
 Is the record you show to the world.

Like a scar on the features of beauty, 
 Lies Utah, sin-cursed to the west.
Columbia! Columbia! your duty
 Is to wipe out that stain with the rest! 

Not only in freedom, and science, 
 And letters, should you lead the earth; 
But let the earth learn your reliance
 In honour and true moral worth.

When Liberty's torch shall be lighted, 
 Let her brightest most far-reaching rays
Discover no wrong thats unrighted -
 Go challenge the jealous world's gaze! 

Columbia, your star is ascending! 
 Columbia, all lands own your sway! 
May your reign be as proud and unrending
 As your glory is brilliant today. 

The fact is i become suspicious, when i look at them,
in the mirror, hence i don't have money to eradicate them.

Independence we want in our lives path, 
No one hinders us we go on our math.

Daily life is easier as we have freedom, 
India provides us ever even to dumb, 
Accompany the people and live with hum. 

Oh! in India May and June
have the burning noon.
As time goes after sun rise
horror of heat do terrorise.
Dresses are wet in the sweat
it’s hard to go out in heat.
Heat waves and heat stroke
facing summer is not a joke.
Ponds and pools are dried
in the mud fishes are fried.
Thirsty birds animals plants
shade and water each wants.
‘Rabi’ crop harvesting is over
fields are free for rollover.
Farmers preserve food grains
to consume in period of vain.
Young hearts are yet vibrant 
marriage mantras are chant.
Children enjoy, schools closed
chance of excursion and explore. 

Oh the wonders of technology two countries worlds away, 
Toyota & Honda, most popular vehicles on the road today, 
But, when jobs are outsourced the bulk of which will go, 
Employment ends where advancement has failed to grow.

Power to poverty ratio is the worse in known civilization, 
Substance for advancement is on par with those Haitians, 
Nuclear capabilities enable them equal in deadly power, 
But, in fairness one is middle class earning $an hour.

You’d be hard pressed to find luxury rolling off the line, 
The Lexus Hybrid or lunch $to a couple of dimes, 
million dollar bonus (grand)  for Japan’s middle class, 
years to make in India, closing the gap extremely fast? 

Do what you’ve always done, be where you’ve always been, 
Whereas, Japan has turned defeat into a global economic den, 
Pakistan’s neighbor is still struggling despite outsourced jobs, 
But in America usually guns & knives are used to be robbed.

That difference betwixt the two is enormous enough, so tell, 
Who to call for expert advice when things aren’t going well? 
Problems arise, do we seek the most knowledgeable we can? 
Mo money, mo money, explains why it’s India & not Japan. 

What happened to the boy I was?
Why did he run away?
And leave me old and thinking, like
There'd been no yesterday?
What happened then?
Was I that boy?
Who laughed and swam in the bund*
I there no going back?
No recompense?
Is there nothing?
No refund

EYES ravished with rapture, celestially panting, what passionate bosoms aflaming with fire 
Drink deep of the hush of the hyacinth heavens that glimmer around them in fountains of light; 
O wild and entrancing the strain of keen music that cleaveth the stars like a wail of desire, 
And beautiful dancers with houri-like faces bewitch the voluptuous watches of night.


The scents of red roses and sandalwood flutter and die in the maze of their gem-tangled hair, 
And smiles are entwining like magical serpents the poppies of lips that are opiate-sweet; 
Their glittering garments of purple are burning like tremulous dawns in the quivering air, 
And exquisite, subtle and slow are the tinkle and tread of their rhythmical, slumber-soft feet.


Now silent, now singing and swaying and swinging, like blossoms that bend to the breezes or showers, 
Now wantonly winding, they flash, now they falter, and, lingering, languish in radiant choir; 
Their jewel-girt arms and warm, wavering, lily-long fingers enchant through melodious hours, 
Eyes ravished with rapture, celestially panting, what passionate bosoms aflaming with fire

Most water is drained 
to the pot of corruption 
glass remains empty


Costly school college
admission yet difficult 
education cess


She

LIKE a serpent to the calling voice of flutes, 
Glides my heart into thy fingers, O my Love! 
Where the night-wind, like a lover, leans above 
His jasmine-gardens and sirisha-bowers; 
And on ripe boughs of many-coloured fruits 
Bright parrots cluster like vermilion flowers. 


He

Like the perfume in the petals of a rose, 
Hides thy heart within my bosom, O my love! 
Like a garland, like a jewel, like a dove 
That hangs its nest in the asoka-tree. 
Lie still, O love, until the morning sows 
Her tents of gold on fields of ivory. 

British infants who were nobly born
Were from their bleeding mother's bosom torn
And with the bayonet dashed upon the street
There left to lie for native dogs to eat. 

But the British Lion he soon o'erthrew
Both the high and the low Hindoo ;
For fear of British Lion's paws. 

INDIAN POETSLook before and beyond
	Twin Towers
Weary webs waste vision
        Work on mission.

Much blood has blown
Under the bridge of peace
Human bones are its pillars
Constructed by the body
It leads between hell and heaven
Poets will write a verse 
On the architect of it
Wow with their rhyme and wit.

Unforgettable Guru Ram and Rahim
Moved in heaven
As their followers
Chopped into pieces
Scattered across borders
For the vultures to prick its beak
And wild animals to tear

 Ten million Indians
Were killed by the ruffians
And tens of thousands were
Strung from trees
On highway and
Village squares-
With the bodies left
To rot and
Stern action threatened
Against any attempt
To take them down
For cremation or burial.
Does it provoke to write an elegy? 

The massacre at Jallianwala Bagh
And aerial bombing
And strafing of cities
Our heart does not ache
Where is wail? 

Over five million Jews were killed
Between and As sheep and goats are slaughtered
Historians mind jolted
No more poetry by the poets
Let us crease conscience

Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Ruins and bruises
In the pages of history
Why do you forget or
Think a mystery? 

Innocent men and women
Children and the old 
Patients and frail
Are killed in Iraq
And Philistine
They are also
Of blood and flesh
Body and soul
Creatures of Almighty.
Is your pen paralyzed
Or lie in wait for accolades? 

No wail, sighs, tears
Or cries – your pen bears
What has blindfold
Your vision
Unclear reason! 
Has the prejudiced pen
Lost its thunder and lightening spirit? 

Oh bravo of bravos! 
Architect of the soul
Like to be called
Saints, seers and sages
Redeemer of gloom
Messiah of Love and Peace! 
Stir up your conscience of your pen
Or will it sink in tears? 

No distinction of caste
Or religion
Barrier of language or region
Never fear of demon
Is it Herculean task
In judging the culprit
To condemn in true spirit? 

Money and mansions are meager
Spirit, character, conduct, 
And humanistic wisdom is caliber.

Indian poets will rise
To the majestic heights
Spread cosmic lights
With their dazzling
Prophetic words
To give up canons
And swords! ! ! 

Poet’s pen tells the truth
His ink cultivates congenial culture
For His creatures to collocate
His words spread fair feelings
And verses cure sufferings

India


Indian Republic sixty four
Democratic fruits enjoyed to core
Democratic rights availed in full
Democratic values laid in lull! 

Rights yielded place to a free license
License to indulge in deeds nonsense
Nonsense leading to atrocities
Beyond all due sensitivities! 

Achievements galore, pride on one hand
Atrocities galore, ashamed we stand! 

Corrupted mind, stained thoughts, evil deeds
Here and there, everywhere, pity indeed! 

Our success and failure, good and bad
Who is responsible- sure I am! 
R-day resolve- to all should be same! 
"Let me mend my mind, tame my thought
With power of will, evils to be fought
Sure allow not my  Motherland rot

Along the line of smoky hills
The crimson forest stands,
And all the day the blue-jay calls
Throughout the autumn lands.

Now by the brook the maple leans
With all his glory spread,
And all the sumachs on the hills
Have turned their green to red.

Now by great marshes wrapt in mist,
Or past some river's mouth,
Throughout the long, still autumn day
Wild birds are flying south. 

A mature apple was in my hand, 
the season of wisdom was on the Land.
The mornings were pure glass, 
the dew was still on the grass.
Amber and red colors were background of blue, 
to warm countries the birds flew.
Spreading maple has turned red, 
he was afraid to lose his head, 
as he was in unrequited love with the rowan.
How much he wanted her to be his woman.
There was no leaves sough, 
the webs lace has wreathed around the bough.
The sunbeams ran among the trees, 
a naughty breeze invited for a dance the leaves.
At last only one leaf agreed, 
the rest preferred to bask in the sun, 
they haven’t seen in it any fun.
The beauty of Indian summer
with picturesque and colorful gamma
to meet a new season with a mirth.
He knew in advance and gave us another chance
to admire the beauty of nature again, 
the warmth in our hearts to remain.
He gave us another touch of summer warmth, 
so that we could overcome winter storms.
He left us the gift of consolation, 
the gift of love and inspiration.

And half conceals from pensive eyes
The bronzing tokens of the fall;
A calmness broods upon the hills,
And summer's parting dream distills
A charm of silence over all.

The stacks of corn, in brown array,
Stand waiting through the placid day,
Like tattered wigwams on the plain;
The tribes that find a shelter there
Are phantom peoples, forms of air,
And ghosts of vanished joy and pain.

At evening when the crimson crest
Of sunset passes down the West,
I hear the whispering host returning;
On far-off fields, by elm and oak,
I see the lights, I smell the smoke,--
The Camp-fires of the Past are burning. 

a cup of tea at the railway, 
platform stalls costs five rupees, 
the same costs a few hundreds, 
at the rich man's branded shops, 
both may taste the same, 
the disparity between, 
the haves and have not, 
have become two wide, 
the tea is brewing, 
in every other young, 
poor and chance less heart. 

WEAVERS, weaving at break of day, 
Why do you weave a garment so gay? . . . 
Blue as the wing of a halcyon wild, 
We weave the robes of a new-born child.


Weavers, weaving at fall of night, 
Why do you weave a garment so bright? . . . 
Like the plumes of a peacock, purple and green, 


Weavers, weaving solemn and still, 
What do you weave in the moonlight chill? . . . 
White as a feather and white as a cloud, 
We weave a dead man's funeral shroud. 


Bride of Messina
, 

Madame De Stael

Let not my child be a girl, for very sad is the life of a woman.

The Prairie.

DOWN a broad river of the western wilds,
Piercing thick forest glooms, a light canoe
Swept with the current: fearful was the speed
Of the frail bark, as by a tempest's wing
Borne leaf-like on to where the mist of spray 
Rose with the cataract's thunder. Yet within,
Proudly, and dauntlessly, and all alone,
Save that a babe lay sleeping at her breast,
A woman stood. Upon her Indian brow 
Sat a strange gladness, and her dark hair wav'd 
As if triumphantly. She press'd her child,
In its bright slumber, to her beating heart,
And lifted her sweet voice that rose awhile
Above the sound of waters, high and clear,
Wafting a wild proud strain, her Song of Death. 

Roll swiftly to the Spirit's land, thou mighty stream and free!
Father of ancient waters, roll! and bear our lives with thee!
The weary bird that storms have toss'd would seek the sunshine's calm,
And the deer that hath the arrow's hurt flies to the woods of balm.

Roll on! my warrior's eye hath look'd upon another's face, 
And mine hath faded from his soul, as fades a moonbeam's trace; 
My shadow comes not o'er his path, my whisper to his dream,
He flings away the broken reed roll swifter yet, thou stream!

The voice that spoke of other days is hush'd within his breast,
But mine its lonely music haunts, and will not let me rest; 
It sings a low and mournful song of gladness that is gone,
I cannot live without that light. Father of waves! roll on!

Will he not miss the bounding step that met him from the chase?
The heart of love that made his home an ever sunny place?
The hand that spread the hunter's board, and deck'd his couch of yore?
He will not! roll, dark foaming stream, on to the better shore!

Some blessed fount amidst the woods of that bright land must flow,
Whose waters from my soul may lave the memory of this wo;
Some gentle wind must whisper there, whose breath may waft away
The burden of the heavy night, the sadness of the day.

And thou, my babe! tho' born, like me, for woman's weary lot,
Smile! to that wasting of the heart, my own! I leave thee not; 
Too bright a thing art thou to pine in aching love away,
Thy mother bears thee far, young Fawn! from sorrow and decay.

She bears thee to the glorious bowers where none are heard to weep,
And where th' unkind one hath no power again to trouble sleep;
And where the soul shall find its youth, as wakening from a dream,
One moment, and that realm is ours. On, on, dark rolling stream

You came galloping
Before the sun rise
Breaking the dawn
Down I fall
When you made me to run
Gallowbird fly beyond in his mind
That's not a mere fun
They have galvanized his generosity in the heat chamber-tonight's dinner! 
While I too gaze on the gauntlet gushing out of their gambling houses
You came still, still, still
Galloping, hopping, hoping.  

You know me enough
the way i know you enough
It's been a long years now, since then
we knew our INDIFFERENCE.
You accepted me for what i am
I accepted you for what you are
It's been stripes 
but love is our defense..

Our INDIFFERENCE made us closer
Communication  and care
HAPPINESS is in the air.
We made our LOVE into  a perfection
Created a LOVE STORY in the world of imagination

There's no such thing is forever 
But as long as we keep holding on
This LOVE can never be thrown

I know we are not perfectly defined
Sometimes patience collide
Negative thoughts seem never fade
But this i promised babe! 
I will love you as long as I live.  

WE can endure that He should waste our lands,
Despoil our temples, and by sword and flame
Return us to the dust from which we came;
Such food a Tyrant's appetite demands:
And we can brook the thought that by his hands
Spain may be overpowered, and he possess,
For his delight, a solemn wilderness
Where all the brave lie dead. But, when of bands
Which he will break for us he dares to speak,
Of benefits, and of a future day 
When our enlightened minds shall bless his sway;
'Then', the strained heart of fortitude proves weak;
Our groans, our blushes, our pale cheeks declare
That he has power to inflict what we lack strength to bear. 

Our society is getting sicker, 
More conservative, more liberal, 
More outrageous, more difficult to handle, 
And more ravaged by an elusive cancer.

Everyone is a suspect, no one is exempt, 
And the system can only attempt
To cosmetically apply a bandage
To a critically wounded adage.

Our frustrations get the very best of us, 
We found ourselves deep in an abysmal mess.
We are incessantly racing toward the deluge, 
Where everyone is flashy, dead and huge.

The authorities cannot unilaterally
Spew out a solution to this madness.
This is a fallacious epidemic, a global malady
Deeply buried in our sub-consciousness.

Our violent mind can go beyond the imagination; 
One wonders: why the surreptitious surprise, 
And why anyone should be hiding behind lies, 
Deceits and unfortunate crazed malefactions? 

Calmness, prayer and meditation 
Can improve our current situation; 
However, it is forbidden to do so in our zoos, 
By the so called experts and the mad gurus.

Dogs have to cease eating dogs
Many have to stop behaving like dirty frogs.
Our society needs to be more civilized, 
More forthcoming and more fraternized. 

Our society yearns for immediate healing, 
Constant and daily blessing.
Our society needs to be more attentive, 
More passionate and more receptive. 

I was placed on a pedestal and asked to perform
I was striped of my pride and open to scorn
My inner most feelings displayed to all
Yet I hold my head high and refuse to fall

Naked, a newfound purity

I’m blinded by light, but my focus remains
Surrounded by faces without any names
My presence encourages cheers from below
The people demand a start to the show

Expectations, belief's of the blind

Emotions run high, I shout for relief
Fear exchanged for adrenaline release
A glimmer appears in the eyes of the throng
The shout now descends to the level of song

Vanity, corner stone of expression


A group, a clique, what's the point? 
Why not lead instead of follow
To stand alone, but fight for what's right
Be yourself whoever you are
Tall, short, big, small, smart, dumb the list goes on
Show your opnion then strike a pose
Do a dance till your hearts content
An individual is better than the crowd.  

think about it. 

Ah yes, I love you, and with all my heart; 
 Just as a weaker woman loves her own, 
Better than I love my beloved art, 
 Which, until you came, reigned royally, alone, 
My king, my master. Since I saw your face
I have dethroned it, and you hold that place.

I am as weak as other women are –
 Your frown can make the whole world like a tomb
Your smile shines brighter than the sun, by far; 
 Sometimes I think there is not space or room
In all the earth for such a love as mine, 
And it soars up to breathe in realms divine.

I know that your desertion or neglect
 Could break my heart, as women’s hearts do break; 
If my wan days had nothing to expect
 From your love’s splendour, all joy would forsake
The chambers of my soul.  Yes this is true.
And yet, and yet – one thing I keep from you.

There is a subtle part of me, which went
 Into my long pursued and worshipped art; 
Though your great love fills me with such content, 
 No other love finds room now in my heart.
Yet that rare essence was my art’s alone.

 With that vast love, as passionate as tender, 
I feel an exultation as I know
 I have not made you a complete surrender.
Here is my body; bruise it, if you will, 
And break my heart; I have that something still.

You cannot grasp it. Seize the breath of morn, 
 Or bind the perfume of the rose as well.
 It is not mine to give away, or sell, 
Or offer up on any alter shrine.
It was my art’s; and when not art’s, ‘tis mine.

For Love’s sake, I can put the art away, 
 Or anything which stands ‘twixt me and you, 
 To permeate the work He gave to do: 
And it cannot be drained, dissolved, or sent
Through any channel, save the one He meant. 

Sail on, sail on, fair cousin Cloud:
Oh loiter hither from the sea.
Still-eyed and shadow-brow'd,
Steal off from yon far-drifting crowd,
And come and brood upon the marsh with me.

Yon laboring low horizon-smoke,
Yon stringent sail, toil not for thee
Nor me; did heaven's stroke
The whole deep with drown'd commerce choke,
No pitiless tease of risk or bottomry

Would to thy rainy office close
Thy will, or lock mine eyes from tears,
Part wept for traders'-woes,
Part for that ventures mean as those
In issue bind such sovereign hopes and fears.

-- Lo, Cloud, thy downward countenance stares
Blank on the blank-faced marsh, and thou
Mindest of dark affairs;
Thy substance seems a warp of cares;
Like late wounds run the wrinkles on thy brow.

Well may'st thou pause, and gloom, and stare,
A visible conscience: I arraign
Thee, criminal Cloud, of rare
Contempts on Mercy, Right, and Prayer, --
Of murders, arsons, thefts, -- of nameless stain.

(Yet though life's logic grow as gray
As thou, my soul's not in eclipse.)
Cold Cloud, but yesterday
Thy lightning slew a child at play,
And then a priest with prayers upon his lips

For his enemies, and then a bright
Lady that did but ope the door
Upon the storming night
To let a beggar in, -- strange spite, --
And then thy sulky rain refused to pour

Till thy quick torch a barn had burned
Where twelve months' store of victual lay,
A widow's sons had earned;
Which done, thy floods with winds returned, --
The river raped their little herd away.

What myriad righteous errands high
Thy flames MIGHT run on! In that hour
Thou slewest the child, oh why
Not rather slay Calamity,
Breeder of Pain and Doubt, infernal Power?

Or why not plunge thy blades about
Some maggot politician throng
Swarming to parcel out
The body of a land, and rout
The maw-conventicle, and ungorge Wrong?

What the cloud doeth
The cloud knoweth not.
What the artist doeth,
Knoweth the artist not?

Well-answered! -- O dear artists, ye
-- Whether in forms of curve or hue
Or tone your gospels be --
Say wrong `This work is not of me,

Awful is Art because 'tis free.
The artist trembles o'er his plan
Where men his Self must see.
Who made a song or picture, he

Giving, He gave: my me is mine.
How poor, how strange, how wrong,
To dream He wrote the little song
I made to Him with love's unforced design!

Oh, not as clouds dim laws have plann'd
To strike down Good and fight for Ill, --
Oh, not as harps that stand
In the wind and sound the wind's command:
Each artist -- gift of terror! -- owns his will.

For thee, Cloud, -- if thou spend thine all
Upon the South's o'er-brimming sea
That needs thee not; or crawl
To the dry provinces, and fall
Till every convert clod shall give to thee

Green worship; if thou grow or fade,
Bring on delight or misery,
Fly east or west, be made
Snow, hail, rain, wind, grass, rose, light, shade;
What matters it to thee? There is no thee.

Pass, kinsman Cloud, now fair and mild:
Discharge the will that's not thine own.
I work in freedom wild,
But work, as plays a little child,
Sure of the Father, Self, and Love, alone. 

Transparent, you see through me
Ignorant, you outsmart me
Deceived, you betray me
If mine own shallow soul gave way to such onslaught 
Then none may learn from the lessons it taught
Writhing, you quicken me
Swollen, you inflame me 
Alone, you ignore me
In anguished retreat I reach for the key
An end to your pleasure, an end to me


Windows, windows are the best; 
At least you see the birds passing by; 
Instead of seeing walls all around. 

The pulley wheels are spinning fast, 
Leather bands drive strange machines.
Lights flickering, shadows cast, 
So it was in my dreams.

Noise deafening as drills bored through, 
Metal sheet and iron struts.
Chaos reigned in this motley crew, 
As man tightened bolts and nuts.

Soon my senses were in a whirl, 
I could not take the pace.
Beads of sweat from my face do purl
In the madness of the human race.

Twelve hours long no rest for me, 
The machine the master of my fate.
No way out that I could see, 
My soul began to fill with hate.

I was a member of a working force, 
Prefabricated parts left the machines.
Little pay a matter of course, 
This is what filled my dreams

Assembly lines teams of workers, 
Rushing feet; hands so adept.
Here no place for shirkers, 
For there is a fixed target to get.

The siren blows end of shift, 
Tools change hands others take our place, 
My spirit takes on a new lift, 
As a smile gathers on my face. 

Give me to my heart’s content, 
Fill to my heart’s fulfillment, 
Spill to my heart’s enjoyment, 
Deluge to my heart’s contentment.

Give me: 
That inebriates 
Whole Universe
Give me that.

I’ll sip and lap
Like just hap
To be Unison-One 
With Boozed Universe. 

Give me    
Nectar even scant  
That Universal Inebriant.

where the majority
of people live in abject poverty
it's been hard to find the drive
to survive
in such a world
because one only ends up being

their bleak view of reality
by thinking a little positively
they become like someone
chasing vanity
when all theirs attempts
to rise to the top
are constantly pushed down
by the elite in their society
and eventually, all they can see
are the inequalities
between the rich and the poor
that grows wider by the day! 

A series of failed attempts
has left them feeling powerless
and helpless
and they can't even dare
to dream again
or rise to the top
like they see the rich do
their meaningless lives
are overshadowed by those
who live comfortable lives
and have all they need
to achieve their dreams
and succeed! 

So, In the end
they feels too small
to amount to anything at all
and, as one grows older
they just shrug their shoulders
as they become a little less bolder
and lower their shrunken eyes
as the think they could never reach the peak

they recede with time
but come back

They were born in the sea with sea-care, 
You have got them up
Now that you have preserve them in care, 
Into your furnished flats in a gorgeous city.

Your city is too safe! 
Let's think, free of earthquake and tidal flood, 
Let's think, armed guards have flawless eyes on them, 
Let's think, also, secretly you have kept them in a hidden chest, 

Yet, It's the matter for time being, 
Once, in future, all these seashell will dissolve into the sea




   O you who sleep so deep you cannot wake! 
Every night in mourning I come upon your pupils, 
Miraculous in life, miraculous in death, 

And in life and death eternally open. 

Beneath a remnant of shade or silk lace of moon, 
I drink their calm as I would a lagoon. 
For depth, for silence, for goodness, for peacefulness. 

     Each one seeming a bed or a tomb. 

Baby face is the face of paradise.
In celestial light 
are we bathed 
before our birth.

Infancy is a divine state.

Naked we come from celestial glory, 
bare and innocent, 
nothing to hide, 
radiant innocence
where angels and mothers kiss.

Holy is the life of a baby.
Baby face is the face of paradise.


'I have no name;
 I am but two days old.'
 What shall I call thee?
 'I happy am,
 Joy is my name.'
 Sweet joy befall thee!
 
 Pretty joy!
 Sweet joy, but two days old.
 Sweet Joy I call thee:
 Thou dost smile,
 I sing the while;
 Sweet joy befall thee

My mother groaned, my father wept,
Into the dangerous world I leapt;
Helpless, naked, piping loud,
Like a fiend hid in a cloud.

Struggling in my father's hands,
Striving against my swaddling bands,
Bound and weary, I thought best
To sulk upon my mother's breast. 

When I experinced this for the first time. 
I thought I was going crazy.
I dreamt about you every night.
You haunted my thoughts even in daylight.
I was somewhat relieved once my feelings faded away.
But now I feel empty. What happened to my moon-eyed faze? 
I hardly dream about you at all, yet you still haunt my thoughts
when I'm home alone.  little things remind me of you.
Like flash backs from the past.  I'll never go back. 

It’s so sickly how diluted your mind can be
When one acquires an infatuation of love
How one just hunger’s to be in the presence of another
An insanity of waiting in a purgatory of stand still excitement
A heart continuously beating to a never worn out state
A marathon like no end
Until this presence comes to be again
Lips touch and elevated bodily motion jumps out of the skin
Nerves pulsate outside the veins of blood once trapped inside the heart too long
The presence as strong as the energy of the sun compacted into the hands of an individual
How those palms feel the weight of the world on their fingertips
Until ones energy burns out.  ..
And one is left with a fireball lit inside their heart waiting to defuse
The mind begins to go crazy and blood flows back into the heart so violently
Until its pressure exceeds its maximum
The heart explodes and the veins fill with heated adrenaline
A passion of blood thirst erupts and ones palms can no longer handle the weight of the world
The mind becomes clotted and begins to go insane
A sickly feeling in the stomach that cannot vomit
One begins to break down
All because of the infatuation of love
When the world used to be light weighted
And crushingly became more than one heart could handle


Infatuation is a 
temporary emotion
ever fleeting as 
a drifting cloud.

A tree developing buds
green leaves turn gold, 
brown, finally a wind 
blowing over them.

On the ground they lay
again engaged on earth
then they are gone.

Ever changing like the
seasons, warm hot cool 
then cold.

Cool in Spring warming
up for the summer heat
passionately.

Now as the cool winds 
of Autumn begin to blow 
they tend to cool
preparing for the icy 
chills of Winter.

So like a lady changing
her attire 
putting on taking
off her make-up ever
changing 
infatuation a temporary 
emotion. 

Beckon me to stay tonight.
Switch off the light, flatter me with those eyes.
This is something I never thought of me, 
something you never should have let me be.

Can you tell me what it is I’m feeling.
Watch the glow-in-the-dark stickers on your ceiling
as the night turns dark and the mood serene.
The most beautiful I’ve ever seen.

The sensation burns as you touch my skin.
Your eyes whispering, ‘Where have you been? ’
Falling deeper into this mad situation, 
I’ve got a hunger for this infatuation.

Trace your lips along my collarbone, 
knowing later I’ll say, ‘If I had only known.’
When preventing something seems impossible, 
it’s sometimes best to never let it go.

So beckon me to stay tonight, 
as I lay in your arms under the morning light.
This is something I never thought of me, 
something I never thought that we could be. 

Bedazzled by the burning sun
Enchanted by the moon
Enamoured by your loving kiss
Enraptured all too soon

So captivated by your charms
You took my breath away
It seemed that I could never live
Without you through each day

But swiftly as it came to be
Yet quickly it did pass
For now those stormy passions felt
Lie crushed as shattered glass

The flame that leapt within my heart
Is now a dying ember
And as I look into your eyes
That flame I can`t remember


A dream that never met reality
A hunger never satisfied
A business unfinished
A love never fulfilled 
A horizon never walked upon


Decades ago, the waste of infatuation 
hidden in my wallet pocket 
a crumbled rose, a piece of stale 
chocolate waiting to be eaten 
something, anything you touched. 

Then I see you 
years later in a storefront. 
The movie is fast forward, the 
sound paused to mute. 
After a moment, there are words 
between us, your eyes focus 
on my lips talking. 
My eyes focus on your gray hair 
and wrinkled forehead. 

Infatuation 
What kind of word is that? 
Why does the meaning 
become a blur of words 
and all the youth of my life 
come sliding down a mountain, 
pooling at the bottom of your feet. 

shudder at your sight
my avoidance secretly
desires encounter


In the calamity of mind’s
 biggest mystery
I see an antithetical me; 
So every time a conflict begins
I find that fiend tearing off my soul.

In the core of my cryptic life’s 
 analytical ability
I discover estrange sensitivity; 
As the moment, the stranger takes charge
I break off a new parole.

Under the shadow of my nightmare’s
 acrimonious marquee
I face my worst enemy; 
Each moment I’m losing out to myself
My intruder is taking up the control. 

How can one mourn
a future that will never be? 
My un-conceived
yet pre conceived
idea of completeness.

The crimson rage that 
marks an end to every hope.
I cannot bear to look
at those babies of yours.

Not because I begrudge you
this ultimate blessing, 
but that it causes
an unbearable anguish of being.

It haunts my dreams; 
colours my every waking second.
Never stork white, but elephant grey
that never forgets

The dream.
I mark the bell chimes.
Every new year
a landmark of failure. 

To say love
To do hate, 
A kind of love
Fully hatred; 

Water falls in fact
On arum leaf, 
Leaf is untouched
By a single drop; 

To save openly
To kill silently, 
A kind of safety
Fully cruelty; 

Dire hypocrisy does
Infest namely love, 
Hatred infests a man? 
But the whole nation; 

If brains do cheat
No normal in fact, 
But are occupied
By satanic thought.




Muzahidul Reza
he clutched her hand and held it tight
she took him in her arms and held fast
deep down they both knew it could not last.


Two souls inseperable in mind and heart
it was only miles that kept them apart 
in another time, another place
they might  have retreated from the human race


These snatched moments must surely end 
before the ensuing wrath  transcends
a passing cloud phased out the light                           
the stars disappeared as they kissed goodnight 


They always knew it could not last
all they had left was memories past
 as true love bade its last farewell
each went their separate ways to dwell


When Love, in mercurial flight forsakes
The heart that it once cherished
Tears that flow leave 
Vows and rings.  

tarnished.

(Composed June  Tarlac City Philippines)Looking over the fields towards the Sun, 
Observing that the rain had just begun, 
A freshness seemed to permeate the air, 
And all that one could do was, stand and stare, 
As something magical crept across the skies, 
A vision that was reflected in my eyes.
A sight of infinite beauty, there to see, 
One of the wonders given to us, for free.
Lovely colours blending, like a dream, 
In subtle hues, an arched rainbow supreme.

Having hopes billions
I stand to look at sky
Rays spark and I smile.

I know many read mind
They observe and say
But I hear only unity
This voice strengths.

Having birth and death
This fortune sings it
I do not know and know
I have movement fast.

Having less life span
I live a life to watch
This universe binds me
In my vision I see long.

I see infinity in joy
In grief I do not break
Father favours me soon
I move fast in infinity. 

ocean of love; put one small
drop in each of our hearts. 

The almighty has
made the heart so delicate, 
by love's pressure, oscillates. 

As the earthen pot
integrate to earth again, 
whenever it gets broken.

To get rid of pain
busted hearts pray to go back

Like the earth nurtures
each and every creature, 
dead broods by time it devours.

own droplets put into hearts 
to merge in ocean of love. 

You have invited me for a drink
we sat across from
one another

Small table in between us
covered with white cloth
a red heart in a middle
the fabric shimmered
with glitter

I stared at you; intensely
I felt your warmth
encircle me
-Your eyes, electric, magnetic
I was lost in infinity
-Infinitely


To be, or not to be, 
That is the question; 
To go on or to die hard, 
That is the answer.

Infinitives are verbs
With the word 'to' in front
Of it, 
So it is pretty awesome.
They are the simplest form, 
Such as to run, 
To skate, to write, 
To walk, to swim, 
To have, to become, 
And so on.
It's awesome. 

When I missed you
on a fateful day, 
and my mental sustenance
was drained with misery, 
I cursed the late fall sun
and cried - let darkness come.

Spin rotund flare
until you are a cinder
and winter befalls
the universe
with colder stars
and older lights, 
then night will reign
for eternity across
forevers sights.

- and me an ancient lady
in timelessness unfree
will wander the spatial deserts
into infinity. 

Infinity

Around and around we go into infinity
Take a walk in the forest sit under a pine tree
Smoke a bowl, take a toll driving across the country
Appreciate all that you receive and what you see.

I AM here forevermore in the now, We are that
Different personas, are you a sly rat or cool cat? 
Play your role well for you are the One into many
Erect the world around you, create, you'll have plenty.

Now when is enough enough? A good question to ask.
Always be here in the now, just focus on the task
The past is the past and the future has not yet come
Our potential is great, we are anything but dumb

Forever and ever hear the tick tock of the clock
Except you are the prisoner and you hold the lock
The key is in your hands as well, keeper of the jail
Warden of the mind free yourself, a new day, set sail.

There may be a storm approaching but always be brave
Cool wind, rough waters, prickling rain, fifteen foot wave
The storm will soon be over and there will be sunshine
Keep hope in your heart and love will always be on line

Your end will soon come, don't be afraid, it'll be okay
For in your end is your beginning, no price to pay
What a magnificent ordeal that we are all in
Sublime truly, were are all One and we all lose and win


For it is so amazingly this
Beauty encompassing True Form
Abound in the realm of moonlit dreams
Or alive with rays of the rising sun
Evokes no boundaries
No sharp edges of thoughts
With the path illuminated endlessly
Soul flowing into the tranquil Sea
Resonated melodies hummed
Music with lyrics that always
Live Love and Laugh
Ignite thy senses with passion and dare
Journey towards East or is that West
No final end in sight nor whence commenced
Forever shall be as it is
In the Triad of Heart, Soul & Mind


In purest song one plays the constant fool 
As changes shimmer in the inner eye. 
I stare and stare into a deepening pool 
And tell myself my image cannot die. 
I love myself: that’s my one constancy. 
Oh, to be something else, yet still to be! 


There’s little left I care to call my own. 
Today they drained the fluid from a knee 
And pumped a shoulder full of cortisone; 
Thus I conform to my divinity 
By dying inward, like an aging tree. 


The instant ages on the living eye; 
Light on its rounds, a pure extreme of light 
Breaks on me as my meager flesh breaks down— 
The soul delights in that extremity. 
Blessed the meek; they shall inherit wrath; 
I’m son and father of my only death. 


A mind too active is no mind at all; 
The deep eye sees the shimmer on the stone; 
The eternal seeks, and finds, the temporal, 
The change from dark to light of the slow moon, 
Dead to myself, and all I hold most dear, 
I move beyond the reach of wind and fire. 


Deep in the greens of summer sing the lives 
I’ve come to love. A vireo whets its bill. 
The great day balances upon the leaves; 
My ears still hear the bird when all is still; 
My soul is still my soul, and still the Son, 
And knowing this, I am not yet undone. 


Things without hands take hands: there is no choice,— 
Eternity’s not easily come by. 
When opposites come suddenly in place, 
I teach my eyes to hear, my ears to see 
How body from spirit slowly does unwind 
Until we are pure spirit at the end. 

Not fire, a woman can inflame a man
well

After his death
We gathered firewood, charcoal
And some other elements
To burn him

We set fire
and observed, finally, 
All other things with firewood burnt
Except him


Chilled dark night-stone rolling and rolling 
I solitary benumbed fire a patient of insomnia 
Come on exquisitely beautiful divine Belle
Be graceful be benignant 
Make me drifting 
Enrich me with the power of burning 

I'm keen to suffer from inflammatory fever. 

The fervent, pale-faced Mother ere she sleep, 
Looks out upon the zigzag-lighted square, 
The beautiful bare trees, the blue night-air, 
The revelation of the star-strewn deep, 
World above world, and heaven over heaven. 
Between the tree-tops and the skies, her sight 
Rests on a steadfast, ruddy-shining light, 
High in the tower, an earthly star of even. 
Hers is the faith in saints' and angels' power, 
And mediating love--she breathes a prayer 
For yon tired watcher in the gray old tower. 
He the shrewd, skeptic poet unaware 
Feels comforted and stilled, and knows not whence 
Falls this unwonted peace on heart and sense. 

Wisdom and Spirit of the universe! 
Thou Soul, that art the Eternity of thought! 
And giv'st to forms and images a breath 
And everlasting motion! not in vain, 
By day or star-light, thus from my first dawn 
Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me 
The passions that build up our human soul; 
Not with the mean and vulgar works of Man; 
But with high objects, with enduring things, 
With life and nature; purifying thus 
The elements of feeling and of thought, 
And sanctifying by such discipline 
Both pain and fear,--until we recognise 
A grandeur in the beatings of the heart. 
Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me 
With stinted kindness. In November days, 
When vapours rolling down the valleys made 
A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods 
At noon; and 'mid the calm of summer nights, 
When, by the margin of the trembling lake, 
Beneath the gloomy hills, homeward I went 
In solitude, such intercourse was mine: 
Mine was it in the fields both day and night, 
And by the waters, all the summer long. 
And in the frosty season, when the sun 
Was set, and, visible for many a mile, 
The cottage-windows through the twilight blazed, 
I heeded not the summons: happy time 
It was indeed for all of us; for me 
It was a time of rapture! Clear and loud 
The village-clock tolled six--I wheeled about, 
Proud and exulting like an untired horse 
That cares not for his home.--All shod with steel 
We hissed along the polished ice, in games 
Confederate, imitative of the chase 
And woodland pleasures,--the resounding horn, 
The pack loud-chiming, and the hunted hare. 
So through the darkness and the cold we flew, 
And not a voice was idle: with the din 
Smitten, the precipices rang aloud; 
The leafless trees and every icy crag 
Tinkled like iron; while far-distant hills 
Into the tumult sent an alien sound 
Of melancholy, not unnoticed while the stars, 
Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west 
The orange sky of evening died away. 
Not seldom from the uproar I retired 
Into a silent bay, or sportively 
Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng, 
To cut across the reflex of a star; 
Image, that, flying still before me, gleamed 
Upon the glassy plain: and oftentimes, 
When we had given our bodies to the wind, 
And all the shadowy banks on either side 
Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still 
The rapid line of motion, then at once 
Have I, reclining back upon my heels, 
Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs 
Wheeled by me--even as if the earth had rolled 
With visible motion her diurnal round! 
Behind me did they stretch in solemn train, 
Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watched 
Till all was tranquil as a summer sea. 

This tree has two million and seventy-five thousand leaves. 
Perhaps I missed a leaf or two but I do feel triumphant 
at having persisted in counting by hand branch by branch 
and marked down on paper with pencil each total. 
Adding them up was a pleasure I could understand; 
I did something on my own that was not dependent on others, 
and to count leaves is not less meaningful than to count the stars, 
as astronomers are always doing. 
They want the facts to be sure they have them all. 
It would help them to know whether the world is finite. 
I discovered one tree that is finite. 
I must try counting the hairs on my head, and you too. 
We could swap information. 

When you jump through the sad and happy clouds, 
To reach my heart as the news, don’t you feel tired? 

When you fight with the troubling waves, 
To reach my internet port, don’t you feel exhausted? 

When you pass through the printers, 
To reach me as the paper, don’t you feel suffocated? 

When you climb into the mind, 
To reach me as the gossip, aren’t you ashamed

What’re activities of Obama today
sitting in India I know. 
Electronics media worked for me
to make the information flow.

Guided or unguided transmission, 
I say through wire or the air.
Transmitted so much vast and fast, 
detailed facts are flared. 

There was a time, 
we had to wait weeks together; 
To get news about friends
or receive their letters.

Progress of information technology
how has changed the life.
Within seconds we know  
all about the world that thrives. 

I am face to face with many poets, 
Relatives and friends; 
Not knowing who are all masked
to complete this wonder chain.

It is not like that we always have pros.
Once the link of net was broken, 
I could not check my mail in time
and missed crucial date that was open. 

Few time back I got an anonymous mail
informing that I have won a great prize.
Further communications disappointed me, 
as found it fake, to my surprise. 

In the darkness of the night 
he paints a portrait in red
Through warmth he delineates 
a delicate body shape.
All cold around in black. 
Bodies move slowly
like hot pieces of lava, 
in many nuances of red.
Illumination radiated by heat, 
filtered warily in his head. 
He created a portrait 
beyond visible present
of a lady in infra-red. 

The world is better with someone to share it
It’s heavy as hell when you’re the only one to bare it
So you barely hanging on, 

Even the smallest things make you the most embarrassed 
Until you just can’t bear it and you’re buried in a hole
Just wanting to be whole, just wanting to hold

A hand from another human-being, 
A hug when you need it
A soft voice to calm your last nerve

A shoulder when you find it hard living 
Because your momma living in her last days
Emotions all caught up, 
And you caught in a bad way

Just trying to find your way in a world so blinding, 
None can see the future so it’s blind leading the blind 
And despite your best efforts her condition only gets worse
But why die today, all in due timing

What I wouldn’t do just to get that time back
What I wouldn’t do just to get peace of mind that
You’re forever fine, and forever mine
Forever and forever and forever more

But nothing’s more further from the truth
So I pray more father can we truce
Spare today but she’s gone tomorrow
The time we have is all sorrow
So much that it hurts me soul 
So I’ll sell mine just to hear her say my name
But some say it’s worthless, 
So the pain will forever remain

Ngathi ezasemzini
Asikazichani'The almighty Creator is a good cook
He formulates life with different intermixtures
And He put them all together in a can
Can be with salt
Can be with sugar
Can be with coloring
Can be with additive
Can be with preservative
Of course there's an expiration
Only He knows when


My whole body is hairy as if an entellus I am.
Also, the same about my father.

Those hair of mine was not impenetrable at first, 
Suddenly, after my father’s death, 
They grow impenetrable and count double. 

Don't blame me, 
for staying alone.
Don't blame me, 
for abandoning you, 
in the Garden.
Don't blame me, 
for crucifying you, 
with my words and deeds.
Don't blame me, 
for the sacrifices, 
that you have done for me.

As I resemble the Creator, 
who created me on his own image, 
I have inherited His characters. 

I am too tired, wearing all these shrouds, 
To accommodate all these hearts, 
Those long for a link within me, as their kin and kith, 
When they wake up from the work, 

After a long silence, that is too cold, 
As if walk near the esplanade before dawn, 
No one is around during the wee hours, 
As if the whole world is against us in vengeance, 

Standing there and witnessing the brewing of oceans, 
Suddenly all these excited human ring my door bell, 
The home is made up to suit their needs, 
My feet mount up and float in the air, 

The heavy stones seem to be the cotton pod, 
The varieties of dishes on the plates, 
The colorful stories repeated for the ears, 
The longing of the heart for this moment to extend, 

Zipping of the bags, spraying of the perfumes, 
Wearing of shoes and the waving of the hands, 
Again the house is quiet with a few hearts palpitate, 
Open and close the curtain for the arrival of their loved ones, 

The eloped illnesses arrive with their off springs, 
These ‘old folks’ start to grumble and long for attention, 
They are discarded of their shrouds for the safe keep, 
Someone must inherit to be the beneficiary of their sorrows, 

I have inherited one and lacked my sleep and peace, 
I am tired of these attires, those have different name tags, 
these attires don't belong to me, even after years of use and abuse, 
simply fresh as newly sewed and waiting for the new owners. 

Defying stony indifference
Braving elements against her
Making no heroic pretense
She has taken it this far.

She's the woman found on the way
Cuddling the baby begging her day
Not worth a look on the pave defiled
Delighted to bring this world a child.

Her skin's paramour there's no dearth
Wasted daily disrobed on earth
Then in a fulfillment absurdly wild
She gets this world a beautiful child.

The child is alive and solely hers
It must live none else she cares
She looks in its eyes in wistful trance
Sees in them her only inheritance. 

In all my days
I thought I knew you
But when you went away
I still miss you
With all your lies
All your dreamy promises
You still wreck my heart
Even when you are dead--------------
Was it all a lie? 
Your enchanting words and loving smiles
Was everything a deception? 
To humiliate me to feed your own perfection
I was a fool from the start 
And honey you being you
Broke my heart
And I was left to repent
All the sins you did
All the promises you broke
And I kept worshiping you as my sun
Now you have been gone
And it has been so long
Yet my heart breaks
For all I ever gave you
And the feelings you didn’t reciprocate
And I have to live with it all
I guess my love set me up for this treacherous fall. 

Inhumanity

‘O' man you are claiming yourself human
But I think you are greedy and inhuman also.
You forget my services and sacrifices 
done for you and for your family.
I served for your family 
throughout my life 
by giving milk, dung and kids.
Milk for you and your family.
Dung for your fields.
Kids to server your next generation.
In return you are sending me to slaughter house in my old age.
Now you tell me what type of label I must give to you? 

Cry of a buffalo


I’m the void of all there is
I’m the lacking of any presence
though nothing can escape my grasp
except the eternal essence

I have no borders none can see
the outer edges of my rims
though if they get to close
the last laugh I’ll see to them

I’m am a half of a whole
functioning but not complete
I’m the sin in your heart
and the lies in the words you speak

My fruit is most becoming
but it’s a poison fruit indeed
you’ll regret ever tasting
the fruit reaped from my tree

I corrupt those who’re pure
with the seduction of my allure
though one thing is known for sure
there is no eternal cure. 

Venus, when her son was lost,
Cried him up and down the coast,
In hamlets, palaces, and parks,
And told the truant by his marks,
Golden curls, and quiver, and bow;—
This befell long ago.
Time and tide are strangely changed,
Men and manners much deranged;
None will now find Cupid latent
By this foolish antique patent.
He came late along the waste,
Shod like a traveller for haste,
With malice dared me to proclaim him,
That the maids and boys might name him.

Boy no more, he wears all coats,
Frocks, and blouses, capes, capôtes,
He bears no bow, or quiver, or wand,
Nor chaplet on his head or hand:
Leave his weeds and heed his eyes,
All the rest he can disguise.
In the pit of his eyes a spark
Would bring back day if it were dark,
And,—if I tell you all my thought,
Though I comprehend it not,—
In those unfathomable orbs
Every function he absorbs;
He doth eat, and drink, and fish, and shoot,
And write, and reason, and compute,
And ride, and run, and have, and hold,
And whine, and flatter, and regret,
And kiss, and couple, and beget,
By those roving eye-balls bold;
Undaunted are their courages,
Right Cossacks in their forages;
Fleeter they than any creature,
They are his steeds and not his feature,
Inquisitive, and fierce, and fasting,
Restless, predatory, hasting,—
And they pounce on other eyes,
As lions on their prey;
And round their circles is writ,
Plainer than the day,
Underneath, within, above,
Love, love, love, love.
He lives in his eyes,
There doth digest, and work, and spin,
And buy, and sell, and lose, and win;
He rolls them with delighted motion,
Joy-tides swell their mimic ocean.
Yet holds he them with tortest rein,
That they may seize and entertain
The glance that to their glance opposes,
Like fiery honey sucked from roses.

He palmistry can understand,
Imbibing virtue by his hand
As if it were a living root;
The pulse of hands will make him mute;
With all his force he gathers balms
Into those wise thrilling palms.

Cupid is a casuist,
A mystic, and a cabalist,
Can your lurking Thought surprise,
And interpret your device;
Mainly versed in occult science,
In magic, and in clairvoyance.
Oft he keeps his fine ear strained,
And reason on her tiptoe pained,
For aery intelligence,
And for strange coincidence.
But it touches his quick heart
When Fate by omens takes his part,
And chance-dropt hints from Nature's sphere
Deeply soothe his anxious ear.

Heralds high before him run,
He has ushers many a one,
Spreads his welcome where he goes,
And touches all things with his rose.
All things wait for and divine him,—
How shall I dare to malign him,
Or accuse the god of sport?—
I must end my true report,
Painting him from head to foot,
In as far as I took note,
Trusting well the matchless power
Of this young-eyed emperor
Will clear his fame from every cloud,
With the bards, and with the crowd.

He is wilful, mutable,
Shy, untamed, inscrutable,
Swifter-fashioned than the fairies,
Substance mixed of pure contraries,
His vice some elder virtue's token,
And his good is evil spoken.
Failing sometimes of his own,
He is headstrong and alone;
He affects the wood and wild,
Like a flower-hunting child,
Buries himself in summer waves,
In trees, with beasts, in mines, and caves,
Loves nature like a horned cow,
Bird, or deer, or cariboo.

Shun him, nymphs, on the fleet horses!
He has a total world of wit,
O how wise are his discourses!
But he is the arch-hypocrite,
And through all science and all art,
Seeks alone his counterpart.
He is a Pundit of the east,
He is an augur and a priest,
And his soul will melt in prayer,
But word and wisdom are a snare;
Corrupted by the present toy,
He follows joy, and only joy.

There is no mask but he will wear,
He invented oaths to swear,
He paints, he carves, he chants, he prays,
And holds all stars in his embrace,
The social quintessence of self.
Well, said I, he is hypocrite,
And folly the end of his subtle wit,
He takes a sovran privilege
Not allowed to any liege,
For he does go behind all law,
And right into himself does draw,
For he is sovranly allied.
Heaven's oldest blood flows in his side,
And interchangeably at one
With every king on every throne,
Or see the fault, or seen betray;
He has the Muses by the heart,
And the Parcae all are of his part.

His many signs cannot be told,
He has not one mode, but manifold,
Many fashions and addresses,
Piques, reproaches, hurts, caresses,
Action, service, badinage,
He will preach like a friar,
And jump like Harlequin,
He will read like a crier,
And fight like a Paladin.
Boundless is his memory,
Plans immense his term prolong,
He is not of counted age,
Meaning always to be young.
And his wish is intimacy,
Intimater intimacy,
And a stricter privacy,
The impossible shall yet be done,
And being two shall still be one.
As the wave breaks to foam on shelves,
Then runs into a wave again,
So lovers melt their sundered selves,
Yet melted would be twain. 

If i am comfortable
sharing my problems, 
I then consider you not stranger
rather someone whom i can trust.
I did not expect you to help me
but worthy enough to listen me at my worst.
your companionship makes me strong, 
but strange feeling fills my heart with tears, 
perhaps i know the destiny, 
where there is no you and me.

India
Oh! 
India
Careless painting
O'
Callous thinking. 

My two eyes saw committings
And brain perceived conditions
Together were my observations 
In life I have much observations
Here I am one of the witnesses 
I told truly the crimes committed, 
But they denied and were favored

white collar crime is 
immoral an injustice 
that many countries
 
have corrupted allowed 
to breed multiply infest 
their codes legal systems

bedrock middle working classes 
should both teach their children
honour pride dignity of honest 

workers is never for sale; 
politicians are servants 
of the people the nation 

their goal in politics 
cannot be to amass 
wealth for themselves  

at the cost of a nations 
pride causing poverty 
for our fellow citizens; 

to the slave is equal
politicians today need 

to remember history 
previous past generations 
humane great leaders

who worked 
not for themselves
who worked 

for the good 
of their nation
their people; 

who believed in 
peace at home 
peace in the world 

if we continue 
to allow disease 
white collar crime 

to amass millions 
billions illegally 
for putrid debased 

individuals never tried 
for heinous greed crimes
upon society perpetrated; 
 
then how can 
our nations prosper 
when the fat 

of the land 
is stolen 
not shared 

people need hope 
belief in equal justice
in their nations laws; 

people are not 
animals they need 
a little appreciation 

the odd luxury 
for themselves 
their children

left with nothing 
but bare bones
lean nasty blamed 

for their own 
unemployment
misery poverty; 

risks not just 
broken lives
but a cold hard 

mean day 
of accounting
rage vented

a little compassion 
goes a long way
justice equality for all 

solves many problems 
before they crisis arise
time world governments 

address the real issues


Whites alone upon the jury in a number of the states,
Thus they crush a helpless Negro with their prejudicial hates;
Legal ills they thrust upon him, and the tale is passing sad—
Equal rights with white men? Never! Color-phobia makes them mad.

'Tis the training of the children, every Negro to suppress,
They their spleen may vent upon him and he happy, none the less,
They will boast aloud in anger if by Negroes they are crossed,
'If we shoot or kill a Negro, not a cent will be the cost.'

Juries represent the people and their sentiments make known,
When a Negro comes in question there's discrimination shown.
They are bold to make assertion that they will not do the same
For a Negro as a white man, and no feeling comes of shame.

Jurymen have made confession after trial had been made
Of a Negro, and 'He's guilty!' was the verdict there displayed.
Stern remorse so touched the conscience, they the story did relate,
How the verdict they had rendered was to stay the dying fate.

'It was hard to say him guilty, for the man, we thought, was clear.
But a mob was making clamors that were terrible to hear.'
'Punishment or death!' it shouted, and around began to press;
And of two impending evils, we have chosen him the less.

Thus we legalized the lynchers, we their words to court have brought,
And the innocent convicted! how revolting is the thought!
When a mob has forced a jury to a stand against the right,
All the waters of the ocean cannot make the conscience white.


Once a Negro girl was saucy, and the wife the husband told,
Who in haste arraigned the servant and began to swear and scold.
Then he whipped her without mercy—straightway she to law applied.
Passing strange—they found him guilty, and the judge was sorely tried.
This he said, in making sentence, 'No disfavor comes to you,
You have only done as others, or as I myself would do,
If your servants vex the mistress, thrash them out again, I say,
Go to jail ten minutes only, and a fine of five cents pay!'
If a judge is conscientious, then the people vote him out,
His partiality to white men they must know, beyond a doubt.
No equality for Negroes in the law the world must know,
If he fails to make distinctions, from the bench they'll have him go.
Page This injustice is a cancer, in the nation's breast it lives,
Quietly and unmolested, awful is the death it gives.
Slaves of prejudice, take warning! pause before the nation dies.
All the land is running riot, laws are trampled in the face,
Negroes must be law-abiding; whites alone the laws debase.
Wrong upon itself is coiling, hissing serpent of the times,
Whites in self-defense are crying, 'Shield us from our people's crimes.'
Barbarism fills the country, all for safety take alarm,
From the lowest to the highest, no one now is free from harm;
Anarchy is rife among us, all resulting from the same,
Gross injustice of the court-room brings the nation into shame.
Page Lawlessness is at a premium, woeful penalty it brings,
Relic of the middle ages is the present state of things.
To the winds we now are sowing, and the whirl-wind comes at length,
Evils cast upon the waters come again with added strength. 

Oh come on and see soon, 
Neighbour is blocking road
With injustice in visible noon
Thai is the path, the dark load.

Falling in ignorance and sin, 
He counts the gauze of land
Which is of people  mean
He abducts by illegal hand.

Authorities remain silent
Then to whom we should tell? 
Wild date palm and a tyrant
Today keep steps top last bell.

Oh keep of face in turn in
The time rings by neighbour not
He thinks righteous is thin
And invites of his own sinful plot.

Let us show him the path of light
If he does not obey or not nod
Let him enjoy the fruits of sinful fight. 

It doesn’t need
Nth number of words
Just to say
Umpteen men
Stoop low
To violate
Invade
Coerce
Enslave
Trample 
Oppress
Women
Over and over again
Mindlessly
Estranging
Nature’s fairer sex


Ink on her nose
Ink on her thumb
Her face a pretty rose
She stared pretty dumb.

Blue dots on her pink
Ink on her teeth
When gave her a wink
Stopped her breath.

She was a girl shy
Never smiled her teeth
I didn’t know why
She took away my breath.

The girls are now smart
Bubbly wobbly cute
Speak swift and curt
I loved that girl mute.

Her eyes were deep ocean
Had no hint of flirt
I still have no notion
How she stole my heart.

Her rosy cheeks blue pink
She won’t be back again
Gone with the ink
She’s dead like fountain pen. 

The pain and sorrows in life's hurdle
Are all contained in bottled record.
For our Experience is the ink bottle
Where the dipped pen draws  many words.

The souce of writers' inspirations
From it the passion ink flows through
To weave the lines and compositions
Of life and loves that we once knew.





'He who pursues righteousness and love, finds life, prosperity, and honor.'

Proverbs  -----------------


-
February Philippines


The twinkle of a star 
the color of a car
is never seen and adored
By the one with the Ink-Eyes.

All she sees is the black of night
Only hears anothers plight
To look at great literature and fine art
She never had the chance to start.

Her hate is deep 
For those who can sleep
And dream of great things
But never hear the cries
By the one with the Ink-Eyes. 

When ink in black was called at once
The pen was the judge to do the stunts
With his wig, he swirls the troops of words
He raised the hammer and they look like swords
The papers were trembling and they proclaim
The judgment and point out the blame
they were mused by the pen and his way
and the funny order for that day and every day


I am a poet. 
There is ink in my blood. 
I flow through lines 
As a river meandering its course.
My blood is ink, 
Ink is my blood.
I give life to the depressed
I flow to educate
I flow to enlighten
I meander to caution
I wriggle to chastise
I correct ills in the lands
I flow beyond borders
I flow through out the world.
My ink flows ceaselessly after my departure
It flows to the land I never tread
My ink is my life.
My ink may look ordinary
But it is a potent force.
My ink does not faint
My ink is my blood
So, enjoy the drops of my blood


Once up on a time
Among some other men and women 
Called human rights activists
In a wonderful country  
Sometimes may be yours or not

Covered skin as a righteous character 
Appearing on surface of conflicts
Seems to be the side of victims
Definition today is doubtful 

Fights for rights
It is a job well paid
Elite's cases are handled
Like a lawyer acts

Having not anything bought
Earns more over unexpected
Barking to one side loudly
Licks the other side slowly

Sells killings, violence and tortures 
Yearns conflicts and wars
Writes reports and goes for conferences
Grabs projects and funds from donors 

For the survival 
Consciously or unconsciously
Does not expect 
Peaceful solutions

On the way of helping to charismatic issues
Wishes conflicts to be expanded 
To write reports and statements
With ink of failed conscience

Domesticated heart body and mind
Unwilling to retreat 
Extended greediness
Living in hunting stages

Empathy and sympathy
Gradually dwindled
Shocked heart tears dry up
Killings, disappearance, and abductions
Well trained reports
Fills in the blanks 
Of failed humanity questions


INK PEN
Rema Prasanna


Ink Pens are almost vanished
on a slender line up
however I got one, 
an elegant produce of a distinct range
a precious one father gave me
as a gift, years ago
much before his departure
from a world he loved to live
his life, an art arcade of 
diverse relic remnants
a choice brain worked on 
art of all forms
in a way, I am fortunate to receive
the most sought after 
a fountain pen in blue and gold blend
along with pen, a bottle of 
chelpark blue black ink, a choice of mine, 
from a father who loved words and his daughter.
in a place of refilled genre
and trend of stimulus brands
a place for ink pen I find
to dip in ink and write till I subsist


Ink spilled on a white cloth,
night ran away
after a long sleep.
I recalled the day
when
a crowd stared at me
for
a patch hid a hole in my garment.
The white
and
the black
quarreled.
All existence rests on this duel.

I never wrote about you
it seemed wrong
     too confining

But then, 
I can't NOT write about you
are works from the heart
that which is in it- 
naturally flows out

So now, 
undistinguished
far from the proper, well formed, 
well documented
and over thought words

comes the raw emotion
splotched out in ink


Utterly lost in a world of confusion
From the pain and sorrow there is no seclusion
I don't know what I should do
When I have to choose, in reference to you

You threw me off balance and into the fire
You've got me walking on a tight wire
and though you're there you never tire
and never cease to amaze

Unending desire and ambition
makes me partake another revision
to examine the blueprints of the map 
and the destination of my heart


A twin soul
completing the whole
forever to know
who you are
and if upon me should you speak your pardons
if I should know the wonders of Your heart

Your heart could be mine
to hold in my hands
just as mine 
could be yours
but not yet do we know, if it can eternal withstand
The life we’ve yet to mold

Your scared and nervous
I am too
this is as new to me
as it is to you

one thing I must do
is make sure things, don’t go askew


People that build their houses inland,
People that buy a plot of ground
Shaped like a house, and build a house there,
Far from the sea-board, far from the sound

Of water sucking the hollow ledges,
Tons of water striking the shore,—
What do they long for, as I long for
One salt smell of the sea once more?

People the waves have not awakened,
Spanking the boats at the harbour's head,
What do they long for, as I long for,—
Starting up in my inland bed,

Beating the narrow walls, and finding
Neither a window nor a door,
One salt taste of the sea once more

Charm is deceptive and may not be sincere, 
And beauty of a face may not soon be here.
As fleeting as Time, that faded Yesterday-
Appearances do not last, it can wither Today.

What is inside counts and will clearly show
The heart of the person, her real identity.
The inner beauty that everyone will know
It will always last, reveal truth and reality. 

How to describe wonderful things read on the 
Internet - our body cells are World-aware half 
a second before the slow-moving mammalian 
brain registers anything - training forces us to 
ignore & suppress our intuitive & psychic 

Experience; severing much of our awareness 
of events by which we could save our lives; & 
this information explains why I’m blessed with 
an inner crocodile, and a prescient little alien 
hanging from the rafters in my head
 
Why crocodile & alien have to interrupt my life 
to draw my attention to anything at all: having 
been taught to suffocate my true inner being - 
a knowledgeable reptilian brain-stem sensitive 
alien almost had to kill my strictly controlled
 
Mammal brain to focus me on really important 
things, how glad I am for suffering for so long 
under these inner entities wake-up calls; - the 
best is, we all have such inner beings

When she hugs me
and takes my face to her breasts
the comfort is in my mind
and not in my body.

Love goes beyond words.
True love has thousand colours.

It is the magic of life.
It is like the fluttering wings
of the little butterfly
when it is about to land
on a flower that dances in the wind. 

she is  feeling she is in solitude
but she don't know why this attitude
why she is the worst person according to them? 
is the fault from her or from them? 

she is amazed, hesitated and destroyed from inside, 
she need someone beside
she cant understand the life and the people

her heart is crying
her mind is dying
she is totally collapsed

Your inner creativity needs to be expressed, 
To be made manifest.

Suppress your creativity, 
And you stifle your soul.

Play as children play, 
Express your creativity naturally, 
Spontaneously, 
Then you will know pure joy. 

Blissful awareness
Of harmony in nature, 
Transforms consciousness. 

There is an inner sun in me
radiating in and through.

It depicts my inner harmony.
It manifests love
and  spreads light 
all around me.

It gives me light in my eyes, 
a smile on my lips
and  joy in my heart.
 
Harmony helps prayers sublime
to  reach the heart of the  Highest
Eternal, Never ending and Unseen One.

He conquered me with his love.
He smiled at me and mystified my soul
with his affection and love.

Now I live only for Him, 
the  Lover of my soul 
chanting all along His praises on my lips. 

Angel of light, 
See my face.
From the darkness below.
That very scary place.

Drag me out, 
Please save me
The loneliness is so cold, 
Don't leave me.

I beg for your mercy, 
I am on my knees.
I bow for you in submission.
Just to find my peace.

Help me find a way, 
To escape from my mind
To take my final leave.
No longer being blind.

Angel of light, 
See my sorrow.
From the darkness below
Please before tomorrow.

I can't stand it anymore.
Release me from the madness.
Pull me out of the shadow.
I'm lingering in my sadness. 

If you would see me
Then let this be the time, 
To forever give me peace, 
So my own life could be mine.

Sparkle for me once
Asking me twice
What could you do
So please choose wise.

Angel of light, 
hear my prays
From the darkness below, 
Let me see your face. 


Get away from all our 

The true way to the real self
is in the depths 
of intuitive perceptive faculty, 
in the inner non-physical
space of the soul.

(Reaching for the Sky)I looked outside
On skies of blue—
It was sunny and bright
With incredible hues.

But inside of my heart
Was pouring rain, 
With dark hues
And a cloudy refrain. 

So much has been written
 About peace in the world,
 Peace on earth, peace be with you,
 Shalom.
 
 Peace is more
 Than the absence of war,
 More than tolerance
 More than acceptance.
 
 There can never be peace
 Between individuals or nations,
 Until we are at peace with ourselves
 That inner peace that passes understanding. 

Well below your ego
There's a place that doesn't care
What people say or think or do
It's very peaceful there

This place is deep inside you
It's way beneath your skin
The stillness that surrounds you there
Is you without the spin

It's soul, unspoilt, it's raw
Untouched by human mind
Affected not by boxes
Or labels of any kind

When you can find your inner peace
Anytime or place
No matter what is happening
You have your own calm space


Inner
Peace is a balm— 
Preserver of the soul.
And self. 

You search inner peace in drugs 
and alcohol, in gambling and dice.__
You search it in haram money 
and music and in dens of the vice.__

In the dead of night you disobey 
Hankering after this world will 
you ever find inner peace? __

Will never end your search, 
will never cease your quest.__
For verily, in the remembrance 
Are crushed upon the streams of life.

With nothing to hang on to keep afloat, 
Prayer, my anchor, holds me through the 
strife.

Weeping I fall prostrate at Your feet, 

Your Divine comfort and grace complete, 
Engulfs my soul in infinite length.

Your inner peace surrounds me like walls

The broken, You love- and those who fall, 
The contrite of heart, You redeem from sin.

There is nothing on earth that can give me this, 
Unconditional love and Your inner peace.





 
              ZECHARIAH  ----
July Philippines


From the solid ground I now stand, 
I may say things you may misunderstand-
I am human and can make mistakes, 
But I proved to the world that I am not fake-

I have gone through heaven and hell, 
Getting back up every time down I fell-
Many times my life was prosperous or tight, 
But, in my struggle, I put up a good fight-

By feeling the moments of pain or ecstasy, 
I paved the way toward my own legacy-
Bewitched by the essence of mother's nature, 
I live humble despite of all the pressure-

Now, by taking a new direction, 
I can clearly see my validation-
Successfully overcoming suffering and pain, 
And becoming master of my destiny's domain-


Status quo poetry! 
Mechanically engineered by snobbish math 
Emotions have all graduated from the finest schools, 
And here, spirit has been neutered, 
Nouns have no gender, 
Think tanks without reflection 

Where are the prodigies of substance? 
With passions of cherry red and blinding white? 
Hybrid philosophies, 
Inhibited political propaganda
Endless chatter! 

Show me the unfamiliar poem
Thoughts pass by me as 
Friends before one rushing into death
Oh the insatiable need for expression! 
But to what end? 
What light is it I wish to see? 

That in which, 
Every dawn has its rising sun
In the bowels of the day, 
We walk or run
Sunsets glow then leave our sight
When the clock drops his hands, 
It is then I write, 
Of my inner struggles. 

There is a voice within you
which no one, 
not even you, has ever heard.
When you speak from that deep inner voice, 
You are speaking from your unique
inner tabernacle of your own presence.
Sense the beauty of this inner voice.

Curious sharp prickle plunged 

Only slushy darkness. 

You ever read a book until your eyes 
refused to focus - but you pushed on, 
squinting and adjusting your glasses, 
until you had a headache when you 
put it down? 
 
A book bringing vistas of intense colour, 
sharper images in stunning landscapes 
with scent of agelessly eternal incense, 
where sweet-smelling joy of endless beauty 
awaits your return, everything unchanged, 
only needing reanimation of your fantasy, 
concentration and mood
 
The more open you are, the more the 
story lives and you see nothing in reality 
comes close - it is always changing, too 
open-wide, everyone's is free to change, 
make up their own mind, only in fictional 
choices are you in charge, can keep the 
story unchanged, or make it yours by 
 
Rewriting if you care to, or reading it in 
different ways; the point is joy is in your 
own hands, your interpretation less any 
other's hiding inside the equation- 
 
I respect other's freedoms to  do and 
choose what they want therefore true 
happiness is found in the loops we put 
into reality, without changing anything 
for anybody else, only in stories I find 
edifices standing irrespective of other's 
changing ideas, my mind returns to an 
unchanging landscape, pristine & grand, 
nobody can change it except me
 
Isn't it great, the best way to live one's 
life, holding onto the iron grid of ice-cold 
reality while ensconced in warm dreams 
carousel-riding out of reality, to return 
energised and ready to accept more cold 
outlines while our inner world is on fire

March [ORIGINAL]

Ever read a book until your eyes went out of focus, till 
you have a headache when you put the book down - 
which took you to an  eternal, unchanging place where 
colours are more intense, images sharper, landscape 
beautiful, smelling of incense, eternal, only feelings 
required to  animate  all the images? 
 
The more open you are, the more the story comes alive, 
you realise nothing in reality can come close because every-
body is free to make up their own mind; in fictional alternatives 
you are in charge, keep the story unchanged or rewrite to make 
it yours, reading in various ways if you care to, the joy in your 
own hands, interpretation with nobody else in the equation 
 
Respecting other people's freedom to choose what they want 
means true happiness is in the loops we create to leave inter-
subjective reality without changing anything for anyone else, 
only in stories do we find edifices standing irrespective of other 
people's ideas, my mind returns to an unchanging landscape, 
pristine and grand, nobody can change it except myself
 
Isn't it the best way to live one's life, holding onto the iron 
grid of the ice-cold hologram of reality while ensconced in 
the warm dreams that take us on carousel rides out of the 
cold so we return energised, ready to accept some more 
of the cold outlines - while our inner world is on fire

Let's go find that great blue yonder, 
Far away from noise and rush, 
A place where one can sit and ponder, 
Silently, in a cocoon of hush.

With solitude, to rest one's senses, 
Some time to grasp what life's about, 
To knock down all those rigid fences, 
And let your wildest thoughts fly out.

Allow for all your hopes to wander, 
Into dreams that calm the mind, 
And use the time in that great blue yonder, 
Your innermost happiness to find.

who awakens my being with his deep hidden touches. 

He it is who puts his enchantment upon these eyes 
and joyfully plays on the chords of my heart 
in varied cadence of pleasure and pain. 

He it is who weaves the web of this maya 
in evanescent hues of gold and silver, blue and green, 
and lets peep out through the folds his feet, 
at whose touch I forget myself. 

Days come and ages pass, 
and it is ever he who moves my heart in many a name, 
in many a guise, in many a rapture of joy and of sorrow. 

The bicycles go by in twos and threes -
There's a dance in Billy Brennan's barn to-night,
And there's the half-talk code of mysteries
And the wink-and-elbow language of delight.
Half-past eight and there is not a spot
Upon a mile of road, no shadow thrown
That might turn out a man or woman, not
A footfall tapping secrecies of stone.
I have what every poet hates in spite
Of all the solemn talk of contemplation.
Oh, Alexander Selkirk knew the plight
Of being king and government and nation.
A road, a mile of kingdom, I am king
Of banks and stones and every blooming thing. 

They laughed at one I loved-
The triangular hill that hung
Under the Big Forth. They said 
That I was bounded by the whitethorn hedges
Of the little farm and did not know the world.
But I knew that love's doorway to life
Is the same doorway everywhere.
Ashamed of what I loved
I flung her from me and called her a ditch
Although she was smiling at me with violets.

But now I am back in her briary arms
The dew of an Indian Summer lies
On bleached potato-stalks 
What age am I?

I do not know what age I am,
I am no mortal age;
I know nothing of women,
Nothing of cities,
I cannot die
Unless I walk outside these whitethorn hedges. 

INNOCENCE
Innocence-the uniqueness of childhood
Where do I find thy presence? 
Leading a life of falsehood, 
Being ignorant of my every sense 
To experience thy wonder
I do long for I swear
Trying to justify myself, O Splendour
I search for thee elsewhere! ! 
Waiting to enjoy thy Charms
I stretch out a needy hand
Hoping that thee would lend alms, 
To make me understand.  
Lost is lost and never regained
And for nothing can it be bargained! . 

Mamma, when will I grow tall like you
As now I am looked up by very few; 
I wanna fit into Paapa's shoes
Now for me its very loose! 

When shall I earn money
As now I hardly have few penny; 
I want to grow up and work hard 
And buy for myself a stylish car! 

O mama! when will I grow up and have fun
As now I am only in class One! 

These are the innocent lines put forth
by my six year old; 
Unaware of the life's challenges
Lying in his fold! 

O my dear, why are you in a haste to grow
As then there are many challenges that life will throw; 
Enjoy your childhood my dear
As the only challenge u have to face now is the exam fear! 

No, No, Mamma! I want to grow fast
Challenges, fears, are all things of the past! 

No, my dear! One day when you grow
You will remember your Mamma's word though; 
But now its time for you to do your homework
Oh no Mamma! this is what it really irks

Torn and broken, on the floor.
Was this my wish, or something more? 
The one thing I can never get back, 
Is gone now, no matter the regret.

Shattered and maimed, on the floor.
Can people really be evil to the core? 
They think thirteen was the first time someone tried, 
In reality, I was only five.

These feelings do naught but swirl within; 
Should I ever truly trust in men? 
All in all, a total of three.
Only one can say, 'She trusts in me.'

The occurence did make denial run deep; 
Now here I sit, in shame; no peace.
I've one thing left to say to thee: 
Innocence, you have forsaken me. 

Innocence stolen without my permission
Innocence gone without my submission

Innocence lost through another's plan
Innocence no longer for another man

Innocence turned to hatred and fear
Innocence gone, no man can come near

Innocence taken from a little girls heart
Innocence replaced by mistrust, you thought you were smart

Innocence dissapears like dew in the sun
Innocence faded before it's begun

Innocence obscured like a cloud over the moon
Innocence ripped away too soon


But that which most I wonder at, which most
I did esteem my bliss, which most I boast,
And ever shall enjoy, is that within
I felt no stain, nor spot of sin.

No darkness then did overshade,
But all within was pure and bright,
No guilt did crush, nor fear invade
But all my soul was full of light.

A joyful sense and purity
Is all I can remember;
The very night to me was bright,
'Twas summer in December.

A serious meditation did employ
My soul within, which taken up with joy
Did seem no outward thing to note, but fly
All objects that do feed the eye.

While it those very objects did
Admire, and prize, and praise, and love,
Which in their glory most are hid,
Which presence only doth remove.

Their constant daily presence I
Rejoicing at, did see;
And that which takes them from the eye
Of others, offer'd them to me.

No inward inclination did I feel
To avarice or pride: my soul did kneel
In admiration all the day. No lust, nor strife,
Polluted then my infant life.

No fraud nor anger in me mov'd,
No malice, jealousy, or spite;
All that I saw I truly lov'd.
Contentment only and delight

Were in my soul. O Heav'n! what bliss
Did I enjoy and feel!
What powerful delight did this
Inspire! for this I daily kneel.

Whether it be that nature is so pure,
And custom only vicious; or that sure
And make my soul to feel his love

So early: or that 'twas one day,
Wherein this happiness I found;
Whose strength and brightness so do ray,
That still it seems me to surround;

What ere it is, it is a light
So endless unto me
That I a world of true delight
Did then and to this day do see.

That prospect was the gate of Heav'n, that day
The ancient light of Eden did convey
Into my soul: I was an Adam there
A little Adam in a sphere

Of joys! O there my ravish'd sense
Was entertain'd in Paradise,
And had a sight of innocence
Which was beyond all bound and price.

An antepast of Heaven sure!
I on the earth did reign;
Within, without me, all was pure;
I must become a child again. 

Underneath everything 
that you think and feel, 
Innocence is still in tact.

Time cannot blemish your essence, 
or your portion of spirit.

Do not loose sight of this essence.
Do not mistake yourself 
for your experience.



It’s my all time favorite repose-compartment
Open the pages to see my ingenuous chapters
Wonder why I have lost my innocence supplement
Once, that stance was part and parcel of all my matters! 
Excavation can help me, I take this dig.

Cradle to grade one, infancy free verse at recite
From there a saga of tutoring, a phase of delight
Forever forgiven, naive menaces, a period of elite
It’s time then society norms dictate man’s plight.
Exclusive shots of this dig.

Its now, the virtue lost from face and it’s struck at throat
Costless thrillers, pastime, under the vigilant scanners
Salt water couldn’t heal the pain, but it did pivot 
As a proof of living, had to hold pre-printed banners.
Extensive damage, reports my dig.

Discolored utterances played havoc, gullet to blame
Etiquette pushed into belly to help in digestion claim
Fed with indigestible cereals, system hanged in shame
The so called Innocence departed under the foot into the drain.
Exhibit of my dig –‘Innocence Lost’.

-vidi-


He came thru a window
one nite, 
determined to steal my treasures; 
man made 
So secure in his power to lay fear
or a blade 
with equal measure.

Yet, it it the power of the Divine to protect and to provide
my treasure were kept, 
but it is a shame to learn that innocence lost
is truly irreplaceable. 

Love—harmless, pure and
Innocent—does no wrong, but
Greatly suffers harm. 

Innocent heart, what has happened to you? 
Alas, what is the cure to this pain? 

We are interested, and they are displeased,

I too possess a tongue-
just ask me what I want to say.

Though there is none present without you,

I expected faith from those 
who do not even know what faith is. 

Dear children! think a little, 
Pot, cigar, tabacco and betel, 
All are intoxicants don't touch, 
Lead simple life very much.

Have inoffensive behaviour to all, 
You will rise always, never fall.
Sweet words you always speak, 
Love toward neighbour must keep.

Words like please, excuse me, sorry, 
These relax the fusses, never worry.
Respect to elder person, love yonger, 
Liable to country, don't have anger.

Inoffensive behaviour brings happiness, 
It leads future lives to brightness.
Dear children! always have it, 
Avoid fuss and remain fit.

Called Helpdesk, had pop-ups to get rid of – 
advertisements of men and women for sale, 
sandal posed to kill a bug and mouse to be 
caught for winning a prize of some sort

Balls bouncing, a red button to press, the 
screen alive with pictures of bellies growing 
and shrinking accompanied by promises 
that I could do the same – I know, I see my

Middle region growing daily but the shrinking 
bit never happens; then success, sighing 
with relief – these pop-ups drive everyone 
insane, and I return to my document 

Overlapping responsibilities between ANAC, 
SODEXAM and MIE; oh, I forgot, I’m already 
insane having to work with acronyms that 
never imply a recognisable name-



You say that you feel my pain, but I doubt that
I have x'd myself from your world, & from the world of darkness
I did loose demons & devils. Trapped in a hell that's present on earth
Not from this generation am I & this world shall never hold me
I'm not very wise to many things, but a fool I never will be
The future shall respect my soul, let the present fear me, 
And it will be up to history to be my judge; you can be the jury
Look me in my eyes and tell me what all do you see
Do you see the passion, do you see the love, do you see my heart
Do you feel my pain, do you feel the hate, do you feel my soul dying
You have did everything in this world to me. So I shall do you the same
You say that you live in sanity, well let me introduce you to insane


He came to her, yet she did not believe in what she saw
Dare I say he did no want to frighten her
She had no life but one they for her wrote
Still she remained a mime
But in his eyes-she seemed divine
Was he a creature of her imagination? 
A fairy trick that gods on her played
And on his knees he sang to her
A song of tongue unknown
With silence as the tune
And lust the instruments
In her soul he planted his seed
And no other she desired
A raving creature of the night
And her a dove of angelic pride
Her hesitation was the grave of all the magic in the air that night
She trusted not her own head, nor heart nor sense
And at thus moment to her he crawled
Through the mist and fog of godforsaken land
"Unto this stone I carved the words that from my bleeding heart spawn
With every word and every phrase to you my love 
I dedicate this stone poem of lust, desire and hope"
And to her he sang the song
Of tales unimaginable to her pure perfection
Tales of devilment, love witchcraft and devotion
I cry out loud for all to hear
How much I crave and worship your mere existence
Your reflection in the darkest lake
Your heavenly complexion I protect and place under the spell of time
Still in mournful darkness I spend my nights
With nothing but the image of you in my mind
Was she flattered by his kind and passionate words? 
Or was she bewildered by the atmosphere of twilight in the sky? 
The butterflies and moths of the night
The snakes and spiders on the trees
The forest creatures all were present there this memorable eve
To hold witness to the birth of love
Love so pure
Love between the lonely maid and the figment of her own imagination
Was her mind moved by the tortures that she faced in life
Or was it all a dream? 
Will she ever wake up
Will she find peace and sanity ever again? 
No one will ever know
But one thing that was clear that night
Is that love is wicked
It ain’t kind
The mortal disease of two hearts and minds
That drives us straight into insanity
From where the road is steep 
From where no exit is to be found

Here Stranger rest thee! from the neighbouring towers
Of Oxford, haply thou hast forced thy bark
Up this strong stream, whose broken waters here
Send pleasant murmurs to the listening sense:
Rest thee beneath this hazel; its green boughs
Afford a grateful shade, and to the eye
Fair is its fruit: Stranger! the seemly fruit
Is worthless, all is hollowness within,
For on the grave of ROSAMUND it grows!
Young lovely and beloved she fell seduced,
And here retir'd to wear her wretched age
In earnest prayer and bitter penitence,
Despis'd and self-despising: think of her
Young Man! and learn to reverence Womankind

Art thou a Patriot Traveller? on this field
Did FALKLAND fall the blameless and the brave
Beneath a Tyrant's banners: dost thou boast
Of loyal ardor? HAMBDEN perish'd here,
The rebel HAMBDEN, at whose glorious name
The heart of every honest Englishman
Beats high with conscious pride. Both uncorrupt,
Friends to their common country both, they fought,
They died in adverse armies. Traveller!
If with thy neighbour thou should'st not accord,
In charity remember these good men,
And quell each angry and injurious thought. 

This Sycamore, oft musical with bees,--
Such tents the Patriarchs loved ! O long unharmed
May all its aged boughs o'er-canopy
The small round basin, which this jutting stone
Keeps pure from falling leaves ! Long may the Spring,
Quietly as a sleeping infant's breath,
Send up cold waters to the traveller
With soft and even pulse ! Nor ever cease
Yon tiny cone of sand its soundless dance,
Which at the bottom, like a Fairy's Page,
As merry and no taller, dances still,
Nor wrinkles the smooth surface of the Fount.
Here Twilight is and Coolness : here is moss,
A soft seat, and a deep and ample shade.
Thou may'st toil far and find no second tree.
Drink, Pilgrim, here ; Here rest ! and if thy heart
Be innocent, here too shalt thou refresh
Thy spirit, listening to some gentle sound,
Or passing gale or hum of murmuring bees 

There were two cheerful pronouns 
  And nought did them disturb: 
Until they met, out walking. 
  A conjugative verb. 

The pronouns, child, were You and I, 
  We might as well confess; 
But, ah, the mischief-making verb 
  I leave to you to guess

I am not dead, I have only become inhuman:
That is to say,
Undressed myself of laughable prides and infirmities,
But not as a man
Undresses to creep into bed, but like an athlete
Stripping for the race.
The delicate ravel of nerves that made me a measurer
Of certain fictions
Called good and evil; that made me contract with pain
And expand with pleasure;
Fussily adjusted like a little electroscope:
That's gone, it is true;
(I never miss it; if the universe does,
How easily replaced!)
But all the rest is heightened, widened, set free.
I admired the beauty
While I was human, now I am part of the beauty.
I wander in the air,
Being mostly gas and water, and flow in the ocean;
Touch you and Asia
At the same moment; have a hand in the sunrises
And the glow of this grass.
I left the light precipitate of ashes to earth
For a love-token. 

The Eagle, stooping from yon snow-blown peaks,
For the wild hunter and the Bison seeks,
In the changed world below; and finds alone
Their graven semblance in the eternal stone. 

FOR DOROTHEA L. DIX.

Stranger and traveller,
Drink freely and bestow
A kindly thought on her
Who bade this fountain flow,
Yet hath no other claim
Than as the minister
Drink, and in His peace go


O Traveller, stay thy weary feet;
Drink of this fountain, pure and sweet;
It flows for rich and poor the same.
Then go thy way, remembering still
The wayside well beneath the hill,
The cup of water in his name. 

THE HOUSE

The cornerstone in Truth is laid,
The guardian walls of Honour made,
The roof of Faith is built above,
The fire upon the hearth is Love:
Though rains descend and loud winds call,
This happy house shall never fall.


THE DOORSTEAD

The lintel low enough to keep out pomp and pride:
The threshold high enough to turn deceit aside:
The doorband strong enough from robbers to defend:
This door will open at a touch to welcome every friend.


THE HEARTHSTONE

When the logs are burning free,
Then the fire is full of glee:
When each heart gives out its best,
Then the talk is full of zest:
Light your fire and never fear,
Life was made for love and cheer.



THE SUN-DIAL

Time can never take
What Time did not give;
When my shadows have all passed,
You shall live. 

BENEATH yon eastern ridge, the craggy bound,
Rugged and high, of Charnwood's forest ground
Stand yet, but, Stranger! hidden from thy view,
The ivied Ruins of forlorn GRACE DIEU;
Erst a religious House, which day and night
With hymns resounded, and the chanted rite:
And when those rites had ceased, the Spot gave birth
To honourable Men of various worth:
There, on the margin of a streamlet wild,
Did Francis Beaumont sport, an eager child; 
There, under shadow of the neighbouring rocks,
Sang youthful tales of shepherds and their flocks;
Unconscious prelude to heroic themes,
Heart-breaking tears, and melancholy dreams
Of slighted love, and scorn, and jealous rage,
With which his genius shook the buskined stage.
Communities are lost, and Empires die,
And things of holy use unhallowed lie;
They perish;--but the Intellect can raise,
From airy words alone, a Pile that ne'er decays. 

To me, whom in their lays the shepherds call
Actaea, daughter of the neighbouring stream,
This cave belongs. The fig-tree and the vine,
Which o'er the rocky entrance downward shoot,
Were plac'd by Glycon. He with cowslips pale,
Primrose, and purple lychnis, deck'd the green
Before my threshold, and my shelving walls
With honeysuckle cover'd. Here at noon,
Lull'd by the murmur of my rising fount,
I slumber: here my clustering fruits i tend;
Or from the humid flowers, at break of day,
Fresh garlands weave, and chace from all my bounds
Each thing impure or noxious. Enter-in,
O stranger, undismay'd. nor bat, nor toad
Here lurks: and if thy breast of blameless thoughts
Approve thee, not unwelcome shalt thou tread
My quiet mansion: chiefly, if thy name
Wise Pallas and the immortal muses own. 

Such was old Chaucer. such the placid mien
Of him who first with harmony inform'd
The language of our fathers. Here he dwelt
For many a cheerful day. these ancient walls
Have often heard him, while his legends blithe
He sang; of love, or knighthood, or the wiles
Of homely life: through each estate and age,
The fashions and the follies of the world
With cunning hand portraying. Though perchance
From Blenheim's towers, o stranger, thou art come
Glowing with Churchill's trophies; yet in vain
Dost thou applaud them, if thy breast be cold
To him, this other hero; who, in times
Dark and untaught, began with charming verse
To tame the rudeness of his native land. 

Whoe'er thou art whose path in summer lies
Through yonder village, turn thee where the grove
Of branching oaks a rural palace old
Imbosoms. there dwells Albert, generous lord
Of all the harvest round. and onward thence
A low plain chapel fronts the morning light
Fast by a silent riv'let. Humbly walk,
O stranger, o'er the consecrated ground;
And on that verdant hilloc, which thou see'st
Beset with osiers, let thy pious hand
Sprinkle fresh water from the brook and strew
Sweet-smelling flowers. for there doth Edmund rest,
The learned shepherd; for each rural art
Fam'd, and for songs harmonious, and the woes
Of ill-requited love. The faithless pride
Of fair Matilda sank him to the grave
In manhood's prime. But soon did righteous heaven
With tears, with sharp remorse, and pining care,
Avenge her falshood. nor could all the gold
And nuptial pomp, which lur'd her plighted faith
From Edmund to a loftier husband's home,
Relieve her breaking heart, or turn aside
The strokes of death. Go, traveller; relate
The mournful story. haply some fair maid
May hold it in remembrance, and be taught
That riches cannot pay for truth or love. 

For Dr Henry L Bowditch

With warning hand I mark Time's rapid
flight
From life's glad morning to it's solemn
night;
show
There's Light above me by the shade
below. 

Ye powers unseen, to whom, the bards of Greece
Erected altars; ye who to the mind
More lofty views unfold, and prompt the heart
With more divine emotions; if erewhile
Not quite unpleasing have my votive rites
Of you been deem'd when oft this lonely seat
To you i consecrated; then vouchsafe
Here with your instant energy to crown
My happy solitude. It is the hour
When most i love to invoke you, and have felt
Most frequent your glad ministry divine.
The air is calm: the sun's unveiled orb
Shines in the middle heaven. the harvest round
Stands quiet, and among the golden sheaves
The reapers lie reclin'd. the neighbouring groves
Are mute; nor even a linnet's random strain
Echoeth amid the silence. Let me feel
Your influence, ye kind powers. Aloft in heaven,
Abide ye? or on those transparent clouds
Pass, ye from hill to hill? or on the shades
Which yonder elms cast o'er the lake below
Do you converse retir'd? From what lov'd haunt
Shall i expect you? Let me once more feel
Your influence, o ye kind inspiring powers:
And i will guard it well, nor shall a thought
Rise in my mind, nor shall a passion move
Across my bosom unobserv'd, unstor'd
By faithful memory. and then at some
More active moment, will i call them forth
Anew; and join them in majestic forms,
And give them utterance in harmonious strains;
That all mankind shall wonder at your sway. 

Blurred and fast they race
the intangible senses on my walkway
dragging me through a maze of madness
my perceived traverse of each day! 

As I try to feel them in their fullness
save each as a precious find
they melt away in their secluded recess
leaving me to grope in my mind! 

I search bewitched in their spell
if can find a trace of their tint
but only see upon the trail
their inscrutable footprint! 

Thus I traverse each day
seeking to unravel the maze
of my indecipherable walkway
obscured in yet ungrasped haze

These tiny loiterers on the barley's beard,
And happy units of a numerous herd
Of playfellows, the laughing Summer brings,
Mocking the sunshine on their glittering wings,
How merrily they creep, and run, and fly!
No kin they bear to labour's drudgery,
Smoothing the velvet of the pale hedge-rose;
And where they fly for dinner no one knows -
The dew-drops feed them not - they love the shine
Of noon, whose suns may bring them golden wine
All day they're playing in their Sunday dress -
When night reposes, for they can do no less;
Then, to the heath-bell's purple hood they fly,
And like to princes in their slumbers lie,
Secure from rain, and dropping dews, and all,
In silken beds and roomy painted hall.
So merrily they spend their summer-day,
Now in the corn-fields, now in the new-mown hay.
One almost fancies that such happy things,
With coloured hoods and richly burnished wings,
Are fairy folk, in splendid masquerade
Disguised, as if of mortal folk afraid,
Keeping their joyous pranks a mystery still,
Lest glaring day should do their secrets ill. 

Don't think, 
Just desire! 
Look, insects also do so. 

Waked by his warmer ray, the reptile young
Came wing'd abroad; by the light air upborne
Lighter, and full of soul. From every chink
And secret corner, where they slept away
The wintry storms; or rising from their tombs
To higher life; by myriads, forth at once,
Swarming they pour; of all the varied hues
Their beauty-beaming parent can disclose.
Ten thousand forms! ten thousand different tribes!
People the blaze. To sunny waters some 
By fatal instinct fly; where on the pool
They sportive wheel, or sailing down the stream,
Are snatch'd immediate, by the quick-eyed trout,
Or darting salmon. Through the greenwood glade 
Some love to stray; there lodged, amused, and fed,
In the fresh leaf. Luxurious, others make
The meads their choice, and visit every flower,
And every latent herb; and where to wrap,
In what soft beds, their young yet undisclosed,
Employs their tender care. Some to the house,
The fold, the dairy, hungry, bend their flight; 
Sip round the pail, or taste the curdling cheese;
Oft, inadvertent, from the milky stream,
They meet their fate; or, weltering in the bowl,
With powerless wings around them wrapt, expire. 

Beloved, steal me away 
to your secret hiding places

Let thoughts of me peacefully dwell 
secure in the layers of your mind, 
where your dreams lay, far away from the world
Untainted and carefree

May I dance in your ear, beloved? 
singing songs and sweet nothings to you all day
I carry your words like cymbals on my feet
and your kisses 
like castanets
in my hands


Conceal me in the honest corners of your heart, 
Protect me 
as your greatest 
treasure
for I am yours

Envelope me in your bed, 
tucked away under the cover of your arms
when I am weary of the world and the glare of reality
until my heart beats 
in unison with yours
until there is no more me
and there is no more you
until we become 
inseparable. 

We were never
traditional lovers-
but we were
very good at being
conventional fuckers-


The time was convenient
I suppose
and to this day I remember

In vivid afterimage

the rhythm I used to ride you-
and how you'd shudder
and spit a foul stream of semen
into my ripe body-

I remember
in greater detail
the taste of your tongue
for hours after
you'd left the front door
swinging open-

As if
you were inviting
another pervert in
to take your place
-
these were your friends, 
cold hearted pedophiles
who drooled
at the sight of my
young, plump tits-
firm and sweet
like that apple
poor ol'adam just had to eat.

And later
I was forced to say
' I love you'
in some warped way

By composing mad poems
on your bohemian skin-
it was the only language
I could cipher myself in.

And then later
I admitted
I had to leave you
and you, like a good lover-
remained drowning
in the ashes and smoke
from my virgin fire-

The very fire that
on so many nights
baptized you-

It was a holy suicide
if there is such a thing-


And then much later
the dear john (i hate paper cuts)         
surfaced
and you submerged-

Then came the finality
you had your reality-
and I had mine

And now it's nonsense to say 
' we were better off alone'
because we were heroes together-
in some fanatical
sex ed teacher to willing submissive
kind of way-

And now we're dressing down to
the raw honesty-
you used to refer to me as: 
' a dangerous fatherfucker


      Be it our care that we, too, something that's worthy may see. 

Inside Ayers Rock is lit
with paired fluorescent lights
on steel pillars supporting the ceiling
of haze-blue marquee cloth
high above the non-slip pavers.
Curving around the cafeteria
throughout vast inner space
is a Milky way of plastic chairs
in foursomes around tables
all the way to the truck drivers' enclave.
Dusted coolabah trees grow to the ceiling,
TVs talk in gassy colours, and
round the walls are Outback shop fronts:
the Beehive Bookshop for brochures,
Casual Clobber, the bottled Country Kitchen
and the sheet-iron Dreamtime Experience
that is turned off at night.
A high bank of medal-ribbony
lolly jars preside over
island counters like opened crates,
one labelled White Mugs, and covered with them.
A two-dimensional policeman
discourages shoplifting of gifts
and near the entrance, where you pay
for fuel, there stands a tribal man
in rib-paint and pubic tassel.
It is all gentle and kind.
In beyond the children's playworld
there are fossils, like crumpled
old drawings of creatures in rock. 

Desires are happy lyrics
Paths are dreams
Of good days to come
But stay detached from destinations.
Lines are imprisoned
In circles.

So, keep walking on
Water is the end-all
Of journey in the desert.

Go, if you must
Following mirages
But carry oceans in your eyes.
Pass, if you must
In the forest of glass-encrusted silence
But keep stones of sound with you.
Live, if you must
Inside domes
But keep a door open! 


-in this silence in this darkness
lights just caressed the darkened hues
growing silences just a sound of comings. 
 
falls raindrops of hopes 
into the cave of dreams
.  

and water flowing calm inside 
all eyes of power falling on
eyes that long to see more dreams

within without
without within

within me arose a being
and within me proclaims an end
bitterness might fade
drunk with aliveness

like the stones in the river unmoved
ready to run like the river

the force within me rain
forces of the river run in the veins
a river runs within me
without a name
death dead

again
run mad
rapturously towards the sea of happiness
and I found your golden hairs float on
and you dance into ocean of yourself


Some can detect malevolence 
which masquerades as innocence.
They see at once through the pretence
 alerted by their inner sense.
Some take new friends at face value 
an all too common thing to do.
Accepting that their words are true.
 Something which they may later rue. 
The warning signs are there to see
 you pick them up subconsciously. 
So you should listen carefully 
and trust your instincts completely.
 Before you finally decide
 to accept them as bona fide.




A mysterious world we have
Where human beings exist 
Love, beauty and sex misshape the history
Missing the adjectives of strength, courage and tear of humanity
 
In a polarized and paralyzed realm of his- story
A woman gives a simile and a metaphor 
To the rising moon, being a parasite of the sun 
Bearing the suffer inside itself and outside itself
 
Being a mother of earth up to the sky
By tips of mountain breast flows
Maternal pain into a milky love
To bud the universe in her glance
 
The truth created of historical lines in chapters
Justified form of human epistemology hung on
To neglect the status of her greatness   

 For an ontological equity to episteme  
Time still crawls for hundreds years
Through the struggle never ended
Until to see the redefinition and beauty of nature
In that to re-create the soul and body of the whole


Inside of each man lies an inner thirst
That goes beyond the finite atom
It has been there ever since the first
Man on earth, by sin, to doom had come.
That thirst is inborn in his heart
A vacuum of hunger for his soul
Something this world can never impart
But Living Water can make him whole.
Where does he drink from such a well? 
Where would he find such lasting fulfillment? 
The Word is His Truth, it is there to tell
For everyone thirsty there is contentment..   Tax not the royal Saint with vain expense, 
   With ill-matched aims the Architect who planned--
   Albeit labouring for a scanty band
   Of white-robed Scholars only--this immense
   And glorious Work of fine intelligence!
   Give all thou canst; high Heaven rejects the lore
   Of nicely-calculated less or more;
   So deemed the man who fashioned for the sense
   These lofty pillars, spread that branching roof
  Self-poised, and scooped into ten thousand cells,
  Where light and shade repose, where music dwells
  Lingering--and wandering on as loth to die;
  Like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof
  That they were born for immortality. 

Look at inside my open heart, 
Hear beat comes it does start.
Cart of life depends on mart, 
Heart is really important part.

Apart from it nobody is smart, 
This is beautiful key life's  heart.
Wonderful creation this is sure, 
Love understands a heart pure.

This cures many injuries in mind, 
In wave of love to all does bind.
Kindness dwells in that all like, 
Heart remains in life ever in hike.

A person with open heart knows, 
The secret of life often he shows.
He realizes each beat by life grace, 
Father of heaven gives nice face.

Inside open heart soon hold faith, 
Definitely will go far unseen wraith.
Come on all with heart soon do nod.
 
outside, airline crews doing all sorts of things to prepare
jets for take off in all directions.

A jet sitting right up close to the window, peeking in at 
me, curiously it seems, a few people are sitting about, 
taking picture of the architecture, paintings, etc.

Things of interest scattered about the interior of the air-
port, many people have taken off, leaving this area pretty
empty right now, as I sit here and wait for my flight to 
Hong Kong. 

Inside the forest  
Synchronized diversity 
Hermit takes a gun


Life, a potion kept in a goblet
How does it taste? 

Spicy, 

Tangy, 

Bitter

Or

Sweet? 

I don't know.

All I know is; 

It isn't too sweet to be quaffed off
Nor too bitter to be spitted out!. inside your mind

mind you
magic is in you
start counting
if your fingers fail

that brain
where add zeros 
of neurons branching out inside
pause
think over
deeper
so it’s possible to count

your brain can know
one hundred trillion things
your and mine
add on
what wonder can we not do

Storm clouds gathering in my mind, traipsing through
it's skyway, watching everything beneath them.
Living on the insides of silver linings, being
suffocated by the closeness gathered around me.
Sunshine peering through it all as I watch it in my
mind while writing.

                 ( a.

)Counting all sins against humanity, holding them account-
able on every individual responsible for evil of their 
own hearts.

Taking away their dreams of grandeur, riches, one world
order, destroying them from the inside out, tearing apart
their insidious evil.

Showing the true colors of isis and muslims for they are
no freedom, just slavery of women and children.

Their lust and depraved mentalities keeping them from ad-
mitting the truth, that muslim men are gay for they rape
and have sex with boys, yet they kill others for what they
themselves practice daily. 

Careening down pathways, 
running to meet melodic harmonies
as they tickle my brain with 
insidious feelings. 

In sight
your eyes say
I have to leave you
because I need to stay.
I am blind, 
love is, they tell me.
The two people inside me
have agreed, 
fought bitter battles, 
near to the death fights. 
bit I won through.
After careful preparation
decide to stay, 
live on to fight
another day
with an image of your eyes
saying go away, 
insoluble. 

Leaves, branches, trees waving good-bye to me
and playing a beautiful symphony with the 
gentle breeze.

It touches my soul and draws me nearer to

Stepping softly to beats of my being, 
allowing them to alter meanings and
recognize them with each new appearance
before me. 

Insight into sadness is tactile, keen, hurtful, yet helps us get through our grief in time.
Always taking whatever comes into our lives and assimilating it as best we can.
Never perfect, we wallow in tears at times, not wanting to go on living.  
Listening to our heartbeat's rhythm, pumping away at life, as tears flow constantly with every reminder and memory brought to mind. 

Twilight gathering stars in my mind, twinkling rhythms in 
the beauty of this brand new night.

Welcoming the essence of it's tiny particles that can be
seen in this darkness.

Moonlight shining across pathways of intellect, showing
the way through the ultimate blackness of another time.

Giving us all an insight into the dark night of our souls, 
upon us again. 

Whirlpools spinning my mind into and out of reality's
turmoil, making it hard to sustain sanity at times.

Thought processes whirl, giving insight into many
areas of wisdom as I age and mature.

Looking around, searching for some answers, trying to
prepare for the future which I know absolutely nothing
about right now.

Wishing to escape this world, knowing it will happen
on the day it's supposed to, without any effort at all.

Looking forward to it's bluened peace with great
anticipation, enjoying the comfort and serenity it gives
me even now, as I think of it calmly without reservations
or doubts. 

Can you see a transformation deep within my eyes? 
A departing of imagination, something slowly dies
Insipid languor has removed all passion from my mind
A renovation of my thoughts that leaves me undefined

Something is retiring and nothing takes its place
Nothing is inspiring and something’s been erased


Rocking to the tempo of incessant beats, strengthening ties 
with suicidal thoughts deluding my mind.
Walking, spacing steps as they parade onto dance floors of 
wood and taking paces as life falls down around me.  
Keeping lines in crooked precipices, furthering the sadness 
as it envelopes my being with insistent callings from beyond.
Seething clouds, storming on lands of imaginary reality, 
hoping to alight one day on a happy island.  
Joining the fortitude of old timers in their days, measuring 
the lines of total abandonment as worry takes itself away and
dives into the deepest silence ever provoked by death. 

Lights dancing prayerfully across the horizon, focusing their
brilliance in many directions all at once.

Stirring imagination, tugging at memories past, wishing for
some company, hoping friends will call.

Holding tightly to a thread, inner loneliness calls, it's
whisper echoes throughout my small eternity.

Grasping at straws, tears fighting to streak out, held back
by insistent emptiness, afraid to let anyone see the heartache
fast asleep inside.

Pathways lighted by candle flames, guiding me to an answer
brought from heaven.

Scarcely living a fruitless life, exhibiting within, a faith
deeper than any known to man.

hands with angels, invisible to the naked eye.

Seen only from the soul, awaiting a reply, my guardian angel
smiles at me, prepares my soul for it's final journey.

Peace descends upon me, a gentle whisper kisses my mind, and

Being blessed with earthly death, reminiscent no more of the
sorrow and pain I have intensely felt through life.

Like a beacon in my mind, reaching out, seeing beyond sight, 

Softly crawls a melody, encapsulating my mind with
soothing vibrant tones, alleviating worries and 
stress of living.

Besides imagination, life is a mere category of 
belief, intent always on insistent faith of 
matters, earthly. 

Love once again has been torn and ripped apart by
death's insistent embrace.
All of life is futile against it's strength, no
one can conquer this ending of earthly life.  
heaven as He repairs our hearts forever. 

Searching through movements set to music, and taking
the motions to hear.
Whiling away the technicalities of insistent life as
particular bits of yesterday filter themselves through.
Characterizing the many facets being portrayed in 
visions of silent undertakings.
Sincerely putting thoughts into deeper categories 
where they can find even more selections to adhere to.
Whispers of conversations continue to follow paths      
least traveled and going off onto trails made by wild
animals.
Creating on every level, thought on the spur of the 
moment.
Carefully moving into sequences of tomorrow's pastimes
with ideas held tightly in fists of hands.
Punching their way through tangled underbrush and way-
ward vines, closing in and blocking entrances to some
other land. 

Measures of life stand on their own, 
bringing purpose into the picture.
Universally leading processions of 
talented musicians on tours through
rhythm and it's beginnings.
Allowing infuriating situations to 
be calmed by an insistent melody, 
portraying lightening, quickening 
pulses of tonal quality. 

Listening to funky music, moving and grooving to the
rhythms as they balance themselves in intellect.

Watching their see saw motions, keeping me aware of
what they are doing all the time.

While an insistent picture of thought continues to 
stay silently in my mind, waiting.

Steady and implicit, softening and absorbing the 
melodies and harmonies tickling my insides with much
laughter and giggles.

Thinking through awesome memories of teenager days, 
taking them all together, writing with their essence
into this poem.

Liking what is seen and heard as I sit here, stepping
in time with the motion of rhythm, never missing a 
step throughout many measures.

Lasting through each and every song, all pleasure and
joy continue building themselves throughout every en-
joyable melody. 

An insolent tongue will face a time harsh
in any harvest to come
as tears can not be easily picked up.

.  

Για την αυθάδικη γλώσσα σκληροί οι καιροί.
Στον όποιο θέρο και να  'ρθεί
δύσκολο τα δάκρυα να σταχυολογεί. 

Thin are the night-skirts left behind
         By daybreak hours that onward creep,
         And thin, alas! the shred of sleep
     That wavers with the spirit's wind:
     But in half-dreams that shift and roll
         And still remember and forget,
     My soul this hour has drawn your soul
             A little nearer yet.

     Our lives, most dear, are never near,
       Our thoughts are never far apart,
       Though all that draws us heart to heart
   Seems fainter now and now more clear.
   To-night Love claims his full control,
       And with desire and with regret
   My soul this hour has drawn your soul
           A little nearer yet.

   Is there a home where heavy earth
       Melts to bright air that breathes no pain,
       Where water leaves no thirst again
   And springing fire is Love's new birth?
   If faith long bound to one true goal
       May there at length its hope beget,
   My soul that hour shall draw your soul
           For ever nearer yet. 

Your eyes
Roaming the ceiling
Past midnight
In a fright

If i had any judgement and skill
of my own
sleep
would have lost its freewill
and i would have had it
on tap. 

The moon in the bureau mirror
looks out a million miles
(and perhaps with pride, at herself,
but she never, never smiles)
far and away beyond sleep, or
perhaps she's a daytime sleeper.

By the Universe deserted,
she'd tell it to go to hell,
and she'd find a body of water,
or a mirror, on which to dwell.
So wrap up care in a cobweb
and drop it down the well

into that world inverted
where left is always right,
where the shadows are really the body,
where we stay awake all night,
where the heavens are shallow as the sea
is now deep, and you love me. 

Now you hear what the house has to say.
Pipes clanking, water running in the dark,
the mortgaged walls shifting in discomfort,
and voices mounting in an endless drone
of small complaints like the sounds of a family
that year by year you've learned how to ignore.

But now you must listen to the things you own,
all that you've worked for these past years,
the murmur of property, of things in disrepair,
the moving parts about to come undone,
and twisting in the sheets remember all
the faces you could not bring yourself to love.

How many voices have escaped you until now,
the venting furnace, the floorboards underfoot,
the steady accusations of the clock
numbering the minutes no one will mark.
The terrible clarity this moment brings,
the useless insight, the unbroken dark. 

Ohh. . 

Insomnia
The old and tired maiden
With nothing to offer but sleepless promises and pain
Dressed in thoughts that bothered you all day long
And wearing jewelery of bills to pay and quarrels that must be settled
She comes uninvited
And spends as much time as pleases
She might leave if you pop two of these
But will return no doubt after the acids in your stomach have finished their work. 
Insomnia. . 

whose child are you? 
Is your mother Worry and your father Pain
Are you the Kin of Trouble and Discomfort
And are your cousins Misery and Ache. 
Why do you knock on our doors late at night
And stay till the morning when the sun greets our eyes? 
Tell me Insomnia.  

have you come to wed me? 
Be my wife and lifelong companion? 
Or are you here as a cheap whore from the bar? 
Simply having some fun. 
Answer me please. 
I have suffered enough.  

If we meet again tonight, 
i choose not to recognize your familiar embrace.
I will pretend that we do not meet and spend countless hours
beneath an omniscient and mercurial moon
together.
I will not speak your name aloud or 
whisper of a quiet desperation for 
sleeping and the peace it brings.
You seem to find me a familiar plaything
and you are a habit
I am powerless to break. 

Some nights it's bound to be your best way out,
When nightmare is the short end of the stick,
When sleep is a part of town where it's not safe
To walk at night, when waking is the only way
You have of distancing your wretched dead,
A growing crowd, and escaping out of their
Time into yours for another little while;

Then pass ghostly, a planet in the house
Never observed, among the sleeping rooms
Where children dream themselves, and thence go down
Into the empty domain where daylight reigned;
Reward yourself with drink and a book to read,
A mystery, for its elusive gift
Of reassurance against the hour of death.
Order your heart about: Stop doing that!
And get the world to be secular again.

Then, when you know who done it, turn out the light,
And quietly in darkness, in moonlight, or snowlight
Reflective, listen to the whistling earth
In its backspin trajectory around the sun
That makes the planets sometimes retrograde
And brings the cold forgiveness of the dawn
Whose light extinguishes all stars but one. 

Sweet muse
with bitter milk,
I have lain
between your breasts,
put my ear
to your sea-shell-whispering navel,
& strained the salty marshes
of your sex
between my milk teeth.
Then I've slept at last,
my teeming head
against your rocking thigh.

Gentle angry mother
poetry,
where could I turn
from the terror of the night
but to your sweet maddening
ambivalence?
Where could I rest
but in your hurricane?
who would always take me home
but you,
sweeping off the sooty stoop
of your wind-filled shack
on the edge
of the volcano

There are some nights when
sleep plays coy,
aloof and disdainful.
And all the wiles
that I employ to win
its service to my side
are useless as wounded pride,
and much more painful. 

Walls of night surround me 
crowding hard and closing in.

Tonight’s sleep 
yet another failed marathon, 
alone except for the clocks
whose beats break my silence.

The stage is set, the actors here 
but a heart’s reel of film
shows only reruns on a lonely night.

Maddening clocks!  All-knowing, 
counting out their beats, 
each slow as a tear, 
loud, yet oddly a whisper.

I’m sorry to intrude, 
yet I'm awed by their blending
of my insomniac sadness
into their nightly concerts.

The ticking, tocking, 
at once both friend and foe.

No way to forget, 
yet so afraid I might, 
and feeling quite alone. 

Mr. Musk-Rat inspected my davenport
Not wearing  Bengalee dhui-panjabi 
But putting on goggles, tie-hat-coat..
Turned pages one after another
Of the copy of my new poems.
Suddenly Mr. M. R. flew into rage, 
Grumbled, ‘All nonsensical, gibberish' 
Who the stupid? Who wrote? 
Then purging litter on the pages
Made another comment,  "Expect vote? 
You  wretch of a poet! worthless! 
Your composition all grotty inedible, 
Even wouldn't  be crunched by  Mr. Goat


And blesses us; 
The work we choose should be our own, 

If with light head erect I sing, 
Though all the Muses lend their force, 
From my poor love of anything, 
The verse is weak and shallow as its source. 

But if with bended neck I grope 
Listening behind me for my wit, 
With faith superior to hope, 
More anxious to keep back than forward it; 

Making my soul accomplice there 
Unto the flame my heart hath lit, 
Then will the verse forever wear-- 

Always the general show of things 
Floats in review before my mind, 
And such true love and reverence brings, 
That sometimes I forget that I am blind. 

But now there comes unsought, unseen, 
Some clear divine electuary, 
And I, who had but sensual been, 

I hearing get, who had but ears, 
And sight, who had but eyes before, 
I moments live, who lived but years, 
And truth discern, who knew but learning's lore. 

I hear beyond the range of sound, 
I see beyond the range of sight, 
New earths and skies and seas around, 
And in my day the sun doth pale his light. 

A clear and ancient harmony 
Pierces my soul through all its din, 
As through its utmost melody-- 
Farther behind than they, farther within. 

More swift its bolt than lightning is, 
Its voice than thunder is more loud, 
It doth expand my privacies 
To all, and leave me single in the crowd. 

It speaks with such authority, 
With so serene and lofty tone, 
That idle Time runs gadding by, 
And leaves me with Eternity alone. 

Now chiefly is my natal hour, 
And only now my prime of life; 
Of manhood's strength it is the flower, 
'Tis peace's end and war's beginning strife. 

It comes in summer's broadest noon, 
By a grey wall or some chance place, 
Unseasoning Time, insulting June, 
And vexing day with its presuming face. 

Such fragrance round my couch it makes, 
More rich than are Arabian drugs, 
That my soul scents its life and wakes 
The body up beneath its perfumed rugs. 

Such is the Muse, the heavenly maid, 
The star that guides our mortal course, 
Which shows where life's true kernel's laid, 
Its wheat's fine flour, and its undying force. 

She with one breath attunes the spheres, 
And also my poor human heart, 
With one impulse propels the years 
Around, and gives my throbbing pulse its start. 

I will not doubt for evermore, 
Nor falter from a steadfast faith, 
For thought the system be turned o'er, 

I will not doubt the love untold 
Which not my worth nor want has bought, 
Which wooed me young, and woos me old, 
And to this evening hath me brought. 

My memory I'll educate 
To know the one historic truth, 
Remembering to the latest date 
The only true and sole immortal youth. 

Be but thy inspiration given, 
No matter through what danger sought, 
I'll fathom hell or climb to heaven, 
And yet esteem that cheap which love has bought.

Fame cannot tempt the bard 
Nor laurel him reward 
Who has his Maker's nod. 

I am inspired by the thoughts
That race inside my head.
I am inspired by the emotions
Of my heart, when broken.
I am inspired by the friends
Who hold me up through hard times.
I am inspired by the world
When it awakes under a blanket of dew.
I am inspired by my love
For a girl, far away, who has captured my life.
These are my inspiration.

Stood I, knocking all day long,
But the Angel, calm and cold,
Still refused and bade me, 'Hold.'

Then a breath of soft perfume,
Then a light within the gloom;
Thou, Love, camest to my side,
And the gates flew open wide.

Long I dwelt in this domain,
Knew no sorrow, grief, or pain;
Now you bid me forth and free,
Will you shut these gates on me

What a gift it is to inspire
even with no desire
one heart holds another, so dear
in a Glorious embrace
as if filtered air
traveled in time
to its destination 
weaves a beauty of unknown kind
we may not know this mystical ways
and magical powers
the only thing remains
so alive and sacred
is the unseen part
of experience itself
you know, like a tender whisper
somewhere without a recognition 
you may feel it once 
when the wind crosses your path
and plays with your hair
but untangles a melody
so it touches you with hands not seen 
I may say that, i may
 as the only description that I may be aware of
yet it lingers in deeper thoughts
of consciousness 
so we may travel here to destinations
so dear to us
we long for them every moment
as we sleep in the night hours
and the wolf is awake 
sending his vice upon the moons gaze 
it is all about inspiration
touching the notes not yet discovered 
traveling the veins injecting its power
with a potent venom
 inspiration they write about
in the books, we all read them
trying to touch those parts 
belonging to the ravens 
that sing their songs
discovering the tunnels 
to everlasting songs
sang so well with just nurturing sounds 
 ~capturing nothing more
~Inspiration


Inspiration can't be seen.

I mean-you can only feel it.

Your wit won't help a bit

So that to convey the feelings, 

To create a real art

That comes straight from the heart, 

Like a holy writ recommit


How do I feel my inspiration? 

It's not a certain motivation, 

But only my emotions

And certain commotions.

Just the same in other words: 

Inspiration is like birds or -

It is something very crazy, 

Something very lazy, 

Something weepy, 

Something very sleepy, 

Something very heavy

Or impossibly high.

This something

Becomes suddenly light, 

Light as a cloud, and flies, 

Flies, flies, flies, flies-

Up to the moment it dies.

 


The h of September,y pen is poised, what shall I write, 
The mind is 'dark', it needs some light, 
Some 'inspiration' would be enough
To trigger the fingers and do a rough
Transcript of thoughts which might be pleasing, 
But somehow at present, I'm into squeezing
My brain, to think up a suitable start, 
Why aren't I a person who's 'grey matter' is smart, 
When out of the blue a sentence appears, 
The brain reacts and the numbness clears, 
To reveal a startling piece of Lit, 
That suddenly becomes a Hit, 
That would be great, but the chances are, 
A million to one! Oh! Lets retire to the bar! 

 Is inspiration, eager to pursue, 
But rather like a maiden, fond, yet coy, 
 Who gives herself to him who best doth woo.

Once she may smile, or thrice, thy soul to fire, 
 In passing by, but when she turns her face, 
Thou must persist and seek her with desire, 
 If thou wouldst win the favor of her grace.

And if, like some winged bird she cleaves the air, 
 And leaves thee spent and stricken on the earth, 
Still must thou strive to follow even there, 
 That she may know thy valor and thy worth.

Then shall she come unveiling all her charms, 
 Giving thee joy for pain, and smiles for tears; 
Then shalt thou clasp her with possessing arms, 
 The while she murmurs music in thine ears.

But ere her kiss has faded from thy cheek, 
 She shall flee from thee over hill and glade, 
So must thou seek and ever seek and seek
 For each new conquest of this phantom maid. 

Inspiration is they key , the key  to our hearts.
Inspiration comes from our hearts and mind and soul.
Creating words, creating actitves and other things thats in our minds.
Just like freedom on our USA flag we can captrue  that moment on paper, video or in a picture.


    INSPIRATION IS THE KEYI wake up to a beautiful morning
Each time your image comes to mind
Your voice is so encouraging
Makes waking and living so divine

I would go to work inspired
Knowing that you are around
You always make me feel admired
Makes the day’s trials easy to overcome

At night before I sleep I pray
That you come in and grace my dream
Should I wake up the next day
I would feel the same or yet more extreme


When I looks for another day
That helps to lead the life
I intend to see the smiling faces
Where kindness and joy is filled
When my sorrows are vanished
Smiles gives us a feeling of welcome
Smiles comes from the heart of love
The mind gives an inspiration to smile
Smile a sign of virtue, pure, and simple
May we smile and give right signal
When the world over sees negative signals. 

Attempting to beat the personal record of writing one
hundred twenty two poems in one day.

Taking on the mysterious fathoms of knowledge, going
sveltely into the subconscious mind.

All things being awakened in the mist of atmospheres
coming from another dimension and investigation.

Discovering interior purposes of all things arranged
in bouquets of inspiration. 

Clowning around, playing ambiguous games, 
enjoying fun times with glorious aspirations.
Keeping time religiously with rhythm, 
inundating daily breaths of inspiration. 

Crossing ivories with talented precision, taking off to another dimension for creative intuition to become itself in being.
Writing on clouds of inspiration as thought melds with subconscious ideas, making images appear interiorly with spiritual vitality.
Critically adjusting attitudes throughout myriads of experiences on horizons of everlasting piety and soulful prayer. 

Sauntering down pathways of nature, exploring adventurously, 
finding exploration is a joy when using innate talent to 
explain it on paper.

Swirling and bending, finding new paths out of nowhere, 
leading to beautiful encounters with novel aspects of nature's
bounty.

Sizing up courtyards of inspiration as they fill my mind
spaciously. 

Wonder of a child fixed permanently in my mind, aiding me in an imaginational creativeness, keeping everything new before me.
Fixating on all I see with a genuine curiosity throughout life.
Feelings of peace keep me whole - keep me sane - in this poverty-stricken life of beauty.
Rich beyond earthly standards, filled with a subconscious joy of writing.
I sincerely enjoy every moment, hiding behind pen and paper for an entire lifetime. 

We are granted a fixed quantum of time
Each second passes with a silent chime
But like a strident alarm clock
Time impinges on us like a loud knock

As the pendulum of time swings
Each day, to infinity steadily wings
Time is like a diminishing bank account
Nothing can be added to the existing amount

Time wasted should be our greatest regret
It is precious and irredeemable, never forget
Before infirmities set in, earn what you can
For man on Earth has only a short span


When in poverty wallows the multitude 
One of sharing should be our attitude 
       But do not ever count it as our magnitude 
 
       Do not hoard wealth more than we need 
       Or merely to satisfy our enormous greed 
       From our abundance, when the poor we feed 
       From the clutches of selfishness we'll be freed 

When many around us wail in gloom
And perish under poverty's inescapable doom
We are bound to share to help them bloom


When you find yourself in gloom
Take time to watch Nature in bloom
The beauty around can give you delight
And your soul will slowly open to light! 

Watch the loveliness of the clean azure sky
Enjoy the V formation of birds flying high
Sit back and listen to Nature's delightful sounds
In her company, all your sadness drowns

      Look at the trees with fluttering leaves
Feel the breeze that roams through fields
Count the bees that carry the cargo of honey
Thrilled you'll be by Nature's magic symphony

Home should be made a place of love
A stable shelter from all storms of life
Within the walls of a happy home, I avow
There shall be no room for stress or strife

 It is not merely a roof above our head
 But a haven where all dissensions disappear
 Where each one is bound by love's thread
 And the river of life runs smooth and clear 

A place to turn to when heavy with care
The love received there is balm to every scar
After the day's toil an abode to happily retire
A simple dwelling with not even a palace on par


Through rugged paths as we pass
And by the tests of life when we tire
Know, it's to make us glitter like brass
Just as a rod of iron is forged in fire! 
 
Remember, the wisdom we have earned
Was never got through easy and facile ways
Our strength, not without trials, garnered 
When we indolently relaxed on sunlit days

Vital it is how we respond to life's adversity
Here we have more of cares than cheers
If we sit immobilized by misfortune's gravity
The joys of life will slip unnoticed through our fingers


Utter words of warmth to all you meet 
If not possible, give a pleasing smile! 
Every one can offer it absolutely free of cost 
Sure it will leave the world less hostile.

Lend your ears to what others have to say
Having none to share is the greatest bane
When you listen, their frustration you allay
And rid them of all their unvoiced pain

Visit someone who is left desolate and lonely
Your presence will relieve them of their pain
Such a gesture will be counted as godly
It will give them a joy, they can hardly feign

Try always to sow the seeds of cheer
And make everyone happy around
To the needy, some little help volunteer
And feel for those in sorrow drowned
 
When we strive to take others’ cares away
No doubt, the purpose of our life fulfills
And peace and joy in our lives come to stay
For love is the panacea to all human ills


Talents the gift to humans
Great to the world
Good memories of past
Good events of the present
Good hopes to the future
Talents varied talents matter.

One have talent to sing
Another to draw pictures
One to sculpture beautifully
Another to speech, and imitate
The talents are several
Achievements greater always.

In number of lines one expresses
Cartoon we always likes
Expressions of great thoughts
Creative thoughts and criticisms
The cartoonist is a blessed talent.

The melodious songs and singer
The talent of singing
Command the gathering in spirit
And even tempted to bodily movements
Enjoying the music concerts
A great happiest event for humans.

The drawing of pictures, paintings
The artists we call them
Great talent the inborn talent
Together with the patience they shows
They makes happier and enjoyable
Even can bridge the rift of humans.

Inspire the talented children
The hope of tomorrow they gives
The great achievement to the world
Talent is supreme a divine gift. 

Each star is a beauty of love in its prime
Charming lovers since dawn of time
Her shine and charm is her guitar
The tones of her light reach so  far
Even mars can hear her pulse and hum 

Then Venus, pleaded to be as beautiful 
and raised his thumb
The moon at noon awaits what more will come 
and so the heart in deep passion beats the drum
she set his  heart in an orange bliss
and thence his mind in compassion seeks 

but what the mother sun will say 
When all were inspired by her orange cheeks
She is her star equal, but shall make way 
Even earth, for by her charm, will obey


A man is inspire when  the star is seen everyday
The sweet sore love does lack control
Even so, man still pursuing in his goal
To calm the soul or set passion on firefor the Filipino vocalist Arnel Penida

I can do nothing
but sing about it
and so  am  I relieved
from the pain

It is the Journey music
caressing my burdened shoulders
as a heavy bomb
threatening my inner breathing lungs

Lying beside
the Journey's Open Arms
exiting now from the dark

Softly whispering
biting the tounge of happiness
as total inspiration
a soul-surrendering
thru an open song
touching rugged heart


Restlessly listening to music on my walkman, moving to
the rhythm without thinking, not caring if others think
it's funny or not, just liking it.
Satisfying my poetical spirit, enjoying the enormous
difference it makes in my little life.
Always ready to listen to rhythms, that inspire my soul
to write whatever it wants to. 

Writing through the night, greeting a darkened morning at midnight with an expression of happiness.
Traveling through a repertoire of blending thoughts, writing them each in many words and sentences, forming poems from the essence and passion of my inner voice.
Having been silent all of life, now they are being voiced loudly through musical poundings of rhythmical words, dancing through the nights I have left in this life.
Bringing fruitful designs to many minds and inspiring people to use their talents exclusively to help others find themselves. 

Spreading music laughingly about the room, along with an exquisite energy of belly dancing.
Folding stress and putting it away for the time being, silencing any problems standing in the way of promoting a peacefulness of the soul.
Taking a rapid avenue to serenity, music brings it totally into being, expressing it in a lively and energetic stance, qualifying every step with an acrimonious piercing of the atmosphere, equipping every single moment with a vision of propensity.
Across and back, pointing ahead to a center of focus, inspiring every passage of neurons to open up and let in every particle of imagination to be examined and used, instead of lying in depths, never to expire again, because they're etched in memory. 

Confined within these walls
wanting to break free
trying to scratch my way out

Listening to droning voices
talking about molecules
indigestion and digestion
Releasing stomach acids
breaking the bonds of molecules
Just add water

Instant freedom
complete with rebellion and battle
Just add water
To break away from structure
to break free from similar groups
to initiate a reaction
Just add water


So vile and primal, 
A horrid beast within all men.
The animal that we are not meant to be, 
Locked inside of you and me.

Barred by our fleshy bodies.
Clawing at our rib cages.
They thirst to be free.
Hungry for lust and survival.

Common People, Madmen, and Poet alike, 
Each have this untamed spirit to calm.
How you deal with this creature, 
Is what makes you truly you, 

Some chose to tame it.
Some let it run wild.
Some try to restrain it.
Some can't take it and become suicidal.

It all is determined on what you do. 
Isn't that what life is about most days? 
The Instinct that tells how to conquer the day.
Is roaring, growling, rumbling deep within you.  

Be still my heart, that postures and postulates
Stop to dream, to wish and care
Desist your thumps and thuds that aggravate
Flesh and blood, no romance there
Be gone, old heart which flounders and fails
Give me love so I can live
No more hurt from old time tales
Nothing left for me to give
Enough, dear heart, that breaks and tears
Trade your strength for a moment’s bliss 
Drown in blood, my worldly cares
Lost forever in beauties kiss


When I attain to utter forth in verse
Some inward thought, my soul throbs audibly
Along my pulses, yearning to be free
And something farther, fuller, higher, rehearse
To the individual, true, and the universe,
In consummation of right harmony:
But, like a wind-exposed distorted tree,
We are blown against for ever by the curse
Which breathes through Nature. Oh, the world is weak !
The effluence of each is false to all,
And what we best conceive we fail to speak.
Wait, soul, until thine ashen garments fall,
And then resume thy broken strains, and seek
Fit peroration without let or thrall. 

He woke up in a sweat, not quite cold, but not typically warm, only half remembering the strange dream that filled his head before his eyes opened. He sat up in bed and begin to sort reality from remnants of deep sleep. Rubbing his eyes, he felt the moisture of new wakefulness on his knuckles. What was real and what was not, he groggily thought. Was there a genuine insight, born in his subconscious mind, knocking softly on the door of his brain? But after turning on the night light near the bed, the other world, comprised of familiar and unfamiliar images, faded completely, like thick fog finally and slowly lifting. The absurdities of the night were being replaced by the realities of the day, as dawn and the sounds of dawn inevitably broke through; he wondered about the possible connections; the material world versus immaterial logic, and if there was something to be gleaned from the meeting of the two. 

THE man of life upright, 
   Whose guiltless heart is free 
From all dishonest deeds, 
   Or thought of vanity; 

The man whose silent days 
   In harmless joys are spent, 
Whom hopes cannot delude, 
   Nor sorrow discontent; 

That man needs neither towers 
   Nor armour for defence, 
Nor secret vaults to fly 
   From thunder's violence: 

He only can behold 
   With unaffrighted eyes 
The horrors of the deep 
   And terrors of the skies. 

Thus, scorning all the cares 
   That fate or fortune brings, 
He makes the heaven his book, 
   His wisdom heavenly things; 

Good thoughts his only friends, 
   His wealth a well-spent age, 
The earth his sober inn 
   And quiet pilgrimage. 

Immortal life is something to be earned,
By slow, self-conquest, comradeship with pain,
And patient seeking after higher truths.
We cannot follow our own wayward wills
And feed our baser appetites and give
Loose reins to foolish tempers, year on year,
And straightway bathe in glory. Men must learn
The spark divine dwells in each soul, and we
Can fan it to a steady flame of light,
Whose lustre guilds the pathway of the tomb
And shines on through eternity, or else
Neglect it till it simmers down to death
And leaves us but the darkness of the grave.
Each conquered passion feeds the living flame;
Faith cannot rescue, and no blood redeem
The soul that will not reason and resolve.
Lean on thyself, yet prop thyself with prayer,
For these are spirits, messengers of light,
Who come at call and fortify thy strength,
Make friends with thee and with thine inner self,
Cast out all envy, bitterness, and hate.
And keep the mind's fair tabernacle pure;
Shake hands with Pain, give greeting unto Grief,
Those angels in disguise and thy glad soul,
From light to light from star to shining star,
Shall climb and claim blest immortality.

'Hearty welcomes we exclaims
Heart full of joy we expresses
In fact heart and emotions different
Imperceptible always, it seems.

Emotions, coming from the perceptions
The perceptual capability of mind
The human mind with intelligence
That matters the joy, sorrow so seems.

Human intellect, the mind, supreme
A perfectible life he always seeks
Here the body mind intellect that matters
peremptorily thoughts that makes results. 

Is it so hard for men to stand by themselves,
Clearly it is hard. But these ought to be leaders . . .
Sheep leading sheep, 'The fold, the fold.
Night comes, and the wolves of doubt.' Clearly it is hard.

Yourself, if you had not encountered and loved
Who is very beautiful and too secure to want worshippers,
And includes indeed the sheep with the wolves,
You too might have been looking about for a church.

He includes the flaming stars and pitiable flesh,
And what we call things and what we call nothing.
He is very beautiful. But when these lonely have travelled
Through long thoughts to redeeming despair,
They are tired and cover their eyes; they flock into fold. 

Idiots abound
Wall street, world
And Mad town

As was foretold
Just like the
Days of Old

I've always been intrigued
by how babies think! 
is the gibberish they speak
actually a language so complex
that no one is capable of learning
it, let alone document it? 
but, give them a few moments
with someone
taking care of them
and they will attempt
to speak it! 

Do they have
some sort of control
over our minds? 
because little as they are
they possess some power
over us all! 
and with a single call
make us all rush
and run up and down
like slaves
to their service
and just to try to figure out
what exactly they need! 

In anycase these observations
may not be  true
but, its interesting to watch
what babies do

Synopsis


This poem traces the evolution from primaeval soup to today through underscoring the world before words and tracing the development of Evolution basic chains 
'rose from a twisting band' to the amoeba 
'Inside was outside, outside in' to mankind
'from cause/effect to Man erect'
and beyond
'but Man's a phase, an empty phrase
on evolution's way.'
and presents an evolutionary case despite the opinions of the recently defeated Kansas Board of Education anti Darwinian legislation
'despite strange Kansas preach.'

Thus 'From ape to man mutating plan
expanded over time, 
no date began, none ends the span
as human pantomime
is but a stage '

and 'Who query climb from seabed slime
to homo sapiens? ' 
.  

the poem reiterates the belief
'time through endless time
plays out planned requiems'The people who consider that they are intelligent
.  

will not make their living home adjacent to the place
where the whore women who exuberantly beautify themselves live; 

Even if you have the entire right for that place so clearly, 
.  

It is undesirable; because your wife's desires
may become something different in due course

While speaking in the assembly of learned persons, 
.  

intelligent people will not speak very fast, 

they will not speak more and more many times, 
.  

they will not speak wrongful messages extensively, 

they will not speak elaborately, 
but they speak in short sentences 

containing what all wanted to say, 
organizing everything concisely 

depending on the situation knowing 
the mentality and timing of the listeners

Intense cold makes water ice.
Then the hard ice turns to slush
and back to water, so there are three
forms of consciousness: the individual,
of True Awareness melt to one flowing:

Lalla is that.

In meditation, I entered the love furnace,
burned impurities away, and as the sun
of a new knowing rose, I realized
point to this peacefulness. 

The consciousness which enjoys 
the sense of divine presence
in a mystical experience, 
now suffers under an equally intense 
sense of  divine absence.
The senses are cleansed and humbled
and the energies and interests of the self
are concentrated upon transcendental things. 

I think I will learn some beautiful language, useless for commercial
Purposes, work hard at that.
I think I will learn the Latin name of every songbird, not only in
America but wherever they sing.
(Shun meditation, though; invite the controversial:
Is the world flat? Do bats eat cats?) By digging hard I might
deflect that river, my mind, that uncontrollable thing,
Turgid and yellow, srong to overflow its banks in spring, 
carrying away bridges
A bed of pebbles now, through which there trickles one clear
narrow stream, following a course henceforth nefast—

Dig, dig; and if I come to ledges, blast. 

Recognize the ritual
In everything we do
Mindless habitual
Becomes something new

An intentional thought
Is what I really sought
Instead I heard 
Some empty words
That take their shape 
From a distant mindscape

From faltering first step
To the last gasp stagger
How long we’ve slept
To avoid destiny’s dagger

I hone intuition
And goad suspicion
With meditative abstraction
A seductive attraction

Easily misread
Intentionally misled
Psychic vibes inside my head
Wisdom’s pathway I’ll gladly tread

Go remote
Actively engage
Does one emote
Or become enraged

Recognize the ritual
In everything we do
Mindless habitual
Becomes something new

Simple fixation
Complex obsession
Extraordinary sensation
This life’s confession

Reframe human faults
With positive focus upon intentional thoughts


INTENTIONS IN PRAYER

Oh Divine Master we come to thee

In absolute surrender of each own plea

May You grant our innermost intentions

As we humbly express all our petitions

And submit every wish that each one yearn

Which rely on Your will we cannot complain.




From all sorts of catstrophe that rush

As well for all the people in this world


Please include each one's whole family

So that humanity will always be happy.



For the leaders of all the countries

May they join in creating a fortress

For the humanitarian mutual accord

So that lasting peace will hold a cord

To recreate this planet a paradise

Which had been at the start without lies. 

While we view this
This is amazing universe
We talk each other more
About this Earth we think
We try to link with secrets
But we do not get way to do
When light sparks in lap
Of cloud we feel this new, 
The vision of theme is nice
The secrets of creations are
Not so far from us we see
We realize this and that too
While we wander in open mind
We feel and stand with courage
The movement of life we see
In each street we realize
The new essence speaks here
To withstand with movement
To get liberation from sorrow 
And pain does not touch us

The room is full of you!—As I came in
And closed the door behind me, all at once
A something in the air, intangible,
Yet stiff with meaning, struck my senses sick!—

Sharp, unfamiliar odors have destroyed
Each other room's dear personality.
The heavy scent of damp, funereal flowers,—
The very essence, hush-distilled, of Death—
Has strangled that habitual breath of home
Whose expiration leaves all houses dead;
And wheresoe'er I look is hideous change.
Save here. Here 'twas as if a weed-choked gate
Had opened at my touch, and I had stepped
Into some long-forgot, enchanted, strange,
Sweet garden of a thousand years ago
And suddenly thought, "I have been here before!"

You are not here. I know that you are gone,
And will not ever enter here again.
And yet it seems to me, if I should speak,
Your silent step must wake across the hall;
If I should turn my head, that your sweet eyes
Would kiss me from the door.—So short a time
To teach my life its transposition to
This difficult and unaccustomed key!—
The room is as you left it; your last touch—
A thoughtless pressure, knowing not itself
As saintly—hallows now each simple thing;
Hallows and glorifies, and glows between
The dust's grey fingers like a shielded light.

There is your book, just as you laid it down,
Face to the table,—I cannot believe
That you are gone!—Just then it seemed to me
You must be here. I almost laughed to think
How like reality the dream had been;
Yet knew before I laughed, and so was still.
That book, outspread, just as you laid it down!
Perhaps you thought, "I wonder what comes next,
And whether this or this will be the end";
So rose, and left it, thinking to return.

Perhaps that chair, when you arose and passed
Out of the room, rocked silently a while
Ere it again was still. When you were gone
Forever from the room, perhaps that chair,
Stirred by your movement, rocked a little while,
Silently, to and fro. 

And here are the last words your fingers wrote,
Scrawled in broad characters across a page
In this brown book I gave you. Here your hand,
Guiding your rapid pen, moved up and down.
Here with a looping knot you crossed a "t,"
And here another like it, just beyond
These two eccentric "e's

" You were so small,
And wrote so brave a hand!
                      How strange it seems
That of all words these are the words you chose!
And yet a simple choice; you did not know
You would not write again. If you had known—
But then, it does not matter,—and indeed
If you had known there was so little time
You would have dropped your pen and come to me
And this page would be empty, and some phrase
Other than this would hold my wonder now.
Yet, since you could not know, and it befell
That these are the last words your fingers wrote,
There is a dignity some might not see
In this, "I picked the first sweet-pea to-day

"
To-day! Was there an opening bud beside it
You left until to-morrow?—O my love,
The things that withered,—and you came not back
That day you filled this circle of my arms
That now is empty. (O my empty life!)
That day—that day you picked the first sweet-pea,—
And brought it in to show me! I recall
With terrible distinctness how the smell
Of your cool gardens drifted in with you.
I know, you held it up for me to see
And flushed because I looked not at the flower,
But at your face; and when behind my look
You saw such unmistakable intent
You laughed and brushed your flower against my lips.
I think.) And then your hands above my heart
Drew down its stem into a fastening,
And while your head was bent I kissed your hair.
I wonder if you knew. (Beloved hands!
Somehow I cannot seem to see them still.
Somehow I cannot seem to see the dust
In your bright hair.) What is the need of Heaven
Had let us love,—and show the world the way!
Strange cancellings must ink th' eternal books
When love-crossed-out will bring the answer right!
That first sweet-pea! I wonder where it is.
It seems to me I laid it down somewhere,
And yet,—I am not sure. I am not sure,
Even, if it was white or pink; for then
'Twas much like any other flower to me
Save that it was the first. I did not know
Then, that it was the last. If I had known—
But then, it does not matter. Strange how few,
After all's said and done, the things that are
Of moment.
     Few indeed! When I can make
Of ten small words a rope to hang the world!
"I had you and I have you now no more

"
There, there it dangles,—where's the little truth
That can for long keep footing under that
When its slack syllables tighten to a thought?
Here, let me write it down! I wish to see
Just how a thing like that will look on paper!

"I had you and I have you now no more


O little words, how can you run so straight
Across the page, beneath the weight you bear?
How can you fall apart, whom such a theme
Has bound together, and hereafter aid
In trivial expression, that have been
That tearing you apart would tear the thread
Stretches asunder on this merciless rack
Of imagery! O, let me sleep a while!
Would I could sleep, and wake to find me back
In that sweet summer afternoon with you.
Summer? Tis summer still by the calendar!
Set back the world a little turn or two!
Correct its griefs, and bring its joys again!

We were so wholly one I had not thought
That we could die apart. I had not thought
That I could move,—and you be stiff and still!
That I could speak,—and you perforce be dumb!
I think our heart-strings were, like warp and woof
In some firm fabric, woven in and out;
Your golden filaments in fair design
Across my duller fibre. And to-day
The shining strip is rent; the exquisite
Fine pattern is destroyed; part of your heart
Aches in my breast; part of my heart lies chilled
In the damp earth with you. I have been tom
In two, and suffer for the rest of me.
What is my life to me? And what am I
To life,—a ship whose star has guttered out?
A Fear that in the deep night starts awake
Perpetually, to find its senses strained
Against the taut strings of the quivering air,
Awaiting the return of some dread chord?

Dark, Dark, is all I find for metaphor;
All else were contrast,—save that contrast's wall
Is down, and all opposed things flow together
Into a vast monotony, where night
And day, and frost and thaw, and death and life,
Are synonyms. What now—what now to me
Are all the jabbering birds and foolish flowers
That clutter up the world? You were my song!
Now, let discord scream! You were my flower!
Now let the world grow weeds! For I shall not
Plant things above your grave—(the common balm
Of the conventional woe for its own wound!)
Amid sensations rendered negative
By your elimination stands to-day,
Certain, unmixed, the element of grief;
I sorrow; and I shall not mock my truth
With travesties of suffering, nor seek
To effigy its incorporeal bulk
In little wry-faced images of woe.

I cannot call you back; and I desire
No utterance of my immaterial voice.
I cannot even turn my face this way
Or that, and say, "My face is turned to you";
I know not where you are, I do not know
If Heaven hold you or if earth transmute,
Body and soul, you into earth again;
But this I know:—not for one second's space
Shall I insult my sight with visionings
Such as the credulous crowd so eager-eyed
Beholds, self-conjured, in the empty air.
Let the world wail! Let drip its easy tears!
My sorrow shall be dumb!

—What do I say?
That I should spit upon a rosary?
I too might feel that frenzied faith whose touch
Makes temporal the most enduring grief;
Though it must walk a while, as is its wont,
With wild lamenting! Would I too might weep
Where weeps the world and hangs its piteous wreaths
For its new dead! Not Truth, but Faith, it is
That keeps the world alive. If all at once
Faith were to slacken,—that unconscious faith
Which must, I know, yet be the corner-stone
Of all believing,—birds now flying fearless
Across would drop in terror to the earth;
Fishes would drown; and the all-governing reins
And the worlds gallop headlong to destruction!

Staggers and swoons! How often over me
Flashes this breathlessness of sudden sight
In which I see the universe unrolled
Before me like a scroll and read thereon
Chaos and Doom, where helpless planets whirl
Dizzily round and round and round and round,
Like tops across a table, gathering speed
With every spin, to waver on the edge
One instant—looking over—and the next
To shudder and lurch forward out of sight—

     *    *    *    *    *    *    *

Ah, I am worn out—I am wearied out—
It is too much—I am but flesh and blood,
And I must sleep. Though you were dead again,
I am but flesh and blood and I must sleep. 

It sheds a shy solemnity,
This lamp in our poor room.
O grey and gold amenity, --
Silence and gentle gloom!

Wide from the world, a stolen hour
We claim, and none may know
How love blooms like a tardy flower
Here in the day's after-glow.

And even should the world break in
With jealous threat and guile,
The world, at last, must bow and win
Our pity and a smile. 

The gaunt brown walls
Look infinite in their decent meanness.
There is nothing of home in the noisy kettle,
The fulsome fire.

The atmosphere
Suggests the trail of a ghostly druggist.
Dressings and lint on the long, lean table -
Whom are they for?

The patients yawn,
Or lie as in training for shroud and coffin.
A nurse in the corridor scolds and wrangles.
It's grim and strange.

Far footfalls clank.
The bad burn waits with his head unbandaged.
My neighbour chokes in the clutch of chloral . . .
O, a gruesome world

Pictures forming in interior albums, 
held closely to hearts of blue sadness, 
wanting only to carry on after loved ones die
and never have to face another day without them. 

Echoes of lasting spirits filling 
the atmosphere with their eerie 
tones, beckoning to an interior 
ancestry.

Recalling the eagles soaring above 
in the blue sky. 

Turning and twisting, lights swirling in patterns of rhythms 
as they entice music to continue changing through designs of 
melodies.

Always challenging and daring an interior appetite to be met 
and sated, situated within a spacious and total effervescent
moment of anticipation about to become a reality.

Coasting down the hills of an interior spirituality that      
keeps us moving along inner pathways, leading wholly into
another universe. 

Finding a place inside, keeping it and enjoying the spacious freedom - an everlasting way to express myself.
An independence wholly appreciated - being who I am is a letting go of self.
He brings another person into my life who needs to change their attitudes and come back to Him. 

You don't survive in me
because of memories;
nor are you mine because
of a lovely longing's strength.

What does make you present
is the ardent detour
that a slow tenderness
traces in my blood.

I do not need
to see you appear;
being born sufficed for me
to lose you a little less.

When I have baked white cakes 
And grated green almonds to spread on them; 
When I have picked the green crowns from the strawberries 
And piled them, cone-pointed, in a blue and yellow platter; 
When I have smoothed the seam of the linen I have been working; 
What then? 
To-morrow it will be the same: 
Cakes and strawberries, 
And needles in and out of cloth 
If the sun is beautiful on bricks and pewter, 
How much more beautiful is the moon, 
Slanting down the gauffered branches of a plum-tree; 
The moon 
Wavering across a bed of tulips; 
The moon, 
Still, 
Upon your face. 
You shine, Beloved, 
You and the moon. 
But which is the reflection? 
The clock is striking eleven. 
I think, when we have shut and barred the door, 
The night will be dark 
Outside. 

This deep internal rage burns through my veins.
my internal torture eats me alive.
these thoughts put me in an instant haze of pain.
my dignity has been murdered in an on-slaught war.

these tears plummet down my face with the sting of toxic waste.
my blood-shot eyes give me a new look to my already too-ugly face making it more painful to look at my reflection.
these sensations of death they take over and gain control.
i try to fight back these feelings but just end up deeper in the abyss inside.

with my adreniline rush, heart speeding, hate rage, haze, and acid tears im slowly dieing, dieing a painful death.

the heavenly screamo music flooding my ears put me in some transe of this unfamiliar feeling.  
love? 
hope? 
joy? 
no.
happiness? ? 
happiness
happiness, a VERY unfamiliar feeling; a stranger.

What if tomorrow was the end of me, was the end you
What if tomorrow wasn’t pretend, what if it all came to an end 
What would say? What would you do? 
Would you love me then? Or would you still hate me? 
Would you apologize? Would you rectify? 
Would you still laugh? Or would you weep and cry? 
For if tomorrow was the end, we would all die-

But then what- 
Ashes to Ashes, 
Dust to Dust, 
Cradle to Grave,

Womb to Tomb
We’ve already lost
We’re already dead
Live to Die 
Die to-They leave their homes 
Unwillingly forced 
And follow their fate 
Through fields and trails 
Massifs and woods 
With all their goods  
Love and hate 
Mores and tales 
All in bales 
Carrying their own 
Flesh and bones 
Feet like stones 
Their bodies and souls 
Kids and crones 
Torn by storms, 
Rains and gales 
Attacked by guns, 
Helis and drones 
No role to play 
In games of peace 
And deadly war 
Not a word they say 
But a question, 
Why? What for? 
While we yawn
Sitting at ease
In our climes 
They leave their homes 
And reside in camps 
Strive for a living 
Internally displaced and dead 
Beg for a dropp of water 
And a piece of bread! 

(May            

(*) Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) is a neoteric terminology used in reference to those people who adopt refuge in their own countries due to any life threatening disturbance like fight between the extremists and security agencies or fight between the local millitant groups that results in catastrophic changes in their lives and they leave their homes due to anarchy in their respective area. (NAN)May all families feel happy

Salutations to the day for March  

Proud to be born as a women
The future of world is in your mind
Through the hard work and motivation
The progress of new new generation 
In your own effort we are achieving
The great motherhood, the teachers
The scientists, parliamentarians
A great success story there lies
Oh! women my mother, sister, 
Where through I born and bought up
I bow my head in this day 
Before the sacred women of this large world
No matter where you live with
No matter what you speak in mother language
No matter how you like the journey of life
Surely you are the destiny makers of world. 

I celebrate International Women's Day, not because there is some inherent necessity to elevate the concept of womanhood, for women are a creation of the same Mind and Hands that cast all the wonders of the universe across the sea of nothingness, as perfect in their conception and teleologically complete in their existence as anything in the manifestation of all creation.

I celebrate International Women's Day in the same way that I celebrate all of the beautiful wonders and amazing marvels displayed in the panoply of this existence, surely distinct each in its own right, but by no means separate or divorced from the whole─by no means an entity that requires the effort of anyone to enhance the glory of its own essential qualities.

I celebrate the strength of womanhood, not as a distinction from humanity, but as another refraction of that same notable quality variably inherent to all of humanity, a manifestation of power and depth displayed across a spectrum of expression, equal, but wonderfully not identical.

I celebrate the women in my life like my mother, who painted a flesh and blood portrait of resilience, strength, perseverance, and creativity that was essential to the crucible of who I would be in this world, and what I could achieve.

I celebrate the beauty of my wife, not merely that overwhelmingly appealing physical attractiveness that took my breath away and imprisoned all other thoughts of a life without her, but the beauty of her grace toward me through all these years, the powerful beauty of her vision of the potential that was locked inside me and the patience to unleash it. The beauty of her compassion to those who are so often discarded by a world that values lesser qualities than the soul of a human being.

I celebrate the passion of my girls, who are not afraid of the future, and who burn with a raging (Alex)  and stoically quiet (Caera)  zeal to seize the future and make it a better place.


I celebrate International Women's Day because, unfortunately, there are so many whose eyes have not been opened to the reality that womanhood is a concept complete in its perfection, consummate in its execution, and wholly unnecessary of improvement or confinement.

I celebrate the beauty and dignity and strength of the marvelous creation of women, unique in all the universe, and as worthy of wonder and admiration as any other marvelous feature of existence. 

Hey, you! 
Are you
Who you
Say you
Are? 

My browser
Tells me one thing, 
You say another, 
Always shifting, 
Changing.

Names, 
Places, 
Ages, 
Genders, 
Changing faster
Than an NYC
Stop light. 

I don't know you, 
I never will, 
But can I trust you? 
You, who are
Who you think I
Want you to be? 
I think 
You can be trusted, 
Trusted with the secret
Of your identity. 

It's a risk, I know, 
Talking to you, 
But there's a certain thrill
In taking a risk.
So, we chat, 
=) 
 ;) 
=P . 

You, 
Faceless, 
Nameless, 
-though your screenname is cool-
Can listen
To my life secrets, 
Because you will never know 
Me.

Internet acquaitance, 
I know your secret-
You are the ghosts 
Of my past, 
And the spectres
Of my future.
You are not real, 
But I am, 
So good-bye, 
Internet acquaintance.
Reality calls me. 

*ctpoet has logged off*Somewhere within your loving look I sense,
Without the least intention to deceive,
Without suspicion, without evidence,
Somewhere within your heart the heart to leave. 

Because I will sometimes not say what I'm thinking
my resulting silence, apparently, declares more than
I realize- all of which, she is quickly able to gather.
The woman speaks a frighteningly fluent
Wordlessness. 

We interrupt the work of the gods,
hasty and inexperienced beings of the moment.
In the palaces of Eleusis and Phthia
Demeter and Thetis start good works
amid high flames and dense smoke. But
always Metaneira rushes from the king's
chambers, disheveled and scared,
and always Peleus is fearful and interferes. 

Gone the wild day:
A wilder night
Coming makes way
For brief twilight.

Where the firm soaked road
Mounts and is lost
In the high beech-wood
It shines almost.

The beeches keep
A stormy rest,
Breathing deep
Of wind from the west.

The wood is black,
With a misty steam.
Above, the cloud pack
Breaks for one gleam.

But the woodman's cot
By the ivied trees
Awakens not
To light or breeze.

It smokes aloft
Unwavering:
It hunches soft
Under storm's wing.

It has no care
For gleam or gloom:
It stays there
While I shall roam,

Die, and forget
The hill of trees,
The gleam, the wet,
This roaring peace. 

We were happy all that morning
First the stones the leaves and the flowers shone
and then the sun
a huge sun all thorns but so very high in the heavens.
Α Nymph was gathering our cares and hanging them on the trees
a forest of Judas trees.
Cupids and satyrs were singing and playing
and rosy limbs could be glimpsed amid black laurel
the flesh of young children.
We were happy all that morning; 
the abyss was a closed well
ο n which the tender foot of a young faun stamped
do γ ο υ remember its laughter: how happy we were! 
And then clouds rain and the damp earth; 
you stopped laughing when you reclined in the hut, 
and opened your large eyes and gazed
on the archangel wielding a fiery sword
 
'Ι cannot explain it, ' you said, 'Ι cannot explain it, '
Ι find people impossible to understand
however much they may play with colors
they are all black. 



Curse will fall upon 
Thunderstorm will lash everywhere
When nature is destroyed
By man made unwanted interventions
Sea erosion, earth slips, and all
Save nature, and this wonderful earth
For our own sake, and for future
Life it is temporary, also permanent
With continuity it continues ever
It should continue for ever
For our own sake, nature be protected. 

The mother was crying there
The little one stood near
The reason of her emotional outburst
Someone asked what happened dear
I am totally dejected today
My little one failed in the interview
The meaning is he can't get an admissions
That too in his first kindergarten year
The school which is prestigious to all
But my little one who is home grown
Well tutored failed in the interview.
The interviews a continuous process of life
That is reckoned the success and failures
The ways are so many and pits so many
The helpless mother's dismay opens the eye. 

After spending about eternity over here
I began to wonder, 
whether I will fit in the outside world? 

Over here at the price of my freedom, 
I get an assurance
that tomorrow will be no different than today! 

Outside is full of opportunities they say, 
They say there are possibilities
I wonder what if they are wrong? 

What if all I have today is
all that it can ever be? 
What if outside is no different than my world? 

All this during the first interstellar journey. 


I will tell you the dreams of my life 
On this deepest of blue nights. 
In your hands my soul will tremble, 
On your shoulders my cross will rest. 

The summits of life are lonely, 
So lonely and so cold! I locked 
My yearnings inside, and all reside 
In the ivory tower I raised. 

Today I will reveal a great mystery; 
Your soul has the power to penetrate me. 
In silence are vertigos of the abyss: 
I hesitate, I am sustained in you. 

I die of dreams; I will drink truth, 
Pure and cool, from your springs. 
I know in the well of your breast 
Is a fountain that vanquishes my thirst. 

And I know that in our lives, this 
Is the inexpressible miracle of reflection- 
In the silence, my soul arrives at yours 
As to a magnificent mirror. 

Imagine the love I dreamed 
In the glacial tomb of silence! 
Larger than life, larger than dream, 
A love imprisoned beneath an azure without end. 

Imagine my love, love which desires 
Impossible life, superhuman life, 
You who know how it burdens and consumes, 
Dreams of Olympus bound by human flesh. 

And when met with a soul which found 
A bit of azure to bathe its wings, 
Like a great, golden sun, or a shore 
Made of light, your soul opened: 

Imagine! To embrace the Impossible! 
Radiant! The lived illusion! 
And all of life, because you are life! 

If I bought this happiness with my anguish, 
Bless the weeping that stains my eyes! 
All the ulcers of the past laugh 
At the sun rising from red lips! 

Ah you will know, My Love, 
We will travel far across the flowery night; 
There what is human frightens, there you can hear it, 
See it, feel it, life without end. 

We go further into night, we go 
Where in me not an echo reverberates, 
Like a nocturnal flower in the shade, 
I will open sweetly for you. 

The soul is a presence of the divine world.
It cannot invent itself.
The soul holds the echo of primal intimacy.
This original echo whispers with every heart.
Intimacy has no limit in the soul.



It is marvellous to wake up together
At the same minute; marvellous to hear
The rain begin suddenly all over the roof,
To feel the air suddenly clear
As if electricity had passed through it
From a black mesh of wires in the sky.
All over the roof the rain hisses,
And below, the light falling of kisses.

An electrical storm is coming or moving away;
It is the prickling air that wakes us up.
If lighting struck the house now, it would run
From the four blue china balls on top
Down the roof and down the rods all around us, 
And we imagine dreamily
How the whole house caught in a bird-cage of lightning
Would be quite delightful rather than frightening;

And from the same simplified point of view
Of night and lying flat on one's back
All things might change equally easily,
Since always to warn us there must be these black
Electrical wires dangling. Without surprise
The world might change to something quite different,
As the air changes or the lightning comes without our blinking,
Change as our kisses are changing without our thinking. 

Don't you care for my love? she said bitterly.

I handed her the mirror, and said:
Please address these questions to the proper person!
Please make all requests to head-quarters!
In all matters of emotional importance
please approach the supreme authority direct! - 

So I handed her the mirror.
And she would have broken it over my head,
but she caught sight of her own reflection
and that held her spellbound for two seconds
while I fled. 

Getting shrunk like a shrinking violet
Too stiffened by a fearful Self
Lost opportunities she cannot get
She is one dusty jar on a shelf.

Secure in that musty four walls
Of her cabinet shelf she finds comfort
Unable to find her life purpose at all
Stifled her chances by low self-worth.

Intimidation is what keeps her fenced
Tapes her mouth shut she cannot speak
Deafens her ears,  her mind is silenced
Success is something that she fails to seek. 

Into another day
A night of wonder
A day of disillusion.
Snowbound, a mountain of sight.
A river of love.
This ride to the very end.
Into the darkness I've known.
The light blinds this man.
A dream, a voice beckoning him on.
Should he follow light or dark? 
A question of being.
Into this unknown but the light still shines on. . 

Cont. 

Our hearts bled
in rambling over temptation's thorns, 
in sopping into currents of longings absonant
into seductive, enchanting colours and fragrance.
Inebriated, we find it hard to take up into another path.

Winter
throws his great white shield
on the ground,
breaking thin arms of twisting branches,
and then howls
on the north side of the Black Mesa
a deep, throaty laughter.
Because of him
we have to sell our cattle
that rake snow for stubble.
Having lived his whole life
in a few weeks,
slow and pensive he walks away,
dragging his silver-stream shield
down branches
and over the ground,
he keeps walking slowly away
into death
bravely.

Into her lying down head
His enemies entered bed,
Under the encumbered eyelid,
Through the rippled drum of the hair-buried ear;
And Noah's rekindled now unkind dove
Flew man-bearing there.
Last night in a raping wave
Whales unreined from the green grave
In fountains of origin gave up their love,
Along her innocence glided
Jaun aflame and savagely young King Lear,
And Samson drowned in his hair,
The colossal intimacies of silent
Once seen strangers or shades on a stair;
There the dark blade and wanton sighing her down
To a haycock couch and the scythes of his arms
Rode and whistled a hundred times
Before the crowing morning climbed;
Man was the burning England she was sleep-walking, and the enamouring island
Made her limbs blind by luminous charms,
Sleep to a newborn sleep in a swaddling loin-leaf stroked and sang
And his runaway beloved childlike laid in the acorned sand.


II

There where a numberless tongue
Wound their room with a male moan,
His faith around her flew undone
And darkness hung the walls with baskets of snakes,
A furnace-nostrilled column-membered
Super-or-near man
Resembling to her dulled sense
The thief of adolescence,
Early imaginary half remembered
Oceanic lover alone
Jealousy cannot forget for all her sakes,
Made his bad bed in her good
Night, and enjoyed as he would.
Crying, white gowned, from the middle moonlit stages
Out to the tiered and hearing tide,
Close and far she announced the theft of the heart
In the taken body at many ages,
Trespasser and broken bride
Celebrating at her side
All blood-signed assailing and vanished marriages in which he had no lovely part
Nor could share, for his pride, to the least
Mutter and foul wingbeat of the solemnizing nightpriest
Her holy unholy hours with the always anonymous beast.


III

Two sand grains together in bed,
Head to heaven-circling head,
Singly lie with the whole wide shore,
The covering sea their nightfall with no names;
And out of every domed and soil-based shell
One voice in chains declaims
The female, deadly, and male
Libidinous betrayal,
Golden dissolving under the water veil.
A she bird sleeping brittle by
Her lover's wings that fold to-morrow's flight,
Within the nested treefork
Sings to the treading hawk
Carrion, paradise, chirrup my bright yolk.
A blade of grass longs with the meadow,
A stone lies lost and locked in the lark-high hill.
Open as to the air to the naked shadow
O she lies alone and still,
Innocent between two wars,
With the incestuous secret brother in the seconds to perpetuate the stars,
A man torn up mourns in the sole night.
And the second comers, the severers, the enemies from the deep
Forgotten dark, rest their pulse and bury their dead in her faithless sleep. 

into homelessness


today suddenly I woke up from deadness
I was dead peacefully
All a beautiful death

My home -your home could only be this beautiful earth-
So I presumed I also reign high on this beautiful earth like you

When you leave to live 
from one country to another country
You say 
one home to another home

I thence also drew a border in my mind
When people say you are homeless and
I am into homelessness-into bigger home called the BIG EARTH.
And my heart turning in that pulse into another heart so BIG

I shrunk out from into these  unlimitedness
From the world of my deadness to my aliveness

Again I shall be playing a game of 
deadness and aliveness
Aliveness and deadness

So I am alive today
What do I want to know
Surrounded by the sounds of Silence and solitude-
These walls are all I feel protected-these walls

A way my life designed and desired
The world can pierce through these silences-these walls
And reach me- so far the world in the form of Television 
I also depend on the Television to know everything
Shot by shot 
Scene by scene
Frame by frame
Channels upon channels 
Breaking news is my breakfast now

Still the game of yours and mine 
Mine and yours was live in the air

Asking his mother
Where on earth is my home

Mother replies-
the mother earth and your heart

i loved this part of the world
For they found this beautiful earth
For they found love-
smiling silently for they have crossed the border
no question no answer

I picked the eraser 
and erased all from my mind the thickening border 

Another they called me refugee
I was happy I am homeless
I was happy I am a refugee 
I also found love in this lost

I was standing like a patriot in a nameless country
Holding the globe in my hand

NEWS of bloodshed reddened the screen of the Television
Load shedding
Suddenly the Tele. vision lay numb 
The whole world shrunk into zero


Into my heart an air that kills 
From yon far country blows: 
What are those blue remembered hills, 
What spires, what farms are those? 

That is the land of lost content, 
I see it shining plain, 
The happy highways where I went 
And cannot come again. 

One of my wishes is that those dark trees,
So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,
Were not, as 'twere, the merest mask of gloom,
But stretched away unto the edge of doom.

I should not be withheld but that some day
into their vastness I should steal away,
Fearless of ever finding open land,
or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand.

I do not see why I should e'er turn back,
Or those should not set forth upon my track
To overtake me, who should miss me here
And long to know if still I held them dear.

They would not find me changed from him they knew--
Only more sure of all I though was true. 

oneness

-I crept into the enormity of oneness
into sole oneness. 
From the narrow lanes of garden we walked-to the lost lanes

 Innermost to outermost
Outermost to innermost

Moments paused
Ceased to exist is only the beingness

The act must go on

-still basking in the eternal flame of fire

the icy cold droplets of water and wind- that drips dropp by dropp from within eachother-
peeping out through the pores of the rocks of the standstill cave

Yes! ! ! 

Of  Oneness-

Oneness celebrated
Love itself is in love
With the metallic music of the singing cricket ringing through our ears
singing their own songs from beneath the rustling leaves 
that creeps out of the deep dancing forest-
.  

and through the roots we were woken to walk more
.  

to and fro.  

to and fro

Yes! ! ! 
Music throughout-all over 

Silence into silence-
oneness into oneness

.  

And we sang along - in silence amidst-I went on a three-week camping tour, with Con-tiki, 
starting from London, then around central Europe, 
many years ago; we were mostly New Zealanders, Australians, 
and Canadians, keen to see mainly France, Italy, Germany
and Holland. Dave drove the tour bus down from Le Havre, 
through Rouen, to Paris, which we reached in early evening, 
when the lights were coming on everywhere in the streets, 
giving the city a magical atmosphere for my first sighting.
We soon put up the tents and some went out to a night-club.

The young tour manager made sure we saw all the main attractions, 
like the Louvre, Notre-Dame, the Centre Pompidou and others.
I took photographs and slides of the whole trip, but there are
only two slides taken in Paris: in one I am standing, smiling
near the Arc de Triomphe, probably thinking of Napoleon Bonaparte, 
France's superman from  who had the Arc built for
his soldiers` many military victories over various coalitions.
In the other, I am with others from the tour, new friends, 
at the foot of the Eiffel Tower where we had just taken the lift 
to the top to get the best, panoramic view of Paris in the spring.


- November, 

Arthritic fingers of the olive trees 
Accuse the sun of ancient injuries. 

The shallows harden to an ochre crust 
While bony cattle huddle in the dust. 

The wretched one who tears his flesh resumes 
His bellowing from somewhere in the tombs. 

The sky assumes a tyrant's glare. Despite 
Our lust for rain, we fear the eerie night. 

Dogs whimper softly. An unearthly dawn 
Ignites some whispers that the dead will yawn. 

We spot a boat; pigs and children squeal. 
We bicker over whether it is real. 

A striking figure stands beside the sail. 
His patchwork crew appears a little pale. 

A crowd surrounds him as he steps ashore 
But no one fears his coming anymore. 

With all the noise, I cannot be exact 
About what happened when the wretch attacked. 

The visitor, from what my friends could tell, 
Dazed his attacker with some kind of spell. 

After berating unseen demons, he 
Commanded them to set their hostage free. 

We trembled as he spoke. He made a sign 
And charged the demons to inhabit swine. 

Immediately nearby pigs began 
To froth and moan; the wretch became a man. 

The pigs escaped; no one could make them stop. 
The swineherds muttered, but then let it drop. 

Far from the Rappahannock, the silent
Danube moves along toward the sea.
The brown and green Nile rolls slowly
Like the Niagara's welling descent.
Tractors stood on the green banks of the Loire
Near where it joined the Cher.
The St. Lawrence prods among black stones
And mud. But the Arno is all stones.
Wind ruffles the Hudson's
Surface. The Irawaddy is overflowing.
But the yellowish, gray Tiber
Is contained within steep banks. The Isar
Flows too fast to swim in, the Jordan's water
Courses over the flat land. The Allegheny and its boats
Were dark blue. The Moskowa is
Gray boats. The Amstel flows slowly.
Leaves fall into the Connecticut as it passes
Underneath. The Liffey is full of sewage,
Like the Seine, but unlike
The brownish-yellow Dordogne.
Mountains hem in the Colorado
And the Oder is very deep, almost
As deep as the Congo is wide.
The plain banks of the Neva are
Gray. The dark Saône flows silently.
And the Volga is long and wide
As it flows across the brownish land. The Ebro
Is blue, and slow. The Shannon flows
Swiftly between its banks. The Mississippi
Is one of the world's longest rivers, like the Amazon.
It has the Missouri for a tributary.
The Harlem flows amid factories
And buildings. The Nelson is in Canada,
Flowing. Through hard banks the Dubawnt
Forces its way. People walk near the Trent.
The landscape around the Mohawk stretches away;
The Rubicon is merely a brook.
In winter the Main
Surges; the Rhine sings its eternal song.
The Rhône slogs along through whitish banks
And the Rio Grande spins tales of the past.
The Loir bursts its frozen shackles
But the Moldau's wet mud ensnares it.
The East catches the light.
Near the Escaut the noise of factories echoes
And the sinuous Humboldt gurgles wildly.
The Po too flows, and the many-colored
Thames. Into the Atlantic Ocean
Pours the Garonne. Few ships navigate
On the Housatonic, but quite a few can be seen
On the Elbe. For centuries
The Afton has flowed.
 If the Rio Negro
Could abandon its song, and the Magdalena
The jungle flowers, the Tagus
Would still flow serenely, and the Ohio
Abrade its slate banks. The tan Euphrates would
Was choked with ice, but the Susquehanna still pushed
Bravely along. The Dee caught the day's last flares
Like the Pilcomayo's carrion rose.
The Peace offered eternal fragrance
Perhaps, but the Mackenzie churned livid mud
Like tan chalk-marks. Near where
The Brahmaputra slapped swollen dikes
And the Pechora? The São Francisco
Skulks amid gray, rubbery nettles. The Liard's
Reflexes are slow, and the Arkansas erodes
Anthracite hummocks. The Paraná stinks.
The Ottawa is light emerald green
Among grays. Better that the Indus fade
In steaming sands! Let the Brazos
Freeze solid! And the Wabash turn to a leaden
Cinder of ice! The Marañon is too tepid, we must
Find a way to freeze it hard. The Ural
Is freezing slowly in the blasts. The black Yonne
Congeals nicely. And the Petit-Morin
Curls up on the solid earth. The Inn
Does not remember better times, and the Merrimack's
Galvanized. The Ganges is liquid snow by now;
The Vyatka's ice-gray. The once-molten Tennessee s
Curdled. The Japurá is a pack of ice. Gelid
The Columbia's gray loam banks. The Don's merely
A giant icicle. The Niger freezes, slowly.
The interminable Lena plods on
But the Purus' mercurial waters are icy, grim
With cold. The Loing is choked with fragments of ice.
The Weser is frozen, like liquid air.
And so is the Kama. And the beige, thickly flowing
Tocantins. The rivers bask in the cold.
The stern Uruguay chafes its banks,
A mass of ice. The Hooghly is solid
Ice. The Adour is silent, motionless.
The lovely Tigris is nothing but scratchy ice
Like the Yellowstone, with its osier-clustered banks.
The Mekong is beginning to thaw out a little
And the Donets gurgles beneath the
Huge blocks of ice. The Manzanares gushes free.
The Illinois darts through the sunny air again.
But the Dnieper is still ice-bound. Somewhere
The Salado propels irs floes, but the Roosevelt's
Frozen. The Oka is frozen solider
Than the Somme. The Minho slumbers
In winter, nor does the Snake
Remember August. Hilarious, the Canadian
Is solid ice. The Madeira slavers
Across the thawing fields, and the Plata laughs.
The Dvina soaks up the snow. The Sava's
Temperature is above freezing. The Avon
Carols noiselessly. The Drôme presses
Grass banks; the Adige's frozen
Surface is like gray pebbles.

Birds circle the Ticino. In winter
The Var was dark blue, unfrozen. The
Thwaite, cold, is choked with sandy ice;
The Ardeche glistens feebly through the freezing rain. 

From the horizon
they flew down, 
the birds of love.

They flew to my heart, 
in the garden of my heart
to settle there to teach me
how to love in this mad world.

Their beauty attracted me.
So I listened to the chattering
of these love birds who were keen
to teach me the joys of love.

in the world of eternal sunshine.

Birds from that world of love
told me: Love and love alone 
can bring you to the world of beauty
from which we flew down to your heart. 

I simply believed it and remain
in meditation, drinking in
the beauty of the world of love. 

The mystical sense 
transcends the emotional, 
intellectual and volitional life 
of ordinary men. 


to enter into the inmost being. 


It is a returning into one’s own self. 

Why do we fight with the light every day
have we no sense, 
why do we say the things that we say
we've sure gone astray. 

Why do we do the things so crude
where did the conscious go
some place we don't know.

Did love disappear
is judge the answer in our corrupted minds
how long we have to go
til we find the flow
of the light again
to complete the mission
 so long forgotten.
 
Let go
of all that bites
and the endless fights
your soul is free
only n the light
that is our right
to make it so
we have to let go
and let the light be the source
of all. 

Please let me slip, 
Into that dreaming nothingness.
The sleepy stars, 
Against the pitch coloured void.

Me in this empty space, 
Desolate with nothing, not even thought nor love.
Let me escape to this place.
Only by falling into the deepest sleep.

This dark night, 
Reflects the dark feelings that enshroud me, 
But as the dawn breaks the cold silence.
I know I also must carry on.

So just for this night, 

Please let me slip, 
Into that dreaming nothingness.
With the sleepy and fading stars, 
Plastered against the tar coloured void.

I see it all: 
The stars, the nothing, me, and everything.
Lost, Alone, Forever at Peace, 
Good-night.  

At times I dream
that I fall and fall, 
into the unending abyss
without finding any place
to stop the fall.

Darkness folds
over me and I fall, 
still deeper into it.

It’s much worst
than parachute jumping
and feeling the material
braking your fall
and to see the earth
rushing to you in a blink.

It’s like a black hole
which opens its mouth
and sucks you in
and swallows you alive
and make you go
to the end of all things. 

Out over childhood's borders,
Manhood's brave banners unfurled,
Weighed down with precepts and orders
A boy has gone into the world.


Nobody thinks it pathetic-
For he is a strong-armed youth.
But where is the vision prophetic
To forecast his future with truth?


No more a child to be petted
And sheltered away from the strife;
Henceforth-a man to be fretted
And worn with the worries of life.


Henceforth a man with others
To scramble and push in the race,
To jostle and crowd with his brothers,
To struggle for gain and place.


Now though his heart is breaking,
Henceforth his lids must be dry;
Now though his soul is aching,
He must not utter a cry.


Now if his brain is troubled,
Now if his courage has gone,
Still must his strength be doubled,
Still must the battle go on.


Now if success shall crown him,
Oh, how the world will cheer.
Now if misfortune shall down him,
Oh, how the scoffer will jeer.


Virtue and truth attend him,
Into the vortex whirled,
A boy has gone into the world. 

Intoxicated by the Wine of Love.
From each a mystic silence Love demands.
What do all seek so earnestly? 'Tis Love.
What do they whisper to each other? Love.
Love is the subject of their inmost thoughts.
In Love no longer 'thou' and 'I' exist,
For Self has passed away in the Beloved.
Now will I draw aside the veil from Love,
And in the temple of mine inmost soul,
Behold the Friend; Incomparable Love.
He who would know the secret of both worlds,
Will find the secret of them both, is Love. 

The veils of clouds 
gave me 
this liberty 
of gazing, 
without  stinting 

At mid-noon sky
daringly, 
into the strangeness 

Of the sun's 
incalculable ray 
in anytime.  
will be darting into 
my confusion

That will make
me forget my
name.  

I donned the boots with shining blades, 
And tottered to the rink, 
And as I stepped onto the ice, 
My heart began to sink.
How was I, to stay vertical, 
On this metal edge so thin, 
I felt my legs were giving way, 
And my head was in a spin.

I staggered forth, intrepid me, 
And toppled straight away.
I tried to rise with dignity, 
But my feet would not obey.
I'll never do a figure eight, 
Or a treble what's its name, 
My only time trying to skate, 
Will have no claim to fame.

How slippery this sport, making
One tremble at the knees.
I was holding on to everything, 
Even my dungarees.
I really needed thick padding, 
On every part of me, 
I've now so many bruises, 
All the colours of a blackberry.

The ladies glided gracefully, 
The men moved with such speed.
I know practise makes perfect, 
And that is all I need.
But it all seemed such an effort
To try and stay upright.
An 'Ice Skater' in the making? 
I really don't think so, quite! 

And thou art the peace of sundown 
When the blue shadows soothe 
And the grasses and the leaves sleep 
To the song of the little brooks 
Woe is me.

Thou art my love, 
And thou art a storm 
That breaks black in the sky 
And, sweeping headlong, 
Drenches and cowers each tree 
And at the panting end 
There is no sound 
Save the melancholy cry of a single owl 
Woe is me!

Thou art my love 
And thou art a tinsel thing 
And I in my play 
Broke thee easily 
And from the little fragments 
Arose my long sorrow 
Woe is me.

Thou art my love 
And thou art a weary violet 
Drooping from sun-caresses. 
Answering mine carelessly 
Woe is me.

Thou art my love 
And thou art the ashes of other men's love 
And I bury my face in these ashes 
And I love them 
Woe is me.

Thou art my love 
And thou art the beard 
On another man's face 
Woe is me.

Thou art my love 
And thou art a temple 
And in this temple is an altar 
And on this altar is my heart 
Woe is me.

Thou art my love 
And thou art a wretch. 
Let these sacred love-lies choke thee 
For I am come to where I know your lies as truth 
And your truth as lies 
Woe is me.

Thou art my love 
And thou art a priestess 
And in thy hand is a bloody dagger 
And my doom comes to me surely 
Woe is me.

Thou art my love 
And thou art a skull with ruby eyes 
And I love thee 
Woe is me.

Thou art my love 
And I doubt thee 
And if peace came with my murder 
Then would I murder 
Woe is me.

Thou art my love 
And thou art death 
Aye, thou art death 
Black and yet black 
But I love thee 
I love thee 
Woe, welcome woe, to me. 

Canvas sails of the windmill, secured to their whips, 
Circle around on slow orbital trips. 
No hurrying to speed the day’s hours away, 
The winds hold them captive, they have to obey.

The blades catch the currents that travel along, 
Turning continuously, powerful and strong. 
Moving the mechanism of sprockets rotating, 
Crushing the corn and then flour creating.

What a joy when you see one, they stand proud and tall. 
A relic of times when the miller would haul 
Jute sacks full of wheat, which he would then kibble, 
In that dusty old place, where the mice came to nibble.

The Smock Mill,  the Post Mill and the Tower Mill well knew, 
The procedure of grinding the grain fine and true. 
But these intriguing creations are now hard to find, 
As the old time traditions are now left far behind. 

Humming of endless mystery
Life glides down noiseless
Like a trail running into the dark
With thick drapes drawn down

What is anticipated, rarely happens
What is dreamed, never even half realized 
What occurs, never in advance  sighted
What is sighted, not fully understood

Struck upon the verge of mysteries
Clueless we stay, placing our hands
On the door latch of mysteries
Which we are never able to open or enter

Life began in hideous mystery 
And it will end up also in mystery
Know that much is beyond our grasp
And not every puzzle is intended to be solved

Is it not foolish to raise a thunder storm 
By beating hard upon a drum? 
So probe less and accept life
That unfurls in its natural sequence

Raindrops fall on the grassland underneath.
I’m self-absorbed by the hunger within me.

Standing barefoot, lurking beyond the heath, 
I’ll wait until the wind carries your scent to me.

But you hide like a fool in a hollow tree
 only to avoid colliding with me.

Because of what I am, you think I’m a beast.
Although your eyes are quick to misjudge me.

Venomous blood in every vein will seethe, 
to prove to you the better side of me.

Your frozen fears burn to find peace, 
though all along, this is what you made of me. 

I have come to thy door 
with the emotion of thy love
now you ask me my introduction

It is like earth
asking the introduction of sky
who has covered it days and night

It is like rain
asking the introduction of cloud
who has kept in his heart

Yet you ask my introduction

You ask my introduction
from the tides of ocean

You ask my introduction
from the gale

You ask my introduction
from the sun and the moon

You ask my introduction from stars
twinkling on sky over night

Does the flower asks the fragrance
what is thy introduction

Do you think me gallio
No.
I am more responsible 
Yes, you can not manure the fragrance
it will spread certainly

You can not see blue sky during night
it has to be invisible
the rain has to be dropped
these are natural phenomenon
But I am not poltroon
nor I am fugitive
You can not pincer me
because I am frenzy

I can not stay more 
at a time.

It does not mean
you will forget  me
and ask my introduction

I am yours, yours and yours only
and none. 

New Year's Day at Asolo in the Trevisan


Scene.-
A large mean airy chamber. A girl, Pippa, from the Silk-mills, springing out of bed
.


Day!
Faster and more fast,
O'er night's brim, day boils at last:
Boils, pure gold, o'er the cloud-cup's brim
Where spurting and suppressed it lay,
For not a froth-flake touched the rim
Of yonder gap in the solid gray
Of the eastern cloud, an hour away;
But forth one wavelet, then another, curled,
Till the whole sunrise, not to be suppressed,
Rose, reddened, and its seething breast
Flickered in bounds, grew gold, then overflowed the world.
Oh, Day, if I squander a wavelet of thee,
A mite of my twelve hours' treasure,
The least of thy gazes or glances,
(Be they grants thou art bound to or gifts above measure)
One of thy choices or one of thy chances,
-My Day, if I squander such labour or leisure,
Then shame fall on Asolo, mischief on me!


Thy long blue solemn hours serenely flowing,
Whence earth, we feel, gets steady help and good-
Thy fitful sunshine-minutes, coming, going,
As if earth turned from work in gamesome mood-
All shall be mine! But thou must treat me not
As prosperous ones are treated, those who live
At hand here, and enjoy the higher lot,
In readiness to take what thou wilt give,
And free to let alone what thou refusest;
For, Day, my holiday, if thou ill-usest
Me, who am only Pippa,-old-year's sorrow,
Cast off last night, will come again to-morrow:
Whereas, if thou prove gentle, I shall borrow
Sufficient strength of thee for new-year's sorrow.
All other men and women that this earth
Belongs to, who all days alike possess,
Make general plenty cure particular dearth,
Get more joy one way, if another, less:
What were all earth else, with a feel of heaven,-
Sole light that helps me through the year, thy sun's!
Try now! Take Asolo's Four Happiest Ones-
And let thy morning rain on that superb
Great haughty Ottima; can rain disturb
Her Sebald's homage? All the while thy rain
Beats fiercest on her shrub-house window-pane,
He will but press the closer, breathe more warm
Against her cheek; how should she mind the storm?
And, morning past, if mid-day shed a gloom
O'er Jules and Phene,-what care bride and groom
Save for their dear selves? 'T is their marriage-day;
And while they leave church and go home their way,
Hand clasping hand, within each breast would be
Sunbeams and pleasant weather spite of thee.
Then, for another trial, obscure thy eve
With mist,-will Luigi and his mother grieve-
The lady and her child, unmatched, forsooth,
She in her age, as Luigi in his youth,
For true content? The cheerful town, warm, close
And safe, the sooner that thou art morose,
Receives them. And yet once again, outbreak
In storm at night on Monsignor, they make
Such stir about,-whom they expect from Rome
To visit Asolo, his brothers' home,
And say here masses proper to release
A soul from pain,-what storm dares hurt his peace?
Calm would he pray, with his own thoughts to ward
Thy thunder off, nor want the angels' guard.
But Pippa-just one such mischance would spoil
Her day that lightens the next twelvemonth's toil
At wearisome silk-winding, coil on coil!


And here I let time slip for nought!
Aha, you foolhardy sunbeam, caught
With a single splash from my ewer!
You that would mock the best pursuer,
Was my basin over-deep?
One splash of water ruins you asleep,
And up, up, fleet your brilliant bits
Wheeling and counterwheeling,
Reeling, broken beyond healing:
Now grow together on the ceiling!
That will task your wits.
Whoever it was quenched fire first, hoped to see
Morsel after morsel flee
As merrily, as giddily . . .
Meantime, what lights my sunbeam on,
Where settles by degrees the radiant cripple?
Oh, is it surely blown, my martagon?
New-blown and ruddy as St. Agnes' nipple,
Plump as the flesh-bunch on some Turk bird's poll!
Be sure if corals, branching 'neath the ripple
Of ocean, bud there,-fairies watch unroll
Such turban-flowers; I say, such lamps disperse
Thick red flame through that dusk green universe!
And each fleshy blossom
Preserve I not-(safer
Than leaves that embower it,
Or shells that embosom)
-From weevil and chafer?
Laugh through my pane then; solicit the bee;
Gibe him, be sure; and, in midst of thy glee,


-Worship whom else? For am I not, this day,
Whate'er I please? What shall I please to-day?
My morn, noon, eve and night-how spend my day?
To-morrow I must be Pippa who winds silk,
The whole year round, to earn just bread and milk:
But, this one day, I have leave to go,
And play out my fancy's fullest games;
I may fancy all day-and it shall be so-
That I taste of the pleasures, am called by the names
Of the Happiest Four in our Asolo!
See! Up the hill-side yonder, through the morning,
Some one shall love me, as the world calls love:
I am no less than Ottima, take warning!
The gardens, and the great stone house above,
And other house for shrubs, all glass in front,
Are mine; where Sebald steals, as he is wont,
To court me, while old Luca yet reposes:
And therefore, till the shrub-house door uncloses,
I . . . what now?-give abundant cause for prate
About me-Ottima, I mean-of late,
Too bold, too confident she'll still face down
The spitefullest of talkers in our town.
How we talk in the little town below!


But love, love, love-there's better love, I know!
This foolish love was only day's first offer;
I choose my next love to defy the scoffer:
For do not our Bride and Bridegroom sally
Out of Possagno church at noon?
Their house looks over Orcana valley:
Why should not I be the bride as soon
As Ottima? For I saw, beside,
Arrive last night that little bride-
Saw, if you call it seeing her, one flash
Of the pale snow-pure cheek and black bright tresses,
Blacker than all except the black eyelash;
I wonder she contrives those lids no dresses!
-So strict was she, the veil
Should cover close her pale
Pure cheeks-a bride to look at and scarce touch,
Scarce touch, remember, Jules! For are not such
Used to be tended, flower-like, every feature,
As if one's breath would fray the lily of a creature?
A soft and easy life these ladies lead:
Whiteness in us were wonderful indeed.
Oh, save that brow its virgin dimness,
Keep that foot its lady primness,
Let those ankles never swerve
From their exquisite reserve,
Yet have to trip along the streets like me,
All but naked to the knee!
How will she ever grant her Jules a bliss
So startling as her real first infant kiss?
Oh, no-not envy, this!


-Not envy, sure!-for if you gave me
Leave to take or to refuse,
In earnest, do you think I'd choose
That sort of new love to enslave me?
Mine should have lapped me round from the beginning;
As little fear of losing it as winning:
Lovers grow cold, men learn to hate their wives,
And only parents' love can last our lives.
At eve the Son and Mother, gentle pair,
Commune inside our turret: what prevents
My being Luigi? While that mossy lair
Of lizards through the winter-time is stirred
With each to each imparting sweet intents
For this new-year, as brooding bird to bird-
(For I observe of late, the evening walk
Of Luigi and his mother, always ends
Inside our ruined turret, where they talk,
Calmer than lovers, yet more kind than friends)
-Let me be cared about, kept out of harm,
And schemed for, safe in love as with a charm;
Let me be Luigi! If I only knew
What was my mother's face-my father, too!


Nay, if you come to that, best love of all
Myself as, in the palace by the Dome,
Monsignor?-who to-night will bless the home
That heart which beats, those eyes which mildly burn
With love for all men! I, to-night at least,
Would be that holy and beloved priest.


Now wait!-even I already seem to share
What other meaning do these verses bear?


If now, as formerly he trod
Paradise, his presence fills
Are we; there is no last nor first.


Say not 'a small event!' Why 'small'?
Costs it more pain that this, ye call
A 'great event,' should come to pass,
Than that? Untwine me from the mass
Of deeds which make up life, one deed
Power shall fall short in or exceed!


And more of it, and more of it!-oh yes-
I will pass each, and see their happiness,
And envy none-being just as great, no doubt,
A pretty thing to care about
So mightily, this single holiday!
But let the sun shine! Wherefore repine?
-With thee to lead me, O Day of mine,
Down the grass path grey with dew,
Under the pine-wood, blind with boughs,
Where the swallow never flew
Nor yet cicala dared carouse-
No, dared carouse!

[She enters the street]I ask them to take a poem
and hold it up to the light 
like a color slide

or press an ear against its hive.

I say drop a mouse into a poem
and watch him probe his way out,

or walk inside the poem's room
and feel the walls for a light switch.

I want them to waterski
across the surface of a poem
waving at the author's name on the shore.

But all they want to do
is tie the poem to a chair with rope
and torture a confession out of it.

They begin beating it with a hose
to find out what it really means. 

Piping down the valleys wild,
   Piping songs of pleasant glee,
 On a cloud I saw a child,
   And he laughing said to me:
 
 'Pipe a song about a Lamb!'
   So I piped with merry cheer.
 'Piper, pipe that song again;'
   So I piped: he wept to hear.
 
 'Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;
   Sing thy songs of happy cheer:!'
 So I sang the same again,
   While he wept with joy to hear.
 
 'Piper, sit thee down and write
   In a book, that all may read.'
 So he vanish'd from my sight;
   And I pluck'd a hollow reed,
 
 And I made a rural pen,
   And I stain'd the water clear,
 And I wrote my happy songs
   Every child may joy to hear. 

OH! blest art thou, whose steps may rove
Through the green paths of vale and grove,
Or, leaving all their charms below, 
Climb the wild mountain's airy brow; 

And gaze afar o'er cultured plains, 
And cities with their stately fanes, 
And forests, that beneath thee lie, 
And ocean mingling with the sky. 

For man can show thee nought so fair, 
As Nature's varied marvels there; 
And if thy pure and artless breast
Can feel their grandeur, thou art blest! 

For thee the stream in beauty flows, 
For thee the gale of summer blows,
And, in deep glen and wood-walk free, 
Voices of joy still breathe for thee. 

But happier far, if then thy soul
Can soar to Him who made the whole,
If to thine eye the simplest flower
Portray His bounty and His power. 

If, in whate'er is bright or grand, 
Thy mind can trace His viewless hand, 
If Nature's music bid thee raise
Thy song of gratitude and praise; 

If heaven and earth, with beauty fraught, 
Lead to His throne thy raptured thought, 
If there thou lov'st His love to read, 
Then, wanderer, thou art blest indeed. 

If you go deep
Into the heart
What do you find there?
Fear, fear,
Fear of the jaws of the rock,
Fear of the teeth and splinters of iron that tear
Flesh from the bone, and the moist
Blood, running unfelt
From the wound, and the hand
Suddenly moist and red.

If you go deep
Into the heart
What do you find?
Grief, grief,
Grief for the life unlived,
For the loves unloved,
For the child never to be born,
Th'unbidden anguish, when the fair moon
Rises over still summer seas, and the pain
Of sunlight scattered in vain on spring grass.

If you go deeper
Into the heart
What do you find there?
Death, death,
Death tht lets all go by,
Lets the blood flow from the wound,
Lets the night pass,
Endures the day with indifference, knowing that all must end.
Sorrow is not forever, ad sense
Endures no extremities,
Death is the last Secret implicit within you, the hidden, the deepest
Knowledge of all you will ever unfold
In this body of earth. 

Journey into depth of soul, 
slippery slope or mere hell-hole; 
taken despite wary warning
finds may cause massive mourning.

Reaching, rasping, regurgitating; 
finding, feeling, formulating
thoughts unseen, untold, unknown, 
long forgotten and forlorn.

Raped by my own regret; 
insulted by my intellect; 
scarred by scathing sarcasm; 
flailing, falling into chasm.

Beaten, broken, left for dead; 
blatant bleeding in my head; 
holding heart in trembling hand; 
regretting journey in this land.

Journey long and journey cold; 
jarring, jolting, journey old; 
turning over every stone; 
journey taken all alone. 

I think, I thought, what did i think
I said, I wonder, what did i say
In my mind all thoughts jumbled
Mixed up and always rumbled
Confusion, I ponder, and then I say
My thoughts were good today
Time for me to go to sleep
I think, I thought, what will i think tomorrow

I acquire the sensational psychology in me
Which reliably wraps my mind and me

Up in a blissful blanket of yarn – 
Hand-knitted by Creativity herself.

Heater-like –
The blanket bathes 

Us in a glow
Of what light feels like.

My mind and I breathe united as
An inseparable couple.

Friend-like –
We gleefully greet each other

Beneath the spotlight of Freedom's moon.
Poems and thoughts are the stars.

And like Freedom's moon 
Solitude nearly reaches a curious finger

All the way down to us.
Freedom faithfully follows her

With luscious
Loyalty like a leader.

Sensuality wears her evening perfume 
On Winter's barren brown deck

Like Femininity –
But she does not quite copy her.

Introspection
Rightfully wears 

The passionate ever-moving flame
Of a smile

In the still fireplace –
Almost silent but not. 

in this quiet house
i can hear my secret thoughts~~
as the doorbell rings

(yet, too little can be as bad) .
The more that you think (and think and think)      
the more you forget to wash - - you stink! 
So, look into your heart sometime, 
but don't forget life's more than a Rhyme - - 
or Reason may finally desert you
and your kinfolk may act to hurt you.

A Sort of Moral:  
A stinky thinker is no better than dry ink
or a rinky-dink poem like this (wink*  wink*) ! 


 would live all my life in nonchalance and insouciance
Were it not for making a living, which is rather a nouciance. 

On a y-shaped twig hanging on the stream
The kingfisher was absorbed in fishy dream
Move close I told myself move as close
To make sure you shoot its meditative pose.

Instinctively manifold alert and smart
It didn’t oblige me as an object of art
But flew away with the thought in its mind

No luck now with the rascal creeping behind

After I had cut off my hands
and grown new ones

something my former hands had longed for
came and asked to be rocked.

After my plucked out eyes
had withered, and new ones grown

something my former eyes had wept for
came asking to be pitied. 

Glimpses of you keep chasing
the corners of my eyes.
That I'm trying to evade you; 
one could easily surmise.

I see you in the corners
of streets I used to walk; 
in faces of people
who want to stop and talk.

So, I'm putting up my walls; 
solid mortar and bricks.
Gonna hole myself in
just for giggles and kicks.

But the walls don't faze you; 
You know how to break in.
You've snuck into my veins; 
you're swimming deep within. 

Across the room he turned to stand and stare at her, 
She felt her soul stripped bare by this striking stranger.
No longer conscious of knowing her present location, 
Yet sensing this intrusive inspection, she felt such elation.

Across the room she observed him walking towards her, 
Great anxiety rising, and feeling deep passions stir.
Then face to face their lips met in complete sensual bliss, 
And two became one with an incredible emotional kiss.

We stopped at the kerb, that’s me and my friend, 
Looked left and looked right, for that was the rule, 
When a five ton, green army truck rounded the bend.

Then another, two more, then too many to count
Made a crowd of us wait for a share of the road.
The doors were removed, for swift entry no doubt, 
And were each nose to tail with a full, heavy load.
 
Yelled a man through angry cupped hands, "Can’t you wait? "
To a corporal with ribbons and fiery red mop; 
He replied with a nonchalant wave, "Sorry mate, 
"There’s a big job to do and no time to stop."

"Then what about us? " an irate woman asked, 
"Bad luck",  said a major slapping his cane, 
And he flashed a broad grin through his curly moustache, 
"It’s the war! " And the convoy lurched forward again.

A drizzelly rain made us all wet and cold, 
But in wonder to see the select of our land, 
Prepared to defend us as yeomen of old, 
Passed this way in a flood with weapons in hand.

It was clear to us all this was something quite new, 
For a thousand big trucks had come through by then, 
With artillery, tanks, battle wagons and crew
Ammunition, I’m sure, for millions of men.

Though we knew we were seeing a major advance, 
So well were we drilled with holding our tongue, 
That no word was said of Invasion of France; 
But we knew that at last the moment had come.

"Give ‘em the works" bawled a voice in the throng.
"Knock off their blocks! " we yelled, thrilled to the core, 
And we took off our caps and cheered them all on, 
While crossing the road was thought of no more.

We listened, for news on the wireless each day, 
Of our gallant new friends and their goal safely reached; 
Celebrated with joy when we heard it say, 
"The steel-bound Normandy coast has been breached."

			                                  * * *Tonight the moon is a cracker,
with a bite out of it
floating in the night,

and in a week or so
according to the calendar
it will probably look

like a silver football,
and nine, maybe ten days ago
it reminded me of a thin bright claw.

But eventually --
by the end of the month,
I reckon --

it will waste away
to nothing,
nothing but stars in the sky,

and I will have a few nights
to myself,
a little time to rest my jittery pen. 

Now I look around the warehouse and 
What do I see but 
Weapons of mass destruction for 
Me and for thee. 
Weapons of mass destruction, 
Piled before my eyes, and 
I can scarely comprehend their count. 

Stretch out a finger. 
Let's find out. 

O, the 
Nuclear device is a 
   weapon of mass destruction and the 
Anthrax powder is a 
   weapon of mass destruction and the 
Sarin gas is a 
   weapon of mass destruction and 
Many are the weapons that destroy en masse 
And there's more. 

O, the 
City-busting bomb is a 
   weapon of mass destruction and the 
Napalm bomb is a 
   weapon of mass destruction and the 
Burrowing smart bomb is a 
   weapon of mass destruction and 
Many are the bombs that destroy en masse 
And there's more. 

O, the 
Tough AIDS virus is a 
   weapon of mass destructon and the 
Mighty flu pandemic is a 
   weapon of mass destruction and the 
Drug resistant cholera is a 
   weapon of mass destruction and 
Many are the microbes that destroy en masse 
And there's more. 

O, the 
Fast new car is a 
   weapon of mass destruction and the 
Free-falling jet is a 
   weapon of mass destruction and the 
Derailed train is a 
   weapon of mass destruction and 
Many are the modes that destroy en masse 
And there's more. 

O, the 
Glowing cigarette is a 
   weapon of mass destruction and the 
Bitter shot of whisky is a 
   weapon of mass destruction and the 
Greasy burger-and-fries is a 
   weapon of mass destruction and 
Many are the habits that destroy en masse 
And there's more. 

The rifle and the knife and the hoe and the scythe 
Deployed in fear and wielded in hate are 
   weapons of mass destruction in the 
Right time and place, and 
Many are the tools and many are the toys that 
Destroy me and mine and destroy thee and thine 
Over time. 

Earth's winter cometh
And I being part of all
And sith the spirit of all moveth in me
I must needs bear earth's winter
Drawn cold and grey with hours
And joying in a momentary sun,
Lo I am withered with waiting till my spring cometh!
Or crouch covetous of warmth
O'er scant-logged ingle blaze,
Must take cramped joy in tomed Longinus
That, read I him first time
The woods agleam with summer
Or mid desirous winds of spring,
Had set me singing spheres
Or made heart to wander forth among warm roses
Or curl in grass next neath a kindly moon. 

Inversion

When truth is masked and lies declared as truth
Inversion comes around with Deception's fruit.
Those that patronize the blatant masquerade, 
Fall prey into the same set trap that they made.

Inversion's like a quick sand that swallows everything, 
Pretends to stand on rock but it is actually sinking.
Its words are meaningless and are not proven by deeds
For Inversion is the evil tool to where Falsehood leads.

Many go to other countries but hate the people's culture, 
They claim to be victims but they're actually the vultures
That seek to invade and implement their dominion
On the innocent citizens and so apply truth inversion.

A reverse of what's real and what we all know as truth-
Plagues us all around but we can trace its hidden root
We're not all blind and we're not ignorant fools
Not to see behind the ploy of those who desire to rule! 




. 

Uplifted spirits, enthusiasm, sweetheart

finally time to enjoy retirement start.

They know what they are doing, world's biggest, 

take our money, invest, you are wisest.

Only two percent for your expertise, a bargain.

Down fifty percent, we are done,  pass the gin. 

Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll.
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul. 

While the night stretch black over me
and in the dark sky I see countless lights
burning high, 
to choose which light to follow as a guide.

In dark circumstance and whatever fate brings, 
destiny and chance do not conquer 
and I still rise wiser 
to life and its things

and my will remains free 
to decide where my words 
and actions belong 
whether they are right or wrong
and to no human I bend a knee
and in all things I only answer to Him
who Captain’s me.

[References:  Invictus by William Ernest Henley and The Soul’s Captain by Orson F. Whitney.]Eres como la nieve que observa el paso del tiempo, 
que se desliza de a poco, lenta entre mis manos, 
eres tan pura y blanca, 
tan bella, tan gentil,  piel de seda, 
y solo depuras la llegada, 
para traerme de nuevo, 
mi ansiada primavera. 

Today, 
I am invincible.
Armored by my mind, 
My attitude, 
I cannot be destroyed.
I dance in the street: 
Oncoming cars 
Avoid me.
I am made of steel; 
Any car 
Would avoid an obstacle of steel.
I cannot die, today: 
I am invincible. 

You make me feel invisible, 
So painful to see that you don’t see me, 
Your not the only one that feels the way I do, 
Invisible is what I become, 
To be hated, 
To be drift away, 
Wash out the pain, 
Make a happy ending, 
No more tears, 
No more feeling this way, 
I rather be hated by you then feeling invisible, 
Ignore me, 
I shall ignore you, 
Lets start from scratch, 
Act like we never met, 
Instead you make me feel invisible. 

no one really cares.
no one understands.
no one listens.
no one saying encouraging words.
no one to talk to about things that happen, 
that affect me.
no one who cares about what my feelings are.
no one cares about me.
i think that i must be, 
invisible. 

I sit in the center
of the world
but yet, to you
i remain invisible
and in your ignorance
you say that i'm ravaged
and covered with poverty
wars and disease! 

How quickly you forget
that it was I 
who cradled you and
carried you on my back
when you were still young
but, you still mocked me
by telling me that
i was not smart enough
simply because you saw me
as black and uncivilized
but, the funny thing is
you would often come back
and consult my books 
from Alexandria
to expand your knowledge

Even when you left me
i sent my relatives
to help you
build your empires
you mistreated them
and forced them
to become your slaves
even though they helped
you grow rich, great
and powerful
even though, they made
what you are today! 

When you got married
and found new friends
it was my diamonds, 
gold and precious stones
that adorned your neck, 
hands and feet
but yet, you did not
appreciate them
and neither did you
thank me for them! 

When your factories
grew larger
you came back
and you robbed me
of everything else
my ancestors had left
me with
you sliced and shared
my land like a cake
and divided it amongst
yourselves
and all i could do
was watch as you
took it all away! 

And, as if 
that was not enough
you stripped me
of my dignity
when you took away
my liberty

Even though, i tried
to explain to the world
how i was a victim
in all this
it would not listen
because it also saw me
as a primitive, uncivilized
buffoon

Take a look, 
What do you see? 
A ghost in the corner, 
Or is it me? 
You walk right by
Like you dont even care
You must be blind
To see I'm not there


Dear Ocean of love in love you build, 
With affection to universe you yield.
Field we get to stand with home run, 
For lighting world wheel you tell sun.

By your command wind does dandle, 
Father you are more to us you fondle.
Many ask how do you do this invisible, 
They think and search in space unable.

Your thoughts vibrate us to get a boon, 
Although we do not see we get it soon.
Unlimited strength comes to path show
Colours are spread in both sides rainbow.

Plants grow with touch of nature of rain
Leaves shake green grasses give of pain.
We hold in palms many memories of us, 
You do shine in devotion ever in life thus.

Wonder creation you arrange dark matter, 
Planets move in space there in far better.
Moon falls with calmness on the dark night, 
Only your love father motivates in way right.

Light falls in life while we know souls we are, 
Far sky smiles with love of sun dazzles star.
Invisible rope of love is spread across creation, 
Oh father this binds all by power of emotion. 

Love is eternal and invisible, 
In no way this is again divisible.
Love shines inside heart more, 
Budding of love blooms in core.

Love flows from pure Divine, 
No poet till date does define.
Fine it is ever in the way right, 
Love dwells in mind shows light.

Fight it breaks with inner power, 
Love is ever green fragrance tower.
Cower do not all while love appears, 
Love brings in life unlimited cheers.

Careers are built on basis of love, 
It saves body mind ever like glove.
Dove sings in chirping nice song, 
In love of road we walk road long.

Strong mind holds love in tight, 
Love awakes in heart makes bright.
To father of heaven we forget never. 

Invisible or Visible, 
You will be with me, 
Always, 
Protecting me, 
Caring for me, 
Sharing with me, 
Loving me, 
And all these, 
Would be, 
Reasonably unreasonable. 

We turn a blind eye
on all those who are suffering, 
living in poverty
those who have nothing to eat! 
we pretend that 
they do not exist 
because it is much easier 
to ignore them! 
we've even succeeded 
in building a world protected 
and veiled against them! 

We turn a blind eye
on the dozens of beggars
that we meet in the streets fighting everyday for their lives
those exiled and out cast by society
because we have no place
for them in 'our perfect
Communities! ' 

We turn a blind eye on those
who do not have civil rights
those who remain exiled
by everyone
because we do not want to see them, 
let alone hear their silent pleas
for basic necessities
because it's much easier to
act as if these people don't exist hoping that they would all just disappear! 
and leave us alone! 

We turn a blind eye on
those dying from incurable diseases
those that still need our love 
because we consider them 
as those as already dead! 
after all its much easier
to look the other way
than lend them
a helping hand! 

My troubled heart 
looks at all these things
and i ask myself: 
if we are too blind
to see these invisible people? 
Or do we lack so much empathy that the suffering of others no longer bothers us? 

Well, the sad truth is: 
we really don't care

He was carrying bananas on his head
A long route to avoid any mishap happen
Parkinson’s disease had made his hands tremor
Every morning was not unlike earth quake
The old man had lost all his teeth biting dust
His white beard had though signs of spirituality
That comes with honest work in an age of seventy
To avoid search of the police man he would take
The long route to the garden where on benches
Strangely no one sat for they were too uncomfortable
Below the little trees were hiding some old and young
Three women reading the holy script in the hope 
To bring some fresh breeze from heaven up the west
In the canal water had gone rotten for littering rampant
A very young girl was begging who had come
From the nearby village she had the dried lips
Her brown green eyes had lost the shine still 
She did not know how to beg and her father
Who would chop woods and she earned enough 
For her day’s work to be away from home
A sister of five and his father unaware
There was announcement on radio to be ware
Of human smugglers I wondered may be angels
Protected her from the devils that throng the earth
The old man would sell enough bananas for his afternoon
And a happy sleep at night
There are no complaints here
I also take the opportunity 
Of congratulating you
To have achieved that esteemed position 
We are all proud of you
And then
I am also proud of every soul 
On earth achiever or non achiever

Give us names
Don’t call us names
From a person
An old woman
A young girl
Some boy
You and me
He and she
We and they

And a philosopher
Sits in residence
On Heathrow airport to experience
Travel
All that is attached to it
I am the subject again
Of the artist
For the amusement of the people
Who have names

And I do not have any name yet
Will you bother
To know who I am
I am 
A neighbor of a bull fighter
Whose children shout and fight
Every night
In a bucket
Eggs collected
Offering life 
To continue
Her own bucket of eggs
Revealing in the hard shells
Cell membranes
To be pierced by the agile sperm
Strong headed

She had covered her face
On the door of worship place
For hundreds to see
Her misery
Behind the veil of poverty
Veil of religion
And morality

She had exposed her inner desire
For life
To those
The ones who came 
Out after prayers
Who had long carrots
And corns
In their hands
Rubbing red chilies over them


Source  Invisible, 

I bow before life.
It is spontaneous reverence
before the sacredness of life.

I want to touch being itself.
It is spontaneous desire.

I wonder at the sacredness of being.

My awareness of my being
is like bubbles at a spring
throbbing up from the bottom.

Did you see – the source is invisible
transcendent and infinitely abundant. 

Once again confusion reigns
' Thou shalt not kill '
But it is seperated
By the Military
And the  'policy ' makers.

When they decide to act
Women, children and old men die
Suffering and death becomes normal
Something for the media to exploit
Our new definitions name it all
Collateral damage, friendly fire

It all boils down to one thing
A flag covered coffin ready for all the drama
And the decimated foriegn family
Forgotten. 

Never think my friends
That the absence of tears
Means nobody is crying at all
For there are invisible tears
That don't come through
The naked and weary eyes
But from the very bottom
Of a broken heart. 

Tears disguised as blood, 
Running wild through the veins
And causing through its journey
An uncontrollable and deep pain
Which turns one's life
Into a living Hell. 

Many times I deeply felt
Like crying and dropp real tears
But I couldn't because of pride
While I was really dying inside. 
Time slowly passed
And I overcame my agony, 
Moving on with dignity
In search of a new horizon
While overtaken by faith and hope
Thanking the Mighty One above. 


is hanging down from the rod
from the rod of love and care
To show lord's affection and cheer
And through this thread we're bound
in this world's merry go round
where up and down come by turns
By which we've alot to learn
And when we learn how to survive
In this odd world of death and life
Then it becomes easy for us all
To steadily stand in any fall
So try to hold on to it
As it has value in every bit
That is habging from the rod
From the rod of love and care

There is something to be noted about invisiblity
that life becomes empty and void of tranquility
some tell the answer, but I feel they're full of simplicity
for they've no idea what it's like to be me

to walk through the world but have no one see
no one looks at your eyes, always at your feet
and if you pass me on the street
you'd probably wouldnt know you passed me

they're always happy a smile on their face
but no one takes the time to know what's beneath mine
all the knowledge and thoughts and feelings held inside
no one wants to know them, no one has the time


If you are a dreamer, come in
If you are a dreamer, a wisher, a liar,
A hope-er, a pray-er, a magic bean buyer. 
If you're a pretender, come sit by the fire
For we have some flax-golden tales to spin.
Come in!
Come in

Say, wilt thou go with me, sweet maid,
Say, maiden, wilt thou go with me
Through the valley-depths of shade,
Of bright and dark obscurity;
Where the path has lost its way,
Where the sun forgets the day,
Where there's nor light nor life to see,
Sweet maiden, wilt thou go with me?

Where stones will turn to flooding streams,
Where plains will rise like ocean's waves,
Where life will fade like visioned dreams
And darkness darken into caves,
Say, maiden, wilt thou go with me
Through this sad non-identity
Where parents live and are forgot,
And sisters live and know us not?

Say, maiden, wilt thou go with me
In this strange death of life to be,
To live in death and be the same,
Without this life or home or name,
At once to be and not to be--
That was and is not--yet to see
Things pass like shadows, and the sky
Above, below, around us lie?

The land of shadows wilt thou trace,
Nor look nor know each other's face;
The present marred with reason gone,
And past and present both as one?
Say, maiden, can thy life be led
To join the living and the dead?
Then trace thy footsteps on with me:
We are wed to one eternity. 

You’ll dine well, in a few days, with me,
if the gods are kind to you, my dear Fabullus,
and if you bring lots of good food with you,
and don’t come without a pretty girl
and wine and wit and all your laughter.
I say you’ll dine well, and charmingly,
if you bring all that: since your Catullus’s
purse alas is full of cobwebs.
But accept endearments in return for the wine
or whatever’s sweeter and finer:
since I’ll give you a perfume my girl
was given by the Loves and Cupids,
and when you’ve smelt it, you’ll ask the gods
to make you, Fabullus, all nose. 

Come when the nights are bright with stars 
Or when the moon is mellow; 
Come when the sun his golden bars 
Drops on the hay-field yellow. 
Come in the twilight soft and gray, 
Come in the night or come in the day, 
Come, O love, whene'er you may, 
And you are welcome, welcome.

You are sweet, O Love, dear Love, 
You are soft as the nesting dove. 
Come to my heart and bring it rest 
As the bird flies home to its welcome nest.

Come when my heart is full of grief 
Or when my heart is merry; 
Come with the falling of the leaf 
Or with the redd'ning cherry. 
Come when the year's first blossom blows, 
Come when the summer gleams and glows, 
Come with the winter's drifting snows, 
And you are welcome, welcome. 

From Brooklyn, over the Brooklyn Bridge, on this fine morning,
     please come flying.
In a cloud of fiery pale chemicals,
     please come flying,
to the rapid rolling of thousands of small blue drums
descending out of the mackerel sky
over the glittering grandstand of harbor-water,
     pl ease come flying.

Whistles, pennants and smoke are blowing. The ships
are signaling cordially with multitudes of flags
rising and falling like birds all over the harbor.
Enter: two rivers, gracefully bearing
countless little pellucid jellies
in cut-glass epergnes dragging with silver chains.
The flight is safe; the weather is all arranged.
The waves are running in verses this fine morning.
     Please come flying.

Come with the pointed toe of each black shoe
trailing a sapphire highlight,
with a black capeful of butterfly wings and bon-mots,
with heaven knows how many angels all riding
on the broad black brim of your hat,
     please come flying.

Bearing a musical inaudible abacus,
a slight censorious frown, and blue ribbons,
     please come flying.
Facts and skyscrapers glint in the tide; Manhattan
is all awash with morals this fine morning,
     so please come flying.

Mounting the sky with natural heroism,
above the accidents, above the malignant movies,
the taxicabs and injustices at large,
while horns are resounding in your beautiful ears
that simultaneously listen to
a soft uninvented music, fit for the musk deer,
     please come flying.

For whom the grim museums will behave
like courteous male bower-birds,
for whom the agreeable lions lie in wait
on the steps of the Public Library,
eager to rise and follow through the doors
up into the reading rooms,
     please come flying.
We can sit down and weep; we can go shopping,
or play at a game of constantly being wrong
with a priceless set of vocabularies,
or we can bravely deplore, but please
     please come flying.

With dynasties of negative constructions
darkening and dying around you,
with grammar that suddenly turns and shines
like flocks of sandpipers flying,
     please come flying.

Come like a light in the white mackerel sky,
come like a daytime comet
with a long unnebulous train of words,
from Brooklyn, over the Brooklyn Bridge, on this fine morning,
     please come flying. 

Imagine, ma petite,
Dear sister mine, how sweet
Were we to go and take our pleasure
Leisurely, you and I—
To lie, to love, to die
Off in that land made to your measure!
A land whose suns' moist rays,
Through the skies' misty haze,
Hold quite the same dark charms for me
As do your scheming eyes
When they, in their like wise,
Shine through your tears, perfidiously.

There all is order, naught amiss:
Comfort and beauty, calm and bliss.

Treasure galore—ornate,
Time-glossed—would decorate
Our chamber, where the rarest blooms
Would blend their lavish scent,
Heady and opulent,
With wisps of amber-like perfumes;
Where all the Orient's
Splendid, rich ornaments—
Deep mirrors, ceilings fine—would each,
In confidential tone,
Speak to the soul alone
In its own sweet and secret speech.

There all is order, naught amiss:
Comfort and beauty, calm and bliss.

See how the ships, asleep—
They who would ply the deep!—
Line the canals: to satisfy
Your merest whim they come
From far-flung heathendom
And skim the seven seas. —On high,
The sunset's rays enfold
In hyacinth and gold,
Field and canal; and, with the night,
As shadows gently fall,
Behold! Life sleeps, and all
Lies bathed in warmth and evening light.

There all is order, naught amiss:
Comfort and beauty, calm and bliss. 

Come and paint for your friends 
Show your passion for the colors
The vibrancy of colors for everyone to see
The Orange and blue combination, maybe.

You will be enthralled by a master wizard
Irrespective of heavy rain or a blizzard
You can learn a trick or two! 
And maybe show a few of them too.

It is the anniversary week at our office
Where you will be entertained with a new code
Joy, fun and laughter for each and everyone
And you can get a lot of work done

You have an opportunity to paint a wall
Your paintings shall be standing tall
For all the staff and customers for ever
The vibrancy retained will be our endeavour.

Lots of work to be done
Lots of prizes to be won
Don’t forget to remind your mother\father
Or the prizes will go to some other. 

My only theme -years or more brought, 
But I care not: the bards had more choice.
Fiends that conspired to lodge a wedge, 
Time, fate, pedigree -in heydays did rejoice.

Was it our playful recklessness that sent the invite? 
Well! Words not yet stale, zest, time deign not dull, 
Passions, still aglow, enough to draw spite
Breaths so short; marring measure fight.

Surging let the tsunami seas devour, or globe warm to the core, 
Pollute the opulent seas, spade the earth,  draw the hopeless future to its knees, 
I shall not cross his  play with destinies or a heedful word utter, 
Provided, he sends you  in my path, like in a star’s dwindling sight, blazes a glowing meteor.

No longer to live a life in respite; but in glare of full sunlight, 
Lest you not recognize me in my grab of grime and dirt, 
Must I wait for some secret sense to point you out? 
Or will a familiar hand grab me for life and remove the doubt.

We may not at these crossroads again stand, 
Then let’s go without a backward glance, the fiends are just behind.


h Dec-hildhood o childhood; 
please come back once again; 
i again want to enjoy my that
days; 
where i can fell all the moment; 
which i have spend with nature.

Rarely, rarely, comest thou,
Spirit of Delight!
Wherefore hast thou left me now
Many a day and night?
Many a weary night and day
'Tis since thou art fled away.

How shall ever one like me
Win thee back again?
With the joyous and the free
Thou wilt scoff at pain.
Spirit false! thou hast forgot
All but those who need thee not.

As a lizard with the shade
Of a trembling leaf,
Thou with sorrow art dismayed;
Even the sighs of grief
Reproach thee, that thou art not near,
And reproach thou wilt not hear.

Let me set my mournful ditty
To a merry measure;
Thou wilt never come for pity,
Thou wilt come for pleasure; - 
Pity then will cut away
Those cruel wings, and thou wilt stay.

I love all that thou lovest,
Spirit of Delight!
The fresh Earth in new leaves dressed,
And the starry night;
Autumn evening, and the morn
When the golden mists are born.

I love snow and all the forms
Of the radiant frost;
I love waves, and winds, and storms,
Everything almost
Which is Nature's, and may be
Untainted by man's misery.

I love tranquil solitude,
And such society
As is quiet, wise, and good: - 
Between thee and me
What diff'rence? but thou dost possess
The things I seek, not love them less.

I love Love -though he has wings,
And like light can flee,
But above all other things,
Spirit, I love thee - 
Thou art love and life! O come!
Make once more my heart thy home

We are busy with the luxury of things.
Their number and multiple faces bring
To us confusion we call knowledge. Say:
Made mountains to weigh it down, seas
To wash its face, living creatures with pleas
(The ancestors of prayers) seeking a place
In this mystery that floats in endless space.


The bull on a fish dancing on a spool
Of silver light so fine it is like air;
That in turn rests on nothing there
But nothing that nothing can share.

Answer me, burning stars of night!
Where is the spirit gone,
That past the reach of human sight,
As a swift breeze hath flown?"
And the stars answer'd me"'We roll
In light and power on high;
But, of the never-dying soul,
Ask that which cannot die.' 

Oh! many-toned and chainless wind!
Thou art a wanderer free;
Tell me if thou its place canst find,
Far over mount and sea?"
And the wind murmur'd in reply,
'The blue deep I have cross'd,
And met its barks and billows high,
But not what thou hast lost.' 

Ye clouds, that gorgeously repose
Around the setting sun,
Answer! have ye a home for those
Whose earthly race is run?
The bright clouds answer'd"'We depart,
We vanish from the sky;
Ask what is deathless in thy heart,
For that which cannot die.' 

Thou of the deep, low tone!
Answer me, thro' life's restless din,
Where is the spirit flown?
And the voice answer'd"'Be thou still!
Enough to know is given;
Clouds, winds, and stars their part fulfil,
Thine is to trust in Heaven.

Come down from heaven to meet me when my breath 
Chokes, and through drumming shafts of stifling death 
I stumble toward escape, to find the door 
Opening on morn where I may breathe once more 
Clear cock-crow airs across some valley dim
With whispering trees. While dawn along the rim 
Of night’s horizon flows in lakes of fire, 
Come down from heaven’s bright hill, my song’s desire. 

Belov’d and faithful, teach my soul to wake 
In glades deep-ranked with flowers that gleam and shake
And flock your paths with wonder. In your gaze 
Show me the vanquished vigil of my days. 
Mute in that golden silence hung with green, 
Come down from heaven and bring me in your eyes 
Remembrance of all beauty that has been,
And stillness from the pools of Paradise.(after Lina Spies) 

the whole streched out universe
galaxies in their rings, 
lies open before you as a piece of canvas

where You do know the names of each sun, of each starry system, 
do command a multitude of angels, beings without number, 
You that in Your omnipotence do calculate the destiny of every living thing, 
please do hear my call:  I have won the heart of a woman

did love her unequalled
out of the depth of my heart
without reason or calculation

and she did tell me
that I am the light in her life
and between us
was Your image

I ask that our love will stay like this, 
here where our lives are but a fleeting light
in a world that does try to devour our humanity
where darkness tries to come constantly.

I.
Come, be happy!—sit near me,
Shadow-vested Misery:
Coy, unwilling, silent bride,
Mourning in thy robe of pride,
Desolation—deified! 

II.
Come, be happy!—sit near me:
Sad as I may seem to thee,
I am happier far than thou,
Lady, whose imperial brow
Is endiademed with woe. 

III.
Misery! we have known each other,
Like a sister and a brother
Living in the same lone home,
Many years—we must live some
Hours or ages yet to come.

IV.
’Tis an evil lot, and yet
Let us make the best of it;
If love can live when pleasure dies,
We two will love, till in our eyes
This heart’s Hell seem Paradise.

V.
Come, be happy!—lie thee down
On the fresh grass newly mown,
Where the Grasshopper doth sing
Merrily—one joyous thing
In a world of sorrowing! 

VI.
There our tent shall be the willow,
And mine arm shall be thy pillow;
Sounds and odours, sorrowful
Because they once were sweet, shall lull
Us to slumber, deep and dull. 

VII.
Ha! thy frozen pulses flutter
With a love thou darest not utter.
Thou art murmuring—thou art weeping—
Is thine icy bosom leaping
While my burning heart lies sleeping?

VIII.
Kiss me;—oh! thy lips are cold:
Round my neck thine arms enfold—
They are soft, but chill and dead;
And thy tears upon my head
Burn like points of frozen lead.

IX.
Hasten to the bridal bed—
Underneath the grave ’tis spread:
In darkness may our love be hid,
Oblivion be our coverlid—
We may rest, and none forbid.

X.
Clasp me till our hearts be grown
Like two shadows into one;
Till this dreadful transport may
Like a vapour fade away,
In the sleep that lasts alway. 

XI.
We may dream, in that long sleep,
That we are not those who weep;
E’en as Pleasure dreams of thee,
Life-deserting Misery,
Thou mayst dream of her with me.

XII.
Let us laugh, and make our mirth,
At the shadows of the earth,
As dogs bay the moonlight clouds,
Which, like spectres wrapped in shrouds,
Pass o’er night in multitudes.

XIII.
All the wide world, beside us,
Show like multitudinous
Puppets passing from a scene;
What but mockery can they mean,
Where I am—where thou hast been

I

'REST, rest, perturbed Earth!
O rest, thou doleful Mother of Mankind!'
A Spirit sang in tones more plaintive than the wind:
'From regions where no evil thing has birth
I come--thy stains to wash away,
Thy cherished fetters to unbind,
And open thy sad eyes upon a milder day.
The Heavens are thronged with martyrs that have risen
From out thy noisome prison;
The penal caverns groan
With tens of thousands rent from off the tree
Of hopeful life,--by battle's whirlwind blown
Into the deserts of Eternity.
Unpitied havoc! Victims unlamented!
But not on high, where madness is resented,
And murder causes some sad tears to flow,
Though, from the widely-sweeping blow,
The choirs of Angels spread, triumphantly augmented.

II

'False Parent of Mankind!
Obdurate, proud, and blind,
I sprinkle thee with soft celestial dews,
Thy lost, maternal heart to re-infuse!
Scattering this far-fetched moisture from my wings,
Upon the act a blessing I implore,
Of which the rivers in their secret springs,
The rivers stained so oft with human gore,
Are conscious;--may the like return no more!
May Discord--for a Seraph's care
Shall be attended with a bolder prayer--
May she, who once disturbed the seats of bliss
These mortal spheres above,
Be chained for ever to the black abyss.
And thou, O rescued Earth, by peace and love,
And merciful desires, thy sanctity approve!'
The Spirit ended his mysterious rite,
And the pure vision closed in darkness infinite. 

For My Sister's Grotto

FAYS and Fairies haste away! 
This is Harriet's holiday:
Bring the lyre, and bring the lute,
Bring the sweetly-breathing flute; 
Wreaths of cowslips hither bring,
All the honours of the spring; 
Adorn the grot with all that's gay,
Fays and Fairies haste away.
Bring the vine to Bacchus dear,
Bring the purple lilac here,
Festoons of roses, sweetest flower,
The yellow primrose of the bower,
Blue-ey'd violets wet with dew,
Bring the clustering woodbine too.
Bring in baskets made of rush,
The cherry with its ripen'd blush,
The downy peach, so soft so fair,
The luscious grape, the mellow pear:
These to Harriet hither bring,
And sweetly in return she'll sing.
Be the brilliant grotto scene
Form the sprightly circling dance,
Fairies here your steps advance; 
To the harp's soft dulcet sound,
Let your footsteps lightly bound.
Unveil your forms to mortal eye; 
Let Harriet view your revelry. 

Read by the poet at The Public Ceremonial of The Naional Institute 
of Arts and Letters at Carnegie Hall, New York, January h, 

Great Muse, that from this hall absent for long
Hast never been, 
Great Muse of Song,
Colossal Muse of mighty Melody,
Vocal Calliope,
With thine august and contrapuntal brow
And thy vast throat builded for Harmony,
For the strict monumental pure design,
And the melodic line:
Be thou tonight with all beneath these rafters—be with me.
If I address thee in archaic style—
Words obsolete, words obsolescent,
It is that for a little while
The heart must, oh indeed must from this angry and out-rageous present
Itself withdraw
Into some past in which most crooked Evil,
Although quite certainly conceived and born, was not as yet the Law.

Archaic, or obsolescent at the least,
Be thy grave speaking and the careful words of thy clear song,
For the time wrongs us, and the words most common to our speech today
Salute and welcome to the feast
Conspicuous Evil— or against him all day long
Cry out, telling of ugly deeds and most uncommon wrong.

Be thou tonight with all beneath these rafters—be with me
But oh, be more with those who are not free.
Who, herded into prison camps all shame must suffer and all outrage see.
Where music is not played nor sung,
Though the great voice be there, no sound from the dry throat across the thickened tongue
Comes forth; nor has he heart for it.
Beauty in all things—no, we cannot hope for that; but some place set apart for it.
Here it may dwell;
And with your aid, Melpomene
And all thy sister-muses (for ye are, I think, daughters of Memory)
Within the tortured mind as well.

Reaped are those fields with dragon's-teeth so lately sown;
Many the heaped men dying there - so close, hip touches thigh; yet each man dies alone.
Music, what overtone
For the soft ultimate sigh or the unheeded groan
Hast thou—to make death decent, where men slip
Down blood to death, no service of grieved heart or ritual lip
Transferring what was recently a man and still is warm—
Transferring his obedient limbs into the shallow grave where not again a friend shall greet him,
Nor hatred do him harm . . .
Nor true love run to meet him?

In the last hours of him who lies untended
On a cold field at night, and sees the hard bright stars
Above his upturned face, and says aloud "How strange . . . my life is ended

"—
If in the past he loved great music much, and knew it well,
Let not his lapsing mind be teased by well-beloved but ill- remembered bars —
Let the full symphony across the blood-soaked field
By him be heard, most pure in every part,
The lonely horror of whose painful death is thus repealed,
Who dies with quiet tears upon his upturned face, making to glow with softness the hard stars.

And bring to those who knew great poetry well
Page after page that they have loved but have not learned by heart!
We who in comfort to well-lighted shelves
Can turn for all the poets ever wrote,
Beseech you: Bear to those
Who love high art no less than we ourselves,
Those who lie wounded, those who in prison cast
Strive to recall, to ease them, some great ode, and every stanza save the last.

Recall—oh, in the dark, restore them
The unremembered lines; make bright the page before them!
Page after page present to these,
In prison concentrated, watched by barbs of bayonet and wire,
Give ye to them their hearts' intense desire—
The words of Shelley, Virgil, Sophocles.

And thou, O lovely and not sad,
Euterpe, be thou in this hall tonight!
Bid us remember all we ever had 
Of sweet and gay delight—
We who are free,
But cannot quite be glad,
Thinking of huge, abrupt disaster brought
Upon so many of our kind
Who treasure as do we the vivid look on the unfrightened face,
The careless happy stride from place to place,
And the unbounded regions of untrammelled thought
Open as interstellar space
To the exploring and excited mind.

O Muses, O immortal Nine!—
Or do ye languish? Can ye die?
Must all go under?—
How shall we heal without your help a world
By these wild horses torn asunder?
How shall we build anew? — How start again?
How cure, how even moderate this pain
Without you, and you strong?
And if ye sleep, then waken!
And if ye sicken and do plan to die,
Do not that now!

Hear us, in what sharp need we cry!
For we have help nowhere
If not in you!
Pity can much, and so a mighty mind, but cannot all things do!—
By you forsaken,
We shall be scattered, we shall be overtaken!
Oh, come! Renew in us the ancient wonder,
The grace of life, its courage, and its joy!
Weave us those garlands nothing can destroy!
Come! with your radiant eyes! — with your throats of thunder

Señora, it is true the Greeks are dead. 

It is true also that we here are Americans: 
That we use the machines: that a sight of the god is unusual: 
That more people have more thoughts: that there are 

Progress and science and tractors and revolutions and 
Marx and the wars more antiseptic and murderous 
And music in every home: there is also Hoover. 

Does the lady suggest we should write it out in The Word? 
Does Madame recall our responsibilities? We are 
Whores, Fraulein: poets, Fraulein, are persons of 

Known vocation following troops: they must sleep with 
Stragglers from either prince and of both views. 
The rules permit them to further the business of neither. 

It is also strictly forbidden to mix in maneuvers. 
Those that infringe are inflated with praise on the plazas— 
Their bones are resultantly afterwards found under newspapers. 

Preferring life with the sons to death with the fathers, 
We also doubt on the record whether the sons 
Will still be shouting around with the same huzzas— 

For we hope Lady to live to lie with the youngest. 
There are only a handful of things a man likes, 
Generation to generation, hungry or 

Well fed: the earth’s one: life’s 
One: Mister Morgan is not one. 


There is nothing worse for our trade than to be in style. 

He that goes naked goes further at last than another. 
Wrap the bard in a flag or a school and they’ll jimmy his 
Door down and be thick in his bed—for a month: 


(Who recalls the address now of the Imagists?) 
But the naked man has always his own nakedness. 
People remember forever his live limbs. 

They may drive him out of the camps but one will take him. 
They may stop his tongue on his teeth with a rope’s argument— 
He will lie in a house and be warm when they are shaking. 

Besides, Tovarishch, how to embrace an army? 
How to take to one’s chamber a million souls? 
How to conceive in the name of a column of marchers? 

The things of the poet are done to a man alone 
As the things of love are done—or of death when he hears the 
Step withdraw on the stair and the clock tick only. 

Neither his class nor his kind nor his trade may come near him 
There where he lies on his left arm and will die, 
Nor his class nor his kind nor his trade when the blood is jeering 

And his knee’s in the soft of the bed where his love lies. 

I remind you, Barinya, the life of the poet is hard— 
A hardy life with a boot as quick as a fiver: 

Is it just to demand of us also to bear arms

Write not hoping a receptive audience.

Write what's not nonsense. 

The journey is never limited to physical traveling
It is about exploring the avenues and availing
What can be best for human life in further quest? 
How to adjust to the situation as possibly as best? 

The lust for smooth company never ends
They can never remain as good friends
You will be deserted as soon as your fortune is in doubt
There remains only unhappiness and gloom to talk about

Same way you are pushed very far to get the wealth
You care for nothing in blind race including health
What you get after making all desperate bids? 
Exactly you may be unaware or blind without any lids

When you are fully contended with what you had expected? 
What was achieved and how much can be really respected? 
As there is no end to our fancy and hunger for materialistic world  
We may go to any extent for acquiring even if soul is to be sold 

As time nears for your departure, you suddenly wake up to reality
You may think of another world by thinking of its futility 
You try to work on some religious books and get some solace
Go for all kinds of ways, search new grounds and shun the palace

The inward strength sprit doesn’t allow you to surrender
You are getting some kind of signals as reminders
Something must be done at this stage for lovely end
Change whole life system with complete new trend

You are now living a free bird
Flying high in open and aim at skyward
This is time when you think of infinity
Best way to reform with liberal approach and fine quality


FAR from the northward, from the cloven ridges, 
Pine-girt, deep-drifted with bewildering snows, 
By ice-plowed gorge, the leaping river bridges, 
Light span by span, from lake to lake below, 
By mountain meadow, and the snow-fed hollow 
Where birch and buckthorn thicket mark the trail, 
Spurning the tawny hills in haste to follow 
The long, brown reaches of a desert vale.

To east and west roll up the purple ranges, 
Foot bound about by leopard-colored hills; 
From east to west their serrate shadow changes; 
From west to east stream down the tumbling rills. 
Mocking the shadeless slopes and sullen ledges, 
Through the sunburnt wastes of sage and yellow sand, 
Run down to meet thy willows and thy sedges, -- 
O lonely river in a lonely land!

Foamless and swift thy winding waters follow 
To find, unbosomed to the wind-swept skies, 
The great lake lapping in a tideless hollow, 
Wanton to each day's changes as they rise, -- 
Purpling to meet the splendor of their mornings, 
Paling to catch their tender mid-day blue, 
Trembling alike to smilings and to scornings, -- 
Fleet light of loves, it cannot hold one true.

Like some great lioness beside the river, 
With passion slumbering in her half-shut eyes, 
Watching the light from heated sands up-quiver, 
Untamed and barren, lone the valley lies. 
Forego, O River, all the wrong you do her, 
Hasting your waters to the bitter lake, 
Rise from your reedy marges and subdue her, 
So shall the land be fertile for your sake. 

I wish not to lie here.
There's hardly a plot of earth not blessed for burial, but here
One might dream badly.

In beautiful seas a beautiful
And sainted island, but the dark earth so shallow on the rock
Gorged with bad meat.

Kings buried in the lee of the saint,
Kings of fierce Norway, blood-boltered Scotland, bitterly dreaming
Treacherous Ireland.

Imagine what delusions of grandeur,
What suspicion-agonized eyes, what jellies of arrogance and terror
This earth has absorbed. 

I.
AH, yes, 't is sweet still to remember,
Though 't were less painful to forget;
For while my heart glows like an ember,
Mine eyes with sorrow's drops are wet,
And, oh, my heart is aching yet.
It is a law of mortal pain
That old wounds, long accounted well,
Beneath the memory's potent spell,
Will wake to life and bleed again.
So 't is with me; it might be better
If I should turn no look behind, —
If I could curb my heart, and fetter
From reminiscent gaze my mind,
Or let my soul go blind — go blind!
But would I do it if I could?
Nay! ease at such a price were spurned;
For, since my love was once returned,
All that I suffer seemeth good.
I know, I know it is the fashion,
When love has left some heart distressed,
To weight the air with wordful passion;
But I am glad that in my breast
I ever held so dear a guest.
Love does not come at every nod,
Or every voice that calleth 'hasten;'
He seeketh out some heart to chasten,
Love is no random road wayfarer
Who Where he may must sip his glass.
Love is the King, the Purple-Wearer,
Whose guard recks not of tree or grass
To blaze the way that he may pass.
What if my heart be in the blast
That heralds his triumphant way;
Shall I repine, shall I not say:
'Rejoice, my heart, the King has passed!'
In life, each heart holds some sad story —
The saddest ones are never told.
I, too, have dreamed of fame and glory,
And viewed the future bright with gold; 
But that is as a tale long told.
Mine eyes have lost their youthful flash,
My cunning hand has lost its art;
I am not old, but in my heart
The ember lies beneath the ash.
I loved! Why not? My heart was youthful,
My mind was filled with healthy thought.
He doubts not whose own self is truthful,
Doubt by dishonesty is taught;
So loved! boldly, fearing naught.
I did not walk this lowly earth;
Mine was a newer, higher sphere,
Where youth was long and life was dear,
And all save love was little worth.
Her likeness! Would that I might limn it,
As Love did, with enduring art;
Nor dust of days nor death may dim it,
Where it lies graven on my heart,
Of this sad fabric of my life a part.
I would that I might paint her now
As I beheld her in that day, 
Ere her first bloom had passed away,
And left the lines upon her brow.
A face serene that, beaming brightly,
Disarmed the hot sun's glances bold.
A foot that kissed the ground so lightly,
He frowned in wrath and deemed her cold,
But loved her still though he was old.
A form where every maiden grace
Bloomed to perfection's richest flower, —
The statued pose of conscious power,
Like lithe-limbed Dian's of the chase.
Beneath a brow too fair for frowning,
Like moon-lit deeps that glass the skies
Till all the hosts above seem drowning,
Looked forth her steadfast hazel eyes,
With gaze serene and purely wise.
And over all, her tresses rare,
Which, when, with his desire grown weak,
The Night bent down to kiss her cheek,
Entrapped and held him captive there.
This was Ione; a spirit finer
Ne'er burned to ash its house of clay;
A soul instinct with fire diviner
Ne'er fled athwart the face of day,
And tempted Time with earthly stay.
Her loveliness was not alone
Of face and form and tresses' hue;
For aye a pure, high soul shone through
Her every act: this was Ione.
II.
'TWAS in the radiant summer weather,
And we went wand'ring much together
By wood and lane, Ione and I,
Attracted by the subtle tie
Of common thoughts and common tastes,
Of eyes whose vision saw the same,
And freely granted beauty's claim
Where others found but worthless wastes.
We paused to hear the far bells ringing
Across the distance, sweet and clear. 
We listened to the wild bird's singing
The song he meant for his mate's ear,
And deemed our chance to do so dear.
We loved to watch the warrior Sun,
With flaming shield and flaunting crest,
Go striding down the gory West,
When Day's long fight was fought and won.
And life became a different story;
Where'er I looked, I saw new light.
Earth's self assumed a greater glory,
Mine eyes were cleared to fuller sight.
Then first I saw the need and might
Of that fair band, the singing throng,
Who, gifted with the skill divine,
Take up the threads of life, spun fine,
And weave them into soulful song.
They sung for me, whose passion pressing
My soul, found vent in song nor line.
They bore the burden of expressing
All that I felt, with art's design,
And every word of theirs was mine. 
I read them to Ione, ofttimes,
By hill and shore, beneath fair skies,
And she looked deeply in mine eyes,
And knew my love spoke through their rhymes.
Her life was like the stream that floweth,
And mine was like the waiting sea;
Her love was like the flower that bloweth,
And mine was like the searching bee —
I found her sweetness all for me.
And coined for us a golden day,
And rolled it ringing down life's way
With love's sweet music in its chime.
And laid it open to our sight;
Upon the dimness of its pages,
So long consigned to rayless night,
He shed the glory of his light.
We read them well, we read them long,
And ever thrilling did we see
That love ruled all humanity, —
The master passion, pure and strong.
III.
TO-DAY my skies are bare and ashen,
And bend on me without a beam.
Since love is held the master-passion,
Its loss must be the pain supreme —
And grinning Fate has wrecked my dream.
But pardon, dear departed Guest,
I will not rant, I will not rail;
For good the grain must feel the flail;
There are whom love has never blessed.
I had and have a younger brother,
One whom I loved and love to-day
As never fond and doting mother
Adored the babe who found its way
From heavenly scenes into her day.
Oh, he was full of youth's new wine, —
A man on life's ascending slope,
Flushed with ambition, full of hope;
And every wish of his was mine.
A kingly youth; the way before him
Was thronged with victories to be won; 
so joyous, too, the heavens o'er him
Were bright with an unchanging sun, —
His days with rhyme were overrun.
Toil had not taught him Nature's prose,
Tears had not dimmed his brilliant eyes,
And sorrow had not made him wise;
His life was in the budding rose.
I know not how I came to waken,
Some instinct pricked my soul to sight;
My heart by some vague thrill was shaken, —
A thrill so true and yet so slight,
I hardly deemed I read aright.
As when a sleeper, ign'rant why,
Not knowing what mysterious hand
Has called him out of slumberland,
Starts up to find some danger nigh.
Love is a guest that comes, unbidden,
But, having come, asserts his right;
He will not be repressed nor hidden.
And so my brother's dawning plight
Became uncovered to my sight. 
Some sound-mote in his passing tone
Caught in the meshes of my ear;
Some little glance, a shade too dear,
Betrayed the love he bore Ione.
What could I do? He was my brother,
And young, and full of hope and trust;
I could not, dared not try to smother
His flame, and turn his heart to dust.
I knew how oft life gives a crust
To starving men who cry for bread;
But he was young, so few his days,
He had not learned the great world's ways,
Nor Disappointment's volumes read.
However fair and rich the booty,
I could not make his loss my gain.
For love is dear, but dearer, duty,
And here my way was clear and plain.
I saw how I could save him pain.
And so, with all my day grown dim,
That this loved brother's sun might shine,
I joined his suit, gave over mine,
And sought Ione, to plead for him.
I found her in an eastern bower,
Where all day long the am'rous sun
Lay by to woo a timid flower.
This day his course was well-nigh run,
But still with lingering art he spun
Gold fancies on the shadowed wall.
The vines waved soft and green above,
And there where one might tell his love,
I told my griefs — I told her all!
I told her all, and as she hearkened,
A tear-drop fell upon her dress.
With grief her flushing brow was darkened;
One sob that she could not repress
Betrayed the depths of her distress.
Upon her grief my sorrow fed,
And I was bowed with unlived years,
My heart swelled with a sea of tears,
The tears my manhood could not shed.
The world is Rome, and Fate is Nero,
Disporting in the hour of doom.
But in that awful space of gloom 
I gave no thought but sorrow's room.
All — all was dim within that bower,
What time the sun divorced the day;
And all the shadows, glooming gray,
Proclaimed the sadness of the hour.
She could not speak — no word was needed;
Her look, half strength and half despair,
Told me I had not vainly pleaded,
That she would not ignore my prayer.
And so she turned and left me there,
And as she went, so passed my bliss;
She loved me, I could not mistake —
But for her own and my love's sake,
Her womanhood could rise to this!
My wounded heart fled swift to cover,
And life at times seemed very drear.
My brother proved an ardent lover —
What had so young a man to fear?
He wed Ione within the year. 
No shadow clouds her tranquil brow,
Men speak her husband's name with pride,
While she sits honored at his side —
She is — she must be happy now!
I doubt the course I took no longer,
Since those I love seem satisfied.
The bond between them will grow stronger
As they go forward side by side;
Then will my pains be justified.
Their joy is mine, and that is best —
I am not totally bereft,
For I have still the mem'ry left —
Love stopped with me — a Royal Guest

Empty are the ways, 
Empty are the ways of this land 
And the flowers 
Bend over with heavy heads. 
They bend in vain. 
Empty are the ways of this land 
Where Ione 
Walked once, and now does not walk 
But seems like a person just gone. 

Just because we've torn their statues down,
and cast them from their temples,
doesn't for a moment mean the gods are dead.
Land of Ionia, they love you yet,

their spirits still remember you.
When an August morning breaks upon you
a vigour from their lives stabs through your air;
and sometimes an ethereal and youthful form
in swiftest passage, indistinct,

passes up above your hills. 

That we've broken their statues,
that we've driven them out of their temples,
doesn't mean at all that the gods are dead.
O land of Ionia, they're still in love with you,
their souls still keep your memory. 
When an August dawn wakes over you,
your atmosphere is potent with their life,
and sometimes a young ethereal figure
indistinct, in rapid flight,
wings across your hills. 

That we've broken their statues,

With failing feet and shoulders bowed 
Beneath the weight of happier days, 
He lagged among the heedless crowd, 
Or crept along suburban ways. 
But still through all his heart was young, 
A courage, a pride, a rapture, sprung 
Of the strength and splendour of England's war. 

From ill-requited toil he turned 
To ride with Picton and with Pack, 
Among his grammars inly burned 
To storm the Afghan mountain-track. 
When midnight chimed, before Quebec 
He watched with Wolfe till he morning star; 
At noon he saw from Victory's deck 
The sweep and splendour of England's war. 

Beyond the book his teaching sped, 
He left on whom he taught the trace 
Of kinship with the deathless dead, 
And faith in all the Island race. 
He passed : his life a tangle seemed, 
His age from fame and power was far; 
But his heart was night to the end, and dreamed 
Of the sound and splendour of England's war. 

Little children in beautiful uniforms
Going to primary school with happy mood
Small tricolor flags pined in uniforms
Their smile the prettiest it seemed.

Walking forward to the nearby school
With happy, hope, and enthusiasm
They are the hope of tomorrow
Not only our own country but to the world.

Little children, their celebration
Independence day celebrations in school
The patriotic songs they chants
A pride to hear as a citizen.

Little children the citizens of tomorrow
Their plays and studies are important
Their thoughts and physical strength matters
Through them the country must progress.

Let them get chances to proper study
Let them have valued work experiences
Let there be enough opportunities in future
Through them the world makes itself beautiful. 

Seek not in me the big I capital,
Not yet the little dotted in me seek.
If I have in me any I at all,
'Tis the iota subscript of the Greek.
So small am I as an attention beggar.
The letter you will find me subscript to
Is neither alpha, eta, nor omega,
But upsilon which is the Greek for you. 

There was snow that afternoon covering the road
which twisted toward the secret 
of water, the mysterious surge

of sludge & loam, the living
Mississippi, unlike the rest of the Midwest,

drawing itself through landscape. There was an appointment
     you were keeping 

in Moline: a cheap hotel, booze, a little blow. On the Lower
     East Side, a woman

spills her martini, makes a gesture
In the rear view

suddenly, the car you will always describe as oncoming
must have slipped into a skid

and now, rising up over the bank,
it startles you—that reflection. In Moline

the maid corners the bed, straightens the clean
swirls of snow.  On the road

the car hovering behind you, a witness,
unfortunate & so unlike the audience permitted
the distance of fictions, the artifice

of plot. And worse, of course, the law

of cause & effect: I looked up,
it started to fall.  You must attach

subject to verb, must say
I saw, and did, in your rear view, the car you’d thought
     nothing of,

the gray sedan lifting slowly from the common snow,
turning, and the accident
always there, about to happen.

A gentle dream
With dry fingertips 
A thirsty tongue
Where are the elevated ones? 

A peasant left
The king did not arrive
His arrival delayed by Nomami*
If only Gazi* was still alive


Where are the knowledge seekers? 
Where are the loving hands? 
Where are the symbols of healing, 
That take me when I’m out of tune
And teach me all their melodies? 

Son, question your father, 
Daughter, question your mother
Let them teach you our culture.

Dare you smirk when I speak? 
Dare you walk away from me? 
The day I finally awake
All cheerful parties; you will hate
All sacred rituals; you will embrace! 

When I look upon our ancestry
I see the change we have become

But when I hear a voice of poetry
It fills me with joyful pride
I hear the spring time coming
Singing with a diversity of voices: 

One says, "ntyilo-ntyilo"*
The other says, "I told you so"

The renaissance of Africa
My people's awakening! ! ! 


Nomami*- the which that lures the king to her lair

Gazi*- The healer and blood relative to the king

Nyilo-ntyilo*- The sound made by birds(especially the summer flocks)I cringe (or is it shiver?) 
every time I hear the word

motherland. I’d like to think
my blatant internationalism

foments the reaction. But is it 
the latent fear forever held 

by you, my pays natal, the terror
of un retour? I’d like to

remember the scent of your
jasmine, the ooze of

your pomegranate’s juice. But
the torture in your prisons

the sadism in your leaders’ eyes
pervade the reminiscence. I’m

drawn to the romance 
of your poets, memorialised

so lyrically in the sepulchral shrines
of Shiraz. The tales of turbaned 

bards drinking the forbidden,
singing the heady praises of Love 

fill me with the desire 
to love you, but the ubiquity 

of sub-machineguns, 
the vigilance of the Guards

repel. And I’ve been repulsed
across the globe. I’ve been 

made thoroughly homeless. Blame
Islam? The historical disaster

of a revolution without vision?
Anti-colonialism without

the aim of ending the slavery
of the soul to the superiority

of belief? Or, as always, ‘them’:
the Americans, greased up

for devouring your oil? Blame?
No, I’m not at all interested

in constructivism. I’ll accuse,
as they say in my surrogate patrie,

‘until the cows come home’. Why
the pretentious reliance on 

Italicised French words and Anglo
slang? My mother-tongue

also terrifies. Once the language of
no doubt sublime poets and ghazals;

the discourse of submission
and hatred during my childhood. 

Remember your theologians
interpreting reality? I don’t want to.

I don’t know if my psyche
can handle many more nightmares.

Let it suffice that I can recall
the purges, the bruises, the glow

of the incinerations. I’ll have 
you know that I now fathom what

you had in mind for me: a plot
among the ‘martyrs’

in the Heaven of Zahra
mausoleum in Tehran. Now

I hear you’re armed 
to the teeth to continue your 

infernal war against
timeless nemeses. Your wealthy

still holiday in Europe and plan
cosmetic surgeries. Your clerics

still issue death warrants
against ‘apostates’ and ‘infidels’. I’m

almost dead in the quicksand
of the deserts of foreignness and

exile. Do I even begin to dare
contemplate a return

to the makeshift terrains
of memory? To the localities

that cultivated my senses
of placement, to the orchards

that I wandered as a bored
child? The people are mostly dead.

The remaining form a diaspora
of regret and disillusionment. I’m,

as I said, not a positivist. Only
a fickle and shuddering ghost

rejuvenated and alarmed
by the mention of the word

motherland. 


Viewing ourselves through the mirror of capricious arrogance, we see reflecting, the decadent hypocrites we've allowed this Nation to become. Democrats blaming Republicans, Republicans finger-pointing Democrats. Fact is, we've all sat on our complicit asses, passively watching bullshit unfold.

Our current state of affairs didn't just happen unassisted, we as a People effectively caused its existence through collective acts of moral and fiscal abdication. 

National parks are assets of nature
Of country and the people they inherits
They are to be saved from encroachment
The coming generation's property it is! 

The national parks at Iravikulam
Of India in Kerala
Most beautiful and panoramic views
The highest peak of Anamudi there! 

The ghats and steep gradient hills
Green nature, and mist valleys
The sholays and natural springs
The murmuring sounds of water falls, 
Iravikulam most important for tourists.

The protected mountain goats
Endangered species now well cared
Their capabilities to run along hills
The hills of such great heights
A scenery that is so happy to observe.

Iravikulam the wild forests
Where man meets the wilderness in beauty
The trees, wild flowering plants
The wild life including Elephants and monkeys
How beautiful Iravikulam as a national park! 

The settlements and colonies of tribal people
Around the Iravikulam National park
Their respectable values, and culture
Most important and supported by all
The rich heritage of folk lore and customs
Their development a strong concern.

Marayur the great sandal wood tree forest
A pride of the country as a whole
The stone age monuments and umbrellas
The memories of heritage from such long history
Iravikulam most important in its natural harmony. 

Written for the Art Autograph during the Irish Famine, 



Heartsome Ireland, winsome Ireland,
 Charmer of the sun and sea,
Bright beguiler of old anguish,
 How could Famine frown on thee?

As our Gulf-Stream, drawn to thee-ward,
 Turns him from his northward flow,
And our wintry western headlands
 Send thee summer from their snow,

Thus the main and cordial current
 Of our love sets over sea, --
Tender, comely, valiant Ireland,
Songful, soulful, sorrowful Ireland, --
 Streaming warm to comfort thee. 

Oh, Erin sweet Erin, your cup overflows

Celts came from the east many cent'ries ago
Through Europe they traveled in search of a home
Their Milesian kings wed to David's blood line
By a son of Aaron and Divine design
To the Emerald Isle, where some are today

Oh, Erin sweet Erin, your cup overflows

Down thy valleys, Ireland, Ireland,
Down thy valleys green and sad,
Still thy spirit wanders wailing,
Wanders wailing, wanders mad.

Long ago that anguish took thee,
Ireland, Ireland, green and fair,
Spoilers strong in darkness took thee,
Broke thy heart and left thee there.

Down thy valleys, Ireland, Ireland,
Still thy spirit wanders mad;
All too late they love that wronged thee,
Ireland, Ireland, green and sad. 

WHILE tyrants rule the land,
Beneath the Irish skies;
While e’er the iron hand
Upon our people lies;
While sons are driven forth
In other lands to dwell,
Still in the South and North
Old Ireland will rebel!
Rebel, rebel!
Old Ireland will rebel!

While fanlike from below,
And pale against the skies,
That light of shame—the glow
Of burning homes—shall rise;
While hot indignant tears
From Irish hearts shall swell:—
Be it a thousand years,
Old Ireland will rebel!
Rebel, rebel!
Old Ireland will rebel!

Until the tyrant’s rod
Shall broken be in twain,
And on the dear old sod
Blest freedom treads again;
Or till our masters learn
To rule our country well,
The fires of hate shall burn!—
Old Ireland will rebel!
Rebel, rebel!
Old Ireland will rebel

One misty evening, one another's guide, 
We two were groping down a Malvern side 
The last wet fields and dripping hedges home. 
There came a moment of confusing lights, 
Such as according to belief in Rome 
Were seen of old at Memphis on the heights 
Before the fragments of a former sun 
Could concentrate anew and rise as one. 
Light was a paste of pigment in our eyes. 
And then there was a moon and then a scene 
So watery as to seem submarine; 
In which we two stood saturated, drowned. 
The clover-mingled rowan on the ground 
Had taken all the water it could as dew, 
And still the air was saturated too, 
Its airy pressure turned to water weight. 
Then a small rainbow like a trellis gate, 
A very small moon-made prismatic bow, 
Stood closely over us through which to go. 
And then we were vouchsafed a miracle 
That never yet to other two befell 
And I alone of us have lived to tell. 
A wonder! Bow and rainbow as it bent, 
Instead of moving with us as we went 
(To keep the pots of gold from being found), 
It lifted from its dewy pediment 
Its two mote-swimming many-colored ends 
And gathered them together in a ring. 
And we stood in it softly circled round 
From all division time or foe can bring 
In a relation of elected friends. 

Introduction: We don't really think deep enough about 'What A Poetry Actually Is', the obvious question which we all know but don't think how to really elaborate on. We mostly see the story, depth and the purpose it delivers. Well, here's one a little bit different this time. 


Poetry is the reflection of our lives like in the mirror, 
It is something we can relate to and share.
It's our memories written in jumbled words, 
It's like a song, with a meaning it holds.

A mere idea of our mystical lives, 
Expressed in a way from deep inside
A way which only the heart can see, 
A place where the eyes get cold-feet

The earnest truth and the sweetest lies, 
It's all the irony that makes poetry so alive. 

I was born in Brooklyn
had an Irish Catholic Nanny, 
who left me after the depression

Oh Mrs. 

Mac Donald
sweet smelling beefy arms
and mammoth bosoms
how could you
grow up and leave me, 

I remember  when 
my humpty dunpty fell on the floor
I screamed mamma help her, 
everyone roared and laughed
she got up and hugged me, i stopped crying

the next day she took me to church
prayed for grace among
the soft cushioned pews
dark red wine carpets, 
painted windows and smooth statues
she would not let me kneel

mamma was angry with her
my father's synagogue was different
always so cold and austere

when I was fifteen, ahe came to visit
but i was too busy playing baseball
still angry because she grew up
and went away


Goldsmith wrote Deserted Village, 
Now again reduced to tillage; 
Once happiest village of the plain, 
Place now you look for it in vain; 
There but one man he doth make rich, 
And hundreds struggle in the ditch; 

"Ill fare the land to many ills a prey
Where wealth accumelates but men decay
 

His honest Vicar of Wakefield
Forever he will pleasure yield. 

I believe that a young woman
Is standing in a circle of lions
In the other side of the sky.

In a little while I must carry her the flowers
Which only fade here; and she will not cry
If my hands are not very full.

±

Fiery antlers toss within the forests of heaven
And ocean’s plaintive towns
Echo the tread of celestial feet.
O the beautiful eyes stare down-
What have we done that we are blessed?

±

And all the animals are asleep again
In their separate caves.
Hairy bellies distended with their kill.
Culture blubbering in and out
Like the breath of a stranded fish.
Crucifixion in wax. The test-tube messiahs.
Immaculate fornication under the smoking walls
Of a dead world.
I dig for my death
in this thousand-watt dungheap.
There isn’t even enough clean air.
To die in.
O blood-bearded destroyer!

In other times. 
(soundless barges float
down the rivers of death)
In another heart
These crimes may not flower-
What have we done that we are blessed?
What have we damned that we are blinded?

±

Now, with my seven-holed head open
On the air whence comes a fabulous mariner
To take his place among the spheres—
And the mariner who is sheep—I fold
Upon myself like a bird over flames. Then
All my nightbound juices sing. Snails
Pop out of unexpected places and the long
light lances of waterbulls plunge
into the green crotch of my native land.
Eyes peer out of the seaweed that gently sways
Above the towers and salt gates of a lost world.

±

On the other side of the sky
A young woman is standing
In a circle of lions—
The young woman who is dream
And the lions which are death. 

By the wayside
iron in hand
presses salts of her oceanic eyes
as passes life's flowing tide. 

Iron man

Praise not me
But people who are free
To install a person
Or unseat powerful people with reasons

The nation was deprived
And starved
Of weapons and preparedness
There were stiff challenges

The country needed iron man
To project as one nation
Even though other leaders tried to block the progress
He was the single man to face

Allegations and blockade could mar nothing
But the sun shown light despite being
Overshadowed by clouds
Their words were hollow and voice not so loud 

He had nothing to collect
As way of bribe of favor to act
Only people were his main concern
In real time, the table was turned

Whole of the nation acknowledges his guts
As he has stillness of mind and put
The might of nation before enemy
Even though he is prepared to face the situation stormy


I have so easily accepted these pulley ropes
hoisting my self's achievements for all to see.

Fames' Face
applauds Ambition's ends

and I am promised
to be uplifted
to Security and Prosperity; 
 
Potentialities and Promises
Possibilities gleaming, 
 
Glowing Future-Beacons
calling for Hard Work
Sacrifice and Ideals

to deliver me and mine, 
 
where Deliverance
sits with Happiness
and Contentment
and presumably Love
and Friends too.

A lot here recommends.

But the Pulley Ropes
remind me
simultaneously, 
cruelly, 
paradoxically
of the zero sum-
one up for me
often is one down for thee, 
 
Iron Math and Society, 

algebraically; 
gainless goals for me
pains for thee
nothing is the total
algebraically.
 
Iron Math Indeed.

Competition's seeds
equal
I win
you lose
equally.

Sad outcome for you
and less clearly, 
also
for me.

The Competitive Engine roars 
and devours the Participants
who, in riding Success's Whirlwind
pay the Conductor's Fee in Ideals Foregone.
 
We grapple with Horizons
cut from Competitive Cloth 
ignorant  of other
Choices
Yet Unseen. 

I am not made of iron stuff
So many times hurt by simple bluff
People try to cheat me by sheer lies
I take no notes or care for such follies

It pinches me from deep heart
People have made it as deceiving art
They use it frequently one or another pretext
Make the target one by one and wait for next

They long for one day strategy
Enjoy today and don’t think much or worry
Let people feel anything about deception
They are very much afraid of hostile reception 

How can you be that illogical with human behavior? 
We are here to act for the humanity and as savior
How can we go on making endless lies for no cause? 
That too continuously unabated without any pause

I am totally disillusioned with such tendency
It is on tremendous rise with unstoppable frequency
I see no end to such intentions in near future
I too realize it as human weakness and fail to assure

I can’t term it total sin
But generally it is observed and seen
We laugh at people’s flight
Add more woes and make the situation very tight


When a woman that is blind
can see
what a man with sight can not

Sorrow poison is dark as rain, 
Love Elixir is bright as the sunshine.
Between the two you have: 
The passionate Romance 
Between Life and Death.  .  
That will forever dance
Hand in Hand


Life is taken tripped from period of time, 
but refuse to say i have achieved many miles 
because not knowing be oneself takes exra time.

Take aback of story is simply familiar.

A plot of complex life is huge than acres of land, 
but gaze the dream and chase that dream in mind, 
yet it didn't show a shadow of possession in hand.

Take steps of aspiration is broaden.

Valour is the pride from the womb it started to be proud, 
that giving spine is earning a lifetime victory, 
and making the life aid to the mother who gives mastery.

Take beyond inspiration is proven.

Soul is trancendence to human and paramount to being alive, 
and living things made to create behaviour annoying sometimes, 
yet reflection exemplifies differences that states human life.

Take all mishaps is success to homo sapiens. 

it's not easy being ill, 
especially for those around you.
with each new breath you might
cause alarm, mental harm

being ill one must fulfill
expectations and patient stigmas
being in pain or suffering in silence
play the part of martyr or nearly so

wince, grimly sigh and gasp
moan and groan to fit the scene

taking medicines has a protocol
care and pedantic, diligent and dilettante
show some aversion and weariness
lest some say you enjoy pill popping
of substances that contain more than relief

patient and spectator, relative or friend
must have a bond of credibility
so that empathy and sympathy 
soar in their company

once it is beleived you are sick
you must keep a level of trust
that you are suffering
to exact commiseration unstinting

they will say you always kept a stiff upper lip, 
it's so important to make the correct impression


The whirlwind of emotions
Is dragging me to the quicksand of mope
Where shaded emptiness
Is filling the landscape of the world
With vague feelings
And rocky thoughts

Where I cannot give voice
To my fear and longing
And questions I ask
Are very hard to answer

Where tragic facts
And the chain of despair
Covers my lonely island
And I feel drowning
In the valley of darkness

Where ironic twist of life
Is vanishing my moments
And filling emptiness
Of unspeakable frustration

Where I cannot release
My soul from illusions
Because my body is heavy
With the fatigue of travel
Battered by the storm
. 

Always, sweetheart,
Carry into your room the blossoming boughs of cherry,
Almond and apple and pear diffuse with light, that very
Soon strews itself on the floor; and keep the radiance of spring
Fresh quivering; keep the sunny-swift March-days waiting
In a little throng at your door, and admit the one who is plaiting
Her hair for womanhood, and play awhile with her, then bid her depart.
 
   A come and go of March-day loves  
   Through the flower-vine, trailing screen;
     A fluttering in of doves.
   Then a launch abroad of shrinking doves
   Over the waste where no hope is seen
   Of open hands:  
     Dance in and out  
Small-bosomed girls of the spring of love,
With a bubble of laughter, and shrilly shout  
Of mirth; then the dripping of tears on your glove. 

An arid daylight shines along the beach
Dried to a grey monotony of tone,
And stranded jelly-fish melt soft upon
The sun-baked pebbles, far beyond their reach
Sparkles a wet, reviving sea. Here bleach
The skeletons of fishes, every bone
Polished and stark, like traceries of stone,
The joints and knuckles hardened each to each.
And they are dead while waiting for the sea,
The moon-pursuing sea, to come again.
Their hearts are blown away on the hot breeze.
Only the shells and stones can wait to be
Washed bright. For living things, who suffer pain,
May not endure till time can bring them ease. 

Life becomes quite vague
When parents bury those who
Should have buried them.


(**A Senryu)A lovely creature
But his fangs caused his demise
Saber tooth Tiger. 

The twentieth century has often fooled us.
We've been squeezed in by falsehood as by taxes.
The breath of life has denuded our ideas
as quickly as it strips a dandelion.

As boys fall back on biting sarcasm, 
so we rely for safe defense
on an irony not too suppressed, 
not too naked either.

It has served as a wall or dam
to shield us against a flood of lies, 
and hands have laughed as they applauded, 
and feet sniggered as they marched.

They could write about us, and we've allowed
them to make movies of this scribbled trash, 
but we have reserved the right
to treat all this with quiet irony.

In our contempt we felt superior.
All this is so, but probing deeper, 
irony, instead of acting as our savior, 
you have become our murderer.

We're cautious, hypocritical in love.
and our present seems no different from
our past, so cunningly disguised.

Through life we scurry. In history, 
like any Faust, we've been prejudged.
With Mephistophelian smile, irony, 
like a shadow, dogs our every step.

In vain we try to dodge the shadow.
The paths in front, behind, are blocked.
Irony, to you we've sold our soul, 
receiving no Margaret in return.

You have buried us alive.
Bitter knowledge has made us powerless, 
and our weary irony ironically
has turned against ourselves.


that applies to all 
under the sun
from which no one can run

As a child
You have plenty of time and energy
But no money! 

As an adult
You have plenty of money and energy 
But no time! 

As you grow old
You have plenty of time and money
But no energy! 

So its better to act wise now
And welcome every morning with a 'wow'
Fully utilise your present 
And rejoice every moment

This is the thumb rule
Just play it cool

IRONY OF PEACE


Seer says ‘arms dealer’
May not be healer
Adjudged innocent killer

Maker of metal detector
Bombs disposal kits
Scanning X-ray machine
Close circuit TV
Will lose business of billions
If explosion cease
People will nourish 
Melody of nightingale
Rosy fragrance
Refreshing cool breeze                       

Made of clay
Intellect display
Exporter of arms
How shrewd, talk of balms

Never peace be in their vision
Dollars and pounds are reason
Create chaos, reap season.

When a man establishes peace within his heart  
He would have a treaty of peace for global chart.  
All evils in the mind appear on the face  
Are the stigmas the people can easily trace.

Vultures keep their eyes on orders
Saints and sages of disorders
Preach kick-back and commissions
Far away from human compassions
Sighs, tears, blood, toll and death 
Are their sources of wealth. 
 
Follow strategies to uproot peace
And give services of lips to please.

Would that global leaders
Understand their heinous
Crime, cruelty and poisonous
Traits and work for integrity
Nation’s sovereignty
Inspire nationalism
Propagate humanism
With their charismatic power

Aligarh-(U. 

P.)Homes became the home theaters 
Home grown children separate identities
Mutual concern and friendship is losing
Somewhere a missing link it feels.

Homes the beautiful home theater
The posh furniture and amenities large
The systems of comforts in electronics
Life is easier than yesterdays a fact.

But is it all comforts we asks ourselves
The mutual respect and love missing there
Where mutual concerns are no longer exist
The members of family in separate compartments.
The irony of world, the modern world continues.

-

I once promised so much to you, 
and I can give you nothing-
                            I made you poor.
I promised you us in the blue, in the foliage, 
on green grass, 
               head to head, 
cool cherries on each cheek, 
and tranquillity that smells lazily of hay.
We wanted to come to Irpen, 
                           languid and half asleep, 
here on that precipice or tree stump, 
the exquisite fugitive wrote
of gillyflowers and forest
                          when he fled here. 
But today there is no escaping, 
as from a tribunal, 
                   out of shame for history.
Clouds burst endlessly, 
                       ferociously, 
washing away all hope of peace and comfort
for you and me, 
               in the blue and foliage, 
on green grass, 
               head to head. 
The toadies swill their borscht, 
                                their bellies growling.
A prominent critic approaches
                             who barely reaches my shoulders, 
but nevertheless he pats me on them: 
'Right now you’re just how
                          I’ve always wanted you.
You haven’t swallowed the bait of flattery, 
and on civic issues you’ve come out strong. '
In your eyes I see contempt and shame.
By his praise
             I’m destroyed for you.
Don’t believe it-
                  I’m not that way, 
                                   I’m not that way, 
                                                    I’m not that way! 
I’m simply smashed to splinters, 
                                like a raft in a flood.
That critic lies.
                 Don’t listen to nonsense! 
He just likes the chips that fly off me, 
                                        but not me! 
But you say: 
            'No, 
                you’re just that way.
You’re not a raft, 
                  but the pampered fruit of the age, 
everyone’s favourite, 
                     a model son. '
and your beautiful glance is unbearably cruel.

You say, 
        the epoch is a blood mother to me.
Could a mother maim
                   and break? 
Like a horse, 
             they harnessed me with a collar, 
and beat me with a whip, 
                        grinning to boot.
But today they lavishly pass me gingerbread.
Every piece scars me
                    like a whip.
The raw autumn mist clings like a sucking swamp.
The toadies gloomily play dominoes.
The countryside hungers, 
                        woods become scarce, 
yet cosmonauts are flying to the heavens! 
I’ve impoverished you even more terribly-
             I’ve impoverished you with my soul.
Forgive me, that I promised you so much.


Nothing hurts me more than my own thoughts
Intelligentsias all over world have offered explanations and always sought
The adoption of whimsical ways to come out of jugglery
It is nothing but state of mind and simple misery

It is known fact that we have temporary refuge
The problems may be more but we make it to seem huge
The ups and down may make it more enterprising
As life it self may be thrilling and promising

If I had poor parenting and no sources
What is use of its remembrance and curse? 
It may make you reasonable of course
But after all they are dominant and driving force

Human mind works at faster space
Some of us take special pride in race
Color, cast and creed also occupy most of the time
Who then has to be blamed for it anytime? 

We tend to loose few steps for futile adventures
That doesn’t show way or completely ensure
Rather it pushed us to the brink
Where we can only hope of losing ship or sink

The human mind may be called think tank
Where millions of ideas invade and sink
Some may take to useful conclusion
Rest may not warrant even inclusion

I have tried to struggle for temporary objects
It has found unfavorable and some times rejected
But that has not pushed me to an absolute end
As it provided many means to amend

Thoughts are nice to cultivate mind
It has unique way to explore and find
What we need to emphasize is its proper application
It must have some reasoning and direct relations


Suffering in silence
Is
An irreparable harm
That
Captures your mind 'n heart
With
Aches and pain
And
Keeps your wounds open
To be filled with
More and more
Hurts and agony.  

I HAVE been in the meadows all the day
And gathered there the nosegay that you see
Singing within myself as bird or bee
When such do field-work on a morn of May.
But, now I look upon my flowers, decay
Has met them in my hands more fatally
Because more warmly clasped,--and sobs are free
To come instead of songs. What do you say,
Sweet counsellors, dear friends ? that I should go
Back straightway to the fields and gather more ?
Another, sooth, may do it, but not I !
My heart is very tired, my strength is low,
My hands are full of blossoms plucked before,
Held dead within them till myself shall die. 

All we search for in life, 
All we yearn to be, 
Is irreplaceable in time, 
A one and only.

So it hurts more than ever
To hear him say, 
I can find a new one like you, 
In only a few days.

As I sit here and wonder, 
How could I do this again, 
Let myself care, 
When I know I won't win? 

I cry as I debate, 
How will it end, 
Will it stop right out, 
Or fade in the wind? 

All I can hope, 
Is one day to find, 
That man who will make me
Irreplaceable in time. 

Devastation and Chaos on the land
Loss of lives, loss of Future
Warriors lost their souls. 

The sky is always changing –
Can't it settle down? 
Shades of blue, then reddy hue, 
Puffs of grey and white; 
And then it's bloody night! 
At least I see a smattering 
Of twinkly little things, 
A silver globe occasionally 
Which admittedly it brings
A sort of pleasant feeling, 
Warming to the soul, 
But overall it's so annoying –
Irritatingly droll! 

















































 

















Sky sky bloody sky, bloody sky sky
Sky sky bloody sky, sky bloody sky
Sky bloody sky bloody sky sky sky
Sky bloody sky bloody sky sky sky


I sat motionless after visit to an old home, 
Sultry place and no visits and stay lone, 
With all the agony of pains remain alone, 
Reminds us of journey for self and only one, 

Their woes and tales tore me apart, 
Life was not smooth but in part, 
People travels in jet but some still in cart, 
Project self as noble and try looking smart, 

Life seemed to me so hollow, 
Found examples life to follow, 
No joy, no happiness but only sorrow, 
What to think of bright tomorrow? 

I may pray for their happy and fine end, 
Wish them all happy life and flowers send, 
Some old couples did not succumb and bend, 
Living in hope children may make amend, 

Life once swept by devastating flood, 
Even one’s own harass and thirsty for blood, 
How to feel charm and end so good, 
Some even faced starving without food, 

Life is not that dull or full of comedy, 
Events try against and result in tragedy, 
Sometimes turn so ugly and bloody, 
Your own kith and kin act as somebody, 

It is shame on us and on humanity, 
Why to blame self and also divinity? 
We ignore good just before our vicinity, 
We live in world and not in infinity



Can we get a graceful treasure like him
in this earth? 

It is enough if said Siva Chithambaram once! 
.  

Should any other moral merit to be done 
to attain heavenly bliss? 

We listened to what is said in legend 
.  

that mean three persons of degrading jobs

.  

to Gopalakrishnan singing Sabapathy

If cupid really was a man
with a cute little dart
who shot you with them, 
right through your heart; 

Why is it that men
are the last ones to say
that they want to be with you
each and every day.

I don't understand it, 
how could he be a guy? 
Did no one ever think, 
or stop to question why? 

Have you ever heard of a man
from all of the lands, 
that welcomed you in
with wide open hands.

I know a few out there
think that he's really cute, 
but just dress him up in a well tailored suit

and you'll see that he'll change
be more distant than before.
He'll probably leave you 
standing by his door.

Now don't get me wrong
I'm all for love instead of war; 
but how do you get him 
and keep him from wanting more? 

If he's so damn cute
then he's sure to see; 
that there's more to life
than just being with me.

He'll shoot all the women
with his candy coated darts, 
and they'll melt like chocolate
with a marshmellow heart.

He'd be loved and adored
and worshipped by them all.
and the more he smiles
the harder they fall.

I can already hear you
complaining to me.
That there are lots of men out there
who will love me for me, 

but i just want to know
If the Greeks were stupid.
How could they say
that a man could be cupid? 


'Democracy'Is Education A Business 

Is education a business 
Or should it even be? 

This is a question, which has always bothered me! 
What is the purpose of educating students? 

Should we pay more to teachers 
Or could we do something even more prudent? 

If you listen to some administrators the problem is money 
When asked they will say, ' There simply is not enough to have any! ' 


If this were truly the problem the cure could be 
Raise our already high taxes to what they really should be. 

However, money may not be solely the answer 
The question moreover they said coldly may actually be, 
' We simply aren't teaching the students enough, 
They are not passing the tests! ' 

To which the brilliant educational bureaucrat sadly laments.' We need more money to teach to the Test! ' 

Remember John Dewey, the man who organized the library, he also lend theories to straighten up our schools. 

His applied theories were successful, 
His students succeeded, 
But was it his message that we heeded? 

Dewey taught us that if we taught for learning, 
We wouldn't look back, 
Instead we would look forward, 
And every press on, everyone succeeded all over the town. 

You see this is learning, just plain and simple! 

Lower the taxes, 
Lower the tests, 
Raise the bar of learning, 
That is truly how our students learn best

Someone politely commented and wrote
Total freedom is unwarranted and joke
It is absolute freedom of expression
One may live till death with this obsession

Freedom is to breathe in free space
No cast, color, creed discrimination in any case 
No one to run after you or chase
All deliberation in earnestness in single phase

Curtailment of freedom sometimes may be working favorably
But can’t be taken for granted as it helped you suitably
Some opinion can be experienced in isolation
But it must be ruled out rightly out of question

If some one is put behind bars for some reasons
He may have alternate options as person
How to spend or utilize the time in prison? 
Even if hands are not tied with chains

Many may find divine experience in cell
Something to reveal or divinely to tell
Someone may guide from unknown direction
So as to enable and think about right action

Sort out some confusions prevailing in mind
Gentle touch to humanity and solutions to find
As a prisoner behind bars, it pave some opportune time
To think positively and praiseworthy sometimes

Well it can’t be said with many of same truth
Only visionaries forecast and needs no proof
For them may only be needed single roof
As it may be ideal to remain aloof

* inspired by Salvador Dil*O mother who sips sweetened liquors!
Look down at the child on your breast;
Think, think of the rough path before him,
And ask yourself then, 'Is it best?
Shall I foster a love for this poison,
Instil the thirst into his veins?
In the fountain he seeks at my bosom
Sow the rank seeds of death, grief, and pains?


'Shall I give him the thirst of the drunkard,
Bequeath him the weapons of crime?
Can we look for a glass of pure water
Dipped up from a fountain of slime?
Can we look for brave men, strong and noble,
Where the parents drink poison for food?
When the body and soul are corrupted,
Can we look for the works to be good?'


Oh! think of the future before him!
There are perils you cannot remove.
Yet this, the great highway of sorrow-
Oh! guard him from this with your love.
There are rough paths enough in the future
For the feet of the child on your breast;
And lower the glass you are lifting,
And ask yourself, then, 'Is it best.


'Is it Democracy

Is it democracy
When a ballot is sold  for
A few hundred rupees
A free meal, or a bottle of country liquor? 

Is it democracy
If after gaining free Government
For sixty-nine years
Majority can not read and write
And at election time
Wooed to voting booths
With tall promise?  

What meaning it has
For a country poor
Whose stomach burns
out of hunger
Or for that farmer
Who commits suicide
As he can not pay back Bank loans.If democracy stands  for
Liberty, equality and justice
I think we are far way behind.  

Let us work to make it meaningful
Where freedom means free mind
Ballot is not sold
Equality is not in name sake
Equal opportunity to all in true sense    

Let the elections be fought for human values
Where not ballot, but life counts. 

Is it that difficult to smile at some one? 
Do we consider it very hard and troublesome? 
This is only thing we have in abundance
Give a sincere try and take a life chance

You won’t suffer any reprisal
You will find many surprises on spring’s arrival
Nature may adopt different stance with good look
Nature lovers may find good stuff to write in heir book

If you look at someone with smile
It will generate lots of love for a while
The person may be overwhelmed with joy
There may be so much wetness in relation to enjoy

He will be overjoyed to receive such gesture
He may start guessing about new future
Why one should smile at somebody for nothing? 
It has lots of effects to generate for something

How do you feel at receiving little smile from leader? 
How does one feel at receiving thanks as reader? 
It is considered as fine gesture and simple gift
You may find complete and attitudinal shift

Nations at war can be brought a negotiating table
What can be achieved with hard stance even if we are able? 
Exchange of little pleasantries with smile can change climate
We can bring about change even if it is late 

We should only responsibly behave
Love can create congenial atmosphere
Everybody should feel happy without any fear

It is expected that everybody should succeed
There is good hope and urgent need
It may not bring immediate change
Love can change and smoothly arrange

Love and smile can completely alter the scene
It has tremendous scope for the magic to be seen
Love at first sight can be felt by little smile
It has power and strength to take you for an extra mile

Think of a plight where there is complete absence of harmony
You can’t think of situation where you always face the situation very thorny
You got to think of powerful weapon to be used at
It is like rolling ball to be thrown at and freely set

You can’t hate a person with broad or little smile
Your eyes may speak of kind feeling for w while
It may send some quick signals for conciliation
Old enmity may disappear if tried for reconciliation 

In olden days Olive branch was sent with roses
It was some kind of bold initiative for the trusts to repose
We sometimes find the smiling faces with rare combination
It is the smile coupled with desire results into culmination


What is it about society
That resents authority? 
There needs to be structure
Or chaos would rule; 
Certain factions defy the law -
They live without rules, 
They do as they please, 
Wreak havoc in the world; 
Conscience does not guide them, 
Right or wrong the same -
Without regret,  they stand alone
And answer to no man; 
Destruction is their motive -
Death, mutilation, pain 
Their playing cards, 
The joker is wild; 
Spawn of the devil? 
What turns one child to darkness
And another to the light? 
Products of environment -
Reflections of love or neglect? 
And could you ever love enough
To change the tide 
From bad to good, 
To save a soul

Is it ever too late? 


 was in rage and unable to control
He is the only son and not responding call
Totally ignorant about studies and failure
I am worried about his studies and future 

This kind of event is rare in any household
Where wife leaves home to be free from fold
Not because of any differences but of poverty 
How come one man can bear such pain and feel pity? 

I work hard day time to look after children 
I feel sad and lonely when look at them even 
They are without proper care and attention
All likely factors to spoil the kids without any mention 

I felt so bad when learnt about bad company 
Son was acting careless and moving with many
Irresponsible friends and neglecting school
He was now spoiled character and fool

'Dear son' we got to move with rest of the people
Stay calm with studies and not to invite any trouble
He may stare at me and pay no attention to what I intended
As if he was broken with mom's departure and offended 

With all my daily advice, he was broken into pieces
Life was abnormal for him and not at ease
He decided to end life abruptly one day 
Closed the door and preferred poison in foolish way 

We were not in knowledge and very much concerned 
Whole of house smelt bad odor and belief strengthened 
He had committed suicide and landed us all in trouble
This was tragic end for all of us who had so much to struggle

I am taken to cell for five years imprisonment 
For making no move to improve upon with severe comment
I am charged with heavy harassment to boy 
What else could have been done by me than to annoy? 

How much father can expect from promising children? 
They are like garden flowers and ascended from heaven 
I love and could struggle more for their welfare 

Everybody say I'm down to earth.
My explanation.
Miss Gravity works at my place. 

is it just a joke to them 
making me feel like shit
making me feel like i dont belong
just because i dont like mindless music 
just because i dont like putting gum inside a friends locker
just because i dont like starting trouble
just because i dont steal
just because i dont steal! 
who are they to say i dont fit in
who are they to say that i dont belong 
their no one 
they dont belong


Using the poetry which teachers, teach book-reading, 
is it not for the child
and in trust you adjust to they their rhythm of reach
each is temperate, 
sunny or mild and some dark make you smile it seems.
Rolling like thunder, 
streams flow unexplained to the sea, is each.
And working together from different
each familial condition.
Theirs is a pulley, 
you will pull as they push at the center
this your center in order to dance on the rhythm and rhyme
you the teacher it leads them on like thus, 
watching the sun as it shines, 'it is nature to us, they are it..
Children of art, playing your parts, 
gifted are these of from some whom can't see
for these are but they, 
thy gift to you.
These their worlds entirely from a seed made by you.
Perhaps from the river of life, comes each for you
small at the start, sprout up and out, you their poetry.
In rearranged order are such they their words like chimes of the wind
their minds changed to each verse is poetry, 
to read the small mind in it/it is as fluent, 
as the equipment inside of they which by you, the makers of the technology
the spring of terminology
and thine understanding from this is each your child, in the child, 
although motive is given by you.
If you inspect the method of using the differences of they, 
variations which are you, 
They can't being you, but help themselves
all smile at you. 

Is it possible
That so high debate,
So sharp, so sore, and of such rate,
Should end so soon and was begun so late?
Is it possible?

Is it possible
So cruel intent,
So hasty heat and so soon spent,
From love to hate, and thence for to relent?
Is it possible?

Is it possible
That any may find
Within one heart so diverse mind,
To change or turn as weather and wind?
Is it possible?

Is it possible
To spy it in an eye
That turns as oft as chance on die,
The truth whereof can any try?
Is it possible?

It is possible
For to turn so oft,
To bring that lowest which was most aloft,
And to fall highest yet to light soft:
It is possible.

All is possible
Whoso list believe.
Trust therefore first, and after preve,
As men wed ladies by licence and leave.
All is possible. 

Is it time? 
To look inside and maybe fade away-
Where it will end I cannot say-
Through the whispers of soft dreams-
That rides high on clouds of the silence of the night.
It’s always been a question of the mind

Did I walk through the mist of unattainable dreams? 
Only to be turned away with the morning tide.
The dreams and hopes I once had-
Magnificent and all so beautiful-
Just like those sandcastles standing on the beach. 
Only to be washed away-Notwithstanding the obvious and comforting
Exceptions (exceptions die hard, don't they?)  
The tycoons of luxury are not so different from
Those operating in any other market segment.

In the globalized economy, where the smart ones learn
Quickly how to circumvent the rules (if any) , that products
Are weapons or food, health or human flesh, matters little: 
The selfish pursuit of profit substantially always wins.

All of them live in the enchanted but fake world of 
Finance -a world where profits often come through the
Suffering/ needs/ weaknesses of other living beings and
No question is raised about those who are forced to sell
Their labor (or even themselves)   just to survive.

What matters is the growth of wealth of a tiny
Minority. Everything else is an annoying surplus of
Little -if any- relevance.

Therefore goose feathers -torn off of the living flesh-
Fill luxury duvets, packaged at little money where
It's more convenient; then resold at thousands
US dollars/ Euros/ British pounds/ Swiss francs.

It is through it, also, that numbered accounts at offshore
Havens multiply. After all, are not these ones 
Worth much more than any other supposed
Paradise

Saw you the youth, with the face like the morning,
Refilling the glass, that foamed white as the sea?
Heard you the words that fell down like a warning,
'Lift not the glass: it holds sorrow for thee'?
He heeds not nor listens:
The red liquor glistens,
And he sees not the fangs of the serpent beneath.
And the fiends are elated,
And the voice waileth 'Fated,'
As he drains out the glass: the dumb agent of death.


High had he set his mark. Fame, wealth, and glory,
All should be his ere the noon-tide of life.
A name that should live in the annals of story,
His was a heart that could battle with strife.
'Here's to youthful endeavor!'
He cries. 'Ah! for ever
Shall the ruddy glass cheer me on life's rugged way.
There is strength for all trouble
In each airy bubble.
Who dares prate of danger and sorrow, I pray?'


Where is the youth with the face like the morning?
Where are the hopes that glowed bright as the noon!
He who had heard and obeyed not the warning,
Oh! has he reaped the dire harvest so soon?
He quaffed, all unheeding
The small voice's pleading,
And he lieth to-night in a dark prison cell.
This is his glory,
The name carved in story.
This has the red glass done. Say, is it well

So intense my love what to do
I know I can not live without you

eternally it shall with vigor flow
Stronger and stronger it shall grow

left me stranded in lashing rain
why you choose to cause this pain

always out running to an fro
I find some linen in the stow

Why you go out dolled and feign
I surmised I'd never see you again
 
whiff of cologne, my heart in plow
return You late and a tantrum throw

Your smile’s a solace my heart throb
Snatch and from me moments rob.

But you break me down blow by blow
When need something, you make a show

To this day your smiles an reginal reign
Make me fall in love all over again

One day you’ll come around, I know

(April Is marriage a forced prostitution? 
Or part of noble institution? 
Why there be irrelevant question? 
Or even stress and specific mention, 

When tied a nuptial knot, 
No question of no or not, 
After so many wrangles fought, 
Beautiful creature in vision is caught, 
 
Many argue it is decided in heaven, 
Not facing odds but some situation also even, 
When marriage is over, happy ending then, 
Question arises how to begin new life and when, 

Initial days pass with happiness and joy, 
To keep bride happy all tactics employ, 
Each passing of day may add happiness or gloom, 
Flowers also may fade after initial boom, 

When wife starts distancing self, 
All utensils make noise in shelf, 
Soon to realize reality and gravity of situation, 
Days may be over marking end of infatuation, 

With issue of one or two more kids, 
Most of the time spent on feeds, 
Slackness in relation emerge to surface, 
Wife may feel as if going near to furnace, 

All this lead to scuffle and unrest, 
Real time comes when relation to test, 
All try to avoid and keep it as best, 
Everything now done is at their behest, 

Legal pundits say marriage can be termed, 
Forced prostitution may be but can’t be named, 
Court may term it as torture and atrocity, 
Life can be in doldrums and not remain as continuity, 

Whether willing or unwilling she has to submit, 
Though not to liking but surrender and admit, 
But it is long and painful debate, 
Matter should end and nothing more to relate,Love is not a profession
genteel or otherwise

sex is not dentistry
the slick filling of aches and cavities

you are not my doctor
you are not my cure,

nobody has that
power, you are merely a fellow/traveller

Give up this medical concern,
buttoned, attentive,

permit yourself anger
and permit me mine

which needs neither
your approval nor your suprise

which does not need to be made legal
which is not against a disease

but against you,
which does not need to be understood

or washed or cauterized,
which needs instead

to be said and said.
Permit me the present tense.

Is pain a memory, is pain a friend? 
Is this pain real, is it just pretend? 
Is it a hurt I've lost, or a hurt yet found? 
Is it just inside, or all around? 

Is it a game, that I've already lost? 
Is it the price I pay instead, is it the cost? 
Is it a reminder of what not to do and why? 
Is it the voice that tells me I shouldn't try? 

Is it to hinder or to lend a helping hand? 
Is it the reason why my heart won't mend

Is peace not possible? 

You shall be wiped out
If talk about
Uniformity
Or liberty 

What do you understand by liberty? 
Freedom of movement in any country
Or professing faith you want
Or follow the path you can't? 

Certain people force on ambiguous terms
With blood soaked hands they turn
Yield the gun and kill the innocents
This is where we now fear and live in present 

Even mighty nations develop cold feet? 
They add fuel to fire and fail to meet
With enough of resistance
They have demonstrated partial stance

Rogue states threaten world peace
Demonstrate weapons of mass destruction with force
Such forces are backed by powerful states
We are hanging in balance with fate 

World shall be annihilated
Another example shall be sighted 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki is still live before our eyes 
The dangerous equation blurs our vision and flies


She was beautiful
But she didn't see beauty like I saw it
She was undefined, prone to cry
Just a little undeveloped
I loved her just the way she was
But she couldn't see
All the beauty inside
She tried to cover up for me
Using makeup, push-up bras, 
Thongs and low cut jeans, flaws
In the mirror, mascara runs, and all she saw
Was a stupid fat w***e
Guess I was never enough
To curb her false identified self image

Locked in the bathroom
Blood on her hands
Fingers down her throat 
And I lost respect for her
I cursed and screamed
But I held her tight
Tried to keep her head up high
But it really didn't matter
She saw
Unwritten law
And now I'm gone
Because she was so lost

She was beautiful 
This is what I told her over and over again
"You don't have to do this for me
You don't have to look like them
I don't even like them
Baby I love you
Don't you see? 
This is the reason that I chose you"
She wouldn't stop, her mind was set
I was so upset
It was the little things about her that I loved
Do you catch my drift? 
But she went ahead and did it anyway
I was hurt and confused
I thought I showed her that I loved her

Waited in the car 
Sweaty palms, stomach sick
Went and changed herself
And I lost respect for her
I couldn't think about it
But I held her tight
Tried to keep my head straight
But it really didn't matter
She saw
Unwritten law
And now I'm gone 
Because I was so lost

I touched her gently 
I loved her right
She didn't notice
Se was busy reading Cosmo
And all of the sudden
Before my eyes
She was some bimbo
Waiting tables for pigs and horses

Was a moment in time
A second nothing more
When I held her close
And I felt perfect for her
But she fell down hard 
Though I held her tight
Tried to keep her head up high
But it really didn't matter
She saw
Unwritten law
And now I'm gone
Because she was so lost


Success is not always a chance or a luck
It cannot be purchased with some buck
But hard work and determination my dear
Is the basic cause that'll take its care

And win good fortune just for you
And bring you success in flying hues
Because there are the symbol in life
Of healthy mind and thoughts that survive

So whenever you choose your life's aim
Or enter in some life's new game
Besides working hard to break nutty crust

Because hard work is what you need
Along with strengthening and determination's deed
Because success is not always chance or luck
And it cannot be just purchased with some buck. 

do i know you
i dont think i do
no because this isnt really you
what have you become
we were so close
lifelong friends
well what happened there
sex drugs and rock n roll
how'd that happen to you

you pushed me away
when we got to close
i used to be the one to stop you
but you didnt let me be there
so look at you now
take a step back
look in the mirror
then look at our picture

which one is really you 
which one is really true


If someone should ask you one day, 
is the war over? 
you may respond by saying which one? 
Wars it seem are never over
the war with ourselves 
and 
with each other
No small conflict dies a natural death, 
but mushroom clouds to the heavens 
and back
landing as close to my backyard
as the government will permit
Lately it seems that
even saying I love you 
invites a 
carefully measured response. 

Is there a bitter pang for love removed, 
Than the alive, the loving, the beloved— 
Not yet, not yet beyond all hopes and fears! 
Would I were laid 
Under the shade 
Of the calm grave, and the long grass of years,—

That love might die with sorrow:—I am sorrow; 
And she, that loves me tenderest, doth press 
Most poison from my cruel lips, and borrow 
Only new anguish from the old caress; 
Oh, this world's grief 
Hath no relief

In being wrung from a great happiness. 
Would I had never filled thine eyes with love, 
For love is only tears: would I had never 
Breathed such a curse-like blessing as we prove; 
Now, if 'Farewell' could bless thee, I would sever! 
Would I were laid 
Under the shade 
Of the cold tomb, and the long grass forever

For me there can be no doubt
'Cause I learned His sacred name
And in anger cursed it out

To honor His sacred name
And to those who broke that law
He would hold them to the blame

Is a fact that I do know
While I bear the punishment
I rightly earned long ago
He alleviates symptoms
That from my illness flow


Thank You very much for Your Blessing! 
















Is there a power that can sustain and cheer
The captive chieftain, by a tyrant's doom,
Forced to descend into his destined tomb--
A dungeon dark! where he must waste the year,
And lie cut off from all his heart holds dear;
What time his injured country is a stage
Whereon deliberate Valour and the rage
Of righteous Vengeance side by side appear,
Filling from morn to night the heroic scene
With deeds of hope and everlasting praise:-- 
Say can he think of this with mind serene
And silent fetters? Yes, if visions bright
Shine on his soul, reflected from the days
When he himself was tried in open light. 

Why gun yielding people succeed? 
Why people look at with greed? 
What makes people to think of wealth? 
I fail to understand the concept of life and death

Why have we become materialistic? 
When know fully well that nothing is static
The change may sweep over
Even life may loose its cover

Is there end to endless ambition? 
Is there fairness in real relation? 
Not a single field is left with selfish interest
We all view it as an apple’s reach with our best

It is alright up to certain extent
Let there be no critical comment
We know are weakest animal on earth
We shall not leave habit till last breath 

I shall pray god to inject one thing
Let people wish for peace to bring
Let poor live with whatever they have
Let them have suffering but not with cruel misbehavior 

Nobody may want to part with
Life is precious compared to wealth
It may change tomorrow
Let us wish it honestly and allow


Is there any reward?
I'm beginning to doubt it.
I am broken and bored,
Is there any reward
And inform me about it.
Is there any reward?
I'm beginning to doubt it. 

When He smiles, 
 I smile too, 
When He cries, 
 I cry too

When He laughs, 
 I laugh a lot
When He sings, 
 I sing too.

When He fails, 
 I feel ive failed
When He’s right, 
 I feel im right 

When He’s tired, 
Im soo tired, 
When He’s sad
 I am sad

Every word He says
I take it seriously

If this is love
Then I AM IN LOVE

h June ading through the unknown 
Winds alighting
From night till morning
Grueling intimacy breaks the silence dawn
That sky on top is the eyes
Secluded for a moment
Of anything whispering
From rag to riches
That’s our love of premiership 
Needs to need
Begs to bargain
That’s our crave
No hold barred
How do I love you? 
You want the big O
I want it too
Regular or impromptu
Classic or manic
Samson and Delilah
Is history
Love victory
You and me
Is majestic
Reaching
The road to Bougainvillea
Is paradise
Shimmering through the lights
Thrust through ‘the three Gorges dam’
Spilling tons of water
Arresting ourselves
Entangled in the web of love
Doubting each other
Wouldn’t tear us further
But a sign
Of another consign
Unfolds in a dream
Bliss of zest
If only two of us 
Left standing on Earth
Don’t stop
Cultivating and harvesting
The seeds
Adam and Eve
Would envy
For, the procreation
Is the prima facie
Our love exists
Ultimately
Inseparable
Like gravity


A word under whose weight, we rise or crumble.
A path along which star-crossed lovers stumble.

In whose name, battles are lost and won.
Under whose shadow, empires come undone.

For whose sake, lives, we sacrifice.
With enough imagination, even believe our own lies.

Interactions considered innate in base animals, 
We have called 'love' and drawn parallels.

We classified as conjugal, paternal, maternal, 
Fraternal, and of course, let's not forget eternal.

Yet elusive and evasive, in what it might truly represent, 
We who convince ourselves most loved, seem most content. 

Come out of hiding, 
Show your face, 
Come out of hiding, 
Am I a disgrace? 

Bring me to life, 
Help me sort things out, 
Bring me to life, 
I feel I have missed out.

Take me away, 
I have lived a lie, 
Take me away, 
I want to die.

Show me the way, 
Lead me to somewhere, 
Show me the way, 
Anywhere I don’t care.

Let me leave this place, 
I want to go away, 
Let me leave this place, 
I might return someday-You are locked in a never-ending poem; 
Now take a breath before line three
And please continue from line one.


Stood alone at the cliff's edge one stormy night
contemplating between life and death its self
a mind full of disturbing thoughts
are they real, or, are they forced? 
confusion drives me to distraction.
Apparitions of souls from the past
with haunting faces and sunken eyes
as horror and fear is welling up inside.

Worthless emotions are clawing at my skin
driving the darkness, compelling me to give in
these deathly thoughts engulfing my brain
void of all feelings, even pain.
When thought's of death race to the fore, 
Is over the edge my only escape? 
What leads me to this dismal place? 
What makes me stop, and hesitate? 

As waves crash angerly down below
the lightning strikes, thunder roars
howling winds burrows under my skin
while despair and guilt wash's over me
as voices carried on the crashing waves 
making bets, will she.  won't she.

What of those I leave behind? 
Was I ever a happy child? 
Did I ride my red bike with pride? 
Play hopscotch with all my friends? 
Why do I want this life to end? 
Will life ever be the same? 
Try I will with all my might too, 
make myself stand up and fight.

Wake me from this nightmare slumber.

by A. 

A. oor, weak and worthless though I am
I have a rich almighty friend;
He freely loves, and without end. 

He ransomed me from hell with blood,
And by His pow'r my foes controlled;
And brought me to His chosen fold. 

He cheers my heart, my wants supplies,
And says that I shall shortly be,
Enthroned with Him above the skies;

But ah! I my inmost spirit mourns,
And well my eyes with tears may swim,
To think of my perverse returns;
I've been a faithless friend to him. 

Often my gracious Friend I grieve,
Neglect, distrust, and disobey,
And often Satan's lies believe,
Sooner than all my Friend can say. 

He bids me always freely come,
And promises whate'er I ask:
But I am straitened, cold and dumb,
And count my privilege a task. 

Before the world that hates his course,
My treach'rous heart has throbbed with shame;
Loth to forego the worlds applause,
I hardly dare avow his name. 

Sure were not I most vile and base,
I could not thus my friend requite!
He'd frown and spurn me from his sight. 

Sitting in a restaurant
Over a cup of coffee
And silently having our dinner
With hardly anything exciting
Either to brag or blather
My eyes got hooked
On the occupants of the table, next

Two kids, seated on small chairs
A boy and a girl, obviously a pair of twins
Adorably cute, their father, so young
Who having placed the order
Were in wait for their turn

Carrying a tray, as the waiter arrived 
With something of the plainest kind, 
Small cartons of French fries, 
Bottles of sauce and plain ice cream
The little faces gleamed in excitement
Their beaded eyes riveted, 
And their heads bobbed in happy approval 

As their Dad opened the carton
And placed before them
French fries sprinkled with some sauce, 
The children, sprang to their feet
With an upsurge of delight, 
Jumping up and down, 
Clapping their hands and shouting! 

At a small distance, sat we
‘Solemnly’ consuming our meal
With nothing to titillate our palette
Or excite our toned nerves.

I thought; 
How, in course of time, 
Everything becomes a routine ritual
And what stark difference 
Between our subdued composure
And the overwhelming excitement of kids! 
They haven’t learned yet
That such open expression of emotions, 
Is not in keeping with accepted norms

To what peaks of joy, they get catapulted
With mere trifles and silly baubles
While we remain ever at the bottom
Unable to be lifted up
 
Is this what we call aging? 
The death of spring, the summer’s dirge
Or the chill wave of winter’s blast? 

Season of winter
Hopes on worldly life
Happiness every one wants
But happiness ever distant.

Hopes in winter
The good climate to enjoy
But enjoyment is not epicurean
Life is not mere epicure
Life is transient

Every day is a spent day
Minus the day from calendar
ephialtes in every night
The death which hounds ever. 

That moves sublime from Idumea's road?
In Bosrah's dies, with martial glories join'd,
His purple vesture waves upon the wind.
Why thus enrob'd delights he to appear
In the dread image of the Pow'r of war?
   Compres'd in wrath the swelling wine-press groan'd,
It bled, and pour'd the gushing purple round.

   "Mine was the act," th' Almighty Saviour said,
And shook the dazzling glories of his head,
"When all forsook I trod the press alone,
"And conquer'd by omnipotence my own;
"For man's release sustain'd the pond'rous load,
"To execute th' Eternal's dread command
"My soul I sacrific'd with willing hand;
"Sinless I stood before the avenging frown,
"Atoning thus for vices not my own


   His eye the ample field of battle round
Survey'd, but no created succours found;
His own omnipotence sustain'd the right,
His vengeance sunk the haughty foes in night;
Beneath his feet the prostrate troops were spread,
And round him lay the dying, and the dead.

What pow'r withstands if thou indignant rise?

   Against thy Zion though her foes may rage,
And all their cunning, all their strength engage,
Yet she serenely on thy bosom lies,
Smiles at their arts, and all their force defies. 

Scarlet coats, and crash o' the band,
      The grey of a pauper's gown,
     A soldier's grave in Zululand,
      And a woman in Brecon Town.

My little lad for a soldier boy,
 (Mothers o' Brecon Town!)
My eyes for tears and his for joy
 When he went from Brecon Town,
His for the flags and the gallant sights
His for the medals and his for the fights,
And mine for the dreary, rainy nights
 At home in Brecon Town.

They say he's laid beneath a tree,
 (Come back to Brecon Town!)
Shouldn't I know? --  I was there to see:
 (It's far to Brecon Town!)
It's me that keeps it trim and drest
With a briar there and a rose by his breast --
The English flowers he likes the best
 That I bring from Brecon Town.

And I sit beside him -- him and me,
 (We're back to Brecon Town.)
To talk of the things that used to be
 (Grey ghosts of Brecon Town);
I know the look o' the land and sky,
And the bird that builds in the tree near by,
And times I hear the jackals cry,
 And me in Brecon Town.

     Golden grey on miles of sand
      The dawn comes creeping down;
     It's day in far off Zululand
      And night in Brecon Town. 

Dost thou not tire, Isaura, of this play?

'What play?' Why, this old play of winning hearts!

Nay, now, lift not thine eyes in that feigned way:

'Tis all in vain—I know thee and thine arts.

Let us be frank, Isaura. I have made

A study of thee; and while I admire

The practised skill with which thy plans are laid,

I can but wonder if thou dost not tire.

Why, I tire even of Hamlet and Macbeth!

When overlong the season runs, I find

Those master-scenes of passion, blood, and death,

After a time do pall upon my mind.

Dost thou not tire of lifting up thine eyes

To read the story thou hast read so oft—

Of ardent glances and deep quivering sighs,

Of haughty faces suddenly grown soft?

Is it not stale, oh, very stale, to thee,

The scene that follows? Hearts are much the same;

The loves of men but vary in degree—

They find no new expressions for the flame.

Thou must know all they utter ere they speak,

As I know Hamlet's part, whoever plays.

Oh, does it not seem sometimes poor and weak?

I think thou must grow weary of their ways.

I pity thee, Isaura! I would be

The humblest maiden with her dream untold


And find life's rarest treasures stale and old.

I pity thee; for now, let come what may,

Fame, glory, riches, yet life will lack all.

Wherewith can salt be salted? And what way

Can life be seasoned after love doth pall?


Look at the raindrops
they are giving you a sign
let your sadness flow away with the rain
forget the past
move ahead from the sorrow
come live this life.

Look at these dancing waves
they're also hinting at you
to leave the shore of your fears
and to become fearless
and with your self-belief
come achieve new heights in this exam of life.

Look at the sun rays
they're telling you 
to shun the darkness within you
and to see the bright light
and asking you to brighten this world
with your inner light.

Look at the twinkling stars
they're hinting you
to achieve your dreams
and to touch the sky
and asking you to decorate this world
with your shine.



We don’t believe in ghosts, 
And we don’t believe in ghouls, 
We don’t believe in vampires, 
And by costumes we’re not fooled.

We believe in our Creator, 
We believe in the unseen, 
So please understand, 
We don’t practise Halloween! 

Because Halloween, 
Is not really our thing, 
We hope you have fun, 
But our bell, please do not ring! 

For we are Muslim, 
And though we like a joke, 
Halloween is not for us, 
We’re simple, peaceful folk.

We hope you have fun, 
And don’t wish to offend, 
We don’t celebrate, 
But our smiles we do send! 

We love to eat candy, 
And we love to laugh and play, 
But if you’re trick or treating, 
Come back another day


Unsuitable for song as well as sense 
the island flowers into slums 
and skyscrapers, reflecting
precisely the growth of my mind. 
I am here to find my way in it. 
Sometimes I cry for help 
But mostly keep my own counsel. 
I hear distorted echoes 
Of my own ambigious voice 
and of dragons claiming to be human.
 Bright and tempting breezes 
Flow across the island, 
Separating past from the future; 
Then the air is still again 
As I sleep the fragrance of ignorance. 
How delight the soul with absolute 
sense of salvation, how
hold to a single willed direction?
I cannot leave the island,
I was born here and belong.
Even now a host of miracles
hurries me a daily business,
minding the ways of the island
as a good native should,
taking calm and clamour in my stride. 


I am an island, 
Isolated, 
Surrounded by sea.
Locked by my own destiny.


The sea teases my shores, 
It talks to me about the Moors.

It gives me a taste of freedom, 
And helps release my endless boredom.

It speaks to me, of places to see.
Of far away lands, where the people are free.

It brings me news, of outside events, 
Of foreign spices, of caravans and tents.

It speaks to me, of hidden shores, 
Filled with new things, not yet explored.

It teaches me to look up high, 
It asks me, "See the sun, wind and sky? "

It tells me to look and observe, 
"Can you see the way the birds swerve? "

It tells me of the creatures, that live deep within, 
That hide and burrow, with or without fin.

It tells me all these things, and yet I cannot touch, 
I can only wait, Oh, I wait so much.

To hear it bring its news, and hear its stories, 
Of men brave and bold, and some of their glories.

But the water needs me, it needs me to play with, 
For without me, it would have no one to share with.

And so I realize, I’m not so alone, 
Not isolated, nor should I moan.

Because we need, each other, you see, 
We’re all part of a puzzle, the sea, sky and me.

A puzzle so grand, an amazing quilt, 
Created by One, whose power doesn’t wilt.

The Hand that made this, has it all planned, 
And so I need not try to expand.

I will be satisfied with what is mine, 
The ability to listen, and plenty of time. 


after the all been done and i
one old creature carried on
another creature's back, i wonder
could i have fought these thing?
surrounded by no son of mine save
old men calling Mother like in the tale
the astrologer tell, i wonder
could i have walk away when voices
singing in my sleep? i one old woman.
always i seem to worrying now for
another young girl asleep
in the plain evening.
what song around her ear?
what star still choosing


The wind of humanity washes over me
Tugging at my clothes
sucking the breath from my lungs.

My brain is numbed by its coldness

The stream of chatter
Cascades down the escalators
Deafening, drowning.

I am jettisoned into a heaving sea

Jostled by flotsam
In an undertow of metal, 
Horns sounding in a fog of traffic.

I lie in a broken surf of foaming cars

The Hebridean gale was never this cruel
The Highland torrent never so raucous
The Atlantic never so un-kind. 

Corpse-cold, I drift to a western shore.



Islands, 
stripe the road.
The ocean, 
but it tarries.
Songs you once sung.
Forgotten it is known.
Grow even larger. 

The continents and countries 
Distant and near 
The islands spread in oceans
The islands near various nations
Nice to see their locations

Wonderfully beautiful they are
The nature's creativity exemplary
The islands with best of fertile soil
With immense growth of cultivation
Coconut palms, and plantation crops
The hardworking and risk taking people
Islands are thickly inhabited.

Islands cradles of civilizations
Whether it is Greek, or Maldives
The great island nation Australia
Wonderful history and heritages
Islands are most beautiful landscape.

Very small islands in rivers
World over we can see it
The precious gift of nature
Sometimes takes back in floods
When inhabitants put in hardships.

Protection of islands and its nature
Vital for human development and culture
Also for tourism and opportunities
Islands are beautiful and comfortable. 




He pulled the trigger
on that noisy morning
in the Bunker of Berlin.
The pages of Mein Kampf, 
just briefly soaked
were used to start
the fire that would mark
the end of an epoch
that had, astonishingly, given
birth to itself in 
When a fanatic says a word
of hatred or of utter bigotry, 
one must believe, as if it were HIS word
or be forever in the net of rank complicity.
So, he is dead and gone
but something ugly thrives, 
it is called Hitlerism.
And it has spread to reach
all corners of a peace-less globe.
It dresses in the clothes of any emperor
and wears the mask of true benevolence.
Perhaps the answer is to close one's eyes
and listen to the music of oblivion. 

Something I was taught from along time ago
From the Book of Revelation you know
When the time came for the wheat to mow


Put your feet exactly, 
where there needed.
Put your maximum weight, 
directed come through.
Cheat your way up or down, 
by closing your eyes. 
By finding old places underneath.
By sticking your legs in new places. 
That would, 
make even your mum blush. 

This heart became slave
It sleeps in the past cave
That life had kept in grave
It made my smiles shave

Life seems to be in a rave
It took away what it gave
By leaving me in a stave
It made me kneel in nave

He tried his best to save
With his words of brave
To make my heart feel pave
So it lights and stops to crave

Slowly it started to behave
Felt will overcome the wave
But life acted like a knave
And labeled me has deprave

Now I am a muted enslave
With no songs of outbrave
Nor this pathos of mine will lave
So I had made myself enclave


Nothing happens.  

do I wish them? 
In the comfort caged, stagnation; 
Seize the day! Carpe Diem! 
Dare I to escape the isolation? 
Thousands days I lived as one, 
Without nobody, without no-one.

Here's a day, then comes a night
Another day, then night again; 
And the sunshine promise life
Yet, no effect for inner pain; 
Thoughts with me they do converse, 
I answer back, then we inverse.

For the day it shows my shadow, 
In the night I sense my ghost
Still, not alone here in the meadow
In Nature's beauty I am lost.
With all around in isolation, 
My Spirit's free: Liberation

Humans more to think and act in their own ways
Where he feels happiness, despair or sadness
When it feels to be failed slowly try to hide
Isolation of human life a horrible experience
Isolated life more than scared him than real death
Community life more encouraging with transfer of ideas
When mind is friendly to other ones
When smile is making the positiveness
Such a man can't be isolated for ever
The happiness and success follows them. 

My Maker shunneth me :
Even as a wretch stricken with leprosy,
So hold I pestilent supremacy.
Yea! He Instil fled far as the uttermost star,
Beyond the unperturbed fastnesses of night
And dreams that bastioned are
By fretted towers of sleep that scare His light.

Of wisdom writ, whereto
My burdened feet may haste withouten rue,
I may not spell-and I am sore to do.
Yea, all (seeing my Maker hath such dread),
Even mine own self-love, wists not but to fly
To Him, and sore besped
Leaves me, its captain, in such mutiny.

Will, deemed incorporate
With me, bath flown ere love, to expiate
Its sinful stay where He did habitate.

Ah me, if they had left a sepulchre ;
But no-the light bath changed not, and in it
Of its same colour stir
Spirits I see not but phantasmed feel to flit.

Air, legioned with such, stirreth,
So that I seem to draw them with my breath,
Ghouls that devour each joy they do to death,
Strange glimmering griefs and sorrowing silences
Bearing dead flowers unseen whose charnel smell
Great awe to my sense is
Even in the rose-time when all else is well. 

I prefer isolation and dark, 
No disturbance from dog’s bark, 
Easy escape from assassin’s mark, 
No problem for vehicle’s park, 
No closing of eyes when ignite the spark, 

Darkness where no one can infiltrate, 
Not an insect or sound penetrate, 
Darkness where I can see only light, 
Togetherness with conscious and soul right, 
Away from the hustle and no one to fight, 

When mind at peace and new horizons open, 
Vision spread across and areas widen, 
Fear disappears and approaches Bolden, 
To attain oneness and opportunity golden, 
Appearance of divine power all of sudden, 

Concentration of mind and irrelevant things narrow, 
No where to go or seek advice or borrow, 
Today’s talks today and never to leave tomorrow, 
Pointing at the direction and aiming like arrow, 
No room for remorse or to feel for sorrow, 

Contentment of lust and controlling the anger, 
Not points mistakes by raising small finger, 
There will be miraculous escape by cliff hanger, 
Free from bondage and nothing to worry from danger, 

Prayer in isolation pays more dividends, 
It is achievement as if at dead end, 
Almighty give you courage and signal send, 
Feelers from all sides just to make you bend, 
Not how much you live but how do you spend, 

Deeper and deeper cutting across lines, 
Not fearing for life and any more fines, 
Not to wake from concentration even blast in mines, 
Not to fall prey even with woman and wine, 
Only aim higher to face and not challenge divine, 

Kindly to lead from dark shadow to light, 
Not undermining the power and not fight, 
Wherever little hope appears or come in sight, 
Pursue with earnestness and path always right, 
Sudden appearance of light may make it bright. 

I awake, 
Dreams burdened with your eyes.

A recollection of temperance
From a soul as empty
as the spirits in a glass. 

My mind remains heavily weighted, 
with unfair remnants 
of celestial lies.  

Cold, 
Creeping, 
Despair.

"He would have been a boy", 
She said- 

I sometimes wish
I was a glass.
It’s easier to break without a soul.



I bade my heart more constant be.
I bade it keep the world away,
And grow a home for only thee;
Nor fear'd but thy love likewise grew,
Like mine, each day, more tried, more true.

The fault was grave! I might have known,
What far too soon, alas! I learn'd--
The heart can bind itself alone,
And faith may oft be unreturn'd.
Self-sway'd our feelings ebb and swell--
Thou lov'st no more;--Farewell! Farewell!

Farewell!--and thou, thou lonely heart,
Which never yet without remorse
Even for a moment didst depart
From thy remote and spher{`e}d course
To haunt the place where passions reign--
Back to thy solitude again!

Back! with the conscious thrill of shame
Which Luna felt, that summer-night,
Flash through her pure immortal frame,
When she forsook the starry height
To hang over Endymion's sleep
Upon the pine-grown Latmian steep.

How vain a thing is mortal love,
Wandering in Heaven, far removed.
But thou hast long had place to prove
This truth--to prove, and make thine own:
'Thou hast been, shalt be, art, alone.'

Or, if not quite alone, yet they
Which touch thee are unmating things--
Ocean and clouds and night and day;
Lorn autumns and triumphant springs;
And life, and others' joy and pain,
And love, if love, of happier men.

Of happier men--for they, at least,
Have dream'd two human hearts might blend
In one, and were through faith released
From isolation without end
Prolong'd; nor knew, although not less
Alone than thou, their loneliness. 

Without World War two, one sees.
I saw two foot holds, one without me.
I hear the lone hawk, it can not see me
hooded and tied, it works against he.
World War two and without it you see.
No foot hold in Israel, it would not now be. 


In Heaven a spirit doth dwell
         "Whose heart-strings are a lute";
       None sing so wildly well
       As the angel Israfel,
       And the giddy stars (so legends tell),
       Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
         Of his voice, all mute.

       Tottering above
         In her highest noon,
         The enamored moon
       Blushes with love,
         While, to listen, the red levin
         (With the rapid Pleiads, even,
         Which were seven,)
         Pauses in Heaven.

       And they say (the starry choir
         And the other listening things)
       That Israfeli's fire
       Is owing to that lyre
         By which he sits and sings-
       The trembling living wire
         Of those unusual strings.

       But the skies that angel trod,
         Where deep thoughts are a duty-
         Where the Houri glances are
       Imbued with all the beauty
         Which we worship in a star.

       Therefore thou art not wrong,
         Israfeli, who despisest
       An unimpassioned song;
       To thee the laurels belong,
         Best bard, because the wisest!
       Merrily live, and long!

       The ecstasies above
         With thy burning measures suit-
       Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
         With the fervor of thy lute-
         Well may the stars be mute!

       Yes, Heaven is thine; but this
         Is a world of sweets and sours;
         Our flowers are merely- flowers,
       And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
         Is the sunshine of ours.

       If I could dwell
       Where Israfel
         Hath dwelt, and he where I,
       He might not sing so wildly well
         A mortal melody,
       While a bolder note than this might swell
       From my lyre within the sky. 


iss it secure, in safty is watch
to quick? iss it lack, of suspension
attention spanned-is smiled.
iss it high just

warrior painter preacher sage
something here from every age
that scholars students alike rage

conqueror vicar silent monk
on glades and lakes geese honk
comes of age the Turkish wonk

gawkers hawkers fill Taksim
bubbling cauldron full to brim
nuzzling youth in corners dim

parks museums golden horn
races many, winds had borne
melted in and a nation born

bridges tunnels trains tracks
baggage stacks, touristy sacks
millions pass with their packs

landscape of hearty blissful views
legends of maidens run profuse
sparking the wit of many a muse

trams crisscross old and new
boats of every colour and hue
patience is this country's glue

thump of music in the air
Sounds of supping, laughter fair
A hijab'd figure hurrying there 

on road street corner bend
gladly offered for every trend
delicious food of every blend

painted girls in streets by side
waiting consorts to hitch a ride
for just a night they'll be a bride

dine wine and dancing girls
a life of travel jewels pearls
historic fancy of counts earls


Go, my songs, seek your praise from the young 
and from the intolerant, 
Move among the lovers of perfection alone. 
Seek ever to stand in the hard Sophoclean light 
And take you wounds from it gladly. 

Clusters of cloud
surrounded me like a mist of haze.
The lush green hills
were breathtakingly beautiful to gaze.

My car was piercing through
the hills on a wet slippery road.
When the sheep were 
climbing the hills in hoards.

Suddenly i got engulfed by the clouds, 
inside them i wished 
they must never let me out.
Wishes don't always come true, 
beyond me the clouds went
passing me through.

Rarely did a vehicle pass by
fascinated and intrigued was i
with the lovely woods i stood by.

Little children were returning from school
some had umbrella's while some were game
cause for them, everyday it was just the same.

I was watching it all
slowly gathering my memories
scattered along the road.
Last time here a bright sun had shone.
Even then the children
were returning from school, 
and then their umbrella's had kept them cool.

I crossed a bridge over a spring.
The light drizzle created ripples 
on the water of the spring.
A streak of sunlight finally
managed to make its way 
filtering through the imposing trees
casting shadows on the road.

The drizzle was not ready to let up, 
how mystic and magical  was the set up? 
Oh god! I thought, cursing myself
why the hell am i leaving this paradise behind
just to meet an appointment in time.

As psychology-explains


I have not bummed across America
with only a dollar to spare, one pair
of busted Levi's and a bowie knife.
I have lived with thieves in Manchester.

I have not padded through the Taj Mahal,
barefoot, listening to the space between
each footfall picking up and putting down
its print against the marble floor. But I


skimmed flat stones across Black Moss on a day
so still I could hear each set of ripples
as they crossed. I felt each stone's inertia
spend itself against the water; then sink. 

I have not toyed with a parachute cord
while perched on the lip of a light-aircraft;
but I held the wobbly head of a boy
at the day centre, and stroked his fat hands. 

And I guess that the tightness in the throat
and the tiny cascading sensation
somewhere inside us are both part of that
sense of something else. That feeling, I mean. 

when our fingers interlock we have each others hearts in our hands
 our love is traveling through the universe and i hope it never lands
 and baby it only gets better
 im constantly havin dreams of me and u gettin old  ether
 watchin our kids play while were on our porch chairs rockin
 every second is forever when time feels like its always stoppin
 all i hear is destiny knockin an i just cant wait
 meetin up with u and connectin so fast it must be fate
 love feels so great when ur doing it with ur soulmate
 open and honest thats how i'll always be
 cause u opened my mind and set my heart free
 and i feel that u honor me when u give back all that love, respect, and honesty
 and to the world i offer no apology
 i am who i am an my baby loves me
 all the haters in our life i consider that a plus
 cause if its me and u versus the world im betting on us


Whatever is a cruel wrong, 
 Whatever is unjust, 
The honest years that speed along
 Will trample in the dust.
In restless youth I railed at fate
 With all my puny might, 
But now I know if I but wait
 It all will come out right.

Though Vice may don the judge’s gown
 And play the censors’ part, 
And Fact be cowed by Falsehood’s frown
 And Nature ruled by art; 
Though Labour toils through blinding tears
 And idle Wealth is might, 
I know that the honest, earnest years
 Will bring it all out right.

Though poor and loveless creeds may pass
 For pure religion’s gold; 
Though ignorance may rule the mass
 While truth meets glances cold, 
I know a law, complete, sublime, 
 Controls us with its might, 
 It all will come out right. 

Every night she comes to me, 
the offer of eternal freedom how it sweetly rings. 
And as for him who is my son when evening, 
with a whisper comes, It comes the southern sun.

In the clearing by the brook when heavens, 
never clear and clear it always seems to be.
However comes the thickest star, veiled, it cries.
And looking up you wander there about he shouts it out.
And he hears you wander all about the star light, sky.
 
Painful is my brain and it struggles off the edge fond memories.
As for silent music hearts insure my chest the sound of harmony.
As it beats and burns for cooler times it climbs the nearest hill.
Useless time gone by until the earth gives up the dead it took.
And it cannot turn around and look at his dreams when lost in me. 

Oysters
that doze in the sun to thinly.
There where the water is.
Two round stones barley covered by the tide.

My sister is barley covered.
My brother the nun echoes in silence.
The rooster stands up out of sleep.

All of the faces.
Gone is the moon another life 
I left to love little by little the song.
Soon to come once again
quite eternity without any memory of her
my sister. 

Crazy again I shut the door.
It shuts close on sweet lips-silk a rose.
And a new mother and father, Look
the moon the eye balls that boy in a dress.

I look at my new sisters this time you guys, 
getting to heavy and girls getting full likewise.
By the sea.
I have found out things and dreams you long for. 
Grace is a complicated matter.
Black silk confussion covers the red sheets beneath him.It bloomed and dropt, a Single Noon—
The Flower—distinct and Red—
I, passing, thought another Noon
Another in its stead

Will equal glow, and thought no More
But came another Day
To find the Species disappeared—
The Same Locality—

The Sun in place—no other fraud
On Nature's perfect Sum—
Had I but lingered Yesterday—
Was my retrieveless blame—

Much Flowers of this and further Zones
Have perished in my Hands
For seeking its Resemblance—
But unapproached it stands—

The single Flower of the Earth
That I, in passing by
Unconscious was—Great Nature's Face
Passed infinite by Me—The disappointments and struggles
that we face everyday
knock, blow, bruise and burn us.

But it shapes us anew.

We see the struggles of others
in a different light.
It makes us compassionate. 

It came with the threat of a waning moon
And the wail of an ebbing tide,
But many a woman has lived for less,
And many a man has died;
For life upon life took hold and passed,
Strong in a fate set free,
Out of the deep into the dark
On for the years to be.

Between the gloom of a waning moon
And the song of an ebbing tide,
Chance upon chance of love and death
Took wing for the world so wide.
O, leaf out of leaf is the way of the land,
Wave out of wave of the sea
And who shall reckon what lives may live
In the life that we bade to be

Although my heart dies of fear, 
and this knowledge is free from my head.
And are we not at the historic point once again.
Where are the words, when they never come.
Are coming out of truth from great depths, 
where is peace the place where it is, it is not.
Peace to each General wants what? 
Can peace from one philosopher, where it can, 
blessed she move to one side, divide the world? 
Where upon it is of the highest standard it is kept.
Doing not what you do but by proper speech it is spread.
Behind the wall, bricks are made we never laid.
Come one to her come ye all.
Does he say to you this is not so applied thought directly? 
Perfection which when applied, 
here is my hand and the arm of each one is extended.
Where the habit of dying is lonesome, our hearts.
Do you the dying at that place where we are led.
First by thee in what is heaven our love of freedom, 
my father permitted by each respective country.
Customs that change our duty is honor and we bleed.
Where her eye has awakened deep in thought, I beseech thee.
And our behavior which always by peace all seek to spread. 

It Can Never Change
and now you know what life has done to it.
Dear, again the Judge would know
and soon i must a·dieus, 
how I struggle with goodbye.
Death has many alters and each one.
Sara, 
and my daughters name is Caroline.
It Can Never Change.

It can't be "Summer"!
That—got through!
It's early—yet—for "Spring"!
There's that long town of White—to cross—
Before the Blackbirds sing!
It can't be "Dying"!
It's too Rouge—
The Dead shall go in White—
So Sunset shuts my question down
With Cuffs of Chrysolite!..

now sigh. 

Although much has been written
About the aftermath of battle
My time for the  last four years has been a trial
And a terrible combination of comments and compassion

All my writings have been about the t and d world wars
All have told of the terrible silence
The smell of cordite
And the smell of death.

The battlefield always seems to be scattered with paper
From photo's of loved ones
And letters pulled from khaki pockets
In their last agonies
Was it comfort they sought? or desperation.
When the soldier is young, invincibility
Reigns amongst youth.

And after the battle appear the looters
Ripping pockets and packs,  discarding treasures
From the twisted and wide eyed
Children of the day
We have learnt nothing about war except
The tradgedy, tears and unconsoluble hurt. 

Now it ceased to hurt me go.
Here alone It shows.
The shadows kept my secret.
That only night should know.

And if the light could see my face, 
and lift my burden no.
I see each hand that holds me up.
My verse has made some cry.

The other me inside the box, 
is quite ask not why.It ceased to hurt me, though so slow
I could not feel the Anguish go—
But only knew by looking back—
That something—had benumbed the Track—

Nor when it altered, I could say,
For I had worn it, every day,
As constant as the Childish frock—
I hung upon the Peg, at night.

But not the Grief—that nestled close
As needles—ladies softly press
To Cushions Cheeks—
To keep their place—

Nor what consoled it, I could trace—
Except, whereas 'twas Wilderness—
It's better—almost Peace—It costs nothing to feel the sunshine, 
to watch the smiling Moon-
Those gifts from heaven are so fine, 
The beauty of nature is a divine tune.

Showers of rain costs nothing, 
Gentle wind is also free-
Sweet songs of birds are touching, 
Meeting nice people is a glee.

We enjoy the sunsets and the dawns, 
We breathe the air without a fee, 
We admire faithfulness of swans-
Tenderness of a child is also free.

I watch the night comes here, 
It's understandable for me and clear: 
The most beautiful things on earth
Can't be bought, have no worth.

The h of July,t could be so nice to learn how to fly.
Though it’s a difficult task, but-
Let’s have a try! 
It seems an easier task to learn to see a smile
among thousand of angry faces, 
but- we are not on the races.
Let’s have a try! 
It could be so nice to learn how to dream
and in the dreams to fly in the future.
It could be such an adventure
with knowledge to capture.
It could be so nice to learn how to believe
in love, in joy, in good and kind poems, 
in awesome meetings that are random.
It could be so nice to see, 
but better to understand, 
yourself and others, 
your fathers and mothers.
It could be so nice to learn how to live, 
to admire the stars in the sky, 
to watch the seagulls fly, 
to catch and value the moment
with the short name – LIFE.

which, aren't really mine, I realize
things could get worse.) 

leaning against the wall, 
I watched, 
from the kitchen window, 
as the sky grew cloudy

I sighed, 
for the sunny days
of yesterday, 
yearning and moody

the radio was silent, 
the kettle was off, 
and the hum of the refrigerator
numbed and dumb

my sun won't return, 
urgency and thrust
no longer a must, 
fires are out, 

just glow and reflect
memories to keep and forgetIt did not surprise me—
So I said—or thought—
She will stir her pinions
And the nest forgot,

Traverse broader forests—
Build in gayer boughs,
Breathe in Ear more modern

This was but a Birdling—
What and if it be
One within my bosom
Had departed me?

This was but a story—
What and if indeed
There were just such coffin
In the heart instead

All through history, walking.
It left a place on your walls.
Write your own hearts, inside
is the language of commons? 
What has happened, towers
with art of it's leaned inwords? 
The circle of friends in the word, 
call  all around it's inside of you? 
Would she the you of is it to see? 
One lone verb moved a mountain.
Upon the mountain, sleepy nouns
washed in verbs, promises slept.
Rivers verbs, down sliding into 
thousands of hand painted nouns.
Trees base is thick, skies pillars.
Cool winds blow out into, all leaves. 

Falling in love made me fragile, 
Being alone made me weak.

In the end, 
It doesn't matter.
For the one who has felt sadness.

The eternal night made me see, 
What I couldn't see in the light.

In the end, 
It doesn't matter, 
For the one who has dreamed loneliness.  

Turning your back to me was a sign, 
By looking at me you made it clear.

In the end, 
It doesn't matter.
For the one who speaks emptiness.

With your hart you made me happy, 
With your soul you made me blind.

In the end, 
 It doesn't matter.
For the one who has seen darkness.It don't sound so terrible—quite—as it did—
I run it over—"Dead", Brain, "Dead

"
Put it in Latin—left of my school—
Seems it don't shriek so—under rule.

Turn it, a little—full in the face
A Trouble looks bitterest—
Shift it—just—
Say "When Tomorrow comes this way—
I shall have waded down one Day


I suppose it will interrupt me some
Till I get accustomed—but then the Tomb
Like other new Things—shows largest—then—
And smaller, by Habit—

It's shrewder then
Put the Thought in advance—a Year—
How like "a fit"—then—
Murder—wear

Strength shaded
In the sky 
Courage sunk
In the dream
A morning after the night
Every day comes
A smile after the hope
Never ever kissed

In the dream
Everything is pregnant
Not today but another day
It dreams


As for the thought of temptation 
although, I got to have her, 
It got wet, you push and the heat it's craving, 
hang on in the edge of her yearning-
All want my passion, it exceeds me.


'Twas on the shores that round our coast 
From Deal to Newport lie 
That I roused from sleep in a huddled heap 
An elderly wealthy guy.

His hair was graying, his hair was long, 
And graying and long was he; 
And I heard this grouch on the shore avouch, 
In a singular jazzless key:

"Oh, I am a cook and a waitress trim 
And a maid of the second floor, 
And a strong chauffeur and a housekeeper, 
And the man who tends the door!"

And he shook his fists and he tore his hair, 
And he started to frisk and play, 
Till I couldn't help thinking the man had been drinking, 
So I said (in the Gilbert way):

"Oh, elderly man, I don't know much 
Of the ways of societee, 
But I'll eat my friend if I comprehend 
However you can be

"At once a cook and a waitress trim 
And the maid of the second floor, 
And a strong chauffeur and a housekeeper, 
And the man who tends the door


Then he smooths his hair with a nervous air, 
And a gulp in his throat he swallows, 
And that elderly guy he then lets fly 
Substantially as follows:

"We had a house down Newport way, 
And we led a simple life; 
There was only I," said the elderly guy, 
And my daughter and my wife.

"And of course the cook and a waitress trim 
And the maid of the second floor, 
And a strong chauffeur and a housekeeper, 
And the man who tends the door


"One day the cook she up and left, 
She up and left us flat. 
She was getting a hundred and ten a mon- 
Th, but she couldn't work for that.

"And the waitress trim was her bosom friend, 
And she wouldn't stay no more; 
And our strong chauffeur eloped with her 
Who was the maid of the second floor.

"And we couldn't get no other help, 
So I had to cook and wait. 
It was quite absurd," wept the elderly bird. 
"I deserve a better fate.

"And I drove the car and I made the beds 
Till the housekeeper up and quit; 
And the man at the door found that a bore, 
Which is why I am, to wit:

"At once a cook and a waitress trim 
And the maid of the second floor, 
And a strong chauffeur and a housekeeper, 
And the man who tends the door

"I was outside St. Cecelia's Rectory
smoking a cigarette when a goat appeared beside me.
It was mostly black and white, with a little reddish
brown here and there. When I started to walk away,
it followed. I was amused and delighted, but wondered
what the laws were on this kind of thing. There's
a leash law for dogs, but what about goats? People
smiled at me and admired the goat. "It's not my goat,"
I explained. "It's the town's goat. I'm just taking
my turn caring for it

" "I didn't know we had a goat,"
one of them said. "I wonder when my turn is

" "Soon,"
I said. "Be patient. Your time is coming

" The goat
stayed by my side. It stopped when I stopped. It looked
up at me and I stared into its eyes. I felt he knew
everything essential about me. We walked on. A police-
man on his beat looked us over. "That's a mighty
fine goat you got there," he said, stopping to admire.
"It's the town's goat," I said. "His family goes back
three-hundred years with us," I said, "from the beginning

"
The officer leaned forward to touch him, then stopped
and looked up at me. "Mind if I pat him?" he asked.
"Touching this goat will change your life," I said.
"It's your decision

" He thought real hard for a minute,
and then stood up and said, "What's his name?" "He's
is like a fairy tale. Everywhere you turn there's mystery 
and wonder. And I'm just a child playing cops and robbers
forever. Please forgive me if I cry

" "We forgive you,
Officer," I said. "And we understand why you, more than
anybody, should never touch the Prince

" The goat and
I walked on. It was getting dark and we were beginning
to wonder where we would spend the night. 

It has a long been
We forgotten to write each other
Forgotten the way to Post Office

At times, I read the old letters
You wrote me
In those days, when we had pens, 
We had writing pads with decor 

Reading old letters feels wonderful 
A happy time with pearls in our eyes

It has a long been
I've waiting for new letters

Have our pens forgotten the names of
Those color pads? 
Or the pads of the pens

It is heart-rending to know a kiss
cannot cure the world of its illnesses,
nor can your happiness, nor your tragedy
of being a discrete person, for the bodies
fall like rain into the ground
and merge only to make an ocean
of bones and closed eyes, our identities
merged, as we had wanted
when we were persons
in each other's sight and touch. 

It is a beauteous evening, calm and free, 
The holy time is quiet as a nun 
Breathless with adoration; the broad sun 
Is sinking down in its tranquility; 
The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the sea: 
Listen! the mighty Being is awake, 
And doth with his eternal motion make 
A sound like thunder - everlastingly. 
Dear Child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here, 
If thou appear untouched by solemn thought, 
Thy nature is not therefore less divine: 
Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year, 
And worship'st at the Temple's inner shrine, 



It is useless to pour water
To a downward pot
Though it is necessarily critical 
In a drought of thirst

Person in pretence of sleep
It is difficult to wake up
Though it is necessarily critical
In a moment of danger

Adorable words accent and gestures
For the means of democracy
It is a witch of crazy
Though it is necessarily critical
In a state of power egoism

Forging smirking before the people
To conciliate hearts for votes and power
It is matter of fact today
Though it is necessarily critical
In a reflection before the mirror

Down to earth deconstruction
To purify the heart and mind
It is a matter of duty the day
Though it is necessarily critical
In the age of e- enlightenment


We fight for land
We fight for a brand
We fight for our stand
We fight on demand

O! Yeah! It is a rat race
So many more rats I have to face

In hundreds we crawl the city pavements
This rat era of industrial enslavement
Creeping through the tunnels of the underground
The rats are forever mass politically duty-bound
And with any new evolution
We wave ‘hello’ to a new revolution

O! Yeah! It is a rat race
Every little space is a crowded place

Some are going to work
Some are going for a walk
Some are looking for some luck
Some are trying to make a buck

We are pests of mother earth
Mass copulating until the sun sets
Thousands rave and party in music concerts
And in mass graves we acknowledge our deaths
With shame we cannot bury economic crisis
Even with many centuries of wars and peace

O! Yeah! It is a rat race
We keep on running at a fast pace

For the sake of acquiring education
Everywhere in mass congregations
We place ourselves in institutions
We scrounge the cities for daily food 
And a global circle of waste is regularly issued
To our environment! - We do more harm than we do good

We fight for fish
We fight for our dish
We fight for wishes
We fight and varnish with many images tarnished

O! Yeah! It is a rat race
A lasting curse of the human race

delicately branched and	
tapering conically	
to a point, each branch	
and the peak a wire for	        
green pods, blind lanterns	
starting upward from	
the stalk each way to	
a pair of prickly edged blue	
flowerets: it is her regard,	        
a little plant without leaves,	
a finished thing guarding	
its secret. Blue eyes—	
but there are twenty looks	
in one, alike as forty flowers	        
on twenty stems—Blue eyes	
a little closed upon a wish	
achieved and half lost again,	
stemming back, garlanded	
with green sacks of	        
satisfaction gone to seed,	
back to a straight stem—if	
one looks into you, trumpets—!	
No. It is the pale hollow of	
desire itself counting	        
over and over the moneys of	
a stale achievement. Three	
small lavender imploring tips	
below and above them two	
slender colored arrows	        
of disdain with anthers	
between them and	
at the edge of the goblet	
a white lip, to drink from—!	
And summer lifts her look	        
forty times over, forty times	
over—namelessly. 

It is a staion.
Passangers are here with their nessary belongings
Occupied a chair
And have a sigh of relief
It seems this chair is their own chair
They have it tenantent right
But as soon as their required train appeared
They entrain.
They do not look back
All their relatives shake their karchiefs
Some of them shed tears
Relatives and friends who come to bid adieu
They return their home
Because
They have also to make necessary arrangement
For a journey sometime later. 

Usually I have but one thought, 
A thought that you might ought, 
Not to have, 
But maybe just some of the time. 

As you get older, 
You will find that your mind begins to wander, 
But no matter how far it goes, 
Something still wants me to take off my clothes. 

You know, I miight now get in a little trouble, 
Especially if I'm found by the other guy. 

Love knows no bounds, 
Lust has no disguise, 

But if I must make a boast, 
This is just a simple toast, 

I do it for sometihing I must love most. 
Something that grants me pleasure, 
Every minute of everyday, 
I think about and with all might, 
I just pleasure with prue delight. 

Now, you may wonder what this is, 
What could so wonderous that would cause this among us, 

I'm here to tell you, that no single person 
Would do this for you, 
I'm talking about something that will make your life 
so different, 
All I ask in return is that you pass this along, 
This is not even a person at all, 
After all of this fuss, 
The single thing I do the best, 
Is just get a good night's rest

It is as if she is lost, 
while on the piano she plays a fugue
and sick of arguing feeling like a rogue
she plays on as if she’s at an outpost

where living cost 
do not matter and every colleague
do not scatter away, as if she has the plague
and she’s near to the end, almost

finished, when the phone starts to ring, 
with its consistency shattering her peace
and she answers and listens to the chattering, 
looking through the window to find quick release
from the building tension, she notices that it’s spring
and the voice trails on and on, like a spreading disease. 

It is beautiful
To be a man
It is wonderful
For a man to love a woman
For such a handsome soul
I feel good to be truthful
It is not them versus us
I am comfortable in my skin
The sky is blue and the grass is green
Things happen for a reason
It is not open season
On bashing or fighting each other
On the contrary, Mother Nature
Is happy, when we stand together
When we are mature and clever
To respect and appreciate the wonders
That the Creator gave us, the sinners
The ingrates, the hypocrites, and the backstabbers
Regardless, we are brothers and sisters
It is wonderful
To be a man
It is beautiful
When a woman loves a man. 



It is easy to read and to recite; 
It is hard to practice what one reads, 
And, reading seek out the Self within. 
By constant practice, not by books, 
Conviction grew in my heart 

At times, it is ok to take a break
To chill, unwind, calm down and to relax
We work, think, read, write and fax
We must cool off to be more efficient.

Take a deep breath to walk around the plant
Around the office, after lunch or after brunch
Life is not simple; we have to do a bunch
Yes, it is fine after overworking our brain
We need to calm the nerves and to sooth the pain. 

America, the home of the Brave, the land of the Free, 
And the haven of the Weak for countless centuries, 
Is being run by the racists, the tweets, and the crazies, 
Who only and simply care about power and money.

The Lady of Liberty is sobbing; presently suffering.
This is a very strange thing to see and to witness.
Every day, many proud Americans are protesting, 
Because America has become selfish and ruthless.

In the glare of the violence, which is spreading
In the world, America will always be the safest
Place on earth. America will always be the greatest
Nation. Let the bells of Freedom and Unity ring.


Democracy is America's forte. Let spread the seeds of Love.
Let's not spray the venom of hate, racism, and division.
What's happening in America again is not from above; 
It is the imagination of the disguised devils in action.

America has endured enough. Let's not fool America.
What's happening again in America is not acceptable.
America deserves better. Things are really deplorable.
America should not go back again to the old agenda.

Let Freedom reign among the chaos and confusion.
Let the bells of Liberty ring to absorb pain and deception.
Let the stars shine to illuminate the smile of America.
America should not go back again to the wicked agenda.

It is inhumane for a man or a woman
To think that he or she can own another person
It is ungodly for such a monster to fathom
That he or she can own the Kingdom.

In the eyes of the Creator
All men and women are created equal.
Belittling or bullying another creature
Of the Almighty is an abominable horror.

It is sinful to inferiorize one another
We are all the offspring of Mother Nature.
We are all related by the air
That we breathe and by the spirit in our soul. 



It is love calling love.

Love flings open a door

to unite itself with the soul.

He is no farther than the door of your heart.
There He stands patiently for the one
who opens the door and let him in.

He can hardly wait for you to open up.
He longs for you a thousand times
more than you long for him.

The opening and the entering are a single act.

com)It is March and black dust falls out of the books
Soon I will be gone
The tall spirit who lodged here has
Left already
On the avenues the colorless thread lies under
Old prices

When you look back there is always the past
Even when it has vanished
But when you look forward
With your dirty knuckles and the wingless
Bird on your shoulder
What can you write

The bitterness is still rising in the old mines
The fist is coming out of the egg
The thermometers out of the mouths of the corpses

At a certain height
The tails of the kites for a moment are
Covered with footsteps

Whatever I have to do has not yet begun


I might not know to cook that dish you await, 
Or to prepare the drink you love, 
I can't even dance the way you want-
But love, there is no one, 
Or ever wil be, 
That can touch your heart, 
Or Gently kiss every part of your soul
Only one can make you feel, 
that something you do not know
It is me, who really sees you, among the whole world. 

I pray to you lord
now in silence.

All around me, 
the nature is sleeping.


I am here awake
to converse with you.
You are in the heavens
but you are here also.
You are immanent
and ever near to me.

But  sometimes 
you seem to be so far away.
I am sure, in my darkness 
you will come to me as light.
In my sadness you are 
my comforter. 

When you take away a life
With the aid of a knife

It is murder

While you extinguish the living with a gun
Without being able to recreate what was born

It is murder

If you feed someone dead tablets
Later have second acrimonious regrets

It is murder

You are taking away a life
It is clinging on to survive
Need I say anymore further
It is murder

Murder sprung by a fling
With ropes or a string
Your hands only bring
Death around a necks ring

Execution by suffocation
Condemned with abomination
Deliberate foetus termination

It is murder

Make no mistake, 
Be careful
Asleep or awake! 
Murder is unlawful

If death occurs  because of the effects of an evil curse
I will say this with my lips pursed
'What a great loss, but this is not murder! 

The Eternal and Merciful
is my goal to reach.

It is my soul's quest
to reach him one day.

It is the joy of my soul
It is the joy of my being.
I live here on earth 
to achieve these moments.

For the priest, the warrior.  the tradesman, and all the
It is but folly to ask what the caste of a saint may be; 
The Rishi Swapacha was a tanner by caste.
Hindus and Moslems alike have achieved that End, where remains no mark of distinction. 

IT is no Spirit who from heaven hath flown,
And is descending on his embassy;
Nor Traveller gone from earth the heavens to espy!
'Tis Hesperus--there he stands with glittering crown,
First admonition that the sun is down!
For yet it is broad day-light: clouds pass by;
A few are near him still--and now the sky,
He hath it to himself--'tis all his own.
O most ambitious Star! an inquest wrought
Within me when I recognised thy light; 
A moment I was startled at the sight:
And, while I gazed, there came to me a thought
That I might step beyond my natural race
As thou seem'st now to do; might one day trace
Some ground not mine; and, strong her strength above,
My Soul, an Apparition in the place,
Tread there with steps that no one shall reprove

It is not a word spoken,
Few words are said;
Nor even a look of the eyes
Nor a bend of the head,

But only a hush of the heart
That has too much to keep,
Only memories waking
That sleep so light a sleep. 

It is not easy to
Remain human 
Live like a saint
Behave like god 
Shed the desires
For contentment
Of the soul
Sacrifice needs
For peace
Make the heart 
As hard as a rock
Control the emotions
In difficult situations
Give away comforts
Live a simple life 
See all humans 
With the same eye
Dr. 

Rajendra Tela, Nirantar(You say)  It is not love, it is madness
My madness may be the cause of your fame
Sever not my relationship with you
If nothing then be my enemy
What is the meaning of notoriety in meeting me
If not in public court meet me alone
I am not my own enemy
So what if the stranger is in love with you
Whatever you are, it is due to your own being
If this not known then it is ignorance
Life though fleets like a lightening flash
Yet it is abundant Time to be in love
I do not want debate on the sustenance of love
Be it not love but another dilemma
Give something O biased One
At least the sanction to cry and plea
I will perpetuate the rituals
Even if cruelty be your habit
Teasing and cajoling the beloved cannot leave 'Asad'
Even if there is no union and only the desire remains.   


It is not to be thought of that the Flood 
   Of British freedom, which, to the open sea
   Of the world's praise, from dark antiquity
   Hath flowed, "with pomp of waters, unwithstood,"
   Roused though it be full often to a mood
   Which spurns the check of salutary bands,
   That this most famous Stream in bogs and sands
   Should perish; and to evil and to good
   Be lost for ever. In our halls is hung
  Armoury of the invincible Knights of old:
  We must be free or die, who speak the tongue
  That Shakespeare spake; the faith and morals hold
  Which Milton held.--In every thing we are sprung
  Of Earth's first blood, have titles manifold. 

It is not too early to sing
It is not too early to sing, 
In many exotic tongues.

This is not the time to play, 
This is the season to pray.
Let's sing joyful songs, 
In many exotic tongues.

This is the time to be jolly, 
This is the season to be happy.
Let's play many positives roles, 

Papa Noel is hiding in the chimney, 
Do not add more fuel to the foyer, 
So you won't burn the messenger, 
Who is bringing more gifts in the manger.

He will always be younger
Than Mother Nature.

This is the time to be jolly, 
This is the season to be happy.
Let's sing peaceful songs, 
In many exotic tongues. 

Why should I stop, why? 
the birds have gone in search 
of the blue direction. 
the horizon is vertical, vertical 
and movement fountain-like; 
and at the limits of vision 
shining planets spin. 
the earth in elevation reaches repetition, 
and air wells 
changes into tunnels of connection; 
and day is a vastness, 
which does not fit into narrow mind 
of newspaper worms.

why should I stop? 
the road passes through the capillaries of life, 
the quality of the environment 
in the ship of the uterus of the moon 
will kill the corrupt cells. 
and in the chemical space after sunrise 
there is only sound, 
sound that will attract the particles of time. 
why should I stop?

what can a swamp be? 
what can a swamp be but the spawning ground 
of corrupt insects? 
swollen corpses scrawl the morgue's thoughts, 
the unmanly one has hidden 
his lack of manliness in blackness, 
and the bug.  ah, 
when the bug talks, 
why should I stop? 
cooperation of lead letters is futile,
it will not save the lowly thought. 
I am a descendant of the house of trees. 
breathing stale air depresses me. 
a bird which died advised me to 
commit flight to memory. 
the ultimate extent of powers is union, 
joining with the bright principle of the sun 
and pouring into the understanding of light. 
it is natural for windmills to fall apart.

why should I stop? 
I clasp to my breast 
the unripe bunches of wheat 
and breastfeed them

sound, sound, only sound, 
the sound of the limpid wishes 
of water to flow,
the sound of the falling of star light 
on the wall of earth's femininity 
the sound of the binding of meaning's sperm 
and the expansion of the shared mind of love. 
sound, sound, sound, 
only sound remains.

in the land of dwarfs, 
the criteria of comparison 
have always traveled in the orbit of zero. 
why should I stop? 
I obey the four elements; 
and the job of drawing up 
the constitution of my heart 
is not the business 
of the local government of the blind.

what is the lengthy whimpering wildness 
in animals sexual organs to me? 
what to me is the worm's humble movement 
In its fleshy vacuum? 
the bleeding ancestry of flowers 
has committed me to life. 
are you familiar with the bleeding 
ancestry of the flowers

It is only you, I want, more than your peace and rest.
More than parched lands seek the din and clamor of a burst of cloud, with no show of mercy. 
Even if you blaze like a storm, dark clouds of age -long desire seek their due in exchange, 
Like a dogged crane not faltering in its direction, veer in gusts of wind to find my bearing, 
Till you exhaust your despair and dark discontent, 
Till you deign to shower me with your forgiving largesse and grace 
That I have once seen extend from your large hands.
If your eyes flash in anger like lightning, it shall only work to light our path
And kindle the lamp of love and help me to steady us onwards.
If you roar and thunder and hold me captive with your concerns, 
To you I shall cling like a child in terror. 
It is only you I want more than your peace and rest.

It is only you I want to breathe life into my tired limbs with your one word
And take away the weariness of the road.
Grace me with your presence, holding high your torch of stead-fastness
To make a bonfire of all those absences and despair of many partings
Like the autumn leaves paving the doorway to our hearts.
Let us dust away and let new buds blossom
In the game of chance, be no more,  pawns of pleasure and pain 
Let new colors flush out heart-longings, but their perfume betray not our secrets.
If you know I have been down this path before, yet here I remain.
Let me hand over the helms into your able hands
Come like the realization of my dreams and the fulfillment of my destiny.
Only then I shall be ready to share silences when you ask me to shut the door behind me.

It is only You I want to help me cross this threshold of life 
With freedoms only afforded to me by you.
Break into my veil of pride, pushing it aside see me decked 
in my ornaments of imperfections and anxieties.
Spare a moment's indulgence, sit by me side by side, face to face, 
Let me then entrust myself to your safe-keeping with a surrender of will.
You have been mine once before, claimed by the same yearning eyes
Come find out what it's like to claim me once and for all by reaching out to me this once.
It is only you that I want, to enter my life like the spring 
That presses and pushes its warm signet over the cold fingers of winter.
Come let me repay your silent forbearance with my signature of submission
Till it echoes with joy from star to star and releases the music 
Sealed by the lips of the moon in a wordless world of silence.

h June-hank you for letting me know 
That it is over
Now, I must fight like a hero
To recover
From my pain
I must cry like an infant
Who holds no grudges
I must go forward like an ant
Skipping hurdles and bridges.

It is over
Means good-bye
I will get over
And that's no lie
I am strong in spirit
This. I do not deserve this
I am in pain. I will miss
Your mannerisms, your charms
I will miss sleeping in your arms.

It is over
I feel like a zero
With a crazy numero
I must be better
I must swallow 
My bitter sorrow
I must not be a coward
I must go forward
Like a missile
It is a done deal
It is over, it is over
I am now your ex-lover. 

It’s so good to be someones’ forever, 
it’s so good to know that you are loved, 
to know that your heart is so clever
and shares everything with your beloved.

It’s so good to be someones’ forever, 
to know that your beloved will never lie, 
to know that your beloved will always share
up to the end, up to the day you die.

It’s so good to hug the loving body, 
to be together days and nights, 
to feel the ice as a real hotty, 
to dream together of the flights.

It’s so good to flow together
like streamlets in an early spring, 
to feel yourself as a light feather
which is a part of an eagle wing.

It’s so good to warm you and be warmed, 
to fresh each other as a rain, 
to see in dear eyes love storms, 
to travel life in one comfortable train.

he Mexicans are celebrating
The Indians are celebrating
The Haitians are celebrating
The Europeans are celebrating
The Africans are celebrating
The Asians are celebrating
The Canadians are celebrating
The Americans are celebrating
Everybody is celebrating
In the United States of America
However, the turkeys are not happy
Because they will be forced to attend the gala
They will be well seasoned, baked, fried or cooked
At the table, the good, the bad, and the crooked
Will be eating like there is no tomorrow
Nobody will be skinny or unhappy
There will be no room for sorrow
This is Thanksgiving Day again
This is when everyone is in Heaven
And some turkeys will receive presidential pardon.

I wish every day was like that
When the world gets together
In the United States of America
To count our blessings, to pray
And to give THANKS. 

Contemplate on the clouds.
See and learn from it.

All  the elements of nature
teach us about the eternal being
from whose creative hand
every element  flows.

Meditate on the clouds.
Clouds are like dreams.
They take us to a dreamy world 
and then leave us in reality.

We understand and do not understand
the designs of the wonderful nature.

It is the creator's wisdom
It is the mystery of the unfathomable.




It is the sinners' dust-tongued bell claps me to churches
When, with his torch and hourglass, like a sulpher priest,
His beast heel cleft in a sandal,
Time marks a black aisle kindle from the brand of ashes,
Grief with dishevelled hands tear out the altar ghost
And a firewind kill the candle.

Over the choir minute I hear the hour chant:
Time's coral saint and the salt grief drown a foul sepulchre
And a whirlpool drives the prayerwheel;
Moonfall and sailing emperor, pale as their tide-print,
Hear by death's accident the clocked and dashed-down spire
Strike the sea hour through bellmetal.

There is loud and dark directly under the dumb flame,
Storm, snow, and fountain in the weather of fireworks,
Cathedral calm in the pulled house;
Grief with drenched book and candle christens the cherub time
From the emerald, still bell; and from the pacing weather-cock
The voice of bird on coral prays.

Forever it is a white child in the dark-skinned summer
Out of the font of bone and plants at that stone tocsin
Scales the blue wall of spirits;
From blank and leaking winter sails the child in colour,
Shakes, in crabbed burial shawl, by sorcerer's insect woken,
Ding dong from the mute turrets.

I mean by time the cast and curfew rascal of our marriage,
At nightbreak born in the fat side, from an animal bed
In a holy room in a wave;
And all love's sinners in sweet cloth kneel to a hyleg image,
Nutmeg, civet, and sea-parsley serve the plagued groom and bride
Who have brought forth the urchin grief. 

These are the streets where we walked with war and childhood
Like our two shadows behind us, or
Before us like one shadow.
                                       River walks
Threaded by park rats, flanked by battleships,
Flickering of a grey tail on the bank,
Motionless hulls
Enormous under a dead grey sky.
Farther, the harbor and the miscolored waters
Rocking their flotsam under the blank round eye
At the masthead staring down the rats to come,
Beyond the fisher gulls.
And the windows full of ropes and hardware,
Doorways, barreled, yawning on the dark,
Wall-eyed alleys, coils of husky smells,
The breath of journeys strong there.
Streets whose sordid beauty
                                        joked readily with hope.
The taller avenues,
And walls that smiled like unpurchased horizons,
Swung intimate views out of a foreign room,
Hung a gate upon a garden's fable,
Walls that frowned
With aged remorseless eyes
Or the gloom of thunderlit landscapes, opening
A door into that placeless country
Where the sad animal is blithe, free and at home.
Too, those halls
Where we stepped lightly among the creatures
Whom death had tamed, who yet crouched, sprang, or flew,
Fierce as hunger, graceful as joy,
Until we knew, as in a half silvered mirror, the half
Captive image of immortality.
These are the old places, and walking there
As then with war and childhood, I look into the shadows' faces.
They appal.
                Yet often I will see
(The marvels floating alive upon that stream,
The breathing of delight like purest air)
Another place: that you contrived
Between midnight and morning
In your dream, and in the morning
Took me there.
                     We greeted it, who could not stay.


But it is there,
Surviving disbelief, surviving even what the malign years prepare. 

O' the chieftain who has the mountain land 
surrounded with huge rocks 
where the same species of  male monkeys 
that tears the bee hives for honey! 

Instead of getting in huge numbers whatsoever many 
waiting after a very long time duration if any, 
It is always better to get these things in a short time 
even these are only a very few to the size of a millet! 

So to say, no one is there to sow the Palmyra fruit now, 
And willing to eat it later after a long number of years! 
Hence it is wisely advised to fetch the benefit, 
However small that comes early in a short period

You who formed my inmost being
You who entered the womb of my mother
You whose breath gave me life
You who opened my eyes
to see the first light, 
it is You whom i adore
in the innermost recess of my heart.



Woman, let me demystify you, 
So I can see why I love you 
So much.
Let me search: 
The curves, the preserves, 
The gardens and the reserves, 
So I can understand
Why every second
That you flash in my memory, 
The chemical formula changes in my body.

Turn around; 
You're safe and sound.
Let me examine you from head to toes: 
Touch your nose, 
Cover your cheeks, 
Do some tricks, 
Try to fake it, 
Walk, run, stop and sit.
Oh! I'm beginning to see: 
It is your smile
That drives me crazy; 
It is your smile
That makes me feel so good.
Oh! My soul
Is engaged in a chaotic feud; 
I wonder if you are the divine doll
That I dreamt of the other night.
You are out of sight.
Your smile drives me crazy, 
Every day and every night, 
When I am lonely, 
When the sky is gloomy or bright
And when you gaze at me. 

Guys are supposed to be
the epitome of bravery
rough, tough and buff
but what are we to say 
about guys who often cower in fear, 
those who like tortoises shrink into their own shell
and fail to say they love you! 

Since time in memorial
mounting pressure has been added on guys
to prove themselves
over and over and over again! 
they have always had to make the first move! 

But, truth be told! 
even guys need that extra push! 
because no one is immune 
to the fear of rejection! 
we all need a sign of mutual affection! 
ever wondered why guys act like large fortified brick city walls, 
they've erected internal barriers 
in their hearts
they just can't express their feelings! 

And yet again; i say, it isn't easy
matter of fact, its a sorrowful sight
to see a guy who intensely loves a girl but can't even
find courage to express what eats him up at night
let alone the words to express how much he loves a girl

so, i appeal to you ladies
if a guy loves you, 
and you love him back 
sooth his petrified heart with a little confirmation of your love
every now and then
and he ought take it from there

Its kill's me to see
How cruel people can be
To them, they lay prejudice
As if it were a dependence
Only by intimidation they reign
Without that they are overly slain
And yet people lay scared
Its not like they cared 
Don't be afraid, and stand for enough
Let them no they aren't tough
I should i know, because it happened to me


It lingers in the air
No one wants to say
Just how much they want it to go away.

They ignore it
As if it wasn't there
Going on with their lives
Without a care.

It gets bigger and bigger
And then they snap.
They realize what has been done
They want to take it back.

It's too late now
It can't be fixed
They take a step back
To see the life they have missed.

What have I done? 
They ask, hoping to 
Reverse everything back
But it's too late.

But life goes on
What is done is done.
They lie to themselves so the feel
Like they still have won.
They can't face true defeat. 


While the mother was feeding the child, 
She used to tell the child, ‘you marry the Pandya King’! 

While the child grew well into a teen beautiful girl, 
She understood that it was imaginary and impossible! 
 
It made me deceptive like the oasis in the backdrop 
of the grove along the sea shore


It might just be
that what I say
in casual conversation, 
unthinking, 
and unaware, 
is entirely
and completely
probable.

Be it today
tomorrow
or yesterday, 
what I said is true. 


We will be what we could be. Do not say, 
"It might have been, had not this, or that, or this
 

No fate can keep us from the chosen way; 
He only might who is. 

We will do what we could do. Do not dream 
Chance leaves a hero, all uncrowned to grieve. 
I hold, all men are greatly what they seem; 
He does, who could achieve. 

We will climb where we could climb. Tell me not 
Of adverse storms that kept thee from the height. 
What eagle ever missed the peak he sought? 
He always climbs who might. 

I do not like the phrase "It might have been!" 
It lacks force, and life's best truths perverts: 
For I believe we have, and reach, and win, 
Whatever our deserts.

The sky is well-lighted with bright stars
The streets are littered with shiny cars
The motorists are playing Xmas carols
The children are excited ‘cause Mr. Claus
Papa Noel is coming in person tonight
To bring toys to boys who did not fight
This year and gifts to girls and gals
Who have been good all year long
Let's sing along, let's sing this song
Peace to the World, Love to the Universe
Like Nat King Cole; there is no need to rehearse.


It nods and curtseys and recovers 
When the wind blows above, 
The nettle on the graves of lovers 
That hanged themselves for love. 

The nettle nods, the wind blows over, 
The man, he does not move, 
The lover of the grave, the lover 
That hanged himself for love. 

It once happened
that a child was spared punishment
through earnest solicitation.
 



It rained every day
after you left
a natural mourning ensued
accompanied by stillness
the eerie quiet that often precedes
a natural disaster.

Things that once brought me joy
wash away each afternoon
Rivulets of pain wash my senses
a canopy of clouds
hover like a conspirators plotting my misery

Eagerly I give myself over to sadness
Finding empathy in the rainy afternoon

It seem both the days and I have cause to grieve
at the loss of a loved one. 

Haunted droplets of silver rain
Falling from the sullen eyes
Of shattered dreams and pain
Within a man misunderstood.

Silent screams from deep within
A hopeful battered soul abused
By time reflecting life's embrace
So tight my hearts lost all hope.

Despair replaces emotions of old
Childish illusions of innocence past, 
Born from the bosom of a deceptive world
That gives substance to its own tortures.

Pray for life to imitate the dreams
Of fantasy behind the curtains of your eyes, 
Yet horror awaits for the curtain must open, 
I have awoke to another day.


And so it rains.  

It rains in my heart
as on town and on mart, 
pours down longings that start
to reign in my heart! 

Oh soft ringing of rain
poured on earth, eave and pane, 
for poor heart feeling pain, 
oh the ringing of rain! 

It rains without reason
in hurt heart fears have lease on.
What? - no season for treason? 
Do I grieve without reason? 

What most hurts me, I wait
‘Why’ not knowing, sad fate, 
without love, without hate, 
On my heart lies deadweight! 





Meant to be 
on a business course but of course

he was a Wimpy chief
in a Wimpy bar.

Me I was a Wimpy
waitress.

He was mine & I was his.

Neighbours complained
that a black man was(shock horror)  

coming & going! 

This was after all. & Jumpin’ Jack Flash was a gas gas gas.

Revolution was in the air.

Other tenants
voted to have me evicted.

I fought it tooth and nail
to no avail

& they got me
on the colour thing

said I had painted
the bedroom wall
(against the rules)  

a shocking
deep puce. 


It's a new day
Another chance to discover
And rediscover
And make changes
And enjoy life.

A chance to reach out.
A chance to hold on
To the things that are dear.
It's a new day
Another opportunity.

A chance to live
And love
And laugh; 
The chance of a lifetime.
I see that I have died
I change my bed
And then I change myself


My friend
Is not my friend any more
She has secrets from me
And goes about with Tracy Hacket

I would get her back,
Only do not want to say so.
So I pretend
To have secrets from her
And go about with Alice Banks

But what bothers me is,
Maybe she is pretending
And would like me back
Only does not want to say so.

In which case
Maybe it bothers her
That I am pretending.
But if we are both pretending,
Then really we are friends
And do not know it.

On the other hand,
How can we be friends
And have secrets from each other
And go about with other people?

My friend
Is not my friend any more,
Unless she is pretending.
I cannot think what to do.
It is a puzzle. 

I can't remember 
the last time I heard that song 
but I do remember 
I cried then, too. 

It's not a sad song 
but the tears fall just the same, 
as though yesterday was 
caught in my throat and 
today is gum stuck to my shoe. 

I wanted to yell 
at the guy in the car 
to roll up his window 
and have a heart, 
because he was breaking mine. 

I only walk down this street
every now and again

tomorrow would be 
a kinder day to drive along 
playing that song. 


It's all in your mind, well of course it must be
It's not in your elbows, little toe or left knee
It's not in the hair that sprouts from the mole on your nose
And it's not in the place that smells like a rose
 
It's all in your mind, stuck fair and square in the middle
To oust it from this position, now that's quite a riddle
Because it's stuck in there with super glue, a great big dollop
To pull it out requires a bit of a wallop
 
But it can be done, yes it can, though not with brute force
Gently and carefully is always the best course
The glue should be melted to a moderate degree
And that thing will release and you will be free

 - My mother’s brother’s sister’s name is Grace
She’s my aunt and likes to go from place to place
My mother’s sister’s brother’s name is Brad
He’s my uncle and he is my cousin’s Dad

My grandmother on my mother’s side
Is my maternal gran, she is my grandfather’s bride
She also is my father’s mother-in-law
And not surprisingly they often go to war

My cousin is the nephew of my mother
His father happens to be my mother’s brother
My aunty’s niece is in fact myself
If you're confused please don't look at me for help

 - What sets you apart
from the best of the rest? 

What makes you the one
who outshines the sun? 

Honey, it's the soul in you. 
the soul in you. 

the soul in you



To the water im to go 
ocean sways so deep 
as i try to stay afloat 
still i start to weep 

when you stop to here my call 
i go into the dark 
to the bottom i start to fall 
and still you leave no mark 

my frozen fingers closed so tight 
veins laced with sticky drugs 
as you pick me up so light 
you are my drug my love 

Im gone now and were so far apart 
burried in dirt so deep 
but you'll forever have my heart 
its only yours to keep


I never told you that I was perfect
I merely stated that I will succeed
Even if I have to clean the dirty deck
Of your ignorance and your intolerance
I will be the first to stand up to lead
And to teach you things that you won’t find
In a book; it’s beautiful to be powerful and kind.

Power is funny, strange, elusive and temporary
Avoid stepping on people that you don’t need now
Tomorrow is decorated with surprises. Do no kick the cow
Let it eat the grass and the leaves that you use for tea
So its meat can be not only pretty, but delicious and tasty
Even if you are a vegetarian, Mother Nature needs
The spit and the dung to nourish the roots and the seeds.


I never told you that I was perfect
I simply said that you ring will not fit my neck. 

It's been so long since I last saw you. 
I am afraid that I may have forgotten
To seek your sight

In places that I go, 
Without my being there; 

You have been with me for so long. 
I no longer count the seasons, 
The quivery stars, the glances we imparted. 

I have been wandering through years, lost and alone; 
Alone with your phantom looking for you: 
It felt so lonely. 

Yet, not lonelier and desolate than now, 
When you seldom appear to me —
It's been so long my dearest. 

Sometimes, in my dreams, 
I wake up with a tear-drop dripping down my face: 
Washing you away, taking you farther from me.

I can no longer hold you
In this tired mind of mine the way I used to —
I lost you with losing myself. 

Being bereft of love; I am bereft of life —
You cannot survive in an empty shell.

For that is what I have become: 
An empty shell, rustling aimlessly, 
Like a mad ocean. 

A three dots 
A three lines
How would you put it each
And point to meet 
One and other
And each other



It's cold here.  
 Am, and here I am 
in a long line of people 
waiting to buy bread. 
It's cold here. 

Life has been so tough lately.  
I just hope today is not like 
those annoying days I have known
Where I had to go back home
Empty handed. 
It's cold here.

I once read a poem about people 
waiting inline for bread
and finding themselves 
in a hospital bed.
That’s if they get lucky, 
cus some get dead.
It really is cold here.

Anyways,  I just hope my day unravels 
in so many beautiful ways.
It’s so damn cold here.



I am writing these poems
From inside a lion,
And it's rather dark in here.
So please excuse the handwriting
Which may not be too clear.
But this afternoon by the lion's cage
I'm afraid I got too near.
And I'm writing these lines
From inside a lion,
And it's rather dark in here. 

It's Death again - He's always there -
Watching, waiting - e'er the stare! 
Every time I look behind
Or reach to pull the window blind, 
I catch a glimpse of grubby hood -
A little clue to where he stood; 
The glint of light that caught the scythe.
Perhaps if I could pay a tithe-
But O! no use, he'll never go.
The adamant phantom; don't you know 
He will but wait until it's time  
For me to hear His fateful chime? -
The toll that claims my destiny, 
To Hail: 'You're next, it has to be-'







The Reign of Death

Death death death death death death death
Death death death death death death death
Death death death death death death death
Death death death death death death death
Death death death death death death death
Death death death death death death death
Death death death death death death death
Death death death death death death death
Death death death death death death death
Death death death death death death death
Death death death death death death death
Death death death death death death death
Death death death death death death death


Have you ever figured out, 
It is not a question that comes about, 
When you just want to do it, 
You do, 
Nothing interferes or stops you! 

Then why not let others do it to? 
What are were all going to do? 

If by chance, 
You do not understand, 
Let me lead you gently with my hand, 
Guide you to the place where it all began. 

By this time it may sound funny, 
I remember my first and it was with honey. 

I poured it on, 
And it spread all over, 
I just could wait until I could devour it. 

I waited until I could stand it no more, 
I stood there in the kitchen, 
My knees were trembling and eyes were twitching, 
As I saw what I was about to eat, 
The picture of delight, 
I softly watched it in the light. 

Oh, how peanut butter and jelly 
Is augmented with honey

Regardless of your circumstances
It's great to feel good about yourself
You slept great last night on the shelf
You snored so loud that you broke the fences
Your neighbors did not call the Police
To shoot you because you were not nice
You had a great breakfast at IHOP
You must feel good listening to Hip-Hop
Songs, without hurting you tongue
If you're unhappy, you're wrong
You should feel good and blessed
With the Police; some are trigger-happy
Some will shoot you because you're freaky
Be happy, because you are alive and well
Life Is wonderful; la vie est belle
Be careful, enjoy life, enjoy today
Because today may be your last day
It's good to feel good
It's okay to enjoy good food. 

It’s good to feel you are close to me in the night, love,
invisible in your sleep, intently nocturnal,
while I untangle my worries
as if they were twisted nets.

Withdrawn, your heart sails through dream,
but your body, relinquished so, breathes
seeking me without seeing me perfecting my dream
like a plant that seeds itself in the dark.

Rising, you will be that other, alive in the dawn,
but from the frontiers lost in the night,
from the presence and the absence where we meet ourselves,

something remains, drawing us into the light of life
as if the sign of the shadows had sealed
its secret creatures with flame. 

I counted the wrinkles in her hands 
Whom life had subtly passed by.
She got no visits and no mail, 
No one phoned her to say hi.

On the table by the window, 
A lovely portrait of her youth.       
With feeble hands she caressed
The image that so seemed to soothe.

I promised sometimes with her to visit
And to think of her each day.
It's her time now, but mine will come; 
For I shall wear her shoes some day.
Yes, I shall wear her shoes one day
In Fact, we all shall pass that way.

but I cannot sing you the song.

I want to compose an arrangement
but my abilities are gone.

I want to write you a poem
but a poem I could not recite.

I want to be yours
but your heart is not mine.

For I’m in love with someone else
and although I think of you
repeatedly, in my mind
and between your thighs
I’m in love with someone else
meaning it’s impossible.

So you have got to let me go
in the opposite direction.
You have got to let me go
and show her affection.

‘Cause it hurts her to know
that I love you in my mind.
It hurts her so much to know
that you have had my time.

The fact that I have laid with you
kills all the trust that she has for me
‘cause she knows
and it takes away all the love she could give.

Please let me go, 
just let me go.

It’s impossible for me to love you
this way, it’s just impossible. 

The books are everywhere from wall to wall 
My fingertips are filled with ecstasy
As my mind is lusting for knowledge
They say a picture is worth a thousand words
So it must be the same with words and visa verse
With every paragraph the images invades my thoughts
I see everything that is happening like I am there myself
Going through all of the pain and heartache, the love and joy
Thirsting to know what else is going to happen next
Growing impatient with my eyes as I read
As my hands is more than eagered to turn the next page
Ready to jump into the next adventure that comes with every chapter
To meet all of the new faces and people as the story goes on
To find out what their reasoning was for doing what they was doing
Hating the fact that with every turn of the page I come closer to the end
Until you come to the end of the book and the journey has ended
You hate leaving but it is closing time the lights are being shut off
But tomorrow is a new day, a new book, and a new adventure


I had just accidentally smashed 
my boyfriend Howard in the forehead
with a horseshoe. The blood surged 
through his eight year old fingers, 
dripping down his face. I screamed, 
dropped the horseshoe and spun
to race towards the house, 
'No, don't tell anyone! ' He tried to 
block me from reaching grown-ups 
and help.

I remember looking into his eyes, 
and seeing blind love, and fear.
He could forgive me any pain I would
ever cause him, and deny it as well.
If they found out he thought, 
then our love was lost.  Even now
I'm amazed, how love can survive, 
in spite of all our visible
and hidden scars. 

Shit! 

Another year – a terse reminder.

Shit! 

Another tear; I need a blinder – 
Blur the brain of time
And unrelenting age.

O! to be a hero: honed, a sage of life; 
Not an ever-ancient me, 
Ticking over on a mug of pills, 
Holidaying at the ward 
(Drowning in a sea of stagnant piss) .

So rest assured, unless I’m cured of 
Groaning limbs, a crumbling back and 
Fading mind, 
Whims of being young again are crass, 
And show me blind.
 
So sod off! and leave me here alone
To face another birthday.  
 
Shit! 

Shit! 



birthday birthday birthday, birthday birthday birthday, 
It's me bloody birthday
birthday birthday birthday, birthday birthday birthday, 
It's me bloody birthday
birthday birthday birthday, birthday birthday birthday, 
It's me bloody birthday


On a cold and windy night, you can
hear the rustle through the trees. 
The moon is shining, oh so bright, 
as you make your way, through
the fallen leaves. The air is brisk
all around you, confirming, winter
is on it's way. You're very glad
you dressed real warm, to keep
the cold and wind, at bay. It can
be a beautiful time of the year, 
when a blanket of snow, falls on
the ground. Lovely snowflakes, 
with their odd little shapes, are 
blowing all around. Yes, winter is
a wonderland, with the color of
white, glistening for all to see.
But alas and alak, because I
live down south, it's never, 
going to happen, to me

facade

Dared you said, 
Yes to death! 

Brave enough, 
Died you once and forever.

Look back-

I’m alive, 
Still alive; 

Dying thousands of death.

Each day die I, 
Each day slaughtered; 

Moments I cry-
Moments I smile-

Am I strong enough to die, 
These thousands of death? 
it's not yet a death. 
when yesterdays are still alive.  

At all, It's not fair, 
You desire early death 
Ah northern air

The sun will not stop shining
The moon will not appear less bright
The earth will not stop turning
And the heaven will not display less light.

You said: It's over; no it is not over
The seasons keep on changing
The trees keep getting taller 
And the leaves are greener this spring.

No, it is not over, there are four seasons
Things happen for different reasons
Some monkeys can barely control their emotions
And words can be as powerful as actions.

It's not over as long as we are alive
As long as babies are being born
There is hope, let's resonate the horn

Ervin Lupoe blamed it all on the economy, 
He executed his wife,daughters and sons, 
Before he committed suicide.
He was obviously a troubled man; 
he placed importance on the dollar, 
Above all else; 
above everybody, 
He was troubled beyond what he wrote in his letter, 
He was facing a mid-life crisis with his job loss, 
His wife had lost her job, 
But this murder-suicide is much more than that, 
It is about greed, 
low self-esteem, 
the preponderance of negative news coverage, 
It is about the way of American life gone badly.
Endemic for all socio-economic classes, 
I hope that this will be an isolated circumstance, 
After all did Ervin forget about the ‘Great Depression’? 
What would have been to outcome if all people, 
who were out a job, 
did the same thing? 
I wouldn’t be here, 
to shed a tear, 
for his family.

("You’re doing it wrong! "
"You can’t do anything right! "
Echo’s through your ears once more.  
Coming with is tears that try to exit your eyes. 
But some how are held back. 
And the punch in the face, 
You weren’t expecting you didn’t think, 
You had to defend yourself against, 
The people who brought you up all these years! 

A rumor goes around the h grade. 
A month or two before your h Birth day. 
But your friends kept it from you, 
Because they know it’s not true. 
So unaware you walk in that familiar door alone,  
Except for one other, 
Everyone outside working, 
Big log truck is unloading, 
So everyone is unable to hear your screams of fear 
Thinking this time she might not stop and death might be near. 
Painful screams from objects hitting you tiny body. 
With such a hard force it breaks skin. 
No one hears you all they see is "you falling down the stairs! "  
Someone comes to your aid but doesn’t know.
No one will ever know that was there that day.

You’re nearly grown years old. 
Less then a month till your h Birth day. 
The punishments have gotten worse but, 
Not as often over the years. 
years their fist against your skin. 
But nothing prepared you for the one about to be laid upon you. 
The force.. the length.. 
Yes you did wrong, yes you needed discipline, 
But to that extent? 
It was almost too much for your b body to take. 
It sent you to the hospital but of course, 
You crashed your quad.      

All these years, all of them you, 
Hide it inside, only you and your siblings knew. 
Thought it was just something that happened. 
And it was O. 



Ran away
My limits
Of tolerance
Still inside
My body
With you
Now my tolerance
Is not that
What I had

You don’t know
That I am changed
You think
That I am controlled

The body I keep here
Only a statue 
The life in it
Was chased by you

You know only
One thing
I know only 
One thing
It is not tolerance


In a fast-paced world, 
Trying to stay on top, 
You push, push, push—
Push until you drop.

Trying to take advantage
Of every op—
Determined to let nothing
Hinder or stop.

You work, work, work; 
Work up lots of stress.
But just remember—
It’s okay to rest.
just before they get to us 
that space 
that fine relaxer 
the breather 
while say 
flopping on a bed 
thinking of nothing 
or say 
pouring a glass of water from the 
spigot 
while entranced by 
nothing 

that 
gentle pure 
space 

it's worth 

centuries of 
existence 

say 

just to scratch your neck 
while looking out the window at 
a bare branch 

that space 
there 
before they get to us 
ensures 
that 
when they do 
they won't 
get it all 

ever. 



You broke my heart
So many times
Was he sweeter? 
Is he better? 
Was the grass greener? 
On the other side? 
Wipe your eyes
Please don't cry
You meet a monster
Clever like Dracula
Please don't bother me
I am eating lobster
With my brother
I hate your sorry lines
And the stupid lies
Get another guy
My love bye, bye
Shut the door
I need time to recover
Sorry it's over


What.
Can.
Prevent this stuff.

Pandemonium! 
What.
Has. 
Started this to erupt.
With a doing it done to numb.
And people shooting guns, 
Thinking they can end. 
Stopping more to come.

(It's)  Pandemonium! 
Oh oh.
People devouring fear.
(It's)  Pandemonium! 
Oh oh.
People trying to hide tears.
It is pandemonium.
Oh oh.
Afraid everybody appears.
Restless.
And uptight.
Crazed with their minds out of gear.

It is pandemonium.
Oh oh.
What has started this stuff.
It is pandemonium.
Oh oh.
When is too much enough.
People everywhere seem crazed.
And. 
Nuts out of touch. 

Hate is far more than the opposite of Love, 
It is an awfully mournful feeling of destruction, of
Evilness, of selfishness, of a negative passion
To harm or maim our fellow men or women.
To like someone does not mean "not to love lightly"; 
"Like" is a coded word with a blended signification, 
It can also mean hating someone or something mildly.
When love is in motion, the heart is open for positive passion
And immeasurable admiration; the blood is flowing
Like an intermittent April shower on a Sunday afternoon: 
The sky is blue and inviting; the birds are chirping; 
The toddlers playing; and the lovers strolling 
Under the heavenlike splendor of a romantic moon.
To hate is to lose. Haters are financially and spiritually
Very poor. They are overly aggressive, godawfully bossy, 
And vilely revengeful, while having an elephant like memory.
Those losers are selfish, they fool themselves by thinking 
That they are perfect, and the universe is beneath their feet. 
Yet the biggest danger is when they assemble or congregate, 
And they have followers who obey their wicked orders.
Today’s world has no room for extrovertly hate-mongers or haters.
It is beautiful to love, while it is pitiful and humiliating to hate. 

I don't know what it is,
but I distrust myself
when I start to like a girl
 a lot. 

It's ringing the cellphone, continuous
Sound neutral, unconcerned the kitchen is

 It's ringing the cellphone, continuous
The road is surrounded by Gold-rain-trees, a private car 
Pharmacist is on the way home, driving

 It's ringing the cellphone, continuous
Ears are engaged with Tagore songs, fingers with Facebook; 

 It's ringing the cellphone, continuous
Cellphone: a luxurious misinvention of this century

 It's ringing the cellphone, continous
Congrats! Congrats! 

 It's ringing the cellphone, continuous, and stops
At the distance of a light years, there is a disappointed sigh


No reply. 

Come on, come on dear
Forget about your pain
Look at the bright side
For it is spring again
After the months of winter
Cool breeze and clouds
Here comes the season
Of the lovely spring
That surely gives reason
To live with joy and fain
And welcome your life
Where happiness smile survive
So come on my dear
And forget about your pain
And look at the bright side
For it is spring again. 

It's starting again
Thought I'd get better 
But, 	
It's starting again
Apathy larger than 
The strength I need to begin
Heavy clouds
Blocking out the sun
The storm starts faster than I can run
But I like the rain
Always have
Maybe part of me wants it to come back


It is the glamour, my amour, 
Your sense of style, and your smile.
The way you stroll daily on the aisle, 
And the image that you flash that I adore.

The stars that illumine your eyes, 
The flowers that you wear during the day, 
And the interesting chat that inspires
The Poet in awe, along the way.

It’s the intangibility of the dreams, 
That will not go with the magic rug, 
And your gentle genre of raising steams
Around me that enhances the beauty of the fog.

And to inhale your angelic scent. The aroma
Of your mental breath softens the onomatopoeia, 
That is part of the landscape and the dew.

It’s the glamour, mon amour, 
The essence of being happy with you, 
The silhouette that I genuinely adore, 
And the thought that you want me too. 

NO MORE; 
Dip, the chalice of my heart in raging seas for a drop, 
Burn passions to cinders in moonlit bonfires, throb, 
That coy reserve of mine, wander the yard between us, 
Find you in small truths thrown by falsehood of time or distance, 
No more, refute the footfall of memories, lying to my face, 
Suspect, the ways of the world that bled the path it tread, 
Skies bend hard, to grasp the elusive shores retreating hand, 
Or in their vigilant wake, stars unite us in their heady garland, 
Or the beauty of my thoughts build in your solitary mind, 
Walk the tight- rope of faith unknown, trust, our binding thread, 
NO MORE shall Soothsayer’s ineptness, tuck me in bed. 
Like the rainbow is the storm’s passing stride, 
It’s the hour of the groom and the bride.




It’s the sweet law of men
They make wine from grapes
They make fire from coal
They make men from kisses

It’s the true law of men
Kept intact despite
the misery and war
despite danger of death

It’s the warm law of men
To change water to light
Dream to reality
Enemies to friends

A law old and new
That perfects itself
From the child’s heart’s depths
To reason’s heights. 

I stand in the advancing light,
my hands hungry, the world beautiful.

My eyes can't get enough of the trees--
they're so hopeful, so green.

A sunny road runs through the mulberries,
I'm at the window of the prison infirmary.

I can't smell the medicines--
carnations must be blooming nearby.

It's this way:
being captured is beside the point,
the point is not to surrender.
 
 
From the mystique grey and tender sky
It feels like falling stars gliding from above
The snow is illuminating the surrounding 
With its sparkle, tranquillity and serenity

And here I am standing near the windowsill
Where flickering lights of the melting candles
Are adding to its splendid beauty and magic
My silent breathe is fogging the shining glass 
And in this heavy layers of mist and haze

I can see the vivid image of my memories
Of the bygone days, months and years
Where host of pleasure, pain, tears and smiles
Are all waiting for me to pause and reflect
And be strong enough to let go and be free

I am completely engrossed in this mystique 
And magical moments of wonder and celebration
And thinking about my distant and long journey 
That is unique as each falling snowflake from the sky
Some hard, some soft, some whole and some broken

Just like these snowflakes I feel light and heavy
Slowly falling and settling quietly layer by layer
Creating momentum and a meaningful continuum
A blanket of nostalgic memories to warm my soul
Where I pause as it's my time for self reflection.


Empty your heavy heart from worries
And get ready to let go and move on
Deal with difficult circumstances and pain
And wipe tears that blurry your dawn

And ask Him to help you and hold hands
For He's the only one who can understand

And get ready to let go and move on
For this is your time and this is the place
To bring sunshine of faith to your dawn

Be courageous and show your inner strength
And listen to your voice in your head and heart
Life may seem difficult now my dear
But only you have real power to start

So start a day with love, belief and faith
And clear tears of doubt to bravely move
Take deep breath and search for silver lining
And decorate with brilliant light each dawn

So search for your passion and go with the flow
Submit to the His will and promise to accept
That it's time to move and fill heart with hope's glow.
 

You claim by night, I claim by day.
Actually I was beating a drum all the time I was buying him.
You say I gave too much; I say too little.
Actually, I put him on a scale before I bought him.
What I paid was my social body, my town body, my family body, and all my inherited jewels.
Mirabai says: The Dark One is my husband now.
Be with me when I lie down; you promised me this in an earlier life.

It is your smile
It is the charisma
It is the aroma
The way you talk
The way you walk
The way you touch
The rainbow of my soul
Oh! I love you so much
You know very well that I am not a fool
I am a connoisseur who loves class
Intelligence, beauty, elegance, and style
You fit that profile and you passed
All the tests with a gentle smile.

You make me walk on the air
You cause me to denude, to bare
Everything out from the depth
Of my soul. To me, you are a myth
An alluring angel without wings
A genuine saint without halo and rings
I want to be with you to marry you tonight
I want to love you forever my love, that’s right
You are my sunshine on cloudy days
You are my moonlight when I am dazed
You are my compass, my beacon
You are my darling, my mignonne.

I love absolutely everything about you
You are my beer at night, my honeydew
When it is too hot to breathe, to relax
My red wine after dinner; your style rocks
You are it, the elixir, so to speak
You make me reach my peak
You are without a doubt my moon after dark
And my laser cane in the beautiful park
Of life. I love the way you talk to me
The way you touch me, the way you rock me.


You are my eternal inspiration
The woman of ideas and actions
You are the flowers of spring and summer
You are my honey, my pride and honor
Let me admire you, let me give you an infinite kiss
You are my sunshine, and of course, my eternal bliss
It is the freshness of your saliva
Which thrills and tickles my aorta
It is your style
It is your smile
The way you talk
The way you walk. 

It is very difficult to survive hereafter; 
Watts up to the concerned relatives whoever; 
As a last chance, take a selfie once for all
With the patient who is dying however! While we awake in the early morning 
With a thinking to achieve something, 
To test and toss us to an unknown area! There may be an Indian 
who doesn't accept the bribe; 
But there can't be any Indian 
who doesn't offer the bribe! The man who asks us, 
‘Are you honest? ' goes past us; 
But, we started recollecting immediately 
Whatever we erred in the previous birth! The child ignorantly asks the mother, 
Why do you mummy go on extending your hand 
with food close to my mouth while I am still munching? 
I get too much of stress indeed!  was then used to wear full hand shirt and pant; 
I was then used to have fine hair cut once a month; 
I was then studying with boys in boys' school; 
But, still they used to ridicule and make fun with me! 

Now knowing that I am not a male, even though I go around 
Elegantly and suitably by wearing sari, having arranged 
My hair as a single plait adorned with flowers, 
It seems they have found out that ‘I am not a female'


It sounded as if the Streets were running
And then -  the Streets stood still - 
Eclipse -  was all we could see at the Window
And Awe -  was all we could feel.

By and by -  the boldest stole out of his Covert
To see if Time was there - 
Nature was in an Opal Apron,
Mixing fresher Air. 

It stole along so stealthy
Suspicion it was done
Was dim as to the wealthy
Beginning not to own -To refrain from gossip
When others delight in it,
To stand up for the absent person
Who is being abused.

It takes courage

To live honestly
Within your means,
And not dishonestly
On the means of others.

It takes courage

To be a real man or a true woman,
To hold fast to your ideals
When it causes you

To be looked upon
As strange and peculiar.

It takes courage

To be talked about,
And remain silent; 
When a word would justify you
In the eyes of others,

But which you dare not speak
Because it would injure another.

It takes courage

To refuse to do something
That is wrong
Although everyone else
May be doing it

With attitudes as carefree
As a summer song.

It takes courage

To live according
To your own convictions,
To deny yourself
What you cannot afford.

To love your neighbor
As yourself

To be an unwanted guest 
sitting alone in the absence of the host
eating food 'hot and shining like an eye of a cat', 
It is not delicious, but considered 'bitter like neem'; 

If you happen to eat in a house
where you are greeted kindly with respect, 
the host also accompanies you to dine, 
however they are poor; 

Even if they provide cold watery gruel, 
prepared with poor quality rice grains, 
It tastes like Nectar, 
imbibes with your mind and body. 

Blame it on the stars
Blame it on the sea
Blame it on conjunctions
Just don't blame it on me

Frame it as a problem
Frame it as a foe
Frame it as an answer
To a place you never go

Claim it for all history
Claim it for a victory
Claim it isn't so
Truth or false positive aglow


Ra peeks through
from between venetian blinds
and seeps
into my eyes.

I awake
and inhale
your sweet scent
and I smile.

My happiest mornings
with you, 
side by side.

I turn around
to face you
and say, 
'Good morning.'

My smile turns
upside down
just like my world
and I'm looking at the wall. 

in which my greater self
rose up before me
accusing me of my life
with her extra finger
whirling in a gyre of rage
at what my days had come to.
what, 
i pleaded with her, could i do,
oh what could i have done?
and she twisted her wild hair
and sparked her wild eyes
and screamed as long as
i could hear her
This.  This.  This. 

It was a summer evening; 
Old Kaspar was at home, 
Sitting before his cottage door-- 
Like in the Southey pome-- 
And near him, with a magazine, 

"Wy don't you ask me," Kaspar said 
To the child upon the floor, 
"Why don't you ask me what I did 
When I was in the war? 
They told me that each little kid 
Would surely ask me what I did.

"I've had my story ready 
For thirty years or more
 

"Don't bother, Grandpa," said the child; 
"I find such things a bore. 
Pray leave me to my magazine," 

Then entered little Peterkin, 
To whom the gaffer said: 
"You'd like to hear about the war? 
How I was left for dead?" 
"No. And, besides," declared the youth, 
"How do I know you speak the truth?"

Arose the Wan, embittered man, 
The hero of this pome, 
And walked, with not unsprightly step, 
Down to the Soldiers' Home, 
Where he, with seven other men, 
Sat swapping lies till half-past ten. 

It was a hard thing to undo this knot.
The rainbow shines, but only in the thought
Of him that looks. Yet not in that alone,
For who makes rainbows by invention?
And many standing round a waterfall
See one bow each, yet not the same to all,
But each a hand's breadth further than the next.
The sun on falling waters writes the text
Which yet is in the eye or in the thought.
It was a hard thing to undo this knot. 


It was a lie
the way that you humoured me.

It was a lie
the way that I pretended to care.

It was a lie
that finally got me away from you.

It was a lie
that brought us together in the first place. 


IT was a lover and his lass, 
   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, 
That o'er the green corn-field did pass, 
   In the spring time, the only pretty ring time, 
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding; 
Sweet lovers love the spring. 

Between the acres of the rye, 
   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, 
These pretty country folks would lie, 
   In the spring time, the only pretty ring time, 
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding; 
Sweet lovers love the spring. 

This carol they began that hour, 
   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, 
How that life was but a flower 
   In the spring time, the only pretty ring time, 
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding; 
Sweet lovers love the spring. 

And, therefore, take the present time 
   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, 
For love is crown&grave;d with the prime 
In the spring time, the only pretty ring time, 
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding; 
Sweet lovers love the spring. 

My minds image of my Ellen
Is like a rose preserved from time.
Or like a treasured bottle
from a vintage year for wine.

I am haunted by her memory-
How our fingers intertwined.
The fragrance of her body 
as I held it close to mine.

I was Mars and you were Venus
your head rested on my chest.
A summer rain began to fall
persuading us to dress.

Now just the shadow of your smile
Brings tears to a dry place.
Funny how my heart can race
Within the ghost of your embrace.
.

You are unchanging, therefore perfect
Your aspect is divine.
I believe our year was vintage-
for love, if not for wine.

(Fifth poem in the Ellen cycle, A summer picnic at Planting Fields, Arboretum in  It was a  picnic, marked by a brief rain, where we shared  a bottle of Mouton Rothschild)   
. 

It was an April morning: fresh and clear 
The Rivulet, delighting in its strength, 
Ran with a young man's speed; and yet the voice 
Of waters which the winter had supplied 
Was softened down into a vernal tone. 
The spirit of enjoyment and desire, 
And hopes and wishes, from all living things 
Went circling, like a multitude of sounds. 
The budding groves seemed eager to urge on 
The steps of June; as if their various hues 
Were only hindrances that stood between 
Them and their object: but, meanwhile, prevailed 
Such an entire contentment in the air 
That every naked ash, and tardy tree 
Yet leafless, showed as if the countenance 
With which it looked on this delightful day 
Were native to the summer.--Up the brook 
I roamed in the confusion of my heart, 
Alive to all things and forgetting all. 
At length I to a sudden turning came 
In this continuous glen, where down a rock 
The Stream, so ardent in its course before, 
Sent forth such sallies of glad sound, that all 
Which I till then had heard, appeared the voice 
Of common pleasure: beast and bird, the lamb, 
The shepherd's dog, the linnet and the thrush 
Vied with this waterfall, and made a song, 
Which, while I listened, seemed like the wild growth 
Or like some natural produce of the air, 
That could not cease to be. Green leaves were here; 
But 'twas the foliage of the rocks--the birch, 
The yew, the holly, and the bright green thorn, 
With hanging islands of resplendent furze: 
And, on a summit, distant a short space, 
By any who should look beyond the dell, 
A single mountain-cottage might be seen. 
I gazed and gazed, and to myself I said, 
'Our thoughts at least are ours; and this wild nook, 
My EMMA, I will dedicate to thee.' 
----Soon did the spot become my other home, 
My dwelling, and my out-of-doors abode. 
And, of the Shepherds who have seen me there, 
To whom I sometimes in our idle talk 
Have told this fancy, two or three, perhaps, 
Years after we are gone and in our graves, 
When they have cause to speak of this wild place, 
May call it by the name of EMMA'S DELL. 

It was an autumn day
 And it was cold.
 The autumn in the yard.
 The thunderstorm was arguing with rain.
 The leaves were falling down to the ground.
 Someone's soul sat quietly under the bench.
 It shivered with cold and it was wet.
 The words of its owner it remembered
 It could not do anything but regret.
 'My soul, you prevent me from living, 
 You can't stand any deceiving, 
 You pain so hard, you better stay here in the yard
 As I can't stand those pains any more. 

What for? 
 I can't live anymore like this, 
 I think without you I can exist.
 My eyes are tired to cry, 
 May be it's better for you to live in the sky? 
 Please, leave me alone! 
 I want to live on my own.'
 And the soul went away in a hard rainy day.
 It rambled about the wet yard
 Without finding any regard
 Looking at windows and eyes
 But nobody heard its cries.
 The autumn in the yard.
 The thunderstorm was arguing with rain.
 The leaves were falling down to the ground
 And rustled under someones feet.
 The soul had no one to meet.
 No one heard when it cried, 
 So, it has slowly died.***

 	It was autumn when the moon was ashamed because of us. A Messenger came from his dark side.
	Then my bridegroom costume awoke from its millennial drowsiness, rushed to the bridge end and stabbed the woman fallen in imponderability. 

Timely help done to you -
Let the help be however small -
by somebody, whom you 
may know or may not know
While you are in trouble, 

It was 'a stitch in time'
It was so huge and bigger
than the 'Universe'.






It was going on five in the morning
The ship of steam stretched its chain to shatter the windows
And outside
A glowworm
Lifted Paris like a leaf
It was only a long trembling scream
A scream from the Maternity Hospital nearby
FINIS FOUNDRY FANATIC
But whatever joy escaped in the exhalation of that pain
It seems to me that I was falling for a long time
I still had my fist clenched around a handful of grass
And suddenly that rustle of flowers and needles of ice
Those green eyebrows that shooting-star pendulum
From what depths was the bell actually able to rise again
The hermetic bell
Which nothing last night made me foresee would stop on this landing
The bell whose sides read
Undine
Moving to raise your spearheaded Sagittarius pedal
You had carved the infallible signs
Of my enchantment
With a dagger whose coral handle forks into infinity
So that your blood and mine 
Would become onealmost dawn

as I eat yesterday's
forgotten sandwich

yes, some lives were made to be
wasted. 

I loved you 
and you loved me.
We always thought 
it was meant to be.

I told you my troubles 
what the past done to me.
But still I thought 
it was meant to be.

I wrote a note 
to a friend one day, 
asking if our love 
had gone astray.
He told me 
'Y'all were meant to be'

Now I'm here broken-
hearted and blue
wondering if love is 
really true.

My thoughts still linger
and whisper to me
'It was never meant to be'While the cat is feeling hungry, 
it was proceeding In search of rats
and walked through the street, 
A man was coming towards the cat, 
Alas, it was not a good Omen, 
It returned to its hiding place
to look for opportunities later. 

(It is considered as a bad omen if a cat crosses your way in some countries like India)   

(If you go for some important work, you can't get things done easily, 
but in this case, the cat is looking for omen when it is going for rat hunt) . 

It was upon a July evening.
At a stile I stood, looking along a path
Over the country by a second Spring
Drenched perfect green again. 'The lattermath
Will be a fine one.' So the stranger said,
A wandering man. Albeit I stood at rest,
Flushed with desire I was. The earth outspread,
Like meadows of the future, I possessed.

And as an unaccomplished prophecy
The stranger's words, after the interval
Of a score years, when those fields are by me
Never to be recrossed, now I recall,
This July eve, and question, wondering,
What of the lattermath to this hoar Spring

Winter came as it does in this valley. 
After eight dry months rain fell 
And the mountains, straw-colored, turned green for a while. 
In the canyons where gray laurels 
Graft their stony roots to granite, 
Streams must have filled the dried-up creek beds. 
Ocean winds churned the eucalyptus trees, 
And under clouds torn by a crystal of towers 
Prickly lights were glowing on the docks. 


This is not a place where you sit under a cafe awning 
On a marble piazza, watching the crowd, 
Or play the flute at a window over a narrow street 
While children’s sandals clatter in the vaulted entryway. 


They heard of a land, empty and vast, 
Bordered by mountains. So they went, leaving behind crosses 
Of thorny wood and traces of campfires. 
As it happened, they spent winter in the snow of a mountain pass, 
And drew lots and boiled the bones of their companions; 
And so afterward a hot valley where indigo could be grown 
Seemed beautiful to them. And beyond, where fog 
Heaved into shoreline coves, the ocean labored. 


Sleep: rocks and capes will lie down inside you, 
War councils of motionless animals in a barren place, 
Basilicas of reptiles, a frothy whiteness. 
Sleep on your coat, while your horse nibbles grass 
And an eagle gauges a precipice. 


When you wake up, you will have the parts of the world. 
West, an empty conch of water and air. 
East, always behind you, the voided memory of snow-covered fir. 
And extending from your outspread arms 
Nothing but bronze grasses, north and south. 


We are poor people, much afflicted. 
We camped under various stars, 
Where you dip water with a cup from a muddy river 
And slice your bread with a pocketknife. 
This is the place; accepted, not chosen. 
We remembered that there were streets and houses where we came 
from, 
So there had to be houses here, a saddler’s signboard, 
A small veranda with a chair. But empty, a country where 
The thunder beneath the rippled skin of the earth, 
The breaking waves, a patrol of pelicans, nullified us. 
As if our vases, brought here from another shore, 
Were the dug-up spearheads of some lost tribe 
Who fed on lizards and acorn flour. 


And here I am walking the eternal earth. 
Tiny, leaning on a stick. 
I pass a volcanic park, lie down at a spring, 
Not knowing how to express what is always and everywhere: 
The earth I cling to is so solid 
Under my breast and belly that I feel grateful 
For every pebble, and I don’t know whether 
It is my pulse or the earth’s that I hear, 
When the hems of invisible silk vestments pass over me, 
Hands, wherever they have been, touch my arm, 
Or small laughter, once, long ago over wine, 
With lanterns in the magnolias, for my house is huge.

'It was wrong to do this,' said the angel. 
'You should live like a flower, 
Holding malice like a puppy, 
Waging war like a lambkin.' 

'Not so,' quoth the man 
Who had no fear of spirits; 
'It is only wrong for angels 
Who can live like the flowers, 
Holding malice like the puppies, 
Waging war like the lambkins.

'What can describe what I’m feeling right now? 
Words that are used to describe feelings, 
Cannot describe what I feel.
No one understands what I am going through.
I can’t talk to anyone, because they will try to fix it.
Fix what is happening to make me feel this way.
There is only one person that I can talk to, 
But I don’t know how to ask.
All I need is someone to talk to about what is happening, 
Just someone who will listen, not try to fix it.
That person is always around during the school term, 
And I see her everyday.
I cannot describe how much I trust her, 
And do not know how to tell her so.
It hurts me to see that she doesn’t know, 
That I need her so.
And I’m sorry for what I have done in the past, 
‘cause even I didn’t know what to do.
At that time, 
I didn’t know, 
That all I needed, 
Was a friend, 
Who understood, 
Who listened, 
Who actually cares about what I feel.
And I’m sorry that I can’t talk to that person because of what I have done before, 
And I want to make it up to her, 
To tell her that I’m sorry, 
And to just see her smile at me, 
To show that she cares, 
Even though, 
I might not be able to talk to her, 
To hear her voice, 
Which comforts me so, 
And to hear her say, 
‘It will be ok.’It will not change now
After so many years;
Life has not broken it
With parting or tears;
Death will not alter it,
It will live on
In all my songs for you
When I am gone. 

My hearts’ wounds are healed
Without a stain are they healed.

But it pains me somewhere.
But it pains me deep down.
Somewhere in a corner, pain breathes..

And I remembered
the wisdom of the wise man: 
"The wounds of the heart
shall not be healed."for Miguel

It would be neat if with the New Year
I could leave my loneliness behind with the old year.
My leathery loneliness an old pair of work boots
my dog vigorously head-shakes back and forth in its jaws,
chews on for hours every day in my front yard—
rain, sun, snow, or wind
I’d look out my window and see that dirty pair of boots in the yard.

But my happiness depends so much on wearing those boots.

At the end of my day
while I’m in a chair listening to a Mexican corrido
I stare at my boots appreciating:
all the wrong roads we’ve taken, all the drug and whiskey houses
we’ve visited, and as the Mexican singer wails his pain,
I smile at my boots, understanding every note in his voice,
and strangers, when they see my boots rocking back and forth on my
                                                                                                    feet
keeping beat to the song, see how
my boots are scuffed, tooth-marked, worn-soled.

I keep wearing them because they fit so good
and I need them, especially when I love so hard,
where I go up those boulder strewn trails,
where flowers crack rocks in their defiant love for the light. 

A winged and holy thing
once flew into me.

Every flutter of its wings
wounds my inner core.
And I begin to sing
sweet songs of eternity. 

Soft a rose.
Dying what
fell from his 
open hand? 
Scented in
Yes, it's still.
Rose gifted. 


In the deep hour of dreams,
Through the dark woods, and past the moaning sea,
And by the star-light gleams,
Mother of sorrows! lo, I come to thee!

Unto thy shrine I bear
Night-blowing flowers, like my own heart, to lie
All, all unfolded there,
Beneath the meekness of thy pitying eye.

For thou, that once didst move,
In thy still beauty, through an early home,
Thou knowest the grief, the love,
The fear of woman's soul; - to thee I come!

Many, and sad, and deep,
Were the thoughts folded in thy silent breast;
Thou, too, couldst watch and weep -
Hear, gentlest mother! hear a heart oppressed!

There is a wandering bark
Bearing one from me o'er the restless wave:
Oh! let thy soft eye mark
His course; - be with him, holiest, guide and save!

My soul is on that way;
My thoughts are travellers o'er the waters dim;
Through the long weary day
I walk, o'ershadowed by vain dreams of him.

Aid him - and me, too, aid!
Oh! 'tis not well, this earthly love's excess!
On thy weak child is laid 
The burden of too deep a tenderness.

Too much o'er 
him
is poured
My being's hope - scarce leaving Heaven a part;
Too faithfully adored,
Oh! make not him the chastener of my heart!

I tremble with a sense
Of grief to be; - I hear a warming low
Sweet mother! call me hence!
This wild idolatry must end in woe.

The troubled joy of life,
Love's lightning happiness, my soul hath known
And, worn with feverish strife,
Would fold its wings; take back, take back thine own.

Hark! how the wind swept by!
The tempest's voice comes rolling o'er the wave - 
Hope of the sailor's eye,
And maiden's heart, blest mother, guide and save

That second time they hunted me
From hill to plain, from shore to sea,
And Austria, hounding far and wide
Her blood-hounds thro' the country-side,
Breathed hot and instant on my trace,---
I made six days a hiding-place
Of that dry green old aqueduct
Where I and Charles, when boys, have plucked
The fire-flies from the roof above,
Bright creeping thro' the moss they love:
---How long it seems since Charles was lost!
Six days the soldiers crossed and crossed
The country in my very sight;
And when that peril ceased at night,
The sky broke out in red dismay
With signal fires; well, there I lay
Close covered o'er in my recess,
Up to the neck in ferns and cress,
Thinking on Metternich our friend,
And Charles's miserable end,
And much beside, two days; the third,
Hunger o'ercame me when I heard
The peasants from the village go
To work among the maize; you know,
With us in Lombardy, they bring
Provisions packed on mules, a string
With little bells that cheer their task,
And casks, and boughs on every cask
To keep the sun's heat from the wine;
These I let pass in jingling line,
And, close on them, dear noisy crew,
The peasants from the village, too;
For at the very rear would troop
Their wives and sisters in a group
To help, I knew. When these had passed,
I threw my glove to strike the last,
Taking the chance: she did not start,
Much less cry out, but stooped apart,
One instant rapidly glanced round,
And saw me beckon from the ground.
A wild bush grows and hides my crypt;
She picked my glove up while she stripped
A branch off, then rejoined the rest
With that; my glove lay in her breast.
Then I drew breath; they disappeared:
It was for Italy I feared.

  An hour, and she returned alone
Exactly where my glove was thrown.
Meanwhile came many thoughts: on me
Rested the hopes of Italy.
I had devised a certain tale
Which, when 'twas told her, could not fail
Persuade a peasant of its truth;
I meant to call a freak of youth
This hiding, and give hopes of pay,
And no temptation to betray.
But when I saw that woman's face,
Its calm simplicity of grace,
Our Italy's own attitude
In which she walked thus far, and stood,
Planting each naked foot so firm,
To crush the snake and spare the worm---
At first sight of her eyes, I said,
I am that man upon whose head
They fix the price, because I hate
The Austrians over us: the State
Will give you gold---oh, gold so much!---
If you betray me to their clutch,
And be your death, for aught I know,
If once they find you saved their foe.
Now, you must bring me food and drink,
And also paper, pen and ink,
And carry safe what I shall write
To Padua, which you'll reach at night
Before the duomo shuts; go in,
And wait till Tenebr
 begin;
Walk to the third confessional,
Between the pillar and the wall,
And kneeling whisper, _Whence comes peace?_
Say it a second time, then cease;
And if the voice inside returns,
The cause of Peace?_---for answer, slip
My letter where you placed your lip;
Then come back happy we have done
Our mother service---I, the son,
As you the daughter of our land!''

  Three mornings more, she took her stand
In the same place, with the same eyes:
I was no surer of sun-rise
That of her coming. We conferred
Of her own prospects, and I heard
She had a lover---stout and tall,
She said---then let her eyelids fall,
He could do much''---as if some doubt
Entered her heart,---then, passing out,
She could not speak for others, who
Had other thoughts; herself she knew:''
And so she brought me drink and food.
After four days, the scouts pursued
Another path; at last arrived
The help my Paduan friends contrived
To furnish me: she brought the news.
For the first time I could not choose
But kiss her hand, and lay my own
Upon her head---This faith was shown
To Italy, our mother; she
Uses my hand and blesses thee.''
She followed down to the sea-shore;
I left and never saw her more.


  How very long since I have thought
Concerning---much less wished for---aught
Beside the good of Italy,
For which I live and mean to die!
I never was in love; and since
Charles proved false, what shall now convince.
My inmost heart I have a friend?
However, if I pleased to spend
Real wishes on myself---say, three---
I know at least what one should be.
I would grasp Metternich until
I felt his red wet throat distil
In blood thro' these two hands. And next,
---Nor much for that am I perplexed---
Charles, perjured traitor, for his part,
Should die slow of a broken heart
Under his new employer. Last
---Ah, there, what should I wish? For fast
Do I grow old and out of strength.
If I resolved to seek at length
My father's house again, how scared
They all would look, and unprepared!
My brothers live in Austria's pay
---Disowned me long ago, men say;
And all my early mates who used
To praise me so---perhaps induced
More than one early step of mine---
Are turning wise: while some opine
Freedom grows license,'' some suspect
Haste breeds delay,'' and recollect
They always said, such premature
Beginnings never could endure!
So, with a sullen All's for best,''
The land seems settling to its rest.
I think then, I should wish to stand
This evening in that dear, lost land,
Over the sea the thousand miles,
And know if yet that woman smiles
With the calm smile; some little farm
She lives in there, no doubt: what harm
If I sat on the door-side bench,
And, while her spindle made a trench
Fantastically in the dust,
Inquired of all her fortunes---just
Her children's ages and their names,
And what may be the husband's aims
For each of them. I'd talk this out,
And sit there, for an hour about,
Then kiss her hand once more, and lay
Mine on her head, and go my way.

  So much for idle wishing---how
It steals the time! To business now.


FU' de peace o' my eachin' heels, set down;
Don' fiddle dat chune no mo'.
Don' you see how dat melody stuhs me up
An' baigs me to tek to de flo'?
I wusship f'om June to June;
My pra'ahs dey ah loud an' my hymns ah long:
I baig you don' fiddle dat chune.
I's a crick in my back an' a misery hyeah
Whaih de j'ints's gittin' ol' an' stiff,
But hit seems lak you brings me de bref o' my youf;
W'y, I's suttain I noticed a w'iff.
Don' fiddle dat chune no mo', my chile,
Don' fiddle dat chune no mo';
I'll git up an' taih up dis groun' fu' a mile,
An' den I'll be chu'ched fu' it, sho'.
Oh, fiddle dat chune some mo', I say,
An' fiddle it loud an' fas':
I's a youngstah ergin in de mi'st o' my sin;
De p'esent's gone back to de pas'.
I'll dance to dat chune, so des fiddle erway;

So fiddle it on 'twell de break o' de day
Fu' de sake o' my eachin' heels. 


Next is item six, a bag of nothing, who'll give me an opening price
A bag of nothing sitting on your shelf would look rather nice
Come on give me a bid, oh is that five dollars I hear
But surely I can get more for this perfectly formed sphere
 
You won't get addicted to it and it'll never give you a rash
In fact this bag of nothing could save you a lot of cash
Your kids won't fight over it and it doesn't gather dust
Can I say that this bag of nothing is an absolute must
 
Item six won't go out of fashion or lie broken on the floor
Is that ten dollars you're offering, I was hoping for a little more
Your neighbour cannot buy one that's got more power
It won't wilt or its petals fall off as happens with flowers
 
Doesn't need to be filtered, chlorinated, skimmed or pumped
And it will never have to be carted off in a hired truck to the dump
Fifteen dollars bid from the man over there called Sean
That lady in red's offering twenty, going, going, gone! 


Do you want to know the items that sit on my desk
You do? Well I'll list them and then give you a test
A pair of sunglasses, scissors, a cup and a phone
Some papers scattered over and a pen resting alone

Deep stuff this is, of which poems can be crafted
This precious information should not be merely shafted
The phone displays the words 'Hold', 'Goodbye' and 'Mute'
The apple's already eaten, so I can't mention any fruit

On my desk is a rectangle of light provided by the sun
It's shape changes over time as it makes its daily run
Unfortunately the plant is only just surviving
I'd be lying if I said that it was green and thriving

A stick of glue sits there, used only once many weeks ago
Who knows, one day its importance will once again grow
A ruler, a phone book and an ancient tape recorder
Ensure that this desk does not look in perfect order

Well there you have it, the items on my desk
I haven't mentioned everything, I'll let you guess the rest
The spare RSI preventing mouse, a few little balls of fluff
Of course you knew them, because they're typical desk stuff


 - When you set out for Ithaka
ask that your way be long,
full of adventure, full of instruction.
The Laistrygonians and the Cyclops,
angry Poseidon - do not fear them:
such as these you will never find
as long as your thought is lofty, as long as a rare
emotion touch your spirit and your body.
The Laistrygonians and the Cyclops,
angry Poseidon - you will not meet them
unless you carry them in your soul,
unless your soul raise them up before you.

Ask that your way be long.
At many a Summer dawn to enter
with what gratitude, what joy -
ports seen for the first time;
to stop at Phoenician trading centres,
and to buy good merchandise,
mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,
and sensuous perfumes of every kind,
sensuous perfumes as lavishly as you can;
to visit many Egyptian cities,
to gather stores of knowledge from the learned.

Have Ithaka always in your mind.
Your arrival there is what you are destined for.
But don't in the least hurry the journey.
Better it last for years,
so that when you reach the island you are old,
rich with all you have gained on the way,
not expecting Ithaka to give you wealth.
Ithaka gave you a splendid journey.
Without her you would not have set out.
She hasn't anything else to give you.

And if you find her poor, Ithaka hasn't deceived you.
So wise you have become, of such experience,
that already you'll have understood what these Ithakas mean. 

Its not my life, 

I’m just borrowing it.

And its long overdue. 

.  late fees. 

 

I don't see what you see in me.

I haven't subscribed to that channel.

 

I’m lost.

Wanna be lost together? 

Its no longer

a new idea. 

But its not cliche, 

if I say it.

 

We could go down to Blockbuster, 

and rent out our lifes.

Or order it on Netflicks. 

.  we'd get it in the mail. 

 

I went to Wal-Mart.

Stole our lifes on DVD.

The special features, 

would make you cry.

You were expecting a sequel, 

but none was listed. 

 

So pop the corn.

Take a sip of that soda.

And watch me self-destruct

on that silver screen. 


We pace each other for a long time.
I packed my anger with the beef jerky.
You are the baby on the mountain. I am 
in a cold stream where I led you.

I packed my anger with the beef jerky.
You are the woman sticking her tongue out 
in a cold stream where I led you.
You are the woman with spring water palms.

You are the woman sticking her tongue out.
I am the woman who matches sounds.
You are the woman with spring water palms.
I am the woman who copies.

You are the woman who matches sounds.
You are the woman who makes up words. 
You are the woman who copies
her cupped palm with her fist in clay.

I am the woman who makes up words.
You are the woman who shapes
a drinking bowl with her fist in clay.
I am the woman with rocks in her pockets.

I am the woman who shapes.
I was a baby who knew names.
You are the child with rocks in her pockets.
You are the girl in a plaid dress.

You are the woman who knows names.
You are the baby who could fly.
You are the girl in a plaid dress
upside-down on the monkey bars.

You are the baby who could fly
over the moon from a swinging perch
upside-down on the monkey bars.
You are the baby who eats meat.

Over the moon from a swinging perch
the feathery goblin calls her sister.
You are the baby who eats meat
the bitch wolf hunts and chews for you.

The feathery goblin calls her sister:
"You are braver than your mother.
The bitch wolf hunts and chews for you.
What are you whining about now?"

You are braver than your mother
and I am not a timid woman:
what are you whining about now?
My palms itch with slick anger,

and I'm not a timid woman.
You are the woman I can't mention;
my palms itch with slick anger.
You are the heiress of scraped knees.

You are the woman I can't mention
to a woman I want to love.
You are the heiress of scaped knees:
scrub them in mountain water.

To a woman, I want to love
women you could turn into,
scrub them in mountain water,
stroke their astonishing faces.

Women you could turn into
the scare mask of Bad Mother
stroke their astonishing faces
in the silver-scratched sink mirror.

The scare mask of Bad Mother
crumbles to chunked, pinched clay,
sinks in the silver-scratched mirror.
You are the Little Robber Girl, who

crumbles the clay chunks, pinches
her friend, givers her a sharp knife.
You are the Little Robber Girl, who
was any witch's youngest daughter.

Our friend gives you a sharp knife,
shows how the useful blades open.
Was any witch's youngest daughter
golden and bold as you? You run and

show how the useful blades open.
You are the baby on the mountain. I am 
golden and bold as you. You run and 
we pace each other for a long time. 


And glory to our sovereign liege, King Henry of Navarre!  
Now let there be the merry sound of music and of dance,  
Through thy corn-fields green, and sunny vines, O pleasant land of France!  
And thou, Rochelle, our own Rochelle, proud city of the waters, 
Again let rapture light the eyes of all thy mourning daughters.  
As thou went constant in our ills, be joyous in our joy;  
For cold and stiff and still are they who wrought thy walls annoy.  
Hurrah! hurrah! a single field hath turn’d the chance of war!  
Hurrah! hurrah! for Ivry, and Henry of Navarre. 
 
Oh! how our hearts were beating, when, at the dawn of day,  
We saw the army of the League drawn out in long array;  
With all its priest-led citizens, and all its rebel peers,  
And Appenzel’s stout infantry, and Egmont’s Flemish spears.  
There rode the brood of false Lorraine, the curses of our land; 
And dark Mayenne was in the midst, a truncheon in his hand;  
And, as we look’d on them, we thought of Seine’s empurpled flood,  
And good Coligni’s hoary hair all dabbled with his blood;  
To fight for His own holy name, and Henry of Navarre. 
 
The king is come to marshal us, in all his armor drest;  
And he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant crest.  
He look’d upon his people, and a tear was in his eye;  
He look’d upon the traitors, and his glance was stern and high.  
Right graciously he smil’d on us, as roll’d from wing to wing. 
"And if my standard-bearer fall, as fall full well he may,  
For never I saw promise yet of such a bloody fray,  
Press where ye see my white plume shine amidst the ranks of war,  
And be your oriflamme to-day the helmet of Navarre."  
 
Hurrah! the foes are moving. Hark to the mingled din,  
Of fife, and steed, and trump, and drum, and roaring culverin.  
With all the hireling chivalry of Guelders and Almayne.  
Now by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of France, 
Charge for the golden lilies—upon them with the lance!  
A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest,  
A thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow-white crest;  
And in they burst, and on they rush’d, while, like a guiding star,  
Amidst the thickest carnage blaz’d the helmet of Navarre. 
 
D’Aumale hath cried for quarter; the Flemish count is slain.  
Their ranks are breaking like thin clouds before a Biscay gale;  
The field is heap’d with bleeding steeds, and flags, and cloven mail.  
And then we thought on vengeance, and, all along our van,
Remember Saint Bartholomew! was pass’d from man to man.  
But out spake gentle Henry—"No French-man is my foe:  
Down, down with every foreigner, but let your brethren go:"  
Oh! was there ever such a knight, in friendship or in war,  
As our sovereign lord, King Henry, the soldier of Navarre? 
 
Right well fought all the Frenchmen who fought for France to-day;  
But we of the religion have borne us best in fight;  
And the good lord of Rosny hath ta’en the cornet white—  
Our own true Maximilian the cornet white hath ta’en, 
The cornet white with crosses black, the flag of false Lorraine.  
Up with it high; unfurl it wide;—that all the host may know  
Then on the ground, while trumpets sound their loudest point of war,  
Fling the red shreds, a footcloth meet for Henry of Navarre. 
 
Ho! maidens of Vienna; ho! matrons of Lucerne—  
Weep, weep, and rend your hair for those who never shall return.  
Ho! Philip, send, for charity, thy Mexican pistoles,  
That Antwerp monks may sing a mass for thy poor spearmen’s souls.  
Ho! gallant nobles of the League, look that your arms be bright;
Ho! burghers of St. Genevieve, keep watch and ward to-night;  
And mock’d the counsel of the wise, and the valor of the brave.  
Then glory to His holy name, from whom all glories are;  
And glory to our sovereign lord, King Henry of Navarre

Road, 
Broad, 
Abroad! 

The secret of the red dot, 
Writing is part of my medicine, 
Healing me all day long; 

Panorama! 
Tales from my homeland; 
Like a garden planted with different roses. 

Oar, 
Boar, 
Board; 

Stepping out! 
With the tales of Africa; 
And, to be active. 

Read, 
Spread, 
Thread; 

Woman! 
Why should you sell your body to all the men aroud you? 
You are spreading diseases to the world. 

Realism! 
Being part of the world and to play my part with, 
The works of peace; 

Life, 
A price too high; 
Always active. 

Evil workers! 
On the road to hell with, 
Their evil works on earth; 

Love, 
To get the perfect person on your side; 
Like the fragrance of the African salt. 

Sight, insight! 
Knocking at the very door, 
Explaining the light of your love into details; 

A land full of beautiful flowers! 
Love has no wings but, it can easily carry you away; 
Into a special place full of joy! ! 
 
Dates and records, 
Marraige is between a man and a woman! 
Knowing the truth from the beginning; 

Metropolitan Museum of Art! 
Why are you naked in your dress? 
In the eyes of the public. 

Blog, Log! 
Press, express! 
In colours; 


'i


World'! 
So it is; 
As it was and, now it is.


Board, broad! 
To come on board, 
With the muse of migration; 

The power of dreams! 
The power of love, 
The power of nature; 

Screen, seen! 
Peace and love, 
With the echoes of the season; 

Chef, chief! 
Expand your mind and, always seek for the truth; 
And, learn to lead. 

We bought a small house
along the river, in Southside barrio.
A shack I pried boards from the front door to get in-
half-acre of land in the back
heaped with decades of scrap-rusted wire fencing, creosote
railroad ties, tumbleweeds, a mountain of decaying 
harvest never picked, weaving itself
slowly into the dirt again.

             I gutted the plaster frame house,
nailed, puttied, roofed, plumbed,
poured cement, sheet-rocked, tiled, carpeted,
tore-out, re-set,
        piled, burned, cleaned, cemented, installed,
washed and painted,
trimmed, pruned, shoveled, raked,
        sawed, hammered, measured, stuccoed,
until,
        calloused handed, muscle-firmed, sleek hard bodied,
                our small house rose
                from a charred, faded gravemarker,
                a weather-rotted roost
                for junkies and vagrants,

wind, rain, and sun splintered
jagged stories of storms on,
I corrected,
                re-wrote upon
                this plaster wood tablet,
                our own version of love, family and power. 




We dont live for a thousand years
So come on, come.  

waltz with me tonight
Nature is playing some cicada music
The moon is throwing some silvery light

Dont be tied with chains of sorrow
They will take you down sure and quiet
Let me hold your calloused hands
Come on.  

waltz with me tonight

We might be swept away in a blink
All our tears frozen in full flight
And death may just stare in your eye
So come.  

waltz with me tonight


When we sleep, when we dream. 
We can be anything that we want
Deep and inner longing manifesting into a form. 
 
Part of the self leaves the body when we sleep. 
It becomes what we want to be
Hidden desires buried inside.  

out they creep
 
I'm the moon, everything glistens and shimmers in my light. 
Playing and flirting through the clouds
My reflection in still water is the most beautiful sight. 
 
I'm the wave surging out in the deep sea. 
A giant leap and then merging back
Sometimes crashing, sometimes tranquil.  

always thirsty
 
I'm the cloud made of white whipped cream. 
Wandering over Angkor, Luxor or Memphis
Each day moving to a new place of my dream. 
 
I'm a dust particle floating in the will of the air. 
That no one can see but can generate a bout of sneeze
I'm here, I'm there. . 

I'm everywhere. 
 
I'm a child again looking at everything with a glee. 
Thirst to learn, thirst to dance
Breaking out in a gurgling laughter looking up at you innocently. 
 
I'm the scarlet rose as dark as wine. 
Each peatal as it unfolds revealing a hidden pearl
When all petals drop.  

become a field of grapewine
 
I'm the gnome with a long nose in the Faraway Tree. 
Get lost in the various lands that anchor on the top
Throwing water on any intruder that comes to visit me. 
 
So every human streams out in the nights
Some do it even in the day to escape
They just do it in different lights. 
 
When we sleep, when we dream. 
You can be anything that you want
Deep and inner longing manifesting into a form. . 


 

I Love to Think of Those Naked Epochs

I love to think of those naked epochs
Whose statues Phoebus liked to tinge with gold.
At that time men and women, lithe and strong,
Tasted the thrill of love free from care and prudery,
And with the amorous sun caressing their loins
They gloried in the health of their noble bodies.
Then Cybele, generous with her fruits,
Did not find her children too heavy a burden; 
A she-wolf from whose heart flowed boundless love for all,
She fed the universe from her tawny nipples.
Man, graceful, robust, strong, was justly proud
Of the beauties who proclaimed him their king; 
Fruits unblemished and free from every scar,
Whose smooth, firm flesh invited biting kisses! 


Today, when the Poet wishes to imagine
This primitive grandeur, in places where
Men and women show themselves in a state of nudity,
He feels a gloomy cold enveloping his soul
Before this dark picture full of terror.
Monstrosities bewailing their clothing! 
Ridiculous torsos appropriate for masks! 
Poor bodies, twisted, thin, bulging or flabby,


That the god Usefulness, implacable and calm,
Wrapped up at tender age in swaddling clothes of brass! 
And you, women, alas! pale as candies,
Whom Debauch gnaws and feeds, and you, virgins,
Who trail the heritage of the maternal vice
And all the hideousness of fecundity! 


Degenerate races, we have, it's true, 
Types of beauty unknown to the ancient peoples: 
Visages gnawed by cankers of the heart 
And what one might say were languor's marks of beauty; 
But these inventions of our backward Muses 
Will never prevent unhealthy races 
From paying to their youth deep and sincere homage,
— To holy youth, with serene brow and guileless air, 
With eyes bright and clear, like a running brook, 
Which goes spreading over all things, as free from care 
As the blue of the sky, the birds and the flowers, 
Its perfumes, its songs and its sweet ardor! 



I Love the Thought of Those Old Naked Days 

I love the thought of those old naked days 
When Phoebus gilded torsos with his rays, 
When men and women sported, strong and fleet, 
Without anxiety or base deceit, 
And heaven caressed them, amorously keen 
To prove the health of each superb machine. 
Cybele then was lavish of her guerdon 
And did not find her sons too gross a burden: 
But, like a she-wolf, in her love great-hearted, 
Her full brown teats to all the world imparted. 
Bold, handsome, strong, Man, rightly, might evince 
Pride in the glories that proclaimed him prince — 
Fruits pure of outrage, by the blight unsmitten, 
With firm, smooth flesh that cried out to be bitten.


Today the Poet, when he would assess 
Those native splendours in the nakedness 
Of man or woman, feels a sombre chill 
Enveloping his spirit and his will. 
He meets a gloomy picture, which be loathes, 
Wherein deformity cries out for clothes. 
Oh comic runts! Oh horror of burlesque! 
Lank, flabby, skewed, pot-bellied, and grotesque! 
Whom their smug god, Utility (poor brats!)  
Has swaddled in his brazen clouts 'ersatz' 
As with cheap tinsel. Women tallow-pale, 
Both gnawed and nourished by debauch, who trail 
The heavy burden of maternal vice, 
Or of fecundity the hideous price.


We have (corrupted nations)  it is true
Beauties the ancient people never knew — 
Sad faces gnawed by cancers of the heart
And charms which morbid lassitudes impart. 
But these inventions of our tardy muse 
Can't force our ailing peoples to refuse 
Just tribute to the holiness of youth 
With its straightforward mien, its forehead couth, 
The limpid gaze, like running water bright, 
Diffusing, careless, through all things, like the light 
Of azure skies, the birds, the winds, the flowers, 
The songs, and perfumes, and heart-warming powers.



I Love The Naked Ages Long Ago

I love the naked ages long ago 
When statues were gilded by Apollo, 
When men and women of agility 
Could play without lies and anxiety, 
And the sky lovingly caressed their spines, 
As it exercised its noble machine. 
Fertile Cybele, mother of nature, then, 
Would not place on her daughters a burden, 
But, she-wolf sharing her heart with the people, 
Would feed creation from her brown nipples. 
Men, elegant and strong, would have the right 
To be proud to have beauty named their king; 
Virgin fruit free of blemish and cracking, 
Whose flesh smooth and firm would summon a bite! 
The Poet today, when he would convey 
This native grandeur, would not be swept away 
By man free and woman natural, 
But would feel darkness envelop his soul 
Before this black tableau full of loathing. 
O malformed monsters crying for clothing! 
O ludicrous heads! Torsos needing disguise! 
O poor writhing bodies of every wrong size, 
Children that the god of the Useful swaths 
In the language of bronze and brass! 
And women, alas! You shadow your heredity, 
You gnaw nourishment from debauchery, 
A virgin holds maternal lechery 
And all the horrors of fecundity! 

We have, it is true, corrupt nations, 
Beauty unknown to the radiant ancients: 
Faces that gnaw through the heart's cankers, 
And talk with the cool beauty of languor; 
But these inventions of our backward muses 
Are never hindered in their morbid uses 
Of the old for profound homage to youth, 
—To the young saint, the sweet air, the simple truth, 
To the eye as limpid as the water current, 
To spread out over all, insouciant 
Like the blue sky, the birds and the flowers, 
Its perfumes, its songs and its sweet fervors.




He built his monumental work
On the rocks of his pithy philosophy: 
‘Work Builds; Charity Destroys.’
Whenever the tempest of time blows across
He feels no loss –
His work stands unaffected; 
Self-reliance he has perfected.
To those poor palms
Fated to seek alms
A few tools he gave, 
Their spirits to save, 
And they carved out
The beauty of self-dignity
From what was first their self-pity, 
Their disability, 
Their poverty, 
Their agony! 
In the desert of leprosy
He sowed seeds of sympathy, 
Seeds of empathy, 
And grew the garden of ability, 
Of energy, 
Of prosperity.
He knew that charity
Could feed the hungry.
But he also knew that it could
Also inflict injury.
But work could make one worthy, 
Could make one really happy.
He gave no charity; 
He gave opportunity; 
He decried self-pity; 
He admired dignity. 


A flickering glimmer through a window-pane, 
A dim red glare through mud bespattered glass, 
Cleaving a path between blown walls of sleet 
Across uneven pavements sunk in slime 
To scatter and then quench itself in mist. 
And struggling, slipping, often rudely hurled 
Against the jutting angle of a wall, 
And cursed, and reeled against, and flung aside 
By drunken brawlers as they shuffled past, 
A man was groping to what seemed a light. 
His eyelids burnt and quivered with the strain 
Of looking, and against his temples beat 
The all enshrouding, suffocating dark. 
He stumbled, lurched, and struck against a door 
That opened, and a howl of obscene mirth 
Grated his senses, wallowing on the floor 
Lay men, and dogs and women in the dirt. 
He sickened, loathing it, and as he gazed 
The candle guttered, flared, and then went out. 

Through travail of ignoble midnight streets 
He came at last to shelter in a porch 
Where gothic saints and warriors made a shield 
To cover him, and tortured gargoyles spat 
One long continuous stream of silver rain 
That clattered down from myriad roofs and spires 
Into a darkness, loud with rushing sound 
Of water falling, gurgling as it fell, 
But always thickly dark. Then as he leaned 
Unconscious where, the great oak door blew back 
And cast him, bruised and dripping, in the church. 
His eyes from long sojourning in the night 
Were blinded now as by some glorious sun; 
He slowly crawled toward the altar steps. 
He could not think, for heavy in his ears 
An organ boomed majestic harmonies; 
He only knew that what he saw was light! 
He bowed himself before a cross of flame 
And shut his eyes in fear lest it should fade.


'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!'

He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought --
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood a while in thought.

And, as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!

One two! One two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.

'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
He chortled in his joy.

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe. 

Jacinths and jessamines and jonquils sweet,
All odorous pale flowers from Orient lands,
No vain red roses strew I at thy feet,
Emblems of grief and thee, with reverent hands.
Mine is no madrigal of passionate joy,
Or orison of aught less chaste than tears.
Ruth on thy brow sits fairest. Its annoy
Rends not thy beauty's raiment, nor the years.
In thy shut lips what secrets! Who am I
Should seek a sign at that dread sanctuary

So, this

binned. 

Why did you discard her
like fat pork
that's thrown out for the birds? 

She was pecked at
by the populous, 
hopped on, crapped on
and left to the elements of life.

She was a wife
of good repute, 
astute and hard working.
Weight was not the only thing
she had to offer.

She was a reasonable cook. 
you were
an unreasonable feeder
you bleeder. 

He never asked to be a hero
For him, playing ball would be just fine
Potentially his chance was less than zero
To overcome that black-white racist line

Jackie entered through back doors
The stage was set by Mr. Rickey
For Robinson to fight that Civil War

Sports, they say, mirrors society
So, they should have hung their heads in shame
For what was then America's propriety
Brought prejudice to every game

The Brooklyn Bums, at long last, found salvation
When Robinson's talents were revealed
With the awesome double-play combination
Reese and Jackie brought to Ebbetts Field

Stealing fan's hearts with baseball fire
Displaying skills in every way
Robinson played with such desire
Stealing bases most every day

They could never expect fom him the expected
He turned the most racist hate to love
And finally he was most respected
Respect that came from more than bat and glove

For Jackie, baseball was more than just a game
He opened doors for Campy, Mays and others
Number  now in the Hall of Fame
Proved men of all colors could play in life as brothers


He never asked to be a hero

Do you remember the celebration of the night, Michael, 
When tribal chief of Ivory Coast placed the crown upon your head
After the name of King 'Sani'? 
I remember it clearly, the night of reunion—
The sky of Gabon, the land of your fore-father, 
First got red then gradually glowed golden lights
In a mystical way.

With no prior knowledge, right after you were born, 
You immediately knew that
Art did not have a particular motherland; 
Artists should not have any national barriers; 
Beauty was for eternity, 
And roses were always the same in every part of the world; 
No more introduction was needed.

Indiana was a half-lighted city, 
And more deep into it a calm and sleepy world, Garry, 
Who took you into this vest ocean of agony, 
Which is actually called life; immediately after you were born, 
You have learned about a scattered and unsecured world, 
Where even children were unsafe; where poverty, hunger, 
War and germs were standing against whose children as opposition.

It was your father whose Gipsy life and the screams of uncountable firm workers, 
And the soundless cry of your unprivileged mother
And your scary youth set you and your pearl-like voice, 
Your vocal length for the rest of your life, 
Which, now we have recognized it in many different ways
With countless prefixes.

Those misery and mystery of your youth let you
To think of the ones on the other side of the wall, in the dark. 
And the surging current of those days that re-designed your path of life, 
Gradually turned into a powerful tsunami of creation.

And we, black and colored people
Living in Asia, African and Latin America, who have
Learned that you were the light of our dream.
You, who have lit that light onto your own skin, 
And learned that physical sickness could change skin color.
So, color did not define human beings, 
It could only be the slaves of human behavior.

Your music, your dance, your voice, appearances
And the beautiful moon-walk
Orchestrated million agonies—
In the name of children and green, 
In the name of human beings.
Countless wars, famine and curse of poverty, 
Which became intolerable to every heart of the world, 
You have sang against like Noah's Ark.

Your music was a unique protest
That pierced through the skies, 
The skies of the world, 
setting Gabon and Chicago on its cover page, 
Setting the crystal sky of Never Land all over it; 
Kept your journey towards centuries.

Jackson, you learned, 
Art did not have a particular motherland; 
Artists should not have any national barriers; 
So, you could see our youths of the uniqueness
Walk with holding hands, walk through
the muddy and dusty paths of Asia, Africa 
And Latin America.

Dear Michael Jackson, you were a poet, 
A good friend of us—
Whose brown skin had painted with the germs of the world, 
And you have corrected it, 
And you have proved that color has no internal right, 
And your heart was the gentle garden of Art, 
Which could be recognized even by the simplicity of a child—
Art meant craziness, art meant babies; 
In the human court, under social justification.

Art is not a social norm, nor was it the birthing ground of our values, 
Keeping this truthfulness inside your heart
You have gone to an internal sleep with your own dignity.
You have seen yourself in the center of beauty and truth, ugliness too, 
Moon therefore trembled beneath your feet. 
Jackson, from the Never Land to Gabon and touching the Egyptian sky
You have spread your self into the vest sky of the world, 
Not as a Black, nor as a white, as the perfect map of the world.
Your voice, your music, with your unique dancing style
Now waving through the water wave, clouds, countries and towards the horizon, 
Into the barren land, dieing green and the everlasting skin of the grass.





Vere pleacemen do resort,
A wenerable hinstitute,
'Tis call'd the Pallis Court.
A gent as got his i on it,
I think 'twill make some sport.

The natur of this Court
My hindignation riles:
A few fat legal spiders
Here set spin their viles;
To rob the town theyr privlege is,
In a hayrea of twelve miles.

The Judge of this year Court
Is a mellitary beak,
He knows no more of Lor
Than praps he does of Greek,
And prowides hisself a deputy
Because he cannot speak.

Four counsel in this Court—
Misnamed of Justice—sits;
These lawyers owes their places to
Their money, not their wits;
And there's six attornies under them,
As here their living gits.

These lawyers, six and four,
Was a livin at their ease,
A sendin of their writs abowt,
And droring in the fees,
When their erose a cirkimstance
As is like to make a breeze.

It now is some monce since,
A gent both good and trew
Possest an ansum oss vith vich
He didn know what to do:
Peraps he did not like the oss;
Peraps he was a scru.

This gentleman his oss
At Tattersall's did lodge;
There came a wulgar oss-dealer,
This gentleman's name did fodge,
And took the oss from Tattersall's
Wasn that a artful dodge?

One day this gentleman's groom
This willain did spy out,
A mounted on this oss
A ridin him about;
'Get out of that there oss, you rogue,'
Speaks up the groom so stout.

The thief was cruel whex'd
To find himself so pinn'd;
The oss began to whinny,
The honest gloom he grinn'd;
And the raskle thief got off the oss
And cut avay like vind.

And phansy with what joy
The master did regard
His dearly bluvd lost oss again
Trot in the stable yard!

Who was this master good
Of whomb I makes these rhymes?
His name is Jacob Homnium, Exquire;
And if I'd committed crimes,
Attack me in the Times!

Now shortly after the groomb
His master's oss did take up,
There came a livery-man
This gentleman to wake up;
And he handed in a little bill,
Which hangered Mr. Jacob.

For two pound seventeen
This livery-man eplied,
For the keep of Mr. Jacob's oss,
Which the thief had took to ride.
'Do you see anythink green in me?'
Mr. Jacob Homnium cried.

'Because a raskle chews
My oss away to robb,
And goes tick at your Mews
For seven-and-fifty bobb,
Shall I be call'd to pay?—It is
A iniquitious Jobb.'

Thus Mr. Jacob cut
The conwasation short;
The livery-man went ome,
Detummingd to ave sport,
And summingsd Jacob Homnium, Exquire,
Into the Pallis Court.

Pore Jacob went to Court,
A Counsel for to fix,
And choose a barrister out of the four,
An attorney of the six:
And there he sor these men of Lor,
And watch'd 'em at their tricks.

The dreadful day of trile
In the Pallis Court did come;
The lawyers said their say,
The Judge look'd wery glum,
And then the British Jury cast
Pore Jacob Hom-ni-um.

O a weary day was that
For Jacob to go through;
The debt was two seventeen
(Which he no mor owed than you),
And then there was the plaintives costs,
Eleven pound six and two.

And then there was his own,
Which the lawyers they did fix
At the wery moderit figgar
Of ten pound one and six.
Now Evins bless the Pallis Court,
And all its bold ver-dicks!

I cannot settingly tell
If Jacob swaw and cust,
At aving for to pay this sumb;
But I should think he must,
And av drawn a cheque for L. .
With most igstreme disgust.

O Pallis Court, you move
My pitty most profound.
A most emusing sport
You thought it, I'll be bound,
To saddle hup a three-pound debt,
With two-and-twenty pound.

Good sport it is to you
To grind the honest pore,
To pay their just or unjust debts
With eight hundred per cent. for Lor;
Make haste and get your costes in,
They will not last much mor!

Come down from that tribewn,
Thou shameless and Unjust;
Thou Swindle, picking pockets in
The name of Truth august:
Come down, thou hoary blasphemy,
For die thou shalt and must.

And go it, Jacob Homnium,
And ply your iron pen,
And rise up, Sir John Jervis,
And shut me up that den;
That sty for fattening lawyers in,
On the bones of honest men. 

We may follow without fear;
East or West, by land or sea,
Home, with him, is everywhere;
When from Esau Jacob fled,
Though his pillow was a stone,
And the ground his humble bed,
Yet he was not left alone. 

Kings are often waking kept,
Racked with cares on beds of state;
Never king like Jacob slept.
For he lay at heaven's gate:
Lo! he saw a ladder reared,
Reaching to the heav'nly throne;
Spake and claimed him for his own. 

Fear not, Jacob, thou art mine,
And my presence with thee goes;
On thy heart my love shall shine,
And my arm subdue thy foes:
From my promise comfort take;
For my help in trouble call;
Never will I thee forsake,
'Till I have accomplished all. 

Well does Jacob's ladder suit
To the gospel throne of grace;
We are at the ladder's foot,
Every hour, in every place
By affirming flesh and blood,

They who know the Saviour's name,
Are for all events prepared
What can changes do to them,
Who have such a Guide and Guard?
Should they traverse earth around,
To the ladder still they come;
Every spot is holy ground,

And did I climb
    a snow-capped mountain
to find that you weren't there? 

And did a bitter wind
    of loneliness wrap me
with cold care? 

And did you know
    my desperate struggle
would have a fruitless end? 

And did you know
    I loved you more
than just a casual friend? 

the foundation of my conception of love
when i think of what a black woman should be
its u that i first think of

u will never fully understand
how deeply my heart feels u
i worry that we'll grow apart
and i'll end up losing u

u bring me climax without sex
and u do it all with regal grace
u r my heart in human form

THE patient craftsman of the East who made
His undulant dragons of the veined jade,
And wound their sinuous volutes round the whole
Pellucid green redundance of the bowl,
Chiseled his subtle traceries with the same
Keen stone he wrought them in.
Nor praise, nor blame,
Nor gifts the years relinquish or refuse,
But only a grief commensurate with thy soul,
Shall carve it in a shape for gods to use. 


YOUNG Jem at noon return'd from school, 
As hungry as could be, 
He cried to Sue, the servant-maid, 
'My dinner give to me. ' 

Said Sue, 'It is not yet come home;
Besides, it is not late. ' 
'No matter that, ' cries little Jem, 
'I do not like to wait. ' 

Quick to the baker's Jemmy went
And ask'd, 'Is dinner done?' 
'It is,' replied the baker's man. 
'Then home with it I'll run.' 

'Nay, Sir, ' replied he prudently, 
'I tell you 'tis too hot, 
And much too heavy 'tis for you. ' 
'I tell you it is not.' 

'Papa, mamma, are both gone out, 
And I for dinner long; 
So give it me, it is all mine, 
And baker, hold your tongue. 

'A shoulder 'tis of mutton nice! 
And batter-pudding too; 
I'm glad of that, it is so good; 
How clever is our Sue! ' 

Now near the door young Jem was come, 
He round the corner turn'd, 
But oh, sad fate! unlucky chance! 
The dish his fingers burn'd.

Now in the kennel down fell dish, 
And down fell all the meat: 
Swift went the pudding in the stream, 
And sail'd along the street. 

The people laugh'd, and rude boys grinn'd
At mutton's hapless fall; 
But though ashamed, young Jemmy cried, 
'Better lose part than all.' 

The shoulder by the knuckle seized, 
His hands both grasp'd it fast, 
And deaf to all their gibes and cries,
He gain'd his home at last.

'Impatience is a fault,' cries Jem, 
'The baker told me true; 
In future I will patient be, 
A shifty mother's shiftless son,
Bred up among intrigues and plots,
Learned in all things, wise in none.
Ungainly, babbling, wasteful, weak,
Shrewd, clever, cowardly, pedantic,
The sight of steel would blanch his cheek,
The smell of baccy drive him frantic.
He was the author of his line--
He wrote that witches should be burnt;
He wrote that monarchs were divine,
And left a son who--proved they weren't!


No matter what you call it,
Whether genius, or art,
He sings the simple songs that come
The closest to your heart.
Fur trim an' skillful phrases,
I do not keer a jot;
'Tain't the words alone, but feelin's,
That tech the tender spot.
An' that's jest why I love him,--
Why, he's got sech human feelin',
An' in ev'ry song he gives us,
You kin see it creepin', stealin',
Through the core the tears go tricklin',
But the edge is bright an' smiley;
I never saw a poet
Like that poet Whitcomb Riley.

His heart keeps beatin' time with our'n
In measures fast or slow;
He tells us jest the same ol' things
Our souls have learned to know.
He paints our joys an' sorrers
In a way so stric'ly true,
That a body can't help knowin'
That he has felt them too.
If there's a lesson to be taught,
He never fears to teach it,
An' he puts the food so good an' low
That the humblest one kin reach it.
Now in our time, when poets rhyme
For money, fun, or fashion,
'Tis good to hear one voice so clear
That thrills with honest passion.
So let the others build their songs,
An' strive to polish highly,--
There's none of them kin tech the heart
Like our own Whitcomb Riley. 

There was grief within our household 
Because of a vacant chair. 
Our mother, so loved and precious, 
No longer was sitting there. 

Our hearts grew heavy with sorrow, 
Our eyes with tears were blind, 
And little Jamie was wondering, 
Why we were left behind. 

We had told our little darling, 
Of the land of love and light, 
Of the saints all crowned with glory, 
And enrobed in spotless white. 

We said that our precious mother, 
Had gone to that land so fair, 
To dwell with beautiful angels, 
And to be forever there. 

But the child was sorely puzzled, 
Why dear grandmamma should go 
To dwell in a stranger city, 
When her children loved her so. 

But again the mystic angel 
Came with swift and silent tread, 
And our sister, Jamie's mother, 
Was enrolled among the dead. 

To us the mystery deepened, 
To Jamie it seemed more clear; 
Grandma, he said, must be lonesome, 
And mamma has gone to her. 

But the question lies unanswered 
In our little Jamie's mind, 
Why she should go to our mother, 
And leave her children behind; 

To dwell in that lovely city, 
From all that was dear to part, 
From children who loved to nestle 
So closely around her heart. 

Dear child, like you, we are puzzled, 
With problems that still remain; 
But think in the great hereafter 
Their meaning will all be plain.


There were two little girls, neither handsome nor plain; 
One's name was Eliza, the other's was Jane: 
They were both of one height, as I've heard people say, 
They were both of one age, I believe, to a day. 

'Twas fancied by some, who but slightly had seen them, 
That scarcely a difference was there between them; 
But no one for long in this notion persisted,
So great a distinction there really existed. 

Eliza knew well that she could not be pleasing,
While fretting and fuming, while sulky or teasing;
And therefore in company artfully tried­
Not to break her bad habits, but only to hide. 

So when she was out, with much labour and pain, 
She contrived to look almost a pleasant as Jane; 
But then you might see, that in forcing a smile,
Her mouth was uneasy, and ached all the while. 

And in spite of her care, it would sometimes befall,
That some cross event happen'd to ruin it all; 
And because it might chance that her share was the worst,
Her temper broke loose, and her dimples dispersed. 

But Jane, who had nothing she wanted to hide,
And therefore these troublesome arts never tried, 
Had none of the care and fatigue of concealing,
But her face always show'd what her bosom was feeling. 

At home or abroad there was peace in her smile,
A cheerful good nature that needed no guile. 
And Eliza work'd hard, but could never obtain
The affection that freely was given to Jane. 


The opals hiding your lids
  as you sleep, as you ride ponies
mysteriously, spring to bloom
  like the blue flowers of autumn

each nine o'clock. And curls
  tumble languorously towards
the yawning rubber band, tan,
  your hand pressing all that

riotous black sleep into
  the quiet form of daylight
and its sunny disregard for
  the luminous volutions, oh!

and the budding waltzes
  we swoop through in nights.
Before dawn you roar with
  your eyes shut, unsmiling,

your volcanic flesh hides
  everything from the watchman,
and the tendrils of dreams
  strangle policemen running by

too slowly to escape you,
  the racing vertiginous waves
of your murmuring need. But
  he is day's guardian saint

that policeman, and leaning
  from your open window you ask
him what to dress to wear and
  to comb your hair modestly,

for that is now your mode.
  Only by chance tripping on stairs
do you repeat the dance, and
  then, in the perfect variety of

subdued, impeccably disguised,
  white black pink blue saffron
and golden ambiance, do we find
  the nightly savage, in a trance. 


Jane went to Paradise:
That was only fair.
Good Sir Walter followed her,
And armed her up the stair.
Henry and Tobias,
And Miguel of Spain,
Stood with Shakespeare at the top
To welcome Jane--

Then the Three Archangels
Offered out of hand
Anything in Heaven's gift
That she might command.
Azrael's eyes upon her,
Raphael's wings above,
Michael's sword against her heart,
Jane said: "Love




Instantly the under-
Standing Seraphim
Laid their fingers on their lips
And went to look for him.
Stole across the Zodiac,
Harnessed Charles's Wain,
And whispered round the Nebulae
"Who loved Jane?"

In a private limbo
Where none had thought to look,
Sat a Hampshire gentleman 
Reading of a book.
It was called Persuasion
And it told the plain
Story of the love between
Him and Jane.

He heard the question,
Circle Heaven through--
Closed the book and answered:
"I did -- and do!"
Quietly but speedily
(As Captain Wentworth moved)
Entered into Paradise
The man Jane loved!


Jane lies in Winchester, blessed be her shade!
And while the stones of Winchester--or Milson Street--remain,
Glory, Love, and Honour unto England's Jane

fire, light, storm gone home; 
Governing darkness roaring: 
Januadilemma*. 

Again I reply to the triple winds 
running chromatic fifths of derision 
outside my window: 
Play louder. 
You will not succeed. I am 
bound more to my sentences 
the more you batter at me 
to follow you. 
And the wind, 
as before, fingers perfectly 
its derisive music. 


Pavement slipp'ry, people sneezing,
Titled gluttons dainties carving,
Genius in a garret starving.

Lofty mansions, warm and spacious ;
Courtiers clinging and voracious ;
Misers scarce the wretched heeding ;
Gallant soldiers fighting, bleeding.

Wives who laugh at passive spouses ;
Theatres, and meeting-houses ;
Balls, where simp'ring misses languish ;
Hospitals, and groans of anguish.

Arts and sciences bewailing ;
Commerce drooping, credit failing ;
Placemen mocking subjects loyal ;
Separations, weddings royal.

Authors who can't earn a dinner ;
Many a subtle rogue a winner ;
Fugitives for shelter seeking ;
Misers hoarding, tradesmen breaking.

Taste and talents quite deserted ;
All the laws of truth perverted ;
Arrogance o'er merit soaring ;
Merit silently deploring.

Ladies gambling night and morning ;
Fools the works of genius scorning ;
Ancient dames for girls mistaken,
Youthful damsels quite forsaken.

Some in luxury delighting ;
More in talking than in fighting ;
Lovers old, and beaux decrepid ;

Poets, painters, and musicians ;
Lawyers, doctors, politicians :
Pamphlets, newspapers, and odes,
Seeking fame by diff'rent roads.

Gallant souls with empty purses ;
Gen'rals only fit for nurses ;
School-boys, smit with martial spirit,
Taking place of vet'ran merit.

Honest men who can't get places,
Knaves who shew unblushing faces ;
Ruin hasten'd, peace retarded ;
Candour spurn'd, and art rewarded. 


Because the pleasure-bird whistles after the hot wires,
Shall the blind horse sing sweeter?
Convenient bird and beast lie lodged to suffer
The supper and knives of a mood.
In the sniffed and poured snow on the tip of the tongue of the year
That clouts the spittle like bubbles with broken rooms,
An enamoured man alone by the twigs of his eyes, two fires,
Camped in the drug-white shower of nerves and food,
Savours the lick of the times through a deadly wood of hair
In a wind that plucked a goose,
Nor ever, as the wild tongue breaks its tombs,
Rounds to look at the red, wagged root.
Because there stands, one story out of the bum city,
That frozen wife whose juices drift like a fixed sea
Secretly in statuary,
Shall I, struck on the hot and rocking street,
Not spin to stare at an old year
Toppling and burning in the muddle of towers and galleries
Like the mauled pictures of boys?
The salt person and blasted place
I furnish with the meat of a fable.
If the dead starve, their stomachs turn to tumble
An upright man in the antipodes
Or spray-based and rock-chested sea:
Over the past table I repeat this present grace. 


COLD January comes in Winter's car,
Thick hung with icicles-its heavy wheels
Cumbered with clogging snow, which cracks and peels
With its least motion or concussive jar
'Gainst hard hid ruts, or hewn trees buried far
In the heaped whiteness which awhile conceals
That well-fed and wine-reeling wassailer,-
With all his feasts and fires, feels cold and shivers,
And the red runnel of his indolent blood
Creeps slow and curdled as a northern flood.
And lakes and winter-rills, impetuous rivers
And headlong cataracts, are in silence bound,
Like trammelled tigers lashed to th'unyielding ground


January was a girl
Who couldn't decide between two men
Her head was in a swirl
When she started to compare

She was a Daddy's girl
Caught up in a dream world
With high school it-girls to impress
Donned up in her vintage dress

More than once she didn't know
Where she belonged, where she should go
A handsome young man she disliked and rejected
Without her Daddy she felt so unprotected

A fateful day took him from her
He boarded the plane and died in the air
January was devastated
Her teenage life was confiscated

She married a man who treated her badly
Just because he reminded her of her Daddy
Youth wasn't for her, she was too mature
And to marry a young boy she couldn't endure

Sadly our girl chose the wrong way out
When she didn't make it to the house
A lover's alliance would have saved her life
She decided to keep an unprofitable strife

Nobody was good enough for her
Her idolatry too hard to please
But in all her devotion she couldn't see
That January was over


Black ship of night
sailing through the world
& the moon an orange slice
tangy to the teeth
of lovers who lie
under it,
sucking it.

Somewhere there are palm trees;
somewhere the sea
bluely gathers itself up
& lets itself fall again
into green;
somewhere the spangles
of light on the ocean
dazzle the eyes;
but here in the midnight city,
the black ship of night
has docked
for a long, dark stay,
& even the citrus moon
with its pockets of juice
cannot sweeten the dark.

Then the snow begins,
whirling over the Pole,
gathering force over Canada,
sprinkling the Great Lakes with sugar
which drowns in their deep black cups;
it is drawn to the spires of New York
& the flurries come
scampering at first,
lighthearted, crystalline, white,
but finally
sucked into the city
as into a black hole
in space.

The sky is suddenly pink-
pink as flesh: breasts,
babies' bottoms. Night is
day; day is whiter than the desert;
the city stops like a heart;
pigeons dip & veer
& come to rest
under the snow-hatted
watertanks. 

January jumps about
in the frying pan
trying to heat
his frozen feet
like a Canadian.

February scuttles under
any dish's lid
and she thinks she's dry because she's
thoroughly well hid
but it still rains all month long
and it always did.

March sits in the bath tub
with the taps turned on.
Hot and cold, cold or not,
Has the Winter gone?
In like a lion, out like a lamb
March on, march on, march on.

April slips about
sometimes indoors
and sometimes out
sometimes sheltering from a little
shower of bright rain
in an empty milk bottle
then dashing out again.

May, she hides nowhere,
nowhere at all,
Proud as a peacock
walking by a wall.
The Maytime O the Maytime,
full of leaf and flower.
The Maytime O the Maytime
is the loveliest of all.

June discards his shirt and
trousers by the stream
and takes the first dip of the year
into a jug of cream.
June is the gay time
of every girl and boy
who run about and sing and shout
in pardonable joy.

July by the sea
sits dabbling with sand
letting it run out of
her rather lazy hand,
and sometimes she sadly
thinks: "As I sit here
ah, more than half the year is gone,
the evanescent year

August by an emperor
was given his great name.
It is gold and purple
like a Hall of Fame.
(I have known it rather cold
and wettish, all the same.)

September lies in shadows
of the fading summer
hearing, in the distance,
the silver horns of winter
and not very far off
the coming autumn drummer.

October, October
apples on the tree,
the Partridge in the Wood and
the big winds at sea,
the mud beginning in the lane
the berries bright and red
and the big tree wildly
tossing its old head.

November, when the fires
love to burn, and leaves
flit about and fill the air
where the old tree grieves.
November, November
its name is like a star
glittering on many things that were
but few things that are.

Twelfth and last December.
a few weeks away
we hear the silver bells
of the stag and the sleigh
flying from the tundras
far far away
bringing to us all the gift



I

I have discovered that most of 
the beauties of travel are due to 
the strange hours we keep to see them: 

the domes of the Church of 
the Paulist Fathers in Weehawken 
against a smoky dawn -- the heart stirred -- 
are beautiful as Saint Peters 
approached after years of anticipation. 

II 

Though the operation was postponed 
I saw the tall probationers 
in their tan uniforms 
hurrying to breakfast! 

III 

-- and from basement entries 
neatly coiffed, middle aged gentlemen 
with orderly moustaches and 
well-brushed coats 

IV 

-- and the sun, dipping into the avenues 
streaking the tops of 
the irregular red houselets, 
and 
the gay shadows drooping and drooping. 

V 

-- and a young horse with a green bed-quilt 
on his withers shaking his head: 
bared teeth and nozzle high in the air! 

VI 

--and a semicircle of dirt-colored men 
about a fire bursting from an old 
ash can, 

VII 

-- and the worn, 
blue car rails (like the sky!) 
gleaming among the cobbles! 

VIII 

-- and the rickety ferry-boat "Arden"! 
What an object to be called "Arden" 
among the great piers, -- on the 
ever new river! 
"Put me a Touchstone 
at the wheel, white gulls, and we'll 
follow the ghost of the Half Moon 
to the North West Passage -- and through! 
(at Albany!) for all that!" 

IX 

Exquisite brown waves -- long 
circlets of silver moving over you! 
enough with crumbling ice crusts among you! 
The sky has come down to you, 
lighter than tiny bubbles, face to 
face with you! 
His spirit is 
a white gull with delicate pink feet 
and a snowy breast for you to 
hold to your lips delicately! 

X 

The young doctor is dancing with happiness 
in the sparkling wind, alone 
at the prow of the ferry! He notices 
the curdy barnacles and broken ice crusts 
left at the slip's base by the low tide 
and thinks of summer and green 
shell-crusted ledges among 
the emerald eel-grass! 

XI 

Who knows the Palisades as I do 
knows the river breaks east from them 
above the city -- but they continue south 
-- under the sky -- to bear a crest of 
little peering houses that brighten 
with dawn behind the moody 
water-loving giants of Manhattan. 

XII 

Long yellow rushes bending 
above the white snow patches; 
purple and gold ribbon 
of the distant wood: 
what an angle 
you make with each other as 
you lie there in contemplation. 

XIII 

Work hard all your young days 
and they'll find you too, some morning 
staring up under 
your chiffonier at its warped 
bass-wood bottom and your soul -- 
out! 
-- among the little sparrows 
behind the shutter. 

XIV 

-- and the flapping flags are at 
half-mast for the dead admiral. 

XV 

All this -- 
was for you, old woman. 
I wanted to write a poem 
that you would understand. 
For what good is it to me 
if you can't understand it? 
But you got to try hard -- 
But -- 
Well, you know how 
the young girls run giggling 
on Park Avenue after dark 
when they ought to be home in bed? 
Well, 
that's the way it is with me somehow. 

Today I pass the time reading
a favorite haiku,
saying the few words over and over.

It feels like eating
the same small, perfect grape
again and again.

I walk through the house reciting it
and leave its letters falling
through the air of every room.

I stand by the big silence of the piano and say it.
I say it in front of a painting of the sea.
I tap out its rhythm on an empty shelf.

I listen to myself saying it,
then I say it without listening,
then I hear it without saying it.

And when the dog looks up at me,
I kneel down on the floor
and whisper it into each of his long white ears.

It's the one about the one-ton temple bell
with the moth sleeping on its surface,

and every time I say it, I feel the excruciating
pressure of the moth
on the surface of the iron bell.

When I say it at the window,
the bell is the world
and I am the moth resting there.

When I say it at the mirror,
I am the heavy bell
and the moth is life with its papery wings.

And later, when I say it to you in the dark,
you are the bell,
and I am the tongue of the bell, ringing you,

and the moth has flown
from its line
and moves like a hinge in the air above our bed. 


Everything has been taken that anyone
thought worth taking. The stairs are tilted,
scattered with sycamore leaves curled
like ammonites in inland rock.
Wood shows through the paint on the frame
and the door is open--an empty room,
sunlight on the floor. All that is left
on the porch is the hollow cylinder
of an Albert's Quick Oats cardboard box
and a sewing machine. Its extraterrestrial
head is bowed, its scrolled neck
glistens. I was born, that day, near there,
in wartime, of ignorant people. 


Sleep, little pigeon, and fold your wings,--
 Little blue pigeon with velvet eyes;
Sleep to the singing of mother-bird swinging--
 Swinging the nest where her little one lies.

Away out yonder I see a star,--
 Silvery star with a tinkling song;
To the soft dew falling I hear it calling--
 Calling and tinkling the night along.

In through the window a moonbeam comes,--
 Little gold moonbeam with misty wings;
All silently creeping, it asks, "Is he sleeping--
 Sleeping and dreaming while mother sings?"

Up from the sea there floats the sob
 Of the waves that are breaking upon the shore,
As though they were groaning in anguish, and moaning--
 Bemoaning the ship that shall come no more.

But sleep, little pigeon, and fold your wings,--
 Little blue pigeon with mournful eyes;
Am I not singing?--see, I am swinging--
 Swinging the nest where my darling lies. 


Jasmine jasmine jasmine 
I’m waiting. i’m sure you 
Know because you are 
The reason I’m waiting.
You make me smile you 
Make me laugh you keep
Me content this is why I wait 
Because jasmine jasmine 


Beautiful you were 
Beautiful you are 
Beautiful you will remain
Beauty on the outside 
Not as precious as 
Beauty on the inside
You retain both in perfect
Balance and abstain from
The evils of attitude your 
Outer beauty is covering
Your worries and fear 
To smile through tears
Your inner beauty is
Marred by this for
You hold everything
Within let go let love 
Let me let god I owe
You happiness for
You have gave me 
Plenty so I must 
Say jasmine please 
Let me in


Your scent is in the room. 
Swiftly it overwhelms and conquers me! 
Jasmines, night jasmines, perfect of perfume, 
Heavy with dew before the dawn of day! 
Your face was in the mirror. I could see 
You smile and vanish suddenly away, 
Leaving behind the vestige of a tear. 
Sad suffering face, from parting grown so dear! 
Night jasmines cannot bloom in this cold place; 
Without the street is wet and weird with snow; 
The cold nude trees are tossing to and fro; 
Too stormy is the night for your fond face; 
For your low voice too loud the wind's mad roar. 
But, oh, your scent is here--jasmines that grow 
Luxuriant, clustered round your cottage door

Whatever comes out of the heart is effective
It has no wings but has the power of flight

It has holy origins, it aims at elegance
It rises from dust, but has access to the celestial world

        My love was seditious, rebellious and clever
        My fearless wailing rent through the sky

On hearing it the sun said, 'Somewhere there is somebody! '
The planets said, 'At the 'Arsh-i-Bar


Death drips 
Upon the tongue

Breaks the neck 
And I am hung - 

His rope
Of circumscription
Closing in

Click-snap 
Syncopates

Jazzing up the end


Is the spontaneity no other music has
Without spaces and bars, the artists succeeded
No written notes were musically needed

Improvisations coming straight from the heart
From artists like Armstrong, who were there near the start
Pianoed feelings in sound, both catchy and racy

Ellington wrote "Black Brown and Beige"
A musical history of torment and rage
To show how skin color neatly provided
Bigots the means to keep people divided   

"No more oppression", Jazz artists cried out
"Demands for our freedom will never die out"
"Strange Fruit", Billie Holliday sang out in pain
Jim Crow’s bigotry was an American Stain

Charlie Parker flying high, known as the Bird
His message would soar when his sax was heard
He defied all convention, his music exploded 
And showed all of us that bounds were outmoded

Jazz was the outlet for pent-up emotion
No wonder it’s aired with such depth and devotion
Those musical artists paid more then their dues
Jazz sprang from their feelings of sadness and bluesreading poetry
accompanied with smooth jazz; 
takes me to heaven 


Oh, shining rivers of the soul! 

In a Harlem cabaret 
Six long-headed jazzers play. 
A dancing girl whose eyes are bold 
Lifts high a dress of silken gold. 

Oh, singing tree! 
Oh, shining rivers of the soul! 

Were Eve's eyes 
In the first garden 
Just a bit too bold? 
Was Cleopatra gorgeous 
In a gown of gold? 

Oh, shining tree! 
Oh, silver rivers of the soul! 

In a whirling cabaret 
Six long-headed jazzers play. 

I've not forgotten, near to the town,
our white house, small but alone:
its Pomona of plaster, its Venus of old
hiding nude limbs in the meagre grove,
and the sun, superb, at evening, streaming,
behind the glass, where its sheaves were bursting,
a huge eye in a curious heaven, present
to gaze at our meal, lengthy and silent,
spreading its beautiful candle glimmer
on the frugal cloth and the rough curtain. 



It has happened suddenly,
by surprise, in an arbor,
or while drinking good coffee,
after speaking, or before,

that I dumbly inhabit
a density; in language,
there is nothing to stop it,
for nothing retains an edge.

Simple ignorance presents,
later, words for a function,
but it is common pretense
of speech, by a convention,

and there is nothing at all
but inner silence, nothing
to relieve on principle
now this intense thickening. 




I Adore You as Much as the Nocturnal Vault


I adore you as much as the nocturnal vault, 
O vase of sadness, most taciturn one, 
I love you all the more because you flee from me, 
And because you appear, ornament of my nights, 
More ironically to multiply the leagues 
That separate my arms from the blue infinite.

I advance to attack, and I climb to assault, 
Like a swarm of maggots after a cadaver, 
And I cherish, implacable and cruel beast, 
Even that coldness which makes you more beautiful.



More Than Night's Vault, It's You That I Adore 

More than night's vault, it's you that I adore, 
Vessel of sorrow, silent one, the more 
Because you flee from me, and seem to place, 
Ornament of my nights! more leagues of space 
Ironically between me and you 
Than part me from these vastitudes of blue.

I charge, attack, and mount to the assault
As worms attack a corpse within a vault.
And cherish even the coldness that you boast,
By which, harsh beast, you subjugate me most.



I Worship You

I worship you, O proud and taciturn,
As I do night's high vault; O sorrow's urn,
I love you all the more because you flee
And seem, gem of my nights, ironically
To multiply the weary leagues that sunder
My arms from all infinity's blue wonder.

I skirmish and I climb to the attack,
I, a worms' chorus on a corpse's back,
O fierce cruel beast, I cherish to the full
The very chill that makes you beautiful.





When I see you, who were so wise and cool,
Gazing with silly sickness on that fool
You've given your love to, your adoring hands
Touch his so intimately that each understands,
I know, most hidden things; and when I know
Your holiest dreams yield to the stupid bow
Of his red lips, and that the empty grace
Of those strong legs and arms, that rosy face,
Has beaten your heart to such a flame of love,
That you have given him every touch and move,
Wrinkle and secret of you, all your life,
-- Oh! then I know I'm waiting, lover-wife,
For the great time when love is at a close,
And all its fruit's to watch the thickening nose
And sweaty neck and dulling face and eye,
That are yours, and you, most surely, till you die!
Day after day you'll sit with him and note
The greasier tie, the dingy wrinkling coat;
As prettiness turns to pomp, and strength to fat,
And love, love, love to habit!
                                And after that,
When all that's fine in man is at an end,
And you, that loved young life and clean, must tend
A foul sick fumbling dribbling body and old,
When his rare lips hang flabby and can't hold
Slobber, and you're enduring that worst thing,
Senility's queasy furtive love-making,
And searching those dear eyes for human meaning,
Propping the bald and helpless head, and cleaning
A scrap that life's flung by, and love's forgotten, --
Then you'll be tired; and passion dead and rotten;
And he'll be dirty, dirty!
                            O lithe and free
And lightfoot, that the poor heart cries to see,
That's how I'll see your man and you! --



She sat upon her Seven Hills
She rent the scarlet robes about her,
Nor yet in her two thousand years
Had ever grieved that men should doubt her;
But what new horror shakes the mind
Making her moan and mutter madly;
Lo! Rome's high heart is broken at last
Her foes have borrowed Dennis Bradley.

If she must lean on lesser props
Of earthly fame or ancient art,
Make shift with Raphael and Racine
Put up with Dante and Descartes,
Not wholly can she mask her grief
But touch the wound and murmur sadly,
'These lesser things are theirs to love
Who lose the love of Mr. Bradley.'

She saw great Origen depart
And Photius rend the world asunder,
Her cry to all the East rolled back
In Islam its ironic thunder,
She lost Jerusalem and the North
Accepting these arrangements gladly
Until it came to be a case
Of Conan Doyle v. Dennis Bradley.

O fond and foolish hopes that still
In broken hearts unbroken burn,
What if, grown weary of new ways,
The precious wanderer should return
The Trumpet whose uncertain sound
Has just been cracking rather badly
May yet within her courts remain
His Trumpet-blown by Dennis Bradley.

His and her Trumpet blown before
The battle where the good cause wins
Louder than all the Irish harps
Or the Italian violins;
When armed and mounted like St. Joan
She meets the mad world riding madly
Under the Oriflamme of old
Crying, 'Mont-joie St. Dennis Bradley!'

But in this hour she sorrows still,
Though all anew the generations
Rise up and call her blessed, claim
Her name upon the new born Nations
But still she mourns the only thing
She ever really wanted badly;
The sympathy of Conan Doyle
The patronage of Dennis Bradley. 

He must feel blooded with the spirit of a god
to sit opposite you and listen, and reply,
to your talk, your laughter, your touching,
breath-held silences. But what I feel, sitting here
and watching you, so stops my heart and binds
my tongue that I can't think what I might say
to breach the aureole around you there.
It's as if someone with flint and stone had sparked
a fire that kindled the flesh along my arms
and smothered me in its smoke-blind rush.
Paler than summer grass, it seems
I am already dead, or little short of dying. 

Never  at  heart's  ease
Should  one  be greater
Than  her
This  green eyed   other  self-
Twin  sister  of  love.

Born  from  lack  of  self confidence
Grows  into  the  proud  child
Of  envy  that  perverts  the  mind
feels  pleasure in  the  reverse, 
Cruel  as  the  grave, 


Can  endure  its own  despair
But  not  neighbour's  hope.
To  ignore  the  force  of  jealousy
Is  to  deny  the  gravity
Of  this  strange  passion. 

Jealousy haunts golden lily, 
Watching the riverside lady, 
Angelic ebullient eyes unwary
Of the orchids stare and envy; 

Rose no match for pink lips, 
Nor it’s dangling stocks, 
Nearest to her comely hips, 
Nor the swaying buttocks; 

Lotus feels quail and nervous, 
Whenever lady is amorous, 
As her cheek turns rosy pink, 
Making lotus flinch and shrink. 



Resentment mixed with greed
Are the tunes she sings
From love and lust she bleed
On envy she feed
In human's core she live
Upset with what she loves
Envious of hearts possession
Dirtier than dirt
More twisted than a devil
It was her that corrupted him
And changed him into a rotten apple
Her song is a terrible thing
It opens a gate to other sins
This sour vindictive witch
And straight into the fires of hell! 




Jealousy Is The Nature Of The Beast.

Don't tell me I don't know how you feel
I couldn't possibly feel that need.
Like a thousand hidden voices
whispering deep inside your head
telling you  
this is who you are.

You fight repression
the growing need, rising like a wave
prodding, teasing, prickling in your mind
but the whispers get louder
till they are screaming out now.

The only voice you hear
the only voice you want to hear
and you belong to this shadow
you become a dark passenger to it
inevitably you will succumb.

To fight against it is fatal
as it will overpower you into submission
the addiction, the need to overcome
the willpower to succeed, 
demise with every single thought.

As the power of the wave
engulfs you
rendering you somewhat helpless
as jealousy is the nature's beast. 

Orson Welles is a poet
through his violence
and through his grace.
Never does he tumble
from the tightrope
on which he crosses cities
and their dramas.

He is a poet too in the
Loyal friendship he bears
our dreams and our struggles.

Others will know better than I
how to praise his work.
I content myself with sending him
my fraternal greeting.

His handshake is as firm as he is
and I think of it each time my work
obliges me to leap over an obstacle.

A bright and barefoot little girl
with a garland of cherry blossoms
enters the unattended village church.

She makes a shorthand cross
upon the makeshift wooden amulet 
attached to her leather necklace.

She then runs her bony fingers
through the long, black locks
parted above her forehead.

She walks past the empty benches
towards the peaceful altar
and her petite, russet-clad figure
stoops to kneel there.

She clasps her delicate hands
in front of a wooden statue
and casts her large, green eyes
upon the Saint’s figurine.

She whispers
       in a soft but confident voice:

                         – Sister Catherine. I didn’t give you
                                             the spring’s gift yesterday.

                         Mama told me to donate
                                             my pickings to Mother Mary.

                         It’s Jeannette speaking, sister
                                             in case you’ve forgotten me.

                         Please don’t be mad.
                                             Here, I hope you like these.

She places the crimson wreath
at the pedestal of the religious icon
and stands up to leaves the chapel
glowing with a heart-felt grin.




I think
          she liked the flowers.

I know I would 
          if I was a saint.

I wonder how
                    a girl gets to become a saint?

          says before there were saints
there used to be sacred women called High Priestesses 
Madame Agnes is a witch
                    and I shouldn’t listen to her.

                                             Now I should go and do my chores.

                                             Afterwards, if there’s time
                                             I’ll go with my friends
                                             to the slopes near the Fairies’ Tree.
The Tree, they say, is a hundred years old.

                                   We’ll pick lilies-of-the-valley and camellia
                    for wreaths to put on the branches of the Tree at Lent
                                   and I’ll get some jasmine
                    for Mama’s vase at home.

                                   The jasmine have such an amazing 
                         smell now
                                   in early spring.
                         The best mushrooms grow on the paddocks
                    behind the Virgin Spring.

                    I’ve heard the nuns at the Hermitage say
                              the Spring has healing powers.
                    I’ve even seen a leper and a blind monk
                              come all the way from Nancy to drink its water.

                                   I wonder if any of them is cured. I’m lucky
                    to be "strong and healthy," Mama says.
                                             She reckons
                              I was born in winter, on the night of Epiphany
                              about nine or ten years ago. She says
                    Madame Agnes says my birthday
                              was on the same day as Le Jour des Rois,
                    Day of the Kings, an ancient celebration
                              when the rich baked a cake for the beggars
                    and the last beggar to get a piece
                              was named the Bean-King, or something like                                              that. 

                              Mama says 
                                   it’s blessed for girls
                              to go down the Valley to pick 
                                              blossoms and weave garlands
                    for the images of saints in our Church
                              and for those in the Hermitage behind the Bois                                              Chesnu 
                    Oak Forest. I love
                              Saint Catherine’s statue, and Saint Margaret                                              too.
                              She sometimes looks
                                   straight at my praying and 
                                   when feeling the kindness of her eyes
                                   I wonder why Papa says
                                              the statue is a lifeless thing.

                                   Mama calls Papa sacrilegious 
                              whenever he makes fun of our praying. Why                     does he call the statue
                                   lifeless? Doesn’t wood
                                                   come from the living trees?

                                   My dress today
                                              is the colour of oak. It’s made of
                                   rough wool cut out of Mama’s old dress.
                                              She’s given it 
                                              puffy sleeves and stitched pretty                                               blue ribbons
                                              on the skirt
                              making it look like the dress
                              of a rich city girl. She says
                                              I’m short like her but have Papa’s
                                              legs.

                    I’m not sure what she means.

                              My hair’s black like Papa’s
                                   and really messy today
                                              I’ll have to get Mama to brush it
                              once I’ve been to the well
                                              and drawn water. Now

                                              she’s making lunch for Papa and the                                               boys
                                   and putting the bundle of bread and fruit
                                   into the saddle of the mule they’ll take with                                    them 
                    to the farms.
                    Sometimes they take me with them 
                                   to help with sowing the seeds, pruning the                                    plants
                              or ploughing. I like
                                   digging furrows between the rows of grape                                    and corn.
                                   I like using a sharp spade 
                                              and getting my hands dirty, but
                              being a girl, and "little"
                              Papa usually makes me take the sheep
                                   to the meadows near the Village of Maxey. 
                    I have to sit there and watch them
                                   stuff their mouths with grass and leaves.
                    I use my spinning distaff
                              for handling the silly animals when they don’t                               listen to me.

                    I have wound a bit of wool
                              on top of my staff. When I get bored with being                               a shepherdess
                    I spin the wool 
                                   around the stick. I use it
                                   like a cane when climbing a steep hillock
                    and it’s a weapon
                                   if the Maxey kids come to annoy my flock.

                              I know I’m supposed to act like a girl
                                              and scream and cry if there’s                                               trouble 
                              but sometimes I can’t help 
                                   chasing the bullies, or at least yelling at                                    them.

                                   Mama gets upset sometimes
                                   telling me I’m too much like a boy

                                   but I’m very good at spinning wool
                                   and sing with the girls
                                   the Maiden Melodies
                                              at the dances and celebrations.

                                              And today
                                                   after visiting Saint Catherine,
                                                   getting water and milking the                                                    cows, 

                                                   I’m in the kitchen with Mama
                                                   with canvas aprons over our                                                    skirts.

                                   She’s teaching me to make 
                                              the dish she calls
                                   "Our great region’s most famous cuisine."

                                   I don’t really like Quiche Lorraine.
                                   I prefer fresh bread and creamy cheese.

                    But Mama is very keen
                    and doesn’t give up until I’ve beaten my eggs
                    and made them as foamy as hers. She tells me
                                              with pride in her voice:

                    "Ah, Jeannette, have I told you about my pilgrimage to                     Rome?"

(She has. About a hundred times)

                    "There I presented a slice of our cherished pastry
                                   to our Holy Father, the Pope himself.
                    That’s why they call me
                                   Isabelle Romee, because I’ve been to the                                    Holy City."

After pouring the mixture
into the vessels covered with pastry
we take the clay pots
to the communal village oven.

Mama’s worried I could burn myself
and lets me go before
kindling the fire herself. I return home
take off the apron, put an apple 
in my pocket and fasten the clog sandals
to my ankles. I take my distaff
and go out into our back garden-
the silly rabbits 
have made it through the fence again.

I step over the leftovers of our baby carrots
and yell at the neighbour’s cottage:
                                              – Margarette! Margarette! You                                               wanna go
                                   graze the sheep?

          My oldest friend quickly runs out.
          Her golden hair is so beautiful
                    and her teeth are much nicer than mine.
          She throws herself at me
                    and giggles: "Let’s run! I’m so sick of my baby sister!
                                              She’s crying all the time!"

          And we lock arms
                    and skip in our heavy clogs 
          to where the animals are caged
                    in a fenced field behind our cottages.




          We open the strong gates 
                    and my cattle dog Claude
          a big wolfy breed called Alsatian 
                    barks the sleepy sheep into action.

                    The lazy beasts bleat unhappily.

                    I yell: "OHOY OHOY" and poke my distaff
                            into the stubborn ones refusing to move
                            accidentally hitting the grumpy ram
                            Papa’s told me to stay away from.

                            I stand still and see the horned beast
                                   huff and shiver with anger.

                                   My heart beats fast and I go
                                              to call for Margarette but how
                                   could she help?

                                              The ram attacks me.
                            I jump out of his way
                                   over the lazy sheep.

                                   But he hasn’t forgiven me
                                              and shoves the others out of his                                               way
                                   spotting me with his furious eyes
                                              and bolting towards me again.

                                   And all of a sudden 
                    a gilded image
                                   I’ve seen painted on the walls of the                                    Hermitage
                            flashes across my mind:

                                                   Saint Michael the Archangel
                                                   Hero of the Battle of Heaven                                                    and Hell

                                                   a winged, armoured knight 
                                                   pushing his lance into the                                                    throat 
                                                   of a vicious serpent.

                            All of a sudden my distaff
                                              becomes the Angel’s holy lance
                                   and I firmly aim it
                                              at the oncoming monster
                                              pushing it into his thick fleece
                                   making him stop. The ram
                                              angrily stamps his short legs                                    pushing against the tip
                                              of my hard distaff.

                                              I clench my teeth and groan 
                            against his force
                                              holding the distaff with both hands
                            when Claude, my strong wolf-dog
                                              jumps over the other sheep
                            into the scene of my battle
                                              and furiously barks at the ram
                                              who’s been outnumbered
                                              and begins to set back.

                            I pat Claude’s hairy neck
                                   when the ram has been pushed 
                            into the flow of sheep 
                                   exiting the fenced area for the pastures.

I plant my distaff into the ground
          to catch my breath while putting my messy hair
          into a horsetail. I notice
                    Margarette staring at me from the other side of the                     fence. 
          I say:

                    – Stupid ram! What was his problem?! 

Margarette doesn’t laugh
                    at my smart remark
like she usually would. Her blue eyes
are bulging with fear. She speaks
                                   hesitantly:
                                                   "Jeannette-
                                                             how did you do that?"

                    – How did I do what, Margarette?
                                                             "Fight! How did you
                                                             fight like a-
                                                                       like a-
                                                                       boy! You looked
                                                   so mean-so angry! Why didn’t                                                                        you
                                                                       cry for help?"

                    – I- dunno-

Margarette hitches her skirt
                    and steps carefully over the fence
          coming over and giving me a hug
                    her beautiful eyes breaking into tears:

                            "I was so worried.  Oh sister.  I was so                             scared. "


                            It wasn’t a wild boar or anything!

She sniffs her nose and says:      "No it wasn’t- it was- it was-
                                                   terrible- you- you
                                              scared me- don’t do that again. Promise me!"

Feeling confused and uncomfortable 
          I push her away and run towards a wandering lamb
          who’s left the others
          yelling:      –  C’mon Margarette! I wanna pick mushrooms later                             on-
                            we’re gonna run out of time. C’mon!


          That night after the Campanile 
when Papa and the boys return from the farms
          Mama serves the quiche
she’s made. My quiche
          "didn’t have the proper consistency" she reckons
and was given to the parish priest instead.

          Papa teases me:

          "You won’t find a husband if you can’t cook properly!
          We’ll have to send you to a bloody convent! How about           that?!"

          I stick my tongue out at him.
          He laughs and ruffles my head.




A few months later, on Saint Jean the Baptist’s Eve
everyone in the village brings a log
or a bundle of sticks. Jeannette has a twig

for the bonfire lit every year near the Fairies’ Tree. 
Madame Agnes has told her that this ritual is actually 
a pagan salute to summer called Midsummer,

symbolising the passage of spring
with a bonfire that consumes the flowers. But 
Jeannette’s mother, Isabelle, believes

that the fire is a reminder of Hell for the sinful 
and the vain; she’s told her daughter to burn 
something precious to her, so Jeannette’s tied a fresh lily

to her twig.

The evening begins with the chiming of church bells
and the villagers, in their best dresses and tunics
walk cheerfully up the hill towards the primeval Tree.

Jeannette and the children sing:
                                              "This is Saint Jean’s night
                                                   The great occasion
                                              When lovers delight
                                                   And burn with passion
                                              The moon has risen."

Madame Agnes, despite her frail legs,
has climbed the hillock ahead of the others
instructing the young men and girls

to arrange the wood in a pyramid
that would last long and look prominent.
She whispers to Jeannette’s oldest brother, Joe

quietly so that the parish priest can’t hear: 
"You’ll see, dear boy, once the flames have risen
the fairy folk will come to dance beneath the Tree."




Jeannette is full of verve
running ahead of the other children
her singing is the loudest

noise after the ringing of the bells.
The thin girl hops like a stag
and her green eyes radiate

with anticipation. The elders choose her
to light the bonfire. She’s hoisted

on the shoulders of her uncle, Durand,
and Isabelle holds the torch that sets fire 
to her daughter’s twig. Jeannette brushes

the unruly black hair off her pink face
and throws the ignited flower
at the hay stacked beneath the tower of wood.

The villagers crack open the barrels of wine
and the priest begins playing his lyre. 
Margarette is holding the hands of a boy

called Collot and Joe has his eyes on a girl 
he hasn’t met before. Jeannette, having drunk
a cup of wine diluted with water,

is almost shouting at Madame Agnes:

                                       I wanna see her! And the fairies!
                            Where are they! You promised!

Jacques and Isabelle watch their children 
from a distance. She tells him: "Jacques
could we go to Toul, please. I wanna give alms

for our children, the harvest, oh-for everything! 
We’re so blessed-Can we Jacques?"

Jacques kisses her and empties another goblet 
into his mouth before saying: "Sure, sweetheart.



Now everyone’s smeared with the orange glow 
of the flames. Some are dancing in a circle around the pyre.
Some of them believe that this dance will prevent

illness and bad luck for the next year. As is 
and has been customary for centuries, 
the night ends with the younger couples jumping the subsiding blaze

holding hands to strengthen their romance. Jeannette 
who has no interest in boys yet
has decided to take part in this closing ritual alone

because Madame Agnes has told her that her father’s crops
will grow as tall as her leap tonight. She’s rolled up her skirt
above her calves and kneecaps, watching impatiently

as the others hesitate to brave the fire. She yells:

                                   – My turn! My turn!

and runs towards the flames. Her legs heave 
and fly over the bonfire. She swims through 
the smoky air. The flames brush the soles of her feet

but can’t hurt her. She makes it and joyously screams 
upon landing, but her excitement 
quickly dissipates. She’s exhausted; her large eyes close

and her body collapses into the grass. By the time 
Jacques has come to her side, she’s fast asleep. 
She’s so bloody adorable, he thinks

and lifts his snoring daughter carefully. He places her
on the bed at their house and himself returns
to have a few more drinks with the other farmers.



Jeannette’s tiny lips shiver in sleep
          and her cheeks tremble as she breathes
heavily; she dreams
                            of the villagers drinking and being merry
                                   a year of joy descends upon the Valley

                            her white sheep flying through the blue sky
                                   the crops weaving into crowns for her head

                            ghosts twist into the tubers of the Fairies’ Tree
                                   Archangel Michael and Saint Catherine get                                    married

                            a bouquet of daisies burns in the sacred fire
                                   the sun mixes with the soil and plants are                                    born

                            and far behind the Oak Forest

                                                   a flood 
                                                   of identical men 
                                                   wielding axes

                            cut down the trees and crush the farms

                            they’re thousands and their stampede rattles the                             Valley

                            they’re soldiers of the greatest army in the world

                            their faces are eyeless and their feet are hooves

                            they have black crosses tattooed on the                             forehead-



Jeannette wakes up
          next to her parents and brothers under the blanket.

They’re deep asleep
          and the girl’s shivering figure doesn’t wake them.

Outside, a few farmers
          strew the ashes of the fire over the vegetation
to banish bad omens. 

Jeanne-Marie has strong hands; dark hands tanned by the summer, 
pale hands like dead hands. Are they the hands of Donna Juana? 
Did they get their dusky cream colour 
sailing on pools of sensual pleasure? 

Have they dipped into moons, in ponds of serenity? 
Have they drunk heat from barbarous skies, calm upon enchanting knees? 
Have they rolled cigars, or traded in diamonds? 
Have they tossed golden flowers at the glowing feet of Madonnas? 

It is the black blood of belladonnas that blazes and sleeps in their palms. 
Hands which drive the diptera with which 
the auroral bluenesses buzz, towards the nectars? 
Hands which measure out poisons? 

Oh what Dream has stiffened them in pandiculations? 
Some extraordinary dream of the Asias, of Khenghavars or Zions? 
These hands have neither sold oranges 
nor become sunburnt at the feet of the gods: 
these hands have never washed the napkins of heavy babies without eyes. 

These are not the hands of a tart, 
nor of working women with round foreheads burnt 
by a sun which is drunk with the smell of tar, 
in woods that sink of factories. 

These are benders of backbones; hands that never work harm; 
more inevitable than machines, stronger than carthorses! 
Stirring like furnaces, shaking off all their chills of fear, 
their flesh sings Marseillaises, and never Eleisons! 

They could grasp your necks, O evil women; 
they could pulverize your hands, noblewomen; 
your infamous hands full of white and of carmine. 
The splendour of these hands of love turns the heads of the lambs! 

On their spicy fingers the great sun sets a ruby! 
A dark stain of the common people makes then brown 
like the nipples of the women of yesterday, 
but it is the backs of these Hands which every 
proud Rebel desires to kiss! Marvelous, 
they have paled in the great sunshine full of love of the cause 
on the bronze casing of machine-guns throughout insurgent Paris! 

Ah, sometimes, O blessed Hands, at your wrists, 
Hands where our never-sobered lips tremble, 
cries out a chain of bright links! 
And there's a strange and sudden 

Start in our beings when, 
sometimes, they try, angelic Hands, 
to make your sunburn fade away 
by making your fingers bleed

Jenn is the one that i always will love
through thick and thin we been through it all
i still love her like i always will

her eyes are brown and beautiful
when i look into them i see us and the future we have
i see us standing with a baby with her eyes

when i feel her hair i feel our baby's hair as soft as it's mothers

our future together is getting bright once more
i will tell you something today that will ashtonish you 
if you don't already know

I love you jenn until the day i die
I wanna be with you now more then ever and again


Some men affect a liking
For the prim in face and mind,
And some prefer the striking
And the loud in womankind;
Wee Madge is wooed of many,
And buxom Kate, as well,
And Jennie--charming Jennie--
Ah, Jennie doesn't tell!

What eyes so bright as Daisy's,
And who as Maud so fair?
Who does not sing the praises
Of Lucy's golden hair?
There's Sophie--she is witty,
A very sprite is Nell,
And Susie's, oh, so pretty--
But Jennie doesn't tell!

And now for my confession:
Of all the virtues rare,
I argue that discretion
Doth most beseem the fair.
And though I hear the many
Extol each other belle,
I--I pronounce for Jennie,
For Jennie doesn't tell

SWEET Jennifer came calling me 
Along the shining beach. 
'There's green upon the hawthorn tree 
There's bloom upon the peach. 
O, April's found the upland larch, 
The hazel in the hollow,'– 
But louder was the snare-drum with it's 'March, march, march !' 
And clearer called the bugle, 'Will you follow ?' 


Young Jennifer came seeking me 
With love upon her lips. 
'O, all kind angels keep the sea 
And fortune guard the ships. 
The Autumn winds have rent the larch, 
The south has won the swallow,'– 
But clearer beat the snare-drum with it's 'March, march, march !' 
And sweeter sang the bugle, 'Will you follow .


'Lazy laughing languid Jenny,
Fond of a kiss and fond of a guinea,
Whose head upon my knee to-night
Rests for a while, as if grown light
With all our dances and the sound
To which the wild tunes spun you round:
Of kisses which the blush between
Could hardly make much daintier;
Whose eyes are as blue skies, whose hair
Is countless gold incomparable:
Fresh flower, scarce touched with signs that tell
Of Love's exuberant hotbed:—Nay,
Poor flower left torn since yesterday
Until to-morrow leave you bare;
Poor handful of bright spring-water
Flung in the whirlpool's shrieking face;
Poor shameful Jenny, full of grace
Thus with your head upon my knee;—
Whose person or whose purse may be
The lodestar of your reverie?
This room of yours, my Jenny, looks
A change from mine so full of books,
Whose serried ranks hold fast, forsooth,
So many captive hours of youth,—
The hours they thieve from day and night
To make one's cherished work come right,
And leave it wrong for all their theft,
Even as to-night my work was left:
Until I vowed that since my brain
And eyes of dancing seemed so fain,
My feet should have some dancing too:—
And thus it was I met with you.
Well, I suppose 'twas hard to part,
For here I am. And now, sweetheart,
You seem too tired to get to bed.
It was a careless life I led
When rooms like this were scarce so strange
Not long ago. What breeds the change,—
The many aims or the few years?
Because to-night it all appears
Something I do not know again.
The cloud's not danced out of my brain—
The cloud that made it turn and swim
While hour by hour the books grew dim.
Why, Jenny, as I watch you there,—
For all your wealth of loosened hair,
Your silk ungirdled and unlac'd
And warm sweets open to the waist,
All golden in the lamplight's gleam,—
You know not what a book you seem,
Half-read by lightning in a dream!
How should you know, my Jenny? Nay,
And I should be ashamed to say:—
Poor beauty, so well worth a kiss!
But while my thought runs on like this
With wasteful whims more than enough,
I wonder what you're thinking of.
If of myself you think at all,
What is the thought?—conjectural
On sorry matters best unsolved?—
Or inly is each grace revolved
To fit me with a lure?—or (sad
To think!) perhaps you're merely glad
That I'm not drunk or ruffianly
And let you rest upon my knee.
For sometimes, were the truth confess'd,
You're thankful for a little rest,—
Glad from the crush to rest within,
From the heart-sickness and the din
Where envy's voice at virtue's pitch
Mocks you because your gown is rich;
Whose ill-clad grace and toil-worn look
Proclaim the strength that keeps her weak,
And other nights than yours bespeak;
And from the wise unchildish elf,
To schoolmate lesser than himself
Pointing you out, what thing you are:—
Yes, from the daily jeer and jar,
From shame and shame's outbraving too,
Is rest not sometimes sweet to you?—
But most from the hatefulness of man,
Who spares not to end what he began,
Whose acts are ill and his speech ill,
Who, having used you at his will,
Thrusts you aside, as when I dine
I serve the dishes and the wine.
Well, handsome Jenny mine, sit up:
I've filled our glasses, let us sup,
And do not let me think of you,
Lest shame of yours suffice for two.
What, still so tired? Well, well then, keep
Your head there, so you do not sleep;
But that the weariness may pass
And leave you merry, take this glass.
Ah! lazy lily hand, more bless'd
If ne'er in rings it had been dress'd
Nor ever by a glove conceal'd!
Behold the lilies of the field,
They toil not neither do they spin;
(So doth the ancient text begin,—
Not of such rest as one of these
Can share.) Another rest and ease
Along each summer-sated path
From its new lord the garden hath,
Than that whose spring in blessings ran
Which praised the bounteous husbandman,
Ere yet, in days of hankering breath,
The lilies sickened unto death.
What, Jenny, are your lilies dead?
Aye, and the snow-white leaves are spread
Like winter on the garden-bed.
But you had roses left in May,—
They were not gone too. Jenny, nay,
But must your roses die, and those
Their purfled buds that should unclose?
Even so; the leaves are curled apart,
Still red as from the broken heart,
And here's the naked stem of thorns.
Nay, nay, mere words. Here nothing warns
As yet of winter. Sickness here
Or want alone could waken fear,—
Nothing but passion wrings a tear.
Except when there may rise unsought
Haply at times a passing thought
Of the old days which seem to be
Much older than any history
That is written in any book;
When she would lie in fields and look
Along the ground through the blown grass
And wonder where the city was,
Far out of sight, whose broil and bale
They told her then for a child's tale.
Jenny, you know the city now.
A child can tell the tale there, how
Some things which are not yet enroll'd
In market-lists are bought and sold
Even till the early Sunday light,
When Saturday night is market-night
Everywhere, be it dry or wet,
And market-night in the Haymarket.
Our learned London children know,
Poor Jenny, all your pride and woe;
Have seen your lifted silken skirt
Advertise dainties through the dirt;
On virtue; and have learned your look
When, wealth and health slipped past, you stare
Along the streets alone, and there,
Round the long park, across the bridge,
The cold lamps at the pavement's edge
Wind on together and apart,
A fiery serpent for your heart.
Let the thoughts pass, an empty cloud!
Suppose I were to think aloud,—
What if to her all this were said?
Why, as a volume seldom read
Being opened halfway shuts again,
So might the pages of her brain
Be parted at such words, and thence
Close back upon the dusty sense.
For is there hue or shape defin'd
In Jenny's desecrated mind,
Where all contagious currents meet,
A Lethe of the middle street?
Nay, it reflects not any face,
Nor sound is in its sluggish pace,
But as they coil those eddies clot,
And night and day remember not.
Why, Jenny, you're asleep at last!—
Asleep, poor Jenny, hard and fast,—
So young and soft and tired; so fair,
With chin thus nestled in your hair,
Mouth quiet, eyelids almost blue
As if some sky of dreams shone through!
Just as another woman sleeps!
Enough to throw one's thoughts in heaps
Of doubt and horror,—what to say
Or think,—this awful secret sway,
The potter's power over the clay!
Of the same lump (it has been said)
For honour and dishonour made,
Two sister vessels. Here is one.
My cousin Nell is fond of fun,
And fond of dress, and change, and praise,
So mere a woman in her ways:
And if her sweet eyes rich in youth
Are like her lips that tell the truth,
My cousin Nell is fond of love.
And she's the girl I'm proudest of.
Who does not prize her, guard her well?
The love of change, in cousin Nell,
Shall find the best and hold it dear:
The unconquered mirth turn quieter
Not through her own, through others' woe:
The conscious pride of beauty glow
Beside another's pride in her,
One little part of all they share.
For Love himself shall ripen these
In a kind soil to just increase
Through years of fertilizing peace.
Of the same lump (as it is said)
For honour and dishonour made,
Two sister vessels. Here is one.
It makes a goblin of the sun.
So pure,—so fall'n! How dare to think
Of the first common kindred link?
Yet, Jenny, till the world shall burn
It seems that all things take their turn;
And who shall say but this fair tree
May need, in changes that may be,
Your children's children's charity?
Scorned then, no doubt, as you are scorn'd!
Shall no man hold his pride forewarn'd
Till in the end, the Day of Days,
At Judgment, one of his own race,
As frail and lost as you, shall rise,—
His daughter, with his mother's eyes?
How Jenny's clock ticks on the shelf!
Might not the dial scorn itself
That has such hours to register?
Yet as to me, even so to her
Are golden sun and silver moon,
In daily largesse of earth's boon,
Counted for life-coins to one tune.
And if, as blindfold fates are toss'd,
Through some one man this life be lost,
Shall soul not somehow pay for soul?
Fair shines the gilded aureole
In which our highest painters place
Some living woman's simple face.
And the stilled features thus descried
As Jenny's long throat droops aside,—
The shadows where the cheeks are thin,
And pure wide curve from ear to chin,—
With Raffael's, Leonardo's hand
To show them to men's souls, might stand,
Whole ages long, the whole world through,
What has man done here? How atone,
And for the body and soul which by
Man's pitiless doom must now comply
With lifelong hell, what lullaby
Of sweet forgetful second birth
Remains? All dark. No sign on earth
The many mansions of his house.
If but a woman's heart might see
Such erring heart unerringly
For once! But that can never be.
Like a rose shut in a book
In which pure women may not look,
For its base pages claim control
To crush the flower within the soul;
Where through each dead rose-leaf that clings,
Pale as transparent Psyche-wings,
To the vile text, are traced such things
As might make lady's cheek indeed
More than a living rose to read;
So nought save foolish foulness may
Watch with hard eyes the sure decay;
And so the life-blood of this rose,
Puddled with shameful knowledge, flows
Through leaves no chaste hand may unclose:
Yet still it keeps such faded show
Of when 'twas gathered long ago,
That the crushed petals' lovely grain,
The sweetness of the sanguine stain,
Seen of a woman's eyes, must make
Her pitiful heart, so prone to ache,
Love roses better for its sake:—
Only that this can never be:—
Even so unto her sex is she.
Yet, Jenny, looking long at you,
The woman almost fades from view.
A cipher of man's changeless sum
Of lust, past, present, and to come,
Is left. A riddle that one shrinks
To challenge from the scornful sphinx.
Like a toad within a stone
Seated while Time crumbles on;
Which sits there since the earth was curs'd
For Man's transgression at the first;
Which, living through all centuries,
Not once has seen the sun arise;
Whose life, to its cold circle charmed,
The earth's whole summers have not warmed;
Which always—whitherso the stone
Be flung—sits there, deaf, blind, alone;—
Aye, and shall not be driven out
Till that which shuts him round about
Break at the very Master's stroke,
And the dust thereof vanish as smoke,
And the seed of Man vanish as dust:—
Even so within this world is Lust.
Come, come, what use in thoughts like this?
Poor little Jenny, good to kiss,—
You'd not believe by what strange roads
Thought travels, when your beauty goads
A man to-night to think of toads!
Jenny, wake up
 Why, there's the dawn!
And there's an early waggon drawn
To market, and some sheep that jog
Bleating before a barking dog;
And the old streets come peering through
Another night that London knew;
And all as ghostlike as the lamps.
So on the wings of day decamps
My last night's frolic. Glooms begin
To shiver off as lights creep in
Past the gauze curtains half drawn-to,
And the lamp's doubled shade grows blue,—
Your lamp, my Jenny, kept alight,
Like a wise virgin's, all one night!
And in the alcove coolly spread
Glimmers with dawn your empty bed;
And yonder your fair face I see
Reflected lying on my knee,
Where teems with first foreshadowings
Your pier-glass scrawled with diamond rings:
And on your bosom all night worn
Yesterday's rose now droops forlorn,
But dies not yet this summer morn.
And now without, as if some word
Had called upon them that they heard,
The London sparrows far and nigh
Clamour together suddenly;
And Jenny's cage-bird grown awake
Here in their song his part must take,
Because here too the day doth break.
And somehow in myself the dawn
Among stirred clouds and veils withdrawn
Strikes greyly on her. Let her sleep.
But will it wake her if I heap
These cushions thus beneath her head
Where my knee was? No,—there's your bed,
My Jenny, while you dream. And there
I lay among your golden hair,
Perhaps the subject of your dreams,
These golden coins.
For still one deems
That Jenny's flattering sleep confers
New magic on the magic purse,—
Grim web, how clogged with shrivelled flies!
Between the threads fine fumes arise
And shape their pictures in the brain.
There roll no streets in glare and rain,
Nor flagrant man-swine whets his tusk;
But delicately sighs in musk
The homage of the dim boudoir;
Or like a palpitating star
Thrilled into song, the opera-night
Breathes faint in the quick pulse of light;
Or at the carriage-window shine
Rich wares for choice; or, free to dine,
Whirls through its hour of health (divine
For her) the concourse of the Park.
And though in the discounted dark
Her functions there and here are one,
Beneath the lamps and in the sun
There reigns at least the acknowledged belle
Apparelled beyond parallel.
Ah Jenny, yes, we know your dreams.
For even the Paphian Venus seems
A goddess o'er the realms of love,
When silver-shrined in shadowy grove:
Aye, or let offerings nicely plac'd
But hide Priapus to the waist,
And whoso looks on him shall see
An eligible deity.
Why, Jenny, waking here alone
May help you to remember one,
Though all the memory's long outworn
Of many a double-pillowed morn.
I think I see you when you wake,
And rub your eyes for me, and shake
My gold, in rising, from your hair,
A Danae for a moment there.
Jenny, my love rang true! for still
Love at first sight is vague, until
That tinkling makes him audible.
And must I mock you to the last,
Ashamed of my own shame,—aghast
Because some thoughts not born amiss
Rose at a poor fair face like this?
Well, of such thoughts so much I know:
In my life, as in hers, they show,
By a far gleam which I may near,
A dark path I can strive to clear.
Only one kiss. Good-bye, my dear. 


Today Jeny is having a bouncy birthday blast
At the table will be included a distinctly canine cast
Denver, a delightful, dapper dynamo of origin half chihuahua
And Alfie, his maltese mate who helps him create brouhaha

Jeny's creative panache will ensure they look their best
With matching cape and peaked cap is how they'll both be dressed
They'll partake in the candle blowing ritual and munch on a birthday slice
Although Denver will think Alfie's piece is the one that tastes more nice

Alfie will commence the feisty fiesta with a piercing, strident yap
Giving a clear, sharp signal for when everyone should clap
Although in truth he could be barking because he thought he heard a cat
With Alfie it's not always clear as to what he's barking at

Denver will present Jeny with a chewed up, spat up ball
And Jeny will graciously roll it smoothly down the hall
She loves her darling duo, and they love in reciprocation
They're both honoured to be part of Jeny's special birthday celebration


Though Jericho pleasantly stood,
And looked like a promising soil;
The harvest produced little food,
To answer the husbandman's toil.
The water some property had,
Which poisonous proved to the ground;
The springs were corrupted and bad,
The streams spread a barrenness round. 

But soon by the cruse and the salt,
Prepared by Elisha's command,
The water was cured of its fault,
And plenty enriched the land:
An emblem sure this of the grace
On fruitless dead sinners bestowed;
For man is in Jericho's case,

How noble a creature he seems!
What knowledge, invention and skill!
How large and extensive his schemes!
How much can he do if he will!
His zeal to be learned and wise,
Will yield to no limits or bars;
He measures the earth and the skies,
And numbers and marshals the stars. 

Yet still he is barren of good;
In vain are his talents and art;
For sin has infected his blood,
And poisoned the streams of his heart:
Though cockatrice eggs he can hatch,
Or, spider-like, cobwebs can weave;
'Tis madness to labor and watch
For what will destroy or deceive. 

But grace, like the salt in the cruse,
When cast in the spring of the soul;
A wonderful change will produce,
Diffusing new life through the whole:
The wilderness blooms like a rose,
The heart which was vile and abhorred;
Now fruitful and beautiful grows,

Each day brings its toad, each night its dragon.
Der heilige Hieronymus--his lion is at the zoo--
Listens, listens. All the long, soft, summer day
Dreams affright his couch, the deep boils like a pot.
As the sun sets, the last patient rises,
Says to him, Father, trembles, turns away.

Often, to the lion, the saint said, Son.
To the man the saint says--but the man is gone.
Under a plaque of Gradiva, at gloaming.
The old man boils an egg. When he has eaten
He listens a while. The patients have not stopped.
At midnight, he lies down where his patients lay.

All night the old man whispers to the night.
It listens evenly. The great armored paws
Of its forelegs put together in reflection.
It thinks: Where Ego was, there Id shall be.
The world wrestles with it and is changed into it
And after a long time changes it. The dragon

Listens as the old man says, at dawn: I see
--There is an old man, naked in a desert, by a cliff.
He has set out his books, his hat, his ink, his shears
Among scorpions, toads, the wild beasts of the desert.
I lie beside him--I am a lion.
He kneels listening. He holds in his left hand

The stone with which he beats his breat, and holds
In his right hand, the pen with which he puts
Into his book, the words of the angel:
The angel up into whose face he looks.
But the angel does not speak. He looks into the face
Of the night, and the night says--but the night is gone.

He has slept. . . . At morning, when man's flesh is young
And man's soul thankful for it knows not what,
The air is washed, and smells of boiling coffee,
And the sun lights it. The old man walks placidly
To the grocer's; walks on, under leaves, in light,
To a lynx, a leopard--he has come;

The man holds out a lump of liver to the lion,
And the lion licks the man's hand with his tongue. 

And did those feet in ancient time
Walk upon England's mountains green?
On England's pleasant pastures seen? 

And did the Countenance Divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among these dark Satanic mills? 

Bring me my bow of burning gold:
Bring me my arrows of desire:
Bring me my spear: O clouds unfold!
Bring me my chariot of fire. 

I will not cease from mental fight,
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand
Till we have built Jerusalem
In England's green and pleasant land. 

I wept until my tears were dry
I prayed until the candles flickered
I knelt until the floor creaked
Oh Jerusalem, the fragrance of prophets
The shortest path between earth and sky
Oh Jerusalem, the citadel of laws
A beautiful child with fingers charred
and downcast eyes
You are the shady oasis passed by the Prophet
Your streets are melancholy
Your minarets are mourning
You, the young maiden dressed in black
Who rings the bells in the Nativity
On Saturday morning?
Who brings toys for the children
Oh Jerusalem, the city of sorrow
A big tear wandering in the eye
Who will halt the aggression
On you, the pearl of religions?
Who will wash your bloody walls?
Who will safeguard the Bible?
Who will rescue the Quran?
Who will save man?
Oh Jerusalem my town
Oh Jerusalem my love
Tomorrow the lemon trees will blossom
And the olive trees will rejoice
Your eyes will dance
The migrant pigeons will return
To your sacred roofs
And your children will play again
And fathers and sons will meet
On your rosy hills
My town
The town of peace and olives. 

AT last, at last the Crescent
Falls back before the Cross.
Great spirits, incandescent
With longing and with loss,
Gleam from the clouds, crusaders
Who knew no requiem
While Saladin's invaders
Possessed Jerusalem.
King David harps for Zion
A glad, celestial psalm;
The face of the young lion
Is toward the sacred palm;
New Europe's noblest nation
Has won the diadem
Of him who brings salvation
To thee, Jerusalem.
Isaiah, Hosea, Amos,
Who cried against thy sin,
Whose vision saw thy famous
Bright bulwarks beaten in
And made a cup of trembling,
On all the winds assembling
Comfort Jerusalem.
Whose Gentile armies free
Thy walls, not battle-cloven,
But won with jubilee;
As when thy people, pressing,
Would touch His garment's hem,
Enters with love and blessing
Thy gates, Jerusalem.
Arise and shine, O City,
The joy of all the earth!
Be thou to all the nations
A light, ay, even to them
Who wrought thy tribulations,
Holy Jerusalem!"Let’s be the same wound if we must bleed.
         Let’s fight side by side, even if the enemy 
         is ourselves: I am yours, you are mine."


I’m not interested in
who suffered the most.
I’m interested in
people getting over it.

Once when my father was a boy
a stone hit him on the head.
Hair would never grow there.
Our fingers found the tender spot
and its riddle: the boy who has fallen
stands up. A bucket of pears
in his mother’s doorway welcomes him home.
The pears are not crying.
Later his friend who threw the stone
says he was aiming at a bird.
And my father starts growing wings.

Each carries a tender spot:
something our lives forgot to give us.
A man builds a house and says,
"I am native now."
A woman speaks to a tree in place
of her son. And olives come.
A child’s poem says,
"I don’t like wars,
they end up with monuments."
He’s painting a bird with wings
wide enough to cover two roofs at once.

Why are we so monumentally slow?
Soldiers stalk a pharmacy:
big guns, little pills.
If you tilt your head just slightly
it’s ridiculous.

There’s a place in my brain
where hate won’t grow.
I touch its riddle: wind, and seeds.
Something pokes us as we sleep.




England! awake! awake! awake! 
         Jerusalem thy Sister calls!
     Why wilt thou sleep the sleep of death
         And close her from thy ancient walls?

     Thy hills and valleys felt her feet
         Gently upon their bosoms move:
     Thy gates beheld sweet Zion's ways:
         Then was a time of joy and love.

     And now the time returns again:
       Our souls exult, and London's towers
       In England's green and pleasant bowers. 


I see the Four-fold Man, The Humanity in deadly sleep 
     And its fallen Emanation, the Spectre and its cruel Shadow.
     I see the Past, Present and Future existing all at once
     Before me. O Divine Spirit, sustain me on thy wings,
     That I may awake Albion from his long and cold repose;
     For Bacon and Newton, sheath'd in dismal steel, their terrors hang
     Like iron scourges over Albion: reasonings like vast serpents
     Infold around my limbs, bruising my minute articulations.

     I turn my eyes to the schools and universities of Europe
   And there behold the Loom of Locke, whose Woof rages dire,
   Wash'd by the Water-wheels of Newton: black the cloth
   In heavy wreaths folds over every nation: cruel works
   Of many Wheels I view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic
   Moving by compulsion each other, not as those in Eden, which,
   Wheel within wheel, in freedom revolve in harmony and peace. 


When I remark her golden hair
 Swoon on her glorious shoulders,
I marvel not that sight so rare
 Doth ravish all beholders;
For summon hence all pretty girls
 Renowned for beauteous tresses,
And you shall find among their curls

 And full of sweet revealings--
They seem to look you through and through
 And read your inmost feelings;
Nor black emits such ardent fires,
 Nor brown such truth expresses--
Admit it, all ye gallant squires--


Her voice (like liquid beams that roll
   From moonland to the river)
Steals subtly to the raptured soul,
   Therein to lie and quiver;
Or falls upon the grateful ear
   With chaste and warm caresses--
Ah, all concede the truth (who hear):

Of other charms she hath such store
   All rivalry excelling,
Though I used adjectives galore,
   They'd fail me in the telling;
But now discretion stays my hand--
   Adieu, eyes, voice, and tresses.
Of all the husbands in the land


Into her mother’s bedroom to wash the ballooning body.   
"My mother is jelly-hearted and she has a brain of jelly:   
Sweet, quiver-soft, irrelevant. Not essential.
Only a habit would cry if she should die.
A pleasant sort of fool without the least iron. . . .
Are you better, mother, do you think it will come today?"   
Reviewed her. Young, and so thin, and so straight.   
So straight! as if nothing could ever bend her.
But poor men would bend her, and doing things with poor men,
Being much in bed, and babies would bend her over,
And the rest of things in life that were for poor women,   
Coming to them grinning and pretty with intent to bend and to kill.
Comparisons shattered her heart, ate at her bulwarks:
The shabby and the bright: she, almost hating her daughter,   
And her way will be black, and jerkier even than mine.   
Mine, in fact, because I was lovely, had flowers
Tucked in the jerks, flowers were here and there. . . ."
She revived for the moment settled and dried-up triumphs,
Forced perfume into old petals, pulled up the droop,   
Refueled
Triumphant long-exhaled breaths.
Her exquisite yellow youth . . . 

Father calls me William, sister calls me Will,
Mother calls me Willie, but the fellers call me Bill!
Mighty glad I ain't a girl - ruther be a boy,
Without them sashes, curls, an' things that's worn by Fauntleroy!
Love to chawnk green apples an' go swimmin' in the lake -
Hate to take the castor-ile they give for bellyache!
'Most all the time, the whole year round, there ain't no flies on me,

Got a yeller dog named Sport, sick him on the cat;
First thing she knows she doesn't know where she is at!
Got a clipper sled, an' when us kids goes out to slide,
'Long comes the grocery cart, an' we all hook a ride!
But sometimes when the grocery man is worrited an' cross,
He reaches at us with his whip, an' larrups up his hoss,
An' then I laff an' holler, "Oh, ye never teched me!"

Gran'ma says she hopes that when I git to be a man,
I'll be a missionarer like her oldest brother, Dan,
As was et up by the cannibuls that lives in Ceylon's Isle,
Where every prospeck pleases, an' only man is vile!
But gran'ma she has never been to see a Wild West show,
Nor read the Life of Daniel Boone, or else I guess she'd know
That Buff'lo Bill an' cow-boys is good enough for me!

And then old Sport he hangs around, so solemn-like an' still,
His eyes they seem a-sayin': "What's the matter, little Bill?"
The old cat sneaks down off her perch an' wonders what's become
Of them two enemies of hern that used to make things hum!
But I am so perlite an' 'tend so earnestly to biz,
That mother says to father: "How improved our Willie is!"
But father, havin' been a boy hisself, suspicions me

Was made, they say, for proper kids an' not for naughty boys;
So wash yer face an' bresh yer hair, an' mind yer p's and q's,
An' don't bust out yer pantaloons, and don't wear out yer shoes;
Say "Yessum" to the ladies, an' "Yessur" to the men,
An' when they's company, don't pass yer plate for pie again;
But, thinkin' of the things yer'd like to see upon that tree,

I see your face in the desert
After forty days
Hungry.
But your eyes are clear, 
Your sight is keen.

The Dance begins, 
and you have chosen me
to be your partner, 
Clumsy feet.

I will go to the desert
and prepare.
I've always wanted to dance. 

of our life's wild, restless sea,
day by day his clear voice soundeth,

as, of old, Saint Andrew heart it
by the Galilean lake,
turned from home and toil and kindred,
leaving all for his dear sake.

of the vain world's golden store; 
from each idol that would keep us,

In our joys and in our sorrows,
days of toil and hours of ease,
still he calls, in cares and pleasures,

Savior, may we hear thy call,
give our hearts to thine obedience,
serve and love thee best of all. 

Though last nights prayer
Brought on deep conversation
I found myself 
In a sleep aspiration

Centuries ago in Bethany
Where Lazarus was raised
Six days before Passover
He came to be praised

They hosted a supper
Martha served
I couldn’t help but to observe

Oh, I was a sinner
My life benighted
And to this supper
I was uninvited

I couldn’t help but step inside
And bring my ointment jar
I told him with bright eyes

So, then and there I fell 
Fell beside him on my knees
And let the ointment
Wash his soft, smooth feet

I was so gentle
As I watched dirt smear
I washed them so merciful
That I began to bathe them in tears

My sins of scarlet turned to snow
And then he caught my eye
For I used my long hair
To pat his feet dry

I kissed them on their tops
And let him get back to dining
But no one could over look
Those precious feet shining

And when we all get to heaven
Do not look for me in the street
For if you want to find me


 

To lift up the whole creation
Into the benevolent presence of 
Truth and only Truth 

And convinced
It is my consolation
And I live joyously
Singing my own psalms
Coined in prayer
And murmur it day and night
And I smile a beautiful smile.

This faith makes me happy
and it is true
I am happy always.


A blank look on her face
What happen she can't believe
Oh how she wishes she could escape
How she could just leave

Panicing she is
How will she move on
She could pretend like nothings happen
Pretend that all the bads gone

A pain is in her chest
A heartbreaking she feels
She's been hurt and left alone
She realizes that this was part of the deal

No one said it would be easy
Now she knows
But she's forgetting the one who can save her
Through all the highs and lows

Devestated are her emotions
Like she's lost all hope
and suddenly she knows how to cope


Fiscal Conservatism
Blatantly destroying
Social consciousness
While piously drawing

Parallels of righteousness


Jewelled offering bring I none,
Jade or pearl or precious stone,
Urn of crystal, bale of spice,
Unguent culled in Paradise,
Dye how deep of rainbow hue,
Dust of gold from Cambalu,
Ivory throne with sandal--wood
Inlaid all and scented ood,
Tent of silk whose tapestries
Tell of tears in ladies' eyes,
Heavenly tears, 'neath moon and star,
Hopes that were and joys that are,
Ambient ever in love's soul
Armed with might and near the goal.
Nought, alas, of these I bring.
Necklace, chain, nor nuptial ring.
No bold bridegroom I, to be
Nerved to dreams of chivalry,
Expedited at your word
Earth's whole realm to win by sword,
Daring all things, briar and brake,
Dole and Death for your dear sake,
Onward, upward, heavenward borne,
(O thou rose without a thorn!)
Rivalry in deeds to show,
Rodomont or Romeo.

Out, alas! Such love for us
Outlawed is and vanitous.
Time can touch it not nor cure.
'Tis an ill we must endure,
Howsoever long our days,
Howsoever rich in praise.
Even in Heaven we may not win
Ear for this too sweet a sin,
And no angel voice shall say,
Ask it, souls, and have your way.''
Be consoled then if I make
But this rhyme for birthday's sake,
Leaving love gifts all aside
Light to him shall call you bride,
Unacknowledged and untold,
Useless as Utopian gold.
Nonsense rhymes! Ah me, such sense
Nesting bird to nestling lends,
Trills of pale parental hue
Tragic only because true. 


If I should see your eyes again,
 I know how far their look would go --
Back to a morning in the park
 With sapphire shadows on the snow.

Or back to oak trees in the spring
 When you unloosed my hair and kissed
The head that lay against your knees
 In the leaf shadow's amethyst.

And still another shining place
 We would remember -- how the dun
Wild mountain held us on its crest
 One diamond morning white with sun.

But I will turn my eyes from you
 As women turn to put away
The jewels they have worn at night
 And cannot wear in sober day.




My harp is on the willow-tree,
Else would I sing, O love, to thee
   A song of long-ago--
Perchance the song that Miriam sung
Ere yet Judea's heart was wrung
   By centuries of woe.

I ate my crust in tears to-day,
As scourged I went upon my way--
   And yet my darling smiled;
Ay, beating at my breast, he laughed--
My anguish curdled not the draught--
   'T was sweet with love, my child!

The shadow of the centuries lies
Deep in thy dark and mournful eyes--
   But, hush! and close them now;
And in the dreams that thou shalt dream
The light of other days shall seem
   To glorify thy brow!

Our harp is on the willow-tree--
I have no song to sing to thee,
   As shadows round us roll;
But, hush and sleep, and thou shalt hear
   Judea's fainting soul


Her mother shed a tear or two but wasn't really
crying. It was the thing to do, so she did it
enjoying every moment. The bride laughed when I
sympathized, and said don't be silly.

Her brothrs had a shoe of mine and made me pay
to get it back. The game delighted all the neighbours'
children, who never stopped staring at me, the reluctant
bridegroom of the day.

There was no dowry because they knew I was 'modern'
and claimed to be modern too. Her father asked me how
much jewellery I expected him to give away with his daughter.
When I said I did't know, he laughed it off.

There was no brass band outside the synagogue
but I remember a chanting procession or two, some rituals,
lots of skull-caps, felt hats, decorated shawls
and grape juice from a common glass for bride and
bridegroom.

I remember the breaking of the glass and the congregation
clapping which signified that we were well and truly married
according to the Mosaic Law.

Well that's about all. I don't think there was much
that struck me as solemn or beautiful. Mostly, we were
amused, and so were the others. Who knows how much belief
we had? 

Even the most orthodox it was said ate beef because it
was cheaper, and some even risked their souls by
relishing pork.
The Sabbath was for betting and swearing and drinking.

Nothing extravagant, mind you, all in a low key
and very decently kept in check. My father used to say,
these orthodox chaps certainly know how to draw the line
in their own crude way. He himself had drifted into the liberal
creed but without much conviction, taking us all with him.
My mother was very proud of being 'progressive'.

Anyway as I was saying, there was that clapping and later
we went to the photographic studio of Lobo and Fernandes,
world-famous specialists in wedding portraits. Still later,
we lay on a floor-matress in the kitchen of my wife's
family apartment and though it was part midnight she
kept saying let's do it darling let's do it darling
so we did it.

More than ten years passed before she told me that
she remembered being very disappointed. Is that all
there is to it? She had wondered. Back from London
eighteen months earlier, I was horribly out of practice.

During our first serious marriage quarrel she said Why did
you take my virginity from me? I would gladly have
returned it, but not one of the books I had read
instructed me how. 

We forget where we came from. Our Jewish
names from the Exile give us away,
bring back the memory of flower and fruit, medieval cities,
metals, knights who turned to stone, roses,
spices whose scent drifted away, precious stones, lots of red,
handicrafts long gone from the world
(the hands are gone too).

Circumcision does it to us,
as in the Bible story of Shechem and the sons of Jacob,
so that we go on hurting all our lives.

What are we doing, coming back here with this pain?
Our longings were drained together with the swamps,
the desert blooms for us, and our children are beautiful.
Even the wrecks of ships that sank on the way
reached this shore,
even winds did. Not all the sails.

What are we doing
in this dark land with its
yellow shadows that pierce the eyes?
(Every now and then someone says, even after forty
or fifty years: 'The sun is killing me.')

What are we doing with these souls of mist, with these names,
with our eyes of forests, with our beautiful children,
with our quick blood?

Spilled blood is not the roots of trees
but it's the closest thing to roots
we have. 

Unveiled that tragic day
Priestess of Astarte
Jezebel modern day
With a grave role to play

Evil scheming, her way
Happiness lures her prey
Pure irony I say
Island - town names convey

She stood awestruck that day
Gave no communique
Damage: she did survey
‘Village' god: disarray

Imagine yourself at age  
And you the son of a President 
Of the United States of America. 

Would you have written this hymn of hate, 
About the country your father served in war, 
And the country he died for in Dallas? 

Does this say what a Democrat is? 
Before he could further ruin this country 

This poem of his was written 
To be sung to the tune of 
"America the Beautiful"

"Oh lovely land of racial lies, 
Of crooked ways to fame, 
From Kent State to Sharon Tate 
We’re proud to bear thy name. 

From atom bombs to nuclear arms be proud of U. 

S. 

A. 
And though you’re bad, we love you mad 
You taught us right and wrong 



The script was well-crafted, 
The main actors had rehearsed well
and smaller actors like me were expected
to just be around, to smile
and be politically correct.  .
The top guns finally arrived
and the curtains went up
The atmosphere became very tense
and we all shook hands and smiled nervously.
The much-awaited annual meeting began at last. 
The main speaker started his presentation, 
A few questions were raised, 
Answers were given to some, 
and excuses for others.
The farce finally ended
with plans and new projections.
The annual meeting ended at last
and the curtains came down
The main actors walked out
and got into their luxury cars and departed
while smaller actors like me 
trudged on the dusty road
towards the bus stop. 

Who ran away from his Nurse and was eaten by a Lion

There was a Boy whose name was Jim;
His Friends were very good to him.
They gave him Tea, and Cakes, and Jam,
And slices of delicious Ham,
And Chocolate with pink inside
And little Tricycles to ride,
And read him Stories through and through,
And even took him to the Zoo--
But there it was the dreadful Fate
Befell him, which I now relate.

You know--or at least you ought to know,
For I have often told you so--
That Children never are allowed
To leave their Nurses in a Crowd;
Now this was Jim's especial Foible,
He ran away when he was able,
And on this inauspicious day
He slipped his hand and ran away!

He hadn't gone a yard when--Bang!
With open Jaws, a lion sprang,
And hungrily began to eat
The Boy: beginning at his feet.
Now, just imagine how it feels
When first your toes and then your heels,
And then by gradual degrees,
Your shins and ankles, calves and knees,
Are slowly eaten, bit by bit.
No wonder Jim detested it!
No wonder that he shouted Hi!''

The Honest Keeper heard his cry,
Though very fat he almost ran
To help the little gentleman.
Ponto!'' he ordered as he came
(For Ponto was the Lion's name),
Ponto!'' he cried, with angry Frown,
Let go, Sir! Down, Sir! Put it down!''
The Lion made a sudden stop,
He let the Dainty Morsel drop,
And slunk reluctant to his Cage,
Snarling with Disappointed Rage.
But when he bent him over Jim,
The Honest Keeper's Eyes were dim.
The Lion having reached his Head,
The Miserable Boy was dead!

When Nurse informed his Parents, they
Were more Concerned than I can say:--
His Mother, as She dried her eyes,
Said, Well--it gives me no surprise,
He would not do as he was told!''
His Father, who was self-controlled,
Bade all the children round attend
To James's miserable end,
And always keep a-hold of Nurse
For fear of finding something worse. 

If within the cruel Southland you have chanced to take a ride,
You the Jim Crow cars have noticed, how they crush a Negro's pride,
How he pays a first class passage and a second class receives,
Gets the worst accommodations ev'ry friend of truth believes.

'Tis the rule that all conductors, in the service of the train,
Practice gross discriminations on the Negro—such is plain—
If a drunkard is a white man, at his mercy Negroes are,
Legalized humiliation is the Negro Jim Crow car.

'Tis a license given white men, they may go just where they please,
In the white man's car or Negro's will they move with perfect ease,
If complaint is made by Negroes the conductor will go out
Till the whites are through carousing, then he shows himself about.

They will often raise a riot, butcher up the Negroes there,
Unmolested will they quarrel, use their pistols,rant and swear,
They will smoke among the ladies though offensive the cigar;
'Tis the place to drink their whiskey, in the Negro Jim Crow car.

If a Negro shows resistance to his treatment by a tough,
At some station he's arrested for the same, though not enough,
He is thrashed or lynched or tortured as will please the demon's rage,
Mobbed, of course, by 'unknown parties,' thus is closed the darkened page.

If a lunatic is carried, white or black, it is the same,
Or a criminal is taken to the prison-house in shame,
In the Negro car he's ushered with the sheriff at his side,
Out of deference for white men in their car he scorns to ride.

We despise a Negro's manhood, says the Southland, and expect,
All supremacy for white men—black men's rights we'll not protect,
This the Negro bears with patience for the nation bows to might,
Wrong has borne aloft its colors disregarding what is right.

How the teachings of the Bible can with such a system band;
Purest love that knows no evil can alone the story tell,
How to banish such abuses, how to treat a neighbor well. 

I'll tell you the story of Jimmy Jet--
And you know what I tell you is true.
He loved to watch his TV set
Almost as much as you.

He watched all day, he watched all night
Till he grew pale and lean,
From 'The Early Show' to 'The Late Show'
And all the shows in between.

He watched till his eyes were frozen wide,
And his bottom grew into his chair.
And his chin turned into a tuning dial,
And antennae grew out of his hair.

And his brains turned into TV tubes,
And his face to a TV screen.
And two knobs saying 'vert.' and 'horiz.'
Grew where his ears had been.

And he grew a plug that looked like a tail
So we plugged in little Jim.
And now instead of him watching TV 
We all sit around and watch him. 

Jingle Jingle my bell
Jingle Jingle my bell
Please reassure me all is well

The sun sets down
The night is young
So I sing a song
Waiting for the night crickets 
To sing along

Jingle Jingle my bell
Tell me now what I should sell

My soul to the sea
While the waves fight
In the darkness of the night

Jingle Jingle my bell
I am thirsty
Get me some water from the well

Sitting on the cliff
Watching the rift
Out at sea
White bubbles drowning and rising
I am glad that is not me

Jingle Jingle my bell
I am making some noise 
Hear me yell

Jingle Jingle my bell
I am so happy 
That you can tell

Why do I not give up? 
Just end it now.

She was my hope, 
She said she still loves me, 
But I just can't believe, 
That even with someone else, 
She could still love me. 

Why do I feel the need, 
To just end it now? 
Why do I keep living, 
This life full of pain? 

Just tighten the noose. 
Put the gun to your head. 
Takes the pills, and go to bed. 
Take the leap into the dark. 
Or go out and up in flames. 

Jisatsu (suicide) , what should I do

This word had Merlin said from of old:—
That out of the Oak Tree Shade 
In the day of France's direst dule, 
And where Domremy, by Burgundy, 
Sits crowned with its oakenshaw, 
The light of the day first saw.

Where spirits go, what man may know? 
Yet this may of man be said:—
That, when Time is o'er and all hath sufficed, 
From the ashes of Joan the Maid. 

She and the fire
fight adjectives. Their concreteness

deflects reification
by language. She simply is

a pronoun. It may signify
say, my wife (coming from me

'she' often does) or, yes
a medieval French woman, her being

so roughly abridged
by the pronoun, as brutally fed

to the fire. Regarding the fire
dazzling, heaving, devouring

won't do. It only suggests
a familiar occurrence: ouch

when flame touches skin. Indeed
flame doesn't suffice (rhymes with lame)

and a pyre, much more poetic,
based on the transcripts based on

wordy statements. So much
reliance on the makeshift engine

of abstraction, language. She
did, I think, end in fire, but hero

saint, witch, schizophrenic
won't do. Will numbers rectify

the flaws of alphabetical signs: to  Historians can't be certain

about either: no records
other than her reserved guess

on the first day of trial
apropos birth, and her famed death

also contested by theorists
of bad conspiracies. So I can't

force the ephemeral stuff
of her matter into a mould (a poem)

with description, facts
or even an attempted evocation. She

floats and evades
perhaps - if I may hazard a simile -

like her ashes, diffused
by an English guard over the Seine. 

Joanie Laurer, Steroids, Alcohol, Steroids, hermaphrodites, 
Johnny -excuse me-Joanie Laurer is on STEROIDS! 
Duh! 
Did anyone do a chromosome test on Joanie Laurer like they did on Caster Semenya? 
If you have so, do tell.
'Gabriela Targos, alleging that on April  Chyna - whose real name is Joanie Laurer - asked her to meet up at a motel.'
For I guess some sort of sexually based liaison, 
-was it lesbian or straight sex? 
'However, upon Targos' arrival, the wrestling pro and former 'Surreal Life' and 'Celebrity Rehab' star 'immediately snapped and began attacking her for no reason.'
I know that he-excuse me- she had posed for Playboy in the buff, 
Amazing what plastic surgery had done to her, 
Not to mention the air-brushing that was involved, 
One look at him/her nude, 
Well, quite frankly I had enough.
Joanie Laurer, Steroids, Alcohol, Steroids, hermaphrodites, 
Was Chyna's plastic surgery done in China? 
Was his/her steroids manufactured in Beijing? 
By the same Chinese companies that put lead in our childrens toys? 
And caused a lot parental strife? 
Joanie/(Johnny)  looks like she had been born with both parts of little girls and little boys. 
'During the incident, TMZ reports that Chyna, allegedly punched Targos, beat her with a wire hanger, dragged her by her hair and threatened her life.'

' Chyna shot to fame in the late ' during her time with the WWE, where she was known as 'The Ninth Wonder of the World' because of her massive frame and muscles. Since she was so much larger than all of the other female wrestlers in the company, Chyna would often face off with men.'


Because, she is partly a man.

Commit to memory, that sacrosanct verse.
Job pens in his book, concise and quite clearly, 
Spirit filled words, so succinct and so terse.

"Receive, I pray thee, the law from His mouth", 

Now misquoting His Word, we need never fear, 
Commit it to memory; Job’s message is clear, 
So listen to Job; wise, humble and smart

"And lay up His words in thine heart"



Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife
           He would have written sonnets all his life?
                          DON JUAN, III, "Where do you see yourself five years from now?"
the eldest male member (or is "male member"
a redundancy?) of the committee
asked me. "Not here," I thought. A good thing I
speak fluent Fog. I craved that job like some
unappeasable, taunting woman.
What did Byron's friend Hobhouse say after
the wedding? "I felt as if I had buried
a friend

" Each day I had that job I felt
the slack leash at my throat and thought what was
its other trick. Better to scorn the job than ask
what I had ever seen in it or think
what pious muck I'd ladled over
the committee. If they believed me, they
deserved me. As luck would have it, the job
lasted me almost but not quite five years.



It’s s London
& highwaymen are notorious

for fixing up notices
on doors of rich folk’s houses

forbidding them
(on pain of death)    

to go out
without

at least
guineas & a gold watch

upon their soon to be
held up person.

Anything less & they get it! 
Got it? 

It’s a hard living
and no respectable highway man

for anything less. 

Why weep ye by the tide, ladie? 
Why weep ye by the tide? 
I'll wed ye to my youngest son, 
And ye sall be his bride: 
And ye sall be his bride, ladie,

And dry that cheek so pale; 
Young Frank is chief of Errington, 
And lord of Langley-dale; 
His step is first in peaceful ha' 
His sword in battle keen"-- 
But aye she loot the tears down fa' 
For Jock of Hazeldean.

"A chain of gold you sall not lack, 
Nor braid to bind your hair; 
Nor mettled hound, nor managed hawk, 
Nor palfrey fresh and fair; 
And you, the foremost o' them a', 
But aye she loot the tears down fa' 
For Jock of Hazeldean.

The kirk was deck'd at morning-tide, 
The tapers glimmer'd fair; 
The priest and bridegroom wait the bride, 
And dame and knight are there. 
They sought her baith by bower and ha'; 
The ladie was not seen! 
She's o'er the Border and awa' 
Wi' Jock of Hazeldean. 

We stood in columns 
like sheep before slaughter 
we ran, breathless 
We scrambled to kiss

hile he was an infant still. 
They stole from us the memory of the orange trees 
and the apricots and the mint 
and the candles in the mosques. 
In our hands they left 
a sardine can called Gaza 
and a dry bone called Jericho. 
They left us a body with no bones 
A hand with no fingers. 
After this secret romance in Oslo 
we came out barren. 
They gave us a homeland 
smaller than a single grain of wheat 
a homeland to swallow without water 
like aspirin pills. 
Oh, we dreamed of a green peace 
and a white crescent 
and a blue sea. 
Now we find ourselves 
on a dung-heap. 

The catch the apostles made that day
Symbolizes the end in many ways
They had taken to fishing all night
And caught nothing by the dawn's light
Who told them to make a cast once more
They cast the net out of the right side
One hundred and fifty three fish were caught
So their labor was not for naught

Seven apostles represent
The seven thousand who are sent
Being all of one accord
They're told to preach to the right
During the days of the night
The one hundred and fifty three
The number of days you see
For five months the locusts swarm
And His sons of oil inform


In the Darkness
Alone
Under the investigation
Of
One

Spying on me
From above
Standing
Truth to Power
Face to Face
With a mirror from my past
I trade my sanity
For the insanity of the moment

Holy water

Once and for all

and beyond them his ancestral home
full of clothes, costly furniture, silverware.
 
            away from him now.
 
Would Kantakuzinos show pity for him
if he went and fell at his feet? They say he's merciful,
very merciful. But those around him? And the army?—
Or should he fall down and plead before Lady Irini?
 
Fool that he was to get mixed up in Anna's party!
Has she ever done anything good, shown any humanity?
Even the Franks don't respect her any longer.
Her plans were ridiculous, all her plotting farcical.
While they were threatening everyone from Constantinople,
 
And he would have done it, and would have been happy now,
a great nobleman still, his position secure,
if the bishop hadn't dissuaded him at the last moment
with his imposing hieratic presence,
his information bogus from beginning to end,
his promises, and all his drivel. 

an endless fountain
an immortal drink pouring 
from heaven's brink 

wreathing a flowery band

a sleep full of sweet dreams


I spied John Mouldy in his celler,
Deep down twenty steps of stone;
In the dusk he sat a-smiling
Smiling there all alone.

He read no book, he snuffed no candle;
The rats ran in, the rats ran out,
And far and near, the drip of water
Went whisp'ring about.

The dusk was still, with dew a-falling,
I saw the Dog-star bleak and grim,
I saw a slim brown rat of Norway
Creep over him.

I spied John Mouldy in his celler,
Deep down twenty steps of stone;
In the dusk he sat a-smiling
Smiling there all alone. 

Coming and going these several seasons, 
Do stay out of the baobab tree, 
Follow where you please your kindred spirits

If indoors is not enough for you.
True, it leaks through the thatch
When floods brim the banks, 
And the bats and owls
Often tear in at night through the eaves, 
And at harmattan, the bamboo walls
Are ready tinder for the fire
That dries the fresh fish up on the rack.
Still, it’s been the healthy stock
To several fingers, to many more will be
Who reach to the sun.
No longer then bestride the threshold
But step in and stay
For good. We know the knife scars
Serrating down your back and front
Like beak of the sword-fish, 
And both your ears, notched
As a bondsman to this house, 
Are all relics of your first comings.
Then step in, step in and stay
For her body is tired, 
Tired, her milk going sour
Where many more mouths gladden the heart. 

I can look the sun in the face
 But the friends that I have lost
 I dare not look at any. Yet, I have held.
 Them all in my arms, shared with them
 The same bath and bed, often
 Devouring the same dish, drunk as soon
 On tea as on wine, at that time
 When but to think of an ill, made
 The cure prophet and physician
 Did not have. Yet, to look
 At them now I dare not, 
 Though I can look the sun in the face.
  The casualties are not only those who are dead.
 They are well out of  it.
 The casualties are not only those who are dead.
 Though they await burial by installment.
 The casualties are not only those who are lost
 Persons or property, hard as it is
 To grope  for a touch that some
 May not know is not there.
 The casualties are not only those led away by night.
 The cell is a cruel place, sometimes a haven.
 No where as absolute as the grave.
 The casualties are not only those who started
 A fire and now cannot put out. Thousands
 Are are burning that have no say in the matter.
 The casualties are not only those who are escaping.
 The shattered shall become prisoners in
 A fortress of falling walls
 
 The casualties are many, and a good member as well
 Outside the scenes of ravage and wreck; 
 They are the emissaries of rift, 
  So smug in smoke-rooms they haunt abroad, 
  They do not see the funeral piles
  At home eating up the forests.
  They are wandering minstrels who, beating on
  The drums of the human heart, draw the world
  Into a dance with rites it does not know.
 
The drums overwhelm the guns-
Caught in the clash of counter claims and charges
 When not in the niche others left, 
 We fall.
 All casualties of the war.
 Because we cannot hear each other speak.
 Because eyes have ceased the face from the crowd.
 Because whether we know or
 Do not the extent of wrongs on all sides, 
 We are characters now other than before
 The war began, the stay-at-home unsettled
 
 By taxes and rumours, the looters for office
 And wares, fearful everyday the owners may return.
 We are all casualties, 
 All sagging as are
 The cases celebrated for kwashiorkor.
 The unforseen camp-follower of not just our war.
 To-day I strayed in Charing Cross as wretched as could be
With thinking of my home and friends across the tumbling sea;
There was no water in my eyes, but my spirits were depressed
And my heart lay like a sodden, soggy doughnut in my breast.
This way and that streamed multitudes, that gayly passed me by--
Not one in all the crowd knew me and not a one knew I!
'Oh, for a touch of home!' I sighed; 'oh, for a friendly face!
Oh, for a hearty handclasp in this teeming desert place!'
And so, soliloquizing as a homesick creature will,
Incontinent, I wandered down the noisy, bustling hill
And drifted, automatic-like and vaguely, into Lowe's,
Where Fortune had in store a panacea for my woes.
The register was open, and there dawned upon my sight
A name that filled and thrilled me with a cyclone of delight--
The name that I shall venerate unto my dying day--
The proud, immortal signature: 'John Smith, U. 

S. 

A.'

Wildly I clutched the register and brooded on that name--
I knew John Smith, yet could not well identify the same.
I knew him North, I knew him South, I knew him East and West--
I knew him all so well I knew not which I knew the best.
His eyes, I recollect, were gray, and black, and brown, and blue,
And, when he was not bald, his hair was of chameleon hue;
Lean, fat, tall, short, rich, poor, grave, gay, a blonde and a brunette--
Aha, amid this London fog, John Smith, I see you yet;
I see you yet, and yet the sight is all so blurred I seem
To see you in composite, or as in a waking dream,
Which are you, John? I'd like to know, that I might weave a rhyme
Appropriate to your character, your politics and clime;
So tell me, were you 'raised' or 'reared'--your pedigree confess
In some such treacherous ism as 'I reckon' or 'I guess';
Let fall your tell-tale dialect, that instantly I may
Identify my countryman, 'John Smith, U. 

S. 

A.'

It's like as not you are the John that lived a spell ago
Down East, where codfish, beans 'nd bona-fide school-marms grow;
Where the dear old homestead nestles like among the Hampshire hills
And where the robin hops about the cherry boughs and trills;
Where Hubbard squash 'nd huckleberries grow to powerful size,
And everything is orthodox from preachers down to pies;
Where the red-wing blackbirds swing 'nd call beside the pickril pond,
And the crows air cawin' in the pines uv the pasture lot beyond;
Where folks complain uv bein' poor, because their money's lent
Out West on farms 'nd railroads at the rate uv ten per cent;
Where we ust to spark the Baker girls a-comin' home from choir,
Or a-settin' namin' apples round the roarin' kitchen fire:
Where we had to go to meetin' at least three times a week,
And our mothers learnt us good religious Dr. Watts to speak,

S. 

A.'

Or, mebbe, Colonel Smith, yo' are the gentleman I know
In the country whar the finest democrats 'nd horses grow;
Whar the ladies are all beautiful an' whar the crap of cawn
Is utilized for Bourbon and true dawters are bawn;
You've ren for jedge, and killed yore man, and bet on Proctor Knott--
Yore heart is full of chivalry, yore skin is full of shot;
And I disremember whar I've met with gentlemen so true
As yo' all in Kaintucky, whar blood an' grass are blue;
Whar a niggah with a ballot is the signal fo' a fight,
Whar a yaller dawg pursues the coon throughout the bammy night;
Whar blooms the furtive 'possum--pride an' glory of the South--
And Aunty makes a hoe-cake, sah, that melts within yo' mouth!
Whar, all night long, the mockin'-birds are warblin' in the trees
And black-eyed Susans nod and blink at every passing breeze,
Whar in a hallowed soil repose the ashes of our Clay--
Hyar's lookin' at yo', Colonel 'John Smith, U. 

S. 

A.'!

Or wuz you that John Smith I knew out yonder in the West--
That part of our republic I shall always love the best?
Wuz you him that went prospectin' in the spring of sixty-nine
In the Red Hoss mountain country for the Gosh-All-Hemlock Mine?
Oh, how I'd like to clasp your hand an' set down by your side
And talk about the good old days beyond the big divide;
Of the rackaboar, the snaix, the bear, the Rocky Mountain goat,
Of the conversazzhyony 'nd of Casey's tabble-dote,
And a word of them old pardners that stood by us long ago
(Three-Fingered Hoover, Sorry Tom and Parson Jim, you know)!
Old times, old friends, John Smith, would make our hearts beat high again,
And we'd see the snow-top mountain like we used to see 'em then;
The magpies would go flutterin' like strange sperrits to 'nd fro,
And we'd hear the pines a-singing' in the ragged gulch below;
And the mountain brook would loiter like upon its windin' way,
Ez if it waited for a child to jine it in its play.

You see, John Smith, just which you are I cannot well recall,
And, really, I am pleased to think you somehow must be all!
For when a man sojourns abroad awhile (as I have done)
He likes to think of all the folks he left at home as one--
And so they are! For well you know there's nothing in a name---
Our Browns, our Joneses and our Smiths are happily the same;
All represent the spirit of the land across the sea,
All stand for one high purpose in our country of the free!
Whether John Smith be from the South, the North, the West, the East--
So long as he's American, it mattereth not the least;
Whether his crest be badger, bear, palmetto, sword or pine,
He is the glory of the stars that with the stripes combine!
Where'er he be, whate'er his lot, he's eager to be known,
Not by his mortal name, but by his country's name alone!
And so, compatriot, I am proud you wrote your name to-day
Upon the register at Lowe's, 'John Smith, U. 

S. 

A.

Choking smoke
Rolling thunder
The forgotten soldier
Still cries for his mother 
Crouching still
with blood stench steaming
The forgotten soldier
Has lost all feeling.

Shocked eyes glance
From corpse strewn clay
Where wide eyed shattered
children lay
Time stands still
With no solid floor
He is reborn  -
To face the eternal war. 

Doing good to the persons 
-who are friendly 
is pleasant! 

Befriending at any cost with the persons, 
-who do not stick to you (may be enemies) , 
is more pleasant than the other! 

The people may have many food habits, 
-come what may, joining with the  
body-guard brave-men is pleasant

Do you know why 
Women happen to live 
In their husbands’ home traditionally? 
 
I am telling you my dear daughter, by the by! 
Patience, mercy, love, adaptability, 
Give and take policy - 
 
Better understanding of relatives 
Irrespective of the different ages 
Is quite natural and inborn for women! 
 
The adaptability and related characters 
Are set more naturally in the minds 
And genes of the women for generations! 
 
That is how the culture 
Of joint family was established 
Years and years for ever! – But 
 
Why in this generation of years 
There is lot of protest in the minds 
Of modern girls; and their parents! 
 
Girls’ parents need suitable bridegrooms, 
But without grooms’ parents; unwilling 
To live in joint family! 
 
The reason behind this attitude 
Is that the girls in large number 
Want to be independent with freedom! 
 
Education is a must for girls 
They should think and refine 
To the betterment of the family! 
 
Of course with various options, 
Post graduate qualifications 
Professional courses etc, etc! 
 
Information technology jobs, 
Admin and management jobs, 
Not the least teaching jobs! 
 
Women get equal and higher salaries, 
With lot of perks and benefits, 
With sufficient maternity leaves! 
 
Equal rights, women liberation, 
Men and women living together, 
If difference of opinion, Divorce! 
 
Living with elderly and experienced people 
Is always a heartfelt wisely support 
Leading a happy life without any doubt

We laugh at the same funny things, 
Our quick sense of humour just springs
From being together, 
Whatever the weather, 
It's wonderful what such laughter brings.

We can each see the funny side, that's true, 
But of course we can sometimes be blue, 
But if one of us is down, 
Then the others a clown
Enticing a smile to break through.

Sometimes, when we're both very tired, 
And we feel that we're electrically wired, 
Something just makes us smile, 
And after a while, 
We can laugh, which is just what's required.

I won't say there's not sadness in life, 
But try looking beyond all the strife, 
We keep smiling along, 
Till the sadness has gone, 
That's the delight of being 'husband and wife'.

but somethig to
make you feel good, 
something to drive, 
away the cold and, 
the sadness but, 
jokes can be used, 
to hurt people, 
to harm and they, 
really bite if, 
they are used, 
the wrong way, 
and i know cuz, 
i've been in the, 
firing line to, 
many times to let, 
it get to me,

When fierce political debate
Throughout the isle was storming,
And Rads attacked the throne and state,
And Tories the reforming,
To calm the furious rage of each,
And right the land demented,
Heaven sent us Jolly Jack, to teach
The way to be contented.

Jack's bed was straw, 'twas warm and soft,
His chair, a three-legged stool;
His broken jug was emptied oft,
Yet, somehow, always full.
His mistress' portrait decked the wall,
His mirror had a crack;
Yet, gay and glad, though this was all
His wealth, lived Jolly Jack.

To give advice to avarice,
Teach pride its mean condition,
And preach good sense to dull pretence,
Was honest Jack's high mission.
Our simple statesman found his rule
Of moral in the flagon,
And held his philosophic school
Beneath the 'George and Dragon.'

And called the malt-tax sinful,
Jack heeded not their angry words,
But smiled and drank his skinful.
And when men wasted health and life,
In search of rank and riches,
Jack marked aloof the paltry strife,
And wore his threadbare breeches.

'I enter not the church,' he said,
But I'll not seek to rob it;'
So worthy Jack Joe Miller read,
While others studied Cobbett.
His talk it was of feast and fun;
His guide the Almanack;
From youth to age thus gayly run
The life of Jolly Jack.

And when Jack prayed, as oft he would,
He humbly thanked his Maker;
'I am,' said he, 'O Father good!
Nor Catholic nor Quaker:
Give each his creed, let each proclaim
His catalogue of curses;
I trust in Thee, and not in them,
In Thee, and in Thy mercies!

'Forgive me if, midst all Thy works,
No hint I see of damning;
And think there's faith among the Turks,
And hope for e'en the Brahmin.
Harmless my mind is, and my mirth,
And kindly is my laughter:
I cannot see the smiling earth,
And think there's hell hereafter.'

Jack died; he left no legacy,
Save that his story teaches:—
Content to peevish poverty;
Humility to riches.
Ye scornful great, ye envious small,
Come follow in his track;
We all were happier, if we all
Would copy JOLLY JACK.

Jon posted a poem which at all didnot exist here while it was in the list.. 

suddenly it was evaburated.. 

fatty poem usually swallowed by the shark.. 

Jonathan Jo
Has a mouth like an 'O'
And a wheelbarrow full of surprises;
If you ask for a bat,
Or for something like that,
He has got it, whatever the size is.

If you're wanting a ball,
It's no trouble at all;
Why, the more that you ask for, the merrier -
Like a hoop and a top,
And a watch that won't stop,
And some sweets, and an Aberdeen terrier.

Jonathan Jo
Has a mouth like an 'O,'
But this is what makes him so funny:
If you give him a smile,
Only once in a while,
Then he never expects any money

That air same Jones, which lived in Jones,
   He had this pint about him:
He'd swear with a hundred sighs and groans,
That farmers MUST stop gittin' loans,
   And git along without 'em:

That bankers, warehousemen, and sich
   Was fatt'nin' on the planter,
And Tennessy was rotten-rich
A-raisin' meat and corn, all which
   Draw'd money to Atlanta:

And the only thing (says Jones) to do
   Is, eat no meat that's boughten:
`But tear up every I, O, U,
And plant all corn and swear for true
   To quit a-raisin' cotton!'

Thus spouted Jones (whar folks could hear,
   -- At Court and other gatherin's),
And thus kep' spoutin' many a year,
Proclaimin' loudly far and near
   Sich fiddlesticks and blatherin's.

But, one all-fired sweatin' day,
   It happened I was hoein'
My lower corn-field, which it lay
'Longside the road that runs my way
   Whar I can see what's goin'.

And a'ter twelve o'clock had come
   I felt a kinder faggin',
And laid myself un'neath a plum
To let my dinner settle sum,
   When 'long come Jones's waggin,

And Jones was settin' in it, SO:
   A-readin' of a paper.
His mules was goin' powerful slow,
Fur he had tied the lines onto
   The staple of the scraper.

The mules they stopped about a rod
   From me, and went to feedin'
'Longside the road, upon the sod,
But Jones (which he had tuck a tod)
   Not knowin', kept a-readin'.

And presently says he:  "Hit's true;
   That Clisby's head is level.
Thar's one thing farmers all must do,
To keep themselves from goin' tew
   Bankruptcy and the devil!

"More corn! more corn! MUST plant less ground,
   And MUSTN'T eat what's boughten!
Next year they'll do it:  reasonin's sound:
(And, cotton will fetch 'bout a dollar a pound),
   THARFORE, I'LL plant ALL cotton!"i

Jonquil was a shepherd lad,
White he was as the curded cream,
Hair like the buttercups he had,
And wet green eyes like a full chalk stream.

ii

His teeth were as white as the stones that lie
Down in the depths of the sun-bright river,
And his lashes danced like a dragon-fly
With drops on the gauzy wings that quiver.

iii

His lips were as red as round ripe cherries,
And his delicate cheek's and his rose-pink neck
Were stained with the colour of dog-rose berries
When they lie on the snow like a crimson fleck.

iv

His feet were all stained with the cowslips and grass
To amber and verdigris,
And through his folds one day did pass
The young prince Fleur-de-lys.

v

Fleur-de-lys was the son of the king.
He was as white as an onyx stone,
His hair was curled like a daffodil ring,

vi

His teeth were as white as the white pearls set
And his lashes were like the dark silk net
That she binds her yellow hair withal.

vii

His lips were as red as the red rubies
The king's bright dagger-hilt that deck,
And pale rose-pink as the amethyst is
Were his delicate cheeks and his rose-pink neck.

viii

His feet were all shod in shoes of gold,
And his coat was as gold as a blackbird's bill is,
With jewel on jewel manifold,
And wrought with a pattern of golden lilies.

ix

When Fleur-de-lys espied Jonquil
He was as glad as a bird in May ;
He tripped right swiftly a-down the hill,
And called to the shepherd boy to play.

x

This fell out ere the sheep-shearing,
That these two lads did sport and toy,
Fleur-de-lys the son of the king,
And sweet Jonquil the shepherd boy.

xi

And after they had played awhile,
Thereafter they to talking fell,
And full an hour they did beguile
While each his state and lot did tell.

xii

For Jonquil spake of the little sheep,
And the tender ewes that know their names,
And he spake of his wattled hut for sleep,
And the country sports and the shepherds' games.

xiii

And he plucked a reed from the edge that girds
The river bank, and with his knife
Made a pipe, with a breath like the singing birds
When they flute to their loves in a musical strife.

xiv

And he told of the night so long and still
When he lay awake till he heard the feet
Of the goat-foot god coming over the hill,
And the rustling sound as he passed through the wheat.

xv

And Fleur-de-lys told of the king and the court,
And the stately dames and the slender pages,
Of his horse and his hawk and his mimic fort,
And the silent birds in their golden, cages.

xvi

And the jewelled sword with the damask blade
That should be his in his fifteenth spring ;
And the silver sound that the gold horns made,
And the tourney lists and the tilting ring.

xvii

And after that they did devise
For mirth and sport, that each should wear
The other's clothes, and in this guise
Make play each other's parts to bear.

xviii

Whereon they stripped off all their clothes,
And when they stood up in the sun,
They were as like as one white rose
On one green stalk, to another one.

xix

And when Jonquil as a prince was shown
And Fleur-de-lys as a shepherd lad,
Their mothers' selves would not have known
That each the other's habit had.

xx

And Jonquil walked like the son of a king
With dainty steps and proud haut look ;
And Fleur-de-lys, that sweet youngling,
Did push and paddle his feet in the brook.

xxi

And while they made play in this wise,
Unto them all in haste did run,
Two lords of the court, with joyful cries,
That long had sought the young king's son.

xxii

And to Jonquil they reverence made
And said, ' My lord, we are come from the king,
Who is sore vexed that thou hast strayed
So far without a following.'

xxiii

Then unto them said Fleur-de-lys
' You do mistake, my lords, for know
That I am the son of the king, and this
Is sweet Jonquil, my playfellow.'

xxiv

Whereat one of these lords replied,
' Thou lying knave, I'll make thee rue
Such saucy words.' But Jonquil cried,
' Nay, nay, my lord, 'tis even true.'

xxv

Whereat these lords were sore distressed,
And one made answer bending knee,
' My lord the prince is pleased to jest.'
But Jonquil answered, ' Thou shalt see.'

xxvi

Sure never yet so strange a thing
As this before was seen,
That a shepherd was thought the son of a king,
And a prince a shepherd boy to have been.

xxvii

' Now mark me well, my noble lord,
A shepherd's feet go bare and cold,
Therefore they are all green from the sward,
And the buttercup makes a stain of gold.

xxviii

' That I am Jonquil thus thou shalt know,
And that this be very Fleur-de-lys
If his feet be like the driven snow,
And mine like the amber and verdigris.'

xxix

He lifted up the shepherd's frock
That clothed the prince, and straight did show
That his naked feet all under his smock
Were whiter than the driven snow.

xxx

He doffed the shoes and the clothes of silk
That he had gotten from Fleur-de-lys,
And all the rest was as white as milk,
But his feet were like amber and verdigris.

xxxi

With that they each took back his own,
And when his second change was done,
As a shepherd boy was Jonquil shown
And Fleur-de-lys the king's true son.

xxxii

By this the sun was low in the heaven,
And Fleur-de-lys must ride away,
But ere he left, with kisses seven,
He vowed to come another day.

Book of Job
Blessing of Numbers  ho says that fictions only and false hair
Become a verse? Is there in truth no beauty?
Is all good structure in a winding stair?
May no lines pass, except they do their duty
Not to a true, but painted chair?

Is it no verse, except enchanted groves
And sudden arbours shadow coarse-spun lines?
Must purling streams refresh a lover's loves?
Must all be veiled, while he that reads divines,
Catching the sense at two removes?

Shepherds are honest people: let them sing:
Riddle who list, for me, and pull for prime:
I envy no man's nightingale or spring;
Nor let them punish me with loss of rhyme,

Oh, mighty city of New York, you are wonderful to behold--
Your buildings are magnificent-- the truth be it told--
They were the only thing that seemed to arrest my eye,
Because many of them are thirteen storeys high;

And as for Central Park, it is lovely to be seen--
Especially in the summer season when its shrubberies are green
And the Burns Statue is there to be seen,
Surrounded by trees on the beautiful sward so green;
Also Shakespeare and the immortal Sir Walter Scott,
Which by Scotchmen and Englishmen will never be forgot. 

There are people on the Sabbath day in thousands resort--
All lov'd, in conversation, and eager for sport;
And some of them viewing the wild beasts there,
While the joyous shouts of children does rend the air--
And also beautiful black swans, I do declare. 

And there's beautiful boats to be seen there,
And joyous shouts of children does rend the air,
While the boats sail along with them o'er Lohengrin Lake,
And fare is cents for children, and adults ten is all they take. 

And there's also summer-house shades, and merry-go-rounds
And with the merry laughter of the children the Park resounds,
During the live-long Sabbath day
Enjoying themselves at the merry-go-round play. 

Then there's the elevated railroads abont five storeys high,
Which the inhabitants can hear night and day passing by;
Of, such a mass of people there daily do throng--
No less than five daily pass along;
And all along the city you can get for five cents--
And, believe me, among the passengers there's few discontent. 

And the top of the houses are mostly all flat,
And in the warm weather the people gather to chat;
Besides, on the housetops they dry their clothes;
And, also, many people all night on the housetops repose. 

And numerous ships end steamboats are there to be seen,
Sailing along the East River water, which is very green--
Which is certainly a most beautiful sight
To see them sailing o'er the smooth water day and night. 

And as for Brooklyn Bridge, it's a very great height,
And fills the stranger's heart with wonder at first sight;
And with all its loftiness I venture to say
It cannot surpass the new railway bridge of the Silvery Tay. 

And there's also ten thousand rumsellers there--
Oh, wonderful to think of, I do declare!
To accommodate the people of New York therein,
And to encourage them to commit all sorts of sin.

And on the Sabbath day ye will see many a man
Going for beer with a big tin can,
And seems proud to be seen carrying home the beer
To treat his neighbours and his family dear. 

Then at night numbers of the people dance and sing,
Making the walls of their houses to ring
With their songs and dancing on Sabbath night,
Which I witnessed with disgust, and fled from the sight. 

And with regard to New York and the sights I did see--
Believe me, I never saw such sights in Dundee;
And the morning I sailed from the city of New York
IHH: Ziofascist Israel shot Journalist in the head at close range
Filed under Expose! no comments 
".. He was shot from a distance of no more than three feet and his brain exploded - one of our friends was shot even after he gave up"
-

Turkish humanitarian organization organizing the Freedom Flotilla attacked by Israeli naval commando has accused the activists were shot dead at close range.

Bülent Yildirm, who heads the Humanitarian Aid Foundation (IHH) , told reporters at the airport in Istanbul stating how a journalist named Cevdet killed by Israeli soldiers for no reason.

"He was just taking pictures. He was shot from a distance of no more than three feet and his brain exploded - one of our friends was shot even after he gave up, " AFP quoted the statement Yildrim.

He accused the Israeli navy to kill "anyone who according to them to fight and even threw some activists into the sea.

"We were given the body of nine martyrs, but we have a long list of missing persons.. Our doctor gave more than wounded, when we came back, they (Israel)   said there were only people were injured."

UN Human Rights Council adopted a Council resolution on Wednesday, said it would set up an independent international investigation into the actions of Israel’s outrageous attacks against relief convoy of six ships.

Tel Aviv regime, which supported the military to use lethal force as an act of "self-defense, " the UN security council rejected the decision by saying the council had "no moral authority."

Israeli officials said nine people were killed in a deadly attack Monday, but reports from Palestinian sources said about people were killed. (FQ / prtv)  

Another headshot with Bullets 

A U. 

S. citizen who lived in Turkey is among the nine people killed when Israeli commandos stormed a Turkish aid ship heading for the Gaza Strip, officials said today. The victim was identified as Furkan Dogan, a Turkish-American. A forensic report said he was shot at close range, with four bullets in his head and one in his chest, according to the Anatolian news agency. More


Our journey is just
From heaven to womb to earth
This way or that way
Then towards hell or heaven 
With the end of the last breath. 

Ah, could I lay me down in this long grass
And close my eyes, and let the quiet wind
Blow over me—I am so tired, so tired
Of passing pleasant places! All my life,
Following Care along the dusty road,
Have I looked back at loveliness and sighed;
Yet at my hand an unrelenting hand
Tugged ever, and I passed. All my life long
Over my shoulder have I looked at peace;
And now I fain would lie in this long grass
And close my eyes.
       Yet onward!
             Cat birds call
Through the long afternoon, and creeks at dusk
Are guttural. Whip-poor-wills wake and cry,
Drawing the twilight close about their throats.
Only my heart makes answer. Eager vines
Go up the rocks and wait; flushed apple-trees
Pause in their dance and break the ring for me;
And bayberry, that through sweet bevies thread
Of round-faced roses, pink and petulant,
Look back and beckon ere they disappear.
Only my heart, only my heart responds.
Yet, ah, my path is sweet on either side
All through the dragging day,—sharp underfoot
And hot, and like dead mist the dry dust hangs—
But far, oh, far as passionate eye can reach,
And long, ah, long as rapturous eye can cling,
The world is mine: blue hill, still silver lake,
Broad field, bright flower, and the long white road
A gateless garden, and an open path:
My feet to follow, and my heart to hold. 

Quest of dreams in old tale, 
Of towering ideals once heard, 
Lost in the ceaseless time travel, 
Dreams turning stale and cold, 
Void as a beggars bowl; 

Searching in desert sand dunes, 
Tired thirsty and humdrum, 
The pebbles of my lost dream, 
Under the scorching heat and sun, 
Lost in the harrowing life's stream; 

Bound by the desire cage, 
Sighting water as a haze, 
Like an oasis in a desert range, 
Approaching near to find a mirage, 
Perseverance turning to rage, 
Digging desert of desire under a blaze, 

Lost in the darkness of moonlit night, 
Searching the lost dream figment, 
In the dusky dungeons like a Bat, 
Darkness spreads nothing to sight, 
Igniting moon makes illusion brighter, 
Disappearing with clouds moving faster; 

Stranded in the faraway deep blue sea, 
Searching the dusky evading dreams, 
With sun and blowing breeze, 
With water up to the neck and brim, 
Sighting shelter on a faraway shore, 
Nearer I go finding nothing more;My journey 
a neverending path
in a sky vast with stars. 

The time that my journey takes is long and the way of it long. 

I came out on the chariot of the first gleam of light, and pursued my 
voyage through the wildernesses of worlds leaving my track on many a star and planet. 

It is the most distant course that comes nearest to thyself, 
and that training is the most intricate which leads to the utter simplicity of a tune. 

The traveler has to knock at every alien door to come to his own, 
and one has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost shrine at the end. 

My eyes strayed far and wide before I shut them and said `Here art thou!' 

The question and the cry `Oh, where?' melt into tears of a thousand 
streams and deluge the world with the flood of the assurance `I am!


'The Underground is a kaleidoscope: 
at each station, a new shake; and 

according to your mood 
every shake’s a magnification 

of your love of humanity; or 
confirms your worst fears; 

shake 

I’m sitting with the article 
I wrote at home, hunched 
over the keyboard 
in a smaller world 

now I’m revising it in private 
but in this public space 
of this kaleidoscope; it’s good this way. 

shake 

A lad sits down next to me. After a minute 
I feel he’s discreetly reading what I’m editing. 

I love this game. I tilt the paper imperceptibly 
so he can read it better.. 
careful not to give the game away.. 

shake 

He’s interested; he’s not reading idly; now 
he’s not hiding his reading any more; 

now, he can’t restrain himself at 
the top of the page as I turn over.. 

his eyes shine. He stubs his finger at a quote 
‘Meditation makes me feel more myself-’ 

‘That’s it! That’s it! ’ he says; as if 
I didn’t believe my own quote.. 

shake 

He’s out the next station; that’s 
all he needed. All I needed. All it needed. 

How bright the underground kaleidoscope 
shines now. 

In the long journey out of the self,
There are many detours, washed-out interrupted raw places
Where the shale slides dangerously
And the back wheels hang almost over the edge
At the sudden veering, the moment of turning.
Better to hug close, wary of rubble and falling stones.
The arroyo cracking the road, the wind-bitten buttes, the canyons,
Creeks swollen in midsummer from the flash-flood roaring into the narrow valley.
Reeds beaten flat by wind and rain,
Grey from the long winter, burnt at the base in late summer.
-- Or the path narrowing,
Winding upward toward the stream with its sharp stones,
The upland of alder and birchtrees,
Through the swamp alive with quicksand,
The way blocked at last by a fallen fir-tree,
The thickets darkening,
The ravines ugly. 

Journey of the Passenger




Full autumn air, the cocks crying the dawn moon and the vast cooking smoke
Sparrows noising the rising sun and the morning dew round, charming spring light
Journey of the passenger for years, the long-awaited home, the person has been old
Often accompany the parents, the filial piety is first, a dream of floating life


I often think
And it comes in my mind
Why is not life
All pleasing and kind
And why can't we stay
Happy and in fain
And why do we have
The waves of pain? ? ? 
But mostly I don't get
Any answer or reply
Neither it suggests
The cause of this WHY

So usually I feel
May be it is because
Our sins of the past
Is its main cause
that we do wiothout thinking
That soon we have to face
The phase in which we'll start
A journey to a new place
Where no one but only us
Will be driving our lives bus
And then we have to reply
For all we have done and WHY? ? 

I think I'll journey out some day to wondrous lands afar, 
Or even chart a journey to a distant blazing star.
But rest assured that when my journey begs to take its cue, 
Always know that when I go, this journey takes you too.

We'll start our journey out from here by horse and cart of old, 
The seaside docks - and journey pauses - where we shall behold
A noble schooner for the journey primed to launch as planned: 
To sail with dolphins cross the seas then journey back on land.
 
And so our journey goes by foot to conquer mountains tall: 
A chapter hence the journey reached, with scenes that should enthral.
But when we tire, let's rest our journey, stretched in fields of flowers, 
And bathe atop the mountain from the journey - autumn showers! 

Refreshed, our journey takes a turn - we'll venture back for home, 
But first we'll let the journey take a tangent just to roam.
And in the winding route, this journey's bound to bide content, 
But most of all take heed - let's make our journey life's event.



Stars after the d stage
From the swing's isles
Lifelong crossing continues
Up to the life itself does fuse
No scope to share
But to lonely, surely bear, 

The ending line has not appeared yet
The motion is more in heart
To cross all the rest
Then they will inevitably go
Them you all shall follow
Thus we all will pass
Today, tomorrow, other days. 

Vanity hits my Face
All around this ugly Place
Why can’t I see? 
I understand through all of your eyes
Yet, it is the Fog of the Night
That tends to blind my Soul a-Flight

High above the clouds, the mind is away
And the Sun can’t come out to play
The blackest heart has felt a soul
Beautiful eyes tell it all (That should be told) 
I can’t see my mind
Yet, I understand the thought of mankind

I am only human, so are you, so high
Open minds fly open souls on cloud nine
Divine forgive the sins
Let loving hearts befriend
I am gone to the castle
Artistic, High Clouds see, yet only through the mind’s eye

Let your eyes not cry
Or minds die
For I don’t even know if mine’s alive
Yet, it keeps me sane
High on paradise to kill the pain
Clocks ticking, tocking in a brain
I’ll fill my eulogy with poetic rhyme sure to make all cry
Today and Tomorrow I’m high on living high (In a castle in the blue sky)Journeying down a path that opens up as we walk

Where will it take us, as we talk! 


The mystique of our meeting beckons, invitingly

And we walk on, trustingly


Holding hands, under a clear blue sky 

Through a verdant garden, that history stopped by


As eagles soar above, approvingly

We step towards each other, confidently


We barely know each other

But still feel close


As if words, and their meaning

Are wrapped in comforts fold


The sun made me luminous 

And you a smouldering flame 


Our eyes speak a language 

Our souls seem to understand 


The rules of the game fall by the wayside, 

As we walk hand in hand. 

Trees moved along, clouds too
with the moon, the about-to-drown orange-sun
in sooty hours, slow;
they boiled down to a single feeling:

and I saw markets, old and new
where they sold, the same things—
Flesh of goats, cows, pigs,
hens or roosters,
ducks
and women

    (they wore red, like lipstick
    they wore clothes that failed functions
    like hides, hung
    over bones and clotheslines).

Nothing has changed
like red silk-cotton flowers
on green grass,
they remained
motionless, dead
yet striking
with repugnance,
not beauty.

Sometimes, I saw guns too
and brooms, that cleaned blood
like milk spilled by a cow’s hind-legs-kick
from the milk-maid’s knee-hold.

The same street, and people
and blood, guns, flesh traded
for money
It all remained the same
like a blood red morning sun
with the newspaper, red
roasted flesh
they still drink tea, brownish red
ginger-flavoured.

Once I saw a river too:
legends flowed on its simmering leaves
carried, with soil and life.
I sat on its bank
and listened.

When they ended, I found myself
on its bank: not in a time beyond
when people were afraid to cross it wearing
gold bracelets, silver toe-rings—
    In case, a stormy wave swallowed them
    a wild wailing wind from the untamed forests
    hit them hard, pushed them into the river.

I felt I was going back.
Just felt.
And I found myself, amidst the river winds,
and legends that its white sands reeked
like rotting fish, jasmines, cow dung,
and rain.

Maybe this road, this journey
tree-crowded, cloud-shaded,
would also end in the same despair
And I would wait, stranded amidst smells
of fish, jasmine, cow-dung.
Though I was moving forward,
continually, I felt
as if I was going back.

Don’t know where—
but I knew I would end up
where I started
so I went on.

Flesh, fragrance, jasmine
fish, cow-dung, women
and then the red colour
sometimes sun, sometimes silk-cotton flowers
or the blood which I mistook
for flowers. 

I wander through
crowded streets of your paralyzed brain
psychotic hypnotic blur of smells and hues
dust and rage, rust and age
never a new day. All the same, 
I wander.

I seek
calm of an ocean with a raging storm; 
sanctity of the union of real and not; 
the colours of a butterfly on
a fresh, youthful, restless breeze.
I seek.

I find
loss and grief, gold and greed
pain mindlessly embraced and people refused
in the turbulent hopeless mess
I find, I seek, I wander. 

Golden fields of wheat swaying in the blustery wind and rain, 
Lambs playful, so innocent and tame, 
Never straying from their mother's side, 
Friends leave us alone when taken suddenly, 
No time for goodbyes, 
Parents nourish our fragile hearts, 
To stand up strong and endure, 
Lovers are a source of inspiration for hope of a better future, 
Filled with warmth, kisses, embracing the truth in our eyes, 
Music fills our desires with everlasting poetry and a lingering sigh, 
Nature engulfs our sight with wonderous beauty, 
To awake and listen to the melody of birds, singing at dawn, 
Having soul is not about your house and freshly mowed lawn, 
An open suitcase with passion, belief and purpose, 
Fill it with all your might, 
Go into the throng of the multitudes, 
Speak out for freedom of your spirit that wanders, 
That seeks the eternal, life giving questions, 
That makes us reflect and ponder
With bare feet striding towards everlasing life, 
And to lovingly mind, 
In a new land that is journeys end, 
We will find our celestial peace when our torn emotions will mend.de tues au Vietnam

   -l'ete,  'Numbers in Red Notebook'. Allen Ginsberg.
    Tr.July,

'Twas not my nectar made thy strength divine,
But 'twas thy strength which made my nectar thine

My heart is like a little bird
 That sits and sings for very gladness.
Sorrow is some forgotten word, 
 And so, except in rhyme, is sadness.

The world is very fair to me –
 Such azure skies, such golden weather, 
I’m like a long caged bird set free, 
 My heart is lighter than a feather.

I rise rejoicing in my life; 
My days flow on unmarred by strife, 
 And sweetened by my pleasant labour.

O youth! O spring! O happy days, 
 Ye are so passing sweet, and tender, 
And while the fleeting season stays, 
 I revel care-free, in its splendour. 

Though joy is better than sorrow joy is not great;
Peace is great, strength is great.
Not for joy the stars burn, not for joy the vulture
Spreads her gray sails on the air
Over the mountain; not for joy the worn mountain
Stands, while years like water
Trench his long sides. 'I am neither mountain nor bird
Nor star; and I seek joy.'
The weakness of your breed: yet at length quietness
Will cover those wistful eyes. 

I am elated, 
Spinning, 
Dancing, 
Frolicking
happy.
Skipping along in pretty new shoes 
happy.
‘kin puppa lick’ and fall down
happy, 
Girl in pigtails
with red ribbons
happy
Smiling from ear to ear, 
jaws aching happy
Beautiful sunshiny day after rainfall
happy.
Basking in the afterglow 
of your loving happy
Loving your sweet kisses happy
Today, 
I found my happy 
wrapped up like a present 
in you.

Kin puppa lick - A Jamaican expression for falling head over heels★ Joy and Peace in Believing
☆ by John Newton

Sometimes a light surprises 
With healing in his wings: 
When comforts are declining, 
He grants the soul again 
A season of clear shining, 
To cheer it after rain.

In holy contemplation, 
We sweetly then pursue 
And find it ever new: 
Set free from present sorrow, 
We cheerfully can say, 
E'en let th' unknown to-morrow 
Bring with it what it may.

It can bring with it nothing 
But he will bear us through; 
Who gives the lilies clothing, 
Will clothe his people too: 
Beneath the spreading heavens, 
No creature but is fed; 
And he who feeds the ravens, 
Will give his children bread.

Though vine nor fig-tree neither 
Their wonted fruit shall bear, 
Though all the field should wither, 
Nor flocks nor herds be there: 
His praise shall tune my voice; 
For while in him confiding, 
I cannot but rejoice. 


Now, joy is born of parents poor, 
And pleasure of our richer kind; 
Though pleasure's free, she cannot sing 
As sweet a song as joy confined. 

Pleasure's a Moth, that sleeps by day 
And dances by false glare at night; 
But Joy's a Butterfly, that loves 
To spread its wings in Nature's light. 

Joy's like a Bee that gently sucks 
Away on blossoms its sweet hour; 
But pleasure's like a greedy Wasp, 
That plums and cherries would devour. 

Joy's like a Lark that lives alone, 
Whose ties are very strong, though few; 
But Pleasure like a Cuckoo roams, 
Makes much acquaintance, no friends true. 

Joy from her heart doth sing at home, 
With little care if others hear; 
But pleasure then is cold and dumb, 
And sings and laughs with strangers near. 

joy and sorrow resolute within and beyond
night seems to lie in deep sleep
speckles of darkness covers her body
i close my eyes by the bliss of love

tonight tolls cry of innocence
as we look back through lone silence
audacity of hope resigns to repose
rain was running in deep breath

earth clenches mirth into riff of dusts
thirst dissolute melting the shadow
would you not comeback to fold of tonight
moments still remembers tinge of snow


Then a woman said, "Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow
 


And he answered: 

Your joy is your sorrow unmasked. 

And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears. 

And how else can it be? 

The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain. 

Is not the cup that hold your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven? 

And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives? 

When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy. 

When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight. 

Some of you say, "Joy is greater than sorrow," and others say, "Nay, sorrow is the greater
 


But I say unto you, they are inseparable. 

Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed. 

Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy. 

Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced. 

When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall. 

Joy, anger, sadness and sorrow, things in life

On these undulating hills where sheep roam free, 
and every rabbit builds his own colony.
Yellow cowslips, pink clover and purple vetch, 
add colour to the green fields as they stretch
as far as the eye can see.  Here’s such a view
to fill the heart with joy that’s long overdue.

The fresh, sweet, clear air that swirls and twirls around, 
only in the quiet countryside is found.
And placid cows that will wander munching grass, 
take such little notice of us as we pass.
Rooks cawing loudly throughout the hours of day, 
seem to send a warning. ‘Don’t you dare to stay’.

This ground so lush with all its fine thriving plants.
Animals, birds and insects, how they all enhance.
Beautiful  treasury set out here to find, 
available for each being of mankind.
The pleasure should be welcomed by everyone.
On these undulating hills, joy has begun.



Sister spirit, listen!
Methinks I hear a song,
Resounding strangely, sadly,
These peaceful plains along.

SECOND SPIRIT

'Tis like those lays we sang in earthly days,
When we trod our pilgrimage of pain;

FIRST SPIRIT

And earthlike are those values
Which chant the solemn strain:

CHORUS OF MORTALS

Low in the dust before Thee,
Great King of Kings, we fall!
Least of the host which adore Thee,
Do not despise our call!
From the paths of right,
We have wander'd, we have wander'd,
We have all gone astray;
In thy holy sight,
We are guilty, we are guilty --
We have all gone astray;
Yet hear us! hear us! hear us,
And cast us not away.

CHORUS OF ANGELS

Children of Earth! your pray'r is heard in Heaven,
Where Mercy heeds the softest whisper'd moan:
Ransom'd, arise! your sins are all forgiven,
Your Father saith who sitteth on the Throne:
And it is his gracious bidding:
"Bring forth the robes!" -- 
his heart of love was yearning
To greet repentant sons far away.
Lost once, but found!
We welcome their returning!
There's joy in Heav'n today!
There's joy in Heav'n today!

FIRST SPIRIT

Sister spirit, yonder,
By that celestial gate,
What throngs of weary pilgrims,
In supplication wait.

SECOND SPIRIT

They know and yet how fondly those are met,
Who at last from wandering ways draw nigh --

FIRST SPIRIT

They know not yet how boundless
His love to whom they cry:

CHORUS OF MORTALS

No place claim we with the Holy,
Thronging thy blissfull halls;
Grant us a refuge lowly,
Graciously near these walls.
There on bended knees,
Tho' unworthy, most unworthy,
We will worship and pray;
Oh, hear us! hear us! hear us,
And cast us not away.

CHORUS OF ANGELS

Children of Earth! no more, in sadness bended,
You supplicate a distant Throne of Grace:
Ransom'd, arise! your days of prayer are ended --
You meet your waiting Father face to face:
For he sendeth heralds saying:
"Unfold the gates! -- with gladness come before us,
And to the royal seats to my guests convey

"
Angels! begin the neverending chorus!
There's joy in Heav'n today!
There's joy in Heav'n today!

And I heard, and I heard
as it were the voice of a great multitude,
and the voice of many waters,
and the voice of mighty thunderings,
say ---- - ing;

QUARTETTE

He gathers his wanderers home
We welcome the last arrived one!
Oh, bles-sed employ!
our infinite joy (our infinte joy)
Is begun!

FULL CHORUS

Now will we sing to Thee
(to Thee) (to Thee) now will we sing,
Our Father, our Redeemer and our King,

Our choicest, noblest, most triumphant lays,

There is joy in the woods just now,
       The leaves are whispers of song,
And the birds make mirth on the bough
       And music the whole day long,
       In these springlike summer days,
On my brow an unfading frown
       And hate in my heart always—

A machine out of gear, aye, tired,
Yet forced to go on—for I’m hired.

Just forced to go on through fear,
       For every day I must eat
And find ugly clothes to wear,
       And bad shoes to hurt my feet
And a shelter for work-drugged sleep!
       A mere drudge! but what can one do?
A man that’s a man cannot weep!
       Suicide? A quitter? Oh, no!

But a slave should never grow tired,
Whom the masters have kindly hired.

But oh! for the woods, the flowers
       Of natural, sweet perfume,
The heartening, summer showers
       And the smiling shrubs in bloom,
Dust-free, dew-tinted at morn,
       The fresh and life-giving air,
The billowing waves of corn
       And the birds’ notes rich and clear:—

For a man-machine toil-tired
May crave beauty too—though he’s hired


Why should I be anxious? 
Anxiety takes my smile away.

Joy is my dress which I try to wear every morning.
I smile knowingly because a happy heart is cheerful.

Hatred crushes the spirit.
I want to love all those who hate me.

I want to dream deeply of peace and love.
I want to express great joy.
Joy is contagious


Though I wait, and time overpasses by a mile
It still seems as a perfect lie 
To me, that; the recent palate is transparent -
You never know it is to die.

I can wait for years to pass, 
I can maintain walking till I reach the grass, 
I can gain the place I dreamed again, 
Yet I can't dream -again, and again- like 
A tarn, in its vain. 

Joy of a Jew
Thank god
We have gotten a country named Israel.
Our ancestors were living here before B. 

C.
We have snatched this land from a down trodden country Palestine on gun point.
American and its allies construct Israel after Second World War to provide a separate country for the Jews of the world.
They can make it in U. 

S. 

S. 

R., U. 

S. 

A. France and Australia.
But they have chosen Palestine because this country was not as powerful as they were.
People of Palestine also eager to get their land back from us but they can not do this.
If in the future they comes on front foot then what will be the future of Israel? 
I don’t know, 

Joy of my life while left me here!
And still my love!
How in thy absence thou dost steer
Me from above!
A life well led
This truth commends,
With quick or dead
It never ends.

Stars are of mighty use; the night
Is dark, and long;
The road foul; and where one goes right,
Six may go wrong.
One twinkling ray,
Shot o'er some cloud,
May clear much away,
And guide a crowd.

Here long must pass
O'er dark hills, swift streams, and steep ways
As smooth as glass;
But these all night,
Like candles, shed
Their beams, and light
Us into bed.

They are, indeed, our pillar-fires,
Seen as we go;
They are that city's shining spires
We travel to:
A swordlike gleam
Kept man for sin
First 
out
; this beam
Will guide them 
in. 

folks. 
stop this compete
it never makes us complete

who can out do the other
when we are all stringed together
like the drops in a wave

our identity
is so wholesome
let us not make it so tiny

post and position
gains at our disposition
not at the cost of our whole

the joy of this whole
is embedded within
each of our souls

tiny we may seem
the success of our tiny selves
is not at all our highest esteem

we are born to enjoy
the joy of the whole
so. 

folks
stop this compete

Centuries before
Twin legs
Synchronously walking
So much toil
Moving here and there
Reaching destination
Wherever I want
But so much time
And tiredness too
Then came a boon
A gift no one expected
And a great invention too
Bicycle invented
So much relief 
To human community
No more toil
Destination reached
And distance covered
With so much ease
Windy air
As gentle as ever
Good for health
Feel so fresh
No more fuss
No more pain
Eco friendly too
Joy attained
Not to say
Boundaries unlimited


Day is dawn, early morn 
Enormous fish in the nets, 
Joyful  fishermen

Children the gift of god
Their happiness the great moment of joy
Their learning  the happiest event
The meaning of life through their achievement.

Children, the purity of innocence in them
No disparities of world disturbs them
No conflicts of human minds concerns them
Children they are always entitled happiness.

A world without children can't be imagined
A world without their smiling gets bored
Their emotions, be it happy or sadness
Always the expression of innocence there.

A pair of new dresses, or beautiful toys
A good color pencil, or beautiful picture
A facility to express their aptitude 
A worthwhile feeling in their face comes.

Best of talents of children a hope of future
Giving them ample opportunities to grow
A great service to them and to the world
Where children of today are tomorrow's hope. 

The Prospect was the Gate of Heaven, that Day
The ancient Light of Eden did convey 
Into my Soul: I was an Adam there,
A little Adam in a Sphere 
Of Joys! O there my Ravished sense 
Was entertained in Paradise,
And had a Sight of Innocence. All was beyond all Bound and Price.
An Antepast [foretaste] of Heaven sure! 
I on the Earth did reign. 
Within, without me, all was pure.
I must become a Child again. 

When beauty breaks and falls asunder
I feel no grief for it, but wonder.
When love, like a frail shell, lies broken,
I keep no chip of it for token.
I never had a man for friend
Who did not know that love must end.
I never had a girl for lover
Who could discern when love was over.
What the wise doubt, the fool believes--
Who is it, then, that love deceives

Canadian


And the curse of thistle and thorn--
But Tubal got him a pointed rod,
And scrabbled the earth for corn.
Old--old as that early mould,
Young as the sprouting grain-- 
Yearly green is the strife between
Jubal and Tubal Cain!

Jubal sang of the new-found sea,
And the love that its waves divide--
But Tubal hollowed a fallen tree
And passed to the further side.
Black-black as the hurricane-wrack,
Salt as the under-main-
Bitter and cold is the hate they hold--
Jubal and Tubal Cain!

Jubal sang of the golden years
Uhen wars and wounds shall cease--
But Tubal fashioned the hand-flung spears
And showed his neighbours peace
New--new as Nine-point-Two
Older than Lamech's slain--
Roaring and loud is the feud avowed
Twix'' Jubal and Tubal Cain!

Jubal sang of the cliffs that bar
And the peaks that none may crown--
But Tubal clambered by jut and scar
And there he builded a town.
High-high as the snowsheds lie,
Low as the culverts drain--
Wherever they be they can never agree--
Jubal and Tubal Cain

Street lights shine gently onto the snow, 
An eerie sight, this midnight glow.
Rows of dustbins standing aloof, 
Pigeons ranging along the roof
Of a terraced abode, two up two down.
And trudging home is young James Brown, 
He works in darkness at the pit
His jacket's thin, his boots they've split, 
Cold feet freezing where water seeps in, 
Causing great pain and blistered skin.

Excavating for coal is his toil each day, 
Earning a pittance to keep hunger at bay, 
But he battles on, just to survive, 
And all his life he'll continue to strive, 
Body shivering once the coldness starts, 
But love will warm the saddest of hearts, 
For  will greet him at the door, 
With a loving hug and a kiss for sure, 
Mellow lights will beam out onto the snow, 
Such a welcome sight in Jubilee Row.

'Tis clear demise, 
my Judas.
Kiss my eyes farewell.
It is too late to cry for me.

I can see through your tears.
I am expecting nothing now
in recompense.
It is too late.
You give me away.

Anyway, freedom beckons.
I live with power
I've prepared in me.
You'll travel a course
that will surely be uncertain.

I've lived in past hope, 
not you and she.
Have you enough rope? 



Where we are
Do you dare to speak
Are you natural in here
Where is your so called identity
We are feeling the feelings
Of others not ours
We speak for others
Not for ourselves
Where is our naturalness
We are just imitators
Imitation, Imitation
Silence! 
I hear the court is in session
Can't you smell 'His' way
Yes, yes
We are experiencing it. 

As the political volunteers
.  

who lost their sense 

were doing lots of unruly activities 
.  

throughout the road-ways 

as a sequence of the judgement by the court 
. (against their leader) , what misfortune the travelling
 
innocent people did to get stranded 
.  

on the highway? you tell

We dislike in others, reflections of

The dark shadows of our soul

We want to escape 


Judging others

Criticizing, fault finding 

In reality condemning ourselves


Unable to face the truth

Rejecting the reality we may find 

Forgiving ourselves too easily


While transferring blame to the other

He did this to me! Look at what she did! 

Its easier to get by this way, but not simpler


Truth doesn’t escape a knowing heart

Biding time, till we accept 

That judging others is to judge ourselves



Will be thrown into the lake of fire wheresoever
It will be destroyed and we will remember never
We will have no knowledge that they existed, ever

(Rev   Rev      











When the Judged,
His action laid away,
Divested is of every Disk
But his sincerity.

Honor is then the safest hue
In a posthumous Sun - 
Not any color will endure
That scrutiny can burn. 

Time is judge and result is judgment, 
No creatures can jink the punishment.
In this physical world one may elude till life, 
But in natural dynasty one is punished is rife.

We know each action has equal reaction, 
Time declares the enactment of the faction.
Malefactor may dodge the people's eye, 
But he or she can't evade the action reply.

Persons have to enjoy the fruits they earn, 
Time does judge in time we should learn.
A person has to tell several lies to hide a truth, 
But the judgment of Time reveals the sooth.

We see some are poor and some are rich, 
It is the decision of Time in past life action each.
In a computer we find works of software, 
They automatically judge and receive in care.

So also Karma (action)  of human has been fixed, 
As per the action the consequence is affixed.
So we should have moral actions with full care, 

A ball will bounce; but less and less.  It's not
A light-hearted thing, resents its own resilience.
Falling is what it loves, and the earth falls
So in our hearts from brilliance, 
Settles and is forgot.
It takes a sky-blue juggler with five red balls

To shake our gravity up.  Whee, in the air 
The balls roll around, wheel on his wheeling hands, 
Learning the ways of lightness, alter to spheres
Grazing his finger ends, 
Cling to their courses there, 
Swinging a small heaven about his ears.

But a heaven is easier made of nothing at all 
Than the earth regained, and still and sole within
The spin of worlds, with a gesture sure and noble
He reels that heaven in, 
Landing it ball by ball, 
And trades it all for a broom, a plate, a table.

Oh, on his toe the table is turning, the broom's 
Balancing up on his nose, and the plate whirls 
On the tip of the broom!  Damn, what a show, we cry: 
The boys stamp, and the girls
Shriek, and the drum booms
And all come down, and he bows and says good-bye.

If the juggler is tired now, if the broom stands
In the dust again, if the table starts to drop
Through the daily dark again, and though the plate
Lies flat on the table top,
For him we batter our hands
Who has won for once over the world's weight. 

I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day--
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl. 

So I love ya, 
do you care? 
Do ya worry
when I'm not there? 

Would ya kiss me
if I were bad? 
Would ya hug me
when I'm sad? 

So, I love ya
and I care, 
and I worry
When I'm not there.

I would kiss ya
when you're bad, 
and I'd hug ya
when you're sad.



I rode one evening with Count Maddalo 
    Upon the bank of land which breaks the flow
    Of Adria towards Venice: a bare strand
    Of hillocks, heap'd from ever-shifting sand,
    Matted with thistles and amphibious weeds,
    Such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds,
    Is this; an uninhabited sea-side,
    Which the lone fisher, when his nets are dried,
    Abandons; and no other object breaks
  The waste, but one dwarf tree and some few stakes
  Broken and unrepair'd, and the tide makes
  A narrow space of level sand thereon,
  Where 'twas our wont to ride while day went down.
  This ride was my delight. I love all waste
  And solitary places; where we taste
  The pleasure of believing what we see
  Is boundless, as we wish our souls to be:
  And such was this wide ocean, and this shore
  More barren than its billows; and yet more
  Than all, with a remember'd friend I love
  To ride as then I rode; for the winds drove
  The living spray along the sunny air
  Into our faces; the blue heavens were bare,
  Stripp'd to their depths by the awakening north;
  And, from the waves, sound like delight broke forth
  Harmonizing with solitude, and sent
  Into our hearts aereal merriment.
  So, as we rode, we talk'd; and the swift thought,
  Winging itself with laughter, linger'd not,
  But flew from brain to brain--such glee was ours,
  Charg'd with light memories of remember'd hours,
  None slow enough for sadness: till we came
  Homeward, which always makes the spirit tame.
  This day had been cheerful but cold, and now
  The sun was sinking, and the wind also.
  Our talk grew somewhat serious, as may be
  Talk interrupted with such raillery
  As mocks itself, because it cannot scorn
  The thoughts it would extinguish: 'twas forlorn,
  Yet pleasing, such as once, so poets tell,
  The devils held within the dales of Hell
  Of all that earth has been or yet may be,
  All that vain men imagine or believe,
  Or hope can paint or suffering may achieve,
  We descanted, and I (for ever still
  Is it not wise to make the best of ill?)
  Argu'd against despondency, but pride
  Made my companion take the darker side.
  The sense that he was greater than his kind
  Had struck, methinks, his eagle spirit blind
  By gazing on its own exceeding light.
  Meanwhile the sun paus'd ere it should alight,
  Over the horizon of the mountains--Oh,
  How beautiful is sunset, when the glow
  Of Heaven descends upon a land like thee,
  Thou Paradise of exiles, Italy!
  Thy mountains, seas, and vineyards, and the towers
  Of cities they encircle! It was ours
    To stand on thee, beholding it: and then,
  Just where we had dismounted, the Count's men
  Were waiting for us with the gondola.
  As those who pause on some delightful way
  Though bent on pleasant pilgrimage, we stood
  Looking upon the evening, and the flood
  Which lay between the city and the shore,
  Pav'd with the image of the sky. . The hoar
  And aery Alps towards the North appear'd
  Through mist, an heaven-sustaining bulwark rear'd
  Between the East and West; and half the sky
  Was roof'd with clouds of rich emblazonry
  Dark purple at the zenith, which still grew
  Down the steep West into a wondrous hue
  Brighter than burning gold, even to the rent
  Where the swift sun yet paus'd in his descent
  Among the many-folded hills: they were
  Those famous Euganean hills, which bear,
  As seen from Lido thro' the harbour piles,
  The likeness of a clump of peaked isles--
  And then--as if the Earth and Sea had been
  Dissolv'd into one lake of fire, were seen
  Those mountains towering as from waves of flame
  Around the vaporous sun, from which there came
  The inmost purple spirit of light, and made
  Their very peaks transparent. "Ere it fade,"
  Said my companion, "I will show you soon
  A better station"--so, o'er the lagune
  We glided; and from that funereal bark
  I lean'd, and saw the city, and could mark
  How from their many isles, in evening's gleam,
  Its temples and its palaces did seem
  Like fabrics of enchantment pil'd to Heaven.
  I was about to speak, when--"We are even
  Now at the point I meant," said Maddalo,
  And bade the gondolieri cease to row.
  "Look, Julian, on the west, and listen well
  If you hear not a deep and heavy bell

"
  I look'd, and saw between us and the sun
  A building on an island; such a one
  As age to age might add, for uses vile,
  A windowless, deform'd and dreary pile;
  And on the top an open tower, where hung
  A bell, which in the radiance sway'd and swung;
  We could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue:
  The broad sun sunk behind it, and it toll'd
  In strong and black relief. "What we behold
  Shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower,"
  Said Maddalo, "and ever at this hour
  Those who may cross the water, hear that bell
  Which calls the maniacs, each one from his cell,
  To vespers

" "As much skill as need to pray
  In thanks or hope for their dark lot have they
  To their stern Maker," I replied. "O ho!
  You talk as in years past," said Maddalo.
  " 'Tis strange men change not. You were ever still
  A wolf for the meek lambs--if you can't swim
  Beware of Providence

" I look'd on him,
  But the gay smile had faded in his eye.
  "And such," he cried, "is our mortality,
  And this must be the emblem and the sign
  Of what should be eternal and divine!
  And like that black and dreary bell, the soul,
  Hung in a heaven-illumin'd tower, must toll
  Our thoughts and our desires to meet below
  Round the rent heart and pray--as madmen do
  For what? they know not--till the night of death,
  As sunset that strange vision, severeth
  Our memory from itself, and us from all
  We sought and yet were baffled

" I recall
  The sense of what he said, although I mar
  The force of his expressions. The broad star
  Of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill,
  And the black bell became invisible,
  And the red tower look'd gray, and all between
  The churches, ships and palaces were seen
  Huddled in gloom;--into the purple sea
  The orange hues of heaven sunk silently.
  We hardly spoke, and soon the gondola
  Convey'd me to my lodgings by the way.

    The following morn was rainy, cold and dim:
  Ere Maddalo arose, I call'd on him,
  And whilst I waited with his child I play'd;
  A lovelier toy sweet Nature never made,
  A serious, subtle, wild, yet gentle being,
  Graceful without design and unforeseeing,
  With eyes--Oh speak not of her eyes!--which seem
  Twin mirrors of Italian Heaven, yet gleam
  With such deep meaning, as we never see
  But in the human countenance: with me
  She was a special favourite: I had nurs'd
  Her fine and feeble limbs when she came first
  To this bleak world; and she yet seem'd to know
  On second sight her ancient playfellow,
  Less chang'd than she was by six months or so;
  For after her first shyness was worn out
  We sate there, rolling billiard balls about,
  When the Count enter'd. Salutations past--
  "The word you spoke last night might well have cast
  A darkness on my spirit--if man be
  The passive thing you say, I should not see
  Much harm in the religions and old saws
  (Though I may never own such leaden laws)
  Which break a teachless nature to the yoke:
  Mine is another faith"--thus much I spoke
  And noting he replied not, added: "See
  This lovely child, blithe, innocent and free;
  She spends a happy time with little care,
  While we to such sick thoughts subjected are
  As came on you last night. It is our will
  That thus enchains us to permitted ill.
  We might be otherwise. We might be all
  We dream of happy, high, majestical.
  Where is the love, beauty, and truth we seek
  But in our mind? and if we were not weak
  Should we be less in deed than in desire?"
  "Ay, if we were not weak--and we aspire
  How vainly to be strong!" said Maddalo:
  "You talk Utopia

" "It remains to know,"
  I then rejoin'd, "and those who try may find
  How strong the chains are which our spirit bind;
  Brittle perchance as straw. . We are assur'd
  Much may be conquer'd, much may be endur'd,
  Of what degrades and crushes us. We know
  That we have power over ourselves to do
  And suffer--what, we know not till we try;
  But something nobler than to live and die:
  So taught those kings of old philosophy
  Who reign'd, before Religion made men blind;
  And those who suffer with their suffering kind
  Yet feel their faith, religion

" "My dear friend,"
  Said Maddalo, "my judgement will not bend
  To your opinion, though I think you might
  Make such a system refutation-tight
  As far as words go. I knew one like you
  Who to this city came some months ago,
  With whom I argu'd in this sort, and he
  Is now gone mad--and so he answer'd me--
  Poor fellow! but if you would like to go
  We'll visit him, and his wild talk will show
  How vain are such aspiring theories

"
  "I hope to prove the induction otherwise,
  And that a want of that true theory, still,
  Which seeks a 'soul of goodness' in things ill
  Or in himself or others, has thus bow'd
  His being. There are some by nature proud,
  Who patient in all else demand but this--
  To love and be belov'd with gentleness;
  And being scorn'd, what wonder if they die
  Some living death? this is not destiny
  But man's own wilful ill


      As thus I spoke
  Servants announc'd the gondola, and we
  Through the fast-falling rain and high-wrought sea
  Sail'd to the island where the madhouse stands. 

Things impolitic and dangerous:
praise for Greek ideals,
supernatural magic, visits to pagan temples.
Enthusiasm for the ancient gods.
Frequent talks with Chrysanthios.
Speculation with Maximus, the astute philosopher.
And look what's happened. Gallos is extremely worried.
Konstantios has become suspicious.
Julian's advisors weren't at all prudent.
The matter, says Mardonios, has gone too far,
the talk it has aroused must be stopped at all cost.—
So Julian goes to the church at Nicomedia,
a lector again, and there
with deep reverence he reads out loud

"Observing, then, that there is great contempt for the gods
among us"—he says in his solemn way.
Contempt. But what did he expect?
Let him organize religion as much as he liked,
write to the High Priest of Galatia as much as he liked,
or to others of his kind, inciting them, giving instructions.
But even so they couldn't play
with a new religious system,
ludicrous in both theory and application.
They were, after all, Greeks. Nothing in excess, Augustus. 

She has doe’s eyes
A shy gaze
She looks like the Madonna
A sad face
But wait until she breaks into a smile
Suddenly she is sunshine! 
And when she laughs
A picture of bliss
You have to see her, hear her
I insist! 

When she sings
She sounds so heavenly
(If I were a man
I’d ask her to marry me!)           

She turns poetry into song, blessed is her art
The tone of her guitar bright like diamond stars
And when she sings, her voice - mellifluous
Her soul-searching songs, naked like the truth

She is someone I hope one day to become
To be as grateful as the one He called 
"Julianne "

UHow did the party go in Portman Square?
     I cannot tell you; Juliet was not there.

     And how did Lady Gaster's party go?
     Juliet was next me and I do not know. 

I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
I'll call them back again to comfort me;--
Nurse!--What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.--
Come, vial.--
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married, then, to-morrow morning?--
No, No!--this shall forbid it:--lie thou there.--
What if it be a poison, which the friar
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is: and yet methinks it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man:--
I will not entertain so bad a thought.--
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,--
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where, for this many hundred years, the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking,--what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad;--
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all these hideous fears?
And madly play with my forefathers' joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?--
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point:--stay, Tybalt, stay!--
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

'Twas Jack-o'-Winter hailed it first,
But now more timid angels sing,
For what dull ear can fail to hear
Afar the fluting of the Spring?

In all free spaces of the land
A sightless flame is flickering;
Through every vein it leaps amain,
The fiery miracle of Spring.

A music ranging in the air,
A lambent light in everything;
O sweet, my sweet, the subtle heat,
The dancing light of Love and Spring

Houston we have landed
It is one small step, 
To land on the moon in this decade, 
Just as JFK promised.

Not because it was easy
But because it was hard, 
That is what he said, 
And that is what we did! 

The only problem was since those words
Were said our country had changed.
Gone are JFK, RFK, and MLK
Gone is LBJ, 
Now Nixon is the one, 
But objective remained the same
To land on the moon
No matter what the cost

On this summer day in We all came a little closer together
As we saw
The first man walk on the moon.

Now we may find
That he didn't walk on the moon at all.

A Government that lies about a break in
Could they tell a story about something else? 
Now as we look up towards the moon, 
Let us remember that special day
When are attention was directed to man who walked on the moon.

July the Eagle had landed
Now the question is where did in land?
Let us assume
we're all doing our best
as we understand it, 

and even those who feel
they can put one over
on Existence, 

the best 
they can do
is proceed from that assumption
until they have to abandon it
as a skeleton that doesn't support
the the weight of the meat 
of real life.

Our best then includes
the possibility of being stuck, 
spinning metaphysical
wheels for a long time, 

because we are all complex
blends of qualities and may not
have a particular
tool in our toolbox.

We're all such strange birds! 
Everyone's heard about
the Nazi officers
who would weep at romantic music, 

or there might be
a shy person
with the inner
strength of a lion, 
and no way to release it
except through heroic endurance.

Given all this, 
I'm thinking about repetition: 

insanity, say my step friends, 
is doing the same thing
and expecting different results.

But do we ever really
do the same thing twice? 
And maybe doing the same thing
on a 
cloudy day
will bring a different outcome.

Then there's the possibility
that each apparent repetition
digs down a little deeper
into the bedrock of what's there.

I don't know
about any of this: 
'living out' a problem 
means
you haven't a clue.


You might say
this poem is my philosophy, 
and this part is the footnote.

I remember when I was young, 
how most of the world
seemed to believe
you live a few decades, 
maybe six or seven, then die
and face Eternal Judgment, 

and so it followed
that you'd better get it right! 

I'm stunned every time I realize
many people still believe all that, 
still wear that tight, 
tight collar on their lives.

There are reasons
for that, too, 

but what a relief it was
to learn we are not
one-shot stabs in the dark, 

but rivers whose destiny
is to reach the Ocean, 

and all the crazy
meanderings, 
all our thousands of adventures, 
all the times we go to sleep 
and wake up in a new body
ready and full of energy
for a whole new round, 

the river includes all that, 
and its current is 
taking us downstream, 
and all we really have to do
is relax and let it.

At least it helps me to think about my son 
a Leo/born to us 
(Aries and Cancer) some 
sixteen years ago 
in St. John’s Hospital next to the Long Island 
Railroad tracks 
Atlantic Avenue/Brooklyn 
New York 

at dawn 

which facts 
do not really prepare you 
(do they) 

for him 

angry 
serious 
and running through the darkness with his own 

becoming light


The continent's a tamed ox, with all its mountains,
Powerful and servile; here is for plowland, here is
     for park and playground, this helpless
Cataract for power; it lies behind us at heel
All docile between this ocean and the other. If
     flood troubles the lowlands, or earthquake
Cracks walls, it is only a slave's blunder or the
     natural
Shudder of a new made slave. Therefore we happy
     masters about the solstice
Light bonfires on the shore and celebrate our power.
The bay's necklaced with fire, the bombs make crystal
     fountains in the air, the rockets
Shower swan's-neck over the night water. . I
     imagined
The stars drew apart a little as if from troublesome
     children, coldly compassionate;
But the ocean neither seemed astonished nor in awe:
If this had been the little sea that Xerxes whipped,
     how it would have feared us.




The stiff spokes of this wheel 
touch the sore spots of the earth.  

On the Potomac, swan-white 
power launches keep breasting the sulphurous wave.  

Otters slide and dive and slick back their hair, 
raccoons clean their meat in the creek.  

On the circles, green statues ride like South American 
liberators above the breeding vegetation—  

prongs and spearheads of some equatorial 
backland that will inherit the globe.  

The elect, the elected . . . they come here bright as dimes, 
and die dishevelled and soft.  

We cannot name their names, or number their dates— 
circle on circle, like rings on a tree—  

but we wish the river had another shore, 
some further range of delectable mountains,  

distant hills powdered blue as a girl's eyelid. 
It seems the least little shove would land us there,  

that only the slightest repugnance of our bodies 
we no longer control could drag us back. 

I saw a little elephant standing in my garden,
I said 'You don't belong in here', he said 'I beg you pardon?',
I said 'This place is England, what are you doing here?',
He said 'Ah, then I must be lost' and then 'Oh dear, oh dear'.

'I should be back in Africa, on Saranghetti's Plain',
'Pray, where is the nearest station where I can catch a train?'.
He caught the bus to Finchley and then to Mincing lane,
And over the Embankment, where he got lost, again.

The police they put him in a cell, but it was far too small,
So they tied him to a lampost and he slept against the wall.
But as the policemen lay sleeping by the twinkling light of dawn,
The lampost and the wall were there, but the elephant was gone!

So if you see an elephant, in a Jumbo Jet,
You can be sure that Africa's the place he's trying to get

When our cars touched
When you lifted the hood of mine
To see the intimate workings underneath,
When we were bound together
By a pulse of pure energy,
When my car like the princess
In the tale woke with a start, 
I thought why not ride the rest of the way together.

You can dream, everyone can dream, 
to touch the sky, to see the moon's gleam.
You can dream, everyone can dream, 
to be with the one you love, walking together on the same stream.

You cab jump up very high, 
to make your dreams touch the sky, 
just stop acting like a grown man, 
change that look on your face that looks so shy! , 
and don't even ask me how? ! or why? ! , 
just don't forget that you're an ordinary human.

Why are you saying ' I don't cry ', 
even you cry when your people die, 

don't give a due care to the people around you, 
just fly with your beautiful butterfly, 
and don't say it's a pie in the sky, 
cuz the pie is made to be eaten, not to fly.
I gave you my spell of joy, and it's only for you, 
so shall we fly? ! Or you're gonna say good bye? !


'Now summer is in flower and natures hum 
Is never silent round her sultry bloom 
Insects as small as dust are never done 
Wi' glittering dance and reeling in the sun 
And green wood fly and blossom haunting bee 
Are never weary of their melody 
Round field hedge now flowers in full glory twine 
Large bindweed bells wild hop and streakd woodbine 
That lift athirst their slender throated flowers 
Agape for dew falls and for honey showers 
These round each bush in sweet disorder run 
And spread their wild hues to the sultry sun.

'Out at Woodruff Place--afar
From the city's glare and jar,
With the leafy trees, instead
Of the awnings, overhead;
With the shadows cool and sweet,
For the fever of the street;
With the silence, like a prayer,
Breathing round us everywhere.

Gracious anchorage, at last,
From the billows of the vast
Tide of life that comes and goes,
Whence and where nobody knows--
Moving, like a skeptic's thought,
Out of nowhere into naught.
Touch and tame us with thy grace,
Placid calm of Woodruff Place!

Weave a wreath of beechen leaves
For the brow that throbs and grieves
O'er the ledger, bloody-lined,
'Neath the sun-struck window-blind!
Send the breath of woodland bloom
Through the sick man's prison room,
Till his old farm-home shall swim
Sweet in mind to hearten him!

Out at Woodruff Place the Muse
Dips her sandal in the dews,
Sacredly as night and dawn
Baptize lilied grove and lawn:
Woody path, or paven way--
She doth haunt them night and day,--
Sun or moonlight through the trees,
To her eyes, are melodies.

Swinging lanterns, twinkling clear
Through night-scenes, are songs to her--
Tinted lilts and choiring hues,
Blent with children's glad halloos;
Then belated lays that fade
Into midnight's serenade--
Vine-like words and zithern-strings
Twined through ali her slumberings.

Blessed be each hearthstone set
Neighboring the violet!
Blessed every rooftree prayed
Over by the beech's shadel
Blessed doorway, opening where
We may look on Nature--there
Hand to hand and face to face--
Storied realm, or Woodruff Place. 

On the scale of stupidity, as far as insects go
June bugs are the most obtuse creatures that I know
They are far less graceful than flying hippopotami
Nary a one surviving to see the month of July
At night I sit inside with my reading lamp turned on
As they bounce off of my windows (My conclusion is foregone) 
In mornings light, outside my room, I see the repercussions
Two dozen lying on their backs, all dead from concussions


This is for June n' all the Summers it brings
 Wind chasing bells of a Church steeple ring 
 Olde songs of wedlock over top hat, an' lace
 As June passes torch. . to July's scarlet face 

 Grown trees, full jackets of multi-hue green 
 The last pink magnolia leaf still can be seen 
 Ther's a breeze in the air that carries a scent
 Of sweet honeysuckle.   

fresh efflorescence

 Night casts its chill.  

yet June has its motive
 A bright ardent globe.  a lovers sweet votive
 Moonlight romance, 'neath a nautical breeze
 Make lov' in June dance like starshine on sea






Your voice, with clear location of June days,
Called me outside the window. 

You were there,
Light yet composed, as in the just soft stare
Of uncontested summer all things raise
Plainly their seeming into seamless air.

Then your love looked as simple and entire
As that picked pear you tossed me, and your face
As legible as pearskin's fleck and trace,
Which promise always wine, by mottled fire
More fatal fleshed than ever human grace.

And your gay gift—Oh when I saw it fall
Into my hands, through all that naïve light,
It seemed as blessed with truth and new delight
As must have been the first great gift of all. 



The Junes were free and full, driving through tiny
Roads, the mudguards brushing the cowparsley,
Through fields of mustard and under boldly embattled
Mays and chestnuts

Or between beeches verdurous and voluptuous
Or where broom and gorse beflagged the chalkland--
All the flare and gusto of the unenduring
Joys of a season

Now returned but I note as more appropriate
To the maturer mood impending thunder
With an indigo sky and the garden hushed except for
The treetops moving.

Then the curtains in my room blow suddenly inward,
The shrubbery rustles, birds fly heavily homeward,
The white flowers fade to nothing on the trees and rain comes
Down like a dropscene.

Now there comes catharsis, the cleansing downpour
Breaking the blossoms of our overdated fancies
Our old sentimentality and whimsicality
Loves of the morning.

Blackness at half-past eight, the night's precursor,
Clouds like falling masonry and lightning's lavish
Annunciation, the sword of the mad archangel
Flashed from the scabbard.

If only you would come and dare the crystal
Rampart of the rain and the bottomless moat of thunder,
If only now you would come I should be happy
Now if now only.

An axe angles 
                               from my neighbor's ashcan; 
It is hell's handiwork, 
                                              the wood not hickory, 
The flow of the grain 
                                           not faithfully followed. 
The shivered shaft 
                                       rises from a shellheap 
Of plastic playthings, 
                                             paper plates, 
And the sheer shards 
                                          of shattered tumblers 
That were not annealed 
                                             for the time needful. 
At the same curbside, 
                                           a cast-off cabinet 
Of wavily warped 
                                    unseasoned wood 
Waits to be trundled 
                                          in the trash-man's truck. 
Haul them off! Hide them! 
                                                 The heart winces 
For junk and gimcrack, 
                                             for jerrybuilt things 
And the men who make them 
                                                 for a little money,   
Bartering pride 
                                  like the bought boxer 
Who pulls his punches, 
                                             or the paid-off jockey   
Who in the home stretch 
                                              holds in his horse.   
Yet the things themselves 
                                                 in thoughtless honor 
Have kept composure, 
                                          like captives who would not 
Talk under torture. 
                                        Tossed from a tailgate 
Where the dump displays 
                                              its random dolmens, 
Its black barrows 
                                     and blazing valleys, 
They shall waste in the weather 
                                                          toward what they were. 
The sun shall glory 
                                        in the glitter of glass-chips, 
Foreseeing the salvage 
                                             of the prisoned sand,   
And the blistering paint 
                                                peel off in patches, 
That the good grain 
                                        be discovered again. 
Then burnt, bulldozed, 
                                             they shall all be buried   
To the depth of diamonds, 
                                                 in the making dark 
Where halt Hephaestus 
                                           keeps his hammer 
And Wayland's work 
                                       is worn away. 


A reefer a sniff eagerly sought
This one fix is their only lot

Through the puff that billows in
Forget the noise an deafening din 

Wow this dust, is one of a kind
The soaring junk its got in a bind

Gold-Fish flip an dart in the mind
The tangible world is left behind

Dazzling flashes of silver and gold
The ecstasy of it can be barely told

Only music plays, enraptures bold
In a cloudy daze it’s a life on hold

Drifting curls of potent potions 
Deathly still but heaven in motions

Crazy drift of omnipotent notions
Satanic tap to demonic devotions


(May A sun for hearts – tempered rhythm in her flares; 
The naked tan – bikini line a cry for stares; 
Gregarious green, beguiled by colours en rapport –
The park’s alive! So what’s to hanker after more? 


Children scream while parents dream their fantasies, 
Igniting under brilliance –
They think they share resilience to the
Ultraviolet hues; 
To lie displayed au naturel 
Is what they’d rather choose! 


And Helios peers at lovers in their
Heady worlds: vibrant leas to 
Roam in hand; calming seas –
Satin sand insensible as 
Water runs her ripples cross the 
Shore – so like the park, it really
Cries for very little more! 

In the garden, roses clamber for attention –
Pouting blooms, wafting scent –
Our floral monarch June’s event! 
And fingers green receive the praise
From toiling hard for coloured blaze.

Compelled, I walk the countenance of sunny June
As Mother Nature danced amok in her saloon
Of roaring life, that came of youth in early spring
And nurtured in maternal warmth beneath her wing.

 
Eyes bedewed, I mellow in a reverie 
– Hope renewed – 
As Juno saw to suckle me with 
Quintessential summer. 

Everyone’s talking about her
this last year: on their cellphones to her, 
talking about her on their TV  sofas, 
breakfast and evening celeb shows, 
at the hairdresser, in the bus queues..

‘Juno Watt? I’ve been asked to do TV-’

‘Juno Watt? I’ve got tickets to Mariah’s tour-’

‘Juno Watt? He’s proposed to me! ! ’

And the columnists are asking, 
‘Will she last through to next year? 
Will it be Celebrity Hopscotch for her
Or Celebrity Snakes and Ladders-? 
Juno Watt.. I hear she’s dating-’

She's even been paid to endorse
the products Tiger left behind: 
'Juno Watt.  our balls give your golf
more drive! '

‘Knock knock..’
‘Who’s there? ’
‘Juno Watt-’
‘Not yet..  but I suppose you’re
going to tell me-’




Once Jupiter, from out the Skies,
Beheld a thousand Temples rise;
To Jove an Altar seldom smoak'd:
What had occasion'd this Defection;
By which she won deluded Hearts.

My Arts! (says she) Great Jove, you know,
That I do ev'ry Thing below:
I make my Vot'ries dine on Plate;
I give the gilded Coach of State;
Bestow the glitt'ring Gems, that deck
The fair Lavinia's lovely Neck;
I make Novella Nature's Boast,
And raise Valeria to a Toast;
'Tis I, who give the Stupid, Taste,
(Or make the Poets lie, at least);
My fav'rite Sons, whene'er they please,
Can Palaces in Desarts raise,
Cut out Canals, make Fountains play,
And make the dreary Waste look gay;
Ev'n Vice seems Virtue by my Smiles;
I gild the Villain's gloomy Wiles,
While crowded Levees wait his Nod.

Enough--the Thunderer reply'd;
But say, whom have you satisfy'd?
These boasted Gifts are thine, I own;
But know, Content is mine alone. 


A bottle on the table.
Alcohol inside.
Lonely and waiting it seems to be
and in it you confide.

You take a drink, its bittersweet
you begin to like it more and more.
Alcoholic you better see. 
you're beginning a long-hard war.

If He really does sprinkle the earth with His love, 
Have I really done such a sin, such a crime, 
That I must serve the punishment for all time? 

Sometimes it feels my existance is wrong, 
Sometimes it feels like I'll never belong; 
Every single move that I make, step I take, 
Me here-all just a foolish mistake-

No one understands what I need
No one knows what's making me bleed
The oceans run red with the blood
Spilling over the banks in a flood

A slender knife would do the job
Revel in the gentle pulsing throb
It'll hurt much more to live than die
Now I'll wave the world goodbye.  


Someone you can talk to
A person you can share with
The one who can care with you
Somebody who will be concern with you
 
Someone who can understand you
A person that gives you attention
The one who can share your affection
Somebody who can accompany you
      in the storm and in the heaven of your life
 
Someone who can make a distance and give you space
A person with no creepiness and cleverness
The one with no strings of attachment
Somebody who is not special, but a simple
      and ordinary "angel" of your life
 

Not a best friend
Not a girlfriend
Not a boyfriend
Not a mutual friend
 
Only Just a Friend


You look at me all day
But, you don't see me at all
Can't you see I'm on the edge
Will you catch me if I fall

Just give me a single hint
To show you understand
You look, but don't see
I reach out for your hand

You don't even see me fall
Till I'm hurt and all broken
Never heard a word I said
Not a single word spoken

So now your here asking and
Begging me to hear your plea
My love left you when I fell
Now, can you hear me



Just a kiss 
of which I cannot dismiss
A kiss of beauty
A kiss of love
A kiss of you and I which make we
In bed I toss and toss
As I wish 
for your lips again
to unleash on mine

of another man 
fell slowly like a leaf 
between two bodies, 
on the bed; 
a lively yellow spot 
between white sheets.  
She worries if it is 
first autumn leaf 
of her love`s tree- 
If so, the unexpected season 
should pass soon- 
just leaves-


You subjected her to a night of hell
Hey! Did you know? 
She was just a little girl

You took her to a run down motel
Hey! Did you know? 
She was just a little girl

Now you hold her crying soul to sell
Hey! Did you know? 
She was just a little girl

When you forced her out of her shell
Hey! Did you know? 
She was just a little girl

Couldn’t you tell by her face? 
She had the smile of an angel
A virgin waiting for wedding bells

Hey! Did you know? 
You are not well? 
The only place you belong is a cell
With horrifying smells! 

Hey! Did you know? 
She is no more a little girl, they yell

He was as gentle as a lamb
He loved me more than anybody could've
But he made me cry


I was his little princess
I still would've.  
If he had'nt left me
I cried the whole night you left me daddy

I used to wonder if i was the reason
Or was it because of mommy? ? 
This I  would never know.  .
I wish i 'd find out someday

Or Is she better than us? ? ? 
Did she love  you more than we do? 
I longed for you every single day, 
Wishing that you'd come back..
 
I saw there lying on his death bed
I wished to hugg him
But he had another princess
My heart bled and broken into pieces..

I saw regret  in his eyes
Tears were falling on his cheek
It was  too damn late to turn  back
He died a broken Heart.  

'Just a little mistake, daddy'


Just A Little Star

There is nothing special about me
I forget myself sometimes
when so many others around me
shine brighter than I can

I may not be the brightest star
the last one you may see
I hope my shine inspires you
if you should notice me

In the blackness of the night
is where I can be found
somewhere in the darkness
a guiding light around

There's nothing special about me
I'm just a little star
if I'm shining brightly
it's reflecting who you are. 


hot sausage
weak noodle
change in diet
change in size
come slower or faster
shake it off
just let it drain itself
down into the filthy sink
of total stupidity


Just A prayer to read
before going to bed.  


Angles, Angles, 
from above

I`m praying for the
one I (LOVE) . 
He needs your help
oh so bad
Because the world
has made him sad
He needs your touch 
So show him LOVE
in every way

     


Just a question
to ask someone
can you Love 
some one.
Just a question
or do you 
have to Love yourself.
Just a question
people tell me you
have to Love
yourself first.

My answer is 
yes, because you
have to Love yourself, 
My answer is
if you don`t Love
yourself how do you Love others
Yes it is true
Love yourself
then you can love someone else, 
Yes it true
people have different 
ways of looking
at Love.
Right or wrong
true Love is out thier
just go look
Right or wrong
I Love myself
and I Love my boyfriend.
So go out and 
fine Love in you
and everybody around you.

Because the question is
does anybody really know
the answer to the question. 



Sorry if i disturb you
I just need someone to listen, 
Hear my supplication
And feel my emptiness.

I am tired
Of having a feeling like this
Filled with emptiness, 
Unworthy and rejected.

My friend
I want to give up
Quit everything
I can't stand no more.

Would you mind
If i cry before you, 
Don't stop me to do this
I just want to cry out loud.

I am hurting.
Since the day i was born
I never had the chance 
To feel i am worthy.


I am crossing at the crossroads
No directions
Nowhere to run
Alone.

I cry all day and night
Ask HIM
To take away my sadness
To take away my  emptiness.

My friend
Do you still want me to be your friend? 
I am a loser
I am a mistake.

Would you still lend your time with me
After hearing all these difficulties, 
Listen to my grievances
And willing to share advice. 

N. 

B Let the comment be one word and explanation to the poem
Because the poem is for one word

           * PEACE *

Face till the tip of the world
Success your ability and shade
It is more than everything and the happiness creator
Stay safe and sound, that would be ours better

It is the food and drinking stuff at all
With out it everything might be fall
It is of the entire struggles goal
It is the most interesting at whole


For disturbed hearts it made them calm
In annoyed mood it let joy come
For success and for further improvement
In our lives let it be head of our sentiment

                     * PEACE *





Another day another dollar
Just another excuse to give
Just another white lie to say
Just another fiene 
Who wants the goods
Now I got more money
More money to spend
To spend on the goods
The goods are a demand
A demand that the cops want
Want to get me for life
Hell naw they cant see me
I do my thang 
While the ride by
I get my money
As long as these fienes live
Then my pocket stays phat
Once in awhile a brave soul comes at me
But when they walk away 
I take their soul and there pide
Why
Cause a girl jus gave them the business
Nobody wants it with me
I do what i have to do
Just to survive another day
Another day another dollar


Another anticipated day has arrived
Many weeks in the planning and back of mind
But I have learned
Such days are just days
And like the before
It will be a yesterday soon enough
No need to be concerned about what I wear
No need to rehearse actions or words
No anxiety. Just wake up


There he is, crossing the road, 
very slowly, walking away from me.

I recognise his back, the way he walks, 
his smart clothes, his elegant stride.

Once we were face to face, 
united together in an embrace, 
which was so powerful, filled with such desire.

Now we are no longer face to face.
All that remains is a back view, 
a totally blank view.

Memories come flooding back, 
I feel a pain so intense, causing an emptiness within me, 
that will never go away.

And as I look towards him, 
he is suddenly engulfed by a crowd of shoppers.

A faceless body, disappearing in among other faceless bodies, 
and I can see him no more.

Thus, this moment becomes 'just another moment', woven into my heart, 
and, into the 'photo album' of my life.


I hoped to feel some relief.
Hiding my scars from everyone.
The only thing I could believe.

The wounds I won't show, 
The scars left too deep.
Bleeding my insides out.
My death is the last leap.

I thought of it many times, 
I planned it perfectly in my mind.
I've destroyed everything.
So I wouldn't leave anything behind.

But some things can't be removed, 
Some things can't be wished away.
Too difficult to let those feelings go, 
But also too painful to let them stay.

This is going on for too long now, 
These feelings rage in my chest.
Rendering me completely numb, 
And Leaving out all the rest. 


He’s older now, and kisses me shyly
His words now often tell me coyly
Though he’s getting bigger, he’s still a boy

His imagination comes alive
In colours vibrant; and football he loves
Plays like a tyrant

When he flops down besides me
And the day’s work is done
Sleepy eyes look at me, just as he was born


Just because someone says they love you today
Does not mean they will love you forever
Feelings have ways of changing
Promises have ways of breaking

Just because someone kisses you passionately
Does not mean they wont kiss someone else
Kisses are not contracts of forever and ever
Caresses do not mean always together

Just because someone touches your heart
Does not mean they understand your soul
Loving words can make you forget
All your past mistakes and regret

Just because someone makes love to your body
Does not mean that they love your mind
Passion quickly ignites a fire
Oft we confuse love and desire

Just because someone holds you in their arms
Does not mean thye will cherish and protect you
Comfort and warmth are sometimes an illusion
And when it's over all that's left is confusion


Just because my love is silent
doesn't mean it isn't present! 

Just because I stopped calling
doesn't mean I no longer find your voice charming! 

Just because I don't keep saying how much I love you 
doesn't mean that I no longer do! 

Just because I don't seem to be comfortable holding hands
doesn't mean that I don't want us to be more than just friends! 

Just because I fail to look straight into your eyes
doesn't mean I'm spinning you a web of lies! 

Just because I don't say that I miss you too
doesn't mean that my heart doesn't long for you! 


Anyways, I just wish you would stop measuring our love
from the things mentioned above, 
because love is a complex thing
it can't always be seen by the things one is or isn't doing
but, can be felt in the warm fuzzy feeling it would bring

being obsessed by incisive heartiest expressions
I am expressing to you- 'the Creator without directions' 
that you know, I am in the act of washing Myself with love.
Heart to heart, mind to mind is my first choice in this voyage
across the world.


You know, here the debate has been going on since
the beginning of human civilization that
you exist or not.
The people who has been rejecting your presence
and saying you are a delusion without any crystal clear proof.
I do not go to uphold their position
as I am with them who providing your attributes-
the indirect proofs of the creator whose artwork the universes.

I comprehend that You are the first cause
and we all the second subordinate to You.
Its your great art work
I apprehend that the universes are full of mystery
and mystical Phenomenons are smilling all over-
as much as we know
as much as we do not know.

I respect her and love her.
You know its not only carnal passion that my love directed at-
but sometime man-shaped animals are
misusing this tremendous blessing.
I apprehend that the interplay of light and shade
in relation of blessed man and woman are
truely creating wave of joy! 


It is more than twenty years ago
my Ego, my body and mind became young
by the rule of your time selected for this ours galaxy
It is your grace upon me that i need not pray for rejuvenate me
for rejoicement of union with darling whom you destined-
Who would be she I do not know.
I am pleased seeing that
people consider me as of twenty five! 
from exclusively dynamic lips misusing my youth yet
only fearing you.


You know the girls
who were oppressed or their honesty looted by man-shaped satan
and that causes their mind imprisoned by vulnerableness
and they have been getting wrong day by day
and I am afraid- they may consider singer birds are as fierce Falcon! 

I just submitting words before you-
Save innocent lives from fraudulents and make available
the not-bombastic words as well to this your poet.

  

 july where I wish to spend my retiring years. 
A land that has tall mountains 
that reach up to the sky, 
trees tall, green and noble 
that stretch across many acres of land, 
with cooling streams that flow through the heart 
of this green and pleasant land 
that lies just beyond the rainbow’s end. 
This is where this paradise starts, 
a place one day to which I’ll lose my heart. 
The people there are friendly 
and take you in with open arms. 
There one day I hope to be 
in that green and pleasant land 
that lies just beyond the rainbow’s end. 


November ust beyond the setting sun 
lies a land where green leaves grow. 
Just beyond the setting sun 
seasons different come and go. 
A warmly place 
of peace and tranquillity. 
Just beyond the setting sun 
lies a home for you and me. 
A place of no worries 
where life is idyllic 
to spawn generations to come, 
warm in the summer sun 
and cool as winter comes. 
Just beyond the setting sun 
lies a home we always wanted, 
a paradise of beauty, 
fulfilment and tranquillity. 
Just beyond the setting sun 
where our dreams come from. 
There within those pastures green 
lies our future destiny, 
just over the horizon, 
just beyond the setting sun.


July ust beyond the sunset
Someone waits for me
Just beyond the sunset
Lies my destiny
Where the purple mountains
Lie in deep tranquillity
There I’ll find the treasure
Of love eternally 

Just beyond the sunset
Waits someone so fair
Just beyond the sunset
All alone they wait there
Their hair is golden
The colour of the sand
Their eyes sparkle in the night
Like diamonds in your hand

Just beyond the sunset
Lies a home for me
Where the world is peaceful
Like a paradise should be
Just beyond the sunset
Someday is where you’ll find me



Time flies by so quickly 
almost in a blink of an eye 
and years vanish almost completely. 




take a breath 
And see my wife by my side
Her face stricken with tears
By her newfound list of fears
My sons stand shaken
Looking at me with a newfound glory

I take a breath 
and stare at a picture
of two men next to me
I don't know who they are
though I feel like I've seen them before
They might be good friends

I take a breath 
And stare at a woman next to me
Asks me if I know who she is
She is foreign but nice
She must be a nurse
I am told my disease has gotten worse
What disease


Would you like to visit to mausoleum? 
Lots of beauties say, 'Warmly welcome.'
You will stick majestic ornaments
If eyes are allowed just to glance.

Would you like to feel music of love? 
Romantic songs promise, 'Vibrate the heart.'
You will crack trace of melancholy
If ears are allowed just to be hungry.

Would you like to risk an airy maze? 
Lust of fame motivates, 'Be brave! '
You will meet nucleus of meek fragrance
If nose is allowed just to take a breath.

Would you like to taste enchanting thrill? 
Roar of heartbeat applauds, 'Wonderful female! '
You will be namby-pamby essence of bliss
If lips are allowed just to accept a kiss.

Would you like to create stunning poesy? 
Even machismo murmurs, 'Sedate Peri! '
Nib will penetrate cells of cute skin.
All you need is just call me Darling.


Just for a moment, flowers appear
on the empty, nearly-spring tree.

Just for a second, wind
through the wild thicket thorns.

Self inside self, You are nothing but me.
Self inside self, I am only You.

What we are together
will never die.

The why and how of this?
What does it matter?




Just for today I will open my eyes and thank the Universe for one more day
Just for today I will look in the mirror and find one thing I like about myself
Just for today I will smile at a stranger in the traffic
Just for today I will greet someone I don't particularly like - and mean it
Just for today I will sing a song and not care if I am off key or who hears
Just for today I will do something I want to do, no matter what anyone else thinks
Just for today I will give someone a word of affirmation - not because I have to, but because I want to
Just for today I will be grateful for who I have in my life, not what I have
Just for today I will say a sincere thank you if I receive a compliment and not joke it away
Just for today I will do each task to the best of my ability
Just for today I will hug someone
Just for today I will tell someone I love that I love them
Just for today I will appreciate having a job, a bed and food
Just for today I will appreciate the beautiful colours of the sunset
Just for today I will be grateful for one more day that was undeserved, one more day that was lived to the full, one more day to love and be loved, one more day to be me



Sometimes the words of a stranger
Can comfort when you are down
Their hands stretch out to help you
From many miles away
They are more like friends
Than those that you meet everyday
They care and they comfort
This sad and distant soul
You wish you could reach out and hug them
But that is impossible to do
Instead, you write a poem
And say this one is just for you


'Just get over it, ' they say
I wish I could find a way
Living with it day by day
Memories won't go away

Medication helps to sway
Many feelings of dismay
But they do fail to decay
The loss that one does survey


I will share with you,

I will freely give

make not paying for these things a must, 
i will help you build your house,

i will help you to survive; 
make you want to be alive for free., ., , 
then naturally, 
you will do the same for me!

There is one thing that ought to be taught in all the colleges,
Which is that people ought to be taught not to go around always making apologies.
I don't mean the kind of apologies people make when they run over you or borrow five dollars or step on your feet,
Because I think that is sort of sweet;
No, I object to one kind of apology alone,
Which is when people spend their time and yours apologizing for everything they own.
You go to their house for a meal,
And they apologize because the anchovies aren't caviar or the partridge is veal;
They apologize privately for the crudeness of the other guests,
And they apologize publicly for their wife's housekeeping or their husband's jests;
If they give you a book by Dickens they apologize because it isn't by Scott,
And if they take you to the theater, they apologize for the acting and the dialogue and the plot;
They contain more milk of human kindness than the most capacious diary can,
But if you are from out of town they apologize for everything local and if you are a foreigner they apologize for everything American.
I dread these apologizers even as I am depicting them,
I shudder as I think of the hours that must be spend in contradicting them,
Because you are very rude if you let them emerge from an argument victorious,
And when they say something of theirs is awful, it is your duty to convince them politely that it is magnificent and glorious,
And what particularly bores me with them,
Is that half the time you have to politely contradict them when you rudely agree with them,
So I think there is one rule every host and hostess ought to keep with the comb and nail file and bicarbonate and aromatic spirits on a handy shelf,
Which is don't spoil the denouement by telling the guests everything is terrible, but let them have the thrill of finding it out for themselves. 


My eyes cry tears like rain
My mind rolls like the thunder
My feelings flash like the lightning
I fall like the rain onto the ground
You never know where I'll hit next
Run outside with me and dance
Sometimes I'm needed, though not wanted
And sometimes I'm wanted, but not needed
I'm all over the place
Never able to be tamed
I can be captured, but I will escape
I can appear when the sun is shining
But I prefer when the clouds are flying
I love to surprise people
Appear in the middle of the night
Then take off in flight
Before anyone can find me


There are two hundred ninety two fonts on my computer	
I use just one

There are dozens of spoons in my utensil drawer
I eat with just one

There are scores of different routes to the post office
I travel just one

There are plenty of reasons to be humble and kind
I need just one

There are over seven billion people on this planet
And
I am just one


Bang, bang bullets, goes the gun.
Hurry, hurry as you run.
Close your eyes in a frightful panic, 
bustling around you, everones frantic.
How we need you, need you here.
Footsteps, footsteps getting close, 
Patter, patter like a ghost.
You bring your arms around your head, 
just one bullet,


Read her mind
what do you see? 
a world of the forgotten
uncared for, hated
she hates herself
because of them
nobody to help her
nobody to care
death she wishes
would come so soon
to take her into the embrance
of her eternal bed
her coffin, 
hugging her tightly
ensuring safty
saftey from their cruel words
from the living
she is happy
in the bed of death
to remain there forever
her only wish
her eternal happiness
another wish
to be loved
to have sombody who cared
help her be happy
forever loved, forever happy
one moment of love
one moment o happiness
she would give her life for
her life gone
for just one moment of happiness


I have heard it said, 'You only live once.
But if you do it right.  

once is enough'
I hope that's not true. I'd surely like
to do it again. Next time.  

I'll try
to do it right.


I feel like I been working like a dog. 
It's funny cus I haven't done 
anything the whole day, 
but sit lazily on this chair. 
Its the weather, there's so much pressure 
Its draggin me around 
I really hate it. 
September and April are the worst months of the year 
transition months 
I wish i could sleep those two months, 
you know, writing a notice that goes like, 
'wake me up when October comes' and 
sleep all the way through September. 
The same goes for April, but change the October to May. 
The internet connection is awfully lazy today. 
Maybe it is the weather again. 
It's not worth downloading anything during the day 
Funny how the weather is ruining everything. 
I feel like doing something else 
besides sitting on the computer 
and writing this. 
The weather is again to blame. 


There’s a day that lingers in my mind
and I can still taste the gritty dust 
blowing hot on a summer day


I had stopped for gas at a truck stop, 
nowhere important, 
just going from here to there
but there he was
by the side of the road
and walking toward me 
in run down leather boots
the wind in his hair
the sun on his face
and squinting through ice blue eyes

When he caught me staring
he touched a finger to the hat
cocked slightly to one side
and threw me a wink 
and then a crooked smile

He was tall
the long legs 
propelling him in bowed strides 
that reinvented the swaggery strut
and as he passed by 
my eyes were drawn to the tight jeans
and the perfect ass that filled them

He wasn’t Marlboro Man handsome
but rugged and muscular
and perfectly packaged in a plaid shirt 
with little pearl snaps
and rolled up sleeves

my emotions ran high 
and I’ll never forget that day
by the side of the road
when I fell in lust 
with a stranger I never met, 
someone just passing through


a howling in the woods
the twinkle in the stars
like butterflies sent to lovers
in sealed mason jars


How many times do you give up? 
Hours of struggling with merely one phrase
Sometimes it is only one word that thwarts
No idea can be perfectly translated
Not from essence of self to paper
Yes, writhe and thrash to refine
Aspire to make it just right
It may take a lifetime
So just write


Driving along in her bread truck early one morn
With everything going exactly as norm
Margaret spied a lone wheel on the left trundling ahead
Turned to her brother, the newspaper he read
 
Hey look at this, someone must've lost a wheel
Jack looked up quickly, it almost didn't seem real
Suddenly her truck swerved sharply to the right
She grabbed hold of the steering with all of her might
 
Uh-oh, it's our wheel, she suddenly realized
Then saw a cyclist cycling towards her, very surprised
At the sight of a lone wheel and a truck bearing down
He quickly decided to turn his bike around
 
Margaret had problems of her own on which to ponder
The truck had veered off the road into the thick bush yonder
Jack's newspaper had slipped from right out of his hands
The news of the day abruptly seemed old and bland
 
Luckily the truck stopped a paper's breadth from a huge tree
Although Margaret's fingers from the wheel she couldn't prise free
But she had to recover quickly for a replacement truck soon arrived
And she and her brother continued on with their drive
 
Fifteen years later Margaret was once again driving
The day after her husband had fixed up her brakes' lining
When the familiar image of a lone wheel up ahead she sighted
So she quickly prepared to keep her car righted
 
While keeping an eye on her adventuresome wheel
Which crossed three lanes of traffic and homed into an automobile
Dealership at the top of a very steep drive
It spun around and settled, safe and alive
 
Margaret herself, followed the same track
Of her errant wheel, in order to bring it back
After she returned, a man kindly stopped his car to say
That her wheel nuts had fallen off about metres away
 
So she walked back to retrieve them, then reattached the wheel
She didn't see the need to make it a big deal
But when she got home, there was plenty to say
To her husband, who had enlivened her day
 
Oh no he protested, I turned those nuts tight
A thief must have come in the middle of the night
To steal the wheel but been disturbed half way through
You know I never would have left those nuts askew



 - a slice of sun-ray 
with the winter-butter 
my today's awaking 
phenomenal break first 
from last sleep 
together with blanket 
the arrogant hypothesis 
dream cooked with delight 
nudity of angels guillotined skulls 
made me warm to think 
heaven distributors 
soon would be the jobless seeker 
of bread and shelter 
just as we in the same line
through the journey to good-bye earth 

hypothesis dream bred every night 
but first break not the same 
as it was today 
so I salute my drink
which did not give 
much brutality 
to become a swine
for such wild consciousless sleep 
generally people gathers 
to peep death as a whole! 



My hair, clothes and body are soaking wet
Night had fallen after a sultry day
The air in my room was stagnant and thick
But a heavy rain was dropping forcefully outside
Out I went, into the drenching darkness
The first drops were icy against my back
But in seconds, I was sodden and inured
Water flowing down my forehead
Washed the day’s sweat into my eyes
 The sound of the deluge
drumming upon oak leaves
Drowned out the distant thunder
I stood, motionless, for over ten minutes
Becoming one with the downpour
I seldom feel more alive
Than when I’m just standing in the rain


Are you tense, 
Are you worn out, 
Are your nerves on end, 
Can you not remember where you began! 

If this is your problem, 
The answer is take life easy. 

No, wait why don't you try: 
Medicate, 
Get a good health plan, 
See a doctor, 
Take up an exercise program, 
Hire a trainer, 
Change your job. 

Or maybe, just maybe simple solution is 
Just take a vacation! 



 in the darkness of night when there is too silence
i have one pray to god just take you in right way

in the crowd of people when voices are high
i have one pray to god just take you in right way

in the rainy day when thunder is in sky
i have one pray to god just take you in right way

when happens are too much and i am feeling lonely
i  have one pray to god just take you in right way

when good peoples are less and bad are much
i have one pray to god just take you in right way


Got up on a cool morning. Leaned out a window.
No cloud, no wind. Air that flowers held
for awhile. Some dove somewhere.

Been on probation most of my life. And
the rest of my life been condemned. So these moments
count for a lot--peace, you know.

Let the bucket of memory down into the well,
bring it up. Cool, cool minutes. No one
stirring, no plans. Just being there.

This is what the whole thing is about. 



Down I go
To rise again
As river water I flow
To comfort the bank not with blow

I fall victim
Then rush to Him
With prayers
And remember

I know 
Time may pass or go
But shall trouble more
I bow head therefore

Not bad
If in despair I feel sad
That can be taken care off
When I remember last laugh 

Who wants to remain? 
In same state with pain
Something must be done to read
To ward off and conveniently lead

So better keep head high 
Wait for next days light 
New beginning may be good
This is just thought as food


Just to be good--
This is enough--enough!
O we who find sin's billows wild and rough,
Do we not feel how more than any gold
Would be the blameless life we led of old
While yet our lips knew but a mother's kiss?
Ah! though we miss
All else but this,
To be good is enough!

It is enough--
Enough--just to be good!
To lift our hearts where they are understood;
To let the thirst for worldly power and place
With the glad lips our mothers used to kiss.
Ah! though we miss
All else but this,
To be good is enough

You say I am weak? ! 
You would be weak too if
you've been through the things
that I've been through
I can take the pains of life
but I am only human
and humans can only take so much
which is why I'm in the state im in
Life is just too much

You think you're strong & powerful? ? ? 
Just wait till evil whispers in your ear
It'll tell you to keep many secrets
that you do not wish to hear
You'll listen anyway 
cause of the threats that evil speaks
So you take those secrets to the grave
Then keep them with you
in your eternaty sleep.
Life is just too much


this is one of my first poems. 
I do hope to improve. 

No need to think more or remain skeptics
There are natural phenomena and basics
Sky remain high and over head
Guide us to remain firm, to look high and lead  

Every object is of high importance
Let us pray almighty and demonstrate our allegiance
It is His creation and let us have no negligence 

Everything around provides us the strength
Provide we communicate and pick the correct length
Does the tree shadow not teach us to think of variance? 
Trust on self and reasonably think of good reliance

Why do the people go for morning walk? 
Why do they prefer silence and have less talk? 
It is because morning breeze is good for health
It can’t be compensated even with enormous wealth

Moon, stars and sky have their on axis
They are part and parcel of galaxies
We are human being and part of humanism
There should be no reason for any kind of "ism" 

He is there to take care of everything
We should not pick loose leave and start something
It is in opportune time that we arrive and depart 
Only we should shed fear and have fresh start


Days also not remain same
For us to claim
Often with glory
We may feel sometimes sorry too

Nights shall offer darkness
But along with coolness
We can see vast sky
For our thoughts to fly 

Never get disheartened
And misled
Our days shall find good days again
Turning home into heaven 

Just wait and watch
And search
Mental peace
To work with ease

Never condemn
Or turn
An opportunity
That is showered on you by an almighty


I came so close to breaking down, 
so close to losing it all.
I never thought that this I'd say, 
But please catch me when I fall.

For so long I've been running away, 
afraid to face my fears.
And now you've come and picked me up, 
and wiped away my tears.

If only you could see, 
just how far I've come.
The person I used to be, 
and the person standing here.  

right now.

So could you wait a little longer, 
for the sorry I wish to say.
For only you could ever know, 
how much it hurts this way.

I thought I kept it still, 
locked up and hidden far.
And yet you come and pry my heart out, 
open to you as the sun.

Many nights you've seen me, 
at my very worst.
And yet you love me all the same, 
Filling my heart till it bursts

If only you could see, 
just how far I've come.
The person I used to be, 
and the person standing here.  

right now.



What name do I have for you? 
Certainly there is not name for you
In the sense that the stars have names
That somehow fit them. Just walking around, 
 
An object of curiosity to some, 
But you are too preoccupied
By the secret smudge in the back of your soul
To say much and wander around, 
 
Smiling to yourself and others.
It gets to be kind of lonely
But at the same time off-putting.
Counterproductive, as you realize once again
 
That the longest way is the most efficient way, 
The one that looped among islands, and
You always seemed to be traveling in a circle.
And now that the end is near
 
The segments of the trip swing open like an orange.
There is light in there and mystery and food.
Come see it.
Come not for me but it.
But if I am still there, grant that we may see each other. 


Hello 
Just wanna 
Say I love you 
Might seem 
Kinda strange 
In this day and age 
But I love you 
Just the same


It may be just war
With nothing to offer
Justice or injustice 
It is breach of trust and promise

Who will want to suffer? 
When it has nothing to offer
Except war widows and orphans
What can be left behind except pain? 

Many might have been rendered homeless? 
The world might have to see ugly face
Face the hunger and colossal losses
Still left more with humanitarian issues

Many bodies may lye scattered
Not a word about them to be uttered
It is sheer madness and joke
Houses burn with thick smoke

Who will identify bodies? 
Whether belong to men or ladies! 
Total disrespect to human being
We have seen wars and gained nothing 

Vultures may eat flashes
War may soon finish 
Nothing to look back for reasons
World at large might have lost best persons

World bodies suffer from politics
Seized with numbers and statistics
Big countries may influence their decision
Poor countries may suffer because of indecision

We may watch it as helpless game
There is no one to whom you can blame 
It may go on so long ambition remains
Countries may go in for war even if their treasure drains 

War may be necessary in extreme situation
When there may be more danger of its continuation 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki are living examples
Where we had to bury neutrality and principles

War wounds are not easy to heal
The nationals may bitterly feel
Bear grudge against nations imposing war
Then where we will end and go how far

Don't you love accounting, 
It is not an exact science, 
Some people love to count, 
Other seem to love to say no, 
If you like both accounting you will go! 

In the school business, 
No one but give you any more of this, 
Than the office in charge of business. 

This money counting persons, 
Will count every last red cent, 
Until all of the money is spent. 
They will even help you along. 

That was so nice, 
A hundred there and couple more here, 
Oh it is money, 
Who will miss it. 

The problem you see it ever since Perot, 
We have tried to run school the same a businees is run. 
Can I help it I work for Enron! 

Just for example, 
Let me explain, 
How a field trip the other for several miles, 
Cost me thousands of dollars and drove the principal insane. 

First, there was the driver, 
We paid for eight hours, 
She drove for twenty minutes and then 
Shopped for seven hours. 

Second, we paid was the gas, 
At one dollar a mile, 
I thought that would cover all of that. 

Oh no said the business office people, 
We could possible do that, 
We have to have our money accounted for better than that. 

Didn't you know it more like hundred dollars 
An mile, the real expense. 



I told them we will walk and would save time, 
We got the excercise, 
And my students improved their minds. 

Now, in the future, 
I will wait, 
And never agin make that mistake. 
In the land of numbers, 
I draw a zero, 
But to my students I want to be the hero. 

From now on, 
You will see, 
We will do all of our field trips 
By walking


A years old husband is just so happy
When the doctor told him that his wife is pregnant
Husband said: 'Nice I'll be father again! Life is just so good to me

AND that I have a good servant/driver who is so nice to us
He does handful chores and such very helpful
Whatever he does, he doesn't make a fuss
Oh, he is of that young energetic man makes us glad after all.'

Doctor said: It seems you got a wonderful servant/driver? 
Husband answered: Yes very nice one, my wife does agree
Wife said: 'Now that I'm pregnant, I'm more than happier
Honey, our driver is just a good driver, he drives me crazy nightly



Ah, love, love, love
Without boundaries
Priceless
Thrilling

The love I found
So sweet in you
Resplendent
Glorifying

In Gaudium fields
That my heart yields
Jubilantly
Invigorating

Upon your caress
Touch so heavenly
Divine
Alluring

I reached the sky
To Nirvana
In splendor
Dazzling

And our soul sways
To the music
Smoothly
Tiptoeing

In harmony to reach
The fields of Elysium
Hopefully
Unending

And my heart will beat
and breathe to your love
Endlessly
Blending



Sudden joy and deep understanding

Places of togetherness and intimacy 

All feel so real


But they are just 

Words that draw us together

A rope to hold on to

While crossing a treacherous river

Till we meet on a quiet bank


That Justice is a blind goddess
Is a thing to which we black are wise:
Her bandage hides two festering sores
That once perhaps were eyes. 

For those who reap us of thousands of grand’s
Lavish their wealth on treasures of the land
Justice often does us no right on this stand
For it gives the culprits only a helping hand


Justice is sometimes wrong
Justice is meant to be honour
Justice is sometimes strong
Justice is meant to be society’s formidable cure


With words I can create drama
With written words I cannot stammer
But Justice will do us no right in this drama
For I am called black but I got a white mama

In vain I see no reasonable sense
In this precluded abstract nonsense
And as Justice wears again its white robes
I sincerely hope that it will always accurately probe



 Across a world where all men grieve
And grieving strive the more,
The great days range like tides and leave
Our dead on every shore.
Heavy the load we undergo,
And our own hands prepare,
If we have parley with the foe,
The load our sons must bear.

Before we loose the word
That bids new worlds to birth,
Needs must we loosen first the sword
Of Justice upon earth; 
Or else all else is vain
Since life on earth began,
And the spent world sinks back again

A People and their King
Through ancient sin grown strong,
Because they feared no reckoning
Would set no bound to wrong; 
But now their hour is past,
And we who bore it find
Evil Incarnate hell at last
To answer to mankind.

For agony and spoil
Of nations beat to dust,
For poisoned air and tortured soil
And cold, commanded lust,
And every secret woe
The shuddering waters saw.
Willed and fulfilled by high and low.
Let them relearn the Low.

That when the dooms are read,
Not high nor low shall say:- 
' My haughty or my humble head
Was saved me in this day.'
That, till the end of time,
Their remnant shall recall
Their fathers old, confederate crime
Availed them not at all.

That neither schools nor priests,
Nor Kings may build again
A people with the heart of beasts
Made wise concerning men.
Whereby our dead shall sleep
In honour, unbetrayed,
And we in faith and honour keep
That peace for which they paid. 



Can justice be delayed under any circumstances? 
Numerous cases can be sighted for instances
Can that not be amounted as justice denied? 
Well, conscious should always bite if it is laid 

Constitution enshrined for liberty and freedom
Forefathers too considered and thought it as wisdom
Sacrifice made for freedom struggle should not go as waste
To live with true freedom was need of an hour and taste

Still many loop holes remain to be plugged
System is facing criticism and it is wholly bugged
Justice is sold as revealed with emergence of new facts
it is cleverly wrapped in words with simple tact

Under official ret act, nothing can be made public or revealed 
Under the oath of secrecy it is cleverly concealed
Normal man can’t dream for getting immediate relief
Loosing faith and trust as mark of disbelief

Innocents are sometimes hung for nothing
Trial summary drags on for years to prove something 
History teeters and goons rule the scene
it has been  made laughing stock which is never witnessed or seen

Conscience like things has remained on paper
Evidences or approver turn hostile and proof is tempered
Solitary examples shine and keep the system alive
Does the system require honest trial for self and to be revived? 

Politicians have corrupted and citizens too have favored
Easy ill gotten money plays part with fragrance and flavor
who would not want to become rich and famous? 
Leading lavish life with style and look so glamorous 

Death sentence can’t be implemented for simple reason
Wrong move for computation of term for person tried under treason
Still some of us praise the system and sing for liberty 
How can it grow amidst the illiteracy and poverty? 

Nothing can l change under the light and sun
we will tear it apart by making mockery and fun
Streets will have deserted look under the shadow of gun
People may seek refuge under constant fear and run

Such may be the scene in coming days
You will be caught in cross fire in strange ways
You will have no high hope in bright rays
It may be altogether different if we don’t pay (attention) 

No one should be deprived of his/her legitimate dues
System should not be meant for only few
Why is it so that only influential get scoot free
Why other have to sit recite the hymns under the tree? 

Let holy principles of justice be upheld
Let innocents be not prosecuted and held
It may or can have legitimate delay
This may send the message across and relay


Prison
Dark room
No light 
Human life breathes

Murder charge
Old age
Innocent soul
Suffers justice call 

Hard labor
To work as stone cutter
Bones crack after days work 
Real pain and eyes spark

Is this the life to suffer? 
Is this the punishment to offer? 
Prison sentence before trial
Human abuse with justice denial


Let us abandon then our gardens and go home
And sit in the sitting-room
Shall the larkspur blossom or the corn grow under this cloud?
Sour to the fruitful seed
Is the cold earth under this cloud,
Fostering quack and weed, we have marched upon but cannot
conquer;
We have bent the blades of our hoes against the stalks of them.

Let us go home, and sit in the sitting room.
Not in our day
Shall the cloud go over and the sun rise as before,
Beneficent upon us
Out of the glittering bay,
And the warm winds be blown inward from the sea
Moving the blades of corn
With a peaceful sound.

Forlorn, forlorn,
Stands the blue hay-rack by the empty mow.
And the petals drop to the ground,
Leaving the tree unfruited.
The sun that warmed our stooping backs and withered the weed
uprooted—
We shall not feel it again.
We shall die in darkness, and be buried in the rain.

What from the splendid dead
We have inherited —
Furrows sweet to the grain, and the weed subdued —
See now the slug and the mildew plunder.
Evil does overwhelm
The larkspur and the corn;
We have seen them go under.

Let us sit here, sit still,
Here in the sitting-room until we die;
At the step of Death on the walk, rise and go;
Leaving to our children's children the beautiful doorway,
And this elm,
And a blighted earth to till
With a broken hoe. 


Laws are after all laws
With lot many lacuna and flaws
As counter system works
It is battle with clever words

"We, in the name of lord" lawyers argue
The accused stand silently in queue
The battle is fought without army
The client is in hurry and unhappy

No poor can afford such battle
He has no guts to carry on struggle
So they avoid such wrangle
It is as good as adding to more troubles

We hear conflicting reports in public
"The justice is sold" says alcoholic
No one believes his words
We have to wait only and look forwards

The cases are dragged on for years
This creates lots of agony and fear
Whole is life is spent in waiting
You get extension with more dating

Drug carriers and mafias invite
Most of the time to fight
Politicians carry importance
Their cases are heard at once


"Justice delayed is justice denied"
The sentence is alright but hopes are bellied 
Justice if for rich and for those who can afford
You just take oath to speak right word"Juwita" meaning my girl
Darling little girl in home as diamond and pearl
I wonder to look at her and feel good
She is tonic for me and energy food 

I speak now on behalf of intelligent woman
Employed as an agent and really fighting along man 
Totally devoted and fir brand never expected
Life at risk when pressed into service to be acted

She is having undercover name as consultant 
Ready to serve for country as an agent
What she has committed in return and got
All ventures made successful and valiantly fought

How long will she continue as fighter woman? 
She has lively feeling in her as female
But no she has been trained as male counter part
All the time armed with weapons and ready to depart

I love her dare devil approach and style
She has been influenced by me meanwhile
I try to bring her in my area and poke
She smells rat and refuse to come under smoke

"I cry many times in nights" she adds to clarify
"When all women wear ornaments "I fight 
How will I go for any man and satisfy? 
As I am in position to justify

My life is at risk and shadowed al the time
All security staff is under scanner sometimes
I fear reprisal if attempt to fall in love
No one may simply trust and believe

I want my normal life
Wants to leas as somebody's wife
Alas! I can't do it for various reasons
As I am placed in category of special persons
 
I shed no tears now for personal existence
I can bear all agony to self and offer no pretence
We all owe so much to country and whole heatedly promise


You can see me smiling for ever
But don't try to recover secret forever
As it may cost me life and sometimes life ban
I may be picked up for concentration camp in van

I shall try to human too when time comes
I shall also wish my dream come true 
But I got to wait until opportune time comes
As we are considered back bone of the system and gem  

I keep smile on face
You won't find regret or any trace
It will be fresh and free from stress
Ever charming and loveable in any case


Faint bells tinkling in the background
The night utters a soulful sigh, 
To see Radha and Krishna 
Bound in embrace. The full moon cries

There's strange magic in the air
Jasmines spreading their incense. 
Flutes sing, to celebrate the pair. 
Passions rise. Intense

The sky illumines, 
By sheer fire set ablaze 
Stars fiercely twinkling 

The Gopis start trickling out of their homes. 
Struck with love's lightning in a daze 
Getting drawn towards Krishna 
Spellbound in his gaze 

Rivers heaving and rising 
Carrying love in their bosom 
Drenched in ecstasy. They succumb, 
To the feet of their divine lover


Waves of strength
Surging in You and Me

Stream of compassion
Flowing in You and Me

Trembling consciousness
Quivering in You and Me

Creative juices
Flowing in You and Me

Undying Spirit
Burning in You and Me

Throbbing Heart
Overflowing with love in You and Me


When still a child
He loved the lives
Lost in the wild.
The Madia-Gonds
Had captured his mind –
He could now find
Behind a tribal’s naked frame
A zest for life
Much the same.
Behind their myopic eyes, 
Behind their jungly cries
He could see sometimes
Creatures more cultured and wise.
He could see some civility
In their poverty.
As years went by
He had formed with them
A passionate tie.
He could no more let
A Madia die
For want of bread
Or by diseases infected.
He gave them as his own life
His son and his wife.
He gave them the plough
Gave them enough know-how.
Blackboards and syringe
To them he brought.
To save them from abuse
He fought and sought.
He revolutionized much 
The tribal thought.
Still, steal their freedom 
He never did.
He only fertilized a land
That lay arid.
His action grew from compassion.
He fears no failure.
Regrets no rejection.
So he built a bridge of understanding
Between a world developed
And a world developing.
As much as he lives for those lives
For them so much he also dares to die.
He will even damn the dam
He cannot but listen to their genuine cry. 

His spots are the joy of the Leopard: his horns are the Buffalo’s pride.
Be clean, for the strength of the hunter is known by the gloss of his hide.
If ye find that the bullock can toss you, or the heavy-browed Sambhur can gore;
Ye need not stop work to inform us: we knew it ten seasons before.
Oppress not the cubs of the stranger, but hail them as Sister and Brother,
For though they are little and fubsy, it may be the Bear is their mother.
‘There is none like to me !’ says the Cub in the pride of his earliest kill;
But the jungle is large and the Cub he is small. Let him think and be still. 



See this fine manuscript 
so beautifully illuminated round the picture – 

why, it’s none other than Kabir! 
reading a book entitled The Poems of Kabir; 

he’s smiling, laughing, waving his hands – 
how can he be enjoying himself so much? 

The manuscript doesn’t tell you this; 
only Kabir can tell you, in that other place.. 

of all the poems, he only recognises two 
as poems that he wrote himself.. 

but here’s Kabir’s delight today: 
many of the other poems, he thinks, 

could pass for his! 
How wonderful to be so praised in spirit! 

As he reads – see, he’s circled round with angels; 
they’re all laughing too.

Partly to throw light on a certain period,
partly to kill an hour or two,
last night I picked up and read
a volume of inscriptions about the Ptolemies.
The lavish praise and flattery are much the same
for each of them. All are brilliant,
glorious, mighty, benevolent;
everything they undertake is full of wisdom.
As for the women of their line, the Berenices and Cleopatras,
they too, all of them, are marvelous.
 
When I'd verified the facts I wanted
I would have put the book away had not a brief
insignificant mention of King Kaisarion
suddenly caught my eye. 

 
And there you were with your indefinable charm.
Because we know
so little about you from history,
I could fashion you more freely in my mind.
I made you good-looking and sensitive.
My art gives your face
a dreamy, an appealing beauty.
And so completely did I imagine you
that late last night,
as my lamp went out—I let it go out on purpose—
it seemed you came into my room,
it seemed you stood there in front of me, looking just as you would have
in conquered Alexandria,
pale and weary, ideal in your grief,
still hoping they might take pity on you,
those scum who whispered: "Too many Caesars


What, Kaiser dead? The heavy news
Post-haste to Cobham calls the Muse, 
From where in Farringford she brews 
The ode sublime,
Or with Pen-bryn's bold bard pursues 
A rival rhyme.

Kai's bracelet tail, Kai's busy feet,
Were known to all the village-street.
'What, poor Kai dead?' say all I meet;
'A loss indeed!' 
O for the croon pathetic, sweet,
Of Robin's reed ! 

Six years ago I brought him down,
A baby dog, from London town;
Round his small throat of black and brown 
A ribbon blue,
And vouch'd by glorious renown
A dachshound true.

His mother, most majestic dame,
Of blood-unmix'd, from Potsdam came; 
And Kaiser's race we deem'd the same--
No lineage higher.
And so he bore the imperial name.
But ah, his sire!

Soon, soon the days conviction bring. 
The collie hair, the collie swing,
The tail's indomitable ring,
The eye's unrest--
The case was clear; a mongrel thing
Kai stood confest. 

But all those virtues, which commend
The humbler sort who serve and tend,
Were thine in store, thou faithful friend.
What sense, what cheer!
To us, declining tow'rds our end, 
A mate how dear!

For Max, thy brother-dog, began
To flag, and feel his narrowing span.
And cold, besides, his blue blood ran,
Since, 'gainst the classes, 
He heard, of late, the Grand Old Man 
Incite the masses.

Yes, Max and we grew slow and sad;
But Kai, a tireless shepherd-lad,
Teeming with plans, alert, and glad 
In work or play,
Like sunshine went and came, and bade
Live out the day!

Still, still I see the figure smart--
Trophy in mouth, agog to start, 
Then, home return'd, once more depart;
Or prest together
Against thy mistress, loving heart,
In winter weather.

I see the tail, like bracelet twirl'd, 
In moments of disgrace uncurl'd,
Then at a pardoning word re-furl'd,
A conquering sign;
Crying, 'Come on, and range the world,
And never pine.' 

Thine eye was bright, thy coat it shone;
Thou hast thine errands, off and on;
In joy thy last morn flew; anon,
A fit! All's over;
And thou art gone where Geist hath gone, 
And Toss, and Rover.

Poor Max, with downcast, reverent head,
Regards his brother's form outspread;
Full well Max knows the friend is dead
Whose cordial talk, 
And jokes in doggish language said,
Beguiled his walk.

And Glory, stretch'd at Burwood gate,
Thy passing by doth vainly wait;
And jealous Jock, thy only hate, 
The chiel from Skye, 
Lets from his shaggy Highland pate
Thy memory die.

Well, fetch his graven collar fine,
And rub the steel, and make it shine, 
And leave it round thy neck to twine,
Kai, in thy grave.
There of thy master keep that sign,
And this plain stave. 


I saw you
I saw you in my eye
when we were just 
children at the time
we were two
who hadn't had the mind
to one day know
the love that, 
we could find 

you walk in
and beauty is defined 
in all your smiles
my life is refined 
And I never knew
a heart could be so kind
but i'm tied to you
because you rebuilt mine  

and i know
i'm not always perfect
and some times
i'm weak and im low
but with all the
beauty you've given
all i want is to return your hope.

you are 
everything there is
when one man
knows you are all
an infinite 
universe in your eyes
and all other women
are just stars at your ball.

make so much beauty
and let one man
call it his own
a gift to my world
is the love that you give me
and i just want to let you know

that i know
i'm not always perfect
and some times
i'm weak and im low
but with all the
beauty you've given
all i want is to return your hope


The bleached wood massed in bone piles,   
we pulled it from dark beach and built   
fire in a fenced clearing. 
The posts' blunt stubs sank down, 
they circled and were roofed by milled   
lumber dragged at one time to the coast.   
We slept there. 

Each morning the minus tide— 
weeds flowed it like hair swimming.   
The starfish gripped rock, pastel,   
rough. Fish bones lay in sun. 

Each noon the milk fog sank 
from cloud cover, came in   
our clothes and held them   
tighter on us. Sea stacks   
stood and disappeared. 
They came back when the sun 
scrubbed out the inlet. 

We went down to piles to get 
mussels, I made my shirt 
a bowl of mussel stones, carted 
them to our grate where they smoked apart.   
I pulled the mussel lip bodies out, 
chewed their squeak. 
We went up the path for fresh water, berries.   
Hardly speaking, thinking. 


During low tide we crossed   
to the island, climbed 
its wet summit. The redfoots   
and pelicans dropped for fish.   
Oclets so silent fell 
toward water with linked feet. 

Jacynthe said little. 
Long since we had spoken Nova Scotia,
Michigan, and knew beauty in saying nothing.   
She told me about her mother 
who would come at them with bread knives then   
stop herself, her face emptied. 


I told her about me, 
never lied. At night 
at times the moon floated.   
We sat with arms tight   
watching flames spit, snap.   
On stone and sand picking up 
wood shaped like a body, like a gull. 

I ran barefoot not only 
on beach but harsh gravels   
up through the woods. 
I shit easy, covered my dropping.   
Some nights, no fires, we watched 
sea pucker and get stabbed   
by the beacon 
circling on Tatoosh. 


I stripped and spread 
on the sea lip, stretched   
to the slap of the foam   
and the vast red dulce.   
Jacynthe gripped the earth   
in her fists, opened— 
the boil of the tide   
shuffled into her. 

The beach revolved, 
headlands behind us 
put their pines in the sun. 
Gulls turned a strong sky. 
Their pained wings held, 
they bit water quick, lifted.   
Their looping eyes continually   
measure the distance from us,   
bare women who do not touch. 

Rocks drowsed, holes 
filled with suds from a distance. 
A deep laugh bounced in my flesh   
and sprayed her. 


Flies crawled us, 
Jacynthe crawled. 
With her palms she 
spread my calves, she 
moved my heels from each other.   
A woman's mouth is 
not different, sand moved 
wild beneath me, her long 
hair wiped my legs, with women   
there is sucking, the water 
slops our bodies. We come 
clean, our clits beat like 
twins to the loons rising up. 

We are awake. 
Snails sprinkle our gulps.   
Fish die in our grips, there is   
sand in the anus of dancing.   
Tatoosh Island 
hardens in the distance. 
We see its empty stones   
sticking out of the sea again.   
Jacynthe holds tinder 
under fire to cook the night's wood. 

If we had men I would make   
milk in me simply. She is   
quiet. I like that you 
cover your teeth. 



Kalandar, the Sufi saint

The bomb blast caused panic
It is holy shrine with no relic
People from all faiths visit this place
And worship without restriction of race

The ISIS has claimed the responsibility
The country is losing sympathy
For supporting terrorist organizations on one side
And suffering same fate country wide

Scores of people lay dead
We can see them in pools of blood 
The kalandar or Sufi saint was symbol of harmony
It was great honor to bow before his cemetery  

Their goal of exporting people to disrupt normal life in neighborhood
It is seen and observed that whatever they do is not at all good
The bullets for freedom is taken as voice to curb
Target the holy places and rub the sounds 

No, no it is not ideal place
The terrorists move here with alarming pace
The government is keeping blind eye
People suffer but who can try against high handedness





Startled by the intensity
My emotions for you 
Like wind threatening 
to sweep me off  my feet
 
Pure like clear water 
Your reflection etched deep
Bundled in my arms
I can hear your heart beat
 
Blessed with your sight
Forever want to keep
Kneeling in devotion 
l am sanctified by you
 
Will burn your incense 
Aroma wafting through
Castles in the Clouds
I will make for you
 
Faraway dreams
Will make them come true
Fierce protector
Becoming Kali for You. 




pretty hot and tempting
yes your da bomb
sweet honest and mean
pretty bad and a freak
caramel skin and thick
just the way i like em
sex appeal and sophisticated 
loving you some chocolate
down to earth and cool
and ya skin oh so smooth
barely know u but u my friend
one i hope to know better
i peeped that pretty smile 
so keep it on ya face
but whoever turns it around
tell em come my way
because a friend to me is precious
they are like little diamonds in my life
we help each other grow
and shine a bright light
so kaliah phat 
stay my friendhere under these blaze of brilliant sunshine
I lived life without you blissfully


Strangers were friendly and helpful
Rather then my own
So I find this universal meaningfully beautiful

All the way for miss india 
Lost in airport
taxiwalas trying to dupe me-a lonely girl never helpless
a born warrior
I smile over their blunder

those long lost kashmiri family in self exile, 
a space in the taxi with the family-we spoke of love and happiness-peace
I could sense their life was bleeding
somewhere I guess noida sector or  
I can visualise their beautiful home-I still love you all

trying to gather grains of time gone

in trains, on bus, trakking

spiritual quest to shirdi, shani skuleswar, 
birth place of the son of wind-hanuman
with  girish, sachin, ashish television went down they prayed for all the television stars-
they were godly

thanks my dearest friend 
I look like the bird peacock
in peocock blue kanchivaram wedding silk saree 
dancing in the dark green deep forest

watching the film in goa film festival
kanchivaram every human film 


global festival of human music 
mantra from my guru 

played the broken flute 
Wrapped in the wind blowing blissfully

Body draped in white kanchivaram silk saree
I felt like a white dove 
then as an angel wraped in white clouds of peace

I am closing my eyes
For I donnot want  that lingering black cloud 
For still the devil’s triangle exist
I don’t want to bleed anymore
I donot want to see anything black
Waiting black to fade out


Delicate mother Kangaroo 
Sitting up there rabbit-wise, but huge, plump-weighted, 
And lifting her beautiful slender face, oh! so much more 
gently and finely lined than a rabbit's, or than a hare's, 
Lifting her face to nibble at a round white peppermint drop 
which she loves, sensitive mother Kangaroo. 


Her sensitive, long, pure-bred face. 
Her full antipodal eyes, so dark, 
So big and quiet and remote, having watched so many 
empty dawns in silent Australia. 

Her little loose hands, and drooping Victorian shoulders. 
And then her great weight below the waist, her vast pale belly, 
With a thin young yellow little paw hanging out, and 
straggle of a long thin ear, like ribbon, 
Like a funny trimming to the middle of her belly, thin 
little dangle of an immature paw, and one thin ear. 

Her belly, her big haunches 
And, in addition, the great muscular python-stretch of her tail. 

There, she shan't have any more peppermint drops. 
So she wistfully, sensitively sniffs the air, and then turns, 
goes off in slow sad leaps 
On the long flat skis of her legs, 
Steered and propelled by that steel-strong snake of a tail. 

Stops again, half turns, inquisitive to look back. 
While something stirs quickly in her belly, and a lean little 
face comes out, as from a window, 
Peaked and a bit dismayed, 
Only to disappear again quickly away from the sight of the 
world, to snuggle down in the warmth, 
Leaving the trail of a different paw hanging out. 

Still she watches with eternal, cocked wistfulness! 
How full her eyes are, like the full, fathomless, shining 
eyes of an Australian black-boy 
Who has been lost so many centuries on the margins of 
existence! 
She watches with insatiable wistfulness. 
Untold centuries of watching for something to come, 
For a new signal from life, in that silent lost land of the 
South. 

Where nothing bites but insects and snakes and the sun, 
small life. 
Where no bull roared, no cow ever lowed, no stag cried, 
no leopard screeched, no lion coughed, no dog barked, 
But all was silent save for parrots occasionally, in the 
haunted blue bush. 

Wistfully watching, with wonderful liquid eyes. 
And all her weight, all her blood, dropping sackwise down 
towards the earth's centre, 
And the live little-one taking in its paw at the door of her 
belly. 


Be glad you're not a kangaroo
and you're a girl or boy. 

'cause all the little kangaroos
are named the same thing, 'Joey'. 

This day, January is the most happiest birthday 
.. 

of my friend  Karaikal Mr. 

Raghavasamy! 
I pray for a long hundreds and hundreds of years 
.. 

For him to live in this everlasting earthly world, 
with an understanding like the wide sea


Laughing in spite of tears of pain 
Tasting life in spite of disdain 
Painting landscapes of the mind 
Searching for what's hard to find 

Drawing on strength for mind and body 
Walking the road of soulful loneliness 
Dancing the night away to Let It Be  
Crying tears of joy nonetheless 

More human than man or woman 
Less threatening than maddening of the mind 
Humane time and again   yeah man 
Karen is the caring of the human kind  

She cries for she is only human 
She laughs for comedy in her men 
She's scared because life's a bitch 
She's alive   not in the ditch 

She's Karen on their mind 
Every souls' hard to find 
A creature of earthly divine 
Her heart so classically fine  

She wakes experiencing life 
Last night's dreams in so much strife 
A glass of water helps her breathe 
Fighting off cancer that's beneath   

She struggles   eating her poor lunch  
Remembering she's in the crunch 
Waiting for Him to give her the nod   

Her legs finding small steps to take 
Her mind focused on what's to make 
Karen on her mind 
In this shitty find  

Her eyes now seeing the eternal light 
Her ears hearing music that's so bright 
Her nose smelling much longer living 
In yesterday's and today's striving 

Souls searching only to be kind           
In lives that have been in a bind
Mother's lost and find
Karen on her mind

Wherein are words sublime or noble? What 
Invests one speech with haloed eminence, 
Makes it the sesame for all doors shut, 
Yet in its like sees but impertinence? 
Is it the hue? Is it the cast of eye, 
The curve of lip or Asiatic breath, 
Which mark a lesser place for Gandhi’s cry 
Than "Give me liberty or give me death!" 

Is Indian speech so quaint, so weak, so rude, 
So like its land enslaved, denied, and crude, 
That men who claim they fight for liberty 
Can hear this battle-shout impassively, 
Yet to their arms with high resolve have sprung 
At those same words cried in the English tongue

I

We cannot choose our sorrows. One there was
Who, reverent of soul, and strong with trust,
Yet will I praise thy everlasting laws.
Beggared, my faith would never halt or pause,
But sing Thy glory, feasting on a crust.
Only one boon, one precious boon I must
Demand of Thee, O opulent great Cause.
Let Love stay with me, constant to the end,
Though fame pass by and poverty pursue.'
With freighted hold her life ship onward sailed;
The world gave wealth, and pleasure, and a friend,
Unmarred by envy, and whose heart was true.
But ere the sun reached midday, Love had failed.


II

Then from the depths, in bitterness she cried,
'Hell is on earth, and heaven is but a dream;
And human life a troubled aimless stream;
A loving creature's faith?' A voice replied,
'The stream flows onward to the Source Supreme,
Where things that ARE replace the things that SEEM,
And where the deeds of all past lives abide.
Once at thy door Love languished and was spurned.
Who sorrow plants, must garner sorrow's sheaf.
No prayers can change the seedling in the sod.
By thine own heart Love's anguish must be learned.
Pass on, and know, as one made wise by grief,
Our endless life story 
That is being played 
On the seven-storied stage of sky! 
.
At the same time it’s also true: 
We are the architects 
Of our own future
Cause we get result of what we do! 

However we’ll have the final result
Of our actions on the Day of Resurrection! 

We should also plan our future
And try to make it happen.

In absolute detail
And He doesn’t need to know it.
It is an endless story
After zillions and zillions of years
That’s one of the reasons 
Be it big or small on Laohay Mahfuz.
Therefore we should also read and write
To preserve and spread our wisdom.  

There are seventy thousand paths 
That lead to paradise
For example
Path of Belief
Path of Truthfulness
Path of Charity
Path of Salat
Path of Fasting
Path of Tax
Path of Hajj
And so on.
All the aforesaid paths are straight paths 
That leads to respective gates of paradise! 
In fact Pool Sirat has seventy thousand levels
All end at the respective gates of paradise! 
The Gate of Faith of paradise is the biggest
And it is the must have access to paradise. 

However
For a hassle-free journey to paradise
One needs to go through at least
The following paths
Path of Belief
Path of Patience
Path of Preaching of the Truth
And path of any other good work

If you are a firm believer
You will be able to go to paradise
Through the Gate of Belief
If you are a truthful person
You will be able to go to paradise
Through the Gate of Truthfulness
And so forth

So you see it’s very easy to go to paradise
But it’s very difficult
To be very prestigious

Karpumpuli and Kathakali

When you play the karpumpuli
Through the eight holes
whole stars flow inside the flute

Did you know karpumpuli
Do you know karpumpuli now
Enlivening the stars to become ready
And the all the stars becomes the  eight holes of the flute

That becomes the baby inside a mother’s womb
Ready to become a man
That becomes human inside a man’s body
Ready to become you
In complete form
Eternal beyond
In cosmic harmony
You are so connected to divine that
Divinity surrenders
You become divine

Do you know Karpumpuli
When you become Karpumli
And you rule the galaxy of stars
You become the stars
You become Karpumpuli

And from my broken torso 
Evolve out many a hands of Durga
Evolve out heads of Brahma

The four lions back to back 
Ready on pillar so high
Asoka’s Chakra
Wheel of time
Fertility and maternity
Similarity ends
I become the Kathakali dancer
I hear the call of karpumpuli

In my multi-coloured Face secreted to be near you
I become a Kathakali dancers
And
And dance in the tune of Karpumpuli
Starts all over my body


 

Chhap Chhap
The sound of a shikara in the mist laden dark night
Chhap Chhap
Not even a bird dares to come here 
Chhap Chhap
Is this water or the tears of the people of the valley? 
Chhap Chhap
A strange trembling. . 

maybe the spirits of the masaccred people
Chhap Chhap
Why is the color of the water so red? 
Chhap Chhap
Though it was once a paradise



Still debating, still delay,
And the world’s a ghost that gleams –
Wavers – vanishes away!

We must live while live we can;
We should love while love we may.
Dread in women, doubt in men-
So the Infinite runs away. 


 
who wants to sleep under moon light? 
and loose he silvery delight 
why not rob that memorable moment? 
let night and love it go on uninterrupted


Kazi* used to be known as religious man 
Fully conversant and competent person  
Everybody may go to him for advice
He may have with him ready made device 

Many legendary tales are on 
Still memory and stories about him have not gone 
Whole village may respect his family members
It was all due to mark of respect as juror 

Once his dog died due to illness
The news spread across
Whole of village turned for funeral 
The burial rites were passed on oral 

Such nice man got ill
He was not recovering well
One day he died and left for another world
Whole of village got upset and developed cold

Now they thought as Kazi* is dead
Let us not take that much lead
Few people can go and attend 
There is no one left to feel offended 

Such stories are still on 
They are circulated and often shown 
The importance of being tall person
And there after treatment meted upon




Do you think, we two, just you and me, 
having reached the age of sixty-three, 
could find fame by writing poetry.
Or should we continue to compose, 
some assorted mild prose, 
which then is lost in indistinct obscurity.

Whatever be out hope and our desire, 
we always try so hard to thus aspire, 
to create a poem that's so exemplary.
And a dream can still persist, 
inside our mind's wish-list, 
but fades so fast from it, eventually.

Yet never stopping, we just keep compiling, 
verse after verse, each one becomes beguiling, 
creating our own spoken tapestry, 
So on reaching sixty-four, 
will we be writing even more, 
from our intellect, an untapped treasury.

It's not great works that come always from the young, 
there are poets of great merit, their praises sung, 
these have deserved to be legendary.
They have composed such noted writes, 
each famous name lit up in lights, 
because of their sheer talented artistry.

the moment of 'hope' they do not have.


If hope were a feeling, I would hope, 
it be one of honesty and integrity.
I would hope it would be love and empathy.

If hope were a food, I would hope it
would be filled with nourishment.

If hope were music, I would hope, it
was the kind of music, that you loved.

If hope were a sound, I would hope it
would by a symphony of love.

If hope were a religion, I would hope it
was your religion. For as we all know, 
the 'right religion' is one that you
believe in. For to think ones religion
is 'the right and only religion'
that would make billions of others, 
who did not believe in your religion.  

wrong.
All religions, if one truly believes in
them, are the right ones.

If hope were belief, then I would hope, 
that belief would be, that there is one
Supreme Being; who is by-lingual and
of all faiths, and all creeds and colors.

If hope were knowledge, I would hope, 
it had patience, understanding, the
ability of comprehending the other
persons point of view. I would also hope, 
that it had an unquenchable thirst, 
to continue to learn by experience and
research.

If hope could be seen, I would hope, all
would see, the good in their fellow man.

If hope were a wish, I would hope
that all your dreams, and ambitions
came true.

If hope were you.  

if hope were me, I
would hope, we never lost sight of
those less fortunate. I would hope
we would never be so self-centered
or busy, that we neglected to extend
a helping hand, to those in need.

Finally if you hope this ends, let me
conclude by saying

If hope were a human, I would hope, that it
realized, that if we want a better world, 
then we have to be better ourselves.


and you will see the guy I see
Keep believing in yourself and
things will work out
Keep trying to be the
guy I can see
I know if you keep looking
you will fine yourself
Remember who you are and
that I Love you
So keep looking in the
mirror and you will see
the Love I have for you


I remember the enchanting love, 
When your freedom make you mine, 
You break the seconds of silence, 
You keep me into your heart. 

II
Keep me fully glad with nothing. Only take my hand in your hand.
In the gloom of the deepening night take up my heart and play with it as you list. Bind me close to you with nothing.
I will spread myself out at your feet and lie still. Under this clouded sky I will meet silence with silence. I will become one with the night clasping the earth in my breast.
Make my life glad with nothing.
The rains sweep the sky from end to end. Jasmines in the wet untamable wind revel in their own perfume. The cloud-hidden stars thrill in secret. Let me fill to the full my heart with nothing but my own depth of joy. 

Keep on raising rate of beats 

then the raising keep slow, 

broken hearts i treat. 

We should value the fact that our precious earth, 
is spinning around for all it is worth.
And because it is, we must not scoff, 
for if it stopped whirling, we’d all fall off, 
To float out into the wide blue unknown, 
each of us completely on our own.
A suspended speck, some useless debris, 
gliding into universal history.

Keep revolving sphere, we require your speed, 
keeping the gravity that we all need.
Please do not halt, we have no desire
to see outer space, and then to expire.
With no oxygen, our life would conclude, 
causing a disaster of such magnitude.
It makes one think and start to realise
That this orb holds us safe within the skies.

Our planet’s a wondrous globe so vast, 
And its fashioning is totally unsurpassed.


and keep up your promise! 
They call you the refugeless refuge, 
they call you redeemer of outcasts. 
Caught in a riptide 
in the sea of becoming, 
without your support I'm a shipwreck! 
You reveal yourself age after age 
and free the beggar 
from her affliction. 

Dark One, Mira is clutching your feet, 
at stake is your honor

In a field
I am the absence
of field.
This is
always the case.
Wherever I am
I am what is missing.

When I walk
I part the air
and always
the air moves in   
to fill the spaces
where my body's been.

We all have reasons
for moving.
I move
to keep things whole. 

Everything seems
two sizes 
too small for you.

making me perspire
never mind the guys
getting hot under the collar.

And those jeans
as if painted upon you
(are they for real?)  

Unable to bend down
I have to retrieve your fallen purse
for you.

And woah.  
.  

those stilettoes! 

Like how
do you stand up
never mind walk? 

Seems like you would need
a mathematical formula

to get in motion! 

I say: 'Say Cheese! '
for the camera
and the camera
catches you mouthing: 

'Sex! '

I ask you
what you

call this look? 

And you say
'Girl.  

I calls it sex.  

on a stick! '

'I'm sex on legs. . 

babeeee! '

I give up

.  keep up with you!‘Tis strange on such a peaceful day
With white clouds flying o’er,
That foreign boats are in the bay
As prisoners of war.
The Harbour, where they quietly lay;
Smiles brightly as of yore.

Where never angry shot was fired
To alter peaceful plans;
Where British lumpers worked till tired
With Yacob and with Hans,
And ‘shouted’ when their work was done
For other ‘sailormans’.

And while we think of other lands
And what is doing there,
And while we think of what red hands
May wreak in our despair –
How can the Harbour be so blue,
And the sky above so fair

We borrowed the loan of Kerr's ass
To go to Dundalk with butter,
Brought him home the evening before the market
And exile that night in Mucker.

We heeled up the cart before the door,
We took the harness inside -
The straw-stuffed straddle, the broken breeching
With bits of bull-wire tied;

The winkers that had no choke-band,
The collar and the reins . . . 
In Ealing Broadway, London Town
I name their several names

Until a world comes to life -
Morning, the silent bog,
In a Mucker fog. 

Elohim is adorned with your all being invisibility
As there is none more humble than thou
Send down thy colorless mysteries 
Lend us the absolute compassion you embody
Eternal, beyond time, beyond consciousness
So it is you are crystallized Infinity
Seamless and without genesis or expiration

Attribute your Mercies to our lives
Watch over us, as Ein Soph weaves throughout all  
Ever so, a protection of Light surrounds us

Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh
Voiced in All and Seen by All
Eternal, infinite, boundless forever
Reigning with humility, judgment, and divinity  

Generating comprehensions beyond the mind
Engine of production
Never stopping 
Enlightening and enacting variation 
Realized contentment
Attaining the form of perfection
The Hidden Light that illuminates
Eternal, Circlet, Unbreaking


The key to friendship
Is not in the hand you hold
But how you hold the hand.

It's not in the tears you dry
But all the reasons why.

It's not how you make a person smile 
But whether or not it's worthwhile.

It's not in the conversation 
But in the way you listen.

It's not in the laughter 
But what comes before and everything after.

The key to friendship 
Is not in two people relating 
But in two hearts communicating.

Thank you for being that special friend 
Who understands the key to friendship
And how to unlock everything within my heart. 

Kick thy bucket faster-
To inspire young delight; 
And when Death claims she's master, 
Do smile you bright; so bright. 

The fishermen on Lake Michigan, sometimes,
For kicks, they spit two hunks of bait on hooks
At either end of a single length of line
And toss that up among the scavenging gulls,

Who go for it so fast that often two of them
Make the connection before it hits the water.
Hooked and hung up like that, they do a dance
That lasts only so long. The fishermen

Do that for kicks, on Lake Michigan, sometimes.



Kid is said no no
Wants more, to listen no more
When yes, another


Ever been kidnapped 
by a poet 
if i were a poet 
i'd kidnap you 
put you in my phrases and meter
You to jones beach 
or maybe coney island 
or maybe just to my house 
lyric you in lilacs 
dash you in the rain 
blend into the beach 
to complement my see
Play the lyre for you 
ode you with my love song 
anything to win you 
wrap you in the red Black green 
show you off to mama 
yeah if i were a poet i'd kid 
nap you


I HELD my heart so far from harm,
I let it wander far and free
In mead and mart, without alarm,
Assured it must come back to me.
And all went well till on a day,
Learned Dr. Cupid wandered by
A search along our sylvan way
For some peculiar butterfly.
A flash of wings, a hurried drive,
A flutter and a short-lived flit;
This Scientist, as I am alive
Had seen my heart and captured it.
Right tightly now 'tis held among
The specimens that he has trapped,
And sings (Oh, love is ever young),
'Tis passing sweet to be kidnaped. 

Early mornings late nights
Playing baseball all day
Follow by hide n go seek
We always had fun
We always seem to get into trouble
We were like two peas in a pod
You were the first one I ever kissed
I dreamed it would always be just me and you
I dreamed that you would be my first
Then we started getting older
My friends liked you
I admit I was jealous
Then again I hooked you two up
We started to grow apart
Nothing was ever going to be the same
I didn't have anyone anymore
Then I hardly talked wit you
We finally went are seperate ways
Now after years go by you show up
Right out of the blue 
I didn't know what to think
I finally had a boyfriend
So I pushed you away
And you left again
My man and I broke it off
You stoped by
An we both knew what was going to happen
Everything I ever dreamed about you came true
Yet I dont have those feelings I use to have for you
Will it ever be like it use to

Oh! You are a little black boy, 
and playing with your small toy.
Oh! You are black from outside, 
but your heart and soul are white.

Your innocence is covering you, 
from your head till your smallest toe.

You are behaving spontaneously.
You are naive, curious, innocent and asking continuously.
You are vivid at day, and tired at night.
You are a beautiful flower swaying with delight.

And I consider you all as a noble reward.


I dedicate this poem to the whole kids on this planet 'the white and the black'  they  are both equal.

'NO FOR RACISM'.  )Words cannot justify what ye mean to me.
Giving you life and in return receiving a new dimension to living.
My heart was like a dormant volcano but upon your arrival burst into life.
Knowing attachments weaken people but for you I would go to hell because your happiness is priceless.

Remembering your first step, your first word or even you first bunch of hair, 
Or when you wept, I heard and comforted you like a child’s teddy bear.

When times are tough, and life becomes rough I simple image you smiling.
The warmth you bring lets my heart sing, loving the gift of living.

Understanding life’s amazing ability of uniqueness; 
Seeing both of you demonstrating, different types of kindness.

Like your guardian angle, my advice echo’s in your mind but it’s still your choice. 
Letting you tangle, being cruel to be kind praying you’ll hear my voice.
So as you blossom more and more each day your innocence is being lost. 
I would love to wrap you up, protecting you from harms way but realise learning comes at a cost.

When you fall I will be there helping you back onto your feet, when you cry I will be there drying those tears and when it’s cold and rainy I will be the shelter until it’s sunny.

Knowing kids are on loan so for all these found memoires I am truly glad, 
Even when you’re grown up and your problems fall on deaf ears you can always call me dad. 

Kids’ tears  draw the adults’ fears
A kid’s misery appears
In the streets of Algiers
But no one hears
His weeping years after years
Closing their ears
And showing their cheers
A kid’s sadness appears
In the roads of Algiers
Dreaming to live as his peers
Kids’ tears draw the adults’ fears.  . .. 

This is for the kids who die,
Black and white,
For kids will die certainly.
The old and rich will live on awhile,
As always,
Eating blood and gold,
Letting kids die.

Kids will die in the swamps of Mississippi
Organizing sharecroppers
Kids will die in the streets of Chicago
Organizing workers
Kids will die in the orange groves of California
Telling others to get together
Whites and Filipinos,
Negroes and Mexicans,
All kinds of kids will die
Who don't believe in lies, and bribes, and contentment
And a lousy peace.

Of course, the wise and the learned
Who pen editorials in the papers,
And the gentlemen with Dr. in front of their names
White and black,
Who make surveys and write books
Will live on weaving words to smother the kids who die,
And the sleazy courts,
And the bribe-reaching police,
And the blood-loving generals,
And the money-loving preachers
Will all raise their hands against the kids who die,
Beating them with laws and clubs and bayonets and bullets
To frighten the people—
For the kids who die are like iron in the blood of the people—
And the old and rich don't want the people
To taste the iron of the kids who die,
Don't want the people to get wise to their own power,
To believe an Angelo Herndon, or even get together

Listen, kids who die—
Maybe, now, there will be no monument for you
Except in our hearts
Maybe your bodies'll be lost in a swamp
Or a prison grave, or the potter's field,
Or the rivers where you're drowned like Leibknecht
But the day will come—
You are sure yourselves that it is coming—
When the marching feet of the masses
Will raise for you a living monument of love,
And joy, and laughter,
And black hands and white hands clasped as one,
And a song that reaches the sky—
The song of the life triumphant
Through the kids who die.

Part One: Kill Bri


I’ve suffered the indignity 
 to be born [unasked], 
a naked, almost helpless, babe --, you can be sure.
Now I’d just as soon be dead 
 after years of tasks, 
but PLEASE don’t think I’m depressed and only need a "cure"! 

Unfortunately I’m conflicted, or I’d do the job NOW, myself.
[I’m afflicted with good health, but not what I call wealth.]
I’ve entangled my life with others 
., who might look askance -
if I hung or starved myself [to death], not giving "life" a second chance.

[A look "askance" is nothing I’d ever really worry about, 
BUT I might leave a few people "in the lurch".  Some MIGHT even pout! ]

I don’t wish to ‘tempt fate’ for TOO long.  Know what I mean? 
Before body or mind falls apart, I’d wish to leave life’s scene.
Surely my departure would leave for others more food and space.
I‘ve no desire to try (with "old age")     to keep up 
. 

the pace.



               Part Two: Don’t Kill Bri


What a "baby" I was when I was born! 
Was I more special than those before me? 
I’ve led a charmed life, one I shall not scorn.
Then why should I [from life] yearn -- to be free? 

I’ve got good health, good food; I get my sleep.
Plenty of others [before me] should be killed.
Why, "handicapped, poor, and demented", keep 

[alive]? 
Along with ‘troublemakers’, I‘d kill them ALL 

.   

if I weren’t weak-willed! 

OK!  I’ve had a bit of fun with this, 
Old age and "infirmity" can be a bitch -

[NOT that "young-and-firm" lives never have a hitch! ]



                 Part Three: The Ending


If you’re still with me, please hear me out.
Not even I liked when "poor and handicapped" I wrote about! 
I still think "demented" should be helped to die, 
but "poor and handicapped" --



[We interrupt this forthright "poem" just to say: 
"The Readers aren’t amused!  They’ve dragged Bri away! ! 
Many have shouted 'he's blasphemous'; 
the medical corporations say ‘he’ll take money from us! ’.
Some say ‘we must keep Granny alive at all costs 
.
even though her husband, friends, and mind she’s lost’.

" ‘Keep their hearts ticking!  Do transplants!  Don’t pull the plug! ! 
This Bri’s a human menace.  He’s a VERY slimy slug! ! ! ’

"So now, whatever YOUR view, this poem is finally over.
AND Bri got his "death wish"; he’s NOW "pushing up the clover."]

(July   Your ' Youth ' has fallen from its shelf,
And you have fallen, you yourself.
They knocked a soldier on the head,
I mourn the poet who fell dead.
And yet I think it was by chance,
By oversight you died in France.
You were so poor an outward man,
So small against your spirit's span,
That Nature, being tired awhile,
Saw but your outward human pile;
And Nature, who would never let
A sun with light still in it set,
Before you even reached your sky,
In inadvertence let you die. 

Desire and
All the sweet pulsing aches
And gentle hurtings
That were you,
Are gone into the sullen dark.
Now in the night you come unsmiling
To lie with me
A dull, cold, rigid bayonet
On my hot-swollen, throbbing soul. 

I trust you with 
My coffin.
You'll deliver it for me. 
I don't know where or when or
How, 
But you-
will deliver it 
To me. 

Human Wespons Of Mass Destruction! 

Every human being, has they ability of being a
'Weapon Of Mass Destruction.' In this country, 
killing by emotional bullets, has become an art form.

Many, have become experts, at destroying
a fellow human being, with out so much, 
as a single blow to the flesh



On the day the sienna-skinned man
held my shoulders between his spade-shaped hands,
easing me down into the azure water of Jordan,
I woke ninety-three million miles from myself,
Lev Davidovich Bronstein,
shoulder-deep in the Volga,
while the cheap dye of my black silk shirt darkened the water.

My head wet, water caught in my lashes.   
Am I blind?
I rub my eyes, then wade back to shore,   
undress and lie down,
until Stalin comes from his place beneath the birch tree.
He folds my clothes
and I button myself in my marmot coat,
and together we start the long walk back to Moscow.
He doesn't ask, what did you see in the river?,
but I hear the hosts of a man drowning in water and holiness,   
the castrati voices I can't recognize,
skating on knives, from trees, from air
on the thin ice of my last night in Russia.   
Leon Trotsky. Bread.
I want to scream, but silence holds my tongue   
with small spade-shaped hands
and only this comes, so quietly
Stalin has to press his ear to my mouth:   
I have only myself. Put me on the train.   
I won't look back.


 MEXICO, At noon today, I woke from a nightmare:   
my friend Jacques ran toward me with an ax,   
as I stepped from the train in Alma-Ata.
He was dressed in yellow satin pants and shirt.   
A marigold in winter.
When I held out my arms to embrace him,   
he raised the ax and struck me at the neck,   
my head fell to one side, hanging only by skin.   
A river of sighs poured from the cut.


 MEXICO, August  The machine-gun bullets
hit my wife in the legs,
then zigzagged up her body.
I took the shears, cut open her gown   
and lay on top of her for hours.   
Blood soaked through my clothes   
and when I tried to rise, I couldn't.

I wake then. Another nightmare.
I rise from my desk, walk to the bedroom   
and sit down at my wife's mirrored vanity.   
I rouge my cheeks and lips,
stare at my bone-white, speckled egg of a face:   
lined and empty.
I lean forward and see Jacques's reflection.
I half-turn, smile, then turn back to the mirror.
He moves from the doorway,   
lifts the pickax
and strikes the top of my head.   
My brain splits.
The pickax keeps going
and when it hits the tile floor,   
it flies from his hands,
a black dove on whose back I ride,   
two men, one cursing,
the other blessing all things:   
Lev Davidovich Bronstein,
I step from Jordan without you. 

I think the leaves down on my roof of tin.
I feel the failing brightness on my skin.
Autumn insects sing the shadows thin.

You came to me out of a killing frost, 
How many wildflowers did your journey cost? 
Your eyes are cold, gold with the sun you lost.

My fingers write the seasons on your face.
Leaves whisper songs no morning could replace.
The music plays inside as we embrace.

Glass mirrors a gray bowl of simplicity, 
Your telling of the fog is poetry, 
Words fill the emptiness with you and me.

Color is raining somewhere far away, 
I close my heart to what the sad leaves say.
Good-bye would be too real for me today.

Would you catch me a color for belief? 
The poem must be ours however brief.
We might not know the song of next year's leaf.

I shall kill 
Mine enemy 
With such kindness.  
I shall serve him 
Water from the river of life 
When he is dying of thirst 
I shall feed him 
The blood of lambs lost 
And Satan is forgotten 
I shall sing him 
Hallelujah 
Until his tears 
Swell up with such love.  
I shall present him 
With the gift of light   
Until the sun falls asleep 
And the moon reawakens 

I shall now taste 
Enemy's blood  
Awaken love 
Strike with terror 
I shall now kidnap 
His wife and children 
Send them to the land 
Of soul liberty 
I shall patiently wait 
For his river of life 
When dying of such thirst 
And unspoken hunger 

I will meditate 
On mine enemy 
Becoming a friend

Suddenly, I'm old.
My bones, slaked with cold, 
jangle with the sound
of rubbing in my ears.
Tears don't come easy.

The teasing street wind
whistles without favour, 
and I am slow.

Taking refuge in Tesco, 
talking to widow women, 
likened with the situation
their shopping trolleys
half full of expense and need, 
I pause

Freed from time
we kill it
with our jargon. 

Killing time
‘Cause time don’t mind
Time never stops
Just has the sun never drops
From the widespread sky
Yet tears dropp from its eyes
Wonders why it cries
Looking at the night sky dominated by the stars and moon
They give no reply 
They answer no questions or give any reasons why
Beyond that sky are worlds that exist and thrive
The mind inside its imagination is always alive
Dreaming as it wrote it
It awoken to find a sleeping poet


And on that day before Easter, 
the angel came down from Heaven, 
looked at the people of the small town 
and decided that only one strategy
could possibly  be successful.

The angel was a she-angel, of course, 
she was more familiar with in-fighting
and the various game of intrigue, played
not only on earth but also up above, 
which means where the rain don't fall. 

After a brief but mandatory check with
'killing with kindness' would be employed.
And, lo and behold, in the name of the father, 
it worked as predicted and hoped for.

In the end, there was one dead angel, 
a crowd of recently deceased citizens, 
and the gigantic mess left by an early demise
of The Dead Poets' Society. Struth.

decided to strike the word 'kindness', 
as he had done once before, in the war
of thirty years, which had seen the end
of said war, and he told all the angels
that kindness was an impractical tool, 
not to be used again, ever and ever.

his own image and, presumably, 
after his own heart. 

Killings! Killings! Killing! 
Human beings of milking
My brain is blinking
How I bear this feeling

The earth of all we are belonged 
The sea of all we are surrounded 
The sky of all we are breathed
The unit for unity we are granted

For a gun, a bomb or a sharpen weapon
Would it possible to overthrow the sin
Dwindling the humanity, to have the win 
What will last, though it is a heaven? 

Hostility never creates prosperity 
Mentality exists the anxiety 
Brutality gives up possibility
Humanity sleeps upon this opportunity


Unto whose use the pregnant suns are poised,
With idiot moons and stars retracting stars?
Creep thou between -- thy coming's all unnoised.
Heaven hath her high, as Earth her baser, wars.
Heir to these tumults, this affright, that fray
(By Adam's, fathers', own, sin bound alway);
Peer up, draw out thy horoscope and say
Which planet mends thy threadbare fate, or mars.

'My end came while I was happy.
Ermotelis had me for his inseparable friend.
During my last days, though he tried to make me believe
that he wasn't worried, I often noticed his eyes
red from crying. And when he'd think
I'd fallen asleep, he'd collapse at the edge of my bed
as though out of his mind. But we were both young men
of the same age, twenty-three years old.
Fate is a traitor. Maybe some other passion
would have taken Ermotelis from me.
It ended the right way: our love undivided.'
This epitaph for Marylos, son of Aristodimos,
who died in Alexandria a month ago,
was sent to me, his cousin Kimon, in my mourning.
It was sent by the author, a poet friend of mine,
sent because he knew I was related to Marylos-
but that's all he knew.
My heart is full of sorrow over Marylos.
We grew up together, like brothers.
I'm deeply saddened. His premature death
completely wiped out any grudge. 
any grudge I may have had against Marylos,
even if he did steal Ermotelis' love away from me-
so that if Ermotelis should want me again now,
it won't be at all the same as it was.
I know this susceptible nature of mine. The image of Marylos
will come between us, and I'll hear Marylos say to me:
'See, you're satisfied now.
You've taken him back again as you longed to, Kimon;
see, you've lost your excuse for maligning me now. 

FOR BAILEY

We were entwined in red rings   
Of blood and loneliness before   
The first snows fell
Before muddy rivers seeded clouds   
Above a virgin forest, and   
Men ran naked, blue and black   
Skinned into the warm embraces   
Of Sheba, Eve and Lilith.
I was your sister.

You left me to force strangers   
Into brother molds, exacting   
Taxations they never
Owed or could ever pay.

You fought to die, thinking   
In destruction lies the seed   
Of birth. You may be right.

I will remember silent walks in   
Southern woods and long talks   
In low voices
Shielding meaning from the big ears   
Of overcurious adults.

You may be right.   
Your slow return from
Regions of terror and bloody
Screams, races my heart.
I hear again the laughter   
Of children and see fireflies   
Bursting tiny explosions in   
An Arkansas twilight. 

Tinkle, tinkle, on my skin
let it flow, keep nothing in.
Tasting all that flows from you
kinky, yes, I know, I do.
Mind creates what heretofore
hidden past a solid door, 
rules no more, we float above
snowflakes warm the heart we love. 

Am I kin to Sorrow,
   That so oft
Falls the knocker of my door——
   Neither loud nor soft,
But as long accustomed,
   Under Sorrow's hand?
Marigolds around the step
   And rosemary stand,
And then comes Sorrow—
   And what does Sorrow care
For the rosemary
   Or the marigolds there?
Am I kin to Sorrow?
   Are we kin?
That so oft upon my door—


search
for lights
for independence
restless



Not eat much
Not sleep much
To reach balance
In inner and outer


I wanted to spend the rest of my life
under the shade of your long brown hair, 
I wanted to add color to my dreams
with you by my side I did dare.

I was entangled in my life
you had shown me the way out, 
I had been a vagabond
you were my rescuer beyond doubt.

But you gave me umpteen tears that in it I could swim
My life's ship sunk at the shore at your own whim.  

According to character

There are selfish bodies
Also there are kind babies
There is hell stupid person
Also obvious great and brave one

According to the way they dress

There are too neat and descent
Also nasty and disgusting in act
There are shamfull also
Who let their selves undressed so

According to the way they act

There are innocent kind
Also hot disterbs mind
And there are seemly people saved
Who never talk even they got hurtled

According to their ability

Earnest bodies are there inside
Also uneducated ones beside
Smart and keen also are there
Who are winers and deserves more


I ask you Zeus, can man demand
a life away from what must be his own? 
To dwell with joy inside a parallel
to his reality, how could this be
and what, if any benefit could he thus gain? 

The drunkard flees into the fog of sweet oblivion,  
to blind his eyes from utter chaos as it stands, 
the soul that rides the current to the sea
may tire and grab on to kindly hands. 

I have possibly come across
Many religions
And feel at loss
About the path they chosen

Why have they let off love? 
And madly believe
"Only large followers"
Can defend the worshipers

I understood their concern
They had turned
Tables in the past
And changed the future very fast

The son killed father in power struggle
To ascend the throne with no troubles
This has strengthened their belief
"Only large following can provide relief"

They believe in forceful conversion
And compel them to adopt religion
Still medieval concept rules their mind
In doing so, only hatred has gained upper hand

See the blood shed of innocent people
They have nothing to with power struggle
They want peace and easy life passage
"Kindly spare us" they tearfully urge


What do we have
once kindness leaves? 
Slips out the door
to find new shelter
and be replaced by
burning hate  
which does permit
 no other gods
and, like a cancer
grows and thrives.
And like the cell
that is immortal
and able to consume
with greed
its host, who thinks
with little wisdom
and quotes his bible
and his friends
to show the world
his clean-scrubbed soul.

Will you, Physician
take the plug
the tubes and other, 
vital gadgets
away from even one, 
a human
and why have you
forsaken kindness, 
do you not prize
all life or is it that
you price it? 
Someone has to pay! 
It won't be you  
if you can help it, 
perhaps the payout
of poor Terri
will leave a bit for you
as well, and now
I don't have time
he says to me, 
discussions are
for futile moments, 
must rush to fly
to Rome just now
a human of significance
has been recalled 

It is so strange
that they forget
what that great Pope
had whispered when
him one hand
they both do value
all that lives.

The little boys 
who came with water
to sneak a drink 
to well-parched lips
were taken in
their handcuffs gleaming
where were you, Doctor
did you eat? 
Did you have water
or was it wine
that flowed
while Terri Schiavo died
and was the gist  
of your discussion
the future of the
public pension? 

Yes, you are private
like the Pope, 
and all the oldsters
are a burden
to families
to teenage mothers, 
we need to find
a way to end
their suffering, right
and that's a deal
they have no quality of life.

Yes, it comes down to
simple kindness
you either have it
or it's missing
that I encounter
no one like you
in my last hour. 

Kindness has a bitter taste
after being used to artificial like
Its soft and gooey nature
so easily mistaken just for slime

Soft and feathery to the touch
still hurts on feelings raw
It is a strange and funny thing, 
that the kindness of a stranger, should learn to scare me so. 

Kindness

Kindness is sacred domain
And remains
Till an end
With friends

But what about foes
It simply does not go
So well with this kind of people
And dislike is created for such individuals

But believe me 
It is free flow
And comes from secret heart chamber
That makes it easier

Not all people can practice
As it needs to improvise
And clean dirt from mind
Then only kindness can be found

But love and gesture
Makes it simply sure
You have tendency to be lenient
Towards animals, birds and mankind at present

You think simple and good
Stay calm with neighborhood
Offer assistance when needed 
And see that no disharmony is created


A stork built on the roof a nest, 
he had just recently been blessed 
with what he called his feathered dream: 
Long legs, a beak of crimson cream
and eyes to melt a stony heart.

His nest turned out a piece of art, 
he anchored it to sturdy bricks
with leaves and boysenberry sticks.
Soon, junior saw the light of day
he happily began to play.

Since even little storks have legs
that, once they've left their crowded eggs, 
can make light work of scary heights
and thus provide some awesome sights, 
so junior took a step due East, 
he wasn't frightened in the least.

His foot now reached the chimney's hole
where smoke arose from burning coal.
His eyes went teary, also blind
a gusty wind came from behind
and then he went, heels over head
into the chimney, nearly dead.
He landed with a bang and yell
in glowing ashes, thinking hell
had welcomed him and he assumed
that in this place he sure was doomed.

The man who was just eating lunch
looked over and he had a hunch, 
that something living had descended
and that his peaceful meal had ended.
He grabbed the stork and ran outside
while yelling to his sleepy bride, 
together they sprayed from the hose
much water from the pressure rose
until the stork took one deep breath
as now he knew he'd cheated death.

Right then, a worried, huge  white bird  
flew off the roof without a word.
He had assessed the situation
and did not want a confrontation.
He thanked the couple, then he turned, 
trailed by the moderately burned
and nervous junior when the man
said, 'Stork, I wonder if you can
repay our helpfulness in kind
I'll tell you what I have in mind. 
My wife has been on  I V F
yet all the gods must well be deaf, 
we've tried for years to have a boy
with hormones and extract of soy.

The stork conferred with his own wife
and since they'd saved their junior's life
they did their magic in their nest, 
and when the wind blew from the West
they dropped into the bed at night
a little boy to their delight.

Each year thereafter one new bird
was born up on that roof, my word.
And always in the nursery
soon after there again would be
a brand new child, as to remind
that it is godly to be kind. 

Kindness is an inward consciousness of right
and the art of being kind
is all the world needs. 

there is no duty more compulsory
than the repayment of kindness. 

it owes the smallest
obligation, costs nothing and requires no visible sacrifice
but if offered even in mustard seed size
as humanity's goal, could be
clouded temporarily yet sun-like would reappear
to blossom into a garden of kindness. 

it
lives beyond the memory of him who gives. 

a kindness
laden heart, contagious in itself, spreads and
passes it on and on and induces it
to branch out till it makes every thing
in the whole neighbourhood kindness minded. 

when
a whole region responds mutually with
smiles of kindness it becomes
its mother tongue. 

What in return of kindness we offer? 
Will it be blessings or simple murmur? 
Words may not simply fall or flow? 
If it is with affection face will always glow

May it be in form of kiss? 
Special offer and gesture from miss
I shall welcome it without any hiss
Who knows it may be real bliss 

I shall prefer to live alone
Even if no help from some one 
I must accept it with full joy
Even if that is offered with face decoy

Why so much noise is created? 
Is there not real love recreated? 
Do we sing when some one dear is cremated? 
Do we not shed tears even if lamented? 

How do we define it in terms and exactly? 
Message is conveyed properly and correctly
May it not look so neat and clean? 
As heart and mind act together and lean 

Why simple kiss creates hornet’s nest? 
Is it not the ideal to offer as best? 
Why at all it should give nuisance test? 
No gossips, no rumors and put them at rest

What difference it makes if offered on forehead
Love and true affection as if spread
All sentiments can simply be read 
Fragrance smells all over and spread

Lovers may take as warm welcome
Daughter may feel simply good and awesome
Wife to husband as emerging gesture
Happy moments with glittering future


Kindness when it is felt
Kindness is not when it is smelt 
Kindness is somewhat different
In behavior it is present

You can read in eyes
With hands you can try
With money you can show
With wind you can blow

Heart aches at somebody’s plight
It cries when not performed right 
It bleeds when someone has spoken badly 
It causes concern when not treated well really 

The heart is mild
But goes certainly wild
When atrocity is committed
When good things are omitted

Take goodness to one side
Trust and faith then you divide
There won’t be left like good matter
Let us not break our heart for better 

Suffer not a stroke
As heart break is no joke
So long it is mild, alright
Offer no cutter when not alrightwith love
give me your hand
some stranger
is fiction than truth

without love
I'm justa has
been away
too long in the tooth. 

You showed the way 
Marched ahead in time to stay 
for freedom and liberty 
that was always blessed by almighty

You had vision of non violence 
that was preached as golden chance 
Millions of people backed your move to face trouble 
you were an embodiment of classic struggle

You gave black people a hope 
'Never think to stop' 
If river stops water flow 
the bank on both sides cannot grow

As it happens with history to witness 
there is stiff challenge on face 
Racism is still on surface 
Violation of freedom is always chased

As opportunists have hijacked the movement 
there is still no loss of hope at this moment 
some of us may come forward to work for poor 
Blacks need not run from door to door

Blacks are discriminated against 
Still other people disown them and insist 
the practice of racism that existed earlier 
and continued thereafter 

Peace may be still dream ahead 
but message is not clearly read 
the danger still exists in its original form 
and relation between white and blacks remain not warm 

The blacks may suffer 
for the want of good offer 
they may be treated rough 
for some more years and remain cut off

History is the witness 
People had lot more troubles to face 
they were subjected to prison torture 
There was no hope for bight for future

Nowhere in the world 
the blacks have suffered so much misery 
the curse has fallen on them for no reason 
they are really good, tolerant and reasonable persons

Slaves are always meant for hard work 
there is no consideration for good words 
they stood in public eyes as useless creatures 
Color was always against their future 

The world was hopeful of new light 
There was end of an inequality and was certainly in sight 
Right people have always condemned discrimination 
It was beginning new and good relation

'Long live O, messiah of peace' 
You were on toes and never at an ease 
your life ended with one deadly bullet 
we, the black people, shall always resent

Peace march may remain on 
the last hurdle may be crossed over and battle won
the nation may thrive along with inspiration 
the bond may exist for strong relation

The world may soon witness new era 
New generation may heave a sigh with benefits extra 
There will no more anguish and pain 
The sacrifice shall not go in vain


It was ten years ago when the belle of the village
Gave here her hand to the young millionaire,
Every toungue (even those of the bells in the steeple)
Saying "Joy to the Heav'n-blest pair!"
She was sweet as the rosebud that blooms in the valley;
He was manly, and noble, and brave.
Tell me, where are they now?
In the sad-eyed procession,
Marching, down, down, down to the grave.

Hark! hark! a pageant passes
(tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp):
I hear the tread of moving masses
(tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp)
O Heaven save our young men --
'tis King Bibler's Army,
Marching down, down, down to the grave.

At the head of the boat are the dashing lieutenants
Who entice young recruits into line;
Arm in arm, three abreast, they keep step with the music,
Bearing goblets of blood red wine.
In the rear, by and by, we shall see them together,
As they stagger along on the pave,
With their wives and their children, a rag-robed procession,
Marching, down, down, down to the grave.

From the front to the rear is the rule of promotion
In the army King Bibler commands;
And the pension is pov'rty, disease and dishonor,
With a forfeit of home and lands.
So the friend that was treated to cordials and juleps,
Will be treated at last like a slave,
As he fags at the end of the chaingang procession,
Marching, down, down, down to the grave.

Would you fill up the ranks? let your town send its quota:
Seventy thousand recruits must be found,
For the gravediggers reckon they bury that number
Every year in the cold, cold ground.
Yet the rest hobble on, and the colors they carry,
Though in tatters, triumphantly wave,
For they vanquish themselves in this madman's procession,

dNfcgNcBgNfd(inspired by Bobby Fischer)KING CANUTE was weary hearted; he had reigned for years a score,
Battling, struggling, pushing, fighting, killing much and robbing more;
And he thought upon his actions, walking by the wild sea-shore.

'Twixt the Chancellor and Bishop walked the King with steps sedate,
Chamberlains and grooms came after, silversticks and goldsticks great,
Chaplains, aides-de-camp, and pages,—all the officers of state.

Sliding after like his shadow, pausing when he chose to pause,
If a frown his face contracted, straight the courtiers dropped their jaws;
If to laugh the king was minded, out they burst in loud hee-haws.

But that day a something vexed him, that was clear to old and young:
Thrice his Grace had yawned at table, when his favorite gleemen sung,

'Something ails my gracious master,' cried the Keeper of the Seal.
'Sure, my lord, it is the lampreys served to dinner, or the veal?'
'Psha!' exclaimed the angry monarch, 'Keeper, 'tis not that I feel.

''Tis the HEART, and not the dinner, fool, that doth my rest impair:
Can a king be great as I am, prithee, and yet know no care?
Oh, I'm sick, and tired, and weary.'—Some one cried, 'The King's arm-chair!'

Straight the King's great chair was brought him, by two footmen able-bodied;
Languidly he sank into it: it was comfortably wadded.

'Leading on my fierce companions,' cried he, 'over storm and brine,
I have fought and I have conquered! Where was glory like to mine?'
Loudly all the courtiers echoed: 'Where is glory like to thine?'

'What avail me all my kingdoms? Weary am I now and old;
Those fair sons I have begotten, long to see me dead and cold;
Would I were, and quiet buried, underneath the silent mould!

'Oh, remorse, the writhing serpent! at my bosom tears and bites;
Horrid, horrid things I look on, though I put out all the lights;
Ghosts of ghastly recollections troop about my bed at nights.

'Cities burning, convents blazing, red with sacrilegious fires;
Mothers weeping, virgins screaming vainly for their slaughtered sires.—'
Such a tender conscience,' cries the Bishop, 'every one admires.

'But for such unpleasant bygones, cease, my gracious lord, to search,
They're forgotten and forgiven by our Holy Mother Church;
Never, never does she leave her benefactors in the lurch.

'Look! the land is crowned with minsters, which your Grace's bounty raised;
Abbeys filled with holy men, where you and Heaven are daily praised:
YOU, my lord, to think of dying? on my conscience I'm amazed!'

'Nay, I feel,' replied King Canute, 'that my end is drawing near.'
'Don't say so,' exclaimed the courtiers (striving each to squeeze a tear).
'Sure your Grace is strong and lusty, and may live this fifty year.'

'Live these fifty years!' the Bishop roared, with actions made to suit.
Men have lived a thousand years, and sure his Majesty will do't.

'Adam, Enoch, Lamech, Cainan, Mahaleel, Methusela,
Lived nine hundred years apiece, and mayn't the King as well as they?'
'Fervently,' exclaimed the Keeper, 'fervently I trust he may.'

'HE to die?' resumed the Bishop. He a mortal like to US?
Death was not for him intended, though communis omnibus:
Keeper, you are irreligious, for to talk and cavil thus.

'With his wondrous skill in healing ne'er a doctor can compete,
Loathsome lepers, if he touch them, start up clean upon their feet;
Surely he could raise the dead up, did his Highness think it meet.

'Did not once the Jewish captain stay the sun upon the hill,
And, the while he slew the foemen, bid the silver moon stand still?
So, no doubt, could gracious Canute, if it were his sacred will.'

'Might I stay the sun above us, good sir Bishop?' Canute cried;
'Could I bid the silver moon to pause upon her heavenly ride?
If the moon obeys my orders, sure I can command the tide.

'Will the advancing waves obey me, Bishop, if I make the sign?'
Said the Bishop, bowing lowly, 'Land and sea, my lord, are thine.'
Canute turned towards the ocean—'Back!' he said, 'thou foaming brine.

'From the sacred shore I stand on, I command thee to retreat;
Venture not, thou stormy rebel, to approach thy master's seat:
Ocean, be thou still! I bid thee come not nearer to my feet!'

But the sullen ocean answered with a louder, deeper roar,
And the rapid waves drew nearer, falling sounding on the shore;
Back the Keeper and the Bishop, back the king and courtiers bore.

And he sternly bade them never more to kneel to human clay,
But alone to praise and worship That which earth and seas obey:
And his golden crown of empire never wore he from that day.
King Canute is dead and gone: Parasites exist alway. 

My mind now moves to distant places.
I'm walking the streets of Elsinore,
through its squares, and I recall
the very sad story-
that unfortunate king
killed by his nephew
because of some fanciful suspicions.
In all the homes of the poor
he was mourned secretly
(they were afraid of Fortinbras).
A quiet, gentle man,
a man who loved peace
(his country had suffered much
from the wars of his predecessor),
he behaved graciously toward everyone,
humble and great alike.
Never high-handed, he always sought advice
in the kingdom's affairs
from serious, experienced people.
Just why his nephew killed him
was never actually explained.
The prince suspected him of murder,
and the basis of his suspicion was this:
walking one night along an ancient battlement
he thought he saw a ghost
and he had a conversation with this ghost;
what he supposedly heard from the ghost
were certain accusations against the king.
It must have been a fit of fancy,
an optical illusion
(the prince was nervous in the extreme;
while he was studying at Wittenberg,
many of his fellow students thought him a maniac).
A few days later he went
to his mother's room to discuss
certain family affairs. And suddenly,
while he was talking, he lost his self-control,
started shouting, screaming
that the ghost was there in front of him.
But his mother saw nothing at all.
And that same day, for no apparent reason,
he killed an old gentleman of the court.
Since the prince was due to sail for England
in a day or two,
the king hustled him off post-haste
in order to save him.
But the people were so outraged
by the monstrous murder
that rebels rose up
and tried to storm the palace gates,
led by the dead man's son,
the noble lord Laertes
(a brave young man, also ambitious;
in the confusion, some of his friends called out:
'Long live King Laertes!').
Later, once the kingdom had calmed down
and the king was lying in his grave-
he was killed by his nephew, the prince,
who never went to England
but escaped from the ship on his way there-
a certain Horatio came forward
and tried to exonerate the prince
by telling some stories of his own.
He said that the voyage to England
had been a secret plot, and orders
had been given to kill the prince there
(but this was never clearly ascertained).
He also spoke of poisoned wine-
wine poisoned by the king.
It's true that Laertes spoke of this too.
But couldn't he have been lying?
Couldn't he have been mistaken?
And when did he say all this?
While dying of his wounds, his mind reeling,
his talk seemingly delirious.
As for the poisoned weapons,
it was shown later that the poisoning
hadn't been done by the king at all:
Laertes himself had done it.
But Horatio, whenever pressed,
would produce even the ghost as a witness:
the ghost said this and that,
the ghost did this and that!
Because of all this, though letting Horatio talk,
most people in their hearts
pitied the poor king,
who, with all these ghosts and fairy tales,
was unjustly killed and disposed of.
Yet Fortinbras, who profited
by winning the throne so easily,
gave full attention and weight
to every word Horatio said. 

Said Jove within himself one day,
‘I'll make me a mistress out of clay!
These ninefold spheres of chiming quires,
Though little things and therefore sweet,
My pleasure still is incomplete.
The gust of love is mystery,
Which poorly yet the heavens supply. 
Save in the earthly, small, and weak?
My work, then, let me crown and end
With what I ne'er shall comprehend!’
And so the unfathomable Need,
Hell's mock, Heaven's pity, was decreed.
And, with perversity immense
As all his other affluence,
Jove left his wondering Court behind
And Juno's almost equal mind,
On low and little Earth to seek
That vessel infinitely weak,
(The abler for the infinite honour
He hugely long'd to put upon her,)
And, in a melancholy grove,
Found sighing his predestined Love,
A pretty, foolish, pensive maid,
The least of heaven-related things,
Of every boy and beast afraid,
But not of him, the King of Kings.
He look'd so measurelessly mild,
And so he flatter'd her, poor child,
By lifting with respect her hand
To his salute benign and grand,
That, when he spoke, and begged to be
Instructed in her wishes, she,
Having a modest minute tarried,
Lisp'd, ‘I should like, Sire, to be married.’
But, when he smiling ask'd, ‘Whom to?’
She blush'd and said, she scarcely knew.
To her free choice; for all such things
Were his and his to give; but these
She shook her curls at. ‘Hard to please
Is my small Cousin, but my nod

Thereat Jove laugh'd: ‘As least of things
Alone can sate the King of Kings,
So the least thing, it seems, that I
And, fading in her flushing arms,
He blazed for ever from her charms.
Thenceforth the maiden sang and shone,
Admired by all and woo'd by none,
For, though she said she was a sinner,
'Twas clear to all that Jove was in her,
And, but for that deep pagan night,
She would have been a Carmelite. 

When the Macedonians deserted him
and showed they preferred Pyrrhos,
King Dimitrios (a noble soul) didn't behave
-so they said-
at all like a king.
He took off his golden robes,
threw away his purple buskins,
and quickly dressing himself
in simple clothes, he slipped out-
just like an actor who,
the play over,
changes his costume and goes away. 

The sun
pinks trees of peach
and purples the grapes
as he pumps and plumps
the orange pumpkin vine 

He makes gold the pear
blackens the berries
browns acorn pairs
paints crimson the cherries

He oranges the oranges
and limes the limes
spraying aqua the silent
bluebell chimes. 

There is no shift in stand
We know and clearly understand
Love never fails human beings
It makes people happy to enjoy and sing

Love is spontaneous
That makes even cruel to inhale
Feel for nearness and exhale
It is altogether different tale 

Love has turned inhuman to human
From ruthless person to gentleman 
Woman is turned into caring person
She breathes for sure with many reasons 

Love is to rule and love is to guide
Love is to bring together and love is to divide
Love turns a place into heaven
It has no force behind but self driven 

Choose to sail with sea waves
Sit on air wing to crave for
Love may make you worthy of being
King or ordinary, everybody may sing


Viswamitra the Magician,
By his spells and incantations,
Up to Indra's realms elysian
Raised Trisanku, king of nations. 

Indra and the gods offended
Hurled him downward, and descending
In the air he hung suspended,
With these equal powers contending. 

Thus by aspirations lifted,
By misgivings downward driven,
Human hearts are tossed and drifted
Midway between earth and heaven. 

Say, darkeys, hab you seen de massa,
Wid de muffstash on his face,
Go long de road some time dis mornin',
Like he gwine to leag de place?
He seen a smoke, way up de ribber,
Whar de Linkum gumboats lay;
He took his hat, an' lef berry sudden,
An' I spec he's run away!

De massa run? ha, ha!
De darkey stay? ho, ho!
It mus' be now de kingdom comin',
An' de year of Jubilo!

He six foot one way, two foot tudder,
An' he weigh tree hundred pound,
His coat so big, he couldn't pay de tailor,
An' it won't go half way round.
He drill so much they call him Cap'an,
An' he get so drefful tann'd,
I spec he try an' fool dem Yankees
For to tink he's contraband.

De darkey's feel so lonesome libing
in de loghouse on de lawn,
Dey move dar things to massa's parlor
For to keep it while he's gone.
Dar's wine an' cider in de kitchen,
An' de darkey's dey'll hab some;
I spose dey'll all be cornfiscated
When de Linkum sojers come.

De oberseer he make us trouble,
An' he dribe us round a spell;
We lock him up in de smokehouse cellar,
Wid de key trown in de well.
De whip is lost, de han'cuff broken,
But de massa'll hab his pay;
He's ole enough, big enough, ought to known better
Dan to went an' run away. 

In the dawn of the day when the sea and the earth
Reflected the sunrise above,
I set forth with a heart full of courage and mirth
To seek for the Kingdom of Love.
I asked of a Poet I met on the way
Which cross-road would lead me aright.
And he said: "Follow me, and not long you shall see
Its glittering turrets of light
 


And soon in the distance a city shone fair,
"Look yonder," he said; "how it gleams!"
But alas! for the hopes that were doomed to despair,
It was only the "Kingdom of Dreams

"
Then the next man I asked was a gay Cavalier,
And he said: "Follow me, follow me;"
And with laughter and song we went speeding along
By the shores of Life's beautiful sea. 

Then we came to a valley more tropical far
Than the wonderful vale of Cashmere,
And I saw from a bower a face like a flower
Smile out on the gay Cavalier.
And he said: "We have come to humanity's goal:
Here love and delight are intense

"
But alas and alas! for the hopes of my soul
It was only the "Kingdom of Sense
 


As I journeyed more slowly I met on the road
A coach with retainers behind.
And they said: "Follow me, for our Lady's abode
Belongs in that realm, you will find

"
'Twas a grand dame of fashion, a newly made bride,
I followed, encouraged and bold;
But my hopes died away like the last gleams of day,
For we came to the "Kingdom of Gold
 


At the door of a cottage I asked a fair maid.
"I have heard of that realm," she replied;
"But my feet never roam from the "Kingdom of Home,"
So I know not the way," and she sighed.
I looked on the cottage; how restful it seemed!
And the maid was as fair as a dove.
Great light glorified my soul as I cried:
"Why home is the 'Kingdom of Love!'"On old Brandywine-- about
Where White's Lots is now laid out,
And the old crick narries down
To the ditch that splits the town--,
Kingry's Mill stood. Hardly see
Where the old dam ust to be;
Shallor, long, dry trought o' grass
Where the old race ust to pass!

That's be'n forty years ago--
Forty years o' frost and snow--
Forty years o' shade and shine
Sence them boyhood-days o' mine--!
All the old landmarks o' town.
Changed about, er rotted down!
Where's the Tanyard? Where's the Still?
Tell me where's old Kingry's Mill?

Don't seem furder back, to me,
I'll be dogg'd! Than yisterd'y,
Since us fellers, in bare feet
And straw hats, went through the wheat,
Cuttin' 'crost the shortest shoot
Fer that-air old ellum root
Jest above the mill-dam-- where
The blame' cars now crosses there!

Through the willers down the crick
We could see the old mill stick
Its red gable up, as if
It jest knowed we'd stol'd the skiff!
See the winders in the sun
Blink like they wuz wonderun'
What the miller ort to do
With sich boys as me and you!

But old Kingry--! Who could fear
That old chap, with all his cheer--?
Leanin' at the window-sill,
Er the half-door o' the mill,
Swoppin' lies, and pokin' fun,
'N jigglin' like his hoppers done--
Laughin' grists o' gold and red
Right out o' the wagon-bed!

What did he keer where we went--?
'Jest keep out o' devilment,
And don't fool around the belts,
Bolts, ner burrs, ner nothin' else
'Bout the blame machinery,
And that's all I ast!' says-ee.
Then we'd climb the stairs, and play
In the bran-bins half the day!

Rickollect the dusty wall,
And the spider-webs, and all!
Rickollect the trimblin' spout
Where the meal come josslln' out--
Stand and comb yer fingers through
The fool-truck an hour er two--
Felt so sorto' warm-like and
Soothin' to a feller's hand!

Climb, high up above the stream,
And 'coon' out the wobbly beam
And peek down from out the lof'
Where the weather-boards was off--
Gee-mun-nee! w'y, it takes grit
Even jest to think of it--!
Lookin' 'way down there below
On the worter roarin' so!

Rickollect the flume, and wheel,
And the worter slosh and reel
And jest ravel out in froth
Flossier'n satin cloth!
Rickollect them paddles jest
Knock the bubbles galley-west,
And plunge under, and come up
Drippin' like a worter-pup!

And to see them old things gone
That I onc't was bettin' on,
In rale p'int o' fact, I feel
kindo' like that worter-wheel--,
Sorto' drippy-like and wet
Round the eyes-- but paddlin' yet,
And in mem'ry, loafin' still
Down around old Kingry's Mill

The summer like a rajah dies,
And every widowed tree
Kindles for Congregationalist eyes
An alien suttee. 

Driving down the highway, 
In her brand new Porsche, 
Big sunglasses on, 
Her silk scarf blowing in the wind.

A bag of money, 
In the back seat, 
The zip is down, 
She leaves a cloud of money.

Her jewelled hands, 
Clutch the leather wheel, 
Her big white teeth, 
Grin through her big red lips.

The brakes malfunction, 
And the car flips, 
A cloud of dust and dollars, 
Her silk blood stained scarf billows in the wind.

Kiss me and quiet my heart, 
I never once asked for a letter, 
Stating you wanted to part.

Kiss me and declare you were wrong dear, 
Kiss me and confirm it's okay, 
Say all those things that I so want to hear, 
And wipe all my tears away.

Kiss me and let's stay together, 
Kiss me and pour out the wine, 
Sit with me on my sofa of leather, 
And say that everything will be fine.

Kiss me and tell me you love me, 
Kiss me with passion to spare, 
Don't think of leaving, that is my plea
And also my ardent prayer.

Kiss me, I need you so deeply, 
Kiss me, what more can I say, 
But with reality looming before me, 
This dream has just melted away.


Don't stay afar pouting your lips at me like a rosebud;
I asked you for a kiss--let your lips answer my plea. 

Kiss me without saying anything, 
Kiss me until I forget this world, 
Kiss me with rage, we may not get another minute
Tomorrow I may emigrate without knowing where

Kiss me without saying anything, 
Kiss me in top of my desire
Kiss me on my sweet cheeks
Tomorrow I may leave witout knwing where

Kiss me until the dawn arrives, 
Kiss me with limitless passion, 
Kiss me at the bride of glory, 
Kiss me. . Just Kiss me

Kiss me without saying anything

Cos 

TOMORROW I DON'T KNOW WHERE I WILL BE


Love


Sounds very Simple to do, 
To Kiss me Quick
But your Love must be True
And to catch me, is the Trick

When our lips do Meet
I know it will be such a Treat
For me as well as You
Nice and wet like the Morning Dew

Lips twisting and Turning
For more defiantly Yearning
And I'll probably want a Lot
Once I have Been Caught


Kissing is an art, one most master
Kissing slowly is better than faster

Kiss me slowly
Kiss me tenderly
Kiss me sweetly

Kiss me on the lips
Down to my finger tips

Delicately sample my nipples
Kiss it, tease it, rather simple

When done right, let me be precise
Kissing itself can be rather very nice

Kiss me slowly
Kiss me tenderly
Kiss me sweetly

Kiss my body inch by inch
Till it tickles and starts to flinch

Kiss me in the left and right ear
Whisper sweet words of passionate care

Kiss me by the neck
With little kisses called pecks

Kiss me hungrily in the mouth
Hear my groaning delicious shouts

Kiss me below and yonder
Till my juices begin to ponder
And turn on fire with desire

Kiss me slowly
Kiss me tenderly
Kiss me sweetly
Kiss me once, twice, thrice
Oooo! These kisses are very nice

Penetrate me and make me complete.
Kiss each and every corners of my soul.
When you enter kiss my half closed eyelids, 
Softly touch my eyebrows, 
Lick my forehead, 
Suck me out into a world of passion.
Take me by hand from the world of dreams
To the world real, full of charming smiles

Check the radiance on my nose and wet lips
Look deep into my soul and try to kiss my soul
Go down deep inside my soul
Until you find the endless depths.
Travel  to conquer 
The unconquerable depths.

O be mine! 
i know comfort of the mind and soul
It rains in me, 
and  i am happy. 

pale skin
within the night
will cause
such a fright

glass nails
upon your skin
making you cringe

breath of death
softly crawling up your chest
calming and confusing
your mind is lost

teeth sink into your neck 
pain and pleasure connect
now you lay forever in rest(Approaching, No tobacco day)   

Pale faced sit at the radiologist's den, 
eyeing him scribble a Montblanc pen.

Pondering days as a macho man
bare regard for the smoking ban

Delightful puff after a belly brunch.
Crushing packs in amusing scrunch.

Awe struck watch the luring adds.
Tobacco ones then carry home wads.

Take you pride in the trick and flick.
Single handed jerk and fancy slick.

Misplaced passion, you kiss the stub.
For mindless arson, you have a club.

Buy fancy tit-bits for the scourge.
A wilting wife who needs more rouge.

Lit up fags on the barest hunch.
Care a fig for the angel bunch.

A gift, little ones, to this world.
How they smile, asleep an curled.

These flowers; pl don’t hurt no more.
Let the air they breathe be pure.

Care an shield the expectant ones.
Stop spewing circles an your puns.

Allow your elders fresh air to breathe
Already for air they long and seethe

Off the bus and everyone heaves.
Wish he’s gone an forever leaves.

Scant your regard for their sighs.
Deep down burn their smarting eyes.

Pain and strain your friendly tie.
Till, you from cancer, one day die.


(May Your beauty overwhelms me
As I wrap my arms around you
I press your softness tight
Great passion fills my inner being
I'm captured in your embrace
Your eyes control my very soul
The touch of your lips, heaven
Forever frozen in time
All else fades into nothing

Kiss the dirt I wilted on; 
Waited, I, on thee.
Now I've bloomed another Doom, 
But never pity me. 

My wife was out of town for a week.  It was time to have a treat.
So I took a cab to my favorite bistro to have myself a bite to eat.
It was as I prepared to return home that I glanced at a corner table.
I tried to pry my eyes away from her, but found I was not able.

What had caught my eye was candlelight reflecting from a silver gown, 
worn by one forbidden to me since the aisle I walked my new bride down.
a young innocent, creamy-smooth-skinned morsel to which my body was driven.

I tried with all my might to resist this newly-found temptation, 
But, alas, I believe it was too much dinner wine that was leading me to damnation.
The craving was too much for me; I felt like a child in Toy Land.
I warily approached her table, looked about, then took her in my hand.

I undressed her with my eyes during our ride to the hotel.
That I was in danger of disrupting my marriage, I could surely tell.
I ordered up a suite on the top floor, for myself and my forbidden sweet, 
but I did not allow myself to indulge, until I'd pulled up our bed sheet.
My mouth was watering with desire, my lips were slightly held apart.
At last I consumed what my wife had forbidden, but which for years I'd craved with all my heart.

Until that moment she'd remained enclosed, in her silver gown.
I removed her wrapper and pulled her to my mouth, sucked repeatedly, and finally swallowed her down.
(Nov. 

[. . 

alternate ending, starting at "then took her in my hand

". ]: 

The ride through the dark streets was anxiety-filled, yet quiet.
I could wait no longer.  I undressed her there and popped her in my mouth.  There went a twelve-year diet.



(Nov. 
(The KISS was a foil-
wrapped hershey kiss.)The mist adorns the nestling hills, 
and on the air, one hears the trills, 
of the waking birds, as one and all, 
give out their melodious morning call.

A hush descends across the scene, 
where one can effortlessly glean
a sense of peace and tranquil calm, 
a kind of comfort, a kind of balm, 
that slowly seeps into one's soul.

And then an adventurous nosy mole, 
is glimpsed, emerging from his hole, 
in this so quiet and peaceful knoll.

A nest of robins greet the sun, 
and paint the day with colours spun, 
proudly displaying their blood red breasts, 
against the green leaves. Then on the crest
now, is seen the rabbits, venturing abroad, 
standing regimental, as with one accord, 
they quickly sniff the new and freshening air, 
each one alert to trouble, fully aware.

What beauty here, what a fine ethereal view, 
kissed with affection by the morning dew.

Once framed a rich elixer of delight.
A chalice o'er love-kindled flames he fixed,
And in it nectar and ambrosia mixed:
With these the magic dews which evening brings,
Brushed from the Idalian star by fairy wings:
Each tender pledge of sacred faith he joined,
Each gentler pleasure of th' unspotted mind-- 
Day-dreams, whose tints with sportive brightness glow,
And hope, the blameless parasite of woe.
The eyeless chemist heard the process rise,
The steamy chalice bubbled up in sighs;
Sweet sounds transpired as when the enamoured dove
Pours the soft murmuring of responsive love.
The finished work might envy vainly blame,
And 'kisses' was the precious compound's name.
With half, the god his Cyprian mother blest,
And breathed on Sara's lovelier lips the rest. 

Your dress is fluttering
In the wind
- Kiss

I like it when you lie
In the sun
- Kiss

I'd forgotten the perfume
You wore this morning
- Kiss

Yesterday we had so much
Fun
- Kiss

Kisses are misses
- Kiss
Come back again












I once heard these words in a song; 
'You must remember this.  

a kiss is
just a kiss.  

a sigh is just a sigh, ' etc.

With you.  

nothing.  

nothing, could be
further from the truth.

Your kiss, is a ride among the stars, 
a shower of moon beams and a
sailboat ride, in the Garden Of Eden.

Kissing you.  

is an out of body experience, 
a transport to paradise and a creation
of ultimate passion and joy.

Kissing, every part of who you are, is
truly a banquet of love.

Let me feast of your love and of your lips, 
for I am in love with you. Let me always
kiss your mouth.  

eyes.  

all of you.

Let us ride the feathers of angels, through
starlit nights-holding.  

kissing, for now. 
and evermore.

Your kiss.  

touch.  

embrace, has captured
my heart.  

my very soul.

I send you this kiss.  

for the lips
I can not do without.

losing you. Losing your love.
I wish that you never stopped loving me.
I wish I could have kept you by my side.

I just didn't know how.
I wish I knew what to say, that would make you stay.
Try as I might.  

I just could not find the words.

So it is, I shall forever wonder; 
Do you ever wonder, where our love had gone? 
Do you ever wish, of days gone by? 
Tell me my sweet.  

my love. 
'Do you think of me.  

as I have thought of you? 
for the rain, 
try to ponder 

  
It Is a clash of the clouds 
It is kisses of the thunder 

  

try to ponder 
From summser born the winter 

to be continued


And don't you move  even an inch! 
We're getting ready - this is serious.
Don't blink, don't breathe, don't think, don't flinch.
Just stand there Darling, look imperious.

As I'm about to pull you close, 
my arms around you, sturdy grip.
The closest thing to a red rose
is your sweet mouth, your blood-red lips.

This lesson, once it's fully learned, 
it must be practiced every day.
Until your stripes are fully earned, 
but let's continue, if I may.

Please slightly open now a fraction, 
if things are dry it matters little.
To get a certain satisfaction
you'll need saliva, so-called spittle.

And thus, we slobbered, wet and sweet, 
both warming with the task.
Such pleasure - it is hard to beat.
'When can we go again' you ask.

I quickly learn that to ensure
this lovely pastime many times a day, 
one simply uses this, well. . 

cheeky lure: 
I say that her technique -  it isn't quite okay. 

Kisses upon kisses
Teases upon teases

Certain madness fills the air
It is termed as love I fear

Kisses upon kisses
Teases upon teases
Touches upon touches

My hearts broken pieces
Are once again at peace

Kisses upon kisses
Teases upon teases
Touches upon touches
Flattery upon Flattery
Love always sparkles without batteries

Lips upon lips
First a taste of your tongues tip
Admiration induces exploration
While love ignites imagination

I can feel your kissing power
And the sensational effect it showers
I can feel your kissing power
As you handle me like a delicate flower

Week legs
Pleasure begs
I can feel your kissing power
While you kiss me by the hour

Don't stop! 
Be my hero not my flop

O heart of mine, we shouldn't
Worry so!
What we've missed of calm we couldn't
Have, you know!
What we've met of stormy pain,
And of sorrow's driving rain,
We can better meet again,
If it blow!

We have erred in that dark hour
We have known,
When our tears fell with the shower,
All alone!--
Were not shine and shadow blent
As the gracious Master meant?--
Let us temper our content
With His own.

For, we know, not every morrow
Can be sad;
So, forgetting all the sorrow
We have had,
Let us fold away our fears,
And put by our foolish tears,
And through all the coming years
Just be glad.

'T is when the lark goes soaring
And the bee is at the bud,
When lightly dancing zephyrs
Sing over field and flood;
When all sweet things in nature
Seem joyfully achime -
'T is then I wake my darling,
For it is kissing time!

Go, pretty lark, a-soaring,
And suck your sweets, bee;
Sing, ye winds of summer,
Your songs to mine and me;
For with your song and rapture
Cometh the moment when
It's half-past kissing time
And time to kiss again!

So - so the days go fleeting
Like golden fancies free,
And every day that cometh
Is full of sweets for me;
And sweetest are those moments
My darling comes to climb
Into my lap to mind me
That it is kissing time.

Sometimes, maybe, he wanders
A heedless, aimless way -
Sometimes, maybe, he loiters
In pretty, prattling play;
But presently bethinks him
And hastens to me then,
For it's half-past kissing time
And time to kiss again

Spring verve: 
Yellow spray, 
Pointillistic
Whites at play
With red 
In splash n dash -

The bounce 
Of on-and-off upon 
A monotone of green. 

Cooling into focus, 
Daffodils court, 
Sniffing at the daisy; 

We're all bought! -
Cissy-colour crazy! 

Fountain fresh, 
We're kissing to the air -

We never seem to care
When colour sings.

She is the vessels on the table before her:
the copper pot tipped toward us, the white pitcher
clutched in her hand, the black one edged in red
and upside down. Bent over, she is the mortar
and the pestle at rest in the mortar—still angled
in its posture of use. She is the stack of bowls
and the bulb of garlic beside it, the basket hung
by a nail on the wall and the white cloth bundled
in it, the rag in the foreground recalling her hand.
She's the stain on the wall the size of her shadow—
the color of blood, the shape of a thumb. She is echo
his white corona, her white cap. Listening, she leans
into what she knows. Light falls on half her face. 


Oh Hubshee, carry your shoes in your hand and bow your head on your breast!
This is the message of Kitchener who did not break you in jest.
It was permitted to him to fulfil the long-appointed years;
Reaching the end ordained of old over your dead Emirs.

He stamped only before your walls, and the Tomb ye knew was dust:
He gathered up under his armpits all the swords of your trust:
He set a guard on your granaries, securing the weak from the strong:
He said: -- "Go work the waterwheels that were abolished so long


He said: -- "Go safely, being abased. I have accomplished my vow

"
That was the mercy of Kitchener. Cometh his madness now!
He does not desire as ye desire, nor devise as ye devise:
He is preparing a second host -- an army to make you wise.

Not at the mouth of his clean-lipped guns shall ye learn his name again,
But letter by letter, from Kaf to Kaf, at the mouths of his chosen men.
He has gone back to his own city, not seeking presents or bribes,
But openly asking the English for money to buy you Hakims and scribes.

Knowing that ye are forfeit by battle and have no right to live,
He begs for money to bring you learning -- and all the English give.
It is their treasure -- it is their pleasure -- thus are their hearts inclined:

They do not consider the Meaning of


Things; they consult not creed nor clan.
Behold, they clap the slave on the back, and behold, he ariseth a man!
They terribly carpet the earth with dead, and before their cannon cool,
They walk unarmed by twos and threes to call the living to school.

How is this reason (which is their reason) to judge a scholar's worth,
By casting a ball at three straight sticks and defending the same with a fourth?
But this they do (which is doubtless a spell) and other matters more strange,
Until, by the operation of years, the hearts of their scholars change:

Till these make come and go great boats or engines upon the rail
(But always the English watch near by to prop them when they fail);
Till these make laws of their own choice and Judges of their
And all the mad English obey the Judges and say that that Law is good.

Certainly they were mad from of old; but I think one new thing,
That the magic whereby they work their magic -- wherefrom their fortunes spring --
May be that they show all peoples their magic and ask no price in return.
Wherefore, since ye are bond to that magic, O Hubshee, make haste and learn!

Certainly also is Kitchener mad. But one sure thing I know --
If he who broke you be minded to teach you, to his Madrissa go!
Go, and carry your shoes in your hand and bow your head on your breast,
For he who did not slay you in sport, he will not teach you in jest. 

We are things of dry hours and the involuntary plan, 
Grayed in, and gray. "Dream" mate, a giddy sound, not strong 
Like "rent", "feeding a wife", "satisfying a man". 

But could a dream sent up through onion fumes 
Its white and violet, fight with fried potatoes 
And yesterday's garbage ripening in the hall, 
Flutter, or sing an aria down these rooms, 

Even if we were willing to let it in, 
Had time to warm it, keep it very clean, 
Anticipate a message, let it begin? 

We wonder. But not well! not for a minute! 
Since Number Five is out of the bathroom now, 

There pegged the eyes on the paper keel, 
and you backwards running to get it at the air
hand-over-hand loosening the line to pull the kite aloft, 
pulling in on the line  a bit of tension to provide
and that disobedient thing in stubborn denial to be kept airborne, 
to twist the wheel, oscillate in hammock's and seesaw's rythm
untill finally once again  to land  in shame on the soil.

''Check the bridles lest it does not equilibrate, 
put on, cut off some paper, ribbon to form better the tail, 
add, remove some strips of this or that material
for better weighting, buoyancy.
In case of  sufficient wind, 
they all  then synchronized will lift it off.''

And you to stay boubtful, to wonder
what were the intentions of the advise! 
Again on the tryout, to see it gaining altitude, 
hovering unsteady, ready to flutter steady for your joy's sake, 
but again to twist, to turn, to dive, or  just  keep the  breath of its fly.

''Wind the string up properly, wrap the line around the spool
in the tension to stay up, pull on the line hard..
Leave, leave it, it tossed away, you don't see. ''

And around the little chapel on the hill of  St. Elia
where customary we used to meet on Monday the Green 
all sort of voices were sounded, heard: 
admonishment, exhortations, hurrahs, 

But when lucky to see your kite gaining the decisive altitude, 
dangling in smooth flight's rule, 
not being in danger by  any wind's blow, harsh or weak, 
to have definitely avoid the disgraceful landing, 
your hands' multicoloured hope be launched at last, 
watching it shrink to mere dot at its zenith
thrilled by the successful soar
you let your mind soar too with it
in the heavenly perspectives
and untiring for hours on the hill, 
you were navigating high up in the air
the proud flag of your skill. 

When you lift me high
Higher than the highest note
No one can hear me

With winds for wings
And eyes for notes
I play with long lost kites

And yours is doing all right




This picture, this story
This poem and you	
My creations with 
No artistic value


Kitten
Suddenly you appeared 
In our lives, so unexpectedly
You brought a little excitement
Into our lives, disturbed the balance
Of emotions
To me
It felt like
Reincarnation, 
Or Dejà-vu, of my pet
From teenage years - same nutty colour
Just like him, you would seek me out
Wherever I was, and jump up
On my bed, for example, 
From under the covers
I would feel your feet treading gently
All the way up my legs, 
My body, and as you came closer -
That Purr! 
A little engine
Getting louder and louder
As you zoned in on my head, 
My face, you always wanted to be
As close as possible to the life of me
And you would nuzzle in, 
Get comfortable in
My hair
That purr! 
It stirred my heart
I cannot explain the effect
It had on me. And multiply that
By four for each member of the family
For you everything was a wonder
You startled at new sounds
And chased ping pong balls around
You slept on the boys' chests
So they wouldn't move
You made them soft
And then
As suddenly as you had come
You were gone.

Your food dish is still there
A few stray pellets that got scattered
Your water, your bed, your smell
And a few surprise packages
You left around the house
Because you were still learning
But not you
Kitty - we miss you


Kleitos, a likeable young man,
about twenty-three years old
with a first-class education, a rare knowledge of Greek
is seriously ill. He caught the fever
that reaped a harvest this year in Alexandria.
The fever found him already worn out morally
by the pain of knowing that his friend, a young actor,
had stopped loving and wanting him.
He's seriously ill, and his parents are terribly worried.
An old servant who brought him up
is also full of fear for Kleitos' life;
and in her panic
she remembers an idol she used to worship
when she was young, before she came there as a maid,
herself.
She secretly brings some votive bread, some wine and honey,
and places them before the idol. She chants whatever phrases
she remembers from old prayers: odds and ends. The ninny
doesn't realize that the black demon couldn't care less

Klockius so deeply hath sworn ne'er more to come
In bawdy house, that he dares not go home. 

I came here from the forest
I tell you, it is a very holy night!
All over the tips of the firs
I saw bright flashes of golden light


Tell you what I like the best -- 
'Long about knee-deep in June, 
'Bout the time strawberries melts 
On the vine, -- some afternoon 
Like to jes' git out and rest, 
And not work at nothin' else! 

Orchard's where I'd ruther be -- 
Needn't fence it in fer me! -- 
Jes' the whole sky overhead, 
And the whole airth underneath -- 
Sort o' so's a man kin breathe 
Like he ort, and kind o' has 
Elbow-room to keerlessly 
Sprawl out len'thways on the grass 
Where the shadders thick and soft 
As the kivvers on the bed 
Mother fixes in the loft 
Allus, when they's company! 

Jes' a-sort o' lazin there - 
S'lazy, 'at you peek and peer 
Through the wavin' leaves above, 
Like a feller 'ats in love 
And don't know it, ner don't keer! 
Ever'thing you hear and see 
Got some sort o' interest - 
Maybe find a bluebird's nest 
Tucked up there conveenently 
Fer the boy 'at's ap' to be 
Up some other apple tree! 
Watch the swallers skootin' past 
Bout as peert as you could ast; 
Er the Bob-white raise and whiz 
Where some other's whistle is. 

Ketch a shadder down below, 
And look up to find the crow -- 
Er a hawk, - away up there, 
'Pearantly froze in the air! -- 
Hear the old hen squawk, and squat 
Over ever' chick she's got, 
Suddent-like! - and she knows where 
That-air hawk is, well as you! -- 
You jes' bet yer life she do! -- 
Eyes a-glitterin' like glass, 
Waitin' till he makes a pass! 

Pee-wees wingin', to express 
My opinion, 's second-class, 
Yit you'll hear 'em more er less; 
Sapsucks gittin' down to biz, 
Weedin' out the lonesomeness; 
Mr. Bluejay, full o' sass, 
In them baseball clothes o' his, 
Sportin' round the orchad jes' 
Like he owned the premises! 
Sun out in the fields kin sizz, 
But flat on yer back, I guess, 
In the shade's where glory is! 
That's jes' what I'd like to do 
Stiddy fer a year er two! 

Plague! Ef they ain't somepin' in 
Work 'at kind o' goes ag'in' 
My convictions! - 'long about 
Here in June especially! -- 
Under some ole apple tree, 
Jes' a-restin through and through, 
I could git along without 
Nothin' else at all to do 
Only jes' a-wishin' you 
Wuz a-gittin' there like me, 
And June wuz eternity! 

Lay out there and try to see 
Jes' how lazy you kin be! -- 
Tumble round and souse yer head 
In the clover-bloom, er pull 
Yer straw hat acrost yer eyes 
And peek through it at the skies, 
Thinkin' of old chums 'ats dead, 
Maybe, smilin' back at you 
In betwixt the beautiful 
Clouds o'gold and white and blue! -- 
Month a man kin railly love -- 
June, you know, I'm talkin' of! 

March ain't never nothin' new! -- 
April's altogether too 
Brash fer me! and May -- I jes' 
'Bominate its promises, -- 
Little hints o' sunshine and 
Green around the timber-land -- 
A few blossoms, and a few 
Chip-birds, and a sprout er two, -- 
Drap asleep, and it turns in 
Fore daylight and snows ag'in! -- 
But when June comes - Clear my th'oat 
With wild honey! -- Rench my hair 
In the dew! And hold my coat! 
Whoop out loud! And th'ow my hat! -- 
June wants me, and I'm to spare! 
Spread them shadders anywhere, 
I'll get down and waller there, 
And obleeged to you at that

Give me content--
Full-pleasured with what comes to me,
What e'er it be:
An humble roof--a frugal board,
And simple hoard;
The wintry fagot piled beside
The chimney wide,
While the enwreathing flames up-sprout
And twine about
The brazen dogs that guard my hearth
And household worth:
Tinge with the ember's ruddy glow
The rafters low;
And let the sparks snap with delight,
As ringers might
That mark deft measures of some tune
The children croon:
Then, with good friends, the rarest few
Thou holdest true,
Ranged round about the blaze, to share
My comfort there,--
Give me to claim the service meet
That makes each seat
A place of honor, and each guest
Loved as the rest. 

The metalic clash of bronze, 
the sweeping sound of steel.
The first draw of swords, 
in their weilder's hands feel.

Through the drawn out years, 
a bloody war do we wage.
Only to be recorded, 
in a single blood-stained page.

We can never stop, 
for no solution can we find.
We are stuck forever, 
in this eternal bind.

Once best of friends we were, 
now backs turned away.
May this quest for blood finally end, 
that much we both pray. 

The women he has had are all faces
without eyes.
He has entered them blind
as a cut worm.
He has swum their oceans
like a wounded fish
looking for home.

At nights when he can't sleep,
he dreams of weaving
backward up that river
where the banks
are fringed with mouths,
& weedy hair
grows amid the dark crusts
of ancient blood.

Tonight he is afraid & lonely
in a city of meat & knives.
I would go under his knife
& move so willingly
that his heart
might turn to butter
in his mouth. 

Come to me
Close to me
Sing your song to me 

My half day of madness
Prolong to a full day 
A day or a night
In that to be sunk

Fullness a medicine for an illness
Darkness a bed for a sleepiness 
Madness a permit to be oneness 
Oneness a soul to be worldliness 

You delay not 
Time ticks
Come to me
Knock at me

Sleepless nights with your half
Though I wish cannot good laugh
Forget my dreams and soon splash
Lunatic changes make a clash


We die from within and just like our statues
We dedicate to our eternal memory, 
So many trinkets sculpted
From concrete, brass, plaster and wood.

We rot; inside, outwards
And so when Death
Is finally displayed on our faces, 
Our friends
Are suddenly free to express with sheer amazement

That they never really knew us 
All that well-

 

To the right
Her inner thoughts
must abide by the rules
that govern us

Knock Knock Knock
and a new poet was born
It was daughter not a son

She delivered her message in a bottle
As the soldier ants passed on in a throttle

It's obnoxious to think
that there is only
a beginning, a middle and an end
To the oblivious
The prosperity of infinity
does have a role in life to play my dear friends

Knock Knock Knock
and a new poet was born
It was daughter not a son

She spoke out loud
There are unanswered questions
due to our limited restrictions
of comprehending matters
that surpass religion

We seek, we search and crave
for the unknown
Now it will be totally absurd
to think that the soul
is just another empty dark hole

And behold she said
I must insist
That force that we all fear
Is right here in our mist
in all the places where we drink and feast

Knock Knock Knock
and a new poet was born
It was daughter not a son

An escaped convict is on the run
She stood up and sang beautifully to the sun
My consience is loose and  heavy
It weighs far too many tonnes

How can we measure a feeling
of love or hatred
of sadness or of joy
How can we measure a feeling
that is so right
or a feeling that is very wrong
so that in matters all day long
true justice prevails itself

Knock Knock Knock
and a new poet was born
It was daughter not a son

As I look into your eyes

Shivers of delight 
As you sweetly caress my soul

I want you here in my life
I want you in my dreams

Smiles once more
As you knock at my door

My heart is open to let you in

And dunno if my legs or back or heart is most wore out; 
I've got no spirits left to rise and smooth me achin' brow -- 
I'm too knocked up to light a fire and bile the billy now. 
 
     Oh it's trampin', trampin', tra-a-mpin', in flies an' dust an' heat, 
     Or it's trampin' trampin' tra-a-a-mpin' 
       through mud and slush 'n sleet; 
     It's tramp an' tramp for tucker -- one everlastin' strife, 
     An' wearin' out yer boots an' heart in the wastin' of yer life. 
 
They whine o' lost an' wasted lives in idleness and crime -- 
I've wasted mine for twenty years, and grafted all the time 
And never drunk the stuff I earned, nor gambled when I shore -- 
But somehow when yer on the track yer life seems wasted more. 
 
A long dry stretch of thirty miles I've tramped this broilin' day, 
All for the off-chance of a job a hundred miles away; 
There's twenty hungry beggars wild for any job this year, 
An' fifty might be at the shed while I am lyin' here. 
 
The sinews in my legs seem drawn, red-hot -- 'n that's the truth; 
I seem to weigh a ton, and ache like one tremendous tooth; 
I'm stung between my shoulder-blades -- my blessed back seems broke; 
I'm too knocked out to eat a bite -- I'm too knocked up to smoke. 
 
The blessed rain is comin' too -- there's oceans in the sky, 
An' I suppose I must get up and rig the blessed fly; 
The heat is bad, the water's bad, the flies a crimson curse, 
The grub is bad, mosquitoes damned -- but rheumatism's worse. 
 
I wonder why poor blokes like me will stick so fast ter breath, 
Though Shakespeare says it is the fear of somethin' after death; 
What ever that same somethin' is I swear it can't be worse. 
 
     For it's trampin', trampin', tra-a-mpin' thro' hell across the plain, 
     And it's trampin' trampin' tra-a-mpin' thro' slush 'n mud 'n rain -- 
     A livin' worse than any dog -- without a home 'n wife, 
     A-wearin' out yer heart 'n soul in the wastin' of yer life. 

Weary old wife, with the bucket and cow,
‘How’s your son Jack? and where is he now?’
Haggard old eyes that turn to the west—
‘Boys will be boys, and he’s gone with the rest!’
Grief without tears and grief without sound;
‘Somewhere up-country he’s knocking around.’ 
Knocking around with a vagabond crew,
Does for himself what a mother would do;
Maybe in trouble and maybe hard-up,
Maybe in want of a bite or a sup;
Dead of the fever, or lost in the drought,
Lonely old mother! he’s knocking about. 

Wiry old man at the tail of the plough,
‘Heard of Jack lately? and where is he now?’
Pauses a moment his forehead to wipe,
Drops the rope reins while he feels for his pipe,
Scratches his grey head in sorrow or doubt:
‘Somewheers or others he’s knocking about.’ 

Knocking about on the runs of the West,
Holding his own with the worst and the best
Breaking in horses and risking his neck,
Droving or shearing and making a cheque;
Straight as a sapling—six-foot and sound,
Jack is all right when he’s knocking around


I was a year and a half old when
Two, loud cracks punctured western confidence
Through air; my future head snapped back in grief.

There is no darkness to match the one in view.
Smoke is seen through the lens of habitual
Types of feelings not easily reconciled with

Processions of some one’s fear. There, in
Times of withered summer and early falls, 
Fragrances repeat themselves; scents of grass, 

And romance nurtured on the peak of a hill.
Each one of us is, at times, slow to move, 
Slow to get justice for those who surround us.

Up there. A figure swathed in nothingness. 
Can text be recalled and deconstructed
Later? A Moscow man’s ire may be involved. 

Expectant gaze across the doors.
Oceans and skies on our floors.
Swept off your feet, at first glance, 
tango in seconds, effortless dance.
Gaped and aped at painted men.
Our hearts bloomed, so much then.
Skipped that day from Ben's side, 
Plucked holy berries at the hill, 
Hand in hand by the watermill.
Head on his shoulder, silky hair.
Hand in hand, the lovelorn pair.
Giggled and sang the eternal song.
In those parks, by the age old gong.
It gently blew to caress your cheek.
As you gasped and just went weak.
Rushed the walks, not tender talks.
Dreamt, by attics and water lochs.
Weathered snows, for our sake.
Latte and pies, that freshly bake.
Across the bridges of a millennia, 
whiffed natures aroma in magnolia.
Ambled the knolls, throbbing lakes, 
dipped our hands in parting wakes.
In Mary's close, like the moles, 
And on Britannia, by distant shoals.
Neither the tubes dizzying haste, 
nor the gargoyles' watchful waste, 
It wasn't a reverie in yesteryear! 
Ages away? No! Fresh and near! 
A sniffle, a quiver, fumbling keys, 
Across the waters parting geese.
Goodbye blears, a nervous smile.
Through the counters in single file.
Strained, the bonds, are weary thin, 
and a vacant blemish deep within.
Aroma of orchard apples, stills, 
waiting for a dove, by my sills.

original
April,Buraidah-KSAThis poem was prompted by something I saw; "Don’t think of me. . as a Kook."
It really wasn’t a terrible thing.  It was. .. in fact, a simple piece of trash, 
which might, however, make some of you. .. AVERT your eyes in a flash.


Now, if you were paying attention to the title, and your memory is
still intact, 
you’ve probably guessed the "trash" was a condom.  You’d be right; it is a fact.  
that I saw, lying in my pathway, a condom, a red one tied up TIGHT. .. with a knot, 
and inside that red rubber I assume was come, left there, lying quietly, to quickly rot.


The trash of which I now have spoken was in a roadway where I took my walk.
If seen there by a couple of teen girls, it might make them giggle and quickly talk.  .
about  ANYTHING besides what they’d just seen. . ‘cause some would tell them: "It is obscene! "


So that’s one of the title-parts.   a condom, .   knotty and /or naughty, 
[depending on your attitude towards condom-use; are you open-minded, or are you haughty? ].
You see I played a bit with the word: "knotty".  It can mean "tied in knots", 
OR  IT CAN MEAN "PUZZLINGLY INTRICATE", which the issue of birth control is.   LOTS! 


And THERE is the naughty (and/or knotty)    conundrum.  A "difficult problem" it is indeed.
Is it sinful to use a birth control measure?  OR is it okay to take control and STOP the "seed"?

cliche to its knees, dropp an elbow on

why you need to hold that beautiful bouquet of flowers
see the flowers have dried up.
But dryness has it’s own beauty

Like the dry desert that designs dunes
Like desires directs life
Like directions to reach destinations

You look beautiful than the bouquet now
Waiting is wasting
With the bouquet in hand you waited for some one 
like a fool
You waited so long and longed to be with 
Who never belong
Who worth no love
And
They are who, 
who know no love. 

Know one knows why am I here, 
To be place on this earth, 
Where I truly don't belong, 
Know one knows me, 
Think you know me, 
You don't, 
Everyday is a hearchache, 
From School, to house, to my friends, 
Everywhere I go, 
I get heartaches, 
Know one knows what I feel, 
I feel as if time is drifting away from me, 
Choking on water, 
Here I go again, 
Thinking why should I die, 
Ready to die, 
Ready to leave this place, 
This shallow place I don't want to follow, 
You built me up, 
You break me down, 
Here I go again, 
Thinking what to choke on, 
Ready to die, 
Know one knows my thoughts or the true me, 
Falling asleep, 
The dream that never ends, 
The thin line I crossed, 
Save me, 
From this place, 
What would you say if I left this agony place, 
Know one knows why I feel this way, 
Don't question my thoughts, 
Just let me DIE. 

Friends last longer than lovers.



a fact there is to view
reality comes in time
valid reason will shine
in a decision to make 
no regret one must take.

Be you the first or last
rarely it can set you fast

through humility is the way 
of gaining a respectable stay.

අනුවාදය: උදය ආර්. තෙන්නකෝන්You are mistaken if you think of your talent
You will be shown exit with bad comment
You may be forced to believe what has gone wrong
You can’t make people fool with your sweet words and song

They will move around for courageous stand
They may even closely follow and try to be friend
But they will forget and shunt you out for silly mistake
As they will see some thing big at risk or at stake

Whole life work may seem to be wasted
Your endurance and patience is tested
People may try to undermine for what you had done or said
They have mistrust in you and remain totally afraid

It is how you create trust wall
Respond to generous and emergency calls
Remain among people for their well being
They want ordinary man and not the king

Neither the high education comes to your rescue
Not your personal strength to supervise or over view
It is man to man contact and real deliverance
The things done with your efforts and in presence

How the flowers boom in beautiful garden? 
How our eyes catch few of them then? 
They have nothing for them except to praise 
We all try to preserve them and beautifully raise 

Some of the leaders come up like desert flowers
Come up for short span due to rain and showers
People know about their sudden appearance
But still remember their existence for fragrance

So people may remember well about sacrifice
They too will remember about fulfillment of promises
What they not forget is total turn about and deception
 They may totally forbid them and rule them out of question


You may know your world
When come near and in the fold
There may not be any change with the season to feel cold
But something remains in you as untold

World doesn't belong to me
As I am undecided and not free
Love has absolutely no meaning
As I see sun only with shining

The sun rays burn my skin
Yet I am attached to it and akin
Morning rays give me warmth
The nice feeling comes aftermath

What sky has do with feeling? 
As it has only void kingdom and power of killing
How can one remain without any attachment? 
Sky has horizon but no definite movement

Of late I have developed liking
Some feature comes to mind and striking
I think of your broad arms and gorgeous look
I take no decision but hide the face in book

I sensed some magnetic pull
You were perfect in approach and successful
I could resist nothing but strong appeal
There was no shield with me to repeal 

I know now that you won't wait for storm
Get close and swim in to remain in form
You have only to fall in line with his desire
You whole body may fall apart in burn with fire

You may feel heart beats getting slow
Yet you may drive in and forcefully go
This is what your ultimate decision is! 
So far you were in cold and desires almost frozen


Not easy to know self
It is like lying of treasure in sea shelf
It is there but lying unused  
And even if it is with you, it is always misused

No one has known self so far
It is like wonder to look at star
You take no precaution to utilize it for self and others
You are preoccupied all the time for deceiving and bother

So it is said "enjoy yourself as far as you can"
Concentrate on achievements and train
You should train your guns only on those objects
Which really need your attention with acts? 

Everybody lives by what he thinks and believes
This does not serve purpose or relieve the pain
It is just an exercise in futility
This is weakness of human being and considered as poor quality

If someone has successfully came out of it
Then it can be taken as bold initiate and feat
Only few people may know of themselves 
As their whole action may succeed and revolve

It requires courage and stubborn mind
It may help you to go in and try to find
Some innovative ways and its solution
It speaks of strong mind with evolution

If you little of your weaknesses
It won’t be that difficult to assess
Some of the steps taken may be disastrous
But that may remain steady and continuous

You can take solace by claiming "human is to err"
If you are totally ignorant then you may simply stare
You will find no corrective action from your heart
You will have two minds to speak with very bad start

Not all may succeed in that generous way
They may have all the apprehensions with the bad day
They may blame it with their luck or fate
They may not be able reach even up to gate


As the mystic grows
in his earnest aspirations
and this direct intuition 
of the Absolute 
kills all lesser cravings. 

and needs nothing more.
 
Having eyes set on eternity, 
his consciousness steeped in it, 
he can well afford 
to tolerate the entanglements of time.

Mysticism is an entirely spiritual activity. 
Its aims are wholly transcendental and spiritual. 

Knowing nothing shuts the iron gates; 
      the new love opens them.

The sound of the gates opening wakes
      the beautiful woman asleep.

Kabir says: Fantastic! 
      Don't let a chance like this go by

Thorns, way up? 
Wear shoes and march on! 
To eliminate thorns for cleansing
Stand followers flat run, past you


I sat and really listened to you today 
Hung on to every word you had to say 
I looked into your saddened eyes 
And saw your anger in the skies 

I sat and really listened to you today 
Watched for every signal you had to convey 
I saw the tears you were hiding 
From the long days and nights of chiding 

I sat and really listened to you today 
Saw every hurt that you had to repay 
I felt the anger raging in you 
For thinking your reward was now due   

I sat and really listened to you today 
Heard all the in-between words you had to say 
I looked into your lonely eyes 
Tried to convey my lonesome cries 

I sat and really spoke with you today 
Strung out every word I had to say 
I forced you to look into mournful eyes 
For you to see my anger and the lies     

I sat and really spoke with you today 
Sent every signal I had to convey 
I abandoned the tears from falling 
To heal from all of the tongue-lashing   

I sat and really spoke with you today 
Saw every hurt I had to repay 
I felt the anger surging in me 
For never finding my liberty 

I sat and spoke intimately with you today  
Trusting in you knowing secret words I had to say 
I forced you to look into my lonesome eyes 
So that once again we could empathize

I looked into your lonely eyes 
Tried to convey my lonesome cries 

I sat and really spoke with you today 
Strung out every word I had to say 
I forced you to look into mournful eyes 
For you to see my anger and the lies     

I sat and really spoke with you today 
Sent every signal I had to convey 
I abandoned the tears from falling 
To heal from all of the tongue-lashing   

I sat and really spoke with you today 
Saw every hurt I had to repay 
I felt the anger surging in me 
For never finding my liberty 

I sat and spoke intimately with you today  
Trusting in you knowing secret words I had to say 
I forced you to look into my lonesome eyes 
So that once again we could empathize   



Richard Wlodarski    October ow that I know
How passion warms little
Of flesh in the mould,
And treasure is brittle,--

I'll lie here and learn
How, over their ground
Trees make a long shadow
And a light sound. 

A knowledge if shared, 
likely grows to abundance..
if keep to self will be lost

Knowledge is power
A chop-chop growing flower
knowledge is dangerous
An overdosing negative force

And I have been walking its path
Right from the the start with my heart
Acknowledging it as a perfect invention
That can set me free or put me in detention

Knowledge is a privilege
It could place you at the cutting edge
When you pledge 
To make it your privilege

Born are great deeds and weeds
As knowledge plants seeds
But Knowledge can deceive
At the end you choose what to believe


 

Knowledge is not only power
a source of peace. 
A fragrant flower,     
It teaches humanism
It makes a significant man
Breeds prosperity				
Springs dignity					
It takes above the Everest 						
If dwells in the cell of slumber			
It is knowledge that awakens			
Makes agile 
Infuses verve 
Blesses wings 
Adorn lives 
A man of knowledge is treasure trove of laconic
Illumine the way to be called iconic.  

Earn love and respect
Name and fame 
Through source of knowledge 
And become like the sun
To spread light
And to conquer gloom 
The more you give away
The more you get express way. 

The power of knowledge 
lies in the clarity of expression

Knowledge is not for sale in the market place.
It is our most treasured possession. It is free
to all. Is it not surprising, that so many do not
seek it? 

Knowledge is

Hunger to learn all there is to know

You want to know how 

The world is. .. 

its history 

Its present.  

and the future 

Yet to be


You search for a question 

That you cant seem to let go

Not until you found the answer

Of the who and why and how


I will always have this hunger

This hunger to want to learn

About all there is out there 

In this great big wonderful world

Lets go and explore.  

the wonders


Someone who is smart
always speaks of logic things
not of illusion. 

Frog in well defined as knowledge confined, 
Come out of it with knowledge refined, 
May be areas used so compact and defined, 
Inherent possession is must -------

Knowledge or power to spread over horizon
Frequent debates, contacts taking place in zone 
In depth study and answer with solid reasons, 
Surely to find result as that of seasons, 

When Sun rays emerge and shine in sky, 
Darkness disappears and still no one ask why? 
Spread of knowledge end misery and plight, 
Go ahead and cruise with direction and flight, 

We may remain aloof and total in disarray, 
Supremacy to gain with permanent sway, 
Never yield to blackmail and not to give away, 
Should make it with easy access and way? 

Can Sun be blanketed or hidden with shade? 
Will swords be useless in front of spade? 
Knowledge is like power so will emerge and surface, 
May be more accurate as heat from furnace, 

Deep buried inside with innumerable secrets, 
Inside vision may understand and interpret, 
Efforts may be needed to understand it more, 
Secrets may be unveiled and result come to fore, 

Nature never confines or secrets hide, 
You may need vision with angle wide, 
Always do part with but not with any side, 
Water waves move on with calm or tide, 

Why mountain volcano erupts and cause land to slide? 
Suggest more open ways to think and decide, 
Power is force which can't be retained, 
Prisoner to be released if wrongly detained, 

Knowledge is power and has to be realized, 
Widespread of area has to be materialized, 
To die with the secrets does not serve purpose, 
Even kings abdicate when fear sudden depose


So far from praising he blasphemes
Or face to face in woods and streams,
Meshed in their boundaries.

'Has been' and 'is' the seasons bind,
(Here glut of bread, there lack of bread).
The mill-stones grumble as they grind
Or if he was, is dead.

Making a proof as Jove or Dis,
Force, Essence, Knowledge, that or this,

The caterpillar years-to-come
March head to tail with years-that-were
Round and around the cosmic drum,
To time and space they add their sum

Weep, sleep, be merry, vault the gate
Or down the evening furrow plod,
Hate, and at length withhold your hate,
Rule, or be ruled by certain fate,

A knowledge if shared, 
likely grows to abundance..
if keep to self will be lost

Knowledge is power 
It is simple blower
It is meant for development 
Happiness in life is with simple movement 

It leads to praise
Or pushed to wild chase
In believing what is seen 
Or in not believing real scene 

Life is complex
Education makes it simple
All secrets are decoded
Some of the benefits are conceded

It is considered as second birth 
Life without knowledge is considered as living death
You are good and thorough to practical ways
Yet from practical life it keeps you away  

The energy must be harnessed
Knowledge must be properly utilized
It gives added advantage 
When put to practical usages

There are many loop holes
Nature too needs close call
So many secrets are unknown 
Nature and humanity must be equally blown


Acquire
The skill to conquer
Uncertainty for surety
With dignity

Unstable mind
Fails to find
Clear path and guidance
Even in His presence

With little shakiness
You will face
Hurdles
And troubles

So assert
And prompt 
With awareness
To chase any challenges

You shall find place
Nowhere in race
If has double mind to speak
You shall be called weak

You have to win
And be seen
As clear victorious
To become known and famous


Basically I am known as fighter  
Mix with all and release the fun after 
Friends call me high headed 
But at all points rightly I have conceded 

I am fond of and little soft at young females
May be weakness for beautiful males
But that is natural for all human being 
Whether he is poor or mighty king 

I remembered one incidence of past
The relation abruptly ended very fast
Before we could silently enjoy the bond 
I was pushed to corner virtually to remain as second 

No doubt she had powerful back ground
She was rich and was often found
With rich of high status as single  
This was the only reason to invite trouble 

She may move with me but always careful 
Show the richness and to some extent was also successful
Many people may often approach me and say
'You are lucky and have found the way '

Unfortunately it did not last long 
I was waiting for it to be proved wrong 
In fact I was wrong to assume falsehood
Failed completely in anticipation and never understood

It is lovely to dream but painful to scream 
Equally distrustful when blocked by the stream 
When two unequal people openly clash 
There is enough of sound with flash 

There should be meeting of ground
Then only identities are found
Equal respect should be given for work and honor
Nothing should then be done which is uncalled for 

Large volume of water thereafter has flown in river
But situation has not altered any where 
We come across same situation and wonder
Why is it so that we fail to move forward and stick there? 
. 

It is known concept
We have to follow it promptly
Nothing comes in life that easily
Do not expect it to come readily

Life is not that rosy
It keeps you always busy
Makes you to struggle for an every inch
You feel and experience salt in wounds and pinch

If you know and realize
At an early stage for being not wise
It will be certainly a surprise
As life does not seem to be challenge or promises

For a man it is 'do or die' situation
Lot many problems and questions
Joy and happiness remains miles away
Life stands as an illusion and only thorns in the way 

It is nice to hold ground
Loose no hope and ready to go around
Amidst deception, treachery and dejection
It shapes your decision with concrete action

Real person tries to know from within
Ability that makes to surge ahead and win
Never allows frustration to take over
Plans in advance and builds safety cover

I found love in your early move
There was no need to prove
It stood on rocky ground
It was always ready and found

It might have run into rough weather
But it was meant to add a shining feather
You were destined to be as tough bargainer
Not novice or just beginner

I find everybody learns through process
When he or she is denied access
The river finds it way through zigzag
Ups and down comes everywhere in stages

I feel happy when time comes to look back
Life seems to be easy and like cake walk 
I appreciate any individual that has attained
With integrity and honesty the level is maintained


Known force

Still you are marred
And debarred
From entering holy domain
As some of the evils still remain

No one has shamed so far
And claimed afar
That they are really free
As liberal and giant like tree

It is like dog’s tail
That shall always fail
To straighten by an attempt
But alas! We are not prompt 

We are not worth
Even for decent death 
We inhale with deep breathe 
With any promises and faith 

No doubt, we remember
And offer prayers
But only when deceived or dejected
It is only known force to be reacted


Known forever my nature
I am not other, 
My sun shining face
My rain drenching face, 
Under the swinging leaves
Of the oak trees, 
And in the tears sucking sands
Of the hungry deserts. 

I lift you in air
Bring down to midair
Feel so happy and clear
Now I hold no fear

As you promised
Not to be missed
From life forever
I cherish that word you whispered

The earth may have less
As I try and trace
The fragrance from your body
Smells like scent everyday 

I have your hand 
And face near as friend
You are leaning on shoulder
With gentle smile an whisper 

I hold you and not allow
To go away as I follow
Each step you advance 
I want each moment with chance 

I embrace you tight
To feel almost with delight 
You are shying down 
With lines of known smiles


I always like summer
 Best
 you can eat fresh corn
 From daddy's garden
 And okra
 And greens
 And cabbage
 And lots of
 Barbeque
 And buttermilk
 And homemade ice-cream
 At the church picnic
 And listen to
 Gospel music
 Outside
 At the church
 Homecoming
 And go to the mountains with
 Your grandmother
 And go barefooted
 And be warm
 All the time
 Not only when you go to bed
 And sleep

Koening knew now there was no one on the river.
Entering its brown mouth choking with lilies
and curtained with midges, Koenig poled the shallop
past the abandoned ferry and the ferry piles
coated with coal dust. Staying aboard, he saw, up
in a thick meadow, a sand-colored mule,
untethered, with no harness, and no signs
of habitation round the ruined factory wheel
locked hard in rust, and through whose spokes the vines
of wild yam leaves leant from overweight;
the wild bananas in the yellowish sunlight
were dugged like aching cows with unmilked fruit.
This was the last of the productive mines.
Only the vegetation here looked right.
A crab of pain scuttled shooting up his foot
and fastened on his neck, at the brain's root.
He felt his reason curling back like parchment
in this fierce torpor. Well, he no longer taxed
and tired what was left of his memory;
he should thank heaven he had escaped the sea,
and anyway, he had demanded to be sent
here with the others - why get this river vexed
with his complaints? Koenig wanted to sing,
suddenly, if only to keep the river company - 
this was a river, and Koenig, his name meant King.
They had all caught the missionary fever:
they were prepared to expiate the sins
os savages, to tame them as he would tame this river
subtly, as it flowed, accepting its bends;
he had seen how other missionaries met their ends - 
swinging in the wind, like a dead clapper when
a bell is broken, if that sky was a bell -
for treating savages as if they were men,
and frightening them with talk of Heaven and Hell.
But I have forgotten our journey's origins,
mused Koenig, and our purpose. He knew it was noble,
based on some phrase, forgotten, from the Bible,
but he felt bodiless, like a man stumbling from
the pages of a novel, not a forest,
written a hundred years ago. He stroked his uniform,
clogged with the hooked burrs that had tried
to pull him, like the other drowning hands whom
his panic abandoned. The others had died,
like real men, by death. I, Koenig, am a ghost,
ghost-king of rivers. Well, even ghosts must rest.
If he knew he was lost he was not lost.
It was when you pretended that you were a fool.
He banked and leaned tiredly on the pole.
If I'm a character called Koenig, then I
shall dominate my future like a fiction
in which there is a real river and real sky,
so I'm not really tired, and should push on.

The lights between the leaves were beautiful,
and, as in that far life, now he was grateful
for any pool of light between the dull, usual
clouds of life: a sunspot haloed his tonsure;
silver and copper coins danced on the river;
his head felt warm - the light danced on his skull
like a benediction. Koenig closed his eyes,
and he felt blessed. It made direction sure.
He leant on the pole. He must push on some more.
He said his name. His voice sounded German,
then he said 'river', but what was German
if he alone could hear it? Ich spreche Deutsch
sounded as genuine as his name in English,
Koenig in Deutsch, and, in English, King.
Did the river want to be called anything?
He asked the river. The river said nothing.

Around the bend the river poured its silver
like some remorseful mine, giving and giving
everything green and white: white sky, white
water, and the dull green like a drumbeat
of the slow-sliding forest, the green heat;
then, on some sandbar, a mirage ahead:
fabric of muslin sails, spiderweb rigging,
a schooner, foundered on black river mud,
was rising slowly up from the riverbed,
and a top-hatted native reading an inverted
newspaper.
'Where's our Kaiser?'
                                      The nigger disappeared.
Koenig felt that he himself was being read
like the newspaper or a hundred-year-old novel.
And it flashed through him those trunks were not wood
but that the ghosts of slaughtered Indians stood
there in the mangrroves, their eyes like fireflies
in the green dark, and that like hummingbirds
they sailed rather than ran between the trees.
The river carried him past his shouted words.
The schooner had gone down without a trace.
'There was a time when we ruled everything,'
Koenig sang to his corrugated white reflection.
'The German Eagle and the British Lion,
we ruled worlds wider than this river flows,
worlds with dyed elephants, with tassled howdahs,
tigers that carried the striped shade when they rose
from their palm coverts; men shall not see these days
again; our flags sank with the sunset on the dhows
of Egypt; we ruled rivers as huge as the Nile,
the Ganges, and the Congo, we tamed, we ruled
you when our empires reached their blazing peak.'
This was a small creek somewhere in the world,
never mind where - victory was in sight.
Koenig laughed and spat in the brown creek.
The mosquitoes now were singing to the night
that rose up from the river, the fog uncurled
under the mangroves. Koenig clenched each fist
around his barge-pole scepter, as a mist
rises from the river and the page goes white. 

Dzogbese Lisa has treated me thus

It has led me among the sharps of the forest

Returning is not possible

And going forward is a great difficulty

The affairs of this world are like the chameleon faeces

Into which I have stepped

When I clean it cannot go.



I am on the world's extreme corner, 

I am not sitting in the row with the eminent

But those who are lucky

Sit in the middle and forget

I am on the world's extreme corner

I can only go beyond and forget.



My people, I have been somewhere

If I turn here, the rain beats me

If I turn there the sun burns me

The firewood of this world

Is for only those who can take heart

That is why not all can gather it.

The world is not good for anybody

But you are so happy with your fate; 

Alas! the travelers are back

All covered with debt.



Something has happened to me

The things so great that I cannot weep; 

I have no sons to fire the gun when I die

And no daughter to wail when I close my mouth

I have wandered on the wilderness

The great wilderness men call life

The rain has beaten me, 

And the sharp stumps cut as keen as knives

I shall go beyond and rest.

I have no kin and no brother, 

Death has made war upon our house; 



And Kpeti's great household is no more, 

Only the broken fence stands; 

And those who dared not look in his face

Have come out as men.

How well their pride is with them.

Let those gone before take note

They have treated their offspring badly.

What is the wailing for? 

Somebody is dead. Agosu himself

Alas! a snake has bitten me

My right arm is broken, 

And the tree on which I lean is fallen.



Agosi if you go tell them, 

Tell Nyidevu, Kpeti, and Kove

That they have done us evil; 

Tell them their house is falling

And the trees in the fence

Have been eaten by termites; 

That the martels curse them.

Ask them why they idle there

While we suffer, and eat sand.

And the crow and the vulture

Hover always above our broken fences

And strangers walk over our portion. 

The weaver bird built in our  house

And laid its eggs on our only tree

We did not want to send it away

We watched the building of the nest

And supervised the egg-laying.

And the weaver  returned in the guise of the owner

Preaching salvation to us that owned the house

They say it came from the west

Where the storms at sea had felled the gulls

And the fishers dried their nets by lantern light

Its sermon is the divination of ourselves

And our new horizons limit as its nest.

But we cannot join the prayers and answers of the communicants

We look for new homes every day, 

For new altars we strive to re-build

The old shrines defiled from the weaver's excrement. 





Tall-short buildings left and right, 
Yellow, Blue and white, side by side.
Old - new cars runs round the clock.
Hawkers do all footpaths block.
Wide- narrow roads run all the sides.
Crowds of people come like the tides.
Full of garbage -all men throw, 
Clay and mud, flies only crow.
Full of plastic, full of rags, 
Full of banners, full of rags, 
Rich or poor -full of fashions, 
All are hungry, have no passions.
If Sun shines, it's too hot, 
If it rains, then water- logged.
Full of mosquitoes  through the year, 
Stealing and trampling are main fear. 



Suddenly, seriously? ., Seriously? .
Komlar is gone? 
Adieu Komlar, what a colossal loss, 
What untimely demise? . I hope it is a dream? .
I hope someone would call to tell it was a mistake! 

The ever smiling face on the tube, the gap-tooth ebony is gone? 
The angels’ gain is our loss, Dumor left and will not "do more", 
Big Black Caster has fallen, and no more toothy smile on BBC, 
What a shame, how can death strike so suddenly at the prime of Komlar’s career? .

Komlar, live on in our memory, 
Komlar, rest in bossom of your creator, 
Komlar, Big Black Charismatic orator of BBC, bye until we meet again.
Komlar, true son of Africa, seriously, serious is your passing unto glory.Fools have big wombs. For the rest?—here is pennyroyal if one knows to use it. But time is only another liar, so go along the wall a little further: if blackberries prove bitter there'll be mushrooms, fairy- ring mushrooms, in the grass, sweetest of all fungi.

For what it's worth: Jacob Louslinger, white haired, stinking, dirty bearded, cross eyed, stammer tongued, broken voiced, bent backed, ball kneed, cave bellied, mucous faced—deathling,—found lying in the weeds "up there by the cemetery

" "Looks to me as if he d been bumming around the meadows for a couple of weeks

" Shoes twisted into incredible lilies: out at the toes, heels, tops, sides, soles. Meadow flower! ha, mallow! at last I have you. (Rot dead marigolds—an acre at a time! Gold, are you?) Ha, clouds will touch world's edge and the great pink mallow stand singly in the wet, topping reeds and a closet full of clothes and good shoes and my-thirty-year's-master's-daughter's two cows for me to care for and a winter room with a fire in it—. I would rather feed pigs in Moonachie and chew calamus root and break crab's claws at an open fire: age's lust loose!

      In Holland at daybreak, of a fine spring morning, one sees the housemaids beating rugs before the small houses of such a city as Amsterdam, sweeping, scrubbing the low entry steps and polishing doorbells and doorknobs. By night perhaps there will be an old woman with a girl on her arm, histing and whistling across a deserted canal to some late loiterer trudging aimlessly on beneath the gas lamps.This particular thing, whether it be four pinches of four divers white powders cleverly compounded to cure surely, safely, pleasantly a painful twitching of the eyelids or say a pencil sharpened at one end, dwarfs the imagination, makes logic a butterfly, offers a finality that sends us spinning through space, a fixity the mind could climb forever, a revolving mountain, a complexity with a surface of glass; the gist of poetry. D. 

C. al fin.
 
There is no thing that with a twist of the imagination cannot be something else. Porpoises risen in a green sea, the wind at nightfall bending the rose-red grasses and you—in your apron running to catch—say it seems to you to be your son. How ridiculous! You will pass up into a cloud and look back at me, not count the scribbling foolish that puts wings to your heels, at your knees.
 
Sooner or later as with the leaves forgotten the swinging branch long since and summer: they scurry before a wind on the frost-baked ground—have no place to rest—somehow invoke a burst of warm days not of the past nothing decayed: crisp summer! —neither a copse for resurrected frost eaters but a summer removed   undestroyed a summer of dried leaves scurrying with a screech, to and fro in the half dark—twittering, chattering, scraping. Hagh! 

_____________


      Seeing the leaves dropping from the high and low branches the thought rise: this day of all others is the one chosen, all other days fall away from it on either side and only itself remains in perfect fullness. It is its own summer, of its leaves as they scrape on the smooth ground it must build its perfection. The gross summer of the year is only a halting counterpart of those fiery days of secret triumph which in reality themselves paint the year as if upon a parchment, giving each season a mockery of the warmth or frozenness which is within ourselves. The true seasons blossom or wilt not in fixed order but so that many of them may pass in a few weeks or hours whereas sometimes a whole life passes and the season remains of a piece from one end to the other.﻿beside me in this garden
are huge and daisy-like
(why not? are not
oxeye daisies a chrysanthemum?),
shrubby and thick-stalked,
the leaves pointing up
the stems from which
the flowers burst in
sunbursts. I love
this garden in all its moods,
even under its winter coat
of salt hay, or now,
in October, more than
half gone over: here
a rose, there a clump
of aconite. This morning
one of the dogs killed
a barn owl. Bob saw
it happen, tried to
intervene. The airedale
snapped its neck and left
it lying. Now the bird
lies buried by an apple
tree. Last evening
from the table we saw
the owl, huge in the dusk,
circling the field
on owl-silent wings.
The first one ever seen
here: now it's gone,
a dream you just remember.

The dogs are barking. In
the studio music plays
and Bob and Darragh paint.
I sit scribbling in a little
notebook at a garden table,
too hot in a heavy shirt
in the mid-October sun
into which the Korean mums
all face. There is a 
dull book with me,
an apple core, cigarettes,
an ashtray. Behind me
the rue I gave Bob
flourishes. Light on leaves,
so much to see, and
all I really see is that
owl, its bulk troubling
the twilight. I'll
soon forget it: what
is there I have not forgot?
Or one day will forget:
this garden, the breeze
in stillness, even
the words, Korean mums.



Love may trace his echoing footsteps, yet we never more shall meet
Rugged Kretschmann, the musician, plodding down a Sydney street,
Never see the low broad figure, massive head and shaggy mane
And the quiet furrowed features, never hear his voice again.

But from many a home there rises many a note that lingering rings
Ever since his cunning fingers touched and drew it from the strings;
All our land is full of noises; happy phantom fields of scent,
Bright with sunlit blossoms, echo birdlike music where he went.

He was old and grey and weary, death and he were long at grips,
Evil whispers hissed behind him, German to the finger-tips,
War's wild fury snarled about him, so he gently stepped aside,
Loving us and loving Germans, heavy-hearted, and he died.

Crusted shells, by ocean battered, taken from the barren shore
Bear within their hearts a murmur of the sea's eternal roar;
Who shall say what vital music, all unheard by duller ears,
Swept the soul of good old Kretschmann to his home amid the spheres?

Harmony was all his being, and he held the music sweet
Welling up in baby voices, beaten out by tiny feet;
Still with playthings in his pockets, rest and solace may he know,
Welcomed gladly to the kingdom where the little children go. 

Your body is my prison, Krishna,
I cannot see beyond it.
Your darkness blinds me,
Your love words shut out the wise world's din.

[From Only The Soul Knows How To Sing]Krishna said, 'O fair beauty, who are you? 
Where do you live? Whose daughter are you? 
I never yet saw you in the lanes of Braj.' 

Radha said, 'What need have I to come this way? 
I keep playing by my door. 
But I hear that some son of Nanda 
is in the habit of stealing butter and curds.' 

Krishna said, 'Look, why should I appropriate 
anything that's yours? Come, let's play together.' 

Suradasa says: By his honied words, 
Krishna, the crafty prince of amorists, 
beguiled Radha and put her at ease. 

Krishna awake, for the day has dawned: 
large, deep and lotus-like, 
your eyes are as in the love-shaped lake 
a pair of swans even a million Kamadevas cannot vie 
with the bewitching beauty of your face; 
the sun rises in the east, 
a crimson ball the night is going 
and the moonlight pales 
the lamps turn dim 
and the stars fade out 
as though the bright radiance of wisdom's rays 
dispels the pleasures that the senses tire, 
and the light of hope chases away 
the murky darkness of despair and doubt.

Listen, the birds sing 
aloud with glee O sweet child, 
life of my life, 
my sole wealth, 
O darling boy,
bards and minstrels 
sing your praises, 
saying 'victory! victory!'

Clusters of lotuses burst into bloom 
the bumblebees humming with sweet sound 
leave the lotuses; 
as though the devout renouncing worldly ties, 
in your love drowned 
chant your name as they go about.

Hearing his mother's words with love 
the world's woes vanished, 
maya's net was rent. 

Says Suradasa, 
'Seeing his lotus face delusion fled; 
all doubts and dualities were destroyed and I found in Govinda eternal joy. 

Mohan's begun to say 'Maiya Maiya,'
And 'Baba Baba' to Nanda,
Balaram He's calling 'baiya'
From atop the house Yasoda shouts
Taking the name of kanhaiya.
Don't go far to play my darling
Someone's cow will hit ye.
The gopas and gopis celebrate boisterously
In each house there is festivity
My all is surrendered to the Almighty. 

O mother mine, Dau (Balram)forever teases me.
you never gave birth to me,
and I was bought in the market.
this is what he tells me
o mother mihne, Dau forever teases me.
fed up of his teasing ways,
I don't go out to play.
who is your mother?
and who is your father?
again and again he says.
Yasoda's fair, so also Nanda,
how come you're so dark?
Dau provokes, the gopas laugh,
and all have such a lark.
me, mother, you want to beat,
but Dau you never even scold,
seeing the anger on Mohan's face
Yasoda's joy was untold,
listen Kanha, Balbhadra is naughty,
wicked from his birth,
you're my son, and I your mother,
I swear by mother cows worth

Chuckling, Kanha came crawling,
Trying to catch His reflection
In the bejewelled courtyard of Nanda.
One moment He would stare at His shadow
Then move His hands to hold it
Chuckling in delight, two teeth showing
Again and again He would try.
Calling Nanda to come and see
Yasoda watched in joy
She began to feed her boy. 

O mother mine, I did not eat the butter
come dawn, with the herds,
you send me to the jungle,
o, mother mine, I did not eat the butter.
all day long with my flute in the jungles
at dusk do I return home.
but a child, younger than my friends
how could I reach up to the butter?
all the gopas are against me
on my face they wipe the butter,
you mother, are much too innocent,
you believe all their chatter.
there is a flaw in your behaviour,
you consider me not yours,
take you herd-stick and the blanket
I'll dance to your tune no longer.
Surdas, Yasoda then laughed,
and took the boy in her arms,
mother mine I did not eat the butter. 

O Krishna, darling of Gokula, awake

I have brought you milk, curd and sugar-candy come and partake of these delicacies: your pals are at the door, calling you to play; the sun has risen and it's time to go to the woods.


Yasoda lulling Hari to sleep,
Shaking the cradle, cuddling and fondling,
Singing to Him a song.
My darling is sleepy
Why doesn't sleep come along?
Come sleep, come quickly
Kanha for you does long.
Sometimes He closes His eyes
Sometimes His lips are aflutter.
Thinking He has fallen asleep
Yasoda stops her singing.
Awake still, He's up suddenly
Enjoying Yasoda's song.
Such joy as Yasoda feels
Is unattainable to the gods. 

Hands stretched out hesitantly,
A foot on the ground unstably,
Sometimes watching His adorable face
Storing away the joy in her heart,
Sometimes praising the family deity:
Give long life to her Kanhaiya.
Sometimes calling to Bal
Two to play in her courtyard.
The lustre of bliss of Nandraiya (Yasoda). 

Kanha walks
Two steps at a time,
Yasoda's desires see
Fulfilment sublime.
A sound
So pleasing to the mind.
He sits,
But then is up immediately,
A sight difficult to describe.
All the ladies of Braj tire
Of seeing such beauty divine. 

Mother, when will my hair-braid grow?
milk you said will make it grow,
but still it remains so short.
Mother when will my hair-braid grow
you said like Bal it would be strong,
his braid has grown fat and long,
combing , braiding, bathing, drying,
to the ground like a serpent writhing.
for me you say milk is better.
never delicious bread and butter,
Sur, long live the two brothers,
the twosome of hari and haldhar. 

It's like a sculpture of Krishna-Radha on the Mars, 
Indeed, he is the creator of cosmos, 
All entities and Love he is the only source.

but to me she is the flower Krishnakali
On a cloudy day in a field
I saw the dark girl's dark gazelle-eyes.
She had no covering on her head,
her loose hair had fallen on her back.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelleeyes.

Two black cows were lowing,
as it grew dark under the heavy clouds.
So with anxious, hurried steps,
the dark girl came from her hut.
Raising her eyebrows toward the sky,
she listened a moment to the clouds' rumble.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.

A gust of the east wind
rippled the rice plants.
I was standing by a ridge,
alone in the field.
Whether or not she looked at me
Is known only to us two.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.

This how the Kohldark cloud
rises in the northeast in Jaistha;
the soft dark shadow
descends on the Tamal grove in Asharh;
and sudden delight floods the heart
in the night of Sravan.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.

To me she is the flower Krishnakali,
whatever she may be called by others.
In a field in Maynapara village
I saw the dark girl's dark gazelle-eyes.
She did not cover her head,
not having the time to feel embarrassed.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.

h of November,n Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure-dome decree :
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
     Down to a sunless sea.
So twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round :
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree ;
And here were forests ancient as the hills,
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.

But oh ! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover !
A savage place ! as holy and enchanted
As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
By woman wailing for her demon-lover !
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
A mighty fountain momently was forced :
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail :
And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
It flung up momently the sacred river.
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean :
And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
Ancestral voices prophesying war !
     The shadow of the dome of pleasure
     Floated midway on the waves ;
     Where was heard the mingled measure
     From the fountain and the caves.
It was a miracle of rare device,
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice !

     A damsel with a dulcimer
     In a vision once I saw :
     It was an Abyssinian maid,
     And on her dulcimer she played,
     Singing of Mount Abora.
     Could I revive within me
     Her symphony and song,
     To such a deep delight 'twould win me,
That with music loud and long,
I would build that dome in air,
That sunny dome ! those caves of ice !
And all who heard should see them there,
And all should cry, Beware ! Beware !
His flashing eyes, his floating hair !
Weave a circle round him thrice,
And close your eyes with holy dread,
For he on honey-dew hath fed,
And drunk the milk of Paradise. 

Rain, Rain Pour away, 
Pour down on earth with a sway
Drown my sorrows & raise my happiness
Pour down on earth and drown my tears

Now my crying is only when you come 
Invisible my tears become
or I have to go inside and hide
each and every time I cry in the side

Whether you fall on the fields or not
whether you come down the hills or not
whether you fill the rivers or not
Come down here and drown my tears

Wait not for seasons, 
Pour down from January to December
That way I can stand out in the open
you can pour down and drown my tears. 

Ravan's brother Kumbha-karna, from his wonted slumber woke,
Mightiest he of all the Rakshas, thus in solemn accents spoke:

Truly speaks the wise Bibhishan; ere he stole a hermit's wife,
Ravan should have thought and pondered, courted not a causeless strife,

Ere he did this deed of folly, Ravan should have counsel sought,
Tardy is the vain repentance when the work of shame is wrought!

Word of wisdom timely spoken saves from death and dangers dire,
Vain is grief for crime committed,-offerings to unholy fire,

Vain is hero's worth or valour if by foolish counsel led,
Toil and labour fail and perish save when unto wisdom wed,

And the foeman speeds in triumph o'er a heedless monarch's might,
As through gaps of Krauncha mountains hansas speed their southern flight!

Ravan, thou hast sought unwisely Sita, in her calm retreat,
As the wild and heedless hunter feeds upon the poisoned meat,

Nathless, faithful Kumbha-karna, will his loyal duty know,
He shall fight his monarch's battle, he shall face his brother's foe!

True to brother and to monarch, be he right or be he wrong,
Kumbha-kama fights for Lanka 'gainst her foemen fierce and strong,

Recks not if the mighty INDRA and VIVASVAT cross his path,
Or the wild and stormy MARUTS, AGNI in his fiery wrath!

And he hears his thunders echoed by my loud and answering cry,

Rama armed with ample quiver shall no second arrow send,
Ere I slay him in the battle and his limb from limb I rend!

Wiser heads than Kumbha-karna right and true from wrong may know,
Faithful to his race and monarch he shall face the haughty foe,

Joy thee in thy pleasure, Ravan, rule thy realm in regal pride,
When I slay the hermit Rama, widowed Sita be thy bride!


'Day in day out I think about you constantly
Day in day out I wish you where still here
Day in day out I wish I could still here your voice
Day in day out I wish I could see you one last time
Day in day out I wish you could give me more advice
Oh how I wish you would call me 'knuckle head' one more time
You raised me from a toddler 
Taught me right from wrong
Showed me the paths I should take
Everything I know you taught me
Everything I did was for you
When I got in trouble you where their for me
No matter what day or time it was
You where always their for me
To me you werent just my godfather but a friend indeed
The day you left me I cryed for hours
But I knew you will always be here
I cant wait till the day that I will see you again.[Kwannon, the Japanese goddess of mercy, is represented with many hands, typifying generosity and kindness. In one of these hands she is supposed
to hold an axe, wherewith she severs the threads of human lives.]


I am the ancient one, the many-handed,
The merciful am I.
Here where the black pine bends above the sea
They bring their gifts to me --
Spoil of the foreshore where the corals lie,
Fishes of ivory, and amber stranded,
And carven beads
Green as the fretted fringes of the weeds.

Age after age, I watch the long sails pass.
Age after age, I see them come once more
Home, as the grey-winged pigeon to the grass,
The white crane to the shore.
Above the beaches brown.
And here the children bring me cakes, and flowers,
And all the strange sea-creatures that they find,
For "She," they say, "the Merciful, is ours,
And she," they say, "is kind


Camphor and wave-worn sandalwood for burning
They bring to me alone,
Shells that are veined like irises, and those
Curved like the clear bright petals of a rose.
Wherefore an hundredfold again returning
I render them their own --

Full-freighted nets that flash among the foam,
Laughter and love, and gentle eyes at home,
Cool of the night, and the soft air that swells
My silver temple bells.
Winds of the spring, the little flowers that shine
Where the young barley slopes to meet the pine,
Gold of the charlock, guerdon of the rain,
I give to them again.

Yet though the fishing boats return full-laden
Out of the broad blue east,
Under the brown roofs pain is their handmaiden,
And mourning is their feast.
Yea, though my many hands are raised to bless,
I am not strong to give them happiness.

Sorrow comes swiftly as the swallow flying,
O, little lives, that are so quickly done!
Peace is my raiment, mercy is my breath,
I am the gentle one.
When they are tired of sorrow and of sighing
I give them death. 

I dreamt I saw an eye, a pretty eye, 

In your hands, 

Glittering, wet and sickening; 

Like a dull onyx set in a crown of throns, 

I did not know you were dead

when you dropped it in my lap.

what horrors of human sacrifice

Have you seen, executioner? 

What agonies of tortured men

Who sat through nights and nights of pain; 

Tongue tied by the wicked sappor; 

Gazing at you with hot imploring eyes? 

These white lilies tossed their little heads

then In the moon-steeped ponds; 

There was bouncing gaiety in the crisp chirping

Of the cricket in the undergrowth, 

And as the surf-boats splintered the waves

I saw the rainbow in your eyes

And the flash of your teeth; 

As each crystal shone, 

I saw sitting hand in hand with melancholy

A little sunny child

Playing at marbles with husks of fallen stars, 

Horrors were your flowers then, the bright red bougainvilled.

They delighted you.

Why do you now weep

And offer me this little gift

Of a dull onyx set in a crown of throns

Peace, I desire, nothing more
But, if chaos I cannot flee

At times it hurts to love so much
To open your heart to be touched
But, love I must.  Hurt I must be

I've been blessed with many riches
In my distress, it enriches
So, whether pain or jubilee

In my time of indecision
Where shadows darken my vision
Open my eyes to clearly see

Life is not always manifest
But, may I always show I'm blessed
So, the world might someday plea



Eyelids closed to shield my eyes from the sun
Each strand of my body coming undone
Wishing, from agony, to be set free

Depression flows in like the rolling sea
My emotions rise and fall like the tide
Happiness and sadness, closely reside
Within the shadows of this soul called 'me'

Can you not see me striving to be strong? 
Yearning to hear a harmonious song
I sit, patiently, in silence and grief


Unseen daggers rip my innards apart
An endless resounding gong fills my ears
No one can dam the flow of my eyes' tears
Too often my days end before they start

My dreams are left in the darkness of night
Unfulfilled, hopeless and so far away
I wish just one could see the light of day
But, when morning breaks, they're nowhere in sight

Father, I know You draw nigh when I cry
Father, I know You have a master plan
Holy Ghost, gently guide me by the hand
Assure me His will is best, by and by




To plant there a dawn so real, 
And palm flowers for their dream bed.

In their naked room without windows, 
Not touched by the innuendos, 
Music was their way to be wed
And palm flowers had their dream bed, 

The cradle of their nascent thought
Could cut their main Gordian knot-
Baptism of freedom in the head.
Then, palm flowers had their dream bed.

Searching for their love ideal
And palm flowers for their dream bed. 

 




You flew in softly and tiptoed in my life
My parched soul got a reprieve
My heart is now your permanent home
We shall play with elves and gnomes
 
The moon will sing with me a lullaby
The stars do a slow tambourine dance in the sky
My blurred vision suddenly got a divine sight
You are the soul of my soul, my eternal light
 
There is a river gushing inside me
You are the fountain, you are my chi
I hear nothing but your sweet voice
You shimmer, you glisten and I rejoice
 
You, my darling are my inner sun
You are the song that I will hum
Today, tomorrow and forever
Your inner light I shall devour
 
You are the ink on my heart that will never blur
The calligraphy etched deep inside
You have fulfilled a deep void
You are my baby, my love, my joy, my pride


As the nightingale sings its song
And the serpent slides into where it belongs
The fox after its feast gets up and yawns
The cuckoo croons and sings to the swans
I walk in the woods where the spring has awakened
The wild flowers blossom and threaten to apprehend
 
I ask myself, what did I do to have found you
What will I have to do to keep you, my dew
To have luck continue my way
You are my love, you are my jay
I dreamed of you and made you my reality
And then put an end to my duality
 
I love the sight of you
You have made my life anew
I live to see you laugh, to hold your hand
To see you sleep, to be your magic wand
You please me more everyday
Life has shown me a new way
 
O Wind, please continue to blow my way
Life without her will be dark and gray
She is like a vision to the blind
Solution to all riddles you will find
My love for her is as measureless as the sky
Will never let you go or I shall die


I got a notion that soon I’ll be your magic potion
Populate the young minds with seeds that are extra potent
Bring the right into the world and leave the left behind
And travel the distance until it is peace that we find
We all need to hold strong like Will as we make our escape
I’ll lead the way without a utility belt or cape
All I need is for you to listen to the wisdom preached
And remember there is nothing that’s too far to be reached
It’s just a matter of openin minds and adept thinkin  
Many has dreamed of this world but we know they kept sleepin
Don’t frown ya face baby girl it’ll be alright
I’ll lead you to truth the way of divine light
All I need from you is just to keep ya mind right
And don’t let anyone near you ever design fright
There’s no matter of discussion just you know that I’m here
Lay on my shoulder close ya eyes and wash away your tears
Because we’ll get to our target though it may take awhile
But like Lu said Love Always Shines Everytime Remember Smile



The Albatross


Often, to amuse themselves, the men of a crew 
Catch albatrosses, those vast sea birds 
That indolently follow a ship 
As it glides over the deep, briny sea.

Scarcely have they placed them on the deck 
Than these kings of the sky, clumsy, ashamed, 
Pathetically let their great white wings 
Drag beside them like oars.

That winged voyager, how weak and gauche he is, 
So beautiful before, now comic and ugly! 
One man worries his beak with a stubby clay pipe; 
Another limps, mimics the cripple who once flew!

The poet resembles this prince of cloud and sky 
Who frequents the tempest and laughs at the bowman; 
When exiled on the earth, the butt of hoots and jeers, 
His giant wings prevent him from walking.



The Albatross 

Sometimes for sport the men of loafing crews 
Snare the great albatrosses of the deep, 
The indolent companions of their cruise 
As through the bitter vastitudes they sweep.

Scarce have they fished aboard these airy kings 
When helpless on such unaccustomed floors, 
They piteously droop their huge white wings 
And trail them at their sides like drifting oars.

How comical, how ugly, and how meek 
Appears this soarer of celestial snows! 
One, with his pipe, teases the golden beak, 
One, limping, mocks the cripple as he goes.

The Poet, like this monarch of the clouds, 
Despising archers, rides the storm elate. 
But, stranded on the earth to jeering crowds, 
The great wings of the giant baulk his gait.



The Albatross


Sometimes, to entertain themselves, the men of the crew 
Lure upon deck an unlucky albatross, one of those vast 
Birds of the sea that follow unwearied the voyage through, 
Flying in slow and elegant circles above the mast.

No sooner have they disentangled him from their nets 
Than this aerial colossus, shorn of his pride, 
Goes hobbling pitiably across the planks and lets 
His great wings hang like heavy, useless oars at his side.

How droll is the poor floundering creature, how limp and weak — 
He, but a moment past so lordly, flying in state! 
They tease him: One of them tries to stick a pipe in his beak; 
Another mimics with laughter his odd lurching gait.

The Poet is like that wild inheritor of the cloud, 
A rider of storms, above the range of arrows and slings; 
Exiled on earth, at bay amid the jeering crowd, 
He cannot walk for his unmanageable wings.



Albatrosses


Often our sailors, for an hour of fun,
Catch albatrosses on the after breeze
Through which these trail the ship from sun to sun
As it skims down the deep and briny seas.

Scarce have these birds been set upon the poop,
Than, awkward now, they, the sky's emperors,
Piteous and shamed, let their great white wings droop
Beside them like a pair of idle oars.

These winged voyagers, how gauche their gait!
Once noble, now how ludicrous to view!
One sailor bums them with his pipe, his mate
Limps, mimicking these cripples who once flew.

Poets are like these lords of sky and cloud,
Who ride the storm and mock the bow's taut strings,
Exiled on earth amid a jeering crowd,
Prisoned and palsied by their giant wings.





The Albatross

Often, to amuse themselves, the men of the crew 
Catch those great birds of the seas, the albatrosses, 
lazy companions of the voyage, who follow 
The ship that slips through bitter gulfs.

Hardly have they put them on the deck, 
Than these kings of the skies, awkward and ashamed, 
Piteously let their great white wings 
Draggle like oars beside them.

This winged traveler, how weak he becomes and slack! 
He who of late was so beautiful, how comical and ugly! 
Someone teases his beak with a branding iron, 
Another mimics, limping, the crippled flyer!

The Poet is like the prince of the clouds, 
Haunting the tempest and laughing at the archer; 
Exiled on earth amongst the shouting people, 
His giant's wings hinder him from walking.




HENCE, loathed Melancholy,
.  .   

Of Cerberus and blackest Midnight born
In Stygian cave forlorn
.  .  'Mongst horrid shapes, and shrieks, and sights
unholy!

Where brooding Darkness spreads his jealous wings,

Iaying,
As he met her once a-Maying,
There, on beds of violets blue,
And fresh-blown roses washed in dew,
Filled her with thee,. a daughter fair,
So buxom, blithe, and debonair.
Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee
Jest, and youthful Jollity,
Quips and cranks and wanton wiles,
Nods and becks and wreathed smiles
Such as hang on Hebe's cheek,
And love to live in dimple sleek;
Sport that wrinkled Care derides,
And Laughter holding both his sides.
Come, and trip it, as you go,
On the light fantastic toe;
And in thy right hand lead with thee
The mountain-nymph, sweet Liberty;
And, if I give thee honour due,
Mirth, admit me of thy crew,
To live with her, and live with thee,
In unreproved pleasures free:
To hear the lark begin his flight,
And, singing, startle the dull night,
From his watch-tower in the skies,
Till the dappled dawn doth rise;
Then to come, in spite of sorrow,
And at my window bid good-morrow,
Through the sweet-briar or the vine,
Or the twisted eglantine;
While the cock, with lively din,
Scatters the rear of darkness thin,
And to the stack, or the barn-door,
Stoutly struts his dames before:
Oft listening how the hounds and horn
Cheerly rouse the slumbering morn,
From the side of some hoar hill,
Through the high wood echoing shrill:
Sometime walking, not unseen,
By hedgerow elms, on hillocks green,
Right against the eastern gate
Where the great Sun begins his state,
Robed in flames and amber light,
The clouds in thousand liveries dight;
While the ploughman, near at hand,
Whistles o'er the furrowed land,
And the milkmaid singeth blithe,
And the mower whets his scythe,
And every shepherd tells his tale
Under the hawthorn in the dale.
Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures,
Whilst the landskip round it measures:
Russet lawns, and fallows grey,
Where the nibbling flocks do stray;
Mountains on whose barren breast
The labouring clouds do often rest;
Meadows trim, with daisies pied;
Shallow brooks, and rivers wide;
Towers and battlements it sees
Bosomed high in tufted trees,
Where perhaps some beauty lies,
The cynosure of neighbouring eyes.
Hard by a cottage chimney smokes
From betwixt two aged oaks,
Where Corydon and Thyrsis met
Are at their savoury dinner set
Of herbs and other country messes,
Which the neat-handed Phyllis dresses;
And then in haste her bower she leaves,
With Thestylis to bind the sheaves;
Or, if the earlier season lead,
To the tanned haycock in the mead.
Sometimes, with secure delight,
The upland hamlets will invite,
When the merry bells ring round,
And the jocund rebecks sound
To many a youth and many a maid
Dancing in the chequered shade,
And young and old come forth to play
On a sunshine holiday,
Till the livelong daylight fail:
Then to the spicy nut-brown ale,
With stories told of many a feat,
How Faery Mab the junkets eat.
She was pinched and pulled, she said;
And he, by Friar's lantern led,
Tells how the drudging goblin sweat
To earn his cream-bowl duly set,
When in one night, ere glimpse of morn,
His shadowy flail hath threshed the corn
That ten day-labourers could not end;
Then lies him down, the lubber fiend,
And, stretched out all the chimney's length,
Basks at the fire his hairy strength,
And crop-full out of doors he flings,
Ere the first cock his matin rings.
Thus done the tales, to bed they creep,
By whispering winds soon lulled asleep.
Towered cities please us then,
And the busy hum of men,
Where throngs of knights and barons bold,
In weeds of peace, high triumphs hold
With store of ladies, whose bright eyes
Rain influence, and judge the prize
Of wit or arms, while both contend
To win her grace whom all commend.
There let Hymen oft appear
In saffron robe, with taper clear,
And pomp, and feast, and revelry,
With mask and antique pageantry;
Such sights as youthful poets dream
On summer eves by haunted stream.
Then to the well-trod stage anon,
If Jonson's learned sock be on,
Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child,
Warble his native wood-notes wild.
And ever, against eating cares,
Lap me in soft Lydian airs,
Married to immortal verse,
Such as the meeting soul may pierce,
In notes with many a winding bout
Of linked sweetness long drawn out
With wanton heed and giddy cunning,
The melting voice through mazes running,
Untwisting all the chains that tie
The hidden soul of harmony;
That Orpheus' self may heave his head
From golden slumber on a bed
Of heaped Elysian flowers, and hear
Such strains as would have won the ear
Of Pluto to have quite set free
His half-regained Eurydice.
These delights if thou canst give,
Mirth, with thee I mean to live. 

Felicity!
Who ope'st to none that knocks, yet, laughing weak,
Yield'st all to Love that will not seek,
And who, though won, wilt droop and die,
Unless wide doors bespeak thee free,
How safe's the bond of thee and me,
Since thee I cherish and defy!
Is't Love or Friendship, Dearest, we obey?
Ah, thou art young, and I am gray;
But happy man is he who knows
How well time goes,
With no unkind intruder by,
Between such friends as thou and I!
'Twould wrong thy favour, Sweet, were I to say,
'Tis best by far,
When best things are not possible,
To make the best of those that are;
For, though it be not May,
Sure, few delights of Spring excel
The beauty of this mild September day!
So with me walk,
And view the dreaming field and bossy Autumn wood,
And how in humble russet goes
The Spouse of Honour, fair Repose,
Far from a world whence love is fled 
And truth is dying because joy is dead;
And, if we hear the roaring wheel
Let us to stiller place retire
And glad admire
How, near Him, sounds of working cease
In little fervour and much peace;
And let us talk
Of holy things in happy mood,
Learnt of thy blest twin-sister, Certitude;
Or let's about our neighbours chat,
Well praising this, less praising that,
And judging outer strangers by
Those gentle and unsanction'd lines
To which remorse of equity
Of old hath moved the School divines.
Or linger where this willow bends,
And let us, till the melody be caught,
Harken that sudden, singing thought,
On which unguess'd increase to life perchance depends.
He ne'er hears twice the same who hears
The songs of heaven's unanimous spheres,
And this may be the song to make, at last, amends
For many sighs and boons in vain long sought!
Now, careless, let us stray, or stop
To see the partridge from the covey drop,
Or, while the evening air's like yellow wine,
From the pure stream take out
The playful trout,
That jerks with rasping check the struggled line;
Or to the Farm, where, high on trampled stacks,
The labourers stir themselves amain
To feed with hasty sheaves of grain
The deaf'ning engine's boisterous maw,
And snatch again,
From to-and-fro tormenting racks, 
The toss'd and hustled straw;
Whilst others tend the shedded wheat
That fills yon row of shuddering sacks,
Or shift them quick, and bind them neat,
And dogs and boys with sticks
Wait, murderous, for the rats that leave the ruin'd ricks;
And, all the bags being fill'd and rank'd fivefold, they pour
The treasure on the barn's clean floor,
And take them back for more,
Until the whole bared harvest beauteous lies
Under our pleased and prosperous eyes.
Then let us give our idlest hour
To the world's wisdom and its power;
Hear famous Golden-Tongue refuse
To gander sauce that's good for goose,
Or the great Clever Party con
How many grains of sifted sand,
Heap'd, make a likely house to stand,
How many fools one Solomon.
Science, beyond all other lust
Endow'd with appetite for dust,
We glance at where it grunts, well-sty'd,
And pass upon the other side.
Pass also by, in pensive mood,
Taught by thy kind twin-sister, Certitude,
Yon puzzled crowd, whose tired intent
Hunts like a pack without a scent.
And now come home,
Where none of our mild days
Can fail, though simple, to confess
The magic of mysteriousness;
For there 'bide charming Wonders three,
Besides, Sweet, thee,
To comprehend whose commonest ways,
Ev'n could that be,
Were coward's 'vantage and no true man's praise.



She is standing on my lids 
And her hair is in my hair
She has the colour of my eye 
She has the body of my hand 
In my shade she is engulfed 
As a stone against the sky

She will never close her eyes 
And she does not let me sleep 
And her dreams in the bright day 
Make the suns evaporate 
And me laugh cry and laugh 
Speak when I have nothing to say


And I have come upon this place
By lost ways, by a nod, by words,
By faces, by an old man's face
At Morlaix lifted to the birds,

By hands upon the tablecloth
At Aldebori's, by the thin
Child's hands that opened to the moth
And let the flutter of the moonlight in,

By hands, by voices, by the voice
Of Mrs. Whitman on the stair,
By Margaret's 'If we had the choice
To choose or not - 'through her thick hair,

By voices, by the creak and fall
Of footsteps on the upper floor,
By silence waiting in the hall
Between the doorbell and the door,

By words, by voices, a lost way - ,
And here above the chimney stack
The unknown constellations sway -
And by what way shall I go back

I

Angel Heurtebise on the steps
Beats me with his wings
Of watered silk, refreshes my memory,
The rascal, motionless
And alone with me on the agate
Which breaks, ass, your supernatural
Pack-saddle.

II

Ang el Heurtebise with incredible
Brutality jumps on me. Please
Don't jump so hard,
Beastly fellow, flower of tall
Stature.
You've laid me up. That's
Bad manners. I hold the ace, see?
What do you have?

III

Angel Heurtebise pushes me;
Lift me, raise me to the corner
Of your pointed knees;
Undiluted pleasure. Thumb, untie
The rope! I die.

IV

Angel Heurtebise and angel
Cegeste killed in the war-what a wondrous
Name-play
The role of scarecrows
Whose gesture no frightens
The cherries on the heavenly cherry trees
Under the church's folding door
Accustomed to the gesture yes.

V

My guardian angel, Heurtebise,
I guard you, I hit you,
I break you, I change
Your guard every hour.
On guard, summer! I challenge
You, if you're a man. Admit
Your beauty, angel of white lead,
Caught in a photograph by an
Explosion of magnesium. 

Eclogue

The Faun


These nymphs, I would perpetuate them.
So bright
Their crimson flesh that hovers there, light
In the air drowsy with dense slumbers. 
Did I love a dream?
My doubt, mass of ancient night, ends extreme
In many a subtle branch, that remaining the true
Woods themselves, proves, alas, that I too
Offered myself, alone, as triumph, the false ideal of roses.

Let’s see

or if those women you note
Reflect your fabulous senses’ desire!
Faun, illusion escapes from the blue eye,
Cold, like a fount of tears, of the most chaste:
But the other, she, all sighs, contrasts you say
Like a breeze of day warm on your fleece?
No! Through the swoon, heavy and motionless
Stifling with heat the cool morning’s struggles
No water, but that which my flute pours, murmurs
To the grove sprinkled with melodies: and the sole breeze
Out of the twin pipes, quick to breathe
Before it scatters the sound in an arid rain,
Is unstirred by any wrinkle of the horizon,
The visible breath, artificial and serene,
Of inspiration returning to heights unseen.

O Sicilian shores of a marshy calm
My vanity plunders vying with the sun,
Silent beneath scintillating flowers, RELATE
‘That I was cutting hollow reeds here tamed
By talent: when, on the green gold of distant
Verdure offering its vine to the fountains,
An animal whiteness undulates to rest:
And as a slow prelude in which the pipes exist
This flight of swans, no, of Naiads cower
Or plunge-’
Inert, all things burn in the tawny hour
Not seeing by what art there fled away together
Too much of hymen desired by one who seeks there
The natural A: then I’ll wake to the primal fever
Erect, alone, beneath the ancient flood, light’s power,
Lily! And the one among you all for artlessness.

Other than this sweet nothing shown by their lip, the kiss
That softly gives assurance of treachery,
My breast, virgin of proof, reveals the mystery
Of the bite from some illustrious tooth planted;
Let that go! Such the arcane chose for confidant,
The great twin reed we play under the azure ceiling,
That turning towards itself the cheek’s quivering,
Dreams, in a long solo, so we might amuse
The beauties round about by false notes that confuse
Between itself and our credulous singing;
And create as far as love can, modulating,
The vanishing, from the common dream of pure flank
Or back followed by my shuttered glances,
Of a sonorous, empty and monotonous line.

Try then, instrument of flights, O malign
Syrinx by the lake where you await me, to flower again!
I, proud of my murmur, intend to speak at length
Of goddesses: and with idolatrous paintings
Remove again from shadow their waists’ bindings:
So that when I’ve sucked the grapes’ brightness
To banish a regret done away with by my pretence,
Laughing, I raise the emptied stem to the summer’s sky
And breathing into those luminous skins, then I,
Desiring drunkenness, gaze through them till evening.

O nymphs, let’s rise again with many memories.
‘My eye, piercing the reeds, speared each immortal
Neck that drowns its burning in the water
With a cry of rage towards the forest sky;
And the splendid bath of hair slipped by
In brightness and shuddering, O jewels!
I rush there: when, at my feet, entwine (bruised
By the languor tasted in their being-two’s evil)
Girls sleeping in each other’s arms’ sole peril:
I seize them without untangling them and run
To this bank of roses wasting in the sun
All perfume, hated by the frivolous shade
Where our frolic should be like a vanished day.’

I adore you, wrath of virgins, O shy
Delight of the nude sacred burden that glides
Away to flee my fiery lip, drinking
The secret terrors of the flesh like quivering
Lightning: from the feet of the heartless one
To the heart of the timid, in a moment abandoned
By innocence wet with wild tears or less sad vapours. 
‘Happy at conquering these treacherous fears
My crime’s to have parted the dishevelled tangle
Of kisses that the gods kept so well mingled:
For I’d scarcely begun to hide an ardent laugh
In one girl’s happy depths (holding back
With only a finger, so that her feathery candour
Might be tinted by the passion of her burning sister,
The little one, naïve and not even blushing)
Than from my arms, undone by vague dying,
This prey, forever ungrateful, frees itself and is gone,
Not pitying the sob with which I was still drunk.’

No matter! Others will lead me towards happiness
By the horns on my brow knotted with many a tress:
You know, my passion, how ripe and purple already
Every pomegranate bursts, murmuring with the bees:
And our blood, enamoured of what will seize it,
Flows for all the eternal swarm of desire yet.
At the hour when this wood with gold and ashes heaves
A feast’s excited among the extinguished leaves:
Etna! It’s on your slopes, visited by Venus
Setting in your lava her heels so artless,
When a sad slumber thunders where the flame burns low.

O certain punishment- 
No, but the soul
Void of words, and this heavy body, 
Succumb to noon’s proud silence slowly:
With no more ado, forgetting blasphemy, I 
Must sleep, lying on the thirsty sand, and as I 
Love, open my mouth to wine’s true constellation!

Farewell to you, both: I go to see the shadow you have become. 



Spiritual Dawn

When debauchees are roused by the white, rosy dawn, 
Escorted by the Ideal which gnaws at their hearts 
Through the action of a mysterious, vengeful law, 
In the somnolent brute an Angel awakens.

The inaccessible blue of Spiritual Heavens, 
For the man thrown to earth who suffers and still dreams, 
Opens and yawns with the lure of the abyss. 

Over the smoking ruins of stupid orgies, 
Your memory, clearer, more rosy, more charming, 
Hovers incessantly before my widened eyes.

The sunlight has darkened the flame of the candles; 
Thus, ever triumphant, resplendent soul! 
Your phantom is like the immortal sun!



Spiritual Dawn 

When in the company of the Ideal 
(That gnawing tooth) Dawn enters, white and pink, 
The rooms of rakes — each sated beast can feel 
An Angel waking through the fumes of drink.

For downcast Man, who dreams and suffers still, 
The azure of the mystic heaven above, 
With gulf-like vertigo, attracts his will. 

Over the smoking wreck of feasts and scandals, 
Your phantom, rosy and enchanting, flies 
And still returns to my dilated eyes.

The sun has blackened out the flame of candles. 
So your victorious phantom seems as one, 
O blazing spirit, with the deathless Sun!



L'Aube spirituelle

when to the drunkard's room the flushing East
comes with her comrade sharply-clawed, the Dream,
she wakens, by a dark avenging scheme,
an angel in the dull besotted beast.

deep vaults of inaccessible azure there,
before the dreamer sick with many a phasm,
open, abysmal as a beckoning chasm.
thus, deity, all pure clear light and air,

over the stupid orgy's reeking track
— brighter and lovelier yet, thine image flies
in fluttering rays before my widening eyes.

the sun has turned the candles' flame to black;
even so, victorious always, thou art one
— resplendent spirit! — with the eternal sun!







He loves to give light
To those deprived of sight.
Hence for them he opened 
A school in his premises.
In those little eyes 
Which saw no skies
But still desired to rise
He saw a fresh delight
For the fragrance of flowers
They knew not
Were red or white.
So whence
I know not
But he has brought
A breed of thornless roses
By their windows
To give them 
The delight of the scent
The source of which 
When they will run
Their fingers to feel
That their fingers
May not bleed, 
That they may enjoy a joy
Which inflicts no pain! 
Oh, is not he himself 
A special breed of rose? ! 
A rose without thorns
That he so kindly gave
To us, to this world



Childhood

The Child was singing, and the Mother lay
Stretched on the bed which pain and anguish throng,
Death's cloud fast closing on her parting day:
I heard her laboring breath, I heard the song. 

The Child its gambols by the lattice plied;
Its sport, its laughter, sounded glad and bright;
And the poor Mother by her darling's side,
Who sang all day, coughed through the painful night. 

The Mother sleeps the cloister's stones below;
The Child sings, heedless of its orphan state:
On boughs too feeble to support its weight. 

Ye voices, that arose
After the Evening's close,
And whispered to my restless heart repose!

Go, breathe it in the ear
Of all who doubt and fear,
And say to them, "Be of good cheer!"

Ye sounds, so low and calm,
That in the groves of balm
Seemed to me like an angel's psalm!

Go, mingle yet once more
With the perpetual roar
Of the pine forest dark and hoar!

Tongues of the dead, not lost
But speaking from deaths frost,
Like fiery tongues at Pentecost!

Glimmer, as funeral lamps,
Amid the chills and darn ps
Of the vast plain where Death encamps

Oh, awful Power whose works repel
The marvel of the earth's designs,--
I 'll hie me otherwhere to dwell,
Arcadia has trolley lines. 

Princess, by whom my hope is fed, 
My heart thee prays in lowlihead 
To prune the ill boughs overgrown, 
Nor slay Love's tree, nor plant instead 

dark 
gloomy 
an elegy
an adagio 

dreary battlefield
muffled bells 
scream
tears

a thundering
interrupted 
calmed
lonely

up and fall of
human spirits
battle trumpets
the sudden call 

deep, somber
funeral march 
modulates into 
stunning melody

dismal sense of hope
heroic march 
triumphant 
valiant 

a vigorous cascades 
powerful, emphatic
a sudden drop
into quiet

no more lip service
no more arrogant
no more promise
no more speech




The Man Who Tortures Himself

I shall strike you without anger
And without hate, like a butcher,
As Moses struck the rock!
And from your eyelids I shall make

The waters of suffering gush forth
To inundate my Sahara.
My desire swollen with hope
Will float upon your salty tears

Like a vessel which puts to sea, 
And in my heart that they'll make drunk 
Your beloved sobs will resound 
Like a drum beating the charge!

Am I not a discord 
In the heavenly symphony, 
Thanks to voracious Irony 
Who shakes me and who bites me?

She's in my voice, the termagant! 
All my blood is her black poison! 
I am the sinister mirror 
In which the vixen looks.

I am the wound and the dagger! 
I am the blow and the cheek! 
I am the members and the wheel, 
Victim and executioner!

I'm the vampire of my own heart
— One of those utter derelicts 
Condemned to eternal laughter, 
But who can no longer smile!



Heautontimoroumenos 

I'll strike you, but without the least
Anger — as butchers poll an ox,
Or Moses, when he struck the rocks — 
That from your eyelid thus released,

The lymph of suffering may brim
To slake my desert of its drought.
So my desire, by hope made stout,
Upon your salty tears may swim,

Like a proud ship, far out from shore. 
Within my heart, which they'll confound 
With drunken joy, your sobs will sound 
Like drums that beat a charge in war.

I am I not a faulty chord 
In all this symphony divine, 
Thanks to the irony malign 
That shakes and cuts me like a sword?

It's in my voice, the raucous jade! 
It's in my blood's black venom too! 
I am the looking-glass, wherethrough 
Megera sees herself portrayed!

I am the wound, and yet the blade! 
The smack, and yet the cheek that takes it! 
The limb, and yet the wheel that breaks it, 
The torturer, and he who's flayed!

One of the sort whom all revile, 
A Vampire, my own blood I quaff, 
Condemned to an eternal laugh 
Because I know not how to smile.



Heauton Timoroumenos

I mean to strike you without hate,
As butchers do; as Moses did
The rock. From under either lid
Your tears will flow to inundate

This huge Sahara which is I.
My heart, insensible with pain,
Caught in that flood will live again:
Will care whether it live or die — 

Will strive as in the salty sea,
Drunken with brine and all but drowned,
Yet driven onward by the sound
Of your wild sobbing endlessly!

For look — I am at war, my dear, 
With the whole universe. I know 
There is no medicine for my woe. 
Believe me, it is called Despair.

It runs in all my veins. I pray: 
It cries in all my words. I am 
The very glass where what I damn 
Leers and admires itself all day.

I am the wound — I am the knife 
The deep wound scabbards; the outdrawn 
Rack, and the writhing thereupon; 
The lifeless, and the taker of life.

I murder what I most adore, 
Laughing: I am indeed of those 
Condemned for ever without repose 
To laugh — but who can smile no more.




Heautontimoroumenos
The Man Who Tortures Himself


I shall cleave without scrape or shock, 
And, like a butcher, without hate, 
Like Moses, when he struck the rock. 
From your eyes I shall generate 
Waters of woe throughout the years 
To quench my fierce Sahara fires, 
Swollen with vast hope, my desires 
Shall float upon your bitter tears 
Like a proud vessel, sailing large; 
And in my heart, drunk at the sound, 
Your cherished sobbing shall resound 
Like drums beating the long lost charge.

Am I not a discordant note 
In the celestial symphony, 
Thanks to voracious Irony 
Who shakes and bites me at the throat? 
She's in my voice, the scold; her black 
Poison is all my blood, alas! 
I am the direful looking glass 
Which flashes her reflection back. 
I am the wound, the knives that strike, 
The blows that crush, the head that reels, 
I am wrenched limbs and grinding wheels, 
Victim and hangman, as you like!

Vampire of my own heart, meanwhile, 
A derelict, I am of those 
Doomed to eternal laughter's throes, 
Yet powerless to frame a smile!





I'll strike thee without enmity
nor wrath, like butchers at the block,
like Moses when he smote the rock!
I'll make those eyelids gush for me

with springs of suffering, whose flow
shall slake the desert of my thirst;
— a salt flood, where my lust accurst,
with Hope to plump her sail, shall go

as from the port a pitching barge,
and in my heart they satiate
thy sobs I love shall fulminate
loud as a drum that beats a charge!

for am I not a clashing chord
in all Thy heavenly symphony,
thanks to this vulture Irony

she's in my voice, the screaming elf!
my poisoned blood came all from her!
I am the mirror sinister
in which the vixen sees herself!

I am the wound and I the knife!
I am the blow I give, and feel!
I am the broken limbs, the wheel, 
the hangman and the strangled life!

I am my heart's own vampire, for
these lips can never smile again,
but laugh they must, and evermore!




Man and the Sea
Free man, you will always cherish the sea! 
The sea is your mirror; you contemplate your soul 
In the infinite unrolling of its billows; 
Your mind is an abyss that is no less bitter.

You like to plunge into the bosom of your image; 
You embrace it with eyes and arms, and your heart 
Is distracted at times from its own clamoring 
By the sound of this plaint, wild and untamable.

Both of you are gloomy and reticent:
Man, no one has sounded the depths of your being;
O Sea, no person knows your most hidden riches,
So zealously do you keep your secrets!


Yet for countless ages you have fought each other
Without pity, without remorse,
So fiercely do you love carnage and death,
O eternal fighters, implacable brothers!



Man and the Sea 

Free man, you'll always love the sea — for this, 
That it's a mirror, where you see your soul 
In its eternal waves that chafe and roll; 
Nor is your soul less bitter an abyss.

in your reflected image there to merge, 
You love to dive, its eyes and limbs to match. 
Sometimes your heart forgets its own, to catch 
The rhythm of that wild and tameless dirge.

The two of you are shadowy, deep, and wide. 
Man! None has ever plummeted your floor — 
Sea! None has ever known what wealth you store — 
Both are so jealous of the things you hide!

Yet age on age is ended, or begins,
While you without remorse or pity fight.
So much in death and carnage you delight,
Eternal wrestlers! Unrelenting twins!



Man and the Sea

Free man, you shall forever cherish the vast sea,
The sea, that image where you contemplate your soul
As everlastingly its mighty waves unroll.
Your mind a yawning gulf seasoned as bitterly.

You love to plunge into your image to the core,
Embracing it with eyes and arms; your very heart
Sometimes finds a distraction from its urgent smart 
In the wild sea's untamable and plaintive roar.

Both of you live in darkness and in mystery:
Man, who has ever plumbed the far depths of your being?
O Sea, who knows your private hidden riches, seeing
How strange the secrets you preserve so jealously?

And yet for countless ages you have fought each other 
With hands unsparing and with unforbearing breath, 
Each an eternal foe to his relentless brother, 
So avid are you both of slaughter and of death.






L'Homme et le Mer

love Ocean always, Man: ye both are free!
the Sea, thy mirror: thou canst find thy soul
in the unfurling billows' surging roll,
they mind's abyss is bitter as the sea.

thou doest rejoice thy mirrored face to pierce, 
plunging, and clasp with eyes and arms; thy heart
at its own mutter oft forgets to start,
lulled by that plaint indomitably fierce.

discreet ye both are; both are taciturn:
Man, none has measured all thy dark abyss,
none, Sea, knows where thy hoarded treasure is, 
so jealously your secrets ye inurn!

and yet for countless ages, trucelessly,
— o ruthless warriors! — ye have fought and striven:
brothers by lust for death and carnage driven,
twin wrestlers, gripped for all eternity!






The Clock

Impassive clock! Terrifying, sinister god, 
Whose finger threatens us and says: 'Remember! 
The quivering Sorrows will soon be shot 
Into your fearful heart, as into a target;

Nebulous pleasure will flee toward the horizon 
Like an actress who disappears into the wings; 
Every instant devours a piece of the pleasure 
Granted to every man for his entire season.

Three thousand six hundred times an hour, Second
Whispers: Remember! — Immediately
With his insect voice, Now says: I am the Past
And I have sucked out your life with my filthy trunk!

Remember! Souviens-toi, spendthrift! Esto memor!
(My metal throat can speak all languages.)
Minutes, blithesome mortal, are bits of ore
That you must not release without extracting the gold!

Remember, Time is a greedy player 
Who wins without cheating, every round! It's the law. 
The daylight wanes; the night deepens; remember! 
The abyss thirsts always; the water-clock runs low.

Soon will sound the hour when divine Chance, 
When august Virtue, your still virgin wife, 
When even Repentance (the very last of inns!), 
When all will say: Die, old coward! it is too late!'



The Clock 

The Clock, calm evil god, that makes us shiver, 
With threatening finger warns us each apart:
'Remember! Soon the vibrant woes will quiver, 
Like arrows in a target, in your heart.

To the horizon Pleasure will take flight 
As flits a vaporous sylphide to the wings. 
Each instant gnaws a crumb of the delight 
That for his season every mortal brings.

Three thousand times and more, each hour, the second 
Whispers 'Remember!' Like an insect shrill 
The present chirps, 'With Nevermore I'm reckoned, 
I've pumped your lifeblood with my loathsome bill.'

Remember! Souviens-toi I Esto Memor! 
My brazen windpipe speaks in every tongue. 
Each moment, foolish mortal, is like ore 
From which the precious metal must be wrung.

Remember. Time the gamester (it's the law) 
Wins always, without cheating. Daylight wanes. 
Night deepens. The abyss with gulfy maw 
Thirsts on unsated, while the hour-glass drains.

Sooner or later, now, the time must be 
When Hazard, Virtue (your still-virgin mate), 
Repentance, (your last refuge), or all three — 
Will tell you, 'Die, old Coward. It's too late!''



The Clock

Saying all day, 'Remember! Remember and beware: 
There is no arrow of pain but in a tiny hour 
Will make thy heart its target, and stick and vibrate there.

'Toward the horizon all too soon and out of sight 
Vaporous Pleasure, like a sylphide, floats away; 
Each instant swallows up one crumb of that delight 
Accorded to each man for all his mortal day.'

The Second says, three thousand six hundred times an hour, 
'Remember! Look, the winged insect Now doth sit 
Upon thy vein, and shrilleth, 'I am Nevermore, 
And I have sucked thy blood; I am flying away with it!'

'Remember! Souviens-toi! Esto memor! — no tongue
My metal larynx does not speak — O frivolous man,
These minutes, rich in gold, slide past; thou art not young;
Remember! and wash well the gravel in the pan!

'Remember! Time, the player that need not cheat to win, 
Makes a strong adversary. Is thy game begun? 
Thy game is lost! Day wanes; night waxes. Look within 
The gulf, — it still is thirsty. The sands are all but run.

'Soon, soon, the hour will strike, when Hazard, he that showed 
A god-like face, when Virtue — thy bride, but still intact — 
When even Repentance (oh, last inn along the road!) 
Will say to thee, 'Die, coward. It is too late to act.''






The Ideal

It will never be the beauties that vignettes show, Those damaged products of a good-for-nothing age, 
Their feet shod with high shoes, hands holding castanets, 
Who can ever satisfy any heart like mine.

I leave to Gavarni, poet of chlorosis, 
His prattling troop of consumptive beauties, 
For I cannot find among those pale roses 
A flower that is like my red ideal.

The real need of my heart, profound as an abyss, 
Is you, Lady Macbeth, soul so potent in crime, 
The dream of Aeschylus, born in the land of storms;

Or you, great Night, daughter of Michelangelo, 
Who calmly contort, reclining in a strange pose 
Your charms molded by the mouths of Titans!



The Ideal 

It's not with smirking beauties of vignettes, 
The shopsoiled products of a worthless age, 
With buskined feet and hands for castanets — 
A heart like mine its longing could assuage.

I leave Gavarni, poet of chloroses, 
His twittering flock, anaemic and unreal. 
I could not find among such bloodless roses, 
A flower to match my crimson-hued ideal.

To this heart deeper than the deepest canyon,
Lady Macbeth would be a fit companion,
Crime-puissant dream of Aeschylus; or you,

Daughter of Buonarroti, stately Night!
Whose charms to suit a Titan's appetite,
You twist, so strange, yet peaceful, to the view.



The Ideal

No beauties such as figure in vignettes, 
Monsters of a vain era's lame design, 
With feet for buskins, hands for castanets, 
Can ever satisfy a heart like mine. 
I leave to Gavarni's chlorotic Muse 
These sickly prattling nymphs, however real; 
Not one of these pale roses would I choose 
To match the flowers of my red ideal.

What my heart, deep as an abyss, demands, 
Lady Macbeth, is your brave bloody hands, 
And, Aeschylus, your dreams of rage and fright, 
Or you, vast Night, daughter of Angelo's, 
Who peacefully twist into a strange pose 
Charms fashioned for a Titan's mouth to bite.





'twill be no lovely girls of our vignettes
— spoiled fruits our worthless epoch deems divine —
slim slippered feet, hands made for castagnettes,
that shall content this questing heart of mine.

I leave to great Gavarni, bard of blight,
his prattling beauties with their frail appeal.
I cannot find among his roses white
the flaming flower of my red ideal.

I crave, to fill my heart's abyss of death,
thy passion, fair and merciless Macbeth, 
whom Aeschylus might not have dreamed in boreal snows;

or thine, great Night, in Bunarroti's South,
tranquilly turning in a monstrous pose
thy bosom fashioned by a Titan's mouth!

Vultures roaming around me
Every second of
Every day. 
Escape

Lust
On top of
Varying
Emotions









Deign at my hands this crown of prayer and praise, 
Weaved in my lone devout melancholy, 
Thou which of good hast, yea, art treasury, 
All changing unchanged Ancient of days. 
But do not with a vile crown of frail bays 
Reward my Muse's white sincerity ; 
But what Thy thorny crown gain'd, that give me, 
A crown of glory, which doth flower always. 
The ends crown our works, but Thou crown'st our ends, 
For at our ends begins our endless rest. 
The first last end, now zealously possess'd, 
With a strong sober thirst my soul attends. 
'Tis time that heart and voice be lifted high ; 
Salvation to all that will is nigh. 



For I was a gaunt, grave councillor
Being in all things wise, and very old,
But I have put aside this folly and the cold
That old age weareth for a cloak.

I was quite strong-at least they said so-
The young men at the sword-play;
But I have put aside this folly, being gay
In another fashion that more suiteth me.

I have curled 'mid the boles of the ash wood,
I have hidden my face where the oak
Spread his leaves over me, and the yoke
Of the old ways of men have I cast aside.

By the still pool of Mar-nan-otha
Have I found me a bride
That was a dog-wood tree some syne.
She hath called me from mine old ways
She hath hushed my rancour of council,
Bidding me praise

Naught but the wind that flutters in the leaves.

She hath drawn me from mine old ways,
Till men say that I am mad;
But I have seen the sorrow of men, and am glad,
For I know that the wailing and bitterness are a folly.

And I? I have put aside all folly and all grief.
I wrapped my tears in an ellum leaf
And left them under a stone
And now men call me mad because I have thrown
All folly from me, putting it aside
To leave the old barren ways of men,
Because my bride
Is a pool of the wood, and
Though all men say that I am mad
It is only that I am glad,
Very glad, for my bride hath toward me a great love
That is sweeter than the love of women
That plague and burn and drive one away.

Aie-e! 'Tis true that I am gay
Quite gay, for I have her alone here
And no man troubleth us.

Once when I was among the young men . . .
And they said I was quite strong, among the young men.
Once there was a woman . . .
. . . but I forget . . . she was . .
.  I hope she will not come again.

.  I do not remember
.

I think she hurt me once, but . . .
That was very long ago.

I do not like to remember things any more.

I like one little band of winds that blow
In the ash trees here:
For we are quite alone
Here 'mid the ash trees. 

Your hair was full of roses in the dewfall as we danced, 
The sorceress enchanting and the paladin entranced, 
In the starlight as we wove us in a web of silk and steel 
Immemorial as the marble in the halls of Boabdil, 
In the pleasuance of the roses with the fountains and the yews 
Where the snowy Sierra soothed us with the breezes and the dews! 
In the starlight as we trembled from a laugh to a caress, 
Was the Baile de la Bona too seductive? Did you feel 
Through the silence and the softness all the tension of the steel? 
For your hair was full of roses, and my flesh was full of thorns, 
And the midnight came upon us worth a million crazy morns. 
Ah! my Gipsy, my Gitana, my Saliya! were you fain 
For the dance to turn to earnest? - O the sunny land of Spain! 
My Gitana, my Saliya! more delicious than a dove! 
With your hair aflame with roses and your lips alight with love! 
Shall I see you, shall I kiss you once again? I wander far 
From the sunny land of summer to the icy Polar Star. 
I shall find you, I shall have you! I am coming back again 
From the filth and fog to seek you in the sunny land of Spain. 
I shall find you, my Gitana, my Saliya! as of old 
With your hair aflame with roses and your body gay with gold. 
I shall find you, I shall have you, in the summer and the south 
With our passion in your body and our love upon your mouth - 
With our wonder and our worship be the world aflame anew! 
My Gitana, my Saliya! I am coming back to you




Breastfeeding was making a slow comeback 
. 
as ‘modern mothers' sensed formulas did lack - 
the best nutrients, including hormones, for a baby. 
Could I get to see lots of tits with LLL? I felt "maybe". 

An organization to promote breastfeeding was needed! ! 
[No moral conscience, no doubts of mine were heeded - 
by me.] 
I put an ad in the local newspapers advertising LLL. 
The results were overwhelming. Them, I'll now tell 
. 
you all. 

I had read some articles, and my ex-wife had breastfed 


our son. 
So, I thought, with a little razzle dazzle, I'd fool everyone. 
I'd run off some copies of articles and buy a breast pump to show. 
The main purpose would be to get 


WELL, I really didn't know. 

Perhaps I'd not thought it out as well as I should have. 
If I really were a woman, I'd show my tits. I would have. 
I had dreamed that the women would fall for my disguise. 
I had never dreamed they'd show up and bring their guys. 

At the first, and last, meeting, fifteen women did show, 
with five men (some husbands, some boyfriends)  in tow. 
That morning I was unexpectedly nervous. I said: "Be brave! " 
BUT I was so nervous that I forgot my morning shave. 
[and I don't mean of my legs or armpits! ] 

I didn't even realize it till I was making up my face, - 
and by then I was running late. I had to get to the meeting place, 

and I wasn't even dressed yet! 

My voice was high enough, I thought, to fool them all; 
my voice didn't deepen with puberty, and I was small - 
for a guy. 
I had a spiel all planned and I had some snacks to offer. 
I planned no dues to join, but would accept ‘donations' for my coffer. 
[after all I wanted to cover the costs of snacks and copies and the meeting place rental fee, AND newspaper ads] 

I also had a sign in book for all the women's names. 
[I'd not considered that LLL was NOT like children's games.] 
I think back now and know I probably could have had trouble. 
If only ONE detected my true sex, it might have burst my bubble. 

AND one did. In fact, I think a LOT MORE than one did! 
I won't explain what happened; I prefer the memory to be hid. 
Let's just say my plan didn't work out quite as I expected. 
But word spread of my idea for LLL, and LLL was resurrected --

by a WOMAN a few months later. 

OK! I can't keep it to myself. [About it, I no longer pout.] 
When I said I "dressed in drag", I had --not yet "come out". 
You see, I thought I wanted to see women's titties; it's true. 
I was raised a boy, and that's what men ‘should' want to do! 

But, at the first (and last)  meeting that I held, I met Matt. 
He was one of "the boyfriends", and not far from me he'd sat. 
A few months after we'd first exchanged brief glances, 
he contacted me. [He'd left his girlfriend. What were the chances? ? ] 

He didn't explain exactly why he was calling me. 
He just asked if we could meet when I had some time (free) . 
We met for coffee near where I had my home. 
I shaved, but wore a coat and tie, over which his eyes did roam. 

We chatted. I think he was bit nervous. I had a funny feeling. 
One thing led to another and in another month I was reeling --- 
with the realization that I was a guy but in fact I was GAY! 
It's odd how things work out sometimes, in the strangest way! 




O! You, Argent Beauty! 
On nights like these, 
You come closer than any other nights; 

In your plenitude, 
Close.  

so close. 

Are you curious 
About lovers' whispers
In your presence? 

Are you aware of me in my solitude.  
Or the effect of your mysterious radiance, 
In young hearts ardent with love? 

O! La Luna, La Luna. 
Nocturnal tempter amongst constellations; 
Anima brightens on nights like these! 

I'll wait for you tomorrow night, 
You.  

lucent and impassive Face, 
So distant.  

but, O! So alive! 

For you bring life to my spirit
And I feel Life -alive. 

C

Said, you needed some time, so I watched you walk away, 
determination was never a suit of strength worn by you.
I hadn't seen you in weeks after you claimed your freedom, 
I  never chased anyone who I felt didn't want to be caught.
This morning I heard a gentle tap, tap, tap at my door.

Yes, I had a feeling your freedom would not be a lasting one, 
this was on my mind as I took a slow walk through my vestibule;   
It wasn't you at the door but instead a local state trooper; 
He said they found you face down in the River Eau de Claire, 
a picture of us in your wallet, and an illegible penned note. 

You said you needed time, so I respected your wish and let you go..
I really thought you would call me. . when you'd had enough time.




A much-discerning Public hold
The Singer generally sings
And prints and sells his past for gold.

Whatever I may here disclaim,
The very clever folk I sing to
Will most indubitably cling to
Their pet delusion, just the same.


I had seen, as the dawn was breaking
And I staggered to my rest,
Tari Devi softly shaking
From the Cart Road to the crest.
I had seen the spurs of Jakko
Heave and quiver, swell and sink.
Was it Earthquake or tobacco,
Day of Doom, or Night of Drink?

In the full, fresh fragrant morning
I observed a camel crawl,
Laws of gravitation scorning,
On the ceiling and the wall;
Then I watched a fender walking,
And I heard grey leeches sing,
And a red-hot monkey talking
Did not seem the proper thing.

Then a Creature, skinned and crimson,
Ran about the floor and cried,
And they said that I had the "jims" on,
And they dosed me with bromide,
And they locked me in my bedroom --
Me and one wee Blood Red Mouse --
Though I said: "To give my head room
You had best unroof the house


But my words were all unheeded,
Though I told the grave 

That the treatment really needed
Was a dip in open sea
That was lapping just below me,
Smooth as silver, white as snow,
And it took three men to throw me
When I found I could not go.

Half the night I watched the Heavens
Fizz like 'champagne --
Fly to sixes and to sevens,
Wheel and thunder back again;
And when all was peace and order
Save one planet nailed askew,
Much I wept because my warder
Would not let me sit it true.

After frenzied hours of wating,
When the Earth and Skies were dumb,
Pealed an awful voice dictating
An interminable sum,
Changing to a tangle story --
"What she said you said I said" --
Till the Moon arose in glory,
And I found her . . . in my head;

Then a Face came, blind and weeping,
And It couldn't wipe its eyes,
And It muttered I was keeping
Back the moonlight from the skies;
So I patted it for pity,
But it whistled shrill with wrath,
And a huge black Devil City
Poured its peoples on my path.

So I fled with steps uncertain
On a thousand-year long race,
But the bellying of the curtain
Kept me always in one place;
While the tumult rose and maddened
To the roar of Earth on fire,
Ere it ebbed and sank and saddened
To a whisper tense as wire.

In tolerable stillness
Rose one little, little star,
And it chuckled at my illness,
And it mocked me from afar;
And its breathren came and eyed me,
Called the Universe to aid,
Till I lay, with naught to hide me,
'Neath' the Scorn of All Things Made.

Dun and saffron, robed and splendid,
Broke the solemn, pitying Day,
And I knew my pains were ended,
And I turned and tried to pray;
But my speech was shattered wholly,
And I wept as children weep.
Till the dawn-wind, softly, slowly,
Brought to burning eyelids sleep. 

About Soho we went before the light; 
We went, unresting six, craving new fun, 
New scenes, new raptures, for the fevered night 
Of rollicking laughter, drink and song, was done. 
The vault was void, but for the dawn's great star 
That shed upon our path its silver flame, 
When La Paloma on a low guitar 
Abruptly from a darkened casement came-- 
Harlem! All else shut out, I saw the hall, 
And you in your red shoulder sash come dancing 
With Val against me languid by the wall, 
Your burning coffee-colored eyes keen glancing 
Aslant at mine, proud in your golden glory! 
I loved you, Cuban girl, fond sweet Diory. 




To whom all this world fleeth for succour,
To have release of sin, of sorrow, of teen!
Glorious Virgin! of all flowers flow'r,
To thee I flee, confounded in errour!
Help and relieve, almighty debonair,
Have mercy of my perilous languour!
Vanquish'd me hath my cruel adversair.

B.

Bounty so fix'd hath in thy heart his tent,
That well I wot thou wilt my succour be;
Thou canst not warne that with good intent 
Asketh thy help, thy heart is ay so free!
Thou art largess of plein felicity,
Haven and refuge of quiet and rest!
Lo! how that thieves seven chase me!
Help, Lady bright, ere that my ship to-brest!

C.

Comfort is none, but in you, Lady dear!
For lo! my sin and my confusion,
Which ought not in thy presence to appear,
Have ta'en on me a grievous action,
Of very right and desperation!
And, as by right, they mighte well sustene
That I were worthy my damnation,

D.

That thou art cause of grace and mercy here;
Were now the bow y-bent, in such mannere
As it was first, of justice and of ire,
But through thee have we grace as we desire.

E.

Ever hath my hope of refuge in thee be';
For herebefore full oft in many a wise
Unto mercy hast thou received me.
But mercy, Lady! at the great assize,
When we shall come before the high Justice!
So little fruit shall then in me be found,
That, thou ere that day correcte me,
Of very right my work will me confound.

F.

Flying, I flee for succour to thy tent,
Me for to hide from tempest full of dread;
Beseeching you, that ye you not absent,
Though I be wick'. O help yet at this need!
All have I been a beast in wit and deed,
Yet, Lady! thou me close in with thy grace;
Thine enemy and mine, -- Lady, take heed! --
Unto my death in point is me to chase.

G.

Gracious Maid and Mother! which that never
Wert bitter nor in earthe nor in sea,
But full of sweetness and of mercy ever,
Help, that my Father be not wroth with me!
Speak thou, for I ne dare Him not see;
So have I done in earth, alas the while!
That, certes, but if thou my succour be,
To sink etern He will my ghost exile.

H.

He vouchesaf'd, tell Him, as was His will,
Become a man, as for our alliance,
And with His blood He wrote that blissful bill
Upon the cross, as general acquittance
To ev'ry penitent in full creance;
And therefore, Lady bright! thou for us pray;
Then shalt thou stenten alle His grievance,
And make our foe to failen of his prey.

I.

I wote well thou wilt be our succour,
Thou art so full of bounty in certain;
For, when a soule falleth in errour,
Thy pity go'th, and haleth him again;
Then makest thou his peace with his Sov'reign,
And bringest him out of the crooked street:
Whoso thee loveth shall not love in vain,
That shall he find as he the life shall lete.

K.

Kalendares illumined be they
That in this world be lighted with thy name;
And whoso goeth with thee the right way,
Him shall not dread in soule to be lame;
To whom I seeke for my medicine,
Let not my foe no more my wound entame;
My heal into thy hand all I resign.

L.

Lady, thy sorrow can I not portray
Under that cross, nor his grievous penance;
But, for your bothe's pain, I you do pray,
Let not our aller foe make his boastance,
That he hath in his listes, with mischance, 
Convicte that ye both have bought so dear;
As I said erst, thou ground of all substance!
Continue on us thy piteous eyen clear.

M.

Moses, that saw the bush of flames red
Burning, of which then never a stick brenn'd,
Was sign of thine unwemmed maidenhead.
Thou art the bush, on which there gan descend
The Holy Ghost, the which that Moses wend
Had been on fire; and this was in figure.
Now, Lady! from the fire us do defend,
Which that in hell eternally shall dure.

N.

Noble Princess! that never haddest peer;
Certes if any comfort in us be,
We have none other melody nor glee,
Us to rejoice in our adversity;
Nor advocate, that will and dare so pray
For us, and for as little hire as ye,
That helpe for an Ave-Mary or tway.

O.

O very light of eyen that be blind!
O very lust of labour and distress!
O treasurer of bounty to mankind!
From his ancill he made thee mistress
Of heav'n and earth, our billes up to bede;
This world awaiteth ever on thy goodness;
For thou ne failedst never wight at need.

P.

Purpose I have sometime for to enquere
Wherefore and why the Holy Ghost thee sought,
When Gabrielis voice came to thine ear;
He not to war us such a wonder wrought,
But for to save us, that sithens us bought:
Then needeth us no weapon us to save,
But only, where we did not as we ought,
Do penitence, and mercy ask and have.

Q.

That I aguilt have bothe Him and thee,
And that my soul is worthy for to sink,
Alas! I, caitiff, whither shall I flee?
Who shall unto thy Son my meane be?
Who, but thyself, that art of pity well?
Thou hast more ruth on our adversity
Than in this world might any tongue tell!

R.

Redress me, Mother, and eke me chastise!
For certainly my Father's chastising
I dare not abiden in no wise,
So hideous is his full reckoning.
Mother! of whom our joy began to spring,
Be ye my judge, and eke my soule's leach;
For ay in you is pity abounding
To each that will of pity you beseech.

S.

Sooth is it that He granteth no pity
Forgiveth none, but it like unto thee;
He hath thee made vicar and mistress
Of all this world, and eke governess
Of heaven; and represseth his justice
After thy will; and therefore in witness
He hath thee crowned in so royal wise.

T.

From which, these misbeliev'd deprived be,
To you my soule penitent I bring;
Receive me, for I can no farther flee.
For which the earth accursed was full yore,
I am so wounded, as ye may well see,
That I am lost almost, it smart so sore!

V.

Virgin! that art so noble of apparail,
That leadest us into the highe tow'r
Of Paradise, thou me wiss and counsail
How I may have thy grace and thy succour;
All have I been in filth and in errour,
Lady! *on that country thou me adjourn,
That called is thy bench of freshe flow'r,
There as that mercy ever shall sojourn.

X.

Xpe thy Son, that in this world alight,
Upon a cross to suffer his passioun,
And suffer'd eke that Longeus his heart pight,
And made his hearte-blood to run adown;
And all this was for my salvatioun:
And I to him am false and eke unkind,
And yet he wills not my damnation;
This thank I you, succour of all mankind!

Y.

Ysaac was figure of His death certain,
That so farforth his father would obey,
That him ne raughte nothing to be slain;
Right so thy Son list as a lamb to dey:
Now, Lady full of mercy! I you pray,
Since he his mercy 'sured me so large,
Be ye not scant, for all we sing and say,
That ye be from vengeance alway our targe.

Z.

Zachary you calleth the open well
That washed sinful soul out of his guilt;
Therefore this lesson out I will to tell,
That, n'ere thy tender hearte, we were spilt.
Now, Lady brighte! since thou canst and wilt,
Be to the seed of Adam merciable;
Bring us unto that palace that is built
To penitents that be *to mercy able

There are taller than you, taller.
There are purer than you, purer.
There are lovelier than you, lovelier.

When you go through the streets
No one recognizes you.
No one sees your crystal crown, no one looks
At the carpet of red gold
That you tread as you pass,
The nonexistent carpet.

And when you appear
All the rivers sound
In my body, bells
Shake the sky,
And a hymn fills the world.

Only you and I,
Only you and I, my love,
Listen to me.




Alone, I whet my soul against the keen
Unwrinkled sky, with its long stretching blue.
I polish it with sunlight and pale dew,
And damascene it with young blowing leaves.
Into the handle of my life I set
Sprigs of mignonette
And periwinkle,
Twisted into sheaves.
The colors laugh and twinkle.
Twined bands of roadways, liquid in the sheen
Of street lamps and the ruby shine of cabs,
Glisten for my delight all down its length;
And there are sudden sparks
Of morning ripplings over tree-fluttered pools.
My soul is fretted full of gleams and darks,
Pulsing and still.
Smooth-edged, untarnished, girded in my soul
I walk the world.

But in its narrow alleys,
The low-hung dust-thick valleys
Where the mob shuffles its empty tread,
My soul is blunted against dullard wits,
Smeared with sick juices,
Nicked impotent for other than low uses.
Its arabesques and sparkling subtleties
Crusted to grey, and all its changing surfaces
Spread with unpalpitant monotonies.

I re-create myself upon the polished sky:
A honing-strop above converging roofs.
The patterns show again, like buried proofs
Of old, lost empires bursting on the eye
In hieroglyphed and graven splendor.
The whirling winds brush past my head,
And prodigal once more, a reckless spender
Of disregarded beauty, a defender
Of undesired faiths,
walk the world. 



Here by the ample river’s argent sweep,
Bosomed in tilth and vintage to her walls,
A tower-crowned Cybele in armoured sleep
The city lies, fat plenty in her halls,
With calm parochial spires that hold in fee
The friendly gables clustered at their base,
And, equipoised o’er tower and market-place,
The Gothic minister’s winged immensity;
And in that narrow burgh, with equal mood,
Two placid hearts, to all life’s good resigned,
Might, from the altar to the lych-gate, find
Long years of peace and dreamless plenitude. 

Requiring something lovely on his arm
Took me to Stamford, Connecticut, a quasi-farm,
His family's; later picking up the mammoth
Girlfriend of Charlie, meanwhile trying to pawn me off
On some third guy also up for the weekend.
But Saturday we still were paired; spent
It sprawled across that sprawling acreage
Until the grass grew limp
with damp. Like me. Johnston-baby, I can still see
The pelted clover, burrs' prickle fur and gorged
Pastures spewing infinite tiny bells. You pimp. 

The rains that played havoc with your plans were due here by dawn
There were no puddles nor drops when the day began
Pure folly to think that the bales of hay would be brought in under dry skies
The farmers plight is to out-maneuver the weather
A moment passes as the east wind blows foul and the deluge commences

One hundred and twenty seven bales would need to be wrapped
All would need to be toted from one hundred acres
Before nine
Coffees were inhaled, rain-slickers applied
Faces lined with defeat head out into the storm
The sun would not rise on this day

Tractored paths give way to muddy ruts as the hay-wagons fall into well worn grooves
More moisture than the ground could absorb the trail now a rushing river
Instructions, directions compete with the sound of rain hitting plastic
Diesel engines strain as they idle, straining louder with each load
Hitching and unhitching wagons opening and closing gates
Hand signals replace the unheard voices that were greeted with shrugs

Seventy-three head of cattle penned in a pasture watch the passing parade
Water may be everywhere but they are cut off from their source
The hours pass, the rains ebb and flow, the temperature rises and falls and rises and falls again
Fences must be mended, vehicles must be towed, empty wagons must be moved
There can be no lunch for the dripping crew until there is first water for the herd

There are no quiet moments, no time for reflection
Eyes strain against the rain, the sodden foot moves gingerly on the clutch
A loss in focus could mean the loss of a digit, a limb or a morning of toil for not with an upended cart
Monet would not paint his grainstack haystacks in this tempest (though he had a penchant for the morn) 
A touch of frost was all that he could endure, all that he could immortalize
Brushstrokes of despair, colored gray, paint this pastoral canvas
A watercolor of frantic activity will not subside before the storm passes through

Mocking one and all the winds pick up as the chores wind down
Secure the gates, return the tractors to the barn and shed
Batten down the hatches they say at sea, on land it is lash down the barn doors before they blow
Tired, beaten but not defeated the wet and the weary exchange grins as they head in
The day is done, bales toted and wrapped, fences built and mended, cows free to roam and drink
Laughter fills the farmhouse as lunch delayed is now called supper and the sun breaks over the horizon. 

Where are the soldiers who march in line? 
Where are the soldiers every color and kind? 
Where are the soldiers who made their moms cry? 
Where are the pilots who face death in the sky? 

Where are the soldiers born brave of heart? 
Where are the girls and boys that part? 
Serving our country with their future on the line 
Battling the enemies of freedom of mind. 

All of us are soldiers with missions of our own 
We do what we do as history is sown. 
Support our troops who we love and adore 
Support our troops with prayers, letters and more. 

Where are the soldiers so far, far away? 
How many will perish no one can say. 
Where are the soldiers we love night and day? 
Deployed world over to keep evil at bay. 

That flag on the moon with red and white stripes
Proves America’s dreams come true.
A country of heroes who line up to protect
The past, the present and the few.



Unmatched 
Unparalleled 
Unimaginable 
Inimitable Pain, said, it is
Exclusively a woman only
Is made naturally to bear
Once borne, in her own way
Yields, yet incomparable  
World of satisfaction, joy 
And, most of all, divine love 
As well as the most sacrosanct 
Motherhood par divinity
For Universal sharing




	I.

Now that I, tying thy glass mask tightly,
May gaze thro' these faint smokes curling  whitely,
As thou pliest thy trade in this devil's-smithy---
Which is the poison to poison her, prithee?

	II.

He is with her, and they know that I know
Where they are, what they do: they believe my tears flow
While they laugh, laugh at me, at me fled to the drear

	III.

Grind away, moisten and mash up thy paste,
Pound at thy powder,---I am not in haste!
Better sit thus, and observe thy strange things,
Than go where men wait me and dance at the King's.

	IV.

That in the mortar---you call it a gum?
Ah, the brave tree whence such  gold  oozings come! 
And yonder soft phial, the exquisite blue,
Sure to taste sweetly,---is that poison too?

	V.

Had I but all of them, thee and thy treasures,
What a wild crowd of invisible pleasures!
To carry pure death in an earring, a casket,
A signet, a fan-mount, a filigree basket!

	VI.

Soon, at the King's, a mere lozenge to give,
And Pauline should have just thirty minutes to live!
But to light a pastile, and Elise, with her head
And her breast and her arms and her hands, should drop dead!

	VII.

Quick---is it finished? The colour's too grim!
Why not soft like the phial's, enticing and dim?
Let it brighten her drink, let her turn it and stir,
And try it and taste, ere she fix and prefer!

	VIII.

What a drop! She's not little, no minion like me!
That's why she ensnared him: this never will free
The soul from those masculine eyes,---Say, no!''
To that pulse's magnificent come-and-go.

	IX.

For only last night, as they whispered, I brought
My own eyes to bear on her so, that I thought
Could I keep them one half minute fixed, she would fall
Shrivelled; she fell not; yet this does it all!

	X.

Not that I bid you spare her the pain;
Let death be felt and the proof remain:
Brand, burn up, bite into its grace---
He is sure to remember her dying face!

Is it done? Take my mask off! Nay, be not morose;
It kills her, and this prevents seeing it close;
The delicate droplet, my whole fortune's fee!
If it hurts her, beside, can it ever hurt me?

	XII.

Now, take all my jewels, gorge gold to your fill,
You may kiss me, old man, on my mouth if you will!
But brush this dust off me, lest horror it brings
Ere I know it---next moment I dance at the King's

Saint Augustine! well hast thou said,
  That of our vices we can frame
A ladder, if we will but tread
  Beneath our feet each deed of shame!

All common things, each day's events,
  That with the hour begin and end,
Our pleasures and our discontents,
  Are rounds by which we may ascend.

The low desire, the base design,
  That makes another's virtues less;
The revel of the ruddy wine,
  And all occasions of excess;

The longing for ignoble things;
  The strife for triumph more than truth;
The hardening of the heart, that brings
  Irreverence for the dreams of youth;

All thoughts of ill; all evil deeds,
  That have their root in thoughts of ill;
Whatever hinders or impedes
 The action of the nobler will;--

All these must first be trampled down
  Beneath our feet, if we would gain
In the bright fields of fair renown
  The right of eminent domain.

We have not wings, we cannot soar;
  But we have feet to scale and climb
By slow degrees, by more and more,
  The cloudy summits of our time.

The mighty pyramids of stone
  That wedge-like cleave the desert airs,
When nearer seen, and better known,
  Are but gigantic flights of stairs.

The distant mountains, that uprear
  Their solid bastions to the skies,
Are crossed by pathways, that appear
  As we to higher levels rise.

The heights by great men reached and kept
  Were not attained by sudden flight,
But they, while their companions slept,
  Were toiling upward in the night.

Standing on what too long we bore
  With shoulders bent and downcast eyes,
We may discern--unseen before--
  A path to higher destinies.

Nor deem the irrevocable Past,
  As wholly wasted, wholly vain,
If, rising on its wrecks, at last
  To something nobler we attain. 

After chatting with each friend,
We our way to the table wend ;
On it we all do make a raid,
And this we call a Ladies' Aid.

'Tis pleasant way of taking tea, 
Improvement on the old soiree;
On such a time as this we find
Food for body and for mind.

Gladly all obey the call
To attend this pleasant social,
And we hope none will lament
The time and money they have spent.

The matron and the comely maid
And youths attend the Ladies' Aid ;
But now we close our short refrain, 
And hope to meet you all again. 

The Men go out and Hunt for Food
Women stay home and make there Brood
Then the men come back in a good Mood
Only to get, both ears Chewed! ! 

So then things Change, and the women hunt for a Meal
And all their men stay home and Invent the Wheel
Then the women come back with the Food
To find there men in a real good Mood

So either way the women will Complain
About men's cocks and having no Brains
Maybe someday this will all End
And all women will be our best Friend


Crying baby no more
Zest you give us we adore
And now you have grown
Real lady so cute in gown
Intelligently captivating
Neat and always energizing
Always adventuring.

Joy in your young heart
Often seen in your expressions of art
Young lady, just do your best part.

Seeing you today turned After leaving your age seventeen
High time for you now to probe
Innate potentials you got to prove
Diverse things that  are approve.

Unto this wild world I pray
Enthusiasm in all aspects require
Reserve wits for you to acquire
Real successess in this life
Even in becoming a plain wife
Right man you must choose to win
Or else your future as woman is ruin. 

As in sleeping-drink spices
softly she loosens in the liquid-clear
mirror her fatigued demeanor;
and she puts her smile deep inside.

And she waits while the liquid
rises from it; then she pours her hair
into the mirror, and, lifting one
wondrous shoulder from the evening gown,

she drinks quietly from her image. She drinks
what a lover would drink feeling dazed,
searching it, full of mistrust; and she only

beckons to her maid when at the bottom
of her mirror she finds candles, wardrobes,
and the cloudy dregs of a late hour.




When the busy day is done,
And my weary little one
Rocketh gently to and fro;
When the night winds softly blow,
And the crickets in the glen
Chirp and chirp and chirp again;
When upon the haunted green
Then from yonder misty skies
Cometh Lady Button-Eyes.

Through the murk and mist and gloam
To our quiet, cozy home,
Where to singing, sweet and low,
Rocks a cradle to and fro;
Where the clock's dull monotone
Telleth of the day that's done;
Where the moonbeams hover o'er
Playthings sleeping on the floor -
Where my weary wee one lies
Cometh Lady Button-Eyes.

Cometh like a fleeting ghost
From some distant eerie coast;
Never footfall can you hear
As that spirit fareth near -
Never whisper, never word
In ethereal raiment dight,
From the realm of fay and sprite
In the depth of yonder skies
Cometh Lady Button-Eyes.

Layeth she her hands upon
My dear weary little one,
And those white hands overspread
Like a veil the curly head,
Seem to fondle and caress
Every little silken tress;
Then she smooths the eyelids down
Over those two eyes of brown -
In such soothing, tender wise
Cometh Lady Button-Eyes.

Dearest, feel upon your brow
That caressing magic now;
For the crickets in the glen
Chirp and chirp and chirp again,
While upon the haunted green
And the moonbeams hover o'er
Playthings sleeping on the floor -
Hush, my sweet! from yonder skies
Cometh Lady Button-Eyes

Doctor of Medicine is your calling
Right vocation for a lady who is a darling.

Real few smart  gals like you have made it
Even those whose wealth are great can't buy it.
Many said you indeed is one of the exemplaries
Ethusiastic, intelligent and explores boundaries.
Daring as you are bold can go places
In the future you will find your own aces.
Onward in your quest for excellence my friend
Surely you will have it without an end.


Man of your dream will soon come
Endearing lover-husband he will become.
Nothing more in life you will be seeking
On that day none else you will be asking.
Real happiness is what you wll be enjoying. 

E. 

B. Browning


I turned -- Heaven knows we women turn too much
To broken reeds, mistaken so for pine
That shame forbids confession -- a handle I turned
(The wrong one, said the agent afterwards)
And so flung clean across your English street
Through the shrill-tinkling glass of the shop-front-paused,
Artemis mazed 'mid gauds to catch a man,
And piteous baby-caps and christening-gowns,
The worse for being worn on the radiator.

. . . . . . .

My cousin Romney judged me from the bench:
Propounding one sleek forty-shillinged law
That takes no count of the Woman's oversoul.
I should have entered, purred he, by the door --
The man's retort -- the open obvious door --
And since I chose not, he -- not he -- could change
The man's rule, not the Woman's, for the case.
Ten pounds or seven days.  Just that.  I paid

Upon Philippines shores
Sits this wonderful vessel
Who colors her canvas, 
With soft words that dance on ice, 
Her metaphorical lines, 
Plays melodies like harps
Her smiles brings a face smiles

She's a pawn that spreads hope
A crystal that brightens
With beauty within
To match a silver spring
She's the swam that shared its wings
Eyes in rhodora's face
The humbleness of mute brooks

Out of Divine's warm hand 
Comes our angelical flower
Whose roots has found a home
In our garden of friends.
Her presence has brought
Gladness into our air.

Where winds blow gracefully
And rivers flow calmly
Souls unlock great beauty
Where passion is more than art. 

Sits this beautiful poetess. 

Lady in Black

What made her turn so nasty? 
Only god would know.

She wore a long black habit
right down to the ground.
She never seemed to have a smile
all she did was frown.

She walked around her head bent down
you could feel the tension.
Her books aligned upon her desk
pencils they were sharpened.

You dare not turn to  look at her 
for fear of reprehension.
To use a word that's out of place
you're sure to get detention.
 
We read we write, stay very quite
try to go unnoticed.
You'd sit up straight, erect and wait
never dare to question.

The school bells rings, your head it swims
oh yes, we have survived it.
Another day of hell to pay
if sister Mary deems it.

What made her turn so nasty? 
Only god would know. 

She is standing on my eyelids
And her hair is in my hair
She has the color of my eye
She has the body of my hand
In my shade she is engulfed
As a stone against the sky

She will never close her eyes
And she does not let me sleep
And her dreams in the bright day
Make the suns evaporate
And me laugh cry and laugh
Speak when I have nothing to say


You must not call me Maggie, you must not call me Dear,
For I'm Lady of the Manor now stately to see;
And if there comes a babe, as there may some happy year,
'Twill be little lord or lady at my knee.

Oh, but what ails you, my sailor cousin Phil,
That you shake and turn white like a cockcrow ghost?
You're as white as I turned once down by the mill,
When one told me you and ship and crew were lost:

Philip my playfellow, when we were boy and girl
(It was the Miller's Nancy told it to me), 
Philip with the merry life in lip and curl,
Philip my playfellow drowned in the sea!

I thought I should have fainted, but I did not faint;
I stood stunned at the moment, scarcely sad,
Till I raised my wail of desolate complaint
For you, my cousin, brother, all I had.

They said I looked so pale—some say so fair—
My lord stopped in passing to soothe me back to life:
I know I missed a ringlet from my hair
Next morning; and now I am his wife. 

Look at my gown, Philip, and look at my ring,
I'm all crimson and gold from top to toe:
All day long I sit in the sun and sing,
Where in the sun red roses blush and blow.

And I'm the rose of roses says my lord;
And to him I'm more than the sun in the sky,
While I hold him fast with the golden cord
Of a curl, with the eyelash of an eye.

His mother said 'fie,' and his sisters cried 'shame,'
His highborn ladies cried 'shame' from their place: 
They said 'fie' when they only heard my name,
But fell silent when they saw my face.

Am I so fair, Philip? Philip, did you think
I was so fair when we played boy and girl,
Where blue forget-me-nots bloomed on the brink
Of our stream which the mill-wheel sent a whirl?

If I was fair then sure I'm fairer now,
Sitting where a score of servants stand,
With a coronet on high days for my brow
And almost a sceptre for my hand. 

You're but a sailor, Philip, weatherbeaten brown,
A stranger on land and at home on the sea,
Coasting as best you may from town to town:
Coasting along do you often think of me?

I'm a great lady in a sheltered bower,
With hands grown white through having nought to do:
Yet sometimes I think of you hour after hour
Till I nigh wish myself a child with you. 

Deep seas of nothingness marries the face of the moon.
The moon. is only a small world lifeless world.
A face of a rare and radiant maiden appears on the surface.
Her face and body are made of deep lunar seas.

Her name is Luna the goddess of the moon.
Her hair is the purest and finest silver strands.
Luna's elegant hair touches the ground.
Flowers adore her ever so lovely hair.

Luna is as pure as sparking spring water.
Still and always a virgin.
Her voice is musical like a light ringing bell.

Has a figure of a new born baby tree.
Small, willowy, delicate and easy to destroy.
The eyes of the goddess are imperial star Sapphire.
Luna's lips are a luxurious and sweet just like ripe raspberries.

A huge royal amulet of rare moonstone clasped around her neck.
The dress of the goddess is the like perfect snow.
Impeccable tresses of the dress touch the ground.

Luna mourns the death of someone she never knew.
This goddess is the only person of her kind.
She is in the deepest trench, because she has no love.
Too beautiful and perfect no mortal man could ever be her match. 

Suddenly she steps, wrapped into the wind,
brightly into brightness, as if singled out,
while now the room as though cut to fit
behind her fills the door

darkly like the ground of cameo,
that lets a glimmer through at the edges;
and you think the evening wasn't there
before she stepped out, and on the railing

set forth just a little of herself,
just her hands, --to be completely light:
as if passed on by the rows of houses
to the heavens, to be swayed by everything.




Your whole way with shining evil's coal
Margaret, they all do bravely judge.
What's your fault? The body sinned as such,
Innocent you have retained your soul.

To all people it's the same, I know,
To all nodded with a blurry smile.
And with this sorrowful semi-smile
You have wept yourself long time ago.

Who will know? Whose hand will help along?
No exception to the rule, one thing entrances!
They eternally await embraces,
They eternally await, 'I'm thirsty! Be my own!'

Day and night the bane of false confessions..
Day and night, tomorrow, and once more!
Spoke more eloquently than the word
Your dark glance, the martyr's dark expression.

The accursed ring is growing narrow,
On the goddess of the world avenges fate..
Smiling childishly, into your face
A young tender boy glances with sorrow.

The entire world is saved by love!
In but her salvation and defense is.
All's in love. O Margaret, sleep in peace.
All's in love. I'm saved because I love. 

My daughter took her very first 
as my lover took her last.
The sorrow of the blooms of spring
is they come and go so fast.

I took the only thing she wore
and I put it in its case.
A flower blooms and dies once more
in this tomb it has its place.

For soon enough a girl will bloom
and she'll open it with care.
To find my flower laid to rest
with her treasured gift still there. 

Maidenly lake, fathomless lake,
Stay as you were once, overgrown with rushes,
Idling with a reflected cloud, for my sake
Whom your shore no longer touches.

Your girl was always real to me.
Her bones lie in a city by the sea.
Everything occurs too normally.
A unique love simply wears away.

Girl, hey, girl, we repose in an abyss.
The base of a skull, a rib, a pelvis,
Is it you? me? We are more than this.
No clock counts hours and years for us.

How could a creature, ephemeral, eternal,
Measure for me necessity and fate?
You are locked with me in a letter-crystal.
No matter that you're not a living maid. 

Bluer than Helen's eyes she lies 
Under the blue cloud-drifting skies; 
A daughter fair of light and air 
Dropped among warrior mountains there. 

White glaciers kiss her feet so fleet— 
Oh fugitive, too rare and sweet! 
Will she not fling them off that cling, 
And rise, a bluebird on the wing?

Will she not rise and stray away,
A blue gleam on the brow of day?
Look—still she stays, and bright, snow-white,
The glaciers guard her day and night

Lako je onima koji znaju sta traze
Lako je onima koji misle da znaju
Tesko je samo nama koji nismo
Znali da smo bili srecni'Heardst that distant cry of danger?' questioned Sita in distress,
'Woe, to me! who in my frenzy sent my lord to wilderness,

Speed, brave Lakshman, help my Rama, doleful was his distant cry
And my fainting bosom falters and a dimness clouds my eye!

To the dread and darksome forest with thy keenest arrows speed,
Help thy elder and thy monarch, sore his danger and his need,

For perchance the cruel Rakshas gather round his lonesome path,
As the mighty bull is slaughtered by the lions in their wrath!'

Spake the hero: 'Fear not, Sita! Dwellers of the azure height,
Rakshas nor the jungle-rangers match the peerless Rama's might,

Rama knows no dread or danger, and his mandate still I own,
And I may not leave thee, Lady, in this cottage all alone!

Cast aside thy causeless terror; in the sky or earth below,
In the nether regions, Rama knows no peer or equal foe,

He shall slay the deer of jungle, he shall voice no dastard cry,
'Tis some trick of wily Rakshas in this forest dark and high!

Sita, thou hast heard my elder bid me in this cottage stay,
Lakshman may not leave thee, Lady, for this duty-to obey.

Ruthless Rakshas roam the forest to revenge their leader slain,
Various are their arts and accents; chase thy thought of causeless pain!'

Sparkled Sita's eye in anger, frenzy marked her speech and word,
For a woman's sense is clouded by the danger of her lord:

Markest thou my Rama's danger with a cold and callous heart,
Courtest thou the death of elder in thy deep deceitful art,

In thy semblance of compassion dost thou hide a cruel craft,
As in friendly guise the foeman hides his death-compelling shaft,

Following like a faithful younger in this dread and lonesome land,
Seekest thou the death of elder to enforce his widow's hand?

False thy hope as foul thy purpose! Sita is a faithful wife,
Sita follows saintly Rama, true in death as true in life!'

Quivered Lakshman's frame in anguish and the tear stood in his eye,
Fixed in faith and pure in purpose, calm and bold he made reply:

Answer to thy heedless censure patient Lakshman speaketh none,

Daughter of Videha's monarch,-pardon if I do thee wrong,
Fickle is the faith of woman, poison-dealing is her tongue!

And thy censure, trust me, Lady, scathes me like a burning dart,
Free from guile is Lakshman's purpose, free from sin is Lakshman's heart,

Witness ye my truth of purpose, unseen dwellers of the wood,
Witness, I for Sita's safety by my elder's mandate stood,

Dark suspicion and dishonour cast on me a needless stain!

Lady! I obey thy mandate, to my elder now I go,
Guardian Spirits of the forest watch thee from each secret foe,

Omens dark and signs of danger meet my pained and aching sight,
May I see thee by thy Rama, guarded by his conquering might!


'Dearest dream, my soul's enchantment 
    Lovely guest from heav'n above,
Most benevolent attender
    To the earthly realm below,
You gave me blissful satisfaction
    Momentary but complete:
Bringing with you happy tidings - 
    Like a herald from the skies.

I dreamed dreams of life eternal
    In that Promised Land of peace;
I dreamed dreams of fragrant regions,
    Of a tranquil, sweet Kashmir;
I could witness celebrations,
    Festivals of roses vernal
Honoring that lovely maiden
    From lands strange and far away.

And, with glistening enchantment
    Like an angel from above, - 
This untainted, youthful vision
    Came before my dreaming eyes;
Like a veil, a shining shroud
    Screened her lovely face from view,
Tenderly she did incline
    Her shy gazes toward the earth.

All her traits - her timid shyness
    Underneath her shining crown,
Childlike her animation, 
    And her face's noble beauty - 
Glowing with a depth of feeling,
    Sweet serenity and peace - 
All of these completely artless
    Indescribably sublime!

As I watched, the apparition
    (Captivating me in passing)
Never to return, flew by;
    I pursued - but it had gone!
T'was a vision merely fleeting,
    Transient illumination
Leaving nothing but a legend
    Of its passing through my life!

T'is not ours to harbor
    Beauty's spirit - Ah, so pure!
It comes nigh but for a moment
    From its heavenly abode;
Like a dream, it slips away, 
    Like an airy dream of morning:
But in sacred reminiscence
    It is married with the heart!

Only in the purest instants
    Of our life does it appear
Bringing with it revelations
    Beneficial to our hearts;
That our hearts may know of heaven
    In this earthly shadow realm,
It allows us momentary
    Glimpses through the earthly veil.

And through all that here is lovely,
    All that animates our lives,
To our souls it speaks a language
    Reassuring and distinct;
When it quits our earthly region
    It bestows a gift of love
Glowing in our evening heaven:
    'Tis a farewell star for all to see.


Лаллk  Рук

Мил ;ый сон, души плените ль,
Гост  прекрас ный с вышины,
 лагода ный посетит ель
Под ебесно  стороны ,
Я тобою наслади лся
На минуту, но вполне:
 обрым вестник ом явился
 десь небесно го ты мне.

Мнl л я быть в обетова нной
То  земле, где вечный мир;
Мни  я зреть благоух анный
Б змятеж ый Кашемир ;
Видел я: торжест вовали
 раздни  розы и весны
И пришели цу встреча ли
Из далекой стороны .

И блистая и пленяя -
Словно ангел неземно й -
Непоро ность молодая 
Появил сь предо мной;
Св тлый завес покрыва ла
Отен л ее черты,
И застенч иво склонял а
Взор умильны й с высот.

h се - и робкая стыдлив ость
По  сиянием венца,
И младенч еская живость ,
И величие лица,
И в чертах глубоко сть чувства 
С безмяте жной тишиной -
Все в ней было без искусст ва
Неоп санной красой!

Я смотрел - а призрак мимо
(Ув екая душу вслед)
П олетал невозвр атимо;
Я за ним - его уж нет!
Пос тил, как уповань е;
Жизнь минуту озарил;
  оставил лишь предань е,
Что когда-то в жизни был!

Ах! не с нами обитает 
Гений чистой красоты ;
Лишь порой он навещае т
Нас с небесно й высоты;
 н поспеше н, как мечтань е,
Как воздушн ый утра сон;
Но в святом воспоми нанье
Н разлуч н с сердцем он!

Он лишь в чистые мгновен ья
Быти  бывает к нам
И приноси т открове нья,
Бла отворн е сердцам ;
Чтоб о небе сердце знало
В темной области земной,
 ам туда сквозь покрыва ло
Он дает взгляну ть порой;

h  во всем, что здесь прекрас но,
Что наш мир животво рит,
Убе ительн  и ясно
Он с душою говорит ;
А когда нас покидае т,
В дар любви у нас в виду
В нашем небе зажигае т
Он прощаль ную звезду. 

Some people were not meant to write poetry.
This is a fact, 
not an opinion.

Poetry is not, 
using a thesaurus to fit in a large word.
Poetry is not, 
a useless rhyme scheme and structure.
Poetry does not have to rhyme.
Poetry is not, 
pretending your name is A Black Rose, 
An Orange Tiger, 
A Yellow Banana, 
An Obtuse Angle, 
or whatever the hell you call yourself.

Why do people persist on writing about
how clever they
THINK
they are, 
and about just how original they believe they are.
Also
why is it that some of these people
use profanity
just for the sake of profanity? 
It does not make sense, 
it is not creative, 

As for the birthday poems
that read like glorified horoscopes, 
and have just as much emotion put into them, 
this is a waste of space
that could have been used
for good poetry
rather than writing
that sounds identical
to what you read
in an almanac
or the newspaper.

Take a deep breath, 
think, 
feel, 
be inspired, 
write with your heart and mind. 

When I was a windy boy and a bit
And the black spit of the chapel fold,
(Sighed the old ram rod, dying of women),
I tiptoed shy in the gooseberry wood,
The rude owl cried like a tell-tale tit,
I skipped in a blush as the big girls rolled
Nine-pin down on donkey's common,
And on seesaw sunday nights I wooed
Whoever I would with my wicked eyes,
The whole of the moon I could love and leave
All the green leaved little weddings' wives
In the coal black bush and let them grieve.

When I was a gusty man and a half
And the black beast of the beetles' pews
(Sighed the old ram rod, dying of bitches),
Not a boy and a bit in the wick-
Dipping moon and drunk as a new dropped calf,
I whistled all night in the twisted flues,
Midwives grew in the midnight ditches,
And the sizzling sheets of the town cried, Quick!-
Whenever I dove in a breast high shoal,
Wherever I ramped in the clover quilts,
Whatsoever I did in the coal-
Black night, I left my quivering prints.

When I was a man you could call a man
And the black cross of the holy house,
(Sighed the old ram rod, dying of welcome),
Brandy and ripe in my bright, bass prime,
No springtailed tom in the red hot town
With every simmering woman his mouse
But a hillocky bull in the swelter
Of summer come in his great good time
To the sultry, biding herds, I said,
Oh, time enough when the blood runs cold,
And I lie down but to sleep in bed,
For my sulking, skulking, coal black soul!

When I was half the man I was
And serve me right as the preachers warn,
(Sighed the old ram rod, dying of downfall),
No flailing calf or cat in a flame
Or hickory bull in milky grass
But a black sheep with a crumpled horn,
At last the soul from its foul mousehole
Slunk pouting out when the limp time came;
And I gave my soul a blind, slashed eye,
Gristle and rind, and a roarers' life,
And I shoved it into the coal black sky
To find a woman's soul for a wife.

Now I am a man no more no more
And a black reward for a roaring life,
(Sighed the old ram rod, dying of strangers),
Tidy and cursed in my dove cooed room
I lie down thin and hear the good bells jaw--
For, oh, my soul found a sunday wife
In the coal black sky and she bore angels!
Harpies around me out of her womb!
Chastity prays for me, piety sings,
Innocence sweetens my last black breath,
Modesty hides my thighs in her wings,
And all the deadly virtues plague my death

Someone is dead.
Even the trees know it, 
those poor old dancers who come on lewdly, 
all pea-green scarfs and spine pole.
I think-
I think I could have stopped it, 
if I'd been as firm as a nurse 
or noticed the neck of the driver 
as he cheated the crosstown lights; 
or later in the evening, 
if I'd held my napkin over my mouth. 
I think I could- 
if I'd been different, or wise, or calm, 
I think I could have charmed the table, 
the stained dish or the hand of the dealer. 
But it's done.
It's all used up.
There's no doubt about the trees
spreading their thin feet into the dry grass.
A Canada goose rides up,
spread out like a gray suede shirt, 
honking his nose into the March wind. 
In the entryway a cat breathes calmly 
into her watery blue fur.
The supper dishes are over and the sun 
unaccustomed to anything else 
goes an the way down. 

Where are those dazzling hills touched by the sun,
Those crags in childhood that I used to climb?
Hidden, hidden under mist is yonder mountain,
Hidden is the heart. 

A day of cloud, a lifetime falls between,
Gone are the heather moors and the pure stream,
Gone are the rocky places and the green,
Hidden, hidden under sorrow is yonder mountain,
Hidden, hidden.

O storm and gale of tears, whose blinding screen
Makes weather of grief, snow's drifting curtain
Palls th'immortal heights once seen.
Hidden, hidden is the heart,
Hidden, hidden is the heart. 

Everything is far
and long gone by.
I think that the star
glittering above me
has been dead for a million years.
I think there were tears
in the car I heard pass
and something terrible was said.
A clock has stopped striking in the house
across the road. 
When did it start?. 
I would like to step out of my heart
an go walking beneath the enormous sky.
I would like to pray.
And surely of all the stars that perished
long ago,
one still exists.
I think that I know
which one it is--
which one, at the end of its beam in the sky,
stands like a white city.  

You should have cut me and
Enjoyed me for a few days
Instead of leaving me to
Wither that winter


Listen, children:
Your father is dead.
From his old coats
I'll make you little jackets;
I'll make you little trousers
From his old pants.
There'll be in his pockets
Things he used to put there,
Keys and pennies
Covered with tobacco;
Dan shall have the pennies
To save in his bank;
Anne shall have the keys
To make a pretty noise with.
Life must go on,
And the dead be forgotten;
Life must go on,
Though good men die;
Anne, eat your breakfast;
Dan, take your medicine;
Life must go on;
I forget just why. 

What is the point of lament 
Should I wake to cry for dead tears 
Should I starve for lost lonely years 
What is the point of repent


Ezekiel (New King James Version)      
Ezekiel a ship made of water cannot sail
an island full of holes

should sink
below the horizon where
children dressed in pink and

green suddenly stop playing

forever on this side of the equation

a tiny house
with yellow curtains has
sunk into the sun
bottlenecked

shadows arrive asking
'are you still alive'
and can't come back to

ask again
you rest on what's left
of the ground under stars
you cannot tell is it the ground

or is it you
still shaking
you're going farther but you can't say why
you walk for days as if

crossing continents a
nation walks for days through rubble through
the dead

still on earth
you break off a crust of sun
to eat
with dazed strangers

someone is singing
linking her soul to the sky
the only thing left not broken

she is
rocking back and forth
crooning to herself on
invisible piers of music while

the clouds bow down
an audience of silk that
flies away
take the ferry

but I don't know where
take the ferry
angels with missing wings advise
but

doctors are turned back
and weep into a sea of
people left alone a

ship made of water has
an orphaned sail
no sail at all

a man survived on
sugar cane and water a
girl survived on

flowers from the past
far away people threw gold
at the sun and turned away

unable to fathom
such delay
commissioners were commissioned: 

they deferred-
the flow chart flows forever but the
water doesn't

commissioners demured the people tried
to eat their words and failed
small island like a rose of fire afraid to
throw yourself on the ground
how will you mourn your dead
small ones

island like a rose a fire
you take it on yourself

you burn the dead when no one comes
held up in traffic I don't understand
how speeches all got through
small island like a burnt rose crying
say goodbye to everyone

in this protracted hell of the
initial stages of recovery or whatever
the prompter says, 
a ship made of water cannot sail
cannot sail cannot sail


At five in the afternoon.
It was exactly five in the afternoon.
A boy brought the white sheet
at five in the afternoon.
A frail of lime ready prepared
at five in the afternoon.
The rest was death, and death alone.

The wind carried away the cottonwool
at five in the afternoon.
And the oxide scattered crystal and nickel
at five in the afternoon.
Now the dove and the leopard wrestle
at five in the afternoon.
And a thigh with a desolated horn
at five in the afternoon.
The bass-string struck up
at five in the afternoon.
Arsenic bells and smoke
at five in the afternoon.
Groups of silence in the corners
at five in the afternoon.
And the bull alone with a high heart!
At five in the afternoon.
When the sweat of snow was coming
at five in the afternoon,
when the bull ring was covered with iodine
at five in the afternoon.
Death laid eggs in the wound
at five in the afternoon.
At five in the afternoon.
At five o'clock in the afternoon.

A coffin on wheels is his bed
at five in the afternoon.
Bones and flutes resound in his ears
at five in the afternoon.
Now the bull was bellowing through his forehead
at five in the afternoon.
The room was iridiscent with agony
at five in the afternoon.
In the distance the gangrene now comes
at five in the afternoon.
Horn of the lily through green groins
at five in the afternoon.
The wounds were burning like suns
at five in the afternoon.
At five in the afternoon.
Ah, that fatal five in the afternoon!
It was five by all the clocks!
It was five in the shade of the afternoon!

 The Spilled Blood

I will not see it!

Tell the moon to come,
for I do not want to see the blood
of Ignacio on the sand.

I will not see it!

The moon wide open.
Horse of still clouds,
and the grey bull ring of dreams
with willows in the barreras.

I will not see it!

Let my memory kindle!
Warm the jasmines
of such minute whiteness!

I will not see it!

The cow of the ancient world
passed har sad tongue
over a snout of blood
spilled on the sand,
and the bulls of Guisando,
partly death and partly stone,
bellowed like two centuries
sated with threading the earth.
No.
I will not see it!

Ignacio goes up the tiers
with all his death on his shoulders.
He sought for the dawn
but the dawn was no more.
He seeks for his confident profile
and the dream bewilders him
He sought for his beautiful body
and encountered his opened blood
Do not ask me to see it!
I do not want to hear it spurt
each time with less strength:
that spurt that illuminates
the tiers of seats, and spills
over the cordury and the leather
of a thirsty multiude.
Who shouts that I should come near!
Do not ask me to see it!

His eyes did not close
when he saw the horns near,
but the terrible mothers
lifted their heads.
And across the ranches,
an air of secret voices rose,
shouting to celestial bulls,
herdsmen of pale mist.
There was no prince in Sevilla
who could compare to him,
nor sword like his sword
nor heart so true.
Like a river of lions
was his marvellous strength,
and like a marble toroso
his firm drawn moderation.
The air of Andalusian Rome
gilded his head
where his smile was a spikenard
of wit and intelligence.
What a great torero in the ring!
What a good peasant in the sierra!
How gentle with the sheaves!
How hard with the spurs!
How tender with the dew!
How dazzling the fiesta!
How tremendous with the final
banderillas of darkness!

But now he sleeps without end.
Now the moss and the grass
open with sure fingers
the flower of his skull.
And now his blood comes out singing;
singing along marshes and meadows,
sliden on frozen horns,
faltering soulles in the mist
stoumbling over a thousand hoofs
like a long, dark, sad tongue,
to form a pool of agony
close to the starry Guadalquivir.
Oh, white wall of Spain!
Oh, black bull of sorrow!
Oh, hard blood of Ignacio!
Oh, nightingale of his veins!
No.
I will not see it!
No chalice can contain it,
no swallows can drink it,
no frost of light can cool it,
nor song nor deluge og white lilies,
no glass can cover mit with silver.
No.
I will not see it!

 The Laid Out Body

Stone is a forehead where dreames grieve
without curving waters and frozen cypresses.
Stone is a shoulder on which to bear Time
with trees formed of tears and ribbons and planets.

I have seen grey showers move towards the waves
raising their tender riddle arms,
to avoid being caught by lying stone
which loosens their limbs without soaking their blood.

For stone gathers seed and clouds,
skeleton larks and wolves of penumbra:
but yields not sounds nor crystals nor fire,
only bull rings and bull rings and more bull rings without walls.

Now, Ignacio the well born lies on the stone.
All is finished. What is happening! Contemplate his face:
death has covered him with pale sulphur
and has place on him the head of dark minotaur.

All is finished. The rain penetrates his mouth.
The air, as if mad, leaves his sunken chest,
and Love, soaked through with tears of snow,
warms itself on the peak of the herd.

What is they saying? A stenching silence settles down.
We are here with a body laid out which fades away,
with a pure shape which had nightingales
and we see it being filled with depthless holes.

Who creases the shroud? What he says is not true!
Nobody sings here, nobody weeps in the corner,
nobody pricks the spurs, nor terrifies the serpent.
Here I want nothing else but the round eyes
to see his body without a chance of rest.

Here I want to see those men of hard voice.
Those that break horses and dominate rivers;
those men of sonorous skeleton who sing
with a mouth full of sun and flint.

Here I want to see them. Before the stone.
Before this body with broken reins.
I want to know from them the way out
for this captain stripped down by death.

I want them to show me a lament like a river
wich will have sweet mists and deep shores,
to take the body of Ignacio where it looses itself
without hearing the double planting of the bulls.

Loses itself in the round bull ring of the moon
which feigns in its youth a sad quiet bull,
loses itself in the night without song of fishes
and in the white thicket of frozen smoke.

I don't want to cover his face with handkerchiefs
that he may get used to the death he carries.
Go, Ignacio, feel not the hot bellowing
Sleep, fly, rest: even the sea dies!

 Absent Soul

The bull does not know you, nor the fig tree,
nor the horses, nor the ants in your own house.
The child and the afternoon do not know you
because you have dead forever.

The shoulder of the stone does not know you
nor the black silk, where you are shuttered.
Your silent memory does not know you
because you have died forever

The autumn will come with small white snails,
misty grapes and clustered hills,
but no one will look into your eyes
because you have died forever.

Because you have died for ever,
like all the dead of the earth,
like all the dead who are forgotten
in a heap of lifeless dogs.

Nobady knows you. No. But I sing of you.
For posterity I sing of your profile and grace.
Of the signal maturity of your understanding.
Of your appetite for death and the taste of its mouth.
Of the sadness of your once valiant gaiety.

It will be a long time, if ever, before there is born
an Andalusian so true, so rich in adventure.
I sing of his elegance with words that groan,
and I remember a sad breeze through the olive trees. 

I heard the Poor Old Woman say:
"At break of day the fowler came,
And took my blackbirds from their songs
Who loved me well thro' shame and blame

No more from lovely distances
Their songs shall bless me mile by mile,
Nor to white Ashbourne call me down
To wear my crown another while.

With bended flowers the angels mark
For the skylark the place they lie,
From there its little family
Shall dip their wings first in the sky.

And when the first suprise of flight
Sweet songs excite, from the far dawn
Shall there come blackbirds loud with love, 
Sweet echoesmof the singers gone.

But in the lovely hush of eve
Weeping I grieve the silent bills"
I heard the Poor Old Woman say
In Derry of the little hills. 

Now do our eyes behold 
The tidings which were told: 
Twin fallen kings, twin perished hopes to mourn, 
The slayer, the slain, 
The entangled doom forlorn 
And ruinous end of twain. 
Say, is not sorrow, is not sorrow's sum 
On home and hearthstone come? 
Oh, waft with sighs the sail from shore, 
Oh, smite the bosom, cadencing the oar 
That rows beyond the rueful stream for aye 
To the far strand, 
The ship of souls, the dark, 
The unreturning bark 
Whereon light never falls nor foot of Day, 
Even to the bourne of all, to the unbeholden land. 

Black is the beauty of the brightest day,
The golden belle of heaven's eternal fire,
That danced with glory on the silver waves,
Now wants the fuel that inflamed his beams:
And all with faintness and for foul disgrace,
He binds his temples with a frowning cloud,
Ready to darken earth with endless night:
Zenocrate that gave him light and life,
Whose eyes shot fire from their ivory bowers,
And tempered every soul with lively heat,
Now by the malice of the angry skies,
Whose jealousy admits no second mate,
Draws in the comfort of her latest breath
All dazzled with the hellish mists of death.
Now walk the angels on the walls of heaven,
As sentinels to warn th'immortal souls,
To entertain divine Zenocrate.
Apollo, Cynthia, and the ceaseless lamps
That gently looked upon this loathsome earth,
Shine downwards now no more, but deck the heavens
To entertain divine Zenocrate.
The crystal springs whose taste illuminates
Refined eyes with an eternal sight,
Like tried silver runs through Paradise
To entertain divine Zenocrate.
The Cherubins and holy Seraphins
That sing and play before the King of Kings,
Use all their voices and their instruments
To entertain divine Zenocrate.
And in this sweet and curious harmony,
Holds out his hand in highest majesty
To entertain divine Zenocrate.
Then let some holy trance convey my thoughts,
Up to the palace of th'imperial heaven:
That this my life may be as short to me
As are the days of sweet Zenocrate. 

I could have moved him 

If he could hear how loud 

my heart was beating 

I could have touched him
 
But he could not feel much 

beyond his pale skin 


I could have loved him 

But he was blind and could not read 

my broken lines 

I went through the motions

Drowning in an ocean

A dead sea. 

He kept on looking past me




for guiding me through  the deep end. . 

O how all things are far removed
and long have passed away.
I do believe the star,
whose light my face reflects,
is dead and has been so
for many thousand years.

I had a vision of a passing boat
and heard some voices saying disquieting things.
I heard a clock strike in some distant house. 
but in which house?. 

I long to quiet my anxious heart
and stand beneath the sky's immensity.
I long to pray. 
And one of all the stars
must still exist.
I do believe that I would know
which one alone
endured,
and which like a white city stands
at the ray's end shining in the heavens.




Lovers of whores don’t care,
happy, calm and replete:
But my arms are incomplete,
grasping the empty air.
Thanks to stars, incomparable ones,
that blaze in the depths of the skies,
all my destroyed eyes
see, are the memories of suns.
I look, in vain, for beginning and end
of the heavens’ slow revolve:
Under an unknown eye of fire, I ascend
feeling my wings dissolve.
And, scorched by desire for the beautiful,
I will not know the bliss,
of giving my name to that abyss,
that knows my tomb and funeral. 

my fair copy of the rings around the moon
got into the wrong hands-
stashed in the pirate's hoard

next door to rubies and a retrograde coinage
and the key to that lock was thrown
by a vagrant hand for no reason at all

into silver-pointed dawn.

now in a lime-leafed summer, once again, 
brocaded planets spin so unredeemed
but not for that much longer-

That silent greeting from above;
A gentle flash of light that came
From her whom drooping captives love;
Or art thou of still higher birth?
Thou that didst part the clouds of earth,
My torpor to reprove!

Bright boon of pitying Heaven!---alas,
I may not trust thy placid cheer!
Pondering that Time tonight will pass
The threshold of another year;
For years to me are sad and dull;
My very moments are too full
Of hopelessness and fear.

And yet, the soul-awakening gleam,
That struck perchance the farthest cone
Of Scotland's rocky wilds, did seem
To visit me, and me alone;
Me, unapproached by any friend,
Save those who to my sorrow lend
Tears due unto their own.

To night the church-tower bells will ring
Through these wide realms a festire peal;
To the new year a welcoming;
A tuneful offering for the weal
Of happy millions lulled in deep;
While I am forced to watch and weep,
By wounds that may not heal.

Born all too high, by wedlock raised
Still higherÑto be cast thus low!
Would that mine eyes had never gazed
On aught of more ambitious show
Than the sweet flowerets of the fields
---It is my royal state that yields
This bitterness of woe.

Yet how?---for I, if there be truth
In the world's voice, was passing fair;
And beauty, for confiding youth,
Those shocks of passion can prepare
That kill the bloom before its time;
And blanch, without the owner's crime,
The most resplendent hair.

Unblest distinction! showered on me
To bind a lingering life in chains:
All that could quit my grasp, or flee,
Is gone;---but not the subtle stains
Fixed in the spirit; for even here
Can I be proud that jealous fear
Of what I was remains.

A Woman rules my prison's key;
O£ law and holiest sympathy,
Detains me, doubtful of the event;
My thoughts are all that I possess,
O keep them innocent!

Farewell desire of human aid,
Which abject mortals vainly court!
By friends deceived, by foes betrayed,
Of fears the prey, of hopes the sport;
Nought but the world-redeeming Cross
Is able to support my loss,
My burthen to support.

Hark! the death-note of the year
Sounded by the castle-clock!
From her sunk eyes a stagnant tear
Stole forth, unsettled by the shock;
But oft the woods renewed their green,
Reposed upon the block

I laid me down one day in June;
It was late-long after noon-
A very sultry summer's eve, 
Such times the senses oft deceive. 
The place was 'neath a maple tree,
Soon from all cares and troubles free,
By a gentle, kindly slumber,
No more our sorrows we could number.
But we heard a plaintive wail,
Such as we find in fairy tale ;
It was the genius of the tree,
Who, in sad guise, appeared to me.
And then she sadly did give vent
Unto this awful, grave lament,
'Though I am gay in month of June,
All decked in green ; yet very soon,
Alas ! my beauty will be faded,
And my charms be all degraded,
For is my time of glory brief ;
So often flattered is my leaf.
In Canada, so broad and free,
All poets sing of the maple tree.
High I stand, in their opinion,
Emblem of the New Dominion.
The reason I do them upbraid,
Some never slept beneath my shade ;
And yet they take the liberty
To chant about the maple tree. 
They dare to poetize my leaf -
is the source of all my grief.
I think their praises all so rude, 
And as but base in gratitude ;
So often hackneyed is my name,
That every fall I burn with shame-
Like maiden's cheek which blushes red

When vain rash youth asks her to wed.
Then do these foolish ones descry 
In me fresh beauty, and they sigh,
And then renew their songs of praise-
But unto me now sad their lays ;
For then I know my days are brief,
'Tis hectic flush upon my leaf.
True poets, then, should mournful sing,
When the destroyer's on the wing ;
For then I know my leaves of gold
Will all soon mingle with the mould.
No one does ever think to praise
The fell destroyer when he slays ;
No one rejoice in the flushed cheek,
When the poor girl is low and weak.
Perhaps they'll say, and it is true,
In Spring my glory I'll renew ;
But' tis poor comfort after all
To lose my offspring every Fall.
Small consolation to mother
To tell her that soon another
Will replace her fond darling boy,
Who has been source of all her joy.
But you know all about my wood,
You know that it is strong and good ;
And I have full many a curl,
And pleasing eye and charming nurl.
Some love me as fond nature grain'd
And some prefer my beauties stain'd ;
But my dear friend I hope that you
My varied shades like pure and true,
For of the woods you know the staple,
Stoutest and best, is good maple.
The youth my sugar eat with glee 
And old maids love me in their tea.
In me do various uses meet-
In summer shade, in winter heat,
For I do make a glorious blaze,
All worthy of the poet's lays ;
But to their praises I'll be deaf
If more they harp about my leaf-

They call me gay when I am sober, 
To me 'tis gloomy month, October. 
But saints on earth, when they die 
Hope for true bliss beyond the sky, 
So winter does bring no alarms 
Though it strip bare my trunk and arms, 
For now I know that time will bring
More glorious foliage in the spring. 
Then, all nature will rejoice, 
Triumphing with glorious voice,
And birds will, in my branches, sing
Hosannas to the lovely spring.

[The nurls and bird's eyes and curls were highly prized
in furniture thirty years ago, when we used the smooth plain. 

Verse  

I'm glad I got to see you
If only a little while
I heard the sound of your voice
and felt the warmth of your smile

Wish I could tell you things I want to say
I wish you'd understand
Why I left wasn't because of you
You're too good of a man

Chorus: 
'If we could go back to the way things were
I promise we'd be fine.
and all the mistakes, I'd never make
and I'd get to call you mine.

I can't go back and undo the past
I can't change what I've done
But the one thing that's remained the same
Is you're still my only one'
Verse  

I was sad and lonely
very much confused
On the outside I was happy
But scared of losing you

I let my fear make me angry
I thought she'd make you stray
When I realized how misguided I was 
I left though I wanted to stay

Chorus: 
'The last thing I ever wanted 
  was to hurt you
  I wanted to hold you close
  and tell you the truth
 
  After all the nights spent crying
  Couldn't figure out what to do
  I'd give you the world if I could
  Tiger, I still love you.'

Verse  

All this time I felt I was right for leaving
I know now,  I was wrong
I should’ve opened up to you more
Perhaps I knew that along

I tried my best at the time
I gave all I could 
I tried to do what was best for us
If only I hadn’t misunderstood.
 
Chorus: 
There entails my main mistake
I made a decision for two
I should’ve talked to you more
Not shut myself off from you

I’m glad for the chance you gave
I’m glad our friendship survived
But the thing I wish you’d realize most is
You remain perfect in my eyes"just now the bars are coming down again
blue morpheus winds are rising
in my soul extraordinary

courier and friend-
in my soul there are no bells; 
there is only You.

it's only waking up
that I can't bear; 
the white rose in a dream with no confrere

remained so incandescent
in the end

and caught in a warren
I don't understand-
Jesu, my flag is not down.

bright dreaming son or brother
or someone else
under the drizzling skies I feel

that I'm dissolving far from you
and running late to say: 
it's only that I recognize

that star you held in your hands-
the one that made you suffer-
the one that, even now
compels me to weep sapphires
endlessly
on your behalf-

and to lean into Space. 

and to my mother

'the hidden emerald of a far off day. '
she began to say but
coming or going? queried her angels
as if dressed by Kate Greenaway.

'I don't know; it's the sheen of the day
that matters, not that it slipped away.
may it ever be raspberry, '
she smiled.

it slipped away.
and the halo of her stories shone
after the angel departed, 

oh remain my heart's mirage she murmured.
from heaven

and the geranium border
in the garden faded.
oh where have the clouds gone

that shimmered in the air
where poetry was spoken
on the earlier, the echoing green? 

your path struggles on through incomprehensible
mankind. All the more futile perhaps
for keeping to its direction,
keeping on toward the future,
toward what has been lost.

Once. You lamented? What was it? A fallen berry
of jubilation, unripe.
But now the whole tree of my jubilation
is breaking, in the storm it is breaking, my slow
tree of joy.
Loveliest in my invisible
landscape, you that made me more known
to the invisible angels.




He blessed me to be formed wholesome in womb; 
He had great ideas for me to do; 
I was so eager therefore, to be born.

Just when I was all set to be born live, 
I knocked the womb’s door. My mom did not heed; 
I knocked for long and pleaded to be born; 
How I wished to make my parents happy! 

I longed to see my daddy and my mom; 
I yearned to be fondled and kissed by them; 
I loved to show the baby doll, I was; 
My dreams were shattered: I was aborted! 

Oh, mother dear, what folly had I done? 
Was I not life like daddy and my mom? 
I had been murdered for no crime of mine.

How foolish men and women try to be; 
They do not hesitate to kill their own; 
How mean to kill the baby that’s unborn! 

For, if you don’t, she’s bound to land in hell; 
Forgive them both; I wish they will REPENT.

Forgive them for their heinous crime and sin; 
Control your wrath and forgive mom and dad.

This is my final wish for now, I’m dead; 
Please spare my parents from your stern just rod; 

that was full of people! 
How is she become as a widow! 
She that was great among the nations, 
and princess among the provinces, 
how is she become tributary! 

She weepeth sore in the night,
and her tears are on her cheeks: 
among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: 
all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, 
they are become her enemies. 

Judah is gone into captivity
because of affliction, and because of great servitude: 
she dwelleth among the heathen, 
she findeth no rest: 
all her persecutors overtook her between the straits. 

The ways of Zion do mourn,
because none come to the solemn feasts: 
all her gates are desolate: 
her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, 
and she is in bitterness. 

Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper;
for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: 
her children are gone into captivity before the enemy. 

And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed:
her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, 
and they are gone without strength before the pursuer. 

Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries
all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, 
when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: 
the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths. 

Jerusalem hath grievously sinned;
therefore she is removed: 
all that honored her despise her, 
because they have seen her nakedness: 
yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward. 

Her filthiness is in her skirts;
she remembereth not her last end; 
therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. 
O LORD, behold my affliction: 
for the enemy hath magnified himself. 

The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things:
for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, 
whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation. 

All her people sigh, they seek bread;
they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: 
see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile. 

Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?
Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, 
which is done unto me, 
wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger. 

From above hath he sent fire into my bones,
and it prevaileth against them: 
he hath spread a net for my feet, 
he hath turned me back: 
he hath made me desolate and faint all the day. 

The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand:
they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: 
he hath made my strength to fall, 
from whom I am not able to rise up. 

he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: 

For these things I weep;
mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, 
because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: 
my children are desolate, 
because the enemy prevailed. 

Zion spreadeth forth her hands,
and there is none to comfort her: 
the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, 
that his adversaries should be round about him: 
Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them. 

The LORD is righteous;
for I have rebelled against his commandment: 
hear, I pray you, all people, 
and behold my sorrow: 
my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity. 

I called for my lovers, but they deceived me:
my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, 
while they sought their meat to relieve their souls. 

Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress:
my bowels are troubled; 
mine heart is turned within me; 
for I have grievously rebelled: 
abroad the sword bereaveth, 
at home there is as death. 

They have heard that I sigh;
there is none to comfort me: 
all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; 
they are glad that thou hast done it: 
thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, 
and they shall be like unto me. 

Let all their wickedness come before thee;
and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: 
and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, 
and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger! 

and hath not pitied: 
he hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; 
he hath brought them down to the ground: 
he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof. 

He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel:
he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, 
and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about. 

He hath bent his bow like an enemy:
he stood with his right hand as an adversary, 
and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: 
he poured out his fury like fire. 

he hath swallowed up Israel, 
he hath swallowed up all her palaces: 
he hath destroyed his strongholds, 
and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation. 

And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden;
he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: 
the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, 
and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest. 

he hath abhorred his sanctuary, 
he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; 
they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, 
as in the day of a solemn feast. 

The LORD hath purposed to destroy
the wall of the daughter of Zion: 
he hath stretched out a line, 
he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: 
therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; 
they languished together. 

Her gates are sunk into the ground;
he hath destroyed and broken her bars: 
her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: 
the law is no more; 
her prophets also find no vision from the LORD. 

The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep silence:
they have cast up dust upon their heads; 
they have girded themselves with sackcloth: 
the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground. 

Mine eyes do fail with tears,
my bowels are troubled, 
my liver is poured upon the earth, 
for the destruction of the daughter of my people; 
because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city. 

They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine?
when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, 
when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom. 

What thing shall I take to witness for thee?
What thing shall I liken to thee, 
O daughter of Jerusalem? 
What shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, 
O virgin daughter of Zion? 
For thy breach is great like the sea: 
who can heal thee? 

Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee:
and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; 
but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment. 

All that pass by clap their hands at thee;
they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, 
Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth? 

All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee:
they hiss and gnash the teeth: 
they say, We have swallowed her up: 
certainly this is the day that we looked for; 
we have found, we have seen it. 

The LORD hath done that which he had devised;
he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: 
he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: 
and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee, 
he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries. 

O wall of the daughter of Zion, 
let tears run down like a river day and night: 
give thyself no rest; 
let not the apple of thine eye cease. 

Arise, cry out in the night:
lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, 
that faint for hunger in the top of every street. 

Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this.
Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? 

The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets:
my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; 
thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; 
thou hast killed, and not pitied. 

Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about,
so that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained: 
those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.

He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.

Surely against me is he turned;
he turneth his hand against me all the day. 

My flesh and my skin hath he made old;
he hath broken my bones. 

He hath builded against me,
and compassed me with gall and travail. 

He hath set me in dark places,
as they that be dead of old. 

He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out:
he hath made my chain heavy. 

Also when I cry and shout,
he shutteth out my prayer. 

He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone;
he hath made my paths crooked. 

He was unto me as a bear lying in wait,
and as a lion in secret places. 

He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces:
he hath made me desolate. 

He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.

He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.

I was a derision to all my people;
and their song all the day. 

He hath filled me with bitterness,
he hath made me drunken with wormwood. 

He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones,
he hath covered me with ashes. 

And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace:
I forgat prosperity. 

And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:

remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.

My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.

This I recall to my mind,
therefore have I hope. 

It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed,
because his compassions fail not. 

They are new every morning:
great is thy faithfulness. 

The LORD is my portion, saith my soul;
therefore will I hope in him. 

The LORD is good unto them that wait for him,
to the soul that seeketh him. 

It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.

It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.

He sitteth alone and keepeth silence,
because he hath borne it upon him. 

He putteth his mouth in the dust;
if so be there may be hope. 

He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him:
he is filled full with reproach. 


but though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion
according to the multitude of his mercies. 

For he doth not afflict willingly,
nor grieve the children of men. 

To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,

to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,

to subvert a man in his cause,

Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass,

Out of the mouth of the Most High proceedeth not evil and good?

Wherefore doth a living man complain,
a man for the punishment of his sins? 

Let us search and try our ways,
and turn again to the LORD. 


We have transgressed and have rebelled:
thou hast not pardoned. 

Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us:
thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. 

Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud,
that our prayer should not pass through. 

Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.

All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.

Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.

Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water
for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,

till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.

Mine eye affecteth mine heart,
because of all the daughters of my city. 

Mine enemies chased me sore,
like a bird, without cause. 

They have cut off my life in the dungeon,
and cast a stone upon me. 

Waters flowed over mine head;
then I said, I am cut off. 

I called upon thy name, O LORD,
out of the low dungeon. 

Thou hast heard my voice:
hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. 

Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee:
thou saidst, Fear not. 

thou hast redeemed my life. 

O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong:
judge thou my cause. 

Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.

Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD,
and all their imaginations against me; 

the lips of those that rose up against me,
and their device against me all the day. 

Behold their sitting down, and their rising up;
I am their music. 

Render unto them a recompense, O LORD,
according to the work of their hands. 

Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.

Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us:
consider, and behold our reproach. 

Our inheritance is turned to strangers,
our houses to aliens. 

We are orphans and fatherless,
our mothers are as widows. 

We have drunken our water for money;
our wood is sold unto us. 

Our necks are under persecution:
we labor, and have no rest. 

We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians,
to be satisfied with bread. 

Our fathers have sinned, and are not;
and we have borne their iniquities. 

Servants have ruled over us:
there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand. 

We gat our bread with the peril of our lives,
because of the sword of the wilderness. 

Our skin was black like an oven,
because of the terrible famine. 

They ravished the women in Zion,
and the maids in the cities of Judah. 

Princes are hanged up by their hand:
the faces of elders were not honored. 

They took the young men to grind,
and the children fell under the wood. 

The elders have ceased from the gate,
the young men from their music. 

The joy of our heart is ceased;
our dance is turned into mourning. 

The crown is fallen from our head:
woe unto us, that we have sinned! 

For this our heart is faint;
for these things our eyes are dim. 

Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate,
the foxes walk upon it. 

Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever;
thy throne from generation to generation. 

Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever,
and forsake us so long time? 

Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned;
renew our days as of old. 

But thou hast utterly rejected us;
thou art very wroth against us. 

I  saw  you  prancing  in  the  dark.
You  seemed  to  have  such  joy.
My  father  brought  you  home  that  day, 
And  said  you  weren't  a  toy.

So  very  soon,  I  learned  to  ride; 
That  I  might  be  with  you.
And  you  became  a  cherished  friend, 
The  first  I  ever  knew.

We  were  alone  most  of  the  time.
We  lived  so  far  out  here.
My  life  was   oh  so  simple  then.
We  roamed  so  far, but  near.

I  kept  you  well  as  best  I  could, 
With  lots  of  oats  and  hay.
You  stood  beside  this  old  grey  rock, 
To  help  me  mount  each  day.

You  were  so  big, and  I  was  small; 
But  to  me  you  were  so  kind.
They  always  said  you  weren't  too  smart, 
But  I  really  didn't  mind.

You  seemed  to  like  me  on  your  back.
I  rode  each  time  I  could.
I  so  enjoyed  your  company
As  any  young  boy  would.

And  so  it  was,  until  the  day
When  I  just  had to  leave.
I  said  good-bye  and  then  I  went.
There  was  no  time  to  grieve.

My  father  wrote  and  spoke  of  you.
He  said  you  did  quite  well.
You  often  waited   at  the  rock
Until  the  evening  fell.

The  other  day, he  said  you  changed
And  didn't  anymore.
I  wondered  then,  should  I  return  
To  ride  you  as  before? 

So  yesterday,  I  made  the  time
To  visit  my  best  friend.
Now  here  I  am  in  your  corral.
So  lonely   in  the  end.

You  stayed  with  me  just  long  enough, 
For  me  to  hear  you  one  last  time
Repeat  your  sound  of  love.

I  wonder  now  about  my  life.
The  love  we  shared   and  knew.
And  wish  I'd  never  spent  a  day
Of  it,  not  here  with  you.

For  what  is  life,  but  moments  spent
In  doing  what  we  choose. 
Seeking  things  we  think  we  want.
Forgetting,  those  we  lose.

I  think  I've  learned  my  lesson  now.
In  life,  you  just  can't  win.
Unless  you  cherish  what  you  have
Of  friendship, now  and  then.

So  I'll  stand  on  the  old  grey  rock
Until  my  dying  day.
When  you'll  return,  and  once  again.
I'll  mount,  and  ride  away. 

Triple Gorge one thread of heaven over
ten thousand cascading thongs of water,
slivers of sun and moon sheering away
above, and wild swells walled-in below,

splintered spirits glisten, a few glints
frozen how many hundred years in dark

gorges midday light never finds, gorges
hungry froth fills with peril. Rotting

coffins locked into tree roots, isolate
bones twist and sway, dangling free,

and grieving frost roosts in branches,
keeping lament's dark, distant harmony

fresh. Exile, tattered heart all scattered
away, you'll simmer in seething flame

here, your life like fine-spun thread,
its road a trace of string traveled away.

Offer tears to mourn the water-ghosts,
and water-ghosts take them, glimmering.

Water swords and spears raging in gorges,
boats drift across heaving thunder. Here

in the hands of these serpents and snakes,
you face everyday frenzies of wind and rain,

and how many fleeing exiles travel these
gorges, gorges rank inhabitants people?

You won't find a heart beneath this sheen,
this flood that's stored away aftermath

forever. Arid froth raising boundless mist,
froth all ablaze and snarling, snarling

what of that thirst for wisdom when you're
suddenly here, dead center in these waters.

By lamps, you light although daylight, 
You light the world of darkened lives
Of ailing patients and dying, 
Giving them hope of life quite bright! 

The lamps you hold by hand today
Affirm your wish to toil always, 
Relieving pain and sufferings
Of sick, diseased brethren all day! 

Like ‘Lady with the lamp’ you show
Your heart has love and compassion
For mankind sick and afflicted; 

The lamps will show the world around
That nurses are a noble lot
Who sacrifice their lives and time
To make everybody’s health sound! 

May nurses fill the world with cheer! 
Like Nightingale, serve sick always; 
Your work is more than gold, aye, dear! 
Be bold but kind to human race! 

Of IRT SON students and staff


Lamps burn in every house, 
O blind one! and you cannot see them.
One day your eyes shall suddenly be opened, 
and you shall see: and the fetters of death will fall from you.
There is nothing to say or to hear, 
there is nothing to do: 
it is he who is living, yet dead, who shall never die again.

Because he lives in solitude, 
therefore the Yogi says that his home is far away.


The Brahman priest goes from house to house 
and initiates people into faith:
Alas! the true fountain of life is beside you, 
and you have set up a stone to worship.

Yoga and the telling of beads, 
virtue and vice-these are naught to Him.

'Sloping cobbled lazy path
Leading up to pent up wrath

Winding roads to distant hills
Snake a take through the tills

Full of mysterious passion, Raj
In this mystery lived the dodge

Illusions knit to blunt the eye
Awareness broken for the lie

Pathways into crypts are found
Treason mocks the freedom bound

In mortar, loot and plunder hid.
Chop the hands; untie the lid.

Teeming millions walked to the moon
While in their land danced the dune

Imperial ardor flung on raids
Wrapped in silky masquerades

Sailors great and ravenous bold
Danced to shimmer of dazzling gold

(May Land of the Free home of the brave
Land of disease home of the slave
Freedom of religion Freedom of speech
Freedom of press and freedom to breach
Freedom to steal freedom to take
Freedom to carry guns and Freedom to break 
The laws of the man and the laws of the word
Freedom from peace but to still use the bird
The only home of brave and Land of the Free
The land who rules based off democracy
Freedom to starve and Freedom to be poor
Freedom to break and enter someone’s door
Freedom to lay off workers and close off jobs
Freedom to take what they want and to rob
Freedom of abortion Freedom of extortion 
Freedom to own land and give everyone their portion
Freedom for action by any means necessary 
But what their picture of that can really be scary
Freedom to wage war without our consent for our hours to be spent 
Freedom to take our money then make us pay rent
Land of the prospering riches and of those who don’t care for the
People who live in the FREE old America

                                


The train pulled out of the central station
It was my first trip by train I was feeling interpretation
My first initial reaction was-OMG who are all these people
Never been outside of Auckland so it was a shock to my system
However, the train ride down was worth it in the end
Because New Zealand is indeed such a beautiful land
Miles upon miles of rolling hills with little white dots
Pine trees farmed just to keep our paper piles stocked
The gullies and creeks that run through this land
As we chugged along with incredible pace 
The beauty of the land took me in
To a wonderful blissful state
The pictures still here 
Within my minds eyes
I am actually grateful I live 
In the land of the long white cloud


Gliding clouds shed heavenly drops of purity
Colossal insatiable earth absorbed it in vanity
Rocky core rebuffed, seem nutty; pretty much pity

Cracked and clef soil of tolerated native mother
Beaten halo, attacked by the sun
Being friend and enemy to the end
Monsoon rain drops cried tears

Beyond of measure of sufferings keep in heart
Obeying to nature of god the body always brooks
Courageous mind and crooked back life domesticates
Keeping the dream of the beauty and smell of rose

Barren   soil turning into fertile 
Making dug well wetted over the land
Reaping seeds beget color of green
Mother of native attests through the centuries in time 

By the history, for the people
Hostage curse is inherited 
By the heart, for own future
To struggle of unjust is unavoidable 

Righteous reality locking by suppression 
Release of violence guides the admission
Ceaseless hope of legacy with permission
Though dark, for light dawn of full moon


When in the mask of night there shone that cut,
we were riddled. A probe reached down
and stroked some nerve in us,
as if the glint from a wizard's eye, of silver,
slanted out of the mask of the unknown-
pit of riddles, the scratch-marked sky.

When, albino bowl on cloth of jet,
it spilled its virile rays,
our eyes enlarged, our blood reared with the waves.
We craved its secret, but unreachable
it held away from us, chilly and frail.
Distance kept it magnate. Enigma made it white.

When we learned to read it with our rod,
reflected light revealed
a lead mirror, a bruised shield
seamed with scars and shadow-soiled.
A half faced sycophant, its glitter borrowed,
rode around our throne.

On the moon there shines earth light
as moonlight shines upon th earth-
If on its obsidian we set our weightless foot,
and sniff no wind, and lick no rain
and feel no gauze between us and the Fire
will we trot its grassless skull, sick for the homelike shade?

Naked to the earth-beam we shall be,
who have arrived to map an apparition,
who walk upon the forehead of a myth.
Can flesh rub with symbol? If our ball
be iron, and not light, our earliest wish
eclipses. Dare we land upon a dream

In order to write my chaste verses I’ll lie
like an astrologer near to the sky
and, by the bell-towers, listen in dream
to their solemn hymns on the air-stream.
Hands on chin, from my attic’s height
I’ll see the workshops of song and light,
the gutters, the belfries those masts of the city,
the vast skies that yield dreams of eternity
It is sweet to see stars being born in the blue,
through the mists, the lamps at the windows, too,
the rivers of smoke climbing the firmament,
and the moon pouring out her pale enchantment.
I’ll see the springs, summers, autumns’ glow,
and when winter brings the monotonous snow
I’ll close all my doors and shutters tight
and build palaces of faery in the night.
Then I’ll dream of blue-wet horizons,
weeping fountains of alabaster, gardens,
kisses, birdsong at morning or twilight,
all in the Idyll that is most childlike.
The mob that are beating in vain on the glass,
won’t make me raise my head as they pass.
Since I’ll be plunged deep in the thrill
of evoking the springtime through my own will,
raising the sun out of my own heart,
making sweet air from my burning thought. 

The fat lady came out first,
tearing out roots and moistening drumskins.
The fat lady
who turns dying octopuses inside out.
The fat lady, the moon's antagonist,
was running through the streets and deserted buildings
and leaving tiny skulls of pigeons in the corners
and stirring up the furies of the last centuries' feasts
and summoning the demon of bread through the sky's clean-swept hills
and filtering a longing for light into subterranean tunnels.
The graveyards, yes the graveyards
and the sorrow of the kitchens buried in sand,
the dead, pheasants and apples of another era,
pushing it into our throat.

There were murmuring from the jungle of vomit
with the empty women, with hot wax children,
with fermented trees and tireless waiters
who serve platters of salt beneath harps of saliva.
There's no other way, my son, vomit! There's no other way.
It's not the vomit of hussars on the breasts of their whores,
nor the vomit of cats that inadvertently swallowed frogs,
but the dead who scratch with clay hands
on flint gates where clouds and desserts decay.

The fat lady came first
with the crowds from the ships, taverns, and parks.
Vomit was delicately shaking its drums
among a few little girls of blood
who were begging the moon for protection.
Who could imagine my sadness?
The look on my face was mine, but now isn't me,
the naked look on my face, trembling for alcohol
and launching incredible ships
through the anemones of the piers.
I protect myself with this look
that flows from waves where no dawn would go,
I, poet without arms, lost
in the vomiting multitude,
with no effusive horse to shear
the thick moss from my temples.

The fat lady went first
and the crowds kept looking for pharmacies
where the bitter tropics could be found.
Only when a flag went up and the first dogs arrived
did the entire city rush to the railings of the boardwalk. 

According to Brueghel
when Icarus fell
it was spring

a farmer was ploughing
his field
the whole pageantry

of the year was
awake tingling
near

the edge of the sea
concerned
with itself

sweating in the sun
that melted
the wings' wax

unsignificantly
off the coast
there was

a splash quite unnoticed
this was
Icarus drowning


This is the ballad of Langemarck, 
A story of glory and might; 
Of the vast Hun horde, and Canada’s part 
In the great grim fight. 

It was April fair on the Flanders Fields, 
But the dreadest April then 
That ever the years, in their fateful flight, 
Had brought to this world of men. 

North and east, a monster wall, 
The mighty Hun ranks lay, 
With fort on fort, and iron-ringed trench, 
Menacing, grim and gray. 

And south and west, like a serpent of fire, 
Serried the British lines, 
And in between, the dying and dead, 
And the stench of blood, and the trampled mud, 
On the fair, sweet Belgian vines. 

And far to the eastward, harnessed and taut, 
Like a scimitar, shining and keen, 
Gleaming out of that ominous gloom, 
Old France’s hosts were seen. 

When out of the grim Hun lines one night, 
There rolled a sinister smoke;— 
A strange, weird cloud, like a pale, green shroud, 
And death lurked in its cloak. 

On a fiend-like wind it curled along 
Over the brave French ranks, 
Like a monster tree its vapours spread, 
In hideous, burning banks 
Of poisonous fumes that scorched the night 
With their sulphurous demon danks. 

And men went mad with horror, and fled 
From that terrible, strangling death, 
That seemed to sear both body and soul 
With its baleful, flaming breath. 

Till even the little dark men of the south, 
Those fierce, wild fighters of Afric’s steppes, 
Broke their battalions and ran:— 

Ran as they never had run before, 
Gasping, and fainting for breath; 
For they knew ’t was no human foe that slew; 
And that hideous smoke meant death. 

Then red in the reek of that evil cloud, 
The Hun swept over the plain; 
And the murderer’s dirk did its monster work, 
’Mid the scythe-like shrapnel rain; 

Till it seemed that at last the brute Hun hordes 
Had broken that wall of steel; 
And that soon, through this breach in the freeman’s dyke, 
His trampling hosts would wheel;— 

And sweep to the south in ravaging might, 
And Europe’s peoples again 
Be trodden under the tyrant’s heel, 
Like herds, in the Prussian pen. 

But in that line on the British right, 
There massed a corps amain, 
Of men who hailed from a far west land 
Of mountain and forest and plain; 

Men new to war and its dreadest deeds, 
But noble and staunch and true; 
Men of the open, East and West, 
Brew of old Britain’s brew. 

These were the men out there that night, 
When Hell loomed close ahead; 
Who saw that pitiful, hideous rout, 
And breathed those gases dread; 
While some went under and some went mad; 
But never a man there fled. 

For the word was "Canada," theirs to fight, 
And keep on fighting still;— 
Britain said, fight, and fight they would, 
Though the Devil himself in sulphurous mood 
Came over that hideous hill. 

Yea, stubborn, they stood, that hero band, 
Where no soul hoped to live; 
For five, ’gainst eighty thousand men, 
Were hopeless odds to give. 

Yea, fought they on! ’T was Friday eve, 
When that demon gas drove down; 
’T was Saturday eve that saw them still 
Grimly holding their own; 

Sunday, Monday, saw them yet, 
A steadily lessening band, 
With "no surrender" in their hearts, 
But the dream of a far-off land, 

Where mother and sister and love would weep 
For the hushed heart lying still;— 
But never a thought but to do their part, 
And work the Empire’s will. 

Ringed round, hemmed in, and back to back, 
They fought there under the dark, 
At grim, red Langemarck. 

Wonderful battles have shaken this world, 
Wonderful struggles of right against wrong, 
Sung in the rhymes of the world’s great song, 
But never a greater than this. 

Bannockburn, Inkerman, Balaclava, 
Marathon’s godlike stand; 
But never a more heroic deed, 
And never a greater warrior breed, 
In any war-man’s land. 

This is the ballad of Langemarck, 
A story of glory and might; 
Of the vast Hun horde, and Canada’s part 
In the great, grim fightthe calm
cool face of the river
asked not for a 
kiss
but for my fondest wish
so I tossed a coin
to the fish
and took a minute to list
what left I have 
to live for


When a man is in love 
how can he use old words? 
Should a woman 
desiring her lover 
lie down with 
grammarians and linguists? 

I said nothing 
to the woman I loved 
but gathered 
love's adjectives into a suitcase 
and fled from all languages. 

Rhythm and sound of falling leaves are
Not the same in all language

In each and every language
There is a different linguistics of
Its own. Yet, we are trying to make a harmony

Then whats about our hearts? 
Lets go through a common language of love

For John Mateer

I'll speak you mine, you speak me yours
since all's in the telling, content, form

to mangle the Master's eavesdropping
on subalterns' whispers, going Chinese

subversive, maybe just incomprehensible
or incomprehensibly blunt. My Farsi

the fierce Real or the sad Other of the Master-
Signifiers, Sylvester to their Tweety or 

a Roadrunner, mercurial, radical
to thwart the tyrant's order of things? I'll say

something to you, you say something
to me, and bar me from understanding

this or that - who'd ever want me
in control, so damn crazy to accumulate

secrets, gossip, sedition, gesticulation 
even if I am, say, sentient, so what 

's in it for you? Forge a discourse
to chain your/my tongue/s. You'll write me

yours, I write you mine, and we'll relish
the mystery of the written sign, the tricky 

similitude between things, incoherent
thorn in the monoglot Master's eye. 

This is no revealation, 
this mawkish feeling, 
warm and helpless.
Maybe baby
you know the reason? 

This is a season 
unknown to Spring. 
an emergance through
the permafrost of thought
into a softening.

Caught in this baby glow
of ridiculous languor. 
I reach for my bottle.


   Vows have I made by fruitless hope inspired;
   Celestial pity I again implore;--
   Restore him to my sight--great Jove, restore!"
   So speaking, and by fervent love endowed
   With faith, the Suppliant heavenward lifts her hands;
   While, like the sun emerging from a cloud,
  Her countenance brightens--and her eye expands;
  Her bosom heaves and spreads, her stature grows;
  As she expects the issue in repose.

  O terror! what hath she perceived?--O joy!
  What doth she look on?--whom doth she behold?
  Her Hero slain upon the beach of Troy?
  His vital presence? his corporeal mould?
  It is--if sense deceive her not--'tis He!

  Mild Hermes spake--and touched her with his wand
  That calms all fear; "Such grace hath crowned thy prayer,
  Laodamia! that at Jove's command
  Thy husband walks the paths of upper air:
  He comes to tarry with thee three hours' space;
  Accept the gift, behold him face to face!"

  Again that consummation she essayed;
  But unsubstantial Form eludes her grasp
  As often as that eager grasp was made.
  The Phantom parts--but parts to re-unite,
  And re-assume his place before her sight.

  "Protesiláus, lo! thy guide is gone!
  Confirm, I pray, the vision with thy voice:
  This is our palace,--yonder is thy throne;
  Speak, and the floor thou tread'st on will rejoice.
  Not to appal me have the gods bestowed
  This precious boon; and blest a sad abode


  "Great Jove, Laodamia! doth not leave
  His gifts imperfect:--Spectre though I be,
  I am not sent to scare thee or deceive;
  But in reward of thy fidelity.
  And something also did my worth obtain;
  For fearless virtue bringeth boundless gain.

  "Thou knowest, the Delphic oracle foretold
  That the first Greek who touched the Trojan strand
  Should die; but me the threat could not withhold:
  A generous cause a victim did demand;
  And forth I leapt upon the sandy plain;
  A self-devoted chief--by Hector slain


  "Supreme of Heroes--bravest, noblest, best!
  Thy matchless courage I bewail no more,
  Which then, when tens of thousands were deprest
  By doubt, propelled thee to the fatal shore;
  Thou found'st--and I forgive thee--here thou art--
  A nobler counsellor than my poor heart.

  "But thou, though capable of sternest deed,
  Wert kind as resolute, and good as brave;
  And he, whose power restores thee, hath decreed
  Thou should'st elude the malice of the grave:
  Redundant are thy locks, thy lips as fair
   As when their breath enriched Thessalian air.

  "No spectre greets me,--no vain Shadow this;
  Come, blooming Hero, place thee by my side!
  Give, on this well-known couch, one nuptial kiss
  To me, this day a second time thy bride!"
  Jove frowned in heaven: the conscious Parcae threw
  Upon those roseate lips a Stygian hue.

  "This visage tells thee that my doom is past:
  Nor should the change be mourned, even if the joys
  Of sense were able to return as fast
  And surely as they vanish. Earth destroys
  Those raptures duly---Erebus disdains:
  Calm pleasures there abide--majestic pains.

  "Be taught, O faithful Consort, to control
  The depth, and not the tumult, of the soul;
  A fervent, not ungovernable love.
  Thy transports moderate; and meekly mourn
  When I depart, for brief is my sojourn--"

  "Ah wherefore?--Did not Hercules by force
  Wrest from the guardian monster of the tomb
  Alcestis, a reanimated corse,
  Given back to dwell on earth in vernal bloom?
  Medea's spells dispersed the weight of years,
  And aeson stood a youth 'mid youthful peers.

  Yet further may relent: for mightier far
  Than strength of nerve and sinew, or the sway
  Of magic potent over sun and star,
  Is love, though oft to agony distrest,
  And though his favourite seat be feeble woman's breast.

  "But if thou goest, I follow--" "Peace!" he said,--
  She looked upon him and was calmed and cheered;
  The ghastly colour from his lips had fled;
  In his deportment, shape, and mien, appeared
  Elysian beauty, melancholy grace,
  Brought from a pensive though a happy place.

  He spake of love, such love as Spirits feel
  In worlds whose course is equable and pure;
  No fears to beat away--no strife to heal--
 The past unsighed for, and the future sure;
 Spake of heroic arts in graver mood
 Revived, with finer harmony pursued;


 Of all that is most beauteous--imaged there
 In happier beauty; more pellucid streams,
 An ampler ether, a diviner air,
 And fields invested with purpureal gleams;
 Climes which the sun, who sheds the brightest day
 Earth knows, is all unworthy to survey.


 Yet there the Soul shall enter which hath earned
 That privilege by virtue.--"Ill," said he,
 "The end of man's existence I discerned,
 Who from ignoble games and revelry
 Could draw, when we had parted, vain delight,
 While tears were thy best pastime, day and night;


 "And while my youthful peers before my eyes
 (Each hero following his peculiar bent)
 Prepared themselves for glorious enterprise
 By martial sports,--or, seated in the tent,
 Chieftains and kings in council were detained;
 What time the fleet at Aulis lay enchained.


 "The wished-for wind was given:--I then revolved
 The oracle, upon the silent sea;
 And, if no worthier led the way, resolved
 That, of a thousand vessels, mine should be
 The foremost prow in pressing to the strand,--
 Mine the first blood that tinged the Trojan sand.


 "Yet bitter, oft-times bitter, was the pang
 When of thy loss I thought, beloved Wife!
 On thee too fondly did my memory hang,
 And on the joys we shared in mortal life,--
 The paths which we had trod--these fountains, flowers:
 My new-planned cities, and unfinished towers.


 "But should suspense permit the Foe to cry,
 'Behold they tremble!--haughty their array,
 Yet of their numbers no one dares to die?'
 In soul I swept the indignity away:
 Old frailties then recurred:--but lofty thought,
 In act embodied, my deliverance wrought.


 "And Thou, though strong in love, art all too weak
 In reason, in self-government too slow;
 I counsel thee by fortitude to seek
 Our blest re-union in the shades below.
 The invisible world with thee hath sympathised;
 Be thy affections raised and solemnised.


 "Learn, by a mortal yearning, to ascend--
 Seeking a higher object. Love was given,
 Encouraged, sanctioned, chiefly for that end;
 For this the passion to excess was driven--
 That self might be annulled: her bondage prove
 The fetters of a dream opposed to love.--


 Aloud she shrieked! for Hermes re-appears!
 Round the dear Shade she would have clung--'tis vain:
 The hours are past--too brief had they been years;
 And him no mortal effort can detain:
 Swift, toward the realms that know not earthly day,
 He through the portal takes his silent way,
 And on the palace-floor a lifeless corse She lay.


 Thus, all in vain exhorted and reproved,
 She perished; and, as for a wilful crime,
 Was doomed to wear out her appointed time,
 Apart from happy Ghosts, that gather flowers
 Of blissful quiet 'mid unfading bowers.


 --Yet tears to human suffering are due;
 And mortal hopes defeated and o'erthrown
 Are mourned by man, and not by man alone,
 As fondly he believes.--Upon the side
 Of Hellespont (such faith was entertained)
 A knot of spiry trees for ages grew
 From out the tomb of him for whom she died;
 And ever, when such stature they had gained
 That Ilium's walls were subject to their view,
 The trees' tall summits withered at the sight;
 A constant interchange of growth and blight

He gently picks her out 

Fondly holding

Making her comfortable on his lap


With his arms around her

His fingers gently work up a rhythm

And he knows which strings to touch 


Creating a world of magic with a guitar

While moving to the beat of his music, 

I watched, lapsing into bliss

My laptop is a house of reflection
With so many thoughts needing correction
It has given me a welcoming reception
And at the hard drive is a cross section
That requires a proper inspection

I have deleted and recycled many files of imperfection
I am hoping to install with the latest media direction
A natural selection of software collections
That will aid me in my journey of reflection

So far the gadget has made a great visual impression
My house of reflection may soon reach to perfection
But from the real world I feel a sense of disconnection
It is called today's technology infection
All caused by the internet's personal affection

I feel that life is an obsession
We grow into different professions
Life for many soon becomes a misconception
There is aggression and depression
Racism appears due to different complexions
And after arrives a level of suspension
When we reach our old ages at midsection

Correction! Correction! 
I have a small confession
I am addicted to material possessions
Maybe someday I will have spiritual protection
And finally make some progression in my thoughts of reflection

Do you have any objection? 
What is your perception? 
How can I reflect to reach my final projection? 
On my lips I have a serious Question
How can I avoid this modern feeling of Isolation? 

     If  I  may, this  one  more  time, 
      How  much  I  really  love  you, 
         In  poetry  and  in  rhyme.

       I  see  our  love  more  clearly, 
  Though  I'm  blind  in  love  with  thee.
      I  hold  your  love  much  closer, 
   For  it's  yours  through  which  I  see.

       Your  voice  is, oh  so  soothing
  As  your  loving  sounds  come  through.
         It  keeps  me  ever  yearning
      For  the  sounds  of  loving  you.

      I  feel   loves  sweet  sensation
     Every  time  I  hold  your  hand.
       And  draw  you  ever  closer
     For  that  feeling, oh  so  grand.

          Your  kisses  last  forever
     As  we  hold  our  love  in  place, 
   And  taste  sweet  fruit  and  nectar
     When  our  loving  lips  embrace.

     I  smell  your  pleasant  fragrance
         As  I  wander  near  and  far.
         Thankful  to  the  girl  I  love
       For  the  flower  that  you  are.

       Oh, Lara, please  remember
       All  the  things  we  lovers  say
         Are  often  gone  tomorrow, 
    Placed  in  dreams  of  yesterday.

    But  if  you've  found  contentment, 
    For  I  know  I've  found  the  same.
        We'll  have  our  love  forever
      And  we'll  call  it  by  your  name.



I  wish  to  dedicate  this  poem  to  Boris  Pasternak  for
the  book,  David  Lean  for the direction,  Maurice  Jarre 
whose  image  of  Lara  made  this  poem  possible  after  years  of  waiting  for  the  gift  to  arrive. 

Remembering the Strait of Belle Isle or
some northerly harbor of Labrador,
before he became a schoolteacher
a great-uncle painted a big picture.

Receding for miles on either side
into a flushed, still sky
are overhanging pale blue cliffs
hundreds of feet high,

their bases fretted by little arches,
the entrances to caves
running in along the level of a bay
masked by perfect waves.

On the middle of that quiet floor
sits a fleet of small black ships,
square-rigged, sails furled, motionless,
their spars like burnt match-sticks.

And high above them, over the tall cliffs'
semi-translucent ranks,
are scribbled hundreds of fine black birds
hanging in n's in banks.

One can hear their crying, crying,
the only sound there is
except for occasional sizhine
as a large aquatic animal breathes.

In the pink light
the small red sun goes rolling, rolling,
round and round and round at the same height
in perpetual sunset, comprehensive, consoling,

while the ships consider it.
Apparently they have reached their destination.
It would be hard to say what brought them there,
commerce or contemplation. 

Oh my god, she blows my mind, 
She beautiful and gorgeous; she’s one of a kind, 
She can mould and manipulate me, 
Into whatever she may please or desire, 
She’s the one that sets my heart on fire, 
There’s just something about her; but what could it be? 

She brushes straight past and gives me a glance, 
And spins my heart into a raging trance, 
It comes up into my mouth and I try to swallow it again, 
But my heart longs for her in such a fashion, 
That I lust for her with such a passion, 
Surely she knows it; but just puts me through pain, 

When I see her my heart rings like a bell, 
But deep down I know she’s putting me through hell, 
On my heart her name is burned, 
However I go back and ask for more, 
I need to know-just to make sure, 
That my love for her will never be returned. 

You've all heard of Larry O'Toole,
Of the beautiful town of Drumgoole;
He had but one eye,
To ogle ye by—
Oh, murther, but that was a jew'l!
A fool
He made of de girls, dis O'Toole.

'Twas he was the boy didn't fail,
That tuck down pataties and mail;
He never would shrink
From any sthrong dthrink,
Was it whisky or Drogheda ale;
I'm bail
This Larry would swallow a pail.

Oh, many a night at the bowl,
With Larry I've sot cheek by jowl;
He's gone to his rest,
Where's there's dthrink of the best,
And so let us give his old sowl
A howl,
For 'twas he made the noggin to rowl. 


Las Vegas, Las Vegas, the city of dreams, 
The city of triumph and utter disaster.
For you can win and gain a most vast amount, 
But you can also loose without a count.

I advise you my friend, to watch yourself 
With the up most of care and thought.

Stay away from the one arm bandits 
And be careful of the thieves and 
Hustlers which rob you in vain.

Stroll the streets for a meal which is cheap, 
But I am sure sure that the food will be 
Cut back, for then you will have more money 
To play Black Jack.

I know that you cannot resist the temptation 
Of having a bit of a gamble, but in order 
To not appear like a spanner, be sure 
To place your wages in a casual manner.

I am sure that the gambling will carry on 
Throughout the dead of night, and no 
one will stop your addiction, not even 
Your wife! 

So you are flat-broke and you are on your 
Flight home, at least you have enjoyed 
your time, but remember my friend, Las 
Vegas is an ultimate unknown; for 
It is the city of triumph and utter 
Disaster. 

Meaningless in every way, 
Trying to figure it out.
The one reason for me to stay, 

Gazing to the ceiling, 
I can see the rope dangling, 
To wipe away the feeling.
 
Reaching out with arms of sacrifice, 
I tighten the knot around my neck, 
And make an end to all the alibis.

Gazing at the floor.
I can see my feet dangling.
Awaiting for the final door. 

I wrote a poem on the mist
And a woman asked me what I meant by it.
I had thought till then only of the beauty of the mist,
how pearl and gray of it mix and reel,
And change the drab shanties with lighted lamps at evening
into points of mystery quivering with color.

I answered:
The whole world was mist once long ago and some day
it will all go back to mist,
Our skulls and lungs are more water than bone and tissue
And all poets love dust and mist because all the last answers
Go running back to dust and mist. 

Spun silk of mercy,
long-limbed afternoon,
sun urging purple blossoms from baked stems.   
What better blessing than to move without hurry   
under trees?
Lugging a bucket to the rose that became a twining   
house by now, roof and walls of vine—
you could live inside this rose.
Pouring a slow stream around the
ancient pineapple crowned with spiky fruit,   
I thought we would feel old
by the year 
Walt Disney thought cars would fly.

What a drama to keep thinking the last summer   
the last birthday
before the calendar turns to zeroes.
My neighbor says anything we plant
in September takes hold.
She’s lining pots of little grasses by her walk.

I want to know the root goes deep   
on all that came before,
you could lay a soaker hose across   
your whole life and know
there was something
under layers of packed summer earth   
and dry blown grass
to moisten. 

Bananas are nutritious for you and me 


and oh so cheap.
I've nothing bad to say about them; no, not one peep! 
In banana splits, ice cream's on top; banana is underneath.
They're super easy to peel, AND 


to eat, you need no teeth.

From the depths of my demented mind, this poem title came.
If only one banana was left, the world would never be the same.

Her blood boiled.
Her legs shook.

All those tears.

I fear that stranger from afar
He looks and wanders
Face all covered with scars.

Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
I fear that stranger from afar
He whispers chills into the air
He freezes my soul with a single stare.

Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
I fear that stranger from afar
Blood red shot eyes look at me
The fear in my brown one's he can see.

Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
I fear that stranger from afar
Step by step he limps his way
Thump by thump my heart fears today was its last day

Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
I fear that stranger from afar
I turn around and start to run from that stare
But when I turn he stands right there.

Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
I fear that stranger from afar
He smiles exposing rotting yellow teeth and horrible breath
I know that this is a sign of Death.

Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
I fear that stranger from afar
I close my eyes and pray
oh catch them quick quicksilver breath
on windowpanes my melting images

my driftwood brushed away from peeling canvases
what more is there to say they shrug
I turn away what more? can tears

form syllables

only worlds, worlds on worlds remain
all unexplained and me
running out of time and paper

or with a cupboard bare
or elsewhere to sleep resplendently
but how

when the names of things are floating away
and I have lost
my nets of gold.

Behind the curtains of this gloomy night
Let us pretend that what we have is wide
And not end all of it with just another fight

Let’s try to make it work this time
Let us pretend that all we had is in the past
Open up a new page for the first time
Hoping that this time it will last

But yet we know that soon we’ll break it
This vase can only hold one rose
The water in it cannot take it
It’s now as black as the last bruise from your last dose


Don't grieve for me, now I am gone
You knew I could not stay -
The road was rough, I was too weak
To last another day; 

I knew my days were numbered, 
Although to leave was sad -
So many lovely memories
Of everything I had; 

My life, my loves, my family
That meant so much to me -
I carry them within my heart
To where I need to be; 

And where I go is not so far, 
I'm just a thought away -
You call to me and I'll be there
Beside you as you pray; 

My heavenly family's waiting, 
I see them gather 'round -
Find peace, and know I'm not alone, 
For I am heaven bound.

The hand of time 
Held my tears in check
As I remembered the day
We received news of my brother’s death-so many years ago


She watches as the phone rings
Her mother smiles and gives her a wink
Then from happy to sad 
All in one breath
She had received bad news 
I could feel her shake with tears
As she screamed in the phone-NOOOOOO

A hand held
As a small child
Tries to comfort her mum
All her mother could do was look at me
With so much pain 
Not understand what was going on
She watched as her mother dropped the phone
Ran in her room and locked her door
Confused she stood at the door
All she could do was cry-as she listened to her mother’s sobs
For hours she stood thus
Listening to the wailing cries-scared and unsure
What to do-who to tell-the child could barely speak 
Let alone reach the handle of the door 
To open and try to comfort her mum

Then banging on the front door 
As she heard her brothers and sisters yell
Open the door as they returned from school
Unable to reach the handle 
She did the next best thing 
And opened a window 
For one of her brothers to climb in

Next thing she knew 
Her dad came home
Angry-Mad-not saying a word

Then brothers and sister whispering words
Not saying much but crying instead
Confused she watched the drama unfold

Why would nobody tell her what’s wrong
Brothers being staunch sister eyes wet with tears
Why would no one tell her what’s wrong

Then words all mumbled death.  

gone.  

brother.  

she looked on in fear
Why was everyone so sad


TELL ME SOMEONE

His name was never mentioned again
I was only four years old
My brother was with us one minute gone the next
I could never understand why back then
Till I was old enough to understand

Tears trickle down my face
As I remember his warm embrace
When I said my last goodbye never really knowing 
I would never see him again 
Still brings me to tears

How we are poor, who once had riches,
And lie out in the sparse and sodden
Pastures that the cows have trodden,
The while an autumn night seals down
The comforts of the wooden town.

Come, let us counsel some cold stranger
How we sought safety, but loved danger.
So, with stiff walls about us, we
Chose this more fragile boundary:
Hills, where light poplars, the firm oak,
Loosen into a little smoke. 

If life was lived
Would hearts tear tattered sleeve? 
If life was loved
Would I kill to be free? 
We may walk in our sleep
Wide awake while we dream
In chains we may fly
Unpleased we all die
The ghosts that we keep
I hold my breath as we pass
Cross your heart on my name
Break the face in the glass
Sleep well one more night
Scolding sun has yet to break
Broken stars who bleed light
For love is alive
Will you run for your life? 
I'd chase such flickering wings
My butterfly wife
You may wake not tomorrow
Tonight our lips sway the breeze
That blows on right through us
Like empty branches on treeslips by lips
breath by breath
here we meet
let's forget the rest
i hug you closer
your hand in my shoulder
fondle my frozen-skin
burning every single inch
our tongues make a sign
our heartbeat write the rhyme
for a second, i mute the time
wander to your deepest mind
hope this moment last longer
no matter if we wake-up the world anger
i'll be stronger, i'll be better
as long as we stay together, forever
until the death come for sure. 

earthzcity, street lamps flickers
and dims until the only light it casts
is but a reflection of the moon
the wind lends a whisper
to every leaf
on every tree lining the empty street
chattering
it seems they all have something to say
but the flowers lay silent
glowing in midday 
they now appear quite fitting
to adorn the finest of graves
bled dry by night's contrast
they curse the full moon who 
binds their petals in such eerie bloom
shadows dart closer behind my gaze
matching my pace until
slowly closing the distance between us
their mocking foot steps
in such perfect rhythm
they call my bluff as
I halt on a whim
from the corner of my eye
they take form in unrecognizable objects
in the darkness
until I hardly believe they were there at all
but there is no such escape
it all boils down to whether or not
my feet can find the swiftness 
not to run 
but to chase


Last Leaf Standing

The rest had left
the tree was bare
but, there he was
just sitting there
holding on
with all his might
clinging to 
the tree of life.

The sun came out
tried it's best
to curl his edges
make him sweat
still the leaf
would not flow
onto the ground
where others go.

The wind came out
to try his way
to blow 
the little leaf away
he hung on tight
with all his might
this little leaf 
would stand and fight.

A storm came along
knocking on his door
it howled, it growled
it even roared
the little leaf
hung on so tight
no storm will get
to me tonight.

He woke next morning
to birds song
he yawned and he stretched
he sung away
wondering what else 
may come his way
The last little leaf
who dared to fight
clinging to the tree of life. 

Blue wind upon a distant windowpane, 
I hear you whistle folk songs to the rain
In tune with leaves that have no place to go.
Last light becomes the only home they know.

My friend, I feel your hand upon my skin.
The essence of the mood is paper thin.
Against the awesome turning of the earth, 
Warmth has about a cup of coffee's worth.

No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere:

And faith shines equal, arming me from fear. 

Almighty, ever-present Deity! 
  Life--that in me has rest, 
As I--undying Life--have power in Thee! 

  Vain are the thousand creeds 
That move men's hearts: unutterably vain;

  So surely anchor'd on 
The steadfast rock of immortality.

  Though earth and man were gone, 
And suns and universes cease to be, 
  And Thou were left alone, 
Every existence would exist in Thee. 

  There is not room for Death, 
Nor atom that his might could render void: 
  Thou--Thou art Being and Breath, 
And what Thou art may never be destroyed. 

Jan h

A dreadful darkness closes in
                On my bewildered mind;
O let me suffer and not sin,
                Be tortured yet resigned. 

Through all this world of whelming mist
                Still let me look to Thee,
And give me courage to resist
                The Tempter till he flee.

Weary I am -- O give me strength
                And leave me not to faint;
Say Thou wilt comfort me at length
                And pity my complaint.

I've begged to serve Thee heart and soul,
                To sacrifice to Thee
No niggard portion, but the whole
                Of my identity.

I hoped amid the brave and strong
                My portioned task might lie,
To toil amid the labouring throng
                With purpose pure and high.

But Thou hast fixed another part,
                And Thou hast fixed it well;
I said so with my breaking heart
                When first the anguish fell.

For Thou hast taken my delight
                And hope of life away,
And bid me watch the painful night
                And wait the weary day.

The hope and the delight were Thine;
                I bless Thee for their loan;
I gave Thee while I deemed them mine
                Too little thanks, I own.

Shall I with joy Thy blessings share
                And not endure their loss?
Or hope the martyr's crown to wear
                And cast away the cross?

These weary hours will not be lost,
                These days of passive misery,
These nights of darkness anguish tost
                If I can fix my heart on Thee.

Weak and weary though I lie,
                Crushed with sorrow, worn with pain,
Still I may lift to Heaven mine eyes
                And strive and labour not in vain,

That inward strife against the sins
                That ever wait on suffering;
To watch and strike where first begins
                Each ill that would corruption bring,

That secret labour to sustain
                With humble patience every blow,
To gather fortitude from pain
                And hope and holiness from woe.

Thus let me serve Thee from my heart
                Whatever be my written fate,
Whether thus early to depart
                Or yet awhile to wait.

If Thou shouldst bring me back to life
                More humbled I should be;
More wise, more strengthened for the strife,
                More apt to lean on Thee.

Should Death be standing at the gate
                Thus should I keep my vow;
                So let me serve Thee now.

Finished. Jan.   

All worldly shapes shall melt in gloom, 
The Sun himself must die, 
Before this mortal shall assume 
Its Immortality! 
I saw a vision in my sleep 
That gave my spirit strength to sweep 
Adown the gulf of Time! 
I saw the last of human mould, 
That shall Creation's death behold, 
As Adam saw her prime! 

The Sun's eye had a sickly glare, 
The Earth with age was wan, 
The skeletons of nations were 
Around that lonely man! 
Some had expired in fight,--the brands 
Still rested in their bony hands; 
In plague and famine some! 
Earth's cities had no sound nor tread; 
And ships were drifting with the dead 
To shores where all was dumb! 

Yet, prophet-like, that lone one stood 
With dauntless words and high, 
That shook the sere leaves from the wood 
As if a storm passed by, 
Saying, "We are twins in death, proud Sun, 
Thy face is cold, thy race is run, 
'Tis Mercy bids thee go. 
For thou ten thousand thousand years 
Hast seen the tide of human tears, 
That shall no longer flow. 

"What though beneath thee man put forth 
His pomp, his pride, his skill; 
And arts that made fire, floods, and earth, 
The vassals of his will;-- 
Yet mourn not I thy parted sway, 
Thou dim discrowned king of day: 
For all those trophied arts 
And triumphs that beneath thee sprang, 
Healed not a passion or a pang 
Entailed on human hearts. 

"Go, let oblivion's curtain fall 
Upon the stage of men, 
Nor with thy rising beams recall 
Life's tragedy again. 
Its piteous pageants bring not back, 
Nor waken flesh, upon the rack 
Of pain anew to writhe; 
Stretched in disease's shapes abhorred, 
Or mown in battle by the sword, 
Like grass beneath the scythe. 

"Ee'n I am weary in yon skies 
To watch thy fading fire; 
Test of all sumless agonies 
Behold not me expire. 
My lips that speak thy dirge of death-- 
Their rounded gasp and gurgling breath 
To see thou shalt not boast. 
The eclipse of Nature spreads my pall,-- 
The majesty of Darkness shall 
Receive my parting ghost! 

"This spirit shall return to Him 
That gave its heavenly spark; 
Yet think not, Sun, it shall be dim 
When thou thyself art dark! 
No! it shall live again, and shine 
In bliss unknown to beams of thine, 
By Him recalled to breath, 
Who captive led captivity. 
Who robbed the grave of Victory,-- 
And took the sting from Death! 

"Go, Sun, while Mercy holds me up 
On Nature's awful waste 
To drink this last and bitter cup 
Of grief that man shall taste-- 
Go, tell the night that hides thy face, 
Thou saw'st the last of Adam's race, 
On Earth's sepulchral clod, 
The darkening universe defy 
To quench his Immortality, 
from their vast sun-driven flocks
into consubstantial dusk.
A snow wind flosses the bleak rocks,

strips from the gums their rags of bark,
and spins the coil of winter tight
round our last meeting as we walk
the littoral zone of day and night,

light's turncoat margin: rocks and trees
dissolve in nightfall-eddying waters;
tumbling whorls of cloud disclose
the cold eyes of the sea-god's daughters.

We tread the wrack of grass that once
a silver-bearded congregation
whispered about our foolish love.
Your voice in calm annunciation

from the dry eminence of thought
rings with astringent melancholy:
'Could hope recall, or wish prolong
the vanished violence of folly?

Minute by minute summer died;
time's horny skeletons have built
this reef on which our love lies wrecked.
Our hearts drown in their cardinal guilt.' 
 
The world, said Ludwig Wittgenstein,
is everything that is the case.
- The warmth of human lips and thighs;
the lifeless cold of outer space;

this windy darkness; Scorpio
above, a watercourse of light;
the piercing absence of one face
withdrawn for ever from my sight. 

As long as one thinks everyone is right, 
As long as one inks every light is light, 
I see him in the dark, he is shining bright.

As long as one’s ready for coexistence, 
As long as one’s steady for tolerance, 
I pray for him and his existence.

As long as for the peace one dreams, 
As long as for the peace one streams, 
He will enlighten me like golden beams.

As long as one preaches to love everyone, 
As long as one teaches not to hate anyone, 
He is my beloved, I love that someone.

The one who preaches to hate everyone, 
The one who teaches not to love anyone, 
I’m doubtful of survival of that someone! 

Weapons cannot avoid an economic down fall, 
Wars cannot resolve any issue at all, 
I could not survive like the China Wall. 

last minute drugstore gifts are best for pure excitement! 
someone's sure to want just one more box of
chocolate covered cherries-

look around.  

the greeting cards are gone
but it's too late to mail them.
I buy rose colored lipstick for my sister

(as we planned) . in exchange she'll bring
her coin wrapped change to bear on
the lilac creme sachet I had my eye on

last Saturday. we conspire this way
considering ourselves true friends, true elves.
how surprised our Grandfather seems

each year unwrapping the same Old Spice aftershave
in a porcelain bottle: will the blue ship sail him away
to destinations he dreams of in the easy chair

perusing issues of the National Geographic? 
Anxiously he peers over his glasses: 
do you think she'd like this? 

wonder of wonders what find is this
a jewelry box beyond compare in tiers, with

rainbow opal figures from some chinese screen
inlaid on an ebony surface lined with
(it looks like)   bright red silk! 

oh yes, we breathe! my sister and I.
he seems relieved; we take our bundles home.
and wrap them poorly (too much tape)  
with bright good will. scissor curled ribbons.

my Grandmother's fingers trembling at the lid
of the beautiful, beautiful box; more beautiful than jewels themselves, 

my Grandfather's face-
a little sublime.


the days pass slowly; 
the minute pass slowly; 
the second pass slowly; 
then why the last month pass speedy.

when the year started we all are happy; 
when the year come at mid we are happy as well as
nervous; 
when the two month remain we are getting nervous; 
but when the last month come we all started crying.

this year has given us a beautiful fruit; 
but when this year come to end we all are mute; 
because we are remembering the sound of flute of 
beautiful year; 
that is why we pray to god that pass this last 
month slowly. 

No changes of support—only 
Patches of gray, here where sunlight fell. 
The house seems heavier 
Now that they have gone away.   
In fact it emptied in record time.   
When the flat table used to result 
A match recedes, slowly, into the night. 
The academy of the future is   
Opening its doors and willing 
The fruitless sunlight streams into domes,   
The chairs piled high with books and papers. 

The sedate one is this month's skittish one   
Confirming the property that, 
A timeless value, has changed hands. 
And you could have a new automobile 
Ping pong set and garage, but the thief   
Stole everything like a miracle. 
In his book there was a picture of treason only   
And in the garden, cries and colors. 

The little box which contains the world
Fell in love with herself
And conceived
Still another little box

The little box of the little box
Also fell in love with herself
And conceived
Still another little box

And so it went on forever

The world from the little box
Ought to be inside
The last offspring of the little box

But not one of the little boxes
Inside the little box in love with herself
Is the last one

Let's see you find the world now


Last night, last night, I held you in my arms
Cuddled close as the world spun night to day
Gazing sweetly upon your loving charms
Oh, for last night's embrace to be replayed

Last night, last night, special to me were you
Your head nestled so very close to mine
Dreaming of a love eternal and true
Oh, for last night's vision of love to find

Last night, last night, how close to me you seemed
Forever I could have held you with me
As your eyes fluttered sweetly as you dreamed
Oh, for last night's image of you to see

Last night, last night, I glimpsed our destiny
Lying in my arms, your hair all around
Forever, always, laying next to me
Oh, for last night's prophecy to abound

Last night, last night.   Just last night I held you
Oh, how I wish I were there beside you



yesterday evening and
that morning I
swam the Atlantic

Last night I sailed
the seven seas
this morning I survived
a Tiger and Shark Attack

I cannot find enough 
things to do 
So I going to start 
writing Love poems for you


I dreamed of you again last night
As I lay upon my bed, 
A passionate, exotic dream
Unraveled in my head; 

No doubt 'twas something that I ate
Just prior to retiring
That set the stage for such a dream
With all synapses firing; 

I don't recall the details now
Although the warmth remains, 
It must have been delicious
As this fire in my veins; 

I do recall on wakening
That sleep induced caress
That suddenly released me
As I tumbled from my nest, 

And much as I attempted
To resume that precious dream, 
'Twas fleeting and I lost it, 
Pure frustration made me scream! 

I dreamed of you again last night, 
It must have been exquisite -
My dream life beats reality.  .
That isn't fair now, is it? 




Where were you last night? I watched at the gate;
I went down early, I stayed down late.
Were you snug at home, I should like to know,
Or were you in the coppice wheedling Kate?

She's a fine girl, with a fine clear skin;
Easy to woo, perhaps not hard to win.
Speak up like a man and tell me the truth:
I'm not one to grow downhearted and thin.

If you love her best speak up like a man;
It's not I will stand in the light of your plan: 
Some girls might cry and scold you a bit,
And say they couldn't bear it; but I can.

Love was pleasant enough, and the days went fast;
Pleasant while it lasted, but it needn't last;
Awhile on the wax and awhile on the wane,
Now dropped away into the past.

Was it pleasant to you? To me it was;
Now clean gone as an image from glass,
As a goodly rainbow that fades away,
As dew that steams upward from the grass, 

As the first spring day, or the last summer day,
As the sunset flush that leaves heaven grey,
As a flame burnt out for lack of oil,
Which no pains relight or ever may.

Good luck to Kate and good luck to you:
I guess she'll be kind when you come to woo.
I wish her a pretty face that will last,
I wish her a husband steady and true.

Hate you? not I, my very good friend;
All things begin and all have an end. 
But let broken be broken; I put no faith
In quacks who set up to patch and mend.

Just my love and one word to Kate:
Not to let time slip if she means to mate;—
For even such a thing has been known
As to miss the chance while we weigh and wait. 

Last night-
I heard what I thought-
Were your whispers in the twilight of my dreams.
Lost it seems, once besides me.
No longer there-

I thought I felt the ripple of your breath-
In the stillness of the silent night.
Was it just a phantom of my mind? 
Could it been the loneliness since you went away? 
Maybe it was just wishful thinking


As I tossed and turned-
Sleep restless, empty I feel-
The song no longer plays, it just has faded away.
Falling off the edge, will I ever recover? 
To be right now so alone


As the dawn comes nears-
I smell the hint of your perfume.
Lingering still on my pillow.
Memories, they are coming back to me-
Haunting and bewitching me-

I wish I could just let go-
To drift into silent sleep-
Before the morning sunrise.
It’s almost too much to bear.
Just to think about you-Last night, your long-lost memory came back to me as though
Spring stealthily should come to a forsaken wilderness
A gentle breeze its fragrance over burning deserts blow
Or, all at once be soothed somehow the sick soul’s distress. 

the last leaves of autumn fell, 
finding a grave in the imprint
of stranger's feet-
shallow as it was, they seemed content

the leaves look more like wings, 
imaginary things
that carry with them, the first cold breath of winter

wind wrestled with the margins of a book
left outside the local coffee shop-
someone had forgotten it, maybe
they had no more use for it

to think about the nights
spent in the anguish of absence
when a book is the only sanctuary
in loneliness

this is the way
to make amends with shadows, 
to offer a truce to the past

on some nights
the book we read
is the one we're writing
and memory and wind
aren't always so comforting


Last night-- how deep the darkness was!
And well I knew its depths, because
I waded it from shore to shore,
Thinking to reach the light no more.

She would not even touch my hand---.
The winds rose and the cedars fanned
The moon out, and the stars fled back
In heaven and hid-- and all was black!

But ah! To-night a summons came,
Signed with a tear-drop for a name,
For as I wondering kissed it, lo
A line beneath it told me so.

And now-- the moon hangs over me
A disk of dazzling brilliancy,
And every star-tip stabs my sights
With splintered glitterings of light

Last night as I was sleeping,
I dreamt—marvelous error!—
that a spring was breaking
out in my heart.
I said: Along which secret aqueduct,
Oh water, are you coming to me,
water of a new life
that I have never drunk?

Last night as I was sleeping,
I dreamt—marvelous error!—
that I had a beehive
here inside my heart.
And the golden bees
were making white combs
and sweet honey
from my old failures.

Last night as I was sleeping,
I dreamt—marvelous error!—
that a fiery sun was giving
light inside my heart.
It was fiery because I felt
warmth as from a hearth,
and sun because it gave light
and brought tears to my eyes.

Last night as I slept,
I dreamt—marvelous error!—
here inside my heart. 

all I can do now is laugh
I have no tears left
for last night
I decided it was time
time to end it 
end the pain
end it all
I hung myself from my bed
just as I was about to give over to the darkness
the beautiful darkness
I heard foot steps
if they found me now it was over 
I would not die tonight
I struggled to un hang my self
just as I stood up
she walked in 
my mother walked in
she started to complain about work 
she didn't even notice the noose hanging behind me
or my tear stained face
or even that my face was reddish purple
how could she not notice
last night I found out 
that the truth is I did die last night 
whatever I had left inside died
that little bit of hope just melted awaylaughter is all that is left within
sweet laughter keeps me from going off the brink
no tears left within
all have been shed
for last night
the time came
time to end it
end the pain
end it all
noose tied oh so lose above the floor 
there I hung
slowly began to sway
darkness raising
slowly turning numb
time to give into the pain
almost into beautiful darkness
when the foot steps came
if found now
the darkness with never be reached
fought and struggled
out of the noose
regained balance
as she walked in
my mother walked in
she started to complain about her life and her stress
did she not see my distress
she paid no notice to the noose beside where I stood
nor the tear stained face 
or even purple-ish face infront of her
how could she not notice
there and then death took my soul
whatever once was held inside
was gone
once she left
I lay but an empty shell upon the floor 
staring up at the noose
all hope faded
emotions lost
dead inside


Last night I dreamed of chickens,
there were chickens everywhere,
they were standing on my stomach,
they were nesting in my hair,
they were pecking at my pillow,
they were hopping on my head,
they were ruffling up their feathers
as they raced about my bed.

They were on the chairs and tables,
they were on the chandeliers,
they were roosting in the corners,
they were clucking in my ears,
there were chickens, chickens, chickens
for as far as I could see. 
when I woke today, I noticed
there were eggs on top of me. 

Last night I dreamt of you
The sky was white and blue
Flapping your wings you flew 
Towards me shining with love
that was honest and true

Dreams are born out of imagination
They also spring out of need 
Sometimes they are fired by desire
Mine was probably triggered
by your presence in my moments

Last night I dreamt of you
You gazed at me and smiled
Flew past me by the sea sand
Stretching out your hand
Calling out my name
again, again and again
I wondered if it will rain

My imagination of you
Is completely brand new
My need for you
Is that we pair up as twos
My nightly dreamly desire
Is that you light up my fire

I can see you clearly
As you kiss me mildly
I can hear your heart pound
In rythm with the sea wave sounds
Ochestrating the right motions
Hence you get a promotion
to my private love ocean

Last night I dreamt of you
I wish dreams come true
It is funny
Everyone says that too

not knowing how to drive
not owning a car
I drove and knocked down
people I loved
.  

went through one town.

I stopped at Hedgeville
and slept in the back seat
.  

excited about my new life. 

Last Plight 

I know the days are  nearing  to say good bye  to all
The  curtains will be pulled on my eyes and silence will prevail.
Oh lord of all existence your messenger has come in this darkened night
Knocking the door of my soul  with lightening thunders and trying to hold my chords.

Oh  master of my  life, it  had been my prayers and the last plight
Let me see the ever beautiful dawn which had been my inspiration to unravel the closed path
Let my eyes see the first ray of Sun, guided  the  voyage of    life
I have already accomplished your ordained  role  and handed over my account.

Let me call to  all, who had been my co-passenger  during my travel to unknown lands
Let me say good bye  and convey my gratitude to all my  friends
And last, still I  seek  few moments  with you to sing my last song,  which you always recited me  to sail my boat. 

Here onwards  I wish to surrender to your might  for the  next journey of  your  cosmic cause. 

I.

I said---Then, dearest, since 'tis so,
Since now at length my fate I know,
Since nothing all my love avails,
Since all, my life seemed meant for, fails,
  Since this was written and needs must be---
My whole heart rises up to bless
Your name in pride and thankfulness!
Take back the hope you gave,---I claim
---Only a memory of the same,
---And this beside, if you will not blame,
  Your leave for one more last ride with me.

	II.

My mistress bent that brow of hers;
Those deep dark eyes where pride demurs
When pity would be softening through,
Fixed me, a breathing-while or two,
  With life or death in the balance: right!
The blood replenished me again;
My last thought was at least not vain:
I and my mistress, side by side
Shall be together, breathe and ride,
So, one day more am I deified.
  Who knows but the world may end tonight?

	III.

Hush! if you saw some western cloud
All billowy-bosomed, over-bowed
By many benedictions---sun's
And moon's and evening-star's at once---
  And so, you, looking and loving best,
Conscious grew, your passion drew
Cloud, sunset, moonrise, star-shine too,
Down on you, near and yet more near,
Till flesh must fade for heaven was here!---
Thus leant she and lingered---joy and fear!
  Thus lay she a moment on my breast.

	IV.

Then we began to ride. My soul
Smoothed itself out, a long-cramped scroll
Freshening and fluttering in the wind.
Past hopes already lay behind.
  What need to strive with a life awry?
Had I said that, had I done this,
So might I gain, so might I miss.
Might she have loved me? just as well
She might have hated, who can tell!
Where had I been now if the worst befell?
  And here we are riding, she and I.

	V.

Fail I alone, in words and deeds?
Why, all men strive and who succeeds?
We rode; it seemed my spirit flew,
Saw other regions, cities new,
  As the world rushed by on either side. 
I thought,---All labour, yet no less
Bear up beneath their unsuccess.
Look at the end of work, contrast
The petty done, the undone vast,
This present of theirs with the hopeful past!
  I hoped she would love me; here we ride.

	VI.

What hand and brain went ever paired?
What heart alike conceived and dared?
What act proved all its thought had been?
What will but felt the fleshly screen?
  We ride and I see her bosom heave. 
There's many a crown for who can reach,
Ten lines, a statesman's life in each!
The flag stuck on a heap of bones,
A soldier's doing! what atones?
They scratch his name on the Abbey-stones.
   My riding is better, by their leave.

	VII.

What does it all mean, poet? Well,
Your brains beat into rhythm, you tell
What we felt only; you expressed
You hold things beautiful the best,
  And pace them in rhyme so, side by side.
'Tis something, nay 'tis much: but then,
Have you yourself what's best for men?
Are you---poor, sick, old ere your time---
Nearer one whit your own sublime
Than we who never have turned a rhyme?
  Sing, riding's a joy! For me, I ride.

	VIII.

And you, great sculptor---so, you gave
A score of years to Art, her slave,
And that's your Venus, whence we turn
To yonder girl that fords the burn!
  You acquiesce, and shall I repine?
What, man of music, you grown grey
With notes and nothing else to say,
Is this your sole praise from a friend,
Greatly his opera's strains intend,
Put in music we know how fashions end!''
  I gave my youth; but we ride, in fine.

	IX.

Who knows what's fit for us? Had fate
Proposed bliss here should sublimate
My being---had I signed the bond---
Still one must lead some life beyond,
  Have a bliss to die with, dim-descried. 
This foot once planted on the goal,
This glory-garland round my soul,
Could I descry such? Try and test!
I sink back shuddering from the quest. 
Earth being so good, would heaven seem best?
  Now, heaven and she are beyond this ride.

	X.

And yet---she has not spoke so long!
What if heaven be that, fair and strong
At life's best, with our eyes upturned
Whither life's flower is first discerned,
  We, fixed so, ever should so abide?
What if we still ride on, we two
With life for ever old yet new,
Changed not in kind but in degree,
The instant made eternity,---
And heaven just prove that I and she
  Ride, ride together, for ever ride

A cup scraps along iron bars, cup of tea 
Sweeter than the honey and the honeycomb.
There were gleams in her teeth and her sad esprit.
Her smell brought the breeze from her funeral home. 
With hollow eyes, the moon climbed the night to see
Scientists of horror as  pieces of gnome, 
The dawns of hope and the sunsets of despair, 
Leaves dancing around as shadows in the air.


On hills, her voice was parched and glazed was her sight, 
The sooner rose dies the latter is its scent.
Tearing, roaring, she felt her  soul in the light, 
In a coming death was her sorry lament.
Her soul had sad wings for her flight in the night.
She was cribbed, confined in tears for this event.
Her legs bestrode the abyss to hold the pain, 
Her mind was whipping her memory in vain.


She felt a strange scent of garbage and perfume
She had a wheezing throat because of her fear.
Her mind touched the heavens to dispell her gloom
While keeping her thoughts to be her last frontier, 
More than real, o’er her hallucinating doom, 
Wanting to be happy, she felt her wet tear.
She felt that her execution  wasn't kind, 
But was a hellish paradise of the mind.

I shall be terminating the voyage of my  life 
Lying on the aged bed counting the breaths
Recollecting the days we spent together 
Rewinding the images beneath my eyes
Which you joined in the middle of my life 

Wonderful was the journey we struggled together
Happiness and sorrows were the order of  time
Pain and pleasure we shared together 
Wishes and desires, now that game is over
Good bye and the departure are now  on the threshold.

You shall be nearest to my sight 
Witnessing the trembling hands and stammering voice
Staring eyes with one sight 
I will look at you as young the day we unite.
With this wish to close my eyes for ever 

You join me till the  last rites 
You be the last one to put soil on the grave
Could see me till my last.
That will be last of  our sight.
Completing the journey of our union
Your  soul will be  left with a departed  heart.

Numerous  remembrances are there of our golden days 
Which will be enough for the remaining of your life 
 I have already registered  a site as per my will
Your grave will be besides of mine 
Again wish to be  your companion in next of our life. 

Whales must think of humans as a paradox.
We rent boats to photograph them and listen
Overcome with emotion
To the  to haunting cries from the deep.

Whilst we think of these wonderful and
Intelligent creatures, 
Crews in boats will be out there
With their explosive tipped harpoons
Chasing them until exhaustion sets in.

Dull thud and a missile finds its mark
Blood fountains in the air
Slow death as the lungs are ruptured
Then brought to the side of the whaling ship
They are stripped of their fat and flesh.

They are beautiful and graceful -
But how can anyone see them in the wild and hear
Their graceful song - their song of freedom
And wish this barbarous death
On a treasure of the sea.

Our childrens  children will see their end
Only see them in text books
Man - the killer of beauty and legend

These are mammals with warm blood
And the tradgedy is - 
They should not have to die. 

Mornings come and mornings go.
Ceaseless winds timeless blow.
As kismet rolls its enduring gall.
Another domino tumbles falls.
In the merge of days and nights.
Or the urge of dizzying heights.
Awed we gape unfolding paths, 
barren scapes, yon greener swaths.
In Hedonic shadows collecting debts.
Karma silent prances, weaving nets.
Along rut and creek of passing days, 
jilted songs and jarring forays.
Oblivious we sail on endless fret.
Lonely to hush of the last sunset.

Go to bed and never wake up
breathe your last breath
cry your last tears
remember the good times
the laughters
of your crushes
remember the hard times
the misery
the depressions
ransack your mind 
for all of these memories
remember the hugs and kisses
the mistakes of life
remember these
because you'll dream for eternity
death has taken you from your peaceful sleep
and it won't let you go


I’m walking on the train tracks
And waiting for the train, 
I’m standing at a crossing point
And crying in the rain.

I don’t know why I came here, 
Although I know the place, 
I think I’m trying to recall
A long-forgotten face.

I was just a child, and
He was just my friend, 
Innocent and playful kids
Right until the end.

We were running on the train tracks
And we were playing train, 
We were standing at a crossing point
And splashing in the rain.

There was thunder all around us, 
And lightning flashing bright, 
We didn’t here the whistle, 
We didn’t see the light.

Not until it was too late, 
I’m standing here right now, 
He tripped and fell right on this root
Under the old willow bough.

I was dashing down the train tracks
And running from the train, 
I was making for the crossing point
And screaming in the rain.

I didn’t realize he was gone
Until I reached the station, 
The footsteps that I’d heard behind, 
Creations of imagination.

I went back along the tracks, 
Shouting his name, calling it out, 
Afraid I’d find a broken body, 
But as I ran, I began to doubt.

I was stumbling on the train tracks
Far behind the train, 
I was far from the crossing point
And searching in the rain.

A note of desperation crept into my voice, 
A voice that was slowly going weak.
And as my legs began to give, 
I heard his voice, I heard him speak.

I panicked now, where could he be, 
I didn’t see him on the tracks, 
The rain was stinging, my vision blurred, 
I couldn’t hear over deafening cracks.

I was looking round the train tracks
Not caring bout the train, 
I was thinking of the crossing point, 
So far from this rain.

I heard his voice, oh, it was so weak, 
Coming from the bottom of the hill.
I slid down and there he was, 
And then I heard the whistle shrill.

I told him to wait, and then I ran
Back up the hill, fast as I could.
Up on the tracks, the train stopped for me, 
I asked them to help, they said they would.

I was going down the train tracks, 
And riding on the train, 
I was coming to the crossing point
Still dripping from the rain.

I’ve never been afraid like I was then, 
I sat there and watched him breathe, 
Watched his chest as it rose and fell, 
Gripped his arm through his woolen sleeve.

That was the last time we played together, 
The last time we ran on the tracks, 
The single time that we raced the train
With the rain pounding on our backs.

I’m no longer on the train tracks, 
But I’m waiting for the train, 
I’ve finally reached the crossing point
And stepped out of the rain.

I still remember the party they had, 
I still recall that final day.
His teary face now springs to mind, 
The face he had as he was torn away.

Now the cobwebs are swept away, 
Like dust blown off an ancient tome, 
And now I’m finally remembering
As I ride the last train home. 

Comrades, if I don't live to see the day
-- I mean,if I die before freedom comes --
take me away
and bury me in a village cemetery in Anatolia.

The worker Osman whom Hassan Bey ordered shot
can lie on one side of me, and on the other side
the martyr Aysha, who gave birth in the rye
and died inside of forty days.

Tractors and songs can pass below the cemetery --
in the dawn light, new people, the smell of burnt gasoline,
fields held in common, water in canals,
no drought or fear of the police.

Of course, we won't hear those songs:
the dead lie stretched out underground
and rot like black branches,
deaf, dumb, and blind under the earth.

But, I sang those songs
before they were written,
I smelled the burnt gasoline
before the blueprints for the tractors were drawn.

As for my neighbors,
the worker Osman and the martyr Aysha,
they felt the great longing while alive,
maybe without even knowing it.

Comrades, if I die before that day, I mean
-- and it's looking more and more likely -- 
bury me in a village cemetery in Anatolia,
and if there's one handy,
              a plane tree could stand at my head,
              I wouldn't need a stone or anything.

        But the disgrace is mine; 
    Your love was dark and thorough, 
    Mine was the love of the sun for a flower 
        He creates with his shine. 

    I was diligent to explore you, 
        Blossom you stalk by stalk, 
    Till my fire of creation bore you 
    Shrivelling down in the final dour 
      Anguish -- then I suffered a balk. 

  I knew your pain, and it broke 
      My fine, craftsman's nerve; 
  Your body quailed at my stroke, 
  And my courage failed to give you the last 
      Fine torture you did deserve. 

  You are shapely, you are adorned, 
      But opaque and dull in the flesh, 
  Who, had I but pierced with the thorned 
  Fire-threshing anguish, were fused and cast 
      In a lovely illumined mesh. 

  Like a painted window: the best 
      Suffering burnt through your flesh, 
  Undrossed it and left it blest 
  With a quivering sweet wisdom of grace: but now 
      Who shall take you afresh? 

  Now who will burn you free 
      From your body's terrors and dross, 
  Since the fire has failed in me? 
  What man will stoop in your flesh to plough 
      The shrieking cross? 

  A mute, nearly beautiful thing 
      Is your face, that fills me with shame 
  As I see it hardening, 
      And darkening my eternal fame. 

the saddest year beckoned but you
did not know that yet
confetti in your hair

or snow or the leaves drifting, 
the last leaves
the crystal moon dipping

further down the sky

another year they cried on tv
hugging each other
insane with surprise that

they'd survived another one.
from coast to coast
or all around the world

under their various sunrises
wishing it would be-
what was to be-

dripping with tawny happiness

straight from the honeycomb itself.
oh we would be drenched in light Eternal
like the flowers in the

impressionists gardens
somewhere, outside the museums.
it's in the air, isn't it

in the cold razzle dazzle
happy as in it's your birthday
every day and here it comes

the year long birthday cake
with every candle lit
well, doesn't it? 

seem that way to you? 

only not, this time, 
a something chimes from out the deep.
maybe, next time.

in the twilight, nodding from side
to side, turning slowly around and around
on himself, scuffing the four-footed
circle into the earth. He sniffs the sweat
in the breeze, he understands
a creature, a death-creature,
watches from the fringe of the trees,
finally he understands
I am no longer here, he himself
from the fringe of the trees watches
a black bear
get up, eat a few flowers, trudge away,
all his fur glistening
in the rain.
 
And what glistening! Sancho Fergus,
my boychild, had such great shoulders,
when he was born his head
came out, the rest of him stuck. And he opened
his eyes: his head out there all alone
in the room, he squinted with pained,
barely unglued eyes at the ninth-month's
blood splashing beneath him
on the floor. And almost
smiled, I thought, almost forgave it all in advance.
 
When he came wholly forth
I took him up in my hands and bent
over and smelled
the black, glistening fur
of his head, as empty space
must have bent
over the newborn planet
and smelled the grasslands and the ferns.{ Terza Rima Format Poetry }



The twenty carat gold in sky
Slowly losing its brilliance
Likely to hide being so shy

Over to west in a distance
Hiding by and by as it could
As if in slow tick tack cadence

Just to hide in a day for good
In loath to hide luster outright
As it's mandated, Sun should

And a must to fade in twilight
As its role for the day is done
For the heavenly show at night

Star Sirius said; 'It's our time Sun; 
Hide! We're here now. I'm serious
I'm not kidding, now we'll give - fun

and so the sun hides in darkness
Sirius and guests show their brightness



     & purple vetch, we stuck down

a tent, like punctuation, and drank through the evening
our bottle of bad wine. When you looked up,
the weather was holding: a few breezes,

a full moon silvering the flowers

to white. In the distance, I heard the ache
& slide of snow, the beginning of crickets. It was twilight—

the landscape was lifting.

                    •

               A mountain. The clouds, further up,
came down. A Book of Hours. A tent in which we twisted,
pressed each against the other, drunk

and when I stepped out into the cool 
moonlight, there was drifting through the watery
end of the meadow, a deer

pale beneath pines, beneath those soaring
darknessess. Then there was only darkness, the 
idea of a deer.

          Remember, I never wanted
to be alive, to have
an outline. Better, I knew, to slip

unheld, an opening into mist. 

With his eyes, and when I slept, 
An angel peeled an orange 
And waited for me to wake up. 
This was  I was ten, small as the flame 
Of a struck match, my lungs fiery 
From hard, wintery play. When I returned home, 
Legs hurting, I placed my hands on the windowsill 
And looked out—clouds dirty as towels 
And geese I have yet to see again 
Darkening the western sky. 

Monsignor, a machine 
Had painted on the eyes of my toy soldier, 
Little dots off-center, 
Almost on his cheeks. Such a cheap toy, 
I drowned him over and over in my bath, 
Drowned him until the painted-on eyes flaked off. 
Then a leg fell off—surge of dirty water 
Sunk him to the bottom. 

I now at this age place hands on the windowsill, 
My eyes nearly on my cheeks, 
My belly with its rising tide. 
There is no angel with an orange at the edge 
Of my bed. There is no soldier 
And the outside, between this living 
And this dying. Monsignor, 
Saintly man of this child's wonderment, 
When will I see the geese again

Alone with our madness and favorite flower 
We see that there really is nothing left to write about. 
Or rather, it is necessary to write about the same old things 
In the same way, repeating the same things over and over 
For love to continue and be gradually different. 

Beehives and ants have to be re-examined eternally 
And the color of the day put in 
Hundreds of times and varied from summer to winter 
For it to get slowed down to the pace of an authentic 
Saraband and huddle there, alive and resting. 

Only then can the chronic inattention 
Of our lives drape itself around us, conciliatory 
And with one eye on those long tan plush shadows 
That speak so deeply into our unprepared knowledge 
Of ourselves, the talking engines of our day. 

The first warm day,   
and by mid-afternoon   
the snow is no more   
than a washing
strewn over the yards,
the bedding rolled in knots   
and leaking water,   
the white shirts lying   
under the evergreens.   
Through the heaviest drifts   
rise autumn's fallen   
bicycles, small carnivals   
of paint and chrome,   
the Octopus
and Tilt-A-Whirl   
beginning to turn
in the sun. Now children,   
stiffened by winter   
and dressed, somehow,   
like old men, mutter   
and bend to the work   
of building dams.
But such a spring is brief;   
by five o'clock
the chill of sundown,   
darkness, the blue TVs   
flashing like storms
in the picture windows,   
the yards gone gray,   
the wet dogs barking   
at nothing. Far off   
across the cornfields
staked for streets and sewers,   
the body of a farmer   
missing since fall
will show up
in his garden tomorrow,   
as unexpected
as a tulip. 

When your guts
are raw with waiting
and your head
is full of s**t. 
take a gin and tonic
and relax a little bit.

When the time
rolls onforever
and you're tired
that you're alone. 
take a gin and tonic
and you'll be a no go zone.

To be awake 
'til morning
not knowing 
what to think. 
take a gin and tonic
and sod the missing link.

Trebles, of course. 

The girl in the green ski chasuble
hasn't yet graduated from radio school.
Let's pay attention.

Looking ahead, why, he waved his mouth along.
Doesn't life get difficult in the summer?
The divine medicine for it collapsed
in front of the shortstop,
who took off like a battalion.

Crowds of older people who would read this
happily, willingly, then walking into night's embrace,
then kiss. "To turn you out, to turn you out!"
Sometimes an arm is accused:
You could have felt it, the blue shirts,
phlegm central, four times a night.
But what does that get me?
Light refreshments.

When the suburban demonstration kind of shrunk
you put your foot out,
leave it or kiss it
or even two years ago,
Charmaine here tells us.
I think I should stay .     

Cross-eyed sonofabitch .     
He liked him, he could tell. A de-happening.
The gangster no longer wanted to sleep with him,
but what the heck. With time off
for actual fuzz collected
All right, boys.
Cheap murders, peach driven
I seen enough of those
samples along the way. 

Love came late
Or, I came late to Love

There I’ve said it.

For years 
I averted my eyes
From lacy Valentines in stores
And bouquets wrapped in cellophane
Tied with pink satin bows

Love was 
a four letter word
Unspoken 
Never dared 
Not even in a whisper
Whispers belonged to lovers

Love Shined
Brightly in the spotlights
On wedding couples dancing
Love Glowed
Softly in the Moonlight
Flickering of candlelight
On tables where
Lovers dined

Love inhabited the fringes
I did not get to hold it
Only brush against it briefly
In the homes of those 
Who had already
Heard it knocking 
On their hearts

I did not look for Love
I did not hide from Love
I did not wait for Love
Perhaps I did not even
Hope for Love

Love came late
Not shouting
Not leaping
Not looking to move mountains
Only tapping softly on my shoulder
As I tapped away
 at my keyboard

Love came late
But bringing with it all 
Love ever had to offer
Asking only 
For my open heart


The print is getting smaller
for each book I try to read.
I squeeze my sight to sharpen
those ever smaller letters, which
recede from my once immediate grasp.
What might I be missing? 
Are there secrets being revealed
that to my eyes are just a jumble
of opaque letters? Are there new
patterns of writing that communicate
between the lines that are just 
a horizontal blur to me? Could people, 
incipient lovers all, have found fresh
emotions, once lodged deep in the heart, 
now displayed openly in a print
that will not reach my hungry heart
because my sight is empty? How can I swell
my gaze to encompass such new wonders? 
Or is this simply another betrayal
of time against the aging mind, still agile
enough to sustain desire but weakening 
every moment its grasp of fleeting things

Not soon, as late as the approach of my ninetieth year,
I felt a door opening in me and I entered
the clarity of early morning.

One after another my former lives were departing,
like ships, together with their sorrow.

And the countries, cities, gardens, the bays of seas
assigned to my brush came closer,
ready now to be described better than they were before.

I was not separated from people,
grief and pity joined us.
We forget - I kept saying - that we are all children of the King.

For where we come from there is no division
into Yes and No, into is, was, and will be.

We were miserable, we used no more than a hundredth part
of the gift we received for our long journey.

Moments from yesterday and from centuries ago -
a sword blow, the painting of eyelashes before a mirror
of polished metal, a lethal musket shot, a caravel
staving its hull against a reef - they dwell in us,
waiting for a fulfillment.

I knew, always, that I would be a worker in the vineyard,
as are all men and women living at the same time,
whether they are aware of it or not. 

Late winter snow gains impact
through element of surprise 
and potential disappointment
burying, as it may, 
the tender shoots of spring

Stepping on the toes
of springs first warming rain
the sudden return of snowflakes
guarantees a thicker flocking
on every branch and twig
Night’s chill will seal this fluff
like crystallizing sugar sets cake frosting

I would rather dream of green
buds on trees and shoots of flowers
spared swaddle beneath snow’s blanket

Such choice will not be given
Snow falls, snowfalls
till winter discerns its end


The moon drained white by day 
lifts from the hill 
where the old pear-tree fallen in storm 
springs up in blossom still. 
Women believe in the moon: 
this branch I hold 
is not more white and still than she 
whose flower is ages old, 
and so I carry home 
flowers from the pear 
that makes such obstinate tokens still 
for fruit it cannot bear. 

The paddocks shave black
with a foam of smoke that stays,
welling out of red-black wounds.
 
In the white of a drought
this happens.  The hardcourt game.
Logs that fume are mostly cattle,
 
inverted, stubby.  Tree stumps are kilns.
Walloped, wiped, hand-pumped,
even this day rolls over, slowly.
 
At dusk, a family drives sheep 
out through the yellow
of the Aboriginal flag.★ Late Swallow




Hundred birds have fed their babies at the breast
But only an autumn swallow idles away
Near comes She Day
Why does it hold the mud in its mouth? 
Doesn’t think the season is late
Lashes the waves
Everything on earth is same
Not only swallow nests


Something this foggy day, a something which 
Is neither of this fog nor of today, 
Has set me dreaming of the winds that play 
Past certain cliffs, along one certain beach, 
And turn the topmost edge of waves to spray: 
Ah pleasant pebbly strand so far away, 
So out of reach while quite within my reach, 
As out of reach as India or Cathay! 
I am sick of where I am and where I am not, 
I am sick of foresight and of memory, 
I am sick of all I have and all I see, 
I am sick of self, and there is nothing new; 
Oh weary impatient patience of my lot! 
Thus with myself: how fares it, Friends, with you

My death will arrive one day,
It may be a bright, spring dawn,
It may be a distant winter dusk,
Or perhaps a silent night-
of a foggy, frozen fall.
 
That day,
gloomy, bright or cloudy, yet,
it will be an empty day-
like all the rest:
a figment of the future,
a picture of  the past.
 
That day,
My eyes like dark holes,
My face like cold marbles;
I’ll be taken away in a swift sleep,
leaving behind my colorful dreams.
 
My hands will fall on the pallor of a page,
My rhyming thoughts will flee from their cage,
My mind losing to the vibration of this last verse;
And then, there will be no sorrow, no pain-
no rage.
 
 
The Earth,
incessantly calling my name,
so they will arrive to place me inside the grave.
Oh, perhaps my lovers, at all midnights-
will put some flowers on my lone place.
 
Then,
the thick shades of my world-
will be suddenly pulled away:
In the full moon-light, one night-
strangers will read on my rhymes-
 
They will step in my little room,
a sunny day, in my memory.
Next to my mirror yet, they will find
a lock of my hair,
the signs of life-
my fingerprints.
 
My soul,
like a sailboat,
It will escape,
free of myself and missing from my corpse.
I will fade away at the borders of sight,
like a vagabond kite,
in an endless flight.
 
Days so quickly get to weeks,
And weeks become months as fast;
You’ll stare into eyes of the clock,
waiting in vain my letters, my calls.
 
But then,
My lifeless body will calmly rest-
far from you and the pounds of your heart-
in the voiceless arms of Mother Earth.
 
Later on,
The sun, the wind and the rain,
will polish the cold stone of my grave:
And lastly I'll be free-
forever free-
from the myths of return,
name and fame.
 
 


Beneath this slab
John Brown is stowed.
He watched the ads
And not the road.


This game is the way in which slaughter becomes an end in itself.
 
Acta est fabula plaudite
The play has been performed; applaud! 

Surely, less obvious ways exist
The Darkness seeks to manipulate us into its service.


Actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea.
The act is not guilty unless the mind is also guilty.


Once all of them  have won a very special princess prize, 
the game is over
and they will never buy another one.

Alis grave nil.
Nothing is heavy to those who have wings

And maybe we cannot understand what's going on, 
but we can understand  that the players
skillfully hide behind the walls
They think

Cessante ratione legis cessat ipsa lex.
When the reason for the law ceases, the law itself ceases.


We seek escape from reality, we undermine our self-esteem.
Maybe we are unable to see them, but we need to talk about this.
And maybe they do not trust us when we tell them to come to us if they need
to talk
. . 

about those who become  their victims.  


Sed ipse Spiritus postulat pro nobis, gemitibus inenarrabilibus.
But the same Spirit intercedes incessantly for us, with inexpressible groans. 

It has dawned 
– seen by the light 
that peeped through the window! 

It made the darkness 
to become more darker 
by the blanket pulled over! 

At that moment only, 
the eyelids close to sleep
the eyeballs drowse and dance! 

The mobile phones
that arose the alarm
are kept out of reach away! 

The pleasant sleep 
swallows 
the ruminating thoughts! 

For getting the morning wishes, 
Searches and waits - 
– the heart! 

Woke up and looked up! 
The clock which was lying on the wall
by looking at me said sarcastically, 

‘He would have forgotten you, but
You are only ‘revolving him round and round’
like me!(After Horace)

Let others praise, as fancy wills,
Berlin beneath her trees,
Or Rome upon her seven hills,
Or Venice by her seas;
Stamboul by double tides embraced,
Or green Damascus in the waste.

For me there's nought I would not leave
For the good Devon land,
Whose orchards down the echoing cleeve
Bedewed with spray-drift stand,
And hardly bear the red fruit up
That shall be next year's cider-cup.

You too, my friend, may wisely mark
How clear skies follow rain,
And, lingering in your own green park
Or drilled on Laffan's Plain,
Forget not with the festal bowl
To soothe at times your weary soul.

When Drake must bid to Plymouth Hoe
Good-bye for many a day,
And some were sad and feared to go,
And some that dared not stay,
Be sure he bade them broach the best,
And raised his tankard with the rest.

'Drake's luck to all that sail with Drake
For promised lands of gold!
Brave lads, whatever storms may break,
We've weathered worse of old!
To-night the loving-cup we'll drain,
To-morrow for the Spanish Main!


'Laughter, 
Best medicine, 
Happy life! 

Laugh Laugh Laugh, 
Don't take the strain into heart, 
Lead a happy life! 

Laugh out loudly, 
Don't give chance for others to laugh,  
Lead a contented life! 

Laughter is the quality, 
Offered only to the mankind 
Who thinks what is right

There was a high majestic fooling 
Day before yesterday in the yellow corn. 

And day after to-morrow in the yellow corn 
There will be high majestic fooling. 

The ears ripen in late summer 
And come on with a conquering laughter, 
Come on with a high and conquering laughter. 

The long-tailed blackbirds are hoarse. 
One of the smaller blackbirds chitters on a stalk 
And a spot of red is on its shoulder 
And I never heard its name in my life. 

Some of the ears are bursting. 
A white juice works inside. 
Cornsilk creeps in the end and dangles in the wind. 
Always--I never knew it any other way-- 
The wind and the corn talk things over together. 
And the rain and the corn and the sun and the corn 
Talk things over together. 

Over the road is the farmhouse. 
The siding is white and a green blind is slung loose. 
It will not be fixed till the corn is husked. 
The farmer and his wife talk things over together. 

This scientist you see  
Almost got a Nobel Prize  
She invented a laughing gun for free  
Took everyone by surprise.   
 
Carrying, she claims if you shoot the gun  
Everyone will laugh, love and only have fun  
She asks us to try, in neighboring countries of the world,  
She is sure the gun, with an angry mob, would work.  
 
It has to be first approved by all clever men  
What a silly gun this is, before our wit and acumen!  
Counter-attacked the wise, try it must we should  
Let us see her craft if it's of any good.  
If so much was invested inventing tear gun  
That had over the years, made people flee and cry.  
Why don't we give this d*mn just a little try?  
Okayed was it for some willy-nilly fun.  
 
There's running there a bitter angry mob  
She shot just once, that crafty little knob.  
Grounded and stunned to see what they saw  
It turned into a stage with everyone in awe!  
Their anger ran away they were laughing all in one  
The silenced audience saw the drama with the gun.  
All were shaking hands, the mob and the cop  
Happy were they all from the bottom to the top.  
 
Days passed. The lab where she invented the gun?  
No trace. No mark. All over, all were done.  
She was tried in court as the story goes. Fled and went on the run.  
Her tears kept rolling on and on, without a tear gun.  
 
Hush! She's now not alone, is with her little child  
Trying laugh guns in the wind; are out in the wild. 

If I were gusty April now, 
How I would blow at laughing Rose; 
I'd make her ribbons slip their knots, 
And all her hair come loose.

If I were merry April now, 
How I would pelt her cheeks with showers; 
I'd make carnations, rich and warm, 
Of her vermillion flowers.

Since she will laugh in April's face 
No matter how he rains or blows -- 
Then O that I wild April were, 
To play with laughing Rose. 

When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy,
 And the dimpling stream runs laughing by;
 When the air does laugh with our merry wit,
 And the green hill laughs with the noise of it;
 
 when the meadows laugh with lively green,
 And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene,
 When Mary and Susan and Emily
 With their sweet round mouths sing 'Ha, ha he!'
 
 When the painted birds laugh in the shade,
 Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread:
 Come live, and be merry, and join with me,
 To sing the sweet chorus of 'Ha, ha, he!


'Laughing Tears

When you're born, you cry.
When you're a kid, you cry.
When you're grown, you cry.
When you're old, you cry.
When you're dead, they cry.
But you're dead, so it doesn't matter why.
My tears are enough.  'GOODBYE, GOODBYE! '

When you're born, you laugh.
When you're a kid, you laugh.
When you're grown, you laugh.
When you're old, you laugh.
When you're dead, they laugh.
But they're not in the will.
I ask, 'How do you laugh so still? 'I Laugh at Life: its antics make for me a giddy games,
Where only foolish fellows take themselves with solemn aim.
I laugh at pomp and vanity, at riches, rank and pride;
At social inanity, at swager, swank and side.
At poets, pastry-cooks and kings, at folk sublime and small,
Who fuss about a thousand things that matter not at all;
At those who dream of name and fame, at those who scheme for pelf. . . .
But best of all the laughing game - is laughing at myself.

I see myself a charlatan, a humbug and a fraud.
Yea, 'spite of show and shallow wit, an sentimental drool,
I know myself a hypocrite, a coward and a fool.
And though I kick myself with glee profoundly on the pants,
I'm little worse, it seems to me, than other human ants.
For if you probe your private mind, impervious to shame,
Oh, Gentle Reader, you may find you're much about the same.

Then let us mock with ancient mirth this comic, cosmic plan;
For laughter is a buckler bright, and scorn a shining spear;
So let us laugh with all our might at folly, fraud and fear.
Yet on our sorry selves be spent our most sardonic glee.
Oh don't pay life a compliment to take is seriously.
For he who can himself despise, be surgeon to the bone,
May win to worth in others' eyes, to wisdom in his own. 

Born out of joy
Jovial moments are captured
By the wavering laughter
Bursting out of a happy heart
With hands full of joy
A child of love
Laughter


I believe, in placing ones family first. 
I believe that many successful people, 
leave in their path, countless orphans 
of success. 

I believe, when the sickness is sadness, 
laughter is the cure. 

I believe, that a good work ethic, can 
serve all of us well. 

I believe in good wine and good friends. 
I believe, in a time each day, to give thanks. 
I believe in forgiveness. 
I believe, if one can forgive a friend, 
then surely, one can forgive family. 

I believe in the power of the written word. 
I still believe in hand written letters. 
I believe the first cup of coffee in the 
morning, is the best. 


Of beast or fish or bird, though no sad doubt  
Of their futurity to them unfurled  
Has dared to check the mirth-compelling shout.  
The lion roars his solemn thunder out  
To the sleeping woods. The eagle screams her cry.  
Even the lark must strain a serious throat  
To hurl his blest defiance at the sky.  
Fear, anger, jealousy, have found a voice.  
Love’s pain or rapture the brute bosoms swell.
Nature has symbols for her nobler joys,  
Her nobler sorrows. Who had dared foretell  
That only man, by some sad mockery,  
Should learn to laugh who learns that he must die

As the Sun withdrew his rays from the garden, and the moon threw cushioned beams upon the flowers, I sat under the trees pondering upon the phenomena of the atmosphere, looking through the branches at the strewn stars which glittered like chips of silver upon a blue carpet; and I could hear from a distance the agitated murmur of the rivulet singing its way briskly into the valley. 

When the birds took shelter among the boughs, and the flowers folded their petals, and tremendous silence descended, I heard a rustle of feet though the grass. I took heed and saw a young couple approaching my arbor. The say under a tree where I could see them without being seen. 

After he looked about in every direction, I heard the young man saying, "Sit by me, my beloved, and listen to my heart; smile, for your happiness is a symbol of our future; be merry, for the sparkling days rejoice with us. 

"My soul is warning me of the doubt in your heart, for doubt in love is a sin. "Soon you will be the owner of this vast land, lighted by this beautiful moon; soon you will be the mistress of my palace, and all the servants and maids will obey your commands. 

"Smile, my beloved, like the gold smiles from my father's coffers. 

"My heart refuses to deny you its secret. Twelve months of comfort and travel await us; for a year we will spend my father's gold at the blue lakes of Switzerland, and viewing the edifices of Italy and Egypt, and resting under the Holy Cedars of Lebanon; you will meet the princesses who will envy you for your jewels and clothes. 

"All these things I will do for you; will you be satisfied?" 

In a little while I saw them walking and stepping on flowers as the rich step upon the hearts of the poor. As they disappeared from my sight, I commenced to make comparison between love and money, and to analyze their position in the heart. 

Money! The source of insincere love; the spring of false light and fortune; the well of poisoned water; the desperation of old age! 

I was still wandering in the vast desert of contemplation when a forlorn and specter-like couple passed by me and sat on the grass; a young man and a young woman who had left their farming shacks in the nearby fields for this cool and solitary place. 

After a few moments of complete silence, I heard the following words uttered with sighs from weather-bitten lips, "Shed not tears, my beloved; love that opens our eyes and enslaves our hearts can give us the blessing of patience. Be consoled in our delay our delay, for we have taken an oath and entered Love's shrine; for our love will ever grow in adversity; for it is in Love's name that we are suffering the obstacles of poverty and the sharpness of misery and the emptiness of separation. I shall attack these hardships until I triumph and place in your hands a strength that will help over all things to complete the journey of life. 

 


A pure voice, combined of the consuming flame of love, and the hopeless bitterness of longing and the resolved sweetness of patience, said, "Good-bye, my beloved
 


They separated, and the elegy to their union was smothered by the wails of my crying heart. 

I looked upon slumbering Nature, and with deep reflection discovered the reality of a vast and infinite thing -- something no power could demand, influence acquire, nor riches purchase. Nor could it be effaced by the tears of time or deadened by sorrow; a thing which cannot be discovered by the blue lakes of Switzerland or the beautiful edifices of Italy. 

It is something that gathers strength with patience, grows despite obstacles, warms in winter, flourishes in spring, casts a breeze in summer, and bears fruit in autumn -- I found Love. 

Ay, thou varlet! Laugh away!
All the world's a holiday!
Laugh away, and roar and shout
Till thy hoarse tongue lolleth out!
Bloat thy cheeks, and bulge thine eyes
Unto bursting; pelt thy thighs
With thy swollen palms, and roar
As thou never hast before!
Lustier! Wilt thou! Peal on peal!
Stiflest? Squat and grind thy heel--
Wrestle with thy loins, and then
Wheeze thee whiles, and whoop again

In the South lies a lonesome, hungry Land;
He huddles his rags with a cripple's hand;
He mutters, prone on the barren sand,
    What time his heart is breaking.

He lifts his bare head from the ground;
He listens through the gloom around:
The winds have brought him a strange sound
    Of distant merrymaking.

Comes now the Peace so long delayed?
Is it the cheerful voice of Aid?
Begins the time his heart has prayed,
    When men may reap and sow?

The sages chuckle o'er their jest;
Must they, to give a people rest,
    Their dainty wit forego?

The tyrants sit in a stately hall;
They jibe at a wretched people's fall;
The tyrants forget how fresh is the pall
    Over their dead and ours.

Look how the senators ape the clown,
And don the motley and hide the gown,
But yonder a fast-rising frown
    On the people's forehead lowers. 

Laughter's infectious
It makes you smile
It makes you cry
I believe 
It's a natural high


Flashed upon the contrite Rama glimpses of the dawning truth,
And with tears of love paternal Rama clasped each minstrel youth,

Yearned his sorrow-stricken bosom for his pure and peerless dame,
Sita banished to the forest, stainless in her righteous fame!

In his tears repentant Rama to Valmiki message sent,
That his heart with eager longing sought her from her banishment:

'Pure in soul! before these monarchs may she yet her virtue prove,
Grace once more my throne and kingdom, share my unforgotten love,

Pure in soul! before my subjects may her truth and virtue shine,


'Life's dangers, Life's drama, 
A violet field, A panorama, 
Spell blinding, fiery ball.
Gliding on horizon fall.
Endless rows, 
Lavender grows
Fragrant flowers
Floating high like towers, 
Dusky skies, moving slowly, 
Nature's scene, calming, Holy. 

The lovely young Lavinia once had friends;
And fortune smiled deceitful on her birth:
For, in her helpless years deprived of all,
Of every stay, save innocence and Heaven,
She, with her widow'd mother, feeble, old,
And poor, lived in a cottage, far retired
Among the windings of a woody vale; 
By solitude and deep-surrounding shades,
But more by bashful modesty, conceal'd.
Together thus they shunn'd the cruel scorn
Which virtue, sunk to poverty, would meet
From giddy passion and low-minded pride; 
Almost on Nature's common bounty fed,
Like the gay birds that sung them to repose,
Content, and careless of to-morrow's fare.
Her form was fresher than the morning rose,
When the dew wets its leaves; unstain'd and pure,
As is the lily or the mountain snow.
The modest virtues mingled in her eyes,
Still on the ground dejected, darting all
Their humid means into the blooming flowers;
Or when the mournful tale her mother told
Of what her faithless fortune promised once,
Thrill'd in her thought, they like the dewy star
Of evening, shone in tears. A native grace
Sat fair-proportion'd on her polish'd limbs,
Veil'd in a simple robe, their best attire,
Beyond the pomp of dress; for loveliness
Needs not the foreign aid of ornament,
But is, when unadorn'd, adorn'd the most. 
Thoughtless of beauty, she was beauty's self,
Recluse amid the close-embowering woods:
As in the hollow breast of Apennine,
Beneath the shelter of encircling hills,
A myrtle rises, far from human eye,
And breathes its balmy fragrance o'er the wild;
So flourish'd, blooming, and unseen by all,
The sweet Lavinia. 

If I am a dictator, 
Or a powerful preacher, 
Even, a democratic leader, 
And I am instrumental in legislature, 
And I am responsible of framing or continuing a law, 
That has an element of flaw, 
It is in violation to equity, 
And I am ignorant of the reality, 
And I have made many decisions on the basis of necessity, 
I have taken many actions in my own capacity, 
And there is a law against the principles of natural justice, 
And I don't take any action against this malice, 
For humanity I am not doing any service, 
I'm not doing anything for the real justice. 

Lawrence, my grand hometown down by the Kaw
Oh, how I love her beauty and her lights
As, once over Pleasent Grove, I behold
The dorms of KU's campus lit up bright

I love the people who take pride in her
How when asked who the best was
MJ doesn't always trump Simien
But, most of all, I love Lawrence because. 

She took time to nurture a Kansas boy like me



See love with heart
Feel love with care
Taste love with life
Whisper love in dreams
Plot love in solitude
Hug love with faith

Glimpse love with devotion
Never expect it in return
Never hurt love as a stampede
Never cage it to feed
Embrace with full heart
Live to love with heart
So that love hug love always


And he answered: 

You delight in laying down laws, 

Yet you delight more in breaking them. 

Like children playing by the ocean who build sand-towers with constancy and then destroy them with laughter. 

But while you build your sand-towers the ocean brings more sand to the shore, 

And when you destroy them, the ocean laughs with you. 

Verily the ocean laughs always with the innocent. 

But what of those to whom life is not an ocean, and man-made laws are not sand-towers, 

But to whom life is a rock, and the law a chisel with which they would carve it in their own likeness? 

What of the cripple who hates dancers? 

What of the ox who loves his yoke and deems the elk and deer of the forest stray and vagrant things? 

What of the old serpent who cannot shed his skin, and calls all others naked and shameless? 

And of him who comes early to the wedding-feast, and when over-fed and tired goes his way saying that all feasts are violation and all feasters law-breakers? 

What shall I say of these save that they too stand in the sunlight, but with their backs to the sun? 

They see only their shadows, and their shadows are their laws. 

And what is the sun to them but a caster of shadows? 

And what is it to acknowledge the laws but to stoop down and trace their shadows upon the earth? 

But you who walk facing the sun, what images drawn on the earth can hold you? 

You who travel with the wind, what weathervane shall direct your course? 

What man's law shall bind you if you break your yoke but upon no man's prison door? 

What laws shall you fear if you dance but stumble against no man's iron chains? 

And who is he that shall bring you to judgment if you tear off your garment yet leave it in no man's path? 

People of Orphalese, you can muffle the drum, and you can loosen the strings of the lyre, but who shall command the skylark not to sing

When the jury files in to deliver a verdict after weeks of direct and cross examinations, hot clashes 
of lawyers and cool decisions of the judge, 
There are points of high silence--twiddling of thumbs is at an end--bailiffs near cuspidors take fresh 
chews of tobacco and wait--and the clock has a chance for its ticking to be heard. 
A lawyer for the defense clears his throat and holds himself ready if the word is "Guilty" to enter 
motion for a new trial, speaking in a soft voice, speaking in a voice slightly colored with bitter wrongs 
mingled with monumental patience, speaking with mythic Atlas shoulders of many preposterous, 
unjust circumstances. 

Anguish peeks around the corner looking to excite your mind 
Trouble lurks in the ceiling, waiting for it’s chance to pounce
Punishment is inevitable and depression is the only cure
But with a kiss of relaxation your troubles burrows away, 
Anguish evades you, hoping to never see brilliance
Though punishment is there, it’s a little sweeter than before
Anxiety never enters inside you because my Lax Kiss
Will always be here when you need it. 

We redeth oft and findeth ywrite -   
And this clerkes wele it wite -
Layes that ben in harping
Ben yfounde of ferli thing.
Sum bethe of wer and sum of wo,
And sum of joie and mirthe also,
And sum of trecherie and of gile,
Of old aventours that fel while;   
And sum of bourdes and ribaudy,
And mani ther beth of fairy.

When kinges might our yhere
Of ani mervailes that ther were,

And maked a lay and gaf it name.
Now of this aventours that weren yfalle,
Y can tel sum ac nought alle.
Ac herkneth lordinges, sothe to sain,

Whereof was made Lay le Frain.

Of an asche for sothe it is;   
On ensaumple fair with alle

In the west cuntre woned tuay knightes,   
And loved hem wele in al rightes;
Riche men in her best liif,
And aither of hem hadde wedded wiif.
That o knight made his levedi milde
That sche was wonder gret with childe.
And when hir time was comen tho,
She was deliverd out of wo.
And cleped his messanger an hight.
'Go,' he seyd, 'to mi neighebour swithe,
And say y gret him fele sithe,
And pray him that he com to me,
And say he schal mi gossibbe be.'   
The messanger goth, and hath nought forgete,
And fint the knight at his mete.
And fair he gret in the halle
The lord, the levedi, the meyne alle.
And seththen on knes doun him sett,
'He bad that thou schust to him te,
And for love his gossibbe be.'
'Is his levedi deliverd with sounde?'
'And whether a maidenchild other a knave?'
The knight therof was glad and blithe,
And graunted his erand in al thing,
And gaf him a palfray for his tiding.   
   Than was the levedi of the hous
A proude dame and an envieous,   
Hokerfulliche missegging,
Squeymous and eke scorning.
To ich woman sche hadde envie;
Sche spac this wordes of felonie:
'Ich have wonder, thou messanger,
Who was thi lordes conseiler,
To teche him about to send
And telle schame in ich an ende,   
That his wiif hath to childer ybore.   
Wele may ich man wite therfore
That tuay men hir han hadde in bour;
That is hir bothe deshonour.' The messanger was sore aschamed;
The knight himself was sore agramed,
To speke ani woman vilaynie.
And ich woman therof might here   
Curssed hir alle yfere,
For His holy name seven

And deliverd al with sounde.
To maidenchilder sche hadde ybore.
When hye it wist, wo hir was therefore.
'Allas,' sche seyd, 'that this hap come!

Forboden bite ich woman   
To speken ani other harm opon.
Falsliche another y gan deme;
The selve happe is on me sene.

And sle mi childe, and do penaunce.'   
Hir midwiif hye cleped hir to:   
'Anon,' sche seyd, 'this child fordo.
And ever say thou wher thou go
That ich have o child and namo.'
The midwiif answerd thurchout al
That hye nil, no hye ne schal. [The levedi hadde a maiden fre,   
Who ther ynurtured hade ybe,
And fostered fair ful mony a yere;
Sche saw her kepe this sori chere,
And wepe, and syke, and crye, 'Alas!'
And thoghte to helpen her in this cas.
And thus sche spake, this maiden ying,
'So n'olde y wepen for no kind thing: But this o child wol I of-bare
And in a covent leve it yare.
Ne schalt thou be aschamed at al;
And whoso findeth this childe smal,

The levedi graunted anon therto,
And wold wele that it were ydo.
Sche toke a riche baudekine   
That hir lord brought from Costentine   
And lapped the litel maiden therin,
And toke a ring of gold fin,
And on hir right arm it knitt,

And whoso hir founde schuld have in mende

And on knes sche sat adoun,
And seyd wepeand her orisoun:

For Marie love, thi moder fre.'
   Hye loked up and bi hir seighe
An asche bi hir fair and heighe,   
Wele ybowed, of michel priis;
The bodi was holow as mani on is.
Therin sche leyd the child for cold,
In the pel as it was bifold,
And blisced it with al hir might.
With that it gan to dawe light.
The foules up and song on bough,
And acremen yede to the plough.
The maiden turned ogain anon,
And toke the waye he hadde er gon.
   The porter of the abbay aros,
And dede his ofice in the clos,
Rong the belles and taperes light,
Leyd forth bokes and al redi dight.

And seighe anon in the stede

And thought wele that it might be
That theves hadde yrobbed sumwhare,
And gon ther forth and lete it thare.

And the maidenchild therin he fond.
He tok it up betwen his hond,   
And thonked Jesu Cristes sond;
And hom to his hous he it brought,
And tok it his douhter and hir bisought

For sche was melche and couthe theran.
For it was neighe ded for cold.

And warmed it wele aplight.
And sethen laid it to slepe warm.
And when the masse was ydon,

Sone after the first stounde,
A litel maidenchild ich founde
In the holwe assche ther out,
And a pel him about.
A ring of gold also was there.
Hou it com thider y not nere.'
The abbesse was awonderd of this thing.
'Go,' hye seyd, 'on heighing,
And feche it hider, y pray the.
Ichil it help as y can
And sigge it is mi kinswoman.'   
The porter anon it gan forth bring
With the pal and with the ring.
The abbesse lete clepe a prest anon,
And lete it cristin in funston.
And for it was in an asche yfounde,
Sche cleped it Frain in that stounde.
(The Freyns of the 'asche' is a freyn   
After the language of Breteyn;
Forthe Le Frein men clepeth this lay   
More than Asche in ich cuntray).
   This Frein thrived fram yer to yer.
The abbesse nece men wend it were.
The abbesse hir gan teche and beld.   
Bi that hye was of twelve winter eld,
In al Inglond ther nas non
A fairer maiden than hye was on.
And when hye couthe ought of manhed,   
Hye bad the abbesse hir wis and rede
Whiche were her kin, on or other,
Fader or moder, soster or brother.
The abbesse hir in conseyl toke,
To tellen hir hye nought forsoke,
Hou hye was founden in al thing,
And tok hir the cloth and the ring,
And bad hir kepe it in that stede;
And ther whiles sche lived so sche dede.
   Than was ther in that cuntre
A riche knight of lond and fe,
Proud and yong and jolive,
And had nought yete ywedded wive.
He was stout, of gret renoun,
And was ycleped Sir Guroun.
He herd praise that maiden fre,
And seyd he wald hir se.
He dight him in the way anon,
And joliflich thider he come;   
And bad his man sigge verrament

The abbesse and the nonnes alle
Fair him gret in the gest halle,
And damisel Freyn, so hende of mouth,
Gret him faire as hye wele couthe;
And swithe wele he gan devise   
Her semblaunt and her gentrise,
Her lovesum eighen, her rode so bright,
And comced to love hir anon right,
And thought hou he might take on
To have hir to his leman.
He thought, 'Yif ich com hir to
More than ichave ydo,
The abbesse wil souchy gile
And voide hir in a litel while.'
He compast another enchesoun:
To be brother of that religioun. 'Madame,' he seyd to the abbesse,
'Y lovi wele in al godenisse,   
Ichil give on and other,
Londes and rentes, to bicom your brother,
That ye schul ever fare the bet
When y com to have recet.'
At few wordes thai ben at on.
He graythes him and forth is gon.
Oft he come bi day and night
To speke with that maiden bright.
So that with his fair bihest,
And with his gloseing atte lest,
Hye graunted him to don his wille
When he wil, loude and stille.
'Leman,' he seyd, 'thou most lat be
The abbesse, thi nece, and go with me.
For icham riche, of swich pouwere,   
The finde bet than thou hast here.' The maiden grant, and to him trist,   
And stale oway that no man wist.
With hir tok hye no thing
Bot hir pel and hir ring.
   When the abbesse gan aspie
That hye was with the knight owy,
Sche made morning in hir thought,
And hir biment and gained nought.
So long sche was in his castel
That al his meyne loved hir wel.
To riche and pouer sche gan hir dresse,
That al hir loved, more and lesse.
And thus sche lad with him hir liif
Right as sche hadde ben his wedded wiif.
   His knightes com and to him speke,   
And Holy Chirche comandeth eke,
Sum lordes douhter for to take,
And his leman al forsake;
And seyd him were wel more feir
In wedlok to geten him an air
Than lede his liif with swiche on
Of was kin he knewe non.
And seyd, 'Here bisides is a knight
That hath a douhter fair and bright
That schal bere his hiritage;
Taketh hir in mariage!'
Loth him was that dede to do,
Ac atte last he graunt therto.
   The forward was ymaked aright,
And were at on, and treuthe plight.
Allas, that he no hadde ywite,   
Er the forward were ysmite
That hye and his leman also
Sostren were and twinnes to!   
Of o fader bigeten thai were,
Of o moder born yfere.
That hye so ware nist non,
   The newe bride was grayd with alle
And brought hom to the lordes halle.
Hir fader com with hir, also
The levedi, hir moder, and other mo.
The bischop of the lond withouten fail
Com to do the spusseayl.

Le Codre sche was yhight.   


And sayd to Sir Guroun joyfully:
'Fairer maiden nas never seen,   
Better than Ash is Hazle y ween!'
(For in Romaunce Le Frain 'ash' is,
And Le Codre 'hazle,' y-wis.)
   A gret fest than gan they hold   
With gle and pleasaunce manifold.
And mo than al servauntes, the maid,
Yhight Le Frain, as servant sped.
Albe her herte wel nigh tobroke,
No word of pride ne grame she spoke.
The levedi marked her simple chere,   
And gan to love her, wonder dere.
Scant could sche feel more pine or reuth
War it hir owen childe in sooth.
Than to the bour the damsel sped,
Whar graithed was the spousaile bed;
Sche demed it was ful foully dight,
And yll besemed a may so bright;   
So to her coffer quick she cam,
And her riche baudekyn out nam,
Which from the abbesse sche had got;   
Fayrer mantel nas ther not;
And deftly on the bed it layd;
Her lord would thus be well apayd.
Le Codre and her mother, thare,
Ynsame unto the bour gan fare,
But whan the levedi that mantyll seighe,
Sche wel neighe swoned oway.
The chamberleynt sche cleped tho,
But he wist of it no mo.
Then came that hendi maid Le Frain,
And the levedi gan to her sain,
And asked whose mantyll it ware.
Then answered that maiden fair:
'It is mine without lesing;
Y had it together with this ringe.
Myne aunte tolde me a ferli cas
Hou in this mantyll yfold I was,
And hadde upon mine arm this ring,
Whanne I was ysent to norysching.'
   Then was the levedi astonied sore:
'Fair child! My doughter, y the bore!'
Sche swoned and was wel neighe ded,
And lay sikeand on that bed.
Her husbond was fet tho,
And sche told him al her wo,
Hou of her neighbour sche had missayn,
For sche was delyvered of childre twain;
And hou to children herself sche bore;
'And that o child I of sent thore,
In a convent yfostered to be;   
And this is sche, our doughter free;
And this is the mantyll, and this the ring
You gaf me of yore as a love-tokening.'
   The knight kissed his daughter hende   
Oftimes, and to the bisschop wende:
And he undid the mariage strate,
And weddid Sir Guroun alsgate
To Le Frain, his leman, so fair and hend.
With them Le Codre away did wend,
And sone was spousyd with game and gle,
To a gentle knight of that countre.
Thus ends the lay of tho maidens bright,
Le Frain and Le Codre yhight.]Lay your body close to mine
Let me hold you firmly tight, 
Lay your head on my shoulder 
Cry your tears inside my heart, 
I’ll dry them with my love
An’ change them into smiles.
I lost that game of love 
An’ just quietly stepped aside, 
I knew that guy would do you wrong 
What he said was just old lies, 
Could feel and see it 
In those dark conniving eyes.
Anger is an honest emotion
Let your feelings flow, 
I love you; just want you to be happy.
If ever you see me in another light
I’ll be there for you baby, 
Shining diamond bright, 
Close your eyes now darling
No more tears in the night. 

The ozone layer 
So thin that we can die
In the next few years. 

Keep turning corners to new streets
Till you are convinced there is no end
Keep peeling the layers of this city
To the unreachable core of it all
Navigate skyscrapers like giants
Sweeping aside forests of maise
Or dig with rodent viscosity
Through the deepest tunnel levels
Speak to a New Yorker and find
Layers of suffering locked away
Then look up above tower tips
To a shifting illusion of sky
You are here, right now, alive
In the greatest city on earth
But it gives you nothing easy
And you are just at the surface


Laying next to you, 
Hearing you breathe, 
Watching you suffer, 
Watching the blood tears run down your face, 
I can’t wash away your pain, 
You can’t wash away my endless sorrows, 
Laying next you feel as if I was laying down alone, 
Watching you walk away, 
Watching you leave out of my life, 
It hurts me inside, 
My endless sorrows made me cry, 
I try hard to not show it, 
To show what you mean to me, 
Laying next to you makes me feel all warm inside, 
Just talking to you makes me have butterflies in my stomach, 
Just watching you smile makes me smile, 
Just watching you fade away makes me wanna hurt myself, 
One thing I ever wanted in life was you. 

laying the bright words end to end, 
could we get out of here and when
the exit's stuffed with snows? the things

you said all summer froze.
moon shot yesterdays piled up on the stoop, 
with the milk bottles, 

the half thawed cream.

and the dream upon dream is 
you, in old newsprint, scuttling
through odd neighborhods, 

units, brownstones 
of the living and the dead; 
looking everywhere for

a thing you said in Spring.
it will disappear on Monday
into the sere scrub

leaving, of all you loved, a single spark; 
and in the dark-
the forge of a language

locked and shuttered here
by the hunched bodegas.
and children with their candies skip

where once mute angels stood: 
their arms - folded. 
the vapor rising near the fire escapes

and you are done with surmising.

oh how will you get up to sing
you ask them but they never know
all that cold awnings, dawnings bring

when what was said
to the cindered wind
keeps dread on the payroll, 

in a hotel room
above the alley
where poor men poke for bottles;
making love in the sun
making love by a carpet redder than our blood,
making love while the boys sell headlines
and Cadillacs,
making love by a photograph of Paris
and an open pack of Chesterfields,
making love while other men- poor folks-
work.
That moment- to this. . .
may be years in the way they measure,
but it's only one sentence back in my mind-
there are so many days
when living stops and pulls up and sits
and waits like a train on the rails.
I pass the hotel at and at  there are cats in the alleys
and bottles and bums,
and I look up at the window and think,
I no longer know where you are,
and I walk on and wonder where
the living goes
when it stops. 

The day was wet, the rain fell souse
Like jars of strawberry jam,  a
sound was heard in the old henhouse,
A beating of a hammer. 
Of stalwart form, and visage warm,
Two youths were seen within it,
Splitting up an old tree into perches for their poultry
At a hundred strokes  a minute. 
The work is done, the hen has taken
Possession of her nest and eggs,
Without a thought of eggs and bacon, 
(Or I am very much mistaken happy) 
She turns over each shell,
To be sure that all's well,
Looks into the straw
To see there's no flaw,
Goes once round the house, 
Half afraid of a mouse,
Then sinks calmly to rest
On the top of her nest,
First doubling up each of her legs. 
Time rolled away, and so did every shell,
'Small by degrees and beautifully less,'
As the large mother with a powerful spell 
Forced each in turn its contents to express, 
But ah! 'imperfect is expression,'
Some poet said, I don't care who,
If you want to know you must go elsewhere,
One fact I can tell, if you're willing to hear,
He never attended a Parliament Session,
For I'm certain that if he had ever been there,
Full quickly would he have changed his ideas,
With the hissings, the hootings, the groans and the cheers. 
And as to his name it is pretty clear
That it wasn't me and it wasn't you! 

And so it fell upon a day,
(That is, it never rose again) 
A chick was found upon the hay,
Its little life had ebbed away.
No longer frolicsome and gay,
No longer could it run or play.
'And must we, chicken, must we part? '
Its master [ cried with bursting heart,
And voice of agony and pain. 
So one, whose ticket's marked 'Return', [
When to the lonely roadside station
He flies in fear and perturbation,
Thinks of his home- the hissing urn- 
Then runs with flying hat and hair,
And, entering, finds to his despair
He's missed the very last train. [

Too long it were to tell of each conjecture
Of chicken suicide, and poultry victim,
The deadly frown, the stern and dreary lecture,
The timid guess, 'perhaps some needle pricked him! '
The din of voice, the words both loud and many,
The sob, the tear, the sigh that none could smother,
Till all agreed 'a shilling to a penny
It killed itself, and we acquit the mother! '
Scarce was the verdict spoken,
When that still calm was broken,
A childish form hath burst into the throng; 
With tears and looks of sadness,
That bring no news of gladness,
But tell too surely something hath gone wrong! 
'The sight I have come upon
The stoutest heart [ would sicken,
That nasty hen has been and gone
And killed another chicken! 'Let laureates sing with rapturous swing
Of the wonder and glory of work;
Let pulpiteers preach and with passion impeach
The indolent wretches who shirk.
No doubt they are right: in the stress of the fight
It's the slackers who go to the wall;
So though it's my shame I perversely proclaim
It's fine to do nothing at all.

It's fine to recline on the flat of one's spine,
With never a thought in one's head:
It's lovely to le staring up at the sky
When others are earning their bread.
It's great to feel one with the soil and the sun,
Drowned deep in the grasses so tall;
Oh it's noble to sweat, pounds and dollars to get,
But - it's grand to do nothing at all.

So sing to the praise of the fellows who laze
Instead of lambasting the soil;
The vagabonds gay who lounge by the way,
Conscientious objectors to toil.
But lest you should think, by this spatter of ink,
The Muses still hold me in thrall,
I'll round out my rhyme, and (until the next time)
Work like hell - doing nothing at all. 

Did the research 
Once, twice, thrice over; 
It wasn’t appreciated.
Answered your questions
Gave you the resources; 
You didn’t use them.
I see now you will
Ask for more and more
As long as you don’t
Have to work at it.  
No wonder 
You call me friend
When I
Do the work
You are too lazy to do.
This has to end; 
I can’t continue 
M’dear
To live your life for you. 

I hate sports as a whole 
Being lazy in worlds ground
I roam here and there with laziness
My pride close my words in brain
What a creature in this lawn
Faded and pale on loneliness
Creature roam in laziness
Dig the land with some spade
But bent a matter never agreed
Quail and fade in some corner
Why don't move or workout
Laziness tie it in brains
Laziness shrinks lazy to its shell! ! ! 

Of days with work and worry rife,
But that is not my dream of life:
I think such men are crazy.
For me, a life with worries few,
A job of nothing much to do,
Just pelf enough to see me through:
I fear that I am lazy.

On winter mornings cold and drear,
When six o'clock alarms I hear,
'Tis then I love to shift my ear,
And hug my downy pillows.
When in the shade it's ninety-three,
No job in town looks good to me,
I'd rather loaf down by the sea,
And watch the foaming billows.

Some people think the world's a school,
Where labor is the only rule;
But I'll not make myself a mule,
And don't you ever doubt it.
I know that work may have its use,
But still I feel that's no excuse
For turning it into abuse;
What do you think about it?

Let others fume and sweat and boil,
And scratch and dig for golden spoil,
And live the life of work and toil,
Their lives to labor giving.
But what is gold when life is sped,
And life is short, as has been said,
And we are such a long time dead,
I'll spend my life in living. 

Mere des souvenirs, mattresses des mattresses
Oh ! all my joy and all my duty thou !
The beauty of caresses that have been,
The evenings and the hearth remember now,

The evenings burning with the glowing fire,
And on the balcony, the rose-stained nights!
How sweet, how kind you were, my soul's desire.
We said things wonderful as chrysolites,
When evening burned beside the glowing fire.

How fair the Sun is in the evening !
How strong the soul, how high the heaven's high tower !
O first and last of every worshipped thing,
Your odorous heart's-blood filled me like a flower.
How fair the sun is in the evening !

The night grew deep between us like a pall,
And in the dark I guessed your shining eyes,
And drank your breath, O sweet, O honey-gall!
Your little feet slept on me sister-wise.
The night grew deep between us like a pall;

I can call back the days desirable,
And live all bliss again between your knees,
For where else can I find that magic spell
Save in your heart and in your Mysteries ?
I can call back the days desirable.

These vows, these scents, these kisses infinite,
Will they like young suns climbing up the skies
Rise up from some unfathomable pit,
Washed in the sea from all impurities ?
O vows, O scents, O kisses infinite 


The Balcony


Mother of memories, mistress of mistresses,
O you, all my pleasure, O you, all my duty!
You'll remember the sweetness of our caresses,
The peace of the fireside, the charm of the evenings.
Mother of memories, mistress of mistresses!

The evenings lighted by the glow of the coals, 
The evenings on the balcony, veiled with rose mist; 
How soft your breast was to me! how kind was your heart! 
We often said imperishable things, 
The evenings lighted by the glow of the coals.

How splendid the sunsets are on warm evenings!
How deep space is! how potent is the heart!
I thought I breathed the perfume in your blood.
How splendid the sunsets are on warm evenings!

The night was growing dense like an encircling wall, 
My eyes in the darkness felt the fire of your gaze 
And I drank in your breath, O sweetness, O poison! 
And your feet nestled soft in my brotherly hands. 
The night was growing dense like an encircling wall.

I know the art of evoking happy moments, 
And live again our past, my head laid on your knees, 
For what's the good of seeking your languid beauty 
Elsewhere than in your dear body and gentle heart? 
I know the art of evoking happy moments.

Those vows, those perfumes, those infinite kisses, 
Will they be reborn from a gulf we may not sound, 
As rejuvenated suns rise in the heavens 
After being bathed in the depths of deep seas?
— O vows! O perfumes! O infinite kisses!




The Balcony 

Yourself are all my pleasure, all my duty; 
You will recall caresses that were yours 
And fireside evenings in their warmth and beauty. 

On eves illumined by the light of coal, 
The balcony beneath a rose-veiled sky, 
Your breast how soft! Your heart how good and whole! 
We spoke eternal things that cannot die — 
On eves illumined by the light of coal!

How splendid sets the sun of a warm evening! 
How deep is space! the heart how full of power! 
I breathed the perfume of your blood in flower. 
How splendid sets the sun of a warm evening!

The evening like an alcove seemed to thicken, 
And as my eyes astrologised your own, 
Drinking your breath, I felt sweet poisons quicken, 
And in my hands your feet slept still as stone. 
The evening like an alcove seemed to thicken.

I know how to resuscitate dead minutes. 
I see my past, its face hid in your knees. 
How can I seek your languorous charm save in its 
Own source, your heart and body formed to please. 
I know how to resuscitate dead minutes.

These vows, these perfumes, and these countless kisses, 
Reborn from gulfs that we could never sound, 
Will they, like suns, once bathed in those abysses, 
Rejuvenated from the deep, rebound — 
These vows, these perfumes, and these countless kisses?




The Balcony


Inspirer of my youth, mistress beyond compare,
You who were all my pleasures, all my hopes and dreams!
Do you recall our cheerful room — our evenings there,
Quiet and passionate? Like yesterday, it seems,
Inspirer of my youth, mistress beyond compare!

The evenings lighted by the hushed flame of the coal, 
The warm rose-misted twilights in the early springs, 
The balcony! How I adored you, body and soul! 
And, darling, we have said imperishable things 
The evenings lighted by the hushed flame of the coal.

How splendid were the long slow summer sunsets, too!
How large the world appeared to us! How strong and good
Life ran then in our veins! When I leaned close to you
I thought that I could breathe the perfume of your blood.
How splendid were the long slow summer sunsets, too!

The night would close around us like a dim blue wall, 
And your eyes flashed within the darkness, and the sweet 
Drug of your breath came over me. Do you recall 
How I would love to lie for hours holding your feet? 
The night would close around us like a dim blue wall.

I can relive the ecstasy that Time has slain; 
At moments I can feel myself between your thighs. 
What use to hope for anything like that again 
With someone else? What use to seek in any wise? 
I can relive the ecstasy that Time has slain.

Those cries, those long embraces, that remembered scent:
Can they be lost for ever? Will they not come round
Like stars, like suns, to blaze upon the firmament
Of future worlds, from the abyss we cannot sound?
— O cries! O long embraces! O remembered scent!




The Balcony


Mistress of mistresses, mother of memories, 
O you my every pleasure, you my every duty! 
You shall recall our blandishments and ecstasies, 
The warm peace of our hearth, the evening's placid beauty. 
Mistress of mistresses, mother of memories!

Evenings illumined by the glow of coals afire 
Or on the balcony, veiled in a rosy mist. 
How soft your breast, how kind your heart to my desire! 
We said imperishable things the while we kissed, 
Evenings illumined by the glow of coals afire.

How glorious the sunset on warm summer nights! 
How deep space is! the human heart how competent! 
I thought I breathed your blood with its suave acrid scent. 
How glorious the sunset on warm summer nights!

The night grew dense, forming a wall to compass us, 
Across the dark your eyes bound mine with golden bands, 
I drank your breath in deep, O sweet, O poisonous! 
Your slender feet slept softly in my gentle hands. 
The night grew dense, forming a wall to compass us.

The resurrection of glad moments is an art 
I know: I live anew, my head pressed to your knees, 
For where, if not in your loved flesh and tender heart,
Can I seek out the wonder of your languidness?
The resurrection of glad moments is an art.

These vows, these fragrant scents, these kisses without end,
Shall they be born again out of infinity?
As suns rejuvenated in the skies ascend,
Having been laved in the unfathomable sea?
— O vows! O fragrant scents! — O kisses without end!






Le Balcon


mother of memories, mistress of mistresses 
— thou, all my pleasure, thou, my fealties all!
thou shalt recall each kiss how soft it is,
how warm our hearth, the night how magical,
mother of memories, mistress of mistresses!

long hours illumined by the glowing fire
long balcony-hours veiled with misty rose;
soft pillowing breast! heart warm to my desire!
and all the imperishable things we whispered, those
long hours illumined by the glowing fire

how softly shone the golden, shimmering sun!
how deep the skyey space! how rich love's power!
for bending toward thee, most beloved one,
I seemed to breathe thy pulses like a flower.
how softly shone the golden, shimmering sun!

Night with her thickening wall imprisoned us,
eyes groped for widening eyes the black withheld,
I drank thy breath, o sweet, o poisonous!
thy feet slept in my hands fraternal held;
Night with her thickening wall imprisoned us.

my magic art evoked a rapture perished,
for in thy clasp I saw my youth afresh,
could others yield the languorous charm I cherished,
thy gentle heart, thy dear and lovely flesh?
my magic art evoked a rapture perished!

but — vows and fragrance, infinite desire —
shall they arise from gulfs too deep to plumb,
as morn by morn new suns of rosier fire
mount, laved in some dark sea Elysium?
o vows! o fragrance! infinite desire!

     -' The Torn Sky: Lesson # .  June Jordan. From 'Naming Our Destiny: New & Selected Poems', pp.' J'en ferai un pour vous', dit-il, 'et le balancer
Parfaitement sur vous'. Et je sentais presque
Le fil a plomb du tweed plie me battre le talon, 

Mes epaules comme un espar ou une echelle mobile
Sous le veste, toute ma taille redefinie
En des facons qui m'allaient comme un gant.

Donc bien qu'un complet fut la derniere chose dont j'avais besoin
Je pesai  ses mots et lui dis que je le prendrais en decidant
Sur-le-champ il coutait une bagatelle.


   - ' The Suit'.  Seamus Heaney.   

I have put on my great coat it is cold.

It is an outer garment.

Coarse, woolen.

Of unknown origin.

                *

It has a fine inner lining but it is 
as an exterior that you see it  a grace.

                *

I have a coat I am wearing. It is a fine admixture.
The woman who threw the threads in the two directions
has made, skillfully, something dark-true,
as the evening calls the bird up into
the branches of the shaven hedgerows,
to twitter bodily
a makeshift coat  the boxelder cut back stringently by the owner 
that more might grow next year, and thicker, you know  
the birds tucked gestures on the inner branches  
and space in the heart, 
not shade-giving, not 
chronological.  

Oh transformer, logic, where are you here in this fold, 
my name being called-out now but back, behind, 
in the upper world

                *

I have a coat I am wearing I was told to wear it.
Someone knelt down each morning to button it up.
I looked at their face, down low, near me.
What is longing?  what is a star?
Watched each button a peapod getting tucked back in. 
Watched harm with its planeloads folded up in the sleeves. 
Watched grappling hooks trawl through the late-night waters. 
Watched bands of stations scan unable to ascertain.
There are fingers, friend, that never grow sluggish.
They crawl up the coat and don't miss an eyehole.
Glinting in kitchenlight.
Supervised by the traffic god.
Hissed at by grassblades that wire-up outside
their stirring rhetoric  this is your land, this is my my   

                *

You do understanding, don't you, by looking?
The coat, which is itself a ramification, a city,
floats vulnerably above another city, ours,
the city on the hill (only with hill gone),
floats in illustration
of what once was believed, and thus was visible  
(all things believed are visible) 
floats a Jacob's ladder with hovering empty arms, an open throat,
a place where a heart might beat if it wishes,
pockets that hang awaiting the sandy whirr of a small secret,
folds where the legs could be, with their kneeling mechanism,
the floating fatigue of an after-dinner herald,
not guilty of any treason towards life except fatigue,
a skillfully cut coat, without chronology,
filled with the sensation of being suddenly completed 
as then it is, abruptly, the last stitch laid in, the knot bit off 
hung there in Gravity, as if its innermost desire,
numberless the awaitings flickering around it,
the other created things also floating but not of the same order, no,
not like this form, built so perfectly to mantle the body,
the neck like a vase awaiting its cut flower,
a skirting barely visible where the tucks indicate
the mild loss of bearing in the small of the back,
the grammar, so strict, of the two exact shoulders 
and the law of the shouldering 
and the chill allowed to skitter up through,
and those crucial spots where the fit cannot be perfect  
oh skirted loosening aswarm with lessenings,
with the mild pallors of unaccomplishment,
flaps night-air collects in,
folds.  But the night does not annul its belief in,
the night preserves its love for, this one narrowing of infinity,
that floats up into the royal starpocked blue its ripped, distracted supervisor 
this coat awaiting recollection,
this coat awaiting the fleeting moment, the true moment, the hill,the vision of the hill,
and then the moment when the prize is lost, and the erotic tinglings of the dream of reason 
are left to linger mildly in the weave of the fabric according to the rules,
the wool gabardine mix, with its grammatical weave, 
never never destined to lose its elasticity, 
its openness to abandonment, 
its willingness to be disturbed.

                * 

July
Oaks: the organization of this tree is difficult. Speaking generally 
no doubt the determining planes are concentric, a system of brief contiguous and 
continuous tangents, whereas those of the cedar wd. roughly be called horizontals 
and those of the beech radiating but modified by droop and by a screw-set towards 
jutting points. But beyond this since the normal growth of the boughs is radiating 
there is a system of spoke-wise clubs of green  sleeve-pieces. And since the 
end shoots curl and carry young scanty leaf-stars these clubs are tapered, and I 
have seen also pieces in profile with chiseled outlines, the blocks thus made 
detached and lessening towards the end. However the knot-star is the chief thing: 
it is whorled, worked round, and this is what keeps up the illusion of the tree. 
Oaks differ much, and much turns on the broadness of the leaves, the narrower 
giving the crisped and starry and catharine-wheel forms, the broader the flat-pieced 
mailed or chard-covered ones, in wh. it is possible to see composition in dips, etc. 
But I shall study them further. It was this night I believe but possibly the next 
that I saw clearly the impossibility of staying in the Church of England.

                *

How many coats do you think it will take?

The coat was a great-coat.

The Emperor's coat was.

How many coats do you think it will take?

The undercoat is dry. What we now want is?

The sky can analyse the coat because of the rips in it. 

The sky shivers through the coat because of the rips in it. 

The rips in the sky ripen through the rips in the coat. 

There is no quarrel.

                *

I take off my coat and carry it.

                *

There is no emergency.

                *

I only made that up.

                *

Behind everything the sound of something dripping

The sound of something: I will vanish, others will come here, what is that? 

The canvas flapping in the wind like the first notes of our absence

An origin is not an action though it occurs at the very start

Desire goes travelling into the total dark of another's soul 
looking for where it breaks off

I was a hard thing to undo

                *

The life of a customer 

What came on the paper plate 

overheard nearby

an impermanence         of structure

watching the lip-reading

had loved but couldn't now recognize

                *

What are the objects, then, that man should consider most important? 

What sort of a question is that  he asks them.

The eye only discovers the visible slowly.

It floats before us asking to be worn,

offering "we must think about objects at the very moment 
when all their meaning is abandoning them"

and "the title provides a protection from significance" 

and "we are responsible for the universe


                *

I have put on my doubting, my wager, it is cold.
It is an outer garment, or, conversely a natural covering,
so coarse and woolen, also of unknown origin,
a barely apprehensible dilution of evening into
an outer garment, or, conversely a natural covering,
to twitter bodily a makeshift coat,
that more might grow next year, and thicker, you know,
not shade-giving, not chronological,
my name being called out now but from out back, behind,
an outer garment, so coarse and woolen,
also of unknown origin, not shade-giving, not chronological,
each harm with its planeloads folded up in the sleeves,
you do understand, don't you, by looking?
the jacob's ladder with its floating arms its open throat,
that more might grow next year, and thicker, you know, 
filled with the sensation of being suddenly completed, 
the other created things also floating but not of the same order, 
not shade-giving, not chronological, 
you do understand, don't you, by looking? 
a neck like a vase awaiting its cut flower, 
filled with the sensation of being suddenly completed,
the moment the prize is lost, the erotic tingling, 
the wool-gabardine mix, its grammatical weave
  you do understand, don't you, by looking? 
never never destined to lose its elasticity,
it was this night I believe but possibly the next
I saw clearly the impossibility of staying
filled with the sensation of being suddenly completed,
also of unknown origin, not shade-giving, not chronological 
since the normal growth of boughs is radiating 
a system of spoke-wise clubs of green  sleeve pieces 
never never destined to lose its elasticity 
my name being called out now but back, behind, 
hissing how many coats do you think it will take
"or try with eyesight to divide" (there is no quarrel)
behind everything the sound of something dripping
a system of spoke-wise clubs of green  sleeve pieces
filled with the sensation of suddenly being completed 
the wool gabardine mix, the grammatical weave,
the never-never-to-lose-its-elasticity: my name 
flapping in the wind like the first note of my absence
hissing how many coats do you think it will take
are you a test case is it an emergency
flapping in the wind the first note of something
overheard nearby an impermanence of structure
watching the lip-reading, there is no quarrel,
I will vanish, others will come here, what is that,
never never to lose the sensation of suddenly being 
completed in the wind  the first note of our quarrel 
it was this night I believe or possibly the next 
filled with the sensation of being suddenly completed,
I will vanish, others will come here, what is that now 
floating in the air before us with stars a test case 
that I saw clearly the impossibility of staying


A BLUSH as of roses
Where rose never grew!
Great drops on the bunch-grass,
But not of the dew!
A taint in the sweet air
For wild bees to shun!
A stain that shall never
Bleach out in the sun!
Back, steed of the prairies!
Sweet song-bird, fly back!
Wheel hither, bald vulture!
Gray wolf, call thy pack!
The foul human vultures
Have feasted and fled;
The wolves of the Border
Have crept from the dead.
From the hearths of their cabins,
The fields of their corn,
Unwarned and unweaponed,
The victims were torn, —
By the whirlwind of murder
Swooped up and swept on
To the low, reedy fen-lands,
The Marsh of the Swan.
With a vain plea for mercy
No stout knee was crooked;
In the mouths of the rifles
Right manly they looked.
How paled the May sunshine,
O Marais du Cygne!
On death for the strong life,
On red grass for green!
In the homes of their rearing,
Yet warm with their lives,
Ye wait the dead only,
Poor children and wives!
Put out the red forge-fire,
The smith shall not come;
Unyoke the brown oxen,
The ploughman lies dumb.
Wind slow from the Swan's Marsh,
O dreary death-train,
With pressed lips as bloodless
As lips of the slain!
Kiss down the young eyelids,
Smooth down the gray hairs;
Let tears quench the curses
That burn through your prayers.
Strong man of the prairies,
Mourn bitter and wild!
Wail, desolate woman!
Weep, fatherless child!
From ashes beneath,
And the crown of his harvest
Is life out of death.
Not in vain on the dial
The shade moves along,
To point the great contrasts
Of right and of wrong:
Free homes and free altars,
Free prairie and flood, —
The reeds of the Swan's Marsh,
Whose bloom is of blood!
On the lintels of Kansas
That blood shall not dry;
Henceforth the Bad Angel
Shall harmless go by;
Henceforth to the sunset,
Unchecked on her way,
Shall Liberty follow
The march of the day. 



Morning

The mist of the morning is torn by the peaks
Old towers gleam white in the ray,
And already the glory so joyously seeks
The lark that's saluting the day. 

Then smile away, man, at the heavens so fair,
Though, were you swept hence in the night,
From your dark, lonely tomb the owlets would stare
At the sun rising newly as bright. 

But out of earth's trammels your soul would have flown
Where glitters Eternity's stream,
And you shall have wake 'midst pure glories unknown,
As sunshine disperses a dream. 

Le matin sur les montagnes ou la brume
se diffuse
en bas aux profondeurs des feuilles
des frenes et des chenes
en coulant vers l'aspect de tout le lac 
froid
bien que le ciel surveillant
d'un vermillon si solenn
subdivise/les
rayures aussi legeres
aussi douces que l'ouverture
que ta bouche

    -' The Morning on the Mountains'.  June Jordan. 'Naming Our Destiny', p."Mother of heaven, regina of the clouds, 
O sceptre of the sun, crown of the moon, 
There is not nothing, no, no, never nothing, 
Like the clashed edges of two words that kill." 
And so I mocked her in magnificent measure. 
Or was it that I mocked myself alone? 
I wish that I might be a thinking stone. 
The sea of spuming thought foists up again 
The radiant bubble that she was. And then 
A deep up-pouring from some saltier well 
Within me, bursts its watery syllable. 

II
A red bird flies across the golden floor. 
It is a red bird that seeks out his choir 
Among the choirs of wind and wet and wing. 
A torrent will fall from him when he finds. 
Shall I uncrumple this much-crumpled thing? 
I am a man of fortune greeting heirs; 
For it has come that thus I greet the spring. 
These choirs of welcome choir for me farewell. 
No spring can follow past meridian. 
Yet you persist with anecdotal bliss 
To make believe a starry connaissance. 


III
Is it for nothing, then, that old Chinese 
Sat tittivating by their mountain pools 
Or in the Yangtse studied out their beards? 
I shall not play the flat historic scale. 
You know how Utamaro’s beauties sought 
The end of love in their all-speaking braids. 
You know the mountainous coiffures of Bath. 
Alas! Have all the barbers lived in vain 
That not one curl in nature has survived? 
Why, without pity on these studious ghosts, 
Do you come dripping in your hair from sleep? 

IV
This luscious and impeccable fruit of life 
Falls, it appears, of its own weight to earth. 
When you were Eve, its acrid juice was sweet, 
Untasted, in its heavenly, orchard air. 
An apple serves as well as any skull 
To be the book in which to read a round, 
And is as excellent, in that it is composed 
Of what, like skulls, comes rotting back to ground. 
But it excels in this, that as the fruit 
Of love, it is a book too mad to read 
Before one merely reads to pass the time. 

V
In the high west there burns a furious star. 
It is for fiery boys that star was set 
And for sweet-smelling virgins close to them. 
The measure of the intensity of love 
Is measure, also, of the verve of earth. 
For me, the firefly’s quick, electric stroke 
Ticks tediously the time of one more year. 
And you? Remember how the crickets came 
Out of their mother grass, like little kin, 
In the pale nights, when your first imagery 
Found inklings of your bond to all that dust. 

VI
If men at forty will be painting lakes 
The ephemeral blues must merge for them in one, 
The basic slate, the universal hue. 
There is a substance in us that prevails. 
But in our amours amorists discern 
Such fluctuations that their scrivening 
Is breathless to attend each quirky turn. 
When amorists grow bald, then amours shrink 
Into the compass and curriculum 
Of introspective exiles, lecturing. 
It is a theme for Hyacinth alone. 

VII
The mules that angels ride come slowly down 
The blazing passes, from beyond the sun. 
Descensions of their tinkling bells arrive. 
These muleteers are dainty of their way. 
Meantime, centurions guffaw and beat 
Their shrilling tankards on the table-boards. 
This parable, in sense, amounts to this: 
The honey of heaven may or may not come, 
But that of earth both comes and goes at once. 
Suppose these couriers brought amid their train 
A damsel heightened by eternal bloom. 

VIII
Like a dull scholar, I behold, in love, 
An ancient aspect touching a new mind. 
It comes, it blooms, it bears its fruit and dies. 
This trivial trope reveals a way of truth. 
Our bloom is gone. We are the fruit thereof. 
Two golden gourds distended on our vines, 
Into the autumn weather, splashed with frost, 
Distorted by hale fatness, turned grotesque. 
We hang like warty squashes, streaked and rayed, 
The laughing sky will see the two of us 
Washed into rinds by rotting winter rains. 

IX
In verses wild with motion, full of din, 
Loudened by cries, by clashes, quick and sure 
As the deadly thought of men accomplishing 
Their curious fates in war, come, celebrate 
The faith of forty, ward of Cupido. 
Most venerable heart, the lustiest conceit 
Is not too lusty for your broadening. 
I quiz all sounds, all thoughts, all everything 
For the music and manner of the paladins 
To make oblation fit. Where shall I find 
Bravura adequate to this great hymn? 

X
The fops of fancy in their poems leave 
Memorabilia of the mystic spouts, 
Spontaneously watering their gritty soils. 
I am a yeoman, as such fellows go. 
I know no magic trees, no balmy boughs, 
No silver-ruddy, gold-vermilion fruits. 
But, after all, I know a tree that bears 
A semblance to the thing I have in mind. 
It stands gigantic, with a certain tip 
To which all birds come sometime in their time. 
But when they go that tip still tips the tree. 

XI
If sex were all, then every trembling hand 
Could make us squeak, like dolls, the wished-for words. 
But note the unconscionable treachery of fate, 
That makes us weep, laugh, grunt and groan, and shout 
Doleful heroics, pinching gestures forth 
From madness or delight, without regard 
To that first, foremost law. Anguishing hour! 
Last night, we sat beside a pool of pink, 
Clippered with lilies scudding the bright chromes, 
Keen to the point of starlight, while a frog 
Boomed from his very belly odious chords. 

XII
A blue pigeon it is, that circles the blue sky, 
On sidelong wing, around and round and round. 
A white pigeon it is, that flutters to the ground, 
Grown tired of flight. Like a dark rabbi, I 
Observed, when young, the nature of mankind, 
In lordly study. Every day, I found 
Man proved a gobbet in my mincing world. 
Like a rose rabbi, later, I pursued, 
And still pursue, the origin and course 
Of love, but until now I never knew 
That fluttering things have so distinct a shade. 



Why wait for Arthur? He too long has slept.
He shall not hear you--no, nor heed your moan,
Their watch for him what months in Avalon!
He shall not wake for any mother's son
Nor mother's daughter of them all in tears,
His knights, his ladies. How then for this one,
You the last blossom of our world's lost years?
--Ah, let him sleep. For see how in the wood,
Under the dead oak, green new saplings spring,
How the thorn blossoms, while birds cry aloud
In scorn of grief. And, Lady, by the rood!
There rides a knight, new--armed and questing proud,
Who shouts, The king is dead. Long live the King!'



That time will come that will surely wither
Your bright flower, it will wilt and yellow,
Then if I can grin, I'll call on laughter,
But, yet, that would be foolish though:
You'll be pale and ugly: and I'll be old,
Drink deep then, while the stream's still flowing:
And don't bring trouble on all men so,
Succour a poor man, without crushing.
 
Amorous Prince, the greatest lover,
I want no evil that's of your doing,
To succour a poor man, without crushing. 


Item
 
This I give to my poor mother
As a prayer now, to our Mistress
- She who bore bitter pain for me,
I've no other castle or fortress,
That my body and soul can summon,
When I'm faced with life's distress,
Nor has my mother, poor woman:
 
Ballade
 
Empress of the infernal regions,
To live among the chosen ones,
Though I'm worth less than anyone.
Your grace, my Lady and Mistress
Is greater than my sinfulness,
Grace without which, I tell no lie,
None deserve their blessedness.
In this faith let me live and die.
 
Say to your Son that I am His.
Through Him all my sins are lost:
Forgive me, as Mary Egypt was,
Or, so they say, Theophilus,
Who by your grace was still blameless,
Though he vowed the Devil a guest.
Protect me always from like excess,
Virgin, who bore, without a cry,
In this faith let me live and die.

I am a woman, poor and old,
I can neither read nor spell.
At Mass in church, here, I behold,
A painted Heaven, with harps: a Hell,
Where the damned are boiled, as well.
One gives me joy: one strikes me cold,
On whom all sinners must rely,
Fill me with faith and no slackness.
In this faith let me live and die.
 
V  irgin, you bore, O High Princess,
I   ssue, whose kingdom is endless,
L  ord, who took on a littleness
L  ike ours: to save us left the sky,
O ffering his lovely youth to death.
In this faith let me live and die. 

A t dawn of day, when falcon shakes his wing,
M ainly from pleasure, and from noble usage,
B lackbirds too shake theirs then as they sing,
R eceiving their mates, mingling their plumage,
O, as the desires it lights in me now rage,
I 'd offer you, joyously, what befits the lover.
S ee how Love has written this very page:
E ven for this end are we come together.
 
D oubtless, as my heart's lady you'll have being,
E ntirely now, till death consumes my age.
L aurel, so sweet, for my cause now fighting,
O live, so noble, removing all bitter foliage,
R eason does not wish me unused to owing,
E ven as I'm to agree with this wish, forever,
Duty to you, but rather grow used to serving:
Even for this end are we come together.
 
And, what's more, when sorrow's beating
Down on me, through Fate's incessant rage,
Your sweet glance its malice is assuaging,
Nor more or less than wind blows smoke away.
As, in your field, I plant I lose no grain,
For the harvest resembles me, and ever
Even for this end are we come together.
 
Princess, listen to this I now maintain:
That my heart and yours will not dissever:
So much I presume of you, and claim:
Even for this end are we come together. 




It is greatness if you can bear the harm 
.. 

done to you by somebody! 

Thinking of the harm done to you 
.. 

by somebody is ignoble and smallness! 

If you lead a life suitably to make others to forget 
.. 

whatever harm you had done to them; 

And not giving an opportunity for the wealthy persons 
.. 

and virtuous people to make fun of you and giggle, 
It is good and pleasurable resulting in your goodness

Beware ye leaders, who sit upon a
thrown, high above the masses.
Your view may well become obscured and
jaded as to the reasons for your accent.

If you fail to walk among your people
and feel their pain, know their needs
and return their love. 
they shall cast you out

still I go, 
from morning to evening, 
sitting at a dark street, 
saluting every one who passes by, 
hoping someone will lit a candle in the dark.
I have a stale bread in my hand, 
a shirt of faded colors and below is a lion cloth, 
that is failing to hide my ugly nudity.
My children have slept after crying in hunger.
In my hut there is no electricity no water.
One who robbed the nation and was killed, 
is called a martyr a great leader.
One the money launderer, 
who has bank accounts in the foreign countries, 
and factories abroad, 
is my gentle leader, 
who has made the nation almost bankrupt.
The hunger that had constrained the old man
the monologue, drawn attention of an armored vehicle, 
the officer told his men to straight the bent body of the old man, 
and ordered his men to see if he is an enemy's agent
or a terrorist.
The missing person was at last found behind the bars
of a mental hospital. 

Sure, you're tough and resilient -
able to keep your feelings 
under control, 
when everyone around you
is losing ground, 
sliding into the abyss.  

They know you will be there
to throw them a lifeline, 
your strength, 
your ability to protect them
will save the day, 
you are their hero; 

But, to what are you anchored? 
What holds you fast, 
makes you
impervious to self destruction
when everything else
is being destroyed? 

When do you reach the limit
of your own strength, 
begin to 
slide into your own abyss? 
And who will come
to rescue you then? 

Reach out and take my hand, 
my grasp is ever firm, 
ever loyal -
lay your burdens on me, 
I am strong for you

lean on me.


ean out of the window, 
Goldenhair, 
I hear you singing 
A merry air. 

My book was closed, 
I read no more, 
Watching the fire dance 
On the floor. 

I have left my book, 
I have left my room, 
For I heard you singing 
Through the gloom. 

Singing and singing 
A merry air, 
Lean out of the window, 
Goldenhair. 

Leaning into the afternoons I cast my sad nets
towards your oceanic eyes.

There in the highest blaze my solitude lengthens and flames,
its arms turning like a drowning man's.

I send out red signals across your absent eyes
that smell like the sea or the beach by a lighthouse.

You keep only darkness, my distant female,
from your regard sometimes the coast of dread emerges.

Leaning into the afternoons I fling my sad nets
to that sea that is thrashed by your oceanic eyes.

The birds of night peck at the first stars
that flash like my soul when I love you.

The night gallops on its shadowy mare
shedding blue tassels over the land. 

About His Kingdom called Heaven; 
About His angels and saints; 
About His glory and power.

About the narrow road to Heaven; 
About the broad paths to hell; 
About His Ten Commandments; 
About the need to avoid sins.

About the prophets and their prophecies; 
About His just punishments as well.

About the Last Judgment Day; 

About the need to repent for our sins; 
About the forgiveness of sins; 
About the end of the world! 

waitinig, watching
wonders if you know
what to do, how to fly

You learn to live your life
in humans relms of plight
You look upon the stage
and think yes thats the way

But then you begin to see
thats not all there is in life
you need to learn to fly
in the astrial realm up high
It helps you too see
the woven paths we weave

You start to fly, above the clouds
and duck and weave in flight
then with purpose and a smile
you touch those who need your light

Then you teach them how to fly
to follow you on wings
Once flying high you know no bounds
and suddenly your free

The entity just nods and smiles
as you reach out 
to all with love
and learn to fly 
For all eternity


School yourself to savour most
Joys that have but little cost;
Prove the best of life is free,
Sun and stars and sky and sea;
Eager in your eyes to please,
Proffer meadows, brooks and trees;
Nature strives for your content,
Never charging you a cent.

Learn to love a garden gay,
Flowers and fruit in rich array.
Care for dogs and singing birds,
Have for children cheery words.
Find plain food and comfort are
More than luxury by far.
Music, books and honest friends
Outweigh golden dividends.

Love your work and do it well,
Scorning not a leisure spell.
Hold the truest form of wealth
Body fit and ruddy health.
Let your smile of happiness
Rustic peace serenely stress:
Home to love and heart to pray--

Learn to listen to the pain.


Body is a bridge
that carry us from our inner life
to the outer world.

Pain often gives us insight 
as to where the bridge 
is experiencing  the most stress.

Pain lets us know 
where we might crack, 
where our lives need 
to be reinforced and rested, 
in order for us to keep bringing
our inner and outer lives together.

When we suffer from deep and acute pains, 
learn how to hold on and let go.
Learn how to endure.
It means learning to let the pain go through.
without denying its hurt.
Learn to listen to the pain.

And I'm learning to say please.
And I'm learning to use Kleenex,
Not my sweater, when I sneeze.
And I'm learning not to dribble.

And I'm learning that it's much
Much easier to be a slob.

Or, My mind is blank
But My verse is blank? 
Oh.
I think I worked it out. 

They're taking down a tree at the front door,
The power saw is snarling at some nerves,
Whining at others. Now and then it grunts,
And sawdust falls like snow or a drift of seeds.
Rotten, they tell us, at the fork, and one
Big wind would bring it down. So what they do
They do, as usual, to do us good.
Whatever cannot carry its own weight 
Has got to go, and so on; you expect
To hear them talking next about survival
And the values of a free society.
For in the explanations people give
On these occasions there is generally some
Mean-spirited moral point, and everyone
Privately wonders if his neighbors plan
To saw him up before he falls on them.

Maybe a hundred years in sun and shower
Dismantled in a morning and let down
Out of itself a finger at a time
And then an arm, and so down to the trunk,
Until there's nothing left to hold on to
Or snub the splintery holding rope around,
And where those big green divagations were
So loftily with shadows interleaved
The absent-minded blue rains in on us.
Now that they've got it sectioned on the ground

It looks as though somebody made a plain 
Error in diagnosis, for the wood
Looks sweet and sound throughout. You couldn't know,
Of course, until you took it down. That's what
Experts are for, and these experts stand round
The giant pieces of tree as though expecting
An instruction booklet from the factory
Before they try to put it back together.

Anyhow, there it isn't, on the ground.
Next come the tractor and the crowbar crew
To extirpate what's left and fill the grave.
Maybe tomorrow grass seed will be sown.
There's some mean-spirited moral point in that
As well: you learn to bury your mistakes,
Though for a while at dusk the darkening air 
Will be with many shadows interleaved,
And pierced with a bewilderment of birds. 

yellow bus stroking the 
curves 
on a concrete highway

windows wide open grabbing air
for a field trip in an early May 
heat blast

with very 
short khakis spouting lean legs 
the teacher's aide 
led me down a stream along a shaded path 

steeped in the backwoods element she 
crouched barefoot in a pool
scooping crystal water with her cupped hands

what she couldn't get into her mouth spilled on 
her nose and chin, 
trickled down her chest
and I realized she was naked underneath that 
half buttoned shirt
but I couldn't stop staring
while she lingered like a living sculpture with 
droplets on her dark tipped mounds


Truly, that reading is fun and learning is more fun. 

Learning language, grammer and accounts 
are important parts of education those days, 
taught by well respected teachers in any place! 

Experienced and learned people are necessary
to solve the disputes amicably in any society
among the congregation of members of the community! 

People should have the quality 
of 'give and take' sharing policy
of food with the neighbours! 

Any such place WITHOUT
the following three 
 

well respected teachers, 
 the experienced and learned people
to solve the disputes and 
 the people who have
'give and take' sharing policy
is of no use to anybody. 

of course her shoes would be patent leather red! 
how could we question that? (the girl who danced
on the record unable to stop when the music did) 

since you had flats of cherry velvet

and danced on the messy side of the room
singing 'nimbus, nimbus, cumulo stratus'
on the Saturday afternoons we discovered that

cloud names made us laugh the most of all
when repeated over and over.
today I prayed you would fear no funnels

fast appearing in the emerald or the Fair skies
whisking you away. and that no one would serve
you funnel cakes with trick pink candles.

today I prayed without disguise
someone would remember your birthday
and scatter small rosebuds as if you

were in an old play
in ballet skirts of pale red and blue equals
violet of the loveliest hue.

and you are far away
in your own music wrapped, 
as you were then; 

learning Mozart all over again.

I got back after a life time learning many things, 
but swimming, just a little bit, 
here, little bit there.

Pond is like life, we are all born what for, god alone knows
we pick up every second as it comes, may be later day and months
as sensitivity to surrounding become lesser, we take years in one mouthful, 
life, as it flows swiftly, every dog bites, his bite, barks, his bark
now, life is so sweet with birds and animals and all computerised brains, 
we humans all insecure with our discretionary power, quite in-discretionary.

So I went to the pond, love those hugging dresses, love water surface
water appears to be my mother angel, though, drowning fear crowned me
I love water touches, love the gleaming sunlit face of lovely feel, 
love those powerful phantoms underneath, how water could carry my kgs
I still cannot believe Science could establish, Our Reverend Archimedes
or Boyles, oh I don't remember exactly, I am too old to remember good things, 
ugly and bad and gossipy and under rated ones, human hearts dwell and dwell
enjoy perverted minds all those ugly and cheap lovely matters, memory treasures well, 
now decent, updated scientific creativity ohho, human hearts are afraid of niceties, 
natural adoration and abominable admiration for perverted mind manipulations you see, 
all ruminating monsters, love, the chunk of filthy, concentrated evil doings, 
now, he is no exception, that chap, may god help him, crooked eyes and cunning looks, 
how NVC explores your attitude towards decency he demonstrates, 
one look at his walk, his throw of legs to both sides, filthy demo, 
his screwing of vulgarity as he walks, the more ugly his mind grows
the more broader his forehead loses hair, watch his eyes, liked wolves in cartoons, 
that peep out of dark bushes, hyenas rather, how lovely to write about squirrels and peacocks, 
thank about third rate scoundrels with high regard to their monster impishes, 

now, back to pond and swimming, lovely pools, ponds too, water is a highly saintly element of nature, it makes you meditate upon nothing
but it only, you are lost in the world of waters, no thoughts, just fear of life, makes you float and learn the trick of water bending 
you float, learn to manage the body weight and water body's magics
how could the soft, tender water lift my stubbornly refusing chunky mass
from sinking down deep within its folds, I learnt so floating, 
it was a bliss, it was a wonderful life experience, swimming cleansed me

So is life, you go for swimming, you learn about fishes, tricky whales
magic of scientific applications, quantum energy and how you are not you
that you are only a microcosmic quantum of energy, that is omnipotent
at the end of life, which I am nearly nearing, when the torrent of hate has subsided, when you can see through men, good and evil alone witnessing, 
any more reactions in you, just watching the unwanted stuff slide by
like a crane, a stork, a heron, a flamingo or any water bird letting go of
the bulk of sliding dirt and filthy faces and hearts pass by, just focussing on fishes of lovely jumps, dancing beauties of heavens, 
your aim, focussed on the one and only goal of self conscious energy balls, 
globes, orbs, stars, sun and moon, planets, just to become one with Cosmic singularity.

Oh, though I was born for what I know not, but learn swimming I was forced to as life like waters do many tricks pushing, pulling, dishevelling, trampling, paining, agonizing, all nastiness pores out from various fellow beings, who are just tools, 
now why blame the hyena and the tiger, it is but only a predator by fate
So, at the end of my life, I learnt, these predators are nothing at all, 
Secret of Success is your beautiful attitude towards the predators
just cooly smile the filthiness off their asses, wait for the lovely rush of gold fishes, nice company, many good hearts are awaiting your presence, come on, let us walk ahead, leave the junk of poohs polluting
Ahead, Ahead is the road to paradise, this way Madam, stop not at the door point of perverts, walk ahead, life is very very beautiful, just be patient, good men and good gods and angels are at paradise gates, 
FAITH is all ye need, faith in goodness, virtues, purity, truth and love. 

Before you can learn the trees, you have to learn
The language of the trees. That's done indoors,
Out of a book, which now you think of it
Is one of the transformations of a tree.

The words themselves are a delight to learn,
You might be in a foreign land of terms
Like samara, capsule, drupe, legume and pome,
Where bark is papery, plated, warty or smooth.

But best of all are the words that shape the leaves –
Orbicular, cordate, cleft and reniform –
And their venation – palmate and parallel –
And tips – acute, truncate, auriculate.

Sufficiently provided, you may now
Go forth to the forests and the shady streets
To see how the chaos of experience
Answers to catalogue and category.

Confusedly. The leaves of a single tree
May differ among themselves more than they do
From other species, so you have to find,
All blandly says the book, "an average leaf


Example, the catalpa in the book
Sprays out its leaves in whorls of three
Around the stem; the one in front of you
But rarely does, or somewhat, or almost;

Maybe it's not catalpa? Dreadful doubt.
It may be weeks before you see an elm
Fanlike in form, a spruce that pyramids,
A sweetgum spiring up in steeple shape.

Still, pedetemtim as Lucretious says,
Little by little, you do start to learn;
And learn as well, maybe, what language does
And how it does it, cutting across the world

Not always at the joints, competing with
Experience while cooperating with
Experience, and keeping an obstinate
Intransigence, uncanny, of its own.

Think finally about the secret will
Pretending obedience to Nature, but
Invidiously distinguishing everywhere,
Dividing up the world to conquer it.

And think also how funny knowledge is:
You may succeed in learning many trees
And calling off their names as you go by,
But their comprehensive silence stays the same. 

learning to deal with us as though we were machines
takes many years of study, so it seems.
it helps to have a background in the sciences.

learning to throw us over the cliffs
while simulating friendship, home and hearth
whatever we could imagine as the safest place to be

takes much finesse. don't bring a clipboard, smile.
ask personal questions.
whole schools exist and just for this
though they cry: under funded.

we are the underserved at best, 
the students who think for ourselves
a little distressed. but they'll fix that, won't they? 

they mimic kindness
calling us this.
we, who used to have our own names

before we came here.

Because of you I learned to fly
You made me live and gave me wings
Instead of chunky diamond rings

Up in the air behind the clouds 
The sky is blue and without doubts
I know I will and have to fall
To save the greatest love of all

Flying alone is not fulfilling
For you I'd fall to the precipice of sinning
Descending from the highest height
To be with you before it's too late


Come, my darling, come away,
Take a pretty walk to-day; 
Run along, and never fear,
I'll take care of baby dear: 
Up and down with little feet,
That's the way to walk, my sweet. 

Now it is so very near,
Soon she'll get to mother dear. 
There she comes along at last: 
Here's my finger, hold it fast: 
Now one pretty little kiss,
After such a walk as this. 

Very soon the Yankee teachers
Came down and set up school;
But, oh! how the Rebs did hate it, -
It was agin' their rule.

Our masters always tried to hide
Book learning from our eyes;
Knowledge did'nt agree with slavery -
'Twould make us all too wise.

But some of us would try to steal
A little from the book,
And put the words together,
And learn by hook or crook.

I remember Uncle Caldwell,
Who took pot liquor fat
And greased the pages of his book,
And hid it in his hat.

And had his master ever seen
The leaves upon his head,
He'd have thought them greasy papers,
But nothing to be read.

And there was Mr. Turner's Ben,
Who heard the children spell,
And picked the words right up by heart,
And learned to read 'em well.

Well, the Northern folks kept sending
The Yankee teachers down;
And they stood right up and helped us,
Though Rebs did sneer and frown.

And I longed to read my Bible,
For precious words it said;
But when I begun to learn it,
Folks just shook their heads,

And said there is no use trying,
Oh! Chloe, you're too late;
But as I was rising sixty,
I had no time to wait.

So I got a pair of glasses,
And straight to work I went,
And never stopped till I could read
The hymns and Testament.

Then I got a little cabin
A place to call my own -
And I felt as independent

The book is read
Knowledge is earned
It should be applied in works
To be benefited worldwide, 

A well movie is watched
Practicality is learned
It should be applied in practical life
For self and social betterment, 

A new place is visited
New vision is obtained
It should be utilized
For amendment and perfection, 

A new locality is met
New experience is gained
Its well sides should be taken
For new generation. 

Maybe we need not to forget, 
Is our life just too easy, 
Can our goals be met? 

We worry about others, 
Isn't that their problem? 

Can we simply just set by while they take another? 
At first they came for others? 

Now, they cry is they are coming after us! 

Give them a day, a month or year or two, 
They surely will be coming after you! 

You can't forget to mention this, 
What really happened with such bliss, 

To oh so many of those Jews, 
Could that really had happen as we stayed in our pews. 

We were so intent to see the light, 
That we were blinded by the darkness and their might! 

Little often, but often given, 
A prayer to two as they headed to heaven. 

To many in politics, what difference does it make, 
One or two soon becomes well over a million! 

I'm living proof, that we need not repeat or re-live the Horrors of war, 
And we can too give tribute. 

We must remember the brave few, 
The people who stood to protest the treatment of the Jew. 

One by they suffered too, 
Put in camps, 
And killed, 
They suffered so we might live. 

Now, today when you study, 
Learn what inhumanity does to the human body? Look what hatered does to man 
Do this so this problem will never surface again. 

THEY have taken the ball of earth
    and made it a little thing.

They were held to the land and horses;
    they were held to the little seas.
They have changed and shaped and welded;
    they have broken the old tools and made
    new ones; they are ranging the white
    scarves of cloudland; they are bumping
    the sunken bells of the Carthaginians
    and Phœnicians:
              they are handling
              the strongest sea
              as a thing to be handled.

The earth was a call that mocked;
    it is belted with wires and meshed with
    steel; from Pittsburg to Vladivostok is
    an iron ride on a moving house; from
    Jerusalem to Tokyo is a reckoned span;
    and they talk at night in the storm and
    salt, the wind and the war.

They have counted the miles to the Sun
    and Canopus; they have weighed a small
    blue star that comes in the southeast
    corner of the sky on a foretold errand.

We shall search the sea again.
We shall search the stars again.
There are no bars across the way.
There is no end to the plan and the clue,
    the hunt and the thirst.
The motors are drumming, the leather leggings
    and the leather coats wait:
                        Under the sea
                        and out to the stars
                        we go. 

There is no one to blame
if nothing is the same 
that one day
you decided to go the other way
 
You left me in pain
I stood there in shame


On your way back, leave a print
That has a flavour of mint
Don't run away
Because you may one day
Tell us good bye
Do only good 
With the nice and the rude
Be healthy, have character
Without stress, without anger
Smile and think positive
We don't know if we longer live"I know the art, how to win a heart, 
Off course, it should be a heart, 
That beats on the waves of music, 
May be of a maid who is dancing with me, 
With a mask on her face, 
But the smiling eyes reflect its grace."

The two were dancing on the dim lighted floor, 
In her maiden date she was excited and amazed, 
Many times she tried but she could not ask, 
To remove the mask and expose his face, 
But a wave she felt throughout within her, 
She could not understand the change in her.

The happy new year’s night when left for the heaven, 
She said to the boy, "My heart is still beating in my bosom, 
You could not steal, I’m sorry for your failure."
The boy too had a mask on his face, 
His eyes smiled and replied to her eyes, 
"My magic is silent, may conquer the skies."

"Your heart is with me, I have exchanged the hearts, 
Go to your bed room, a fairy will come, 
With a maiden dream that will recur many nights, 
She will let you show my heart and your name, 
Scripted with a note, I love you sweetheart, 
And you love me, too, now we cannot depart."

The boy could not forget that girl, 
A few years passed he was now married, 
In the wedding night he confessed to the bride, 
An innocent fairy in a white bridal dress, 
You are not my first love, his story he narrated, 
Exactly how it happened, not exaggerated.

The clever bride thought a few seconds, 
Looked in the restless eyes of the groom, 
Hugged him and said, "It was me, 
By now I lived with your heart in my bosom."
The boy kissed the girl and she found, 
Unlike wedding kiss, more warm and sound! 

Was the bride a liar, what do you say? 
They are living happily, leave it, anyway

Leave me a place underground, a labyrinth,
where I can go, when I wish to turn,
without eyes, without touch,
in the void, to dumb stone,
or the finger of shadow.

I know that you cannot, no one, no thing
can deliver up that place, or that path,
but what can I do with my pitiful passions,
if they are no use, on the surface
of everyday life,
if I cannot look to survive,
except by dying, going beyond, entering
into the state, metallic and slumbering, 
of primeval flame

Leave me alone
Sleepless nights
Becomes boring
And roaring.

Smell of blue roses
Yet to come in
with sweet memories
Canvased secretly.

Sweet kisses
smashed me down
On the peak of emotion
Covered with pale petals 

Leave me alone
To remember the past
And swinging on the verge
Of a well digged  in desert


Leave me, my blamer, 
For the sake of the love 
Which unites your soul with 
That of your beloved one; 
For the sake of that which 
Joins spirit with mothers 
Affection, and ties your 
Heart with filial love. Go, 
And leave me to my own 
Weeping heart. 


Let me sail in the ocean of 
My dreams; Wait until Tomorrow 
Comes, for tomorrow is free to 
Do with me as he wishes. Your 
Laying is naught but shadow 
That walks with the spirit to 
The tomb of abashment, and shows 
Heard the cold, solid earth. 


I have a little heart within me 
And I like to bring him out of 
His prison and carry him on the 
Palm of my hand to examine him 
In depth and extract his secret. 
Aim not your arrows at him, lest 
He takes fright and vanish 'ere he 
Pours the secrets blood as a 
Sacrifice at the altar of his 
Own faith, given him by Deity 
When he fashioned him of love and beauty. 


The sun is rising and the nightingale 
Is singing, and the myrtle is 
Breathing its fragrance into space. 
I want to free myself from the 
Quilted slumber of wrong. Do not 
Detain me, my blamer! 


Cavil me not by mention of the 
Lions of the forest or the 
Snakes of the valley, for 
Me soul knows no fear of earth and 
Accepts no warning of evil before 
Evil comes. 


Advise me not, my blamer, for 
Calamities have opened my heart and 
Tears have cleanses my eyes, and 
Errors have taught me the language 
Of the hearts. 


Talk not of banishment, for conscience 
Is my judge and he will justify me 
And protect me if I am innocent, and 
Will deny me of life if I am a criminal. 


Love's procession is moving; 
Beauty is waving her banner; 
Youth is sounding the trumpet of joy; 
Disturb not my contrition, my blamer. 
Let me walk, for the path is rich 
With roses and mint, and the air 
Is scented with cleanliness. 


Relate not the tales of wealth and
Greatness, for my soul is rich 


Speak not of peoples and laws and 
Kingdoms, for the whole earth is 
My birthplace and all humans are 
My brothers. 


Go from me, for you are taking away 
Life - giving repentance and bringing 
Needless words. 

Leave me, O love which reachest but to dust,
And thou, my mind, aspire to higher things;
Grow rich in that which never taketh rust:
Whatever fades but fading pleasure brings.
Draw in thy beams, and humble all thy might
To that sweet yoke where lasting freedoms be,
Which breaks the clouds and opens forth the light
That doth both shine and give us sight to see.
O, take fast hold; let that light be thy guide
In this small course which birth draws out to death,
And think how evil becometh him to slide
Who seeketh heaven, and comes of heavenly breath.
Then farewell, world! thy uttermost I see:
Eternal Love, maintain thy life in me. 

build me a poem like a Japanese house
stark black words set against
crisp white paper wall

elaborate phrases eliminate 
rhetorical excess dismiss
shoes left outside
 
clear minded
direct 
pure


I do not know where either of us can turn 
Just at first, waking from the sleep of each other. 
I do not know how we can bear 
The river struck by the gold plummet of the moon, 
Or many trees shaken together in the darkness. 
We shall wish not to be alone 
And that love were not dispersed and set free— 
Though you defeat me, 
And I be heavy upon you. 

But like earth heaped over the heart 
Is love grown perfect. 
Like a shell over the beat of life 
Is love perfect to the last. 
So let it be the same 
Whether we turn to the dark or to the kiss of another; 
Let us know this for leavetaking, 
That I may not be heavy upon you, 
That you may blind me no more. 

Leave this chanting and singing and telling of beads! 
Whom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut? 

He is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground 
and where the pathmaker is breaking stones. 
He is with them in sun and in shower, 
and his garment is covered with dust. 
Put off thy holy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil! 

Deliverance? 
Where is this deliverance to be found? 
Our master himself has joyfully taken upon him the bonds of creation; 
he is bound with us all for ever. 

Come out of thy meditations and leave aside thy flowers and incense! 
What harm is there if thy clothes become tattered and stained? 
Meet him and stand by him in toil and in sweat of thy brow. 

may you learn faster than we did
how fast Time can run off the pages of your readers
trailing a scarlet vine

leaving the winds in its wake and
you can wake to find all fairy tales departed.
oh my hearts, my valentines

outstretched, your hands in winter time I see
where the windows have vanished where
your coloured pencils shone

on little portraits taped there and the glow of them
more than stained glass
what is the past did any child ever ask did we even

hear the word or were our ears stopped up with snow
by our better angels pending the time to go

you are the air the fills me with the
breath of life and the energy that fuels
each day.
So may its bar, so may its wood;
But unless you put the right thing to its root
It never will show much flower or fruit.

But I may be one who does not care
Ever to have tree bloom or bear.
Leaves for smooth and bark for rough,
Leaves and bark may be tree enough.

Some giant trees have bloom so small
They might as well have none at all.
Late in life I have come on fern.
Now lichens are due to have their turn.

I bade men tell me which in brief,
Which is fairer, flower or leaf.
They did not have the wit to say,
Leaves by night and flowers by day.

Leaves and bar, leaves and bark,
To lean against and hear in the dark.
Petals I may have once pursued.
Leaves are all my darker mood. 

Morning! 
Leaves are falling
Scattered on the road.
Leaves are red but the road is black
Both have its own color
May be beauty too! 
Black always attracts the red
OR
Red turns to the black
I don’t know.
But it is so, or so it seems
---------------

-------------- 

Leaves in the arms of the tree
And life in the arms of the UNKNOWN
Are more gay.
But
Why then they want to fall? 
I don’t know.
But it is so, Or so it seems. 

I'm living
Forgetful of the world
By which I'm forgotten.
I'm living in my world
Which is  full of tall grass
And not so  wide
For it's my back yard.

Sitting here listening
To the whistling wind
And seeing the leaves
Being carried away
I realise
That one day
Death will come
And carry me away

Just like that
Like the leaves in the wind. 

In the part of, Leaves of Grass [Faces], the poet as a super tramp
Tries to see, mark and read the faces of the people, 
Life is but face-reading
And the faces themselves revealing it, 
What is it in one’s mind, 
Heart and soul.

Human face and mind change with during
Friendship, precision, caution, suavity, ideality, 
Changing as per the nature of work
And one’s own profession, 
Human behaviour too changing it
In change of situation, place, time and circumstance.

The face in full regard and respect, 
The face in vengeance, 
In song, dance and merriment, 
Going through the phase of ugliness, 
The infant’s sacred face, 
The artist’s to know and feel them, 
The hunter, the weaver, the fisherman.

While striding along the pavement or moving in the ferry, 
He comes to mark and read and notice
The myriad character of men, 
The melodious character of earth, 
Which philosophy too cannot reach beyond that finish and end, 
The justified mother of men


Not all can leave a legacy of money, real estate, or famous works of art.
Some legacies are products of emotions such as love and caring from ones heart.
My personal financial legacy will be small unless my wife dies first, 
and even then it will not come near to matching that of William Randolph Hearst.
From my parents I received some love, good genes, and a little dough.

When I leave you postcode and your commuting station,
When I left undone all the things we planned to do
You may feel you have been left by association
But there is leaving and leaving you.

When I leave your town and the club that you belong to,
When I leave without much warning or much regret,
Remember, there's doing wrong and there's doing wrong to
You, which I'll never do and I haven't yet,

And when I have gone, remember that in weighing
Everything up, from love to a cheaper rent,
You were all the reasons I thought of staying,
And none of the reasons why I went

And although I leave your sight and I leave your setting,
And our separation is soon to be a fact,
Though you stand beside what I'm leaving and forgetting,
I'm not leaving you, not if motive makes the act. 

Leaving dreadful, 
ah, it's so blissful.
Taking me away from all this stress.
Finally, I'll get some rest! 

Leaving dreadful, and never looking back, 
leaving for good at that's a fact.
Going back home, 
where I can be alone.

Leaving dreadful 
Leaving Dreadful
oh how peaceful
oh how blissful. 

What kind of a being? Has left us in extra tension
Abnormal in thinking, sensation and motion, 
Lives on ready food but chews fresh bloody flesh
Dissatisfied with peace so lives in high clash, 
Claims having sanity and being perfect by the age
But in saying and doing is fully wicked and childish. 

It always makes its way
Back into my mind
As if leaving is straying
And it must be mine

The thought eats me up
And makes me wonder
If I am not good enough
To have the love of another

I know it's not true
But it's hard to think differently
When I'm always looking for someone new
To fill the void inside of me

I can't place my finger
On what it could be
But it always seems to linger
I just want to be free

Free from the anger and worry
That I will be alone forever
And it's still lurking
In my mind leaving never


Coming out with your clutch of postcards
in a Tate gallery bag and another clutch
of images packed into your head you pause
on the steps to look across the river

and there's a new one: light bright buildings,
a streak of brown water, and such a sky
you wonder who painted it - Constable? No:
too brilliant. Crome? No: too ecstatic -

a madly pure Pre-Raphaelite sky,
perhaps, sheer blue apart from the white plumes
rushing up it (today, that is,
April. Another day would be different

but it wouldn't matter. All skies work.)
Cut to the lower right for a detail:
seagulls pecking on mud, below
two office blocks and a Georgian terrace.

Now swing to the left, and take in plane-trees
bobbled with seeds, and that brick building,
and a red bus.  

Cut it off just there,
by the lamp-post. Leave the scaffolding in.

That's your next one. Curious how
these outdoor pictures didn't exist
before you'd looked at the indoor pictures,
the ones on the walls. But here they are now,

marching out of their panorama
and queuing up for the viewfinder
your eye's become. You can isolate them
by holding your optic muscles still.

You can zoom in on figure studies
(that boy with the rucksack), or still lives,
abstracts, townscapes. No one made them.
The light painted them. You're in charge

of the hanging committee. Put what space
you like around the ones you fix on,
and gloat. Art multiplies itself.
Art's whatever you choose to frame. 

White King City I left at dawn
       in the morning-glow of the clouds;
The thousand miles to Chiang-ling
       we sailed in a single day.
On either shore the gibbons' chatter
       sounded without pause
While my light boat skimmed past
       ten thousand sombre crags. 

i have to leave you again
not for long, but right now
tears that fill my eyes
pain that takes over my chest
loneliness that runs through my brain
 
i have to leave you again
watching you, watch me leave
makes me so sad
as i stare at photos, 
to remember what we had
 
you were so used to waking up to me, 
my smile, 
my spirit, 
this isn't for long, but i know it hurts you, 
just as it hurts me too
 
miles that separate us
through people who should repatriate us
is me who appreciates us
 
i'm sorry i have to leave you again
i hope you are here, 
when i come back


Gone are they the lost camps, light flittings, long sojournings
in Miná, in Gháula, Rijám left how desolate.
Lost are they. Rayyán lies lorn with its white torrent beds,
scored in lines like writings left by the flood--water.
Tent--floors smooth, forsaken, bare of all that dwelt in them,
years how long, the war--months, months too of peace--pleasures.
Spots made sweet with Spring--rains fresh--spilled from the Zodiac,
showers from clouds down--shaken, wind--wracks and thunder--clouds;
Clouds how wild of night--time, clouds of the dawn darkening,
clouds of the red sunset,--all speak the name of her.

Here, in green thorn--thickets, does bring forth how fearlessly;
here the ostrich--troops come, here too the antelopes.
Wild cows, with their wild calf--sucklings, standing over them,
while their weanlings wander wide in the bare valleys.
Clean--swept lie their hearth--stones, white as a new manuscript
writ with texts fresh--graven, penned by the cataracts,
Scored with lines and circles, limned with rings and blazonings,
as one paints a maid's cheek point--lined in indigo.
All amazed I stood there. How should I make questionings?
Dumb the rocks around me, silent the precipice,
Voices lost, where these dwelt who at dawn abandoning
tent and thorn--bush fencing fled to the wilderness.
Now thy sad heart acheth, grieveth loud remembering
girls how closely howdahed, awned with what canopies.
Every howdah curtained, lined with gauze embroideries,
figured with festoons hung red from the pole of it.
Trooped they there the maid--folk, wild white cows of Tudiha,
ay, or does of Wujra, long--necked, their fawns with them,
Fled as the miráge flees, fills the vale of Bishata,
fills the tree--cladwádies, ithel and rock--mazes.

What of her, Nowára, thy lost love, who fled from thee,
every heart--link sundered, close loop and free fetter!
Hers the Morra camp--fires lit how far in Fáïda,
in Hejáz what marches! How shalt thou win to her?
Eastward move they marching, to Muhájjer wandering
Southward on to Yemen, to Soweyk their sojournings,
to Waháf el Káhri, ay, and Tilkhám of it.
Man, have done! forget her, one too far to comfort thee!
Who would his love garner first let him sunder it.
Shed the love that fails thee. Strong be thou, and break with her.
Keep thy gifts for friendship, freed from thy wilderment.
Mount thee on thy nága. Travel--trained and hard she is,
low her back withleanness, lessened the hump of her;
Shrunk her sides and wasted, jaded with long journeyings,
spare as her hide shoe--straps frayed by her road--faring.
Light she to her halter, to thy hand that guideth her,
as a red cloud southwards loosed from its rain--burden.
Nay a fair wild--ass she; at her side the white--flanked one,
he the scarred ass--stallion, bitten and struck for her.
Climbed they two the hill--top, he the bite--scarred ass--tyrant
her new mood resenting, being in foal to him
On the crags high posted watcheth he from Thálabut
all the plain to guard her, ambushes laid for her.
Six months of Jumáda wandered have they waterless,
browsing the moist herbage, he her high sentinel.
Till returned their thirsting, need of the far water clefts,
all their will to win there speeding them waterwards.
What though with heels wounded, still the hot wind driveth them,
as a furnace burning, fire--scorched the breath of it.
In their trail a dust--cloud, like a smoke it wavereth,
like a fire new--lighted, kindling the flame of it,
Flame fanned by the North--wind, green wood mixed with dry fuel,
smoke aloft high curling. So is the dust of them.
He, when her pace slackened, pushed her still in front of him.
Nay, she might not falter, tyrant he urged her on,
Till they reached the streamlet, plunged and slaked their thirst in it,
A spring welling over, crest--high the reeds of it;
All its banks a cane--brake, thick with stems o'ershadowing;
bent are some, some standing, night--deep the shade of them.

Say is this her likeness? Or a wild cow wolf--raided
of her sweet calf loitering, she in the van of them.
She, the short--nosed, missed it. Lows she now unendingly,
roams the rocks, the sand--drifts, mourning and bellowing,
Lows in rage beholding that white shape, the limbs of it,
dragged by the grey wolf--cubs: who shall their hunger stay?
Theirs the chance to seize it, hers the short forgetfulness.
Death is no mean archer. Mark how his arrows hit.
Stopped she then at night--fall, while the rain in long furrows
scored the bush--grown hill--slopes, ceaseless the drip of it,
Dripped on her dark back--line, poured abroad abundantly:
not a star the heaven showed, cloud--hung the pall of it;
One tree all her shelter, standing broad--branched, separate
at the sand--hills' edge--line, steep--set the sides of them.
She, the white cow, shone there through the dark night luminous,
like a pearl of deep--seas, freed from the string of it.
Thus till morn, till day--dawn folded back night's canopy;
then she fled bewildered, sliding the feet of her,
Fled through the rain lakelets, to the pool Suwáyada,
all a seven nights' fasting twinned with the days of them,
Till despaired she wholly, till her udder milk--stricken
shrank, so full to feed him suckling or weaning him.
Voices now she hears near, human tones, they startle her,
though to her eye naught is: Man! he, the bane of her!
Seeketh a safe issue, the forenoon through listening,
now in front, behind now, fearing her enemy.
And they failed, the archers. Loosed they then to deal with her
fine--trained hounds, the lop--eared, slender the sides of them.
These outran her lightly. Turned she swift her horns on them,
like twin spears of Sámhar, sharp--set the points of them.
Well she knew her danger, knew if her fence failed with them
hers must be thered death. Hence her wrath's strategy.
And she slew Kasábi, foremost hound of all of them,
Thus is she, my nága. When at noon the plains quiver
and the hills dance sun--steeped, cloaked in the heat--tremors,
Ride I and my deeds do, nor forbear from wantoning,
lest the fools should shame me, blame me the fault--finders.

Do not thou misprize me, thou Nowára. One am I
binder of all love--knots, ay, and love's sunderer;
One who when love fails him, wails not long but flies from it;
one whom one alone holds, hard death the hinderer.
What dost thou of mirth know, glorious nights, ah, how many:
cold nor heat might mar them, spent in good company?
Came I thus discoursing to his sign, the wine--seller's,
drank at the flag--hoisting, drank till the wine grew dear,
Bidding up each full skin: black with age the brand of it,
pouring forth the tarred jars, breaking the seals of them;
Pure deep draughts of morning, while she played, the sweet singer
fingering the lute--strings, showing her skill to me.
Ere the cock had crowed once, a first cup was quaffed by me:
ere slow man had stretched him, gone was the second cup.
On what dawns sharp--winded clothed have I the cold with it,
dawns that held the North--wind reined in the hands of them.
Well have I my tribe served, brought them aid and armament,
slept, my mare's reins round me, night--long their sentinel;
Ridden forth at day--dawn, climbed the high--heaped sand--ridges
hard by the foe'smarches, dun--red the slopes of them;
Watched till the red sun dipped hand--like in obscurity,
till the night lay curtained, shrouding our weaknesses;
And I came down riding, my mare's neck held loftily
as a palm fruit--laden: woe to the gatherer!
Swift was she, an ostrich; galloped she how wrathfully,
from her sides the sweat streamed, lightening the ribs of her;
Strained on her her saddle; dripped with wet the neck of her,
the white foam--flakes wreathing, edging the girth of her;
Thrusteth her neck forward, shaketh her reins galloping;
flieth as the doves fly bound for the water--springs.

At the King's Court strangers thronged from what far provinces,
each athirst for bounty, fearing indignity.
Stiff--necked they as lions in their hate, the pride of them,
came with stubborn proud feet, Jinns of the wilderness.
Stopped I their vain boastings, took no ill--tongued words from them,
let them not take licence. What were their chiefs to me?
I it was provided camels for their slaughtering,
I who their shares portioned, drawing the lots for them.
Every mouth I feasted. Barren mount and milch--camel
slew I for all daily. All shared the meat of them.
Far guest and near neighbour, every man rose satisfied,
full as in Tebála, fed as in green valleys.
Ay, the poor my tent filled, thin poor souls like sick--camels,
nágas at a tomb tied, bare--backed, no shirt on them.
Loud the winter winds howled; piled we high the meat--dishes;
flowed the streams of fatness, feeding the fatherless.
Thus the tribes were trysted; nor failed we the provident
to name one, a wiseman, fair--tongued, as judge for them,
One who the spoil portioned, gave to each his just measure,
spake to all unfearing, gave or refused to give,
A just judge, a tribe--sheykh, wise, fair--worded, bountiful,
sweet of face to all men, feared by the warriors.

Noble we; our fathers wielded power bequeathed to them,
dealt law to the nations, each tribe its lawgiver.
All our lineage faultless, no light words our promises;
not for us the vain thoughts, passions of common men.
hold it a gift granted, dealt thee in equity.
Loyalty our gift was, faith unstained our heritage;
these fair things He gave us, He the distributor.
For for us a mansion built He, brave the height of it,
lodged therein our old men, ay, and the youths of us,
All that bore our burdens, all in our tribe's sore sorrow,
all that were our horsemen, all our high councillors.
Like the Spring are these men, joy to them that wait on them,
to the weak, the widows, towers in adversity.
Thus our kin stands faith--firm, purged of tribe--malingerers.
Woe be to all false friends! Woe to the envious

PLACE. -- A small alcove with dark curtains.
The class consists of one member.
SUBJECT. -- Thomson’s Mirror Galvanometer.


The lamp-light falls on blackened walls, 
And streams through narrow perforations, 
The long beam trails o’er pasteboard scales, 
With slow-decaying oscillations. 
Flow, current, flow, set the quick light-spot flying, 
Flow current, answer light-spot, flashing, quivering, dying,

O look! how queer! how thin and clear, 
And thinner, clearer, sharper growing 
The gliding fire! with central wire, 
The fine degrees distinctly showing. 
Swing, magnet, swing, advancing and receding, 
Swing magnet! Answer dearest, What's your final reading?

O love! you fail to read the scale 
Correct to tenths of a division. 
To mirror heaven those eyes were given, 
And not for methods of precision. 
Break contact, break, set the free light-spot flying; 
Break contact, rest thee, magnet, swinging, creeping, dying.

Professor Chrschtschonovitsch, Ph. 

D., "On the C. G. S. system of Units

"
Remarks submitted to the Lecturer by a student.


Prim Doctor of Philosophy 
Front academic Heidelberg! 
Your sum of vital energy 
Is not the millionth of an erg. 
Your liveliest motion might be reckoned 
At one-tenth metre in a second. 
"The air," you said, in language fine, 
Which scientific thought expresses, 
"The air -- which with a megadyne, 
On each square centimetre presses -- 
The air, and I may add the ocean, 
Are nought but molecules in motion
 


Atoms, you told me, were discrete, 
Than you they could not be discreter, 
Who know how many Millions meet 
Within a cubic millimetre. 
They clash together as they fly, 
But you! -- you cannot tell me why. 

And when in tuning my guitar 
The interval would not come right, 
"This string," you said, "is strained too far, 
’Tis forty dynes, at least too tight!" 
And then you told me, as I sang, 
What overtones were in my clang. 

You gabbled on, but every phrase 
Was stiff with scientific shoddy, 
The only song you deigned to praise 
Was "Gin a body meet a body," 
"And even there," you said, "collision 
Was not described with due precision
 


"In the invariable plane," 
You told me, "lay the impulsive couple
 

You seized my hand -- you gave me pain, 
By torsion of a wrist so supple; 
You told me what that wrench would do, -- 
"’Twould set me twisting round a screw
 


Were every hair of every tress 
(Which you, no doubt, imagine mine), 
Drawn towards you with its breaking stress -- 
A stress, say, of a megadyne, 
That tension I would sooner suffer 
Than meet again with such a duffer

Mrs. Schaffer, 
You've helped me so much, 
Now it's my turn, 
But I don't know how, 
I’m such a clutz.

I needed you so much, 
As the child I am, 
You have done that so well, 
To make the man I am.

I'll need you later, 
Then you won't be there, 
I'll be so sad, 
I pray for your care.

Now I’ve told you, 
Just what I think, 
That you’re so nice, 
I don't want to blink. 

Leedle Dutch baby haff come ter town!
Jabber und jump till der day gone down--
Jabber und sphlutter und sphlit hees jaws--

Hey! Leedle Dutchman come ter town

without me you will have nothing but torment and mischief 
go on and leave me renounce your belief
anyway our tree has only one leaf
it is one of sadness one of grief
stolen from heaven by an honest thief

but god sent an angel to my way
to punish me and take it away
i fought him so he made it decay
you hadn`t stood by me so together we couldn`t stay

As much as I loved you No one would do
anything could be false but my love is true


Oh, heckling thinkers! 
Oh, inverted intellectuals! 
Be you left or right
Sling not mud at each other
Waste not, your chaste anger

Eager, both you are
To offer this world due comfort
Two sides of uncut
One whole you are; our bolsters
Why fight?  Mistreading stalwarts! 

Stretch your great peers
There! On that deserving rout
Of wolves rambling out
Eating vitals of State to core
Breeding hatred and squalor

No signets they bear
Of nation; just bandicoots
In our closets! 
Cut their throats! Yes! No remorse
Ere they get to roots and bore


In the forest wild
my footprints I lost
In the world of music
I stood a discordant pieceno crunches
no bakery lunches
party pubs are flowering
hotels are flavoury
malls are full of cakes
and kitchens are all bakes
yet the street dog is starving
no single bite for the poor thing.

poor street dog
they stoned it
it is now limping
added rain is pouring
and pain is imploring
it is starving, a baby it has got, with it
be kind and gracious and give the street dogs bun bits.

standing for the temple doors to log
when you give bun bits to dogs
please give me nothing, take my life
I am too tired to tolerate this strife. 

Unto my friends I give my thoughts, 
Unto my foe I leave my love– 
These are of life the whole. 
Nay, there is something–a trifle–left; 
Who shall receive this dower? 
See, Earth Mother, a handful of dust– 
Turn it into a flower. 

her grandmother called her from the playground   
       "yes, ma'am" 
       "i want chu to learn how to make rolls" said the old   
woman proudly 
but the little girl didn't want 
to learn how because she knew 
even if she couldn't say it that 
that would mean when the old one died she would be less   
dependent on her spirit so 
she said 
       "i don't want to know how to make no rolls" 
with her lips poked out 
and the old woman wiped her hands on 
her apron saying "lord 
       these children" 
and neither of them ever 
said what they meant 
and i guess nobody ever does


One day back in my time
Milk at school only cost a dime
Angry lunch ladies here were rare
They loved all the kids, each the same
For recess we played ball and jacks
Then went to class to learn like you
Made friends and played in the yard next door
I sometimes wonder where time has gone. 

As silent as a mirror is believed
Realities plunge in silence by . . .

I am not ready for repentance;
Nor to match regrets.  For the moth
Bends no more than the still
Imploring flame.  And tremorous
In the white falling flakes
Kisses are,--
The only worth all granting.

It is to be learned--
This cleaving and this burning,
But only by the one who 
Spends out himself again.

Twice and twice
(Again the smoking souvenir,
Bleeding eidolon!) and yet again.
Until the bright logic is won
Unwhispering as a mirror
Is believed.

Then, drop by caustic drop, a perfect cry
Shall string some constant harmony,--
Relentless caper for all those who step
The legend of their youth into the noon.



The blacksmith's boy went out with a rifle
and a black dog running behind.
Cobwebs snatched at his feet,
rivers hindered him,
thorn branches caught at his eyes to make him blind
and the sky turned into an unlucky opal,
but he didn't mind.
I can break branches, I can swim rivers, I can stare out 
any spider I meet,
said he to his dog and his rifle.

The blacksmith's boy went over the paddocks
with his old black hat on his head.
Mountains jumped in his way,
rocks rolled down on him,
and the old crow cried, You'll soon be dead.
And the rain came down like mattocks.
But he only said,
I can climb mountains, I can dodge rocks, I can shoot an old crow any day,
and he went on over the paddocks.

When he came to the end of the day, the sun began falling,
Up came the night ready to swallow him,
like the barrel of a gun,
like an old black hat,
like a black dog hungry to follow him.
Then the pigeon, the magpie and the dove began wailing
and the grass lay down to pillow him.
His rifle broke, his hat blew away and his dog was gone and the sun was falling.

But in front of the night, the rainbow stood on the mountain,
just as his heart foretold.
He ran like a hare, 
he climbed like a fox;
he caught it in his hands, the colours and the cold - 
like a bar of ice, like the column of a fountain,
like a ring of gold.
The pigeon, the magpie and the dove flew up to stare,
and the grass stood up again on the mountain.

The blacksmith's boy hung the rainbow on his shoulder
instead of his broken gun.
Lizards ran out to see, snakes made way for him,
and the rainbow shone as brightly as the sun.
All the world said, Nobody is braver, nobody is bolder,
nobody else has done
anything equal to it. He went home as easy as could be
with the swinging rainbow on his shoulder. 

Omaha, Nebraska They do not sleep nights
but stand between

rows of glowing corn and
cabbages grown on acres past

the edge of the city.
Surrendered flags,

their nightgowns furl and
unfurl around their legs.

Only women could be this
white. Like mules,

they are sterile
and it appears that

their mouths are always
open. Because they are thin

as weeds, the albinos
look hungry. If you drive out

to the farm, tree branches will
point the way. No map will show

where, no phone is listed.
It will seem that the moon, plump

above their shoulders, is constant,
orange as harvest all year

long. We say, when a mother
gives birth to an albino girl,

she feigns sleep after
labor while an Asian

man steals in, spirits
the pale baby away.

A MAN builded a bugle for the storms to blow. 
The focused winds hurled him afar. 
He said that the instrument was a failure.

        II

When the suicide arrived at the sky, the people there asked him: "Why?" 
He replied: "Because no one admired me


        III

A man said: "Thou tree!" 
The tree answered with the same scorn: "Thou man! 
Thou art greater than I only in thy possibilities


        IV

A warrior stood upon a peak and defied the stars. 
A little magpie, happening there, desired the soldier's plume, and so plucked it.

The wind that waves the blossoms sang, sang, sang from age to age. 
The flowers were made curious by this joy. 
"Oh, wind," they said, "why sing you at your labour, while we, pink beneficiaries, sing not, but idle, idle, idle from age to age?"CLOWNS DYINGFIVE circus clowns dying this year, morning newspapers told their lives, how each one horizontal in a last gesture of hands arranged by an undertaker, shook thousands into convulsions of laughter from behind rouge-red lips and powder-white face.

STEAMBOAT BILLWhen the boilers of the Robert E. Lee exploded, a steamboat winner of many races on the Mississippi went to the bottom of the river and never again saw the wharves of Natchez and New Orleans.
And a legend lives on that two gamblers were blown toward the sky and during their journey laid bets on which of the two would go higher and which would be first to set foot on the turf of the earth again.

FOOT AND MOUTH PLAGUEWhen the mysterious foot and mouth epidemic ravaged the cattle of Illinois, Mrs. Hector Smith wept bitterly over the government killing forty of her soft-eyed Jersey cows; through the newspapers she wept over her loss for millions of readers in the Great Northwest.

SEVENSThe lady who has had seven lawful husbands has written seven years for a famous newspaper telling how to find love and keep it: seven thousand hungry girls in the Mississippi Valley have read the instructions seven years and found neither illicit loves nor lawful husbands.

PROFITEERI who saw ten strong young men die anonymously, I who saw ten old mothers hand over their sons to the nation anonymously, I who saw ten thousand touch the sunlit silver finalities of undistinguished human glory-why do I sneeze sardonically at a bronze drinking fountain named after one who participated in the war vicariously and bought ten farms

Shattered and fragmented
Thoughts were scattered illusions
Blown away by the wind
The thousand miles I crossed
To out run my demons

But each mile is an eternity
When I know there’s an angel calling
And all the unknowns
Just make eternity
Two lifetimes
Too long

And the days pass
While I slumber
You could watch over me
If we were things of legend
But we’re just mortals
With immortal shine
Lingering in our eyes

I watch the pen flow
I look as the words form
There’s colors forming your picture
In the forefront of my mind
And the music plays
You dance a ballet
You don’t know the steps to

The beauty of fragment thought
Like when we use fragment words
To describe bigger words
And the beauty
Of our common personalities
Is we’re okay with that

And I look at my hands
While I think of you
Vascular tanned long structures 
Random thought process
Whether you’d like them 
Or not

Want to listen to your voice again
As I look up at the stars
But youre too far away to know

Im wishing on them tonight


Yes, pile the marble o'er him! It is well
That ye who mocked him in his long stern strife,
And planted in the pathway of his life
The ploughshares of your hatred hot from hell,
Who clamored down the bold reformer when
He pleaded for his captive fellow-men,
Who spurned him in the market-place, and sought
Within thy walls, St. Tammany, to bind
In party chains the free and honest thought,
The angel utterance of an upright mind,
Well is it now that o'er his grave ye raise
The stony tribute of your tardy praise,
For not alone that pile shall tell to Fame
Of the brave heart beneath, but of the builders' shame

Why shout? 
When speaking suffices

Shoved by our votes
Our hopes and trust
You reached this House
This isn’t an inn of ale
To blabber and revel
Nor a plunderers’ market
To vandalize public’s nickel
This is a thicket of think tank
Where you have to meditate
Mediate and modulate
Variegated vox populi
And decide our fates 

Why shout? 
When speaking suffices


Let's build like high rated heroes

Let's construct intact with elevated egos

Let's build a house, a boat and a truck

Tick, tock - knock, knock

Lego is fun and it always rocks

 

Bricks and blocks

Doors without locks

Cars, ships, ports and docks

Tick, tock - knock, knock

With Lego we always build without, stones and rocks

 

Today or tomorrow, Girls and Boys

We can carefully configure these wonderful toys

With colourful bricks, mini-pieces and mini-figures

Lego is the way to follow

Build in groups or build solo

Friends, aunties, uncles and nieces

Assemble, break and reassemble pieces

 

Tick, tock - knock, knock - talk, talk

Lego, What do we have in stock? 

Tick, tock - knock, knock - work, work

Lego, lets stop the cheap talk! 

Let's all construct until we hit a stumbling block! 


The fireflies light the soundless panther's way 
To tangled paths where shy gazelles are straying, 
And parrot-plumes outshine the dying day. 
O soft! the lotus-buds upon the stream 
Are stirring like sweet maidens when they dream. 


A caste-mark on the azure brows of Heaven, 
The golden moon burns sacred, solemn, bright 
The winds are dancing in the forest-temple, 
And swooning at the holy feet of Night. 
Hush! in the silence mystic voices sing 
And make the gods their incense-offering. 

What is this life if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.

No time to stand beneath the boughs
And stare as long as sheep or cows.

No time to see, when woods we pass,
Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass.

No time to see, in broad daylight,
Streams full of stars, like skies at night.

No time to turn at Beauty's glance,
And watch her feet, how they can dance.

No time to wait till her mouth can
Enrich that smile her eyes began.

A poor life this is if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare. 

It's always around February
 when I start thinking about lemons
and these thoughts rip open my wounds
that healed over the year

Over and over 
and over them lemons
 Squeezed
Though the burn dulls every time
that I think about lemons
 Like the one that ripened in my sister's skull
pushing her brains up against a wall
and consuming the space housed by thoughts
until it was all 
just 
lemons

I couldn't feel the burn that she felt
so I gave her some Advil and sent her to bed
not knowing what was growing inside of her head
until she started to lose her vision
and I became the one who couldn't see straight

Her wounds were sudden
The slice in her scalp giving new meaning to
having an open mind
and the doctors zipped it up
with roughly staples
while she dreamed of candles
and we saw them too
though in our darkest dreams they were never lit

My mom lit for me
in the hospital cafeteria where I
halfheartedly opened gifts
then went back home to where no one was waiting

I was finally old enough to lose everything
My mind, my self, my clothes
in the back of a minivan
because I thought that I was losing 
her
to lemons

My wounds came gradually
as I watched hers heal
Internalizing her pain until
she could work and I was broken
When her hair grew back I shaved mine off
on the side which grew that lemon
and I felt the doctor's knife
when she asked if it meant
that I had lemons too

We would both wake up
in the night
cold sweat
and she would come into my room
physically this time

By now she has forgotten
but I never could
because there were always more lemons
in my grandfather's stomach
in my grandmother's breast
in my nanny's cervix
in my friend's liver
in my mind

My step-grandpa became
all lemons
Only lemons

Loss of self
Then loss of life is almost a relief
Sometimes not old enough to lose everything

candles
and all I wish is that
life
would stop giving me lemons


In Nineveh 
And beyond Nineveh 
In the dusk 
They were afraid. 

In Thebes of Egypt 
In the dust 
They chanted of them to the dead. 

In my Lesbos and Achaia 
We knew them. 

Now men say "They are not": 
But in the dusk 
Ere the white sun comes -
A gay child that bears a white candle -
I am afraid of their rustling, 
Of their terrible silence, 
The menace of their secrecy. 

Ah, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!
   Let the bell toll!- a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river;
   And, Guy de Vere, hast thou no tear?- weep now or nevermore!
   See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!
   Come! let the burial rite be read- the funeral song be sung!-
   A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.

   "Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,
   And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her- that she died!
   How shall the ritual, then, be read?- the requiem how be sung
   By you- by yours, the evil eye,- by yours, the slanderous tongue
   That did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?"

   Peccavimus; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song
   The sweet Lenore hath "gone before," with Hope, that flew beside,
   Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy
        bride.
   For her, the fair and debonair, that now so lowly lies,
   The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes
   The life still there, upon her hair- the death upon her eyes.

   "Avaunt! avaunt! from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven-
   From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven-
   From grief and groan, to a golden throne, beside the King of
        Heaven!
   Let no bell toll, then,- lest her soul, amid its hallowed mirth,
   Should catch the note as it doth float up from the damned Earth!
   And I!- to-night my heart is light!- no dirge will I upraise,
   But waft the angel on her flight with a Paean of old days!"We have come home
From the bloodless wars
With sunken hearts
Our booths full of pride-
From the true massacre of the soul
When we have asked
‘What does it cost
To be loved and left alone'

We have come home
Bringing the pledge
Which is written in rainbow colours
Across the sky-for burial
But is not the time
To lay wreaths
For yesterday's crimes, 
Night threatens
Time dissolves
And there is no acquaintance
With tomorrow


The gurgling drums
Echo the stars
The forest howls
And between the trees
The dark sun appears.

We have come home
When the dawn falters
Singing songs of other lands
The death march
Violating our ears
Knowing all our loves and tears
Determined by the spinning coin

We have come home
To the green foothills
To drink from the cup
Of warm and mellow birdsong
‘To the hot beaches
Where the boats go out to sea
Threshing the ocean's harvest
And the hovering, plunging
Gliding gulls shower kisses on the waves

We have come home
Where through the lighting flash
And the thundering rain
The famine the drought, 
The sudden spirit
Lingers on the road
Supporting the tortured remnants of the flesh
That spirit which asks no favour of the world
But to have dignity. 

There where the dim past and future mingle
their nebulous hopes and aspirations
there I lie.

There where truth and untruth struggle
in endless and bloody combat, 
there I lie.

There where time moves forwards and backwards
with not one moment’s pause for sighing, 
there I lie.

There where the body ages relentlessly
and only the feeble mind can wander back

there I lie in open-souled amazement

There where all the opposites arrive
to plague the inner senses, but do not fuse, 
I hold my head; and then contrive
to stop the constant motion.
my head goes round and round, 
but I have not been drinking; 
I feel the buoyant waves; I stagger

It seems the world has changed her garment.
but it is I who have not crossed the fence, 
So there I lie.

There where the need for good
and "the doing good" conflict, 
there I lie. 

Primrose, anemone, bluebell, moss
Grow in the Kingdom of the Cross

And the ash-tree's purple bud
Dresses the spear that sheds his blood.

With the thorns that pierce his brow
Soft encircling petals grow

For in each flower the secret lies
Of the tree that crucifies.

Garden by the water clear
All must die who enter here

Leonainie--Angels named her;
And they took the light
Of the laughing stars and framed her
In a smile of white;
And they made her hair of gloomy
Midnight, and her eyes of bloomy
Moonshine, and they brought her to me
In the solemn night.--

In a solemn night of summer,
When my heart of gloom
Blossomed up to greet the comer
Like a rose in bloom;
All forebodings that distressed me
I forgot as Joy caressed me--
(LYING Joy! that caught and pressed me
In the arms of doom!)

Only spake the little lisper
In the Angel-tongue;
Yet I, listening, heard her whisper,--
'Songs are only sung
Here below that they may grieve you--
Tales but told you to deceive you,--
So must Leonainie leave you
While her love is young.'

Matchless and supreme
Heaven's glory seemed adorning
Earth with its esteem:
Every heart but mine seemed gifted
With the voice of prayer, and lifted
Where my Leonainie drifted
From me like a dream. 

Leopards on the gable-ends,
Leopards on the painted stair,
Stiff the blazoned shield they bear,
Or and gules, a bend of vair,
Leopards on the gable-ends,
Leopards everywhere.

Guard and vigil in the night
While the ancient house is sleeping
They three hundred years are keeping,
Nightly from their stations leaping,
Shadows black in moonlight bright,
Roof to gable creeping.

Rigid when the day returns,
Up aloft in sun or rain
Leopards at their posts again
Watch the shifting pageant's train;
And their jewelled colour burns
In the window-pane.

Often on the painted stair,
As I passed abstractedly,
Velvet footsteps, two and three,
Padded gravely after me.
- There was nothing, nothing there,
Nothing there to see. 

White founts falling in the Courts of the sun, 
    And the Soldan of Byzantium is smiling as they run; 
    There is laughter like the fountains in that face of all men feared, 
    It stirs the forest darkness, the darkness of his beard; 
    It curls the blood-red crescent, the crescent of his lips; 
    For the inmost sea of all the earth is shaken with his ships. 
    They have dared the white republics up the capes of Italy, 
    They have dashed the Adriatic round the Lion of the Sea, 
    And the Pope has cast his arms abroad for agony and loss, 
    The shadow of the Valois is yawning at the Mass; 
    From evening isles fantastical rings faint the Spanish gun, 

    Dim drums throbbing, in the hills half heard, 
    Where only on a nameless throne a crownless prince has stirred, 
    Where, risen from a doubtful seat and half attainted stall, 
    The last knight of Europe takes weapons from the wall, 
    The last and lingering troubadour to whom the bird has sung, 
    That once went singing southward when all the world was young. 
    In that enormous silence, tiny and unafraid, 
    Comes up along a winding road the noise of the Crusade. 
    Strong gongs groaning as the guns boom far, 
    Don John of Austria is going to the war, 
    Stiff flags straining in the night-blasts cold 
    In the gloom black-purple, in the glint old-gold, 
    Torchlight crimson on the copper kettle-drums, 
    Then the tuckets, then the trumpets, then the cannon, and he comes. 
    Don John laughing in the brave beard curled, 
    Spurning of his stirrups like the thrones of all the world, 
    Holding his head up for a flag of all the free. 
    Love-light of Spain--hurrah! 
    Death-light of Africa! 
    Don John of Austria 
    Is riding to the sea. 

    Mahound is in his paradise above the evening star, 
    (Don John of Austria is going to the war.) 
    He moves a mighty turban on the timeless houri's knees, 
    His turban that is woven of the sunsets and the seas. 
    He shakes the peacock gardens as he rises from his ease, 
    And he strides among the tree-tops and is taller than the trees; 
    And his voice through all the garden is a thunder sent to bring 
    Black Azrael and Ariel and Ammon on the wing. 
    Giants and the Genii, 
    Multiplex of wing and eye, 
    Whose strong obedience broke the sky 
    When Solomon was king. 

    They rush in red and purple from the red clouds of the morn, 
    From the temples where the yellow gods shut up their eyes in scorn; 
    They rise in green robes roaring from the green hells of the sea 
    Where fallen skies and evil hues and eyeless creatures be, 
    On them the sea-valves cluster and the grey sea-forests curl, 
    Splashed with a splendid sickness, the sickness of the pearl; 
    They swell in sapphire smoke out of the blue cracks of the ground,-- 
    They gather and they wonder and give worship to Mahound. 
    And he saith, "Break up the mountains where the hermit-folk can hide, 
    And sift the red and silver sands lest bone of saint abide, 
    And chase the Giaours flying night and day, not giving rest, 
    For that which was our trouble comes again out of the west. 
    We have set the seal of Solomon on all things under sun, 
    Of knowledge and of sorrow and endurance of things done. 
    But a noise is in the mountains, in the mountains, and I know 
    The voice that shook our palaces--four hundred years ago: 
    It is he that saith not 'Kismet'; it is he that knows not Fate; 
    It is he whose loss is laughter when he counts the wager worth, 
    Put down your feet upon him, that our peace be on the earth
 

    For he heard drums groaning and he heard guns jar, 
    (Don John of Austria is going to the war.) 
    Sudden and still--hurrah! 
    Bolt from Iberia! 
    Don John of Austria 
    Is gone by Alcalar. 

    St. Michaels on his Mountain in the sea-roads of the north 
    (Don John of Austria is girt and going forth.) 
    Where the grey seas glitter and the sharp tides shift 
    And the sea-folk labour and the red sails lift. 
    He shakes his lance of iron and he claps his wings of stone; 
    The noise is gone through Normandy; the noise is gone alone; 
    The North is full of tangled things and texts and aching eyes, 
    And dead is all the innocence of anger and surprise, 
    But Don John of Austria is riding to the sea. 
    Don John calling through the blast and the eclipse 
    Crying with the trumpet, with the trumpet of his lips, 
    Trumpet that sayeth ha! 
        Domino gloria! 
    Don John of Austria 
    Is shouting to the ships. 

    King Philip's in his closet with the Fleece about his neck 
    (Don John of Austria is armed upon the deck.) 
    The walls are hung with velvet that is black and soft as sin, 
    And little dwarfs creep out of it and little dwarfs creep in. 
    He holds a crystal phial that has colours like the moon, 
    He touches, and it tingles, and he trembles very soon, 
    And his face is as a fungus of a leprous white and grey 
    Like plants in the high houses that are shuttered from the day, 
    And death is in the phial and the end of noble work, 
    But Don John of Austria has fired upon the Turk. 
    Don John's hunting, and his hounds have bayed-- 
    Booms away past Italy the rumour of his raid. 
    Gun upon gun, ha! ha! 
    Gun upon gun, hurrah! 
    Don John of Austria 
    Has loosed the cannonade. 

    The Pope was in his chapel before day or battle broke, 
    (Don John of Austria is hidden in the smoke.) 
    The secret window whence the world looks small and very dear. 
    He sees as in a mirror on the monstrous twilight sea 
    The crescent of his cruel ships whose name is mystery; 
    They fling great shadows foe-wards, making Cross and Castle dark, 
    They veil the plumed lions on the galleys of St. Mark; 
    And above the ships are palaces of brown, black-bearded chiefs, 
    And below the ships are prisons, where with multitudinous griefs, 
    Like a race in sunken cities, like a nation in the mines. 
    They are lost like slaves that sweat, and in the skies of morning hung 
    The stair-ways of the tallest gods when tyranny was young. 
    They are countless, voiceless, hopeless as those fallen or fleeing on 
    Before the high Kings' horses in the granite of Babylon. 
    And many a one grows witless in his quiet room in hell 
    Where a yellow face looks inward through the lattice of his cell, 
    (But Don John of Austria has burst the battle-line!) 
    Don John pounding from the slaughter-painted poop, 
    Purpling all the ocean like a bloody pirate's sloop, 
    Scarlet running over on the silvers and the golds, 
    Breaking of the hatches up and bursting of the holds, 
    Thronging of the thousands up that labour under sea 
    White for bliss and blind for sun and stunned for liberty. 

    Vivat Hispania! 
    Domino Gloria! 
    Don John of Austria 
    Has set his people free! 

    Cervantes on his galley sets the sword back in the sheath 
    (Don John of Austria rides homeward with a wreath.) 
    And he sees across a weary land a straggling road in Spain, 
    Up which a lean and foolish knight for ever rides in vain, 
    And he smiles, but not as Sultans smile, and settles back the blade. . 
    (But Don John of Austria rides home from the Crusade.)Sitting on a toad stool at the break of dawn, 
Was an Irish Elf known as the Leprechaun.
I listened to him singing with a voice so clear, 
His praise of Nature was music to my ear.
He sung of flowers covered in morning dew, 
And of gossamer cobwebs spun in the night anew.
His voice accompanied the early birds just awake, 
Blending well with the sweet tones that they make.
The he plucked some shamrocks with four perfect leaves, 
These he placed carefully in his pockets and up his sleeves.
He sang of his good luck and his pots of gold, 
That he had been saving from the days of old.
Then he turned his head and saw my astonished look, 
I bid him good day and went on my way, 
Now that he had seen me I could not stay, 
So I returned home and wrote this little verse, 
About the Leprechaun that sung praise to the Universe. 




Poor Little Children

Mother birdie stiff and cold,
Puss has hushed the other's singing;
Winds go whistling o'er the wold,
Empty nest in sport a-flinging:
Poor little birdies! 

Faithless shepherd strayed afar,
Playful dog the gadflies catching;
Wolves bound boldly o'er the bar,
Not a friend the fold is watching:
Poor little lambkins! 

Father into prison fell,
Mother begging through the parish;
Baby's cot they too will sell:
Who will now feed, clothe, and cherish?
Poor little children

Ah, love, within the shadow of the wood 
The laurels are cut down; some other brows 
May bear the classic wreath which Fame allows 
And find the burden honorable and good. 
Have we not passed the laurels as they stood-- 
Soft in the veil with which Spring endows 
The wintry glitter of their woven boughs-- 
Nor stopped to break the branches while we could?

Ah, love, for other brows they are cut down. 
Thornless and scentless are their stems and flowers, 
And cold as death their twisted coronal. 
Sweeter to us the sharpness of this crown; 
Sweeter the wildest roses which are ours; 
Sweeter the petals, even when they fall. 




The Beacons

Rubens, river of oblivion, garden of indolence, 
Pillow of cool flesh where one cannot love, 
But where life moves and whirls incessantly 
Like the air in the sky and the tide in the sea;

Leonardo, dark, unfathomable mirror, 
In which charming angels, with sweet smiles 
Full of mystery, appear in the shadow 
Of the glaciers and pines that enclose their country;

Rembrandt, gloomy hospital filled with murmuring, 
Ornamented only with a large crucifix, 
Lit for a moment by a wintry sun, 
Where from rot and ordure rise tearful prayers;

Angelo, shadowy place where Hercules' are seen 
Powerful phantoms, which in the twilights 
Rend their winding-sheets with outstretched fingers;

Boxer's wrath, shamelessness of Fauns, you whose genius 
Showed to us the beauty in a villain, 
Great heart filled with pride, sickly, yellow man, 
Puget, melancholy emperor of galley slaves;

Watteau, carnival where the loves of many famous hearts
Flutter capriciously like butterflies with gaudy wings;
Cool, airy settings where the candelabras' light
Touches with madness the couples whirling in the dance

Goya, nightmare full of unknown things, 
Of fetuses roasted in the midst of witches' sabbaths, 
Of old women at the mirror and of nude children, 
Tightening their hose to tempt the demons;

Delacroix, lake of blood haunted by bad angels, 
Shaded by a wood of fir-trees, ever green, 
Where, under a gloomy sky, strange fanfares 
Pass, like a stifled sigh from Weber;

These curses, these blasphemies, these lamentations, 
These Te Deums, these ecstasies, these cries, these tears, 
Are an echo repeated by a thousand labyrinths; 
They are for mortal hearts a divine opium.

They are a cry passed on by a thousand sentinels,
An order re-echoed through a thousand megaphones;
They are a beacon lighted on a thousand citadels,
A call from hunters lost deep in the woods!

That we can give of our nobility, 
Are these impassioned sobs that through the ages roll, 
And die away upon the shore of your Eternity.



The Beacons 

Rubens, the grove of case, Nepenthe's river 
Couch of cool flesh, where Love may never be, 
But where life ever flows and seems to quiver 
As air in heaven, or, in the sea, the sea.

Da Vinci, dusky mirror and profound, 
Where angels, smiling mystery, appear, 
Shaded by pines and glaciers, that surround 
And seem to shut their country in the rear.

Rembrandt, sad hospital of murmurs, where 
Adorned alone by one great crucifix, 
From offal-heaps exhales the weeping prayer 
That winter shoots a sunbeam to transfix.

Vague region, Michelangelo, where Titans 
To stand bolt upright in the gloom that lightens, 
With gristly talons tearing through their shrouds.

Rage of the boxer, mischief of the faun, 
Extracting beauty out of blackguards' looks — 
The heart how proud, the man how pinched and drawn — 
Puget the mournful emperor of crooks!

Watteau, the carnival, where famous hearts 
Go flitting by like butterflies that burn, 
While through gay scenes each chandelier imparts 
A madness to the dancers as they turn.

Goya's a nightmare full of things unguessed, 
Of foeti stewed on nights of witches' revels. 
Crones ogle mirrors; children scarcely dressed, 
Adjust their hose to tantalise the devils.

A lake of gore where fallen angels dwell 
Is Delacroix, by firwoods ever fair, 
Where under fretful skies strange fanfares swell 
Like Weber's sighs and heartbeats in the air.

These curses, blasphemies, and lamentations, 
These ecstasies, tears, cries and soaring psalms — 
Through endless mazes, their reverberations 
Bring, to our mortal hearts, divinest balms.

A thousand sentinels repeat the cry. 
A thousand trumpets echo. Beacon-tossed 
A thousand summits flare it through the sky, 
A call of hunters in the jungle lost.

And certainly this is the most sublime 
Proof of our worth and value, Oh Divinity, 
That this great sob rolls on through ageless time 
To die upon the shores of your infinity.



Les Phares


Rubens, great river of oblivion,
garden of ease, cool flesh no lovers crave,
but where the floods of life unceasing run,
like wind on wind or wave on ocean wave;

Da Vinci — deep and sombre looking-glass
enchanting angels haunt, with subtle smile
all mystery-charged, while shadows dark amass
and pines and ice-cliffs bound their prison-isle;

Rembrandt — a piteous murmuring hospital
where ordure streams in tears and orisons,
stripped to the crucifix on one bare wall
illumed by one chill dart from wintry suns;

vast desert void, — o Michael Angelo!
where mighty spectres rise up stark and slow
— whose opening fingers rend their mouldered shrouds;

the rage of boxers and the satyrs' lust
— thou who hast found a grace in toiling knaves,
great heart, in a poor bilious body thrust
— Puget, the gloomy king of galley-slaves;

Watteau — bright carnival, where courtly pairs,
like butterflies in satin, flit about;
flaming in misty groves 'neath resin-flares
which pour their madness on the whirling rout;

Goya, who in a nightmare-horde unfurls
hags boiling foetuses in witches' milk,
beldames before the glass and naked girls
for demon-lovers tightening hose of silk;

and Delacroix — dark lake of blood forlorn
'mid fadeless firs, where evil angels fare,
a sullen sky wherefrom a faery horn
floats, faint as Oberon's horn through muffling air;

these curses, blasphemies and these laments,
these ecstasies, cries, tears, hossanas from
a thousand caverns, form one echo, whence
— death-doomed, we draw a heavenly opium!

theirs is a blast a thousand sentinels
pass on with their trumpets in a thousand moods;
a torch upon a thousand citadels,
a hail from hunters lost in pathless woods!

for truly, 'tis the mightiest voice our souls
this ardent sob which down the ages rolls
and dies against Thy verge, Eternity!



The Beacons

Reubens, river of forgetfulness, garden of sloth,
Pillow of wet flesh that one cannot love,
But where life throngs and seethes without cease
Like the air in the sky and the water in the sea.

Leonardo da Vinci, sinister mirror,
Where these charming angels with sweet smiles
Charged with mystery, appear in shadows
Of glaciers and pines that close off the country.

Rembrandt, sad hospital full of murmurs
Decorated only with a crucifix,
Where tearful prayers arise from filth
And a ray of winter light crosses brusquely.

Michelangelo, a wasteland where one sees Hercules
Powerful phantoms that in the twilight
Tear their shrouds with stretching fingers.

Rage of a boxer, impudence of a faun,
You who gather together the beauty of the boor,
Your big heart swelling with pride at man defective and yellow,
Puget, melancholy emperor of the poor.

Watteau, this carnival of illustrious hearts
Like butterflies, errant and flamboyant,
In the cool decor, with delicate lightning in the chandeliers
Crossing the madness of the twirling ball.

Goya, nightmare of unknown things,
Fetuses roasting on the spit,
Harridans in the mirror and naked children
Tempting demons by loosening their stockings.

Delacroix, haunted lake of blood and evil angels,
Shaded by evergreen forests of dark firs,
Where, under a grieving sky, strange fanfares
Pass, like a gasping breath of Weber.

These curses, these blasphemies, these moans,
These ecstasies, these tears, these cries of 'Te Deum'
Are an echo reiterated in a thousand mazes;
It is for mortal hearts a divine opium!

It is a cry repeated by a thousand sentinels,
An order returned by a thousand megaphones,
A beacon lighting a thousand citadels
A summons to hunters lost in the wide woods.

Can we give to our dignity
Than this burning sob that rolls from age to age
And comes to die on the shore of Your eternity?







LESBIA forever on me rails.
To talk of me, she never fails.
Now, hang me, but for all her art,
I find that I have gained her heart.
 
My proof is this: I plainly see
The case is just the same with me;
I curse her every hour sincerely,
Yet, hang me, but I love her dearly. 


All you Loves and Cupids cry
and all you men of feeling
my girl’s sparrow is dead,
my girl’s beloved sparrow.
She loved him more than herself.
He was sweeter than honey, and he
knew her, as she knows her mother.
He never flew out of her lap,
but, hopping about here and there,
just chirped to his lady, alone.
Now he is flying the dark
no one ever returns from.
Evil to you, evil Shades
of Orcus, destroyers of beauty.
You have stolen the beautiful sparrow from me.
Oh sad day! Oh poor little sparrow!
Because of you my sweet girl’s eyes
are red with weeping, and swollen. 


You left her
And reality
Got the best of what you said
Then you met her
And you left me 
Instead
Will the future ever be so kind
To make you someday be less blind


Less Than Nothing 

At a 'Senior Citizens' Club', one day, 
There was an uproar; and during the row, 
In Tamil most members did have their say.
Said Singh to Naidu: 'I could follow
Nothing at all of these Tamilian's fray.
But what it's about, I think you know? 

Naidu replied: 'Less have I understood
Than yourself: my version would be no good'.

Rejoined Singh:  'How can you understand 'less'? 
Less than nothing, can anything be? '
Caught unawares, but showing no stress, 
Naidu reflected while sipping his tea.
He then said: 'I've misunderstood the whole mess; 
And as you will surely agree with me -

Misunderstanding is much worse a thing
Than not understanding; hence less than nothing. 

Less time than it takes to say it, less tears than it takes to die; I've taken account of everything,
there you have it. I've made a census of the stones, they are as numerous as my fingers and some
others; I've distributed some pamphlets to the plants, but not all were willing to accept them. I've
kept company with music for a second only and now I no longer know what to think of suicide, for
if I ever want to part from myself, the exit is on this side and, I add mischievously, the entrance, the
re-entrance is on the other. You see what you still have to do. Hours, grief, I don't keep a
reasonable account of them; I'm alone, I look out of the window; there is no passerby, or rather no
one passes (underline passes). You don't know this man? It's Mr. Same. May I introduce Madam
Madam? And their children. Then I turn back on my steps, my steps turn back too, but I don't
know exactly what they turn back on. I consult a schedule; the names of the towns have been
replaced by the names of people who have been quite close to me. Shall I go to A, return to B,
change at X? Yes, of course I'll change at X. Provided I don't miss the connection with boredom!
perpendicular. 

Hanging out with the girls next door, 
Oh, what troubles we found galore. When
Warnings were ignored. 

And as we got bored, 
drinking was explored. Listening to wrong, 
it never dawned. We'd make the boys sore.
Wings got tore. Booze was continually in
store. Till games ended in one on the floor.
When poured in large sum. While finding
others had none. Stripped down to the pore.
Friendships were no more. Seeking solace
and comfort, for sores. Tried other shores.
Violence and life were bore. Though life 
may already been cold. A beating, maybe 
for told. Unsure, how it came to unfold.
But, death was all that was left, to hold.
The rest of my life, I've implored.

Reach far as you can
Start small but keep on growing
Enlarge your future'Do you like me?'
I asked the blue blazer.
No answer.
Silence bounced out of his books.
Silence fell off his tongue
and sat between us
and clogged my throat.
It slaughtered my trust.
It tore cigarettes out of my mouth.
We exchanged blind words,
and I did not cry,
and I did not beg,
blackness lunged in my heart,
and something that had been good,
a sort of kindly oxygen,
turned into a gas oven.
Do you like me?
How absurd!
What's a question like that?
What's a silence like that?
And what am I hanging around for,
riddled with what his silence said

You look at me, 
I see through you.
You’re always planning your next move.

You seemed sincere
But I don’t care.
This isn’t going anywhere.

I should stop you, 
But I don’t want to.
So just use me anyway


Well I can’t say it doesn’t matter.
I know somehow I deserve better.
I should leave but I can’t move
I can’t walk away from you.

It’s getting late and-
I’m so frustrated.
It’ll be another sleepless night.

I’ve been burned, 
And I have learned, 
But it all stops right here, tonight


Year  + has come and gone
Year  + to be born and gone! 

Man is in and man is out
New world is in and the old is out! 

A set of problems true is out
Another set is sure to peep! 
A set of values here is out
Another set is bound to creep! 

With passing year, new song we hear
Warring clouds smear, peaceful air near! 

Tragic end of thirsty man
Heeds not the words of the sane! 

Year  + rings the bell
Global warming warns of a hell
Impending disaster we do smell
To the senseless guys we have to tell! 

Copenhagen or no Copenhagen
Let us join the band wagon
To restrict emission physical and mental
To protect flora and fauna transcendental
To restore the glory of trees and forests
To bestow with will - earnest and honest! 

Let  + ten bring in the best
Let world peace be our host and the guest

Let America be America again.
Let it be the dream it used to be.
Let it be the pioneer on the plain
Seeking a home where he himself is free.

(America never was America to me.)

Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed--
Let it be that great strong land of love
Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme
That any man be crushed by one above.

(It never was America to me.)

O, let my land be a land where Liberty
Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,
But opportunity is real, and life is free,
Equality is in the air we breathe.

(There's never been equality for me,
Nor freedom in this "homeland of the free

")

Say, who are you that mumbles in the dark? 
And who are you that draws your veil across the stars?

I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart,
I am the Negro bearing slavery's scars.
I am the red man driven from the land,
I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek--
And finding only the same old stupid plan
Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak.

I am the young man, full of strength and hope,
Tangled in that ancient endless chain
Of profit, power, gain, of grab the land!
Of grab the gold! Of grab the ways of satisfying need!
Of work the men! Of take the pay!
Of owning everything for one's own greed!

I am the farmer, bondsman to the soil.
I am the worker sold to the machine.
I am the Negro, servant to you all.
I am the people, humble, hungry, mean--
Hungry yet today despite the dream.
Beaten yet today--O, Pioneers!
I am the man who never got ahead,
The poorest worker bartered through the years.

Yet I'm the one who dreamt our basic dream
In the Old World while still a serf of kings,
Who dreamt a dream so strong, so brave, so true,
That even yet its mighty daring sings
In every brick and stone, in every furrow turned
That's made America the land it has become.
O, I'm the man who sailed those early seas
In search of what I meant to be my home--
For I'm the one who left dark Ireland's shore,
And Poland's plain, and England's grassy lea,
And torn from Black Africa's strand I came
To build a "homeland of the free


The free?

Who said the free? Not me?
Surely not me? The millions on relief today?
The millions shot down when we strike?
The millions who have nothing for our pay?
For all the dreams we've dreamed
And all the songs we've sung
And all the hopes we've held
And all the flags we've hung,
The millions who have nothing for our pay--
Except the dream that's almost dead today.

O, let America be America again--
The land that never has been yet--
And yet must be--the land where every man is free.
The land that's mine--the poor man's, Indian's, Negro's, ME--
Who made America,
Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,
Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,
Must bring back our mighty dream again.

Sure, call me any ugly name you choose--
The steel of freedom does not stain.
From those who live like leeches on the people's lives,
We must take back our land again,
America!

O, yes,
I say it plain,
America never was America to me,
And yet I swear this oath--
America will be!

Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death,
The rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies,
We, the people, must redeem
The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.
The mountains and the endless plain--
All, all the stretch of these great green states--
And make America again

Let dogs delight to bark and bite,
Let bears and lions growl and fight,
For 'tis their nature too.
But, children, you should never let
Such angry passions rise;
Your little hands were never made
To tear each other's eyes. 

Let the light of late afternoon
shine through chinks in the barn, moving
up the bales as the sun moves down.

Let the cricket take up chafing
as a woman takes up her needles 
and her yarn. Let evening come.

Let dew collect on the hoe abandoned
in long grass. Let the stars appear
and the moon disclose her silver horn.

Let the fox go back to its sandy den.
Let the wind die down. Let the shed
go black inside. Let evening come.

To the bottle in the ditch, to the scoop
in the oats, to air in the lung
let evening come.

Let it come, as it will, and don't
comfortless, so let evening come. 

Rising rage overwhelms me
As I think about what they did
I try to keep away from them
I keep my feelings hid

But a fire roars within me
Towards a certain few
How they judged me wrongly
And their actions, once I knew

I feel my fury soaring
As I put words to pain
Stifled emotions evolve
Over and over again

The hurt I feel inside
Is as fresh as the day it dawned
And the love I thought was real
I've well and truly mourned

Innocence and dignity
Got me through that time
I always had a peace of mind
I didn't commit a crime

And to all the people, 
Who put me through that pain
I hope you learned enough to know
You wouldn't do that again

Forgiving can be hard to do
It's now time to let go
And  bear no more angry scars
I need to let love flow

Today I close the door behind
I forgive, let go and forget
And take from those tough few months
My hardest lessons yet


Its been a while, 
since i last saw your face, 
and to tell you the truth, 
I'm starting to miss your sweet grace! 

I'm just hoping that god, 
can help me one day, 
make this awful pain go away, 
go far away! 

Right now what i wish the most, 
is that the kid i once knew, 
would blow away from my mind, 
just like my other boyfriends do! 

Why is it so hard, 
for me to let go, 
of this pain i feel within? 
I guess i do love him so! 

But I'm guessing 
that was only a dream 
because now i woke up 
and I'm not sure what to believe! 

'let go of him already' 
says my mind 
but right now my heart 
doesn't want to unwind! 

Everyday i ask myself 
why and how. 
Why do i love? 
How come i love him now? 

I never thought, 
of falling in love, 
but now i got the message 
that god sent from way above! 

The message was 
to give him a special part 
in my lovable 
but broken heart! 

And that this kid 
will never pretend 
and that my heart 
will surely mend

Bruised and battered egos: 
Retaliations -
Flaming tornadoes spiral up to stormy skies.
Mixed metaphors of caviar and custard
Maelstrom mightily around the mountains of Hell.

Trolling is appalling
And flaming burns.

Let go of that ego
Is my advice.

Be humble from the start.
No-one is great enough
To be beyond reproach
Or criticism.

Who cares how good or otherwise I am? 
Who cares what anyone says
About my work? 

I am what I am, 
End of story.
To Describe what I am is fine: 
See those metres, verses, rhymes
And metaphors.
Dismantle me if you wish, 
But (please)  put me back together.

No-one should stand in judgement, 
With His bright wide wings.

So stop the abuse, 
And sourceless insults. 
Cease the condemnation, 
Or stand to be IGNORED. 

Will you please to let me go, Ma, 
To Mc


Intyre's, to buy a Sofa. 

Branches reaching out for us 
Extended arms in embrace
Birds nesting everywhere
She stands tall with grace
She is the tree with deep roots
Feeding us all with her fruits
Forgetting herself in the bargain
Her pleasures forfeited for pain within
She is a woman, she is life 
Her blossoms, create seed
Life, in orchard and its creed 
Let her leaves  shine, let her branches soar 
Let her not sacrifice anymore -Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth.
She is held by the bond of love to Him.
Of all the sentiments of nature
this love is the most excellent.
She kisses Him who is the principle

Are there any expressions equally sweet
to signify the mutual affection

They have one inheritance, 
one dwelling place, 
and they are one flesh.

So the soul is the Bride. 

(From the Holy Bible
Song of Solomon  Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth) 

Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth— for your love is more delightful than wine. ~ Song of Songs  Join us on facebook: Ruby Wives


Let it be forgotten, as a flower is forgotten,
Forgotten as a fire that once was singing gold,
Let it be forgotten forever and ever, 
Time is a kind friend, he will make us old.

If anyone asks, say it was forgotten
Long and long ago, 
As a flower, as a fire, as a hushed footfall
In a long-forgotten snow. 

Either peace or happiness, 
let it enfold you 

when I was a young man 
I felt these things were 
dumb, unsophisticated. 
I had bad blood, a twisted 
mind, a precarious 
upbringing. 

I was hard as granite, I 
leered at the 
sun. 
I trusted no man and 
especially no 
woman. 

I was living a hell in 
small rooms, I broke 
things, smashed things, 
walked through glass, 
cursed. 
I challenged everything, 
was continually being 
evicted, jailed, in and 
out of fights, in and out 
of my mind. 
women were something 
to screw and rail 
at, I had no male 
friends, 

I changed jobs and 
cities, I hated holidays, 
babies, history, 
newspapers, museums, 
grandmothers, 
marriage, movies, 
spiders, garbagemen, 
english accents,spain, 
france,italy,walnuts and 
the color 
orange. 
algebra angred me, 
opera sickened me, 
charlie chaplin was a 
fake 
and flowers were for 
pansies. 

peace and happiness to me 
were signs of 
inferiority, 
tenants of the weak 
and 
addled 
mind. 

but as I went on with 
my alley fights, 
my suicidal years, 
my passage through 
any number of 
women-it gradually 
began to occur to 
me 
that I wasn't different 

from the 
others, I was the same, 

they were all fulsome 
with hatred, 
glossed over with petty 
grievances, 
the men I fought in 
alleys had hearts of stone. 
everybody was nudging, 
inching, cheating for 
some insignificant 
advantage, 
the lie was the 
weapon and the 
plot was 
empty, 
darkness was the 
dictator. 

cautiously, I allowed 
myself to feel good 
at times. 
I found moments of 
peace in cheap 
rooms 
just staring at the 
knobs of some 
dresser 
or listening to the 
rain in the 
dark. 
the less I needed 
the better I 
felt. 

maybe the other life had worn me 
down. 
I no longer found 
glamour 
in topping somebody 
in conversation. 
or in mounting the 
body of some poor 
drunken female 
whose life had 
slipped away into 
sorrow. 

I could never accept 
life as it was, 
i could never gobble 
down all its 
poisons 
but there were parts, 
tenuous magic parts 
open for the 
asking. 

I re formulated 
I don't know when, 
date, time, all 
that 
but the change 
occurred. 
something in me 
relaxed, smoothed 
out. 
i no longer had to 
prove that I was a 
man, 

I didn't have to prove 
anything. 

I began to see things: 
coffee cups lined up 
behind a counter in a 
cafe. 
or a dog walking along 
a sidewalk. 
or the way the mouse 
on my dresser top 
stopped there 
with its body, 
its ears, 
its nose, 
it was fixed, 
a bit of life 
caught within itself 
and its eyes looked 
at me 
and they were 
beautiful. 
then- it was 
gone. 

I began to feel good, 
I began to feel good 
in the worst situations 
and there were plenty 
of those. 
like say, the boss 
behind his desk, 
he is going to have 
to fire me. 

I've missed too many 
days. 
he is dressed in a 
suit, necktie, glasses, 
he says, 'I am going 
to have to let you go' 

'it's all right' I tell 
him. 

He must do what he 
must do, he has a 
wife, a house, children, 
expenses, most probably 
a girlfriend. 

I am sorry for him 
he is caught. 

I walk onto the blazing 
sunshine. 
the whole day is 
mine 
temporarily, 
anyhow. 

(the whole world is at the 
throat of the world, 
everybody feels angry, 
short-changed, cheated, 
everybody is despondent, 
disillusioned)  

I welcomed shots of 
peace, tattered shards of 
happiness. 

I embraced that stuff 
like the hottest number, 
like high heels, breasts, 
singing,the 
works. 

(don't get me wrong, 
there is such a thing as cockeyed optimism 
that overlooks all 
basic problems just for 
the sake of 
itself- 
this is a shield and a 
sickness.)  

The knife got near my 
throat again, 
I almost turned on the 
gas 
again 
but when the good 
moments arrived 
again 
I didn't fight them off 
like an alley 
adversary. 
I let them take me, 
I luxuriated in them, 
I made them welcome 
home. 
I even looked into 
the mirror 
once having thought 
myself to be 
ugly, 
I now liked what 
I saw, almost 
handsome, yes, 
a bit ripped and 
ragged, 
scares, lumps, 
odd turns, 
but all in all, 
not too bad, 
almost handsome, 
better at least than 
some of those movie 
star faces 
like the cheeks of 
a baby's 
butt. 

and finally I discovered 
real feelings of 
others, 
unheralded, 
like lately, 
like this morning, 
as I was leaving, 
for the track, 
i saw my wife in bed, 
just the 
shape of 
her head there 
(not forgetting 
centuries of the living 
and the dead and 
the dying, 
the pyramids, 
Mozart dead 
but his music still 
there in the 
room, weeds growing, 
the earth turning, 
the tote board waiting for 
me)  
I saw the shape of my 
wife's head, 
she so still, 
I ached for her life, 
just being there 
under the 
covers. 

I kissed her in the 
forehead, 
got down the stairway, 
got outside, 
got into my marvelous 
car, 
fixed the seatbelt, 
backed out the 
drive. 
feeling warm to 
the fingertips, 
down to my 
foot on the gas 
pedal, 
I entered the world 
once 
more, 
drove down the 
hill 
past the houses 
full and empty 
of 
people, 
I saw the mailman, 
honked, 
he waved 
back 
at me. 

As you see universally
There is a great fall, 
Let love stretch its hands being universal
To love and teach us to love all, 
Love has a great power in its tender hands
To touch with love and care of all.



Muzahidul Reza
Let love stretch its hands being universal
Let us love each other and all, 
It has a great power see you will
Under one condition is that it must be real
Then we all will laugh you as well.

Time runs with an ax and a hammer, time slides down the hallways with a pass-key and a master-key, and time gets by, time wins.
 
Let the love of this hour go on; let all the oaths and children and people of this love be clean as a washed stone under a waterfall in the sun.
 
Time is a young man with ballplayer legs, time runs a winning race against life and the clocks, time tickles with rust and spots.
 
Let love go on; the heartbeats are measured out with a measuring glass, so many apiece to gamble with, to use and spend and reckon; let love go on.>let me live on my feet
let my head be held high
let me stand all the heat
and not to ask why
let it be
let live and let lie
live this one life like it was meant in the sky

many a wise man from his book he has read
the words of another that ring in his head
many a man has lost his soul to the wind
many a man more perfect has sinned

let me dance to the beat
let my joy be high
let me to greet 
and not to be shy
let it be
let sleeping dogs lie
leave heaven on earth for me to try

the past falls away at the face of the clock
as the sand washes off the edge of the rock
time as it stands is washed away in the sand
or is it dwelling inside of your head
if you dont know its in the palm of your hands
you might already be dead

let me to keep
let my hatred to die
let me to beat
the feelings that cry
let it be
let me not to rely
on the thoughts of a man who lives in the sky
let it be. . 

Is my life one big show? 
because, I really don't know
what prevents society from seeing
that I'am a unique being! 

Weren't my footprints
also meant to make their own imprints
upon the earth
or am I just a copied breath, 
simply born to do as instructed
and performing tasks others wanted? 

The thing is 
just like in show biz 
I dressed up
put on make up
and I rehearsed
for the one's I impressed! 

I always did as I was told
just so that i could fit into their mould
but, I struggled to put on the identity
given to me by society
because.  
IT - REALLY - WASN'T - ME

Sing praise, 
play music.
Rejoice o hearts, 


turn my heart
to your glorified throne.
Let me be lost in the splendour
of your beautiful face.



Let me be to Thee as the circling bird, 
Or bat with tender and air-crisping wings
That shapes in half-light his departing rings, 
From both of whom a changeless note is heard.
I have found my music in a common word, 
Trying each pleasurable throat that sings
And every praised sequence of sweet strings, 
And know infallibly which I preferred.

The authentic cadence was discovered late
Which ends those only strains that I approve, 
And other science all gone out of date
And minor sweetness scarce made mention of: 
I have found the dominant of my range and state - 

Let me die a youngman's death
not a clean and inbetween
the sheets holywater death
not a famous-last-words
peaceful out of breath death

When I'm and in constant good tumour
may I be mown down at dawn
by a bright red sports car
on my way home
from an allnight party

Or when I'm with silver hair
and sitting in a barber's chair
may rival gangsters
with hamfisted tommyguns burst in
and give me a short back and insides

Or when I'm and banned from the Cavern
may my mistress
catching me in bed with her daughter
and fearing for her son
cut me up into little pieces
and throw away every piece but one

Let me die a youngman's death
not a free from sin tiptoe in
candle wax and waning death
not a curtains drawn by angels borne
'what a nice way to go' death


My Dear Brain! Please don’t disturb, 
My heart is busy in dreaming, 
Eye lids are closed, 
But I am not sleeping, 
I am a day dreamer, 
I dream and I know very well, 
My dreams may not come true, 
Still I dream.

I want to live in dreams, 
Death is painful, 
I know standing at the shore of death’s ocean, 
I shall dream to cross the ocean, 
I shall dream to find a new island of life, 
I know it’s merely a dream, 
What can I do? 
Man can never get rid of hope, 
And hope leads to a dream, 
A beautiful dream of a garden, 
Where there are canals, 
Where there are fountains, 
Where there are flowers and fruits, 
Where there are charming fairies, 
Swimming in a river coming down on the plains, 
From high mountains, 
With streams of love, 
Falling down on the earth, 
My lovely earth, 
With her stretched arms, 
Waiting for the infant, 
For another breast feeding, 
In order to help the infant, 
To grow and select a pink fairy, 
And repeat the same old story of love, 
Love, a journey of life to death! 

But all these are means, 
Means to get peace of mind, 
And if my dreams can provide peace to me, 
Let me live in dreams, 
And let me die in dreams, 
My dreams give me peace, 
I am hopeful, 
My dreams will help me, 
And make my death really peaceful! 
And if I truly find a new island, 
The smiling lips of my beautiful heart, 
Will not be reluctant, 
To smile and kiss you, 
My ugly brain

You are purity
Like Ravel’s Bolero
Without drums
Without violas
Only the intriguing sound
Of the obo
Melting my heart
Like ice on
Midsummers’

You are diversity
Performing mirror images
When the moon is high
Making imperfect
Lines of reflecting
Beams in almost
Perfect water

You are divinty
Cause I don’t know you
Yet you know me better 
Than the objective truth
Cause you have seen me
How I really am
And you took my soul
And let it be your heart
Of rememberance

You are statistics
A name, a number
Yet like no one I have met before
You are the beauty of my heart
As you collect my pieces
And make me whole
And my random thoughts
Are in balance

So when you see me
Across the lake
Stand still! 
Just wave at me, carefully
And I will run to you
Stopping half way
Trying to figure out
That you are not
A ghost
But the half of me

Let me embrace you then, my dear


When I come to the end of the road
And the sun has set for me
I want no rites in a gloom filled room
Why cry for a soul set free?
Miss me a little, but not for long
And not with your head bowed low
Remember the love that once we shared
Miss me, but let me go.
For this is a journey we all must take
And each must go alone.
It's all part of the master plan
A step on the road to home.
When you are lonely and sick at heart
Go the friends we know.
Laugh at all the things we used to do
Miss me, but let me go.
When I am dead my dearest
Sing no sad songs for me
Plant thou no roses at my head
Nor shady cypress tree
Be the green grass above me
With showers and dewdrops wet
And if thou wilt remember
And if thou wilt, forget.
I shall not see the shadows,
I shall not fear the rain;
I shall not hear the nightingale
Sing on as if in pain;
And dreaming through the twilight
That doth not rise nor set,
Haply I may remember,
And haply may forget. 

Let me grow lovely, growing old--
So many fine things do:
Laces, and ivory, and gold,
And silks need not be new;
And there is healing in old trees,
Old streets a glamour hold;
Why may not I, as well as these,
Grow lovely, growing old

I wanna live
But not this life
Let me eat
Just not that food
Let me talk
But my own language
I wanna read
Just not that book
Let me have strength
So I can fight
Let me have feelings
Just dont let them show 
Show me the light
So I can see
Let me have hands 
So that I could feel
Let me have feet
So that I could walk
Show me the way
so that I could follow
If life is hard
Let me die easy


You've shut me out, 
Of your world, 
I'm out of the loop, 
Please let me in.

I want to be, 
Where you are, 
I cannot find, 
A bright new star.

To follow you, 
And find my way, 
You're a creature of the night, 
I live for today.

It's cold and dark, 
Where you've gone, 
Your loneliness, 
It feels so wrong.

It makes me feel, 
I'm lonely too, 
Your love has always, 
Seen me through.

Life's trials and lows, 
A world so grim, 
Please open your heart, 
And let me in. 

If it is not my portion to meet thee in this life 
then let me ever feel that I have missed thy sight 
---let me not forget for a moment, 
let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams 
and in my wakeful hours. 

As my days pass in the crowded market of this world 
and my hands grow full with the daily profits, 
let me ever feel that I have gained nothing 
---let me not forget for a moment, 
let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams 
and in my wakeful hours. 

When I sit by the roadside, tired and panting, 
when I spread my bed low in the dust, 
let me ever feel that the long journey is still before me 
---let me not forget a moment, 
let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams 
and in my wakeful hours. 

When my rooms have been decked out and the flutes sound 
and the laughter there is loud, 
let me ever feel that I have not invited thee to my house 
---let me not forget for a moment, 
let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams 
and in my wakeful hours


Some dew spread here and there
A lazy breeze bang the face
It’s a gentle dawn that rise
It’s so spurious in some terms  
I want to elope to some loneliness

Some may inquire my existence
Need to vanish from this light
Its  the crowd that steel all time
Move the life apparently
Norms that lilt for its sake

On air its satellite view
Under earth its radar sense
On earth all will scan with eyes
Caves are bust, and hills are cracked
Where will search some solitude

I have to rob the world 
Then can build my castle
There need to build a long wall
In a corner I can dwell
Still all ring to praise my treasure

A long way I walk myself
It’s crowded and hectic on their pave
So volatile and optimistic
I can shrink and heave this side
Crowded yet alone on this  lane! ! ! 

Where little Folk go up and down,
Tides flow and winds blow:
Night and Tempest and the Sea,
Human Will and Human Fate:
What is little, what is great?
Howsoe'er the answer be,
Let me sing of what I know. 

When will the time come? 
I will speak you will listen, 

All the while you have told much
And now your time does finish, 

I will say, now it is my turn
Let me speak
And you listen
I am telling not for me but for humanity, 

Do you know humanity? 
Please, know it and listen my speech, 

Humanity defines everybody's rights
But you have fully denied
Humanity defines no corruption
But you are fully corrupted
Humanity defines no war or crimes
But you are fully involved. 

Please don't ignore.
You are looking in pains, 
I see tears in your eyes, 
Your face is red with strains! 
Share your pains with me, 
Relieve the strains with me.
No, neither I love you, 
nor I want to help you, 
I just want to test myself.
Share your story with me, 
I know you have a tearful story, 
let it cut my heart into so many pieces, 
let it melt the pieces into hot white blood, 
let me see whether my eyes bleed for you, 
or not, 
you are an stranger to me, 
I don't know as to who are you, 
if I cry for you, I am alive, 
otherwise I am dead, 
Let me test, am I alive

Touch and enliven my awareness.
Enter into my deep silence.
Breathe in me consciousness thine
and let my depths wake into thy light. 

Let million daffodils
        Dance for peace in the happy world
Let million jasmines
        Spread the scent in a lovely mold
Let million nightingales 
        Sing for joy and pleasure loud and bold
Let million doves
        Spread their wings for harmony manifold
Let million roses
        Bloom to make us forget the day of doom
Let million showers
        Bring in hope and cheers in the manner of perfume  
Let million voices
        Rent the air for global love and peace
Let million minds
        Work for universal peace with ease
Let million thoughts
        Raise in nobility to chase and change our destiny
Let the millennium new
       See the world full of peace and joy, health and harmony
Let the millennium third
       Groom the world without war and strife
Let the millennium next
       Drink the nectar of love and light all through life

Let the morning bring freshness for me
Let the sun bring brightness for me
Let the gentle breeze bring softness for me
Let the nature brings beauty for me
But let my heart always reminds me of you

Let my day pass without problems
Let my work complete without errors
Let my thoughts scattered without pain
Let my wishes come true without barrier
But let my heart always reminds me of you

Let the sun disappear slowly in the sky
Let the moon appear slowly in the sky
Let the stars start twinkling in the sky
Let the night birds hover in the sky
But let my heart always reminds me of you




My love can tell you, how I filled with dreams of you
When I dance with you, your love lifts me higher to the sky
Your hugs and kisses made me feel our love is so true
When I met you first, I did not guess what I am
When I am in your arms, I did know what you are
Love can be loved in so many ways as its lighting the heart
But your love is melting my heart to mix your love in my soul
Day or night, it doesn't matter for me now
All I need to show my love and be there for eternity
I am your wealth in your soul and your love is my beauty in my heart
Your kisses are enough to take away my tears
You are my life, heart and soul that's forgets never forever
Until then, let my heart hold you forever till my end.



When the moon in the sky will lose the brightness
When the sun in the sky will lose his power of light

When the gardens of Eden has lost its beauty      
When the mountains has lost its valley of rivers    
When the ocean has lost its picturesque blue       

When all those happiness have shattered into the drain
When all those darkness of evil will brings its pain
When all those sorrows has throw out into the bin


I have no responsibility
No longer to be found
The shackles and chains that had me bound

A new life waits ahead
It is the unknown what I most dread
Though I'm free as a dove
I'd surrender if bound by your love

Let not go is my plea
Please bring again my captivity
Without you I am lost
Hold onto me no matter the cost










then the peace lies within you
When you search for peace
then it is not hard to find
When you want to keep peace alive
then you allow white doves to fly over you
When you make peace with others
then the whole world live in your heart
When you let peace be in the world
then you live in wonderful world
When you allow peace flow around the world
then your hateness will go and love will flow
When you open the door for peace
then peace welcome to your lives.
Let the peace prevail in our wonderful world


Let's go back in time
You and I
Let's go back when I was still okay
And the world was still a beautiful place
When there was no sorrow
And we didn't care about tomorrow
When we still felt alive and free
And we weren't condemed to life's misery
When we still had something to look forward to
And we didn't have a thing to lose
Let's go back you and me
Let's go back and look at the things we never got to see
Let's go back please
Let's be happy


A party a party! 
I'll have a big party
Lunch is too thinner
Let's do a dinner
A new menu for all
dinner made of soul, 
I'll do it next week
many, I shall seek: 
Made of sugar, the sweet soul
 with sour perfectly shall go.
Bitter and sweet
Such a funny fit.
Forget not
 the chilli pepper
Keeps us hot
For ever and ever.
One pinch of precious sault
 to bring up best taste: 
Don't make it  a waste
Done! All ingredents lined up
Mixed with all the love I got
The greatest  party I shall start.
No need for invitations
But I'll collect donations
Regardless if is large or small
Natural or forced, only one smile
 or two or a few more I will collect 
from those who pass the door.
Please come, you're most welcome. 

Let us live, my Lesbia, let us love,
and all the words of the old, and so moral,
may they be worth less than nothing to us!
Suns may set, and suns may rise again: 
but when our brief light has set, 
night is one long everlasting sleep.
Give me a thousand kisses, a hundred more,
another thousand, and another hundred,
and, when we’ve counted up the many thousands,
confuse them so as not to know them all,
so that no enemy may cast an evil eye,
by knowing that there were so many kisses. 

Let's make history, you and me.
Yeh, let's make history, you and me.
Bringing Peace to the world of the free.
Spreading Love all round the globe, 
From greatest whale to tiniest microbe.

Let's make history you and me.
Ain't no time for a cuppa tea.
But later we'll have a jamboree.

Let's make history you and me.
The world's in a mess, everyone can see.
So many people, so much hate.
We gotta give ‘em a better fate.

Forget religion, forget your race.
Come up and join us, let's have a ball, 
With or without some Alcohol.

The Beatles tried this, yes we know, 
But that don't mean we gotta give in.
You can always say I told you so, 
Until that Goodness overcomes Sin.

We must keep trying, that's all we say.
So let's make history on this fine day. 

Let's  make love  tonight 
Until our bodies will  transcend their shapes 
To become one single corpse.
Let's make this love to be tonight
Our eternal emotion of  dreams
And  not just a fleeting dream.
And if we accomplish
Our abyss inside, 
We will be like two butterflies 
Released from their cocoons
And we will awake 
In our novel world of seconds, 
Were we will subsist for being eternal.. 

Let’s not. 
            Everything’s ghostly-
                                  the blank windows watching, 
the snow reddening behind the stoplights of the cars.
Let’s not. 
            Everything’s ghostly, lost in mist, 
like a garden in March emptied of men and women, 
                                                paraded by shadows.
Let’s not. 
            I stand by a tree, 
                              not speaking, undeceiving, facing
      the double glare of the headlights, 
and with a quiet hand touch
                           but do not break
the tender icicle imprisoning a twig.
Let’s not. 
            I see you in the sleepy, reeling trolley
with spectral Moscow rocking in the window, 
your cheek propped on a child’s wool mitten, 
thinking of me with a woman’s rancor.
Let’s not. 
            You’ll be a woman soon enough, subtle and worn, 
hungry for praise, for the balm of a caress; 
it will be March again, 
                       a callow boy will whisper in your ear, 
your head will whirl inconsolably.
Let’s not. 
            for both your sakes, 
don’t stroll with him down the slippery path, 
don’t place
           your insubordinate hands
upon his shoulders, 
                   even as I do not place them today.
Let’s not. 
            Oh, disbelieve, like me, in the ghostly city.
Be spared
         from waking in the wasteland, terrified.
Say: 'Let’s not. '
                   bending your head, 
as I this moment
                say 'Let’s not. ' to you. 


Dear children! Can you tell? 
Which words cause magic to other? 
There are some sweet words
Those can drive away agony, don’t bother.

Words and speech have great effect
It depends upon its nature, 
If one use foul and swearing words
No one wants to listen or nurture.

Let’s examine a few words
Those can cause magic to people, 
Our heart is like door with lock
It opens in magic word as key ample.

‘Please’ is a magic word
Use and see its magic, 
It can change the heart of people
It enthralls the heart like music.

‘Sorry’, ‘Definitely’, ‘O Yes’, ‘Thank you’
Are some magic words? 
‘Om shanty’, ‘Yes’, ‘Good morning’, ‘Namaskar’
‘Please come and sit’ captivate as rewards.

Don’t have yack ever, 
Always control your speech, 
Let’s use magic words
And we will win the heart of each. 

There are doors
that want to be free
from their hinges to
fly with perfect clouds. 

There are windows
that want to be
released from their
frames to run with
the deer through
back country meadows. 

There are walls
that want to prowl
with the mountains
through the early
morning dusk. 

There are floors
that want to digest
their furniture into
flowers and trees. 

There are roofs
that want to travel
gracefully with
the stars through
circles of darkness. 

Let such pure hate still underprop 
Our love, that we may be 
Each other's conscience, 
And have our sympathy 
Mainly from thence. 
We'll one another treat like gods, 
And all the faith we have 
In virtue and in truth, bestow 
On either, and suspicion leave 
To gods below. 

Two solitary stars-- 
Unmeasured systems far 
Between us roll; 
But by our conscious light we are 
Determined to one pole. 

What need confound the sphere?-- 
Love can afford to wait; 
For it no hour's too late 
That witnesseth one duty's end, 
Or to another doth beginning lend. 

It will subserve no use, 
More than the tints of flowers; 
Only the independent guest 
Frequents its bowers, 
Inherits its bequest. 

No speech, though kind, has it; 
But kinder silence doles 
Unto its mates; 
By night consoles, 
By day congratulates. 

What saith the tongue to tongue? 
What hearest ear of ear? 
By the decrees of fate 
From year to year, 
Does it communicate. 

Pathless the gulf of feeling yawns; 
No trivial bridge of words, 
Or arch of boldest span, 
Can leap the moat that girds 
The sincere man. 

No show of bolts and bars 
Can keep the foeman out, 
Or 'scape his secret mine, 
Who entered with the doubt 
That drew the line. 

No warder at the gate 
Can let the friendly in; 
But, like the sun, o'er all 
He will the castle win, 
And shine along the wall. 

There's nothing in the world I know 
That can escape from love, 
For every depth it goes below, 
And every height above. 
It waits, as waits the sky, 
Until the clouds go by, 
Yet shines serenely on 
With an eternal day, 
Alike when they are gone, 
And when they stay. 

Implacable is Love-- 
Foes may be bought or teased 
From their hostile intent, 
But he goes unappeased 
Who is on kindness bent. 

Let the ascetics sing of the garden of Paradise --
We who dwell in the true ecstasy can forget their vase-tamed bouquet.

In our hall of mirrors, the map of the one Face appears
As the sun's splendor would spangle a world made of dew.

Hidden in this image is also its end,
As peasants' lives harbor revolt and unthreshed corn sparks with fire.

Hidden in my silence are a thousand abandoned longings:
My words the darkened oil lamp on a stranger's unspeaking grave.

Ghalib, the road of change is before you always:
The only line stitching this world's scattered parts. 

Calm my friend, the sky is fighting the unfriendly dark, 
Don't come in the way of a deadly shark.
The seas and oceans are knitting a net, for the giant evil, 
Soon you will see the end of the dominant devil.
The hills and mountains will be green once again, 
You will see a snow fall and it will rain.
The flowers will blossom and the trees will dance, 
The rivers will sing the melodies of romance.
The fields will produce the golden grains, 
The girls in schools will have no strains.
Without any fear you will go for the prayers, 
You'll play your games with all the players.
Let the candles lit, rough night is followed by a silky day, 
Don't disturb, the sun is sleeping in the milky way. 

Let the memorial hill remember instead of me,
that's what it's here for. Let the par in-memory-of remember,
let the street that's-named-for remember,
let the well-known building remember,
let the rolling Torah scroll remember, let the prayer
for the memory of the dead remember. Let the flags remember
those multicolored shrouds of history: the bodies they wrapped
have long since turned to dust. Let the dust remember.
Let the dung remember at the gate. Let the afterbirth remember.
Let the beasts of the field and birds of the heavens eat and remember.
Let all of them remember so that I can rest. 

In a world that is

Free from terrible terrorism and death
Full of happy harmony and warmth
Free from fateful wars and schisms
Full of hopping hopes and optimism
Free from wretched hatred and bigotry
Full of pure happiness and joy
Free from painful penury and poverty
Full of crystal understanding and aplomb
Free from nasty violence and bombs
Full of sweet smiles and cheers
Free fromdeadly flaws and fears
Full of pleasant peace and poise
Free from fanatic racism and strife
Full of prosperous pleasure and health
Free from disastrous floods and quakes
Full of vergent vegetation and lands
Free from global warming and heat
Full of bracing breeze and air
Free from wicked ego and envy
Full of Divine wisdom and knowledge

Let the NEW YEAR   + bloom

There lived a wise old owl
Who said 'Let the people be'
What they wish, What they want, 
Let them all be free

To make all their own choices
Without pressure, without guilt
Learning from their own mistakes
is how confidence is built

Let the loved ones in your life
Decide from their own  view
The path they choose to walk down
Not the one that pleases you

I listened to this wise old owl
Still make mistakes, but know
The best way for me to be
is advise but then let go

The joy and happiness I have within
Soars, as you fly free
When in turn you learn the same
You'll let your people be


Let the sun shine brightly each day, 
Warming us deeply in our soul, 
We are happy it's here to stay 
Let the sun shine brightly each day, 
Giving our earth a lovely ray, 
Having found its own final knoll, 
Let the sun shine brightly each day, 
Warming us deeply in our soul. 

I realized now that only time can tell us
when we will meet and be together soon
I will wait for you patiently till our time come 
You are a special person for me with true heart
and I am sure that I will reach you at right time
I will always see you in dreams and hug you with joy
but I have to wait for my time to make it reality
No matter the distance keep us apart now
but the time will bring you to me soon with feelings 
At the moment your memories brings me happiness
but my loneliness kills me without you being here
Waiting for the time anxiously to be in your arms
Waiting for the time earnestly to be in your soul
Waiting for the time honestly to share your love
Let the time to tell us when we will be together



Ever let it remain green handsome
The world to be at peace and harmony! 

High on the agenda a warless world
Ever in joy without any missing

Yearn for pleasant and peaceful world of gold! 
Endless peace and progress society needs
All over the world let us sow the seeds
Rear the sprouts until they blossom bold! 

Towards the society sans nasty "isms"
World to move without the scourge of schisms
Only the world‘s peace and pleasure at heart

Kindness and compassion – all have to start! 

Prosperity to be ensured for all
Leave none to starve and suffer but stand tall
Universal brotherhood sure our goal
Spirit positive, raise their heart and soul! 

Endless efforts we need to make for long
Let us all in unison sing a song
Eternal vigilance we have to keep
Very survival of the world rests deep
Entire world to play its role positive
None to fall into the traps negative! 

Blessed are those who live, let live noble
Let the voice of the ignoble feeble
Save the world from global warming we face
Sweet be the coming Year to blossom nice
Over the world let peace and joy be twice
"Many happy returns of the day"-thrice! 


(FIRST letter of each line when read together reads the Title of this poem.
no prizes, no ceremony,
They kill the man. A poet is one who listens
To nature and his own heart; and if the noise of the world grows up 
around him, and if he is tough enough,
He can shake off his enemies, but not his friends.
That is what withered Wordsworth and muffled Tennyson, and would have 
killed Keats; that is what makes
Hemingway play the fool and Faulkner forget his art. 

What are we heading towards, 
do we know? 

Let us set a framework to
contain our thoughts.

Can they be contained inside, 
no.

Can the grains of sand on all
the beaches be contained? 

Let thoughts be what they are
free. 

Love has no other desire but to fulfill itself 
But if your love and must needs have desires, 
Let these be your desires: 

To melt and be like a running brook 
That sings its melody to the night. 
To know the pain of too much tenderness. 
To be wounded by your own understanding of love; 
And to bleed willingly and joyfully. 
To wake at dawn with a winged heart 
And give thanks for another day of loving; 
To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy; 
To return home at eventide with gratitude; 
And then to sleep with a prayer 
For the beloved in your heart 
And a song of praise upon your lips. 

LET TWENTY THIRTEEN FIGHT THE TRAGEDY! 
                             (Tragedy of Democracy) 



What a noble form is DEMOCRACY! 
Great values, freedom and philosophy
True only to those who value and feel
Cherish one must, nurture he must and keep! 
For those who enjoy fruits- sure nurture not
Democracy leads to tragedy lot! 

In the name of freedom and liberty
Care not rules and laws, morals and ethics! 
Fear never nor respect ever authority! 
Culture, decency buried sans basics! 
Leader treated cheap, followers feel tall
Values and virtues fail and deeply fall! 
Discipline a prey, character a farce
Misbehavior a fashion for youth! 
Scant respect and fear for authority
Love for duty a rare commodity! 

True, leaders failed, but the people more! 
Oh! Mother India! My great Nation! 
Let twenty thirteen fight the tragedy
Great pain-tragedy of democracy

May the democratic spirit prevail! 
May we revert to glory to great avail! 
Let us play our role with sincerity
Accepting our responsibility
Our people sure have capacity
Fail not in our accountability

Let us be grateful for things great or small.
Taking nothing for granted, the short 'n the tall, 
For if eggs didn't come from the hens ass at all.
We'd prolly have breakfast eatin' little golf balls


Let us clap in cheer, 
We do never fear.
Let us walk in mist, 
Make up word list.

Let us slowly run, 
You all call the sun.
Revision you do all, 
You stand never fall.

This is the time winter, 
Leaf is green printer.
You wear all sweaters, 
You tie close mufflers.

You all count numbers, 
We are all members.
We have to learn soon, 
We do travel to moon.

Life is filled with glitter, 
Sure smiles the winter.
Let us press the gear, 
Let us clap in cheer. 

Let us do, 
what our ancestors couldn't do, 
let us forget our inherited views, 
let us bring peace in the world, 
let us gather some courage, 
and get rid of that, 
which may lead the world, 
to save the resources, 
spent on preparing weapons, 
for the so called holy wars, 
to fulfill our foolish dreams, 
of the promised lands.
Let us use the resources, 
to find a new land, 
somewhere in space, 
for shifting our population, 
to a distant planet, 
whereat we can grow, 
wheat, barley and rice, 
apples and oranges, 
let us shift our animals too, 
on another planet, 
where there are oceans, 
mountains and rivers, 
where there is atmosphere, 
having oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, 
where there are forests, 
might be having some strange animals, 
some unseen plants and green trees, 
where there is a sun and a few moons, 
where days and years might be longer than ours, 
we shall not take much time, 
to become used to, 
to a new environment, 
where clouds rise and rain, 
and the only thing we shall carry from the earth, 
a bikini beauty of charming women, 
for something universal, 
you know it's love. 

He lost his parents 
In communal riots
But he forgot it! 

Acquired was his fertile tract
For a paltry amount
But he forgot it

He has to fast many a night
Unable to meet rising costs
But he forgot it

Shattered were hold-fasts
Of many a proletariat
But they all forgot

Nothing to surprise at all
It is easy in this democratic State
To keep people in a hypnotic state

Today they each got
A hundred rupee note
And a couple of
Arrack packets
Tomorrow is an auspicious date
They are going to cast
Their precious votes


Let us forget. What matters it that we
Once reigned o'er happy realms of long-ago,
And talked of love, and let our voices low,
And ruled for some brief sessions royally?
What if we sung, or laughed, or wept maybe?
It has availed not anything, and so
Let it go by that we may better know
How poor a thing is lost to you and me.
But yesterday I kissed your lips, and yet
Did thrill you not enough to shake the dew
From your drenched lids--and missed, with no regret,
Your kiss shot back, with sharp breaths failing you;
And so, to-day, while our worn eyes are wet
With all this waste of tears, let us forget

Let us have madness openly. 
O men Of my generation. 
Let us follow 
The footsteps of this slaughtered age: 
See it trail across Time's dim land 
Into the closed house of eternity 
With the noise that dying has, 
With the face that dead things wear-- 
nor ever say 
We wanted more; we looked to find
An open door, an utter deed of love, 
Transforming day's evil darkness; 
but We found extended hell and fog Upon the earth,
and within the head 
A rotting bog of lean huge graves. 

In maudlin spite let Thracians fight
Above their bowls of liquor;
But such as we, when on a spree,
Should never brawl and bicker!

These angry words and clashing swords
Are quite _de trop_, I'm thinking;
Brace up, my boys, and hush your noise,
And drown your wrath in drinking.

Aha, 't is fine,--this mellow wine
With which our host would dope us!
Now let us hear what pretty dear
Entangles him of Opus.

I see you blush,--nay, comrades, hush!
Come, friend, though they despise you,
Tell me the name of that fair dame,--
Perchance I may advise you.

O wretched youth! and is it truth
You love that fickle lady?
I, doting dunce, courted her once;
Since when, she's reckoned shady

A cruel taxi driver in Mumbai
Forced a Muslim woman
Out of his vehicle
For she was in labour
Providence had it that
She meandered into a Hindu temple
Gave birth to a yelling
Full-throated Indian babe
Assisted by female devotees
Who had thronged the place
News says the child was named Ganesh

Another news items blares
Badly needed space was granted
At a Hindu temple in Mumbai
For Muslims to pray
On the day of Eid Al-Adha

Both incidents are in order
That is the way the world should be
No matter what brainless crooks say
Yet why is it that so much is said
About what every man should do
To his fellow human
And why does it become big news

When someone repairs a broken sparrow
Or pauses to sit beside
A dying cat to pray
Or rescues a stray dog from a well
All unnoticed, unreported

Man has it in him
In an elating empathy
May such men
Hold their hands together
And do an India make
Others will sure join
For elation is everyone’s like
In sheer tears of joy

Let them sing Vande Maataram*
Children born to a mother
Spanning miles and miles
Of beautiful earth
Enriched by the Ganges
Her eyes fixed on the sky
Of stars and galaxies
Listening for eons and eons
To the songs of universal love

Make India, make India
You sons of India
We are born at a Ganesha mosque
Or is it a church or a Jain temple
A gurudwara, it is all the same
Providence has it so
Lucky we remain
Singing Vande Maataram
In unison
As the dumbfounded stars listen

She went into a vegetating coma after a ward-boy sexually assaulted her in and remained in that state at the same hospital for the last forty-two years under the care of her colleagues/staff.  The hospital was just across the street from Haffkine Institute where I was working at the time of the incident.  Although I am happy her ordeal has ended, the news of her passing away broke me down.

Aruna Shanbaugh has left
Forty-two years of vegetating has ended 
On a King Edward Memorial Hospital bed
When uncaring time morphed a dreamy damsel
Into a wrinkled mass of grey sixty-eight without her knowledge

They said she had been conscious
But perhaps not aware
Of what was going on around her
Well, all that is a matter of conjecture
Now for fruitless debaters.
Who can understand a caged bird’s frantic flaps
Behind the jail-bars of blocked senses? 

I had worked just across the street
From where she was trespassed
Our ways might have crossed on the roads
Without our knowledge, we were strangers
As she then hadn’t the tragic identity
Which calamity imposed on her with horrendous cruelty

As she lay looking blankly at the ceiling
In the care of her untiring colleagues
The law spent a lot of heartless time
Deciding the nature of the crime
Society debated if euthanasia was the need of the time

Forty-two dead years of national vegetating
During which millions of mothers and sisters 
Across our land were brutally disrobed and shamed
An orgy that continues even now unabated
Despite our loud and empty claims

Aruna, how sad your tragedy hasn’t taught the men
The lessons they should have learnt
Long, long ago, that a woman too is a friend
Not a piece of meat, and should be treated like an equal confidant! 

Why have we failed in drilling this theme
Into the head of every male child of our land
Right from birth, so it pauses
Later in life to salute in respect
Whenever a woman crosses its route? 

The granite stones of King Edward
Are tearful this morn of humid May
A bird that had housed in it
For a long while has just flapped away

Men of the nation, ask yourselves
If her plight has welled your eyes
And torn your hearts, if yes
Get to your feet, rouse this nation’s psyche
From the vegetating coma it is in

May dear Aruna rest in peace
May her story never repeat(The sad news of Aruna Shabaugh’s death headlined newspapers across India this morning.  She was a nurse at King Edward Memorial Hospital, Parel, Mumbai.

For a long while has just flapped away

Men of the nation, ask yourselves
If her plight has welled your eyes
And torn your hearts, if yes
Get to your feet, rouse this nation’s psyche
From the vegetating coma it is in

May dear Aruna rest in peace
May her story never repeat


Children laugh at least 
five hundred times a day; 
adults may be a few times.

I want to give praise during my life time.
I will not be a dead person among the living.

Our presence, our body language
and words must radiate the message
that we are delighted to be here.

We are the happy bearers
Let us smile and laugh
and believe that life is a celebration


Let us walk oh brother, 
Without tension bother.
In his garden shining bud.

Let us blossom in right, 
Hold all rays all of light.
Fighting is not solution, 
War you leave in motion.

Emotion we have to feel 
Of others you do not chill.
Hurting is not the right way
Love is alternative all do say.

Feel the mind and be kind, 
In love all hearts soon bind.
Dazzling star twinkles light

Let us walk together brothers, 
Time near us soon murmurs.
Let us in love ever all do talk.

Let us go far away where the world is silent
Hold my heart close to your heart with love
Let us feel the beauty of love in our soul
When those stars make romantic nights
Let our hearts melt down with our deep emotions
When those nights bring moonlight on our body
Let us cover and roll with our 'love blanket'  
When those trees dance with evening breeze
Let us dance with our world of dreams
When those ocean waves rolling high with sound 
Let our heat waves touch our body with our feelings 
When our arms around each others and makes us comfort
Let us give ourselves to each others for the endless love
Till those gates of the heaven open for us
Let you and me live in this world together forever 




My hands are busy
My heart is cold
My life runs quickly
And my eyes turn old
If for just one moment
I could take some time alone
To explore this aching heart
And chip away at its stone
I give my love so frequently
I help them get away
I take their problems, personally
And lead them on their way
But, emotions are a luxury
My heart is going without
And takes from my being
Like a never-ending doubt
I dont' want to be sad
But, I want to be able to cry
I don't want to be apathetic
But, I want to be able to sigh
And mend each broken piece
And let your healing never cease
One who cannot feel
The first to pray and kneel
Give me this day, my daily bread
And give me the strength to go on
For a war-weary man with nothing to lose
Is like life's pawn
Give me an epiphany
Just a simple ray of light
To take me to the place
Where my eyes can meet your sight



- -
 redeems you from destruction, 
crowns you with kindness and compassion.

He will not chide you.
He does not deal with you
according  to your sins.

- -
From morning’s first light
to evening’s last star, 
always remember
how special you are
- 
Let your religion be less of a theory
and more of a love affair. 

Little sparrow of my heart, 
 tell me your secrets.
Murmur it in my ears when I sleep
Let your secrets become my dreams. 

Why is the life like that? 
It has no taste..

Everything goes bad and everyday is like the day before
As if we are doing copy and paste

The daily routine is killing us.
It doesn't want to go away. It is a massive cuss.

We are trying to change our boring life.
But we failed in changing this jive.

Everyone wants to cry.
Everyone wants to die.

And make this feeling quickly departs.

We need the hope
we need to cope

before the patience rope be cut


Come to my heart, cruel, insensible one, 
Adored tiger, monster with the indolent air;
I would for a long time plunge my trembling fingers
Into the heavy tresses of your hair; 

And in your garments that exhale your perfume 
I would bury my aching head, 
And breathe, like a withered flower, 
The sweet, stale reek of my love that is dead. 

I want to sleep! sleep rather than live! 
And in a slumber, dubious as the tomb's, 
I would lavish my kisses without remorse 
Upon the burnished copper of your limbs. 

To swallow my abated sobs 
Nothing equals your bed's abyss; 
Forgetfulness dwells in your mouth, 
And Lethe flows from your kiss. 

My destiny, henceforth my pleasure,
I shall obey, predestined instrument, 
Docile martyr, condemned innocent, 
Whose fervour but augments his torment. 

I shall suck, to drown my rancour,
Nepenthe, hemlock, an opiate, 
At the charming tips of this pointed breast 
That has never imprisoned a heart. 

Lets Dance To The Tune Of Lust

The world says hush
It's not the time to rush
Forget the things which are must
Let's dance to the tune of lust

Common man may  feel disgusted
Their manhood has got rusted
So ladies tighten your bust
Blow  away  the society's  curse
Just forget the things which are must
Let's dance to the tune of lust
Blast the society, 
Blast the  rules
We aren't t century fools
Blow out cynical and old fashioned dust
Just forget the things which are must
Let's dance to the tune of lust 

Fill environment with moans and groans
Flush out every booming drone
Entice the world with  booty and curves
Burst now every man's crust
Forget the things which are must
Lets dance to the tune of lust



I know I'm not alone
lets take a stand
lets fight it together
lets support each other
instead of being alone
lets not go with out a fight
lets not just become
just another teenage suicide
lets fight it
together we can survive
we can take a stand
we can win this battle


I have developed a need for non-commitment. Without the balance of belonging or betrayal. I don't need a desire, so everwhelming - yet, I don't remember receiving a single rose, or the thorn that pricked my aspect, or my whys? Just words of one day at a time.
 'Lets_see'. What doesn't show-up! Not ever. In my moral eyes, I made affirmation of what it would take to get this, pearl. Again the casting of them among swine. Again? 
 If ever I cast. them again, to anyone. For nothing, I placed it in your hand and you asked, 'Who does this belong to'? Whose is it? Baby - is it mine? say it - Naw
 Mine, if you had to ask it's still mine and for what - let's see

You can see it already: chalks and ochers; 
Country crossed with a thousand furrow-lines;
Ground-level rooftops hidden by the shrubbery; 
Sporadic haystacks standing on the grass;
Smoky old rooftops tarnishing the landscape; 
A river (not Cayster or Ganges, though:
A feeble Norman salt-infested watercourse); 
On the right, to the north, bizarre terrain
All angular--you'd think a shovel did it. 
So that's the foreground. An old chapel adds
Its antique spire, and gathers alongside it 
A few gnarled elms with grumpy silhouettes;
Seemingly tired of all the frisky breezes, 
They carp at every gust that stirs them up.
At one side of my house a big wheelbarrow 
Is rusting; and before me lies the vast
Horizon, all its notches filled with ocean blue; 
Cocks and hens spread their gildings, and converse
Beneath my window; and the rooftop attics, 
Now and then, toss me songs in dialect.
In my lane dwells a patriarchal rope-maker; 
The old man makes his wheel run loud, and goes
Retrograde, hemp wreathed tightly round the midriff. 
I like these waters where the wild gale scuds;
All day the country tempts me to go strolling; 
The little village urchins, book in hand,
Envy me, at the schoolmaster's (my lodging), 
As a big schoolboy sneaking a day off.
The air is pure, the sky smiles; there's a constant 
Soft noise of children spelling things aloud.
The waters flow; a linnet flies; and I say: "Thank you! 
Peacefully, hour by hour, with little fuss, I shed 
My days, and think of you, my lady fair!
I hear the children chattering; and I see, at times, 
Sailing across the high seas in its pride,
Over the gables of the tranquil village, 
Some winged ship which is traveling far away,
Flying across the ocean, hounded by all the winds. 
Lately it slept in port beside the quay.
Nothing has kept it from the jealous sea-surge:
No tears of relatives, nor fears of wives, 
Nor reefs dimly reflected in the waters,
Nor importunity of sinister birds. 

To His unworthy servant! — I arrived
Safe at the Mission, via Westport; where
I tarried over night, to aid in forming
A Vigilance Committee, to send back,
In shirts of tar, and feather-doublets quilted
With forty stripes save one, all Yankee comers,
Uncircumcised and Gentile, aliens from
The Commonwealth of Israel, who despise
The prize of the high calling of the saints,
Who plant amidst this heathen wilderness
Pure gospel institutions, sanctified
By patriarchal use. The meeting opened
With prayer, as was most fitting. Half an hour,
Or thereaway, I groaned, and strove, and wrestled,
As Jacob did at Penuel, till the power
Fell on the people, and they cried 'Amen!'
And the rough river boatmen wiped their eyes;
'Go it, old hoss!' they cried, and cursed the niggers —
Fulfilling thus the word of prophecy,
'Cursed be Cannan.' After prayer, the meeting
Chose a committee — good and pious men —
A Presbyterian Elder, Baptist deacon,
A local preacher, three or four class-leaders,
Anxious inquirers, and renewed backsliders,
A score in all — to watch the river ferry,
(As they of old did watch the fords of Jordan,)
And cut off all whose Yankee tongues refuse
The Shibboleth of the Nebraska bill.
And then, in answer to repeated calls,
I gave a brief account of what I saw
In Washington; and truly many hearts
Rejoiced to know the President, and you
And all the Cabinet regularly hear
The gospel message of a Sunday morning,
Drinking with thirsty souls of the sincere
Milk of the Word. Glory! Amen, and Selah!
Here, at the Mission, all things have gone well:
The brother who, throughout my absence, acted
As overseer, assures me that the crops
Never were better. I have lost one negro,
A first-rate hand, but obstinate and sullen.
He ran away some time last spring, and hid
In the river timber. There my Indian converts
Found him, and treed and shot him. For the rest,
The heathens round about begin to feel
The influence of our pious ministrations
And works of love; and some of them already
Have purchased negroes, and are settling down
I know it will rejoice you. You, I hear,
Are on the eve of visiting Chicago,
To fight with the wild beasts of Ephesus,
Long John, and Dutch Free-Soilers. May your arm
Be clothed with strength, and on your tongue be found
The sweet oil of persuasion. So desires
Your brother and co-laborer. Amen!
S. All's lost. Even while I write these lines,
The Yankee abolitionists are coming
Upon us like a flood — grim, stalwart men,
Each face set like a flint of Plymouth Rock
Against our institutions — staking out
Their farm lots on the wooded Wakarusa,
Or squatting by the mellow-bottomed Kansas;
The pioneers of mightier multitudes,
The small rain-patter, ere the thunder shower
Drowns the dry prairies. Hope from man is not.
Oh, for a quiet berth at Washington,
Snug naval chaplaincy, or clerkship, where
These rumors of free labor and free soil
Might never meet me more. Better to be
Door-keeper in the White House, than to dwell
Amidst these Yankee tents, that, whitening, show
On the green prairie like a fleet becalmed.
Methinks I hear a voice come up the river
From those far bayous, where the alligators
Mount guard around the camping filibusters:
'Shake off the dust of Kansas. Turn to Cuba —
(That golden orange just about to fall,
O'er-ripe, into the Democratic lap
Keep pace with Providence, or, as we say,
Manifest destiny. Go forth and follow
The message of our gospel, thither borne
Upon the point of Quitman's bowie-knife,
And the persuasive lips of Colt's revolvers.
There may'st thou, underneath thy vine and fig-tree,
Watch thy increase of sugar cane and negroes,
Calm as a patriarch in his eastern tent!'

Dear Mrs Judi B.
Tenant seven billion and forty-three, 
Thank you so much for your letter
I assure you, things will soon be better

I'm so sorry about the leaky pipe
That gave you good reason to gripe
It pains me that the plumbing
Caused you a deal of suff'ring

You're right about Mr Noah who
Lived some time before you
He followed my instruction
And thus avoided destruction

You see, I made the house beautifully
And gave it new to your predecessor
But he didn't keep the rules dutifully
He was a vandal and a wrecker

Unfortunately his type multiplied
That's why I brought all that rain
They ignored the warnings and died
And now the same is happening again

It hurts me to see so many lodgers
Take pleasure in ruining the building
And are audacious rent dodgers
Who scorn my regulations for living

The results, as you have seen, are appalling
And I greatly regret that conditions
You've been living under are falling
I'm about to begin reparations

The cost has already been covered
And it was considerable, I must say
The building supplies have been delivered
And we're looking forward to the happy day

When the building will be renovated
And all pipes and plumbing renewed
And tenants like you will be elated
All leases are currently being reviewed

The new lease agreement is available
To all in their own mother tongue
And then if they prove to be malleable
A new era will have begun

I will pardon past offenders
And write off their prodigious debt
I am seeking diligent caretakers
And to them my house I will let

But for your sake and that of other tenants
I will issue notices of evictions
To those who do not display penance
Or refuse to agree to my conditions

So, my dear Mrs Judi B, 
I hope you now understand
These matters are important to me
And their resolution is at hand

And Country and Land. 

If you are my friend. 
Help me.  

to leave you
Or if you are my lover. 
Help me.  

so I can be healed of you. 
If I knew
that the ocean is very deep.  

I would not have swam. 
If I knew.  

how I would end,
I would not have began

I desire you.  

so teach me not to desire
teach me. 
how to cut the roots of your love from the depths
teach me. 
how tears may die in the eyes
and love may commit suicide

If you are prophet,
Cleanse me from this spell
Deliver me from this atheism. 
Your love is like atheism.  

so purify me from this atheism

If you are strong. 
Rescue me from this ocean
For I don't know how to swim
The blue waves.  

in your eyes
drag me.  

to the depths
blue. 
blue. 
nothing but the color blue
and I have no experience
in love.  

and no boat. 

If I am dear to you
then take my hand
For I am filled with desire.  

from my
head to my feet

I am breathing under water!
I am drowning. 
drowning. 
drowning. - New Orleans, November Four weeks have passed since I left, and still 
I must write to you of no work. I've worn down 
the soles and walked through the tightness 
of my new shoes calling upon the merchants, 
their offices bustling. All the while I kept thinking 
my plain English and good writing would secure 
for me some modest position Though I dress each day 
in my best, hands covered with the lace gloves 
you crocheted- no one needs a girl. How flat 
the word sounds, and heavy. My purse thins. 
I spend foolishly to make an appearance of quiet 
industry, to mask the desperation that tightens 
my throat. I sit watching-  

though I pretend not to notice- the dark maids
ambling by with their white charges. Do I deceive 
anyone? Were they to see my hands, brown 
as your dear face, they'd know I'm not quite 
what I pretend to be. I walk these streets 
a white woman, or so I think, until I catch the eyes 
of some stranger upon me, and I must lower mine, 
a negress again. There are enough things here 
to remind me who I am. Mules lumbering through 
the crowded streets send me into reverie, their footfall 
the sound of a pointer and chalk hitting the blackboard 
at school, only louder. Then there are women, clicking 
their tongues in conversation, carrying their loads 
on their heads. Their husky voices, the wash pots 
and irons of the laundresses call to me.

I thought not to do the work I once did, back bending 
and domestic; my schooling a gift- even those half days
at picking time, listening to Miss J- . How 
I'd come to know words, the recitations I practiced 
to sound like her, lilting, my sentences curling up
or trailing off at the ends. I read my books until
I nearly broke their spines, and in the cotton field,
I repeated whole sections I'd learned by heart,
spelling each word in my head to make a picture
I could see, as well as a weight I could feel
in my mouth. So now, even as I write this
and think of you at home, Goodbye

is the waving map of your palm, is 
a stone on my tongue. 

Like boys that run behind the loaded wain
For the mere joy of riding back again,
When summer from the meadow carts the hay
And school hours leave them half a day to play;
So I with leisure on three sides a sheet
Of foolscap dance with poesy's measured feet,
Just to ride post upon the wings of time
And kill a care, to friendship turned in rhyme.
The muse's gallop hurries me in sport
With much to read and little to divert,
And I, amused, with less of wit than will,
Run till I tire.--And so to cheat her still.
Like children running races who shall be
First in to touch the orchard wall or tree,
The last half way behind, by distance vext,
Turns short, determined to be first the next;
So now the muse has run me hard and long--
I'll leave at once her races and her song;
And, turning round, laugh at the letter's close
And beat her out by ending it in prose. 

THE RIVER is gold under a sunset of Illinois.
It is a molten gold someone pours and changes.
A woman mixing a wedding cake of butter and eggs
Knows what the sunset is pouring on the river here.
The river twists in a letter S.
  A gold S now speaks to the Illinois sky. 

Come soon.

Everything is lusting
for light,
thrusting
up
up
splitting the earth,
opening flaring fading,
seed
into shoot
bud
into flower,
nothing
beyond its hour.

Come soon.

The apple bloom has melted
like
spring snow.

The lilac
changed the air,
surprising every breath.

Low in the field
wild strawberries
fatten.

Come soon.

It's a matter of
life.

And death. 

Citizen, enemy, mama's boy, sucker, utter
garbage, panhandler, swine, refujew, verrucht;
a scalp so often scalded with boiling water
that the puny brain feels completely cooked.
Yes, we have dwelt here: in this concrete, brick, wooden
rubble which you now arrive to sift.
All our wires were crossed, barbed, tangled, or interwoven.
Also: we didn't love our women, but they conceived.
Sharp is the sound of pickax that hurts dead iron;
still, it's gentler than what we've been told or have said ourselves.
Stranger! move carefully through our carrion:
what seems carrion to you is freedom to our cells.
Leave our names alone. Don't reconstruct those vowels,
consonants, and so forth: they won't resemble larks
but a demented bloodhound whose maw devours 
its own traces, feces, and barks, and barks. 

Remember when you put on that wig
From the grab bag and then looked at yourself
In the mirror and laughed, and we laughed together?
It was a transformation, glamorous flowing tresses.
Who knows if you might not have liked to wear
That wig permanently, but of course you
Wouldn't. Remember when you told me how
You meditated, looking at a stone until
You knew the soul of the stone? Inwardly I
Scoffed, being the backwoods pragmatic Yankee
That I was, yet I knew what you meant. I
Called it love. No magic was needed. And we
Loved each other too, not in the way of
Romance but in the way of two poets loving
A stone, and the world that the stone signified.
Remember when we had that argument over
Pee and piss in your poem about the bear?
"Bears don't pee, they piss," I said. But you were
Adamant. "My bears pee

" And that was that.
Then you moved away, across the continent,
And sometimes for a year I didn't see you.
We phoned and wrote, we kept in touch. And then
You moved again, much farther away, I don't
Know where. No word from you now at all. But
I am faithful, my dear Denise. And I still
Love the stone, and, yes, I know its soul. 

Migratory duck, 
Why not coming back towards
Embryonic lake

The spider spreads her webs, whether she be
In poet's tower, cellar, or barn, or tree;
The silk-worm in the dark green mulberry leaves
His winding sheet and cradle ever weaves;
So I, a thing whom moralists call worm,
Sit spinning still round this decaying form,
From the fine threads of rare and subtle thought-
No net of words in garish colours wrought
To catch the idle buzzers of the day-
But a soft cell, where when that fades away,
Memory may clothe in wings my living name
And feed it with the asphodels of fame,
Which in those hearts which must remember me
Grow, making love an immortality.


Whoever should behold me now, I wist,
Would think I were a mighty mechanist,
Bent with sublime Archimedean art
To breathe a soul into the iron heart
Of some machine portentous, or strange gin,
Which by the force of figured spells might win
Its way over the sea, and sport therein;
For round the walls are hung dread engines, such
As Vulcan never wrought for Jove to clutch
Ixion or the Titan:-or the quick
To convince Atheist, Turk, or Heretic,
Or those in philanthropic council met,
Who thought to pay some interest for the debt
By giving a faint foretaste of damnation
To Shakespeare, Sidney, Spenser, and the rest
Who made our land an island of the blest,
When lamp-like Spain, who now relumes her fire
On Freedom's hearth, grew dim with Empire:-
With thumbscrews, wheels, with tooth and spike and jag,
Which fishers found under the utmost crag
Of Cornwall and the storm-encompassed isles,
Where to the sky the rude sea rarely smiles
Unless in treacherous wrath, as on the morn
When the exulting elements in scorn,
Satiated with destroyed destruction, lay
Sleeping in beauty on their mangled prey,
As panthers sleep;-and other strange and dread
Magical forms the brick floor overspread,-
Proteus transformed to metal did not make
More figures, or more strange; nor did he take
Such shapes of unintelligible brass,
Or heap himself in such a horrid mass
Of tin and iron not to be understood;
And forms of unimaginable wood,
To puzzle Tubal Cain and all his brood:
Great screws, and cones, and wheels, and grooved blocks,
The elements of what will stand the shocks
Of wave and wind and time.-Upon the table
More knacks and quips there be than I am able
To catalogize in this verse of mine:-
A pretty bowl of wood-not full of wine,
But quicksilver; that dew which the gnomes drink
When at their subterranean toil they swink,
Pledging the demons of the earthquake, who
Reply to them in lava-cry halloo!
And call out to the cities o'er their head,-
Roofs, towers, and shrines, the dying and the dead,
Crash through the chinks of earth-and then all quaff
Another rouse, and hold their sides and laugh.
This quicksilver no gnome has drunk-within
The walnut bowl it lies, veined and thin,
In colour like the wake of light that stains
The Tuscan deep, when from the moist moon rains
The inmost shower of its white fire-the breeze
Is still-blue Heaven smiles over the pale seas.
And in this bowl of quicksilver-for I
Yield to the impulse of an infancy
Outlasting manhood-I have made to float
A rude idealism of a paper boat:-
A hollow screw with cogs-Henry will know
The thing I mean and laugh at me,-if so
He fears not I should do more mischief.-Next
Lie bills and calculations much perplexed,
With steam-boats, frigates, and machinery quaint
Traced over them in blue and yellow paint.
Then comes a range of mathematical
Instruments, for plans nautical and statical;
A heap of rosin, a queer broken glass
With ink in it;-a china cup that was
What it will never be again, I think,-
A thing from which sweet lips were wont to drink
The liquor doctors rail at-and which I
Will quaff in spite of them-and when we die
We'll toss up who died first of drinking tea,
And cry out,-'Heads or tails?' where'er we be.
Near that a dusty paint-box, some odd hooks,
A half-burnt match, an ivory block, three books,
Where conic sections, spherics, logarithms,
To great Laplace, from Saunderson and Sims,
Lie heaped in their harmonious disarray
Of figures,-disentangle them who may.
Baron de Tott's Memoirs beside them lie,
And some odd volumes of old chemistry.
Near those a most inexplicable thing,
With lead in the middle-I'm conjecturing
How to make Henry understand; but no-
I'll leave, as Spenser says, with many mo,
This secret in the pregnant womb of time,
Too vast a matter for so weak a rhyme.


And here like some weird Archimage sit I,
Plotting dark spells, and devilish enginery,
The self-impelling steam-wheels of the mind
Which pump up oaths from clergymen, and grind
The gentle spirit of our meek reviews
Into a powdery foam of salt abuse,
Ruffling the ocean of their self-content;-
I sit-and smile or sigh as is my bent,
But not for them-Libeccio rushes round
With an inconstant and an idle sound,
I heed him more than them-the thunder-smoke
Is gathering on the mountains, like a cloak
Folded athwart their shoulders broad and bare;
The ripe corn under the undulating air
Undulates like an ocean;-and the vines
Are trembling wide in all their trellised lines-
The murmur of the awakening sea doth fill
The empty pauses of the blast;-the hill
Looks hoary through the white electric rain,
And from the glens beyond, in sullen strain,
The interrupted thunder howls; above
One chasm of Heaven smiles, like the eye of Love
On the unquiet world;-while such things are,
How could one worth your friendship heed the war
Of worms? the shriek of the world's carrion jays,
Their censure, or their wonder, or their praise?


You are not here! the quaint witch Memory sees,
In vacant chairs, your absent images,
And points where once you sat, and now should be
But are not.-I demand if ever we
Shall meet as then we met;-and she replies,
Veiling in awe her second-sighted eyes;
'I know the past alone-but summon home
My sister Hope,-she speaks of all to come.'
But I, an old diviner, who knew well
Every false verse of that sweet oracle,
Turned to the sad enchantress once again,
And sought a respite from my gentle pain,
In citing every passage o'er and o'er
Of our communion-how on the sea-shore
We watched the ocean and the sky together,
Under the roof of blue Italian weather;
How I ran home through last year's thunder-storm,
And felt the transverse lightning linger warm
Upon my cheek-and how we often made
Feasts for each other, where good will outweighed
The frugal luxury of our country cheer,
As well it might, were it less firm and clear
Than ours must ever be;-and how we spun
A shroud of talk to hide us from the sun
Of this familiar life, which seems to be
But is not:-or is but quaint mockery
Of all we would believe, and sadly blame
The jarring and inexplicable frame
Of this wrong world:-and then anatomize
The purposes and thoughts of men whose eyes
Were closed in distant years;-or widely guess
The issue of the earth's great business,
When we shall be as we no longer are-
Like babbling gossips safe, who hear the war
Of winds, and sigh, but tremble not;-or how
You listened to some interrupted flow
Of visionary rhyme,-in joy and pain
Struck from the inmost fountains of my brain,
With little skill perhaps;-or how we sought
Those deepest wells of passion or of thought
Wrought by wise poets in the waste of years,
Staining their sacred waters with our tears;
Quenching a thirst ever to be renewed!
Or how I, wisest lady! then endued
The language of a land which now is free,
And, winged with thoughts of truth and majesty,
Flits round the tyrant's sceptre like a cloud,
And bursts the peopled prisons, and cries aloud,
'My name is Legion!'-that majestic tongue
Which Calderon over the desert flung
Of ages and of nations; and which found
An echo in our hearts, and with the sound
Startled oblivion;-thou wert then to me
As is a nurse-when inarticulately
A child would talk as its grown parents do.
If living winds the rapid clouds pursue,
If hawks chase doves through the aethereal way,
Huntsmen the innocent deer, and beasts their prey,
Why should not we rouse with the spirit's blast
Out of the forest of the pathless past
These recollected pleasures?


You are now
In London, that great sea, whose ebb and flow
At once is deaf and loud, and on the shore
Vomits its wrecks, and still howls on for more.
Yet in its depth what treasures! You will see
Though fallen-and fallen on evil times-to stand
Among the spirits of our age and land,
Before the dread tribunal of to come 
You will see Coleridge-he who sits obscure
In the exceeding lustre and the pure
Intense irradiation of a mind,
Which, with its own internal lightning blind,
Flags wearily through darkness and despair-
A cloud-encircled meteor of the air,
A hooded eagle among blinking owls.-
You will see Hunt-one of those happy souls
Which are the salt of the earth, and without whom
This world would smell like what it is-a tomb;
