In my lovely garden with a call from a rabbit; 
And, it came along to say hello to me.
Life! 
Looking at it from the other side;

What am I to write about, 
Today? 
The feeling of Nothing, 
With nothing to say? 
The molten lava, 
Life's volcano spews, 
Exacerbated, by the lies, 
Of a motley crew, 
For there are no friends, 
That's nothing, new.

What am I to write about, 
Today? 
And tomorrow, and everyday, 
When nothing really changes, 
And today is just as lonely, 
As yesterday, 
And tomorrow will be, 
Just as lonely as today
When even the Wind, 
Has nothing to say, 
What will I write about tomorrow
Gray, upon gray, upon Gray

In life’s ups and downs, good or bad
She’s always with me happy or sad
I will always long for my mother’s blessings
No matter which way my fate swings, .

Just ask her for help to do, 
And she’ll sacrifice everything for you.
If you ask me, have I ever seen god, 
Yes, it’s my mother for me, I’ll say with a nod.

To have

To just

That 
is the place
I'm searching for. 

Sitting by the window
Just a while ago
I bask in the beauty 
Of the glorious snowfall show.

Every falling snowflake
Had been assigned a unique make.
Even I was unique, more so different
No one heard my voice, my world was distant.

So taking a deep breath
On the window pane I exhaled.
The clarity of the glass disappeared
A thin sheet of fog did appear.

With my index finger
I wrote on the fog.
My outlet of feelings were these
Mere writings on the window glass.

The silent voice of my writing
Lingered for a while, 
Then it faded
Faded became my smile.

I wanted to reach out
To get my words heard
I wanted to voice my opinion
But I was always shunned.

For some, writing on the window pane
Is just a fun game.
But for me it was a way
To ease my pain.

Because my voice was surpressed time and again
But I could always go back to write on the window pane
For the window pane seemed dear
And the only one who would care to hear.


(! April,I don't remember my first steps
As child, I tried to make; 
Now, as a grown up Adult
I attempt my first steps.

For this moment, for
I am just Happy for no Reason!

My EGO Melting

While waiting
for our bag at the airport, 
I vaguely notice a man
wearing a tight, shell necklace, 
walking  back and forth.
something's a little odd about him, 
I'm not quite sure what.

You know how it is
with such waiting. My gaze
surveys the crowd for anything
interesting, then moves
back to the carousel. A little later, 

another tableau with this same man: 
two women and an old,  white-haired fellow, 
presumably family members, 
have met him. I hear the necklace guy say
he has to be back at   and  imagine
a scenario: they're going out for dinner
before he travels on. 

I turn again to look for our bag, 
but in a moment hear
behind me a terrible shriek.

Now the man with the necklace 
holds a cell phone to his ear, 
The others huddle around 
and cradle him as he sobs.

As the carousel goes round
in this gray limbo of waiting
the hidden grief of the world 
has suddenly come pouring, 
twenty feet away.

Everyone's looking
and trying not to. I glance over
at a woman near me. We mirror
concerned expressions, shoulders and arms 
raised in question. I want

to go over and embrace the screamer —
torn between that and wanting 
a curtain for his privacy.

After he's keened a few minutes, 
the ladies trundle him 
into a wheelchair and move him
down the hall. The old man
is left standing there. I approach
and ask what happened: 

'My son's son 
got killed. It was a beach
accident, in Santa Cruz.
He'd just graduated
from high school.'

The grandpa looks off
into the distance, showing
no emotion. I try 
to hug him, but succeed 
only in patting a shoulder blade.

Then the ladies come back
with another wheelchair, 
and I'm left alone, 

feeling completely helpless. I notice
that other passenger again.
Our eyes meet. We 
approach one another 
and embrace. 

My friend's former wife, 
mother of his kids, 
died yesterday, 
and this morning


thumbing through the POST, 
I came upon her picture
quite by accident, 

then that of the father
of a high school classmate.

I could feel my crossing 
into the hallowed precinct
of the obituary page,  

laminated in sincerity, 
resonant with echoes 
from the Other World 

that metaphysical
Times Square, 
where eventually
you'll come across
everyone you know. 

This is a SHOUTING poem.
Not a gentle wildflower poem
not a whispering-of-love poem
A SHOUTING POEM.

This is a POSTER poem.
Not a subtly persuading poem.
not a think-about-it poem
A POSTER POEM

This is a HARD OF HEARING poem.
A what? 
I said a HARD OF HEARING POEM

This is a LOST SPECTACLES poem
to test your sight.
No no not LAST TESTICLES
no try the next line - -
A LOST SPECTACLES POEM
now where did I put them

This is a HAVE YOU SEEN MY? poem.
I know I put it down somewhere.
Are you sure you haven't seen it? 
Oh no, you didn't use it for THAT. ? 
Why are you laughing it's not funny.
I hadn't even finished it. 

This is an ACROSS THE ROOM poem.
Read it while you're in bed
watching TV
doing the ironing
reading the newspapers
putting the new wallpaper up
combing the cat
having a bath
washing the car
talking to the neighbours
gardening
this is an ACROSS THE ROOM POEM

This is a BLOWN ACROSS THE STREET POEM
no need to run after it
and pick it up
just watch it blow
maybe wonder 
if you missed anything



The house is solid, so far surviving
fire, flood, earthquake and mud.  
Half beam, half stucco, stress cracks 
show like wrinkles in its skin,  
gathering in corners and spreading 
in fine lines across the surface, 
but going no deeper.
We live a good life here, 
hanging small victories 
in frames on sturdy walls.

I believe our buildings will outlast us, 
that our great felling blow
will start small, and with us, igniting 
like a match in a mouse hole.
What is, after all, a natural disaster? 
We know some day our reckoning
will come, just not which, or why, 
or by whom. 

The chief of the Nations! 
With code numder, 
Learn from it and be very wise, 
Valuable to the works of peace. 

The library of the congress, 
Adorned! 
Assigned, 
Why and how? 
Traces and tears.

Shadows of life! 
But, with daylight; 
The insight, 
With the right phone code for the chief of Nations.

Real and vital, 
 
Chalk, walk, talk! 
With space and time. 

It is so beautiful, nice and round
Like a balloon you blow
Spreading light across the night
With it’s warm and golden glow
White clouds cover its baldhead
As though to protect it from the eerie night
And when another cloud takes over
It says farewell and takes flight
Glowing brighter and brighter
As the night grows more and more dark
Lighting up the streets, 
My terrace and the park
Rising fast above the horizon
As though in a haste
As though it had no time to lose
No time at all to waste
It yawned and said, 
"Now nap time, let me go to the other side"
And before it went to sleep
It looked at our beautiful earth and sighed. 

A tinker, a tailor, a soldier, a sailor. 
‘A one and a two and a three and a four, guys-’

The amphibrach sings one of poetry’s basics; 
a metrical foot – though a difficult one; it
is named from the Greek, meaning short at
both ends – that is, short, long, short, short, long short; 
a poet can use it like this for a few lines, or longer; 
however, it always seems trying to be something
else – like, some poor donkey who’s lame in one hind-leg; 
it’s happier changing to dactyl or ana-
pest – see what I mean, now

Blown rose, wild, white, 
thrown by snowflaked winter wind; 
summer’s tender scent, intense, 
dispersed; no mercy; beauty, blind-
perfect petals torn by scorn, 
where will weather cast your care? 

soon there, new year’s bud be born; 
pray the maid's rose bless the yearand next to the world of heavenly gods, 
the world of ancestors-

when ageing Indian fathers heard the call
that spoke some other world, they called their son
and put to him three propositions, to which
he might then make three promises: 

this the first, to call the open mind
to gain the widest knowledge of all things; 

‘You are sacrifice, surrender – you are universal law, 
tradition, responsibility-’: this the second; then

‘You are the world – you are humanity itself—
find this and live by it..’

the father’s mind now freed; and for the son, 
continuity; and constancy; the good passed on; 
all that fathers seek, for family and son; 
and so the family lives on, in sweet redemption
of its generations, in its hopes, and in its love.

* * *

And so, I like to think, poets speak for them today
in rituals of poetry; holding in cupped hands
against the cold night winds of chance and change
the lights that pass from hand to hand, 
from mouth to mouth, from ear to ear, 
saying, remember, you are all things
in all your shining consciousness; 
you speak of all good things and pass them on
in all your glorious languages; 
you are the world, yourself, 
you are humanity


The almond petals
fall as slow as snowflakes
hoping that a poet passes. 

It was his listening; he listened 
to himself; he listened to himself
listening to his lute; his lute perforce
listened to itself; listened to itself
listening to him.. 

listened to 
the measures of all things, even
the measures of mankind..

space, air,  listened to his listening; 
listened as the eagle made a silent, 
perfect circle around a centre in its mind
high above Delphi that clear morning; 
listened to the silent cliffs across the gorge, 
silently ominous in their listening; 
the stream which trickles down past the carved theatre, 
cool and clear enough to wash your face; 
look up the mountain and hope it sacred, holy; it
plashes like curiosity pursued,  down towards the river
which is a mere pencil line at the bottom of the gorge
in this so unexpected place; 
the sea barely visible in the distance, 
misty with its myths unspoken; 

space listened and loved his music, allowed this scene; 
a cool air, this morning elsewhere hot, descends gently
down the mountain to the gorge, curves past these rocks
where a dark shadow here or there
could be where the Sibyl listened too.

we thought, boarding the hot bus, 
that we were tourists; then we looked, 
became pilgrims; then something more, 
more like worshippers of the unknown god
whose altar we left behind in Athens, 
silent beyond questions, 
listening to the space
as if the space itself
listened to some instrument well tuned, 
a voice perhaps, silent, powerful.

the sun, the sunlight, moved from rock to rock
this cool, clear morning, waking
clumps of sparse bright flowers, woken
again by morning bees
who may be unaware – or born to know—
they forage at a world heritage site as do we visitors, 
at Delphi, where still truth speaks in silence; 
bees who listen to each other, 
dance their satnav trails, 
listen inwardly to flowers, 
to honey, and what else


These weapons of literary abuse
so prevalent in the h and h century days
of literary gents in coffee-houses
have fallen into desuetude
these amicable days

but for the sake of Eng. Lit. studies
it might be useful
to run them through: 

they have Greek roots
which we should know; it keeps them tidy
in the first-aid box of the literary mind: 

there’s irony: that’s from the Greek
meaning ‘simulated innocence’; 
in practice, saying the opposite
of what you mean; the Greeks
used it in tragedy – the man who says all’s fine and dandy
as the black cloud of disaster gathers; 
we use it more for humour; as in 
‘ you’re a right barrel of laughs, Mona..’

then there’s sarcasm: in Greek, wow, 
to tear the flesh; gnash the teeth, 
or simply to speak bitterly; 
using irony (as above) , to express contempt: 
‘that meant to be funny, then-? ’

and the sardonic:  Homer used it
to describe bitter, mocking laughter, 
which for undisclosed reasons
was associated with the people of Sardinia..

Imagine, perhaps, a tinful 
of no-head-to-no-tail sardines
able to read their label.. 

Doctors’ waiting rooms. 
Dentists’ waiting rooms.
Goldfish etc.

What have goldfish done, 
what fishy business have they been up to
in the murky underworld of the unpoliced, 
to be incarcerated in public view
of the apprehensive, the fearful, 
the distressed out of mind, those bearing
all the myriad aches and pains
that flesh is heir to? 

Looking up from the Horse and Hound Gazette
which I noticed I was holding upside down
my eye was caught – or did he, or she, catch mine first? -
as if it heard my thoughts about its welfare

It swam towards me, pressed its mouth against the glass
in perfect O-shape as if singing, 
or perhaps sounding some universal Om
(the final consonant difficult to catch for the dry-eared)  
and it seemed to wish to communicate.

I sensed it was not a cry for help (and indeed, 
what help could have offered, without
a plastic bag and in view of others who still
believed me sane? No, it seemed
peaceful but chatty; even helpfully inclined.

I got up, walked discreetly as if calmly passing time
and – almost tempted to kiss the glass, but instead
simply mouthing a friendly mwaa  –
and though my lip-reading isn’t all it could be, 
I believe I identified this message: 

‘As above, so below; 
as without, so within’

Sometimes one’s view of Creation
seems to have been hitherto
singularly unimaginative


How could anyone
eat a home-cooked lemon pie
when they're really hungry

somehow, Thank You Evolution, 
or you simply must give me the recipe
just don't measure up. 

The sound of wooden rake scratching concrete.
walk nearer - rustle of dry leaves.

This, the beginning of a Japanese haiku
or maybe a Japanese film -
dry sound first, then rake, then leaves, then man -
that evokes autumn
too near the heart
to need a title

the sound stops. silence. man leans on rake. 
then match strikes, there's almost yes an echo
from the dry leaves not yet fallen from the trees
in the forest all around.

then the first tickle in the nostrils
of burning leaves which
the two-year old scrunching through the trees
hand in hand with older sister
will remember all his life
like the silence between
two lines of a haiku or
the silence of the moment when the seasons turn.

and who can say
what the golden-orange-yellow-brown trees 
slowly stripping in a rustle as of silken nightgown
to the tune of, more a whisper than a breeze -
what the trees feel
as the incense of their, their, burning leaves
steals like a last caress
for each such faithful
lover

and as she paused
at the store window
her mind which was rose-gold 
that day, poured in a
shining stream out through 
her eyes and through the plate-glass
door while the air-conditioned
dark richness of the salon
opened its black velvet arms
to greet her and even the security person
smiled at the star-sparkle in her hopes

and when she’d tried it on she walked
towards the window beckoning him
whom we had not noticed
to come in and take a closer look
honey he said you look just beautiful
how can I look at the price tag when
you look so great in it? 

when she came out and he
had melted away into the crowd
as if he had not been
she was carrying wrapped in tissue happiness
the silky slither in a shiny bag
which proved the truth
of what he might have said


There’s an infectious bug
racing through the British meeja
especially TV and radio, 
corrupting every interview, 
reducing interviewers and
viewers to mindlessness
and no-one notices, 
no-one tries to stop it: 


‘How pleased are you to have won this match? ’ or
‘How sorry are you to have lost this fight? ’

That’s on a scale of-? 

In the legal profession, that’s known as
a ‘leading question’ – as in
‘How sorry are you to have killed your wife? ’

‘Hey, wait a minute, mate, I din’ kill ‘er, 
I fort this was menna be a cor’ a law-? ’

They’re all infected – in a mere matter of a month or two..

What are you supposed to answer? 
The incompetent interviewers leave
their poor victim - modest, proud, speechless -
squirming on the hook –
how are they supposed to answer? 

‘Well, not particularly pleased, 
since he was an under-achieving also-ran
that my manager picked for this fight
as his last pay-cheque before retiring
and to boost my ratings and
my managers’ ten-per-’

‘Well, not particularly sorry, 
since my manager says the rematch will bring in
even more dosh and
it’s a sure thing and paid for
that I’ll beat him-’

*  *  *

So how pleased are you to be alive
to read this useful heads-up, 
- on a scale, say, of
Genesis to Revelation

Is there music always in the heart? 
Does it sing a fresh yet endless song? 
There are times I'm sure it must be so.

Is it singing in its waiting heart
for words to join it, tell itself in song? 
Reason says, indeed it may be so.

When a poem goes straight from ear to heart, 
its words so musical, it’s now our song, 
it sings these words: the heart is always so.



is also true, that here on earth, He blesses
some, more than others. 
It's just enough to make ye boak

But when the law forbids the habit, 
Why stand outside  
you'll just be crabbit 

So why not try and kick the habit 
You'll wonder why you ever had it

Your lungs will clear by next New year
The thought of it should make you cheer

So settle down and have a beer
And all the best for this New year


Surfacing from deep sleep, that moment
when the disciplined get up immediately, 
the self-motivated can’t wait to get on doing their life, 
the blest open their eyes with praise upon their lips, 
the tardy look with horror at the bedside clock, 
or the peremptory alarm floods the body with adrenalin, 
while the rest of us pull the bedclothes over our head
to keep the world out of ourselves, or vice versa, 
not I..

half-surfacing to some stony ledge
in the ocean of part consciousness
I am at one with every depressive, every would-be suicide, 
every spiritual down-and-out, 
every being who feels their worthlessness, 

as one inspecting carefully the contents 
of the fullish bag of a vacuum cleaner
finding there, naught for my comfort

until, if I’m lucky, some passing concern
for another human being
takes the place of fervent morning hymn
and I may feel I have some place, 
some part to play in this strange drama 
that we find ourselves thrust onstage to play, 
wondering if we learned the lines aright; 

and after this chastening roller-coaster
of humility, mayhap another chance to seek myself, 
I, dispassionately, rise. 

After that first photo-flash in mind
that signalled that there beyond where, might be
a poem waiting to be formed; 
and there followed, that strange mixture in the mind
of awe, surrender, thrill, and wonderment; 
and as the mind, now as obedient servant
beyond the asking, brought the building stuff
for this new, strange construction (though not, I noted, 
in the order that these would be used)     –

after all this, and the poem now on paper, 
I walked to the front door; and stood; and looked; 
looked like a child looks, and expects to look, 
seeing the world as gift; as ever fresh; 
no thought, no wish, the mind drained, grateful, of all thought
except the awareness of just – being allowed to be –
as the impressions flooded in, the senses sensed, 
watched, as all the – all –  passed  through 
without a judgment needed, made; 

and that portion of my mind
now free to think or not to think, 
superb in that peace that comes with freedom, 
made the connection which
was not intellect, but knowledge –
pure knowledge which was
almost silent, wordless worship of that 'that'
which is beyond name and form, yet known -

'this, this, is bliss itself; this present self is bliss'. 

At Wendy's Restaurant in San Jose, 
California, USA, 
a woman 'found' a finger, rather illy
hidden in her bowl of chilli.

The management's reaction -
and this is just no laugh -
is irony in action: 
they've had to cut the staff.

The Prosecutor's hinted -
though the amputee's not found - 
the culprit has been fingered, 
with the evidence.  

to hand. 

but suspicion's bound to linger
and fingers sure to point -
did rivals have a finger
in cutting down this joint

Words grow
Beyond the words
Beyond the self
Beyond the soul
Ah! poetry! 


One night I was in charge of the house
When my parents had gone out side
I was having loads of fun
With the radio blaring and paper planes that glide
Soon enough I got bored
So I went to the garden for a walk
When suddenly I saw a snake
Just next to a rock
It was definitely a snake
And it was the biggest one I have ever seen
It must have been a mile long
And its body was a sickening shade of green
I called the police, ambulance, fire department, 
Forest officials and held a news conference
I waited feeling excited
While I clutched at the fence
Soon enough they poured in
And peered at the snake
They were amazed at its length
But no one the snake would touch or take
They gave me facts every ten minutes about the snake
And it’s a new species discovered, I learned
Just when I was going to have a closer look at the snake
My parents returned
My father looked angrily at the crowd
I got scared and scrunched up my toes
He asked "Can you explain why these people
Are crowding around my garden hose? "Poet is a suicide bomber
For he is exinct with every explosion
But, the words fly apart
Make you bleed with their sharp edges
and he then, takes rebirth in your mind
With the brilliance of billion Suns! 
This is the fate of anyone
Who cannot close his eyes
against injustice! 


Every poet is an ion
Not an atom
Or a molecule. 
With some freed electrons
He comes in search of

It’s  been  twelve  years  in  this  school
And  memories  reign  in  my  heart. 
It’s  now  that  I  feel  you,  miss  you, 
When  we  are  all  about  to  part.

'Old  order  changeth  yielding  
Forth  to  new',  he  said.
To  my  dear  IX  Std. do  something  better, 
Better  than  what  we  had. 

To  sing  of  you  my  friends  and  teachers, 
Of  the  relationship  we  share, 
Words  will  merely  describe  them, 
Thoughts  of  love  and  care. 

To  you  my  teachers  I  express  thanks, 
Your  teachings  were  not  mere  words.
They  beautified  and  strengthened  me
And  helped  me  lead  these  sheep  in herds.

And  to  you  my  friends,  my  dearest  friends, 
I  wanna  say  nothing.
It’s  only  by  words  of  love  and  silence, 
That  I  speak  to  you  and  you  to  me.  
 
And  I  must  thank  all  my  peons
Who  worked  behind  the  scene.
They  swept  my  class  and  dirtied  themselves, 
And  yet  remained  unseen.

We  are  leaving  you  my  teachers
And  you  will  go  on  teaching, 
And  when you’ll  not  be  there, 
Through  us your  lives  will  go  on  existing.

By  and  by  this  life  will  go  on
And  I’ll  cherish  these  moments  shared  with  you.
But  I  don’t  want  these  moments  at  all, 
For  in  my  life,  friends!  I  want  you.

Many  new  flowers  will  bloom  in  life 
And  many  more  stars  will  shine.
But  without  you  my  dearest  ones
It’ll  be  hard  to  make  those  stars  and  flowers  all mine.

To  live  to  the  expectations  of  you,  my  teachers, 
And  friends  your  wishes,  I’ll  try.
Though  amidst  the  chaos  of  my  life
In  silence  my  heart  will  cry.

Thank  you  my  teachers  and  good luck  my  friends
As  we  all  bid  each  other  a  farewell.
I  hope  in  these  twelve  years  of  mine
I  have  fared  well. 

long walk at night
the breeze freezes my spirit
the moon warms it up
pulling at my poetic soul
the crickets sing their poems to the night
a million other insects contribute their share
to loosen up the night
for lovers, husbands and wives
while a tide of words too 
creeps in all directions in my mental sphere
saturates the poetic bar of the intellect
waiting to be strummed into verses
the rhythm swims along with them
as i write out verse by verse
the moon my friend shares its light
the night wind inspires
lovelorn stars wave all the way 
a million light years away
heralding the birth of a song
sparkling, twinkling 
guided by intricate orchestration of the night
before gracing the written page
long walk in the night
even the insects with the lamps
start to lend me their lights
between the twinke of the stars
they dance, sing, beat out a dance


It was only for me and me. 

And I've killed the message 
in the broad daylight 
Carefully on the highway with the spring
blooming in the sky.

It can't be shared.

Before killing the sms 
I've saved like the bios setup 
Clicking very explicitly into the zone of 
infinity at the highest order.




Time is the yellow kite on the sky 
flying with clouds among clouds; 
Time is the smallest article 
left into the evening's case.

Time is a tiny thread 
unfolded from the right hand; 
Time is an event happened
into the black eyes.

Time is a coin left into others pocket; 
Time is an evening upset into the evening.




Into the thousands megaton moon-light 
A pretty cool dream lying on the orchid petals
in an evening

A silver coin idol moon smiling to the east 
With deep desire to dance on the palm
of the firefly

But the sorrows are putting blues 
around a moon on the sky 
And composing the longest tragic song! 



Yet the sky is blue, leaves green, 
tiny bell is on the table
Yet the butterfly is sapphire, smiles violet, 
everything is within everything! 

Yet the feelings are blue, dreams little baby, 
colors are colorful
Yet the days are moving, nights are walking ahead, 
afternoons are different! 

Grammar is universal, zero goes to infinity
Feelings incubate dreams, but verses are prose! 




As the sun showed it's first ray of light
I told everyone it's time to take flight
They asked me whether the adventure would be long
I said it would'nt be if we hum a nice little song
Our destination is a very long flight to London
The decision to go there was taken very sudden
We reached there in two days, which seemed like two hours
My friends thought to change time I had magical powers
We settled down on an oak tree
In a yard that was cat free
The yard was filled with fruits
Berries, leaves and roots
We had a sumptuous dinner that day
Although there were ants, we ate it anyway
We made friends with a family of beaver
They gave us fresh fish from the flowing river
I love my new home, it's like a dream come true
Go back to my old city, a job I will never do.

Risha wrote this poem when she hadn't even turned  

If only I could fly
And soar up so high
I want to touch the sky so blue
But it never came true
I want to touch a cloud
Meet a bird that sings loud
I want to change the weather
Sit on a cloud and play with a feather
I wish this dream could come true
Or else I shall always stay blue. 


She looks straight into my brown eyes
And creeps so very near
She pulls my hair so very hard
That I say 'oh my dear! '
She crawls about and comes to me
And then she licks my face
Then she sits so quietly and 
In her mouth is a lace
She makes noises when she drinks milk
She doesn’t like her food
And  when it comes to laughing
She is very very good



Bombay to 'Mumbai'

Sad, Nobody wants

which is why the Greeks
trudged off to Delphi
to find out
if 'Know Thyself'
was consumer-friendly or
as sore-footed a path
as Oedipus trod

and if you think this 
doesn't concern you personally
let me ask you about a 'known'
that you know, but don't know
that you know 
- or have forgotten. 

that moment in childhood
that we've forgotten that we remember
when just for a moment, time stood still
and we knew we knew something
with absolute certainty
but didn't know what it was, that
we knew.

'Of the people
By the people
For the people'

                 - Abraham Lincoln

Of'f'  the people, 
B'u'y  the people, 
F'a'r  the people.

                  - 'Nawab' Rajendran

With just three letters, he redefined and tore away the pseudo face of Democracy. He was a great investigative journalist and legal activist. Sure he was the inner consciusness of Kerala. Nawab Rajendran was brutally tortured by POLICE during seventies. This man lived for us, the have-nots.
He will not sleep, even in his grave. . 

As we know 
(or like to think we do)    

There are known knowns
(we all need more love)    

There are things we know we know
(we’re not getting enough of it)    

We also know
(like I know I love you)    

There are known unknowns
(but will it last?)    

That is to say
(according to me, anyway)    

There are some things
(especially about love)    

we do not know
(is there someone better around the corner?)    

But there are also unknown unknowns
(scary but exciting – flip those sex-tech tomes)    

The ones we don’t know
(and hey, who cares?)    

we don’t know
(and, will we love it when it comes?)An active eco-warrior he; 
he loved all trees and frogs; 
that's why, before he drowned, he upped
and shot the legs off dogs. 

Dawn entered on time. The warning flash 
of lightning like a conductor’s upraised baton
demanding thunder’s drumroll
echoing round the mountains. Salzburg
was never so musical. In his garden
a pulsatilla flinched with joy. Beneath
his fast pen, music wrote itself.  In this house, 
the waterpipes made music with the cistern, 
doors made harmony with window catches; wet shoes
with wooden chairs scraped back. Mathematics
scrawled on walls sang number.
Piano lessons were from youth to age, 
no need of cane for errant fingers. Yet 
too many masters still to come; for him
never a false chord save in life. 

The phone’s just rung: ‘Hi this is Rosie
you’ve been selected for a five-day
luxury cruise to the Bahamas’-

dreams, dreams, dreams

one of the few things all religions, all philosophies
are agreed on: it’s the state
between waking and sleeping.
beyond that, they’re rather coy.

for Freudians, precious clues; 
for Jungians, universal archetypes; 
for other theorists, just
a mental and emotional shit, conveniently
achieved without a convenience

but for religion and philosophy, pretty much
a keep-off territory: maybe there’s a church somewhere
where they sway and sing
ah’m dreamin’ YOU sweeet Jeeezuzz
and if so, does it work? 

and we seem to have such individual dreams: 
mine are such a bore, forever
missing that last train; the more I walk
the further home’s away-

whereas a friend who lived through the Nazi occupation, 
beloved, inventive grandfather, 
actor, writer, director, teacher, 
dreams without cease of killings, murders –
surely he deserves better of his dreams? 

another friend claims he never dreams; 
this annoys me intensely for some un worthy reason: 
but how can I prove him wrong? 

maybe it’s the last frontier for 
the good starship Commercial Enterprise: 
‘Dream yourself to all you ever wished
in ten easy lessons: send 
a stamped, self-addressed rainbow
to Somewhere Over Inc.-’

do we really have to leave it to Hollywood? 
must all our dreams these days be violent daydreams, 
regardless of expense? or do we need that violence
to wake up to a loving kiss; to love life’s pastel shades; 
to smell the roses round the door

My family went on a vacation
 I gave my father all the persuasion
Can I go and wander in the forest
To catch at least a tiny little pest
Very dangerous it is for you to go there
There will be a lion, tiger or a big black bear
He told me, to these things pay heed
But I thought these are things I don’t need
I went to the depth of the forest
But couldn’t catch a single pest
Thinking about things I shouldn’t care
A lion, tiger or a big black bear
I started going towards a cave
Suddenly a loud roar it gave
I thought this was a good part of my vacation
When suddenly I felt suffocation
I heard the loud roar again
I felt as if I was trapped in a monster’s den
The loud roar had really given me a scare
It could be a lion, tiger or a big black bear
First it’s my life I have to save
I quickly ran out of the cave
To these things I should pay heed
Go to that cave I won’t dare indeed


Sometimes memory
runs back like an instant fast rewind
like it’s said to do at death
and hits you wham between the eyes
with your own life

today – what, November – I was
chilling out in the pub
again
relaxing into life
and there, framed in the window was
a lady (as she was today)   crossing the road
dressed, this cool-cold day, in black tights and
the red-
took me back so many years
that I didn’t know whether to be grateful
for the glimpse, or
regret the fast grey years between-

it must have been when I was two and a half
and for the first time in my life
my parents sought a hint
(first time in their lives too)  
walked oh so casually with me through 
the glittering store as if for
no-one, everyone, anyone
but me - and there it was –
the pedal car in gleaming, buy-me red
with all the details I still can’t bear to describe
enamelled like a glimpse of paradise

there it was – except –
(I punctuate like Emily D when out of breath-)  
in blue

how can a child be adult enough to be
grateful for a second-best? And how
can parents be a child again and know? 

I had forgotten until now how the seasons had their colours –
pink Valentines almost merging into complex mauve in
Easter cards, and icing, marzipan, and yellow chicks, summer days
needing no coloured herald but the sun
then autumn colours ambivalent
with the apprehension of new classes, and
new threats-

and all this time, at just this time of year
of paradise; promised; lost; 
perhaps, regained


As butterflies with beauty grace the air, 
so love cannot be lazy in its love; 
true love brings lovely energies to bear; 
love's actions grace the true contemplative.

devoted action is the path we tread
when stirred at first by love of love's first  cause; 
to purge our souls of that we wish us rid; 
such tasks may grace our caterpillar days.

humility - which is to know pure self, 
seen clearly as the light of bad and good -
brings contemplation's share in godly wealth; 
those shining works which are love's neighbourhood; 

as butterflies with beauty grace the air. 

I wanted to write to you about your poems, 
that is, about something I couldn't quite put my finger on
so I didn't write in case it sounded inconsequential
and it's silly to write to a poet who handles words so expertly, 
inconsequentially..

Inconsequential. That's it. I appreciate that you want to stress
life's inconsequentiality - this happens, that happens, but
we're none the wiser - that's a modern concern, I appreciate, 
no neat wrapping life up with a brisk end-rhyme. 

but how can I put this tactfully, inconsequentiality
or is it tangentiality
can seem to the reader eager to extract meaning
that is, the poet's meaning, as near as can be. 
inconsequentiality can seem.  

obscure. 
for this very reason, since it's difficult
to share the same inconsequentiality
if you see what I mean

and this unintentional obscurity
can sometimes seem
of course I know you wouldn't
but let's say to an uninformed superficial reader -
like pretension? 

I hope you don't mind my mentioning this
it's only because I do admire your writing so much
and I know that the prizes and awards you've won
proves that no-one could possibly accuse you of pretension
it's just that I thought I should say how it seems
to a very ordinary reader. I hope you will read this
in the spirit it's meant. And I do look forward
very much to reading your next book
now the library stocks them. 

It's the word you hear
when anti-French views are aired -
MERDE! 

when their secret liaisons have been publicly bared -
MERDE! 

when they lose a lover for whom they deeply cared -
MERDE! 

when a planned seduction hasn't fared -
MERDE! 

when a promising mistress is running scared -
MERDE! 

when by censorship their free speech is impaired -
MERDE! 




I'd known her all my life, 
nursed her for seven years
night and day

yet when last night I lay down to sleep
I heard myself say
as if to someone else, 

what a splendid lady, 
I wish I'd known her better'

We begin by loving our parents; '


'later, we hate them; 
rarely if ever do we
forgive them. '

I'd like to live long enough
to forgive them; 
then, 
go somewhere where
I can tell them I love them, 
always did, always shall. 


Dear, 

When I could listen to
Your heart-beats on mine, 
Call it love! 

When we could listen to
Our heart-beats in unison, 
Call it life


A funny thing happened
on the way to the New Age
around the year  
as the Celestial Seasonings
herb tea company
seemed to be creating
a new world all by itself, 
one smelling of chamomile, 
peppermint and peach.


Coffee and coca-cola
appeared to be living
on borrowed time

until at the last minute, millions
of people panicked and said, 

'Stop! Don't take into extinction
the drink I had after my first kiss, 

or the one I could smell
Dad brewing every morning
my first years
as I came downstairs! '

Vision is one thing, 
true surrender
quite another. 


Dear Leonard Cohen, 

Strumming and singing
my favorite songs of yours, 
all from your first couple albums, 

still eases me into
a vantage point
nothing else I know
has ever approached, 

a place in my heart
nothing else has reached.

Yes, it is salted with tears, 
but the tears 
make everything green there
shine with unearthly beauty, 
and reveal somehow the holiness
of all the lost souls.

I have no clue
by what alchemy
you are able
to sing sorrow

in a way that brings
such a stillness, 
such a sense of beauty, 
if not joy.

They come and snuggle
under me like baby chicks.

Rested, they venture forth again.
Now they 
become eyes, 
buttonholing people on corners: 
'Pssst—help you see? '

Each one has a mission.
Some reveal the hilarity
in the composition of matter.
Some spread the word
that the sky is falling. 
Others announce a shout
of joy everywhere at AM.

They come from somewhere
I can't even see.


They go for rides with strangers.
Like any parent I worry.

When they come home for the night, 
some tell me where the've been.
Others don't say a word.

There's nothing I can do.
I gave what  I could.
Now they're on their own. 
 

Sometimes the poems roost
in a tree outside my window, 
making so much noise
I can’t sleep at night, 
so I can scarcely wait 
till fall, when they'll all 
fly south.


Once I lost my pen.
Words welled up inside my head
until I looked hydrocephalic.
They started to ferment, 
and I walked around dumb
with a big smile on my face.

 
They need
to go out in the world
and get a job.
They're big rocks
that need to become sand.


This is a bit off the subject, 
but this afternoon I made soup, 
feeling tired the whole time.
Ten minutes after I served it
at dinner, everyone 
at the table
was asleep

"That'll be the day" he sang, the boy the crowd adored.

The singers died on impact, they lay still where they were found
The twisted wreckage of their plane lay scattered all around; 
the wicked whistle of the wind; a hollow, mocking sound.

Three minstrels dead, the papers said, the day after they went down.
Other, lesser, voices mourned as we placed them in the ground.

Do you recall where you were when you heard the news and cried? 
The sad news of Buddy Holly's fate, the day the music died. 

I’ve extracted you
from my body
like a sliver-

a memory thirsty, burrowed deep
In flesh that’s festered beyond discomfort.

and like a memory
the contusion remains, 
reminding me to erect the ruins ‘round
a fevered tomb- once dwelling for the sacred
book of myths known to the lonely
as love.

you should have been a better god. 

If my life were a paper, 
I would have brightened it with colours.
If my life were a vase, 
I would have decorated it with flowers.

If my life were a kite, 
I would have flown it in the sky.
If my life itself were an answer, 
I would have never asked it 'why'.

Oh alas! My life is but human.
It's nothing but a lively statue.
All I can be is a doyen, 
Who can be a showcase of these virtues! 



i wish to be the air you breathe
love that floods your every cell
revitalising you, cheering you up
every second of your life

i love like the rush of the Nile, Yangtze -
listen, listen to this lovelorn heart, 
holding on, letting go, holding on 
with such tenacity to the hope 
of every lovelorn night

an eclipse helps distill
my love for you, 
seals your charms, allure
from the craving prying eyes 
of the world, precipitates that 
momentuous silhouette, 
escapade for me and you
sun and moon, yin and yang
to be totally absorbed 
in bliss, in each other

love, love, love
if only i could be the only star
to win your fancy 
for that sparkling while
heaven the world would become


Ever since I set foot in school for my new academic year
It looks like luck has abandoned me
My bus came late to pick me up for school
So guess who is punished, me! 
In the first few days we were given so much homework, 
So many projects to make, 
So many tests to prepare for
I thought my head would break
The teachers are very strict
And on craft items, my pocket-money I will have to spend
And nowadays the level of homework given has increased so much
That doing your homework is the latest trend
What’s more, to make matters even worse
My best friends have been shuffled now
I want to see them, but where’s the time
To them how can I talk, how? 
And these days I am always
Forgetting to do my homework
Now my memory’s failing me
And all I can do is sulk
I can describe class V
In nothing but a deep sigh
Wait I just remembered I forgot,


We are waiting for the baby
To smile its sweet smiles
We are waiting for the baby
To touch the nursery tiles
We are waiting for the baby
To say its first word
We are waiting for the baby
To taste its first curd
we are waiting for the baby
To eat its first snack
We are waiting for the baby
To give us all a smack


It's the promise of the sunrise, is it not, 
that pulls us out of bed, 
knowing a divine wave
has washed the world 
clean overnight, and today

we may remember the combination
and the Door may finally 
open to the true world, 
the same world as yesterday
but re-united with its depths, 

and life will finally fulfill its promise, 
all beings walking about
with an unspeakable grace
upon holy ground, 

laughing and loving
from one sacred activity to another, 
the windows of buildings
looking out fully aware 
and the traffic

dancing consciously
to the music of the spheres. 


Time! 
With the muse of life; 
 A. 

M. in the land of your muse.
To, too! 
With the muse of your sleep; 
Of, off! 
To prepare your mind for the next day; 
Greet, great! 
Like the eyes of the moon; 
In, Inn! 
On the west side.
Ball, ballot! 
With the muse of the new moon in sight; 
Train, pertain! 
With the muse of the morning dew. 

You adore the idea of this thing called love, 
Kisses and romance I'm just so sick of.
I believe love is an infection, something caught a virus, 
Like your favorite flower, for instance like mine an iris, 
Pretty in the ground, but after it’s picked will wilt and die, 
Like love you adore the idea, but in the end you cry.
After infected with this horrible hallmark disease, 
You'll smile but wait remember it's a temporary tease, 
As soon as it settles it, it takes over and will spread, 
When taken over you'll do things and lose your head.
You'll do things you never dreamt you'd do, 
The wasted time and don't forget bills you'll accrue.
In the end you will sit there like that picked iris, 
Heart wilted bank account drained nothing but a virus.



Desire came and hugged 
Dream called and kissed 
Appetite detained me and 
Kicked— on the rend life

Naughty mosquito's teeth
On my sleepy imagination 
Space is my latent existence
Affluent love— the silent killer





Slice the yesterday
Like the onion
And feed the tomorrow

Slice the love
Like the bread
And feed the dream

Slice the moment
Like the silence 
And feed the desire

Slice the life 
Like the time
And feed the death

On the edge of moment
You are still alive




Laughing demons were deep blue 
Sky was frightened on the skyward 

Scorching sunbeam marched on 
The dusty yellow leafs were diffused

A sparrow was crying somewhere 
Breezes were walking silently

Time was settled into the legs
Like the roots of a large tree

Nothing happened but a train left
And she was inside the train




Passion emerged 
Beyond Oxford dictionary
As the high-rise windows 
Love crying air

I don't cry but listen to 
The crying music
At last, I'm really alone 
With your shadow


When the kites fly in the sky
Like lovely tall ladies 
A dark cloud extends 
To the north-west horizon

Unseen aroma of pollen 
Still spreads desire like magician
Exists like happiness
Without length width or height

But grief cuts heart 
With a silent scissor
As soft like marmalade
As sour as tamarind

Is the grief final
As the death
For one and all
For living and non-livings





Two house lizards— hugging 
Under florescent lamp
Making love— love stops at lust

Lust is the last station— get down 
East-west-north-south beckoning
Let's move— but where is home 

Homeless soul— run and run
Floating imagination poetic cool
Summer follows— to blaze

Like house lizards— confined
Within love-lust boundary 
Fortune burns life effectively






Life is dead shell 
Rotten and spreading bad smell
Who will take that

Flickering lantern of winter night
Put out in the dark
Even then remorse wakes up

Always lifeless
But stone is still valuable
Alive over ages

Life is glittering rain particle 
Gradually driven 
At last into soil



In front of me going the years
Increasing the meter reading of tears
I have tried a lot between us
At least one connecting bus
 
You made me just half
Mind is now so rough
What I really need
Don't know indeed
 
You are my world still
Feelings come and go
Baby you don't know
Memories how can I kill
 
At last I became needless
Easily anyone can guess
Years span became in vein
Life is now non-stop rain


maggie was the girl 
interested in tom
but it was milly 
who eventually got married to 
maggie's sweetheart 
molly is the girl interested in john 
but it was may who eventualy 
tie the knots with john
six years down the road
milly and may found themselves 
at the crossroads of their marriage
wallowing in pity of their husbands
in a cafe with maggie and molly
the latter's children 
calling milly and may aunties
uncles in somebody's arms
maggie and molly couldnt
believe their ears
all the tears in milly's and may's eyes
could have been theirs
that their once sweethearts
could turn so lousy and dull
both said they would talk them out
friend pinkly cleverly asked
whether they are glad
they were not married to
tom and john
to which maggie and molly
laughed and said 'no'
in their hearts were these words: 
'serve the two bitches right'. 


Grilled roasted or smoked chicken 
Desire or money— which is more significant 
Isn't important— if demand is sought
Putting food on tongue in imagination 
Drawing graph of power and dosage 
Decision could be taken aptly 

Neither there was nor there be any debate 
Debate never wakes up 
From physical-mental ethereal pleasure

Days spent darning dreadful times 
Laying on the new or old bed-sheet
Trees uprooted with fruitless shaking
Cell phone buttons waned 
Gradually like shoe sole 
Path splashed up on pathless wild trail 
While walking alone

Red-eyed dusk like owl
Sharp teeth of tiny mouse 
As the notch of carpenters file
Midnight shouts harsh
As crocodile like house-lizard
Cockroaches dance classical way 
Within the interplay of light and shade 
But hesitation never sprouted 

Not the day after night
Nighttime arrived roaring laughter
Dark tweaked to deep murky
After the last day of last fortnight 
Not the moon— deep-black clouds 
Set up cluster of tents in the sky

Balloon of fallacious time perforated 
By the nocturnal animals
Time went mutely on quick march
Flash of lightening moment added salt 
To the disordered mind and threw 
On the corrugated iron sheet roof 
At the midsummer sweltering day

Where am I standing now 
On the knee-deep water of sinking land 
Or washed out in the Saturday night's wave
Besides the crematorium's river 

Sleeping alone in the underground furious cell 
With the treasury of jewels like mummy
Dim demand line intersecting 
The diffused marginal utility curve
On the slope-way of life
And entered into the dark quicksand

Wearing desire sit knelt down 
To a deep-blue precious stone
No other second stone is there 
To light a fire of existence

 
Forgetting the daily grammar 
From the center of gravity of a polygonal want 
Gauging the center of circle's core utility 
Going a little ahead slowly
All of a sudden slipped noiselessly 

White bear is moving around frosty destination 
Compass went into hiding— fled away the target
Friendless daily adventure 
To the posterior feelings

The pigtail of collapsed sensation 
Removing lice with condolence 
With millions of cells daily
Whirling round and round 
Within narrow circumference 
No tree attached black badge on pocket
No cosmic tremor is recorded 

In the tranquil twilight 
Nature put on ornament of lights 
As if a cluster of small fishes 
Going against the stream to hunting trap
Candles of the illumination go out one by one 
A giant parasite on the soul
Unseen destructive beast injured the body 
Forgetting all possible directions 
Searching road heather and thither 

Paths has been eaten up by the infrastructures
Flattering shadow spread wings 
Over dislocated brain-cell


I am dubious sighted deaf and dumb 
Like an extremely senior person

Eclipse of impassable misfortune 
Is attached as the glue on my forehead
I have read the palm of space
In the moonlight at midnight
Backbone fractured on greasy algae 
Days are going to the down stream 
Struggling frantically to keep afloat

Lastly hoisting rend shirt on the top of solitude
Cool calligraphy of misfortune 
Set up on the helpless garret 

On the moment of taking decision
Decision itself hanged with a rope 
On the branch of excised banyan tree
Investigators are in deep waters 
During post-mortem session

Still amazing dreams beckon 
Trust is playing snake-ludo with soul
Snakes biting— restarting every time
I have lost both legs— but going ahead on crawl



On the hill top— Tillaghar, Sylhet
Round rest shed— Wooden pillars

Year  on a pillar 

Spring noon— weeping vegetation
Cool jade green breeze

I will never know who they were
But now I always feel 
An unseen impatient spore 
At old-night inside my pillow





Stormy time stirring 
Rainy breeze hiking
Shooting stars fading
Quickly in the space 

Frosty poles melting 
Bit by bit gradually
Octopuses catching
Fish under deep sea

Laughing morning
Crying at evening
Chicken to die and 
Evening grills life

Yesterdays hanged 
Todays are creeping
Orchids still breed 
In the unseen bush




Around us killing or murder 
Dew from the atmosphere on the grass
Breaking heart or rape
Glass from the table on the floor
Stealing or mugging 
Boost up wallet like the balloon
Bribe or speed money 
Top gear dream on the hill top


Numerous events
Like the germinated mushrooms 
Posters banners and billboards 
Pieces of dark chips

Around us— at least someone
Cruel more than leopard
Dangerous more than snake
Deadly more than weapon

Bully brute beast
Someone— I, you or s/he


I believe with William Morris
that there should be nothing in the house
which is not known to be useful
or seen to be beautiful.

So I'm filing for divorce.

But which of us should go 
first

everything in Creation
is as holy as its Creator
how could it be otherwise? 

the cow
has been the centre
of the Vedic culture 
these last few thousand years
fed with love 
and yielding milk and calves

and cowpatties
which when dried
provide the fuel which
the saints say is the best
for use as the domestic fire

of food it is said
the first part supports the body
and the second part the soul
while the third part falls
to support the earth

Wordsworth found immortality
amid the daffodils
but see here in the next field –
the cows are grazing as peacefully
as poets

poets who see the world
in awe and wonder
as the supreme machine
whose every part
is wholly of the whole

mind how you tread
this ground is holybright banquet-hall in darkest night -
swallow flies in, through, out -
from where, to where


I’ve never seen him just like this before.


Crouched at the entrance to the largest run, 
the burrowed-out soil in front of it
ground to dust by many eager legs
hopping, skipping out of the dark warren -
he’s totally silent, totally still. It's awesome.
This isn’t the puppy who goes wild at rabbits
in a frenzy of excitement, wet nose intoxicated by
a thousand trails of scent, scattering
white tails into burrows, barking wildly
(are they friends or enemies, in this joy?)  
at the sheer excitement of the chase, 
puppy paradise; but now..
this is serious stuff.


at first sight, you could think he’s resting, he’s so still; 
his back legs haunched down under him, looking
like the sphinx itself, immobile, waiting for the question
it’s waited for through thousands of wise years; 
may only answer in this sacred silence; 
his nose and head and throat almost flat upon  the ground
(this is no time for his 'Tailwaggers' League' identity disc to rattle)  
as if at the epicentre of
some invisible geometry of scent and earth-echoed sound, 
his ears poised, half-lifted on instant muscles; 

he’s the image of relaxation, at first sight: 
but a stillness packed with potential energy
wound as ready on electric nerves as in a spring; 
a silence so intense it’s thrilling, 
full of alertness; a silence right inside his head
that teaches silence, stillness: he’s carrying
no sense of future: he’s living a continuous present, 
waiting for the senses to tell him something.
There’s nothing else in the world to do, right now.

A fox terrier flat on the ground at the entrance
to a mere rabbit-hole; we’ve never found a foxhole, 
we two; should I apologise to him? If we had, 
he’d be in there like a flash; sheer life-or-death ferocity; 
but here, nevertheless, it’s serious stuff; 
this is what thousands of years of dog
have made him for; that, and what he and man
have learned together from each other; bred in him; 
while this present man gazes awestruck at the species
in its perfection of action, action contained in stillness, 
stillness and silence containing all the senses, 
all contained in knowledge, awaiting, perfect, pure, 
what the cosmos will reveal in its good time.


Has my dog just shown me, taught me, 
how a poet should await a poem

With all the excitement of a Florentine writer around who's just heard about the new invention of printing
and has plans to use it bigtime
I'm sitting here at the PC, one of
the first generation of mature writers
who can bring to a lifetime's experience
the web's recall of every great and relevant word
recorded since the beginning of recorded time and thus
pigmies on the shoulders of giants
and what happens
the excitement's gone to my


In the spirit of the season
I'm working on a big-hearted, 
multi-faith, inter-faith, lack-of-faith
religiously correct yet thinking outside the box (x     
all-inclusive but not syrupy or anodyne
seasonal greetings card
(or will the mention of season
offend non-seasonalists?)    




Greetings to all our enemies -
please don't abandon your principles, I'm not asking that,  but
can we draw a little nearer this year? 

Greetings to all pagans -
we all would like to pop round for a merry drink or two and a hug
but can we do it indoors? Merry
mistletoe, etc. - wrap up well! 

Greetings to all atheists -
enjoy your year all the more since
there's no One to thank except possibly
Intelligent Design? 

Greetings to all agnostics -
should I hope that  this year is
the year you make that big decision and
leap that big leap off
the fence of fierce, barbed intelligence - or
will life be the duller for it, for you? 

Greetings to all humanists -
hope you feel really human all year and
don't lose faith in humanity, and please
spread it around especially
among those who have an over-developed
sense of sin.  

you could put the fun back in
fun-damentalist..

Greetings to all bah-humbugs -
who have better reason each year
to condemn the commercialisation
of the season - take the phone off, 
disconnent the intercom at the door, 
and have a really good time to yourself which
many of us pretend to envy you. 

and 

Greetings to all those who, while
not really believing in anything too much
or too little either, 
go through the motions, wreck their bank balance
for the sake of others - may you
emerge from the season - nay -
live the whole year -
with an unexpected greater warmth of heart - for
you are the salt of the frozen earth

and I suppose finally

Greetings to those without a heart -
may you enjoy all 
that you wish yourself
and who knows



I gazed across the valley
at the mute, brown hills beyond, 
dappled with dark, round, oaks, 
that remind me of Africa's veld.

'What lies beyond you, hills? '
I asked, trying to peer
with imagination's eye
beyond and beyond and beyond, 
into the heart of the world.

But the mist of my small, measured mind, 
the haze of my limited life
grabbed onto the hills as I peered, 
and I could not see beyond. 

In the glass case, a Gutenberg bible—
only three like it left in the world.
Surprising myself, I started to cry, 
there in the Library of Congress, 

as though we were seeing 
a Platonic form
instead of a physical thing.
In a sense, the millions of books
in this and every library, 
in all the Barnes & Nobles' and Borders' 
and the ones on my bookshelves at home
all descended from this book.

In a glass case nearby
an almost identical bible, 
handwritten by scribes, 
took years to produce—
a labor of love, no doubt, 

but Gutenberg granted 
every poet the dream 
that his own words in print 
might encircle the world.

(Now I'll go home and type this 
and click. It will un-write itself 
into a flow of electrons
like the ones in my brain 
that gave it birth, 

a swarm of bees 
speeding across the world
to rearrange themselves 
a few seconds later 
so these words 
can form on your screen.)young women,  old women
in their heart
despite the years
the yearning to be beautiful

young women, old women
they look at each other
one with envy
the other with fear and contempt (of the wrinkles, old age)        

young women, old women
they look into each other
one for a  mother
the other for a daughter


Love sweet love, 
Sleeping in your room alone; 
Still waiting for someone! 
The one to touch your heart, 
Deeply with the muse of true love. 
 Hours with your love! 
In your land, 
In your room, 
Dreaming of that day; 
Love sweet love, 
Alone! ! ! 
But, still waiting for that day; 
To share your dreams with someone you love. 

The flesh, 
The flash! ! 
Light, 
Bright, 
Attack! ! 
The blood, 
 A. M.; 
In your land, 
With the negative works of mankind.
Pose, rose! 
For the insight, 
With the sight around; 
Hoping to get away from your attackers. 

Another Nightmare! ! ! 
Hearing the noise, 
Hearing your voice, 
Hearing your cry! 
 a. 

m. in your room. M with your muse! 
Taking care of yourself; 
And, to set your mind on positive things only.
Life, 
Don't boil the honey with your acts! 
For, we need peace than war.
Cain, pain! 
As Satan came along to entice you; 
With promises which cannot be fulfilled.
Illegal lust! 
It seems very calm in the very eyes of the storm; 
As the flood came through the waterway, 
But, inspired by the truth to wake up early! ! 
At  M with your muse.
Life, love, peace! 
Officially noted with your works; 
But, Satan came along to test you, 
With the pleasures of the world.
Drone, clone! 
And, with complexities; 
Deep and large! 
Narrow and tight; 
Wide and easy.
To make your choice, 
With the choices of life laid bare before you; 
Broad and nice! 
And, to dance with the tail of Satan around you; 
But, try to watch the bread offered by the evil one and be wise. 


lady on rocks overlooking the bay
still there with her pretty parasol
she's waiting for her gentleman
who left for sometime full moon
foxes didn't howl nor craters moan
river does flow vigorously on and on

she looks at me with question's
in her inquisitive mind, i cower
i don't feel giving any answer
to her dismay she throw her shoes
that was worthy reasonable cause
i pick; put her hands on her hips.. 

pauseclouds sap my energy
looking trying to comfort
fleeting voices in sky
i should visit my pillow
early to re-arrange
these feathers mulching

i end up watching bulls
manhandled by hawks
where is mike, yes mike
he is playing golf now
people change with time
you might be left behind

maybe i'm mean today
i took my time working
unaware they're waiting
should have ask questions
why they're walking about
they're hearing minutes

i could have push early
instead i went to lunch
and have fun watching 
beauty of sea rippling
where fishes pops out
chasing their live meal


strange i have headache
i never have for long time
could be weather change
or my eyes is doing tricks
too much exposure to tv
i need new prescription

i sleep on it but still there
i'm one of few who doesn't
take medication for minor
aches, i believe it enhance
my endurance to pain, true
i recommend it for you


anguish has subside
to sobbing episode
outburst came to still
comparable to faucet
after closing a valve
there's that tiny drip

realizing time to mend
time to heal wounds
deep or surface bruise
beauty of coming together
lies with smooth process
i love to end with a kiss


yard sprinkler wipe her fingertips
on my window to, to wake me up
it took away those grimes; clear
now i can see sky much better
it does that spiral dance; pretty
there would be rainbow if it is day

dew had fallen vanished to roots
traveling through viens of green
contributing to growth but inch
still so nice are happy to have it
i keep my quarter for fun beat
my neighbor that's chores he hates


ground must be wet from yesterday
i see overflow going to street's drain
wasteful; a word i could come about
maybe moisture sensor fails to act
noon; i would surely troubleshoot that 
hoping that would cost me less bucks

she could have heard me it did stop
retract its head and hide beneath grass
leaving doushed leaves and happy heart
but still i will check for effeciency; no doubt
it might happened again that could be sign
it is breaking apart right on my very eye



It's a perfect evening after work, 
the air so balmy my body seems
to dissolve in the breeze, 

and I'm sitting at an outdoor
table at the Buckhorn Grill
on one of those new, 
faux-European streets, 
waiting for our take-home salads, 

chomping ice and enjoying, 
really enjoying, Billy Collins' poems —
laughing out loud at some, smiling big
as  realization dawns
of what he's doing in others.

I suddenly realize a few diners
are looking at me, 
then at the cover of the book, 

pigeonholing me in public
as a lover of poetry, 
probably a crazy poet myself, 

and my joy reaches a pinnacle, 
some sweet 
paralysis of perfection. 


Heat and fatigue, do not call me to watch
TV, I cannot feign interest when feverish, 
a fire burning in my forehead, flames in
my cheeks, let me escape into my book

Our physical world is just one expression of a 
manifold possibilities, a background hum on
the note of B-flat is detected by physicists in
this vibratory universe

I am vibrating to a scream on high C, the Magic
singing a razor-sharp aria in me, yet reading
about reality as a spiritual entity

Lifts my thoughts away from my body to a
world view of wonder, creating enough
space to set me free from the debilitating
symptoms of the allergy. 



loneliness
his childhood
warms him up

loneliness
he warms up to
his childhood

loneliness
childhood
his heaven

loneliness
his childhood
a repository of warmth

meditation
my heart on
a sea of sublimity

so lonely
a poem helps fill out
the emptiness

loneiness
the world
a graveyard 

so lonely
i cheer up myself
writing a poem about loneliness

so lonely
i write a poem  to fill out
the emptinessborn to walk


to climb
to say i can
cannot even
remember
the day I strung
a comprehensible line
because i am born to do wonders
soaking in knowledge
the way i had learnt to talk
the brain energy
that seeps into
every frame of animals
every part of the universe
to uncover god's puzzles
and divine codes
to turn them into
jets that fly at
einstein's speed of light
and this physique
to work an eternal clock
the way a child learns
to walk, to dance, to talk


He finds the body of the old man, 
Pale, as they all are, 
Drained.
He shakes his head, 
Knowing.
Knowing the cursed nightmare
The man would soon exist in. 
He could sense her, somehow-
Some shred of her former life, 
Leaving its residue behind her.
Tears stream down the face of the Hunter.


It has become
Irreversible.
-Never again will she live, 
For she is now dead, 
And doomed.-
He knows in that instant
What he must do.
Lover - enemy, 
Blurred into one, 
But enemy first.

Anger burns hot in his chest, 
A lust for vengeance
Upon the thousand year terror. 

He fears for her, 
Irredeemably lost.
Behind her she will leave


A trail-
Of dead, 
Of Changed. 

Anger, 
Hatred, 
Love, 
Determination, 
Burn in his eyes.
Nemesis is on the hunt. 

Mare, bare, dare, pare, stare, rare, are; 
Can you cross over this river? 
Bongo, Congo, Togo, mango, logo; 
And, at  A. 

M.; 
Then, think twice before crossing over this river.

To serve others and to help others, 
Flare, care, hare, fare, glare, tare, ware; 
And like the sweet smell of the air! 
But, be very humble as a child.

In the desert of love, 
At  A. 

M.! 
Made from honey and water; 
With small sizes and big sizes, 
But, shame the devil and be free with your life! 

Muse! 
Like a chief and a farmer; 
Life! 
Be strong and believe in Yahweh; 
Muse! 
Like a passing thought; 
Life! 
Like a passing glance; 
Love! 
It will touch your heart; 
Love! 
Like flowers kissing each other; 
But, you are waiting for tomorrow morning.

Autodidact! 
Teaching yourself with the muse of your autograph; 
Sold, solder! ! 
With the peace of your mind; 
Life! 
Searching and waiting for your turn; 
Since, the muse of your life is moving on like the pendulum.

Flowing waters! ! 
From the top of the mountains; 
But, we are one Family on this earth.
Life! 
Living with nautre; 
But, with the rules.
Life! 
With something sweet and somehing bitter; 
As we go along with the muse of nature.
Love! 
With the magic moments; 
 AM with your love, 
Waitinf for the rising of the sun. 

Along the way, 
 Hours to meet the train; 
Life! 
I will go where love is; 
Because, hatred and war cannot solve my problem.

Way, away! 
Far away to your hometown; 
Taking the Train to reach your heart.
Dress, digress! 
With the sweet muse of my mind along the way.

Hidden companion! 
With the tail of a swan; 
I will go where love is.
Tiny, tinny! 
 Hours on the way with the train to meet you. 

i love you for no reason
except because i love you
as simple as one times one  equals one
yet if you remain one and wish for a hundred
i would work to add up the rest for you -
to prove to you the volume of my love


you have moved away
called me 'mad
sickeningly possessive'
publicly humiliated me
for my leaning onto you for affections
they are merely gusts of wind
that turn the wind compass
to the the right side of you
all your wonderful characteristics

i love you for no other reason
except because i love you
your happiness, mine
your injury, tears, mine

even if this love should really bother you
i would that you could find
someone to love you more
even if it means giving you a helping hand.

i love you for no other reason
except because i love you
your happiness is mine
and your injury, minelove, oh what is love? 
flowers in so many shapes and hues
giving sweetness  to butterflies and bees
in so many shapes and hues
in the field, a buzz, a joy, these insects
help create another world 
another paradise, warm colourful  flower garden
for lovers of the world
help spread cheers everywhere
with the sweetness  the flowers 
where the flowers are, the butterflies, the bees are
where there is love, joy spreads
wide as the field
just look at the butterflies and the bees
how they cheer up  the field with their  songs and dance



I felt very sad yesterday, 
The dog had been beaten up ruthlessly.
Somebody had beaten it up with a stick, 
And the dog served the very same man for the entire night.


Why did we do all that? What were we looking for
When we stood conspicuously outside our cars on summer nights
In our madras shirts, white levis and loafers without socks
Along the parking diagonals in the median lane of Balson 
In front of the high school that indentured us most of the year? 

Why did we drive in my convertible chasing endless rumors of girls
Or midnight idylls in forbidden swimming pools that lapped in affluent backyards, 
Air conditioners humming like the breath of their sleeping owners? 

Why did I hate the Marquees who appeared to have real girls and newer cars
And to strut, not walk, in the eternal parade through our daytime high school halls? 

Why did the world wait to come alive until it had drowned in Night
And only our headlights could show us the way? 

Why did I feel my blood beating, suddenly, an 
inclusive rhythm  
The night that gang of paroled convicts who called themselves the 'rs' 
Came out of hell with chains to beat people up, and a guy 
From our football team whose name I can’t remember now 
Screamed "Lemme at ‘em! " and dove into their open car window, 

Or the night—this was before we were even old enough to drive—
When muscular, blonde Huns, no more than  but looking huge to us, 
Came screaming out of nowhere as we talked and strolled 
Through Heman Park at AM, chasing us as we ran for our lives
A block beyond the other side of the park, all the way up 
To Stanley’s front porch, where we woke his dad, 

Or in those forbidden, backyard swimming pools when a light went on in the house and we had to flee, 
And someone always did a last cannonball to roil the water? 

What combination of deadened lives and genuine yearnings
Twisted around one another to open those gates of Night,  
And where can I find such unlimited pastures today


She hungers again.
Her eyes, dim, red
With the lust for blood.
She controls within her a power
Even her father, 
In his thousand years
Of experience, 
Never knew.
She has within her yet
Life, 
Like none of her new brethren.

They are dead, 
Entirely.
She is not dead, 
She is dry, 
And she is mad.
Insanity clings to her like a garment, 
And it drives her to blood. 

He, her father, can sense her awake.
Now, too, he can sense her life. 
He knows his method, 
Impeccable, 
Honed by a millenia, waking dead. 
Yet she lives, 
Impossibly-
Her heart is still, 
With no blood to make flow, 
But her spirit is aflame.

Suddenly, he fears again.
She has great power, in life.
He is driven, now, by something other than hunger.
Now a new desire enters him.
Knowing this power, 
But not its origin, 
He lusts.


A cry in the night- inhuman, 
Dead.
She hears it, and heeds it-
The call of her father. 

A rendezvous of darkness-
Two creatures, existing, not living, 
Meet.
Dark words spoken by dead minds.
His voice, shrill, hoarse
-Unused.-
She hears, understands
-Rare ability, in one so young.-
Answers.


They speak of darkness, 
Pain, 
Ecstasy, 
Blood.
She is new, 
And her thoughts are ever driven 
Back to the hunger of the dead.

She is mad, 
Insane-
Such comes, he realizes, 
From the power within her. 
She knows, fully, what she is, 
With a trace of remembering
What she once was.

His fear is dispelled: 
She cannot know
Her own potential.
His daughter, 
Innocent, 
Mortal yet immortal.
Human somehow in more than shape.
His fear-
That she might displace him
With her incredible might-
Disappears: 
She is still a child, 
In her new being. 


A cry, shrill, in the night: 
It is the parting cry, then echoed.
Two creatures of the night, 
Separated. 


going to meet her grandpa. The insane traffic
last night, some kind of Puerto Rican parade, 

Today sunny and quiet, the regular rhythm of the New York streets, 
bagel and pizza shops, pedestrians, trees, subway entrances, and delis (the ones with those paper coffee cups that show a Roman discus-thrower) .

Parking, we walk up the stairs in an ordinary brown, brick building. 
An old thin man with glasses sits in an easy chair, 
a devout Catholic, Cindy’s told me. An hour we sit
and talk of practically nothing, the Yankees and St. Francis, 
how he worked in the shipyards, went to church all his life.
A Presence slowly grows, beyond what’s said.


Walking to the car I turn, look back. 
A tree sheds red and golden leaves. 
Traffic noises disappear in a silence
that swallows up their worldly sound.

The brown, brick building isn’t ordinary now. 
A kind of halo suffuses it, 
body of the silence, 
lending more beauty to the red and gold 
than even autumn leaves should have.

On a busy New York street, time stops
in homage to the saintly man up there. 
Is there an angel ladder here, that I can’t see, 
or just his prayers, kind thoughts and deeds 
raining peace and beauty, as from a living shrine


A stirring.
-Midnight-
The poppies cling to life
On two fresh graves. 
An old man, 
A young man.
Weak, 
Strong, 
Both changed.

The ground moves, 
The fresh graves shift. 
Dark, moist dirt
Hands reach through, 
Clawing the air, 
Grasping for the freedom
Of the waking dead.

Two figures, pale in the moonlight, 
-Pale in any light.-
Stand. They sense each other, 
Cold without blood.
They also sense 
The approach of a dozen others, 
Like them, yet older.
-Older in existence, for 
What they are now
Knows no age.

A shrill cry echoes
In the still air of the graveyard.
Tombstones, 
Seemingly solid images
Of the past, 
Quiver at the sound.
There are no words in the cry, 
For none of these understand, 
Yet there is meaning.
The two figures shift.
They need no words: 
They are driven now
By that unholy appetite; 
Human blood. 


To, hold shameful, desperate thoughts.
Certainly not that of a well mind for sure.
It is you, thinking of closing that final door, 
a selfish thought indeed.

Is it really you, who thinks of this, 
or is it Satan’s malicious twist.
Not wanting you, to think clean and pure, 
he comes sneaking through your door.

Your thoughts he penetrates, night after night.
Allowing you not to put up a good fight.
Thrusting backwards, falling down, 
reaching upwards to find that great crown.

Help is what you require, if you want to succeed.
Strength, oh yes, you must find the need.
You’re falling faster and faster, no one knows, 
until you finally reach disaster.

Family and friends pray for you everyday, 
this is the reason you’re able to stay.
You hear the voices now and then, 
the soft whispers of  your true friends.

Stay you must and stay you will, 
your presence here is needed still.
turn away from Satan’s grasp, 
and find a way to close the clasp.


how sorrowful life can be.

I live my life as I see fit, 
for I dwell in a bottomless pit.

Pitiful, pitiful, pity me, 
I have no money to eat you see.

I’m homeless  live on the street.
In back alleys under bridges old car seats.

Pitiful, pitiful, pity me, 
I have a face you can’t see.

I’m weathered, torn, 
wish I’d never been born.

Pitiful, pitiful, pity me
alas the darkness hovers over me.

My time has come  I’ll soon be free.
No more pity, no more pity,  for me.



The man lies in his armchair, 
Ignorant.
Asleep, two dozen beer cans
Scattered about him 
Like the spent bullet casings
From a suicidal's gun.

Before him, the television drones on, 
As ignorant as the man himself.
The news-
A suspected serial killing. 
Mysterious marks on victims' necks. 
Bodies drained of blood. 
No leads.

The man sleeping 
Sees none of this.
He sleeps on, unaware
Of the terror on his television.

He would not believe if he knew, 
So it does not matter.
For warning has no value
If it is not taken seriously.

Elsewhere, 
A mother lays her children in bed.
-Two children, their youthful innocence
Radiating from their faces.-
She is unaware
Of the eternity that would steal her childrens'
Lives.

The darkness hides itself well.
The Changed, 
Always near, 
Danger and death personified.

Only one knows, and believes.
He alone can hold back the shadow.
But he is alone, 
And thus in darkness.

Terror grips his soul, 
As it would the souls 
Of all, if they knew
And believed. 



I am more than An Indian, A Hindu, 
A Tamil, A Brahmin, A Man.
I dislike these Identities

Divisions, many times, breed conflicts
India, Pakistan; China, Tibet
Rich, Poor; Hindu, Muslim

I am more than a Human Being
I am Eternal Being in Human Form
For me all are  just Equal; 
For Truth is common to all

Dear Friend, Understand this Truth
Never Brand yourself to any Big Identity
Never belong to any Fanatic Group
A Group (Herd)  is less sensible than an Individual

Think - All are just Drops of same Ocean
You, I  and All are one and the same; 
But Be Practical;  Who else will make a 
Cup of Coffee for You - Except  your Dear and Near? 



Who sets Yardsticks for Right and Wrong? 
Right and Wrong are Subjective 
When Perception Differs
Right becomes Wrong and 
Wrong Becomes Right

Nothing is Absolutely Right or Wrong
Time, Race, Religion, Zone, make 
All the Difference to set Right and Wrong
Historically Right and Wrong interchanged 
Once SATI was Right, Now Absurd
Child Marriages, Widow Marriages also

Women should not study once, but now
Entry to Temples was a similar case
Socrates was killed for Questioning, 
A basic fundamental right now
Galileo and Bruno lost lives similarly
Osama Kills - Wrong, Obama Kills - Right? 

Maturity Level makes all difference
To interpret Right and Wrong
Mind is Imperfect Judge and unreliable Ally
Judgments by Mind are subject to revision
Don't Believe your mind to judge Right and Wrong
Built of Ignorance, Mind may be prone to Err


Ha! Ha! Is there no Right and Wrong? 
Can we do anything at our Will? 
Call Right and Wrong as we wish
And Escape the clutches of judgment? 
Wait! There is Right and Wrong! 

Soul or Psyche is one's Highest Faculty
Psyche develops as one grows and matures
Psyche is a Ray from the Divine
Whatever your Psyche says is Final
As far as Right and Wrong, But still, 
Universally Nothing is Right or Wrong, Be Aware.

You get anger at me, I smile
You loose patience, I become silent
You become violent, I become tender
You shout at me, I  become affectionate

You hate me, I express friendliness
You become furious, I embrace you
You throw brickbats, I accept you
You don't understand me, I pity you


I am more than your Dad
Once I was also like you
I love you unconditionally

I may have to live amidst corruption

I am not a Lawyer, For
I may have to live among  Liers

I am not an Astrologer, For
I may have to Bluff

I am not in Military, For

The very reason it errs prove
Mind varies in Degree
From one to another
As per one's Maturity and Evolution

Mind has 'I' s
Instinctive Mind
Intellectual Mind
Intuitive Mind
Growing Step by Step

Instinctive Mind is Repetitive
Like Bees Building Nest, Ants Storing Food
Humans derived this from Animals
Anger, Vengeance, Jealousy, Drugs
Alcohol and All addictions are my traits
I am just  Evolved, Mind is my Boss! 

Intellectual Mind is Reasoning
I out grow my Instinctive Patterns
I am no more an Animal
I analyze my deeds in depth
I abide my Intellect, Overcome my shortfalls 
I am just  Evolved, Mind becomes my Friend and Foe! 

Intuitive Mind is my Apex Mind
I don't Reason, for I know
My Highest Faculty is Intuition
I overcome my Instincts and Intellect
My Intuition comes from Unknown Depths of Me
I am  Evolved, Mind becomes my Friend! 

Am I Fully Evolved with my Intuitive Mind? 
I still my Mind, I still my Thoughts
I realize who I am, I know what is What
I laugh at my past Ignorance
I know I can't spare my Mind, For
A Minimum EGO is essential to identify ME.
I am  Evolved; Mind is my Servant! 


Dear Friend, Know this Truth! 
Not all Humans have Fully Grown Mind
Some are Grownup to Instinctive
Some to Intellective, Some to Intuitive
Very Few are Fully Evolved
Understand this and Tread your Life! 


I heavily drink Spirit-uality
Yet, I am a teetotaler

You made me love the teachings of Tagore.
My thoughts were mesmerized by your sitar.
I kept the little flowers from India, 
Artfully pressed to span a century.

Creative journeys never really end.
Our era is a lamp that still burns on.
I send some thoughts like flowers overseas
Their fragrance will outlast both you and me.

Your world class mind inspires me every day
To build a friendship bridge from West to East.
By touching souls with others, I touch yours.
The wonder of that sets two worlds alight.




saps the spirit with its
nagging and chilling 
emptiness, a black hole
that sucks out the 
shimmering warm sun  
to throw shadows and
ice over the hazy lanes of
imagination

a broken empty house
on the height echoes
relentless gloom and tales of woe
through each of its missing
chilling window panes
missing pages of a horror 
story  that solicit entries 
from the haunted mind 
of an innocent who has 
lost his way in the dark of night

the overgrown grass 
strays haphazardly and 
almost in a haste to doors, 
windows, walls and collapsing
roof  to  claim its static prey

they wake up a body of 
monks (ghost bumps)          
with their reverberating 
aum aum chants that
have the negative effects 
of sending  shivers down one's spine 

a torn and soiled jacket  strewn
across the menacing garden 
a little baby's drum, holed and beaten 
out of shape by the unkind weather 
carry with them broken dreams


an empty house wears itself out
sooner than an occupied house
a world shunning loner, who eventually
descends into despair, a wretched
soul losing all its charm and lovethe dinosaurs
did they know
their size forbode
a great task 
at hand, that 
they would 
one day drive 
the world? 

human beings
do they know 
their great mind

task at hand, 
that one day 
their spirituality

it stays on my top snugly seated
in a white boney case, hooked onto two
powerful lenses, a pair of sonar and smell detectors
and a bonus taste pad latched onto it
not to mention the central control that
takes messages from all in order to manoevre
the physique in the right direction
but the being that daily whispers? 
converses? tiptoes over the corridors
of a hodgepode of mysterious terrains
which triggers fear as well as at times
the ironical blessed dose of courage, 
in the chamber of the heart, causing machinery
to crash? is he a harmful virus we are still
learning to clear, or is he the master of a game
on a multi dimensional computer
he so cleverly designed leaving us
in the dark of our own whereabouts? 
a new generation computer that works
on a programme fueled by natureafter basho's frog haiku
the garden pond 
speaks more volume


after basho's frog haiku
each sight of the amphibian
the echo of  a splash

after basho's frog haiku
every splash at the pond 
eddies to the centre of my heart


Words will no longer come from you to me, 
Handwritten from a land of minarets.
The imagery still lights my afterthoughts, 
I wish you a long sunset, poet friend.

How strange the loss of letters matters when
We never met in ordinary life.
And yet, 'As always' is my signature.
I hope warmth travels safely without stamps.

My eyes look through the old panes of the soul, 
Remembering work of threadbare elegance.
Perhaps such verses will survive your west, 
Invoking dawn against a distant glass. 



 
Am being burned! 
Am being pulverized! 
Am being pierced! 
No acquittance
No way to run away
Am being killed 

Love killing me to be a PERFECT LOVER! 
Love killing me to transform 'dust into pure gold'.

Love successfully have captured me
Love kissing me to die
Love embracing me to fly
Love hugging me to say good-bye!


Yeah, My friend 
I know
Love killed out thou! 
What are you doing now? 
Are you looking at this world-
'as infants look upon the breast of their mother'? (Khalil said)   

Listen, my beloved, 
I see thy all over, always.
Was peering into thy heart all along.


Our lips thirsty
Seeking coupling.
What can I do dear! 
I am ordered-
'Seek thirsty, do not seek water.' (Rumi said)   

If thy give a cup of venom
I will drink with joy! 
And my final words would be-
Let me die
hiding face my 
into bosom thy! 

Oh! Am being burned! 
No way to run away
It's only thy and HE concerned! 
Am being killed by Love! 


Yes, Me too, will say, as khalil emitted-
'Good-bye my beloved; I must leave
before the heartening moon vanishes'! 

Loving thy I will die- 
this is the truth.
May our love evolve in ‘devine romance’! 

Kill, kill me kill
Drill, drill my heart by love thou
I would be a PERFECT LOVER to know! 

Love killing me to transform 'dust into pure gold'.



Words paint a fragile picture of the dusk.
I think them to a poet far away.
The light shines dim upon my windowpane.
A few tears fall like blue rain in the mind.

Our time has been short listed by sunset, 
No matter that the weather has its way, 
The stresses live within their measurement, 
And distance is a gift we give ourselves.

This moment is designed to be as spare
And elegant as winter's old, gnarled trees.
I trust you to translate my whispers, Friend
And send them back before the music ends. 

Green leaves tap at my window like lost souls.
I trace their signatures upon the glass.
Dawn is only a few quatrains away.
I memorize the fragrance of spring rain.

It takes me back beyond Eden, my friends
Where Adam brushed the first tear from Eve's eye.
Stripped of their innocence, how could they know? 


Somewhere deep in the hills, a lyric bird
Sings of the poignancy of humanness.
The ever freshness of that ancient sound
Brings back the sun that shone aeons ago.

Full of passion, emotions, needs, 
Fill the womb with new hopes
The maternal affection Adrenal supports.


Few months’ delight, alas! is left behind
When Devil with Technology the treaty signed, 
The Doctor Chemist plenty earn
When the female fetus is discerned.

All abortive tools combine
And life saving drugs their duties resign, 
The last journey to Heaven is neared, 
When the little angel’s body severed.

Mother’s dismal tears plead to be gentle
Atrocious qualms turn her mental, 
Motherhood, natal cares, in stupor lie   
Cannot bid her baby last goodbye.


It’s a dead society where corpses demand
Hatred, Illiteracy, and Greed command, 
Come out of this trance and learn to live
It’s an Almighty’s world, not a Man’s bid.

Mothers of the world, please unite
Kill the Devil promoting Feticide, 
Courage your guts, swallow your strife
Bless your charming DAUGHTERS, a beautiful life.

I think you frail blue windows of my thoughts, 
Each pane a poem intricately wrought.
Via my faith, they reach your distant sill.
The music of two souls is never still.

In tune we sing together of twilight, 
The quatrains are universally bright.
Warmth is immeasurable from shore to shore.
Imagination, Friend, can do no more.



What’s a challenge; does accepting it make you weak or strong? 
Will it be easy or might you have need, to put your seat belt on? 
An arduous journey produces strength and promotes discipline, 
Always remember, that belief in yourself is the only way, begin.

What’s only as strong as it’s weakest link of course it’s a chain, 
If you’re the only sturdy point in the group why do you remain? 
What is the use of pushing through to status quo or the same? 
A main reason success or failure is associated with your name.

You have identified the problem and you have the tools to repair, 
An even bigger problem is you are afraid to get up and go there, 
Before Goliath, David first killed a lion and a bear tending sheep, 
This future King of Israel did not flee, groan, complain nor weep. 

I know how I feel however I also know what the bible says I am, 
Challenge becomes a challenge only when the chain is stretched, 
Where there is no other way for the weakest link to pass the test.

Who wants the success of their future or final outcome to depend? 
On someone who has no intention or chance of surviving to the end, 
Victory does not always go to the swiftest, the tortoise vs. the hare? 
It’s not how fast you move but how safely you get from here to there.

A challenge is not a challenge loosing playing volleyball on the beach, 
A challenge is a challenge when your aspirations have suffered defeat, 
Because, there’s only one way to experience failure and that is to quit, 
It’s one thing to be replaced by a better one but not if you choose to sit.

Okay! What’s the best thing to ever happen to the American made car? 
It’s the success of foreign made automobiles produced from lands afar, 
General Motors, Ford & Lincoln are producing high quality vehicles too, 
However, they did not do it by sitting back to relax, neither should you.

Is there a proven best or right way to prepare before the journey begins? 
Surround yourself with others sharing the same goal they are your friends, 
Just like you, these individuals are seeking to achieve above and beyond, 
Whales and sharks will only be found in the ocean not the backyard pond.

There is not a Standard Operating Procedure, SOP, yet there are rules, 
Not those acquired from the streets, those taught and learned in school, 
Realize you have already failed the challenge if your only way is to cheat, 
And sooner or later guidelines will be posted then how will you compete? 

You can’t look at the challenge through rose-colored glasses & accept, 
To turn around and give-up because your pride is hurt from the neglect, 

The road to victory is by no means short and sweet it is bitter and long, 
Understanding if it were easy then everybody would be big and strong, 
Question, is it possible to tell good from bad certainly since it will stink, 
So, on the pathway of life you are either, "Challenge Or Weak Link."



at the clothesline 
is hung the fun 
of the whole family

when heaven
affords a blessing -
a breeze -
the clothesline
leads the way
for the whole family 
to strut, boggie

sister's lace shawl
goes up in a straight line
turns hand of wind
flutters up, down
a choreographer 
pointing out
the way to swing 
with hands, legs 
and enviable physique

brother's new jeans
well, like him refuses to 
go unnoticed

though pegged - 
as is mom controlled -
left, right, right, left
the leggy pant turns
one leg ultimately gets 
stucked to the line

if only they have 
taken off the tack
it (the pant)   would have 
flown right next door, into 
the heart of his fancied girl

dad's tie does a non stop 
flight, like his inspired mind
never at a moment, stops working

mom's long skirt, it swings 
in the most gracious fashion
as if it owns the whole field

and the bras, wow, 
do they look obscene? 
not at all, innocently, they fly
a ballet dancer's frilly skirt twirls

granny too joins 
in the fiesta of colours, 
shape and style
her blouse with 
its heavy pads
maintains an edge like her
firm, strong and 
unperturbed  by the 
thermal circus going round her






I was picking flowers and you were praising smoke.
The echoes of that last time linger on.
Birds pieced from the gray quilt of the dusk
Sang mighty wholeness that is ever lost.

I held your face like summer in my hands.
The warmth was various, a rare suncut.
Wind played your tune through simple blades of grass.
You never heard it, but I hear it still.

Muse India


Blood swarming a cold heart 
Love far deeper than Starsky & Hutch
My love shall never bleed through the pavement or rust 
For it is far deeper than the feeling when we touch
My love is as strong as a thunder god 
As well as the anti-god 
They always clashing for it all-my soul
My love resides on the other side of the picket fence 
My heart currently relies on the hate my love one commenced 
I am on the side where hate lies 
A place where even a soldier cries 
This story takes place where hearts descend when they fly 
Story will be dark unbelievable and might be gory  
There won’t be a hidden message of triumph or glory
Only how my love turned to hate 
And how my hate came to know me 

I came home early from work
Called every time a female co worker flirted
She winked at me she wanted lovely lust
But I rather think about my wife 
Salvaging and protecting my love is a must
Came to the door knocked three times
Made a beautiful poem tried my best to rhyme
My friends make fun saying I worship my wife love 
Is loving your wife with a passion a crime? 
I guess so the door opened when the wind flow hit it
Smelled a scent known to man as bodies penetrating ripping it 
Slid upstairs bedroom room door was slightly open shocked what I saw 
My wife sexing up a man jesus juice flying betraying my love so raw
Wanted to scream but my lungs were swollen
Wanted to cry but my eyes got numb that they began to burn
Far worse than watching bills pile or money folding
Wanted to burn her and place her in an urn 
But couldn’t my love didn’t know how to turn

My love is firm but felt like I was in a drama movie in a fiasco
How was I suppose to react though I came in and shoved the man 
Got into an altercation wanted his entire face to plummet from the earth
And wish I could shove the man back inside his mothers womb back to birth
After finishing off a foe I never knew I look at my wife eying her down like a hawk 
My fist was now as powerful as a rock my love disappeared and all I saw was a mop 
Walked out not saying a word heard her berate me 
Didn’t faze me, because she didn’t make me or raised me I was a man she was a girl 
All I can do is get the divorce papers signed and sob
Lay in my house love dying and hatred all into a twirl, I was truly robbed


Love so sweet of summer gone to yesterday, 
The passion of air in the deep fragrance; 
Sorrow and rage not there to give or say, 
Only the true heart that forever abundance! 
Quickly over each the tender fires are, 
Pointed the way to the love in your soul; 
Daybreak in the morning or some cloud afar, 
All which is love you can't reach or have control.
Because the day again goes to dark night, 
And everything gives something that's of worth; 
Declare itself through thorns and heart full of insight, 
Slashing around its love from seed to birth.
Conquer each truth from the feelings that hide, 
The routs and the maps come through the inside. 

a singing man
was sacrificed

by ravens
of night dreams

my silky soft desire
is lying

and denied a wish


The night retreats
from the welcoming day

of green grass
and brown soft earth

duel of dark and light


Muted wind
shaping things

and saying goodbye
to the road
I walked

presence dreams be soft


Along the rivers
sentinels with fires

the neon of night
in reflected banks
of expectant past

the song of vision


Earth’s blue
the gift of life

a light of day

and gray dark sky
of surrounding clouds


I see your face in reflection, 
It is to me a distraction.
The past is gone away, 
No matter what I say.
But still I wish for direction
And hope again for affection.
These cloudy moods each day, 
Hold me and make me stray. 

Burning desires for you I feel
And in my dreams you are still real.
Then I wake again and find, 
Our time is long behind. 

Those words, life in peace, 
A compass in the storm, 
Light for closed eyes.
Tic, tac. 
An old poet is speaking
And his harmony offers hope
And you feel like 
Taking a look again
Without clouds, 
Without winds, 
One more chance
Before making the decissionm

One sex, one race, 
one religion, one face.
One thought, one nation, 
one dream, one altercation—
One is easy.

But gender, 
belief, and ethnicity, 
patriots and pariahs, authenticity, 
need not tender
strife and bewilderment.

Two sexes and all between, 
a spectrum of creeds, 
not one, maybe fourteen, 
and dreams innumerable, 
left balancing right, 
one is not enough
for any human heart.

One is easy
but one is not enough. 

The Wise Men will unlearn your name.
Above your head no star will flame.
One weary sound will be the same—
the hoarse roar of the gale.
The shadows fall from your tired eyes
as your lone bedside candle dies,
for here the calendar breeds nights
till stores of candles fail.

What prompts this melancholy key?
A long familiar melody.
It sounds again. So let it be.
Let it sound from this night.
Let it sound in my hour of  death—
as gratefulness of eyes and lips
for that which sometimes makes us lift
our gaze to the far sky.

You glare in silence at the wall.
Your stocking gapes: no gifts at all.
It's clear that you are now too old
to trust in good Saint Nick;
that it's too late for miracles.
—But suddenly, lifting your eyes
to heaven's light, you realize:
your life is a sheer gift. 

At the back of her mind.  

was a man.
Somewhere in the roads she walked before.
Those dark roads of her life-
she paused and turned back.
There was no one there. 
darkness covered the path.
Is his shadows hiding over the face of the night? 
Or perhaps he was gone as was the light; 
I wonder.  

how she must have felt
that the man she lived for
is now a memory she doesn't want to remember.
Had she wept? I know not.
Perhaps.  or perhaps not.
For when I saw her stepping out of darkness, 
I saw the smile in her eyes.
thinking she will never walk those roads again.
I looked away from her brown eyes and said to myself: 
I'll never walk those roads again. 
The darkness is past, the true light now shineth
and the past is gone.
At the back of my mind there is this MAN -
and I know Him.
I'll walk the roads He walked
for I know in them I'll find my way back home.



I've got a mom, 
So incredible, 
So kind, 
You wouldn't believe that she is mine.

She has worked two jobs, 
To send me to school, 
I love her so much, 
She is so cool.

She has taught me to love, 
She has shown me a dove, 
This lady my mom, 
Is all good above.

Mrs. Mom, 
Please come to the stand, 
Present your case, 
Please hold my hand.

She is always there, 
Right by my side, 
So when my baby comes, 
I won't need to hide. 

A mini skirt, sweet wine and a bad disposition
We'll lose our hearts above the city streets
In an instant that lasts forever in a measureless addition
Cigarettes, you and my fatal devotion
In a reality where triumphs again turn into dreams


I thought 
the gate to life I´d  found, 
my treasure and my heart. 

I´d  lost the load of pride
but the maid sleeps, 
and swine eat pearls. 

The past 's sunken eyes
hold the fortress against
a bright tomorrow
as the decible levels arise. 

The coals struggle to vainly climb 
when gray ashes are a destiny.
Sozzled walls sway,  where  
the pulses grow on beaten time.  

The night sky framed, return
on the window panes, won't stay.
The stars shall sink into the 
spirited sea, one by one

Sparkling eyes await to arrest soon
 the new sun  tomorrow. Hopes shall 
renew as spirits soar and curtains 
prepare to fall on a pale moon.

Resolves of past, like coals
of yesterday give in to ashes.
Tomorrow  belongs to the wind
it shall  light the fire again that plays.

h december he old well is
an old woman, 
dispirited, hunched, 
aggrieved

a dark realm
reigns over here
ever ready to throw
its vengeance
on unsuspectful
strangers

only the heaven has
the generosity
to give it grace 
- the rain fills it up
and when the weather is fine
the sky plays with it
a gentle childful
game of master sun, 
and angel stars

nobody ever
greets the old well
a good morning
afternoon or
evening

all they do
is ungratefully
bend over and
in a callous manner
start robbing it of its
luminuous peace
and tranquility
- an unkind bucket
that goes splash
before riding the
blessed sanctum
for its vitality yesterday, today, 
tomorrow, everyday -
always in such a hurry
the water slushes, 
sloshes, splasHomes
to play out its grouses

the old well
is an aggrieved woman
overused and
worn out with hatred
a restless soul
filled to the brim
with vengeance
and chagrin

to pass by one at night
one would be lucky
if one's heart does not
stumble and race
faster than one's feet
for the well's ominuous mouth 
with all its sober
and solemnness 
will draw your spirit in
with its damp, dark
and cold tales
and selfishly hold it there 
with the tenuous
grip of a viper for
a thousand years


How are you? sun winks on the east
light stems slowly over the crowd
mist lays heartful tunes yet unheard 
where are you? night rifles faster
breeze refuges to transmute shadow

bird scarcely chirrups in dark night
wind seems still as dead stone
rose never whispers to sorrow
yet speckle of its desire intones blue
huge walls of chilled snow fluffs together

she stands  hidden across the wall
half muffled by the motley silhouette
breath seems to be wordless to the eyes
the silence resounds in the court room

dregs of love yet not lost to tunes past
last autumn still remembers its nights
earth meets eclipses  across its own axis 
moments seems to ponder onto apocalypse
I may not meet you to hear story apocryphal


Rain clouds over me, 
Autumn sky frighteningly
- So rough-and-ready

the indian woman is 
a tormented soul
weeping secret tears
ink that writes lines 
of anguish all over 
her countenance

her large, sharp and slit eyes 
pour longingly into the
the jasmine she strings 
everyday for hours 
in india street

pure, white, dainty
a softness and scent
that two days from now
will be nothing more than
a dehydrated mess
a mere sore to the eyes

a transience fills the gap 
between the flowers
a string of luxury that helps
her to keep a sister close 
to her hands, her heart

first jasmine, a sister's
smile, second jasmine, 
a sister's promises, 
third jasmine, another
sister's  smile, fourth
jasmine. .. 

every gap she feels 
a loss, a love her fingers will no 
more grasp and a sister 
her eyes will no more holdthe land talks through 
you, every line on you 
resonates with its vibrations 

you are the poetry of the 
land, mouth through which 
the land conveys its senses

the sun talks through 
your eyes, they channel
its spirit through to me
a radiant warmth the 
ounce of love that rises 
in a primordial pool  to 
surge  through my heart 

the moon touches me
the way your lingering 
mood and nonchalance
speak volume of the other
side of your cheerful self

a luminousness that
skirts and corners night
to let shadow rest in shadow
and words echo in words
a tide bound in only by the 
starry promises of  nightpoor snake 
life is equal so god says
but look at the snake
look at the snake..
it cant even walk
but slithers and always
at the lowest of place

and everywhere
the message is 
it's evil, culprit  of the Great Fall

everything the snake
lowly humbly takes
cane, blows and all

you can swing it, you can stretch it
you can bend it in any angle
because it's just a snake

there is a snake too
barely two inches long
yet it's the most pliable of them all
and that's the real one
where the first divine 
curse should go

guarded all round
in a red glowing ruby palace
and gleaming pillars of enamel
the cunning and sly creature 
in all smugness and warmth
could never get enough of the world
sweet, sour, bitter, salty, hot or cold

it could make satan of god 
and god of satan and turn
the world upside down
without even having to leave home
 Let Your grace be a fountain
Allow Your truth fill unsaved ears
There to abide eternal years

Without Your love, I was alone
Within I had a heart of stone
For death I used to yearn each day
 For no-one came to show the way

I failed to love the way I should
Be on my knees or sing Your praise
Yet still Your love’s set me ablaze

On love’s true wealth I now can soar
With hope and faith Your face to see

Upon the hills Your truth is heard
There being sung by beast and bird
Amongst the trees reigns beauty serene
Throughout nature Your handwork’s seen

Your depth’s awesome, I keep, keep
Wanting to submerge, falling, falling

Just how life’s pages now unfold
Without Your Marker I’d lose my place
From life’s book without a trace

Yet with Your hand held fast to mine

I think of the day
When you were all mine
It feels like a much longer time
Than one week ago today
Maybe it was my last chance but I made it
And still you're like a string that is not to be cut
Tied around my neck, but I'm not afraid yet
As long as I keep my mouth shut
Tightening every time I try to pull you closer
Can't let it slip through my hands, no way you chose her
Can never be sure of my victory
Your love is pure, you act contradictory
But I'd rather suffocate with you choking me
Than living a dead life with no reason to be


If we combined
The perfectly good and the perfectly evil, 
We would obtain the imperfection.
If we took a piece of paradise
And a piece of hell to gather them together, 
Our souls would become less beautiful, 
Because the truth would swallow the lie, and
The absolute truth would become relative.
If our love swallowed our hatred, 
We would love each other less than usual.
If we formed an amphora, 
While trying to find the absolute truths
In a new and perfect love for Him, 
We would need all our faith to remove
All the lies and all our hatred from us.
If our lies and our hatred
Became two trenchant weapons, 
And if we chose Lucifer for hitting
Our relative truths, 
They would mathematically fall to become
Downright uncertainties.
The wounded love would disappear from us, 
And we would turn into new salt stones
As Lot's wife turned while seeing Sodom burning. 
If our truth was equal with our lie, 
And our love was equal with our hate, 
We would become absolutely nil persons, 
While dying slowly and while melting ourselves
In nothingness, 
While the absolute truth and the absolute lie
Are in no touch.
The reason to save the self
And to search for the purity, 
Is that their arguments are always perfect

 a. 

m.; 
To take care of yourself in life. 

A man's princiles, 
Everyone has a secret; 

A woman's principles, 
Everyone has a story to tell; 

But, there is always something better in life, 
When the right thing is done. 

Throw away the crabs and gain your health; 
And, go to the potter and learn from him or her! 
How he or she makes images out of clay.

A way very far away! 
With the sruggles of life; 
And to know what others do not know.$a gallon? 
For what? 

'Does that really matter now? 
When it approached
One dollar per gallon. 
You should have voiced your concern then! 
Not when your pockets have gotten thin.
And deepened to hold more lint! 
You want to make cents? 
Put these sunglasses on.
Grab a twig from a bush. 
And get to begging! 
MAYBE. 
You might gain some sympathy, 
From someone who recognizes you are in disguise.
And they are in the mood, 
To share with you their good attitude.
IF they have some of 'that' left! 'Discomfort
Is a unique measurement
Of self-esteem.

When discomforted, 
one is bound to question
the reason for achieving
such an unhappy state.

By default, 
discomfort
is likely to force  positive, 
or negative corrective actions.

If of the low-self
Mindset, 
One's "Self" is ultimately assumed 
To be of negative
Proportions 
And thus unchangeable
in long term prospects.

Discomfort is seen as 
a simple fact of existence, 
and ones every day
activities, 
are tailored to embrace
it. 

However, 

If of the high-self
Mindset, 
"Self" 
is unlikely to tolerate
a situation
in which discomfort
is prolonged.
Thus, 
Forcing an acceptable
Outcome to a situation
Breeding discomfort.

Life
Is forged by actions
built from
differing
levels of self-esteem.

Just as 
A dictator is often short, 
A President is usually tall.

I’m quite sure
That all major negative
Military decisions, 
Economic catastrophes, 
Mass genocides, 
And scurrilous inventions
(such as Rap and Teletubbies)       

Could have been avoided
If 
As a child
Ones parents 
Encouraged, 
High discomfort 
And positive self-esteem.



I´ve been working on one
And I can feel it strong
in my fingers.

I´ve got the right thread, 
it´s windy, 
it´s a clear winter morning, 
and there is no class today.

I will feel your cold hands
While I teach you to let go, 
To feel the air, 
the blow, the whisper, loneliness.

And then the greyhounds will come and sit
To take a look at usbalanced melody
and rhythms
motions within bodies

configurations
of desire and love

Sculptured statues
of bronze and stone


Remember the eyes
of a confusing morning

innocent instant

walking blue reality
seeing the lilacs
blooming again


A love and hate relationship, 
Will never do for me; 
I must have more in my power chip, 
To be or not to be. 

The question is to give a try, 
The feelings that we keep inside.
The goal, is to reach the sky, 
And do what we consider right. 

If I could answer only this: 
What happened to our heart? 
I wouldn't even have to wish, 
That we could begin from start. 

Home. 

That I deserve the Heaven.
And mebbe for that reason
A 'HOME' I was given.

But then with time I know not
Who of us made mistake, 
He kept our home at stake! 

Dad went far to amke money, 
We away for studies, 
Mom was leaft alone at home
With only Sunday's memories! 

Then one fine day so bad
We had to leave our home, 
My memories of childhood, 
And the soil I'd called my own! 

People there have changed, 
And so has changed time.
My soul still rests there, 
Albiet, this new life is fine.

Often during many nightfalls, 
As I lay in my new haven, 
I think of a miracle
And go back to my heaven! 

By me, 
(finished on the h of April,The plot, 
Closer to each other than ever; 
But this first love was like hours in hell! 
And like the bombs of war, 
But i will move on with my positive mind.

Same person and of the same act, 
But in confusion with the muse of love; 
And like this complex issue at hand, 
But this first love was like hours in hell. 

Ten kittens in my home now
Ten little brats
Their mothers never knew how
To catch the cupboard rats! 
Their mothers never knew how
To go for hunt and prey
How the kittens would learn now
Anything other than play! 
Their mothers never knew how
To pounce on a mouse
The poor kittens are all now
Just idling in my house! 
Their mothers never knew how
To make their own food
Why still the lazy kittens now
Making me feel so good?Km from the Airport, 
On the outskirts of Ghana's capital City, Accra, to meet your muse; 
But, what you sow is what you reap in this life! ! 
And like the words of your parents now leading you on  to the right path, 
But i will always find a way to satisfy you with my love. 

I've got Million Euro in the Bank! ! ! 
And, the dogs are chasing after me; 
But, where are the gods to answer them? ! 
For, the stars are like rats around me.moons, 
months, 
with hearts, 
pulsing in my body. 
You try to teach me now
love, tolerance, compassion. 
My Darling, maybe it`s just time 
to repeat my most exciting, 
moons,months long, 
thorough body-
language 
lesson? . plus equals to, 
in base  
Going along with your life and, 
Knowing where you came from.steps to heaven are like the 'Commandments'! 
But look around and see the truth; 
Are we really keeping the laws? ! ! 
Then, we need to rethink to follow these steps. 

Today is weeks agao and, 
I am still waiting for her call; 
For, she left me without a note! 
It is just like when a boy loves a girl, 
In the land of beautiful roses.

weeks ago, 
And, i am still waiting for her letter; 
And, it is just like when a girl loves a boy! 
In the land of beautiful roses, 
With true love, mercy and concern.

weeks agao! 
Like the muse of the king and the prince
Living in the garden of love; 
But, nature had now left me alone in the bush, 
With the sun shining on me alone.

Love, 
With the muse of an echo heard from afar! 
But, she left me without a note; 
Life, 
The rain will surely fall one day! ! 
To quench my thirst in the forest.

'Go'! ! 
My son, 
For your own safety; 
And, from her own words i left! 
To the other side of the river, 
However, she died years after! ! ! 
And, i still have her words in my mind. 

The seed planted years ago had finally germinated! 
However, to satisfy your greed with your illegal lust is not the way foward.years from now will you remember me, 
Will you hate me, 
Or date me, 
Or be late to my funeral, 
I waited to long, 
I kept on pushing you away, 
Can you see the world in my eyes, 
There is sadness between us, 
I need something to tell me that you’ll be happy once more or I should be happy once more, 
I never did try or you never try to get to know me, 
There is forces cures in each world we are in, 
We are so alone but different yet the same person we are, 
years from now, 
Will you know the truth about how I feel about you before its too late, 
I lurk in the darkness, 
Losing my path, 
You need to face what you become towards me, 
I need to face what I have become towards you, 
We are different and I know that, 
But years from now will you marry me or still hate me.years of sickness! 
Destroying your life with unclean food; 
Living in the land of sin. 

I need it from you, 
So give it to me! 
And like days of love in the land of your muse; 
But, when will you allow me in? 

Yazoo River, 
In the land of my muse and with the mind of peace; 
But where is the beginning and the end of this river? 
Because, crossing over this river is my dearest dream! 
And like days of love in the land of your muse. 

I broke into the bank on Sunday,
You should see the money I got.
I couldn't drag it home 'til Monday,
'Cause it sure weighed an awful lot.

Then I sat down to count it,
And much to my surprise,
A whole lotta little brown, little round coins,
Rolled out before my eyes

Chorus:
I've got a hundred thousand dollars worth of pennies,
Not a solitary dollar or a dime,
And I don't believe there's many,
Rich men with a problem like mine.

And I don't think this is any
Kind of ending to a perfect crime.
I've got a hundred thousand dollars worth of pennies,
And I'm spendin' it a penny at a time!

Now a steak sure would taste delicious,
And I've forgot how a beer would feel,
But the man just might get suspicious,
If I gave him eight hundred pennies for a meal.

So I guess I'll just weigh myself again, 
And buy me another stick of gum, 
And I'm livin' like a penniless bum!

Chorus:
I've got a hundred thousand dollars worth of pennies,
Not a solitary dollar or a dime,
And I don't believe there's many,
Rich men with a problem like mine.

He stayed up half the night
collecting one hundred fireflies in a mason jar.
Just before midnight he unscrewed the lid
and released them inside the screen porch.
Next door a man leaps high and says to his wife: 
Oh! Magic

I am walking as if in the air! 
Because of traps set down before me; 
And i have to watch every step that i take.
Life is not easy at times, 
But it needs somebody with a strong heart and a dream to carry on! 
Because kindness can be very deceitful and beauty can be vain at times.

But my mind is still stronger than the woods! ! 
For i do have my faith and dreams to carry on; 
And my steps are now being taken with care.metres deep under the earth, 
Looking for diamonds to satisfy my lover; 
For this hard job had really thought me many lessons, 
But i will always do my best for my lover.percent satisfaction of my love! 
And in the land of nowhere when many are too blind to see; 
But she fell in love with him.

White shoes, white bag and white belt; 
percent satisfaction of my love in the muse of your love, 
And she fell in love with him. 

All dressed up and no where to go.
would love to see a picture show.
Who cares! 
Who wants me? 
I’m old, cracked and crusted you see.
The years have taken their toile on me.
I no longer have smooth beautiful skin, 
instead, I’m wrinkled saggy, with a sloppy chin.
My boobs that stood pert and showy for all to see, 
now hang to my knees, flat as can be.
What say you, when you look at me, 
awkward question my dear, 
Hmmm afraid to tell me.
Don’t be afraid, my body speaks for itself.
You can roll me up and place me on a shelf.


Don’t worry fellow poets, I’m just in a mood.  It’s
Friday night and I ain’t got nobody.  Hmmm I think
someone made a song, oh yeah it was on Saturday
night wasn’t it.  Well no matter, this is Friday for
another hour or so.  This is not a true story by the
way.  I look great, just in a weird mood is all.  I’m
not even drinking, darn I don’t drink. LOLOLOL
I’ll delet this another day.  Tonight if you dare to
read this, OH well----LOLOL


ed parrots are black widows in disguise.  "Did you watch that dream last night? "  Nelly did, she said I should rent it myself from the ‘Eternity’ shop.  She said I had to take my id there but I had given it in for a personal storm cloud.  They sell those in the ‘Maternity’ shop.  Did I mention the dream played songs by three talented Zulus, all killed in different accidents from flat tires crossing ‘Casablanca’ streets?  I thought she was joking, but then her father with a bouquet kissed me on the shoulder, where my beloved spiders used to breed.
Charater, 
Ministers; 
Dollars and Euro! 
But your love came to me when i was out of money; 
And i underwent a tested time to prove my status, 
However i was like butterflies in the time of the cold. 

I feel each of them every day, 
And I show each of them every day.

Few I Understand and few I don't, 
Few have roots in the soul.
Few I play with and Few play with me, 
Few have no face at all

I feel each of them every day, 

I Feel Good, I Feel Bad, 
In Sorrow, Tears I've Had.
My tears can flood the Desert, 
that's the power emotions have Had.

I feel each of them every day.

I laugh with the riding waves, 
Even the hyenas feel shy, 
A smile on my face, and even the dead smile in their Graves, 
that's the power of my one emotion, 

I feel each of them every day.

In Anger I shout like hell, 
All emotions goes in shell, 
No Illusionist, can make disappear friends like this, 
That's the power I hate of emotions.

I feel each of them every day.

Hey, what happened to me? 
I don't feel 'one' of them today, where is the smile on my friends? 
I need to feel the bliss; I need to feel the pain, 
I need smiling friends to bring back my smile.

I need to feel each of them every day. 

Trees can live for hundreds of years, 
They well know to live  together! 
They tuft to earth, as child's to mom, 
Light, water, and air they do share! 
When storm  does come they low their heads, 
To show  him respect out of fear! 
The branches welcome, greet and laugh.
Leaves dance with the beat of  the air.
The roots sometimes, take hold of each, 
Thus, they make bridge, over the ditch.
What men  ignore, they  may  do care
And mend that  always, just to teach.
They whisper, and send their message, 
Thru breeze, and soil, thru ether-
If nature lives, then all can live. 
We should do that which can help her.
Hundreds, hundreds years they  can live, 
In warm friendship, fraternity.
But, we, intelligent creatures, 
Can't keep this nature's sanctity

Inside and outside, 
Inward and outward, 
Forwards and backwards! 
That which is born of the flesh is flesh; 
And, that which is born of the spirit is of the spirit! ! 
So is the muse of my lov e around you.

ways of love, 
You know where it comes from because you've heard the sound of it! 
So, it is with everyone who is born of the spirit; 
And, i am here to love you like never before! ! 

Teaching and preaching, 
Writing and reading, 
Giveing and sharing, 
But, everybody passes through ther same hole! ! 
Si is the act of the power of your love; 
And like the choicest wine in the land of your muse. 

Food and water, 
Shelter and care; 
But, stopping down low for somebody to see your nakedness! 
And, there i met your love.

ways of my lov e, 
Called to satisfy your muse! ! 
Dress, repress, mistress, stress, press, witness, pointless, wireless, politeness; 
But, to lodge there and to wait for your love! 
And like he manner of your usage, 
But i am a teacher of the message is what i am.

ways of my love, 
To be set aside; 
And to aboard the muse of your love! ! 
On the left and of the right sides of the mango tree; 
But, watch and remember the ways that we shared, 
Night and day in the land of your muse. 

I am scared of spiders
When I see one I scream
Let it be big or small
Let it be real or in my dream
I inherited this fear from mom
So I am scared of them since I was small
Now my greatest wish is that spiders
Didn’t exist at all
My sister talks about spiders
So she can scare me
That’s the first thing she talks about
When I trouble her, you see
I hate all spiders
Especially big ones
I’d rather get out of this room
Cause mom says, in here there are tons.У п а д у л и ш ћ а о д г у р н у т к о р ј е н с т о ј и

The morning undresses the trees
In the fall of leaves the root stands pushed away
And nothing will move farther than the soil
Not even those branched below
Underground wings of earth
Spasmodically keeping the currents
Not to dissolve within the grains
This is the way everything moves

No heart do I have thus she will say
It is the dark hole I deeply enjoy
Self tortured pain screaming for more
Teach me no lessons for I have none
But this mutant pain thirsty disease
No comfort for me for I will loose
A good excuse not to see the sun


Poetry in Perfection
I am waiting for the time
When everything in me would
Turn to poetry, when I breathe
Nothing but the rhythm of
Poetry, when I perspire poetry, 
When I cry poetry, when I laugh
Poetry, when I sleep in poetry, 
When everything in me is poetry, 

That would be perfect poetry. and I
Would not be
Myself anymore, I would be perfect
Poetry, 

There is no me, no soul no body, no mind, 
No name, no personality, no knowledge, 
There is just poetry, and that would
Be perfect, I would not
Be me, 

There is no such I as me, anyway, 
The wise man, so very well say, that is
The perfection
Of poetry, there is no self in there
But only perfection.

And worshiped the Idol.
Meera offered her prayers
To fulfil her wishful desires.

Rana was happy to hear
Her every simple prayer, 
But, as usual, his mother, 
Criticised Meera’s prayer.

She didn’t like Meera
Singing about Krishna, 
As they worshiped always
Durga and Shiva Deities.

They reached the palace, 
And there Meera chose
For Krishna an ideal place, 
Though small, it was nice.

Rana took more interest
And he did his best
To cheer her up thereby
Earn her love slowly.

He joined in her prayers
And also sang with her
On the glories of Krishna, 
Which really pleased Meera.

At Meera’s request, he built
A temple on a chosen spot
For Krishna she had brought.
On a good day, he installed it.

From this day, trials started.
Little her Rana suspected
That Krishna chose her
As His own bride earlier.

Her songs, so melodious, 
Her childish speech, so nice, 
Her bright face, so innocent, 
All kept him very patient.

The more good, he did for her, 
In turn, it affected his mother
And his jealous widow-sister
Who, as usual, began to murmur.

It displeased them, he knew, 
But for the sake of a few, 
He thought it not proper
To simply offend her.

Meera, on the other hand, 
Realized that he was so kind, 
That she too was soft with him
And tried to adjust with him.

Name sake couple they were, 
Not in any marital pleasures.
How far this would go like this? 
Future alone would decide this. 

Meera was in the temple, 
Along with common people, 
Who also sang with her
Closely following her.

Her every divine song, 
All the rural folks sang.
Thus these songs became
Popular in course of time.

Rana failed to bring her 
To the family life forever.
His mother felt it a disgrace
To the entire Rajputs race.

His disgruntled widow-sister
And hard hearted mother, 
Plotted against Meera then
To kill her with cobra poison.

A cup of milk with poison, 
They gave her one fine morn, 
In the temple, when she was
Alone offering her prayers.

It was poison, she knew well, 
But she drank the cup full.
And continued her prayers.
What a surprise it was! 

It didn’t act on Meera.
But the face of Krishna   
At Dwaraka turned blue
Suddenly with no clue.

As an unexpected miracle, 
The doors of the temple, 
Both got themselves shut 
And stuck up too tight.

As if nothing had happened, 
Before Krishna she remained.
Her in-laws were desperate, 
As even poison didn’t act.

Devotees from all corners
Rushed there to see her, 
And the crowd was so thick
It threw also some risk.

Spies dressed like sadhus
Studied the strategic points
Thus weakening the position
On the defensive front-line.

One day two sadhus came
And gave Meera that time
A pearl chain as a gift
Which she did accept.

To Krishna she offered it, 
The one that was a gift, 
To the war-captive Allaudin, 
When he was given a pardon. 

Rana released him gracefully, 
On an agreement mutually, 
Offering him this chain, 
Just a gift, as a token.

When the same chain
To Rana was shown, 
He got terribly wild, 
That he was being spied.

Immediately he ordered
The temple be destroyed
Which brought this crisis
To the very palace doors.

Devotees, not even a single, 
Came out of the temple.
Even the elephants sent
To break, back they all went.

No damage could be done
To the temple or anyone.
For this incapable blame, 
Too wild Rana became.

He sent cobras to bite her.
They did no damage to her.
As disgrace only she brought.
She was a witch, he thought.

Meera blamed only Krishna, 
For changing the mind of Rana, 
Who was so nice to her earlier
But now bitterly hated her.

To Julie and John

In celebration of your h wedding anniversary
We parents are happy to send our greetings 
Ten years ago you just began dating
Now looking back, it's just like yesterday.
Julie was from California, John Philadelphia
Many days, many conversations on lines
Then when you met the first time
You were sure that you were deep in love.
Because of the great distance
The more you loved, the more you missed each other
The more you missed, the more you were in love.
After John graduated,  you tied the knots
Then Julie departed California to come here
 John continued his residency training	.
Julie was happy to be a home maker
Julie also attended school to prepare for future.
California invited both of you every day
You decided to sell your house to move there.
Although you left, your hearts are still in Annville.
You sent your loves and gifts with special care
 Every year Moon cakes arrived here 
Coffee, sweets, lovely gifts found their wings over clouds.
Mother wore new clothes that you sent
People were so impressed by her beauty with these clothes.
People said she was so lovely
She humbly responded: The gifts of my children.
Even though we are so far apart between East and West 
Your hearts are so close and we are very happy.
Wish both of you always in love
And love each other like you just join your lives together.


Beware embracing with fervent desire
a romantic involvement.

It can enmesh worse than netting of steel, and curse 
flesh with fire.

Emotion consumes, dictates every movement, 
lays bare vulnerability and 
exposes raw hearts.

Life on knife-edge of sheer captivation, when started, 
can really excite.

It enlightens each thought, yet passion betokens control, 
it demands more stimultation that often 
bewilders the soul.

Chasing the dream requires taking a hold of the skirt 
of reality and flirting 
with something akin to voluntary insanity.

It can rattle sensations like a canine shaking a bone.

Vincibility bespeaks depth of personal need, it uncovers 
exposure to seeds of proneness.

Love grips so tight it cleaves to the core, yet emotion 
augments as it elevates too.

So, does this vigorous vivaciousness, this tempest 
of pure implication appeal 
dear to you

Embattled in that  mud - and blood-red poppies; 
flooded trenches holding 'them' at bay; 
life or death a coin's flippant toss-up; 
deafening shellfire near by night and day -

for us, these horrors now are others' lives, 
impossible to truly comprehend; 
yet in my own mind's state, I recognise
these battles are still raging without end: 

the mud, the clung-to life, the enemy
imagined - these, we strive still to invent.

Their thoughts, at death's door, lost to memory: 
'I love you. ' - gone, a family's content.

We owe to them to live a life of love
as if we were transfused from their own blood. 

A funny date
getting messages that say
HAPPY DAY

It's a happy day
a wonderful date
only when seen the English way
but the wonder is gone
when it's arranged American





Wholesome hearts, 
well deserved friendship, 
good chunks of truth
wrapped in cigarette smoke.

Singing together, playing our tune.
High school, low voices, 
Coughing. . Silence, please! 
A true lady is listening.

Winning together, 
playing the same game, 
to simply convince each other
we may be wrong.

Drinking from the same chalice, 
We taste the same curse: 
'Beauty, 
You bring us Truth'.

Little as we are, 
we look through the same keyhole
to sometimes have
a good finishing touch. 

I want to be the sun, 
A sun that shall never fade.
And when the night turns on
Through the stars I shall be immortal made.

I want to be the cloud, 
A cloud that shall never be perished.
And when the monsoons arrive
Through showers of rains I shall be cherished.

I want to be the jasmine, 
A jasmine that shall never wither.
And when my death angels come
Through my fragrance I shall remain hither.

I want to be true human, 
A human who shall die never.
And when my life's end comes
Through my integrity I shall live forever.

The extent of her power.
She is truly alive.
How can this be? 
I drank of her, 
Fully.
Never in a thousand years
Have I tasted
A nectar so sweet, 
So fulfilling.
She is dry, empty.
-This I know.
Yet there is something in her
I have not felt in my heart
In a thousand years.
She loves, yet.
Nemesis.

She is beautiful, 
Even in our grisly existence.
Her hair, long and dark as shadow.
Her eyes, keen, 
Though they have lost their shine.
I live now in dead flesh, 
No emotion-
But I want her. 

I have tasted her, 
I know her, 
Having drank her life.
Now I want her.

I call her, 
My voice casting fear into the hearts
Of the living.
She cannot refuse my call: 
I am her father in death.

She comes.
I see her before me, 
Her vivid features marked
By an emotional hurt.
Impossible-
I know now the love she has
For our Enemy is strong.
It is her remembrance, 
An impossibility.
Even I have no memory. 

She speaks, her voice dead
As she is dead.
'Who is Nemesis? '

I am cunning.
A thousand year existence
Will make one so.

'He is your ending, 
As I am your beginning.'

She does not understand.

'Why is Nemesis? '

'Because there will always be resistance 
To the freedom we offer.'

This she understood-
'What freedom, 
Our hell? 
No life, 
Only endless death.'

I smile at her, mirthlessly.
It is the grin of a predator.
I am that predator, lurking in the shadows, 
For too long without an equal.
But she is my equal, 
Or, perhaps, my better, 
Though she is young, 
And does not know it.

I want her, still, 
But now I want her to know
-Realize-
What we are, 
And what we can be, together.

Now, 
Master and slave
-Who is who? -
Together, 
Truly dead and truly alive, 
Rulers of the night. 

We build a world
where truth is dangerous.

We paint smiles, 
smiles to hide
we don´t know why.

Fear and lies, 
the bricks we use 
to build this mask.

Can we stand 
what we are? 

Please don´t ask, 
just smile. 

Mommy, mommy don’t leave me here alone.
I don’t like you talking on the phone.
I just got home, I have so much to say.
Please mommy listen to what happened today.

Go away, can’t you see, I’m busy as can be.
This is my time, I work very hard, 
go play ball with the kids in the yard.
I’ll give you a call when the phone is free.

My mommy doesn’t love me, she has no time for me.
I think I’ll call my friends, get some ectasy.
Who cares anyway, she has the telephone.
I’ll show her, when I come back home.

It’s getting very late, I can’t find your sister.
Where did she go, I’m worried and I miss her.
It’s just not like her to leave like that.  
I wonder what she’s thinking, that little brat.

The telephone rings, it’s constable Mc


Clurry
He needs you at the hospital in a hurry.
Oh my gosh, an accident, your poor sis.
I’ll sue whoever is responsible for this.

I’m sorry madam, there’s no easy way to say.
Your daughter was found unconscious today.
She overdosed on a drug called ectasy.
She may not make it, I’m sorry as can be.

The moral of the story, put that phone away.
Make time for your children each and every day.
No one should come before them, 
don’t let them go astray. 

Rana recollected the past, 
And a few events last, 
When he always yielded
To Meera’s every demand.
 
Why she had no concern
For my legitimate needs
As I’m the principal head.'

"On Vijayadasami day last, 
For a festival of the state, 
Though I specially invited
She had failed to attend."

"She has kept the doors
Open now for our enemies
By inviting all sadhus
Even false spying sadhus."

Night and day remain, 
Mixing with common people
In the Krishna Temple."

"I tried to kill her 
To save our honour, 
She survives always
And she never dies." 

Like this, his mind revolved
O’er odd thoughts around.
Finally he sent word to her
To sink and die in the river.

He wished to sacrifice Meera, 
Before fighting with Allaludin, 
Who came with a war preparation.

Meera jumped into the river.
But nothing happened to her.
Krishna told her, she was free
To go and live elsewhere.

She realized her mission, 
And left for Vrindavan, 
Krishna’s abode of peace
And the lovable place.

She mixed with devotees
In all the assemblies, 
They loved her songs.
With her they also sang.

There she went to meet
Rupa Goswami and greet, 
But he didn’t come out
From his Ashram hut.

He then sent word to her
That he couldn’t see her
As she was a woman
Not eligible to be seen.

She replied, "This is a place
For all the women gopies, 
Excepting Krishna, a male
All others are only female."

Goswami heard her plea.
He came running to see
And begged her pardon
For his shameful action.

For a pretty long time
She stayed with them
At the Holy Vrindavan
To fulfill her mission. 

I don’t want to admit it
But I am a spy you know
I spy on my neighbours
They are interesting, that’s what I think so
That night I was prowling on my terrace
To catch a ghost red handed
When a loud noise reached my ears
I thought an alien space ship had landed
I peered into my neighbor’s house 
And this is what I got to see
My neighbours were watching
A horror movie on TV
The clock struck midnight
And the church bells began to chime
A man was sitting in a corner
Drinking some juice of lime
Suddenly the doorbell rang
So the man flung open the door
And there stood Frankenstein
The sight made the man 
Fall to the floor
The man started to run
As Frankenstein went right for him
He sure looked shabby 
He should give his hair a trim
The Frankenstein drove him everywhere
With his huge knife
Whilst the man kept running
Praying for dear life
Then he accidentally dropped the lime juice
Which made Frankenstein buzz angrily like a bee
And he started bawling and said
"Why didn’t you save any for me? "I remember days when I sat alone
In the dark, with savage beasts 
Dancing beside me.
All the while my greatest hazard
Was the thought. But then you came in, 
Turned on the light and, with an 
Uninteligible smile, watched the monsters
Disappear. Then you walked
Towards me and stood like the leaning tower
Which came down hard with the words: 
'Ufuna ni apha? '
'What do you seek here? '

Of all the thousands of words
Running through my mind
I could only reach for one: 
Me. 
Half asking, half telling, 
Addressed to you and I.
Then you turned 'round
Without a sound, and left; 
You turned the light off
But left the door half open
With your light shining beyond.

Oh body of my soul! 
Slowly you walked, 
But you walked, dammit! 
And you left me lying there, 
Head on bed, heart on hands; 
Limbs, bones, breath, 
Feeling detached from myself.
So now you go ahead 
And make the report.
I know you hate paper-work
But you, you were the one
That found me. 

Up close and tied tight 
to nature the worker or watcher becomes 
half-wild.

Observing each detailed life 
of perhaps fish or bird begets changes and 
helps us to see like 
a child.

Full on and in there the wonder
of other than ' I' hits the senses, surprises
us if understanding is sought
then we begin reacting 
with awe.

Living together and sharing 
earth-space with all kinds of natural things
is exciting and will compel us to think 
more that all other earthlings 
count and are worth 
fighting for. 

Here
every single day
Where
can I get away? 
Long
waiting for this day to end
Wrong
I can't have a friend
Why
do I care any more? 
Die
this life's a bore
Look
my eyes turn wet
Took
what I could not get
Know
I have a mind
Show
what I could not find
Take
away this pain
Make
me forget my name
Here
I sit and write
care
for what is right
Told
no one how I feel
Hold
me and I am real
Yes
I am so alive
Confess
I even have a life.  

It is  on the clock face. 
I'm awake, but tired
As my thoughts drift softly to you
Will everything truly be alright? 
So the time may keep hushed lips
But what for? 
A second chance at redemption, not truly the first

Odd, great inspiration resides in this flesh 
Against the odds at such an, dare I say odd hour
So how will tomorrow fair? 
Sunny or Overcast? Windy or Calm? 
With or without these conditions one thing remains. 
The big wall between how we each feel. 
This thought become apparent at  in the morning

Why is this so? 
Why do we remember such thing as what one did? 
What the past holds the present can rectify
Or so it seems, not in our darkest time, no
But surely when all is said and done
Justification may be proven by present actions
Not taken to late, of course

But without you I feel not lost, but. 
It's queer, as of now not really hurting
But it's as if a piece of me is missing
Why does my heart yearn for anyone at  in the early morning? 

What is it about you? 
What makes you so special you ask, 
Well you and me both. 
What is it about you that makes the glimmer in my eyes shine? 
Or the sadness in your tone that causes me great grief in my soul? 
It's awful to be baffling madness such as this at  A. 

M.

But I can't help but type out these thoughts
Typing as if to you
Knowing somewhere out there you may one day read this. 
Yet, I doubt you'll ever get to hear this from my mouth
You know as well as I envy is a terrible sassy spastic thing
Always when I get close it pushes me back into hate and pain

Something you just don't feel 
At  when you dead tired in the morning/ night
Whichever you take it. 
I only keep myself awake by these sort of thoughts
Keying the things that come to mind as I think about. 
You, the break-up, my anger, my jealousy, my idiocy, my hurt

I love you, if that isn't obvious enough
I've cried some many tears over you
I've laughed with you so many times as well
But I'll never have looked into those beautiful blue eyes enough
I doubt I'll ever get the chance though, I must point out
You belong to another, yes? 
Go off with him, do whatever you please. 

I just have but one question looming over me
At  in the why do I think about the girl that I told'
'I love you' why did I say it? 
That I know of course. 
Because when you break down the barriers built
And the sacrifices of love and the pain that went into them
I said it because I truly do love this girl, but
 When she told me, 
'I love you, too', while she has someone else
That's what truly puzzles me. 
Who does she love. 
Is it me, the one that is a back bitter, 
The Judas to my own soul? 
Or does she truly love him? 
The one she is with now? 

The thoughts still swim around int my head
I'm awake, but tired
And at  I seem to find this being complete. 
Good-night my ex-lover
I love you. 
But if you do, why do you love me

Tic, tac, and we move
to that place of lesser resistance, 
where inertia rests, 
and there is no danger.
We think they are the things we love, 
our lullabies.

But dreams chase us, 
they wear costumes, 
they call us " liar ", "coward".
They shout our misery.
They are beasts waiting 
for their freedom
or their banquet
under our pillows


A cold shower
Is a good way
To open my eyes.

I wake up with the stare 
of those clean weightless 
compasionate eyes, 
filling me with motionless 
sweet energy.

Peace, wide forehead, 
translucient skin 
of your huge eyed look, 
Amelia.

I wish you could feel the diamonds. 

She walked, once, in the light.
Life, 
Joy, 
Love.
No more-
The unspeakable darkness
Has changed her.
Now, she who once was the light
Is darkness.
She is consumed by her change.
She is dead, 
Gone to the depths 
Of the darkness of eternity, 
Waking dead.
Her smile is gone, 
Her laugh silent, 
The warmth of her arms
Grown cold.
She once lived in the day, 
Now the night.
-Night, her protection, 
Her new hope, 
Her only hope.

He -her new enemy- remembers
Her life, 
And mourns her change. 
He cries, alone, 
Longing to hear her laugh.
But he only sees her, silent.
He is haunted, having seen her: 
He knows now that she exists, 
Dead, 
But not dead.
He mourns, fearing her.
-She, once a beautiful dream, is become
The stuff of nightmares.-
He knows, too, the task before him: 
Kill, destroy, end.
She is begun on a terrible path, 
Which only he can save her from, 
So losing her forever. 
-There is a different abyss, darker and more terrible, 
Reserved for the souls of the waking dead.-
He hates himself, knowing the fate she faces, 
Yet being unable to save her from it.

For an instant, 
A thought enters his mind: 
Join her.
He knows well the method, 
Having fought so long
In the twilight.
But no- he knows too the torment
Of the soul trapped in the dead.
There is no escaping her fate, or his-
He must do his task, 
Though he knows the consequences on his heart, 
His being.
The Hunter
-Nemesis-
Laments his dead, 
Changed.
Vengeance -his goal- burns. 

Main woh suraj banna chahti hoon
Jo kabhi dhal sakta nahin.
Aur jab raat ho jaaye, 
To taaron mein main bikhar jaoongi.

Main woh baadal banna chahti hoon
Jo kabhi mit sakta nahin.
Aur jab saawan aa jaaye
To boondein bankar main bikhar jaoongi.

Main woh jasmine banna chahti hoon
Aur jab main daali se gir jaoon
To khushboo banke bikhar jaoongi.

Main woh insan banna chahti hoon
Jo kabhi mar sakta nahin.
Aur jab maut karib aa jaaye
To apne usoolon se main amar ho jaoongi.

for I’m covered by his blood.
He walks with me and talks with me.
My face shines for all to see
He carries me when I’m weak
Lifting me off my feet.
He is my savior, my truth, my all.
He gives me strength to stand very tall.
knowing in my heart, he will never leave us.
I’ve known you long before the age of seven
I thank you
Heavenly Father, for the gift of  your only son
I’ll worship, praise and give you all the glory.
For many precious years to come.

Give me your ear
I have much to say
You must hear.

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I truly love you

for a seed of humanity.

In some I suspect there to be a bud
and a sun be shining down upon it, 
Water be poured out on it, 
feeding and nourishing it to greater life.

Others I assume will have matured growth, 
singing of the blisses spring has swept along, 
reaching to others, spreading its song, 
and strengthening those that have yet to bloom.

But then there are those
that I do not understand, 
no matter how strong my wish is to know.
Their dirt holds a seed, but the dark overshadows it
and the rain is pent up in the sky
and everything that is buried is starved, 
everything below the dirt is dry. 

He stands with sixteen plates of the elements
Shifting through space and time
As if a bullet through a rifting of natural law

At the height of ten feet and six inches
He towers above us all
With the weight of seven-hundred and five point five pounds
He is a massive work of strength and beauty

He casts his Judgment upon all
For in his eyes his creation has betrayed the maker
He is everything

He is the god of the beast and man
Forever


An intermingling of the races, 
coming together, holding hands
with smiles and laughter.
Enjoying  all differences.  
Sharing, loving, showing 
respect in so many ways.
Living in harmony, realizing
although our religious beliefs
are not the same, we are still
people and we have feelings, 
we hurt, we cry, we grieve, 
and the inevitable, we die.
Not wasting precious time here
people and we all have worth.
When we can join together as
one, until our earths work is
done, then we have achieved
what was believed to be the
impossible.  We will have
achieved. "Racial Peace"Clothed in but rags and dust and the tears for the sins of the world
Fire and truth flow from their  mouth and devour dark men of earth
In their days ofwitness no one shall harm them
And when it is finished the shall be slain by the Beast of the Bottomless Pit

Their bodies will lie is the streets of the city of unholiness
The city of the spirit of idol worshipers and the lusts of humanity
The the men and women of the earth shall rejoice when seeing their lifeless bodies
The two prophets that tormented the sinners of earth

They stand tall on their feet, the two witnesses life once again
Then from the clouds the great voice beckons, 'COME UP HERE' 
Within the same hour there is a trembling throughout the Earth
A tenth of the people of the unholy city died in the quake of the ground

Only then did their hearts open to the message of the witnesses
Glory to the Omega was giving by the living and the dead were burned in the fire You have to get
from point A
to point B
in my 
mind

without taking
a wrong turn, 

that's not
as easy
as it may sound, 

a single word
can throw you off

if you take
a meaning
I don't intend
or slide
off on a slippery
patch of syntax.

I comb over poems
again and again looking
for the dead-end
or the likely wrong turn
or the roadblocks

because I know most of you
won't go on
if you come to 
a log or a dead cow
in the road

you'll just
start reading
someone else.

How long do I have
to make
an impression
on you, 
seconds, 
the way those books
at Kinkos say it is
with a job interview? 

So I have
to make sure
my syntax
is a throughway
and then

I have to get a grant
to boost the infrastructure
add a few lanes
(subtly, 
NOT LIKE THIS!)      

so you not only won't
have to puzzle
it out too much, 

but it'll keep you 
absolutely riveted



i give up


The colonies were the beginning
Of the beautiful country we know
Folks gathered from other places
To find a new place in which to go

It started on the eastern coast
And slowly moved to the west
Hard work and tremendous struggles
To create a land that became the best

Imagine leaving your homeland
Taking a chance you’ll find a new place
To discover and to develop from nothing
I’m sure this wasn’t planned in haste

Because they were truly heroes, I feel
With a sense of adventure and curiosity
They were extremely intellectual people 
It is almost unbelievable to me

There are places displayed just for them 
Those folks that pulled it all together
Through the most difficult times
In spite of all kinds of adverse weather

I think it’s a wonderful thing to honor
And share with you and with me
Beautiful places like no other
Honoring our colonies

I can feel him.
-Nemesis-
He hunts, 
I hunt.
The darkness, 
Shadows, 
Cemetery.
I come here often: 
The wisdom and might of the ages 
Is buried here.
It is daring, 
To be so predictable. 
Another would fear his enemy’s coming; 
Not I-
I am confident in my strength.

He draws near.
-The approach of the end.-
I am still, savoring
The sheer feeling of my enemy.
He is come for my soul, 
I for his body.

He is aware, tonight.
I do not remember a time
When his presence has been so keen.
He knows me-
My essence, 
My being.
And he is prepared.

Speech, my power.
With it, I delay my victims, 
Deaden their senses, 
Dull their brain-
Then I may strike.

I speak to him.
He hides in the shadow-

"The night has come for you, Nemesis."

"I fear no darkness."

"I am the thing 
That comes for you in the darkness.
Fear me."

He scorns me, outwardly.
-I know that inwardly he fears.-
"Thing of darkness, 
I have something against you."

I know what thing he speaks of
-Who he speaks of.-
I know his loss, 
His pain, 
His anger.
I mock him: 
"She is beautiful, now."

"I have seen her.
I have touched her."

-A miracle that he is alive, 
If that is true.-

I smell his blood, 
Metallic, 
A true delicacy.
-I hunger.-
I laugh, dry and brittle: 
The laugh of the Changed. 


"I think she has touched you, as well.
There is danger in her lips, Nemesis.
There lurks there eternity."

His shadow moves. Closer.
I can feel his heartbeat, 
Throbbing inside my skull.
The animal in me wakes.
The unholy appetite stirs in my soul.
I need Nemesis: he alone
Will satisfy me now.

I move, angling
For an attack.
He sees it, knows.
I think for an instant: 
He knows of my hunger, 
And -worse- believes.

I have said before, 
I respect this mortal.
This respect holds me back, 
Calms my hunger. 

He speaks again: 
"Darkness, I am light.
Death, I am life.
I am your ending.
Look on me, and know fear."

A blaze! Fire- a torch in his hand! 
On his chest, the sign of the cross.
-The end, in that sign: 
The abyss waits.-
An inhuman scream
-My own.-
Terror.
He attacks, a stake in his hand; 
I deflect the blow-
The stake misses its mark, 
Plunges into my arm.
-I feel no pain; 
I am dead.-
His torch- the flame
Dances in my eyes.
I am dazed, 
Blind.
I can feel the flames of the abyss, 
Burning.
I call on my strength, 
Fight him off; 
My soul clings to its existence.
For a moment, I consider
Drinking him-
But I cannot: 
He is strong, now.
My hunger wanes, reluctantly.
I will drink him-
This I vow; 
But I retreat now, 
Not defeated, 
Only weakened.

I disappear into the darkness: 
We will meet again. 

Turning is no party in the house
Turning will be a sure louse
Turning will be alot to handle
Turning is no flame of the candle-

'Cause even though
My birthday's coming up
Who'd really care
When they've got: 
Three chapters of a novel study, a word reflection, 
One persuasive brochure, nineteen pages of social studies-
Live life, hate life-
No joy, no fun-
Nothing comes without a price. 
Life comes with the price
That you never see light again.  

Ted was a boy at school, 
More principled than the rest.
He excelled in all the fields
And he was teacher's best.

His friends once decide
To plunder his neighbour's grove.
Ted warns them against this
But  forcefully the friends move.

Ted threatens to penalize them, 
None takes heed to Ted.
He cries in agony for farmer
For he had a family to be fed.

He then tries his diplomacy
And says, 'I'll assist you in this task! '
And I must get three-fourths of plunder
Or I shall unveil your mask!  

They agree, to the orchard they go
And rob every apple cluster.
Ted gets his share of plunder
He, but, gives it away to the sodbuster.

He narrates the entire episode 
To the poor poorer prole, 
Says, 'This was all I could save! '
And such was Ted's beaut role! 

d of June,t dance I am horrible
At music I am hopeless
And when it comes to volleyball
I am simply useless
At skipping I am nothing
But a little bit of waste
At chess I always lose
Cause I am in a haste
At monopoly I am vermin
Roller skating makes me fall
I am always last in racing
At relay I'm not good at all
But there is only one thing
At which I am considered cool
And that is
  .
Causing mayhem in school


Am I mad? 
Many things are piercing 
Their sharp arrows on my soul, my body
And my life..
Madness is flying around
And I want to throw it away-
I can’t resist all these sorrows-
I don’t know what is surrounding me-
Anyway, it’s not giving me peace-
Why are you giving me all these? 
All my friends are enjoying their victory
And I am enjoying my unlucky fate! 
I am trying very hard to get out of this-
Whenever I gather strength, 
Another blow is coming through
Its usual way! 
I know, that is life’s way! 
My mother, 
Today her heart is
Splitting like a fallen dewdrop-
So many dreams on me she had-
Always expected me to win a rank
But now, 
The day which she wished to
Celebrate by distributing sweets, 
She is sitting   with very empty eyes
And an empty heart near me..
The day which she wished to
See her daughter like
The Sun of happiness, 
She is seeing her face, 
With not even a single hair, 
Not even capable of walking herself

I want to die. 
Kill me please-
I beg you-
I pray you-

Tail turned to red sunset on a juniper crown a lone magpie cawks.

I walked in the sunlight that unashamedly shone on a day of dread 
and it warmed my cold face and somewhere in Paris a man sits 
outside and plays "Imagine" on a piano it is heart -breaking and I`m
filled with conflicting feeling anger and trying to understand what
 is impossible to grasp.

 I fear the backlash and the fascist demagogues who can use the shock
 to their political goal and they will be believed by an incensed mob, 
Arabs will be killed for belonging to Semitic tribe that have suffered
unbelievable bad luck that never seems to end.

He has survived.
-Nemesis-
The dead hunter has fled.
He knows well what he has escaped.
The darkness has withdrawn, 
For a moment.
Tonight, he sleeps.

She is alive: 
Within her, she can feel
Emotion.
Child-like, she wonders
At the feeling.
Her father has told her nothing of this.
She realizes that he knows nothing of this.
-A thousand years, 
Without memory of emotion.-
He has told her she does not feel-
He does not know.
He also has told her she does not remember-
He is a fool.
He has tried to keep her ignorant; 
He has failed.
She is confused, still, 
But she is not stupid.
She knows.
She knows what she is, 
She knows who she was, 
She knows life, 
She knows light, 
She knows lust, 
She knows love.
-Nemesis-
She remembers.

The wound on his hand refuses to heal.
Infection has set in. Grimly, 
He cleans the wound, 
The pain of the cleansing 
Nothing compared to the pain in his heart.
The blood rinses away, 
Mingling with water, 
Swimming in dark red rivers 
Down his arm.
Tears run down his face-
Lost love.

She is torn in two: 
Her human, 
Emotion, 
Life.
Her other, 
Changed, 
Dead.
She wants to love, 
But her new being 
Fights her love.

His wound, clean, bandaged.
Much as his heart, 
Washed by blood, 
Rinsed clean.
Memory remains, 
Colored red. 

Hey Mate could you lend me a few extra Quid
I need to buy me someone to love me tonight
Me wife ran off with a much younger man than I
Leaving me here with pounds of wretched squalor__
The Chemist said he could prescribe me a therapeutic agent
but what I've got in mind would provide a befitting end
To the bloody pain in my heart I've been experiencing
She would be fourteen stones and not a pebble less
A Renaissance woman suitable for the King of any house__
With her hips as soft as down filled pillows
and her full red lips tasting of the sweetest honey
She'd wear me out and then lay me down to sleep a tad
beneath her more than ample bosoms___
I always knew I was born to die.  

it was never even in question
But never in a thousand years would I have believed
My death would be from loneliness___
O' how I miss my sweet and bonnie's #ass
    Than all the valleys of Ionian hills.
    The swimming vapour slopes athwart the glen,
    Puts forth an arm, and creeps from pine to pine,
    And loiters, slowly drawn. On either hand
    The lawns and meadow-ledges midway down
    Hang rich in flowers, and far below them roars
    The long brook falling thro' the clov'n ravine
    In cataract after cataract to the sea.
   Behind the valley topmost Gargarus
   Stands up and takes the morning: but in front
   The gorges, opening wide apart, reveal
   Troas and Ilion's column'd citadel,
   The crown of Troas.         Hither came at noon
   Mournful none, wandering forlorn
   Of Paris, once her playmate on the hills.
   Her cheek had lost the rose, and round her neck
   Floated her hair or seem'd to float in rest.
   She, leaning on a fragment twined with vine,
   Sang to the stillness, till the mountain-shade
   Sloped downward to her seat from the upper cliff.

   "O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida,
   Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
   For now the noonday quiet holds the hill:
   The grasshopper is silent in the grass:
   The lizard, with his shadow on the stone,
   Rests like a shadow, and the winds are dead.
   The purple flower droops: the golden bee
   Is lily-cradled: I alone awake.
   My eyes are full of tears, my heart of love,
   My heart is breaking, and my eyes are dim,
   And I am all aweary of my life.

   "O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida,
   Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
   Hear me, O Earth, hear me, O Hills, O Caves
   That house the cold crown'd snake! O mountain brooks,
   Hear me, for I will speak, and build up all
   My sorrow with my song, as yonder walls
   Rose slowly to a music slowly breathed,
   A cloud that gather'd shape: for it may be
   That, while I speak of it, a little while
   My heart may wander from its deeper woe.

       "O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida,
   Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
   I waited underneath the dawning hills,
   Aloft the mountain lawn was dewy-dark,
   And dewy-dark aloft the mountain pine:
   Beautiful Paris, evil-hearted Paris,
   Leading a jet-black goat white-horn'd, white-hooved,
   Came up from reedy Simois all alone.

       "O mother Ida, harken ere I die.
   Far-off the torrent call'd me from the cleft:
   Far up the solitary morning smote
   The streaks of virgin snow. With down-dropt eyes
   I sat alone: white-breasted like a star
   Fronting the dawn he moved; a leopard skin
   Droop'd from his shoulder, but his sunny hair
   And his cheek brighten'd as the foam-bow brightens
   When the wind blows the foam, and all my heart
   Went forth to embrace him coming ere he came.

       "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
   He smiled, and opening out his milk-white palm
   Disclosed a fruit of pure Hesperian gold,
   That smelt ambrosially, and while I look'd
   And listen'd, the full-flowing river of speech
   Came down upon my heart.      `My own none,
   Beautiful-brow'd none, my own soul,
   Behold this fruit, whose gleaming rind ingrav'n
   "For the most fair," would seem to award it thine,
   As lovelier than whatever Oread haunt
   The knolls of Ida, loveliest in all grace
   Of movement, and the charm of married brows.'

       "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
   He prest the blossom of his lips to mine,
   And added 'This was cast upon the board,
   Ranged in the halls of Peleus; whereupon
   Rose feud, with question unto whom 'twere due:
   But light-foot Iris brought it yester-eve,
   Delivering that to me, by common voice
   Elected umpire, Here comes to-day,
   Pallas and Aphrodite, claiming each
   This meed of fairest. Thou, within the cave
   Behind yon whispering tuft of oldest pine,
   Mayst well behold them unbeheld, unheard

   "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
   It was the deep midnoon: one silvery cloud
   Had lost his way between the piney sides
   Of this long glen. Then to the bower they came,
   Naked they came to that smooth-swarded bower,
   And at their feet the crocus brake like fire,
   Violet, amaracus, and asphodel,
   Lotos and lilies: and a wind arose,
   And overhead the wandering ivy and vine,
  This way and that, in many a wild festoon
  Ran riot, garlanding the gnarled boughs
  With bunch and berry and flower thro' and thro'.


     "O mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  On the tree-tops a crested peacock lit,
  And o'er him flow'd a golden cloud, and lean'd
  Upon him, slowly dropping fragrant dew.
  Then first I heard the voice of her, to whom
  Coming thro' Heaven, like a light that grows
  Rise up for reverence. She to Paris made
  Proffer of royal power, ample rule
  Unquestion'd, overflowing revenue
  Wherewith to embellish state, 'from many a vale
  And river-sunder'd champaign clothed with corn,
  Or labour'd mine undrainable of ore.
  Honour,' she said, 'and homage, tax and toll,
  From many an inland town and haven large,
  Mast-throng'd beneath her shadowing citadel
  In glassy bays among her tallest towers.'


     "O mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  Still she spake on and still she spake of power,
  'Which in all action is the end of all;
  Power fitted to the season; wisdom-bred
  And throned of wisdom--from all neighbour crowns
  Alliance and allegiance, till thy hand
  Fail from the sceptre-staff. Such boon from me,
  A shepherd all thy life but yet king-born,
  Should come most welcome, seeing men, in power
  Rest in a happy place and quiet seats
  Above the thunder, with undying bliss
  In knowledge of their own supremacy.'


     "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  She ceased, and Paris held the costly fruit
  Out at arm's-length, so much the thought of power
  Flatter'd his spirit; but Pallas where she stood
  Somewhat apart, her clear and bared limbs
  O'erthwarted with the brazen-headed spear
  Upon her pearly shoulder leaning cold,
  The while, above, her full and earnest eye
  Over her snow-cold breast and angry cheek
  Kept watch, waiting decision, made reply.


     "`Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control,
  These three alone lead life to sovereign power.
  Yet not for power (power of herself
  Would come uncall'd for) but to live by law,
  Acting the law we live by without fear;
  And, because right is right, to follow right
  Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.'


     "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  Again she said: 'I woo thee not with gifts.
  Sequel of guerdon could not alter me
  To fairer. Judge thou me by what I am,
  So shalt thou find me fairest.          Yet, indeed,
  If gazing on divinity disrobed
  Thy mortal eyes are frail to judge of fair,
  Unbias'd by self-profit, oh! rest thee sure
  That I shall love thee well and cleave to thee,
  So that my vigour, wedded to thy blood,
  To push thee forward thro' a life of shocks,
  Dangers, and deeds, until endurance grow
  Sinew'd with action, and the full-grown will,
  Circled thro' all experiences, pure law,
  Commeasure perfect freedom.'          Here she ceas'd
  And Paris ponder'd, and I cried, 'O Paris,
  Give it to Pallas!' but he heard me not,
  Or hearing would not hear me, woe is me!


     "O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida,
  Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  Italian Aphrodite beautiful,
  Fresh as the foam, new-bathed in Paphian wells,
  With rosy slender fingers backward drew
  From her warm brows and bosom her deep hair
  Ambrosial, golden round her lucid throat
  And shoulder: from the violets her light foot
  Shone rosy-white, and o'er her rounded form
  Between the shadows of the vine-bunches
  Floated the glowing sunlights, as she moved.


     "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  She with a subtle smile in her mild eyes,
  The herald of her triumph, drawing nigh
  Half-whisper'd in his ear, 'I promise thee
  The fairest and most loving wife in Greece.'
  She spoke and laugh'd: I shut my sight for fear:
  But when I look'd, Paris had raised his arm,
  And I beheld great Here's angry eyes,
  As she withdrew into the golden cloud,
  And I was left alone within the bower;
  And from that time to this I am alone,
  And I shall be alone until I die.


     "Yet, mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  Fairest--why fairest wife? am I not fair?
  My love hath told me so a thousand times.
  Methinks I must be fair, for yesterday,
  When I past by, a wild and wanton pard,
  Eyed like the evening star, with playful tail
  Crouch'd fawning in the weed. Most loving is she?
  Ah me, my mountain shepherd, that my arms
  Were wound about thee, and my hot lips prest
  Close, close to thine in that quick-falling dew
  Of fruitful kisses, thick as Autumn rains
  Flash in the pools of whirling Simois!


     "O mother, hear me yet before I die.
  They came, they cut away my tallest pines,
  My tall dark pines, that plumed the craggy ledge
  High over the blue gorge, and all between
  The snowy peak and snow-white cataract
  Foster'd the callow eaglet--from beneath
  Whose thick mysterious boughs in the dark morn
  The panther's roar came muffled, while I sat 
  Low in the valley. Never, never more
  Shall lone none see the morning mist
  Sweep thro' them; never see them overlaid
  With narrow moon-lit slips of silver cloud,
  Between the loud stream and the trembling stars.


     "O mother, hear me yet before I die.
  I wish that somewhere in the ruin'd folds,
  Among the fragments tumbled from the glens,
  Or the dry thickets, I could meet with her
  The Abominable, that uninvited came
  Into the fair Pele{:i}an banquet-hall,
  And cast the golden fruit upon the board,
  And bred this change; that I might speak my mind,
  And tell her to her face how much I hate


     "O mother, hear me yet before I die.
  Hath he not sworn his love a thousand times,
  In this green valley, under this green hill,
  Ev'n on this hand, and sitting on this stone?
  Seal'd it with kisses? water'd it with tears?
  O happy tears, and how unlike to these!
  O happy Heaven, how canst thou see my face?
  O happy earth, how canst thou bear my weight?
  O death, death, death, thou ever-floating cloud,
  There are enough unhappy on this earth,
  Pass by the happy souls, that love to live:
  I pray thee, pass before my light of life,
  And shadow all my soul, that I may die.
  Thou weighest heavy on the heart within,
  Weigh heavy on my eyelids: let me die.


     "O mother, hear me yet before I die.
  I will not die alone, for fiery thoughts
  Do shape themselves within me, more and more,
  Whereof I catch the issue, as I hear
  Dead sounds at night come from the inmost hills,
  Like footsteps upon wool. I dimly see
  My far-off doubtful purpose, as a mother
  Conjectures of the features of her child
  Ere it is born: her child!--a shudder comes
  Across me: never child be born of me,
  Unblest, to vex me with his father's eyes!


     "O mother, hear me yet before I die.
  Hear me, O earth. I will not die alone,
  Lest their shrill happy laughter come to me
  Walking the cold and starless road of death
  Uncomforted, leaving my ancient love
  With the Greek woman. I will rise and go
  Down into Troy, and ere the stars come forth
  Talk with the wild Cassandra, for she says
  A fire dances before her, and a sound
  Rings ever in her ears of armed men.
  What this may be I know not, but I know
  That, wheresoe'er I am by night and day,
  All earth and air seem only burning fire

"Her wing was broken, 
Her body covered in oil.
The product of a spill in the lake.
She fought hard trying to survive
but it was just too late.
The poor wee duckling closed her eyes.
There she laid
There she died


Thou two-faced year, Mother of Change and Fate, 
Didst weep when Spain cast forth with flaming sword, 
Prince, priest, and people, spurned by zealot hate. 
Hounded from sea to sea, from state to state, 
The West refused them, and the East abhorred. 
No anchorage the known world could afford, 
Close-locked was every port, barred every gate. 
Then smiling, thou unveil'dst, O two-faced year, 
A virgin world where doors of sunset part, 
Saying, "Ho, all who weary, enter here! 
There falls each ancient barrier that the art 
Of race or creed or rank devised, to rear 
Grim bulwarked hatred between heart and heart!"I keep falling in love
with my mother,
I dont want to hurt her
-Of all people to hurt.

Every time I see her
she's grown older
But her uniform always
amazes me
For its Dutch simplicity
And the Doll she is,
The doll-like way
she stands
Bowlegged in my dreams,
Waiting to serve me.

And I am only an Apache
Smoking Hashi
In old Cabashy
By the Lamp. 

I weep at the purity of a little girl
carrying a cup of hot chocolate 
carefully across the room.

Her face becomes the face
of all the children I have known.

You need not despair, Humanity.
We speak of making
the world safe for children, 
but it is children
who make the world safe for us, 

their infusion of innocence
ever freshening our world, 

saving it
from the senility and stagnation
of our dark dreams. 

It was Tuesday, everything fine, 
And Mumbai was rushing home.
Eager and excited, waiting, 
To reach their home sweet home.

Seventh was the month, 
And the date was eleven.
Seven were the blasts, 
Within minutes merely eleven.

And that was a mayhem, 
And that was a plan.
This is sheer terrorism, 
Gone is the life of man.

Seven serial blasts in trains-
They start with Khar, Borivali, 
Then Matunga, Mahim, 
Bhayander, Mira and Jogeshwari.

Happy commuters travelling home, 
And then take place the blasts.
Ending happiness, tiredness forever, 
And Mumbai’s mournful sobbing lasts.

The fast running locals, 
Within minutes came to halt.
Debris of bodies lay on Earth, 
They faced death, though no fault.

But lo! Mumbaikars are spirited humans, 
And I salute this land.
They rush to provide food and water, 
And to donate blood they stand.

See how the victim bleeds, 
Resting on laps of Earth.
And Oh terrorists, say you! 
Is this, you think, mirth? 

Killers! Do only you have dreams, 
Or only do you live a life? 
And the man who died had children, 
And now a bare-browed wife! 

Your demands could be fulfilled, 
And relief you would have sighed.
But what of the helpless parents, 
Whose only child has died? 

Orphans, widows and widowers mourn, 
All because of your sins and you.
And as their gardens wither, 
They shall forever curse you! 

You are the dwellers of hell, 
You shall never taste victory.
You were and will be losers, 
We all are one, not solitary! 

We will never bow or fear, 
Our holy land we can’t cheat.
What beyond lives can you take? 
You shall forever face defeat.

Your doings are wrong, unfair, 
Nothing of what you do is right.
And till the Day of Judgement-
Terrorism can never be justified! 

h of July, 

I am aware.
A new power
-Hers-
Greater than mine.
Also, pride.
She thinks me ignorant.
Ungrateful, foolish woman! 
I have changed her.
I am her power.
She cannot escape me.

I call her.
I am her father; 
She cannot resist my cry.

We meet in a filthy apartment, 
A dunghole, whose occupant
I have enjoyed.
He is dry; he will not need the room.

She is beautiful, as I have said.
But tonight, that hunger is not in me.
I am angry with the anger of the Changed.
-Like a mad dog, 
With no control over my actions.-

From the Living, 
The Changed need only fear
A small variety of charms: 
Fire, the Cross, the wooden stake.
But from brethren, 
The Changed need fear
Much.

She would fear me, in my anger, 
If she were wise.
I cannot sense fear in her: 
Fool.

We speak. I know
She can hear my anger
-I do not hide it.-
Yet she still shows me no fear: 
Fool.

She asks a question: 
"Father, can I feel? "

"No. We are incapable of feelings."

-She sounds young, innocent: 
So she is.
She also sounds 
Foolish.-

"Father, can I remember? "

"No. We are incapable of memory."

-I know she remembers, 
I know she feels.
I have sensed this myself.
But if she realized her own power, 
I would not last.-

"Father, are we the same? "

"Yes. There is no difference-
We are both bound by the hunger."

Suddenly, I sense a flare of anger.
His anger.
-Nemesis-
Then it is gone, and I sense it no more. 


Suddenly, her tone changes.
She becomes more intense.
"Did you meet with Nemesis? "

-Did she sense him as well? -

"Yes, I did. He saw my strength, 
Grew afraid, and fled into the night."

"Oh." Her voice gives a hint of some emotion; 
I could not identify it.
Confusion, 
Another experience alien to me, 
Shows on her face.
"Will you not change him? "

-Change him? 
What being would change
His only real challenge? -
Aloud, I say, 
"No, I will not. You will.
You must change him."

She nods resolutely: 
Her darker being has won.
-We stand in the dark.-Why should I care about rain and or snow, 
About leaves that are green? 
Or all the trees that you climbed that are seen, 
Summer was ours by the sea.
But care I confess that I do.
Taken from me as a leaf caught up in the wind, 
Trapped in a wave, a wave none could see.
There we once we're and now we're both here, 
Silent and still, lost without love and no peace. 


From boys to men the old boys
have come

Into cars, and jets all travelling
as one

Up the same drive that they remember, 
caps on heads, socks pulled up

Now, pates of old thinned grey hair
they are there to sup 

Memories ensconced, relieved they are
still alive

To celebrate with all as one the fifteen
decades that will be revived

caps on heads, socks pulled up

Now, pates of old thinned grey hair
they are there to sup 

Memories ensconced, relieved they are
still alive

To celebrate with all as one the fifteen
decades that will be revived

Fifteen long and strong years, 
Many Happy Laughters, Many Sad Tears, 
Creates loving precious memory, 
Happy Happy h Anniversary!August.
What for it is famous? 

They told us
On this day
We got independence.

Are we independent really? 

They warned us, 
Ask not such
Question further.

They said, 
Worry not, 
We are here for you.
We will take you, 
To the path of progress.

What do you mean by progress? 

They explained
Foreign English language
Will be used everywhere.
Foreign companies will come, 
You will earn more and more dollars.
Your son will read in English medium
And he will go to foreign to serve there.
Your daughter will love to a man
Who is not from your land, and
Your family will be a global one.

The true meaning of freedom and salvation, 
I know not.

I understood nothing, 
And I wonder how they lead us
To totally a false notion.

But our Constitution says-
We, the people are sovereign.
But I realize, the very word
Sovereign is not applicable
Anywhere in our day to day life, 
Here on this earth.

h August- National Day, 
We are proud to this day.
We got independence on this day, 
Independence from English rule.
We took reign of our country
On our own hands.
We made laws for us, 
We declared ourselves sovereign.
We work for our own welfare, 
We are all one and no one is
Bigger or smaller than another one.
We have no discriminations about caste, 
Colour, sex, rich or poor, and
We all enjoy equal power.



h August- National Day, 
On this very day, 
We measure our own sky
That is blue, 
That is the truth.
We see our own spark
That is within us.
On this very day, 
We realise how important we are
On this earth.
We are for peace and co-operation, 
We are for human development
In all directions without any
Contamination or say evil intention. 

See how does the rainy season sizzle, 
And the lovely green grass dazzle, 
The plushest green, the deepest blue, 
The brightest yellow and every hue! 

From here, the window, I can see
The crowd of flowers and the humming bee, 
The sweetest mynah singing fine, 
And the shepherd roaming with his kine! 

Look how the fisher and farmer folks, 
In their milticoloured clothes, 
Sail their raft in th' see and th' creek, 
And the farmer in his field is meek! 

The darling children play in meadow, 
And the cattle rest in shadow, 
Mystifies me the naughty butterfly, 
Stupefies me th' rainbow in the sky! 

The cold rivulets gush and roar, 
And sweet fragrance the winds here borne, 
The weather lulls and the storms chill, 
The buds bloom and the petals frill! 

How enchanted is the nature here! 
So melodious are the voices, hear-
In love with Dahanu, the countryside; 
Khushamadeed-on a Nature's ride! 




Factor common for
Democracy and corruption


I see in the mirror of futurity
Our souls shining in the sky
Being a couple of lovely stars
Emitting the beams of Love
Year after year
And showing the way
To the lovers of future
Without being touched
With the sharp edge
Of the scythe of Time
As now our hearts
Are unseparated from each other
And our souls are unified
With the light of Divine Love -
More valuable than anything else 
In the universe.

h December, 

How much farther must we go, 
to reach the land of sex and money.

The wasp's and bee's, 
hurry move and buzz about my head.
The crows land and watch and sit upon 
a iron planted fence.
That stretches round my pointed head.

Dragonfly's, 
upon the roof that spit fire, consume
U. 

S. all who disagree.
Dragging my body 
through the halls of guilded bribery.
Their golden chain 
is stretched out of reach of my weak will.

To my shame and great pleasure, 
the second lady, 
took her silk panties off and sat upon
my face and takes a pee.
So close to me, that I can read her lip's.

They pump out all my blood and replace it with
their sour wine.
One tries to jerk me off and I just suck it
up back inside 
just out of reach of prying eyes, behind the presidential 
paintings on the pearl white walls.

A dynasty of broken doll's, look down from shelves, 
porcelain little arrows, 
that have pierced all their broken heart's, 
now deaf and mute.

How much farther is it? 
Scream the children in the car, here on vaction.
There is mud on all their feet, Thick, red and lumpy. 
It is the thick red clay that they've brought up, 

How much farther is it, to that house upon a lawn, 
where dog's like mine, laid out in state are buried..

hundred Pennsylvania Avenue. 
I ask a cop he say's, turn left, then take a right, 
It's over there it's 
surrounded and sits a way's out back, next to the swamp. 


Where trust that is not blind is not a trust we find, 
His children show. 

The sun is harsh, the winds are cruel
The trees unfeeling, the soil so unsympathetic
The stones lack the courage, the grasses lose the enthusiasm
The clouds spiritless
The moon is devoid of compassion
The stars are pitiless
You are unkind and I am disheartened
My heart is broken

You are heartless 
the ruler of my body

i have longed
to touch you
to kiss you even 
just once

yet you are so high
and far
you are with the stars
on my darkest skies‘Blow up and blown up first 
Bloom up in afterlife’: 
Clerics preach
And laugh within
Watching the seeds of terror

Imperfection
. . 

Nature's conjunctions are invisible, 

everything's conjoined, and language
only a dimwitted mimic
running behind.

Adjectives, adverbs stroll 
down the street not modifying, 
but glued into the very atoms of nouns, 

and nouns themselves
are verbs, of course, 
for everything passes.

Where is the prepositional phrase, 
'in the room? ' I don't see it
hanging around the neck
of the man standing over there.

Is there a complete sentence
anywhere 
in vivo? 
Maybe, but then only one! 

Can anything be misspelled there? 

I come up 
from my notebook frustrated.
The grammar of Existence
can't be caged. 

So serene is the lady sitting there, 
Right in front of me, 
Her eyes are so very grey
And her face is trouble free! 

Her eyes are staring mine, 
Like a painter's with his brush; 
Every emotion is told by them, 

Those lovely, wandering eyes
Are perhaps searching something
Amidst the darkness around her, 
Oh, that face is so soothing! 

Her eyes have conquered my heart; 
Though she needs a stick, her daughter.
Seems like black is not so bad! 
The lady has taught me better! 


Can't you know me my dear? 
I am the history of present.
I am an untold story.
I am the tears of happiness.

Can't you remember me dear friend? 
I am an inextinguishable flame of hope.
I am the beams of darkness.
I am the glow of dreams.

Can't you call up me my darling? 
I am a song sung by a Cuckoo.
I am the lover of Love.
I am the flow of a river.

Can't you know me my Love? 
I am the pulse of hearts.
I am the maker of destiny.
I am the reliever of your memory.


Plant me in the yielding soil
Of your tender heart.
Nurse me with the warmth
Of your kind heart
And the showers of your Love.

One day I will grow
To take care all of you.
I will give you
The shadow of my sacred Love.
You must listen to sweet melody
Of Eternity from my branches.

I will give you
The Divine fruits to eat
And the fragrant air
To breathe in.
I will take care all of you
Even if you strike me. 


Is secured for the girls.
They are widely used 
In trade and commerce
Only to attract the customers.

Political leaders get tired 
Making false commitments
To people over the day
And the girls are used at night
As the medium of their entertainment. 

From school girls to house wives-
All are molested or raped
By the vehicle drivers, 
Leaders' men and others
Even in the open place in sun light. 

Nobody cares about the victims.
The reporters become active
To make their newspapers 
And news channels popular
By exposing the news.

Leaders stand by the victims 
Only for political purpose.
Leaving their responsibility
Police become ferocious 
Only to torture the victims. 

The girls are married off
And used only for sexual purpose
And as the child production machines.
Either in society or in family-
Nowhere they are respected. 

Sometimes few victims
Expose the truth and expect 
True judgement from court
But the accused gets punished
After four decades when he dies. 

Not only the male
But also the female
Are involved in selling
And using the children
And the girls as goods. 

This earth will be a happy place
For each and every girl
When all the girls
Will fight for their right
And get true education. 


Just before twilight
My dream was lost 
In the sky of emptiness
And my heart began to pulsate
Like the silent cry of sorrow. 

My eyes wake day and night 
And tears roll down 
Silently and secretly.
My heart is helpless
Like an innocent convict 
Chained in a lone cell. 

Sometimes my nerves stop
To work and then I feel 
As if I am between
Living and non-living thing
As a virus survives
Before attacking beings. 

Not for a single day, 
Not for a single month, 
I've been waiting for a year
Expecting my lost dream
Coming back to me again

Upon the valley of love and separation.
My heart expresses grief for myself. 
Yet my eyes are full of dream and hope. 

My thought is now like an entangled fish
And I am tied with the chain of fate. 
My inner eye can see my career
On the mirror of future clearly.

My inner self cries silently 
In the absence of my soul mate
And I feel as if I am between
The living and non living thing. 

Now I try to move the wheels
Of dream and ambition helplessly
Though my feet are bled
With the thorns of life and love. 

Perhaps one day I will finish
The journey of life successfully
And take rest blissfully 
In the garden of eternal peace. 


In a hot summer afternoon.
Suddenly the sky was covered
With the dark sheets of cloud.
Few black rays entered my mind
To give birth to a mysterious fear. 

I heard the roar of cloud
And felt a storm arising from the west.
My mind and heart got startled 
With the violent wind
But I didn't leave my favourite couch
To see what would happen. 

The whole sky was covered with darkness.
The light of darkness falls on the earth.
I found lightning dancing
With the roaring of cloud. 
The trees looked like the people
Who are forced to stand before cannon. 

When the cool showers of rain poured down, 
I saw you dancing and singing
With the rhythm of the showers of rain.
On seeing you dancing like a fairy
The darkness and fear escaped from my mind
And my heart felt the ecstasy of your Love. 


The complexity of life.
I am very very innocent 
Like a smiling baby.
O my dear, my dear love! 
Don't play with my pure mind. 

My mind is drenched
With the pure dew of Love.
My heart is soaked
With the new born light of truth.
O my dear, my dear Love! 
Don't trample my tender heart.

I don't know how to change myself
Like a blood sucker. 
My mind is white like snow
But it's filled with colourful dreams. 
O my dear, my dear Love! 
Don't make my dreams colourless. 

I live in the world made by myself.
It's adorned with beauty, truth and Love. 
Here dreams fly like the fairies.
Peace and calmness play with me.
O my dear, my dear Love! 
Don't try to destroy my world. 



The Trumpet-Vine Arbour

The throats of the little red trumpet-flowers are wide open,
And the clangour of brass beats against the hot sunlight.
They bray and blare at the burning sky.
Red! Red! Coarse notes of red,
Trumpeted at the blue sky.
In long streaks of sound, molten metal,
The vine declares itself.
Clang! -- from its red and yellow trumpets.
Clang! -- from its long, nasal trumpets,
Splitting the sunlight into ribbons, tattered and shot with noise.

I sit in the cool arbour, in a green-and-gold twilight.
It is very still, for I cannot hear the trumpets,
I only know that they are red and open,
And that the sun above the arbour shakes with heat.
My quill is newly mended,
And makes fine-drawn lines with its point.
Down the long, white paper it makes little lines,
Just lines -- up -- down -- criss-cross.
My heart is strained out at the pin-point of my quill;
It is thin and writhing like the marks of the pen.
My hand marches to a squeaky tune,
It marches down the paper to a squealing of fifes.
My pen and the trumpet-flowers,
And Washington's armies away over the smoke-tree to the Southwest.
'Yankee Doodle,' my Darling! It is you against the British,
Marching in your ragged shoes to batter down King George.
What have you got in your hat? Not a feather, I wager.
Just a hay-straw, for it is the harvest you are fighting for.
Hay in your hat, and the whites of their eyes for a target!
Like Bunker Hill, two years ago, when I watched all day from the house-top
Through Father's spy-glass.
The red city, and the blue, bright water,
And puffs of smoke which you made.
Twenty miles away,
Round by Cambridge, or over the Neck,
But the smoke was white -- white!
To-day the trumpet-flowers are red -- red --
And I cannot see you fighting,
But old Mr. Dimond has fled to Canada,
And Myra sings 'Yankee Doodle' at her milking.
The red throats of the trumpets bray and clang in the sunshine,
And the smoke-tree puffs dun blossoms into the blue air.

The City of Falling Leaves

Leaves fall,
Brown leaves,
Yellow leaves streaked with brown.
They fall,
Flutter,
Fall again.
The brown leaves,
And the streaked yellow leaves,
Loosen on their branches
And drift slowly downwards.
One,
One, two, three,
One, two, five.
All Venice is a falling of Autumn leaves --
Brown,
And yellow streaked with brown.

'That sonnet, Abate,
Beautiful,
I am quite exhausted by it.
Your phrases turn about my heart
And stifle me to swooning.
Open the window, I beg.
'Tis really a shame to stop indoors.
Call my maid, or I will make you lace me yourself.
Fie, how hot it is, not a breath of air!
See how straight the leaves are falling.
Marianna, I will have the yellow satin caught up with silver fringe,
It peeps out delightfully from under a mantle.
Am I well painted to-day, `caro Abate mio'?
You will be proud of me at the `Ridotto', hey?
Proud of being `Cavalier Servente' to such a lady?'
'Can you doubt it, `Bellissima Contessa'?
A pinch more rouge on the right cheek,
And Venus herself shines less . . .'
'You bore me, Abate,
I vow I must change you!
A letter, Achmet?
Run and look out of the window, Abate.
I will read my letter in peace.'
The little black slave with the yellow satin turban
Gazes at his mistress with strained eyes.
His yellow turban and black skin
Are gorgeous -- barbaric.
The yellow satin dress with its silver flashings
Lies on a chair
Beside a black mantle and a black mask.
Yellow and black,
Gorgeous -- barbaric.
The lady reads her letter,
And the leaves drift slowly
Past the long windows.
'How silly you look, my dear Abate,
With that great brown leaf in your wig.
Pluck it off, I beg you,
Or I shall die of laughing.'

A yellow wall
Aflare in the sunlight,
Chequered with shadows,
Shadows of vine leaves,
Shadows of masks.
Masks coming, printing themselves for an instant,
Then passing on,
More masks always replacing them.
Masks with tricorns and rapiers sticking out behind
Pursuing masks with plumes and high heels,
The sunlight shining under their insteps.
One,
One, two,
One, two, three,
There is a thronging of shadows on the hot wall,
Filigreed at the top with moving leaves.
Yellow sunlight and black shadows,
Yellow and black,
Gorgeous -- barbaric.
Two masks stand together,
And the shadow of a leaf falls through them,
Marking the wall where they are not.
From hat-tip to shoulder-tip,
From elbow to sword-hilt,
The leaf falls.
The shadows mingle,
Blur together,
Slide along the wall and disappear.
Gold of mosaics and candles,
And night blackness lurking in the ceiling beams.
Saint Mark's glitters with flames and reflections.
A cloak brushes aside,
And the yellow of satin
Licks out over the coloured inlays of the pavement.
Under the gold crucifixes
There is a meeting of hands
Reaching from black mantles.
Sighing embraces, bold investigations,
Hide in confessionals,
Sheltered by the shuffling of feet.
Gorgeous -- barbaric
In its mail of jewels and gold,
Saint Mark's looks down at the swarm of black masks;
And outside in the palace gardens brown leaves fall,
Flutter,
Fall.
Brown,
And yellow streaked with brown.

Blue-black, the sky over Venice,
With a pricking of yellow stars.
There is no moon,
And the waves push darkly against the prow
Of the gondola,
Coming from Malamocco
And streaming toward Venice.
It is black under the gondola hood,
But the yellow of a satin dress
Glares out like the eye of a watching tiger.
Yellow compassed about with darkness,
Yellow and black,
Gorgeous -- barbaric.
The boatman sings,
It is Tasso that he sings;
The lovers seek each other beneath their mantles,
And the gondola drifts over the lagoon, aslant to the coming dawn.
But at Malamocco in front,
In Venice behind,
Fall the leaves,
Brown,
And yellow streaked with brown.
They fall,
Flutter,
Fall. 

Like a brave soldier fighting alone
Against his enemies
To print his valiant mark
On the flag of his patriotism, 
My indomitable longing goes on 
Fighting within myself 
To express my poetic thought
In the world of beauty and love. 

My poetic mind and my dream, 
Fully different from a famous poetess, 
Give birth to a new world
Where my thought can freely soar
As soaked in the new born sunlight 
A white pigeon flies 
In the firmament of
Peace and happiness.  

When the arrows of words
Smeared with poison
Are cast to strangle
My poetic mind 
Or when my creativity
Is about to be inscribed
By a dark woman on the black epitaph, 
My poetic thought gets matured. 


Make you whole again
You always said I helped mend your broken heart
But you always said I would never lose your hand
Now I know that what we were was so pathetic 
Just contemplating 
Indescribable synthetic makeup of a heart
Crisscrossing over, underneath our veins connected

But everything is wrong now, everything was right
Who’s to say our masochistic way of thinking
Was nothing but a lie? 

Gave in to romance
A novel with our faces on the cover
Never read the ending
Wish I had then maybe I’d be sober
Instead I’m so deadly hung-over
A grave, unsteady pile of stones
Ready to tumble and crush you in your sleep
This is my final tribute to you 



Eighteen. 

Only pain is the asset

At Viscount Nelson’s lavish funeral,
While the mob milled and yelled about St Paul’s,
A General chatted with an Admiral:

"One of your colleagues, Sir, remarked today
That Nelson’s exit, though to be lamented,
Falls not inopportunely, in it’s way"

"He was a thorn in our flesh’, came the reply-
‘The mot bird-witted, unaccountable,
Odd little runt that ever I did spy".

"One arm, one peeper, vain as Pretty Poll,
A meddler too, in foreign politics
And gave his heart in pawn to a plain moll.

Would treat his ratings as though men of honour
And play leap-frog with his midshipmen!

We tried to box him down, but up he popped,
And when he banged Napoleon on the Nile
Became too much the hero to be dropped.

"You’ve heard that Copenhagen ‘blind eye’ story?
We’d tied him to Nurse Parker’s apron- strings-
By G-d, he snipped them through and snatched the glory!"

"Yet", cried the General, ‘sic-and-twenty sail
Captured or sunk by him off Trafalgar-
That writes a handsome finis to the tale"

"Handsome enough. The seas are England’s now.
That fellow’s foibles need no longer plague us
He died most creditably, I’ll allow."

"And Sir, the secret of his victories?"



 

Some call the blues uniquely
       American, from the
    Muggy Mississippi delta to the 

Daunting nighttime streets of
       Chicago, repetitive, 
    Progressive, peaking

& releasing & rife w/
       heartfelt woe, at
    Once springing from and revealing the Soul. 

But the craggy peaks of Hellas cried a
       similar strain, when
    Ottoman occupants seized the 

Cities, songs of loss, 
       Lament &
    Anguish, as old as sin & fresh & 

teary as the original composer, &
       equally ephemeral, a
    song enduring tho neither 





Byron and Shelley found no Achilles reaming a musket nor
       Alexander severing the Gordian knot, only
    hungry, huddled masses waiting  a fruitless wait on 

great Catherine the blond for liberation, driven to 
       Fratricides between gasps on 
    Psiloritis, precursors to the mass exodus to

Chicago not to hear the 
       Wail, but to
    celebrate escape from it, by-

passing the Crossroads &
that bloody john hancock, 

 singers giving way to
       Modern programs, glad to be rid of
    Ethnic burdens w/ no time left for tears.

Tho I never tramped the mountain trails on Ossa or Psiloritis, never saw Minoa, neither strode the Mani seaside, nor do i own a Cretan dagger, the spirit of 'runs coruscant thru me as I amble the sooty, greasy Lisbon St. or sweat the muddy, muggy trails of Thorncrag's secular spiral, or

No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you, terrible year! 
Not you as some pale poetling, seated at a desk, lisping cadenzas 
      piano; 
But as a strong man, erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing, 
      carrying a rifle on your shoulder, 
With well-gristled body and sunburnt face and hands–with a knife in 
      the belt at your side, 
As I heard you shouting loud–your sonorous voice ringing across the 
      continent; 
Your masculine voice, O year, as rising amid the great cities, 
Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you, as one of the workmen, the 
      dwellers in Manhattan; 
Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and 
      Indiana, 
Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait, and descending the 
      Alleghanies; 
Or down from the great lakes, or in Pennsylvania, or on deck along 
      the Ohio river; 
Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers, or at 
      Chattanooga on the mountain top, 
Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs, clothed in blue, bearing 
      weapons, robust year; 
Heard your determin’d voice, launch’d forth again and again; 
Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipp’d cannon, 
I repeat you, hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted year. 


From Clee to heaven the beacon burns, 
The shires have seen it plain, 
From north and south the sign returns 
And beacons burn again. 

Look left, look right, the hills are bright, 
The dales are light between, 
Because 'tis fifty years to-night 

Now, when the flame they watch not towers 
About the soil they trod, 
Lads, we'll remember friends of ours 

To skies that knit their heartstrings right, 
To fields that bred them brave, 
The saviours come not home to-night: 
Themselves they could not save. 

It dawns in Asia, tombstones show 
And Shropshire names are read; 
And the Nile spills his overflow 
Beside the Severn's dead. 

We pledge in peace by farm and town 
And fire the beacons up and down 
The land they perished for. 

From height to height 'tis heard; 
And with the rest your voices ring, 
Lads of the Fifty-third. 

Be you the men you've been, 
Get you the sons your fathers got, 

One less than twenty.

That's forty chunks of month time spans.
months that i've lived, 
times.

In months
I'll be making a decision
that will tear me apart.

But, 
in this fortieth h month span
I'll be trying my hardest
to live.



love letters written
in flesh, 
with all the scars
and bruises in plain sight. 
all the falling stars.

without lightning, 
lightning that came
without the rain. 
broken shovels, broken rakes, 
and a pen that betrayed. 

nails in the bridge, 
miles,steps.
seats at the table, 
dreams and desires! 

a small fire, 
we keep adding logs.
strangers come and go, 
all wanting to get warm.

passing out bowls of stew, 
and old worn blankets.
the night air is still, 
the moonlight whispers

we walk down to the water, 
and see the reflections, 
year after year, soul after soul.

fireflies testify to the darkness.

love letters written, 
from the hollow place
back of your heart



War broke: and now the Winter of the world
With perishing great darkness closes in.
The foul tornado, centred at Berlin,
Is over all the width of Europe whirled,
Rending the sails of progress. Rent or furled
Are all Art's ensigns. Verse wails. Now begin
Famines of thought and feeling. Love's wine's thin.
The grain of human Autumn rots, down-hurled.

For after Spring had bloomed in early Greece,
And Summer blazed her glory out with Rome,
An Autumn softly fell, a harvest home,
A slow grand age, and rich with all increase.
But now, for us, wild Winter, and the need
Of sowings for new Spring, and blood for seed. 

Married villages emptied to the call.
Young single men from well-worn towns
Changed from suits and flat caps to khaki.
They changed their hob nailed working boots
To lugging clay-sucked boots of the trenches.
They marched down roads lined with
Loving wives and girlfriends waiving.
They marched to the slaughterhouse of
Flanders fields where poppies blossomed, 
Their blood filled petals beckoning all who 
Passed by and fell to the bullet or shell.
Death clinging low to the ground. Death
Walking, sickle sweeping from side to side, 
With Death saying, 'I claim him' over and over.
August was just the beginning of hell.
Lions marching into the unknown and oblivion. 

And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping, 
With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power, 
To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping, 
Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary, 
Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move, 
And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary, 
And all the little emptiness of love! 

Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there, 
Where there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending, 
Naught broken save this body, lost but breath; 
Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there 
But only agony, and that has ending; 
And the worst friend and enemy is but Death. 

Dear! of all happy in the hour, most blest 
He who has found our hid security, 
Assured in the dark tides of the world that rest, 
And heard our word, 'Who is so safe as we?' 
We have found safety with all things undying, 
The winds, and morning, tears of men and mirth, 
The deep night, and birds singing, and clouds flying, 
And sleep, and freedom, and the autumnal earth. 
We have built a house that is not for Time's throwing. 
We have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever. 
War knows no power. Safe shall be my going, 
Secretly armed against all death's endeavour; 
Safe though all safety's lost; safe where men fall; 
And if these poor limbs die, safest of all. 

Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead! 
There's none of these so lonely and poor of old, 
But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold. 
These laid the world away; poured out the red 
Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be 
Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene, 
That men call age; and those who would have been, 
Their sons, they gave, their immortality. 

Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for our dearth, 
Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain. 
Honour has come back, as a king, to earth, 
And paid his subjects with a royal wage; 
And Nobleness walks in our ways again; 
And we have come into our heritage. 

These hearts were woven of human joys and cares, 
Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth. 
The years had given them kindness. Dawn was theirs, 
And sunset, and the colours of the earth. 
These had seen movement, and heard music; known 
Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended; 
Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone; 
Touched flowers and furs and cheeks. All this is ended. 

There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter 
And lit by the rich skies, all day. And after, 
Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance 
And wandering loveliness. He leaves a white 
Unbroken glory, a gathered radiance, 
A width, a shining peace, under the night. 

If I should die, think only this of me:
That there's some corner of a foreign field
That is for ever England. There shall be
In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,
Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,
A body of England's, breathing English air,
Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.

And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;
And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,
In hearts at peace, under an English heaven. 

I’ve watched the Seasons passing slow, so slow, 
In the fields between La Basse and Bethune; 
Primroses and the first warm day of Spring, 
Red poppy floods of June, 
August, and yellowing Autumn, so 
To Winter nights knee-deep in mud or snow, 
And you’ve been everything. 

Dear, you’ve been everything that I most lack 
In these soul-deadening trenches—pictures, books, 
Music, the quiet of an English wood, 
Beautiful comrade-looks, 
The narrow, bouldered mountain-track, 
The broad, full-bosomed ocean, green and black, 
And Peace, and all that’s good. 


The day you walked in
Stood on my door
You were nineteen
I was twenty four.
A look at your face
Weakened my knees
In your sweet fairness
I experienced bliss.
Throbbed hard my heart
My body felt so light
That spelt the start
Of my love at first sight! 
The day you walked in
There wasn't anymore
Happiness for nineteen
Peace for twenty four. 


The porchlight coming on again,
Early November, the dead leaves
Raked in piles, the wicker swing
Creaking. Across the lots
A phonograph is playing Ja-Da.

An orange moon. I see the lives
Of neighbors, mapped and marred
Like all the wars ahead, and R.
Insane, B. with his throat cut,
Fifteen years from now, in Omaha.

I did not know them then.
My airedale scratches at the door.
And I am back from seeing Milton Sills
And Doris Kenyon. Twelve years old.
The porchlight coming on again. 


All night they marched, the infantrymen under pack,
But the hands gripping the rifles were naked bone
And the hollow pits of the eyes stared, vacant and black,
When the moonlight shone.

The gas mask lay like a blot on the empty chest,
The slanting helmets were spattered with rust and mold,
But they burrowed the hill for the machine-gun nest
As they had of old.

And the guns rolled, and the tanks, but there was no sound,
Never the gasp or rustle of living men
Where the skeletons strung their wire on disputed ground . 
I knew them, then.

'It's eighteen years,' I cried. 'You must come no more.'
'We know your names. We know that you are the dead.
Must you march forever from France and the last, blind war?'

'Fool! From the next!'
they said. 


I look down upon the remains of my life, 
lying like so much meat, on a stainless steel table
covered with a three hundred and sixty thread
white Egyptian cotton sheet.
My arms cross folded across eternity; 
the smell of formaldehyde intercedes
with what seemed for the moment
like the perfect dream


in the wet city

the country's wit
is not memorable.

The wind has blown
all the trees down

but these anxieties
remain erect, being

the heart's deliberate
chambers of hurt

and fear whether
from a green apartment

seeming diamonds or
from an airliner

seeming fields. It's
not simple or tidy

though in rows of
rows and numbered;

the literal drifts
colorfully and

the hair is combed
with bridges, all

compromises leap
to stardom and lights.

If alone I am
able to love it,

the serious voices,
the panic of jobs,

it is sweet to me.
Far from burgeoning

verdure, the hard way
in this street. 


I was admiring the clean car this morning before it rained
With my newspaper in hand I paused momentarily to notice its beauty
My wife had cleaned it yesterday; from vinyl top to rubber bottom
The windows were spotless and the upholstery was polished
I even thought I heard the leather inside say "Thank the wife"-
Its grille was shiny and bright with the precision of a dentist
As I was returning to the house I was thinking about going for a drive
My wife appeared at the front door in her nightgown
There is just something special about a clean car and those hood ornaments


Then dirt scared me, because of the dirt
he had put on her face. And her training bra
scared me—the newspapers, morning and evening,
kept saying it, training bra,
as if the cups of it had been calling
the breasts up—he buried her in it,
perhaps he had never bothered to take it
off. They found her underpants
in a garbage can. And I feared the word
eczema, like my acne and like
the X in the paper which marked her body,
as if he had killed her for not being flawless.
I feared his name, Burton Abbott,
the first name that was a last name,
as if he were not someone specific.
It was nothing one could learn from his face.
His face was dull and ordinary,
it took away what I’d thought I could count on
about evil. He looked thin and lonely,
it was horrifying, he looked almost humble.
I felt awe that dirt was so impersonal,
and pity for the training bra,
pity and terror of eczema.
And I could not sit on my mother’s electric
blanket anymore, I began to have a 
fear of electricity—
the good people, the parents, were going to
fry him to death. This was what
his parents had been telling us:
Burton Abbott, Burton Abbott,
death to the person, death to the home planet.
The worst thing was to think of her,
of what it had been to be her, alive,
to be walked, alive, into that cabin,
to look into those eyes, and see the human



Swank back, 
swing arse
girls of glass.
Don't pass them
in the street, 
stilletoed feet. 
three neat, 
kohl-eyed, 
black lashed
Saturday morning spenders
for the jive dive
swinging rhyme
gin and lime, 
drink sublime
hot time
in the old town tonight.



I am going with it, 
Nineteen hundred sixty.

Going and going
With you, O my dear, and
The entire world is watching us.

What for I do not know
And you are telling me
Time and again to stop.

And I am going and going
Not to reach anywhere
But to go and go
Without any ending.

Nineteen hundred sixty
And I am going with it. 


Over a period of time

The music these musicians make seem to confuse my mind
the yardbirds told me "for your love I'd bring you diamond rings and things right to your door."
I mean as a woman what more could I ask for? 
But then the very next year
Mick Jagger said I was under his thumb
I swear that man acted as if I were dumb
the who told me they got some pictures of lily that helped them sleep at night
While women named lily were fighting for their rights
I was told by Elvis himself to cut the conversation cause he wanted a little more action
I mean we women are the greatest attraction
But, in led zeppelin said babe I'm gonna leave you
And what’s a young woman supposed to do? 
Eric Clapton said we were going to stimulate some action
I swear all men think about is satisfaction
Jim Morrison asked if you loved her madly
But, I heard no answer, must have not wanted me that badly
Neil Young said he a man needed a maid
Some men get this notion women are meant to be their slaves-
Alice Cooper said no more Mr. nice guy
But, what I’m confused about was- when was he ever nice to me? 
Lynyrd Skynyrd said if I didn’t ask questions I wouldn’t get lies-
What exactly was he trying to imply
In kiss said that they had some kind of woman whose hips they touched and she said she would let them
I wonder where exactly he found this woman
For a few years I didn’t hear too much to please my ears
babe I’m leaving- this is what the Styx said
Weird because I didn’t know those guys existed
Bruce Springsteen shouted "Hey little girlie in the blue jeans so tight"
I wouldn’t turn around because if I did I would have to put up a fight
Love at first feel-
Well I guess in acdc thought this was real
Van Halen spoke the truth in Said pretty woman was the kind they would like to meet
I guess in the police saw that the pretty woman had a ring
Duran Duran said the fatal kiss is all we need
Then in the beastie boys said girls were for the laundry 
And for their bed 
Axl rose said he had some type of use for me-
But the words he used were so degrading
Aerosmith claimed Janie had gun
You know today the music is the same
To bad Janie didn't shoot everyone-I recall the many crumpled pieces of paper
It took to complete a single thought
The noisy typewriter and the worn out erasers
Would petition me to bring an end to their plight
As I would push myself away from the desk
Trying to get some rest before morning light arrived 
The ash tray left smelling up the room with the remains
Of  a pack of cigarettes smoked down to their filters
Yellow fingers and bad breath drenched in nicotine
Were the end result of hours and hours of self examination
It was a struggle to write anything back then
Let alone something to leave behind for you to read O ano que continua. 





I was dreaming of the war the other night; 
I had returned with all of my weapons loaded
to the jungles of my misspent youth.
The helicopter size mosquitoes immediately 
recognized my malaria as their ancestral strain.
The Hyenas that had once rightly laughed 
at my naivete as a boy; weren’t laughing, 
as with forty years of experience tacked on-
to what had never really been a killer’s instinct
I was much more dangerous and less predictable.
There were still the usual tigers in fatigues 
and the starving buzzards, circling above my head
having fed on the dried out marrow of my brothers bones
they were looking for a yet another firefight, but I 
could not oblige them with a convenient kill.
I looked around for the familiar face of Death.
I sniffed the air and the putrid smell of war
had all but totally disappeared.
We who had come and conquered that jungle; 
we who had departed as soulless victors over a defoliated land
only to be decorated with shame by the hisses and boos of public opinion, 
could now be proud of our legacy


in spite of ourselves.
I was dreaming of the war the other night; it was to be
a peaceful reunion with a few of my dead friends


The things you’ve heard
The world’s death
In for the blood
Out for the pain
Drank wine and 
Unranked water
Ships sank
Ocean was dried
All this happened in  Spring! Even in the tempest on my earth
You appear with greatness in my mind and heart.
With your presence the flowers bloom in my heart; 
And the fragrance of joy spreads over my earth.

Your presence fills my mind and heart 
With the waves of ecstasy of youth.
O Spring! Srengthen the earth with your mighty power
As it suffers from the uncured diseases every hour.


After Nine month bloodshed- 
A healthy baby born on low 
laying part of the southern earth
Neo sediments overlaid on the 
footprint of bloody rustic soldier boot
Kicked off by the freedom fighter, 
my bro in the liberation WAR

Though wings were broken as if, 
Feather looms were exhausted
Baby afflicted to smile herself with 
priceless sun shines on the horizon

They demonstrated to doom young, 
Cut off my culture and raped my sister
But could not smash my 
religion and cultural sympathy, 
Plays over through rivers 
and songs by thousands of years

At the end of the day, 
the bloody had no way to move
Finally killed our pen and poets
on a winter December of But they didn't know, 
'War depends on moral courage'
I am the poet to say some 
nuclear words for that bloody swain

Dark covered the horizon, 
an endless misery of my mother
So my bro in arms and I am the
poet wait for the win in vain

Revenge takes my bro as if my 
RED songs are singing sonorous thee
My baby should be free; 
free very soon, new sun will appear-  
On a green paper written by
my bro with ink of blood

~~

to what he is
from anything else

of life
his notions
emotions

Can a few garbled words
of unshapen thoughts
inked on paper
carve the way
for the rest of his days

Can a teen's painted mind
a treasure finds
that he holds on
making him alone
but rich in loneliness
never craving to possess
but embrace
what's his destined
a love a heart
but when goes past
never breaches his trust

Can a year make a man
what he would be
the rest of his life
when he inked on paper
his first poem
that to this date
shapes his fate
keeps him free.

Did all these the year

 

By this river side
In an wintry afternoon
You met me for the last time
Seventeen years ago.

Even today I can't forget 
The precious moments.
Holding my hands
You were crying again and again
And saying, ' Don't mind, my darling! 
I am very very sorry 
Not to keep the promise once I made.'

From your eyes 
Tears were rolling down
Like the showers of rain
And glowing like pearls
In the wintry golden sun.

The restless cold wind
Was troubling your long dark hair.
The waves of the river 
Were blowing the shore
As if they could know
It was our last meeting.

I know very well
We can no longer meet each other
In this mundane world.
But human mind follows no logic.
It tells me to come here once more.
So with a full hearted hope
I have come here once again
Expecting only to meet you
In this wintry golden sun.



Liberty, who’s gonna’ ask
You in from

This one? Walk on, it’s
Only human, you’ve been
Thru that, accepted it, 

Right?  Sorta’ like that vacuum
That swells between your 
Skull & head after

A one-night stand with everything. 

Every happy memory, 
Every successful moment, 
Every fulfilled dream, 
Every joyful second
Whatever I have
I want to give you.

You can store them
In the corridor of your heart, 
In the drawer of your memory, 
In the cells of your mind - 
Wherever and however 
You may want to do.

Knowing everything
I want to give you them.
As at least
They must be alive
With your soft touch, 
With your warm love.


And that I’m proud? 
Do you like to see me smile, 
And not drown in my tears? 

Do you care if I am sad, 
Or that I feel alone? 
Do you mind if I suddenly cry, 
Or if I hide in a secret place? 

Do you care if I get lonely, 
And that I feel abandoned? 
Do you think that you should help, 
Or if you should just stay away? 

Do you care if I get mad, 
Or if I throw a fit? 
Do you feel like I do sometimes, 
Do you understand my heart? 

So, now I ask you before I go, 
Do you care? 
About me

Glass heart
fragile and frail
beautiful and naive
do you fear to fall
to break forever? 
 
Glass heart
fragile and frail 
beautiful and naive
do you fear the hammer
that will break you forever? 
 
Glass heart
fragile and frail
beautiful and naive
do you dread the cold 
that could break you forever? 
 
Glass heart
fragile and frail
beautiful and naive
together we'll face the fear
and break forever. . 

Could you give me some sign
that your faith in me is strong? 
Your voice is all I hear
your language is all I understand
My heart is your servant
my soul is your slave
My world is yours to control
try to make it beautiful. 

Last night I had a scare
and woke up finding it reality
That your beautiful warmth
is not with me anymore.

I long for the air to take shape
and somehow bring you here-
that way my mind could relax
and my tears could in someway fade.

I know I'll be with you again
but the days without you terrify me
and even though this will soon be over
I dread the coldness in my bed.

You must remember
Tomorrow is the first of December
It is time to start thinking 
Of your new year resolutions
Avoid unnecessary temptations
Prevention is better than finding solutions

Give up the cigarette
Forget the day you first met

Give to the poor
Not after but before

Greet the elderly
With respect very carefully

Think of positive change
It is always there at close range

Give up the booze
It only stinks of ooze

Set aside time to pray
Set aside time to play
If you have to
Why not change your ways

Tomorrow is the first of December
Remember, a new beginning 
Is always the way forward to winning

Miles of sand and stone. A sight alone.
Mountains of mist. Alone I list.
The sights I see. Only me.
With no other. None to call brother.

Sounds I hear. Far and near.
Coming closer. To my Mimosa.
Who's there? who's anywhere? 
Where am I? Where is the sky? 

Show yourself. You elusive elf.
Don't look too much. Don't even touch.
Her looks are yellow. But she won't say hello.
You are not matter. So I should know you better.

Your energy. Says you are not an enemy.
So why now? What purpose does your presence allow? 
Hurry Summarrie. Oh where could that lone star be? 
Come shine. Your light on this heart of mine.

And now I see. I trust you are here for a reason.
Great things to come of me. Now is your season.
Subbtle stranger. My world is about to begin.
Will your coming bring me danger? I sense the answer from within.

It's time. No please wait! 
Ten; nine. . 

Eight.
Seven; six; five. Four; Three.
I'm almost alive. Do come with me. 

falling back to am
when the walls come down

Put your right hand under your left arm pit, 
And flap your arm up and down just a bit.
It will sound just like you are breaking wind, 
So take what you learn and go show a friend! 
Try it in class, teach it to your teachers, 
Do it as you run up and down bleachers. 
Right smack dab in the middle of dinner, 
Make your guests laugh with this sure fired winner, 
And if they should happen to scream or squeal, 
Explain to them that the poot wasn't real! 
With practice you'll soon get the hang of it. 

Put your right hand under your left arm pit

In the concrete jungle, where drugs slang to maintain the bloody crane
Their lives always been this way, always looking over their shoulder 
The dried tears washed away with blood from the most potent culture 
The concrete jungle feeds off blood, the people are use to seeing torture
That’s why our bodies flood in the mud that’s been their lives 
The ammo their gun holds, their caliber
Seems more important to them than learning their algebra
It’s all about street smarts, survival, and loyalty from their live crew
When the wind blew what unravel was no one that were fake 
Real people live life on the corner, surrounding them is killers at their wake

The reader from afar opens a book of a tragedy, the truth in the streets 
As he opens the book, he could hear his heart beat rumbling like clapping feet

L-Dub was his name, he lived on the streets, and he was deep in the crack game
All it gave him was lack of mental power and emotional pain
But he had peers alongside him; he didn’t know such thing as fear 
They hosted a block party alongside him, only a few cars could enter
Music was loud and it was crowded, barbecue was fed drugs at the rear
Lastly gambling in the back of the shack where L-Dub rest at
In the back, Frank was mad he was losing his bank in the card game 
He felt like a lame drinking all night, was no closer to fame 
Enraged he left tumble on his self got the gun and starting slinging 
Most people had a gun at the party and started reaching 
The killer let off most people jet off in sight of bullet fire
Police were waiting nearby for something to set off 
L-Dub duck and slid hoping he wouldn’t get spotted 
Jake his best friend was shot his body quickly rotted
The shooter tried to dip in the bushes while he was fatigued 
L-Dub had a desert eagle on standby; when he drew it he let the bullets leave the barrel
Frank fell to his knee’s the drunken spree was over 
But L-Dub wouldn’t let his friend death go though 
He killed Frank; his friends picked him up before cops came
Frank died of internal bleeding; L-Dub never got a chance to flee 
He died two weeks later-he couldn’t even read- he was only fifteensitting here in this lonely room
with nothing above my head but gloom
saddness weighs heavy again on my shoulders
it weighs down upon my life like sand beneath a bolder
with suicide not a contemplation 
but a plotted out destination
will the after life be a permanent vacation
or will it be an eternal damned nation
is death nothing but you getting ready to return
is it sitting in heaven or going beneath the earth to burn
only those who have seen my fate have learned
i think im waiting for my eternal sleep
but i do believe in that man called death
because around every corner i here him creep
and when im alone i feel his every breath
i know he is a man because a woman couldnt be so cruel
so with this razor or with this gun i challenge him to a duel
i stare him down from head to floor
then i realize, ive seen this man before
pace for pace and place to place
i know this man because im stareing at myself in the mirror face to face


Even if the mountain I climbed
Proved to be merely a duncecap It
was only on gaining its peak 
That that knowledge reached me.

Is there a single inch-- 
one square millimeter 
on the face of our planet 
which some animal 
human or otherwise 
has not shit on?

Is there anywhere even a
pore's-worth of ground--
earth that has never 
(not once in its eons) 
been covered by what 
golgotha of dung?

If such a place exists, 
I want to go there 
and stand there 
at that site 
in that spot, truly
and purely for an instant.

mahogany’s deathhearts may remain as one, 
heart is yours, 
The other is mine, 
I once gave you all my love, 
You took and tore it apart, 
You made me look like a fool, 
I am losing my grip, 
I just wanna rip you throat out, 
Yet I don't want to, 
Don't wanna make a mess out of this, 
You ain't worth my time for, 
Bits and pieces of me fading away, 
Losing my time and space, 
Don't know where to turn to, 
hearts remain as one, 
That's was us just single hearts that are in love, 
Yet you don't see it, 
I lay myself down, 
Down to sleep, 
Waking myself up from this place of lost dreams and hope. 

Twist a knife in a heart
Pull the trigger with one finger
And you have committed a sin
But there are more terrible things
Not only with our hands we kill a rose
There is another kind of murder
That goes unpaid maybe worst
It was envy and jealousy
That sucked the love out of an angel
And tuned him to an evil demon
It takes one bad apple to spoil a few
It takes betray and deceit
One sour taste of love
Is all it takes, to kill a rose
It's also a form of murder! 

Please note I am a writer not a murderer
I dont kill, so please

August.  



On her course merrily flows the svelte rivulet
She meanders not alone carries the sky on her breast.
In him grows a longing, love flowers in his heart
She doesn’t know it, on the sea is set her heart.
The two flows embraced in unrequited passion
The sky ferries his lover to her beloved ocean.

'Beauty is so powerful, 
it evens affects 
those who can´t perceive it'.

A masterpiece of safety, 
useless beauty in his eyes. 

A made-to measure armor
where life is safe
and pain and joy can´t exist.

And yet crazy tigers still go hunting.
They could drink all the blood
and keep on hungering.

So much wasted talent. 

What´s left? 

Another  game of chess
where geometry rules
and there is always space
to push pawns ahead
and play winning end-games.

I also want to be
a minister
of death. 

this popup
jumps up on me 
most unexpectedly
with a  BOO! and a Hee! Hee! Hee! 
(which is what, I guess, 
popups do best)      


you see, 
all I’m doing is minding my own business
punching keys on my keyboard 
(which is what idiots like me do best)      
and this popup
shows up and says: 
Hey bald and sexy –
point that mouse at me and click! 
Come, let me show you how low 
your IQ really is! 



Oh, please - popup, 
don’t pop up on me
cos I’ve got a weak heart
and I may just go POOOP! 
like a bubble
just like that; 
besides, 
I’m really quite dumb
and I can’t see

A bomb blasted in the train
Many people lost their life 
A little boy orphaned 
Cried: Why only my parents
? 

Tsunami flooded the shore
Many coast submerged
The beachside family reported missing
Kinfolk grieved: Why only my family
? 

Earthquake battered the town
Complete population grounded
The victims unheard petition  
Resounded: Why only our zone
? 

A blind baby delivered
Of beautiful parents
The mother could not stop her tears
Lamented: Why only my child
? 

The entry ticket to this world
Is marked with obnoxious barb 
Adversity nurses the virtue of man
But why in such appalling garb

Once together, now apart
One still with a broken heart.
One saying it will never be; 
The other fighting reality.
One looking ahead to another day; 
The other looking for a different way.
One moving on with life at last; 
The other still stuck in the past.
One with prospects full of hope; 
The other desperately trying to cope.
One with no reason to wilt; 
The other feeling burdened by guilt.
One with reason to feel so high; 
The other with reason only to cry.
One with smiles on her face; 
The other with loneliness in joy's place.
One seems so together from the start; 
The other's life is falling apart.
One stands tall, strong, and proud; 
The other's old self has been wrapped in a shroud.
One stands there, content with life; 
The other deals with sadness and strife.
One is standing where happiness reigns; 
The other's company is only her pain.
Two different sides, two different friends; 
Two different people on opposite ends.
Two different outcomes from one event; 
To a different path each person went. 

If I could remember
what I am looking for, 
I would stop
and take a rest. 

Two walks at the park
Leisure strolls on her ground
Watching squirrels on tree bark
Before I turn homebound.
Today while passing along
On them my eyes fell
One in a bush alone
A little away another squirrel.
I wondered in my funny caprice
If they have ever had a chance
To exchange warmth and good wish
Or they haven’t met even once.
A little more daring in my whim
I thought the distance for them too far
So she roamed alone dreaming of him
And he unknowing forever seeks her.

'Till I'm Blind


did you open the door
or did I leave it open? 

How could you know? 
There were blinds 
on the windows 
and yet you knew 
that was the first snow 
of a long winter, 
"it´s a clear winter morning, 
let´s go and enjoy the snow".

You knew 
when to touch my hand
to tell me 
life is waiting 
let´s go play.

You knew 
the best definition 
for happiness. 
Open your eyes and enjoy.
Let´s go play.

You knew 
the exact measure 
of truth, 
of danger.

The secret 
must be 
the smell. 

Peripheral battle lines  
are secretly drawn  
resetting, directing  
wine breathed pawns. 

Mathematically strategized goals. 
Sentinels call out moves and hours. 
Foot soldiers advance toward 
opposing sides to the h power. 

Alternating flag flown  
on white and dark tower. 
Quartered unmanned horses  
roam to the h power. 

Royalty safely guarded and hid 
behind rock walls tiered flowers. 
Domination of linear spaced 
cubic grid to the h power. 

Coveted royal crowns  
and squares delicately paced  
by clerics cloned and robed  
bound on diagonal straights. 

Ranks one through eight  
attacking in combination.  
Bishop skewer,   
Knight fork,   
Castle pin,   

Checkmate!   

Forces resignation. 

At first I didn´t realize your hair was dyed
I hadn´t noticed your long legs, your longer heels, 
and your poor taste in choosing the tightest jeans. 

So many were called and so few were chosen,  
the  pattern was "tall rich empty headed, a good trophy"
no doubt a winner in the rat race. 

The clinking clanking of high heels
in high school corridors 
filled so much empty space

so many heads to turn   
so many victories ahead 
and then why feel you are nothing 
unless your credit card depletes

where is the dream? what is the need? 
dumbells raised in the sweatiest gyms
what ever happened to the ugly duck 
turned beast

a tiny voice
(in a not so tiny night) 

"er-hello? "

SILENCE
(as expansive as the darkness of night) 

a braver voice
(in a night where brave knights fly) 

"anybody out there? anybody at all? 
for I’ve heard tell of a 
a Yahweh
a Higher Power
an Omnipotent Force
and I’d like to know what’s out there"

I AM
(heard in places with no ears attached) 

"you are what? "

I AM THE BEGINNING & THE 

CREATOR & DESTROYER
I KNOW ALL & SEE ALL
I AM IN EVERY TEAR DROP
& EVERY LAUGH; 
IN EVERY HEART & MIND
I HAVE BEEN, AM, & WILL BE FOR EVER MORE
CALL ME WHAT YOU WILL, 
I AM I

a voice begins, falters
trying to reach out into the great wilderness of sky
looking for this "I" 
and what name shall be given?

"I understand

humans questioning and proclaiming and praising

we persist.

as life rafts in a sea of lost souls
we kill for our faith

but know I know
call it what we may, there is only one truth
Yahweh

that elusive, immense, & powerful
"I AM I"
and I shall question no longer

Who can understand 
what we feel inside 
When we gaze into the eyes 
of the shadows 
To which we subscribe as members
Of this dark and lonely world 

Constantly turning round 
while friction builds 
Like rats in a tool shed 
we die and are replaced 
Never again to taste the bait 
that lured us to our fate 
Before we found the words and will to save 
this dark and lonely world 

Described as truth by one man 
questioned and doubted by others 
Remembered in short 
by no one 
The deeds of mankind are 
shadows to us all 
Whose eyes we capture
upon the walls 
While searching for our place in this 
dark and lonely world 

Held empty in meaning and 
failing to comprehend 
We play the game to its end 
 we're always trying to win 
Salvation for ourselves 
while the world 
goes on dancing 
and picture postcards sell 
The meaning of a life 
to which we subscribe 
As members of those shadows 
in a dark and lonely world 
And somehow we do manage to survive 
and somehow we do manage to surmise 

What lies behind those eyes
Fatalistically speaking of course. .. 

At Boron, California one year 
We stopped on vacation to see
The Mule Team Borax museum
It was truly fascinating to me.

I remembered the ads on TV long ago
With mules and a wagon hitched to them
Memories of using Borax soap as a kid
Wow, what a wonderful museum. 

Mother-tongue-
  
  . 

Sometimes I wonder if you feel it; 
the residue of the love we shared
that's left in your bed; 
if its fingers go through your body
and taunt you-distorting your dreams
like it does to me. 

Every night when I lay
I feel you next to me; 
your essence sleeping with me, 
driving me mad with the lonliness it creates; 
going through my very being while I dream, 
twisting and turning my soul in half
until I wake up in a phsycotic state, 
screaming for this nightmare to end. 

Do you ever feel it? 
Am I the only victim in this horrid game, 
or do you sometimes long for the love we had
like I do every day.  

Je ne pense pas au Trepas, mais le Trepas pense a moi.
Il s'adosse dans son fauteuil, se frotte les mains, caresse
Sa barbe en disant, ' Je pense a M. Strand, je pense
Qu'un de ces jours je serai de retour, en brandissant ma faux
Ou en tenant mon sablier en haut a la lune, et M. Strand se montrera
Vetu d'une veste et une cravate, nous nous promenerons
Ensemble sous les arbres sans feuilles du boulevard
Nous flanerons dans la ville des ames. Et quand
Nous arriverons a la Grande Piazza aux chateaux de marbre, la foule
Qui avait attendu la, nous souhaitera la bienvenue aux cris delirants, 
Et leurs larmes, tournees dures et froides comme le verre a cause D'etre retenues si longtemps, vont tomber, en claquant sur les pierres au-dessous.

Goodbye Two Thousand and Four, 
Bombs, disaster and war.

Welcome  
Grant love and peace shall thrive. 

Darkened spaces filled with heated bodies
only you are aglow amist the shadowed forms
your language flowing through me like a breeze
sparking vacancies I believed had long since dissapeared

Could you ever see in me sweet inspiration
the type that caresses you in humble sleep
Could I ever be someone you can love
a best friend, confidant, and source of comfort

I want my words to fit your melodies
and form new worlds only passion can create
I wish my lyrics would be granted access
to your hidden solice of chords and rhythms

Dreams colored in minors and flats
your music filling my lonely sphears
though my wishes of our combining are forever damned
as you fade away on my vacant stage.will be bright because I know my redeemer lives.  Its the thing I can hang onto.  He smiles at me and loves me.


will be bright.  Because I will stop munching on potato chips and krispy cremes.

I'll start treating myself better physically, emotionally, intellectually, socially

I will keep my house beautiful because its my mansion. 




Out with the old 
Ring in the new
It's coming to a close
Change is overdue
I'm feeling restless
Nowhere to go
How quickly a year strips
of all that you know? 
I look back on it now
what I thought I was
A woman coming into her own
steps so sure, without pause
Made a few friends
and thought I was good
A new definition in life
what I wanted, understood

Didn't care to 
keep my nose clean
Didn't forsee 
what losing really means

looks out for people like me
never too much to handle
this of which I was worry-free
Such a glorious thought! 
but never in my wildest dreams
Would I come to watch
my world tear at the seams. 


I'm not impressed.
Mom's now in heaven
My marriage in distress
I can't keep holding on
for what would I get? 
Frustrated for what's now gone
and a year full of regret

So I ring in the new year
Clean slate from the old
And although my path is not clear
the next right thing will be told
I've gotta come out of
this depressing little shell
My intentions for is to break from this living hell
Seems so simple just
to write it out on paper, ya know? 
If I do the right things
I can later reap what I sow? 
Then what the hell
was for? 
For me to just shake my head, 
turn away from, and close the door? 

Out of my rooms
of tales of woe
were people of courage
and who I've come to know. 

looking out for people like me
not giving too much to handle. 
Bullshit, times three.
Such a moronic thought! 
but never would I believe
that in was the year
He tried to get His message.  
To me.


It's me you're not defeating.
Mom may be in heaven
but I'm done retreating
I've held on for so long
for fear of losing out
Only to realize I've given
events of too much clout.

So I pray that I get to eat my words
Of what it was in that made it for the birds
I wish all of you 
your own clean slate too
To make your happy, 
the year that can change YOU.


Lee Degnan, c.ou wouldn’t believe the regalia
So bright with feathers and beads
Adorning their beautiful dresses
There were all the necessary needs

There were women of all ages ready
To perform with style and grace
Excitement steadily building
Smiles of expectancy on each face

Such careful consideration
And perfection of ancient tradition
Honoring their ancestors
So many important positions

The jewelry is so incredible 
Rings and necklaces and such
Many places they can be purchased
We all love them so very much

And the men in their headdresses 
Were so handsome with enormous flair
They looked so important, I’ll tell you
With much perfection and care

So if you come to town, folks
You’ll truly be glad that you stayed
To watch the yearly excitement

I walk through an open door
the scent of tears and despair filling my lungs
visions of those in my past are waiting in the Foyer
the one who brought me here holding my arm

I didn't think I'd be back here so soon; 
the place I'd been living for so many years..
Thought I'd finally found my exit out
believed I was at last free of these painful restraints..

Lights are flickering softly from hundreds of candles
names of the fallen carved into their soft skins
reddened eyes look around the familiar scene..

My Joy is checked in
My Sorrow is wrapped in satin and placed in my arms
My Soul is shoved back into its deadly cell

I look at the one who's deceived me
and led me back to the steps of my hell
As the Mistress comes and leads me once more to my barren room
I shed a tear while I quietly cry out why.  

Today I will welcome two thousand nine.
I've gotten in no trouble.  I've done no crime.

I've cleaned up my act now.  this is the third year. 
.  

I've been blesses with goodness and shed fewer tears.

to start fresh and let this new chapter erase. 

.  

the damage I may have done though minimum.
I have to admit that last year was real fun.

But off to a new year we today do start.
Goodbye two thousand eight; last year we do part.

Mantes-la-Jolie - yes, the sub-prefecture 
of Mantes-la-Jolie is singing to me 

Considering the Act on Contract of Association 
and Article Three of the Decree when members 
agree and authorisation is given by the authority 

Given freedom of association and authority of the 
administration to act on its registration concluding 
contracts between all adherents - possibly 

With theoretical comments on the legislation, leeway 
for interpretation and happy interaction between 
everybody – who wrote the song of the law 

Who will sing with me in the sweet sounds of the 
sub-prefecture of Mantes-la-Jolie - yes, the 
sub-prefecture of Mantes-la-Jolie 

Is singing to me-Alice was wandering forlornly through Dr 
Anabela Cardoso’s laboratory when Time-
stream Station turned on and Konstantin 
Raudive’s raucous voice announced jo-
vially that the demonic voice heard by 
Mark Macy was in fact not him 

But the voice of a harlequin posing as an 
astral spirit, while he really was an inhabi-
tant of the ethereal realms, not dangerous 
at all, merely making a call to find out 
whether there was an entity out there 
that would love him as much as 

when she forgive him for threatening her 
beloved Comte; Alice looked up, interes-
ted, and offered to talk to the poor ethe-
real consciousness who longed to find 
out how it felt to be loved 

Suddenly a frightful apparition stood in front 
of Alice, but she shut her eyes and felt his 
forlorn condition through extrasensory per-
ception, she took him by the hand and led 
him to her Wonderland where complete 
freedom and unconditional love 

Filled the spirit of every visitor, the ethereal 
apparition fell down, struck by the wonderful 
atmosphere, declared he had never been a 
happy consciousness and now his electronic 
energy was filled with so much joy, he wanted 
to have fun - and laugh and sing and run!

Wordsmith’s word of the day, salmagundi
triggered a heterogeneous mixture of as-
sociations for me, Anastasia’s assassin, 
‘Sal Monella’ who killed her aunt 

The refrain of the only song I know in Arabic 
SALMA-y-salaamah - we came, we went -
Sal MAGUNDI sounds like ANA-y-a MA-
KUNTI ba-fa-karaki-ha-hu-shas-al-y-ama* 

But not a mixed salad, should I offer my family 
a salmagundi I would receive a salvo of clever 
repartees, even the word smorgasbord would 
be received with great suspicion


*Song sung by Dalida


When silence descends
only a thin line of events 
lighting up emptiness -
my mind switches back 
to the wavelength behind
the physical world 

The atmosphere becomes 
overpowering as the world  
shrinks to one shiny point-
when I put the book down 
nothing is left, only black-
ness covering everything

I like the experience of the 
third stream, background 
consciousness - enduring 
when the senses, the first 
defence against the inner 
world, are gone


Then the whole Spiel disintegrated into a 
‘synthesized global spirituality’ where each 
religion supplements the others – a utopia
that sounds so boring - and worse

James Redfield’s literal interpretation of 
Biblical vision with all religions and secular 
idealism coming together in a grand temple 
in Jerusalem - a vision of world peace 

represents the flattest, one-dimensional, 
undifferentiated picture, no excitement in 
conflict and argument to lead to new con-
sensus - just one big loving feeling 

No way, earth could never become so tame, 
seekers of world peace will have to create it 
in other spheres, earth is meant for drama, 
intrigue - even when my heart is pierced 

Even when champagne stops fizzling in my 
veins in resigned acceptance of a way of life 
that compresses the mind into the smallest 
space, the world is a much too adventurous, 

exciting place to be run by the sweet, no-conflict, 
all-loving vision, dissonance must provide a back-
ground for harmony, it is great to hate in frustration 
in order to see the difference between 

love and rejection - I cannot imagine a peaceful 
earth, this physical dimension is meant for valour, 
war and challenge and fighting and victory – not 
for smiling blankly in some kind of nirvana 

Those are peak moments only, let them go, they are 
reserved for the non-physical dimensions where red-
blooded, hot-headed conflict-loving humans cannot 
go! We are not ready for that yet! 


"The Tenth Insight" James Redfield – Bantam Book 
 quoted from p oes James Redfield’s vision enlarge the imagination - 
definitely, it offers an alternative view, energetic and 
refreshing, I enjoy his lyrical descriptions, but resent 
his forcing HIS view of world peace on us

All other views encompassed by his delineation of 
history as evolution towards consciousness whereas 
I believe consciousness came first, made the plans, 
laid the blueprint; convinced the universe is filled 

With higher forms of intelligence than humans; his view 
is restrictive, yet he subsumes everything, though bigger 
than materialism, it is a local vision not taking millions of 
alternative life-forms into account

He reinstates mystery, but it is localised, limited to planet 
earth and one Afterlife, he wants all fighting groups to start 
discussing their life and views – it will not work because he

He fills the contemporary Western view of human history with 
Eastern mysticism and calls it a new World Vision-

Feeling alone and bereft with only James Redfield 
and Frances Hodgson Burnett for company, I turned 
to Goscinny and Uderzo for light relief, what a joy, 
Asterix and Obelix on their adventures

Yet I felt aloof until one of Uderzo’s masterpieces 
awakened the old deep-seated sense of wonder with 
his depiction of a Greek slave posing as the ‘Discus 
Thrower’ until he is attacked by Asterix 

In the next picture he joins the rest of humanity as a 
shivering, inelegant, shocked human being, toes and 
fingers splayed, face contorted, neck and body deformed, 
hair standing on end 

We read Asterix as children and the same sense of fun 
lightened my heart, time rolled back and I laughed till tears 
streamed down my face, how hilarious when classical grace 
is replaced by existential emotions like shock and fear

I hold these Asterix books very dear, a saviour whenever life 
becomes overwhelming, a tonic, a total delight! 


"Les Lauriers de Cesar – Une Aventure d’Asterix le Gaulois" 
Text de Goscinny, Dessins de Uderzo, Dargaud Editeur Pictures on p he most beautiful sunrise: clouds soft grey 
obscuring the sun, suddenly a pinkish hue 
indicating the sun breaking through, lighting 
fiery coals everywhere, changing the sky 
to the most magnificent enchanting blue

How to describe a translucent luminescence
iridescent, opalescent, sublime, descriptive 
words depicting the scene is all that is left 
no picture or photograph can capture the 
feelings evoked by this scene

The colours seem wrong when recalled, the 
vibrancy can only exist in real life, becomes 
psychedelic when retained beyond their one 
glorious moment in time, a fabulous moment
never to be recreated 

Burning coals in the sky are too garish to be 
retained permanently, though the sacred 
memory lives on in the mind-Junior was lucky tonight, I could scarcely eat a bite 
of the meat I prepared, Scotch fillet, I never tried my 
hand at that, your new red pan did not help, it did not 
taste nice, I fed my dinner to the cat and our Jack 
Russel known as Junior 

I warmed sweet potato from last night and watched ‘Agent 
Cody Banks’ with Tiaan and Nici, a story reworking James 
Bond - ending in the same way, lovely - Romeo and Juliet -
read Paul Twitchell claiming that ‘Imagination is of little use’* 
and I laughed for the irony 

If I had no imagination I would never have read Twitchell’s 
"Spiritual Notebook" - he claims ‘Existence is a reality state 
separated from the imagination to become a consciousness
requiring SELF-consciousness; a private individual universe
to be kept for ourselves’* 

His words echoing Margaret Evening saying ‘There needs to be 
a way no human friend can be because all else is dangerous - 
our security is only ever found in Him as He appears within our- 

I just smiled coming across this synchronicity, I am sure James 
Redfield would approve as I am following my instincts such as 
he recommends in ‘The Celestine Prophecy’ - working hard at 
keeping my feelings to myself - crying secretly because my 
twin sister, father and mother 

Are too far removed to visit freely- convinced I remember my ‘Birth 
Vision’ à la Redfield; ***  that I myself chose my parents and siblings
especially my twin sis - to prepare for my mission of spreading the 
message that the universe lives IN us, not the other way round: 
we do not inhabit external reality

Everything is illusion, best understood through stories and plays, 
books, movies and TV screens, in other words, the much-
maligned IMAGINATION - I am happy with that, though 
I cry for loss of family-

An invisible string to thread my small crystal 
beads, even Tiaan helping because I cannot 
see to do it myself, it would take me a hundred 
years at least to complete one string

I wanted to make many strings to represent my 
vision of auric light shining out, but after an epic 
struggle I gave up and upended the beads in 
crystal glasses to enjoy the pristine shine 

Without destroying my eyes, Tiaan commenting 
‘After suffering for many years to string beads, I 
found the solution, dumping beads everywhere’ 
and I laughed, Nici only shaking her head  

While busy with her bead-making craft - I also love 
the effect of beads in sea-shells, resembling coarse 
salt but with a new shine, no more threading for me
I cannot see, it felt too much like torture

My new system brings us miniature rainbows with-
out the heartache of threading invisible strings 
with translucent beads

Nicolas Shrady; sceptic on a pilgrimage, 
following holy trails to religious shrines, 
seeking the spiritual within the physical – 
realising he was ‘an outsider, a passive 
observer, and always would be’ 
 
Saw artificial attempts to impress, had to 
be content with only meditation, could not 
simulate false piety, couldn’t find what he 
doesn’t already believe 
 
Observation proved fickle – symbolical 
content depends on already present belief, 
tried ceremonies, followed customs, found 
faith had no roots in anything substantial  
 
Supernatural events happen to believers 
only, which the five senses abjure, faithless 
see nothing; he enjoyed a fabulous spiritual
journey, made  friends, 
 
Learned to appreciate wonder and beauty of 
innocence, trust in the human heart, but  the 
ability of the believer to make things true 
which a sceptic can never see taught him

pause, enough sobbing and wiping of tears

olden days, making Alice think fondly of

emotional French with amorous activities 
thematic, nudity in slap-stick comedy, a striking 
contrast to American presentation.  

.  

where Charlie’s Angels were perfectly 
groomed Californian actors created flowing, 
flawlessly bland internationalist epitomes of 
excessive hair-style and lip-glossed 
fashionable glamour 

Being passionate I compare different 
temperaments,  play a cool disciplinarian 
role at home & work where German 
efficiency reigns, 

sometimes I think I have lost my soul-This must mean you have reached adult manhood 
the way you have perfected the poker face, when you 
announced Mom, I did bad at school; I saw a dead-
pan expression of despair in your eyes, mirroring 
the lacklustre lines around your father’s mouth, my 
spirits sagged – until you pressed the report into 
my unwilling hands and I exclaimed This is not bad 
at all, quite the contrary! guffaws of laughter rang 
out, shining eyes of father and son eclipsing the sun; 
you are a perfect Sphinx, my son, the mark of the 
cool, detached, grown man – well done

Mistakenly thought I had done my best, and I was 
wrong, boy was I wrong, I cannot blame anyone 
but myself for failing again, M Scott Peck wrote in 
his book "Road Less Travelled" that impatience is 
childish and irrational, an indication that a person 
cannot postpone his need to feel fulfilled - like an 
adult should

If I were not so impatient I would have printed my as-
sessment, carefully studied it, comparing, changing 
and improving, note subtle nuances, the only function 
my life and job have is discovering my shortcomings, 
I have not started addressing them yet, only learning 
how far from average I am, have yet to reach the 
height of mediocre

I am simply the most incompetent, no control over 
temperament, the world is perfect, colleagues are 
brilliant  - their ethics impeccable – yet I cannot even 
begin to emulate them, the fight for meaning in life 
is too painful to continue and win, life per se is 
meaningless, senseless, only spiritual truth 
has any value

But it is not possible to withdraw and search for 
answers, too afraid of hunger and suffering to 
follow the example of swami’s and holy men 
prostrate on nails, walking over hot coals 
without burning; maybe after this life in 
the cycle of reincarnation, my spirit 
will be better equipped 

To deal with the material world-Something so unspeakably dreadful happened 
all circuits started closing down - only the pain 
remains, the desire to flee is all that is left, the 
shock too big to process at once, all attempts 
to soften the blow just prolong the after-effects 

Thoughts circling each other, whirlwinds twirling 
aimlessly, screeching accusations, laming the 
short-circuited brain, the moment of shock frozen 
in time, no movement away from the trauma, no 
description, impossible to formulate feelings

At first I fought back by trying to go on as before, 
talking, laughing and smiling, my power ebbing 
away until my brain was numb, finally I sought 
refuge in the only place of safety, the library, 
only children’s books to cushion my mind

To stop the mad spirals of pain from increasing 
in power and inflicting more damage, physical 
pain does not stop the emotional suffering, now
is the time to stop playing a game and sink into 
the darkness to reach the end of the tunnel 

This slow descent is maddening, trying to pretend 
nothing is wrong is impossible, I cannot escape the 
pain, I cannot continue the fight, need respite, albeit
temporary, I need to feel some sort of shore before 
I can continue to do what is required-I want you decked out in beautiful clothes, made 
feel warm and comfortable, sung sweet songs of 
spring’s promise; I’ve already told you that the 
machines’ assertive beeping is singing songs of 
hope and love and life 
 
I want your hair brushed until it glows, your nails 
so finely formed painted in your favourite colour, 
your eyes bright and happy while you luxuriate in 
a gaily decorated bed, I want your delight in 
those flamboyant new pyjamas
 
I want you enjoying your new bedroom slippers, 
hear you shouting at the dog, explaining your job 
to your younger sister, calling for me to bring 
you a treat, hearing your dad laughing, teasing  
and joking with you 
 
I want to take out the new soap and cream so you 
can smell its perfume - knowing everything is okay, 
you will be fine, your dad’s in charge, love shines 
in the nurses’ smiles, everything’s under control, 
we love you, love is holding onto you
 
We’re here for you, rest in our love, at midnight 
after the accident your friends rushed to discover 
your whereabouts, called us to be at your side when 
you woke – an emergency room bag is packed 
to dress and pamper you 
 
I want to dry your tears and hold you tight until you 
are well enough to get up and tackle life in your own 
way, watching your dad watching you with 
delight, everything is alright, everything 
is so, so alright

Installed next to your bed with Nici and 
the fairies to keep magic vigil, the big bay 
windows aglow with silver and dove-grey 
clouds almost purpled against a sapphire 
sun-drenched sky 
 
Machines flash sentinel duties above your 
head, webs of tubes and cords writhe from 
them, measuring, monitoring your every 
breath, feeding oxygen, sugar, colourless 
fluids and morphine 
 
into drips attached to your wrist, already 
black and blue from frequent piercing, 
you sleep breathing deeply after everyone 
came to say hello, your guardian angel 
Nici holding you softly, shaking her head 
 
at me and my fairies – I know she’s 
the main fairy to visit you-Your stuffed bulldog tinkles, his green and 
red bow repeats colours of  your flowers – 
a high-fashion magazine in hand; you are 
already eating, we may bring sweet treats  
you said immediately, condensed milk and 
cookies, then fell asleep 

 
Overjoyed I report finishing my document 
before coming to see you, the pastor there 
too, prayed for your health, reaffirmed our 
faith –we cannot do anything now except 
wait and pray you regain your strength, I 
pasted stickers of fishes on your glory box
 
You asked me whether Nico was fine and 
I truthfully replied he was sleeping, which 
he is, with the angels; do not worry about 
anything, just smile at me again


The cosmos splits into parallel universes 
in which all conceivable outcomes of all 
events take place; the universe is a part 
of a larger multiverse 

Quantum mechanics equations say 
the cosmos exists in different states 
simultaneously, superposition states 
collapse into a single state 

Electrons and photons remain in super-
position states, yet large objects do not 
explained in Schrödinger's cat experi-
ment, a vial of poison breaking open 

When a radioactive atom decays in a 
sealed box - all in superposition states: 
decayed & not decayed, broken & un-
broken, dead and alive at the same time

The entire Universe exists in superposition 
states that leak away to leave what we see, 
there is a ‘volume of space’ containing all 
information in the universe 

And all things with which the universe will 
interact in the future - a causal patch’ region – 
our universe is one causal patch among many 
- a cosmos of differing regions 

Inside a big multiverse, information leaking 
from our causal patch into others, our universe 
decoheres into the state we observe, Bousso and 
Susskind thus explains the -

Many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, the 
cosmos splits into multiple parallel identical universes: 
in one the cat survives and in another the cat dies in an in-
finite number of parallel universes 

Where all conceivable outcomes of all events actually 
Happen – called alternative realities splitting from other 
universes; the global multiverse represents the many-
worlds theory in a single geometry




Almost everyone makes a promise, 
Every time a new year rolls around, 
And so as not to forget what it is, 
Some even bother to write it down.

I am going to quit smoking, 
I’ll never take another drink, 
As well you should stop if not, 
Your clothes & breath will stink.

I am going to quit eating sweets, 
Not one piece of chocolate cake, 
Why don’t these resolutions work? 
Everyone makes one vital mistake.

Before you can ever quit anything, 
It is imperative that you must start, 
To The Holy Spirit dwelling in your heart.

No one alone has the will power, 
To quit wrong & start doing right, 
The positive voice heard inside your mind? 
That is The Holy Spirit to guide your life.

Too many listen to the negative aspect, 
Of the saying that you’ll never succeed, 
Do not listen to the evil one’s thoughts, 
Only the positive ideas that you need.

Well, how do I distinguish between the two? 
That’s as simple as putting butter on bread, 
Just to put some negative thoughts in your head? 

Don’t just write your goals down on paper, 
Stamp them deep into the center your mind, 
Addition of The Holy Spirit to the equation, 
Remember He’s trustworthy, loving and kind.

A promised comforter was sent in His place, 
The form of The Holy Spirit of the Almighty 
Yes you can, yes you can & will win any race.

So don’t make resolutions on your own, 
Call on The Holy Spirit to lead the way, 
Now through His strength and guidance, 
You can make resolutions every single day.

Okay, start with a change to your language? 
Concentrating only on the positive to speak, 
No more N or B words, whatever’s negative, 
Uplifting words to grow stronger, not weak.
 
More challenges will arise in your life, 
Satan’s job becomes that much harder, 
When our minds are set on doing right.

Make reading your bible the primary resolution, 
And stop wasting more time by fooling around, 
Last year has now become last year for a reason, 
Every day’s a new revelation sun-up to sundown.

And do not go into the New Year with an old mind, 
Otherwise you will still be thinking last year’s time, 
Old wine skins burst by being filled with new wine, 
So whatever didn’t work in the past leave it behind.

New year, new thinking, new growth, new mentality, 
Where the future must now become your new reality, 
New wine has yet to ferment and therefore old skins, 
Will split in half once the new growth process begins. 

I'm sinking into the depths of my madness again
thinking of things that only bring the shadows; 
Regrets I should have long since released
people that are from the past
memories that I wish could be erased away..

Pieces of wonderment float past me like wilted petals: 
Do those I've lost along the way think of me; 
wonder where my path has traveled, 
wish our outcomes had been different, 
Or am I like the dust that floats around them; 
so minuscule and fleeting in their landscape
that I've been forgotten before I even left their sight..

I've grown in my years and yet I am still the same; 
scared, lonely, full of grief and sorrow, 
lost within the confinements of my own disease-
and though while I have grown wise enough to know my faults
I still can't seem to grasp at how to change it; 
how to make it mold into something beautiful
or bury it into the sands of yesterday..

Envy seems to have become my newest companion
walking arm in arm with my old friend Misery, 
dancing around my soul with the demons in my head
driving me and holding me within my personal hell. 

A comet across the sky
or a war within my mind, 
A bitter battle fought
or a love come to naught
A movie without an end 
Or a sun made to bend
like a glass that refracts
until the pieces are put back.
A hole in the clouds
And an earth that is found 
to move its polar pull 
reversed full. 
Lights in the air
and machines that aren't there
As torrents cloud the sky
and Judgements pass on by
h dimension space
an enlightened human race
day that is night
and cosmic solar lights
all of this and more
twenty-twelve is at the door. 

the curtain is drawn, 
the memories of another year, 
a year of hardship and need, 

packed in a box, 
stored away to be forgotten.
we stand on the stage, 

stripped naked by necessity, 
forced to choose. 
ending, or beginning? 

the end of economic hope, 
the end of the environment, 
the end of individual rights, 

the end of capitalism. 
the end of the common man, 
the end of morality. 

the end of human dignity, 
the end of the road for the poor. 
or a new beginning? 

people of all colors, faiths, 
sexual orientations, economic situations, 
rich in diversity.  joining hands! 

sitting down with open minds and hearts, 
listening, really listening, 
understanding that what is good for one, 

must be good for all! 
understanding that when one suffers, 
we all suffer! 

when one is in need, 
we are all in need! 
standing together for freedom

of thoughts, ideas, and words! 
refusing to be made to follow blindly! 
standing up and demanding

world peace! 
standing up for the environment, 
throwing off the yoke of oppression

cast by the oil and Wall Street empire! 
standing up for people, 
people, not corporations, 

not governments. 
accepting, understanding, compassionate, 
determined, driven by dignity

the choice is ours to make! 
we've run out of time, 
the lights have gone dim. 

day of dawning, 
or time of the end

On this world peace day
The lovely quietness
Of their voices
Brought the same magic
In a realistic sweet way.

Kind words echoed nearer
In real tones of great care
Gentleness, openness, love rare
Touching the human heart
Oh, what a melody so dear! 

A day of world peace celebration
We'd like to extend throughout the year
In unity and hope for sure
And all divine inspiratimerciful father.  
i beg you alot.  
by the names of all saints and lovers.  
to let me this time.  
this very noble time.  
and never think to stop me.  
here it is, the knife of love.  
made in heart.  
so let me father.  
cut the wings of poems.  
the feathers of words.  
and the longest and wisest beak.  
has ever been seen and painted.  
by shakespeare sky_like.  
and staring_bedazzled eyes.  
in his old starry night.  
venice theatre.  
so watch me, father.  
changing the speech airlines.  
and sculpting.  
two words speaking.  
golden voice statue.  
in the form of a coloured parrot.  
to say on behalf of me.  
from two thousands twelve.  
to infinity.  
his only two words.  
THANK YOU. 
The Bell Tolled 
The Midnight Becomes Like A Dawn
Full Of Lights n Sounds
Not The Sun That Brightens The World 
But, 
The Firecrackers n The Mad Cries Of Hope n Joy.


Time Changes
Moves 
Stumbling Through The Passage Of Human Deeds 
Leading Our Hopes Into An Another Space
That's Just Begun 
And, 
Pushing Our Memories
Into Some Dark Alleys
Of What We Call The Past.


Time Stands Still 
And, 
Let Humans Move n Jump 
From One Territory To Another 
With A Frenetic Pace 
Bothering Little About The History 
Only Hoping 
For Some Improvisations 
Some Steps Forward
With Excitement
And, 
Fever.


What Changes Did We Count 
That We Have Ever Caused 
Except A Continuous Downward Spiralling 
And, 
An Ever Increasing 
Log Of Memories 
Guilt Ridden 
And, 
Infertile. 





I love my love with a v 
Because it is like that
I love my love with a b
Because I am beside that
A king.
I love my love with an a
I love my love and a a is the best of them
Think well and be a king,
Think more and think again
I love my love with a dress and a hat
I love my love and not with this or with that
I love my love with a y because she is my bride
I love her with a d because she is my love beside
Thank you for being there
Nobody has to care
Thank you for being here
Because you are not there.

And with and without me which is and without she she can be late and then and how and all around we think and found that it is time to cry she and I. 

my words fill in blank memories, 
while images of you stay fresh like ocean air—
weaved in my soul like the braids of my hair.

an addict of wrong addictions, 
but so sweet is the taste
until you discover—life comes un-laced.

twenty-one and rising: 
you were the only love I didn't borrow
kiss me now for I know of no tomorrow.

lost souls are but shooting stars; 
I wish I may, I wish I might—
with two black freckles turned to the night.

two decades plus one
and to be a lover was my only care, 
when in fact, it's the impossible I dared.

twenty-one and rising: 
with nothing to show but sorrow
kiss me now for I know of no tomorrow.

a truth is best hidden between two lies, 
you didn't hear it through the goodbyes.
you didn't hear it through the goodbyes. 


The wheel of the quivering meat
conception
Turns in the void expelling human beings,
Pigs, turtles, frogs, insects, nits,
Mice, lice, lizards, rats, roan
Racinghorses, poxy bucolic pigtics,
Horrible unnameable lice of vultures,
Murderous attacking dog-armies
Of Africa, Rhinos roaming in the
jungle,
Vast boars and huge gigantic bull
Elephants, rams, eagles, condors,
Pones and Porcupines and Pills-
All the endless conception of living
beings
Gnashing everywhere in Consciousness
Throughout the ten directions of space
Occupying all the quarters in & out,
From supermicroscopic no-bug
To huge Galaxy Lightyear Bowell
Illuminating the sky of one Mind-

Poor!
I wish I was free 
of that slaving meat wheel
and safe in heaven dead. 

We speak to Robots on the phone, 
And our Computers are our home, 
We really think we're not alone, 
But all of this lacks Human tone, 
As our poor lives turn into stone. 

Growth! Progress! Expansion! 
Then downsize it all when it gets too bloated, 
and if that doesn’t work, 
lower the borrowing rates
so that the downsized people
can get become Better Consumers
and get deeper in debt.

Encourage the poor
to buy that home with the white picket fence, 
even though they can barely make ends meet, 
then who will be the one
to tell them that the payments are too high
and foreclosure is the only answer? 
Can we at least keep the white picket fence? 
they ask.

I suppose there was a time
when people went shopping
only when they needed to buy
bread and things to live on; 
When did it become
a citizen’s duty
to keep the economy afloat
while filling our homes
with worthless junk, 
all bought on credit? 

The time has come
to pause. .. 

Hi, Ram, don't get late, 
With Ravan I have date.
Prepare soup for Lav and Kush, 
O, give them also Orange juice.
Listen, don't nag over phone, 
I'm busy bee and you're a lazy drone! 
For shopping taking your debit card, 
(then Ram pretends as if all words unheard) 
Give your credit card, it's my right, Oye, 
Hurry Ramu, otherwise, I'll apply A. 

Where did Beauty go? 
Poetry and such, 
The Art we loved so much, 
Of feeling, deep, beyond, 
The outer shell of chance, 
The Romance, 
Once the World did know
Where, oh, where did it go? 

'Gone With The Wind'
Romantic glow, 
How I regret the years, 
That have passed, 
And all the beauty that once was, 
Cast into the swamp of litany, 
Lost in the shadows, 
Of non-creativity
Never again to see the light, 
And artistically, 
To have taken silent flight.


Speak low, speak little; who may sing
While yonder cannon-thunders boom?
Watch, shuddering, what each day may bring:
Nor 'pipe amid the crack of doom.'

And yet-the pines sing overhead,
The robins by the alder-pool,
The bees about the garden-bed,
The children dancing home from school.

And ever at the loom of Birth
The mighty Mother weaves and sings:
She weaves-fresh robes for mangled earth;
She sings-fresh hopes for desperate things.

And thou, too: if through Nature's calm
Some strain of music touch thine ears,
Accept and share that soothing balm,
And sing, though choked with pitying tears. 

Being And all the things that happen to you
You ain't got a clue where this will take you
But it's the best age, it's really so true

Falling in love
You catch dreams like a dove
You can see your hopes in the sky above
But you trade them again for a couple of $#§You may have the best time
And feel really damn fine
You can make it all up and create in your mind
But in the end it's gone for a dime

The best year is over
Better look out for cover
It's all gonna end in a supernova
Just like the luck of my four-leaf-clover

So baby, please make sure
Never feel too secure
Of the things that happen to you
When you're ne step forward, 
Stand up, please.
Let me explain need and virtue, 
the mystery gravitating around you. 
Let me break the distance.

A new voice is a return to hope.
Let´s make doves fly, 
and forget routine, survival.
A walk, some confidence, 
knots untie, 
breathe slowly.

I´ll give you my eyes, 
and feel you close.
Words tremble, rush, 
so many things to say.

How could you preserve yourself sweet 
and keep listening with soft ears? 

Talking about honey 
we discovered sweet voices
need care


Why try to understand the things that only take place in our heads
Why try to solve the riddles that cannot be undone
Why suffer on this planet just to leave everything behind one day
Why try to find a reason not to end it all today
Why fight for something that you can not posses forever
Why try to love the things that soon will perish
Why hate something that you can simply just ignore
Why try to make a point when there is no audience that really cares
Why try to get as mush of something when you can never get enough
Why try to break the rules when later on they’ll make up new ones
Why try to hide under the covers when they can never hurt you on the inside
Why count the days you’ve lived instead of those that are yet to come
Why try to gain the trust of others when you can never trust them back yourself
Why pretend to care for something that simply backstabs you when you turn around
Why write the notes in new orders when they are already perfect as they are
Why spend the days in solitude when you never know the day you’ll leave
Why spend our time in this place that we call home
Why not travel all around and see beyond what we are given
Why not create a new religion that will fail just like all others
Why not create a god that they will hate just like the one we already have
Why care for something so complicated and not be aware of what it is
Why try to do the things that no one understands
In order to leave a mark behind
In order to be remembered after your corpse has long ago been rotting
In order to find someone that will understand
And in the end extend a helping hand. 


Like the showers of rain on the hot days
The nectar of your Love 
Falls on my scorching earth always
To quench the thirst of my heart. 

Like the tune created out of the violin 
The sweet melody of your Love 
Touches my heart every time
To make my mind tranquil and blissful. 

Like the beams in a full moon night 
The magical light of your Love 
Enters the corridor of my heart 
To vanish its darkness every time. 

Like the fragrance of Jasmine 
The sweet smell of your Love 
Spreads in my mind every time
To carry me to the garden of Heaven. 

Peeps into the dark cell 
Of my imprisoned mind
To free it from the bondage
Of happiness derived from false love
In an unfair way.

Like the rainbow lasted 
For few minutes in the sky, 
Desire to have sensuous pleasure 
Grips my senses sometimes.
My inner self starts to fight against it
To free them to the world of holiness. 

Like a vagabond or an insane person
Sometimes my thought wanders 
In the world of nothingness.
Then my conscience wakes 
To lead it to the right way 
And carry me to the world of purity. 

When Love wears the mask of Love 
Sometimes I get confused 
And trapped due to error of judgement
And my senses get paralysed.
Then my inner self shows me 
The right way to joy. 

I will no longer come back. 
On the way of my life 
Suddenly I met you 
And then I spent few rare moments with you. 
It was you who taught me the true meaning of life. 

I came to this earth alone. 
Few parts of my life I spent and the rest I've to pass. 
I travelled with the sound of the bell of time. 
Sometimes I was beaten by time. 
Sometimes I defeted time. 
I sumbled on the way of life but my journey didn't stop. 

On the way of my journey 
The sweet melody of cuckoo, 
The beauty of full moon 
And the showers in summer fascinated me badly.
I found the bees rushing towards beehive
But the meditation of my life didn't stop. 

On the way of my life 
I saw the giant dancing wildly.
The snow fall in winter never affected me. 
I heard the roar of the bear and the wild buffalo. 
I found the restless monkey and the clever fox on my way
But no one could stop me and I never felt tired. 

I never compromised with the unjustness. 
My true heart and pure mind will never change. 
Walking on the way of life is my passion. 
I will never stop, I will proceed to drink the honey of life. 
O my dear Sanjana! 
I will never return to your life. 

I don't need to meet you every day. 
I don't need your affinity every month. 
I need only your love every second. 

It does not matter for me 
If you stay far away for whole life. 
It will make difference for me 
If you don't love me with your heart. 

Moon shines the sea from million miles away 
But their love for each other will never fade. 
I love you so much as your love shines
With your love from from far away.
 

Diamond is so costly as it isn't easily gained. 
Gold is so valuable as it isn't so available. 
You are so precious to me as I can't get you 
But you love me with your heart. 

Time can never affect our hearts. 
Distance can't be distance between our minds
As they are tied every time 
With the thread of divine love. 


Once I dreamt with you 
To make a happy room
In this mundane world. 

Your holy love made 
This world heaven. 
A world of eternal joy
Was created in my heart. 

I was proceeding towards 
The world of perpetual peace. 
Then disaster happened
On the way of my journey.

Everything got disrupted.
I felt- 'Now you are not my you.' 
With the black shadow of a giant
Your heart got unholy. 

I felt, 'Now our dreams are not same. 
They are fully different from each other.' 
We two proceeded towards 
Two opposite poles. 

Then suddenly I fell in 
A violent tempest. 
I seemed, 'Shall I be turned into pieces 
Like a shooting star? ' 

I felt as if I had no existence. 
I perceived- I had none in this world.
But my dream world is mine.
It can't belong to others. 

With my great care, affection and love 
My dream world is still alive in my heart. 
Here you and I will live forever 
In happiness with our holy Love. 


At a very dark night. 
Once I started my journey 
With the new born sunshine. 
My dark heart was soaked 
With the the fresh morning light. 

In the scorching heat of life 
Sitting under the cool shadow
Of your true love
My thirsty heart drank 
Your holy nectar 
In joy and happiness.  

Weary failed to touch me 
When I was on the way 
Of the journey of life.
The afternoon showers of rain 
And the charming rainbow 
Created romance in my mind. 

Then suddenly I saw 
The sun appearing 
In the cloudless sky. 
Still now the sun setting beauty 
Visualises my mind 
And gives me immense pleasure. 

I never thought 
Such a dark evening 
Would fall on my heart. 
I watched the moonless night. 
Perhaps the moon was busy 
In spending honey moon. 

I will never stop to move on 
Though I'm alone at midnight.
The stars are twinkling and saying, 
'Don't be afraid, come on. 
We are with you to show your path 
At this very dark night. 

I will not stop, I must proceed
As just few hours are left. 
I will meet the dawn 
Soaked with holy dew. 
Then the new born sunshine will enter
The casement of my heart. 


To the waves of Love in my heart.
Your full hearted joy and smiling
Play the flute of Love in my mind. 

Without your tenderness and care 
My life seems to be a motionless river. 
Only your Love for me can bring 
Joy and happiness in my mind. 

Even the hot days of summer 
And the cold nights of winter 
Seem to me the sweet hours of spring 
If you're with me every time. 

I can't think of my life, my creativity
Without your love and proximity. 
My world created because of you 
Will last forever only for you. 


To expand its petals in the sky; 
Where the blue sea stops 
To move into the cave of the earth, 
My thought starts 
Its journey to the infinite. 

Where the water of life begins
To dry and lose its existence;  
Where the nectar of love gets
Evaporated into nothingness, 
My thought starts 
Flying in the sky of creation. 

When the human being lies
On the bed like a corse; 
When the sun takes rest at night
To regain its energy, 
My thought becomes pregnant
With the knowledge of vitality.

When the earth starts
Feeling drowsy like a drunker; 
When the nerves of human being 
Get tired or paralysed, 
My thought becomes restless 
To drink the wine of creativity.

To solve the riddle of life, 
Crammed in my brain, 
I was wandering 
Along an unknown road 
In the afternoon of a summer
Like a thirsty wayfarer in the sands.

I saw few crows 
Crowing and flying 
Around me. 
Their eyes were telling me 
They were 
Very thirsty and hungry 
Just like me. 

I knew myself 
As a man fully different 
From others. 
No one can resemble me 
But I found a strange similarity  
between the crows 
And myself. 

I walked a long path 
Unknown to me. 
Now I am tired and hungry 
Just like the crows 
Flying around me. 
Perhapsto suppress their hunger 
I won't be able to return home. 


You thought you were free
But you are chained
Once and again

To a life where the gain
Can't catch up to the pain
A year of fortune
Is lost to the torture

A great roller coaster of victories and falls
And quite honestly seriously fun
Falls victim to a Waterloo of ignorance
And in the end it's to decide between a trip and a gun



It really won't be long until I'm older, 
     with every year that passes, I can see, 
     the life-times I have wasted, 
     although, I am only weeks from  '.
 
          I have seen another summer filled with laughter, 
     I am watching as the leaves fall from the trees, 
     as the winter closes in, 
     I watch the days grow dim, 
     while being only weeks from  ''.
 
          There is not much that I know of love, 
     though more than I have ever known, 
     'nor much of life or death, I guess, 
  
   and as my years go flying past, 
     I fear that I won't grasp  - - - 
     the meaning of my life by  '. 


a mad-man watching, 
solemn offerings to departed souls
eaten by crows



reel in my sleep
and re-runs turn 
in my half awakened state
then a full epic motion picture
plays thru-out the day
where you are the star. 

Any festival like this and your phone starts buzzing
As it would be right now
But will you be awaiting my message somehow? 
Never planned to irritate you- Make you so blue
But today I missed someone- I hope you did too
hours passed now and not a word from your end
Shut up and keep quiet is the lesson to comprehend
Days which passed were truly amazing
But that time is now, only left for memorizing
Aren't I a total idiot, sitting on earth and
Howling at the moon? 
Closing my eyes now, hoping for sleep to come soon-Father, first of all know how much I love you and appreciate you
in my life.  Father you never leave me, always there to see me
through.  This week Father you were ever present in not only my
life but that of my daughter and I thank you for what you did for
her this week.  She now understands what I’ve been telling her
for quite sometime.  There you were Father showing her what she
needed to see, giving her the inspiration she needed and filling 
her with positive energy enabling her to go after her dream with
always being present in my life.

Father I ask you to touch the  life  of a sister poet and her husband. 
I know you know who I’m speaking of Father, so I won’t mention
any names.  I speak of a sister poet who lives a difficult life dealing with an alcoholic husband, but you know Father she is 
standing by her husband, taking one day at a time.
 
Today Father I pray for a healing for this man,  help him to give  up this addiction in his life, help him to see the light, to  realize
what is happening to his wife, to know that he is going down hill
and needs to fight his way back into the real world.  This man
I pray that you step into their lives and show them your power.  
I know there isn’t anything that you can’t do, you’ve showed me
asking herself-why-. I’m sure this man wants to give up this
support of his wife and with your divine power and the blood of
leave this alcoholic addiction behind them.
Father I ask that you talk to him, show him the way, inspire him to
I leave this with you for you are the all powerful, the all knowing
and the master of the universe.
 
 
When you hear Charley Parker
tell it,
Either on records or at sessions,
Or at offical bits in clubs,
Shots in the arm for the wallet,
Gleefully he Whistled the
perfect
horn
Anyhow, made no difference.

Charley Parker, forgive me-
Forgive me for not answering your eyes-
For not having made in indication
Of that which you can devise-
Charley Parker, pray for me-
Pray for me and everybody
In the Nirvanas of your brain
Where you hide, indulgent and huge,
No longer Charley Parker
But the secret unsayable name
That carries with it merit
Not to be measured from here
To up, down, east, or west-
-Charley Parker, lay the bane,
off me, and every body


They're buildin' the gallows outside my cell. 
I got minutes to go. 

And in minutes I'll be in Hell. 
I got minutes to go. 

Well, they give me some beans for my last meal. 
minutes to go. 

And you know.  nobody asked me how I feel. 
I got minutes to go. 

So, I wrote to the Gov'nor.  the whole damned bunch. 
Ahhh.  minutes to go. 

And I call up the Mayor, and he's out to lunch. 

I got more minutes to go. 

Well, the Sheriff says, 'Boy, I wanna watch you die'. 
minutes to go. 

I laugh in his face.  and I spit in his eye. 
I got minutes to go. 

Well.  

I call out to the Warden to hear my plea. 
minute to go. 

He says, 'Call me back in a week or three. 
You've got minutes to go.' 

Well, my lawyer says he's sorry he missed my case. 
Mmmm. .minutes to go. 

Yeah, well if you're so sorry, come up and take my place. 
I got minutes to go. 

Well, now here comes the padre to save my soul 
With minutes to go. 

And he's talkin' about burnin', but I'm so damned cold. 
I got more minutes to go. 

Now they're testin' the trap. It chills my spine. 
I got minutes to go. 

'Cuz the goddamned thing it works just fine. 
I got more minutes to go. 

I'm waitin' for the pardon.  gonna set me free 
With more minutes to go. 

But this ain't the movies, so to hell with me. 
I got more minutes to go. 

And now I'm climbin up the ladder with a scaffold peg 
With more minutes to go. 

I've betta' watch my step or else I'll break my leg. 
I got more minutes to go. 

Yeah.  with my feet on the trap and my head in the noose.  
more minutes to go. 

Well, c'mon somethin' and cut me loose. 
I got more minutes to go. 

I can see the mountains. I see the sky. 
more minutes to go. 

And it's too damned pretty for a man to die. 
i got more minutes to go 

I can hear the buzzards.  hear the crows. 
more minute to go. 

And now I'm swingin' and here I gooooooooo. . 

Nothing permanent ever came
Neither success, nor failure.
It's how wise you play the game, 
Your integrity that'll endure.

Eagles do look good in sky, 
But whose voice is pleasing, say? 
Which is the bird you want in nest
To sing for you all day? 

He who plays fair always
Is the one ideal, worthwhile.
And even when he fails, 
He accepts it with smile! 

A man of succes is not he
Who has conquered all feats, 
But he who the world envies
Even in his greatest defeats!

'One day you'll have kids, 
and I hope they turn out ten times worse than you'"h of December 

It’s been raining for days, fine drizzle not caused by tempest but 
by a mild depression, liquid silk that gives soil time to soak it up 
before it runs into rivers and brooks and disappears back into 
the sea. The rain falls on the old roof tiles and gives off a soothing 
sound a promise, come spring the plants will be stronger and 
flowers richer in colour and profusion than the year before. 

Grass grows quickly in the mizzle I stroke the mule’s flank it doesn’t 
mind being wet but keeps on munching on succulent feed. It is when 
the westerly blows it seeks shelter under a carob tree or comes up 
to the houses to be stabled. The dog awakes she wants to go out, 
I put a raincoat on, we follow the lane till she has had enough and 
 wants to go back to her place by the fire. 

When Barcelona fell, the darkened glass
turned in the world and immense ruinous gaze,
mirror of prophecy in a series of mirrors.
I meet it in all the faces that I see.
 
Decisions of history the radios reverse;
Storm over continents, black rays around the chief,
Finished in lightning, the little chaos raves.
I meet it in all the faces that I see.
 
Inverted year with one prophetic day,
high wind, forgetful cities, and the war,
the terrible time when everyone writes "hope."
I meet it in all the faces that I see.
 
When Barcelona fell, the cry on the roads
assembled horizons, and the circle of eyes
looked with a lifetime look upon that image,
defeat among us, and war, and prophecy,
I meet it in all the faces that I see. 

Far from the stars
Came a ray of light.
It lit up your face
And I saw you all night! 

In the midst of dusk
With darkness all around, 
Shiny rays I saw in woods
And a handsome you I found.

You were sitting by the lake, 
You were singing a song.
In a world of fantasies
We were walking along.

Your muscular, huge body
I could see in the shade.
Awe fully filled my mind, 
Began a romantic cascade! 

You held a white swan
With so much gentle care, 
I was peeping from the leaves; 
You didn't know I was there.

The radiance of your face
Had carried me away.
I felt as if I should
In your arms always stay.

The sun was rising, 
I was afraid you'd go.
Before you rode your horse, 
I wanted you to know.

With shivery, shaky feet, 
And sweat dripping down
I stepped out from bushes
And you saw me in my gown! 

Far from that distance, 
My face you sharply eyed; 
And suddenly I feared
You'd hate me 'cause I spied.

So lightly you approached me
I felt I would scream.
But you gently rode me away, 
And I woke up from my dream! 


So proud, happy and meek.
I just didn't know then
What was waiting for me! 

Right away on night two
While we were snoring aloud, 
Bang opened our doors, 
And we were called out.

Oh! Seniors they were! 
So we had to move.
So horrified we were
About what they would do! 

We started speaking of ourselves
Like showing resume for a job, 
Felt like promoting oneself
In midst of a mob! 

They called it 'Intro'
And that was all fair.
But drowsy at twelve midnight
That would come as nightmare! 

We are budding Doctors
Was what we felt then.
But soon our misery came on us
When we studied Biochem! 

Then came there Anatomy
The 'Boss of t Year', 
The fun we had in DH
The formalin and the tear! 

The Physio department you know, 
Is known for being rude.
However perfect we were, 
The exams were always crude! 

Days passed by and by
And we were now all friends.
Bunking lectures and sleeping in class
Were few of commonest trends.

The life back in hostel
Is such a fun I say.
You have the best of friends
And a new experience each day! 

Despite being from t year
We try to be dare devils, 
We bunk the mess and go nights out
Then comes on us the Rector's evil! 

The hostel terrace and the lamp, 
The midnight two and maggi bowl, 
New rooms and the DJ nights
Fun was here for each soul! 

The lovely Farewell Parties, 
The rocking Freshie's Day, 
We simply loved them so much, 
The dramas and each play! 

The lovely college canteen
Is such a heavenly place.
We've found each dashing senior here, 
And every beautiful face! 

The college library, Oh! 
Is the most slumbering city, 
Hell is out there
Each face there wears a pity! 

We have a major crush on one, 
We dare to play the love game
Only to realize he's occupied
This tragedy with all is same! 

While we pass sleepless nights
Someone else appears in scene.
We're still thinking of the old guy
While new stories already begin! 

We want to laugh a lot
But we cry aloud
Because all this happened
When exams were around! 

We come to our senses and wake up
The poison of failure we fear.
We slog and cry and bang each hour, 
But miraculously exams we clear! 

This is MBBS and we the 'Students'
We learnt to overcome each fear
Through the most happenning event..
A Journey called t Year! 


Sitting in the shimmering, 
noon sun.

basking together as one.
It was just you and me, 

why we were allergic, 
to reality.

You touched me, 
I always touched you.

If only I could have been
more, than a 

pair, of old shoes. 

in the villages
in days of yore
young men proved 
their vigor
by lifting gigantic rocks

but in -
the remarkable year of 
the French Village of Bugarach
(where many sagacious youths gathered)   -
away in Tunisia, 
the young man 
downs eggs
egg-citedly
in a dare
and he's up to his esophagus in eggs raw
when something in him cracks
(O poor wasted youth of   
and just before winning his bet
he dies; 
it's Armageddon for him in  
though he also gains an epiphany: 
raw eggs can kill



-
caveat

of course 
O Ye Olde Sensitive Souls
this is not a yoke -
I mean, this is not a joke
For verily,eggs can kill


I shall, dear reader stop right here.
Though this, to critics may appear
to be an inner, insecure
but outwardly so very sure
and Lederhosenmusketeer.

You note the number, yes of course, 
my pen is worn, its voice is hoarse.
The magic three may never come
which, in itself a princely sum, 
would ask the author for remorse. 

An amber room woken with failing light, 
A box of wine interrupts the busy floor, 
An ashtray innocently deals death at its fingertips.
And one single door stands guard over all.
A private penitentiary closed from the outside, 
Weather would like to visit sometime.
But the inmate will have nothing to do with it.
A hermit over all that he presides.
Floral curtains delet the ancient sky.
The windows are punished for their insolence.
The roof stands ready overhead, 
Just in case life decides to try break in.
A lonely bookshelf filled with useless books, 
Holds in its heart the hope of being great.
The carpeted desert of the punch-drunk floor
Makes for interesting reading when you’re bored.
The walls are bare and flaunt their nakedness, 
As innocent as if they were all pagans, 
Which if you are religious isn’t very much, 
How differently we’ll all read this verse. 

Life ripped me apart, ripped away from me the only defense I sheltered behind. Life threw me overboard and used me as shark bait. Life mocked me and called me names, then laughed in my face after kicking me in the core. . But here I am - as strong as I've ever been, ready to fight back, and I owe it all to the amalgamation of different battles outside the battlefield. Life, follow me to the ring, where I'll show you who the master of me really is.E

madam and SIRThere is a move in this country to keep guns out of schools, 
And yet our Founding Fathers found it to be a rightful tool, 
The Pledge of Allegiance is removed which instilled pride, 
We banned the bible but sexuality, students need not hide? 

It is true guns are not for the irresponsible as people claim, 
But, banning them will not stop the criminals or the insane, 
School districts put metal detectors in the good book's place.

If gun control is implemented it will make easier every crime, 
Good citizens unarmed then evil is more apt to get out of line, 
When the bad guys know the good guys don't have or cannot, 
Be armed with like firepower or resistance, what have we got? 

Chaos! Much greater than any thing now present in the U. 

S. 

A., 
Every time crime abounds safety will be to look the other way, 
And even then, knowing that no one can lend a hand or assist, 
The ability to stand around & do nothing is a much greater risk.

Every mass killing in our safe schools suffered irreparable harm, 
Isn't because the kids had guns but our educators weren't armed, 
No murders are sneaking in police stations or on a military base, 
As they know darn well the likelihood of return fire in their face.

More background checks, no buy it now & take it home with ammo, 
The minimum? 'Complete Criminal History' why take the gamble? 
Along with a medical investigation re: an applicant's mental history, 
When buying a gun gone is the right to doctor-patient confidentiality.      

The banning of weapons because they kill would be like banning cars, 
Just because people get drunk and get behind the wheel leaving bars, 
The motor vehicle is not the problem so therefore, neither is the gun, 
But, it is in the hands of the unstable when the most damage is done.

d Amendment protects the right of the people to keep & bear arms, 
Now it's as necessary as livestock, tractors and grain feed on a farm, 
Are not air marshals and airplane pilots trained and armed in flight? 
Don't let a rash to judgment implement the wrong in place of a right.

Remember the gangster days of Al Capone, the Mafia & the Mob? 
Our streets would be no safer and it would be easier to get robbed,     
A good defense stops a good offense, teams will play another day, 
However, there will be no tomorrow for the unarmed blown away. 

Man is not worried in the middle

Man in the Middle
Is not Worried
He knows his Karma
Is not buried

But his Karma,
Unknown to him,
May end -

Which is Nirvana

Wild Men
Who Kill
Have Karmas
Of ill

Good Men 
Who Love
Have Karmas
Of dove

Snakes are Poor Denizens of Hell
Have come surreptitioning
Through the tall grass
To face the pool of clear frogs


Saddened when in the local paper of parents Daniel & Vicki I read, 
About the death of their year old daughter d Lt. Emily J. 

T. Perez, 
Father and grandfather proudly served their country I remember that, 
She proved a very tough act to follow, this spunky little Army brat.

At that time she was small in stature but big in heart, 
No matter what the role, Emily more than played her part, 
Armed with the nickname of Kobe for always being sure, 
Or whatever the task was her shots were straight and pure.

Active with Peace Baptist Church residing at Fort Washington, 
A family member afflicted with HIV and her crusade had begun, 
In Prince George County she helped others start a HIV-AIDS Ministry, 
Superwoman was determined to help combat this deadly disease.

Assistant Principal N. Laney said, "this wasn’t some average Joe, "
As her high school track coach, Nathaniel certainly should know, 
Alexandria’s Red Cross called her focused while always ready to go, 
The peer education program said she was never late & very dependable.

An Oxon Hill High School wing commander in the Junior ROTC, 
Serving her country with the Army in any capacity is what she longed to be, 
At West Point, choir, track, first minority command, cream of the crop, 
Intelligent as Emily was she still couldn’t spell the words quit or stop.

As the platoon leader Perez was patrolling Iraq in a military Humvee, 
A bomb exploded under her truck from cowardly insurgents called an IED,

So, wife is a

Yes its true; 

For the Family

Man's life. 

dearest, O my new, new love -
will you grant me but deviations? 
for I will love truly and give everything unto you; 
in all ways I'll be the man you want me to be
but in two - and grant those my only perversions, let them be: 
First - allow me to drive all my life; 
never take the wheel from me. 
you see, my dad never allowed me to drive
and he threw me in the back seat
and never even told me where he'd bring me
and he'd dump me
in my nana's or in the shopping center
sometime for a week or two
and when I said Could I drive? 
He'd say: You? you scum! 
You're only  

So now when we settle down and build our own nest
you must really let me drive
like hell
really let me be the driver
and let me drive
never you take the wheel
and I'll drive you wherever you want to
but Oh - promise, promise, never take the wheel from me. 

And the d deviation, before I forget. 
I do have the habit
of digging my nose
whenever I'm happy
and so when I'm at the wheel
you can bet your last dollar 
I'll be digging my nose
(the go together)  
so you must promise 
to let me be
and let me dig my nose as I drive
for nothing makes me happier
so never, never
O please
never ever rap on my knuckles 
when I dig my nose 
like my mum did with her steel ruler
whenever I put my fingers in my nose

O if you can promise me these that you'll allow these perversions 
to be the normal rule in our love -
Oh, then I'll be the happiest man ever. 
Now excuse me, while I dig my nose.  

Hate molds, interacting unfolds, death surrounding, our foes
Hatred grows, warriors die, bodies fly, moms cry, on this, desolated road 
Jam pen, write within, time given, deception ridden, love glisten 
In light, flow nice, love kites, wind guides, my life, ride nice 
Love life, breakthrough strife, love poetry,words, enough blood
words, or the,syllables, gives life, vivid views, words born
Life scorned, bright lights, quenched eyes, loves nice, ink bleeds
While listeners, read these, insightful poems, always shall, it be, forever told  
Never be, deserted alone, desolate window, wind current, don’t ever, go there
words, all needed, readers fed, ink bled, eyes red, no rest, am I, the best

Never quite
understood

(you understand me)     

the algebra
of your smile

or how that certain little look
added up

to so much more
than itself

that je ne sais quoi of you
(not making mathematical sense)     

but I instantly
got to grips with

(always preferred hands on
to the more theoretical stuff)     

the lovely geometry
of your body

instinctively understanding
each curve

the parabola of a yes
becoming a kiss

(your absolutely stunning
hypotenuse)   

me knowing only that
the one & one of us is

& will always be

just too

too

much!

Apparently this date makes it a square root day(only of them this century)   so Maths boffins long for them to come(and then they are gone!) . I wrote this on this 'day of days'(hence it's title)   but thought(much too much)   of the 'other things' that(oh!)   you do do.  

so well

These poems have come
Without a bottle
A shot

A home. 


I’m the river that flows through the darkness, the woods, and over the curb
The poverty continues to stay preserved but I can see change in the wind
Maybe the worlds changing its breathtaking hopefully I can take it in 
I look over Leland shoulder with intent he must repent 
Of course because all in the heavenly gates are rooting for him to win 
Not because he is more special than other lovely children 
It’s just that he will open your eyes be the one to bestow you with the helmet
To finally realize that the unseen land where I reside can finally be recognize
Now with him embracing the light maybe hope can be realized 
Now when this happen we can search for a better tomorrow 
All my brothers and sisters in heaven shall follow 
He will soon open the doors for the young ones to go through-
They’re shall be enough room because everything shall pan out like it suppose to-
He was always hoping and inspired the world to be better than him 
To better than the rules he set and go beyond making foolish sins
His chi is almost broken the children must not make this fly 


Who are they? 
Where are they rushing? 
Some little bodied souls 
Rising before the sun
Are they going for some religious duty? 
Or  enjoy the Nature’s beauty? 

Have all the schools disappeared, 
Or playthings grounded, 
Or books taken by alien invasion, 
And adult responsibility marooned.

Blake and Lamb did mention them
In their Eye opening discourse
The world has not sensed till yet
The hopes for tomorrow, they only set.

Wow! We have entered in t century, 
By performing great deeds 
Exploiting the little angels 
Has become our daily need.


A simple question to our decayed mentality
Can’t we give a break to this brutality

We can appreciate the energy in art 
and feel strong in the transfusion, 
but then time keeps dripping, 
the curse of the beauty drinker.

Surrogate life, 
virtual, safe, mediocre. 

Looking in the usual wrong places, 
we´ll never get to know 
what we want.

I am able to believe anything, 
to deceive myself once more. 

Do we need a miracle? 

In the meantime, 
silently, 
the mysterious order of truth 
moves forward. 

It is dusk again.
Once more this time
and loneliness.

The birds are here
but the empty space
remains.

Something got lost 
against the grain.
The wind blows, 
silence stays. 

Dear diary I have to unleash the pain inside of me 
Name is-Charles Hamilton, my pain has been confined you see
But I must let it out on the pages because I rather speak privately 

Tomorrow isn’t promised, never paid homage to my elders
I guess that explains my recent, yet prolonged failures
Drop out of high school to rob and steal for the jewelry
People in the concrete jungle snarl and kill thee 
But snatching chains wasn’t even cool to me

Wanted to be rapper, and I was looked at as a map with soft fur
A meal ticket, that was easy to bare new friends like a flock of birds
I’m exhausted; I tried so hard to floss it, my music not reaching the masses 
Not sticking to the fans like molasses, critics bash it, sticking to me like rashes 
Paint picture with words all about detail, but it won’t sale not reaching men or females

These are far more than trials and tribulations; I’m just stuck in foul situations 
Addicted to music is a must and a first, when I put time in it things only get worse 
Though I couldn’t say forget rap, this beat will soon commence will put me on the map 
In fact their problems worse that I couldn’t think of having
If I did have them I couldn’t fathom me lasting

My cousin Chenelle, a female singer 
Her voice couldn’t and never fade
Her voice imprinted in my brain 
She was lovely we were the same age 
She put on shows that you can’t stage

I grow mournful and dry tear as I melted 
She said she had a brain tumor but never felt it 
Doctors said she got three weeks to live, she still have three weeks to give
As she told me she cried all on the phone in her hospital home  
Couldn’t take it, I was scorned, I took my ears away from the phone 

I couldn’t believe it, but it’s all possible in a bed full of diseases 
He ignored my prayers, he purposely ignored me 
I guess he just never believed me, selling hope to deceive thee 

Angels always telling me fables 
While my prides being strangled
My life will always be dangled


I bow  before you lord Shiva
O  supreme and cosmic  truth, 
I bow before you  lord tryambaka  O mighty eyed deity, 
I salute you  lord somashekhara  Bearer of the crescent moon; 

Hail him mankind
For he is Neelakanta  Who stores fatal  poison in his throat
And wears the dreaded serpent on his neck, 
Endowed with matted hair 
Which bears the sacred ganges
He holds the three gunas Sattva  rajasand thamas  

He is the great lord of yogis 
Who sits couched on tiger skin and subdued   lust
Hail him for he is Nataraja  the master of thandava The last chant in times book.



 Tryambaka - trya -three, ambaka-eye
  Somashekhara-  Soma-nectar  Shekhara- crest
 Neelakanta- blue throat(cosumed poison)  
 

Gunas -operating principles of nature- Sattva , rajas and thama or namely creation preservation and annihilation
 

Nataraja-Eternal cosmic dancer
Thandava-dance leading to cosmic destruction or cleansing. 

Could you be the Graces? 
Beautifully blessed, 
By the gods from Olympus, 
No more, and no less, 
great modern poets, 
Gloriously, expressed 
Such wonderful Poetry, 
Never to forget. 

his soul molded 
of fear and love magma
of green icebergs


They say gold is hidden in lead, 
there are those who believe so. 

They get blind in the shine, 
siren songs, vain flash, 
traps in mortal mud.
They are impatient alchemists 
who find shortcuts to nowhere.

The mystery is: Gold does exist, indeed, 
But that lead which became gold, 
Never knew there was gold 
hidden in its nature


Life, Love & Us, 
A most wanted Must, 
To be Happy

Horsemen on the horizon 
upon a hill 
keep looking at me 
in the distance. 

Faces rescued 
from battles 
in the past. 

Paths without glory 
seem to come back, 
expecting an answer? 

I dream of birds I can talk to, 
of greyhounds of long shadows, 
of angry cats 
and guitars 
about to explode.

Melodies I cannot forget 
hide in my brain.
And then the dance 
in that empty space. 

The limelight on a silent chair, 
the wake up time, 
another coffee, 
and miles to drive.



Haiku 
Wet leaf in a pond
Ants abandoning sinking ship
Shore line yonder.  


Haiku
Tsunami brewing 
A child wading in the puddle
Escaping tadpoles 


Haiku
Ornamental pool 
Floating red plastic bucket
Eerie silence


How come You look for me
and pass the weary night with me, 
the knock, the voice, the gentle breeze, 
the bleeding heart, my misery
and then still the fail to be
the man, the broken dreams.

To Lope


The Torment

Sorrow swalowed me into the cruel black sea, 
The icy cold water washed over me, 
Memories spin around in my mind, 
Causing dark lucid dreams of every kind.
Grief and misery played their part, 
Leaving behind a broken heart

The Healing

Slowly the water ebbed away, 
The blackness mellowed to a shade of grey, 
Time as the healer showed the way, 
Helping me to cope day by day, 
Fear subsiding, confidence riegns, 
Ready to face the world again

The Future

The waters now are calm and clear, 
My life again is full of cheer, 
Smiles return and with them light, 
The grey is replaced by colours so bright, 
Though life was cruel, when it took you away, 
I look to the future as a brand new day


Three ducks pecked around
In a garden one warm day
They wore beautiful coats
Of white feathers to display

They primped and they pampered
These coats of pure white
Their strutting and flapping
Created quite a sight

It was a lovely summer day
And they adored the warm sun
Just three little ducks
Searching for a bit of fun 

But it grew hotter and hotter
Oh dear, it was warm
If they didn't find water
Could it do them some harm? 

They might find a stream
Or a small pond would do
But when they could find none
They started to stew

Finally they came across
A child's small pool
They plopped in immediately
Their mom raised no fool

So my friend, please remember
If you feel something's amok
At your child's wading pool
You may find white ducks

Free.
Waves on an endless ocean, 
Swelling and changing
Changing and flowing, 
Flowing and alive.

Strong.
A full moon on a starless night, 
Shining and reflecting, 
Reflecting and silent, 
Silent and alive.

Secure.
Love without question, 
Growing and evolving, 
Evolving and wild, 
Wild and alive. 

Thursday night basketball at a south side Chicago park, 
Gunfire amidst chaos as shots echoed loudly in the dark, 
Our culprits? Dread


Locked men in a dark colored sedan, 
The tally would have been even greater had some not ran.

Mr. George Zimmerman did not get dressed up in a wig, 
Isn’t this incident & those like it worse than what he did? 
How many Black Entertainers boycott Chicago, Illinois? 
And why wasn’t this year old home playing with toys? 

Ok, Chicago’s the, "Murder Capital" of our society but alas, 
Is there any truth to less gun violence if certain bills pass? 
Tougher sentences & extended penalties with stiffer fines, 
Enough of time off for good-behavior do every bit of time.

Julian Harris told the Sun-Times culprits shot at him first, 
He escaped unharmed while his nephew received the worst, 
are in critical condition with reported serious or fair, 
So late at night what in the heck was a toddler doing there? 

In a car, jogging alongside a road now playing a basketball game, 
All innocent victims to say the least but notice it is not confined, 
First offense or not, a conviction of CCW requires serious time. 

A gun’s no more dangerous than a car when the vehicle’s parked, 
An idiot behind the wheel is dangerous in daylight & in the dark, 
Police officials declined to discuss details of the investigation so far, 
One thing’s certain, it involves deadly instruments, a gun & a car.

Shooting hoops at, "Back Of The Yards" before this incident begins, 
Was there anyone in Chicago on the lookout for George Zimmerman? 
The city’s, "Labor Day Weekend" were injured while fell dead, 
NAACP is still crying foul about Sanford, Fla. I’m shaking my head. 

Zen

I will think 
Of nothing 
And listen
To silence 
That falls 
As rain 
On my roof 

Zen
Terror
Sinks as silt
In a lake’s
Still water  

Zen
TV voices 
Filling my room
With trivialitypoor man talking this morning, 
told me his insurance lapsed. 
he went up and reinstated
but they took his tag for days

makes about an hour, 
the only job he can find. 
now he's afraid he's gonna lose it
cant get to work for days

living on the edge
good people, hard lives
just trying to get by

The little one 
only years old
my cuter half
big saucer like eyes
chubby fingers
brave his soldiers
trained his horses
strong his elephants
clever his chariots
protect the king
faster his mind
I must confess
he beat me 
in a game of chess! !

s.-author's note.  rams is the weight of the brain


He stands tall, with dark beautiful eyes.
His coat is that of shiny black velvet.
Across fields in the moonlit sky, he soars.
Leaps with grace and vigor.

We call him Blaze, our choice, no, 
he once belonged to another.
Abuse he faced,  in his previous home, 
so I brought him to his brother. 

Like a pleasure sucking traveller
At midnight I am on the sea shore
To watch the beauty of the sea.

Just like a passionate maiden
Full of youth and vitality
The sea dances and creates a melody.

Like a romantic girl
The sea wears a blue frock
To dance hour after hour tirelessly.

The wind is fascinated
By the beauty of the dancing sea
And he falls in love with her at first sight.

The waves rush to the sea shore
Like a love sick girl
Who gives all to her dearest lover.

Watching the romantic sea
I become restless to be a true lover
And try to compose a love story.

Sat on the porch of a broken down house.
He was about to become homeless, 
without any food, not even a mouse.

I stood and gazed at this poor lonely cat.
Shook my head and placed him in my hat.
A long drive across the city we drove.
Now Tiger sits cozily in front of our stove.

The clearing of one’s heart without remission.
A voice from deep within, contemplates, 
removal of festered thoughts of sin.

Forgiveness, allowing positive energy to prevail.
Wiping out all negativity along the trail.
Forcing out emotions of darkness deep.
Keeping straight, a good nights sleep.

full of chuckles, love and great laughter.
Filled with innocence through and through, 
with lots of hugs and kisses too.

I know proud grandparents will all agree, 
the love we receive is precious and free.
They have no motives, no deep held secrets.
Holding on to us tight, cradled in our arms
filling us with a calm of their innocent charms.

 
Note: 
It is said, "Having a child fall asleep in your
arms is one of the most peaceful feelings in
the world". 

Where are you, boys and girls 
of Miss Lindahl's h grade class? 

What became of you
when you slipped off
the far edge of my world? 

Many of you
I never saw again, 
or even thought of
until I saw this picture, 

yet you occupy a place 
that can't be filled
by anyone but you — 

so much yourselves, 
untrained as yet 
in putting on a face.

Your faces are colors 
long forgotten, 
your names sound notes
of a long-lost scale: 

Harvey Baer, Gail Rutherford, 
Marion Phipps, Jonathon Katz, 
Temmy Goldwasser, Randy Wahl —

your names are bells that angels ring, 
tolling the music of the spheres. 

This morning I’m a feline, 
walking with grace.
Hips swaying side to side
Head held high, tilted slightly.
Slowly moving in to manipulate you.

This afternoon I’m a dog, 
Needy, wanting, loving.
snuggling in your lap, 
feeling the warmth of your body, 
enjoying every precious moment.

Tonight I’m a tiger, 
gracefully moving toward you 
with great anticipation.
I’ll take you down, 
you will be mine.
I’m an animal most of the time. 

He stands at the mic, 
craggy faded eagle
in a grey suit, singing the verse
in a voice of smoke

surrounded by  stark figures
black like spectres 
from his own youth.

As he finishes, 
the band picks up the chorus
and he stands there 

smiling with his eyes
closed, just listening
and you feel his whole

life in that smile
and your life, too, 

as though the silent 
voice of the most beautiful
losers has given
birth to the whole world. 

Success is having what it takes 
to keep positivity on the trail
 to total freedom.
  Stand firm,  
knock negativity to the ground, 
 forgetting it  ever came around.
  Holding yourself accountable
 for everything you do.  
 Offering a helping hand to those not as
fortunate as you.
  Giving when finances are high, 
 giving when
finances are low, 
 acknowledging you reap
 what you sow. 

These timeless scenes of war, 
of the people leaving their homes, 
the columns of soldiers and tanks 
and the rubble left by the shells — 

it scarcely even matters
what color the uniforms are, 
you could substitute yellowed photos
a hundred years old or more, 
and no one would know the difference.

Human anger, reaching its limit, 
spills over in scenes like this, 
warriors and innocent victims
and somewhere, hidden in buildings, 
the ones who conceived the slaughter.

The pictures we see remind us, 
all those in our human lineage, 
how fragile are our encampments, 
how tender the threads of home, 
a neighborhood where we can walk
and a room to sit down for a meal.

All we who are living witness
say a prayer for the suffering victims 
and a thanks for a safe, warm bed, 

and cry for this human condition
of transience upon the earth.
There, but for Grace, do we go. 

Jack  took his magic top hat off the rack.
He placed it over a pretty old rat
The rat jumped around and around
Jacks friends saw the jumping hat.
Jack said it was magic,  a real magic hat.
Jacks mom came home, she saw the 
Jumping hat, thought it was just a trick. 
How clever Jack must be.
Jack told her it was a magic hat
and went outside to play
Come get your hat  his Mom exclaimed
as she bent down to pick it up.
She saw the rat, her mouth opened wide, 
as she screamed and screamed and screamed.
She fell back on the table, a chair fell over.
Her hand knocked the kettle off the stove.
She tried to get up but kept slipping down
Screaming all the while.
Jack and his friends heard all the commotion
and ran into the woods.
Jacks mom got up made it to the door
slipping again and again, finally fell out the door
onto the wooden steps, losing her footing and 
down she went, down those rugged old steps
falling  to the ground.  She knew they heard
every sound.  Yelling over and over for Jack
to come  home but she never saw his face.
Her heart beating faster and faster as she took
deep breaths trying to contain herself.
Then she began to laugh realizing how foolish 
she must look.  A grown woman afraid of a 
little old rat.  She relaxed and thought, my my
boys will be boys.  She  stood  up and  
brushed herself off, went back into the 
house and thought   I’ll need to find
that rat trap for that big old ugly rat.  She
laughed and laughed and laughed.

The verge of death's grave.

To sleep, weep in the mudded dirt. 
You take away my body’s tattered shirt.

I’m no slave, you wretched tyrant.
You loud- mouthed, fat- bellied master.

It is not you, whom I fear, no. 

He sent me to this troubled land.
To stand  ground, dig deep my soul.

It is he whom I fear  most of all.
Without him, I will never stand tall.

quietly sleeping, in shimmering folds.
No heart to disturb your precious rest, 
I left you lying there in a faded red dress.

Dream my darling dream as only you can
listen to the song birds, hold them in your hand

I’ll take a walk several blocks away, 
When I return we’ll start our day.
beautiful morning, bright and clear, 
a glimpse of your shadow mystically near.

Dream my darling dream as only you can
Listen to the song birds, hold them in your hand

Your body laid still, no breathing came.
Fell to my knees and called out your name.
You left me that morning in a faded red dress.
Dreams of a future never will be blessed.

Dream my darling dream as only you can
Listen to the song birds, hold them in your hand

Now all I have left are the sweet memories, 
of a beautiful woman, who composed my heart.
I cry every night as my hands firmly press, 
the ruffles so sheer, of that faded red dress.

Dream my darling dream as only you can
Listen to the song birds, hold them in your hand. 

A work of art is not shown here, 
She rules the insane in great capacity.
Fearful as it were, her tenacity.

Children make fun at her expense, 
not looking beyond the tattered fence.
What turmoil has befallen this lady.
A cruel offense created her insanity.

She harbors, confused emotions true.
A yard full of things old and new.
cats,dogs an elk or two, 
no, no, this is not the Calgary zoo.

Her mind filled with constant array, 
yard disheveled in loud display.
She defends her right to live this way.
A big ya-hoo, a loud hoo-ray.

The city appears, with disbelief, 
while neighbors peek, across the street.
An order is written, tear it down.
Poor lady wears a hurtful frown.

She obeyed the city’s rule, 
though she thought it very cruel.
Now she harbors thoughts of hate.
Soon she will build a brand new gate. 

The neighbours watched day by day
wondering what was coming their way.
Slowly constructed to great surprise, 
a mish mash of wire, haunted their eyes. 

Surpassing the city’s bylaw in height, 
overlapped wood on wire, a sight.
Enormous structure, extremely tall, 
surely soon to topple and fall.

Passers by look on in dismay, 
shaking their heads while walking away.
A gloomy picture to be sure, 
no real-estate agent would adore.

Neighborhood property value decreased.
Renters will not renew their lease.
A smirk rests upon her soured face, 
she has created a neighborhood disgrace.

Working by night, sleep by day.
creating more fence for morning display.
Neighbors feared facing the morning sun, 
for what this night-worker may have done.

The message she sends is very clear, 
stay out of my life or beware.
Her mind diffused, a complex puzzle.
What comes next could grow and double.

To be continued-


Writen: January row and double it did, 
Costing more than just a few quid.
A massive disheveled confusion, 
certainly not a complex illusion.

The city paid a visit on a bright sunny day.
Poor Mary could no longer have it her way.
Snippers and pliers were put into use.
City’s men working hard to pry the structure loose.

The yard was filled with an eclectic mix, 
like a magician with many hats pulling out tricks.
Umbrella’s, tables, shelf units, wood slabs and more.
oh yes, lets not forget those  rugged old doors.

The neighbors looked on in constant query.
What will happen with good old Mary.
Is this it, will she leave things alone, 
or will she start over when the men go home.

Several days pass, the fence is torn down.
Not a splinter in sight, clear is the ground
The neighbors are worried and await their fate.
What’s in store with the next new gate..

The day of  reckoning  in late afternoon.
A crew arrived, not a moment too soon.
A fence of lattice begins to take shape.
Pleasing to the eye this brand new gate.
Still the neighbors  rest unsure, 
is Mary’s mind now clean and pure.
Only the future will tell, 
for now Mary seems well.

To be continued? ? ? ? ? 

The media have told me
I will die in the next six or seven years
I listen intently
As I will be taken by a tsunami or earthquake.

Will I have time to put the cat out? 
Bring the clothes in? 
Yeah, I'm really bothered
As long as the h avenue up and coming yuppies
Go with me - I will be content.

I look back at my life - I have never had money, 
But just enough to live
And to buy books to increase my swollen collection
I find that I am happy.

I don't walk the street in $suits
A mobile phone glued to my ear.
Italian shoes are not the shoes I wear
Boots and leather jacket.
Come that all fails and I am still alive
I can still spit in the direction of the successful, 
As they will continue to corrupt and pollute the earth. 

Describe fires in riverbottom
sand, and the cooking;
the cooking of hot dogs
spitted in whittled sticks
over flames of woodfire
with grease dropping in smoke
to brown and blacken
the salty hotdogs,
and the wine,
and the work on the railroad.

Falling! !

Falling down, 
In the name of your business.[IT IS NOT A POEM]

[To all my POET READERS ]

My beautiful PINK CITY is tainted RED today
Six or more Serial Bomb Blast ripped through the heart of the city
Ruining the peace of the Historically Royal town
The heritage now turned in a graveyard. 

JAIPUR the capital city of the most peaceful state Rajasthan in INDIA
Became the target of terrorism tolling many innocent lives
The growing Metropolis became the playground of evil forces
My heart broke to watch the heart rendering visuals of the remnants.

I want the support of all my poet readers to condemn this inhuman act
And wish that no evil force should succeed in its aim.

Although I am safe with my family but do not know of so many
All those who are killed or injured were the residents of my city.




Abha Sharma, JAIPUR [ Rajasthan],  INDIA     [h may  pm]. 

Broke away from the shadow and walked closer to the light
Angels standing by now we can afford to fight
Freedom from the disloyal government will be a fee 
They are geniuses of deception far beyond belief

They lock the champions up
Even their brains our handcuffed
Brains swell when fitted in
Darkness in the system has superseded 
No longer can we do sit ins 
We shall overcome through the night 
Cause of our will to bring light 

Our passion for peace is stronger than the governments might 
I’ll look forward to the day the light bleeds through the night
Tasting the lights flavor while dark vapors dissolve 
That’s something everyone has worked hard to achieve can savor


Mercy is not a part of me, soul is burned, but that’s not how deep it gets
A killer in every sense of the word, maybe even a serial killer, I guess the shoes fit
I have left bodies drenched in blood, leaving you bleeding with your ancestors
Your family would never be at peace, like souls, victims of child molesters 
In my mind, I fall eternally into the dark space where I dance with the devil 
I am no angel who heals wounds by any means or with alcohol
Rather drain your body in bathroom stalls, I am sick not mentality there 
Mentally ill I am not looking for remorse, just wish I had a life that was fair 
Wish my life ended, or I was burned literally with a torch
But here on forth, I cleanse my dirty hands, wiped off the dry blood 
Too late, picked up by police and I sung like a bird 
Came to find I was only picked up because of a lot of bad tickets
The cameras of the media took lovely flicks of me getting handed life
Now I lay in this shallow bed, with killers like me and rapist reside 
Couldn’t take it inside, I slit my own atom apple out
World saved from this demon-I deserved it 
Don’t kill, especially if you don’t have the nerves for itmeat body anew

My eyes keep getting misty this winter.
So much quiet cold at night
just to wait for you in the morning.

I am weak 
of the unstable kind. 
My wheels are used up 
but I like the way 
you handle speed
on those secondary roads. 

Please, regulate the mirrors 
and you´ll get a better view 
at the sides.

I´ve always been with you.
I never failed you, 
not even once, 
in spite of that personal way
to drive in the city.

I understand your fear
because you use 
brakes and throtle
in its pace.

I´ve learnt to accept 
you prefer me
to have a smoke- 

I know you can clean up 
the morning frost 
and your coffee smells 
of loneliness.

I like your sensitivity to light, 
you can feel its joy.
I can see it too. 

Taking my body was the first mistake, 
Tearing It apart was the second.
Oh please depression go away, 
So I can be free one day.

Slicing and cutting me wildly, 
The blood flows out, 
As I walk silently, 
I'm asking myself what's it all about

Destroying my heart was the third mistake.
Stealing my soul was the fourth.
Oh please depression go away, 
So I can be free one day.

You laugh at me.
I'm shattered and broken.
You torture me.
My life meaningless and unspoken.

You can't make mistakes again
For I'm blessed with death.
Oh depression you've gone away, 
I also left that very day. 

at the track today, 
each paid admission was 
entitled to a wallet 
and each contained a 
little surprise. 
most of the men seemed 
between and  
going to fat, 
many of them in walking 
shorts, 
they had gone stale in 
life, 
flattened out. . 
in fact, damn it, they 
aren't even worth writing 
about! 
why am I doing 
this? 
these don't even 
deserve a death bed, 
these little walking 
whales, 
only there are so 
many of 
them, 
in the urinals, 
in the food lines, 
they have managed to 
survive 
in a most limited 
sense 
but when you see 
so many of them 
like that, 
there and not there, 
breathing, farting, 
commenting, 
waiting for a thunder 
that will not arrive, 
waiting for the charging 
white horse of 
Glory, 
waiting for the lovely 
female that is not 
there, 
waiting to WIN, 
waiting for the great 
dream to 
engulf them 
but they do nothing, 
they clomp in their 
sandals, 
gnaw at hot dogs 
dog style, 
gulping at the 
meat, 
they complain about 
losing, 
blame the jocks, 
drink green 
beer, 
the parking lot is 
jammed with their 
unpaid for 
cars, 
the jocks mount 
again for another 
race, 
the men press 
toward the betting 
windows 
mesmerized, 
fathers and non-fathers 
Monday is waiting 
for them, 
this is the last 
big lark. 
and the horses are 
totally 
beautiful. 
it is shocking how 
beautiful they 
are 
at that time, 
at that place, 
their life shines 
through; 
miracles happen, 
even in 
hell. 
I decide to stay for 
one more 
race. 

I didn't know I suffered, 
But now I know I do
Can you guess my OCD
Is it plain enough for you

I'm obsessed with post count totals
They haunt me in the night
I even saw my doc who said
You know you're never right

So now I have a number
Of which I'm very proud
It's time for me to make my mark
And stand out in the crowd

The time has come to make a vow
In silence I shall sit
Minutes? Hours? Days? Rejoice
Without my talk of shi.  rubbish

So once again, I cannot bear
To break my row of noughts
Comments now I want to make
Will have to stay as thoughts

Until the mighty task ahead
Has been truly met and faced
Shall I ever post again? 
Or stay in second place



Harmonies of nature 
Parade across the floor
Valiant in this 
Contempo façade of talent.

Delineate verse—from dredged-up seeds, 
Timpani drums accolade the defunct beat.
‘pocalypse fads like Manhattan shoe lines.

Sweetest sunshine stocks the drain, 
Schlepped out by Mexican farm maids—
Still-guzzling the ruse of forsaken muse.

Emotion as common as banal as imitative
As bought-regrets at the liquor federation; 
Teenagers file in with their papered ones: 
"I’ll have a oz of Olde English, bums."The early morning dew caressed  petals
of  garden flowers, allowing them to
hold their tiny heads toward the sky.

I wore the sun as a glove this morning, 
covering my skin with its warm embrace, while
the mist from the garden hose ever so slightly
touched my legs as I watered our beautiful
Flowers.

A sense of tranquility came over me as I
stood there basking in the beauty of the day.
A slight wind touched the back of my neck
and I was sure I heard a whisper say, 
I  love you. 


Woke up this morning, with some more new pains
Getting old really sucks; I hurt when it rains.
You won’t hear me say, "Wow, THAT pain is gone! "
But always just, "Hey, why does THAT now hurt? "

I go off to bed hugging the heating pad, 
Then hobble up the stairs and fall into bed, 
Can’t lay on my side, can’t lay on my back, 
Can’t get straight up right out of the sack.

Not eight straight hours in over ten years, 
What with having to pee and pain in my head
And no rest in my dreams, always bending down, 
Always running and jumping and smelling the flowers. 

I saw my generation
As a glowing sun.
My era and music.
A new start to my life
And death of the old.
Heroes appeared and I hoped
For peace and change
I believed in peace and change.
I was awed by my new leaders
And educated, 
By Robert and Martin.
Them, destroyed by fear and ignorance, 
Fought for change, but never saw it.
Murder by southern mad dogs.
But change came, not what I was looking for, 
Or wanted.
Mans inhumanity to man, 
Runaway progress.
No education learnt by past conflicts.
Wars tired me, racism tired me.
And let the new shining star
In the new house prevail. 

In my dream, 
drilling into the marrow 
of my entire bone, 
my real dream, 
I'm walking up and down Beacon Hill 
searching for a street sign - 
namely MERCY STREET. 
Not there. 

I try the Back Bay. 
Not there. 
Not there. 
And yet I know the number. 
Mercy Street. 
I know the stained-glass window 
of the foyer, 
the three flights of the house 
with its parquet floors. 
I know the furniture and 
mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, 
the servants. 
I know the cupboard of Spode 
the boat of ice, solid silver, 
where the butter sits in neat squares 
like strange giant's teeth 
on the big mahogany table. 
I know it well. 
Not there. 

Where did you go? 
Mercy Street, 
with great-grandmother 
kneeling in her whale-bone corset 
and praying gently but fiercely 
to the wash basin, 
at five A. 

M. 
at noon 
dozing in her wiggy rocker, 
grandfather taking a nap in the pantry, 
grandmother pushing the bell for the downstairs maid, 
and Nana rocking Mother with an oversized flower 
on her forehead to cover the curl 
of when she was good and when she was.  
And where she was begat 
and in a generation 
the third she will beget, 
me, 
with the stranger's seed blooming 
into the flower called Horrid. 

I walk in a yellow dress 
and a white pocketbook stuffed with cigarettes, 
enough pills, my wallet, my keys, 
and being twenty-eight, or is it forty-five? 
I walk. I walk. 
I hold matches at street signs 
for it is dark, 
as dark as the leathery dead 
and I have lost my green Ford, 
my house in the suburbs, 
two little kids 
sucked up like pollen by the bee in me 
and a husband 
who has wiped off his eyes 
in order not to see my inside out 
and I am walking and looking 
and this is no dream 
just my oily life 
where the people are alibis 
and the street is unfindable for an 
entire lifetime. 

Pull the shades down - 
I don't care! 
Bolt the door, mercy, 
erase the number, 
rip down the street sign, 
what can it matter, 
what can it matter to this cheapskate 
who wants to own the past 
that went out on a dead ship 
and left me only with paper? 

Not there. 

I open my pocketbook, 
as women do, 
and fish swim back and forth 
between the dollars and the lipstick. 
I pick them out, 
one by one 
and throw them at the street signs, 
and shoot my pocketbook 
into the Charles River. 
Next I pull the dream off 
and slam into the cement wall 
of the clumsy calendar 
I live in, 
my life, 
and its hauled up 
notebooks. 

In a great deal of discomfort and pain.
having to stand after boarding the train.
I tried to be as pleasant looking as could be.
Didn’t want anyone to realize, 
there was something wrong with me.

Ointments, salve, herb remedies and more.
Nothing seemed to work, from the health store.
I just couldn’t take it any longer, 
had to find something stronger.

Mixed a few items and made a potion.
Wished I had just gone down to the ocean.
An appointment was made with a Chinese Doctor, 
a referral from a very good friend.

His facial expression showed concern, 
He closed his eyes and raised his head.
To my surprise, he smiled and said, 
This area is angry and burning red.

What I have to say to you is simple
and proved to be true.
Bathe the area with running water, 
Come back and see me in seven days.
With this treatment, you will be amazed.

I did just as the Doctor ordered, of course.
His prescription was made very clear.
I continued to bathe the area with water.
No pills, no powders, no cream or oils.

Amazingly, the pain and stinging was gone.
No sign the angry problem ever existed.
This Doctor taught me a great lesson.
Look at what nature has in store, 

The morning sun
finds its way into a room, 
capturing a couple
newly engaged in an act so vivid, 
my pen danced off the page.
I’ll never again intrude
on yesterdays dreams, 
but clearly concentrate
on closing the seams. 

Chorus.—Lassie wi'the lint-white locks,
Bonie lassie, artless lassie,
Wilt thou wi' me tent the flocks,
Wilt thou be my Dearie, O?


NOW Nature cleeds the flowery lea,
And a' is young and sweet like thee,
O wilt thou share its joys wi' me,
And say thou'lt be my Dearie, O.
Lassie wi' the, &c.


The primrose bank, the wimpling burn,
The cuckoo on the milk-white thorn,
The wanton lambs at early morn,
Shall welcome thee, my Dearie, O.
Lassie wi' the, &c.


And when the welcome simmer shower
Has cheer'd ilk drooping little flower,
We'll to the breathing woodbine bower,
At sultry noon, my Dearie, O.
Lassie wi' the, &c.


When Cynthia lights, wi' silver ray,
The weary shearer's hameward way,
Thro' yellow waving fields we'll stray,
And talk o' love, my Dearie, O.
Lassie wi' the, &c.


And when the howling wintry blast
Disturbs my Lassie's midnight rest,
Enclasped to my faithfu' breast,
I'll comfort thee, my Dearie, O.
Lassie wi' the, &c. 

to share a sip of wine, shall we say, 
I don’t want to gloat and 
definitely don’t want to pray, however, 
there are a few words, I would like to say.

Once, I was yours, I’m sure you 
recall,  you threw me from
the heavens, a truly great fall.   
There I will stay to create my own 
worth, loyal followers will come to me
from upon this earth. I have become
powerful now you see, after all, you
created me.

a gift, just for you.  Someone that
thought she would remain true, oh
so true,  yes, true to you.  I took her
You might say, I come bearing gifts
on this  miraculous day.

Oh yes, a beautiful little trinket, and
who would ever think it.  It rested
upon the shoulder of a  former follower
of yours, who fell from your precious 
heaven, right into my coven.  I stripped 
away his heavenly charms.  He’ll follow
me now and help me build my arms.
 

how very smart they are, but only if 
they knew, that I Satan, have you beat
by far.  I’ll wave a chosen wand and
show them all the fun, the gambling, 
drinking, drugs and sex and then they’re
on the run.  I have the tools to tighten
the clasp and this I’m very sure.  A day
will never come to past where they  
would grace your door.


They’re there just for the taking, I know
how to turn them around.  A quiet little
nudge, a pretence of caring, a show of 
the green, a hike of a skirt, a part of red
lips, a look of supple hips.  I know how
to turn them around. A win at the slots, 
a taste of new weed, just plant that seed, a
taste of the fragrance, you know what I
mean.  I know how to turn them around, 
a visit from wild old friends, a cat house
treat, with bare naked ladies standing in
the streets, I know how to turn them
around. Oh yes, I know what they love


My following grows bigger and bigger
every day, take a look at the casino and
watch them play..  I’ve got them where it
hurts, just watch those dumb little jerks.
They’ll play and play, until the dawn, 
then beg of me to carry them on.  A deal 
I’ll put to them of course.  They’ll live
with me and feel the force.  Never to be
recognized again, they’ll cheat and steal
and  deceive family and friends.  I’m
winning, yes indeed, I give them what


concealed under this white cape, is a 
beautiful birdcage with your precious
a loyal follower of yours is a prize
possession of mine, now. Aha, what do
wouldn’t you say.  I’m standing here
with your wee angel on display.  Make
give her back.   What would I want
with someone so foolishly true, oh  yes, 
true to you.


The earth began to tremble, the birdcage
hurled through the air, suddenly an angel
was saintly flying there.  She circled and
circled into the wee hours of morn.
Satan stood  by in disbelief and looked unto 
away, surely he will be seen again some-
day.

always will.  Don’t be afraid to speak his 
Name and act upon his will..  Give
soverign of the universe and the creator
of all.   Fall on your knees and pray, 
Father will you invite me to spend an  ever-
lasting life with you some precious day.

actions show great force.  Build a 
course. 
And whispered in my ears
See your name listed
on top poets.

I couldn't believe
'Is it me I am looking for'

I pinched myself
To see whether I am still alive.
I am happy that somewhere
I will be remembered
That I ever existed.
I wanted to share this happiness with you all
As without you it would not have been possible
As you are my source of inspiration
You are my wings
Which helped me to fly
Which taught me to fly.
Which shaped me to be what I am today
You are strength
It's your motivation reached me here.

I don't know how long I will stay
But I feel one should never miss even a tiny beautiful moment.
This is the tiny unexpected breeze which
Surprised me with its tweets.

I would like to thank each and every one of you from PH..

Thank a lot My Dear Ones! 
I am obliged! ! ! !ver my friend you will always be
and you'll always be the number girl to me
I know we've known each other so long
and the friendship we've built has always been strong
but days go by me wishing that we didn't have such a bond
Cause all the love I feel for you keeps building on and on
I don't want you to think I'm sweating you or I'm like a stalker
I would tell you face to face but I'm really not much of a talker
Maybe it's because you actually count as someone I love
Or just that your a tease sent from below or fallen from above
I understand we don't share the same feelings like the romance
But how can I be judged if you've never given me any chance
Everything I probably said may sound corny or cheesy 
But I really and truly love you hopefully, you'll believe me
If not I really don't care my feelings will never bend
But I'll know everyday of my life you'll be ver my friend


Nothing adorns and decorates
a pewter concrete face.
The Moon shines listlessly
its dim and yellow light 
onto the thoughts that rise
to enter small eternal folds
of cold crevasses, dark.
He pauses by the fields
and ponders life itself.
No lightning strikes, 
no thunder spoils the night, 
and silence reigns
above the mist, 
where human hands just raised
remain unseen.
He feels it now
but knows within his heart
that raindrops bring no joy 
to those who stand alone, 
and words, 
etched into stone
will weather storms
but fade
before forever takes his hand. 

Roosevelt was worth  million dollars
He was Tight

Frog waits
Till poor fly
Flies by
And then they got him

The pool of clear rocks
Covered with vegetable scum
Covered the rocks
Clear the pool
Covered the warm surface
Covered the lotus
Dusted the watermelon flower
Aerial the Pad
Clean queer the clear
blue water

AND THEN THEY GOT HIM

The Oil of the Olive
Bittersweet taffies
Bittersweet cabbage
Cabbage soup made right
A hunk a grass
Sauerkraut let work
in a big barrel
Stunk but Good


You are my Country, 
I shall not want, 
To go back, 
To the nightmare of Tyranny, 
Of yesteryears, 
Come from afar
Still living across the Seas, 

Yes, We Americans, 
We Love Liberty, 
It's our gift to the World, 
It's the brand of our herd.
It's the air that we breathe! 

Even though we walk, 
Thru the valley of Misunderstanding, 
We will not give up! 
We will have no fear, 
Because Liberty Is, 

The h of July Activities
Are something we all enjoy
It’s the one day that’s set aside
For every adult, girl and boy

First we’re honoring our country
With the colors red, white and blue
Brilliant fireworks light the sky
That depicts our freedom pure and true

The entire day is set aside as well
For family and friends to meet
So much fun is had by everyone
That every year it’s a day we repeat

And the food is so delicious
Outside on the summer grill
Along with watermelon and salads
You eat till you get your fill

Flags are flown and waved
To show how proud we are
Of our country strong and beautiful
We have come so very far

And we play games and eat all day
That’s why we love the h of July
It’s the true American way

It’s that time of year again
We’re nearing the h of July
Nothing quite as pretty
As sparks against the sky

And that is what it means
Freedom it represents for us
A day to set aside 
And to make a lot of fuss

We honor our independence
It’s what we have always fought for
And even though it’s never easy
To keep the enemies from our door

So picnics and bar-b-q’s are planned
To celebrate this special day
But stop a moment and remember
The meaning of the brilliant displays

The call went out 
It meant one thing.
Death in the line of duty

Women keen
and Grown men weep
at the loss of youth and beauty.

The empty locker, 
The ownerless gear, 
silence that is a presence.

Brave Liam lies dead.
The fireman’s friend
Pity the parents their loss

The ownerless toys, 
The master less pets, 
How to make sense of it all

The time is  AM and i want to hear the songs of love, 
For the winter cold is gone and the summer heat is in; 
But be on your guard always! 
Because you've promised me your sweet love and, 
I will pay you a surprise visit one day. 

Oil? 
Now sold at what? 
Five dollars a barrel? 
This is an immediate sign, 
That something is not going too well.
Has anyone communicated this, 
To those who chose this direction? 
And they seem to be okay with this decision? 
There just will be more greed.
With those who once had it made in the shade. 
To stand with others who demand to feed their needs.
And you all know how improbable that is going to be? 
Who is going to touch us anyway? 
All Mercedes will be curbed.
And Bentleys will be driven by those deserving.
Well. 
Why the gloomy faces? 
Pass the caviar! 

'Your Highness? 
That was one hundred and five US dollars.'

My god. 
Soon we will build heaven on Earth.
Right here in the desert! 
When you have no clue of who those are
You choose to fight. 
Do not ever pick the ones
To try to trick on their own land! 
You only delay
Displaying yourself the fool.

Enough of this rubbish! 
Where is the imported champagne? 
And raise that to $per barrel.
It belongs to us.
They made this 'their' need.
Do as you please! 
Have the lox and bagels arrived

No doubt the terror was struck on thirteenth
No doubt the innocent lives were snapped
No doubt the widows wailed and children orphaned
No doubt the heritage pink tainted bloody red

But No-Do not catch the off beam
The misconception should never precipitate
No valiant nerves have we ever lost 
By this malicious bleeding frost

The fierce tempest 
Has now blown all fears away
We stand together as we never stood
Fighting the enemy as we ever should


The city will always shine on Tourist map
The globe trotting jewelers will always tap
The innocent sacrifices will never go waste 
The sinners will hereby the hell do taste.





A vote of thanks from the people of Pink City [JAIPUR]
Thanks to the global support which was received from all corners of the world.
Abha Sharma            h May    am. 

Woke up this morning' I was in heaven
'Good Morning Darling' kissing you awake
Your blue eyes open, close, open again
Then you smile at me 'Good Morning Dear'

If this was a weekday
We would hop out of bed, have breakfast, shower and
get ready for work but it's Saturday, and leisure is ours

And even though it's only AM it will only be a matter of minutes
Before one of us gets the other laughing
And then it will be the others turn

Remembering something one of us had said
The giggles in us are set free
And from these giggles, laughter is born
Holding each other, our smiles light the day

Before you,AM was a lonely hour
Lying in bed with nothing but my dreams
Then one day, my dreams came true
Meeting you and falling in love

Now AM is a time to be embraced
Just as I hold you, close and tenderly
Giggling together in the hours before dawn
Starting the day with laughter and love


Amazing people across the globe since folk law and myth matters
Mystifying array of vibrant colors litters the sky with glitters, 
Lent by sun, a gift of wonder is northern lights or Auruoa Borealis, 
Multicolors dawn the sky at the Southern Lights or TAurora Australis 
Count  Auruoa Borealis is one of the natural wonders of the world! 

The Grand Canyon, it's a big hole at Flagstaff in Arizona with soul, 
The mile tear in the earth's crust, a wondrous sight to behold; 
It's cut out through a million year long process by river Colorado 
It isn't a micro hole to see, but catch it by hiking or by a mule.
Count - Grand Canyon is one of the natural wonders of the world! 

The Great Barrier Reef is largest visible object from space on land, 
Made by micro coral polyps beat Great Wall of China, oh nature hails! 
Made up over separate reef systems which forms island
Housing many species,miles long, covers square miles.
Count Great Barrier Reef is one of the natural wonders of the world

A heritage site, Yellowstone National Park thrives in United States, 
If erupts, weather patterns change pushing life on the altar, oh no! 
It can plunge the planet into a ‘small' ice age, oh super volcano,  
Yet it marvels us with lakes, mountains, wildlife,natural mates.
Count - Yellowstone is one of the natural wonders of the world! 

Mount Everest, the tallest mountain survives in High Asia, I tell 
Ranging nearly feet into the air it is close to space shell
million years ago, it formed when the continent Asia hit India, 
It's a spine-chilling terror to climb Everest as fell oh dear! 
Count - Mount Everest is one of natural wonders of the world!

The time has come the speeches stop time for heavenly and demonic warfare
Corpse and fallen ones of slavery, victims, and street rebels all stare
As we take this war to its new threshold all in the golden army care
The fate of the future is in our hands we must overcome 
Must the white house be over run before we are taken seriously? 
Before we do know this overthrowing this system is far fetched hard to see pan out
I know things will take its course we got god on our side we won’t scram out 
We shall then have our country back the world back from the system and the traitors
That rather save their skins and keep their lights on while millions can’t
I know it sounds like I’m ranting but I’m just trying to plant the fruitage  
To increase mind acceleration to get the mind activating so it don’t get exclusive
To the ones that can afford join our battle as well don’t get elusive
Need to know the truth of this vile world 
So our economy doesn’t shrink to the size of a squirrel
They lurk in every borough having their buttons on letting the world go 
Have too many powers and leaves us out of the cold 
Know it sounds bold but there are answers I must know
Before the country folds into a mold of chaos 
Instead I hope our golden army can protect the people 
And force answers out of many for the better for eons to come 
For this must happens till forever begins 
Where all the love can go, be stored, and we can go there to fled 
From your hard bed on earth where souls lay to see blood shines red


The match, 
The football match; 
Playing it once again, 
days after.

The match, 
To score a goal! 
Life, 
Use the adavantage of time for your future.

Muse, 
Mused; 
Works, 
With the understanding of your love.

Poetry! 
With the muse of the match; 
To play it once again, 
days after. 

You ask me what happened all this time.

You arrive. 
The eyes I loved so much 
have an exotic shine.

You smile magic.
Your steps know the dust 
of so many paths. 

What happened to you? 

Failure is an art you ignore.
I learnt it sip by sip.

How many evenings 
did I walk the same streets, 
without you, 
with uncertain rain.  ? 

Not everybody knows
how to find the door
which takes you far, 
love and risk, 
to green pastures 
and shiny streets.

You said life is a liquor
you have to drink fast.

I still see you leaving

There is a higher pleasure, 
deny life, 
walk shady shortcuts, 
disdain love, 
smile in the absence, 
hold the vacuum
and keep going
to that point
which links
light
and darkness.

Version of a poem by Jose Luis Garcia Martin


It was only minutes in your room, 
Then, it left the room; 
For, this bird came through your window! 

Only for minutes, 
Bar, car, tar, far, ear, jar, mar, oar, par, star, war! ! 
But, it exhibited marvellous moves in your room; 
Then, it finally flew out of your room. 

It is almost o'clock, 
And my heart seems to get stuck, 
Already out of luck, 
I whisper, 
Not wanting to go back, 
To what turned all my Summers, 
Into Winter.

The memories of the past, 
The joy that does not last, 
Seem to filter, 
All at once into my heart, 
And slowly there get stuck, 
As the clock strikes o'clock, 
And I whimper. 

It was only 'seconds' left and, 
You were knocked out of the ring! 
And you fell like a dead parrot but, 
My love is still towads you my love. 

Are you standing there with your Doberman pinscher, or is it your shadow? 
Look at this back, it is not what a woman’d look like.
Spring, Autumn, the begotten reasons of my respiration, 
Sweat, woman odour, hairy armpits, I am already forgotten.
I have abandoned all his thoughts; I now despise him at last, 
Ivan is no longer here with me, 
against me he has turned, 
he
they
he 
they, 
who put me in despair, to be wafting at time’s  end? 
My surname for a mask to pretend! 

I have no stand to protest, 
but I will find it, turning my head one hundred and eighty degrees to face you, 
I do see you clearly enough now, 
behind the blurry falling of the eternal sand, 
I know you hold on the lead of time with fierce jaws, dog, 
I know you have that missing minute, Homo Digitalis.Among a family
There is hugging
And caring for each other.

I groom, brush, 
and bathe you
weekly, and take 
you on daily walks

I have you 
In my possession
And my grip on you
will never fade until
your ink runs dry

I Depend on you
While you depend on me
I trust that you'll 
Always be here for me in time
of need
I love you, My Friend

Laying here in your arms 
I feel so comfortable
You save me when 
I'm down and feel bad
You are my 
Other halfh September  
And the flight took me far away; 
h September  
And i made my first millions in life! 
Yes,years after; 
And my savings was enough to build up my dreams. 

The air tonight does not feel right to me
I’m waiting at the door for you
Something inside me doesn’t feel right
All this rain tonight is scaring me to death

The police lights far in the distance
The screaming sounds of their sirens
The faces that could only have one meaning
I never thought you’d leave this place before me

I saw the smashed up car
I saw the blood pools on the asphalt
I saw your lifeless figure lying
I saw myself lying there instead

It’s been years since that tragic night
Our songs I still play daily in my room
I still buy two copies of the records
Placing one in your collection


I’m all alone in this world, she said, 
Ain’t got nobody to share my bed, 
Ain’t got nobody to hold my hand— 
The truth of the matter’s 
I ain’t got no man. 

Big Boy opened his mouth and said, 
Trouble with you is 
You ain’t got no head! 
If you had a head and used your mind 
You could have me with you 
All the time. 

She answered, Babe, what must I do? 

He said, Share your bed— 
And your money, too. 

There goes card Mike
with all he can fight
when he left yesterday
he shoulda went right

And theres card Billy
with card Jack
they both get silly
smokin' that crack

And Alabama Chuck
has been down on his luck
he shoulda played Razz
instead of card Stud

But they all have something in common
when they all pack up and leave-
They never had a clue
while playin' with card Steve, 
that he always had you
with that Ace up his sleeve.
 -Feb.h,'I will kill you like a snake', 
'I will roast you like a chicken', 
'I will fry you like a plantain', 
So roll, roll, roll your boat when, 
You have a killer gun in your pocket.

I was born in the ghetto with, 
The status of poverty without a fish in my hand; 
I was taught in the ghettto with, 
Much tears than hope; 
I was brought up in the ghetto without the Statue of Liberty to salute! 
So roll your boat with the gun in your pocket; 
But, who is there to cover up your actions? 

I was taught in a mud-house without slippers on my feet! 
And, that's the kind of society i cam from; 
I had my education on the streets with, 
Fights, hunger and starvation to crown the day! ! 
But, your killer gun in your pocket will give you up one day.

Taught by the streets, 
Lived by the streets, 
Learned by the streets, 
Loved by the streets, 
Hated by the streets, 
And, many of us married by the streets; 
The cluster of a phobia into my maturity, 
That is why i do not respect the gun in your pocket today.

Stealing and looting! ! 
With plans to make the next move, 
And, as a human-being who lives on Cent a day. 
Life in the ghetto, 
With the status of poverty without a fish in my hand; 
Life to me was just like the mountain of snakes, 
So, just roll your boat with merry on your face.

Life's fair fountain that eluded me! ! 
With stealing and looting as the order of the day; 
And of the plans to make it work.
I was just living on Cent a day, 
And, joy to me was like the roasting of a chicken; 
Hope to me was like the killing of rabbits! ! 
Peace to me was like the frying of plantains; 
And, of an excellent value for many of us when one dies, 
But were still mulling to make a case like a courageous leader. 

To live on Cent a day in the ghetto! ! 
With the muse of the cluster of a phobia into my maturity; 
Life in the ghetto, 
Life on the run with the bullet train! 
But at times, it was like the straw on a camel's back. 
Life in the ghetto, 
Like the golden cup whose shock aroused! ! 
When one equals to a temper of heroic hearts; 
With the negatives to meet all day Long. 
Life in the ghetto, 
Like half-naked Young Lovers who called for help! 
Life in the ghetto, 
Like the peace of one's mind with questions to the moon; 
But all along, i have managed to live on Cent a day. 

Psychiatrist: So tell me how you felt when you first met. 
Kid: I was dazzled by the selection and constant connection
Psychiatrist: A permanent connection in your life
Kid: My life surrounded by constant quarrels
Psychiatrist: You could only see it spiral, therefore wanting something you could control
Kid: Yes, something to make me feel whole
Psychiatrist: Go on
Kid: Though we don't really talk, it talks to me
Psychiatrist: For you this is real? 
Kid: Totally as it listens to me, never conceals
Psychiatrist: You become the big deal? 
Kid: It is here just for me, which makes it all seem real
Psychiatrist: How do your parents feel about this relationship? 
Kid: Sick and say I am addicted, they are just wicked

A year old man raped a year old girl, 
And the volatility of this case matters to me; 
But i will rather rest my head on my pillow and sleep.

One step for a man through the narrow gate, 
And related o the scrutinized facts on the table; 
But my head is still resting on my pillow because of, 
The dangerous misconception of the higher ranks.

To mutter or not to, 
And grapping with the facts like the rainbow; 
But what is this world up to

November twenty Second
Fifty Years onyears on this physical earth, 
But husting and busting to make my name known t the world!! 
Because, i have a message at hand; 
And, it is not easy being born in Africa and being raised in Africa from a very poor family! 
For, i can't stop the rain from falling on my head when, 
I have no roof!!! 
And like what is going on today in East Africa! 
With the reflections of one of my Art Works called: 'We don't have aids but hunger'! ! 
Yes, from the very acts of my mind; 
Because i am an African, 
And i do know what it means to be in Africa.

Today, i am to thank Father Yahweh for all of His mercy and kindness towards me; 
For He had really guided my steps from thr rough paths of an African's own story, 
And, let His Mercy endures forever!! 
For Africa is for the Africans and we have to know what goes on around us everyday; 
And, in the land of Africa i was born, 
But, have you to say?!! 
Because, i am very proud to be an African! 
And like the muse of your love in the land of many waters that satisfies us all.lashes for an Egyptian Doctor! 
For he was found alone with a woman in a room in Saudi-Arabia; 
And the 'Sharia-law' went against him.
The Egyptian Doctor was laid down and was given lashes! ! 
But in this life, one should always take along the weather with him or her, 
For there are different laws in different countries as you visit along! 
Because, what you throw alway into your dustbin is someone's gold.

'Yes', she uttered.
It was  home turf, 
when standing, tipsy
on the muddy banks  
of our river, 
by name of Schwalm, 
when she, with sudden
and so unexpected, 
but very welcome, 
and hoped for, 
dreamed about, 
though feared, 
initiative, and courage, 
and all but shunning
all that which was, 
well, after all, 
a woman's place
in modern times.
Still needed to
be more conservative
than any man.
By country mile, 
and more, of course.
So, now she had, 
while we were kissing
with eyes tight shut 
in paradise
of overflowing
yet immature
and innocent
demeanour, 
slipped one sly hand
where normally
the sun don't shine
and no one visits.
'Jeesus


that's what I mumbled, 
we stood like that
until the time
of Bliss was done.
I do not think 
that it will ever
return to us
yet memories, 
they surely must
cross over .
I would not want  
 to enter Heaven
without it, 
no,  the preciousness
shall be with me
beyond today
beyond all worlds. 

Version One
============

A Rose is not a Rose without the thorns, 

You have a full life and share of thorns, 

The beauty of a rose will fade in time, 

Beauty may fade but wisdom matures like wine.
-

Version Two
===========

A Rose by any other name, 

Would just sound so tame.

Such beauty is the Rose, 

Even with thorns, it shows.


Another year has passed

You have passed your test

A clean bill of health

is important than wealth.

For when you have your health

You can then build your wealth

A long breath of accumulated years
Has sustain each day as lives veered
Taking pathways to the unforeseen
Following fragrant flowering dreams

Our fiftieth class reunion marks the occasion 
How has distance altered the equation? 
Smiles abound with freely given embraces
Recognizable voices give light to familiar faces

Amazed by high school sweethearts still together
Married all these years-reflecting one another
Conversations revolve on the harmonious carousel 
Past and present unite and simultaneously dwell

Sharing talk of whereabouts and growing families
Sharing blessings as well as overcoming tragedies
Attentively listening as seasoned old friends narrate
Remembering with a tribute-departed classmates 

All united under the canopy of a vast star lit sky 
Reminiscing joyfully before former teens say goodbye
As I drive home- youthful voices resound in my mind 
Suspended in a moment of time-where age is not defined

& wash us from our sinn
Cleanse us from wicked deeds without
from wicked thoughts within
that I against thee doe
Each minute they're before my face
& wound my soul anew
So Great my god my ills have been
Gainst thee & onely thee
Thy Justice tho' I were Condemnd
would good & righteous bee
For att my birth I wickedness
Did with my breath suck in 
But thou shalt teach me in thy ways
& keep me pure from sinn
Thoult me with hyssopp purge who am
all over soil's & stain's
Thou with thy sanctifiyng grace
shalt wash & make me clean
Thoult bless my days with peace no sound
But Joy shall reach mine ear
There Gladness may appear
Blott from thy thoughts past faults & from
The present turn thy face
O make my spirit right & good
Confirm my heart with grace
thy Presence & thy mercy lett
Me ever Ld possess
Me with the comfort of thy help
& with thy love still bless
Then shall the wicked know thy pow'r
& turn ym from theyr wayes
Deliver me from blood my god
& I will sing thy praise.
Unseal my lips & to ye Bad
I will thy mercy shew
For since thou lovest not sacrifice
Tis all that I can doo
A heart that is with sorrow pierct
this is ye sweetest offering
that we to thee can give
On Sion Graciously look down
Preserve us still we pray
Instead of beasts we'el Lay. 

Eat, neat! 
Some people will love you in this world and, 
Others will hate you.

But, some people will love you in this world and, 
Others will hate you.

I'll aye ca' in by yon town,
And see my bonie Jean again.


THERE'S nane sall ken, there's nane can guess

She'll wander by the aiken tree,
When trystin time draws near again;
And when her lovely form I see,
O haith! she's doubly dear again.
I'll aye ca' in, &c. 

Bring me to water, 
I refuse to drink.
It doesn’t matter who you are
nor what you think
I make all my own decisions
right or wrong.
My mind is set and very strong.
Don’t waste your time with me, 
for can’t you see.
I’m in charge of my own destiny.

It was a rather quiet day, I had a few things to do in order to prepare 
for tonight’s jewelry party.  I started out to get my 
errands done, giving myself enough time to get home to start the
preparations for the event.  I made a list, had everything in order, 
oh yes I was totally organized.  The caterer was arranged (my 
wonderful daughter-in-law) .  She was an excellent caterer, she 
catered for my husbands celebration of life and our church ladies
prayer group, so I had every confidence in her.

I picked my daughter- in- law up at work at approximately  m, the
party starts at  pm, so time is going.  Oh oh we don’t have a 
babysitter for my two grandchildren, that’s OK, I’m sure they will
be just fine.  We drove home, I had some cleaning to finish up, so 
I tried to get to it, my grand-daughter had other plans and I spent 
a lot of time talking with her, getting her toys and trying to explain
why she couldn’t watch TV.  Whoops not a good idea, she began to
cry.  I’m getting anxious now, not being able to do what I had on my
list, my timing is now off.  The telephone rings, an apology from 
one of my guests, she can’t make it, no problem, I’ll have tea with
her tomorrow and tell her all about it.  I tried to get off the phone, but
you know the type, they want to talk and talk even though they know
you are getting ready for a party.  Finally I have to say, sorry Jean, I
really have to go now.  I no sooner hung up, the phone rang again, 
another apology, I quickly got off the phone.  Just then my daughter-in
law (Johanna)      remembers to call her two friends who wanted to come
to the party, they didn’t have the address.  I still havn’t started the
cleaning I had to finish yet.  Her friends have no idea how to get to
my house, so I now have to take time out to give them directions.  My
blood pressure is rising, I can feel it, my head is hot and my heart is
beating faster and faster, I have to finish that cleaning.  

The doorbell rings, oh my gosh it’s the jewelry lady, she arrived a 
little early, only by a few minutes, I’m really behind.  Oh for heavens
sake I have to go to the LRT and pick up John and Derek, they’ll be
waiting for me.  I have to go, the jewelry lady wants to use the 
kitchen table to display her jewelry, the caterer says no way, I need
that table.  Earlier we set two round tables in the living room for
Delores, she’s not pleased with that due to poor lighting.  I promise
her I will get her some good lighting when I return.  I’m running’
around like a chicken with my head cut off.  I ran off to the van, 
Jumped in, I’m out of breath, thinking to myself-what did I get myself
into, I’ll never do this again.  Oh heck, I didn’t finish the cleaning, ah
forget it, who cares anyway, just me.  Trying my best to keep to the
speed limit, off I go to pick up the boys.  I arrived at the LRT at   
I told them to meet me there at that time.  No Derek and John in sight.
I’m now having an anxiety attack, holding my chest and breathing
deep breaths.  Where are they, this is not like them at all,  one train
comes, no boys, oh no now I have to wait for another train, that’s
going to be another minutes.  I’m thinking about the light for
the jewelry lady (Delores) .  What to do, Oh I know, I’ll call home
and ask my daughter (Melody)      to go downstairs to her brothers
room and borrow his tall lamp, excellent light for that. I made the
call, Melody is a little hesitant because brother John doesn’t like
anyone in his room, especially when he is not home.  At this point, 
I don’t care, so I say, just get it OK and she agrees to do that.  Finally
I see the boys, they’re walking quickly to my car, I put on a happy
face and greet them.  Explaining that they missed the train, I assured
them, everything is fine, not to worry about such things, we’ll be
in time for the party.  Kind of hidden truth, I’m really dying inside
with worry about what is going on without me there.

We arrive back at the house, the lamp is plugged in, nice bright 
light, Delores is smiling, my grandson is in his big brothers room, 
wanting to play with the playstation or the game cube, but big 
brother Dylan is not home and the rule is, no one plays unless he
Ii there.  I had to explain that to Ariel and he wasn’t happy, but 
he settled for TV, thank goodness.  I checked the kitchen and 
Johanna is not happy with the way the stove is heating, she said
it’s not heating mama, I assure her that it’s just fine and the bell
will ring when it reaches the right temperature.  She’s not 
patient and doesn’t believe me.  The next time I go in the kitchen
I noticed the heat is up to degrees instead of  oh well, I’m
sure she knows what she’s doing and I let it go.  The food is
smelling good, everything looks good, the table is decorated 
lovely, all is well.  Most guests have arrived except  Johanna’s
friends, they were a little lost, but I spoke to them and they were
just around the corner, within seconds they were at the door.  My
friend Sue and her husband Ray came in the front door.  In all the
years I’ve lived in this house they never used the front door.  I had
forgotten about our dog Blaze who was now locked in the back
yard, hopefully away from our guests.  He is a very friendly black
Lab and likes to jump on everyone.  I noticed my friend Betty in
the living room with one of her Korean students, they looked 
lovely.  Someone mentioned "Is something burning"  I assured them
no, of course not, as I turned and went into the kitchen and saw
the smoke, shortly thereafter the smoke alarm went off.  Johanna
is sweating and her broken English, tries to assure me everything is
fine, she opens the oven and the spring rolls are burning, oh my 
gosh Johanna, why is the heat so high, I quickly turned it down to
like I should have done earlier.  Johanna is beside herself and
her daughter is running all over the place, of coure that’s my grand-
daughter Tahara, but when she’s bad, I refer to her as Johanna’s 
daughter.  LOL.  All the guests are running into the kitchen to see
if everything is OK, all offering advice, my goodness, what is going
on here  Ray quietly says to me, "havn’t you ever had a jewelry party
before, I look at him and laugh.  Derek brought a carrot cake that he
made and wants to display it on the table, that’s his only concern
beside the fact that he’s also concerned about our cat Tiger, you see
he’s allergic to cats, my gosh, what’s next.  

All of a sudden I heard the back door open, I yelled please don’t let
the dog in. Oh dear, it was too late, Blaze came bursting in like a 
lightening bolt, no stopping him.  He headed for the jewelry lady
and stood up on his hind legs, she was trying to write up an order
and stood her ground while oohhhhing, only a slight fear of the dog
as he peered into her face, about inches away from her face.  The
Korean girl (Stelly)      screams, jumps up from the couch, runs to the
bathroom and locks herself inside,  I grabbed Blaze by the collar 
and gave him a talking too, he didn’t like that, so he quickly 
turned his body, hitting me in the back of my legs taking my legs
out from under me and down I went, in my beautiful long dress, it
felt like I was floating down, Ray tried to get to me, but was too
late and everyone else was stunned, jumping up asking me if I was
OK.  My concern was, how will I get up and where is that crazy 
dog.  My knees won’t work.  Ray took my right arm and Claudia
tood my left arm and they lifted me up, it was easier than I thought.
Spinercize class is working after all.  I got up, couldn’t stop 
laughing, what a fiasco this turned out to be.  Everyone after
realizing I was OK had a good laugh.  Finally the food was ready 
and we all headed for the kitchen forgetting about the jewelry.  
The poor jewelry lady was alone in the living room, we told her to
come and have something to eat, she did.  

I announced shortly after, well I must go in the living room and 
order some jewelry, everyone followed.  Delores was happy, what
we didn’t know was while all of this was going on.  John was in 
my bedroom on the computer ordering what he wanted from 
Delores’s website, so she was making sales afterall, a very nice
sale I might add.  Everything settled down after that, the party was
a success, good sales and two bookings for more parties,  Delores 
was happy and gave me a beautiful watch for having good sales
and bookings, I couldn’t believe that we actually found time to 
order jewelry after everything that was going on.  Tahara continued
to run around looking at the jewelry, hugging Stelly, she just loved
Stelly..  All and all it was a good party, lots of fun and lots of 
laughs.  Lets see what happens next year, maybe a little less food.




miles south of modern Baghdad, 
Visit me with the wings of love! 
For the bombs are now falling on my head, 
And i need you to take me home safely. 

Lying still in a hospital room, surrounded by family, tears flowing, 
faces saddened.  At the end of my bed stood a tall, slender lady 
with beautiful features.  Her skin, the look of velvet, with royal
eyes, rosy cheeks and lips.  Angelic, the most beautiful woman, I 
had ever seen.  She beckoned with her right hand to come.  The
pain immediately left my body.  I was pain free for the first time in
many months.  My body totally relaxed as if to sink within itself.  
In a euphoric state I realized this must be the end, fear was non-
existent.  I was filled with happiness.  My time had come, time to
say good-bye to my loved ones and move on to a better life.  It is
not the bitter end, we will meet again in paradise.

My body supine, eyes gazing in mystical space.  It is then when my
spirit rose, soaring with grace among the stars.  In the distance
musical sounds of harpsichords play, creating an angelic aura, 
blissful existence.  Immersed in a state of tranquility, my spirit
evolved.  Dancing from illuminating star to illuminating star.  I
took my place as an angel with wings of enormous measure.

Looking down at my loved ones, watching them cry, wail, scream, 
holding on to one another.  My sadness was with them, for them, 
for they know not how truly happy I’am.  I must find a way to
communicate with them.  To let them know, the tears and sadness
must end.  I want them to celebrate my leaving and rejoice with a
celebration of life, for I’m blessed with total freedom.

I gave them  a scent of beautiful flowers, which filled the room
with an aroma of lilies, roses, fuchsia, alstromeria, a wonderful
mix of all my favorite flowers.  The crying instantly stopped, 
they looked at each other as the tears turned to joy with the
realization I was there, letting them know, all is well and I’m
truly happy.  They know now that I have moved on to a better
life, an everlasting life.  Oh yes, my loved ones will miss me and
shed a tear every now and then.  A sense of peace will cover them
though as they recall the beautiful scent of flowers on my final
day.

When the scent dissipated, my family knew, I was no longer there.
My spirit moved on and all that was left on the bed was my earthly
shell.  They slowly turned and walked out of the room.  I knew all
was well with them.  My new life begins.

ran wild, endless thoughts from the beginning of my life to the end and
beyond.  My eyes opened wide as I lay in a pre slumber state.  The
most amazing  vision unfolded right before my eyes, clouds began to 
move in every direction, a kaleidoscope of colors  burst into view. The
clouds descended to the earth floor gently creating forms. I
couldn’t believe my eyes, a stairway took form, at the top of this
remarkable stairway, clouds began to dance and take on more shapes.
Yes shapes of Angels and instruments, harpsichords, violins, trumpets
and more.  The Angels took their instruments and began to play, oh the
music was a beautiful setting, a serene, peaceful atmosphere, filled with
tranquility.  My body felt weightless, relaxed, a euphoric feeling yet
I was wide awake now taking in all the beauty of this tremendous
display of heavenly works.  At the bottom of the stairway, I saw a
mist like shape taking form in a long line, soon this shape took on 
other forms, yes forms of people were all in a line.   They glowed and
sparkled in their beauty, covered in silvery white shimmering folds    
of crystallized tulle. At that point I realized, these were the people
who had just passed on and they were going toward the stairway to
start their journey up  to Heavens gate.  The Angels soared above
them as if counting them to make sure they were all there.  Hovering
over them, continuing to play the most beautiful  music ever to
be heard.  One by one each person lifted their hands up high as they
started up the stairway, then a light at the top of the stairs shone, the
brightest light you ever did see.  As each person reached the top of the
stairway, they disappeared into the light.  When the last person reached
the top, the Angels gathered and they slowly faded into the clouds. The
stairway also faded away and the clouds took their place back high in 
the sky.  My body began to shake as the heavenly spirit took over.
I stood up and raised my arms to the heavens and prayed out loud to
and continued  to pray as I’ve never prayed before. The tears ran down my
face as I laughed and bathed in the essence of his glory.  This was one
is not to be feared, it sends you on the path to heavens stairs and a way
To plant the seeds in the landscape of my mind, therefore I will have
no fear, no despair, no hesitation, I will not try to hang on here by 
the use of human mechanics.  I will graciously move forward and 
take my place at the bottom of heavens stairs and await my turn to
take that final walk, up those glorious stairs to the light of heavens
for this remarkable vision.

I stood at the  hilltop and was in awe while standing there.
In the distance a rainbow formed, colors beautiful and bright.
I was amazed at this extraordinary awesome sight.

I see mirrors within the still waters, a half moon toward the sky.
I see shadows of large creatures  gliding slowly by.
The colours are vivid with  tints of periwinkle blue, 
and vibrant dashes of mauve  sparingly coming through.

A lip formation of moss resting upon a soft face of sand, 
sending showers of heavenly tears to all with his love.

The vast ocean resonates  with tranquil, serene peace, 
yet powerful enough to devour the largest of all beasts.

You don’t know whom you’re dealing with, 
when you start to mess with me.
I’m your worst enemy, with me you’ll never be free.
I’ll chew you up, spit you out, never blink an eye.
You’ll crawl and you’ll beg, you will surely cry.
I’ll hit you and cut you, kick you in the groin
then call  the police emergency line.
To them I’ll say you hit me, push me to the ground.
My little jackass, those dumb cops will believe every sound.
I’ll wrap them around my finger and cry like a baby.
They will do whatever they can for sweet little me.
You see, I’m the weaker sex.
When the judge hears my story, to jail you go, I’m in my glory.
So run like a dog, fearful, confused knowing you’re 
going to jail, maybe make the evening news.
My story believed by many except a few.
Who cares about them, they’ll never stand up for you.
You see, they are smart, the children they will not see
if they dare to confront me.
Their tongues will be silent like scared little lambs, 
for fear the grandchildren may be taken out of their hands.
I’ll play them like puppets, your loyal family.
They know better than to deal with me.
The police will hunt you down wherever you go, 
when they pick you up, maybe give you a few blows.
You dumb little ass, I’ll laugh in your face.
Next time, you better know your place.
I want to know wherever you’re going any time day or night.
The cell phone you carry always kept in your sight.
Never speak to any other woman, keep your head to the ground.
If I see you, I’ll break your F- crown.
I’m in control, I always will be.
With me you’re stuck, we have a family.
No problem just do what you’re told, all will fine, 
Just remember, never step out-of-line.

They call me
"JEALOUSY"



This piece may seem absurd to you, but believe me it happens.  The law stands with the woman. A loving caring father will 
never walk away for fear of losing his children.  To the men
that end up with these crazy ladies, you must find a way out.
To stay in a situation like this is very difficult for the children.
Seek counseling, do whatever it takes, you must walk away
before one of you breaks.

Believe me, these ladies exist, you may know one or two.  Are 
you the type that laughs when you see your friends bruises or
a cut between the eyes.  It’s not a laughing matter, your friend
is suffering in silence for fear of telling his story, after-all he is
"THE MAN" and of course we all know, men don’t hurt, men 
don’t cry and certainly men don’t feel.  If you believe that then
you’re a fool.

Remember this is my opinion only, I’m not a psychiatrist, I’m 
Just a loving grandmother. 



Father I pray for the gays and lesbians, for the  trans sexuals, tri sexuals, A- sexuals and more.  I pray Father that they will someday be able to walk through the churches of straight people and not be shunned or chastised, but respected as people and allowed to live their lives.

Father I pray that these people who contribute to the well being of this earth, stay out of harms way, and be allowed to show their worth.  It's clear to see that you love them in the same way, for your gifts to them are precious and real.





 Walking  barefoot  in the sand  
basking in the early morning sun,   
I felt at peace with the stillness of 
a quiet Sunday. Enjoying my surroundings   
and the warmth of the day
My senses  peaked by a faint scent    
of  fish  filtering through the air.  The feel
of a slight drizzle  touched my nose every
now and then.  I felt the grit of the sand
giving my feet  natures gentle massage  
and enjoyed every step of the way. 
The sea breeze caressed my naked body, 
offering me  a feeling of tranquility.  This is
my place, my special place, alone at       
peace with nature, enjoying every moment, 
The sand dollars  and starfish were plentiful
and strategically laid along the shoreline, 
natures free gifts from the ocean.  An artistic
design placed on each sand dollar and only 
nature can take the credit for its beauty  A
smile came on my face and at that point I
realized how blessed I was to be here this
day in this place at this time.  Another  
treasured and a created memory to place  
in my heart.
 
but there is a way to keep them from growing fast or slow.

Cancer is an enemy we don’t want to see, 
our plan must be to eradicate completely.

Let’s take it step by step to see what we can do, 
get rid of that cancer, out of me, out of you.

Say good-bye to sugar, a  big old cancer feeder, 

Throw away that table salt, it harbors a chemical to make it white.
Bring out Bragg’s aminos or sea salt to keep it right.

Milk, a source of  calcium we know, but in a cancerous body, 
helps the big "C" to grow and grow.

Milk causes the body to produce mucus, a cancer feeder.
Say good-bye to regular milk and invite soy milk to meet her.

All substitutes used, must be unsweetened of course, 
now let’s move on to get  the final course.

Meat is a culprit, beef and pork, 
eat fish, and a little chicken of sorts.

Cancer loves acid, so alkaline we must go, 
I’m here to help you, let’s get on with the show.

Make up your diet of  fresh vegetables and juice, 
throw in some whole grains, seeds, nuts and a little
fruits.

Take the other  and cook up some good food, now
don’t forget those beans, they’ll keep you on the groove.

Here’s the kicker, don’t you forget it.
if you don’t have a juicer, go on out and get it.

Juicing is the answer to a mean old cancer story, 
fresh vegetable juices will bring us to glory.

Live enzymes will appear, reaching deep down to
to the core, where cellular levels  are there for sure.

It only takes a few minutes to do the work, so what are we
waiting for? Hurry! ! ! Let’s go down to the grocery store.

No more coffee, no more tea, no ouch! no more chocolate? 
not for me, cause I’ve got to get rid of the big "C".

Green tea to the rescue, I know that’s good for me, filtered
water is a must, you’ll see.

Some supplements are key and the body reacts favorably, 
building up the immune system which we all want to see.

Don’t forget to keep yourself moving, exercise has its part, 
giving you strength and a very strong heart.

Now you must do the research to see what works best for you.
Do it right, think smart, now you can start.

Keep a clear head, have a positive view, negativity has no place
around you.

Keep in mind, you walk in your own shoes and no one knows 
your body as well as you do..

Adrift you come to take a peak.
Tis June the month you do embark, 
I long to see your body stark.

Fair mermaid of the golden sea, 
why do you bless the likes of me.
Mine eyes are full of radiant pleasure.
What say you your body measure

Luminous eyes seek a miracle,     
lying still on earths great circle.
I beg of you fair mermaid.
Feast your eyes on the likes of me.

Your tail of iridescent treasure, 
glistens like glitter from the jeweled sky.
Fair mermaid please don’t pass me by.
A paradox is your faithful dominion

You can’t be who you seem to be.
Nestled upon the shore.
Feast your eyes on the likes of me.
I’ll rest here with you for evermore.

I have not had dry feet in two weeks
Dreams of feather comfortors
And endless sleep
Are shattered from the thunder of guns
And the shouting of the sergeants

My pal known to me from god knows when
Wants to give me his watch and letters
' Just in case '.
I wonder if he should have my effects? 
I am standing right next to him.

I press my forehead to the muddy ditch
And wonder what patriotic speech
And pipes and drums got me here.
I must be a puppet, a sheep or just stupid.

The whistle screams and the roar of the men
Propels me over the ditch
I don't hear gunfire in this hellish noise
But a third of my platoon
Pitch forward on their knees
I cannot see my friend
Nor do I see the machine gun round
That enters my chest, and smashes my spine
I feel no pain
But I fall crying for what I am going to lose
For my sister, who at this moment
Does not anticipate my end
In the filth and stink of the Somme. 

I keep dreaming of horsemen
waiting for me in the distance.

Some remember the days
of false gardens
when they loved 
or thought they did.

Others the books they read
life long companions
to forever lose the thread.

Memory can be molded at will  
and then give
what book, garden and love
denied.

I remember things 
I never did, 
the battles I never 
fought.

To Julio Martinez Mesanza


I knew I was something special ever since I look through my dim belly button window 
I can feel those in pain the fact that music and poetry is used to express ones acid rain
When I grew up far beyond my years was able to stabilize my mind and realize my fate 
Though the spray paint and pepper spray blinding my race 
We can’t blame the other race must become one face 
And watch our actions there is a thin line between love and hate 
You visualizing bad thoughts toward your foes is not thoughts one should make
Why unite a race for unity let’s unite the entire United States
Is that too far fetched a dream one couldn’t create? 
Like a poet said we our the slaves and the master
I can only hope my race and the unity of the world could grow faster
The poet also fed me that we our the question and the answer 
The question is there lying dead in the face of the answer 
That could be everlasting till hope comes in the tales of forever begins
Salvaging souls, killing hate, recreating the joy love can make 
My bro once said that false propaganda provokes our sins
How can you blame them when self hatred is beneath our skin? 
No longer do we need our fins for stability 
We can now search for a better place forever begins not in infinity 
The earth will not grow stale and weary won’t be any dry tears
I have to make a difference for me and all my peers


Winter! 
Snow, 
-degrees in the cold; 
Seen in your land today, 
When i am sweating over here in Africa! 

I´ve discovered angels
in her look. 

Their moves reveal them too, 
unmistakable steps 
towards those who need them, 
clean eyes, 
untouched by fear, 
without resentment. 

Why are you close to me? 
What´s your message? 

We might have a message to deliver. 

Perhaps I can´t feel my wings. 
Perhaps I can´t get out 
of  these soulless places. 

Words of hope, 
a place for you, 
where soft steps 
make sense. 

Wings to fly at ground level. 

Walking some days
the light of the plains shines.
A fresh wind blows over the green wheat
and the greyhounds come running to me, 
riding on my bike
A lonely and happy boy.

There are days when time flies back.
My bike does not move forward any more
and the greyhounds look at me in the distance.
They don´t get close to see me coming back.
I am not alone any more
and the mountains hide the light of the plains. 

How cautious is the wind
when it carries
outspoken sounds
across the vast plains
of my thought? 

Your debris of the day
blasts me full on
with its rhetoric, 
leaving me breathless.



My esteemed reader
Warm greetings welcome you
But ah! Something is missing
It should be between us
Yes


here it comes! 
Say 


Cheese
. ‘CLICK’

The distance between us now erased
With your flexing muscles, 
Your beauty enhanced
With this gesture’s blaze.

What do we lose? 
With a little stimuli, 
The earth becomes heaven 
With your sweet smile.

Your eyes sparkle
And love does bloom
Wrinkles delayed
Happiness makes room.

A Smile is a pleasure 
A Smile is an honor
Pluralism has no space
Serene Notions stimulate. 

I keep dreaming of horsemen
waiting for me in the distance.

Some remember the days
of false gardens
when they loved 
or thought they did.

Others the books they read
life long companions
to forever lose the thread.

Memory can be molded at will 
and then give
what book, garden and love
denied.

I remember things 
I never did, 
the battles I never 
fought.

To Julio Martinez Mesanza


To the chosen, 
Those of evil stare, 
Who spread weeds, 
And administer venom, 
Those who hide the keys, 
And water misery, 
Who cut grass
Before it grows, 
Dark hate reapers, 
Those who trace  talent
To wipe out its footsteps, 
Winners in the rat race, 
adapted survivors
who establish beaten tracks, 
those who hide their truth 
in the fear they inspire, 
always getting rot, 
to you, scum. 

All alone, i hide in lies. 

Humanity's epoch lives in dreams evermore


Her jocand company was he
 Going back in a vacant mood
 . 

For good! Knowing sweet promises broken 
. Faithful love no more
 Burnt core! .  .. 

Said- no more- Knoweth that beauteous morning


No quetch from my side
 Sure, I can’t let my love spotted impure-Wishes mine not immix
 I am a phoenix--! 

Her serene eyes tearful
 Never thought-


Would be painful so


Said- don’t go


Dear! do not let me. ! She is in sahara desert alone ah
. Said- I know I did wrong--Even so you are my song
 whimsically I stood against my conscience
 Yes, knoweth that beauteous morning


Above all


You are loved by me--Come back my Love! 

A  forlorn -


Period of turbulence send out lesson- Treasure of love gone
. 

So mourn---Forlorn! 

The poet said-
Emblem she emblem he emblems the universes are
Things all blessed by, remember, so put out the fire.
Nothing but love reflect, o friends, get your point higher.

Is what we chiefly need
A glass of wine a wedge of cheese
Is very good indeed
And now - if you are ready friends
We can begin to feed.

Up spoke Amed - What kind of bread
Naan - Pita or Chappati? 
For breads are different - just like cars
And mine's a Masserati! ! ! 
When all is said bread is just bread
Said Angela and Patti.

Like cheese is cheese? - asked Angelise
But not in france of course
But your French Bread goes hard - said Fred
And all of you eat horse.
I like Brioche - said Angelo
With Palma Ham of course.

I can accept - said Angela
That cheeses come in types
And also wines form different vines
Their grapes so sweet and ripe.
But bread's just flour and water mixed
And left to rise - near the hot pipes.

Nein saght Hans - das ist so nicht
Ich lieber Pumpernickel 
Das ist der brod - ich hat gepickt
Weiz copt mit meine sichel
Ich koct dem in mein brodofen
Und mache Pumpernickel.

I'm so confused siad Paddy Bewes
I just want a Butty
A slice of Irish Soda Bread 
With Galaway Cheese and Chutney.
This talk of Matzo and Lavash
It really sounds quite smutty.

No doubt with Stout? - asked Fredrico
We all like Ethnic Food
I Lisbon - Portuguese Sweet Bread
With Serra Cheese is good.
With Vihno Verde and aluvas
Portugeses - love their food! ! ! 

So next time that you buy your bread
Remember to be choosy
Ask for Zopf and Pondoro
Or Beer Bread - it's quite boozy.
And eating bread with Poppy Seeds
Can make you feel quite woozy! ! ! 

So never take your loaf for granted
'Cos just like cheese and wine
Bread's a many splendoured thing 
Choose carefully when you dine.
A Crusty Cob with Campbell's Soup
And Wholemeal Toast with mine! ! !     

For all who seek to live
Of all the food that passes lips
This has the most to give.
And when we from our Mothers feed
Her milk provides our every need.

The milk of cows and goats and sheep
Sustains us in our later life
An elixir before we sleep
It calms our nerves and eases strife
What is the secret of this stuff
Milkaholics just can't get enuff.

We know that milk is mostly water
There's almost eighty eight percent
There's protein -  fat and carbohydrate
And calcium to give bones strength.
Drinka - Pinta - Milka - Day
It sure will help you on your way.

Full-fat milk makes ladies fertile
And it tastes much nicer too
Leave the skimmed milk for the slimmers
While you enjoy your creamy goo.
Jersey Milk has FIVE POINT THREE
Fresian much less - Oh dear me! ! ! 

Milk is a rich source of vitamins
A and D and E and K
Lactose gives our milk its sweetness 
Drinka - Pinta - Milka - Day.
Drinking milk instead of coffee
Keeps you calm and much less stroppy.

Natural milk is prone to curdle
So we have to Pasteurise 
Killing all the dee-dum-durdle
Homogenise and Sterilise.
When next in't Country - it's my vow
To drink my milk straight from the cow! ! ! 

Milk provides a range of products
Cream - Butter - Cheese and Yoghurt too
Without which life would be much poorer
No Camembert or Danish Blue.
When our palates we would please
We judge a country by its Cheese.
I'll sing the praise of English Cheeses
Cheddar - Cheshire - Wenslydale
Lancahire and Regal Stilton
From pastures lush in Leicester Vale.
In Terraced House or at the Hilton.

My 'Ode to Milk' is not complete
Without a mention of 'Best Butter'
'Farmhouse' from the pasture sweet
The taste?  'A Pastoral Ode by Rutter'.
And never let me utter words obscene
some were small children, 
others were women! 
and capitalist bibles fell from the sky, 
spreading salvation and hellfire
in the name of profit

How precious is the midnight hour
when from our daily task we rest
sometimes refreshed by cooling shower
with starlit darkness we are blessed.

When from our daily task we rest
birds silent rest with folded wings
with starlit darkness we are blessed
the wind a sweet soft dream song sings.

Birds silent rest with folded wings
the air is filled with fragrance scent
the wind a sweet soft dream song sings
to aid our sleep is her intent.

The air is filled with fragrant scent
in slumber sweet we close our eyes
to aid our sleep is her intent
we sleep in peace 'til warm sunrise.

In slumber sweet we close our eyes
sometimes refreshed by cooling shower
we sleep in peace 'til warm sunrise
how precious is the midnight hour. 

Of Nature's wealth created by your power
I see the clouds - the lightning and the thunder
Ensuing storm and sweet refreshing shower.

When I observe the Universe's vastness
The countless stars that fill the evening sky
Where Sun and Moon keep watch uopn the fastness
Of chaning seasons - as the days go by.

When through deep woods and forest glades I wander
A hear the birds all singing in the trees
I stand in awe of lofty mountain grandeur
With rushing falls and lakes of tranquil ease.

So freely given to all the human race
Your constant Mercy - all our needs addressing
Forgiving sin and weakness by your Grace. 

And when at last - the mists of time have vanished 
You will redeem what now we dimly see
Through Heaven's gates - where eartly ills are banished 
We'll enter in for all Eternity.

How great you are - How great you are
Sustaining everything in view
How great you are - How great you are 
We'll spend eternity with you
How great you are - How great you are.

Beautiful  ladies  loved his  music of choice.
As he sung, to a quiet, mesmerized audience, 
his eyes shone and put forth great passion.
Sweet, flowing  music, tranquil vocal tones enjoyed
by elegant ladies of exquisite high fashion.
Jealous  men did not agree, they preferred
to hang the entertainer from the nearest tree.
Later that evening during a half time break, 
he was cautioned, make no mistake.
Look beyond the ladies, don’t stare in their eyes, 
set your focus above them, look to the sky.
He sang each night  as if performing chores,

Way back in the days of old,

Times have changed since way back then,

Sing me a song of glory,

Sing of hard times, sad times true,

Sing of Lincoln, Martin, Malcolm and Kennedy.
Sing of the races joining, living in harmony.
Sing of the past, present and hope for the future.

I think cake is so yummy
It always fills my tummy
And it's fun to bake
Oh dear sweet cake
I love you like a Halloween mummy

Day by day I keep seeing in the same radiant features
Flicker of evergreen love, 
In the same divine image
Colour of celestial lust, 
In the same form
My love from many lives; 

Day by day I keep hearing through the same bangles
Tremor of selfless love, 
Through the same jingling anklets
Rhythm of divine notes, 
Through the same voice
My love song from many lives; 

Day by day I keep smelling from the same wild flower
Perfume of unyielding love, 
From the same sandalwood sculpture
Scent of celestial dreams, 
From the same presence
Fragrance of reborn love; 

Day by day I keep tasting from the same potion
Abundance of extravagant love, 
From the same earthen vessel
Flavour of divine nectar, 
From the same cup
The intoxicating wine of love; 

Day by day I keep feeling through the same delicate touch
Quiver of selfish love, 
Through the same fated bereavement
Emotion of a heavenly tryst, 
Through the same thorny rose
Pain of eternal love; 

Day by day I keep sensing through the same presence
Aura of mysterious love, 
Through the same eternal pledge
 Depth of spiritual bliss, 
Through the same love
The delicacy of ephemeral life. 

Finally the trench was found in the sky at last we can come
It has been a long time on this hard bed where evil souls fed 
Since day one I been writing poetry to better the old and young 
I been in pain here my people our in pain still dying in this acid rain
I always sat in wonder how much lives will drugs touch? 
Or watch females die when they were force by men to clutch 
Beyond saving is this world much hatred in the midst that is now musk 
My people have witness the relentless happen to many men
Manhunts were tense but non were successful when they fled
They were misled now they all lay in a coffin with flowers that were red
Forever begins is something more than destruction but a new beginning 
Within the trench I believe a soft bed where I can rest my head 
No longer being fed lies or being misled till death in a casket bed 
Everyone is thinking minds boggled overwhelm with excitement 
Opposite of broke men on corners or anyone told they were foreigners 
In the land where forever begins will hold lovely masses 
At last we can witness the day blood oozed off the fence rail
The picket fence that was suppose to divide us failed 
Now we can smile as blood covering the picket fence is derailed 
Now everything is good like I knew it would be-love is swell
We all knew we could do it we were in prison now we finally made bail


Let´s find new chalk 
for the spring coming, 
burning ideas, 
more wood, please.

Let´s make doves fly.

We are lonely 
next to the path 
to get a sight 
Stern stone gaze
towards that forgotten margin
of the city, 
where hard-boiled kids 
keep their hearts locked, 
pretending to be something
that cannot possibly be.

 Is it a blessing those open arms? 

The north wind breaks on the hills 
and wistles notes hard to swallow
for the pure ears of those
who can´t smile
and throw stones.

Old chalk dust, 
Where is the wood? 

It is still cold in spring.

Wood keeps burning
but it´s no use. 

I’m sad today
(Not the day the storm came
Killing the poor and elderly) 
BUT
days later
When I’m realizing
There are still babies living
Dieing
Because we as Americians
Didn’t act as fast as we should
As fast as we could
As fast as we did
Half the world away
When the water’s wave
Came
Drowning tourist and Asian resident
The same
This was different than Tsunami
THIS WAS DIFFERENT-
We had forewarning
Time for evacuation
Time for preparation
Yet it’s 
days later
And I’m realizing
There are still babies living
Dieing

And I can’t help but
Wonder if 
It has to do with the color
Of the babies skin
Or more likely
The fact
That
Their parent’s don’t have voting majority
(Otherwise known as money) 
And I hate
That my mind
Contemplates
These thoughts

I’ve heard the explanations
Excuses
Reasons
"Doing the best we can."
Understand
Homeland security
When we refuse to
Accept the aid
Of foreign lands

And even the Soviets had squadrons on stand by
Before the storm made land fall
Yet it’s 
days later
And I’m realizing
There are still babies living
Dieing

The European’s simply "Tsk" and shake their heads
And
It’s a sad day for me
days later
Because I can’t explain this to my children
It’s a sad day for me
days later
Because I thought we were better than this
It’s a sad day for me
days later

BECAUSE

It is
The
First
Day 
That
I’ve ever
Felt ashamed
To be an American


Monday
The world is a ball of water.
See, it is round-sided.
I move across its topside,
upon the world, not in it.
The boat is a comb, acomb over idle
white hair.
Waves grow on a round skull
uncountable.
Sea, it is round-sided.
Fog is building a vessel.
Sea is the butt of a bottle.
Boat bobs in the center.
At the V
of the stern standing,
I see below me sea,
ceiling of fog, see
the round horizon, sea
tears on my cheeks. I see
through globes of tears
the last lost point of land.
The world all
of water below and a low
sky. The world is a ball
of water. Pendulum-sun
goes over slow.
All night out riding
beside the mast
the moon posts in the sky.

Tuesday

Aggressor prow. Agree-er sea.
In floes of marble vanish veins of foam
all morning. In the afternoon
the quarry-ocean starboard hisses, lashes into cracks.
Concussive blocks slip roaring aft.
A double thunder smacks the boat's drum-side.
Steep tents of wind and spray are pitched
on buckling, heckling water.
Papoosed under blankets, prammed in a yellow chair
on a grid of calked wide planks
that rush in long perspective to the rail,
I see a corner of the deck rise up
to roof over angled waves, and duck,
a hatch-lid closing below my eyelid's thatch.
Ramping, the paving sea romps, lifts, lets itself down,
rises, ramps and, romping, side-slips, lets itself down,
a floor that never stills and flats,
that never levels steady.
We dine behind steel ribs: a riveted whale,
white-bellied, bluntly breaks through acres of quartz,
bores a corridor with wedged head
in heavy, innocent, black, abundant water.
Portholes, gill-holes, jug-shaped, fill with sky
the purple whale-sheen drains away
fill with foam and freeze-greendrains away
fill with liquid sky, with solid sea, that drains away.
Oh, will it ever pause at half and half
so the soup can stop, can stop being sly in the bowls?

Wednesday

A slag-pile slipping, parting, shifting
black under ashes of cloud.
Smoke or snow blows off the square, the axe-blade waves:
A Nova Scotian color, the morning cold and April.
By noon blue tables with plentiful plates of foam.
Crisp napery of gulls unfolds aloft.


The wild side's portside after dark.
Ghost hogans rise on a plane of coal
in the mica of moonlight.
Houris, eeries, valkyries, furies,
sybils, satyrs, weirds and bards
orate, whistle, screech, scratch, scrabble,
snarl, quarrel, quibble in the rigging.
Trolls, trout, ghouls, geese and gargling walri
snort, sneer, chortle, sniggle, chuckle in the scuppers.
I stand at the rail of a wooden pen
all alone on the windy, dark, warped, harpy sea.
he moon gashing a cloud, slants up, slants down.
The moon is posting tonight.

Thursday

Today, on the round horizon, rain in the east,
opposite a great gold sheepshead cloud.
I, in the portside lee of the fantale, found
the ladder of seven colors upsloped on the sea,
delicate-ribbed, quite short, a belt to the sky,
low-linking milky waves to a gray-scud dome:
Violet, Green, Yellow, Rose, and pallors in between.
All round, all large and round, the plattered sea.
All curved, all low and curved, the lid of light.
The white duck of the boat an only lump on the sea.
I, there, could not see me,
but who stared from the stair of the rainbow could see.
Tonight I lie on a shelf, the cabin dark,
the bunk floats in the purring ship on the panting sea.
I-Eye open, level with the porthole, see
in miniature, round-framed, captured, the round sea:
like a rushing sky of blue-black foaming clouds
racing counter to the boator like engines of infinity
pulsing a summer heaven full-speed by.
Or the hole is a planet turning, star-spray dashed
before its face as it travels the orbit's rail.
Or that white scud is its restless atmosphere.
Or it is a moon whose white volcanoes steam
such fluvia across its somber carapace.
The ship leans slippery sideways. My cradle rocks.
A rough wide white lash rears up, smacking the glass.
Atomic, bombastic water blasts, obliterates
the porthole's iris. The cabin quakes.

Friday

Eye out running
on soft flints
on the pathless sea.
White-lipped near-stones
now ganged close to the boat.
A circular pasture
raked and cleared today
of wraths and rips,
snowy jags and cones.
I on the quarter deck
in-rolled in my chair,
infant or invalid set to cure
or spoil in the sun,
I run behind my outrunning eye
to toe every wave
that skips to the thin horizon,
every colt-blue wave
and its cobalt shadow . . .
Orange anchor-sun
steadies my chair.
Deck builds a foothill,
sea a gulf, and stern,
a great hip, leaps
on wind-free air.

I look for, what do I look for on the unfurnished sea?
On land I longed for a large place empty.
Eye-I avoided obstacles, vehicles, people, shapes intercepted.
Eye-I wished to veer out far, long, wide, high, unframed, uninterrupted
but like a thrown stone bumped, stopped, stumbled into buildings.
Now no upright, only the permanent low-fleeing waves
the sparse and insubstantial, transient clouds . . .
Which white loller afar might be a boat?
Or porpoise, or even a swimming man
naked, living on wave as gull on air?
Which dark dollop might be nose of a whale?
Or wooden joist from a down-gone ship?
Or even a seated man, ebony, shining
Sea-Buddha, rigid, afloat, with ivory grin? . . .
Only the waves perpetual, only the unpeopled sea.

Saturday

There on the round rim east,
on the compass curve,
the ship the sextant's center,
there on the lead-thin line
I see a mark!
Growing square, approaching.
A hut? Oh, it is a boat,
a twin-ship sailing to meeting.
Trundling, tossing, tipping,
persisting, coming on.
Expanding, rounding tubbish,
towing a wide wake.
Cross-barred masts for and aft
stab her solid to the sea.
Yellow and green, her plump
stack issues energy.
Our sister passes, she
is our mirror on the wave.
How like a painted boot
(with doll-arms waving from decks!)
In full-hooped splashing skirts
she bobs on, opposite bound.
We wave all our arms.
Our toot salutes her toot.
So soon she littles and fades,
graying to a hut
of mist in the shape of a square.
And sharpens to a mark
on the empty map of the west.
And teeters on the edge
of horizon, and rolls off. . .
a period fallen from the font.

Sunday

Land. Yes, Ho! A mist-made coast,
a strand of Ireland sighted off the bow.
Fast Net Rock, admonitory tower,
the lighthouse rising dour on a fist of stone:
Cobh comes forward quiescent to greet
the float of the boat.
How mat-mild now the tantrum sea
lured to the cove.
How flat and old the world,
and odd and still,
when upcropped the horizon halts
the willful eye,
shows it its stall and pasture
safe and small.
All sibilant little laps the boat glides on,
its lunge arrested.
A great heart has stopped.
A silent sled is whitely, mournfully borne
to the gray land's shed.
I, in the prow, here, hear my pulse again,
feel equal feet on the steady deck.
Fence of the rail nears fence of the dock.
The door to the wild is closing.
With hanging neck
I watch that crack far down
the world around
and world not round
through sliding tears. 

Do you feel the pain of nails, thrust through your tender hands, 
Do you feel those evil thorns, a crown twisted in bands, 
The excruciating agony, of iron pierced through your feet, 
The shame of being spat upon, on a Roman pebbled street, 

Do you feel that wretched whip, draw blood upon your back, 
Hear the scourge’s mocking cries; the whip’s report and crack.
Disciples all but one had fled, as His righteous life was taken. 

Have you carried His cursed cross, for just a pace or two, 
Have you heard His cries, His pleas, bourn down in time to you.
Have you ever wept aloud, for this price He paid for sin.
Do you believe He died for you and His Spirit dwells within. 

If your heart, spirit, mind and soul, have never felt His sword, 
Patience in the face of words, 
Words, harshly spoken without a thought
Words cruelly spoken but with no ill-will! 
Patience will bring healing
Patience will bring understanding, 
Love is patience.
Patience when you are irritated
When those you love don’t understand you
Time will reveal your way to them, 
Patience brings rainbows out of thunderclouds
It will bring achievements out of efforts, 
If only, you have the patience to wait long enough
You’ll be the master of all around you. 

Coming back home is like opening the doors again, 
like getting in the past with the hope it might change, 
But sometimes the future gets there first
And sees us coming.

Charo is not here anymore today
And the deep hole in my mother´s heart 
Is growing bigger.
Somebody else´s speed
Took her away from us
Just to prove she was an angel.
The world is an emptier place today.

(In memoriam, Charo)I don't want to burst your bubble
But you are in a deep shit trouble! 

Lived your life to the extreme? 
You are no longer a teen.

Life is not about control
Let happiness become your goal! 

No one will help your wicked soul
Let love become your goal! 

Fat ass, weak heart, bad cholesterol? 
Let good health become your goal! 

You are in prison? You are on parole? 
Let repentance become your goal! 

Have you ever helped anyone at all? 
Let kindness become your goal! 

Are you playing someone else’s role? 
Let creativity become your goal! 

Your future is open, you’ll be on a roll
Let hope become your ultimate goal

Love is Eternal they always say
More than that is proved in a day, 

It is wonderful to be in Love
Even the demure spirits rise above, 

In Love a different world is sighted
All the evils thoughts are blighted, 

The reflective senses come alive
Eyes, ears, smell, touch strongly derive, 

The Eternal Nature dances around
The fancies, dreams, hope surround, 

So, fill this world with the message of DOVE
Like Almighty’s everlasting ‘Unconditional’ LOVEMemorial Day weekend, ESPN, I watched, "Outside The Lines, "
And what I heard, well as the saying goes it just, "blew my mind, "
High school kids desiring to advance & arrive at the college level, 
However, there are those coaches who would bury it with a shovel.

on-football program is rapidly gaining popularity nationwide, 
Okay now begs the question, what right has the NCAA to decide? 
Former NFL great, Keyshawn Johnson sponsors & coaches teens, 
By the way he doesn’t make any money but spends his own green.

How is it that people are in a huff about a day spent on a yacht? 
To reward the kids for their efforts and enjoy what they have not? 
Giving a sneak peak at what can be accomplished and the reward, 
Should they reach the pinnacle of success and are able to afford.

Two Caucasian coaches speaking on OTL were one  against, 
And should be obvious they grew up on the other side of the fence, 
Whereas the majority of these teens are of African American decent, 
Now with the high unemployment rate parents are just making rent.

How dare they or anybody come on camera, whine, moan & groan, 
Because most of these kids will never qualify for any student loans, 
Until they or anyone are willing to foot the bill, leave them alone, 
Prejudice is not manifested in the locker room it begins at home.

Scholarships are the one and only way they will ever continue on, 
How can any sanctioning body not involved declare it is wrong? 
When a former standout wide receiver is willing to share his time, 
What gives those who’ve never played a right to speak their mind? 

It’s impossible to appreciate endless opportunities unless exposed, 
As inner city Blacks, Hispanics & Whites the whole world knows, 
Are like goldfish in their limited environment of one gallon bowls, 
Till the big fish on the outside take time to tutor & help them grow.

So, when coaches steer them towards colleges they graduated from, 
Would that not be better than not being recruited from a single one? 
Or a school with unscrupulous characteristics and deceitful means? 

I never knew I would be a long distance runner.

I´ve lost the drive to win 
and my voice has become sweet. 

Young tigers think of me 
as an easy piece to hunt down 
in middle game traps 
and I feel like a gazelle.

What a curse 
to feel all this music 
and have no talent 
to sing it! 

Sober voice of  baritone in tune, 
sad cossack soul.

The fields on the river banks 
should be green by now, 
bishop to f check.

All those memories. 

Tal called me craftsman. 
I admired Petrosian´s hidden control, 
so infinetely elegant, 
and Bronstein was my friend, 
a twin soul in melancholy, 
but an artistic daring spirit.

I never knew I would be a long distance runner.

How lonely the hotels 
behind my thick eyeglasses! 
 
I will break the center 
and open up the flanks. 
I will balance my pieces 
to play a winning endgame.

Knight to d 
it´s a beautiful square 
in this position.

How sweet to sing 
the symphony 
of cold chess! 

My voice has become sweet. 
I will win my final game today. 

Well, an alive and very active member internet pedophile ring, 
"Operation Rescue" identified suspects, investigation continuing, 
known abused children in countries rescued now in a safe place, 
How in the world could  operate anything for years without a trace? 

Perpetrators include teachers, police officers, scout leaders injecting fear, 
One Spaniard working a summer youth camp abused over five years, 
Cori Bassett, public affairs officer for U. 

S. Immigration that we call ICE, 
Arrests so far have been made in Georgia and Connecticut, at what price? 

In the U. 

S. there have been five arrests & four convictions, strong? 
That is it after a month investigation, what in the heck took so long?    
Reports say the illicit website attempted to operate as, discussion only, 
Illegal images & films under the radar sounds like a bunch of bologna.

Law enforcement from countries, U. 

Were involved in the so-called investigation but for years were kept at bay? 
It is not like they were searching for one man in Iraq like Saddam Hussein, 
Or Bin Laden and these guys were not known for playing children's games.

Now Europol is proudly taking credit for, "exceptional work of our experts, "
Excuse me but it took years to identify illegal activity from perverts? 
After his arrest, the top dog Dutch forum administrator helped police break, 
Encryption measures that shielded users' identities we know now were fake.
 
'Europol subsequently issued over  intelligence reports to police authorities, 
 In over countries in Europe and elsewhere-" might we question priorities? 
 "Which has led to the arrests of suspects and the safeguarding of children" Oh! 
"Safe guarding of so many vulnerable children-" while #will surely grow.

Investigation is led by Britain's Child Exploitation & Online Protection Center, 
Peter Davies claims more arrests as the investigations continue, is he a mentor? 
But, 'those who have been members of the site can expect a knock on the door, 
In the very near future, ' he said yet not exactly when, where or how many more. 

In Britain, police said, the children involved were aged between and years, 
Suspects arrested in Australia were from to but who can count the tears? 
Where they, "preyed on children with anonymity, subterfuge and camouflage.' 
members of an infamous ring, a handful of convictions, I find that odd. 

I had a dream, a pleasant dream, 
of a place filled with lush green grass.
A place with crystal running falls, 
with trees and mountains so very tall.

I had a dream, a wonderful dream, 
of an ocean beautiful and strikingly clear, 
with kings of the sea surviving there.

I had a dream, a precious dream, 
of a world free of chemicals.
Toxic waste a thing of the past, 
of pink lungs and bunnies that last.



I see trees of green and red roses bloom 
The air is so fresh and the sky is so blue
Somewhere a lady's alone in her room
Somewhere a child stands forlorn in a queue 
The lady has no one - her room is a tomb
The child prays he'll get his bowl full of stew.
Life is unequal - the haves and have nots
Some have no money while others have pots.

A man is in prison - unloved alone 
A star on the catwalk - envy of all
He dreams that he is a king on a throne 
While her dreams come true - each day she walks tall. 
My life is so blessed - nice car - mobile phone
In the third world - some have nothing at all, 
They often ask - just what is my life worth? 
Or is it just all the dice roll  of birth? 

For some life is laughter - for others frowns
Some live in hovels - some live in fine pads
Some dress in rags - but for others fine gowns
Many are Orphans - no Mums and no Dads
Do we take for granted our elegant towns
And all the pleasures and blessings we've had? 
Wherever there's light you'll also find dark
Conditions serene - conditions quite stark.

Free water and air - free soil for the crops
Enough for the weak - the poor and the small
Heat and the light from the Sun never stops.
What causes the pain - and makes Nations fall? 
It's man makes the bomb and man the bomb drops.
What a Wonderful World - just for me and you.

I’m told Father that I should pray for this killer, forgive  me my King, this I can not do.  Maybe another time perhaps, another day when I can think clearly.  Today I focus my prayers on the deceased woman and her precious family.  
Father the perpetrator beat this poor lady so bad, that the family couldn’t indentify her so it would definitely appear that she suffered tremendously.  Father I want to believe that you took her to be with you long before the brutal blows were landed, that she was already sitting by your side.

Not
We see difference, 
we see hate.
Go to school, discriminate.
Fight the enemy, hide the scars.
Hold your tears behind bars.
Pick up sticks, hurl the rocks.
Go to Church, march for blocks.
Martin dreams
End the hate
Celebrate
come together one and all.
Hold hands, 
stand tall.

You have the power to give health back again.
Here me Master, cover me with your love.
Send your blessings from  high up  above.
I’ve followed in your footsteps, praised  your name.
I loved you from childhood but suffer just the same.
What have I done to displease you  my King, 
Please find a way to whisper in my ear.
I’ll wait for you Master, oh yes I will surely hear.
I can only question, and ask for a reason, 
but I will accept what you do any day, any season.
You are the king, and your final word stands.
I’ll take my pain and my troubles to bear, 
If no word comes Master and you close earth’s door.
Please take me Father to your Heavenly shore.

with precious children, a boy and a girl.
A white picket fence surrounds our home, 
our thoughts wander, our eyes roam.

When she came along, my heart sang a different song.
The truth must come out, it’s time for all to know.
We have been living a life of lies and fairytale shows.
The closet will open, suppressed feelings unveiled.

We are good people with saddened heavy hearts.
It is now time for the true love story to start.
It’s difficult to say we no longer love each other that way, 
as of today, we announce - we are gay-.

My darling husband, I love you like a brother or friend, 
but my true love lies with- my -best friend.
It is she whom I long for in the middle of the night.
When my eyes close, she lives in my sight.

You my husband, are living a life of lies too.
I know you love someone who cares deeply for you.
Let the lies die and the truth come forth.
Let your heart sing and the bells of freedom ring.

We’re coming out to live our truth, 
our feelings suppressed since the days of our youth.
Oh the peace is felt so deep inside, 
no more tears, no more reason to hide.

 

Note:  This is a true story, of a man and a woman who thought
they could live their life as a straight couple.  They married, had
two children but never found happiness or peace as a couple. 

Fun-filled days, lots of holiday cheer.
Children all over the world, year after year, 
Wait for this special day in the hopes
of many gifts to open and play.
How soon we forget, the true
In a manger in Bethlehem oh, so far away.
No pillow for his head.
No blanket for his bed.
Let us praise him instead.

concerned at the minds that he is still able to poison.
Today Father I pray that you take total charge and stop him in his tracks, that you cause these people to take a step back and think before they act.  That you cause these people who may be suffering from mental disorders, to seek help and allow the medical Doctor's to do what they are best trained for.
Father we need people that can show compassion, love and care to others and not to think of ways in which to harm them.
You my Father are so much more powerful than this evil being, please knock him out of the way and teach him a lesson.
I know you are listening Father and I know that you will take care of this evil when the time is right and only you Father know when that time is right.  I will never question why you do things the way you do.  I will hope that I will see positive changes in my time.
Father let me see people embracing and caring for each other instead of beating and killing each other.


We put ourselves  on a  pedestal
 wanting everyone to notice and admire.
Feeding us, 
we thirst not of our innermost hearts desire.
Forgetting our priorities thinking only of self, 
we place them on the lowest shelf.
Materialistic things, 
 numerical values become our obsession.
Realizing not, soon to fall into deep depression.
Make no mistake, loving ourselves is  necessary
in order to give love to others.
Being obsessed with oneself is tragic and
can only lead to  lonely moments.

Take your bells and chime away, 

Now raise your hands if you know the reason, 
we celebrate this colorful season.
One, two, three, four, oh my, more and more.
You all deserve a great big score.

Why we know he’ll never leave us.
He gave his life upon the cross, 
we would live,  not become lost.

Today we celebrate his precious birth, 
while he watches over us here on earth.
Clap your hands rejoice for all to see.

Lush, green ambiance standing before me.
Mesmerized by childhood memories.
I smile and ponder of which I see.

That precious time of year upon us, 
to embrace our family and friends.
To share, care and make amends.

what his life for all has given.
Rejoice, praise, worship and sing.
His Father in heaven is our true King.

Away you’ll go for another year, 
With glowing memories packed inside.
Fresh in our minds, we shall not hide.
Gives much love, and an abundance of pride.

 a sweet baby boy.
Born on this day 
to give us much joy.
 from the Heavens above.
Giving us an abundance
 of hope and deep found love.
   He sent us his only son, 
 an unselfish gift, 
 for our sins, 
  so that we could live.
 when you think of your wealth, 
  and spiritual health.

Only a few more days and nights, 

when we gathered round our colorful trees.
Remember when we caroled down the street, 

Memories are precious let’s not forget, 
don’t do anything you might regret.
to treasure family far and near.

Sing sweet songs in memory,     

Ice glints glow for all to see.
Lights of red, yellow, blue and green, 

Clap your hands sing out loud, 
Tis his birth we celebrate, 
knowing he’ll never leave us.

Gather round one and all, 
It’s time to create a memory.
Stand proud, stand tall, 
allow everyone to see.

The happiness and joy you possess, 
will fall upon those, without rest.
A beautiful gift to share, 
at this brilliant time of year.

no matter where the snow shall fall.
Enjoy this precious time of year.

Allowing her to conceive his son.
Dec. Mary gave birth.

Thankyou for this precious gift
A gift of life, love and light

Glasses placed strategically among clusters
Of soft white cotton snow.

The room is filled with a scent of fresh pine, 
Enjoyed by all who sit to dine
And  thank him for his grace


Cast away living in a bubble, 
Ir orbit around an endangered earth.
Lost among the skyhawks of futuristic power..
I’m sworn to take an oath.

To move unseen through portholes in chase.
Where eyes of an eagle sore  deep dark space.
I live my life far away from home.
Protected, without fear, in a bubble I roam.

Man crushed the evergreens of earth.
Water contamination, no more rebirth.
I, with a chosen few, 
see the earth from a different view. 

In the landscape of your mind, one has the ability to think clearly.
Never allowing deep, dark thoughts to penetrate.
Spirited, beautiful and heavenly thoughts tickle the senses.
Piercing through delicate walls,  giving strength to stand  tall.
Instead of accepting negative views from those of low self esteem.
Realize you are in charge of every thought held within.
Always start each day in a positive light.
In the quiet of the noon day sun,   a new day has begun.
On top of  mountains high, sitting calmly while  birds fly by.
Always covered like a glove,  by the blood of the lamb.
Live, love, laugh stay protected, in the palm of His glorious hand.

through streets of dreaded hell. Walk with 
me to garbage dumps, dark alleys, nasty 
mattresses smell-won’t you walk with
me more and more to learn what befalls a
lost desperate whore. Won’t you take me 
by the arm, lift me if you can, or would you
shy away  leaving me here-look-
among the dirty drooling creeps of night
that ne’re sleep.  Come-walk with me, 
touch the soil where tattered shoes dent, 
kiss the lips of those who never speak, feel
the pulse of the near dead, look upon the
crowd of dread.  Careful now-step over
those who lie still on bedded ground, never
to move again, corpse after corpse of
uncared souls,  Oh yes- come-walk
with me, can you see a possibility of
hope. Do you believe  -I-  want to survive, 
to live as you, to thrive.  Look at me, study
my weathered face, look into my lifeless eyes, 
I’ve lost the feel for grace - love is not my 
desire.  I must eat, try to keep my heart full of  
fire. Survival of the fittest, a number one
concern. Come, my street friend, walk with 
me, see what stores my fate.  I’ll not live to 
see another year, nor will I have a love to 
share. In charge no longer of my own
destiny for I have created a travesty.  One 
day a hose will blow my way,  I shall fall
to the ground, swept away like waste
in a barn, I’ll lay dead and mutilated.
Walk with me, see where I go, so you will
never be- that old lost desperate whore
who feared her true destiny.

Stored deep inside, causing your heart
to swell.

A tear drops suddenly as you ponder  the
past.  What a shameful act you did,  the
Father, you did not ask.

Several sweet little babies, could have been born to you.
Instead you cut  their life line,  never let them
through.

 your children live in spirit, not knowing a mothers
love, but stand beside the Father, in their  home up
above.

They are  children of spirit, but will never walk the
earth,  you took away their possibility of birth.

The time will come, when you stand alone and
answer for your sins.

The book of life will open, and the untold
story begin. 

Fortune or fate
Bailout or bait

New rules
Old fools

Break the bank
In the tank

Create more debt
Print more money

You can bet
It’s not so funny

When you’re one of those
Getting hosed

Fiscal loss
All glitter and dross

September orn of innocence, 
to this vast universe.
Nurtured by parents, 
played with our friends.
Educated by many teachers, 
worked with our colleagues, 
learned by  mistakes.
Over and over through the years, 
we shed a tank full of tears.
Hurt by our enemies, 
used up by close family, whom
we love unconditionally.
Forgive, never forget, but have no regrets.
Know right from wrong, 
sing great gospel songs.
Put away old jealousies, 
clean up old wounds.
open closed doors, 
walk with a song in our hearts.
Keep a smile on our face, 
become a mentor to many in this growing
human race.
Experience this and we will have what
it takes, to take our place and enjoy a 
senior embrace.
Share our treasures of learning throughout
the world.
Teach the children, little boys and little girls.
Senior citizen’s we are, a wealth of knowledge
and wisdom has accompanied us thus far.
Put pen to paper, and  we’ll know
what to do.
through.
I felt I had reason to sing the blues.
A story as wild and crazy as this, 
makes me want to give you my fists

You looked me in the eye, said I was the only one.
I believed every word, when all was said and done.
How could I know, you are less than a male whore
I was not prepared for what was in store.

The phone rang on Tuesday afternoon, 
A voice said, sorry we’ll be foreclosing soon..
Shocked and afraid, I found myself in denial.
No matter--, soon I would go to trial

The phone rang on Wednesday morning.
My bank manager issued a warning.
You’re in the red, how I wished I was dead.

I was a fool for loving you.
Blind by good looks and sweet talk too.
Now here I sit all alone, 
Why, I do believe they just cut off my phone.

How could I not see the light
Everyone says it shone so bright.
My home, money, you took from me.
Worst of all, you stole my dignity.






As I am blinded by the sight of the world 
I search for the source of light within to unfold 
As I am deafened by the noise of the world 
I search for the song of silence within to unfold 

As I am a prisoner in the eternal time and space 
I search for the freedom within beyond mind maze 
As the ‘I’ itself is the biggest untruth that I’ve seen 
I search for the truth within by shattering what I’ve been 

When I am tired of finding the joy real and lasting 
I hear a call within so sweet and boosting 
That call deep in me urges to be private 
As a lover’s call to his sweetheart to mate 

The call commands me to strip off ‘I’ cover 
To help me find Self which I long to discover 
But to take off costumes, as a new bride refuses 
Tightly I catch hold of my ‘I’ and ‘mine’ dresses 

Husband patiently tries and wins the bride 
She surrenders merging in him with no pride 
Hope is there that the call within me will win 
One day or the other, self and Self will join!  Living in Kuwait a parched land in middle-east desert, just for money sake, where people float around, where I could hardly find any relations with true love, if I want to taste pure love I contact my mother living in India. Her voice itself is enough to bring bliss into my heart.)   

_*********_***********_**********_******* *****_*************_

She is the only
Window of my dark selfish room
Without which I can never assume
The sky of unconditional affection! 

She is the only
Candle that melts and burns ever
Till her life on earth gets over
To alter my gloomy days brighter! 

She is the only one
Having broader heart to pardon
My thousands of blunders done
But to cherish my value even one! 

She is the only one
Having a mind that won’t calculate
Things from her hands immaculate 
Surpassing even my life-mate! 

She is the only one
Who wishes always my prosperity 
Who can never bear my scarcity
Spending her days in austerity! 

She is the only one
Who Blooms in my bliss 
Withers away in my distress
Waving petal hands to bless! 

She is the only
Window of my dark stinky cell
Through which breeze with smell
Of pure love flows to distil! 				s earth turns towards the Sun
The ups and downs are well seen
When night falls with null Moon
Dark hides the true sight soon.

As mind awakens to sensible logic
The do-s and don’t-s appear realistic
When desire rises with heart’s panic
Ignorance overrides brains as magic! 

The Self patiently pulls me inside 
The self hastily pushes me outside
As Earth is bound to day and night
I am tossed amid self and Self might! 		ll of a sudden
Life becomes more meaningful
Nature’s display is more beautiful
Birds’ tweets are sweeter
Heart’s beat is rhythmic
I become but a psychic 
As Love which upholds
The world floods out! 

Bliss of blossoms
Dance of waves
Stare of stars
Moon so cool
Rain in plains
Snow fall over hills
All are words of Love

Glow of sun
Blow of breeze
Flow of river
Fluttering butterfly
Glittering dew drops
All are but sign 
Of Love divine

No worry touches as 
The soul soars high as
An eagle carried in the storm 
Above earth and its bedlam
Infinity holds my little soul 
The space reducing me 
Into negligible creature
And  ardor of the moment 
is Love leading eternity!   hile swimming
Amidst seething sea
Of selfish karmas
Seeking for coast
To rest my aching legs
I found a tiny land! 

With a heavy relief
I docked my feet.
But alas! 
It slipped and sank
Into selfishness! 

Hurriedly I took
Refuge in another rock
The same thing went on! 
Thus walking on
Moving stones
My voyage goes! 

When the search
For something stable
Turns inside me
My own ‘I’ derides
Being a chameleon itself
With numerous shades! 

Where is the root of ‘I’? 
Am I this body
With thick emotional skin
Covering my foul feelings? 
 Am I this mind 
With whirling thoughts

Is India identified
By its boundaries in geography? 
Or by its enduring biography? 
Or by its cricket and cine heroes? 
Or by its technically skilled fellows? 
 
India’s spirit lies
In art, literature and culture, 
In Self enquiry path venture, 
In eternal epics depicting
Rama and Krishna long-lasting 

India’s strength lies
In lofty Himalayan sages
Starting with mediating Siva 
In purity of Holy Ganges
Gushing with chanting Veda

India’s feminism lies
In reverence to mothers; 
In pure devotional tears, 
Flowed into divine songs, 
From many devotee gangs.

India’s courage lies
In Dadichi’s giving backbone
As Indra needed a weapon; 
In Meera’s flinging  herself
As a fuel in the fire of devotion

India’s Wisdom lies
In its timeless tales, 
In drama, dance and songs
Flourished to full extent
With Spirituality as target! 

India’s Pride lies 
In her tolerance and fortitude
To rise conquerors’ religions too, 
In her lap of sacred varieties hue 
Though she is orthodox too.

Her Language lies
In boldness of Sanskrit
With science and subtle skills
In sweetness of Tamil
With tender feelings and good wills

How an Indian
Will truly love India
If he ridicules Her Veda? 
If he mocks at Her custom? 
If he neglects Her wisdom? 

How an Indian 
Be a true Indian
If he loves other pilgrimage 
More than loving his holy land? 
If he likes other tradition
More than liking Indian convention?  ow will I tell my sorrow? 
To whom will I tell my sorrow? 

Heart breaks, body shudders
Throat blocks, tear pours.
I find no words.
Heaving chest drenches, 
In stream of tears.

I find no way, 
To break this cage.
Am I an eternal jailbird? 
Knotted in a cage made by myself! 

Unable to loosen the clutch of ignorance, 
Unable to find the root of ‘I’ the ego, 
I pretend to be wise, 
By walking among the sheep, 
As another sheep. 

Know not where to go, 
Know not what to do, 
Pursuing external knowledge, 
When the heart is dark, 
With thick clouds of feelings.

From the brain a storm
Blows with thoughts, 
To fan the burning ego.
The ever burning flames 
Of Sun may die one day.
Will the ego die some day? 

Where does the world go? 
Where do I go? 
What is the intention
Behind the monstrous universe? 
What am I? 
What is world to me? 
Pushing away these
Problems of crisis 
I pretend to be very busy
In making money and making love

At times the honest heart 
Mocks at my hypocrisy 
Knocks me from inside 
To wake me up

Unable to bear the hits
Unable to tear the skin
I cry I cry and I cry
As an infant cries
To express its twinge!                  he ripe tamarind fruit
Touches not the shell
Yet protected by the same shell
Hangs aloof having seed inside.

Make me detached from 
Relatives and daily routines
Stand aloof brooding
Over inner Self!                            -Nov 'rom my bed

The two great friends Birth and Death
Conspired for humans, Lament and Breath; 

The natal twinge the infant could never express
The soul’s departure nor the body could digress;   
 
A rare MIRACLE, a life in life
Grows up to experience the worldly strife; 

A child takes no time to mature fast
An adult leaves the post for he cannot last; 

The wrinkles force to quit for Gen next
Their epochs are quoted in various texts; 
 
Exit and Entrance prudently divine 
Folded in mystery the unseen time. 

Master Jack was old and grey; time had passed him by, 
Wizened hands betrayed his age, still a glint lay in his eye; 
Physique so very frail now, had fought a thousand ‘wars’, 

The souls of those who’d mattered; were now long in their graves, 
Fond memories of times gone by, crashed over him in waves.
His children had all forsaken him; forsaken him every one, 
Embarrassed by his manner, and the sharpness of his tongue, 

Tears fell upon his trembling hands, as he gazed on them with love, 
 Those hands had even built their home, beside the forest wood. 

Hands carved their wooden furniture; and planted crops to sell, 
When drought had struck the barren land, they dug for him a well, 
Skilled hands had caught his children, emerging from the womb.
Seven boys, and three small girls; now adults in full bloom.

Gnarled hands from manual labor, digits enflamed and sore, 
Busy hands made impotent; were functioning no more, 
Spastic hands, arthritic hands; worked now ‘to the bone’, 
Not one soul to help him farm; Master Jack prayed all alone.

The countless tasks accomplished, through your two gifts Devine", 
Calloused hands now pressed in prayer; "I wish new turf to roam", 


Serenade me till the end of my life
Will you dance with me till I die
Come and share my every sigh
Lets chase the cloud in the sky
Baby, lets chase the cloud in the sky

Lets walk barefoot and feel the dew in the morning
Fluttering like butterflies with golden wings
Baby, come and stir my soul strings
Baby, come and stir my soul strings

Kiss me tenderly and kiss me on and on
Kiss me everyday from dusk to dawn
Lets swim together in this life like a swan
Baby, You entered my life and I was born
Baby, You entered my life and I was born

Our love is as deep as the depth of the earth
Our love is as fluid as the waves on the firth
Our love will last us through all our births
Baby, Heaven has come down in our hearth
Baby, Heaven has come down in our hearthcreeping rays
over pines
 
like color turns
of glaring fields
 
sunshine clover
and silver amber
touching and glowing
the flowers


Light and gray darkness, 
Twilight's silences endless
- Luminiferous

Night after night, 
their strength and arrogance grow, 
the horror closing the horizon, 
the true nature of the sword. 
 
I entered a new labyrinth.
I saw the new gods, 
how their enemies died 
in the desert, 
far from stupid gardens, 
on the sand, 
among the rocks.

I remain staring at the smoke.

When that music hits all eyes swarm 
Who is this girl kickin’ it
To the beat right on time
Leg warmered shins flyin’
White keds and fluorescent T
Yellow sports bra
Help her to remember the year she was born—
See the way she sways her head back & forth
Nodding front and reverse
Turns oh now she’s got it! 

Frazzled hair krimped and ironed 
Side-part scrunchie—
why! Bright pink of course! 

MJ blarin’ New Kids! Madonna! 
Petty & Paula! 
why! She’s your s child. 




Father you are the King, the master and the creator of all.  Only you have the ability, the strength and the power to heal this poor ailing woman, only you Father can take her by the hand and walk her along the path to wellness again.




Two years ago I ruined my life when I got a bride.
She's  tall and about ten feet wide.
She weighs pounds and I married her when I was drunk.
She eats and eats and my bank account has significantly shrunk.
She rolled over on me in bed and broke fifteen of my bones.
I wish she'd pack her bags and leave me on my own.
She's mean, she has warts on her face and it's tearing me apart.
When we go out in public, she always farts.
When she passes gas, it's louder than TNT and it really stinks.
I should've listened to my parents when they told me never to drink.
She asked if she's as sexy as Lindsay Lohan and I said hell no.
If she ever gets pregnant, you won't be able to tell that she shows.
She never shaves her legs and there is a lot of hair.
It's like making love to a bear.
I drive my car really fast and I hope to die in a crash.
I learned to live with her until she grew a mustache. 

The Peridot (pronounced PEAR - A - DOE)   is a very beautiful but lesser known gemstone. It was first discovered on Topazo Island in the Red Sea by the Egyptians who called it 'The Gem of the Sun'. Peridos are unique gemstones because they are always green. They are a form of Chrysolite - magnesium aluminium silicate -   with an iron impurity which is responsible for its green colour. The depth of green is proportioanal to the percentage of iron.  

Peridot so orthorhombic
Lime green - olive green - and sea green 
Even greens you've never seen
Yes - over forty shades of green.
Colours of all life and nature
Themes politic - themes scholastic 
Peridot gems for all we know
Orthorhombic so Peridot.

Peridots can rival emeralds
In their lustre and their value
Mined in enigmatic China
Blissful Burma - U S A.
Offers wearer full protection 
With it fame and dignity
It also brings prosperity 
Emeralds rival can Peridots.

Peridot birthstone for August
Linked with Leo - powerful sign
Bringing health to lungs and liver 
A peridot will bless the giver.
Peridot gemstone of Egypt
Worn to ward off evil spirits
By Romans to dispel a foe
August for birthstone Peridot 

Peridot so green so perfect
Peridot so orthorhombic
Peridots can rival emeralds
Peridot birthstone for August 
August for birthstone Peridot.
Emeralds rival can Peridots
Orthorhombic so Peridot
Perfect so green so Peridot.

I loved you all through January
When the weather was so cold
I'll love you all through February
When all my lambs are in the fold
I'll love you all the whole month through
Not just on Saint Valentine's day
I'll still love you with all my heart
When the Spring flowers bloom in May.
I'll love you on a Summer's day
When the air is still and warm
I'll love you in the Autumn mists
When the leaves turn gold and fall.
I'll love you still in Winter's frost 
The whiteness of fresh fallen snow 
Reflects the pure clear beauty 
Of a special lady that I know. 
So I send you this Valentine 
A loving greeting from my heart
To say that I'll be with you always
And we will never be apart.

(John Knight - Sunny Colchester - February Only bread and only wine
Yet by faith a blessed bond
Between the Human and Divine
This is a Table of Communion
It is not the Table of the Church
Each week it is made ready
For those who want to love Him more.

So come - You who have much faith
And those who are still seeking
So come - You who come here often
And those who seldom come.
So come - You who  try to follow
And those who have tried and failed
So come you who hunger and thirst
For a deeper faith and a better life
For afairer world and better understanding.

Who want to meet Him - That they shoud.  
Come to this Table - THE LORD'S TABLE.
Only bread and only wine
Yet  by Faith a blessed bond
Of the human and Divine

A number that walks along with bad luck
A number where everything's gonna be unwell
Is it untrue or not? 
I really don't believe it

It's the same as others
The same as other odd number
The same as and I'm in this stage now
We are in this phase right now
And nothing bad happens
Neither infuriate nor aversions
Unless the fortunate itself


Mmy mother was the one you would choose to be your mother. Because of hner kindness and sweetness. And because of her blue eyes that would shine. And her blonde hair no one else had.  written Posted ust a simple scrap of paper, stained with his blood, dried red, 
It was picked up by a passer- by. It's author newly dead.
The victims in the towers had been pulverized by stone.
And now could be identified by DNA alone.
For about a decade after, his note was saved, unread, 
The M. 

E. was too busy, bones took precedence instead.

Reflecting pools, the well of souls, are where the towers stood.
There's a garden of remembrance and that's all well and good.
His widow and his daughters hung his picture on the wall.
It was like a wound reopened when they finally got the call.

She thought he had died quickly; the second plane had struck his floor.
He worked in the South Tower way up high on eighty four.
"We identified this by the blood, it matched his DNA

"
She stared numbly at the note he wrote that sad September day.

You may view the blood stained note and the message that he wrote
In the Nine Eleven museum in Manhattan
When he'd spent the time we're given, 
paper saved him from oblivion.
Now his tragic end will never be forgotten.

     last Thursday morning! 

          I'm the one that tore it down,

Control your innermost emotions.
Decide your worth, fulfill your desires.

Swith to the Ligh Kirk, ane an' a'
An' there tak up your stations;

An' pour divine libations
For joy this day.


Curst Common-sense, that imp o' hell,
Cam in wi' Maggie Lauder; But Oliphant aft made her yell,
An' Russell sair misca'd her:
This day Mackinlay taks the flail,
An' he's the boy will blaud her!
He'll clap a shangan on her tail,
An' set the bairns to daud her
Wi' dirt this day.


Mak haste an' turn King David owre,
And lilt wi' holy clangor;
O' double verse come gie us four,

This day the kirk kicks up a stoure;
Nae mair the knaves shall wrang her,
For Heresy is in her pow'r,
And gloriously she'll whang her
Wi' pith this day.


Come, let a proper text be read,
An' touch it aff wi' vigour,
How graceless Ham leugh at his dad,
Which made Canaan a nigger;
Or Phineas drove the murdering blade,
Wi' whore-abhorring rigour;
Or Zipporah, the scauldin jad,
Was like a bluidy tiger

There, try his mettle on the creed,
An' bind him down wi' caution,
That stipend is a carnal weed
He taks by for the fashion;
And gie him o'er the flock, to feed,
And punish each transgression;

Gie them sufficient threshin;
Spare them nae day.

An' toss thy horns fu' canty;

But steek your gab for ever;

An' turn a carpet weaver

Grunts out some Latin ditty;
And Common-sense is gaun, she says,
To mak to Jamie Beattie
Her plaint this day.


But there's Morality himsel',
Embracing all opinions;
Hear, how he gies the tither yell,
Between his twa companions!
See, how she peels the skin an' fell,
As ane were peelin onions!
Now there, they're packed aff to hell,
An' banish'd our dominions,
Henceforth this day.


O happy day! rejoice, rejoice!
Come bouse about the porter!
Morality's demure decoys
Shall here nae mair find quarter:
Mackinlay, Russell, are the boys
That heresy can torture;
They'll gie her on a rape a hoyse,
And cowe her measure shorter
By th' head some day.


Come, bring the tither mutchkin in,
And here's—for a conclusion—
To ev'ry New Light mother's son,
From this time forth, Confusion!

We'll light a spunk, and ev'ry skin,
We'll rin them aff in fusion
Like oil, some day. 

Turtles are dragons
And dragons are squrills.
Life twinkles
Beyond the imagination.
Creating monsters out of air, 
And nightmares out of smoke.

Once I could remember
Toy planes and cities
Runways with green
Golden lights, 
Johnson grass jungles, 
A stately lost land.

War.
Did we forget
The ideas of innocence? 
Did the dragons
Create the fear, 
The evil? 

Did we learn too well
That hate can kill, 
And gold can be fake? 

Or does the fairytale end; 
With cities in ruin, 
And planes that blow up

They told us all 'to just stay put, '
Breathing ashes and blackened soot, 
'Put a towel against the door, '
'Wet it first, put it on the floor; '
'The Firemen were on the way, '
That's what said that day; 
But I've always had an ornery streak, 
When told to obey and to be meek, 
We were told to wait in that fiery din; 
'Be patient, the firemen were coming in; '
But I rebelled; I could not sit still, 
I would not cling to the windowsill, 
I was tired of always following orders, 
I had to think of my two daughters; 
So for once I dared to rebel
To exit from that burning hell; 
As in the fires of Serengeti, 
In whirling smoke and wild confetti, 
I held a towel to my face, 
A savage in a human race; 
Through the choking smoke and fire
Stumbling in the twisting gyre, 
Blindly, pushing, through the smell
I made it to the South stairwell; 
I joined a mob of screams and cries, 
Of burnt white shirts and silken ties; 
Of torn pants suits and sooted skirts, 
The stairway lights flashing on alert; 
Rebels all we descended
Heedless of whom we offended; 
In the crowd a woman fell, 
Who she was I could not tell, 
Yet I stopped to help her up, 
How odd she held a coffee cup; 
Down and down we stumbled down, 
A woman wore a wedding gown, 
In the stink and smoke and fire, 
Careless of our ruined attire, 
We stumbled downward in our haste, 
Our only thought to escape; 
We met the firemen coming up, 
Our downward flow slowed abrupt; 
We let them pass, they let us pass, 
Above we heard a roaring crash; 
From above fell chunks of debris, 
We ran downward one thought to flee; 
But the firemen shoved us to run up, 
Anger flared, some were cuffed; 
We pushed downward amid the screams
We heard the wail of police sirens; 
And suddenly I was in the lobby, 
My knees were shaken, my steps were wobbly; 
I was led away cut and bruised, 
I realized I had lost my shoes; 
I staggered barefoot up the street, 
In a rain of paper sheets; 
Whose files these were I didn't know, 
But they all came down like scattered snow; 
I was ushered on by waving cops, 
'Head North! ' they shouted, I didn't stop 
I saw a priest give a man extreme unction, 
In the middle of a cross street junction; 
I was alive, I had rebelled, 
I walked Northward from that evil smell. 

how many died that day

how many died

and how many have died. 
how many young boys
sent off to war? 
how many citizens of Iraq? 
Afghanistan? 
how many women and children? 

how many deaths
does it take for
us to finally understand? 

killing is wrong! 
one death does not
justify another! 
murder does not
heal wounds.

the value of life.

the cause for mourning, 
and the sadness!.
clouds of angry concrete dust
born of rubble
born of ugliness
man-made thunderheads boiling and roiling 
clouds like dark soulless monsters
billowing around the corners billowing up the streets
chasing down the survivors swallowing them up
in jet-fueled hatred and ground-up debris
a legion of darkness erupting from the depths of hell
from that churning burning perdition residing in the hearts of fallen man 
blotting out the sun
in a morning eclipse in a mourning hour
burying the city in a swirling shroud of bone meal
blanketing the sidewalks in a cloak of gray ground steel
writing history in seething autumn scripts made of toxic fog and metal smog
from those churning burning clouds like dark soulless monsters
billowing around the corners billowing down the streets
chasing down the survivors swallowing them up
yet
above the blackened clouds of roiling and boiling concrete dust 
white papers by the thousands 
floating softly down 
drifting gently down
from floor after floor of business desks
white papers descending
spiraling down on pristine wings 
then uplifted and carried hither and thither on soft currents of air 
perfectly surviving
above the billowing clouds moiling and coiling
perfectly surviving
above the dark thunderheads boiling and roiling
perfectly surviving 
thousands of paper so thin and so delicate 
so ultimately
useless
surviving
swirling white and whole and 
unharmed inside the murderous clouds
paper butterflies dancing a dance of life over all this death
how can it be
that papers survive and people die
that papers fly and people plummet
.
Bundles of Each year a fractal of the greater life
Time and passage
Pain in nerve and bone
The shadows of their lives
Stain holy ground 
The essence of their being
A part of our everyday smells
We move amongst the worms of time
Broken down to the simple core
A changed world 
Yet oddly the same
They are among us 
In the rustle of a leaf
In the empty space of a quiet moment
And the searing light of a 
Newborn’s eyes


Whenever I am happy
The maternal eyes stare
Who had lost her child
In the bus accident
Can I still be happy? 

Whenever I relish food
The hungry saliva drips
 From hungry stomachs
Teasing my appetite
Can I still gulp my food? 

Whenever I sing
The retired ear drums beat
Vestigial vocal cords vibrate
Of many talking eyes
Can I still hum a tune? 


When I sleep in my mansion
Sad penury glares
Out of the deadly black night
Making me ghastly scared
Can I still sleep? 
And I lay awake


blue rivers of life
with woods
and snow

painted on canvas
with hands of love

reaching in to hearts


Weaving white gold
light the shadows hold

morrow's days
glowing rays

sleep
in deep


Lust and love is everywhere, 
It keeps on burning, in my skin.
I see your face here and there, 
But forgetfulness soon shall win. 

Treason's for our love begun, 
When I found the 'drugs of joy'.
Thereon started lust and fun, 
For a party zone driven boy. 

If you drift to my cloud one day, 
Don't mind, if I've forgotten you.
My ship did leave your 'home bay'
And feelings, we can't renew. 

To Noah eons past, 
Is echoed down the ages, 
Throughout His world so vast.

And nature in strange ways, 
Entreating us to do one thing, 
"Just give to Me your praise".

What you have, He can remove, 
In the twinkling of an eye; 
He can bless you if He wishes; 
Choose how you live or die.





A furniture store, no problem, the fire department is on it’s way, 
year old Jonathan Tyrrell was trapped inside the deadly blaze, 
 a voice from the department told him exactly what he must do, 
Too lightheaded, only remembering two strong hands pulling him through.

A routine fire for just over total years of service they’d seen it before, 
Window here, wall there, just save an employee lying down on the floor, 
Experience, best of training, friends, how could there be something more? 
This time the fire had a mind of it’s own raging deep within the furniture store.

Mandatory sprinklers in older buildings failed in Legislature two years before, 
I wonder what those who voted no are saying today behind closed doors? 
This is where I would start my investigation, finding out on what authority? 
lives were lost, Captain’s, Engineer’s, Firefighter’s, and 

A so-called super store became an inferno with degree heat, 
Causing steel beams to twist spreading so fast, no chance for a retreat, 
Not that these brave individuals would have been the kind to run and hide, 
Only to regroup with plan "B", fighting in another direction once outside.

The rescued employee from  along with his daughter and wife, 
On Wednesday arrived at Station No.ever so grateful for his life, 
It is the worse loss of firefighter lives since the terrorist attack, 
Hopefully, next time suits in the Legislature will have their back.

Was this arson, an accident, what in the heck could go wrong? 
Trained officers no less, one-day after Father’s Day, now they are gone? 
Finger pointing already, he said, she said, why were these decisions made? 
Too bad cops can’t handcuff the flames and interrogate the blaze.

Homeland Security, CIA, FBI, local and state police patrol for peace, 
Satellites, monitors, cameras, motion detectors, dogs & cops on the beat, 
Sensor beams, intelligence, shared information, in unison working hard, 
Who could ever imagine nine would lose their lives in our own backyard

I am 
A bug snug in our hearth's rug
I am
A windchime tinkling your heart in a rhyme
I am
A rose releasing all my fragrance in your nose! 
I am 
A glow worm lighting up your coke and rum! 
I am
The yearning for a puff; if you cant, its so bloody tough! 
I am
The flood  of blood in your muscles! 
I am
Just a bum having somewriting fun


Three months in the clinic, one should be ready.  I look down on you, one more escapade, to go down on you, and sharpen the blade.  
[I did not know my nails would have grown so strong].  
I grab you -both hands- to feel the skin and fatty, pillow-like juice.  I shake you and I pull you out -you nasty rubber- you pull back in.  How much bigger can you get?  I inhale too deeply for my strength -anymore- and push the air to swell you, happy moments for my kids, indeed.  Magnificent, so many years’ confusion.  I do not know how the struggles have gotten me here, the struggles of too little food, or the struggles of too many a food.
	The fool inside you, is he still there?  Memory of a lifetime gulping, shame, retreat.  I soothe the grabbing, squeeze a strange spot in a wrinkle and cuddle the umbilical cord. 
[I did not know my nails could have grown so big] 
I am so sorry to start squeezing you, tummy, all over again.  Does my dance stumble -on stone abdominals, on bones, on very full guts? - do not ask me, 
[you should know better] 
Why don’t you have a mouth on your own?  Well, I guess I won’t stand in front of the wall mirror this time, I’ll just grasp the hand one not to feel you mine just as once.  Get a mirror on your own, so many actions you do take despite me.
	I am so sorry; a tearing would never have crossed my mind -not uncontrolled-
But look at you, (my soul is flying already)   smiling at last, silent all these years, so many years struggle I, idle you.  Now check your own mirror idol, that two nipples have no eyebrows but do a sight a umbilical nose, check, I say, your bloody grin will soon be hungry, hasn’t it been so all these years of discussion?  Shall I run out to show the evil nurses that I, too, have two faces anymore

If I were given good parents 
How I would have come to You? 
Thank You for making me understand
That Your love is the true parental love! 

If I were given the beloved whom I liked
How I would have come to You? 
Thank You for making me understand 
That You are the true lover of my soul! 

If I were given the job which I hunted
How I would have come to You? 
Thank You for making me understand
That seeking a place in Your heart is the best job

If I were given good health
How I would have come to You? 
Thank You for making me understand
That Your grace follows me surely when I am ill

If I were given abundant wealth
How I would have come to You? 
Thank You for making me understand
That excessive wealth is the graveyard for the soul

If I were given no severe problems in life
How I would have come to You? 
Thank You for all my problems and strife
Without which how I would have come to You? 			ight be, the blowing wind could stay still! 
Mighty sea waves could become immobile! 
Mind - Thoughts after thoughts ever bubble; 
Mother! How do I yet switch them into nil? 

Snake’s trial to swallow itself from its tail, 
And a child catching its own shadow will fail! 
Can anyone comprehend mind of thoughts full, 
By reasoning, again generating thoughts null? 

Though it seems mind control is impossible, 
Ramana had shown a way of enquiry logical; 
Ramakrishna told the only way is devotional; 
I am confused, Mother, I the ignorant stumble! 

To help the world some may build huge hospital; 
Some to stimulate young students may run school; 
Some to spread spirituality may assemble temple; 
But is there an act, not tainted by ‘I’ even a little? 
 
I understand the only best help to world in roll, 
Is to stop the thoughts in mind which always coil.
Without Your grace how it will become feasible? 
A touch by Your toe is enough; at Your feet, I fall! 



Her wisdom driving away any boredom, 
Sprinkling philosophy and philanthropy! 

Her jingling words mingling with care and love, 
Changing any gloomy place into a blooming palace! 

She is the binding bond of staff band
Arranging table party is her stable duty! 

Her boldness pulling legs of even baldheads (Like Mr. Yadav) , 
Protecting the feelings of her fellow beings! Amma, am I dim-witted? 	People have something or other to cling upon earth
Amma, tell me any thing except You which is worth! 
My mind finds nothing permanent to hold upon living
Amma, tell me something which is ever bliss giving! 

People spend days and nights amassing ever more money
As days roll-As I am approaching the end of my little life
I am afraid, had I wasted my life in seeking you with strife? 

I am hurt to see wise people victorious, happy and joyful 
With all accumulated money and prosperity in plentiful
When my eyes are still wet with tears in search of you.
Amma, am I dim-witted? Will I die without seeing you? 	The war between Devaas and Asuraas.	Amma, 

The more You churn my mind, it vomits more poison, 
As that of the mythical Devaasura churning milk ocean! 
Swallow the poison lest I and my environs will be spoilt! 

You use both my good and evil nature to stir my brain, 
As how Vishnu used both Devaas and Asuraas to churn! 
Hope is there one day or other, there will appear nectar, 
As how Devaas got eventually nectar to achieve rapture! 

 (Amma says: If one advances initially in spiritual practices, there will appear situations that reveal that we are bad. One need not worry about it. When a floor is moped after a long time, a lot of dirt will come. But after two three trials the floor will become spotless clean. Same thing holds true with mind too. Our mind must have had all the dirt as it was not cleaned for a long time. Through meditation, bhajan or by japa when one cleans it initially he/she will notice so much grim coming out of mind!) 

Note: Devaas – gods; Asuraas – demons; All Hindus know the famous fabulous story of Churning the Milk Ocean by Devaas and Asuras  -  ome say my writings are not clear; 
Some say my writings are out of gear; 
Some say my writings are from tears; 
Some say my writings have many errors; 

Yet I continue to write from my heart; 
I know You will not toss them as waste! 
Words may betray my emotion and pain; 
I know You will not fling them as vain! 

My lame language tries to build a hidden bridge, 
Between our hearts where love is the only wedge.
You, being compassion hearted mother of all, 

As a cripple desires for honey on top of a hill, 
I the most undeserved crave for Your love still, 
Even an earthly mother responds dumb child’s cry.
I know You too will soothe me; thus I ever try! 	 never felt like I had worn out my passion; 
Instead, revered within me that obsession! 

To love her, I never craved she be next to me, 
My memories she engaged, and that just to be! 

To memorize her face, I never needed her snap; 
But, could see her; whenever I would take a nap! 

I had amassed her smiles in my thoughts, for later
And, had built the castle in the air, just to feel better! 

Then another year had passed, I just hadn't known
In my trance, just see where my worship had flown! 

It was an abstraction, but to be soundless was my fate; 
This adoration is my pleasure and thus today I'd narrate! 

I spent some lonely years, cherishing her every moment; 
Nurturing all those memories, how wonderful and pleasant! 

I had dedicated some space & time, in my life, to this devotion; 
That passion is alive but dormant & life's a lopsided commotion

Mountain tops, those uncut yet chiseled rocks

Stunned by the sculpted contours, which shocks! 

 

Gentle winter breeze, swayed in sweet zests

Riding the barren on tandems, are desert fests! 

 

Dusty old trails on the sand, those ecstasies

It was just wonderful, beyond our fantasies! 

 

Thank you family, 

You got rid, my fear of the unknown, now I sway

From mysterious shackles; watch me break away

Bulldoze a desire; that’s crime! 
Like nick the bud, before time.

I had spent some time without grunge.
Why cut my feathers? Oh, to plunge! 

That lexis had me rammed to gloom.
Now queasy of love; I will not bloom! 

I had this vivid castle in Spain! 
Then, why detach and give me pain

Ah! Never will! Why should I fib? 
Why should I even break my rib? 

Isn’t life, journey of many spars? 
Wrangles we have, are just farce! 

Some just play it often, as a game, 
I’d write to kill grief & follow fame

Let her think, that--
I’m rogue & just the villain of a man; 
I filch the heart and that’s all I can! 

Let her think, that--
I’m felon & just the twinge of a man; 
I strip the belief and that's my clan! 

Let her think, that--
I’m a slink & just the wanton of a man; 
I ravage all hopes and deem to abandon

My kinds are charades you can see
Always, found lingering in murk! 

As someone's prayer get answered –
Within some mist of new-found love! 

That ardor lost was never there; 
Thus, I did depart sometime back! 

But even then, respect was some grime, 
That was thrown over my grave! 

I did fancy some life for me, but
Always burst like a bubble in the air

Nowadays, I burrow deep into my heart; 
To find some courage to live another day! 
Deep within me, I bowed to be superficial; 
Because, that is all what I wish to be seen! 

Beforehand, I used to be just bountiful; 
I loved affluently but now so impoverish! 
My heart was copious and swelled for all; 
Look at it now; it's a zilch – beyond repair! 

Nowadays, I find that I'm not endearing 
Just tainted to be insipid and hackneyed! 
Today, I implore that I be callous evermore
Or just snuff my heart and be freed forever

When the rain falls from the sky above, 
When the sun shines on a  bright sunny day.

When the wind blows, and the trees sway.
When the snowflakes fall and glisten.

When the earth trembles and opens to swallow.
When the sea lifts and the waters tower.

When the sounds of thunder are heard.
When the funnel winds shatter our existence  

When we witness the forces of nature.
There is no doubt of it’s creator. 
We shall remain in awe, of his worth.


I mask my heart and thrive on soul-felony! 

I pleasure in being a dodger to my life; 
I mask my feeling and titivate on core-strife! 

I am the magnate of much tribulation; 
I mask my face and flourish psyche-frustration! 

I am a whopping debtor in a bond loved; 
I mask my status and brandish in the love-need! 

I am the backer of love smarting & twinge; 
I mask my life and thus, dance to my own-dirge

I close my eyes and think only of you, 
for you are my drink of champagne, 
my light, my treasure, my cup of tea, 
my love, you are everything to me.

I see a smiling face with eyes that glow.
You dazzle, a star of a great picture show.
You are truly the apple of my eye.
You stand out while other’s walk by.

My thoughts are filled with images of you, 
baby, I can’t think of anything I’d rather do.
Will you give me your love, and walk down the aisle.
Oh please baby, make me smile.

more than one.
Searching the bars to
have his fun.
His philosophy, 
simple and true.
I’ll always come out
on top of you.
The years flew by, 
loneliness set in.
While growing old, 
frail and thin, 
he longed for the presence
of a good woman to sit
lovingly next to him. 

Today I give back to the earth, 
showing my body's worth.
My nutrients feed the rich black soil, 
no more to work hard or toile.
to give freely of a body dead, 
to say good-bye and move ahead. 

I’ve made it through the day, 
everything seems fine. My problems
only come in the evening time.
my head lay quietly to rest, put my
mind to the test.

Once the lights dim, the room begins to spin.
I’m sure there’s a ghost living within.
I hear the cracks and the creeks coming from
The floors.  The blowing of wind filtering 
through the door.
 
I hear rather loud voices not making any sense.
and the creaking of gates from the outside fence.
I need to get up to turn on the light.
My  mind is now in  a constant state of fright

A surge of light creeps under the door, 
loud footsteps walking down the hall floor.
My mind says get up, but my body won’t move.
Black shadows are dancing, filling every groove.

The room is like a moonlit dreary dark night, 
with shadows after midnight all in sight.
I hear the loud voices ring out once again, 
only this time they’re calling out my name.
My mind confused, am I going insane? 

My heart is beating oh so very fast, 
How long will this fear over me last.
Suzanne, Suzanne it’s time to get up.
I opened my eyes, wiped the sweat from 
My brow.   A feeling of relief came over
me now.

I would pull you out from your barrenness! 

Even if I would have had to lug you along; 
I would take you beyond your somnolence! 

Even if I would have to traverse some obscurity; 
I would steer clear off the path of my demise! 

Even if I would have had been distanced wide; 
I would just reappear on your beckon, into life! 

O where would I hide? I simply falter on a lie! 
You take me along to the other side, if you die! ! 

I’m the man behind the bars
We talk through walls and I wonder how I got here
I’m a boy, I’m a little too trusting
And I can’t help wondering what you think of me

Silence, it’s the façade you build
With you oh-too familiar condescending
Pretense that you have for the world
And you’re just too afraid to tell the truth

I’m a cynic, I curse myself
I kick myself in reflections in distorted
Nightmares, dirty puddle dripping voices
They tell me that you laugh about me

And you’re the worst part of it all
Ninety-four in black painted on the mailbox
You’ll stop to look around
But on the ground in front is where you’ll find me

I’m not offering you my soul
My flesh should have been enough
Can’t you see that I bled for you? 
Stop your hideous masquerade
Parading ‘round me in that face
Does he still not know that it’s a fake? 

You’re a fake, undertake every little piece of heart and soul
And lock it in the casket you keep behind your bedroom door
You lie me in the ex-room fire, ashes spewed upon the floor
And there he goes attached to you, riding in your existential
Fate, you mess with fate, every feeling mixed with hate
When you think about the time we spent floating in your heaven’s sake
Of course he’s killing time while you put on your other face
‘Cause you know I’m the only one that can stand to see you naked

I’m not your ghost
I’m not your ghostam just vicious
have forever flawed
tried to make me victim
when you pained 

always shoved emotions down your throat
and told you not to make me the world

am just vicious
have forever flawed
tried to make me victim
when you pained 

you were so blind, anguished and buoyant
you couldn’t see I was just that dark hollow

am just vicious
have forever flawed
tried to make me victim
when you pained 

I was just too selfish and continue to be that
yet, you continue to teach me so much- 
like not to hate anyone else more than I hate myself.

are just vicious
was forever flawed
just to make me the victim
you just always pawned--It all seems such a long journey with an arduous quest; 
I was egocentric, arrogant and that may cost me the best! 

I'd been imprudently searching for love all my life; 
and, she seemed like a blessing, a key to my strife! 

But, I am unfortunate.  and, I do not deserve to be loved! 

In my prudence chose to hurt her and have paid the cost, 

It was once that she was all I wanted, she was all I needed, 
but, now I've pushed her away towards freedom she warranted! 

I am aware of an agonizing remorse that I've caused on my own, 
And, I know I have cut her deep inside, just straight to the bone! 

Now, please tell her that I need her to outlive my love & survive, 
And, if she's still gloomy after me, then I'd be more dead than alive

Having written this poem in  I felt the need to re-compose as per my experiences thereon. .. Please also read poem# I wandered the dry deserts, mere lonely now; 
Resembling the burning sun, like a brilliant light but! 
I am my own specter, just frightened how; 
Resembling the gleaming moon, like a shining night but! 

I wandered the dry deserts, alas lonely now; 
Resembling the falling star, like a lightening flash but! 
I am my own felon, yet perilous how; 
Resembling the scheming barb, like a shooting dash but! 

I wandered the dry deserts, Oh! So lonely now; 
Resembling the drowning shark, like a weighty might but! 
I am my own charade and repentant how; 
Resembling the howling snivel, like a flying kite but! 

But, I still wander those scorching sands of dry deserts; 
To burn my desires and rip my heart, yet in comfort how

My voice is forever so malleable, 
I call out a name to create an aura! 
Avoid that call, my aura is hoaxing
I have the veneer of scoundrels! 

My glance is forever so defying, 
Those fleeting looks are just pretence! 
Just take heed else it will impair
As I am just the portrait of glitch! 

My skills are forever so villainy, 
I am a conflict to the image of love! 
Just baulk, I have poisoned my soul
Now, even my breath is infectious

Do not get slashed for love -
For that will always be afar! 
Do not get crammed for nothing; 
Better be spaced from love, thus! ! 
The sun never meets the moon, but..
When it does, either has to eclipse! 

Do not get embittered by those eyes
Smiles often in love are illusionary with time! 
Do not let any soul touch your heart
Those caresses can strangle the joy with time! 
Many a barb and much anguish, all with time! 

So, let none fill you or your life with lies

With some fantasies of beautiful or joyous love

Oh! Do not feel sorry when I would go to meet my maker; 
I could be a content soul, just mocking the soul-stealer! 

Do not say goodbye, when I would lie still on the pyre; 
I may just surround me with some forged flames of fire! 

Do not garland my picture and do not wail my dearth; 
Had been an aimless dart, just faking a golden rebirth

I had known some lasses in my life; 
And, few were very close to my soul! 

I did folly! Put my heart at stake many times; 
Every time I would break, yet to revive again! 

I had never loved any one less than the other; 
Yet, one by one all of them had left and gone! 

I had never deceived, with none of them; 
Some left for money and others for men! 

Some did repent, and tried to retract their steps; 
Now, they would not leave! I made them friends. 

I’d take my heart with me, the day I’d expire; 
And, rescue this world from dismal and dire! 

I had, in my life-time spread enough misery; 
And, I regret that lexis in my feeble poetry! 

You will not lament the day I depart this life; 
And, desist to hold my heart, so full of strife! 

I’d take my heart with me, the day I’d expire; 
And, rescue this world from that awful mire

I twisted a beautiful maple leaf into a cup; 
And, collected those morning dews of life! 

I conquered those dark & dense forests; 
Could see her shining brighter than the night! 

I had waited for her, much beyond the after; 
But, I lost her just before I could touch her

A rose for you, 
A rose for me.
Between, thorns so filthy
Let those ever be, as is rosy! 
A rose for me, 
A rose for you

I would like to gift you the print of my mind! 

When you are much old and gray; 
Trying to hold the fall, when full of sleep! 
Just nodding by the fire-side, take down this print, 
And, hold it in your soft hands.
Slowly read through those lost memories, which –
Your eyes had not seen the shadows dark & deep! 

How many loved those youthful moments of your joyous charm –
They admired your beauty & grace with love - false or true! 

Now, do look into the dark shadows of this print and recollect –
But, was there one man who loved the pilgrim soul in you; 
had he loved the sorrowful contours of your changing face? 
Did he get void into the background - in the dark oblivion? 

Just when you were beside those glowing charmers of youth! 
Murmur, did he never? A little sadly, how love fled his life--
Did he run away from you, into the deserts far away? 
Did he? And, did he hide his face amid the sands of time! 

Today – please read in between those lines
Read in that print – that you have today, in your hand.

Glorious more, you never actually have been – 
Precious more, you could never have been –
This piece of print is the journey of your shadows, 

He is still admiring today, the pilgrim soul in you and not the glory gone--

Today, I would like to gift you.    only that print of my mind

Listen to those strident sounds that my heart makes; 
Or just hear my shattering silence, how nicely it fakes! 

Watch me put-on the phony face on my wrecked self; 
Or just rejoice with me, the despair of this solitary elf! 

Now, read those depressing lines that talk my awful life; 
Or just visualize a vacant page, painted of my grim strife! 

Just peek at me put-on a façade on this screaming page; 
Or just celebrate with me, the gloom of this delayed age! 

And, walk on those paths that my dazzling soul smoothens; 
Or just watch a perfect sight, as my compelling mind softens! 

Now, foresight me fake this misery on my wrinkled face; 
Or just delight with me, as I conclude my abstract chase

Today, I had just felt like a turbid mirror; 
And, messed the dreams I long did hoard! 
I did feel, I failed those thousand notes, 
The notes that I cherished long in stealth! 

Today, I have let you down so dreadfully; 
And, crashed those hopes I always admired.
I did feel, layers of rime on my blessed soul; 
The soul that I nurtured with complete pride! 

Today, I am dressed complete yet feel nude; 
And, I carry my nude in shame for this view.
I do feel mortified for all these veiled sins; 
The sins that I pledged for reasons unknown

I know some orchids in the valley of flowers.
I know some tropical flowers with the long names.
I know the birds that fly miles to migrate for comfort.

Those orchids did not have to shine in the valley of flowers.
Those tropical flowers wouldn't have to bloom during summer. 
And, the birds do not have to fly the miles and migrate for comfort.

Nights wouldn't have to turn into days, the sun wouldn't have to burn, 
The summer nights did not have to be cooler, nor the sky bluer- 
----------- if only I had you.

No longer must the orchids shine or the flowers bloom, 
and honestly, the rivers could stop flowing or the wind could stop blowing.

If only I had you--
-- the world could go do however and whatever; 
Because we'd finally be together.  but the sky doesn't have to fall! 
The sun doesn't have to burn the night and light the world, 
nothing has to be off beam and nothing has to feel right. 
If only I had you
 I would care less, the world could stop spinning

I yearn for an expression of your love for me, but quiet are your lips.
Your lips blush readily with the essence of rubies.
They breathe life, they tremble and quiver, 
Yet they are silent - with the words I want to hear.

Have they nothing to say? They have, I know.
Love governs them, but in silence! 
And I wouldn’t have them any other way
Because, now I feel there is no need to say.

You love me but your feelings you suppress
What your heart feels your lips cannot express
It’s true, words often cannot reveal the true magic of love's potion
for words don’t match the deep density of emotion

My heart tells me your heart needs me and you are happy, without lament, 
for it is not a bondage but a devoted bond that cements.
Your smile shows the love in your soul and my soul glows 
I am content, I need no words from you anymore of your consuming love for me. 

I was rootless, nomadic, drifting and roving;  
And, I knew many in this journey of strife! 
Many assert are friends and many skirmishing; 
Here, I was learning the intricate ways of life! 

Into the transparent layers of blistering memory; 
Just, I saw reflections of my shortened feeling! 
Many had just disappeared and many still spry, 
And, I was standing amongst thousand, cheering! 
 
Oh! My days are afresh, I am not nomadic or drifting
Drowned all my memories in the fiery lake of thought! 
Today, I am not recklessly rootless nor am I roving; 
Blissful, how I am narrating here an expressive ode

It sometimes is a droll, atypical how life is; 
It’s quaint to remember, words you did not say! 

Oh! How I remember the times we did not share; 
And the way, you could never wipe my brackish tears! 

I did not know, for me if you were the person who cared; 
Why did I adore those words, which you never expressed? 

I commit to memory; we never had the world in our hands; 
How can I never forget the days we never had spent together? 

I cannot remember the days when you were just everything for me.
It’s amusing thus, that my mind used to say – you would be mine! 

Whatever I have, are impressions of my memories in the desert sand.

Now, when my days exhaust, I wanted to realize them as a big dream; 
And yearn to confess, of those abstract smiles that lit up my illusory days

I was never there, when you had laughed; 
And, nor was I there to give you happiness! 
I was not there, to excite your life with fun; 
Neither there, when the sun had shone on you! 

Where was I, when the time was right for you? And, 
Where was I, when birds sang thousand melodies? 
I wonder where I was. Wandering the roads away; 
Oh! Where was I, when youth had kissed a glorious age? 

I may never have been there for you, however
But, I want to be there when you would be cheerless! 
I have not been there, when life had excited you; 
But, allow me to be there, when the day is gloomy! 

I wish to be there, when the time would be off-beam; 
And, if the birds would stop singing those melodies! 
I just want to find my way back home; our sweet home; 
And, kiss you when you could get that ache, due to age

I –
A child who drank love from my mother’s brimming breasts; 
A toddler who ate affection from father’s tiresome turmoil; 
A student who gulped facts from master’s marvellous minds; 
A youth who tried to steal a heart of same thump and rhythm. 

The ‘I’ is a group of bits and pieces of love and affection! 
Where is the soul among these fragments? A true detection! 

I –
A daughter supposed to serve parents old age by my own hands; 
A mother indebted to give my breasts to toothless mouth of kids; 
A wife obliged to give my heart to my spouse as honestly he bids; 
A teacher dutiful to restore my brain to young lasses and lads; 

The ‘I’ is split into bits and pieces of love and affection! 
Where is the soul among these fragments? A true detection! 

Amma, 
Why this trade of relations masked under name of love? 
All giving and taking the rules of humanity should I bow? 
The way out of this ever whirling karmas you should show; 
Total surrendering to this tiresome soul your grace must bestow! 
(*****************************)  




 (Thursday)  
(*****************************)I could not love you, dear so much
Loved I not, my honor more! 

For a happier lot, it never have been
Nor shall ever be, unlike this

Comes once in a year, festival Bhogi; 
Homes sweet are scanned thoroughly; 
Amassed out are ugly and useless outfits; 
Consumed they are in bonfire flames! 

Dwellings then are decked with
Fresh fragrant flowers from forest; 
Golden grains gush out giant granaries; 
People put on new dresses on Pongal! 

Amma, 

Let your lotus feet step into my heart once a year at least, 
To purge away all unwanted names and forms utter waste; 
Let your pure love make a blazing bonfire and burn away, 
All these useless thoughts which make my mind sway! 

Let your lotus hand pour ever green Bhakthi sweet; 
Let pure devotion fill all nook and corner in my heart; 
Help me to undress petty ‘I’ off my little soul tiresome; 
Help me to put cosmic ‘I’ on and make it handsome!

People would go and take her divine hug to remove their samskaras and to receive blessings.)(This trial fails to measure the height of TAMIL and TAMILLAND in all its dimensions. Tamil literature is vast. Its depth is immeasurable. 
I tasted just a drop! From time immemorial Tamil land clasps all, till today, whoever comes to make an esteemed living. Tamil Temples and related arts could not be spoken by me. I am just like an ignorant frog which does not know anything about lotuses though it lives with them!)

org  and Hindu religion)For me, the sun could stop shining.
Would I care if it stopped raining? 
I had not asked for these pains –
Oh! Why should I get this twinge? 

I had never realized my love for you
Then, why is it that I can’t let go of you? 
Honestly, I never had had shed tears
Never thought, for you I could fall apart! 

But, it’s not your fault, my dilemma
You hardly knew this affection, fondness! 
This obtuse liking of mine, reaching nowhere
Was strange to you, how I had loved you! 

I remember all those sweet things I did –
The way I worshipped your thoughts; and
The way I decorated every string of memory! 
I remember not any time I needed to cry.

What’s wrong, if it showers a million droplets? 
These memories were always sweet and not pain; 
I can fight that twinge and let my thoughts fly

Amma, 

Bestow my ears a boon to hear

Your honey tone that flute and veena vie in vain to outshine 
That all tuneful tools and all seven sweet notes fail to beat; 
That delights the mind and merges into undying speech of silence; 
That bulldozes the burly ‘I’ into dust, by its mere pulsation! 

Then let my ears hear not, anything else in the entire universe! 
--
Bestow my eyes a boon to see

Your divya rupa with wilting wreath of bright blossoms bees sought; 
The beaming beauty with a crescent decked crown and jingling jewels; 
The motherly motion in radiant red silk, smiling and coming closer; 
The outspread arms to padlock me in your love, enveloping eternity! 

Then let my eyes see not, anything else in the entire universe! 
--
Bestow my nose a boon to smell

Your maternal aroma, firing up faith, that you are always around me; 
From which rose, sandal, jasmine and all drag fragrance in fragments; 
From which words ‘sacred’ and ‘sanctified’ got significance or sense; 
That which alone could spell out the stinking stench of my secular life! 

Then let my nose smell not, anything else in the entire universe! 
--
Bestow me a boon

To enter your abode where holy lamps deck with light and scent; 
To turn into little toddler crawling towards your lap soft and comfort; 
To be fed with your divine hands the milk of wisdom and insight; 
To sleep in your lap for ever and never return to the world of karmas! 

Then let me not take anymore birth!

If, she would have caught the sight of me, 
And, she would have seen the genuine soul! 
I am sure of the fact that she would understand, 
That her sheer presence would send shivers to my nerves. 

Just through my eyes, if she would have seen herself! 

Truly if she knew, that only she did glimmer my soul
How I desire she had known me the way I had wished her! 
None else, but only she could have claimed my soul 
No one else, but only she would have arrested my heart.

Just through my eyes, if she would have seen herself! 

And, if she would have known all this then, who knows
She may have given up her wealth to hold my hands.
She may have sacrificed some sham moments of content! 
Just through my eyes, if she would have seen herself! 

Just through my eyes, if she would have seen herself

While gulping foodstuff in variety, 
With my spouse and children only, 
Forgetting about million folks, 
Who hunger for a single feast, 
Let me not talk of ADVAITA! 

While dressing my filthy body, 
By silky dress worth much money, 
Forgetting about countless sisters, 
Who long for a sarry just to alter, 
Let me not talk about ADVAITA! 

While dousing the fire of lust then and now, 
With my sweet heart in the name of love, 
Forgetting about numerous hearts, 
Who wait to be noticed their love beats, 
Let me not talk about ADVAITA! 

While I am prone to hurt my associate, 
If I cowardly test ADVAITA the vast, 
By piercing a dagger into another heart, 
Telling ‘body can not be cut or burnt! ’, 
Let me not talk about ADVAITA 

Amma, is it not wise to worship You, 
Though it is of primitive run through, 
Rather than wasting devotional twilights, 
With friends fatal and mortal ‘I’? 
Let me practice DVAITA only! 

As far as I bleed and mourn even a needle’s prick, 
As far as I am numb and hard to feel the pain
Of my fellow being when a thorn pricks him, 
Let me stick to You and You alone.
As far as the ‘I’ is there let me cling to ‘You’! 





She breathed verve in my life; 
In silent and smooth comfort! 
A life, which was soaking pain, 
And many unfolded mysteries! 

Now her breath brings me music
Quiet soothingly and gracefully! 
I endured some twisters, wild; 
Those wiped melancholies of life! 

Her breath has a special note; 
In silence it whispers in the air.
And, my librettos dance silently; 
In those limericks of my passion! 

Her breath drowns a pallid moon; 
And, it brings me that new dawn of life

Don’t put us down, until you understand, where
we are coming from without a helping hand.
We’re all alone, my husband walked away.
He left us to fend for ourselves each and every day.

You look at my children and me without sympathy.
Walk a mile in our shoes and then you’ll see.
Life is not what we expected it to be.
We will do our best to reach prosperity.

You call us welfare bums laugh at our tattered clothes.
Soon to become equals among the human race, 
tools needed to prosper, has finally taken its place.

We now walk on our own, holding our heads high.
No helping hand needed in order to get by.
Giving gifts of opportunity, our lives to gain.

We will never forget those hard and trying days.
Now life has changed its course, we are in the
drivers seat, we’ll never turn our backs on
anyone we meet. 

We’re marching for animal rights.
We have the right to fight.
Remember to hold you banners  high
As if they were going to touch the sky.

Walk with the turtles, especially old Myrtle.
She’s crawling slowly at the back.
Take Douglass the duck and Winslow the cat.
and push old Myrtle up the line, 
She’s ya know and still looking fine.

Today we march for all to see.
Come join with us, give us company.
We want to live and blend with you, 
be your faithful companions too.

We live in a country of prosperity, 
yet their are those  who treat us like dirt you see.
Give us what we deserve, we’ve paid our dues, 
or we may take charge and turn on you.

We are your pets, should be your pride and joy.
Yet you treat us sometimes as if we were  toys.
We want our coats brushed, our wings fluffed
our backs shined, not all but most of the time.

Look those two old hens look like pretty good friends. 
the dogs and cats are side by side, 
three little mice are trying to hide.
The ducks and geese are walking proud, 
and the monkeys are screeching out loud.

Pay attention to our demands, 
We want love and gentle patting hands.
We want to be fed on time each day
and given attention while we play.
We want you to protect our right to live.
In turn we have much love to give. 

I had this intense fire in my parched heart; 
Being blazed by the winds of my thoughts! 

I had this warring trial by a failed memory; 
Being prompted by many whims of my wits! 

I had resisted thru million deaths of my reasons; 
Being assaulted by the power of my visions! 

I had saved my sanity, in spite of a delusion; 
Being fired up by the probable of desires! 

I had not given up on life and fought the restrains; 
Being voted by the prayers offered by my angel

Every cause will have its own effect; 
Who could stop any befalling fate? 
Let me gain courage to accept any doom; 
As an effect of my own past karma; 

Amma, let any one hurt me to any extent; 
Let me not retaliate; Let me not complain; 
I will bear the pain, 
By just sitting at Your feet
And silently dropping tears; 
After all, my karma bundle is diminished! 
I can never take the post of evaluator; 
I don’t want to prove myself too; 
If I am innocent, I know; 
You will punish those who did harm; 

Even the holy Mother Ganges’ son, 
The great archer with unequal armour, 
The great celibate with untainted heart – Bhishma, 
Could not escape the tears 
At least at the end of his life, 
He was penalized to be in awful arrow-bed, 
For many days together until his repentance.

Your justice is beyond human perception; 
May be delayed, but never denied; 
Sinner may enjoy for the time being; 
Might be – he reaps his good karmas.
But the day will certainly come-
That day-
He will become the focus of his sins too

With you in my audience, 
How could I refuse to perform? 
If you would clap alone, 
Sounds of millions echo my ears!  

With you as my tower of strength, 
How could I not be flourishing? 
If alone, you would prop me up; 
Countless miles of burning sand I would walk! 

And, with you as my inspiration, 
Could I not write these throbbing words? 
If you alone and you alone could revere me; 
Thousand tirades of many an ally, I could shun! 

Oh! Without you in my abruptly reduced reverie, 
How could I refuse to meet my maker? 
If you would, just once if you would utter; 
Daggers of many, I could drive in my heart

A poem a day David said is his goal, 
his writing comes from the heart and soul.
I admire this precious blessed man.

showered with Angel glints from above.
Always having a kind word to say, 
through his poems, he saves the day.

One day I hope to meet this man, 
give him a big hug, shake his hand.
For now I’ll continue to enjoy his poems
along with others who also know him.

Your poem a day, I look forward to, 
May your words flow,  pen to page, 
and may you live  to a grand old age. 

I slowly immerse in a terrific quagmire of secular life.
I try to take my legs out of the marsh! 
Try to catch some grip out of the sticky mud! 
Alas! My own trails push me down and down.

I recognize some mighty force alone can get me out! 
Given up all my trails I call out - Amma! 
Who else is mightier than You? 
Come fast! Lest, I may be entirely devoured up! 

I trust no one but You! 
I trust not my mind – after all, it is a bundle of thoughts; 
I trust not my body – after all, it is a picture of mind; 
I trust not my affairs – after all, they are related to fragile body; 

I know, Your motherly heart could not stand my pathetic sight.
I know, Your motherly instinct will not let me go down.
Hold my hand in Yours; 
Drag me out of all – even out of body and mind; 
Wash all the grubby mud; 
Make me deserve to enter Your celestial castle. 

You would read me if you read these words.
These words would unveil many a mysteries; 
You would know, how often I tried in vain
But failed! To me, you are still so pure! 

You would read me if you read these words.
Snooping into a secret – my soul’s sweetest folly; 
Funny, how I caught on every word that you uttered.
And, I suffered your absence only through my silence! 

You would read me if you read these words.
Cuddling memories that mask in your purity; 
As if, in my mind – I would seek your hands
Holding in my palm just to kiss them softly! 

You would read me if you read these words.
If you let me in the blessedness of your memories; 
Like I let you live in my own memories, your second home. 
Though life always did hinder me for this, never to be shown! 

Now, when you thoughtfully analyze these obsessed lines
Of course, wouldn’t you want to ask: ‘But, Who is she? ’
The answer at that time, it may have had never come off me; 
Now, as you reappear – you have to learn, that she was you; only you! 

Majestic, high soaring eagle, 
Shoots down the sea’s seething surface, 
In a sec, a big fish writhes for life, 
In the strong clutches of its claw.

Booming eagle flies towards a tree, 
To have a feast of fish flesh.
But where from so many crows, 
Follow him to snatch his prey? 

In the struggle he dropped the fish.
With the falling fish, 
The numerous crows go! 
The eagle again soars high, 
Without those silly birds’ nuisance.

The moment you hold an object, 
Troubles are sure to encircle you.
As the hold is flung away, 
Those troubles too are also gone.

Morning, when you wake up, 
Bundle of your thoughts too rise with you.
When you dropp your self in deep sleep, 
Where those niggling thoughts are gone? 

Do you wish to be free as the soaring eagle? 
If so, dropp all your wishes! 
One way to let go wishes is -
Love deeply Mother Universe

I see you and my heart suffuses with love for you.
The sparkle of love overshadows the deceitful glitter of wealth; 
Filling my hungering heart with treasures in every pore.

The blush of love overpowers the greyest of strife; 
Filling my yearning soul with colors galore! 
The intoxication of love, overwhelms the travails of life; 
Filling my hankering with fulfilling ecstasy! 

Your love inspires in me, a plethora of possibilities -
The glimmer of hope; the euphoria of dreams
The surety of faith; respite from care
The anchorage of devotion; the bonding of commitment
The reverence of worship: the satisfaction of fulfillment
Thus, I bask happily in my love for you, because ----

only 'your' love makes my life worth living


It was told You would visit any devotee’s home, 
Who is really pure minded.
 
Though I knew I would fall only at the end of devotees’ line, 
I could not control my greediness to 
Have Your magnificent feet touching my home too.
 
I woke up unusually earlier that day, 
Cleaned each nook and corner of my little home; 
Decorated the entrance with colourful patterns; 
Lit the lamp which symbolizes Your presence; 
Added scent sticks also to welcome You.

With devotional songs in my lips; 
With lingering happiness in heart; 
With day dreams in my mind; 
I prepared a sacred sweet pongal for You, 
With overflowing love, in plenty.

I arranged carefully a seat for You to sit; 
Kept a glowing golden plate.
Then I waited for Your arrival, 
As a loving wife would wait for husband’s return; 
As a dear mother would wait for her child from school.

Time passed.
I waited to hear Your jingling anklets; 
Waited to have Your darshan in a radiant silk; 
Waited to see Your beaming face. 

But there appeared a beggar, 
With weary feet touching the colourful patterns, 
In muddy and grubby robes, 
With gloomy face and weak cry ‘Amma! ’

With a reluctant heart, 
I permitted him to take the seat decorated for You, 
I gave the sacred pongal  prepared for You, 
In the golden plate kept for You, 
To his unwashed hand for days together.

He relished and went away - but, 
Till today I do not know, 
Why didn’t You appear in a form as I expected! 
Till today I do not know, 
Was that You only came in beggar role! 
I convince myself that, that was You only, 
Lest, who would sooth the pain of collapsed expectations? 

(One wished to become a sanyasin, 
But, turned to be a householder!)Little Pansy's on cold winters morn void lifeless, 
for a ray of sun shine they await a kiss, 
for the world to see the beauty that lie on their stem,       
Once remove from night into thy sight,Amma, Are You a business minded mother? 

Why does a camel eat the thorny cactus, 
In spite of its mouth bleeding, while chewing? 
Since it is not given any chance to relish, 
Soft and green plants! No amma? 

Though I know for certain, 
Delight in enjoyments, lead to trouble, 
I’m unable to find other way! 
Why do I feed myself on earthly food? 
Since You are not ready to give me divine food.

As soon I was born, 
You left me in a wild jungle, 
And returned to Your glorious fort. 
I was fed by wild wolf; 
Brought up by the hands of untamed animals; 
It is really a miracle that I was not devoured by the forest! 

As I grow, every day, 
I realize that my home is not here; 
I really want to come to You; 
But is that easy to cut the ties
With the maternal harsh earth – 
Which, I still feel, is more compassionate than You! 

Why do, always, my five senses drift after worldly pleasures? 
Since as a business minded mother You never care for me! 
You are always busy with Your great children - 
Yogis, rishis, great aspirants, and others! 
You are so impatient to bring up a new born! 

If not, 
Why don’t You come near me with a mother’s fragrance? 
Why don’t You show my eyes Your enchanting form? 
Why don’t You sing lullaby to my thirsty ears? 
Why don’t You lift me to Your bosom? 
Why don’t You feed me Your holy milk? 
Why? Amma, Why? 
Don’t say I am not deserved! 
Is Your love too conditional, like the world’s

Foolish ambitions
The greed of gluttons
Dissembles the heart
Desires burn flesh
Summon him from the dark
Come forth minion of evil
Give your gift to him
Fulfill his heart fantasies
At the end of the river
Drink a stream of pain
Devil's gold is sweet
All who come to take
Will be fed with juicy lies
Fool there is no escape
A deal is a deal
You must pay its price

If a dirty pond could be filled with lovely crimson lotuses, 
If an ugly caterpillar transforms into a beautiful butterfly, 

Hope is there for me too; 
I’ll become your beloved child! 
Hope is there for me too; 
One day you will bedeck my revolting heart! 

Hope is there for me too; 
Your sweet name will capture my whole mind! 
Hope is there for me too; 
Some day my little self will dissolve in Your Love.

Hope is my only hold. 

If we forgive then what's left to forget. wriiten 



 Posted mma, I stand empty handed! 

I really did not know 
What gift should I select for you.
Money or honey? 
Milk or silk? 
Flower or fruit? 
Sweet pudding or tender coconut? 



You smiled at my silliness! And
You asked the whole heart of mine.
I was very happy that you asked for such a simple thing.
At once tried I to take my heart – 
To offer unto your lotus feet.

Not once, twice or thrice
I have been trying for years together
To lift my heart against the gravity of the earth
But I am unable to separate my heart 
Which is strongly attached to the world.

I tried all tricks to isolate it.
Meditation, Mantra, Prayer, Yoga-
Failure; utter failure! 

I stand, in front of you, empty handed


A Desert date-palm
Is, of course, rough and tough, 
To endure the desert climates.
Hard and prickly are its leaves, 
To save itself from its ruthless environs

But fruits of date–palm
Are sweet and delicious! 
Not a bit of bitterness of desert life! ! 
For a traveler in scorching sand, 
Date-palm offers revitalizing shade.

Though many troubles encircle you, 
As that of a desert palm, 
May the Almighty bestow you, 
Patience and forbearance, 
As that of sweet fruits of date-palm.

Though you are seated in a place, 
Where you ought to tackle, 
People with entirely different natures, 
As that of shade of a date-palm. 

It is an ever busy highway.
Above shines the hottest Sun of July.
Hardly any cloud passes by.
At its sides, sand spreads endlessly.
Rooted in scorching soil, stand plants, 
With blooms without any protest! 
PEACE glows on the faces of 
Even those desert flowers! ! 

It is a serene dawn of Himalayan jungle.
Orange rays peep above snowy peaks.
Tigers and antelopes; 
Hawks and doves; 
Snakes and rats-
Await another day of struggle, 
For food, shelter and even for lives! 
PEACE glows on the faces of 
Even those forest creatures! ! 

PEACE prevails everywhere; 
Even in
Ever heaving deep Sea, 
Ever blowing blue Sky, 
Ever shining hot Sun, 
Ever whirling Galaxies of millions of Stars-
But, alas! 
Man alone is cursed with NO PEACE.
All disharmonies, conflicts, chaos 
Trek from human mind to Earth! 

Bestow PEACE in human minds, 
By eliminating greed and conflicts, 
Which are the root cause of, 
His eternal problems.
Let him perceive the UNIVERSAL PEACE, 
That already reigns the entire Universe! 

could love fathom
all little insignificances
that litter my day
like the lilies on a pond
breathing, continually breathing for dear life

each hungry for the kiss of the beast
or the dominion of a feast of birds
that hover in the sky for a destiny
as I pluck a flower in midstream
waiting for you my love to come

promising to love you till the end
in my breathless moments, echoing my pleas
to be with you, at the crossroad of my dreams
when love comes softly to my waiting arms
waiting for the sunset.. 

waiting for the sunset

don't let go of me, my heart, our dreams
your every heartbeat, is a song in my heart
your every breath, a joy, my whole life
your eyes, my guide, my light..

let's kiss and seal our love.. 

forever.  

I love you so very much yet
You simply are not mine
I want to embrace and hug you
But it's impossible at this time.

I hunger for your kisses
To touch your dear soft face
We might as well be worlds away
As I work at my busy pace.

I am so blessed I met you
In a most unlikely point in time
The moon was at its lowest ebb
When I thought you could be mine.

I want to follow you to rivers
That flow into the deepest sea
but my eyes just can’t stop crying
‘cause you and I may not be we.

I try to close the windows
Of my bleeding heart from you
But they just keep on opening
As I know our love’s so true.

I lose myself within your soul
Without you to be lost again
I hunger for your love’s embrace
Now.. evermore.. again.. again-When i am gone, will you still remember me? 
Will you dream of me in your sleep
And hold that soft pillow so tight? 

When I am gone, I will always remember you
That's a promise I hold on through
Because I love you. ♥ ♥ ♥ 

I gave you the best years of my life
I shared with you my pains, my joys and laughter
I know this will make you to remember me

I will be your guiding star in the night
That keeps you going in the early morn
Weep not, my dear heart, but remember me when I am gone


The moment you came into my life
I knew you were the one
to keep me so right
and as we began life’s journey
I knew I would never let this feeling end.

Your eyes are the waves of my soul
ebbing and flowing
on the shores of my dreams
the one who spellbinds me
under this glimmering moonlight.


I will always cherish your soft caresses
as you hold me tightly in your loving arms
and as you whisper to keep me calm I know
storm clouds gather and rain flows
the gentle moon will peep through again.

I love you as the deepest ocean
I love you as crests and shine on bluest water
I love you until our forever’s return
to the heavens where we shall  meet again. 
I will always love
YOU.♥ ♥ ♥your voice leaves me breathless.
your words leave me into a mini heart attack! 

everytime you tell me you love me, 
i beleive you with every aspect of my heart.

everytime you leave, im heart broken till the next time you say 'heyy'

your affection makes my heart thump an extra beats.
the thoughts of you keep me up at night.

everytime you text me
i hold my phone to my heart till i hear my phone ring again.
everytime you say my name i love my name; it then creates a meaing.
whenever you compliment me 
i feel as if im on top of the world! 

everytime you say ' i love you '
im screaming I LOVE YOU MORE! ! ! 
everytime i hear your name 
my heart starts going millions of beats per minute.

please be my prince so i could be your princess 
and live happily ever after. 

Perfectly placed sunbeams makes his hair glow.
The sparkle of his eyes when he looks at me is enough to die for.
He has the perfect angle at the corner of his beautifully shaped lips.
He has a smile that could be mistaken for the sun - the one that could light up this whole town.
The beautiful curve of his biceps.
The smoothness of his hand in mine.
The sound of his voice makes me tingle all over.
There is a light that shines right out of him.
He couldnt be any more perfect! 

What is poetry? 
Is it the way your emotions can run loose
Scrawled across a paper with the fragile ink of a pen? 
Or, maybe, its the way your heart can have it's say
Let its light brightly grow
Or take on the pain in a creative way.
Perhaps its anger and frustration
Happiness and serenity
Filling the mind
You write it down, 
Afraid to loose such a thought.
Or maybe its just a hobby, 
Something learned or a natural gift? 
Whatever poetry may be, 
However it made it's mark
There is nothing in the world of writing
That could compare to poetry; 
An unleash of heartfelt, incredible beauty
That shall always challenge the mind, or touch the heart


You can see me; You can hear me.
But, I am blind and deaf.
I am unable to see Your enchanting beauty, 
As I am absolutely ignorant.
Unable to hear Your honey-sweet voice.
As I am entirely unaware.

Even an earthly mother, 
Can not bear her child being sightless and heedless.
How do You stand my pain of being vain? 

Even an earthly mother, 
Would spend her whole life, 
To serve unsighted child of hers.
But, Oh! compassion-hearted Mother, 
How can You turn to be stone-hearted, 
Not ready to spend even few minutes a day, 
To this helpless blind kid of yours? 

Even an earthly mother, 
Would strive her level best, 
To bring light into the blind-eyes; 
Would seek all means, 
To sing songs of love to the deaf-ears; 
Oh, All powerful Sakthi! 
Is it a hard task to You, 
To cast away my blindness – ignorance? 
To purge away my deafness – unawareness

My heart is a wanderer in love
May it ever remain so
Roaming in the pathless land
In a caravan
Just going where the winds blow. 
 
Sometimes rendered miserable
Blown in all directions
In search of my eternal love fable
Inspite of all defections
Always singing the song of love

Longing for the moon
Searching in the dunes
Will only be still when it becomes crystal
That there is no breath left
For me to fulfill. .. 

As real as air, earth and water
As real as a lovers fight
As real as teh laughter 
Of a child in delight

As real as the expanse of the sea
As real what lurks underneath
As real as the lovers glee
Of an unexpected rendevous

Come and touch my heart
And make me real
Gaze into the depth of my soul
Make it sublime and surreal. . 

Whilst riding on the phantoms of my musings 
I came across thee and I thought 
Are you a reflection of my soul 
Are you the reverbration of my drum 
Are you the truth that will make me whole 
Are you the song that I will hum 
throught the night and the next 
till I am blessed 
with an appearance of thee 
infront of me 
elevating me 
uplifting me 
taking me 
from finite to infinite 
from consciousness to unconsciousness 
from earth to heaven 
from water to vapor 
from darkness to light 
from wrong to right 
from hell to heaven 
from here to oblivion 
where only two souls exist 
yours and mine 
and we revel in it 
we dwell in it 
we bask in it 
we shine 
whre you are mine 
where we are lost 
in just each othere 
nothing else exists
where its bliss 
where we are blessed 
where we can rest 
in the light of each other 
where there is no other 
than you and me 
me and you 
phew! 

I wish you to unfold me
I wish you to hold me
I wish you to undress me
I wish you to bless me
I wish you to ravage me
I wish you to savage me
I wish you to blaze me
I wish you to daze me
I wish you to love me
Love me to death
I wish you to smother me
Smother me with your love
I wish you to inspire me
Inspire me to sing
Sing with you
Together
Where we can view
and feel
A garden of paradise


In the bottle rests my pee
Collected under a darkling moon
And pared down fingernails, overgrown

Some bits of hair and rusty nails
Brass tacks, and a leather pierced
By a nail, which bent at odd angle

Upside down in hidden grave, it lies
So on the evil doer, it rebounds
Until that she, herself, soon die

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

For those afraid a witch may have cast a spell upon them.
If all goes well, the trick will cast the spell back on the witch, 
perhaps killing her — or so goes a h century witchcraft belief. 

Untie the knot for me
of your deep inner secrets
Give me the key
of your inner fantasies
where u have been drowning
Let me swim in the sea
of your dreams, desires and longings
Let me unravel the mysteries
of your mind
thats made you blind
thats been raging in you
tormenting you
spending you
lusting in you
bursting in you.
Come. 
touch me
and feel the peace
walk into your soul
The storm will cease.
Feel the calm
like a balm.
Stop searching
and yearning.
Feel my aura. 
Embrace it
If you hug me close
you can share it. . 

I will be the mountain and hold your voice deep inside
 
You feel
I will be the earth and keep your vibrations in my core
 
You cry
I will be the ocean keeping your sacred drops alive
 
You chant
I will be the holy hymn, we shall soar
 
You fly
I will be the sky, always holding you high
 
You dance
I will be the music that you wore


I am the warp, you are the weft
I am the ground, you are the step
 
I am the lantern, you are the light
I am the eyes, you are the sight
 
I am the touch, you are the sensation
I am the drum, you are the reverbration
 
I am the mirror, you are the reflection
I am the drop, you are the ocean
 
I am the spirit, you are the soul
I am the silly heart that you stole


Lets drink the wine of love. 
Swirl it and soak it in. 
Smell the fragrance
Mmm.  

and the scent of heaven
 
A song in our hearts
Smile in the eyes
Love to keep us fulfilled
For the rest of our lives. 
 
Soar out to our dreams
Swim out from the streams
To join the ocean of love
And discover. 
The world of paradise. 

don’t ever get the idea I am a poet; you can see me 
at the racetrack any day half drunk 
betting quarters, sidewheelers and straight thoroughs, 
but let me tell you, there are some women there 
who go where the money goes, and sometimes when you 
look at these whores these onehundreddollar whores 
you wonder sometimes if nature isn’t playing a joke 
dealing out so much breast and ass and the way 
it’s all hung together, you look and you look and 
you look and you can’t believe it; there are ordinary women 
and then there is something else that wants to make you 
tear up paintings and break albums of Beethoven 
across the back of the john; anyhow, the season 
was dragging and the big boys were getting busted, 
all the non-pros, the producers, the cameraman, 
the pushers of Mary, the fur salesman, the owners 
themselves, and Saint Louie was running this day: 
a sidewheeler that broke when he got in close; 
he ran with his head down and was mean and ugly 
and to  and I put a ten down on him. 
the driver broke him wide 
took him out by the fence where he’d be alone 
even if he had to travel four times as far, 
and that’s the way he went it 
all the way by the outer fence 
traveling two miles in one 
and he won like he was mad as hell 
and he wasn’t even tired, 
and the biggest blonde of all 
all ass and breast, hardly anything else 
went to the payoff window with me. 


that night I couldn’t destroy her 
although the springs shot sparks 
and they pounded on the walls. 
later she sat there in her slip 
drinking Old Grandad 
and she said 
what’s a guy like you doing 
living in a dump like this? 
and I said 
I’m a poet 


and she threw back her beautiful head and laughed. 


you? you . . . a poet? 


I guess you’re right, I said, I guess you’re right. 


but still she looked good to me, she still looked good, 
and all thanks to an ugly horse 
who wrote this poem. 

Beware, my Love
Of the thunder
That we will encounter
When we touch

Beware, my love
Of the Rain
The outpourings of the pain
For the lost time

Beware, my love
Of the lightning
The resurrection that it will bring
Of our dormant desires

Beware, my Love
Of the flood
The mingling of our blood
When our skins dissolve

Beware, my Love
Of the reverbration
The resounding celebration
Of Our eternal Embrace


A shadow with me all day
No body
This is crazy, this is crazy

Notes of a scintillating flute
No flutist
This is crazy, this is crazy

Breathtaking verse on paper
I was sleeping
This is crazy, this is crazy

Vermilion laden sky
Sunrise or sunset? 
This is crazy, this is crazy

Dishevelled clothes, swollen lips
You came in my dream
I am crazy, I am crazy

Or is this the only sanity? 

When do you want our breaths to meet? 
When do you want our souls to touch? 
When do you want to feel the heat? 
And make me drunk on our love? 
 
When do you want our gazes to entwine? 
And then taste each others sweetness? 
When do you want our dreams to be love lined? 
When do you want to surrender to this madness?Τον εσυγκίνησαν τον Απόλλωνα
οι βαρβαρικοί τόνοι* των καταπραϋμένων θλίψεων, 
των ανακουφισμένων στόνων*  τ' ανατολικά ηχοχρώματα, 
οι λυδοφρυγικοί δρόμοι* των εξαϋλωμένων λυγμών.
Στα χείλη του Μαρσύα οι αυλητικές περιπάθειες  
ημέρεψαν  τ' αγρίμια, τα συνοφρυωμένα βουνά.
Τ' ανέμου, της γης και του νερού
τους μελωμένους ήχους σιώπησαν ν' ακούσουν, 
θρηνόλαλη, θαρείς, συμπάθεια στα πάθη του θνητού.
 

Θύμωσε που δεν είχεν η λύρα του χαρίσει στο γένος των ελλήνων
της πίκρας και των δακρύων  μετάπλασης οδό
με μελικές κλίμακες της λύπης απολυτρωτικές
σαν τούτου του  πνεύματος* τις μεταστοιχειωτικές.
Ο ίδιος θα χάριζε στις μελλούμενες γεννιές 
της μετουσίωσης αυτής την άρρητη, αλλότροπη*  παραμυθία.
Θά 'κοβε μόνος του το νήμα της αλλόμουσης πνοής*, 
άδουσα να συντροφεύει τους έλληνες στους αιώνες.
Τη λατρεία τους στις κλίμακές  του θ' ανταμείψει.
Με θάνατο φριχτό θ' αθανάτιζε την παρρησία του Σειληνού.
Εξοργισμένος τάχα γι'  ανατολίτικο θράσος 
επέβαλ' επί τόπου της εκδάρσεως την ποινή.

Ας παραξηγούσαν τις προθέσεις του, 
ας διακινδύνευε την αγαθή του φήμη.
Τό 'ξερε, άδικο θύμα δεν  αφήνουν οι έλληνες αλάτρευτο.
Αξίζανε λοιπόν να υποδυθεί το θύτη.
Σύντομα και μες την ίδια τη  Δελφίδα
θ' ακροάζονταν του θύματός του το σύριγμα, *
στις πίκρες τους πανάξι' αλλόμελη* συμπάθεια,

A  

I watched
your tongue

a little pink
animal

attack the already
melting ice cream

it flicked at it
here
licked at it
there

until
the ice cream

had all but
disappeared.

Your breasts
Rose & fell
(rose & fell)   

as magnificent
as the magnificent

domes of
the church’s cupola 

in the main
square.

Your lips
arranged themselves

into a smile.

"Now what would you
like to do? "

Your mouth 
arranged the words.

Your tongue
licking the syllables  like ice cream.

"I would love to be
your ice cream! "

You stick out your tongue
at me

I'LOVE U, I'LOVE U. 

I'LOVE U.
I'would say from the bottom of my heart the most in.
I'will show with all the desire and the wish.
I'want  you in every time I.

Will you come into my arms? 
Whisper soft your voice makes my heartbeat rapidly.
Maybe this is love sweet as heaven.

Will i'always be sitting beside you? 
And heard the poem of the yearning song.
Long night last dim with longing.

Heart was still faithful to hold the curtains expectations.
Feelings of love brings the light in the dark fog of longing.

I'LOVE U. 

I'LOVE U. 

I'LOVE U.
You still remain in my heart.
You still keep everything for me.
Your embrace was my aim.
Your touch was my desire.
Your kiss was me want to.

All of your dream was the prayer in my sleep.
Give me love.
Give me warmth in my cold night warm rays through your eyes.

Walking together to follow the direction of the horizon.
Where to go river pet? 
Left our love in the footsteps of blue lake.
Hug me tighly under the rain.
Show our love to the rainbow.
Write my name in your love poems. 

I.
That frantick errour I adore,
  And am confirm'd the earth turns round;
Now satisfied o're and o're,
  As rowling waves, so flowes the ground,
And as her neighbour reels the shore:
  Finde such a woman says she loves;
  She's that fixt heav'n, which never moves.

                    II.
In marble, steele, or porphyrie,
  Who carves or stampes his armes or face,
Lookes it by rust or storme must dye:
  This womans love no time can raze,
Hardned like ice in the sun's eye,
  Or your reflection in a glasse,
  Which keepes possession, though you passe.

                    III.
We not behold a watches hand
  To stir, nor plants or flowers to grow;
Must we infer that this doth stand,
  And therefore, that those do not blow?
This she acts calmer, like Heav'ns brand,
  The stedfast lightning, slow loves dart,
  She kils, but ere we feele the smart.

                    IV.
Oh, she is constant as the winde,
  That revels in an ev'nings aire!
Certaine as wayes unto the blinde,
  More reall then her flatt'ries are;
Gentle as chaines that honour binde,
  More faithfull then an Hebrew Jew,
  But as the divel not halfe so true. 

i miss that normal life
i once led
abandoned by one and all
i try and keep this 'BIGNESS'
in me alive
in spite of the bitterness brewing within

i do not make any moves
the stubby fingers of fate does it for me
in spite of an awareness about the falseness
of the situation
the pain the situation gives
is very real


I am cool, calm & collected, hence i don't want to indulge myself in negative activities. 
The fact is i am unique, because i invest my  time in my career. 
I made a decision to be a successful poet, across the globe, 
hence i will abide to my rules & regulations. 
The fact is i resist temptation, because i want to be successful as a poet. 

Towards the middle of the last century a man was moved to the core by the unbearable miseries, agony and social ostracism being suffered by victims of leprosy. It was sufficient to help him realize what his life’s mission ought to be. He wanted to be faithful to his conscience. He relinquished his luxurious life style, his lucrative profession and voluntarily embraced poverty to identify himself with the deprived and the depressed. The rest of his life was a saga of struggle, a struggle against the infirmities of the mind of man, a struggle against the cruelties of the world. The rest of his life was a poem in action; a beautiful poem of self-less service, of creative compassion, of unflinching faith, of determination, love and peace. That was the great social worker BABA AMTE.

I am a humble friend of Baba Amte and his Anandwan. I have fortunately had the opportunity to experience in person the greatness of this really wonderful person, from a fairly close range, although for a short time. The poems included in this collection issued forth from my heart during these periods of my closeness with him.	They speak something about his ideas and ideals, about his work and his wisdom. Hence I desire to present it before the general public, as a humble service of mine. If it serves to inspire anybody, if it serves to spread his message, at least to some extent, I think, humanity would be to that extent, happier and more peaceful. 

If inspired and interested,  you are hereby requested to kindly provide link to these poems to as many friends of yours as possible and help spread far and wide, his messages of supreme love, selfless service, peaceful coexistence, universal brotherhood of man.  

We were suffering seriously
From mental leprosy; 
You healed us 
So compassionately! 

We were wavering Arjunas 
In the battle field; 
As Krishna
You charioted us 
To combat valiantly! 

We were groping hopelessly 
In dark self-pity; 
As Buddha
You enlightened us 
So luminously! 

We were enslaved shamelessly 
To obscene superfluity; 
As Gandhi
You fought for our freedom
So non-violently! 

We were living insecurely 
Destroyed by disunity; 
As Vinobaji
You gifted us lands
Of communal harmony! 

We were denied awfully 
The worship of work; 
As Sane Guruji
You opened for us
Temples of opportunity! 

You did a lot of work; 
You have left for us a lot! 
As Baba Amte
You inspire us unceasingly! 
You awaken us silently! 

O dynamic embodiment
Of creative humanity! 
We feel you ever as so many
As a mechanic, as a healer, as a revolutionary
As a bird, a nest, a tree
As a mine, a mountain, a sea
As poetry, as electricity

To serve others selflessly

Epilogue: 

Struck by age and disease 
Although wounded lay your body
As Bhishmacharya
Even from your bed of arrows
You commanded us so brilliantly! 

Now, O Great Soul
You have liberated yourself finally
From the shackles of mind and body! 
If not for your love of humanity, 
If not for your sacred journey 
From sympathy to empathy, 
If not for your humane creativity, 
When alone would you have been free! 
It’s great that you journeyed with us this far
You have now reached immortality! 
We are now left with the company 
Of your thoughts and deeds only! 
But by them we will still be led
O Supreme Commander of Humanity!

As a drenched, drowned bee  
Hangs numb and heavy from a bending flower,  
 So clings to me  
My baby, her brown hair brushed with wet tears  
 And laid against her cheek;
Her soft white legs hanging heavily over my arm  
Swinging heavily to my movements as I walk.  
 My sleeping baby hangs upon my life,  
Like a burden she hangs on me.  
 She has always seemed so light,
But now she is wet with tears and numb with pain  
Even her floating hair sinks heavily,  
 Reaching downwards;  
As the wings of a drenched, drowned bee  
 Are a heaviness, and a weariness.

the same old man
the same old religion
the same old differences.  

and 
the same old voilence
 
men were out with weapons
men had lost their reasons
men who refused to show patience
men whose religion had sapped compassion
 
until late in the night. 
firing could be heard.  

bombs recovered
scaterred bodies of people
who never cared for any difference
 
as usual in the night
as usual these men slept
a lot with agony of loss would have wept.  

yet
as usual these men of religion dint default
 
a new dawn they did not see
a new face they did not show
as a new flower they did not bloom.  

they were
all out to find a new place for the old war
 
even if nature would clean
even if nature would heal
these men would only want a
yesterday of today


I knew that a baby was hid in that house, 
 Though I saw no cradle and heard no cry; 
But the husband was tip-toeing 'round like a mouse, 
 And the good wife was humming a soft lullaby; 
And there was a look on the face of the mother, 
That I knew could mean only one thing, and no other.

The mother, I said to myself, for I knew
 That the woman before me was certainly that; 
And there lay in a corner a tiny cloth shoe, 
 And I saw on a stand such a wee little hat; 
And the beard of the husband said, plain as could be, 
'Two fat chubby hands have been tugging at me.'

And he took from his pocket a gay picture-book, 
 And a dog that could bark, if you pulled on a string; 
And the wife laid them up with such a pleased look; 
 And I said to myself, 'There is no other thing
But a babe that could bring about all this, and so
That one thing is in hiding somewhere, I know.'

I stayed but a moment, and saw nothing more, 
 And heard not a sound, yet I know I was right; 
What else could the shoe mean that lay on the floor, 
 The book and the toy, and the faces so bright; 
And what made the husband as still as a mouse? 
I am sure, very sure, there's a babe in that house. 

When the bare feet of the baby beat across the grass
The little white feet nod like white flowers in the wind,  
They poise and run like ripples lapping across the water;
And the sight of their white play among the grass  
Is like a little robin’s song, winsome,
Or as two white butterflies settle in the cup of one flower
For a moment, then away with a flutter of wings.  
 
I long for the baby to wander hither to me  
Like a wind-shadow wandering over the water,  
So that she can stand on my knee
With her little bare feet in my hands,  
Cool like syringa buds,  
Firm and silken like pink young peony flowers. 

a baby's chat goes on and on
it does not stop it with it's mom
a dog in the street
a leaf or a flower
a chirruping bird
an ant or a butterfly
the moon in the sky
a baby's chat goes on and on

with everything under the sun

may be the moon winks back
the dog we see surely wags back
leafs flowers birds too may speak back
a language of theirs the baby has
all of us did speak it once
a unique one it is each one's
a baby's chat goes on and on

with everything under the sun

the mother deciphers most of  what it is
the baby learns quicker than the mother does
the mother's sweet language
to chat with the mother it's eagerness


A baby's cradle with no baby in it, 
A baby's grave where autumn leaves drop sere; 
The sweet soul gathered home to Paradise, 
The body waiting here. 

As every eye has its own look and measure, 
parents' eyes are for seeing, a baby's
for being seen-same in kind, differing in degree, 
inscrutable what pleases them. 

silent like a judge
yet still questioning our envy and greed shod
eyes, shorn of the honesty with which
they were born. 

A baby's feet, like sea shells pink,
Might tempt, should heaven see meet
An angel's lips to kiss, we think,
A baby's feet.

Like rose-hued sea flowers toward the heat
They stretch and spread and wink
Their ten soft buds that part and meet.

No flower bells that expand and shrink
Gleam half so heavenly sweet,
As shine on life's untrodden brink
A baby's feet. 

Each time I hear a baby's laughter
I feel a tickle in my heart.

I have to stop and listen better
Catching each note of musical art.

Such innocent laugh in joy released, 
A soothing balm for a wearied soul.

All earthly worries seem to ease, 
A baby's laughter makes me whole.

As death in reverse, nature wills it, 
you take birth
from the whole of me, my baby
whose mid-wife is the universe itself, 
fated to look for a berth
in the deep ocean of short lived breath
where bar good luck, my experience and wisdom, 
my goodness and love go deeper.
as a detached droplet
which is the earth, the time and the omnipresent, 
dropped, has the freewill as ultimate reality
to become pearl in the oyster of life
where all save man, fare far better

I came  as  tomorrow
Swaddled in innocence
To your  warm  womb
	                        

	                        
	                          .  
	                        

	                        
	                          .  


Swaddled in innocence
To your  warm  womb
Mother--
Without  your  choice
Or mine
Destined to up date
With time
Our human tree
But before  love
Grew into flesh  and words
What is  unfinished creation-
A precipitation of blood
Became  my transcendence.

'Why keep a cow when I can buy,'
          Said he, 'the milk I need,'
I wanted to spit in his eye
          Of selfishness and greed;
But did not, for the reason he
          Was stronger than I be.

I told him: ''Tis our human fate,
          For better or for worse,
That man and maid should love and mate,
          And little children nurse.
Of course, if you are less than man
          You can't do what we can.

'So many loving maids would wed,
          And wondrous mothers be.'
'I'll buy the love I want,' he said,
          'No squally brats for me.'
. . . I hope the devil stoketh well
          For him a special hell. 

Back, 
Black, 
Backgrounds, 
Back yard, 
A back door! 
However, the truth is a beautiful thing to behold; 
Ratio, rations! 
So, hold on to the truth always and live in peace. 

Woke up in the dark with a chill
Had a nightmare that could kill
Realize it was just a terrifying dream
I was still breathing.  no need to scream 

Feet on the floor ready to begin the day
Feeling  disorientated.  my cat wants to play
Nearly fell down.  but I caught a grip
The kitty is quite well, luckily I didn't trip

A stack of monthly bills sits and waits
Arranging priorities by oncoming dates
Writing checks with the balance decreasing
A plus remains.  optimism is increasing

Have errands to do before seeing the doctor
Brakes screech.  nearly needed a defibrillator
Why didn't I take the time to double check
Pulled out into traffic.  almost got in a wreck

Made a mental note to be more careful
Hopefully a lesson learned.  being prayerful
Dinnertime is near.  too numb to cook today
Off to the drive-thru to get a fish fillet

As I look back on a day I could call bad
I erase the frightful feelings that I had
Dreaded thoughts that dominated my brain
Have subsided.  I guess I can't complain

And when time after time 
they grow lemon and lime, 
which makes thinking sublime 
and leads poets to rhyme 
like a Klingenthal chime

misdirected to him

yet he takes the blame
without complaining, 
and keeps on.

Stock piling of weapons has triggered Arms race! 
Arms race is going on since the end of World War II.
In the Cold war period it went on between USA & USSR; 
Now the game of balance of power goes between nations! 

To maintain relative security balance of power goes on! 
Now fed up with wars and futility everywhere peace attracts
And talk of peace between warring nations go on as usual.
Without peace of mind no peace of world can be created! 

Nuclear non proliferation treaty is all talk without respect; 
For, no reduction of Nuclear weapons has started yet! 
Here example is better than precept holds good for all; 
Preaching by practice can show some progress it seems! 

World peace depends on promotion of nonviolence in mind
To contain the warring nature first before making it a reality

Fruits and colourful flowers start coming
From August on through September here! 
These best months are best for functions
Neither too hot nor too cold to enjoy well! 

Fruition, maturity and completeness come
Welcoming all to participate for satisfaction! 
'Come September! ' they invite with heart full
Before rain and cold winter accompany soon! 

Nice times are joyful to remember forever
Planning for the coming year also in advance! 
In-between hot and cold and bitter and sweet
Experiences of life we enjoy neutrality in peace! 

In-between two extremes a balanced life is nice
Ever to live than as ant between fire and water

All things pass though seem difficult to surmount; 
Likewise we live life from childhood to old age
Until we breathe our last one day unaware. .! 

Each mile on a mountain full of hair pin bends
Indeed are negotiated so to climb up to the top
To heave a sigh of relief in the fresh air there. ! 

Relief is what everyone wants to feel free here; 
The outspoken words of poets give relief to all
And the time passes on with hope and clarity! 

Once one difficulty is surmounted another one
After sometime unexpected one props up.
Making all climb up with the same effort again! 

If we have a balanced mind both for joy and grief, 
Where is the worry to feel and heave a sigh of relief

Countless Stars as the sands of seashores of the world
In the dark night Sky shine bright in the wonderful Space! 
As the falling sands into the hole of the hour glass of time
Stars disappear in the Black Holes of galaxies in the Universe! 

As the hour glass is turned upside down again sands fall; 
Likewise as recycling in Nature new Stars appear in the Sky
Following appearance and disappearance method forever! 
This Steady State of Nature lies in balancing of old and new.

For every event there is a cause behind in Nature for all; 
Life, death and rebirth or regeneration go on in cycle ever.
Creation and destruction following preservation is a process 
That goes on endlessly to saturation point in many forms!  

Within the life span of every animate and inanimate things
There are many wonder, splendour and grandeur each display

A basic ball is fumes after falling down from a height, 
A crunch is heard by those wary, and some caught it white. 

you make the fire
and I’ll show you something wonderful:
a big ball of snow

A ball involves the pain of flight, 
Falling is always a fact, a bright future.
One calls the suffering for actions, 
But no bouncing of weapons happened.
If a ball has bounced due to irritation, 
Let the fall be witnessed by some who play.
The sport is proud of a day that delights, 
Anybody who is an enemy is too much.
Balloons catch flight, but the bubbles float, 
And the balls of big size reduce their size. 

Time—in whose arms we drown
Under the moon semi mauve
And the waves turn upside down  
As we're like a cloud and its rain; 
One would crowd and one would drain. 
Neither the bile of the moon
Nor the waves' cause of swoon
Can mine the cloud
And imbibe the rain
No! —cause it would 
Cause too much pain.
And I would rather pour each morn
Than to disappear when a ship horn.
I would probably be a child's flute
Rather than being a master mute. 

With A Serious Conclusion

Crowd about me, little children--
Come and cluster 'round my knee
While I tell a little story
That happened once with me.

My father he had gone away
A-sailing on the foam,
Leaving me--the merest infant--
And my mother dear at home;

For my father was a sailor,
And he sailed the ocean o'er
For full five years ere yet again
He reached his native shore.

And I had grown up rugged
And healthy day by day,
Though I was but a puny babe
When father went away.

Poor mother she would kiss me
And look at me and sigh
So strangely, oft I wondered
And would ask the reason why.

And she would answer sadly,
Between her sobs and tears,--
'You look so like your father,
Far away so many years!'

And then she would caress me
And brush my hair away,
And tell me not to question,
But to run about my play.

Thus I went playing thoughtfully--
For that my mother said,--
'YOU LOOK SO LIKE YOUR FATHER!'
Kept ringing in my head.

So, ranging once the golden sands
That looked out on the sea,
I called aloud, 'My father dear,
Come back to ma and me!'

Then I saw a glancing shadow
On the sand, and heard the shriek
Of a sea-gull flying seaward,
And I heard a gruff voice speak:--

'Ay, ay, my little shipmate,
I thought I heard you hail;
Were you trumpeting that sea-gull,
Or do you see a sail?'

And as rough and gruff a sailor
As ever sailed the sea
Was standing near grotesquely
And leering dreadfully.

I replied, though I was frightened,
'It was my father dear
I was calling for across the sea--
I think he didn't hear.'

And then the sailor leered again
In such a frightful way,
And made so many faces
I was little loath to stay:

But he started fiercely toward me--
Then made a sudden halt
And roared, '_I_ think he heard you!'
And turned a somersault.

Then a wild fear overcame me,
And I flew off like the wind,
Shrieking 'MOTHER!'--and the sailor
Just a little way behind!

And then my mother heard me,
And I saw her shade her eyes,
Looking toward me from the doorway,
Transfixed with pale surprise

For a moment--then her features
Glowed with all their wonted charms
As the sailor overtook me,
And I fainted in her arms.

When I awoke to reason
I shuddered with affright
Till I felt my mother's presence
With a thrill of wild delight--

Till, amid a shower of kisses
Falling glad as summer rain,
A muffled thunder rumbled,--
'Is he coming 'round again?'

Then I shrieked and clung unto her,
While her features flushed and burned
As she told me it was father
From a foreign land returned.

. . . . . . .

I said--when I was calm again,
And thoughtfully once more
Had dwelt upon my mother's words
Of just the day before,--

'I DON'T look like my father,
As you told me yesterday--
I know I don't--or father
Would have run the other way.

'ONCE I loved a maiden fair,
Over the hills and jar away,
Lands she had and lovers to spare,
Over the hills and far away.
And I was stooped and troubled sore,
And my face was pale, and the coat I wore
Was thin as my supper the night before
Over the hills and far away.

Once I passed in the Autumn late,
Over the hills and jar away,
Her bawn and barn and painted gate,
Over the hills and jar away.
She was leaning there in the twilight space,
Sweet sorrow was on her fair young face,
And her wistful eyes were away from the place,
Over the hills and jar away.

Maybe she thought as she watched me come,
Over the hills and jar away,
With my awkward stride and my face so glum,
Over the hills and jar away.
Spite of his stoop, he still is young,
They say he goes the Shee among,
Ballads he makes; I've heard them sung
Over the hills and jar away.

She gave me good-night in gentle wise,
Over the hills and jar away,
Shyly lifting to mine, dark eyes,
Over the hills and jar away.
What could I do but stop and speak,
And she no longer proud, but meek?
She plucked me a rose like her wild-rose cheek-
Over the hills and jar away.

To-morrow Mavourneen a sleeveen weds,
Over the hills and jar away,
With corn in haggard and cattle in sheds,
Over the hills and jar away.
And I who have lost her, the dear, the rare-
Well, I got me this ballad to sing at the fair,
Twill bring enough money to drown my care,
Over the hills and jar away. 

The American's a hustler, for he says so,
  And surely the American must know.
He will prove to you with figures why it pays so
  Beginning with his boyhood long ago.
When the slow-maturing anecdote is ripest,
  He'll dictate it like a Board of Trade Report,
And because he has no time to call a typist,
  He calls her a Stenographer for short.


He is never known to loiter or malinger,
  He rushes, for he knows he has 'a date' ;
He is always on the spot and full of ginger,
  Which is why he is invariably late.
When he guesses that it's getting even later,
  His vocabulary's vehement and swift,
And he yells for what he calls the Elevator,
  A slang abbreviation for a lift.


Then nothing can be nattier or nicer
  For those who like a light and rapid style.
Than to trifle with a work of Mr Dreiser
  As it comes along in waggons by the mile.
He has taught us what a swift selective art meant
  By description of his dinners and all that,
And his dwelling, which he says is an Apartment,
  Because he cannot stop to say a flat.


We may whisper of his wild precipitation,
  That it's speed in rather longer than a span,
But there really is a definite occasion
  When he does not use the longest word he can.
When he substitutes, I freely make admission,
  One shorter and much easier to spell ;
If you ask him what he thinks of Prohibition,
  He may tell you quite succinctly it is Hell. 

The burden of hard hitting. Slug away 
Like Honus Wagner or like Tyrus Cobb. 
Else fandom shouteth: "Who said you could play? 
Back to the jasper league, you minor slob!" 
Swat, hit, connect, line out, goet on the job. 
Else you shall feel the brunt of fandom's ire 
Biff, bang it, clout it, hit it on the knob - 
This is the end of every fan's desire. 

The burden of good pitching. Curved or straight. 
Or in or out, or haply up or down, 
To puzzle him that standeth by the plate, 
To lessen, so to speak, his bat-renown: 
So pitch that every man can but admire 
And offer you the freedom of the town - 
This is the end of every fan's desire. 

The burden of loud cheering. O the sounds! 
The tumult and the shouting from the throats 
Of forty thousand at the Polo Grounds 
Sitting, ay, standing sans their hats and coats. 
A mighty cheer that possibly denotes 
That Cub or Pirate fat is in the fire; 
Or, as H. James would say, We've got their goats - 
This is the end of every fan's desire. 

The burden of a pennant. O the hope, 
The tenuous hope, the hope that's half a fear, 
The lengthy season and the boundless dope, 
And the bromidic, "Wait until next year
 

O dread disgrace of trailing in the rear, 
O Piece of Bunting, flying high and higher 
That next October it shall flutter here: 
This is the end of every fan's desire. 

ENVOY 

Ah, Fans, let not the Quarry but the Chase 
Be that to which most fondly we aspire! 
For us not Stake, but Game; not Goal, but Race - 

THIS is the end of every fan's desire. 

There are sleeping dreams and waking dreams;
What seems is not always as it seems.

I looked out of my window in the sweet new morning,
And there I saw three barges of manifold adorning
Went sailing toward the East:
The first had sails like fire,
The next like glittering wire,
But sackcloth were the sails of the least;
And all the crews made music, and two had spread a feast.

The first choir breathed in flutes,
And fingered soft guitars;
The second won from lutes
Harmonious chords and jars,
With drums for stormy bars:
But the third was all of harpers and scarlet trumpeters;
Notes of triumph, then
An alarm again,
As for onset, as for victory, rallies, stirs,
Peace at last and glory to the vanquishers.

The first barge showed for figurehead a Love with wings;
The second showed for figurehead a Worm with stings;
The third, a Lily tangled to a Rose which clings.
The first bore for freight gold and spice and down;
The second bore a sword, a sceptre, and a crown;
The third, a heap of earth gone to dust and brown.
Winged Love meseemed like Folly in the face;
Stinged Worm meseemed loathly in his place;
Lily and Rose were flowers of grace.

Merry went the revel of the fire-sailed crew,
Singing, feasting, dancing to and fro:
Pleasures ever changing, ever graceful, ever new;
Sighs, but scarce of woe;
All the sighing
Wooed such sweet replying;
All the sighing, sweet and low,
Used to come and go
For more pleasure, merely so.
Yet at intervals some one grew tired
Of everything desired,
And sank, I knew not whither, in sorry plight,
Out of sight.

The second crew seemed ever
Wider-visioned, graver,
More distinct of purpose, more sustained of will;
With heads erect and proud,
And voices sometimes loud;
With endless tacking, counter-tacking,
All things grasping, all things lacking,
It would seem;
Ever shifting helm, or sail, or shroud,
Drifting on as in a dream.
Hoarding to their utmost bent,
Feasting to their fill,
Yet gnawed by discontent,
Envy, hatred, malice, on their road they went.
Their freight was not a treasure,
Their music not a pleasure;
The sword flashed, cleaving through their bands,
Sceptre and crown changed hands.

The third crew as they went
Seemed mostly different;
They toiled in rowing, for to them the wind was contrary,
As all the world might see.
They labored at the oar,
While on their heads they bore
The fiery stress of sunshine more and more.
They labored at the oar hand-sore,
Till rain went splashing,
And spray went dashing,
Down on them, and up on them, more and more.
Their sails were patched and rent,
Their masts were bent,
In peril of their lives they worked and went.
For them no feast was spread,
No soft luxurious bed
Scented and white,
No crown or sceptre hung in sight;
In weariness and painfulness,
In thirst and sore distress,
They rowed and steered from left to right
With all their might.
Their trumpeters and harpers round about
Incessantly played out,
And sometimes they made answer with a shout;
But oftener they groaned or wept,
And seldom paused to eat, and seldom slept.
I wept for pity watching them, but more
I wept heart-sore
Once and again to see
Some weary man plunge overboard, and swim
To Love or Worm ship floating buoyantly:
And there all welcomed him.

The ships steered each apart and seemed to scorn each other,
Yet all the crews were interchangeable;
Now one man, now another,
—Like bloodless spectres some, some flushed by health,—
Changed openly, or changed by stealth,
Scaling a slippery side, and scaled it well.
The most left Love ship, hauling wealth
Up Worm ship's side;
While some few hollow-eyed
Left either for the sack-sailed boat;
But this, though not remote,
Was worst to mount, and whoso left it once
Scarce ever came again,
But seemed to loathe his erst companions,
And wish and work them bane.

Then I knew (I know not how) there lurked quicksands full of dread,
Rocks and reefs and whirlpools in the water-bed,
Whence a waterspout
Instantaneously leaped out,
Roaring as it reared its head.

Soon I spied a something dim,
Many-handed, grim,
That went flitting to and fro the first and second ship;
It puffed their sails full out
With puffs of smoky breath
From a smouldering lip,
And cleared the waterspout
Which reeled roaring round about
Threatening death.
With a horny hand it steered,
And a horn appeared
On its sneering head upreared
Haughty and high
Against the blackening lowering sky.
With a hoof it swayed the waves;
They opened here and there,
Till I spied deep ocean graves
Full of skeletons
That were men and women once
Foul or fair;
Full of things that creep
And fester in the deep
And never breathe the clean life-nurturing air.

The third bark held aloof
From the Monster with the hoof,
Despite his urgent beck,
And fraught with guile
Abominable his smile;
Till I saw him take a flying leap on to that deck.
Then full of awe,
With these same eyes I saw
His head incredible retract its horn
Rounding like babe's new born,
While silvery phosphorescence played
About his dis-horned head.
The sneer smoothed from his lip,
He beamed blandly on the ship;
All winds sank to a moan,
All waves to a monotone
(For all these seemed his realm),
While he laid a strong caressing hand upon the helm.

Then a cry well nigh of despair
Shrieked to heaven, a clamor of desperate prayer.
The harpers harped no more,
While the trumpeters sounded sore
An alarm to wake the dead from their bed:
To the rescue, to the rescue, now or never,
To the rescue, O ye living, O ye dead,
Or no more help or hope for ever!—
The planks strained as though they must part asunder,
The masts bent as though they must dip under,
And the winds and the waves at length
Girt up their strength,
And the depths were laid bare,
And heaven flashed fire and volleyed thunder
Through the rain-choked air,
And sea and sky seemed to kiss
In the horror and the hiss
Of the whole world shuddering everywhere.

Lo! a Flyer swooping down
With wings to span the globe,
And splendor for his robe
And splendor for his crown.
He lighted on the helm with a foot of fire,
And spun the Monster overboard:
And that monstrous thing abhorred,
Gnashing with balked desire,
Wriggled like a worm infirm
Up the Worm
Of the loathly figurehead.
There he crouched and gnashed;
And his head re-horned, and gashed
From the other's grapple, dripped bloody red.

I saw that thing accurst
Wreak his worst
On the first and second crew:
Some with baited hook
He angled for and took,
Some dragged overboard in a net he threw,
Some he did to death
With hoof or horn or blasting breath.

I heard a voice of wailing
Where the ships went sailing,
A sorrowful voice prevailing
Above the sound of the sea,
Above the singers' voices,
And musical merry noises;
All songs had turned to sighing,
The light was failing,
The day was dying—
Ah me,
That such a sorrow should be!

There was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
When Love ship went down by the bottomless quicksand
To its grave in the bitter wave.
There was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
When Worm ship went to pieces on the rock-bound strand,
And the bitter wave was its grave.
But land and sea waxed hoary
In whiteness of a glory
Never told in story
Nor seen by mortal eye,
When the third ship crossed the bar
Where whirls and breakers are,
And steered into the splendors of the sky;
That third bark and that least
Which had never seemed to feast,
Yet kept high festival above sun and moon and star. 

A Ballad of Burdens 

          The burden of fair women. Vain delight,
             And love self-slain in some sweet shameful way,
          And sorrowful old age that comes by night
             As a thief comes that has no heart by day,
             And change that finds fair cheeks and leaves them grey,
          And weariness that keeps awake for hire,
             And grief that says what pleasure used to say;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of bought kisses. This is sore,
             A burden without fruit in childbearing;
          Between the nightfall and the dawn threescore,
             Threescore between the dawn and evening.
             The shuddering in thy lips, the shuddering
          In thy sad eyelids tremulous like fire,
             Makes love seem shameful and a wretched thing.
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of sweet speeches. Nay, kneel down,
             Cover thy head, and weep; for verily
          These market-men that buy thy white and brown
             In the last days shall take no thought for thee.
             In the last days like earth thy face shall be,
          Yea, like sea-marsh made thick with brine and mire,
             Sad with sick leavings of the sterile sea.
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of long living. Thou shalt fear
             Waking, and sleeping mourn upon thy bed;

"
             With weary days thou shalt be clothed and fed,
          And wear remorse of heart for thine attire,
             Pain for thy girdle and sorrow upon thine head;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of bright colours. Thou shalt see
             Gold tarnished, and the grey above the green;
          And as the thing thou seest thy face shall be,
             And no more as the thing beforetime seen.
             And thou shalt say of mercy "It hath been,"
          And living, watch the old lips and loves expire,
             And talking, tears shall take thy breath between;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of sad sayings. In that day
             Thou shalt tell all thy days and hours, and tell
          Thy times and ways and words of love, and say
             How one was dear and one desirable,
             And sweet was life to hear and sweet to smell,
          But now with lights reverse the old hours retire
             And the last hour is shod with fire from hell;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of four seasons. Rain in spring,
             White rain and wind among the tender trees;
          A summer of green sorrows gathering,
             Rank autumn in a mist of miseries,
             With sad face set towards the year, that sees
          The charred ash drop out of the dropping pyre,
             And winter wan with many maladies;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of dead faces. Out of sight
             And out of love, beyond the reach of hands,
          Changed in the changing of the dark and light,
             They walk and weep about the barren lands
             Where no seed is nor any garner stands,
          Where in short breaths the doubtful days respire,
             And time's turned glass lets through the sighing sands;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of much gladness. Life and lust
             Forsake thee, and the face of thy delight;
          And underfoot the heavy hour strews dust,
             And overhead strange weathers burn and bite;
             And where the red was, lo the bloodless white,
          And where the truth was, the likeness of a liar,
             And where the day was, the likeness of the night;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          L'ENVOY 

          Princes, and ye whom pleasure quickeneth,
             Heed well this rhyme before your pleasure tire;
          For life is sweet, but after life is death.
             This is the end of every man's desire. 

Only lived for seven months there but I do remember still
My happy days in Fitzroy towards the left of Clifton Hill
And the good fun at the weekends for my memory serves me well
And the lovely girls I danced with at the Normandy Hotel.

There was Kate from Connemara, there was Joan from County Clare, 
There was Tess from Ballybunion with the brown and curling hair, 
There was  from Mildura and Bella from Bedingo
And the beauty from Lakes Entrance the delightful Mary Jo.

Many young men out from Ireland from Kerry to County Down
They had come to make their fortune in Victoria's Melbourne Town
Times were bad in poor old Ireland and not much work over here
Still for only twenty dollars one can get blind drunk on beer.

The Great Mc


Carthy in his forties quite familiar to the place
In the Clifton Hill Hotel and Normandy his is a well known face
And the Kerry man old Twiggy dark haired streaked with strands of gray
Boasting of Kerry footballers heroes of a by gone day.

Danny Twohig from north west Cork from the hills of Ballinagree
He's inspired the Sinn Fein footballers to many a victory
And his once quick feet grown slower with the passages of time
Still on squash court he outplay men half of his age and in their prime.

And the man from west of Ireland the ebullient Bomber brown
He is quite a well known figure in this part of Melbourne Town
He has drank in Clifton Hill pubs for years and years and years
He has drunk gallons of liquor and kegs and kegs of beer.

And the Irish and the Aussies dance around the lounge room floor
As the band played on till midnight to another loud encore
Singing songs of emigration Botany Bay and Danny Boy, 
Galway Bay, Mountains of Mourne and the Fields of Athenry

Only lived for seven months there but I do remember still
My happy days in Fitzroy towards the left of Clifton Hill
And the good fun at the weekends for my memory serves me well
And the lovely girls I danced with at the Normandy Hotel. 

Kneel down, fair Love, and fill thyself with tears,
Girdle thyself with sighing for a girth
Upon the sides of mirth,
Cover thy lips and eyelids, let thine ears
Be filled with rumour of people sorrowing;
Make thee soft raiment out of woven sighs
Upon the flesh to cleave,
Set pains therein and many a grievous thing,
And many sorrows after each his wise
For armlet and for gorget and for sleeve. 

O Love's lute heard about the lands of death,
Left hanged upon the trees that were therein;
O Love and Time and Sin,
Three singing mouths that mourn now underbreath,
Three lovers, each one evil spoken of;
O smitten lips wherethrough this voice of mine
Came softer with her praise;
Abide a little for our lady's love.
The kisses of her mouth were more than wine,
And more than peace the passage of her days. 

O Love, thou knowest if she were good to see.
O Time, thou shalt not find in any land
Till, cast out of thine hand,
The sunlight and the moonlight fail from thee,
Another woman fashioned like as this.
O Sin, thou knowest that all thy shame in her
Was made a goodly thing;
Yea, she caught Shame and shamed him with her kiss,
With her fair kiss, and lips much lovelier
Than lips of amorous roses in late spring. 

By night there stood over against my bed
Both sides drawn fully back
From brows wherein the sad blood failed of red,
And temples drained of purple and full of death.
Her curled hair had the wave of sea-water
And the sea's gold in it.
Her eyes were as a dove's that sickeneth.
Strewn dust of gold she had shed over her,
And pearl and purple and amber on her feet. 

Upon her raiment of dyed sendaline
Were painted all the secret ways of love
And covered things thereof,
That hold delight as grape-flowers hold their wine;
Red mouths of maidens and red feet of doves,
And brides that kept within the bride-chamber
Their garment of soft shame,
And weeping faces of the wearied loves
That swoon in sleep and awake wearier,
With heat of lips and hair shed out like flame. 

The tears that through her eyelids fell on me
Made mine own bitter where they ran between
As blood had fallen therein,
She saying; Arise, lift up thine eyes and see
If any glad thing be or any good
Now the best thing is taken forth of us;
Even she to whom all praise
Was as one flower in a great multitude,
One glorious flower of many and glorious,
One day found gracious among many days: 

Even she whose handmaiden was Love--to whom
At kissing times across her stateliest bed
Kings bowed themselves and shed
Pale wine, and honey with the honeycomb,
And spikenard bruised for a burnt-offering;
Even she between whose lips the kiss became
As fire and frankincense;
Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king,
Whose eyes were as the morning purged with flame,
Whose eyelids as sweet savour issuing thence. 

Then I beheld, and lo on the other side
My lady's likeness crowned and robed and dead.
Sweet still, but now not red,
Was the shut mouth whereby men lived and died.
And sweet, but emptied of the blood's blue shade,
The great curled eyelids that withheld her eyes.
And sweet, but like spoilt gold,
The weight of colour in her tresses weighed.
And sweet, but as a vesture with new dyes,
The body that was clothed with love of old. 

Ah! that my tears filled all her woven hair
And all the hollow bosom of her gown--
Ah! that my tears ran down
Even to the place where many kisses were,
Even where her parted breast-flowers have place,
Even where they are cloven apart--who knows not this?
Ah! the flowers cleave apart
And their sweet fills the tender interspace;
Ah! the leaves grown thereof were things to kiss
Ere their fine gold was tarnished at the heart. 

Each part about her was a righteous thing;
Her mouth an almsgiving,
The glory of her garments charity,
The beauty of her bosom a good deed,
Love lay upon her eyes,
And on that hair whereof the world takes heed;
And all her body was more virtuous
Than souls of women fashioned otherwise. 

Now, ballad, gather poppies in thine hands
And sheaves of brier and many rusted sheaves
Rain-rotten in rank lands,
Waste marigold and late unhappy leaves
And grass that fades ere any of it be mown;
And when thy bosom is filled full thereof
Seek out Death's face ere the light altereth,
And say "My master that was thrall to Love
Is become thrall to Death

"
Bow down before him, ballad, sigh and groan.
But make no sojourn in thy outgoing;
For haply it may be
That when thy feet return at evening
Death shall come in with thee. 

I hid my heart in a nest of roses,
Out of the sun's way, hidden apart;
In a softer bed than the soft white snow's is,
Under the roses I hid my heart.
Why would it sleep not? why should it start,
When never a leaf of the rose-tree stirred?
What made sleep flutter his wings and part?
Only the song of a secret bird.

Lie still, I said, for the wind's wing closes,
And mild leaves muffle the keen sun's dart;
Lie still, for the wind on the warm seas dozes,
And the wind is unquieter yet than thou art.
Does a thought in thee still as a thorn's wound smart?
Does the fang still fret thee of hope deferred?
What bids the lips of thy sleep dispart?
Only the song of a secret bird.

The green land's name that a charm encloses, 
It never was writ in the traveller's chart,
And sweet on its trees as the fruit that grows is,
It never was sold in the merchant's mart.
The swallows of dreams through its dim fields dart,
And sleep's are the tunes in its tree-tops heard;
No hound's note wakens the wildwood hart,
Only the song of a secret bird.



ENVOI

In the world of dreams I have chosen my part,
To sleep for a season and hear no word
Of true love's truth or of light love's art,
Only the song of a secret bird. 

The railway rattled and roared and swung 
With jolting and bumping trucks. 
The sun, like a billiard red ball, hung 
In the Western sky: and the tireless tongue 
Of the wild-eyed man in the corner told 
This terrible tale of the days of old, 
And the party that ought to have kept the ducks. 
"Well, it ain't all joy bein' on the land 
With an overdraft that'd knock you flat; 
And the rabbits have pretty well took command; 
But the hardest thing for a man to stand 
Is the feller who says 'Well I told you so! 
You should ha' done this way, don't you know!' -- 
I could lay a bait for a man like that. 

"The grasshoppers struck us in ninety-one 
And what they leave -- well, it ain't de luxe. 
But a growlin' fault-findin' son of a gun 
Who'd lent some money to stock our run -- 
I said they'd eaten what grass we had -- 
Says he, 'Your management's very bad; 
You had a right to have kept some ducks!' 

"To have kept some ducks! And the place was white! 
Wherever you went you had to tread 
On grasshoppers guzzlin' day and night; 
And then with a swoosh they rose in flight, 
If you didn't look out for yourself they'd fly 
Like bullets into your open eye 
And knock it out of the back of your head. 

"There isn't a turkey or goose or swan, 
Or a duck that quacks, or a hen that clucks, 
Can make a difference on a run 
When a grasshopper plague has once begun; 
'If you'd finance us,' I says, 'I'd buy 
Ten thousand emus and have a try; 
The job,' I says, 'is too big for ducks! 

"'You must fetch a duck when you come to stay; 
A great big duck -- a Muscovy toff -- 
Ready and fit,' I says, 'for the fray; 
And if the grasshoppers come our way 
You turn your duck into the lucerne patch, 
And I'd be ready to make a match 
That the grasshoppers eat his feathers off!" 

"He came to visit us by and by, 
And it just so happened one day in spring 
A kind of cloud came over the sky -- 
A wall of grasshoppers nine miles high, 
And nine miles thick, and nine hundred wide, 
Flyin' in regiments, side by side, 
And eatin' up every living thing. 

"All day long, like a shower of rain, 
You'd hear 'em smackin' against the wall, 
Tap, tap, tap, on the window pane, 
And they'd rise and jump at the house again 
Till their crippled carcasses piled outside. 
But what did it matter if thousands died -- 
A million wouldn't be missed at all. 

"We were drinkin' grasshoppers -- so to speak -- 
Till we skimmed their carcasses off the spring; 
And they fell so thick in the station creek 
They choked the waterholes all the week. 
There was scarcely room for a trout to rise, 
And they'd only take artificial flies -- 
They got so sick of the real thing. 

"An Arctic snowstorm was beat to rags 
When the hoppers rose for their morning flight 
With the flapping noise like a million flags: 
And the kitchen chimney was stuffed with bags 
For they'd fall right into the fire, and fry 
Till the cook sat down and began to cry -- 
And never a duck or fowl in sight. 

"We strolled across to the railroad track -- 
Under a cover beneath some trucks, 
I sees a feather and hears a quack; 
I stoops and I pulls the tarpaulin back -- 
Every duck in the place was there, 
No good to them was the open air. 
'Mister,' I says, 'There's your blanky ducks!'"Now what in the name of the sun and the stars
Is the meaning of this most unholy of wars?

Do men find life so full of humour and joy
That for want of excitement they smash up the toy?

Fifteen millions of soldiers with popguns and horses
All bent upon killing, because their 'of courses'

Are not quite the same. All these men by the ears,
And nine nations of women choking with tears.

It is folly to think that the will of a king
Can force men to make ducks and drakes of a thing

They value, and life is, at least one supposes,
Of some little interest, even if roses

Have not grown up between one foot and the other.
What a marvel bureaucracy is, which can smother

Such quite elementary feelings, and tag
A man with a number, and set him to wag

His legs and his arms at the word of command
Or the blow of a whistle! He's certainly damned,

Fit only for mince-meat, if a little gold lace
And an upturned moustache can set him to face

Bullets, and bayonets, and death, and diseases,
Because some one he calls his Emperor, pleases.

If each man were to lay down his weapon, and say,
With a click of his heels, 'I wish you Good-day,'

Now what, may I ask, could the Emperor do?
A king and his minions are really so few.

Angry? Oh, of course, a most furious Emperor!
But the men are so many they need not mind his temper, or

The dire results which could not be inflicted.
With no one to execute sentence, convicted

Is just the weak wind from an old, broken bellows.
What lackeys men are, who might be such fine fellows!

To be killing each other, unmercifully,
At an order, as though one said, 'Bring up the tea.'

Or is it that tasting the blood on their jaws
They lap at it, drunk with its ferment, and laws

So patiently builded, are nothing to drinking
More blood, any blood. They don't notice its stinking.

I don't suppose tigers do, fighting cocks, sparrows,
And, as to men - what are men, when their marrows

Are running with blood they have gulped; it is plain
Such excellent sport does not recollect pain.

Toll the bells in the steeples left standing. Half-mast
The flags which meant order, for order is past.

Take the dust of the streets and sprinkle your head,
The civilization we've worked for is dead.

Squeeze into this archway, the head of the line
Has just swung round the corner to `Die Wacht am Rhein'. 

Bird of the bitter bright grey golden morn 
Scarce risen upon the dusk of dolorous years, 
First of us all and sweetest singer born 
Whose far shrill note the world of new men hears 
Cleave the cold shuddering shade as twilight clears; 
When song new-born put off the old world's attire 
And felt its tune on her changed lips expire, 
Writ foremost on the roll of them that came 
Fresh girt for service of the latter lyre, 
Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name! 


Alas the joy, the sorrow, and the scorn, 
That clothed thy life with hopes and sins and fears, 
And gave thee stones for bread and tares for corn 
And plume-plucked gaol-birds for thy starveling peers 
Till death clipt close their flight with shameful shears; 
Till shifts came short and loves were hard to hire, 
When lilt of song nor twitch of twangling wire 
Could buy thee bread or kisses; when light fame 
Spurned like a ball and haled through brake and briar, 
Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name! 


Poor splendid wings so frayed and soiled and torn! 
Poor kind wild eyes so dashed with light quick tears! 
Poor perfect voice, most blithe when most forlorn, 
That rings athwart the sea whence no man steers 
Like joy-bells crossed with death-bells in our ears! 
What far delight has cooled the fierce desire 
That like some ravenous bird was strong to tire 
On that frail flesh and soul consumed with flame, 
But left more sweet than roses to respire, 
Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name? 


Prince of sweet songs made out of tears and fire, 
Shame soiled thy song, and song assoiled thy shame. 
But from thy feet now death has washed the mire, 
Love reads out first at head of all our quire, 
Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name. 

The firste stock-father of gentleness,
What man desireth gentle for to be,
Must follow his trace, and all his wittes dress,
Virtue to love, and vices for to flee;
For unto virtue longeth dignity,
And not the reverse, safely dare I deem,
All wear he mitre, crown, or diademe.

This firste stock was full of righteousness,
True of his word, sober, pious, and free,
Clean of his ghost, and loved business,
Against the vice of sloth, in honesty;
And, but his heir love virtue as did he,
He is not gentle, though he riche seem,
All wear he mitre, crown, or diademe.

Vice may well be heir to old richess,
But there may no man, as men may well see,
Bequeath his heir his virtuous nobless;
That is appropried to no degree,
But to the first Father in majesty,
Which makes his heire him that doth him queme,
All wear he mitre, crown, or diademe.

'A letter from my love to-day!
Oh, unexpected, dear appeal!'
She struck a happy tear away,
And broke the crimson seal.

'My love, there is no help on earth,
No help in heaven; the dead-man's bell
Must toll our wedding; our first hearth
Must be the well-paved floor of hell.'

The colour died from out her face,
Her eyes like ghostly candles shone;
She cast dread looks about the place,
Then clenched her teeth and read right on.

'I may not pass the prison door;
Here must I rot from day to day,
Unless I wed whom I abhor,
My cousin, Blanche of Valencay.

'At midnight with my dagger keen,
I'll take my life; it must be so.
For weal and woe.'

She laughed although her face was wan,
She girded on her golden belt,
She took her jewelled ivory fan,
And at her glowing missal knelt.

Then rose, 'And am I mad?' she said:
She broke her fan, her belt untied;
With leather girt herself instead,
And stuck a dagger at her side.

She waited, shuddering in her room,
Till sleep had fallen on all the house.
She never flinched; she faced her doom:
They two must sin to keep their vows.

Then out into the night she went,
And, stooping, crept by hedge and tree;
Her rose-bush flung a snare of scent,
And caught a happy memory.

She fell, and lay a minute's space;
She tore the sward in her distress;
The dewy grass refreshed her face;
She rose and ran with lifted dress.

She started like a morn-caught ghost
Once when the moon came out and stood
To watch; the naked road she crossed,
And dived into the murmuring wood.

The branches snatched her streaming cloak;
A live thing shrieked; she made no stay!
She hurried to the trysting-oak—
Right well she knew the way.

Without a pause she bared her breast,
And drove her dagger home and fell,
And lay like one that takes her rest,
And died and wakened up in hell.

She bathed her spirit in the flame,
And near the centre took her post;
From all sides to her ears there came
The dreary anguish of the lost.

The devil started at her side,
Comely, and tall, and black as jet.
'I am young Malespina's bride;
Has he come hither yet?'

'My poppet, welcome to your bed.'
'Is Malespina here?'
'Not he! To-morrow he must wed
His cousin Blanche, my dear!'

'You lie, he died with me to-night.'
'Not he! it was a plot'
'You lie.'
'My dear, I never lie outright.'
'We died at midnight, he and I.'

The devil went. Without a groan
She, gathered up in one fierce prayer,
Took root in hell's midst all alone,
And waited for him there.

She dared to make herself at home
Amidst the wail, the uneasy stir.
The blood-stained flame that filled the dome,
Scentless and silent, shrouded her.

How long she stayed I cannot tell;
But when she felt his perfidy,
She marched across the floor of hell;
And all the damned stood up to see.

The devil stopped her at the brink:
She shook him off; she cried, 'Away!'
'My dear, you have gone mad, I think.'
'I was betrayed: I will not stay.'

Across the weltering deep she ran;
A stranger thing was never seen:
The damned stood silent to a man;
They saw the great gulf set between.

To her it seemed a meadow fair;
And flowers sprang up about her feet
She entered heaven; she climbed the stair
And knelt down at the mercy-seat.

Seraphs and saints with one great voice
Welcomed that soul that knew not fear.
Amazed to find it could rejoice,
Hell raised a hoarse, half-human cheer. 

Are stolen fruits the most exciting? 
Down on you with tongue delighting 
As a butterfly lands on a flower 
Then rough and wild hour on hour 
A voracious animal, a wild beast 
Spreads you out for his feast 
Uninhibited bursts of passion 
So gentle a tongue, then a lashing 
Mouthfuls then fingers in so deep 
Sucking and licking – forget sleep! 
Stop don’t stop O stop please please! 
Rivers run - I’m on my knees! 
You grin demented wild and free 
Laughing madly in pleasure’s glee 
Untamed the passion erupts to bliss 
Then a wet dirty hungry kiss! 
Vesuvius erupts and earthquakes roar 
Howling moaning, come back for more! 
In a frenzied torrent of lust and passion 
Waves of a storm, downward crashing! 
Slow deep and in - the thrusting goes 
Till faster faster the whole thing blows! 
A runaway train smashing into a station 
Eruptions fly in exultation! 
Full body slamming from the top 
Yields a fair good splashing crop 
Full body slamming from behind 
You love it babe – hard and kind! 
From after midnight thru till noon 
Like dogs in heat before the moon! 
Entangled and caught within your snare 
Your touch and love are all my care.

'What ails you that you look so pale,
O fisher of the sea?'
''Tis for a mournful tale I own,
Fair maiden Marjorie.'
'What is the dreary tale to tell,
O toiler of the sea?'
'I cast my net into the waves,
Sweet maiden Marjorie.
'I cast my net into the tide,
Before I made for home;
Too heavy for my hands to raise,
I drew it through the foam.'
'What saw you that you look so pale,
Sad searcher of the sea?'
'A dead man's body from the deep
My haul had brought to me!'
'And was he young, and was he fair?'
'Oh, cruel to behold!
In his white face the joy of life
Not yet was grown a-cold.'
'Oh, pale you are, and full of prayer
For one who sails the sea.'
'Because the dead looked up and spoke,
Poor maiden Marjorie.'

'What said he, that you seem so sad,
O fisher of the sea?
(Alack! I know it was my love,
Who fain would speak to me!)'
'He said, ‘Beware a woman's mouth—
A rose that bears a thorn.’'
'Ah, me! these lips shall smile no more
That gave my lover scorn.'
'He said, ‘Beware a woman's eyes.
They pierce you with their death.’'
'Then falling tears shall make them blind
That robbed my dear of breath.'
'He said, ‘Beware a woman's hair—
A serpent's coil of gold.’'
'Then will I shear the cruel locks
That crushed him in their fold.'
'He said, ‘Beware a woman's heart
As you would shun the reef.’'
'So let it break within my breast,
And perish of my grief.'
'He raised his hands a woman's name
Thrice bitterly he cried
My net had parted with the strain;
He vanished in the tide.'
'A woman's name! What name but mine,
O fisher of the sea?'
'A woman's name, but not your name,
Poor maiden Marjorie.

'Strawberries that in gardens grow
Are plump and juicy fine,
But sweeter far as wise men know
Spring from the woodland vine.

No need for bowl or silver spoon,
Sugar or spice or cream,
Has the wild berry plucked in June
Beside the trickling stream.

One such to melt at the tongue's root,
Confounding taste with scent,
Beats a full peck of garden fruit:
Which points my argument.

May sudden justice overtake
And snap the froward pen,
That old and palsied poets shake
Against the minds of men;

Blasphemers trusting to hold caught
In far-flung webs of ink
The utmost ends of human thought,
Till nothing's left to think.

But may the gift of heavenly peace
And glory for all time
Keep the boy Tom who tending geese
First made the nursery rhyme.

By the brookside one August day,
Using the sun for clock,
Tom whiled the languid hours away
Beside his scattering flock,

Carving with a sharp pointed stone
On a broad slab of slate
The famous lives of Jumping Joan,
Dan Fox and Greedy Kate;

Rhyming of wolves and bears and birds,
Spain, Scotland, Babylon,
That sister Kate might learn the words
To tell to Toddling John.

But Kate, who could not stay content
To learn her lesson pat,
New beauty to the rough lines lent
By changing this or that;

And she herself set fresh things down
In corners of her slate,
Of lambs and lanes and London Town.

The baby loved the simple sound,
With jolly glee he shook,
And soon the lines grew smooth and round
Like pebbles in Tom's brook,

From mouth to mouth told and retold
By children sprawled at ease
Before the fire in winter's cold,
In June beneath tall trees;

Till though long lost are stone and slate,
Though the brook no more runs,
And dead long time are Tom, John, Kate,
Their sons and their sons' sons;

Yet, as when Time with stealthy tread
Lays the rich garden waste,
The woodland berry ripe and red
Fails not in scent or taste,

So these same rhymes shall still be told
To children yet unborn,
While false philosophy growing old
Fades and is killed by scorn. 

Among the earliest saints of old, before the first Hegira,
I find the one whose name we hold, St. Nicholas of Myra:
The best-beloved name, I guess, in sacred nomenclature,—
The patron-saint of helpfulness, and friendship, and good-nature.

A bishop and a preacher too, a famous theologian,
He stood against the Arian crew and fought them like a Trojan:
But when a poor man told his need and begged an alms in trouble,
He never asked about his creed, but quickly gave him double.

Three pretty maidens, so they say, were longing to be married;
But they were paupers, lack-a-day, and so the suitors tarried.
St. Nicholas gave each maid a purse of golden ducats chinking,
And then, for better or for worse, they wedded quick as winking.

Once, as he sailed, a storm arose; wild waves the ship surrounded;
The sailors wept and tore their clothes, and shrieked "We'll all be drownded!"
St. Nicholas never turned a hair; serenely shone his halo;
He simply said a little prayer, and all the billows lay low.

The wicked keeper of an inn had three small urchins taken,
And cut them up in a pickle-bin, and salted them for bacon.
St. Nicholas came and picked them out, and put their limbs together,—
They lived, they leaped, they gave a shout, "St. Nicholas forever!"

And thus it came to pass, you know, that maids without a nickel,
And sailor-lads when tempest blow, and children in a pickle,
And every man that's fatherly, and every kindly matron,
In choosing saints would all agree to call St. Nicholas patron.

He rings the merry bells that chime good-will to all the living;
He blesses every friendly deed and every free donation;
He sows the secret, golden seed of love through all creation.

Our fathers drank to Santa Claus, the sixth of each December,
And still we keep his feast because his virtues we remember.
Among the saintly ranks he stood, with smiling human features,
And said, "Be good! But not too good to love your fellow-creatures!"It's friday evening from life's cares we'll have a brief leave taking
And lets go to the Basy Pub for hour of merry making
In confines of the Settlers Bar the voice of mirth is ringing
And Pete Atkinson from Dublin Town an Irish song is singing.

The Mckelvey men father and son are talking of horse racing
They know the horses inside out from form and race card tracing
Has Vo rogue gone over the hill, can Horlicks race to glory
Can Almaarad come bouncing back and go down in history? 

Phil Cronin go back down the years he flick back through life pages
To friends he knew in Millstreet Town he has not seen for ages
Big Jerry Shea and Mister O, James Manley hale and hearty
And Johnny Sing from Millview Lane the life of every party.

Brave Harry the brave English man the one as tough as leather
You'll only see that man in shorts no matter what the weather
A man of elephantine strength yet gentle and kind hearted
And he has taken life's hardest blow since his son this world departed.

Big Mick Kissane the Kerry man he doesn't like Maggie Thatcher
And he feels that for Union bashing that few in history could match her
Still he won't go back to Kenmare to weather wet and hazy
He'd much prefer Mt Evelyn it's nearer to the Baysy.

Mick Kelleher and Phil Schofield well into greyhound breeding
They talk of how greyhounds should be schooled and for them proper feeding
Two greyhound trainers and of late their reputations growing
And Millstreet Town keep racing on when others dogs are slowing.

Vin Schofield a Manchester Man he does love Man United
And every time United win he feel proud and delighted
But United not doing well of late of late they're not impressing
And this too much for him to take he find it all depressing.

Galway's Matt Duggan and Westmeath's Sean Fay the hurling game debating
On the first sunday of September who will be celebrating
Can Westmeath make the big break through or will Galway flags be waving
Or will Tipperary still be champs their reputation saving? 

And Marty Kerins from Mayo a good and happy fellow
I've never met him in bad mood I've always found him mellow
He love the Bayswater Hotel he say there is none better
And to be kept from Settlers Bar he'd have to be in fetter.

And Mick O Shea from Dublin his friends are in the many
And he doesn't have one enemy and he doesn't deserve any
He's given homes to Homeless souls and he's easily moved to pity
And good a man as ever came to live in this great City.

The amazing J D Ellis his name and fame keep spreading
And he has bounced back from the floor and for the top he's heading
Still he is easily stirred up and Garry Carter does the stirring
And el tigre he begins to growl the cat's no longer purring.

It's friday evening from life's cares we'll have a brief leave taking
And where better than the Basy Pub for hour of merry making
In Confines of the Settlers Bar the voice of mirth is ringing
And Pete Atkinson from Dublin Town an Irish song is singing. 

Read at a meeting of the Massachusetts Historical Society.

No! never such a draught was poured
Since Hebe served with nectar
Her over-kind protector,--
Since Father Noah squeezed the grape
And took to such behaving
As would have shamed our grandsire ape
Before the days of shaving,--
No! ne'er was mingled such a draught
In palace, hall, or arbor,
As freemen brewed and tyrants quaffed
That night in Boston Harbor!
The Western war-cloud's crimson stained
The Thames, the Clyde, the Shannon;
Full many a six-foot grenadier
The flattened grass had measured,
And many a mother many a year
Her tearful memories treasured;
Fast spread the tempest's darkening pall,
The mighty realms were troubled,
The storm broke loose, but first of all
The Boston teapot bubbled!

An evening party,--only that,
No formal invitation,
No gold-laced coat, no stiff cravat,
No feast in contemplation,
No silk-robed dames, no fiddling band,
No flowers, no songs, no dancing,--
A tribe of red men, axe in hand,--
Behold the guests advancing!
How fast the stragglers join the throng,
From stall and workshop gathered!
The lively barber skips along
And leaves a chin half-lathered;
The smith has flung his hammer down,
The horseshoe still is glowing;
The truant tapster at the Crown
Has left a beer-cask flowing;
The cooper's boys have dropped the adze,
And trot behind their master;
Up run the tarry ship-yard lads,--
The crowd is hurrying faster,--
Out from the Millpond's purlieus gush
The streams of white-faced millers,
And down their slippery alleys rush
The lusty young Fort-Hillers--
The ropewalk lends its 'prentice crew,--
The tories seize the omen:
'Ay, boys, you'll soon have work to do
For England's rebel foemen,
'King Hancock,' Adams, and their gang,
That fire the mob with treason,--
When these we shoot and those we hang
The town will come to reason.'

On--on to where the tea-ships ride!
And now their ranks are forming,--
A rush, and up the Dartmouth's side
The Mohawk band is swarming!
See the fierce natives! What a glimpse
Of paint and fur and feather,
As all at once the full-grown imps
Light on the deck together!
A scarf the pigtail's secret keeps,
A blanket hides the breeches,--
And out the cursed cargo leaps,
And overboard it pitches!

O woman, at the evening board
So gracious, sweet, and purring,
So happy while the tea is poured,
So blest while spoons are stirring,
What martyr can compare with thee,
The mother, wife, or daughter,
That night, instead of best Bohea,
Condemned to milk and water!

Ah, little dreams the quiet dame
Who plies with' rock and spindle
The patient flax, how great a flame
Yon little spark shall kindle!
The lurid morning shall reveal
A fire no king can smother
Where British flint and Boston steel
Have clashed against each other!
Old charters shrivel in its track,
His Worship's bench has crumbled,

It climbs and clasps the union-jack,
Its blazoned pomp is humbled,
The flags go down on land and sea
Like corn before the reapers;
So burned the fire that brewed the tea
That Boston served her keepers!

The waves that wrought a century's wreck
Have rolled o'er whig and tory;
The Mohawks on the Dartmouth's deck
Still live in song and story;
The waters in the rebel bay
Have kept the tea-leaf savor;
Our old North-Enders in their spray
Still taste a Hyson flavor;
And Freedom's teacup still o'erflows
With ever fresh libations,
To cheat of slumber all her foes
And cheer the wakening nations. 

A fleet with flags arrayed
Sailed from the port of Brest,
And the Admiral's ship displayed
The signal: 'Steer southwest.'
For this Admiral D'Anville
Had sworn by cross and crown
To ravage with fire and steel
Our helpless Boston Town. 

There were rumors in the street,
In the houses there was fear
Of the coming of the fleet,
And the danger hovering near.
And while from mouth to mouth
Spread the tidings of dismay,
I stood in the Old South,
Saying humbly: 'Let us pray! 

But if in thy Providence
A tempest should arise
To drive the French fleet hence,
And scatter it far and wide,
Or sink it in the sea,
We should be satisfied,
And thine the glory be.' 

This was the prayer I made,
For my soul was all on flame,
And even as I prayed
The answering tempest came;
It came with a mighty power,
Shaking the windows and walls,
And tolling the bell in the tower,
As it tolls at funerals. 

The lightning suddenly
Unsheathed its flaming sword,
And I cried: 'Stand still, and see
The heavens were black with cloud,
The sea was white with hail,
And ever more fierce and loud
Blew the October gale. 

The fleet it overtook,
And the broad sails in the van
Like the tents of Cushan shook,
Or the curtains of Midian.
Down on the reeling decks
Crashed the o'erwhelming seas;
Ah, never were there wrecks
So pitiful as these! 

Like a potter's vessel broke
The great ships of the line;
They were carried away as a smoke,
Or sank like lead in the brine.
They vanished and ceased to be,
When thou didst walk in wrath
With thine horses through the sea

The sun rises in south east corner of things
To look on the tall house of the Shin
For they have a daughter named Rafu,
(pretty girl)
She made the name for herself: 'Gauze Veil,'
For she feeds mulberries to silkworms.
She gets them by the south wall of the town.
With green strings she makes the warp of her basket,
She makes the shoulder-straps of her basket
from the boughs of Katsura,
And she piles her hair up on the left side of her headpiece.

Her earrings are made of pearl,
Her underskirt is of green pattern-silk,
Her overskirt is the same silk dyed in purple,
And when men going by look on Rafu
They set down their burdens,
They stand and twirl their moustaches. 

Into the woods my Master went,
Clean forspent, forspent.
Into the woods my Master came,
Forspent with love and shame.
But the olives they were not blind to Him,
The little gray leaves were kind to Him:
The thorn-tree had a mind to Him
When into the woods He came.

Out of the woods my Master went,
And He was well content.
Out of the woods my Master came,
Content with death and shame.
When Death and Shame would woo Him last,
From under the trees they drew Him last:
'Twas on a tree they slew Him -  last
When out of the woods He came. 

Two knights rode forth at early dawn 
A-seeking maids to wed, 
Said one, "My lady must be fair, 
With gold hair on her head


Then spake the other knight-at-arms: 
"I care not for her face, 
But she I love must be a dove 
For purity and grace


And each knight blew upon his horn 
And went his separate way, 
And each knight found a lady-love 
Before the fall of day.

But she was brown who should have had 
The shining yellow hair -- 
I ween the knights forgot their words 
Or else they ceased to care.

For he who wanted purity 
Brought home a wanton wild, 
And when each saw the other knight 
I ween that each knight smiled. 

As I between the dusk and dark
Walked down by Hampton Towers,
I strayed upon the haunted path
In the forbidden hours.
I paced the long and lonesome way
In meditation deep,
And there I saw a little maid
Who bitterly did weep.
Quaint was her silken robe and flowed
In some disorder down,
And on her slender shoulders fell
Her locks of tangled brown.
'Too late! Too late!' she weeping cried,
Her voice was like the wind—
She passed and wrung her lily hands
And left me far behind. 

A maid distraught indeed was she
Her anguish all confessed—
In the sharp sighing that flew forth
From out her heaving breast.
When she had gone an echo flew
Across the haunted bower;
'Too late! Too late!' the whisper came
From ev'ry sleeping flower.
I met a youth upon the path
And bade him tell to me
If he had seen the little maid
Who wept so dolefully.
Upon his cheek the ruddy rose
Swift faded into white,
The wailing ghost this night.
'Pray, pray,' he cried, 'and shrive your soul,
And so avert your fate,'
And as he flew me swift in fear
A whisper cried 'Too late!'

An evil prayer rose to my lip
To hold her slender hands in mine,
And know her secret grief.

'Though all the critics' canons grow-
Far seedier than the actors' own-
Although the cottage-door's too low-
Although the fairy's twenty stone-
Although, just like the telephone,
She comes by wire and not by wings,
Though all the mechanism's known-
Believe me, there are real things.

Yes, real people-even so-
Even in a theatre, truth is known,
Though the agnostic will not know,
And though the gnostic will not own,
There is a thing called skin and bone,
And many a man that struts and sings
Has been as stony-broke as stone . . .
Believe me, there are real things

There is an hour when all men go;
An hour when man is all alone.
When idle minstrels in a row
Went down with all the bugles blown-
When brass and hymn and drum went down,
Down in death's throat with thunderings-
Ah, though the unreal things have grown,
Believe me, there are real things.

                ENVOY.

Prince, though your hair is not your own
And half your face held on by strings,
And if you sat, you'd smash your throne-
-Believe me, there are real things. 

I have walked through tougher Harlem where few strangers dare to go
And I've been in London City in the rain and in the snow
And I've worked in inner Melbourne in the searing summer heat
And believe me if I tell you I have earned the bread I eat.

I have laboured in deep trenches with my life I've took a dare
And I've worked in cherry pickers ninety foot up in the air
And the hands of time keep turning and the years go quickly by
And the man who lives on welfare is still better off than I.

And who needs the tag of good worker it's no big deal anyway
He's a wiser and better off man who sits at home all day
And his conscience doesn't prick him isn't he the lucky one
And must I be one great idiot to go labouring in the sun.

I was low in social ladder and I still am way down low
And I feel my life's been wasted for my years have nought to show
Some may say he's a good worker that's of little use to me
All I need is lots of money I don't need your sympathy.

I felt happy for a brief while in a green Land miles away
In that beautiful green Country where I lived for many a day
I felt inwardly contented even though I was quite poor
Listening to the pipits piping in the meads of Annagloor.

Till the wanderlust possessed me I grew restless as the wind
Pity on all migrant workers, pity on all wandering kind
Went to live in foreign city worked with strong hard working men
But I've nought to show for labour I'm poor now as I was then.

In Ireland I cut down pine trees in the hills where bracken grow
And in Wales I picked potatoes many, many years ago
I have laboured for a living on myself I have been cruel
All the World laughs at an idiot all the World laughs at a fool.

I am getting old and weary and what hair I've left is gray
And I'm well beyond the fifty and I've seen a better day
And like the work weary work horse all the better years are gone
And I still work as a labourer and I still keep plodding on.

Please don't say he's a good worker such words I don't wish to hear
For I've nought to show for labour though I've worked for many a year
Words like 'good hard working fellow' does not do a thing for me
All I need is lots of money, I don't need your sympathy. 

Sometime this world was so steadfast and stable,
That man's word was held obligation;
And now it is so false and deceivable,
That word and work, as in conclusion,
Be nothing one; for turned up so down
Is all this world, through meed and wilfulness,
That all is lost for lack of steadfastness.

What makes this world to be so variable,
But lust that folk have in dissension?
For now-a-days a man is held unable
But if he can, by some collusion,
Do his neighbour wrong or oppression.
What causeth this but wilful wretchedness,
That all is lost for lack of steadfastness?

Truth is put down, reason is holden fable;
Virtue hath now no domination;
Pity exil'd, no wight is merciable;
Through covetise is blent discretion;
The worlde hath made permutation
From right to wrong, from truth to fickleness,
That all is lost for lack of steadfastness.

L'Envoy.

O Prince! desire to be honourable;
Cherish thy folk, and hate extortion;
Suffer nothing that may be reprovable
To thine estate, done in thy region;
Show forth the sword of castigation;
And wed thy folk again to steadfastness. 

They spoke of Progress spiring round,
Of light and Mrs Humphrey Ward-
It is not true to say I frowned,
Or ran about the room and roared;
I might have simply sat and snored-
I rose politely in the club
And said, `I feel a little bored;
Will someone take me to a pub?'

The new world's wisest did surround
Me; and it pains me to record
I did not think their views profound,
Or their conclusions well assured;
The simple life I can't afford,
Besides, I do not like the grub-
I want a mash and sausage, `scored'-
Will someone take me to a pub?

I know where Men can still be found,
Anger and clamorous accord,
And virtues growing from the ground,
And fellowship of beer and board,
And song, that is a sturdy cord,
And hope, that is a hardy shrub,
Will someone take me to a pub?

Envoi
Prince, Bayard would have smashed his sword
To see the sort of knights you dub-
Will someone take me to a pub

The gallows in my garden, people say,
Is new and neat and adequately tall;
I tie the noose on in a knowing way
As one that knots his necktie for a ball;
But just as all the neighbours--on the wall--
Are drawing a long breath to shout "Hurray!"
The strangest whim has seized me. . . . After all
I think I will not hang myself to-day. 

To-morrow is the time I get my pay--
My uncle's sword is hanging in the hall--
I see a little cloud all pink and grey--
Perhaps the rector's mother will not call-- I fancy that I heard from Mr. Gall
That mushrooms could be cooked another way--
I never read the works of Juvenal--
I think I will not hang myself to-day.

The world will have another washing-day;
The decadents decay; the pedants pall;
And H. 

G. Wells has found that children play,
And Bernard Shaw discovered that they squall,
Rationalists are growing rational--
And through thick woods one finds a stream astray
So secret that the very sky seems small--
I think I will not hang myself to-day. 

Envoi

Prince, I can hear the trumpet of Germinal,
The tumbrils toiling up the terrible way;
Even to-day your royal head may fall,
I think I will not hang myself to-day. 

Despite heart of dirt, Mother earth, 
Yours is far more farsighted
Than my in-drying and bomb blast minded heart
Of flesh. 

You have no thirst for blood or any pride
Of the tumult of discrimination. Ungifted
With passionate warmth, you still view all with
Equity, feed the living, cherish the dead 
And camouflage doctors' mistakes. 

As love 
In non human form, your service driven life, 
Makes thankful use of selflessness, 
Ever transforming the napalm
Scattered by my war wealth conscious me, 
In the military air, into life sustaining breeze.
Glorified by the great secret implicit
In your silence, You rotate praying
 Who knows not what he does.

'W'en de banjos wuz a-ringin',
An' de darkies wuz a-singin',
Oh, wuzen dem de good times sho!
All de ole folks would be chattin',
An' de pickaninnies pattin',
As dey heah'd de feet a-shufflin' 'cross de flo'.

An' how we'd dance, an' how we'd sing!
Dance tel de day done break.
An' how dem banjos dey would ring,
An' de cabin flo' would shake!

Come along, come along,
Come along, come along,
Don't you heah dem banjos a-ringin'?

Gib a song, gib a song,
Gib a song, gib a song,
Git yo' feet fixed up fu' a-wingin'.

W'ile de banjos dey go plunka, plunka, plunk,
We'll dance tel de ole flo' shake;
W'ile de feet keep a-goin' chooka, chooka, chook,
We'll dance tel de day done break. 

He drank strong waters and his speech was coarse;
He purchased raiment and forbore to pay';
He stuck a trusting junior with a horse,
And won gymkhanas in a doubtful way.
Then 'twixt a vice and folly, turned aside
To do good deeds and straight to cloak them, lied. 

Let our borrowers pay us back
We can take no more flack
We have to remain on track
Or face the inevitable sack
Governments, tax payers, citizens
You name them 
They are watching us
With focussed eagle eyes
We are literally surrounded by spies

Any whiff about a distressed asset
Or a loan turning toxic
Even if it is only an empty rumour
Is enough to send our stocks south ward
And of course provide the usual fodder 
For dinner time conversations
Which continue to dwell unendingly 
On the familiar greed narrative 

Bankers’ bonuses and compensation
Are believed to have been the cause 
Of the recent financial crisis
Apparently we did deliberately 
Court disaster by
Totally disregarding long term risk
Just to take home meatier pay packages
We would not be here now
Offering this fervent prayer to you


Overwhelmed, 
Presence, 
Shelter, 
Inheritance, 
Performance; 
Wash and take up a banner of peace, 
For around us are full of wars! 

Wash, ash, was, saw, as, has; 
It is shaking like a snake and it is sinking! ! 
But take up a banner of peace to save your life. 

A banshee required my assistance
For our sort of play with combat, 
It carried a strain of germ, an acceptance
To the church of danger, the church for the acrobat.

We carry out our danger for all the eyes
In this fearful world, over the edge
Is a monumental lesson that true allies
Converse with the banshee as a pledge.

With the straightedge, or ruler, 
I measure its gaze and make a weapon
This day is like a magic item - an abductor
Of a right called real life, it required absolution. 

It's a rainy day
Nobody peeps yet? 
I sweep the floor
Last night's gathering
All sort of hair.
And it's very hard to segregrate
This's King's and that's Pauper's
Some were straight and some kinky, 
Anyway I took the shovel and collected
All into the same bin.
And a customer comes in, 
Offered me a big note
For a Crew cut! 
I said sorry as I do not have change.
And he promised to return the money
Some other day but he never returned.
And quite sometimes I came to know
That he's a rebellious blacklisted Lawyer
From a quiet village.
And he's killed by an unknown
On his way home at midnight! 
Still I could sniff that odor
Some kind of spirit in the soul! 

*Death will come on padded feet
Carrying Roses in its mouth.


Is there a whim-inspired fool, 
Owre fast for thought, owre hot for rule, 
Owre blate to seek, owre proud to snool, 
Let him draw near; 
And owre this grassy heap sing dool, 
And drap a tear. 

Is there a bard of rustic song, 
Who, noteless, steals the crowds among, 
That weekly this area throng, 
O, pass not by! 
But, with a frater-feeling strong, 
Here, heave a sigh. 

Is there a man, whose judgment clear 
Can others teach the course to steer, 
Yet runs, himself, life's mad career, 
Wild as the wave, 
Here pause-and, thro' the starting tear, 
Survey this grave. 

The poor inhabitant below 
Was quick to learn the wise to know, 
And keenly felt the friendly glow, 
And softer flame; 
But thoughtless follies laid him low, 
And stain'd his name! 

Reader, attend! whether thy soul 
Soars fancy's flights beyond the pole, 
Or darkling grubs this earthly hole, 
In low pursuit: 
Know, prudent, cautious, self-control 
Is wisdom's root. 

I am in the present perfect
Where I have always been, 
Finally reaching
Something of my own 
Which makes tomorrow
A day worth following. 

As I rise with the orange glow
Of an enterprising ideal
That is too ardent
And possessive to let go. 

I may be unknown and alone, 
But the real one is ready
Apart from here
And has become part of the world
I am striving for. 

Separating the many
Halves of me
And sorting them
Into the infinite good or bad
I am most likely to succeed. 

The Cause is the ideal, 
The ideal is the principle
And the tempter's key
Which unlocks or fastens
The door of immortality. 


For May is here once more, and so is he, -- 
His dusty trousers, rolled half to the knee, 
And his bare ankles grimy, too, as they: 
Cross-hatchings of the nettle, in array 
Of feverish stripes, hint vividly to me 
Of woody pathways winding endlessly 
Along the creek, where even yesterday 
He plunged his shrinking body -- gasped and shook -- 
Yet called the water 'warm,' with never lack 
Of joy. And so, half enviously I look 
Upon this graceless barefoot and his track, -- 
His toe stubbed -- ay, his big toe-nail knocked back 
Like unto the clasp of an old pocketbook. 

I don't mean to frustrate you.
I just don't have forever like you do.
When I tremble you, you tremble me worse.
Did you even think of that? 
I have never even ridden a horse! 
How do I fall up? How do I get down? 
You never thought about that, just assumed! 
I would not even know where to look for a saddle.
Would you? 
Here then climb back on.. 

watch that seal.. 

for Dore and Adja

Under the bronze crown 
Too big for the head of the stone cherub whose feet   
      A serpent has begun to eat, 
Sweet water brims a cockle and braids down 

            Past spattered mosses, breaks 
On the tipped edge of a second shell, and fills   
      The massive third below. It spills 
In threads then from the scalloped rim, and makes 

            A scrim or summery tent 
For a faun-menage and their familiar goose.   
      Happy in all that ragged, loose 
Collapse of water, its effortless descent 

            And flatteries of spray, 
The stocky god upholds the shell with ease, 
      Watching, about his shaggy knees, 
The goatish innocence of his babes at play; 

            His fauness all the while 
Leans forward, slightly, into a clambering mesh   
      Of water-lights, her sparkling flesh 
In a saecular ecstasy, her blinded smile 

            Bent on the sand floor 
Of the trefoil pool, where ripple-shadows come 
      And go in swift reticulum, 
More addling to the eye than wine, and more 

            Interminable to thought 
Than pleasure's calculus. Yet since this all   
      Is pleasure, flash, and waterfall,   
Must it not be too simple? Are we not 

            More intricately expressed 
In the plain fountains that Maderna set 
      Before St. Peter's—the main jet   
Struggling aloft until it seems at rest 

            In the act of rising, until   
The very wish of water is reversed, 
      That heaviness borne up to burst   
In a clear, high, cavorting head, to fill 

            With blaze, and then in gauze   
Delays, in a gnatlike shimmering, in a fine 
      Illumined version of itself, decline, 
And patter on the stones its own applause? 

            If that is what men are 
Or should be, if those water-saints display   
      The pattern of our aretê, 
What of these showered fauns in their bizarre, 

            Spangled, and plunging house? 
They are at rest in fulness of desire 
      For what is given, they do not tire 
Of the smart of the sun, the pleasant water-douse 

            And riddled pool below, 
Reproving our disgust and our ennui   
      With humble insatiety. 
Francis, perhaps, who lay in sister snow 

            Before the wealthy gate 
Freezing and praising, might have seen in this   
      No trifle, but a shade of bliss— 
That land of tolerable flowers, that state 

            As near and far as grass 
Where eyes become the sunlight, and the hand   
      Is worthy of water: the dreamt land 
Toward which all hungers leap, all pleasures pass. 

The warping night air having brought the boom
Of an owl's voice into her darkened room,
We tell the wakened child that all she heard
Was an odd question from a forest bird,
Asking of us, if rightly listened to,
"Who cooks for you?" and then "Who cooks for you?"

Words, which can make our terrors bravely clear,
Can also thus domesticate a fear,
And send a small child back to sleep at night
Not listening for the sound of stealthy flight
Or dreaming of some small thing in a claw
Borne up to some dark branch and eaten raw. 

A pretty soul is better                                                   Than the whole barrels of                                                Oil anytime and anywhere,                                                  People are addicted to oil                                                Because they love oil and                                                 They love to drive anytime,                                                 People are slaughtered like                                              Sheep and cows everywhere                                                  And no one cares about people's                                         Lives anytime and anywhere,                                               Some people see a barrel of                                                Oil is better than a pretty                                              Soul and a very great life,                                               The whole world is addicted                                                To save the barrels of oil                                                 Rather than to save a pretty soul, so                                       A human being's life is cheaper                                             Than an ugly barrel of oil anytime. 

Did you ever see a barrel of wine
With the ruby red liquid trickling down? 
Just the thought of the delicious taste
Brings a smile instead of a frown

This wonderful wine is stored carefully
You can almost taste it on your tongue
It's really tremendously exciting
To see what sweet grapes have become

But if you've made another choice
Well, sometimes it's kind of hard
But now you know and can plainly see
It's a treasure right from a vineyard

Freshly mown hay
And lawn before mowing, 
Cuneiform signs
Freshly to carve in stone, 
Words still unbroken, 
Bumping into each other, 
Clouds full of rain, 
Kissed sighs, 
Bath, water of love, 
Children again, 
Breast milk still, 
Sun and moon
Falling into 
Ignorance, 
Water of life flowing
Among the rough stones, 
Honey in a broken hive, 
Crystal slope angle
Painfully to dig into 
Cuneiform signs, 
A need to come into being. 

His death poem:

        A bath when you're born,
        a bath when you die,
        how stupid.




A rather lovely hilly place
resides below her lovely face
and beyond that, a lovely valley
reveals a fertile grove that’s pally


[the first line comes from a lady's bio-data on this site. ]Sun soaked revelations
on a patio deck.

I had long forgotten
the simple joys
Of returning to origin.

In its bosom, 
the well worn comfort
Of familiarity, 
combined with the 
clear remembrance 
Of lake breeze air.

Every milestone, 
And accomplishment, 
All seen by the unending tide
Of water in motion.

From the eyes of my window: 

the first breath of my brother 
and the last sight of my cousin.

The first taste of a woman 
and my last meeting with her. 

All trials, 
Tribulations, 
And friendships
Have come, gone
and began again
here. 

Lonely winter nights, 
The ferocity of the wind off the beach
almost too much to bear.
Nowhere to go, 
Except the solace of a guitar, 
You taught yourself well back then.

My first car, 
Driving around in circles, 
a "summer town" deserted in the winter, 
And a father
Eager to pass this rite to his son.

Later, 
Cracks in a marriage, 
like holes in a wall, 
and a lonely teenager hoping for the best.
Ultimately, 
reconciliation.

My first taste of addiction.
Parents out of town, 
I wanted to be the "cool kid".
A party remembered, 
The stench of cigarettes, 
Never
Again 
Forgotten. 

All within these walls.


Outside, 
Clear hot air.
I lay back
And gaze deeply 
Into the trunk, 
of the tree, 
I have seen all
My life. 

My great aunt used to tell me
that on the branches, 
Of this particular tree
Sits a wise old owl.
He will watch over you
During this life.

To a child
An owl shaped branch, 
Can give breath quite easily.
Yet I never truly understood 
Her message.

Now
That branch is long since gone, 
As is she.
And at times when I need her wisdom
Most
I remember the owl. 

Today it is clear to me.

Just as the roots
Of a tree anchor
mighty oak, 
My home
Anchors me.

I lay back
In my chair. 
Feet up, 
exhalation.

I am home, 

Rooted once again. 


And parents walking along
Beach is playground now

Eternity, has waited, patiently listens re verbs, thump.

Blind, without form, coalescing, a vibration becomes out.
Trillions, of invisable notes line every bar, I emerge into.
I cross the cleft, planets shimmer, closer to obelisk. 

I swell.
Murky, steam warm moist, I feel with my tongue, armless
still just this form, it circles, around pink button reaching.
My skull is rocked, shaken this flesh alive throbbing, on, off, 
singularly firm is planted, back to front, skyward.
Three simultaneous eruptions, Blanche the sky, thick with pink.
Comets whip it to thin, far flung, ripples, the void is once again born. 

Lonely as a cloud I was walking on the beach; 
Pain of love lost I was trying to forget in Nature.

Reclined I on a sand meadow musing over Moon.
Moon light beam was falling on the dancing waves
As light house beacon from the horizon to the shore 
Enlightening and guiding the sea faring boats there! 

A year old defunct light house is still standing 
As a memorial to the tourists coming to the beach! 
The past love too as the light house beacon remains 
In the mind forever to revive the glory of past times! 

Love bloomed as green plant but remains as blue Sky; 
But the past memory of love ever gives joy in dreams! 
Everyone’s life has a meaning for all to learn afterwards; 
But memory of love lives in the world till the end of time

How it glistens, beckoning and bright
Plunging all that I thought
All that I pondered, into the night.
All that is left is its taut
Flexibility. Now the heart is tight
With longing. Now the mind, caught
By its swaying, gives up its calm light.

Where will it take me, body and soul? 
How will I know the way? nothing glows
But its ungraspability. Fine, droll, 
Wittily wordless, it shows
Only its tireless self. Elusive its role-
I must follow where it goes, 
Unquestioning. Far off, it will not come for me. But close
And warm the image of it quivers. That is enough: the pole
Star shines, guiding, from its head into mine. I am pierced. I am whole. 

Life is so mesmerizing
The sky above-
Bottomless, endless, unfathomable
Impossible distances holding the secret of
Everything that exists: 
The universal chemistry kit
Which came complete with organic
Self- replicating life
Looking up, I can't imagine
All that I know and love
Came out of one furnace, one autoclave: 
Art and music and living beings
Books and medicine and science
Things still unimagined right now
Maybe it's all in an obscure book
On some magicians shelf
That becomes a three dimensional
Panorama, only when he opens it
And our millenia are but
A moments ponder in his study
And he's off to yet more bubbling worlds
Stirring the seething cauldrons
Making forms out of mind
Making universes out of nothingness
And a beakers-full of love. 

His pointed finger
resembled mutilation
a strange reflection.

His stare was cruel, 
and darkened by the shadow
of a large splinter. 

A bear came to dinner; 
He ate before the bell, 
He didn't use his napkin, 
I am here to tell.

He didn't cut his steak, 
Neatly; with the knife, 
And licked his mashed potatoes
Off the plate- it was not quiet.

He didn't wait for prayers, 
He didn't pass the bread-
But balanced it, most perkily, 
Atop his brown-bear head.

His manners more atrocious, 
Than any I have seen; 
But heavens, I'm so grateful
He didn't just eat me. 

Wunst, 'way West in Illinoise,
Wuz two Bears an' their two boys:
An' the two boys' names, you know,
Wuz--like _ours_ is,--Jim an' Jo;
An' their _parunts'_ names wuz same's,
All big grown-up people's names,--
Ist _Miz_ Bear, the neighbers call
'Em, an' _Mister_ Bear--'at's all.
Yes--an' Miz Bear scold him, too,
Ist like grown folks _shouldn't_ do!

Wuz a grea'-big river there,
An', 'crosst that, 's a mountain where
Old Bear said some day he'd go,
Ef she don't quit scoldin'so!
So, one day when he been down
The river, fishin', 'most to town,
An' come back 'thout no fish a-tall,
An' Jim an' Jo they run an' bawl
An' tell their ma their pa hain't fetch'
No fish,--she scold again an' ketch
Her old broom up an' biff him, too.--

An' he ist cry, an' say, '_Boo-hoo_!
I _told_ you what I 'd do some day'.'
An' he ist turned an' runned away
To where's the grea'-big river there,
An' ist _splunged_ in an' swum to where
The mountain's at, 'way th'other side,
An' clumbed up there. An' Miz Bear _cried_--
An' little Jo an' little Jim--
Ist like their ma--bofe cried fer him!--
But he clumbed on, _clean out o' sight_,
He wuz so mad!--An' served 'em right!

Nen--when the Bear got 'way on top
The mountain, he heerd somepin' flop
Its wings--an' somepin' else he heerd
A-rattlin'-like.--An' he wuz _skeerd_,
An' looked 'way up, an'--_Mercy sake!_--

It wuz a' Eagul an' a SNAKE!
An'-sir! the Snake, he bite an' kill'
The Eagul, an' they bofe fall till
They strike the ground--_k'spang-k'spat!_--
Wite where the Bear wuz standin' at!
An' when here come the Snake at him,
The Bear he think o' little Jim
An' Jo, he did--an' their ma, too,--
All safe at home; an' he ist flew
Back down the mountain--an' could hear
The old Snake rattlin', sharp an' clear,
Wite clos't behind!--An' Bear he's so
All tired out, by time, you know,
He git down to the river there,
He know' he can't _swim_ back to where
His folks is at. But ist wite nen
He see a boat an' six big men

'At's been a-shootin' ducks: An' so
He skeerd them out the boat, you know,
An' ist jumped in--an' Snake _he_ tried
To jump in, too, but failed outside
Where all the water wuz; an' so
The Bear grabs one the things you row
The boat wiv an' ist whacks the head
Of the old Snake an' kills him dead!--

An' when he's killed him dead, w'y, nen
_The old Snake's drownded dead again_!
Nen Bear set in the boat an' bowed
His back an' rowed--an' rowed--an' rowed--
Till he's safe home--so tired he can't
Do nothin' but lay there an' pant
An' tell his childern, 'Bresh my coat!'
An' tell his wife, 'Go chain my boat!'
An' they're so glad he's back, they say
'They _knowed_ he's comin' thataway
To ist surprise the dear ones there!'
An' Jim an' Jo they dried his hair

An' pulled the burrs out; an' their ma
She ist set there an' helt his paw
Till he wuz sound asleep, an' nen
She tell' him she won't scold again--
Never--never--never--
Ferever an' ferever

A lesson is learned each session.

A recession has progression to depression in succession. 

Once upon a time there was
A little bear named Teddy Fuzz
At night he’d hate to go to bed
"I wonna’ play tonight, " he said.
"Okay, my son, it’s up to you
For I’ll not tell you what to do.
"Stay up all night, " said Teddy’s mother
But don’t wake up your little brother."
He built a house with tinker toys
He played with all his soldier boys
With blocks and cars and boats and such
He took his ball and played some catch.
But pretty soon Teddy’s eyes grew faint
He dropped the brush as he tried to paint
So Teddy climbed in Mama’s bed
Upon her shoulder he laid his head.
"I can’t stay up, you’re right, " he said.
"Could you carry me to my bed? "Living away from Nature many are stranded nowhere, 
From where know not where to proceed or what to do! 
Mechanically trained in the name of discipline all lose all
And never able to realise what is their natural self here! 

Many do things contrary to their natural desire or self
And lay waste hidden power unused rotting to madness! 
This is the trend for modern man in the civilised world
Just pursuing beastly economic targets to fulfilment!  

Physically, intellectually and spiritually dissatisfied man
Roams as scholar gypsy to find peace and satisfaction, 
which not religion or philosophy will provide except Nature
As Nature is living scientific art that sustains all forever! 

So, economically developed man should develop socially
In harmony with Nature to find longing freedom, joy and peace

i tread on this hard path
laid down by my experiences
experiences gives birth to opinions
layer after layer
on and of the same opinion
a hard path i lay
to walk on it with
a thudding assurance
not straying
not looking
hither or thither
i walk on this beaten path

sadly..
out of love or what
i know not
all my experiences go
all the way out
to strengthen and pamper
my opinions to say
'see i told you so'
hampering my true vision
of the experiences

all my experiences go a waste
am made to take the beaten path
all the way.  

through life


I am really not much of a wordsmith my worth as a rhymer in doubt
But for me there is never a shortage of things that i can write about
A beautiful and sunny evening with a gentle cool coastal breeze
In the sunlit parks of Mermaid Waters birds chirp and sing on the bushes and trees
The beauty of Nature around me it is such a beautiful day
And the wonderful thing about Nature for to look you do not have to pay
The pied butcher birds are singing their songs one could never mistake
In the parks they have their morning chorus on the high trees in the gray of daybreak
I have been in love with Mother Nature since i was a very young boy
And every day i learn new things about her this is something that i do enjoy
I have written so many rhymes to her she is one i greatly admire
I do love for to sing her praises and of such i never could tire
The beautiful rainbow lorikeets do sing in small flocks as they fly
On this sunny evening in late Autumn without a gray cloud in the sky. 


For I  am that Angel who walks beside me. It's time that I live. So they could set me free. written

As the rose is joined for life to its stem, 
Is fed from its root, blazing colour to
All who would look, the bond that is sending
Such beauty into my life is with you.

As we two blossom with colourful love
And together feed from the same hearfelt
Need to reach out and give, desire to prove
Our devotion soars, and tenderly melts
Any small doubts, satisfies us, knowing
That beautiful bonding needs care, feeding
With time and sweet words. Reflecting the glow
Of destiny's banquet, we eat, no need
To resist such fine feast. As the flowers, 
Such are we,  - bonded, and so powerfully. 

the morning is so beautiful.. 

friend
wake up and see it yourself
the young dawns magic.. 

nothing seems old
as the new day unfolds
wake up and see for yourself.  

friend

if i shake you to wake you
you wake up with a shock in mind
sleep will leave its dread behind
the morning is so beautiful. 
wake up and see for yourself. . 

friend

it's not just about dawn


In the blue sky just a few specks of gray
In the evening of a beautiful day
Though last night it rained and more rain on the way
And that more rain is needed 'twould be fair to say
On a gum tree in the park the white backed magpie sing
He sings all year round from the Summer to Spring
But in late Winter and Spring he even sings at night
So nice to hear him piping in the moonlight
Spring it is with us and Summer is near
And beautiful weather for the time of year
Such beauty the poets and the artists inspire
Of talking of Nature could one ever tire
Her green of September Mother Nature wear
And the perfumes of blossoms in the evening air. 

The grass grew virtually overnight; the Buttercups 
so tall they spilled their beauty on the lawn
I have fallen behind in my everyday chores and duties; 
the mower quit working and is demanding a raise.
I couldn’t provide it with one; as I too have not been paid.
What the hell, I’m just sitting here on a Sunday, 
trying to put off today what I can get done on Monday.
Reclining in my favorite deck chair, sunning my cancers; 
the  fruit trees in blossom and the birds singing to their young, 
while mankind’s contributions crumble all about me 
and the mower holds the gas can in utter contempt.

The rufous whistler he is whistling his song to his identity a give away
His kind often whistle before rain and storm perhaps a change in the weather is near
One knows it will rain in warm Summer weather when the songs of the birds one does hear
The golden billed blackbird is whistling he is singing his welcome to rain
How birds can sense change in the weather seems beyond humankind to explain
They can detect change in their environment them we tend to underestimate
The welcome rain in the warm and dry Summer Nature's minstrels happy to celebrate
The more that we learn of Nature the less about her we know we know
As the mother of all living life forms our wonder of her only grow
As well as feeding humans she feeds all life forms to our own selves we are not being true
If we do not love our Earth Mother and pay her the respect she is due
A beautiful day in December the sun shines on the woodland trees
And the songs of Nature's feathered minstrels are carrying in the gentle breeze. 

The flies are buzzing in the sunshine and the little dark brown honeybees
Are busily gathering nectar from the flowers of the blossoming trees
On a beautiful day in October of around degrees
And Nature she is at her calmest with only a very faint breeze
Under the house eaves lined with lots of feathers the house sparrows have their nest of hay
Non singers devoted to chirping they seem to chirp all through the day
Such beauty to inspire poets and artists the beauty that Nature create
The willy wagtail with tail wagging is perched on the back garden gate
A tiny black and white long tailed flycatcher always on the look out for flies
One who mobs the much bigger magpie undaunted it does seem by size, 
A beautiful day in October butterflies flitting in the sunlight
And fuchsias and roses in full bloom such things that make a pretty sight
And Nature she is at her calmest with only a very slight breeze
And all around the sunlit garden the buzzings of flies and of bees. 

A breaking thought and I’m ready to begin
a smile of hope
and its all about to end
her face full of happiness
as she sits and ponders of her wants
 How can I break this child’s heart? 
Imagination thick
and everything she sees is a deep gray
black and white in this child’s eyes fades

She holds dear all those times when slides where the root of all that’s pure
and now she lay in a cot 
ready for the world to eat her away
heart so pure and pumping this blood to a beat
trying to endure all the pain that this life will bring

As the beat begins to slow her eyes flutter
And the eyes of her mother and now covered
she is now going to have to come with me.
Cause god told me this child needs to be set free
her cool body lifts and I carry her whole soul

I tell her we will walk until the light is too much
those stairs they only go up
and arms will be waiting to greet you
and this is your new fate
because today is the day all the pain goes away

Smile full of hope
and eyes only seeing gray
this child was set free on this fine winter day


You held a dried flower then laid it on the cold ground 
With your head bowed lowly the tears began to fall down
He felt your pain and sadness then said to you with a smile  
Lift up your eyes unto the hills then live life on my child

Lay your every concerns and cares gently upon My breast
Sorrows sure to come your way so try to stand lifes test
The light will always shine on you each and every day
Then you'll be able to say with joy come whatever may

A beautiful flower that had grown carefully picked from above 
Planted in His lovely garden to always be looked at with love  
Will never have to be nurtured nor ever to be watered again
To grow and flourish upward always having never ever to bend




She filled my numerous flaws. 

TSperhaps tonight is the end of dreams
end the lies of your perception
perhaps tomorrow starts a new story
passionately cared.  

regardless of theory. 

end absolutely the sweet moments
from the love that captures our hearts
pulled from the wreckage of  salvation
bring us back  the times of life. 

who will rescue the lonely heart
and cure the painful part? 
who will come to take the risk
to comfort the fading hope? . 

space and time is always another show
precious moments live once more
no one comes.  nothing is changed
lonely heart sleeps as is. 

soft breeze touches my skin
kills every moment of sensation
bury the love upon my dreams
to a place of no return.  

while you are still
half asleep tired of the last night's

thrill having engulfed so many drinks
with friends and kin

this early morning you hear the house-help 
sweeping the yard which is littered with 
paper and leaves and grass

you  hear the music of the sweeping and the
the rolling pebbles and the leaves and grass and
those wasted paper now forming into a heap

and then you begin to remember the past years
how the sweeping was made, how nature cleans its face
the tsunami, the earthquake, the wars, the killing of the tribes, 
the bombing of cities, the mass evacuation of people away from
their own countries, 
the flood and the wiping out of a village
the bushfire somewhere in australia
the huge conflagration in indonesia
the black smoke reachign singapore
and lots of other calamities


deaths of famous philosophers, politicians, 
actors, etcetera etcetera

the sweeping of the yard, the weeding out in the garden, 
the separation of the goats from the sheep
the slaughter and the punishment and rewards
and the burning in hell

how the weeds soon shall be taken out dried and burned
how the goats should be slaughtered

and in your bed you feel the grass growing on your chest
crawling to your body and you touch your forehead trying to feel
the goat's horn growing like a tree

and you wake up rush to the bathroom and look at yourself in the mirror asking yourself: 

where is the grass? where is the horn? have i become another goat
fit to be slaughtered and burned? 

and you open the window now seeing the house-help burning
the wastes of last night's thrills, 

how the fire glare
how she sits there smiling at you wanting to greet you
about

 a bright day, a beautiful morning
a beautiful life. . 

Underneath it all begins to ripple, 
beneath the accordion folds of a perfect afternoon, 
the phosphorescent streets lost in rain
while falling from vision, a number of pearly clouds

Words silent, when it all begins to unfold, 
how well I remember how it passed; 
washing the skin on the body, 
drinking in the feelings, the melting smiles
 
Igniting rare visions for numberless minutes-
praying before the stolen cenotaph
of a beautiful man's mind


Who has not crossed the bridge of, 
Pile of emotions keeps on flickering, 
Day and night like the beautiful stars, 
Twinkling in the sky, though not visible, 
In the bright sunlight! 
Like the Mask of beautiful smile, 
Covering the painful face.

No one knows whats going inside one's mind.
Like a birdie trapped, 
Inside a cage singing painful song.
Loud clapping heard outside for singing.
But inside the cage was a weeping bird.
No one listened her painful cries.

Like a joker in a circus, making the people laugh.
But inside his laughter lies the cries of pain.
As all his days were not pleasant ones.
Yet
He has to make people laugh
Whatever pain he carries with him.

A mask of beautiful smile hides all the pains behind.
Yes its the mask and only mask plays the beautiful roles.

Will I be ever able to unveil the mask? 
Yes, a day will come
When I will unveil my mask.
And laugh out loudly
Cry out loudly
Shout out loudly
And live a day only and only for me.

No day is same.
Every day is a new day 
As bright as sun! 
Which is sure to come in! ! ! 



Oh what a beautiful grey sky 
What I thought was a beautiful day
I freakin thought I could frolic through flowers
But I guess that went away


She has little money to enjoy or spend
But to other people she is a good friend
To help out her poverty line neighbours she goes out of her way
And for her assistance she never asks for pay.

A very good person that's to give her fair due
And to her higher self she will always be true
If she cannot help you she will not drag you down
The quiet unsung heroine of a very small Town.

Single in her early fifties she lives on her own
A halo of goodness around her has grown
A beautiful person untainted by conceit or guile
She has warmth in her greeting and warmth in her smile.

The quiet unsung hero with few words to say
She helps some-one in need of help every day
Does her elderly neighbours shopping for him he's confined to a wheel-chair
She is a great person her type seem so rare.

Just to live as a good person is her only life's goal
This beautiful woman with a beautiful soul
Untainted by snobbery or guile or conceit
One like her one does not meet on every street. 

Perhaps i enjoyed my few seconds of fame
When the beautiful lady she called me by name
The warmth of her greeting with me it did stay
And she surely did help for to brighten my day
Her best days behind her though 'twould be fair to say
That she looked quite lovely in her charming way
A beautiful person unshackled by care
Her great gift of happiness with others she does share
I felt a bit down in a self pitying mood
And about my small worries in silence did brood
But she cheered me up with her cheerful hello
From people like her joy and happiness grow
Perhaps in her sixties yet unsullied by time
And to her i do dedicate this simple rhyme. 

She sees things of beauty in all that she see
And what's beautiful to her seems ugly to me
What to her is a flower to me is a weed
We do seem so different so different indeed.

The window of her soul is open to light
She always seems happy and bubbly and bright
And her type of person a pleasure to know
For beauty goes with her where-ever she go.

Of those who are different good things she does say
And for to help out others she goes out of her way
She helps out the homeless and those in dire poverty
I do not know of anyone as great as she.

And sad to think her type are becoming more rare
For the poor and downtrodden she genuinely does care
To the most worthy causes her work free time she devote
Yet she is not seen as one worthy of note.

A beautiful person with a heart of gold
And surely her story deserves to be told
Not proud of her beauty and free of conceit
And people like her one does not often meet. 

The lorikeets chirp on the flowering gum trees it is such a beautiful day
And through the sunlit gardens the butterflies flit tiny dark spots on their wings of gray
The parklands and gardens lovely in their flowers and only a slight Summer breeze
The temperatures perfect for the time of year a tad over twenty degrees.

From this beautiful Country and beautiful place Utopia cannot be far away
For to view the beauty around us that is Nature's own money we do not have to pay
I could happily live here till the day I die surrounded by beauty so rare
No factory chimney billowing up black smoke and clean is the warm Summer air.

A painter could sketch such a beautiful place a poet about it could write
The birds chirp and whistle on bushes and trees in the early afternoon sunlight
The voices of the mynas one cannot mistake distinctive even in their song
You hear them once and you will know them again them you never ought to get wrong.

I could happily live here till the day I die this is such a beautiful place
Where Nature is happy and colourful and bright with a warm sunny smile on her face
A beautiful day in a beautiful clime a tad over twenty degrees
The lorikeets chirping on the flowering gums their wings as green as the leaves of the trees.

'Tis surely an Earthly Utopia Killarney by the Pacific sea
In the sunlit park by saltwater the magpie lark calls out pee wee
Between Warrnambool and Port Fairy where Nature's beauty and peace reside
Where the oystercatchers can be heard piping above the din of the incoming tide
Each time I have been in Killarney I have felt sad from there on going away
Such a beautiful place for to live in and visit the sea every day
The clear coastal air unpolluted no factory anywhere near
On the coastal trees by saltwater the magpie's flute pleasant to hear
Long before the first Europeans came here in the shade of the coastal trees
The people of Australia's Dreamtime sung and danced their corroborees
Their spirits live on in Killarney though they have gone the ways of time
From Killarney the gem of Victoria that inspires song, story and rhyme
A beautiful place old Killarney such beautiful places are rare
I have been to some scenic places but with any it can compare. 

I love you baby 
Deep from the core 
Of my humble heart 
Life would not be the same 
Without your voices malingering 
Into my wanting ears 

Your smile is my ecstasy 
Your glance is my victory 
Winning a cup of life 
Honey, don't say no 
When your heart is crying 
For my blood 
Don't turn your back on me 
When your body is craving 
For my swift musing
 
I want to move on 
Like I've owned this universe 
I love you 
I'd wear you 
Like a cloth 
Carry you everywhere I go 
Never look back 
All I've got 
Is a beautiful Rose 
That never dies 
In my heart 

What love is? 
Love is a Red Rose 
Where I tame you 
From the bud
I am the Sun and water
Grow you to live
You ‘re the air
That I breathe
A beautiful Rose for a Gentleman



PS: My passion for music is as great as for poetry. 

The song ' I want To Know What Love Is ' by the band group ' Foreigner ' has inspired me of writing this piece. 

A Beautiful sight, I've seen it once.
In a lonely white room
with a bed and a small chair, 
table on three feet in a corner holding a bouquet
fortifying the air with the scent of roses
window, a small, round window 
in the middle of the pale wall, 
exposing messages from up above
in a form of snowflakes, falling so slowly, 
a white dove sat on the ledge.
A man was fighting for his life
machine pumping air into his lungs
in a constant steady motion.
 ~A beautiful sight 
Angel wings spread across the bed
hovering over the mans body, healing it, 
feeding his soul
with heavenly aroma, 
the smiling Angel kissed his forehead
and told me it will be back tomorrow.

A beautiful sight. 

Suffering is human experience
that comes to all, 
Face it with courage
and stand you tall.

Be like a tree with deep root
that holds the ground, 
against the strong wind
responsible for other's fall.

Be like a desert plant
with thorns outside for survival
being in extreme climate
it grows where others crawl.

Be a fighter and do not give up, 
Circumstances there to make you strong, 
I will reach the place where i belong, 
always sing this beautiful song. 

When the juggler smiled, 
Her tear dropp not responded and kept quiet.
He was angry and scolded; 
'Don't you know how to smile really? '
Then the tear dropp replied; 
'After he left the premises
I have never seen such an innocent smile again.

'Why do you want that we would come? 
Sunny her words upon him, she asked, 
remembering that his/her mother, 
had never told him/her to go off import where with strangers, 
and with far never letting 
'Sunny's' eyes of little brother too go, one or other. 
If you' the come and visit with my small cabin in the wood 
which I can let to you take of milk, 
' said she honest looking a; beautiful woman. ' 
I keep a cow, and I take more milk; 
than I should enjoy or is sold. 
It isn't  far. Come with me, 
and it gave two/their hands leading the children 
off deeply into the woods
each one fair and a pale in each hand, talking. 

I heard the heart of poetry
I was inspired by the curve of space
and by the breath of summer

I found the beautiful woman
in the garden of desire we met
in the still air I awaited her kiss

she gave to me the thunder moon
the soul of the lightning
the esplanade of stardust

and so I write for her a poem
of beauty and passion's embrace
the rose in the setting sun

and so I give to her a token
that she might read my thoughts
and I would win her smile

I heard the heart of poetry
I dreamed of the flash of her eyes
and the breath of a summer night


Corinna, Pride of Drury-Lane,
For whom no Shepherd sighs in vain;
Never did Covent Garden boast
So bright a batter'd, strolling Toast;
No drunken Rake to pick her up,
No Cellar where on Tick to sup;
Returning at the Midnight Hour;
Four Stories climbing to her Bow'r;
Then, seated on a three-legg'd Chair,
Takes off her artificial Hair:     
Now, picking out a Crystal Eye,
She wipes it clean, and lays it by.
Her Eye-Brows from a Mouse's Hide,
Stuck on with Art on either Side,
Pulls off with Care, and first displays 'em, 
Then in a Play-Book smoothly lays 'em.
Now dextrously her Plumpers draws,
That serve to fill her hollow Jaws.
Untwists a Wire; and from her Gums
A Set of Teeth completely comes.
Pulls out the Rags contriv'd to prop
Her flabby Dugs and down they drop.
Unlaces next her Steel-Rib'd Bodice;
Which by the Operator's Skill,     
Press down the Lumps, the Hollows fill,
Up hoes her Hand, and off she slips
The Bolsters that supply her Hips.
With gentlest Touch, she next explores
Her Shankers, Issues, running Sores,
Effects of many a sad Disaster;
And then to each applies a Plaster.
But must, before she goes to Bed,
Rub off the Daubs of White and Red;
And smooth the Furrows in her Front,
With greasy Paper stuck upon't.
She takes a Bolus e'er she sleeps;
And then between two Blankets creeps.
With pains of love tormented lies;
Or if she chance to close her Eyes,
Of Bridewell and the Compter dreams,
And feels the Lash, and faintly screams;
Or, by a faithless Bully drawn,
At some Hedge-Tavern lies in Pawn;
Or to Jamaica seems transported,
Alone, and by no Planter courted;
Or, near Fleet-Ditch's oozy Brinks,
Surrounded with a Hundred Stinks,
Belated, seems on watch to lie,
And snap some Cull passing by;
Or, struck with Fear, her Fancy runs
On Watchmen, Constables and Duns,
From whom she meets with frequent Rubs;
But, never from Religious Clubs;
Whose Favour she is sure to find,
Because she pays them all in Kind.
CORINNA wakes. A dreadful Sight!
Behold the Ruins of the Night!
A wicked Rat her Plaster stole,
Half eat, and dragged it to his Hole.
The Crystal Eye, alas, was miss'd;
And Puss had on her Plumpers piss'd.
A Pigeon pick'd her Issue-Peas;
And Shock her Tresses fill'd with Fleas.
The Nymph, tho' in this mangled Plight,
Must ev'ry Morn her Limbs unite.
But how shall I describe her Arts
To recollect the scatter'd Parts?
Or show the Anguish, Toil, and Pain,
Of gath'ring up herself again?     
The bashful Muse will never bear
In such a Scene to interfere.
Corinna in the Morning dizen'd,
Who sees, will spew; who smells, be poison'd.




I shouldn’t look I shouldn’t touch
But your beauty does entrance
A mind that searches from first glance
To end attraction that cannot start
But it is hard as this beauty is god’s finest art

A perfect beauty from head to feet
Causing me to find the words I should not speak
This picturesque beauty blesses me, with a
Joyful love I did not seek

As honest as reflection be, I know
I must keep this feeling inside of me
For I will fall destructively
Into a pit of tragedy

A beauty bliss that the eye can’t miss
Like the arrow of cupids kiss
But I refrain, and must absorb this painful rain
For I cannot cause others pain

I have given my life to someone
I hold most dear, I could never bring forward
Her innocent tears, for I will love her always
As I have done now for eight whole years


A Beavy of the fair & Gay,
Such as are daily Smoakt in tea,
& toasted over wine,
Vext to be made so long the Jeast
Of tongues & pens, to go in quest
Of reputation Joyn.
To K---d's house they first repair,
But scarce find any footsteps there,
to keep them off cold scent;
Long had she fled his slavery,
Her gallants stabbd him first, & she
Woud bury him in paint.
To O---y's they next advance,
But he was vanishd on a glance
to Make some conquest shott;
One who so many loves as she,
& one who loves fooles company,
Must love for you know what.
Of T---n newes in vain they sought,
Scarce M---ws covets to be thought
So ignorant in dressing;
For scandall had like Cr---fts appeard,
& left the Nymph unlacing.
No longer on your search remain,
For since your labour must be vain,
What need you make it long:
Believe me fairs, that every one
preserves him for her self alone,
Upon her proper tongue. 

I am alone and naked on my bed, 
Waiting for my lover to come in; 
Please come and share my nakedness, 
For all i have is for you.
I love you and you are all over me, 
Please come and share my nakedness; 
Come as a man and never be afraid.
Where is my sweet lover? 
Where are you my only one? 
I love you and i have prepared a bed for us. 

Baby my life is like a bed of thorn
If I had a choice I would not be born.

Oh my love is like a bad heartache
It reminds me always what I lack.

Oh my eyes are like thirsty sand
No one gives me her tender hand.

Oh my nights are full of sleeplessness
Cause my everything is in a mess. 

I lay here 
the bed
tissues by 
my side 

Cannot hide
used tissues 
new tissues 
matters not 
confused inside

My nose is red 
from such 
instead 
my tissues 
by my side

Imagine all 
the trees 
whom cry 
shed there 
bark 
tissue by 
my side

I cried untill 
I could no 
more  

Tissue by 
my side
there is 
nothing 
left inside 
my eyes are 
as jade 
won't fade

So dry

The feeling 
unto my soul 

The well alone 
is full to night 
a tissue by 
my side


A bee
staggers out
    of the peony.




Hovering around the flowers, 
It sucks the juice and converts it
Into honey, 
What a loss! 
And
What a profit

Bees  to  whom  days  are  but  duties
And  what  matters
Only  honey  furnished  interior, 
Hive  they  in a  peaceful  tree  house

Or  city  sick  with  slums  and  human  bombs, 
Like  love  makes  no  distinction
Brews  for  anyone
Even  before  love  knows  it  is  love.

Faithful  to  his  gift  of  silent  service
As  best,  integral  to  grace, 
buzz  far  within  the  pollen
To  the  corner  of  creation

Till  laden  with  what  is  sweet  only
Yet  takes  no  credit
Save  continues  to  hold  and  serve
Something  this  exact,  the  real. 

a beer and a shot
two old men sitting
on the stoop. talking. 

about old times, jobs, 
women, and life
changing the strings

on a battered old Gibson. 
the old dog just happy
to lie at their feet

the sound of bacon frying, 
the clatter of pots and pans
a hawk soaring in circles

over the fields turned brown. 
a couple of songs, 
a few flakes of snow

a beer and a shot, 
as time draws short

A Beggar 
 
This irritating person, one leg shorter
than the other, unwashed and begging.
I feel disgust want him to get lost.
But he is there reminding me of 
past misery, and how bad fortune, ill
health follows me around- 
This sickly idiot, it could be me if I fall
out of the plum tree, so I give him loose 
change to soothe my conscience.
Pity and contempt, a bad mixture. 

She does not beg for peace, 
her needs are much too dear.

A winter wind chills the street, 
the leaves have left the trees.

Her clothes are hopeless rags, 
her ancient eyes are empty.  

She cannot see the sad beauty, 
the ashen sky above the city.

She is blind to the bustling park
beside the ghostly cathedral.

She is blind to the artist's wares
that draw the market crowds.  

She blesses each passing footstep, 
whether for a gift or disregard. 

beg me for life
to the unseen one
beg me for living spirit
to the invisible sight

he gave me coins
in golden lustre
he gave me children
with giggle and twitter

he gave me a mum
who filled life with sun
he gave me a pa
who transformed truths into ribbons

he gave me voice
to cheer up my glooms
he gave me ears
to listen to lovely tunes

he gave me beauty
to admire others
he gave me health
to enjoy full wealth

yet when my mum died
I was left all alone; 
when my loved ones cried
I donno how to cheer them with pride

when I looked into the things
that he gave with abundant wings
i learnt that he reserved the inthings
the bubbling spirit, the dominant zing


This beguile strange woman in her forties and I am sorry that I have heard forties are the naughtiest.
She begs not charity and she has enough money.
Even though the solitude and suffering.
The precious money could help her to replace solace? 
Under the burning Sun and freezing Moon
Still she needs the warmth.
Only an honest human blanket could minimize her nauseous feelings.
Where do they find this pedigree? 
She seeks a pure bred Man in her sojourn
And still she struggles to find the needle in a haystack. 

If you want to see the World
Though I am blind, 
Ready to give my eyes.
If you're hungry
Share my bread crumb.
And if you're thirsty
Please sip my broken tumbler.
If you want a shelter and a warmth
I can move to a side on the road
And in the sleep if you want my heart, 
Please remove that without giving me a slight pain
As I cannot bear this loneliness any further! 

*to the young poetess in Massachusetts Shani Bogamuwa

But one day when somebody offered him a Nasi goreng plate
From an Indonesian Restaurant, 
He said; 'Sorry Sir! It's too heavy and a rich diet it seems
I used to cold stale meals and don't know my kinky bowels
Could face the unexpected challenge? 'The 'happy year' of AN hour from dawn:
The snow sweeps on
As it swept with sleet last night:
The Earth around
Breathes never a sound,
Wrapped in its shroud of white.
A waked cock crows
Under the snows;
Then silence.— After while
The sky grows blue,
And a star looks through
With a kind o' bitter smile.
A whining dog;
An axe on a log,
And a muffled voice that calls:
A cow's long low;
Then footsteps slow
Stamping into the stalls.
A bed of straw
Where the wind blows raw
Through cracks of the stable door:
A child's small cry,
A voice nearby,
That says, 'One mouth the more.'
A different note 
In a man's rough throat 
As he turns at an entering tread —
Satyrs! see! 
'My woman — she 
Was brought last night to bed!' 
A cry of 'Halt!'—
'Ach! ich bin kalt!'
'A spy!'—'No.'—'That is clear!
There's a good shake-down
I' the jail in town —
For her!' —And then, 'My orders here.'
A shot, sharp-rolled
As the clouds unfold:
A scream; and a cry forlorn-
Clothed red with fire,
Like the Heart's Desire,
The babe with light
Is haloed bright,
A cry of woe;
Then footsteps slow,
And the wild guns, far away. 

before the days of yours
and mine
before the sun had ever shined
two winds blew strong
and swept the sky
two wings gave flight to
my demise
the soul of all creation shook
and spread my mother's seed 
that took
the breath of all the stars
in space and carved into
the trees my face
to bear through rain and
cold my name and steal
the blood that I contain
so I may raise the hand
so true to witness empty
seas of blue these wings
that tear through every
dream then give me hope
through brilliant beams
they flap my every step
toward home than shred all
peace till again I roam
alone in every way to lack
yet these wings I bear
upon my back until like petals
they fall to earth and I give 
back life I stole at birth


A Belly Full

cast glee on sleet, huddled in a doorway 
as seeking the fading warmth of people 
in a hurry to get home, an old man sits, 
looks a window display of phony happy 
Santa Clauses. 

Tomorrow they’ll be brought down to 
a dank crypt, oddly smile in darkness 
with rats nesting in their vacant bellies, 
while he- the real one- will carry on as 
the town’s longest living drunk for one 
more year. 

A bespectacled artist called Lear
First perfected this smile in a sneer.
He was clever and witty;
He gave life to this ditty -
That original author called Lear.

I can be quite smart
And I am always clever 
That’s why you’re in my heart 
Always and Forever
Threw the good! 
Wonderful times! 
And then the trouble
And Frustrating Climbs
Over the Hill 
Is half way there
Were not there yet: 
But we don't care! 
As long as we are together
Threw the laughs and the tears 
We will still have fun 
Over these countless years
When we reach to top
Of that hard steep hill! 
We would still be together
When were old and ill 
And when we look back 
To reflect on years 
We will laugh and have fun! 
But we might shed some tears! 
Because we'll be old
And it’s the end of our life
Im not so scared 
Because we've reached high heights 
I want you to know
That i love you so 
Were Best Friends for life 
And that’s what I’ve shown 
This is the best
That I could describe 
You’re my best friend
And i can’t let it hide! 
I love you


Dear Cloe, how blubber'd is that pretty Face? 
Thy cheek all on fire, and thy hair all uncurl'd: 
Pr'ythee quit this caprice; and (as old Falstaf says) 
Let us e'en talk a little like folks of this world. 

How can'st thou presume, thou hast leave to destroy 
The beauties, which Venus but lent to thy keeping? 
Those looks were design'd to inspire love and joy: 
More ord'nary eyes may serve people for weeping. 

To be vexed at a trifle or two that I writ, 
Your judgment at once, and my passion you wrong: 
You take that for fact, which will scarce be found Wit: 
Od's Life! must one swear to the truth of a song? 

What I speak, my fair Cloe, and what I write, shews 
The diff'rence there is betwixt Nature and Art: 
I court others in verse; but I love thee in prose: 
And they have my whimsies; but thou hast my heart. 

The god of us verse-men (you know child) the sun, 
How after his journeys he sets up his rest: 
If at morning o'er earth 'tis his fancy to run; 
At night he reclines on his Thetis's breast. 

So when I am weary'd with wand'ring all day, 
To thee my delight in the evening I come: 
No matter what beauties I saw in my way: 
They were but my visits; but thou art my home. 

Then finish, dear Cloe, this pastoral war; 
And let us like Horace and Lydia agree: 
For thou art a girl as much brighter than her 
As he was a poet sublimer than me. 

When it is summer for you, 
It is then winter on my side; 
So let us find a better date suitable for all of us! 
For this sweet love is all that we have. 

Today's young people want a quick fix
In those drugs and drinks they can get
And so in much trouble they get to mix
With their lives destroyed,  filled with regret.

But another alternative is there for you
It's just waiting for your daily taking
A very good fix it can assure you
And make you productive in your living.

And from it you must not depart
Kept in your life,  it will surely bless
Your soul,  and Peace will fill your heart.

Unload your baggage as it' s getting late
In Life, when you fix your human eyes
You'll run with strength and be very wise.







  Then one rests content, untouched by trouble.'
 
  Proverbs  'He who walks with the wise, grows wise, 
 but a companion of fools suffers harm.'

 Proverbs  -
February Philippines


Slence is the best answer to a fool! 
But think twice when a mad man throws a stone against you; 
For tis world is not as you do see it, 
And it means a lot in many ways.

There is more hatred among people than love, 
But we all have to do our best in putting things right; 
For this world is all that we have as at now, 
And we all need a better footing for doing  the thing. 

they want to
ban books, ban abortions
ban gay marriages 
ban free thinking
and if they could 
ban the poor! 

i have a better idea! 

why dont we
ban wars, ban prejudice
ban offshore drilling
ban the greedy
ban the judgemental
ban ignorance

and just for good measure
ban whaling around the world
for any reason

The more you think about it 
life gets harder everyday. You
strive to do the right thing, but
at times, it can go astray. It's
hard keeping up, with all the
things you want to do. Your
intentions are on the right 
track, but it can run away with
you. Today we live in a world, 
that is materialistic. Everybody, 
strives for more. We've forgotten
about the important things in life
and we have to remember, the
why, the where and the for. Let's 
get back to the reality, of what
life is supposed to be. Then once
again, we can find our way, for a
better life, for you and me

Let us love this world and put it in a better shape than hate, 
Let us share true love with one another to make the world go round; 
For our negative actions will surely lead us to fights and wars, 
But true love from us all will make the world a better place. 

I have no wit, no words, no tears;
My heart within me like a stone
Is numbed too much for hopes or fears.
Look right, look left, I dwell alone;
I lift mine eyes, but dimmed with grief
No everlasting hills I see;
My life is in the falling leaf:

My life is like a faded leaf,
My harvest dwindled to a husk:
Truly my life is void and brief
And tedious in the barren dusk;
My life is like a frozen thing,
No bud nor greenness can I see:
Yet rise it shall--the sap of spring;

My life is like a broken bowl,
A broken bowl that cannot hold
One drop of water for my soul
Or cordial in the searching cold;
Cast in the fire the perished thing;
Melt and remould it, till it be
A royal cup for Him, my King:

A garden of thorns and thistles, 
Someone had ceceicved you my love; 
And flying up high like an eagle to view the world, 
But someone had stolen your love away from me.
I can't trust anyone again in this land of hatred, 
For you came and ate from my tree of love; 
And now you are very worried! 
But there will be a better tomorrow for me. 

You don't believe in anything! 
But with Yahweh, all things are made possible; 
I do believe in Him and i am waiting for a better tomorrow.

It will be, 
It will be done by His Mercy; 
And, i only believe in the Creator who made heave na dn earth.

Do not lose hope in life! 
And, do not give up so easily; 
For, we will all laugh one day, 
Which is called tomorrow.years of hard struggles! 
No success; 
years of hard struggles! 
No success; 
years of hard struggles! 
No success; 
But, still alive and kicking, 
Hoping for a better tomorrow. 

There has to be a better way.
Than endless warring, 
Selfish ways
And committing countless crimes: 
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.

Go look: 
Beyond beyond: 
Infinity eternal, 
Eternal infinity, 
Infinite eternity, 
Eternity infinite.
In all its splendour.

Then see, 
Within yourself: 
I say again: 
Heaven is in us, 
Somewhere.


Holding her sanity within her hands

She clawed upon the ground of life

Remembering the pain and gore of life

She has been tempted to crumble 

At the feet of hatred that follows within her dreams

She claws her way to freedom to a better land of dreams

In the dark asylum of death she as risen from its depth

She makes her way to freedom to radiate new light new hopes new dreams

The tendency to shy away from life's old mysteries 

Often make her pull away from all it as to give

So with tender foot she makes her way 

To a better world of dreams

And invites you all to join her 

To make our dreams come real

And solve all its mysteries

To a better world of Dreams

Though much have I seen
Of a bevy of beauties
In my fascinating kingdom
But in my blissful eyes
Gifted me a real boredom


What has happened? I have wondered and wandered. On the wall
A painting  catches my eye of a place, of an entrance.
I was there. Now out of memory quietly it calls, 
As archetypes will, I suppose, when they are needed, 
When the soul works itself past turmoil and trance, 
When the unresolved takes its spade to the unweeded
Bits and pieces of minds and thoughts and now
And then and perhaps and if and though.

There is a doorway. It is very, very old
And through it tourists wander. They have been told
Of three thousand years. I remember the quiet when the few
Had gone. Now I listen for what I want to know.

The stone is strangely pink, a suggestive hue
Flushing in the middle of the day, and a glow
When night falls. What hovers in the sound of silence? 

There is a path beyond. I pause now as I paused then.
But for what? Something will come. Something will blend
With the clarity- the air is so clear here. Some clue
Must be nearing the archway.  Some dream from the gate
Of horn? Something surprising? Something old, something new? 
Something the archaeologist of minds has found, something I can grow
Into an explanation? So many years pass here and fold
Layer and level of knowing and happening into the mould, 
Into the hot dust: contradiction, shock, disclosure, suddenness-
Long ago now sifted, now dug out into the air, the air that is a caress
On my hot skin, on my hot mind. Airing history. So I sit
And look through the gap, past the crumbling stone
Onto the path of the past and I wait
For the clarity of time to walk along the sand; for the bone
Of event to flesh out; for the layers to become one. 

But minds are not earth. Artefacts are not actions. What is done
Has been done. Why stay here? We are left with ourselves. That wind has blown.
And what is left is better. No need for the spade.  We move on. 

He says what he does not believe in what he says, so                              How does he want me to believe him,                                 He contradicts himself, but                                          I know him only as a big liar,                                      Yes, he is a big liar, then                                        He is labeled with a big liar. 

A thick present is like a book, 
It is opened for the look
And wades in for the kill, 
Plenty of crime is in being ill.
The voluminous writers of poetry
Are again in love with learning labouriously.
They read them with phrases hurting, 
Inside is pleasure of burning
On the right side of humanity, 
But what of you and charity

We all live in the same boat, so                                      We will get the same fear!                                           We all in  great oblivion because                                    We go in the opposite direction, so                                   If a sudden tsunami comes, then                                       It is a big one that will sweep everyone                              And everything, but are you scared

The limit, 
The scene; 
Of a big white spider! 
Moving aorund in your room, 
To say hello to you.
The occasion, 
Of the occasion! 
Like the muse of a lady in red; 
Reasons, 
Seasons, 
Like the muse of a banker by profession! 
Visted by this spider. 

On the snow a big zero

If I could be a kite
Who will trace me from the earth? 
If you could be a kite 
Should I trace you from the earth? 

On the dream a big zero


A bike is just a bike
It can take you for a riding hike
 
A bike is just a bike
With a motorcycle it is a look alike

A bike is just a bike
When you ride it you feel childlike

But there is something I dislike
It is hard to impress and make a good strike
Two wheels and one seat available for hitchhike
Your charming words will have a declined spike
Therefore it is best to leave the bike for the dikes(In memory of Stephen (Reggie)   Pearce
of Kilnsea,  

The wind blows cold through the churchyard trees
and sadly tolls the passing bell
as mourners shuffle up the leaf-strewn
narrow path between the leaning stones.

He was just twenty-five, so young, 
so full of life, and love of life
and laughter — killed outright one night
in a head-on crash on his motorbike.

From far and wide we’ve gathered here
to pay respect to our young friend.
I’ve never seen the church so full, 
oh death, how can you be so cruel? 

 Who will forget this funeral? 
Four hundred strong in the nave we stood, 
family and friends both young and old
and a phalanx of bikers in leathers and boots.

Between the holy platitudes
and hymns they played his favourite songs; 
one had to smile to hear within
that ancient august church of stone

come belting out the vibrant tones
of modern rock and heavy metal.
Who can forget the coffin passing
in procession like a royal barque, 

the biker’s helmet on its lid
resplendent in heraldic tones
— rich gules, azure, argent, or, 
a shining light of knightly splendour? 

Who will forget that send-off from
his fellow bikers when three score
or more bright gleaming motorcycles
with a thunderous roar led off the hearse

Her closed eyes whispered to me 
In that Cajun French accent 
She had perfected; as her 
Rose petal lips wet my appetite, 
I devoured her each and every delicious breath. 
My appetite, not to be denied 
Was thirsty for more and more 
"Baby, I’ve seen it all before" she said, 
As I untied her halter and released
Her perfect breasts to my blind me
Of my prowess


because I know I missed the train and forgotten my ticket
when it has tried to give me a chance
I have become ecstatic and full of light 
ever since destiny came together 
like a puzzle

I had the box and the pieces in my possession
but I guess it took a little bit of time
because I over think 
I over analyze

I have this unbeatable streak
of missing destiny's knock on the door
Well finally I answered and
everything is coming together

No missing pieces no bent 
or child manipulated pieces
Just a brand new box with
the plastic wrapping right next to it
with the steep price tag of years

The pieces are all out
like my exposed heart
Everything is there
Everything is fastened together
Everything is great
I apologize to myself
for wasting so many years
before I found my destiny


A biological father
Had split
From his partner
After his partner gave
Birth to his biological
Child


A bird came down the walk:
He did not know I saw; 
He bit an angle-worm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw.

And then he drank a dew
From a convenient grass,
And then hopped sidewise to the wall
To let a beetle pass.

He glanced with rapid eyes
That hurried all abroad,- 
They looked like frightened beads, I thought; 
He stirred his velvet head

Like one in danger; cautious,
I offered him a crumb,
And he unrolled his feathers
And rowed him softer home

Than oars divide the ocean,
Too silver for a seam,
Or butterflies, off banks of noon,
Leap, splashless, as they swim. 

This rare bird tells of its encounter
When the Telescopic man gossips; 
'I found nothing but emptiness
And I was breathless
Then I *flew downwards.'

* The bird used that instead of declining it seems. 

I sended
All the birds
Away tonight
So they could be free
For once


I started re-reading Kawabata Yasunari san's 'Izu no Odoriko'

I hear a bird is there calling
When the snow was falling
''No one hears our lament
We both wander like a dement 
We've to find a new shelter
Everything is going to alter
It can make your blood freeze
And may lose e'erything in this breeze
You need to hide your fears under a layer
You will get it from your heart's prayer
And stop wander like a strayer''


'Croak, croak, croak,'
Thus the Raven spoke,
Perched on his crooked tree
As hoarse as hoarse could be.
Shun him and fear him,
Lest the Bridegroom hear him;
Scout him and rout him
With his ominous eye about him.

Yet, 'Croak, croak, croak,'
Still tolled from the oak; 
From that fatal black bird,
Whether heard or unheard:
'O ship upon the high seas,
Freighted with lives and spices,
Sink, O ship,' croaked the Raven:
'Let the Bride mount to heaven.'

In a far foreign land,
Upon the wave-edged sand,
Some friends gaze wistfully
Across the glittering sea. 
'If we could clasp our sister,'
Three say, 'now we have missed her!'
'If we could kiss our daughter!'
Two sigh across the water.

Oh, the ship sails fast
With silken flags at the mast,
And the home-wind blows soft;
But a Raven sits aloft,
Chuckling and choking,
Croaking, croaking, croaking:— 
Let the beacon-fire blaze higher;
Bridegroom, watch; the Bride draws nigher.

On a sloped sandy beach,
Which the spring-tide billows reach,
Stand a watchful throng
Who have hoped and waited long:
'Fie on this ship, that tarries
With the priceless freight it carries.
The time seems long and longer:
O languid wind, wax stronger;'— 

Whilst the Raven perched at ease
Still croaks and does not cease,
One monotonous note
Tolled from his iron throat:
'No father, no mother,
But I have a sable brother:
He sees where ocean flows to,
And he knows what he knows, too.'

A day and a night
They kept watch worn and white; 
A night and a day
For the swift ship on its way:
For the Bride and her maidens
—Clear chimes the bridal cadence—
For the tall ship that never
Hove in sight for ever.

On either shore, some
Stand in grief loud or dumb
As the dreadful dread
Grows certain though unsaid. 
For laughter there is weeping,
And waking instead of sleeping,
And a desperate sorrow
Morrow after morrow.

Oh, who knows the truth,
How she perished in her youth,
Pale in her royal crown:
How she went up to glory
From the sea-foam chill and hoary, 
From the sea-depth black and riven
To the calm that is in Heaven?

They went down, all the crew,
The silks and spices too,
The great ones and the small,
One and all, one and all.
Was it through stress of weather,
Quicksands, rocks, or all together?
Only the Raven knows this,
And he will not disclose this.— 

After a day and year
The bridal bells chime clear;
After a year and a day
The Bridegroom is brave and gay:
Love is sound, faith is rotten;
The old Bride is forgotten:—
Two ominous Ravens only
Remember, black and lonely. 

Same date extends over two days
After the moment it dawns in the east
Before it sets in the west; 

Date in the east changes
West still the same date follows; 

Time keeping is
Relative to geographical location
And is not general or common to every where on globe; 

At the Oval, England and Australia play 
Pre-lunch session cricket; 
At the same instant Sri Lanka and New Zealand play
Post-tea session cricket in Sri Lanka
We in various countries view both at different time schedules; 

We must here note that spaceships and space-missions follow
Local times of respective earth stations
As there is no universal time to be kept or being kept

The same instant is not the same time
When we simultaneously observe having bird’s eye view
And our time-keeping has no relevance, use or significance 
Outside our planet earth; 


What is the actual or exact time of an instant? 
Same instant is differently kept in various places on the globe; 
Time-keeping is unique to humans
And is a ritual followed religiously; 

The counting of time is 
Religion-, Culture-, region-specific
Almanacs, calendars, follow respective faiths and traditions;   

What we are measuring when we are keeping time? 

Is it the revolutions of earth round the sun, 
Or, the period since the big-bang took place? 
Are we measuring anything real at all? 

All counting is human creation and invention
Disappears with human civilization

The myth of existence of time
Separate from the process, event, happening, has
Pervaded our psyche; 

Illusion is time’s physical existence
Influencing our lives and activities; 
Non-reality is measured as reality
Non-existing thing is counted and kept ceremoniously
Celebrating events accordingly
Creating our past, present and future
From which whirlpool we come out never; 

Time-keeping is civilized human activity
Imprisoning them in past, present and future; 
And timelessness, 
The state of bliss, peace, silence and unoccupied awareness, 
When the ego, related and other mental activities abstain themselves, 
Is never allowed to be experienced

Time-keeping and adhering to it is stressful and strain-causing activity, 
Transcending time sense is calmness

To wriggle out of this quagmire
Is difficult and confusing; 

Sense and passage of time is absent for infants, kids and other animals; 
Let us be infant- or kid- like sans of ego; 
Of course transcending animal nature but not the instincts; 
 
A bird’s eye view of time-keeping thus
Makes us understand time sense and timelessness;The calls of birds
Of hues varied
lull  all to sleep.

Birds from continents diverse
nest on the Kadamba Trees, 
feed, breed and fly around, 
dip in water, catch fish
and hop to the trees in glee.

O, that sadist hurls a fish above
and takes it back within its bills! 
The world of birds has a lot to teach.
The black, white and grey birds perch side by side.

Birds, plants and animals
give man his essential needs.
But he cuts their throats to fill his bellies.
    ---Early in the morning
Awake in the bed
A bird singing
Happily and hopefully
Sadness gone
Tears left
In the bottom
Of my heart


I sended
All the birds
Away tonight
So they could be free
For once


There's a pain inside my mind
it seems to make my teeth grind
there's a pain inside my chest
it comes at times when i'm most stressed
whats it like? 
well that depends
i guess. 
it feels like being a bird without a nest; 
like having a million friends
but can't call one your best

there's a pain inside my spirit
like missing the sweetest voice
of a loved one, and you can't hear it-
To describe this, I've no vocabulary
or a burden you can't toss

To describe this, I've no vocabulary
its like being lost
broken and bleeding 
and needing
to be grabbed and carried.  
-   March ["Two turtle doves will show thee
Where my cold ashes lie
And sadly murmuring tell thee
How in tears I did die"]― Nikolai Gogol

Tiny featherless bird
You dance near my roost
in the Winter.
I know it's freezing cold outside.
I live here with my watch-keeper
How do I introduce you to her.
Far relative, friend's sister or friend
Or an unknown lost bird
What is the best?

They are called bald eagles, 
As if they lacked hair.
But if eagles had hair, not feathers, 
How would they fly through the air

I sended
All the birds
Away tonight
So they could be free
For onceoh! wake up my lovely princess, 
allow the sun to rise for you, 
and sprinkle its golden rays, 
with all its effulgence in, bright 
golden hue and sparkle! .

let flowers of all hues and colors, 
size, shape, layers and fragrance, 
jasmine, rose, lilies, lotus, dahlia, 
iris, tulips and daffodils vie each 
other to decorate your lovely
hair in plates, layers and multi 
layers, and  let the sheen in your 
eyes brighten up the beauty of 
the jewels and silks you  wear
and let the fragrance of lowers
enhance your mood fly high and
spread joy and happiness for 
you, family and friends and let 
me hold your hands and wish 
a happy and joyful birthday! .
-o-My heart is like a singing bird
Whose nest is in a water'd shoot;
My heart is like an apple-tree
Whose boughs are bent with thickset fruit;
My heart is like a rainbow shell
That paddles in a halcyon sea;
My heart is gladder than all these
Because my love is come to me.

Raise me a dais of silk and down;
Hang it with vair and purple dyes;
Carve it in doves and pomegranates,
And peacocks with a hundred eyes;
Work it in gold and silver grapes,
In leaves and silver fleurs-de-lys;
Because the birthday of my life
Is come, my love is come to me

"Aug

"  

Full moon to-night; and six and twenty years
Since my full moon first broke from angel spheres!
A year of infinite love unwearying ---
No circling seasons, but perennial spring!
A year of triumph trampling through defeat,
The first made holy and the last made sweet
By this same love; a year of wealth and woe,
Joy, poverty, health, sickness --- all one glow
In the pure light that filled our firmament
Of supreme silence and unbarred extent,
One resurrection, one recurrent chord,
One incarnation, one descending dove,
All these being one, and that one being Love!

You sent your spirit into tunes; my soul
Yearned in a thousand melodies to enscroll
Its happiness: I left no flower unplucked
That might have graced your garland. I induct
Tragedy, comedy, farce, fable, song,
Each longing a little, each a little long,
But each aspiring only to express
Your excellence and my unworthiness --- 
Nay! but my worthiness, since I was sense
And spirit too of that same excellence.

So thus we solved the earth's revolving riddle:
I could write verse, and you could play the fiddle,
While, as for love, the sun went through the signs,
And not a star but told him how love twines
A wreath for every decanate, degree,
Minute and second, linked eternally
In chains of flowers that never fading are,
Each one as sempiternal as a star.

Let me go back to your last birthday. Then
I was already your one man of men
Appointed to complete you, and fulfil
From everlasting the eternal will.
We lay within the flood of crimson light
In my own balcony that August night,
And conjuring the aright and the averse
Created yet another universe.

We worked together; dance and rite and spell
Arousing heaven and constraining hell.
We lived together; every hour of rest
Was honied from your tiger-lily breast.
We --- oh what lingering doubt or fear betrayed
My life to fate! --- we parted. Was I afraid?
I was afraid, afraid to live my love,
Afraid you played the serpent, I the dove,
Afraid of what I know not. I am glad 
Of all the shame and wretchedness I had,
Since those six weeks have taught me not to doubt you,
And also that I cannot live without you.

Then I came back to you; black treasons rear
Their heads, blind hates, deaf agonies of fear,
Cruelty, cowardice, falsehood, broken pledges,
The temple soiled with senseless sacrileges,
Sickness and poverty, a thousand evils,
Concerted malice of a million devils; ---
You never swerved; your high-pooped galleon
Went marvellously, majestically on
Full-sailed, while every other braver bark
Drove on the rocks, or foundered in the dark.

Then Easter, and the days of all delight!
While above all, true centre of our world,
True source of light, our great love passion-pearled
Gave all its life and splendour to the sea
Above whose tides stood our stability.

Then sudden and fierce, no monitory moan,
Smote the mad mischief of the great cyclone.
How far below us all its fury rolled!
How vainly sulphur tries to tarnish gold!
We lived together: all its malice meant
Nothing but freedom of a continent!

It was the forest and the river that knew
The fact that one and one do not make two. 
We worked, we walked, we slept, we were at ease,
We cried, we quarrelled; all the rocks and trees
For twenty miles could tell how lovers played,
And we could count a kiss for every glade.
Worry, starvation, illness and distress?
Each moment was a mine of happiness.

Then we grew tired of being country mice,
Came up to Paris, lived our sacrifice
There, giving holy berries to the moon,
July's thanksgiving for the joys of June.

And you are gone away --- and how shall I
Make August sing the raptures of July?
And you are gone away --- what evil star
Makes you so competent and popular?
How have I raised this harpy-hag of Hell's
Malice --- that you are wanted somewhere else?
I wish you were like me a man forbid,
Banned, outcast, nice society well rid
Of the pair of us --- then who would interfere
With us? --- my darling, you would now be here!

But no! we must fight on, win through, succeed,
Earn the grudged praise that never comes to meed,
Lash dogs to kennel, trample snakes, put bit
In the mule-mouths that have such need of it,
Until the world there's so much to forgive in
Becomes a little possible to live in.

Be the true courage; either has its splendour. 
And damn me if I fail you in the fight!
And bless the love of loyal heart to heart!
And bring the vessel of our love to port!

These are my birthday wishes. Dawn's at hand,
And you're an exile in a lonely land.
But what were magic if it could not give
My thought enough vitality to live?
Do not then dream this night has been a loss!
All night I have hung, a god, upon the cross;
All night I have offered incense at the shrine;
All night you have been unutterably mine,
Miner in the memory of the first wild hour
When my rough grasp tore the unwilling flower
From your closed garden, mine in every mood,
In every tense, in every attitude,
In every possibility, still mine
While the sun's pomp and pageant, sign to sign,
Stately proceeded, mine not only so
In the glamour of memory and austral glow
Of ardour, but by image of my brow
Stronger than sense, you are even here and now
Miner, utterly mine, my sister and my wife,
Mother of my children, mistress of my life!

O wild swan winging through the morning mist!
The thousand thousand kisses that we kissed, 
The infinite device our love devised
If by some chance its truth might be surprised,
Are these all past? Are these to come? Believe me,
There is no parting; they can never leave me.
I have built you up into my heart and brain
So fast that we can never part again.
Why should I sing you these fantastic psalms
When all the time I have you in my arms?
Why? 'tis the murmur of our love that swells
Earth's dithyrambs and ocean's oracles.

But this is dawn; my soul shall make its nest
Where your sighs swing from rapture into rest
Love's thurible, your tiger-lily breast. 

How strange it seems, that old age follows youth! 
when all the world seemed one's own, at that time, 
with time enough to seek a higher truth -
who'd guess the stairs so steep, so slow to climb? 

Worn carpets and worn kneecaps are old age
- and yet, a blessed time for life of mind: 
for those who wish, a different sense of wage; 
free-chosen universal work to find; 

and yet more blessed still: that earth-bound soul
to meet and greet, and work its soil and flowers; 
to live with gratitude; and scan the whole
to find that One which proves the whole world ours.

As iron age yields to the gold of truth, 
so our old age may find within, true youth. 

I hear an accordian
playing from up the stairs
on the CD player
I recieved as a birthday present.

I hear the creak
beneith my feet
as I ascend
to the mid-level of our house.

Out on the counter
is cheese
wine
and bread, all french.

On the CD player
is a gleeful piece
that you'd hear
from a parisian cafe.

And there
on the stove
is a big vat of potatoes
showing our true heritage.

This is the part of my family, 
aunt, uncle, mother and me, 
who pretend france
is connected to poland. 

Just past dawn, the sun stands
with its heavy red head
in a black stanchion of trees,
waiting for someone to come
with his bucket
for the foamy white light,
and then a long day in the pasture.
I too spend my days grazing,
feasting on every green moment
till darkness calls,
and with the others
I walk away into the night,
swinging the little tin bell
of my name. 

On a glorious night of winking stars, one spoke in the tongue of the spheres, 
An entire year did play &run, in my veins Spring’s operas, 
Tuned to the strumming orbs, the day of my birth.

Words stretched nonplussed, lost their resolve, taut, almost unheard, 
Like the shifting satin robes of the sun acquired a new meaning at each angle, 
While a cataract found rhythm in the pounding of my heart, 
                                                                      satiated dropped into silence.

Silence echoed between us like the quiet of the canyons, 
Solitude surveyed, despair fled, with it came the condors ease, 
Through the green meadows, the forbearing hills pervaded its subtle pollen, 
Germinating dreams sown, each seedling fresh in its protective reds in anticipation.

The glades, valley and lakes spoke more than what gestures could say, 
In long strolls when an arm girdled me & my world in sway, 
Through fresh baptisms of rustling leaves and star dust, 
Trees stirred in suspense, wind whispered what we dared not.

Reveries wafted and shut the sea, in rose breaths &singing mermaids
With each look rainbows squirted in the rainless skies, time too turned her head, 
Leap-frogged over walls of decorum & played knock- knock on the door, 
Often reciprocated by seeing me home to tuck me in bed with lore.

When his hands clasped my fears, my life I could bargain, as my world spun, 
Promises and vows I preserved, wrapped around my fingers, like his curls undone, 
Like the first ray of the morn that rushes to caress the top of the trees
I wait each day, saving memories in peril on the sea, with a hush carried in the breeze.

Promises hurl like the dart of an apple, unwind a love knit in many a year, 
Every morn brought a new risk, a new revelation, as I send to chase a joy and a cheer, 
 Till you may be stooped and grey-haired & me- hunch back of Notre dame 
Anguish shall take a back seat and wonder who stopped the rain.


Here's to your health and bottomsup, more than the thirst & delight they stir up.
Let gather all the good angels who protect and we worship, here's the cake with a cherry dollop, 
If a wish I could cast in a blinding spell, makes me now beg for a sequel.


h September-awn break gently across the glen, 
That those, to whom you make a difference, may be born again, 
Mists make way, run, 
A brand new day tied with all my hopes comes undone, 
Trees bow not any lower, 
Up you sway with the life of all things fluttering at the core, 
Bloom little flower pour from your golden chalice, 
Let your perfumes kindle a memory in the one across the seas, 
Sing on sweet bird, not of the humdrum, 
Bubble with songs of sweet hope and good things to come, 
Winds keep your shrieks low, stir not the old woe, 
That let the past night’s darkness swallow, 
Curl on new leaf, this day you embrace, 
Let him add abundance to our grace, 
Hills- shield him with my prayers, majestically tower, 
In thy shadows lie my dreams waiting to soar, 
Buzz a tune bumble bee, 
That reminds him of our promises at least once, daily
Clouds gather your skirts, head away, 
One who sets my face beaming it's his birthday.
Let the skies shine through

A day of colors unfold its hued light, 
Let its loveliness in your perfection stand out doubly bright, 
Celestial spheres disclose the truth of the ages, 
That in absence, letters mingle souls than kisses.
What if the roads are not trodden by our mutual feet? 
In the dumb throng of men and women, 
Only your face projects, only you I greet, 
Let this dawn light my life and I shall call it fair, 
To know of yearning and strange despair, 
To stretch our yearning hands to gain, 
Love’s tide shall come again. 

For ever wave, for ever float and shine
Before my yearning eyes, oh! dream of mine
Wherein I dreamed that time was like a vine,

A creeping rose, that clomb a height of dread
Out of the sea of Birth, all filled with dead,
Up to the brilliant cloud of Death o'erhead.

This vine bore many blossoms, which were years.
Their petals, red with joy, or bleached by tears,
Waved to and fro i' the winds of hopes and fears.

Here all men clung, each hanging by his spray.
Anon, one dropped; his neighbor 'gan to pray;
And so they clung and dropped and prayed, alway.

But I did mark one lately-opened bloom,
Wherefrom arose a visible perfume
That wrapped me in a cloud of dainty gloom.

And rose -- an odor by a spirit haunted --
And drew me upward with a speed enchanted,
Swift floating, by wild sea or sky undaunted,

Straight through the cloud of death, where men are free.
I gained a height, and stayed and bent my knee.
Then glowed my cloud, and broke and unveiled thee.

"O flower-born and flower-souled!" I said,
"Be the year-bloom that breathed thee ever red,
Nor wither, yellow, down among the dead.

"May all that cling to sprays of time, like me,
Be sweetly wafted over sky and sea
By rose-breaths shrining maidens like to thee!"

Then while we sat upon the height afar
Came twilight, like a lover late from war,
With soft winds fluting to his evening star.

And the shy stars grew bold and scattered gold,
And chanting voices ancient secrets told,
And an acclaim of angels earthward rolled. 

TO J. F. CLARKE

WHO is the shepherd sent to lead,
Through pastures green, the Master's sheep?
What guileless 'Israelite indeed'
The folded flock may watch and keep?

He who with manliest spirit joins
The heart of gentlest human mould,
With burning light and girded loins,
To guide the flock, or watch the fold;

True to all Truth the world denies,
Not tongue-tied for its gilded sin;
Not always right in all men's eyes,
But faithful to the light within;

Who asks no meed of earthly fame,
Who knows no earthly master's call,
Who hopes for man, through guilt and shame,

Who makes another's grief his own,
Whose smile lends joy a double cheer;
Where lives the saint, if such be known?--
Speak softly,--such an one is here!

O faithful shepherd! thou hast borne
The heat and burden of the clay;
Yet, o'er thee, bright with beams unshorn,
The sun still shows thine onward way.

To thee our fragrant love we bring,
In buds that April half displays,
Sweet first-born angels of the spring,
Caught in their opening hymn of praise.

What though our faltering accents fail,
Our captives know their message well,
Our words unbreathed their lips exhale,
And sigh more love than ours can tell.

April   

We who proud belong
Among the countrysiders
Reckon we all see
Such wonderful
Complexity of life.

Far from city lights, 
We witness every gleaming
Sunbeam strike new growth
In sacred things
That spawn in grassy streams.

Scent of early dew
We smell in earthy springtime.
Sights of nature's prize
Buzzards, winging
Skywards fill our eyes.

Cygnets magic change
Over time from brown to white.
Dark flocks of starlings
Noisy roost, but
Delight us every nightime.

We want no changes.
Rivers run and must reach sea
From moorland heights, walking
Tall by birthright, 
Our heritage is free.(For the girls)     -  Scene -  Bedroom.

Who wants hot-rocking
Kits-off, full frontal
Chipperdancing  ravers
When I got you babe? 
Just looking! 

Do I want knicker-waving
Lead-pumping prancers, 
Toothy-grinning shimmyers, 
Cheeky-faced paraders
When I got you babe? 
Who's  looking! 

Must I have sexy singing
Leg-flinging swingers, 
Botty-bumping antics
From wide-eyed romantics
When I got you babe? 
Not looking! 

To me my handsome honey-bun
You're all of them rolled into one.

We met her on the hillside green
Below old Castle Blarney;
Her name, she whispered, was Eileen,
Her home it was Killarney.

I see her yet, her Irish eyes
Blue gray as seas in summer,
And hear her welcome, on this wise,
Vouchsafed to each new-comer:

'I'll guide ye up the stairway steep,
And naught will ye be missing
O' battlement or donjon keep,
Or blarney stone for kissing.

'The tower that was Mc


Carthy's pride,
The scene o' battles thrilling,
And where the Desmond kept his bride-
Me fee is but a shilling.

'Here's for ye, now, a keepsake charm'-
Her low tones grow caressing-
'A bit o' shamrock green and warm,
To bring ye luck and blessing.'

The 'keepsake charm'-I have it yet-
A thing of guile and blarney;
Each green leaf dares me to forget
Fair Eileen o' Killarney. 

One tree, storm-twisted, like an evil hag,
The sea-wind in its hair, beside a path
Waves frantic arms, as if in wild-witch wrath
At all the world. Gigantic, grey as slag,
Great boulders shoulder through the hills, or crag
The coast with danger, monster-like, that lifts
Huge granite, round which wheel the gulls and swifts,
And at whose base the rotting sea-weeds drag.
Inward the hills are wooded; valley-cleft;
Tangled with berries; vistaed dark with pines;
At whose far end, as 'twere within a frame,
Some trail of water that the ocean left
Gleams like a painting where one white sail shines,
Lit with the sunset's poppy-coloured flame.

Bald people

At the moon

You will shatter 
A beautiful image 
And ask 
What the hell did 
I do this for? 

Motherhood

Even if female 
Crocodiles 
Are good mother 
It doesn´t make them
More cuddly


Knives rip, 
unwilling wrists. 
As tongues touch 
blades love. 
As you solemnly bleed, 
Crimson pours from sadistic veins. 
Only wishing for
the perfect death.
The bloodiest. 
The one that will hurt the most. 

I have reaped a bitter harvest
I have sowed seeds that are sad
I have balanced all my wealth in life
Against the things i had
My children are away from me
My father has just died
My heart it is a'weaping
And my soul feels crucified
Each grain in that balance
Is much heavier than lead
My eyes are aged - my feelings flayed
My joy it is now dead
Oh why should all this happen? 
Oh what does all this mean? 
My longing for connection
Not the space that lies between.[This is the forest primeval. 

The murmuring pines and the hemlocks, 
Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,

Cheap Restaurants
and mouth watering dishes.
Along the cobbled streets
Call girls whistle folk songs.
Shoeshine barefooted orphan boy
who polishes your shoes, 
If you have a thorough look
There reflects your beautiful face? 
And after the strenuous work
When Sun goes down
The boy too heads for a restaurant
with a candy for his little sister
who's a dishwasher there
from morning till evening.
And they dream together
in a street corner.
A stray dog their pet
under the Moonlit night
guards them from thieves?

I signed the back of a lottery ticket, filled the name and address clearly.
The night is sleeping but still I am awake in a Gas station to fulfill  the boisterous vehicles.
I hear a whisper in my decaying wallet.
'Hey! Dear this is not the winning ticket exactly but a day would be appeared and bring you the lucky chance soon.' The lottery muttered.
After a lazy yawn I speak to myself; 
'Nowadays the papers talk much while the poor people shut their mouths as nothing to put in for digest.'

* To Gheorghe Zamfir! 
Your divine magical pan flute's notes impress me how to grab the fleeing life

How could I ever return? 
When leaving put the past behind me? 
Some kind of love I have no use for, 
It would be like searching
In pockets that are empty! 

Peering into the one-way
Glass limousines
And I hope to see someone
That I easily recognize, 
While simultaneously
Is shaking coins in a cup
And telling me he is hungry, 
How can I be stretched out
Between two such worlds? 
On the borderline of each
And under the microscope
Of publicity
And also the indifference of police! 
Do those who have succeeded before me
Knew to abuse the bondage of poverty? 
The freezing action of debt and terror
Is still better than owning personal favor-
Too long out work-
Where is the cure
For the destruction of pride? 
After it is turned inside out, 
It becomes a character flaw
And everybody tries to hide
What they presume
To be humiliating
But it is just the prejudice
That makes it unbearable! 

When you wake up in the morning, 
Thinking about what you have to do
Or what you ought to be doing, 
You can never really grasp
What has passed
In the hours spent revitalizing
The sub-conscious memory
And though you take substance
From the World you know, 
This is not what
Really refreshes you!

The life will remain the same, 
You will remain the same, 
They will remain the same, 
The world will remain the same 
With all its beauty and grandeur, 
The moon will shine brilliantly, 
The stars will twinkle 
With all their splendour, 
The nightingales will sing in the garden, 
The flowers will scatter their beauty all around, 
Nature will spread Her skirt for Her nurselings, 
Their joy will know no bound, 
But ah! 
I will not be there
To share this joy. 

I’m cornered by lightning
So frightening! I’m shaking, 
Just waking from afternoon napping.
Still mapping, still seeing them clapping-
But flashing and bashing
Of bold bouncing bolts of burden; 

Sighs within the skies
Drumming loudly, telling lies! 
Can no one, anyone 
Under a shaded sun
Stop this rattling rogue thunder? 

DUDDUMM


DUDDUMM-DUMM! ! ! 

Cracking like corn in the fire, 
But much, much higher
Than rolls of smoke; 
Then smashing the air
With hostile whipping, whipping and weeping

Oh here comes the rain! ! ! 

Sweet as the melting flowers
Of moonlight in broad daylight.
Warm with winter’s absence, 
Each drop; is incense
To the soul and essence
Of the mother tongue of earth.

Sweet tasting, tender touch
From volatile valleys across the sky

Let the rain come! ! ! 

Let it fill the dams
And dusty streams
No more sunny themes
But later, for the sun it seems.

Let it cover the oceans
And rivers; with shivers
Running wild! ! ! 
Let it melt the sorrows of my child.

Early one morning -high in the Alp mountains 
A farmer decided to go to market and sell his cows
Mooing critters walked up a ramp to the bed of his truck 
The guarded crib had very limited space to carouse

As the farmer drove cautiously around each bend 
And curve- down the treacherous steep decline
He spied an old piano abandoned by the roadside 
The frugal man hoisted his find just behind the bovine 

The hour progressed and soon a town was seen
Tiny houses were nestled among the green pine trees
Soon, the farmer thought he would  return home
Pockets filled with money- happily playing piano keys

Within a frightful moment speed began to increase
An application of the brake did not slow acceleration
The thrill of the jarring ride caused a clamoring utterance
Thrashing tails pounded ivory and black with locomotion

The sound of the unprecedented impromptu tune
Brought the villagers from their houses into the street
The bawling ballad came nearer- the source was revealed
People stared in disbelief -then ran to avoid becoming meat

As the vocal musicians rode to the end of town-into a lake 
Their echoing song gave its last refrain-it lacked harmony 
Sinking and fading beneath the gurgles and rising bubbles-
Now when whirling winds blow- waves stir a phantom melody 

xposure! 
A black box; 
To pay close attention to it, 
Understanding the ways of the truth, 
And, to humble yourself with the works of the truth. 

A Black cat roamed alone

It sneaked vigilantly along my evergreen hedge.

White snow blanketed everywhere
.
This snow came a week earlier from Iola storm.

This cat printed its lonely footprints on white snow.

By the trail of its footprints I could guess where it has gone.

This cat was single and young.

I wondered if the cat lost its parent or it just moved out

This winter has been very cold, has the cat slept by itself? 
 
Has the cat found a bush for protection from winter gusts? 

Has the cat rested its head near someone's house? 

With the depth of the snow of one half foot

Where could the cat go to get its food? 

This cat has been drinking water from my Koi pond.

Recently, my wife began giving this cat seasonal help with cat food.

It has been several days since I saw this cat the last time.

I wonder if this cat is still alive.



It was a black colour and, 
That was my first love! 
But innovations and creativity are the virtues of Art.
You will see me as i am and, 
You will see him as he is; 
You will see them as they are and, 
You will see her as she is; 
But innovations and creativity are the virtues of Art. 

Riding around, trying to lose myself in another dimension, 
failing hopelessly, driving late into the night.

With no destination, no one to talk with, trying desperately
to hold on to nothing.

Reality is at every turn, trying to make me face the black
emptiness surrounding my being, but I refuse.

Staying awake, not wanting to fall asleep, afraid of drowning
in nightmares that run very deep during sleep.

Looking, always looking, for something to hang on to, there
is nothing anywhere in sight, and I continue to crash and 
fall, night after night.

Where is the hope I used to have?  Where is the faith?  Where
living?  Why?  What is the sense?  What is the meaning? 

How come I have to suffer this emptiness all alone?  Why can't
suffering like this? 

My love ran deep, it came back up through my soul, it is being
pulled from me, yet, I will not let it go.

The meaning of life lies buried in all of this meaningless
death, but I have found none yet! 

Having found no meaning for life to go on, maybe it must just
stop. 

Dull as I was, to think that a court fly
            Presum'd so neer her eye;
            When 'twas th' industrious bee
        Mistook her glorious face for paradise,
To summe up all his chymistry of spice;
  With a brave pride and honour led,
  Neer both her suns he makes his bed,
And, though a spark, struggles to rise as red.
            Then aemulates the gay
              Daughter of day;
      Acts the romantick phoenix' fate,
  When now, with all his sweets lay'd out in state,
    LUCASTA scatters but one heat,
And all the aromatick pills do sweat,
And gums calcin'd themselves to powder beat,
          Which a fresh gale of air
          Conveys into her hair;
          Then chaft, he's set on fire,
And in these holy flames doth glad expire;
      And that black marble tablet there
        So neer her either sphere
      Was plac'd; nor foyl, nor ornament,
But the sweet little bee's large monument. 

Red, gold, green and a black star! 
I am the son of Africa to tell you a story; 
But this will be like s dream to you, 
Because not all that glitters is gold! ! 

Inception, 
With love, mercy and peace from me to you; 
But the sinful men and women of this world are like, 
Teachers and pupils in the same classroom! 

Brothers and sisters, 
Times and seasons; 
Men and woman, 
Hopes and dreams; 
Let me comfort you in times of your distress and affliction, 
For a black star is now among the colours. 

Chirping, chattering, whining, yelling, 
sitting up in a tree.

Seeing his black feathers amid the green 
leaves of a tree.

Way up high so as not to be seen - his 
voice carries - his presence is made 
known by him. 

I spied a blackbird with its jaunty hopping gait
Gathering twigs, then stopping, tilting its head
To one side to listen for worms in order to grate.
With its fondness of litter leaf to lay upon its bed.

It lives in the beech tree or wild sycamore
Breaking twigs with its beak which it shreds to the core.
In winter it is beauty to behold, its plumage of black feathers
And orange beak glistening in the snow and all weathers.

Its orange ringed eye is distinctive as is its beak.
It flies through the woods or forest edge with its feathers so sleek.
From the high treetops he springs to the hedgerow where he can be seen standing, 
Or, sometimes glides and flicks its tail upon landing. 

It seems wrong that out of this bird,
Black, bold, a suggestion of dark 
Places about it, there yet should come
Such rich music, as though the notes'
Ore were changed to a rare metal
At one touch of that bright bill.

You have heard it often, alone at your desk
In a green April, your mind drawn
Away from its work by sweet disturbance
Of the mild evening outside your room.

A slow singer, but loading each phrase
With history's overtones, love, joy
And grief learned by his dark tribe
In other orchards and passed on
Instinctively as they are now,
But fresh always with new tears.




Rebellion! 
A blackout; 
Darkness, 
With the weapons of war.

With no peace at all in the making;

a blank book is given

Child of innocence, no history was written
Until they teach the wrong from right

Once innocence goes, you are the author
Someone's brother, sister, son or daughter
Fill up your pages, no exchange for another
No redos of your past engages
It has been set, no extra pages

Reason to fix, life's stories woven. 

A blank page lies on my desk
Clean and pure
It lines crisp and hard
I sit in front of it and take up my weapon, 
my tool, my pen
It touches the blank sheet
I begin the dance of thought in my mind
The blank page
It taunts and teases me
It scares and thrills me
It threatens and entices me
It haunts and frees me
This must be how a painter feels 
about a blank canvas
full of infinite possibilities
and infinite questions
I start
My pen plays across the page 
It flies and leaves its trail of blue ink for others to read
These pages become thought incarnate. 

I turned on my computer today
And
My mind is blank
I look into a blank screen
But
Can’t think of what to write
Time is passing by 
And I haven’t written anything yet
I can’t blame it on myself 
Because 
My mind is somewhere else

Silencing the energy inside, waiting to explore denizens brought to the foreground.
Standing away from the edge of a maze, trying not to divulge the way out, yet looking off to the side, wondering what to do on another period of stagnation.
Bringing ties of yesterday into a loom, weaving them all into a blanket that I can be hidden beneath. 

As children we'd play, 
On a hot Summer day, 
Loving life as we did back then, 
We'd stay out for hours, 
And pick pretty flowers, 
Set up home in a makeshift den.
Back then life was good, 
We'd run through the wood, 
Where we'd play hide and seek in the trees, 
Then home for a bath, 
Oh what a great laugh! 
Sporting a set of black knees! 
No laptop to own, 
And no mobile phone, 
Enjoyment was easy and free, 
Up like a lark, 
We'd head to the park, 
A place where we loved to be.
Those were the days! 
In so many ways, 
We then knew the meaning of fun, 
A blast in the past, 
Good things never last, 
Those days that we played in the sun.

A pleasant party of exuberant joy, knowing our time is well-spent for the children. 

Our lives can be a blessing. As we love and help each other. And walk closely side by side. And a blessing to our friends. Our lives are a blessing to our friends. And those who lives we changed.

Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass.
And the eyes of those two Indian ponies
Darken with kindness.
They have come gladly out of the willows
To welcome my friend and me.
We step over the barbed wire into the pasture
Where they have been grazing all day, alone.
They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness
That we have come.
They bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.
There is no loneliness like theirs.
At home once more, they begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.
I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,
For she has walked over to me
And nuzzled my left hand.
She is black and white,
Her mane falls wild on her forehead,
And the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear
That is delicate as the skin over a girl's wrist.
Suddenly I realize
That if I stepped out of my body I would break
Into blossom. 

The Mother's heart, the hero's will, 
The softest flowers' sweetest feel; 

The charm and force that ever sway
The altar-fire's flaming play; 

The strength that leads, in love obeys;

Eternal faith in Self, in all, 
The light Divine in great, in small;

A  deaf  world's  door
To  go  out  of  this  life-
Conscious  how  immense
Is  oneself  without  walls. 

I should have seen the signs -
Your need to control all things
Your ego running rampant
You're such an important figure
At least in your own mind; 

I thought that I could change you -
Silly me! 
Patterns ingrained from long ago
Can only be changed if you desire
What I want is not an option; 

You say it's not important
We can rise above these things
The words come easily from your lips
Yet  still your body betrays you
And I am under your spell; 

No more!  Time erases tenderness
Given with a willing heart
Accepted by a greedy lover
Then discarded without a care -
Passion wasted; 

Another conquest on your list
How easily they come to you
Brave hearts about to be broken
Still they take the chance
And suffer their demise; 

And you remain unscathed
Your ego takes it all in stride
Such petty complications
Yet one day they will take you down
And maybe I will smile; 

I should have seen the signs.

 have a blind Friend
He's called Ronny
Ron's very Clever
We play Backgammon 
Together, amongst
Other things
But I am Worried! 
Every time I say Goodbye
I say: 'See ya Later', Ron
Some how I do not Think, 
These are the 'right' words? 
Maybe something Like, 
I'll Smell you later or, 
I'll Feel, Taste or Touch you Later

 every first line is a question from a blind girl
 her lover boy answers them]


is it night or day
are you the sun or moon

is this a garden or a palace
are you a flower or painting

is the parrot the most beautiful here
you are the most beautiful here

are the clouds and lightning not closer to us
are you not aware of the string of flowers
laid in your lovely logs of hair

is this world a place very big
no.. 

our love is much bigger[Experience is the name so many people give to their mistakes.]-Oscar Wilde

I cannot see your colour
but they say you're a beautiful flower.
I sniff your fragrance and I feel
the softness of your petals.
If that softness and fragrance together
you could keep forever? 
Then I could have taken you
into my heart-vase dear
and I pour my tears ever! 

to my friend Paddy Martin, 
here started raining and a big hail last evening
hope quiet there everything

The miracle of the blind is himself-
there's no outside. 

his blindness transcends
the route the eyes seek and he travels inside.
the inner spark grows brighter as darker
becomes the exterior and shows him the way  home
no matter he gropes outside-
where no one owns anything
where there's no walls raised by sceptre and mitre
where arms race only to hug each other. 

Wordlessly collapsing against blank walls, images 
come to life instantly in a blink of the mind.

Becoming the creative force of writing incessantly, 
without any blocks or barriers to mar the way.

Totally engrossed, enraptured by the immensity of 
creative thought, dallying daily in it's peaceful
surroundings.

Coming to life interiorly, blending with my spirit
in fountains of blossoming words, becoming what I 
see in words and meanings, for moments in time.

Allowing myself freedom to exist and be, afraid of 
nothing, fulfilling inner spirits with contemplative 

Lying spiritually in His arms forever, using gifts
He has given me from the moment of conception.

Writing as I fulfill the purpose He has given me to
share with this world until I meet Him in the next. 

Before me lies a mass of shapeless days,
Unseparated atoms, and I must
Sort them apart and live them. Sifted dust
Covers the formless heap. Reprieves, delays,
There are none, ever. As a monk who prays
The sliding beads asunder, so I thrust
Each tasteless particle aside, and just
Begin again the task which never stays.
And I have known a glory of great suns,
When days flashed by, pulsing with joy and fire!
Drunk bubbled wine in goblets of desire,
And felt the whipped blood laughing as it runs!
Spilt is that liquor, my too hasty hand
Threw down the cup, and did not understand. 


In Thy million creations "blog" gets Thy nod! 

Let me be a blogger and sure not a blaggard  

Pen is mightier than sword not to go wayward! 

 

Freedom of expression never to be misused

Blogger’s honest followers not to be mislead

I write what I want and know- none to edit sure

No censor; my blogging must be noble and pure! 

 

Matters in millions; subjects are aplenty

Great knowledge and nice language are in my kitty

To be used with sense of responsibility


 

Bless me with that control, - thoughts not to run riots

Thoughts meant to make noble, inspire and elevate  

The society of which I am part and parcel

May my Blog bring peace, joy, food for thought a morsel! 

 

 



I looked and saw a bloody stain as if it came from me
It was thick and red and seemed to ooze out from my own belly
Then another spot upon one leg and another on my chest
I was climbing up a stairway and just couldn’t find my breath
The red! The red was all around and had me slipping on the stairs
And now it felt like raining and was running down my hair
I then looked up and then I saw the strangest sight I’d seen
Blood droplets on the ceiling falling in a steady stream
I knew it could not be my blood but it was raining down so fast
Not gentle like the rain itself but sticky and – aghast -
I saw a sluice of redness come sweeping down on me
And then I turned a corner and that blood was blinding me
I was swimming in some entrails that I could not even name
It was like being in a butcher’s or in some suicidal game
I then stood straight and shouted – I shouted right out loud
‘I will not retreat just for fear for I am strong and proud’
I no longer climbed all frightened – an answer I did crave
And at that the top of those red steps I did find my mother’s grave
Beelzebub looked in the mirror and then he turned a page
He was now fearful for himself and of my incessant rage
I slayed him on those foot steps so he couldn’t rise at all
And with his death all of that blood did vanish from the floor. 

A blossom in springtime, 
A leaf in the fall.
Yes, these are the treasures
I like most of all.

But though these are treasures
I so like to see.
There's nothing more precious
Than you are to me.

For nothing is softer
Than your gentle skin.
The leaves and the blossoms
Just cannot contend.

Your hair is more golden
Than any fall day.
And your cheeks are redder
Than blossoms in May.

But mainly the reason 
I hold you so dear.
Your beauty is present
At all times of year.

A blossom in springtime, 
A leaf in the fall.
Yes, you are the one dear
I like most of all. 

Feeling full of immeasurable dreams
Desiring to burst forth with unfolding hues
Opening with the natural ease of a sigh 
Blessed with a spattering of morning dew

Petals instinctively absorb rays of warmth 
Releasing a heavenly fragrance so freely 
Intoxicating all who inhale as they pass by
Holding a matchless moment- demurely 

Admiring eyes drink in your amazing beauty
As a stride slows and comes to a standstill 
Your charm prevents time from going forward
Attaching to a heart that is lastingly fulfilled

acing into melodies, playing all the rhythms flowing
into my mind, taking me to avenues of being and recall.

A wonderful feeling and sensation, taking it all into
the deep passion I have within for poetry.

Lilting and elating, music enlivening my spirit and
elevating inner intellect.

Opening up like a blossoming rose to the world, holding
on to all the aromas and senses being formed.  

Listening and watching everything around as it falls 
here in photographic pictures on screens forever. 

One two three
The third blow
And a fatal blow
Blew my soul 
Into the dark room
Where i lie motionless 
Speechless
With a body heartless.

A premeditated blow it was
Came like a storm
Hit me right 
In the centre of my heart
Tarnishing even the tiniest 
Tissues and cells.

Ironical it is! 
This fatal blow 
Has come from
The pleasant breeze
Of my life. 

A blue coat is guided guided away, guided and guided away, that is the particular color that is used for that length and not any width not even more than a shadow. 

A tale of two weddings 
wonderfully writ, 
weddings have so many 
secret tales to tell, 

the tale of love unrequited
not reciprocated, 
is a bitter low blow to groin
to grievous heart, 

to watch another happily marry
long soul sought lover, 
is nail driven into coffin bound heart
wedding couple merrily, 

depart on romantic honeymoon for two
one left unloved can only rue, 
hand of fate remorse grown dark of late
feelings grown blooming blue.

nimal dunuhinga(For Aline) 

Monsignore,
    Right Reverend Bishop Valentinus,
Sometime of Interamna, which is called Ferni,
Now of the delightful Court of Heaven,
I respectfully salute you,
I genuflect
And I kiss your episcopal ring. 

It is not, Monsignore,
The fragrant memory of your holy life,
Nor that of your shining and joyous martyrdom,
Which causes me now to address you.
But since this is your august festival, Monsignore,
It seems appropriate to me to state
According to a venerable and agreeable custom,
That I love a beautiful lady.
Her eyes, Monsignore,
Are so blue that they put lovely little blue reflections
On everything that she looks at,
Such as a wall
Or the moon
Or my heart.
It is like the light coming through blue stained glass,
Yet not quite like it,
For the blueness is not transparent,
Only translucent.
Her soul's light shines through,
But her soul cannot be seen.
It is something elusive, whimsical, tender, wanton, infantile, wise
And noble.
She wears, Monsignore, a blue garment,
Made in the manner of the Japanese.
It is very blue --
I think that her eyes have made it more blue,
Sweetly staining it
As the pressure of her body has graciously given it form.
Loving her, Monsignore,
I love all her attributes;
But I believe
That even if I did not love her
I would love the blueness of her eyes,
And her blue garment, made in the manner of the Japanese. 

Monsignore,
I have never before troubled you with a request.
The saints whose ears I chiefly worry with my pleas
  are the most exquisite and maternal Brigid,
Gallant Saint Stephen, who puts fire in my blood,
And your brother bishop, my patron,
The generous and jovial Saint Nicholas of Bari.
But, of your courtesy, Monsignore,
Do me this favour:
When you this morning make your way
To the Ivory Throne that bursts into bloom with roses
  because of her who sits upon it,
When you come to pay your devoir to Our Lady,
I beg you, say to her:
"Madame, a poor poet, one of your singing servants yet on earth,
Has asked me to say that at this moment he is especially grateful to you
For wearing a blue gown

"photograph this now
because I don’t think it
will last for very
long.

paint this picture with
night and a hint of
gray, 
and hope
that it will stay for
morning.

record this moment 
so I can play it back
tomorrow 
when everything
goes back to how
it was.

and now
do not wish upon
my 
star 
unless you wish
to become it. 

We are not seeing each other
but we exchange what they call poetry.
Madam you are far beyond the vicinity.
I am an old bachelor stick around
longing for something which I cannot express.
We are only two parallel lines
in the song of love.

Of sweet emotions

Or misconstrued

O beautiful 
was the werewolf 
in his evil forest. 
We took him 
to the carnival 
and he started 
crying 
when he saw 
the Ferris wheel. 
Electric 
green and red tears 
flowed down 
his furry cheeks. 
He looked 
like a boat 
out on the dark 
water. 

A BOAT beneath a sunny sky,
  Lingering onward dreamily
  In an evening of July --
  Children three that nestle near,
  Eager eye and willing ear,
  Pleased a simple tale to hear --
  Long has paled that sunny sky:
  Echoes fade and memories die:
  Autumn frosts have slain July.
 Still she haunts me, phantomwise,
 Alice moving under skies
 Never seen by waking eyes.
 Children yet, the tale to hear,
 Eager eye and willing ear,
 Lovingly shall nestle near.
 In a Wonderland they lie,
 Dreaming as the days go by,
 Dreaming as the summers die:
 Ever drifting down the stream --
 Lingering in the golden dream --
 Life, what is it but a dream?

THE 
Sanctified be I
though a mere vase dripping away, 
a lewd shed where beasts lie together-
as the best vehicle on the globe
to ferry such a sublime Grace as you, LIFE
and the seed of your race
on earth  and underground. 

I'm tomorrow's
corpse in today's body, converted from soil
into human shape whose capital motive
is not to look young for ever
but to live the dream of the real. 

Sitting quietly at a table in a corner bar
With his pride tarnished and a heart broken, 
His mind seems to be gone away very far
But he is ready to release his words unspoken. 

Covered by cigarette smokes in the air, 
While a piano is being played in the background, 
He lifts up his face full of tears. 
Starting to write words without sounds. 

He asks for a soft drink to the barmaid, 
And concentrated writing a new poem
He realizes that for his wound, there's no band-aid
Since his life has taken a new form. 

Suddenly, a flower girl stops by
Asking him to buy some flower
He felt like a bird that can no longer fly
One with broken wings and no power. 

That bird was really me, indeed! 


Sliced tomato, onion and a pickle too 
A sandwich of chicken or turkey is nice 
So many choices that we can pursue 

A BBQ sandwich makes my mouth water 
So spicy but never too hot 
A meatloaf sandwich is delicious as well 
With sweet tea it just plain hits the spot 

Roast beef or ham always tastes so right 
Chopped liver – well, I’m not quite sure 
But brisket sounds perfect for me 
If I’m hungry it is really the cure 

But some folks love a bologna sandwich 
With white bread and a slather of mayo 
Some top it with a slice of cheese 
It’s so quick if you’re on the go 

But I knew a guy who put the bologna 
In the microwave way too long 
Tough as shoe leather it was, oh my 
On a menu it just wouldn’t belong 

Sandwiches or burgers are a lunch delight 
On the menu they light up the day 
But the bologna sandwich goes way back 
If you join me we will order one without delay

Ah, this life, a bonded labour! 
Bogged down by this deadly employer.
I am buried in my sweaty bones day and night
Alas! When will there be a relief from the plight? 

My voice stilled in fear of whip.
I am helpless and silently weep.
Left emaciated with stale food
I bear the whip of this stone-heart so rude

Engaged as maid being teenaged girl, 
With a smiling face I am to serve all
No sympathy from anywhere for this orphan, 
Don't know when will be the salvation.

Dear mom, I am alone on this earth, 
Why did you sell me after my birth? 
For whom I am to suffer this tyranny
My employer, mom you or my destiny

He's a Romantic-
in love with his
own spontaneous
vivacity and creativity
in his mind
he convienced himself
he loves you with
such reverance

You trust him
think he is a good 
and beautiful man
believe he is someone
you know very well
and he knows you
inside and out-
He knows you alright! 

He knew exactly how
to fool you
professing 
that without you
there is no life
only existance
playing you
and your heart-strings
until you are opened
touching every fiber
to hum quivering
vulnerable, aching
in trust and blind love
until he's drained 
himself of you

He leaves 
you scared
as deep as
any scar can go
then doesn't know
what's wrong with you
or want to know
or understand
why you are so
enraged and hurt
and acting like 
a lunatic, because
he doesn't care
and never did! 
He had his fun
now, he's done

He loves you
when he loved you
and when he's done
he doesn't remember
who you are 
or what he said
just tells you
he's someone
who loves deeply. 

There is no frigate like a book
To take us lands away,
Nor any coursers like a page
Of prancing poetry.
This traverse may the poorest take
Without oppress of toll;
How frugal is the chariot
That bears a human soul

Shining spring comes through the fallen leaves
And the willy-nilly flowers bloom merrily.
Famous birds sing and the deep rivers flow quietly.
The tricky life begins again and I write on the shifting sands; 
'My carefree hidden wise Master, please do not pull this miraculous season away until I finish the tiresome journey.'

Newman


What  grows on its own within my breast, 
That in truth's alone real- 
The quintessence of sweetness, 
Of which man has its human counterpart
That could however be sapped  bitter by desire.
We are both caged alike in eternal bounds, 
Albeit he in the vastness of space's stern decree
And I in the shutness of cane-case, 
Whence we each draw in each movement
Of the sphere, 
A moment of the Great Sweetness, 
Of which the least bees buzz 
Circumambulating
My site of manifestation
Not as stale ritual of desire but primeval harmony.
Gold has in it no life of the giver
But despite my non form, 
We are always tasting together, man and me. 

Fact: a bright British lad, by name J. 

Crook
has today been extradited to San Diego
under a 'one-way' treaty with the US (yah boo unfair) 
to face fraud charges relating to
a software company

which could make it difficult
for prosecution and defence lawyers
addressing him formally
in their different ways

   Here's a good place at the corner--I must stand and see the show.

   Clear the way there, Jonathan!
   Way for the President's marshal! Way for the government cannon!
   Way for the Federal foot and dragoons--and the apparitions copiously
         tumbling.

   I love to look on the stars and stripes--I hope the fifes will play
         Yankee Doodle.

   How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops!
   Every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town.

   A fog follows--antiques of the same come limping,
   Some appear wooden-legged, and some appear bandaged and bloodless. Why this is indeed a show! It has called the dead out of the earth!
   The old grave-yards of the hills have hurried to see!
   Phantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear!
   Cock'd hats of mothy mould! crutches made of mist!
   Arms in slings! old men leaning on young men's shoulders!

   What troubles you, Yankee phantoms? What is all this chattering of
         bare gums?
   Does the ague convulse your limbs? Do you mistake your crutches for
         fire-locks, and level them?

   If you blind your eyes with tears, you will not see the President's
         marshal;
   If you groan such groans, you might balk the government cannon.

   For shame, old maniacs! Bring down those toss'd arms, and let your
         white hair be;                                               Here gape your great grand-sons--their wives gaze at them from the
         windows,
   See how well dress'd--see how orderly they conduct themselves.

   Worse and worse! Can't you stand it? Are you retreating?
   Is this hour with the living too dead for you?

   Retreat then! Pell-mell!
   To your graves! Back! back to the hills, old limpers!
   I do not think you belong here, anyhow.

   But there is one thing that belongs here--shall I tell you what it
         is, gentlemen of Boston?
   I will whisper it to the Mayor--he shall send a committee to England;
   They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with a cart to the
         royal vault--haste!                                          Dig out King George's coffin, unwrap him quick from the grave-
         clothes, box up his bones for a journey;
   Find a swift Yankee clipper--here is freight for you, black-bellied
         clipper,
   Up with your anchor! shake out your sails! steer straight toward
         Boston bay.

   Now call for the President's marshal again, bring out the government
         cannon,
   Fetch home the roarers from Congress, make another procession, guard
         it with foot and dragoons.

   This centre-piece for them:
   Look! all orderly citizens--look from the windows, women!

   The committee open the box, set up the regal ribs, glue those that
         will not stay,
   Clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the
         skull.

   You have got your revenge, old buster! The crown is come to its own,
         and more than its own.

   Stick your hands in your pockets, Jonathan--you are a made man from
         this day;                                                    You are mighty cute--and here is one of your bargains. 

There's nane that's blest of human kind, 
But the cheerful and the gay, man, 
Fal, la, la, &c. 

Here's a bottle and an honest friend! 
What wad ye wish for mair, man? 
Wha kens, before his life may end, 
What his share may be o' care, man? 

Then catch the moments as they fly, 
And use them as ye ought, man: 
Believe me, happiness is shy, 
And comes not aye when sought, man. 

one for you and one for me, 
Fidel Castrol is drinking Coca-Cola! ! 
And like bread and meat in the land of war! 
But a lonely young woman is waiting for you.

Appointed, 
Wondrous works of abstracts; 
Ornamentation, 
Let the trees of the forest rejoice! 
Established, 
Let the heavens rejoice and let the earth be glad; 
For i am now looking through the window of love, 
And like Fifel Castrol with a bottle of Coca-Cola in the hand. 

Drum! ! 
A bottle of rum; 
Glum, 
Hum, 
Gum. 

I have taken a bottle of wine so, 
I couldn't see your name on the list; 
But bring your love to me to remind of last night, 
For your kiss was gently ans so sweet.

You have kept your promise to me so, 
You've now married me; 
And i sincerely thank you for your words.

A bottle of wine, 
And of the drink i took last night; 
So i now write of what i have seen and heard, 
Because you are my sweet lover

You cheated me of a bottle of wine and a loaf of bread, 
And you made me paid extra for them! ! 
But all tHomes will come back to you one day, 
Because we have to be very honest in this world always; 
And like the muse of your love hanging up over the wall. 

A bottle of wine daily with the muse of your love, 
Don't tell me what you do not know! 
But rather what you you do know always, 
For this love is all about you. 

A bottle of wine on the morning grass, 
And of the nakedness of your lover next to you; 
One story led to another in the name of love, 
And like the lpha Boys and the Beta Girls in school! 
But what makes you cry rather makes me laugh.
On the street of love, 
What looks like a joke to you is rather death to me! 
And like the anthems of love to respect your muse, 
But you are now with your lover. 

Never depend on me always because, 
Democracy had run over me! ! 
And it is now pulling me against the walls of wars, 
Because the youth are now out on the streets.

Death is what i now see on the streets, 
But a bottle of wine is what you asked from me; 
And the nation is now in chaos because of this democracy.

The rhythm is in motion and, 
The people are now chanting the war songs; 
But a bottle of wine is what you demanded from me, 
And like the blessed memories gone by. 

I need a bottle of you, hidden in the cupboard.
When I'm lonely I can uncork you, 
close my eyes and inhale your fragrance.

Lest you be too tempting, I would seal you quickly.
A sip would be too much.  it would not end until I was
very drunk indeed.

A bottle of you to remind me who I am. Your spirits
altering my state. I would scrutinize the label, desperately
trying to find the ingredient that draws me. I've never
found another with your blush, body, and bouquet. 

Ever notice how some people 
bounce in and out of your life 
like a red rubber ball? 

Just about the time 
your life settles down, 
they'll careen back in 
with no warning. 

I know someone like that 
and I never know 
which walls he'll glance off of. 

I do know 
before bouncing out again 
he'll almost certainly 
leave more dents in my siding, 
chips in my protective veneer, 
and if I'm lucky, 
only a few more 
.  lovely impressions on my heart 

but I'm developing 
a very bad allergy 
to red latex.  

He halted in the wind, and -  what was that
Far in the maples, pale, but not a ghost? 
He stood there bringing March against his thought,
And yet too ready to believe the most.

'Oh, that's the Paradise-in-bloom,' I said; 
And truly it was fair enough for flowers
had we but in us to assume in march
Such white luxuriance of May for ours.

We stood a moment so in a strange world,
Myself as one his own pretense deceives; 
And then I said the truth (and we moved on) .
A young beech clinging to its last year's leaves. 



sad, but true. 
for so many
people in this world

redemption is
a bowl of rice, 
and a tent that doesnt leak. 

what do you believe in? 
what do you hope for? 
do you believe enough
to make an effort? 

a bowl of rice, 
and a tent that doesnt leak

As a friend, I had come to help
yet one more time
and I watched as she set 
the cardboard box on the floor.
It was labeled for Goodwill, 
penned in large block letters.

From deep in the closet, 
she brought out an old blue suit.
It had faded over the years, 
but I saw in her eyes
the memories still had not.

Softly, she smoothed the sleeves 
that dangled flat and empty.
Then she stroked the slack trousers
on the smooth wooden hanger.
Gently, she brushed 
the dust from the collar and lapel, 
and then I heard her sigh.
Her resolve had melted away.

Again we talked and remembered. 
We spoke of long ago, 
how the sleeves encircled her
in warm secure hugs, 

and the trousers had covered 
lean muscular legs, 
legs slightly bowed, 
legs that loved to dance, 

and what she missed the most
-the heart that beat below
the lapel of the old blue suit, 
the heart that beat with love for her.

For over thirty years, 
the suit had stood sentinel, 
loyally guarding both her
and those memories, 
and I watched as she carefully
replaced the suit and closed
the closet door.

Through quiet tears
she asked once more
how all of that could ever fit
in a box for Goodwill. 

OUT of the noise of tired people working,
Harried with thoughts of war and lists of dead,
His beauty met me like a fresh wind blowing,
Clean boyish beauty and high-held head.
Eyes that told secrets, lips that would not tell them,
Fearless and shy the young unwearied eyes—
Yet to have made this boy he must be wise. 

The great, green gob
was opened wide
and a wriggling worm
was fed inside.

The boy said, 'Mum, 
the frog he comes
and sees me every day, 
but a grass snake lurks
and slyly works
his slithers by the way'.

Then the snake, like lightning, 
makes a strike.
The boy he quickly starts
and jaws around
the great, green gob
are gently eased apart.

Now frog and snake
their freedom take
from the boy
with a pounding heart. 

Poor boy, left alone, staring, 
Trying to reason out the entire Why’s’? 



WHY he had been assaulted? 
WHY he is destined to be reprimanded by others? 
WHY he was compelled to lie? 
WHY he was so scared? 
WHY was he so timid? 
WHY he has lost his self esteem? 
WHY he has always defied his father? 
WHY he was perturbed with his step mom? 
WHY he was always be in remembrance of his celestial mother? 
WHY he got married to a girl of another sect? 
WHY he has fallen again in love? 
WHY his ex-wife did, whatever, she had not been expected? 
WHY his so called ex-wife let him down to lick her sole? 
And to hypothecate his soul too? 
WHY he has fallen in love to give life another chance? 
If he had been fallen, then, 
WHY his present BEAU left him? 
May be she thought the dim about the boy, 
After getting knowing the false realities 
From the false mouth-




WHY this BEAU left him in lurch and beckons the police? 
Stating the odds about the boy.
WHY his BEAU scuffled him before the society, 
Even after knowing the fact that this boy will do no harm to her, 
Except spitting the shit from his mouth---
WHY this BEAU ditched him by vomiting odds, 
About this boy before the cops? 
WHY she has given a chance to his ex-wife (so called) 
To make a baneful revenge over him? 



There is lots of WHY’ssssssss? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 
But less to space out.

He has tried many possible ways to have this BEAU stored
By safeguarding, fighting, fulfilling conditions and
battling.




But---------- --
Nothing went wrong, 


He is really having a capacity to move mountains, 
And proved by moving it, 
Needing no angel, motherly love and everything.



Yes, the boy is not bad, 
How he could be? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 
BUT? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 
He has no answer-------------------------

Now, his feelings are elaborated as the: ---
Innermost recesses of his mind, 
Deep, dark and dusty from nonuse.

Searching for the keys he have lost, 
The one’s that he has thrown away
And even don’t have duplicates.

Some keys he has found, 
Some he dimly sees
Others are bent and will no longer fit, 
And he can’t seem to make new ones.

He asks himself usually, 
WHY keep pretending, 
When nobody cares? 
WHY keep trying 
When nobody shares? 
When to go forward? 
When to go back? 



Lost within himself without
the will to shout.
With a revolving compass
He is going nowhere-----
 

Even after so many debacles in life, 
Now and forever, it is still just HIM, 
ALWAYS REACHING HIGH AND ALWAYS GROWING, 
YET he is not getting taller---lolzzzzzz---


He really knows that destiny plays, 
Leaving everything to realize, and
Nothing is for--
 Forever---



He has left everything to almighty
(Though people seem him to be an atheist-- but --- not he is-) 
letting to him all with hands wide open, 
to relieve him from all pain and sorrows.



BUT---------------------- ----



He is still missing his mother, 
Mother who is in the lap of the ALMIGHTY
And he knows this listless love for his mother, 
Will land him into another
Arena of distress, trouble and pangs-

After losing everything in life, 
He will be a survivor, 
And again no one will shoulder him, leave without a shudder
and to understand.


But-
 One thing is still there---




He is alone, lonesome and orphaned-----"Gabble-gabble,- brethren,- gabble-gabble!" 
My window frames forest and heather. 
I hardly hear the tuneful babble, 
Not knowing nor much caring whether 
The text is praise or exhortation,
Prayer or thanksgiving, or damnation. 

Outside it blows wetter and wetter, 
The tossing trees never stay still. 
I shift my elbows to catch better 
The full round sweep of heathered hill.
The tortured copse bends to and fro 
In silence like a shadow-show. 

The parson’s voice runs like a river 
Over smooth rocks. I like this church: 
The pews are staid, they never shiver,
They never bend or sway or lurch. 
"Prayer," says the kind voice, "is a chain 
That draws down Grace from Heaven again." 

I add the hymns up, over and over, 
Until there’s not the least mistake.
Seven-seventy-one. (Look! there’s a plover! 
It’s gone!) Who’s that Saint by the lake? 
The red light from his mantle passes 
Across the broad memorial brasses. 

It’s pleasant here for dreams and thinking,
Lolling and letting reason nod, 
With ugly serious people linking 
But a dumb blast sets the trees swaying 
With furious zeal like madmen praying. 

There is a place called Hope, Arkansas
Where a little boy grew up
No one ever dreamed that one day
His name would be on a special cup

At first he was raised by grandparents
They did the best they could 
To give this little boy all their love
As all good grandparents would 

The home in which he was raised
Was built in the year of But now a large foundation 
Has turned a childhood into a dream

For this little boy as a man became 
The d president of the USA 
A child who grew up in Hope
Would lead a nation some day

after practice: right foot
to left foot, stepping forward and back, 
 to right foot and left foot,
and left foot up to his thigh, holding 
 it on his thigh as he twists
around in a circle, until it rolls 
 down the inside of his leg,
like a tickle of sweat, not catching 
 and tapping on the soft
side of his foot, and juggling
 once, twice, three times,
hopping on one foot like a jump-roper 
 in the gym, now trapping
and holding the ball in midair, 
 balancing it on the instep
of his weak left foot, stepping forward 
 and forward and back, then
lifting it overhead until it hangs there; 
 and squaring off his body,
he keeps the ball aloft with a nudge 
 of his neck, heading it
from side to side, softer and softer, 
 like a dying refrain,
until the ball, slowing, balances 
 itself on his hairline,
the hot sun and sweat filling his eyes 
 as he jiggles this way
and that, then flicking it up gently, 
 hunching his shoulders
and tilting his head back, he traps it 
 in the hollow of his neck,
and bending at the waist, sees his shadow, 
 his dangling T-shirt, the bent
blades of brown grass in summer heat; 
 and relaxing, the ball slipping
down his back.  

and missing his foot.

 He wheels around, he marches 
over the ball, as if it were a rock
 he stumbled into, and pressing
his left foot against it, he pushes it
 against the inside of his right 
until it pops into the air, is heeled
 over his head- the rainbow! -  
and settles on his extended thigh before
 rolling over his knee and down 
his shin, so he can juggle it again
 from his left foot to his right foot
- and right foot to left foot to thigh- 
 as he wanders, on the last day
of summer, around the empty field. 

Well, my daddy left home when I was three,
and he didn't leave much to Ma and me,
just this old guitar and a bottle of booze.
Now I don't blame him because he run and hid,
but the meanest thing that he ever did was
before he left he went and named me Sue.

Well, he must have thought it was quite a joke,
and it got lots of laughs from a lot of folks,
it seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
and some guy would laugh and I'd bust his head,
I tell you, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue.

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean.
My fist got hard and my wits got keen.
Roamed from town to town to hide my shame,
but I made me a vow to the moon and the stars,
I'd search the honky tonks and bars and kill
that man that gave me that awful name.

But it was Gatlinburg in mid July and I had
just hit town and my throat was dry.
I'd thought i'd stop and have myself a brew.
At an old saloon in a street of mud
and at a table dealing stud sat the dirty,
mangy dog that named me Sue.

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
from a worn-out picture that my mother had
and I knew the scar on his cheek and his evil eye.
He was big and bent and gray and old
and I looked at him and my blood ran cold,
and I said, 'My name is Sue. How do you do?
Now you're gonna die.' Yeah, that's what I told him.

Well, I hit him right between the eyes and he went down
but to my surprise he came up with a knife
and cut off a piece of my ear. But I busted a chair
right across his teeth. And we crashed through
the wall and into the street kicking and a-gouging
in the mud and the blood and the beer.

I tell you I've fought tougher men but I really can't remember when.
He kicked like a mule and bit like a crocodile.
I heard him laughin' and then I heard him cussin',
he went for his gun and I pulled mine first.
He stood there looking at me and I saw him smile.

And he said, 'Son, this world is rough and if
a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
and I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along.
So I gave you that name and I said 'Goodbye'.
I knew you'd have to get tough or die. And it's
that name that helped to make you strong.'

Yeah, he said, 'Now you have just fought one
helluva fight, and I know you hate me and you've
got the right to kill me now and I wouldn't blame you
if you do. But you ought to thank me
before I die for the gravel in your guts and the spit
in your eye because I'm the guy that named you Sue.'
Yeah, what could I do? What could I do?

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun,
called him pa and he called me a son,
and I came away with a different point of view
and I think about him now and then.
Every time I tried, every time I win and if I
ever have a son I think I am gonna name him
Bill or George - anything but Sue. 

It's out and away at break of day,
To frolic and run in the sun-sweet hay:
It's up and out with a laugh and shout
Let the old world know that a boy's about.

It's ho for the creek that the minnows streak,
That the sunbeams dapple, the cattle seek;
For a fishing-pole and a swimming-hole,
Where a boy can loaf and chat with his soul.

It's oh to lie and look at the sky
Through the roof of the leaves that's built so high:
Where all day long the birds make song,
And everything 's right and nothing is wrong.

It's hey to win where the breeze blows thin,
And watch the twinkle of feather and fin:
To lie all day and dream away
The long, long hours as a boy's heart may.

It's oh to talk with the trees and walk
With the winds that whisper to flower and stalk:
And it's oh to look in the open book
Of your own boy-dreams in some leafy nook.

Away from the noise of the town, and toys,
To dream the dreams that are dreamed by boys:
To run in the heat, with sun-tanned feet,
To the music of youth in your heart's young beat.

To splash and wade in the light and shade
Of the league-long ripples the sunbeams braid:
In boyhood's wise to see with eyes
Of fancy hued as the butterflies.

To walk for hours and learn the flowers,
And things that haunt the woods and bowers:
To climb to a nest on a tree's top crest,
Where a bird, like your heart, is singing its best.

To feel the rain on your face again,
Like the thirsty throats that the flowers strain:
To hear the call of the waterfall,
Like the voice of youth, a wonder-thrall.

And it's oh for me at last to see
The rainbow's end by the hillside tree:
On the wet hillside where the wild ferns hide,
Like a boy's bright soul to see it glide.

Then to laugh and run through shower and sun
In the irised hues that are arched and spun:
And, the rainbow's friend, to find and spend
The bag of gold at the rainbow's end. 

Nimble and light of limb,
In three elements free,
To run, to ride, to swim:
Not when the sense is dim,
But now from the heart of joy,
I would remember Him;
Take the thanks of a boy. 

When I was but a little lad
One thing I could not bear,
It was to stand at mother's knee
And have her comb my hair.

They didn't keep boys' hair as short
As it's kept now-a-days,
And mine was always tangled up
In twenty different ways.

I'd twist my mouth and grit my teeth,
And say it wasn't fair-
It was a trial, and no mistake,
When mother combed my hair.

She'd brush and brush each stubborn curl
That grew upon my pate,
And with her scissors nip and clip
To make the edges straight.

Then smooth it down until it shone,
While I would grin and bear,
And feel a martyr through and through,
When mother combed my hair.

She'd take my round chin in her hand
And hold it there the while
She made the parting carefully,
Then tell me with a smile:

'Don't push your cap down on your curls
And spoil my work and care;
He is a pretty little lad
When mother combs his hair.'

I'd hurry out and rumple up
That mop of hair so thick-
A vandal, I, for she had worked
So hard to make it slick-

And wish I were a grown-up man
So nobody would dare
To put a washrag in my ears,
Or comb my tangled hair.

Heigho! now that I'm bald and gray,
Methinks I would be glad
To have her smooth my brow and cheeks,
And whisper, 'Mother's lad!'

A longing for the care-free days
Doth take me unaware;
To stand, a boy, at mother's knee
And have her comb my hair. 

These are our regulations --
 There's just one law for the Scout
And the first and the last, and the present and the past,
 And the future and the perfect is "Look out!"
 I, thou and he, look out!
 We, ye and they, look out!
 Though you didn't or you wouldn't
 Or you hadn't or you couldn't;
 You jolly well must look out!

Look out, when you start for the day
 That your kit is packed to your mind;
There is no use going away             
 With half of it left behind.
Look out that your laces are tight,
 And your boots are easy and stout,
Or you'll end with a blister at night.
(Chorus) All Patrols look out!

Look out for the birds of the air,
 Look out for the beasts of the field --
They'll tell you how and where
 The other side's concealed.
When the blackbird bolts from the copse,
 Or the cattle are staring about,
The wise commander stops
 And (chorus) All Patrols look out!

Look out when your front is clear,
 And you feel you are bound to win.
Look out for your flank and your rear --
 That's where surprises begin.
For the rustle that isn't a rat,
 For the splash that isn't a trout,
For the boulder that may be a hat
(Chorus) All Patrols look out!

For the innocent knee-high grass,
 For the ditch that never tells,
Look out!  Look out ere you pass --
 And look out for everything else!
A sign mis-read as you run
 May turn retreat to a rout --
For all things under the sun
(Chorus) All Patrols look out!

Look out when your temper goes
 At the end of a losing game;
When your boots are too tight for your toes;
 And you answer and argue and blame.
It's the hardest part of the Low,
 But it has to be learnt by the Scout --
For whining and shirking and "jaw"
(Chorus) All Patrols look out

A boyfriend with time
A girlfriend with none
A boyfriend who's always got her on his mind
A girlfriend who never realized she had a boyfriend
A boyfriend who can't seem to understand why 
A girlfriend who doesn't want to
A boyfriend that wants it to work
A girlfriend who doesn't care
A boyfriend with love
A girlfriend who's clueless


I am so lonely and alone
In a strange and far away place
And so now I write in a sad lonely tone
Of my heart aching at the memory of your face, 
Of my thoughts always upon you
 and the words you have said.
And so now I write you in a sad lonely tone
Words that I never have.
So lonely and alone, I think of you. 

I am-
A bra specialist’s worst nightmare

I have been in this dingy stall for an eternity
One large finger-smudged mirror enlightens me to every
Fold, 
Wrinkle, 
And mole.

Piles of gloomy black bras silently mock me
Lying smugly on the floor where I had
Thrown them in frustration

I have discovered I am the wrong shape
The wrong size.
I do not fit (did I ever?) 
Ever longing
To be average.


Betty, the woman strapped with the responsibility of dealing with me
My misguided body, 
Frowns 

Anxious, I self-consciously roll and lift my shoulders back
Hoping to lessen the burden on my ribs
Which now have permanent indents in them

I am

Tired as hell. It’s been over two hours.

Restless teens and a mother with young children
Have given up on using stall "A" today
They crowd ‘round the remaining stall
Like vultures to a bloody feast

Betty is running out of ideas 
(duct tape has yet to come up) 
My patience is waning with my anomalous body
All this poking and prodding
Lacy cups and sharp-edged tags
Have worn me out.

Last one, I say.
 My oxygen is being cut off
My sides itch
Shoulders ache
Stomach grumbles
Head pounds
Time to go.

I decide on one bra.
Three hours of labor, of
Staring at my tummy fat
Tugging at fabric
And too-loose straps
One bra is my reward

I am-
So ready to just let them be free
Burn my bras in protest
Boycott the lingerie industry
(wear lots of loose clothing) 

Until then, I will
Continue to wear
Too- loose
Too- big
Too- small
Too- tight
Malicious
Arrogant

BRAS. 

Without you 
I'm a rain race
The cloud in the spring
An island in the embrace of the sea
Without you
There is no place
All windows are closed
So gray, the sun's face
After years of chasing 
I just got a part 
In the red dream of your kiss
The last grace

(I have
A brain
That is always tired
And always running out of energy
Due to lack of food


Uninvited thoughts, corrupt a verse
And poetry, you become a curse
Memory, you can be so unkind
Your constant ability, to remind

And radio, sometimes you don't belong
You are so cruel, it's very wrong
I decided to move on, today
But then that song, you had to play

And as for you, lousy weather
I suppose you think, you very clever
You knew my plan, to have some fun
But took away my friend, the sun

But like this season
Emotions are strange
Without any given reason
it  will all just change

And Spring will surprise
and brighten away
All those unwanted thoughts
of a grey yesterday

And life will simply just, carry on
and take us to wherever we,  belong
There may be a few clouds, along the way
But they will make way, for a brand new daylook at me, 
what can you see? 
a girl living her dream, 
fighting through pain, 
just to be her best, 
that all she can do, 
forget what people say, 
they don't know me, 
or what i want, 
why should they choose? 
it's not their life, 
SO BACK OFF! ! ! ! 
let a girl do her thing, 
because i freakin sick of labels, 
that used to defind who i am, 
well guess what? 
that not me, 
try and put me down, 
because your $#! t, 
don't work on me, 
cuz you see this, 
IT'S A BRAND NEW ME! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
gain, a year has been passed
Having left us with its memories
Which don't matter beautiful or sad
Being the yesterday histories

And a brand-new year has come to be faced
Day by day will go by slowly but sure
Leaving us older
Leaving us better
Being the tomorrow mysteries


With Satan, my accuser, near
My spirit trembled when I saw
And heart the language of the law. 

In vain I wish'd and strove to hide
The tatter'd, filthy rags I wore;
While my fierce foe insulting cry'd
See what you trusted in before! 

Struck dumb, and left without a plea,
I heard my gracious Saviour say,
Know Satan, I this sinner free,
I died to take his sin away. 

This is a brand which I, in love,
To save from wrath and sin design!
In vain thy accusations prove;
I answer all, and call him mine. 

Then he remov'd my filthy dress;
Poor sinner, take this robe, he said,
It is thy Saviour's rightousness. 

And see, a crown of life prepar'd!
That I might thus my head adorn;
I thought no shame or suff'ring hard,
But wore for thee a crown of thorn. 

O how I heard these gracious words!
They broke and heal'd my heart at once;
And all my idol-gods renounce. 

Now, Satan, thou hast lost thy aim,
Against this brand thy threats are vain;
JESUS has pluck'd it from the flame,
And who shall put it in again

A relating to a yesterday of one's greatness, 
To leave none of it invested in younger generations. 
With a maintaining of it as a prize to prioritize, 
Can not for them, the young alone. 
Be expected to achieve to keep uplifted on myth! 
While their elders glorify themselves, 
With an inconsistent showing. 
Of a bravado meant to impress, 
As those mentioned deeds done by unknown ancestors. 
Seem to be suitable to fit any scenerio of told heroism. 

We, this people, on a small and lonely planet 
Traveling through casual space 
Past aloof stars, across the way of indifferent suns 
To a destination where all signs tell us 
It is possible and imperative that we learn 
A brave and startling truth 

And when we come to it 
To the day of peacemaking 
When we release our fingers 
From fists of hostility 
And allow the pure air to cool our palms 

When we come to it 
When the curtain falls on the minstrel show of hate 
And faces sooted with scorn are scrubbed clean 
When battlefields and coliseum 
No longer rake our unique and particular sons and daughters 
Up with the bruised and bloody grass 
To lie in identical plots in foreign soil 

When the rapacious storming of the churches 
The screaming racket in the temples have ceased 
When the pennants are waving gaily 
When the banners of the world tremble 
Stoutly in the good, clean breeze 

When we come to it 
When we let the rifles fall from our shoulders 
And children dress their dolls in flags of truce 
When land mines of death have been removed 
And the aged can walk into evenings of peace 
When religious ritual is not perfumed 
By the incense of burning flesh 
And childhood dreams are not kicked awake 
By nightmares of abuse 

When we come to it 
Then we will confess that not the Pyramids 
With their stones set in mysterious perfection 
Nor the Gardens of Babylon 
Hanging as eternal beauty 
In our collective memory 
Not the Grand Canyon 
Kindled into delicious color 
By Western sunsets 

Nor the Danube, flowing its blue soul into Europe 
Not the sacred peak of Mount Fuji 
Stretching to the Rising Sun 
Neither Father Amazon nor Mother Mississippi who, without favor, 
Nurture all creatures in the depths and on the shores 
These are not the only wonders of the world 

When we come to it 
We, this people, on this minuscule and kithless globe 
Who reach daily for the bomb, the blade and the dagger 
Yet who petition in the dark for tokens of peace 
We, this people on this mote of matter 
In whose mouths abide cankerous words 
Which challenge our very existence 
Yet out of those same mouths 
Come songs of such exquisite sweetness 
That the heart falters in its labor 
And the body is quieted into awe 

We, this people, on this small and drifting planet 
Whose hands can strike with such abandon 
That in a twinkling, life is sapped from the living 
Yet those same hands can touch with such healing, irresistible tenderness 
That the haughty neck is happy to bow 
And the proud back is glad to bend 
Out of such chaos, of such contradiction 
We learn that we are neither devils nor divines 

When we come to it 
We, this people, on this wayward, floating body 
Created on this earth, of this earth 
Have the power to fashion for this earth 
A climate where every man and every woman 
Can live freely without sanctimonious piety 
Without crippling fear 

When we come to it 
We must confess that we are the possible 
We are the miraculous, the true wonder of this world 
That is when, and only when 
We come to it. 

When snow is here, and the trees look weird,
And the knuckled twigs are gloved with frost;
When the breath congeals in the drover's beard,
And the old pathway to the barn is lost;
When the rooster's crow is sad to hear,
And the stamp of the stabled horse is vain,
And the tone of the cow-bell grieves the ear--
O then is the time for a brave refrain!

When the gears hang stiff on the harness-peg,
And the tallow gleams in frozen streaks;
And the old hen stands on a lonesome leg,
And the pump sounds hoarse and the handle squeaks;
When the woodpile lies in a shrouded heap,
And the frost is scratched from the window-pane
And anxious eyes from the inside peep--
O then is the time for a brave refrain!

When the ax-helve warms at the chimney-jamb,
And hob-nailed shoes on the hearth below,
And the house-cat curls in a slumber calm,
And the eight-day clock ticks loud and slow;
When the harsh broom-handle jabs the ceil
'Neath the kitchen-loft, and the drowsy brain
Sniffs the breath of the morning meal--
O then is the time for a brave refrain!


ENVOI

When the skillet seethes, and a blubbering hot
Tilts the lid of the coffee-pot,
And the scent of the buckwheat cake grows plain--
O then is the time for a brave refrain

Took me a long time
to fight it out with myself

Truth has been written
even tho, you and I try to stick it out

Lifting you up, is how I showed
that my love wanted you to grow

Why do you justify your stance
when it only makes things, so much worse

If you want hell
then, hell is what you got

How can I tell you that I need
so much more than, you can give

Took me a long time
to fight this out with myself

Little mirrors in my soul
tell me it's time to let you go

Truth has been woken, in a kiss
a spell was broken


We need to breath to live
to see the the birds to fly
To feel the wind to leave
To let our dreams go by
but when we love no more
and heart's closed its door, 
We breath without a life
No joy to heal life's strife.

We need to love and care
And show the joy of life
to those who need a cheer
To those  who lived in strife 
To those who need a care
and thirst a love so bless
that we can share our best
and meaning of life's quest. 

While walking through the fields
Along with you on no moon night
I never knew 
I would be traveling all alone
One day on the same path again.
Though I was passing 
Through the tunnel of darkness
I didn't fear the shadow of mine
While being with you.

Today full moon night welcomed me
With its delightful twilight
What made me fear my own shadow
I am not sure
May be the loneliness of breeze 
Touched me painfully.

I've already begun bereaving, 

I host this toast in celebration of our togetherness, &
For your future, I wish you an abundance of greatness.

Between us I hereby complete all exchanges of energy, 
But not before revisiting - for the last time - our galleries of memory. 

I am truly lost for words to thank you enough, &
I just pray, that no phase of your life is ever rough.

You were always there for me, 
When even my nearest demanded a fee.

So selfless you were in your service, 
That I was floored without notice.

To this orphan you were a mother, 
To this ignorant you were a teacher.

To this filth you gave a shower, 
To this plantless you gave a flower.

To this weak you became his power, 
To this lonesome you became his lover.  

You fed me abundantly, 
You guided me enlighteningly.
 
You cleansed me healthily, 
You motivated me realistically.
 
You strengthened me mentally, 
You loved me unconditionally. 

The transformation you've ignited in me is like no other, &
It is only in you that I will still seek true cover.

I've bestowed in you my undivided trust, &
Seeking your advice will always be my sole must.

Of my every creativity you are my ultimate source, &
Of my every positivity you are my driving force. 

Your every smile of light, 
Assured me that I'm living my life just right.

Once an ostracised outsider, 
I am now my life's own leader.
 
What was once unthinkable, 
Has already become empirical. 

Awestruck, astonished, and amazed, 
I reflect on how my life has phased.

How did you convert my futility to fertility? 
Was meeting you really my luck, or destiny? 
 
Was this an interplay of our karmas? 
Or was this just our self-manifested dramas? 

I am, afterall, nothing of yours, &
We do come from different shores. 

That you made me feel so accepted, 
Also makes me very indebted.

I really hope I earned your presence, &
I hope there is no pending penance.

The light you ignited within me will brighten even my path ahead, 
As I will soon hear what you once left unsaid.

As strangers we met, unbounded by any obligation or relation, &
As strangers we'll remain, as we soon release our own masks of identification.

From our now-redundant relation we each achieved personal goals, &
Thus concludes our once-endless journey, between two restless souls.A. 

M.- it’s much too early
It’s no surprise I’m feeling surly.
It’s cold outside and lacking light.
It feels like the middle of the night! 
(When you’ve been out late and had a few
Mondays are no friend to you.) 
Villainous clock that chirps and chimes
I’ll hit your snooze button one more time. 
Its cold, and someone stole the covers
I reach for them as for a lover.
Alas, my larcenous spouse has taken them
I guess I’m in for a brewed awakening. 

HOW the lilacs, the lilacs are glowing and blowing! 
And white through the delicate verdure of May 
The blossoming boughs of the hawthorn are showing, 
Like beautiful brides in their bridal array; 
With cobwebs for laces, and dewdrops for pearls, 

In an aisle of Acacias enlaced and enlacing, 
Where the silvery sunlight tunnels the shade, 
Where snowflakes of butterflies airily chasing 
Each other in trios flash down the arcade: 

Arrayed in white muslin the wedded bride 
Looks fresh as a daisy, the groom by her side. 

The guests flitted round her with light-hearted laughter; 
They hunted the slipper, they kissed the ring; 
Of days gone before and of days coming after 
They thought of no more than the bird on the wing. 
Were the loves and the laughter and lilacs of May, 
With the sunshine above, not enough for the day? 

And the lilacs, the lilacs are blowing and glowing! 
They pluck them by handfuls and pile them in a mass; 
And the sap of the Springtide is rising and flowing 
Through the veins of the greenwood, the blades of the grass; 
Up, up to the last leaf a dance on the tree, 
It leaps like a fountain abundant and free. 

The blackbirds are building their nests in the bushes, 
And whistle at work, as the workpeople do; 
The trees swing their censers, the wind comes in gushes 
Of delicate scent mixed of honey and dew. 
Now loud and now loud through the garrulous trees 
A burst of gay music is blown with the breeze. 

And the girls and the boys from the faubourgs of Paris, 
The premature gamins as wise as fourscore; 
The vain little Margots and the wide-awake Harrys, 
Surprised into childhood, grew simple once more, 
And vied with the cuckoo as, shouting at play, 
They dashed through the thickets and darted away. 

Ah, fair is the forest's green glimmering splendour, 
The leaves of the lime tree a network of light; 
And fringing long aisles of acacia, a tender 
And delicate veiling of virginal white, 
Where, framed in the gladdening flowers of May, 
The bride and her bridesmaids beam gladder than they. 

They have crowned her brown tresses with hawthorn in blossom, 
They have made her a necklace of daisies for pearls; 
They have set the white lily against her white bosom, 
Enthroned on the grass mid a garland of girls; 
With the earth for a footstool, the sky-roof above, 

Oh, the lilacs, the lilacs are glowing and blowing! 
They pluck them by bushels as blithely they go 
Through the green, scented dusk where the hawthorn is showing 
A luminous whiteness of blossoming snow. 
And the Sun ere he goes gives the Moon half his light, 
As a lamp to lead Love on the bridal night. 

I.
The golden gates of Sleep unbar
Where Strength and Beauty, met together,
Kindle their image like a star
In a sea of glassy weather!
Night, with all thy stars look down,--
Darkness, weep thy holiest dew,--
Never smiled the inconstant moon
On a pair so true.
Let eyes not see their own delight;--
Haste, swift Hour, and thy flight 
Oft renew.

II.
Fairies, sprites, and angels, keep her!
Holy stars, permit no wrong!
And return to wake the sleeper,
Dawn,—ere it be long! 
O joy! O fear! what will be done
In the absence of the sun!
Come along!


'O I am weary!' she sighed, as her billowy
Hair she unloosed in a torrent of gold
That rippled and fell o'er a figure as willowy,
Graceful and fair as a goddess of old:
Over her jewels she flung herself drearily,
Crumpled the laces that snowed on her breast,
Crushed with her fingers the lily that wearily
Clung in her hair like a dove in its nest--.
And naught but her shadowy form in the mirror
To kneel in dumb agony down and weep near her!

'Weary--?' Of what? Could we fathom the mystery--?
Lift up the lashes weighed down by her tears
And wash with their dews one white face from her history,
Set like a gem in the red rust of years?
Nothing will rest her-- unless he who died of her
Strayed from his grave, and in place of the groom,
Tipping her face, kneeling there by the side of her,
Drained the old kiss to the dregs of his doom--.
And naught but that shadowy form in the mirror
To heel in dumb agony down and weep near her

Liars I don't miss.
Or regret that I've kicked, 
To the curb.
And that's not a bridge to burn.
That's a bridge built to forget, 
A waste of time taken. 
In frequent walks across.

To awaken and realize, 
Who's mind was lost.
Trying to disguise the bridge.
And the appearance, 
Of what it could have been. 
With a daily dose of applied fog.
Believing it not to be noticed. 

There had been much rain in the upland and the river ran 
full and strong, so forceful that a pillar, on the old bridge, 
broke off and half of it fell down.
Misty night when a bus crossed the bridge, plunged down 
into churning inferno, for its passengers a few seconds of 
terror before death came as a blessing. Thirty people had 
been aboard going home, it took hour before families of 
the disappeared knew of this immense tragedy.   
None was ever seen again but one; a woman found on 
the strand in France, skeletal hands pressed to her face, 
open mouth and the echo of a scream as eye sockets 
accusatorially looked up to a silent the sky. 
Summer, a new bridge has been built, but the old one 
is still there and daring boys jump from it, for them what 
happened a winter eight years ago is history.  It must be 
that way, life must go on and the river must run towards 
the ocean and eternity. 

Love is not about the frail union 
Of two bodies or exchange of two
Fantasies
But the owner of all states. 
Love's  most precious gift is life
And life's most beautiful necessity
Is to endow each human heart with love, 
To love each other- the only kinship
That shames hatred to make
The world go round.
Man finds the greatest tranquility only
When he desires nothing save love.
A heart which has never loved, 
Has never lived. 

It surely was a hard time 
For you to have to say 'goodbye'! 
Did she really care about your plans, 
Your talks, your efforts, your dreams? 
Tell us what happened, honey, and why? 
Try and overcome it by all means.
Keep your faith, live your days wisely, 
Face your plight, 
And things will certainly end up
Getting right! 

(May Sorrow everywhere. Slaughter everywhere. If babies
are not starving someplace, they are starving
somewhere else. With flies in their nostrils.
Otherwise the mornings before summer dawn would not
be made so fine. The Bengal tiger would not
be fashioned so miraculously well. The poor women
at the fountain are laughing together between
the suffering they have known and the awfulness
in their future, smiling and laughing while somebody
in the village is very sick. There is laughter
every day in the terrible streets of Calcutta,
and the women laugh in the cages of Bombay.
If we deny our happiness, resist our satisfaction,
we lessen the importance of their deprivation.
We must risk delight. We can do without pleasure,
but not delight. Not enjoyment. We must have
the stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthless
furnace of this world. To make injustice the only
measure of our attention is to praise the Devil.
we should give thanks that the end had magnitude.
We must admit there will be music despite everything.
We stand at the prow again of a small ship
anchored late at night in the tiny port
looking over to the sleeping island: the waterfront
is three shuttered cafes and one naked light burning.
To hear the faint sound of oars in the silence as a rowboat
comes slowly out and then goes back is truly worth
all the years of sorrow that are to come. 

For those who jump
when friendship beckons
and seal their pact in miniseconds
go from a grump
to being happy
they've learned that life
if it is crappy
brings only strife.

But wait, what if they do at first
cling to the warmth of status quo
in an insatiable thirst
they sit and watch the union grow.

Yet, humans being rather fickle
they'll take the tiniest excuse
a word, a gesture comes, to tickle 
and plants the seed (the devil's ruse?) 
which now creates a plant with leaves
developing into a huge
and monstrous climber, to the eaves
it looks convincingly like Scrooge.

No further sign is now required
the catchcry now is condemnation
a fleeting friendship has grown tired
all faith, a product of inflation. 

There's truth laced in the preachings
of every religious man
A thread of fact sewn into prayer flags
A shred of light in the Qur'an

He's in the melting in the North
And in the bombings overseas

He's also everything
He is joy and luminescence

He's in that dog left on the street
He's in that gay man and those women
And that beggar at your feet

For all things are touched by the divine
If you can open your eyes to see it
And we are all made to be somebody
But only you can be it

So why then, is there so much hate? 
Why the rape and abductions
Why the wars and destruction
When our existence is based on a connection? 

If everyone could look into their neighbours' eyes
and see the divinity
There would never be another unanswered prayer
Or at least, that's my philosophy


I just 
Wrote a brief letter to
Today
And
I felt very emotional after
The letter was written by me


One sweltering day, 
Wind howls, trees fall; it rains
White pellets- Hail, storm

Even though the time

we spent together was brief

each moment remains

yesterdays treasures to hold

your memory will not fade.

I have bright red angry screams.
Not within the voice of me.
But in the cuts on my arms.
I cut and cut.
Now my scream is out and free.
My screams are nasty red cuts.
Angrier by the day.

Each cut is my 
My bright red scream.
Every cut a new scream.
Screaming  louder and louder.

The bright red scream.
Sets me free
If not for long
Just for a while. 

Amidst
Today's
And till this day's
Pain and pangs
Sufferings and sorrows
Falls and failures
Poverty and penury
I do see a
Silver lining
Bright tomorrow
Absolutely bright
Based purely on
Efforts and efficacy
Of hopes and prayer! 
Tomorrow
A bright and prosperous tomorrow
Seen through my inward eyes
And its melodies
Heard through my inward ears

Liking the serenity of this particular day after it having
been a stressful morning.

A friend saying how he loved being with me, brightened
my outlook, bringing a smile to my heart and face.

Just because of an innocent thoughtful remark, this day 
has been made a memorable one through caring and love that 
he made sure I knew about.

Touching this heart with sweetness from his own, causes me 
to wish everyone could practice this generous art.

Our world would be such a nice place to live, play and
cherish in all it's beauty. 

He suffered from a phlebolith, 
a rather nasty fusion, 
a gray and stringy, foamy pith 
it caused a great delusion. 
He thought he was a gifted boy 
but to his consternation 
the only person to enjoy 
his immature narration 
was mother who, between TV, 
soap operas and Springer 
read all his so-called poetry 
and raised her ladyfinger: 
some day will have the masses 
come running just to hear his odd. . 
and sit there, on their asses. 
In awe they'll be, and rightfully, 
such talent, such devotion! 
I think that I may go and pee 
into the Southern Ocean.(A. D. 

"A Centurion of the Thirtieth"


My father's father saw it not,
And I, belike, shall never come 
To look on that so-holy spot --
That very Rome --

Crowned by all Time, all Art, all Might,
City beneath whose oldest height --
The Race began!

Soon to send forth again a brood,
Unshakable, we pray, that clings
To Rome's thrice-hammered hardihood --
In arduous things.

Strong heart with triple armour bound,
Beat strongly, for thy life-blood runs,
Age after Age, the Empire round --
In us thy Sons

Who, distant from the Seven Hills,
Loving and serving much, require
Thee -- thee to guard 'gainst home-born ills
The Imperial Fire

If Brother Francis pardoned Brother Flea,
There still seems need of such strange charity,
Seeing he is, for all his gay goodwill,
Bitten by funny little creatures still. 

Notoriety and wealth, 
Are heavyweights to bear.
For one who can not appear anywhere, 
To publicly go unnoticed.
Yet desires to have privacy.

However. 
Those with fame and bone broke, 
Can run the streets naked. 
Only to be described when this is revealed, 
As 'A Broke Nut Who Managed To Make A Name.

'You did not come,
And marching Time drew on, and wore me numb.
Yet less for loss of your dear presence there
Than that I thus found lacking in your make
That high compassion which can overbear
Reluctance for pure lovingkindness' sake
Grieved I, when, as the hope-hour stroked its sum,
You did not come. 

You love not me,
And love alone can lend you loyalty;
-I know and knew it. But, unto the store
Of human deeds divine in all but name,
Was it not worth a little hour or more
To add yet this: Once you, a woman, came
To soothe a time-torn man; even though it be
You love not me. 

When someone broke my heart, 
One never knew one was sitting in my heart, 
I am not picking broken pieces of my heart, 
I am picking pieces of someone, 
Shall I succeed in joining the pieces, 
I think I shall, 
But the spots of the joints, 
Will make the doll ugly, 
And the doll would not like to see herself, 
In a mirror any more.

On the battlefields in France 
I’d volunteered for active service
For I saw this as a chance
To earn respect from those around me
And stare death full in the face
Being brave was nothing strange to me
And fear is no disgrace
I saw the clouds of chlorine rising
As we put those gas masks on
I saw men torn from their bodies
I’ve been deafened by the guns
There was mustard gas and shrapnel
And more barbed wire than in the bush
There was dysentery and typhus
And bodies oozing pus
That mud clung to your belly
And the rats they seemed to thrive
On bodies out in no-man’s land
Of soldiers not alive
My mates - some of them blinded
Some of them blown apart
And others they just disappeared
When the barrages did start
Some days, it would fall silent
And you could hear the German side
I’d guess they would be blokes like us
Just trying to survive
You’d put your head up in the trenches
And the odds were pretty high
That a sniper that you couldn’t see
Would send you to the sky.
Some of us were lucky
But so many badly died
It didn’t seem like murder
More like wilful suicide
It was hell there in those trenches
There was no glory in that war
No victory in battle
Just stripped naked and red raw
I didn’t go alone you know
I’d gone off there with some mates
We’d gone to show our bravery
And then were told to wait.
There was so much bloody paperwork
Before we could go to fight
They didn’t make it easy
Because we were not white
I’m back now in Australia
Sometimes at night I wake in fear
I can hear the guns and all y’know
And they still seem very near
In the army I was Billy
I had a real name
Now, once again, I’m just an Abo
And my life is much the same
The white men, they look down on us
Then give our women rum
They often take advantage
Then threaten us with guns.
Man! If I just had my life again
And all my mates were here
I don’t think I’d fight in that war
Nor lose myself in beer.
For I thought I’d be respected
By the whitefellas and such
But now I simply realise
We don’t matter very much
For the war, they’d made us citizens
So we could play our part
Now it’s over that’s been taken back
And I have a broken heart. 

How do you mend, a broken
heart? Where do you begin
and where do you start? How
do you face another day? What
do you do and what do you say? 
It's never easy, getting back into
the swing, there's no doubt, it will
take it's toll. You have to be strong
and forge ahead, then, things will
start to roll. Just give it plenty of
time, as others have done before.
Then you'll be ready to start again
and open, another door

Where the ends of life meet
A boundary is broken
Overstepped and outreached
When another creed has spoken. 

This is the end for me and you
And that's why it is truly 
A new beginning for me
When a sad separation
Is meant to be for both of us! 

Have there ever been doubts? 
I cannot remember
Anything saved that night
Some years ago since
I met you for the first time! 

All that you offered me, 
Disguised as happiness
Has been my disbelief
That I should be so blessed. 

But still you are asking
That I stay by your side
And so entirely, 
When you broke my heart 
And tarnished my pride! 


New York City


A product of my past, 
And those influencing the environment. 
Will be remembered as benefits, 
Of my comprehension.
And the depths of my sentiments.

Erasing experiences, 
Is not as easy as a forgiveness done. 
For one's mistakes.
A broken heart is seldom forgotten.
Or the healing of it that it takes.

Those happy times embraced, 
Will always be cherished and loved.
Those who initiated and inflicted pain. 
Will always be remarkably prioritized in my memory.
There is something about those who teach great lessons. 
Their faces will be forever etched for their deeds and activities.

Some are embittered with animosities.
Not me! 

When you left my heart
was broken
tiny pieces were scattered
everywhere
my search to find and 
repair the damage began

I grew very excited for
in my search
thinking I had finally
gathered all the pieces
together 
The task trying to attach
each piece in the proper

place so it would look 
as if nothing ever
happened
 
No one would ever know 
the damage that had been 
done. I was almost finished

when realizing a tiny piece 
was still missing

searching everywhere in
the darkest corners but 
it had vanished. I finally
came to understand a broken 

heart will never be as it 
once was 
a broken heart will always

remember.

A broken heart's song,  
Starts out slow. 
A confusion of melodies,  
With easy flow. 

Keys of a piano,  
Play a sad tune. 
But nothing compared,  
To what comes soon. 

Strings of violins,  
Add to the gloom. 
The broken heart's song,  
Fills the room. 

Confusion fades,  
The hurt settles in. 
As a Theremin's cry,  
Creeps under the skin. 

The pain is too much,  
For the broken heart. 
As the days go by,  
The anger starts. 

The beating of drums,  
From hitting the wall. 
The crash of cymbals,  
As you begin to fall. 

From confusion to pain,  
To anger, now hate. 
Guitars scream out,  
As the music dilates. 

Then suddenly it stops,  
You remember when. 
The broken heart's song,  
Starts over again. 

A broken heart within me knows, 
What loneliness is. 
When it is left to linger, 
And slowly grows to wither in wishes! 

A happiness living outside is dismissed.
For what it is.
Because it isn't felt, 
From inside. 
With a gladness that appears.

It's much too late to date a memory! 
When fading ushers its leaving.
No one else can see it drift.
Yet an emptiness is hinged.  
To a pain remaining that is grieving, 
Within.

Time gone, 
Like the wind blows, 
Never returns again! 
Not to visit in inquisitive sits. 
With the one excited to be near, 
In benefitted moments held dear.

A broken mirror
A distorted face
A shattered heart 
A clear distaste

A fallen tear
A reddened eye
A downturned mouth
A year gone by

A loaded gun
A finished fear
A bloodied wall
A broken mirror.  

Our love was destined to fail, 
I tried to save it without avail, 
For between us, you built a fence, 
Leaving me weak without any defense. 

You turned my heart into a fortress
Inhabited by a soul sad and hopeless
But time has done the healing, 
Making me self-confident with new feelings. 

In the Mighty One above, 
I found fortitude, peace and love. 
I got the courage to bury my past
And forgetting a love I failed to cast. 

Clearly, you became a loser and sinner
While I became stronger and a winner. 
Now, I stand on a solid ground, 
Hoping for a real love to be found. 


And saw what I've never liked to see 
I saw all of my flaws that day
And every last one of my insecurities.
Put on display 
Brought to the light
Looking into that mirror
My own tears I had to fight.
The longer I looked into the mirror 
The deeper inside myself I peered
And when I noticed my reflection 
I was startled to see 
That MY reflection wasn't there.
It was the person I really am
Looking back at me
Someone who isn't as steadfast
As you make her out to be
But when looking at who I really am
Became to tough
When looking in the mirror
Became to much
I struck the mirror hard as I could
And watched it plummet from the wall
I watched the only thing 
That's ever really seen who I am 
Hit the ground
With nothing to break its fall.
And it lays on the ground
Broken to this very day
And I don't have the guts to put it back together
So I guess on the ground in pieces
It'll stay. 

if love is a promise in spring
so love may as surely take wing
for springtime must end
though lovers pretend
what love's frail illusion can bring

no love is a union of souls
to hold us until we grow old
for love seems to fade
like spring's masquerade
when seasons return to the cold

so love will await the refrain
the seasons are ever to blame
for love will know fall
and winter's dark pall
until only memories remain


A Broken rainbow on the skies of May,
Touching the dripping roses and low clouds,
And in wet clouds its scattered glories lost:
So in the sorrow of her soul the ghost
Of one great love, of iridescent ray,
Spanning the roses dim of memory,
Against the tumult of life's rushing crowds
A broken rainbow on the skies of May.
A flashing humming-bird among the flowers,
Deep-coloured blooms; its slender tongue and bill
Sucking the syrups and the calyxed myrrhs,
Till, being full of sweets, away it whirrs:
Such was his love that won her heart's rich bowers
To give to him their all, their honied showers,
The bloom from which he drank his body's fill
A flashing humming-bird among the flowers.
A moon, moth-white, that through long mists of fleece
Moves amber-girt into a bulk of black,
And, lost to vision, rims the black with froth:
A love that swept its moon, like some great moth,
Across the heaven of her soul's young peace;
And, smoothly passing, in the clouds did cease
Of time, through which its burning light comes back
A moon, moth-white, that moves through mists of fleece.
A bolt of living thunder downward hurled,
Momental blazing from the piled-up storm,
That instants out the mountains and the ocean,
The towering crag, then blots the sight's commotion:
Love, love that swiftly coming bared the world,
The deeps of life, 'round which fate's clouds are curled,
And, ceasing, left all night and black alarm
A bolt of living thunder downward hurled. 

I hardly felt your shadow
Creeping behind my back
The way I used to
When days were still longer
Than the nights

Seldom I’ve seen your face
Confined within the deepest
Of my dreams
Now I miss the thought
Of you just staring
Into my direction

As this record starts to play
Your words that caused me
Heartbreak and pain
Calling someone your own
Other than my name

Now the rain that flows
Into this river of despair
Hoping to wash away
Everything you left in a trace
But still an endless stream
Leading back to your memories

But even as I pretend
I’m not wounded
In this foolish game
Your words into a song
Keep echoing from deep within

Coz here I sit by the window
Waiting for that day
When the rain stops falling
And I learn to let go your song
You unwittingly weaved
Into notes of goodbye and forever.




Life is so lonely for everyone on earth.
We try to fill our time here with people, things and lists to do, but loneliness is always inherently within us, taunting us with it's disregard of love and happiness.
Old or young, when people we have placed in our lives - through marriage or friendship - die or leave us for someone else, we are left with a gaping hole - a total emptiness for the rest of our days.
It's far beyond just sadness - it's a brokenness held deeply in our souls. 

HERE at right of the entrance this bronze head,
Human, superhuman, a bird's round eye,
Everything else withered and mummy-dead.
What great tomb-haunter sweeps the distant sky
(Something may linger there though all else die;)
And finds there nothing to make its tetror less
i{Hysterica passio} of its own emptiness?

No dark tomb-haunter once; her form all full
As though with magnanimity of light,
Yet a most gentle woman; who can tell
Which of her forms has shown her substance right?
Or maybe substance can be composite,
profound Mc


Taggart thought so, and in a breath
A mouthful held the extreme of life and death.

But even at the starting-post, all sleek and new,
I saw the wildness in her and I thought
A vision of terror that it must live through
Had shattered her soul.  Propinquity had brought
Imagiation to that pitch where it casts out
All that is not itself:  I had grown wild
And wandered murmuring everywhere, 'My child, my
child! '

Or else I thought her supernatural;
As though a sterner eye looked through her eye
On this foul world in its decline and fall;
On gangling stocks grown great, great stocks run dry,
Ancestral pearls all pitched into a sty,
Heroic reverie mocked by clown and knave,
And wondered what was left for massacre to save. 

From the first it had been like a
Ballad. It had the beat inevitable. It had the blood.
A wildness cut up, and tied in little bunches,
Like the four-line stanzas of the ballads she had never quite
understood--the ballads they had set her to, in school.


Herself: the milk-white maid, the "maid mild"
Of the ballad. Pursued
By the Dark Villain. Rescued by the Fine Prince.
The Happiness-Ever-After.
That was worth anything.
It was good to be a "maid mild

"
That made the breath go fast.


Her bacon burned. She
Hastened to hide it in the step-on can, and
Drew more strips from the meat case. The eggs and sour-milk biscuits
Did well. She set out a jar
Of her new quince preserve.


. . . But there was something about the matter of the Dark Villain.
He should have been older, perhaps.
The hacking down of a villain was more fun to think about
When his menace possessed undisputed breath, undisputed height,
And best of all, when history was cluttered
With the bones of many eaten knights and princesses.


The fun was disturbed, then all but nullified
When the Dark Villain was a blackish child
Of Fourteen, with eyes still too young to be dirty,
And a mouth too young to have lost every reminder
Of its infant softness.


That boy must have been surprised! For
These were grown-ups. Grown-ups were supposed to be wise.
And the Fine Prince--and that other--so tall, so broad, so
Grown! Perhaps the boy had never guessed
That the trouble with grown-ups was that under the magnificent shell of adulthood, just under,
Waited the baby full of tantrums.
It occurred to her that there may have been something
Ridiculous to the picture of the Fine Prince
Rushing (rich with the breadth and height and
Mature solidness whose lack, in the Dark Villain, was impressing her,
Confronting her more and more as this first day after the trial
And acquittal (wore on) rushing
With his heavy companion to hack down (unhorsed)
That little foe. So much had happened, she could not remember now what that foe had done
Against her, or if anything had been done.
The breaks were everywhere. That she could think
Of no thread capable of the necessary
Sew-work.


She made the babies sit in their places at the table.
Then, before calling HIM, she hurried
To the mirror with her comb and lipstick. It was necessary
To be more beautiful than ever.
The beautiful wife.
For sometimes she fancied he looked at her as though
Measuring her. As if he considered, Had she been worth it?
Had she been worth the blood, the cramped cries, the little stirring bravado, The gradual dulling of those Negro eyes,
The sudden, overwhelming little-boyness in that barn?
Whatever she might feel or half-feel, the lipstick necessity was something apart. HE must never conclude
That she had not been worth it.


HE sat down, the Fine Prince, and
Began buttering a biscuit. HE looked at HIS hands.
More papers were in from the North, HE mumbled. More maddening headlines.
With their pepper-words, "bestiality," and "barbarism," and
"Shocking
 

The half-sneers HE had mastered for the trial worked across
HIS sweet and pretty face.


What HE'd like to do, HE explained, was kill them all.
The time lost. The unwanted fame.
Still, it had been fun to show those intruders
A thing or two. To show that snappy-eyed mother,
That sassy, Northern, brown-black--


Nothing could stop Mississippi.
HE knew that. Big fella
Knew that.
And, what was so good, Mississippi knew that.
They could send in their petitions, and scar
Their newspapers with bleeding headlines. Their governors
Could appeal to Washington . . .


"What I want," the older baby said, "is 'lasses on my jam

"
Whereupon the younger baby
Picked up the molasses pitcher and threw
The molasses in his brother's face. Instantly
The Fine Prince leaned across the table and slapped
The small and smiling criminal.
She did not speak. When the HAND
Came down and away, and she could look at her child,
At her baby-child,
She could think only of blood.
Surely her baby's cheek
Had disappeared, and in its place, surely,
Hung a heaviness, a lengthening red, a red that had no end.
She shook her had. It was not true, of course.
It was not true at all. The
Child's face was as always, the
Color of the paste in her paste-jar.


She left the table, to the tune of the children's lamentations, which were shriller
Than ever. She
Looked out of a window. She said not a word. That
Was one of the new Somethings--
The fear,
Tying her as with iron.


Suddenly she felt his hands upon her. He had followed her
To the window. The children were whimpering now.
Such bits of tots. And she, their mother,
Could not protect them. She looked at her shoulders, still
Gripped in the claim of his hands. She tried, but could not resist the idea
That a red ooze was seeping, spreading darkly, thickly, slowly,
Over her white shoulders, her own shoulders,
And over all of Earth and Mars.


He whispered something to her, did the Fine Prince, something about love and night and intention.
She heard no hoof-beat of the horse and saw no flash of the shining steel.


He pulled her face around to meet
His, and there it was, close close,
For the first time in all the days and nights.
His mouth, wet and red,
So very, very, very red,
Closed over hers.


Then a sickness heaved within her. The courtroom Coca-Cola,
The courtroom beer and hate and sweat and drone,
Pushed like a wall against her. She wanted to bear it.
But his mouth would not go away and neither would the
Decapitated exclamation points in that Other Woman's eyes.


She did not scream.
She stood there.
But a hatred for him burst into glorious flower,
And its perfume enclasped them--big,
Bigger than all magnolias.


The last bleak news of the ballad.
The rest of the rugged music.
The last quatrain. 

The farmhouse lingers, though averse to square
With the new city street it has to wear
A number in. But what about the brook
That held the house as in an elbow-crook?
I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength
And impulse, having dipped a finger length
And made it leap my knuckle, having tossed
A flower to try its currents where they crossed.
The meadow grass could be cemented down
From growing under pavements of a town;
The apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame.
Is water wood to serve a brook the same?
How else dispose of an immortal force
No longer needed? Staunch it at its source
With cinder loads dumped down? The brook was thrown
Deep in a sewer dungeon under stone
In fetid darkness still to live and run --
And all for nothing it had ever done
Except forget to go in fear perhaps.
No one would know except for ancient maps
That such a brook ran water. But I wonder
If from its being kept forever under,
The thoughts may not have risen that so keep
This new-built city from both work and sleep. 

The old brownstone has stood
For over a century.
Today is its end.
Broken windows stare blindly
As preparations for its demise begin.

This building has the memories of Jewish and Irish
Who come overwhelmed from Ellis Island
Their languages and smells of ethnic cooking
Tobacco and the smells of food
Stay suspended in the unventilated corridoors.

Noisy, no hot water or electric light
The single dirty toilet in the corridor
But away from the pogroms and sheer terror
It was still a place to call your own, and put a song in your heart.

Outside, the cobbled streets and vegetable carts, 
With the cry of the vendors and the countless children
Playing games that have been forgotten
A simple time - a time which has been forgotten.

It will be turned into a glass and steel fishtank, 
For overweight keep fitters.
I wish that it could stay, 
As it belongs where it is. 

A Brother Never Met

I wish I could tell you a story of brotherhood
now that my siblings are dead, I was the youngest one
but knew I had a half- brother in Arizona
a product of my father who was quite active on 
this field, the woman- his mother- conceived when my
mother was pregnant with me; I didn`t know this 
before I was in my forties. I contacted his half- brother
 in Norway to get his address since he had been 
adopted and had another surname, but he wouldn`t 
give me the address he had forgotten it I knew this was 
not true but left if at that. To my surprise, my nephew told 
me the half -brother had been on holiday at a village 
where I go shopping and buy medicine.  I wish I could say 
I bumped into him and a new brotherhood blossomed.
Alas, it is more likely he does not want to know about the past 
and our parents' transgression. 

What is this thing called death? 
I have no understanding of it's meaning, as I'm only
three years old.
Everyone around me is either cross or crying, I don't
know what I'm supposed to do.
Mommy went to the hospital to have my baby brother, 
he should've come home with her by now.
Yet, friends and family come and take me with them, I
want to stay at home where I feel safe.
No one listens to me, it's a dilemma, I go to my room
and lie on my bed.
Maybe if I sleep for a while and then wake up, every-
thing will be alright again.
It's really scary seeing grown-ups cry when I don't
know why they're doing it.
Mom is home without my baby brother, I haven't seen 
or held his hand yet.
Where is he?  Why did Mommy leave him all alone some-
where?  He's going to be scared.
Lying in my little bed tonight, I can hear Daddy and
Mommy talking and crying.
I'm worried about them.  Did I do something wrong?  
Is it my fault this is all  happening? 
As I fall asleep, tears spill onto my pillow, as I 
promise that I'll try and be real, real good
tomorrow. 

With two white roses on her breasts, 
    White candles at head and feet, 
Dark Madonna of the grave she rests; 

Her mother pawned her wedding ring
    To lay her out in white; 
She'd be so proud she'd dance and sing
    to see herself tonight. 

I will accept thy will to do and be,
Thy hatred and intolerance of sin,
Thy will at least to love, that burns within
And thirsteth after Me:
So will I render fruitful, blessing still,
The germs and small beginnings in thy heart,
Because thy will cleaves to the better part.—
Alas, I cannot will.

Dost not thou will, poor soul? Yet I receive
The inner unseen longings of the soul, 
I guide them turning towards Me; I control
And charm hearts till they grieve:
If thou desire, it yet shall come to pass,
Though thou but wish indeed to choose My love;
For I have power in earth and heaven above.—
I cannot wish, alas!

What, neither choose nor wish to choose? and yet
I still must strive to win thee and constrain:
For thee I hung upon the cross in pain,
How then can I forget? 
If thou as yet dost neither love, nor hate,
Nor choose, nor wish,—resign thyself, be still
Till I infuse love, hatred, longing, will.—
I do not deprecate. 

You are feeling tired tonight
After a long drive in the car
From work
All the way back home
And 
You are in a lot of stress
From work also
Because
You can feel that
Your body is aching
All over also


LACON.  For a kiss or two, confess,
What doth cause this pensiveness,
Thou most lovely neat-herdess?
Why so lonely on the hill?
Why thy pipe by thee so still,
That erewhile was heard so shrill?
Tell me, do thy kine now fail
To fulfil the milking-pail?
Say, what is't that thou dost ail?

THYR.  None of these; but out, alas!
A mischance is come to pass,
And I'll tell thee what it was:
See, mine eyes are weeping ripe.
LACON.  Tell, and I'll lay down my pipe.

THYR.  I have lost my lovely steer,
That to me was far more dear
Than these kine which I milk here;
Broad of forehead, large of eye,
Party-colour'd like a pye,
Smooth in each limb as a die;
Clear of hoof, and clear of horn,
Sharply pointed as a thorn;
With a neck by yoke unworn,
From the which hung down by strings,
Balls of cowslips, daisy rings,
Interplaced with ribbonings;
Faultless every way for shape;
Not a straw could him escape,
Ever gamesome as an ape,
But yet harmless as a sheep.
Pardon, Lacon, if I weep;
Tears will spring where woes are deep.
Now, ai me!  ai me!  Last night
Came a mad dog, and did bite,
Ay, and kill'd my dear delight.

LACON  Alack, for grief!
THYR.  But I'll be brief.
Hence I must, for time doth call
Me, and my sad playmates all,
To his evening funeral.
Live long, Lacon; so adieu!

LACON Mournful maid, farewell to you;
Earth afford ye flowers to strew

Humble plant
ignorant of what's really self determined-
sometimes fruits laden
sometimes frost ridden
as electricity within water, labours
hard to within its petals
its divided nature
to know who puts it in its life structure
when she was still in the seed. 

the Buddha was the comfort of surrender
weathered so by rain and wind
that his very presence
spoke in silence

this Buddha had not suffered from desire
the moss grew on him like truth
arising from an awakening
of its source

in the absolute stillness of the garden
the cessation of all suffering
found the noble harmony
of the path

the stolid Buddha's serenity guided me
to know that quiet freedom
if only for the moment
in its peacea buddha. 
or just another homeless man, 
standing on the corner
of the street going nowhere.
what do we hold in our hands
that will remain? 
even daylight is swallowed by night, 
and night disappears into the dawn.
and love in the end
is merely a moment given, 
a grain of sand
on a deserted beach.
the trees shed their leaves
for the winter cleansing, 
and so we lay our bodies
down into the earth's embrace! 
o to be ocean, 
filling the great chasms of history.
o to be mountain, 
and bridge the earth to the sky.
o to be wind, 
to come and go without restraint.
o to be fire, 
to consume, and yet to give warmth! 

and o to know, 
that we are each and all, 
that we are none and nothing.
both the falling star, 
and the blackened sky. 
and yes a grain of sand
beneath the traveller's feet, 
the home that cannot be taken, 
but is freely given! 
and hands that have no need to hold

one lone rose
opened by the sun, 
the faint memory of rain, 
and the dark damp earth.

reaching to the sky, 
petals yearning, at peace. 
then, without regret, 
wilting back into nothingness. 

and no one saw

may every breath i breathe, 
help relieve the suffering
of the many. 
may every step i take, 
be on the path of truth.
may my eyes see myself
in all living beings, 
may my heart do the work
that compassion demands.
may i feel every tear, 
every hurt, every need.
may i touch with sacred hands.
may my body be a bridge, 
and my spirit healing ointment.
may my words fall like rain
on the desert of need.
may i give without hesitation, 
and without expectation.
may i grasp the hand that needs help, 
and let go of all else.
may my life be both prayer, 
and the much needed answer.
may my identity be both lost
and found in all living beings

sitting on the bed
with my old blind dog. 
breathing in, breathing out. 

breathing in suffering, 
all the suffering of the hungry, 
the homeless, those in prison

those ravaged by war
of the lonely, those filled with despair, 
the angry, the fearful, the lost

breathing in deeply, 
wrapping it all in snowlike stillness. 
and then breathing out

breathing out compassion, 
total, unconditional, free compassion. 
the oneness that feels every feeling, 

hurts with every hurt, 
prays with every need
not judging, not holding back, 

asking for nothing in return. 
just breathing out
and listening with gratitude

to the heartbeat of my faithful dog. 
to the heartbeats of all that live. 
lost inside life itself!‘The burning flames of anger have parched the stream of my being.
The thick darkness of illusion has blinded my intelligence.
My consciousness drowns in torrents of desire.
The mountain of pride has flung me into the nether worlds.
The driving blizzard of envy has dragged me into samsara.
The demon of belief in the ego has me firmly by the throat.’

(Dilgo  Khyentse Rinpoche)  
                              [samsara = the flow of the world]                                  ]

*  

Oh Dilgo! You too? And you, 
high in the snowy mountains, in a thriving monastery, 
surrounded by devotion, love, study, meditation, prayer-

what hope for me and us, if this is what you find in you? 

Then I remember your serene and smiling face, 
untrammelled, unaffected, giving, and compassionate; 
your first thought, before and after meditation
and the seeking of those  light-clouded inner worlds, 
compassion for the world; as you in turn were taught..

what hope for me and us, what can we do –
but, read this- not with self-loathing, but compassion, 
the compassion that brought you, too, to write-

and I recall how snow, hanging from a mountain ledge, 
forms drops of water sparkling in the sun and mountain air; 
now and then, they drop; join together in a trickle; 
a little way below, a mountain stream
gurgles, laughs upon its way; 
makes a channel in the rock, splashes from the overhangs; 
further down below (silent and still from up here, but for
a single bird, wheeling, gliding, in the lower air)  
down below – a mighty river plans to form; 
how pure its water tastes. 

Dear me! You wax and wane 
Akin to moon 
Display a crescent to full 
Differ lovingly day by day.  
A no-moon day too gives 
The longing to watch 
A nascent frill on sky next day. 





He is a Buffalo of distinction
As he lumbers on uneven ground
He knows that he is special
The handsomest beast around

Other animals of every kind
Move away when he comes close
His step is firm and constant
But he’s as elusive as a ghost 

He keeps an eye out for the ladies
And around him beaming with pride 
Are his children with wide-eyed wonder
For he has taken many brides

Yes, he is a Buffalo of distinction 
He fills up a camera lens 
I watch for him on vacation roads
As they make those twists and bends

I saw a Buffalo one day
An animal that is so immense
I was walkin’ along the road
And suddenly I grew extremely tense

I thought I’d keep on walkin’
Perhaps he wouldn’t even see 
If I was on the other side of the road
Maybe he wouldn’t notice me

I slowly crossed the road 
But the closer he became 
I thought of many escapes
But they all were pretty lame

Then he stopped completely still
I froze right where I stood
He slowly turned his massive head
And then I understood

Here came another Buffalo 
Who obviously was a lady 
Walking kind of anxiously 
And by her side was a baby

He started then toward them 
And much to my surprise 
He greeted them so lovingly 
Right before my eyes

It was a buffet to remember
With a lovely Hawaiian theme
Food so fresh and flavorful
It was truly a food critic’s dream

Shrimp so sweet and tasty
Dipping sauce perfectly mixed
The platters were so beautiful
With everything that was fixed

A pig cooked to perfection
We couldn’t wait to eat 
So much food to put on our plate
Hard to carry it to our seat 

The perfect way to celebrate
Harold’s h birthday
Grabbed our plate and filled it up
It was just like a holiday

He walks with more than one 
shadow lingering behind him.
He looks around anxiously 
with eyes that are set on
finding his next victim.
He carries a briefcase full
of notes that boast his ego.
He stops to look at you
only if you have done 
something wrong.
His words are judgmental
and quite unfair.
He knows nothing of fairness
or level-headedness.
He is a terror and will
not acknowledge his own demise.
He is a manager, a tyrant, and a buffoon. 

Feeling a coldness, like ice come upon me. 
Filling me with its essence, 
taking me into it's folds of hard white crystals, 
causing my teeth to chatter and body to shiver.
Staying here still, not wanting to go inside
just yet.
Looking to see the storm building into a formidable 
enemy of nature and man-made ingenuity, vowing to 
exterminate everything in its' way. 

A bullet for Lenin, a bullet for Trotsky, 
With love from the West; 
Go back in the time machine, 
Go back to the guillotine-
And garrote all the rest

A tear for a dictator, 
A tear for an autocrat; 
The world's tears just flow too slow, 
So let the Kings still rule-
Pretend everyone's a fool, 
Forget Presidents really blow. 

To those who never leave me alone
To them my hatred will hone
Not to something as beautiful as rain
But something filled with pain

You crush me when i begin to feel nice
Because of you my throat i want to slice
I wish to no longer drink in the air
Of this world that never was fair.

Just because I look big and dumb
Doesn't mean my feelings are numb
Even though I rarely speak
The sound of my bullet is bleak. 

A bumblebee had hitched a ride
by hanging on the starboard side
of Russia's pride, the Aeroflot
right near the engine where it's hot.

The captain got her in the air, 
flew straight into the sun's hot glare.
And then they climbed into the sky
to heights where normal creatures die.

The bumblebee had been a shade
of gray and black, like gatorade.
But soon, when covered with fine ice
resembled modified white rice.

The frost cut into his thin skin
and quickly travelled further in.
And once the plane reached  altitude
the stowaway, still cold and nude

if saved, a better bumblebee.
and did not trust them anymore, 

regardless of their place of birth
or what their role was on this earth.
They lied, all critters and their masters
in peace and threatening disasters.

Please save me, was the standard plea
it was to be or not to be.
they all returned to human need

who  would forget their obligation
and practice wanton fornication.
The bumblebee who had good ears
still hung there, though consumed by fears, 

when engine trouble hit the Boeing
it was a question now of knowing
what happens when they all just die.
The bee then heard the pilot cry.

And soon, the bird had to descend
no power meant a bitter end.
The bumblebee let go and flew
right past (he saw the frantic crew) .

With wings designed for tempered flight
he soared, it really was a sight! 
But when he reached four hundred knots
he heard, and felt the heat of shots, 

He saw them now, all hunting duck
well, I'll be damned, they've gone amuck,  
they might just hit me in the head
and I will surely be quite dead.

His wings were burning from the speed
the belly skin  began to bleed.
So in an act of desperation
he used some clever gravitation

and grabbed a bullet, thirty-eight.
It was in an ascending state
and hit its target in the chest, 
right through the mallard's silver crest.

Inside the heart it was quite pleasant, 
it smelled of duck, perhaps of pheasant.
The bumblebee revived its blood
and then they landed, with a thud.

He stood, expelled by the contraction
called ventricle ejection fraction.
And as he stretched he heard a noise
and then a hunter's frightened voice.

The plane was now a fireball
and passengers and crew, they all
just perished in a blessed minute.
'Thank  Destiny, I wasn't in it.'

As you can see, this tale is odd.
had found a friend in destiny

There was a little bumblebee
he went down on his bumble knee
this message caused her much dismay
new friend remarked 'you humble me'.

I will not let you wander free
your work is here and you must breed
to plant in me that precious seed
lest all your steps a stumble be.

So bumblebee did stumble free
got off his little bumbleknee
and hand in hand with his new lover
took to the air, briefly to hover
their wings a constant mumble, see? 

And both our poofter bumblebees
had taken with them rumble keys
to apprehend and smash their bones
so they became two tumblebees. 

I'm out to find to get them, 
Some fresh nuts.
I'm out to find to get some, 
Those fresh nuts.
I'm out to find to get them.
A bunch of fresh nuts. 
From under suburban skies.

In the cities they have crushed the best nuts.
And a mess was left for us to clean up.
But the nuts that were untouched, 
Were given opportunities. 
To flee.
And take away what they pleased. 
To crack and snap in private.

I'm out to find to get them, 
Some fresh nuts.
I'm out to find to get some, 
Those fresh nuts.
I'm out to find to get them.
A bunch of fresh nuts. 
From under suburban skies.

I'm out to find to get them, 
Some fresh nuts.
I'm out to find to get some, 
Those fresh nuts.
I'm out to find to get them.
A bunch of fresh nuts. 
From under suburban skies. 

I love life but does life love me when I have to cook
tea for a family of three.
One wants this and one wants that and between
those wants I have to feed the cat.
Then the cat up's her nose and walks away
Why should I worry it's only a stray
A black and white moggy that the kids brought home
they felt sorry for it because it was all alone.
Now I am the owner of this fussy old cat
that's made its bed in my best Sunday hat.
I love life but does life love me, when I go
out shopping and the kids think its a spending spree.
One wants this and one wants that and between
those wants there's no time for a chat.
I meet a friend I have not seen seen for ages
when we talk about the past the kids go into rages
Come on Mum its time to go home, if Dads tea is not
ready he will have a moan.
I love life but does life love me when I come home
from shopping and have to start the tea.
No time for a cuppa just rushed of my feet and the 
kids go off with their skateboards into the street.
Two shouting loud the youngest crying, can't see whats
a matter the eggs are frying.
I love life but does life love me when I'me up the hospital
and having scrapped the tea; a bump on the head and two
bloody noses, I wish someone would send me a Bunch of
Roses.A Burdock—clawed my Gown—
Not Burdock's—blame—
But mine—
Who went too near
The Burdock's Den—

A Bog—affronts my shoe—
What else have Bogs—to do—
The only Trade they know—
The splashing Men!
Ah, pity—then!

'Tis Minnows can despise!
The Elephant's—calm eyes
Look further on

Today I had a burial of my dead. 
There was no shroud, no coffin, and no pall, 
No prayers were uttered and no tears were shed 
I only turned a picture to the wall. 

A picture that had hung within my room 
For years and years; a relic of my youth. 
It kept the rose of love in constant bloom 
To see those eyes of earnestness and truth. 

At hours wherein no other dared intrude, 
I had drawn comfort from its smiling grace. 
Silent companion of my solitude, 
My soul held sweet communion with that face. 

I lived again the dream so bright, so brief, 
Though wakened as we all are by some Fate; 
This picture gave me infinite relief, 
And did not leave me wholly desolate. 

To-day I saw an item, quite by chance, 
That robbed me of my pitiful poor dole: 
A marriage notice fell beneath my glance, 
And I became a lonely widowed soul. 

With drooping eyes, and cheeks a burning flame, 
I turned the picture to the blank wall's gloom. 
My very heart had died in me of shame, 
If I had left it smiling in my room. 

Another woman's husband. So, my friend, 
My comfort, my sole relic of the past, 
I bury thee, and, lonely, seek the end. 
Swift age has swept my youth from me at last. 

There is
A burned out
Light
Inside of my heart


A BURNING MOUNTAIN


Early morning, I greeted the day with smile
As I'm riding on my motor cycle for a mile
When on my way I saw a great dancing fire
devouring the mountain's forest with desire.

When 'm getting near to the mount's serenity
After I traversed the high mountain's tapestry
Clouds of smoke was all over haunting me 
with ball of fire  really trying to go after me. 

I have to stop and wait  long till I can see
my way as clouds of dust was all over me; 
After an hour of waiting there so patiently
I saw vehicles hundred feet waiting like me.

As I passed, fires was still burning heavily
and wind kept on blowing against the fire's fury; 
then I heard explosion of bamboos not far away

As I lament for the forest being eaten by the fire
I saw birds and other wildlife flee from the fire; 
I prayed for the rain to shower its saving grace
to save the mountain's remaining forest base.

In my little way to save the mountain's beauty
I tried to put some flames of fire about to fry
the other side of the road as other passers by
tried to build fire line not to let the other side cry.
 
Stop burning our forest to save nature's beauty
to protect us from nature's own furious fury 
of claiming justice against men's great cruelty
of destroying and exploiting nature's tapestry. 

Under the umbrella 
Of a starry night
When the bright Moon above
Was happily smiling, 
You and I became one
Rolling all over our nest
Turned into a paradise! 

A night of ecstasy: 
My barren lips
Anxiously tasting the magic
Of your ardent kisses
While my hungry fingers
Passionately explored
Your soft and shaking body
With desire and passion! 
Oh, what a night! 

Time passed rapidly
And the Earth stood still
Just like our exhausted bodies
Laying down as one.
The Moon and stars were gone
And we found the night to be 
Too short to continue
This excited journey! 

A new day arrived, 
A real golden Sunshine 
But we could hardly wait
For another beautiful night
To start again where we left off
In a reservoir of lust and love! 


New York City


Out of a fired ship, which by no way
  But drowning could be rescued from the flame,
  Some men leap'd forth, and ever as they came
  Near the foes' ships, did by their shot decay;
  So all were lost, which in the ship were found,
    They in the sea being burnt, they in the burnt ship drown'd. 

Weeping into the future, tears filling pools to overflowing, because of a friend's betrayal.
Heart bursting with grief over the loss of the best friend I've ever had in life.
Being thrown away like yesterday's garbage, hurting to the core of my being, taking me away from a life I cannot live any longer. 

A Bus Ride 
I took the bus into town today its passengers were
mostly elderly, old women and generally fat as women 
of the land tend to be, busy feeding the family they 
spend too much time in the kitchen yes, I was the oldest
but would not like to have slept with any of them
and according to their lack of interest in me, it was mutual.
That is ok; they are good at putting flowers on graves. 
I was not buying much just wanted to get out of the house
I will be moving there it`s good to know where the cheapest 
lunch cafes are situated, that`s where the Portuguese 
bank staff and workers go both groups are equally bad paid.
Going home three hours later the same women on board they 
were animated had bought skirts, blouses, and shoes at
 the Chines shop less than half the price of ordinary shops
theirs had been a good day. 

On the outer Barcoo where the churches are few,
And men of religion are scanty,
On a road never cross'd 'cept by folk that are lost,
One Michael Magee had a shanty.

Now this Mike was the dad of a ten-year-old lad,
Plump, healthy, and stoutly conditioned;
He was strong as the best, but poor Mike had no rest
For the youngster had never been christened.

And his wife used to cry, 'If the darlin' should die
Saint Peter would not recognize him.'
But by luck he survived till a preacher arrived,
Who agreed straightaway to baptize him.

Now the artful young rogue, while they held their collogue,
With his ear to the keyhole was listenin';
And he muttered in fright, while his features turned white,
'What the divil and all is this christenin'?'

He was none of your dolts, He had seen them brand colts,
And it seemed to his small understanding,
If the man in the frock made him one of the flock,
It must mean something very like branding.

So away with a rush he set off for the bush,
While the tears in his eyelids they glistened,
''Tis outrageous,' says he, 'to brand youngsters like me;
I'll be dashed if I'll stop to be christened!'

Like a young native dog he ran into a log,
And his father with language uncivil,
Never heeding the 'praste', cried aloud in his haste
'Come out and be christened, you divil!'

But he lay there as snug as a bug in a rug,
And his parents in vain might reprove him,
Till his reverence spoke (he was fond of a joke)
'I've a notion,' says he, 'that'll move him.

'Poke a stick up the log, give the spalpeen a prog;
Poke him aisy, don't hurt him or maim him;
'Tis not long that he'll stand, I've the water at hand,
As he rushes out this end I'll name him.

'Here he comes, and for shame, ye've forgotten the name,
Is it Patsy or Michael or Dinnis?'
Here the youngster ran out, and the priest gave a shout,
'Take your chance, anyhow, wid `Maginnis'!'

As the howling young cub ran away to the scrub
Where he knew that pursuit would be risky,
The priest, as he fled, flung a flask at his head
That was labeled 'Maginnis's Whiskey'!

Now Maginnis Magee has been made a J. 

P.,
And the one thing he hates more than sin is
To be asked by the folk, who have heard of the joke,
How he came to be christened Maginnis

When Ironbark the turtle came to Anthony's lagoon 
The hills were hid behind a mist of equinoctal rain, 
The ripple of the rivulets was like a cheerful tune 
And wild companions waltzed among the grass as tall as grain. 
But Ironbark the turtle cared no whit for all of these; 
The ripple of the rivulets, the rustle of the trees 
Were only apple sauce to him, or just a piece of cheese. 

Now, Dan-di-dan the water rat was exquisitely dressed, 
For not a seal in Bass's Straits had half as fine a coat, 
And every day he combed and brushed his golden-yellow vest, 
A contrast with the white cravat he wore beneath his throat. 

And Dan-di-dan the water rat could move with ease and grace, 
So Ironbark appeared to him a creature out of place, 
With iron-plated overcoat and dirty little face. 

A crawfish at the point of death came drifting down the drains. 
Said he, "I'm scalded to the heart with bathing near the bore
 

The turtle and the water rat disputed his remains, 
For crawfish meat all day they'd eat, and then they'd ask for more. 

Said Dan-di-dan, "The prize is mine, for I was fishing here 
Before you tumbled down the bank and landed on your ear
 

"I wouldn't care," the turtle said, "if you'd have fished a year
 


So Baggy-beak the Pelican was asked to arbitrate; 
The scales of justice seemed to hang beneath his noble beak. 
He said, "I'll take possession of the subject of debate"; 
He stowed the fish inside his pouch and then began to speak. 

"The case is far from clear," he said, "and justices of note" -- 
But here he snapped his beak and flapped his piebald overcoat -- 
"Oh dear," he said, "that wretched fish has slithered down my throat
 


"But still," he said, "the point involved requires a full debate. 
I'll have to get the lawyer birds and fix a special day. 
Ad interim I rule that costs come out of the estate
 

And Baggy-beak the Pelican got up and flew away. 

So both the pair who went to law were feeling very small. 
Said they, "We might have halved the fish and saved a nasty brawl; 
For half a crawfish isn't much, but more than none at all

"I’M travellin’ down the Castlereagh, and I’m a station hand, 
I’m handy with the ropin’ pole, I’m handy with the brand, 
And I can ride a rowdy colt, or swing the axe all day, 
But there’s no demand for a station-hand along the Castlereagh. + 

So it’s shift, boys, shift, for there isn’t the slightest doubt 
That we’ve got to make a shift to the stations further out, 
With the pack-horse runnin’ after, for he follows like a dog, 
We must strike across the country at the old jig-jog. 

This old black horse I’m riding—if you’ll notice what’s his brand, 
He wears the crooked R, you see—none better in the land. 
He takes a lot of beatin’, and the other day we tried, 
For a bit of a joke, with a racing bloke, for twenty pounds a side. 

It was shift, boys, shift, for there wasn’t the slightest doubt 
That I had to make him shift, for the money was nearly out; 
But he cantered home a winner, with the other one at the flog— 
He’s a red-hot sort to pick up with his old jig-jog. 

I asked a cove for shearin’ once along the Marthaguy: 
"We shear non-union here," says he. "I call it scab," says I. 
I looked along the shearin’ floor before I turned to go— 



It was shift, boys, shift, for there wasn’t the slightest doubt 
It was time to make a shift with the leprosy about. 
So I saddled up my horses, and I whistled to my dog, 
And I left his scabby station at the old jig-jog. 

I went to Illawarra, where my brother’s got a farm, 
He has to ask his landlord’s leave before he lifts his arm; 
The landlord owns the country side—man, woman, dog, and cat, 
They haven’t the cheek to dare to speak without they touch their hat. 

It was shift, boys, shift, for there wasn’t the slightest doubt 
Their little landlord god and I would soon have fallen out; 
Was I to touch my hat to him?—was I his bloomin’ dog? 
So I makes for up the country at the old jig-jog. 

But it’s time that I was movin’, I’ve a mighty way to go 
Till I drink artesian water from a thousand feet below; 
Till I meet the overlanders with the cattle comin’ down, 
And I’ll work a while till I make a pile, then have a spree in town. 

So, it’s shift, boys, shift, for there isn’t the slightest doubt 
We’ve got to make a shift to the stations further out; 
The pack-horse runs behind us, for he follows like a dog, 
And we cross a lot of country at the old jig-jog. 

Things did look good, 
the reasonableness
was palpable that day.
Only that fellow Murphy
and his blasted Law
had infiltrated the territory
and breached perimeters
that should have been taboo.

And so I signed the  papers, 
and was assured the mechandise
with all the trimmings would arrive
to be received with joyful heart

And when I left he'd stayed behind
to do his dirtywork and throw a spanner
into the works, all unbeknownst to me.
The merchandise arrived, so I was told
but would be late by two, three days, 
there was a tiny glitch that needed fixing.

It turned out differently, my friends. 
The glitch was major and I ascertained
what had been happening, in dark of night, 
such a defect and all the tampering with it
did make it unacceptable, that much was clear.

What followed was a skirmish, followed by
more of the same, each with more fire, 
and when the war was over in a week
it first appeared unclear as to which side
had won the mother of all battles here, 

it was the day that all the ammunition, 
all bullets had been spent and  hit their targets.
That day will be tomorrow, it's a Monday, 

A Bus Ride
 I had bought a newspaper in town and was taking the bus home, 
 a half an hours ride up to my village.  I looked at the headlines 
and noticed the paper had no date, were I reading yesterday’s 
today`s news or tomorrow`s?  The bus was empty this afternoon 
and it struck how silent it ran could only hear the swishing sound of
 rubber against the asphalted road.
Then the bus stopped for the first time on this journey outside 
my house, so many flowers now in November, my dog sat on
 the steps waiting just for me. The bus door opened with a sigh, 
but the dog didn`t run to me.  I hesitated something was wrong it
 was the same house, yet not the same this one looked immaterial
the flowers were pale; this was a copy or a painting forgotten at
 a rural art exhibition arranged by a local culturally interested GP.
 Not my village, I said to the driver and sat down 
"Are you sure? " the driver asked I didn’t answer and the bus rolled on.
 Opened the newspaper it now had the right day and it was Monday. 

No man has relished more than I;
I've been so goldarned busy living
I've never had the time to die.
So busy fishing, hunting, roving,
Up on my toes and fighting fit;
So busy singing, laughing, loving,
I've never had the time to quit.

I've never been one for thinking
I've always been the action guy;
I've done my share of feasting, drinking,
And lots of wenching on the sly.
What all the blasted cosmic show meant,
I've never tried to understand;
I've always lived just for the moment,
And done the thing that came to hand.

And now I'll toddle to the garden
And light a good old Henry Clay.
My frequent lapses by the way.
I'm getting tired; the sunset lingers;
The evening star serenes the sky;
The damn cigar burns to my fingers . . .
I guess . . . I'll take . . . time off . . . to die. 

Shameless, nude always invites
To outrage her modesty, 
Smooth and grey 
who would not be
The victim of her
charm, 
Pleased with being invaded 
Yet wishes them to lessen
their intensity, 
In search of peace most blameless Yet always ready for retribution, 
Like a great saint who never minds to take
The burden of their sin, 
Bearing the rage of elements and lost in her silence, 
Like a harlot baring her bosom to all, 
Welcomes each new and old visitor, 
But ah! 
Has anyone ever tried to descend in her emotions? 
Still looks all the time so fresh and so new. 

I just get an order and delegate
it to my luminiscent wings
and feel motion alone is real
that propels my child-like passion
to flit to what attracts only
the eyes but never absorbs me in
to show me who I am and why it calls
to me. 

A butterfly flutters
its wings of delight
in the soft gentel breeze
it flickers to life
its colours like rainbows
flash briefly for a day
in fields full of colours
they spread wings
and fly away
they hover in midflight
it finds its mate for life
and they become one
in the midsummer sun
then together they climb
dazzling, turning
Ecstasy of delight
climaxing on high
impregnating new life
then finding a leaf
to lay down their eggs
flutter drifting
from flower to leaf
exhausted from joining
they slowly flutter down
and glide together
with one final flight
and there they lay 
both colours so bright
slowly fade into
Mother Natures 
garden of life


-Ubiquitous is He who holds our breath in His hands- 
by Mandolyn Does the moon talk back to the night 
when it says to stop walking around in boxers? 
And when the moon is fully dressed 
does it mess with the stars? Do the hands of our Creator 
spank that disco ball and tell it to sit in the corner? 
all things- when we sneeze we believe it comes from 
allergies, but no 
it is His gentle way of saying hello, come smell the 
breeze y'all. 
He's a cowboy too when He wants to be. 
The trees He has lasso'd and given free will 
to be still, 

but let's keep this real 
fun and formative, F the rules of pretty prose.  

The universe is His trebuchet- he launches love 
from all corners of the cosmos- watches with delight 
as hearts are hit 
and eyes are met 
while the land beneath our feet 
arches, moving with each breath~

I was peeking from my cave one day 
And I saw a man coming this way 
I've known for long his name is Moses 
I heard it once as he gave his wife roses 

As he walked in a daze I saw him staring 
His steps never wavered in their bearing 
I turned to see where he was looking 
And I saw a bright bush that was cooking 

As Moses got near I heard the bush call 
A noise from a bush? I thought I would fall 
'Take off your shoes' I heard it say 
Off came my shoes and they flew away 

Great words I heard from a burning bush 
At the force of them I fell on my tush 
'I Am that I Am' He named Himself 
At that sound I became a frightened elf 

What right have I, a simple small creature 
To hear the words from such a great speaker 
I was sure in a moment I would turn to dust 
Or with pounding in my chest my heart would bust 

But while the words I heard had great power 
They flowed over me like the fragrance of a flower 
They flowed like a cool spring calming me totally 
And rang in my ears like some great poetry 

I don't remember the commands that he gave with care 
On Moses head shining white changed all his hair 
But I was blessed as He calmed all my fears

on this Teacher divine 
stake I my dearest will- 
upon Him who wrote 
my frame with His 
pen of Light; 

and on the tiny fibres 
of my heart 
wrote He the equation 
that sets in motion - 
the wheels of life. 

I, on scrambled Letters 
that bore my unbalanced 
weight, tottered - 
till promises 
like horses became.  

and on this cart of life 
I ride back and forth to earth 
from Eden - garden of my birth, 
whose verdure drinks of the wellness 
drawn from living wells.

he paints the vaulted skies over the seas 
he carves the golden shore 
and the dunes of the deserts etched by his breath 
that blows forevermore 

he writes in a tiny grain by the fields 
he scribbles in green of the leaves 
he writes in the gloom of the mortal beings 
and in joy a man receives 

still there are things we will never know 
with what brush or pen he writes 
and how he makes those flakes of snow 
and how he paints those nights 

haikus he writes in a tiny rose 
sonnets in a mountain tall 
in the trees he writes his eternal prose 
he is a master poet after all 

furious, he paints a raging storm 
when calm, the raining noon 
when gay, he makes those seasons warm 
when sad, the waning moon 

not all can read the work of the gods 
not always do we have to stare above 
the poems that he writes are everywhere 
that's deep like true hearts in love

ME: 

The Holy Ghost a mystery was, but Father was the Creator; so was the buzz. 

I believed in Him once, but now I feel He might OR might not be. 
I'll write this, a little tongue-in-cheek, as though in Him I still believe. 
He may be omni-this and omni-that, and for me I'm sure He will grieve. 



'To my main man Moses I once gave ten rules for Man to follow. 
Now (more than they were years ago) , to many Earthlings, my rules are hollow. 
My idea to send my Son (by a virgin)                       was too theatrical, now I see, 
but the biggest mistake I ever made was to let Mankind's 'will' be 'free'. 

Please believe Me when I say 'I meant no harm in any way! ' 
I should have killed Satan when I could, rather than just say 'Take a hike.' 
I meant well; long ago I truly did. I had such hope for Adam and Eve. 
The mess their kids have made of Earth makes Me now wish to take My leave. 

I'd start over once again, but I'm too old; like an iron nail I've turned to rust. 

As for my other rules, which were ten, I don't even remember all of them. 
Men AND women take My Name in vain. The Sabbath's not my wished-for gem. 
Kids dishonor their parents and vice versa. You covet neighbor's wives, and worse. 
You kill for greed and just for fun. You steal from private and public purse. 

I've had better luck on other worlds. I guess I let humans' brains get too BIG. 
I should have stopped Evolution's 'progress' 
. when the 'top dog' was a PIG.' 


ME: 

He was Kind, Mighty, Smart and Such, but He tried to handle just too damn much.'

‘Painting is poetry that is seen rather than felt 
and poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen' 

- Leonardo da Vinci 

From my window I lazily watch 
The phenomenal transition from dusk to night 
The evening's brilliance giving way to twilight haze 
And the reddened sky turning sallow as a sick patient 
Darkness like downy feathers descending down 
Wrapping the Earth in a gray woolen mantle 
Light and darkness embracing in a breathless kiss 
Like shocking colors blended on a wide canvas! 

If painting is poetry that is seen than felt 
With grandeur and beauty melded in rhyme 
Oh, poetry is painting that is felt than seen 

The night has now grown mysterious and enigmatic 
Putting the weary Nature into indolent repose 

Before my eyes stretch a vast plane 
Whose boundaries have dimmed beyond all trace 
Here and there, some monstrous shapes peek out 
I see the dark silhouettes of trees supine 
Brooding, sage like, in the thickening gloom 
I watch the wide panorama lying still 
And the clear star spangled sky above 

The moon has begun her stately round 
In flashing dress, she swaggers past the clouds 
As if patrolling to guard the sleeping Earth 
She has taken the place of the ousted king of the day 
And countless stars are with her as entourage! 
She comes down even to the fringy margin of the sky 
To dole out blessings to all below her domain 

All those who watch the beauty of a clear night sky 

A calming breeze caresses my face and ruffles my hair 
Though darkness envelops all around me 
I hear the whispered promise of a day that shall soon unfold 
As I hear this rhythm of Nature falling in my ears 


I feel heaven has descended down to Earth 
Never is a moment more glorious than this 
When darkness has accentuated the heavenly lights! 

I stand enraptured and stunningly awestruck 
Turning every page of this wide note pad 
In wonderful images and such exquisite rhythm

Webmaster's Notes: No novice of the written word, Valsa knows clearly that she stands on the shoulders of Giants, and invokes the authority of da Vinci from the get go. But is it mere poetic license to insist that paintings are felt too as they in fact press themselves on our imaginations. And poems too perhaps are seen in the mind's eye, conjured by the poet's heart. Dare we quibble with the master? 

I would have liked more exaggeration, more dance in the first stanza Valsa perhaps with something like

Opaque darkness falls like downy feathers, 
Smothers remaining wisps of light, 
Enveloping the quiescent Earth
In a snowy blanket whose chilling aspirations, 
None the less protect its flanks from bitter cold, 
Opposites embracing in a breathless kiss, 
Like shocking colors losing themselves


The fourth stanza continues the mystery with suggestions of shapes that never quite materialize, but how I would have loved to have been confronted with the fact that only with cameras are we able to grok the colors of galaxies, of distant stars, Science giving us new eyes to see with and ears as well, new realities crowding in from all sides, the light too faint for us to see color at all on our own, sounds too distant for us to hear as well.

Before the universe's whole potential, 
All that is today, flashed into existence, 
In less than one millionth of a single second, 
(A single thought of your incredible imagination) , 
Felt the potential of my entire life on earth, 
And called it good, pleasing in Your sight.
Though by your written commandments
And my own short comings, 
I am nothing but a condemned soul, 
Yet Grace reconciles us, and leaves me white as snow

So today, Once again I come, 
Not to weep before you or present a petition, 
Nor have I come to delay your great commission, 
But to meditate, Yes! and to celebrate, 
Of one thing, which my fellow poets 
Have recently written in wonder and such beauty 
That surpasses all their previous works. 

It is not life, neither is it death, 
It is not love neither is it nature, 
Not of sadness nor happiness, 

Yes! it is your poetry, which today I pick as my theme 
Not to gain material riches nor fame, 
But to explore your uniqueness, 
The beauty of your creation and your perfection. 
For all other themes are nothing, 
But a mere way of gratifying mortals 
And the expression of our satisfaction. 

It is clear, and I see, with absolute attention, 
that your poetry too is beautifully written 
in the beauty of earthly nature. 
When I gaze at the vastness of the ocean, 
The beauty of the sea, 
the magic performed by the breeze, 
When I look right into the forest, 
The conference of animals, 
The pattern of the groove, 
The heat of the sun beams, 
The whiteness of the snow, 
And above all, the prudence of the ant, 

It is written with perfect skills, 
Colorful imagery 
And mind-blowing patterns, 
No fault nor breaks, 
But it flows, with such beauty 
That only attests to the handiwork 
Of a great architect, a great designer 
And indeed, a master poet of all time. 

Your poetry is infinite, 
Because you have no end, 
Your poetry is beautiful, 
Because you are beautiful too, 
Your poetry is perfect, 
Because you are perfect too, 
Your poetry is filled with passion, 
Because you invented the power 
To use and control diction. 

The simple beauty of your sunlight, 
Blinds us to other solutions, 
Your poetry in its perfection, 
Makes the sublime seem plain.          




An eagle finds the highest mountain to build its nest
And lays the first layer of nest with sharp objects
Such as thorns and stones for the unborn with zest
And next, covering that layer with soft targets, 
Such as wood, feathers and the animal fur.
So as the baby birds are hatched, gets protection.
As they grew a bit, the mother eagle takes 
The nest materials and mixes them up.
The jumbled mass is now a mix of sharp and soft
And sometimes sharp edges may cut babies' skin.
And next, the mother stops putting food 
From her mouth to the mouths of the babies.
Making their comfortable world into painful one.
The discomfort becomes so great for the babies
They begin to fly away to get out of the nest.

We don't seek god when happy and comfortable
We turn to him only in times of troubles.
It's a wake-up call to teach every one of us
Not too much indulge in physical comforts.
That this life is painful and full of sufferings
And its solution is to soar in spiritual realms.




To dance on the pin tip of my understanding
I delight in words
All things came into existance through my words
The planets
The stars
The moon
The sun
The universes beyond what you can see
They are tethered by my imagination




'Now all of my children born and reborn in this world, 
I will be your parent, grand teacher, and protector.
Know you are part of me as your earthly body is unfurled.

Fragrant flowers should be known as your sister and brother.
Breathe in deeply of the varied glorious tree's blessed breath; 
A gift from me, your omnipotent father and mother.

Each season praises that divine dominion of poetry.
With each season new life emerges with the beginning of spring
Into the warmth of summer across verdant fields and forestry.

Do not fear as I cause autumn season's winds to blow
In seeming wrath, set upon colorful trees, leaves are freed
To invite winter and the blessings of new fallen snow.

Receive my blessing of light that opens a direct path to me.
Let it shine bright in your life, in all that you say and do.
Share your delight of this blessing through inspired poetry.

Be aware of your words for they embrace the real you.
Others may be hurt by careless words spoken.
Remember, words mean as much as your actions do.

Any kindness you display by reaching out to those in need
Is always a welcome gift and returned to you in kind, 
Only in much more abundance to help YOU succeed.

As you question the heavenly stars in their distant galaxies
The answers lie within yourself, if you will be still and meditate.
You may seek the truth in your own mind for life's realities.

I am near you always, within and without, have no doubt.
I only wish you love and happiness, even though I know
You must experience difficult times to learn what life's about.

For you are my child and I rejoice in lessons you've learned of.
Teach your children to revere and love me, not fear me, 
I'm here to guide and protect them, for you see, I am LOVE! '

Please put your trust in me both below and above
For my divine power and glory is centered in love.



I look down with eyes so clear
On all of life that be so dear
And I see all you folk down there
Looking, looking everywhere
Trying to reach me knowing not
That I am everything, the lot
I am all you'll ever be 
I be thee, and you be me.

You look at me with love, and fear
But have you got the message clear
That if you want to seek me out
Do not look you all about
Just take a look so deep within
Take a search beneath your din
Then you'll find the whisper there
Lately it's a thing so rare

When you find me you will know
The whole of you will wear a glow
Peace and harmony will shine
You'll know me then the one divine
They'll be no inner wars for you
You'll be a light that shines on through
Touching others, changing them
A mystic one, a shining gem.


O ever changing sky, blue-gray and maudlin
your mood and unsettled ways, meld with mine.
Clouds seem but blemishes upon horizons
as weary as the soot smudged cheeks of urchins.
Bruised in hues at once fresh with pain and longing, 
not yet healed by the riper rise of next day's bloom.

O ever changing sky, the nascent forest's buds.
Its lashes linger in the purple poignancy of dusk
and whip thy brow with thrashing maple limbs.
Eyeless vault of heaven cry for me, release my plight
erase with thy wonders this tattered visage so forlorn.
The sky of night holds many jewels of delight.

O ever changing sky, clear to crisper shades of sapphire, 
ping with shooting stars and glowing diadems of light.
Let lavender blue soften my sorrows for I like Merope* 
need Orion's might to lift my heartache, to point the way.
May thy constant rebirth give hope which melds with mine
and brings a beauty brighter than your Venus** to the day.


From the painted skies of morning
To the starlight of the night, 
Whether day is just aborning
Or in fading of the light, 
In the summer days of sunshine
Or in winter days of white, 
His awed children to delight
With his awesome show of might.

But the springtime, oh the springtime
Is the best of all the seasons.
It is favored by the Father
For he finds so many reasons
To adore it and adorn it, 
With the beauty of the flowers
That are everywhere in springtime, 
In the warming springtime hours, 
Sublimely bathed in springtime showers.

For an imagination: Does one need a word? 
I don't think so. I think that's absurd! 
When one dreams, do words abound? 
Do words in a sleeper's brain 
. 

go around? 
I don't think so. 

Of course I'm open to different thoughts on this; 
if you disagree, 


your opinion I'll not diss. 
I've dreamed in color, and I guess white and black, 
but when I dream or imagine, I think 'words' I lack. 
I think so. 

If I imagine scoops of ice cream piled high, 
I don't think I need words; I'll tell you why. 
I just ‘feel': 'Yummy! ', perhaps; I KNOW I drool. 
Do I need, for a thought/image, 


a word for a tool? 
I don't think so! 

Did Eve and Adam, that legendary pair, 
use words? I don't know. I wasn't there. 
But I'd guess they had an image, post apple-eating, 

I (ha ha)                               believe THAT! 


Words are the colors painted on imagination's canvas, 
Even the brightest pigments are black and white without them, 
Like motion pictures before Technicolor and , 
Like a three dimensional landscape made flat by binoculars, 
However grand the venue might be, 
Be it stellar in its aspect (infinite in scope) , or a single flower, 
The miracle of a butterfly's wings unfolding, 
Or the crossing of the bridge from potential to plausible life -
The scientist's view of a human egg's fertilization.

Words are the perfumes that dazzle the senses as fingers touch
The multi-textured surface of a woman's flesh, 
From the sharpness of teeth, nails, and tongue, 
To the softness of her desire to merge with you, 
So close that her heart's rhythms impact you like earth's seasons, 
The ocean's waves, the moon's tides, and a bird's song, 
The keys that strike chords of passion, igniting the heart, 
And cause the soul to resonate till you fear it must shatter
Like fine crystal in the face of a symphonic onslaught.

Words are the father's strong voice of praise, 
The mother's intimate, watchful lullaby, 
Non-verbal words of assurance, warmth of a brother's hand, 
The resounding joy of a sister's laugh, the essence of family.


Perspeucitous, 'tis a harsh word. 
One's thoughts get blurred 
and talk turns rude. 
Some tend to brood. 

Some people are antriphinal - 
not short on bull 
'Peanut, ' they yell 
'Who cracked your shell? 

Stretching, I might be four-foot-six 
I've learned to fix 
the wixumph jokes 
of thoughtless blokes. 

When perspeucitous meets wixumph, 
I can triumph, 
remaining cold - 
mood quite controlled. 

Vursichomy! I call the shots, 
connect the dots. 
When chaps condemn, 
toss words to them. 

Drives them to the edge - somatrise, 
A little spice 
'tworks well enough 
to call their bluff.

Imagination is fascinating, 
At the heart of what makes a lie seem real, 
A gossamer dream that suggests a truth never before envisaged
Our mind's simplistic purity sacrificed as we
Like Adam & Eve ultimately share the apple, 
Making room in our hearts for both the lie and the dream.

Great achievements can arise from misunderstandings, 
Beautiful dreams lead to destruction.
What we imagine can become real for us, 
For today's reality was someone's imagination yesterday..

But of what value is imagination without words to share it, 
Can a series of mental images ever be a poem? 
Words define, make shareable, make imagination's music memorable, 
Like a poem frames and focuses attention on human feelings
How can the world taste my imagination if I don't cook it with words? 
Words then, are not just the heart, but the very soul of imagination.



Have you ever seen a unicorn? 
I can see one every day 
And fairies, giants and dragons 
are always getting in the way 

There are worlds that can't exist 
that I like to visit when I can 
And farms with talking pigs 
screaming to escape their pen 

At the end of a leprechaun's rainbow 
a little girl finds golden riches 
Heroes with gleaming magic swords 
go to battle with evil witches 

I can find most anything 
even a pauper who would be king 
From a ring to rule them all 
to a dragon who loves to sing 

With the right words chosen 
and written in just the right way 
There is nothing that can't be real 
or a place you can not play 

Romance, mystery, and magic 
flowing through every word 
pumping your heart with adventure 
so that spot in your brain is stirred 

The precious words of an author 
are the heart of imagination 
Nutrition for the soul 
food for the minds digestion




When lilly kisses rose 
and lilly I did know 
and trees I thought 
grew very deep 
and lived 
within the forest. 

And green 
the hay is sweet 
and brown 
dry moss cries 
why. 

And lillies white 
remind the sky 
blue cotton 
clouds they swirl. 

There grew the two. 
so dear 
most thought. 

Short breath 
two centered 
scents. 

And how 
before 
them both 
I stood 
once near 
their hearts 
too far. 

And when 
I know 
how 
roses grow 
and pressed 
so hard 
was I. 

And cups 
of milk 
I loaned to 
them 
cinnamon 
and spice. 

Sugar sweets 
they made 
from them 
and 
now to know 
both why. 

While 
lilly bridged 
sweet roses 
bank as 
water rushes 
by.



Monkey dreams, sex, more sex, 
Banana nice too, 
Once in a while! 
Tastes better though
When cute butt peels for me
Too much rain, 
Smell like stale carpet
Who will groom me now? 

Something big comes, 
Sure not stinky me! 
Haul my ass up tree! 
Dominant males
Chest thumping braggarts
Really stink I think! 

Whoo Whoo Whooee! 
Cute butt three trees over! 
Maybe she wet too
No notice stinky me
Mistake me for brother
Until too late! Whooee! 

Oh Wow! (thumping chest!)       
Sweet, sweet, sweet, treat! 
Was it good for you too cute butt? 
Oh yes, right there! ! Hmmmm! 
You can groom me anytime


Like a creature hibernating in its burrow
Waiting to come out with the first verdure of spring
The seed of a poem lay dormant in my heart
Through the long winter awaiting another spring

After staying torpid inside for long
At a time I expected it the least
Timidly came out the first word
As shaky as a calf getting up for the first time

Then another came and word after word in a row
Like pellets of rain on the window pane
I boiled them in the crucibles of my imagination
And finally dipping them in the ocean of my emotions

But rhyme came to set constraints
For the right alignment I struggled
I had to decide on its texture and format
Pondered if it should be a sonnet or an ode

I might have kept the door open for long
Alas! All my words and fancies flew away
Like birds taking on wings into the sky
From a cage where they were imprisoned for long

I stood so helpless with my mouth shut
Staring blankly out into the airy nothing
Like one lost in the doorway of his own threshold
Unable to call back those winged words lost in the void

You've caught me in a bitchy mood; 
I'll try, as I type, to not be 
 too rude. 
Perhaps you'll consider that a gift. 
I don't wish to cause a poet-to-poet rift. 

Maybe I should just not now try 
to write a pleasant poem for the BJ guy, 
and the rest of you who are eager to hear 
what I've got to say once I get in gear. 

Have you ever said ‘don't speak if it ain't nice', 
[or something like that when your mood was ice]? 
But I've started and now this Bri can't quit. 
I hope this poem don't sound like a pile of s++t. 

‘cause that's what my mood was when I arose, 
after opening my eyes and wiggling my toes, 
to see if, again, I could face yet another day 
of chores and trying to do as my wife does say. 

I'll try real hard now to get in the swing 
of just typing and seeing what time will bring. 
Ah, yes. Small gifts and happiness can be nice. 
I too have given small gifts, I think once or twice 
in my lifetime to someone I thought was in need, 
and some happiness I think they brought indeed. 

A dollar or two here, a granola bar or banana there. 
A smile and perhaps a few pleasant words I've said. 
I'm a sucker for beggars**, at which most just stare; 
I may not shake their hands, but them I do not dread. 

Now, before I return to my day which is somewhat dreary, 
I'll mention a small gift I received which made me cheery. 

One evening while sorting mail or something such, 
a male coworker gave me a gift which, my heart, did touch. 
It was only a paper cup of fresh water to me he offered, 
but besides water, it was kindness to me he proffered. 

It was a small gift, most small indeed, 
and, like many gifts, it I did not need. 
Perhaps having been a prisoner of war, 
he'd been the receiver of such a gift before? 
And perhaps he felt sorry for me as I sat 
sorting mail to this address or to that. 
 



For each gift that you make to a man's spirit, 
Servant gift, not the kind that dishonor brings, 
There's a peace that comes soft. (Can your ears hear it?)        
And the heart of the man soon forgets its stings.

A first kiss from a girl that you really love, 
Like a star that in falling comes home at last, 
With a passion that witnesses truth thereof, 
The feared slap in the face just a stale forecast.

Or the one who stands with you when all have left, 
Unexpectedly present when future's die, 
Putting hand on your shoulder when you're bereft, 
Oh, the warmth that assures that this friend's no lie.

My mom's father just beamed when I'd work with him, 
And fish too, when weather did not disabuse, 
With a stink bait that made catfish prospects grim
A male mentor whose love was not there to use.

A gift notebook just meant for new poetry, 
That conveniently can stay close at hand, 
Unexpected, but still quite a treat for me, 
Home for poetic thoughts that arrive unplanned.

Taught a boy (who got nothing)         to love sharing, 
Justice bifurcates, half is Dad, half is Mom.

All the accidents waiting, in fate hiding, 
Those that never quite come to your threshold's door.
Your close calls alone - stains blood red mar the floor.

A sweet letter that comes from a love once lost
Can still channel cool water to desert's gate, 
Makes a lie ‘must defend love at any cost, '
Shouts that ‘true love abounds if just people wait.'

Each small gift lifts subsistence to fine living, 
Even though some will think it is really odd, 
Good receivers (required to complete giving)        



What's in it for me? 
he wondered. 
Too small to be socks 
that little box 
Last year she'd given him


what? 
some thingamabob- 
oh yes - a safety pin and ribbon, 
saying, ‘It's a ribbon fob 
to pin to your pocket.' 
The year before that- 
it was something flat

oh yes - a fabric square and thread. 
‘I'll vest your vest a pocket, ' 
she said. 
So this year, not unreasonably 
he wondered if that little box 
might be a pocket watch 
or key.


I was told that big things can come in small packages 
A little happiness can be a big thing 
Some people give small gifts that they think are big 
For some it could be as small as a ring 

A small thing to give could be a hug 
The warmth of two arms around you can feel 
Like the troubled world has been made right 
The security of an embrace is very real 

A word of encouragement can be what's needed 
To make a smile blossom from tears 
A small thing to give to one who's sad 
A little act to sooth one's fears 

A small token can be a big thing 
If given from true kindness and caring 
A trinket, or bauble, or just your time 
Can be the best gift for sharing 

So when you wish to share some happiness 
It isn't size that matters 
It's the small things in life that can bring the most joy 
Those that think size matters are just mad hatters


Life is nothing but a series of colorful dreams, 
A mere shadow whose motion ceases when we freeze, 
And whose reality depends on our endeavors. 

Each day, we dream of new dreams, 
And as we accomplish them, 
We continue to dream new dreams. 

But whether we accomplish our last dreams 
Is something that baffles my mind, 
For we are nothing but mere dreams 
In the mind of man's long fearful enemy. 

As each day and night gently passes, 
Like a slideshow of images on a screen, 
I pray I will be able to accomplish my last dream: 
To thank all those who contributed towards my life, 
And to give them a befitting farewell. 

This, I think will be a small but unforgettable gift 
That will remain in their memory for long 
And they would not see me as an integrate 
In their tomorrow's dreams, perhaps when we return. 


Folk ask if I'm alive,
          Most think I'm not;
Yet gaily I contrive
          To till my plot.
The world its way can go,
          I little heed,
So long as I can grow
          The grub I need.

For though long overdue,
          The years to me,
Have taught a lesson true,
          --Humility.
Such better men than I
          I've seen pass on;
Their pay-off when they die;
          --Oblivion.

And so I mock at fame,
          With books unread;
No monument I claim
          When I am dead;
Contented as I see
          My cottage thatch
That my last goal should be
          --A cabbage patch. 


THE YOUNG MASTER ASKS FOR A STORY

Whut you say, dah? huh, uh! chile,
You 's enough to dribe me wile.
Want a sto'y; jes' hyeah dat!
Whah' 'll I git a sto'y at?
Di'n' I tell you th'ee las' night?
Go 'way, honey, you ain't right.
I got somep'n' else to do,
'Cides jes' tellin' tales to you.
Tell you jes' one? Lem me see
Whut dat one's a-gwine to be.
When you 's ole, yo membry fails;
Seems lak I do' know no tales.
Well, set down dah in dat cheer,
Keep still ef you wants to hyeah.
Tek dat chin up off yo' han's,
Set up nice now. Goodness lan's!
Hol' yo'se'f up lak yo' pa.
Bet nobidy evah saw
Him scrunched down lak you was den--
High-tone boys meks high-tone men.

Once dey was a ole black bah,
Used to live 'roun' hyeah some whah
In a cave. He was so big
He could ca'y off a pig
Lak you picks a chicken up,
Er yo' leetles' bit o' pup.
An' he had two gread big eyes,
Jes' erbout a saucer's size.
Why, dey looked lak balls o' fiah
Jumpin' 'roun' erpon a wiah
W'en dat bah was mad; an' laws!
But you ought to seen his paws!
Did I see 'em? How you 'spec
I 's a-gwine to ricollec'
Dis hyeah ya'n I 's try'n' to spin
Ef you keeps on puttin' in?
You keep still an' don't you cheep
Less I 'll sen' you off to sleep.
Dis hyeah bah 'd go trompin' 'roun'
Eatin' evahthing he foun';
No one could n't have a fa'm
But dat bah 'u'd do' em ha'm;
And dey could n't ketch de scamp.
Anywhah he wan'ed to tramp.
Dah de scoun'el 'd mek his track,
Do his du't an' come on back.
He was sich a sly ole limb,
Traps was jes' lak fun to him.

Now, down neah whah Mistah Bah
Lived, dey was a weasel dah;
But dey was n't fren's a-tall
Case de weasel was so small.
An' de bah 'u'd, jes' fu' sass,
Tu'n his nose up w'en he 'd pass.
Weasels 's small o' cose, but my!
Dem air animiles is sly.
So dis hyeah one says, says he,
'I 'll jes' fix dat bah, you see.'
So he fixes up his plan
An' hunts up de fa'merman.
When de fa'mer see him come,
He 'mence lookin' mighty glum,
An' he ketches up a stick;
But de weasel speak up quick:
'Hol' on, Mistah Fa'mer man,
I wan' 'splain a little plan.
Ef you waits, I 'll tell you whah
An' jes' how to ketch ol' Bah.
But I tell yow now you mus'
Gin me one fat chicken fus'.'
Den de man he scratch his haid,
Las' he say, 'I'll mek de trade.'
So de weasel et his hen,
Smacked his mouf and says, 'Well, den,
Set yo' trap an' bait ternight,
An' I 'll ketch de bah all right.'
Den he ups an' goes to see
Mistah Bah, an' says, says he:
'Well, fren' Bah, we _ain't_ been fren's,
But ternight ha'd feelin' 'en's.
Ef you ain't too proud to steal,
We kin git a splendid meal.
Cose I would n't come to you,
But it mus' be done by two;
Hit's a trap, but we kin beat
All dey tricks an' git de meat.'
'Cose I 's wif you,' says de bah,
'Come on, weasel, show me whah.'
Well, dey trots erlong ontwell
Dat air meat beginned to smell
In de trap. Den weasel say:
'Now you put yo' paw dis way
While I hol' de spring back so,
Den you grab de meat an' go.'
Well, de bah he had to grin
Ez he put his big paw in,
Weasel done let go de spring.
'Dah now,' says de weasel, 'dah,
I done cotched you, Mistah Bah!'
O, dat bah did sno't and spout,
Try'n' his bestes' to git out,
But de weasel say, 'Goo'-bye!
Weasel small, but weasel sly.'
Den he tu'ned his back an' run
Tol' de fa'mer whut he done.
So de fa'mer come down dah,
Wif a axe and killed de bah.

Dah now, ain't dat sto'y fine?
Run erlong now, nevah min'.
Want some mo', you rascal, you?
No, suh! no, suh! dat 'll do. 

I've reached beyond those limits that bound 
And searched around ‘til I finally found
The Pinnacle of Reality
Is in my utter mortality
And so what I've found is simply the ground

I am captivated inside a cage.
It's a cage of darkness.
It's like a black cloud covering all over me.
Its so dark, I cannot see myself.
I don't know where I am lost.
I was never like this before.
I couldn't realize, 
Why this happened? 
How this happened? 
Its so gloomy inside.
There is no one who could see me.
Nor I can see anyone.
Who will free me from this cage? 

I wondered did I captivate myself, 
or anyone trapped me inside this cage? 

If I remain on this cage for long, 
No one will ask for me! 
Even if I die on this cage also, 
Beloved ones will offer condolences and
of course they will always remember me.
World will move on like before.
My presence or absence, 
Doesn't make any difference.
Because its law of nature.
Even they have to survive
So they cannot just sit aside.


Life keeps on offering challenges.
Which will never allow us to sit in one place even for few seconds.
It will make us run without a break.

Our Beloved ones have died but we are also moving with the world! 
This is the fact of life, which no one can change.
Life is only one! 
We have to accept everything as it is! 
We cannot swim against tides, but can go on with the flow! 

This is the Teachings of life! 
Is it.   



I am like a caged bird
that doesn't ever get tired
to find the way to fly
in the lovely blue sky.

I will fly, float and run
in the deep blue ocean.
I will sing when I roam; 
Then I will come back home. 


A Cairo Rose 

Lily white was his shirt 
A red rose sprung from his chest, 
It grew bigger and wider, 
Too heavy for the man who fell into the dust; 
The rose liquefied. 
Around him an air of stillness. 

A Cairo Street  

The crack of a rifle shot a man fell to ground, 
instantly dead, whatever he was thinking of was 
totally eradicated.  His friends tried to drag him 
away, but a dead body is as inflexible as a bag of 
cement.  They left him there, on the filthy street, 
his open eyes mirrored the terrorized sky. 


There is a pretty party                                                   Going on, but cutting                                                   The pretty cake's decision                                                 Is still undecided because                                                  It needs a pretty decision                                                 From all the attendants.


another calamity
another rapture
an earth quake
oh mother earth
express your pain
elsewhere
do not scare
your grand grand children
for they do not
recognize your pain or sorrow
they are a world apart from you
this is not just one
so many of a

No days such honored days as these! While yet 
Fair Aphrodite reigned, men seeking wide 
For some fair thing which should forever bide 
On earth, her beauteous memory to set 
In fitting frame that no age could forget, 
Her name in lovely April's name did hide, 
And leave it there, eternally allied 
To all the fairest flowers Spring did beget. 
And when fair Aphrodite passed from earth, 
Her shrines forgotten and her feasts of mirth, 
A holier symbol still in seal and sign, 
Sweet April took, of kingdom most divine, 
Of spring anemones, in Palestine. 

Silence again. The glorious symphony 
Hath need of pause and interval of peace. 
Some subtle signal bids all sweet sounds cease, 
Save hum of insects' aimless industry. 
Pathetic summer seeks by blazonry 
Of color to conceal her swift decrease. 
Weak subterfuge! Each mocking day doth fleece 
A blossom, and lay bare her poverty. 
Poor middle-aged summer! Vain this show! 
Whole fields of Golden-Rod cannot offset 
One meadow with a single violet; 
And well the singing thrush and lily know, 
Spite of all artifice which her regret 
Can deck in splendid guise, their time to go

Still lie the sheltering snows, undimmed and white; 
And reigns the winter's pregnant silence still; 
No sign of spring, save that the catkins fill, 
And willow stems grow daily red and bright. 
These are days when ancients held a rite 
Of expiation for the old year's ill, 
And prayer to purify the new year's will: 
Fit days, ere yet the spring rains blur the sight, 
Ere yet the bounding blood grows hot with haste, 
And dreaming thoughts grow heavy with a greed 
The ardent summer's joy to have and taste; 
Fit days, to give to last year's losses heed, 
To recon clear the new life's sterner need; 
Fit days, for Feast of Expiation placed

O Winter! frozen pulse and heart of fire, 
What loss is theirs who from thy kingdom turn 
Dismayed, and think thy snow a sculptured urn 
Of death! Far sooner in midsummer tire 
The streams than under ice. June could not hire 
Her roses to forego the strength they learn 
In sleeping on thy breast. No fires can burn 
The bridges thou dost lay where men desire 
In vain to build. 
O Heart, when Love's sun goes 
To northward, and the sounds of singing cease, 
Keep warm by inner fires, and rest in peace. 
Sleep on content, as sleeps the patient rose. 
Walk boldly on the white untrodden snows, 
The winter is the winter's own release. 

Some flowers are withered and some joys have died; 
The garden reeks with an East Indian scent 
From beds where gillyflowers stand weak and spent; 
The white heat pales the skies from side to side; 
But in still lakes and rivers, cool, content, 
Like starry blooms on a new firmament, 
White lilies float and regally abide. 
In vain the cruel skies their hot rays shed; 
The lily does not feel their brazen glare. 
In vain the pallid clouds refuse to share 
Their dews, the lily feels no thirst, no dread. 
She drinks of living waters and keeps fair. 

This is the treacherous month when autumn days 
With summer's voice come bearing summer's gifts. 
Beguiled, the pale down-trodden aster lifts 
Her head and blooms again. The soft, warm haze 
Makes moist once more the sere and dusty ways, 
And, creeping through where dead leaves lie in drifts, 
The violet returns. Snow noiseless sifts 
Ere night, an icy shroud, which morning's rays 
Willidly shine upon and slowly melt, 
Too late to bid the violet live again. 
The treachery, at last, too late, is plain; 
Bare are the places where the sweet flowers dwelt. 
What joy sufficient hath November felt? 
What profit from the violet's day of pain

The month of carnival of all the year, 
When Nature lets the wild earth go its way, 
And spend whole seasons on a single day. 
The spring-time holds her white and purple dear; 
October, lavish, flaunts them far and near; 
The summer charily her reds doth lay 
Like jewels on her costliest array; 
October, scornful, burns them on a bier. 
The winter hoards his pearls of frost in sign 
Of kingdom: whiter pearls than winter knew, 
Oar empress wore, in Egypt's ancient line, 
October, feasting 'neath her dome of blue, 
Drinks at a single draught, slow filtered through 
Sunshiny air, as in a tingling wine

O golden month! How high thy gold is heaped! 
The yellow birch-leaves shine like bright coins strung 
On wands; the chestnut's yellow pennons tongue 
To every wind its harvest challenge. Steeped 
In yellow, still lie fields where wheat was reaped; 
And yellow still the corn sheaves, stacked among 
The yellow gourds, which from the earth have wrung 
Her utmost gold. To highest boughs have leaped 
The purple grape,--last thing to ripen, late 
By very reason of its precious cost. 
O Heart, remember, vintages are lost 
If grapes do not for freezing night-dews wait. 
Think, while thou sunnest thyself in Joy's estate, 
Mayhap thou canst not ripen without frost


Raise the voice for your abducted rights
Against the discrimination and agonal plight
In a world - driven by race and power
Stop dozing at your zone; don’t act like coward.

Accepting everything is not called life
Stand by your own ground to come alive
Do not fear; do not care the power of hate
Come out blood rinsed to change your fate.

Your blood will talk for you, afloat them all
Sometimes blood is needed, for revolution’s call
Many years of your drudgery, in their apathy
No one cares for you only history shows sympathy.

So come out together from the dreadful womb
Stop living like dead in the house like tomb
As we have only one life; then there is nothing else. 

There is a blue fragrance, essence of dusk.
The smoke of last things lingers on old clothes.
Sun has become as rare as goldenrod.
I call for August, but no answer comes.

Autumn awaits across a worn doorsill.
I need you to make sense of falling leaves, 
When death paints a rich picture ot itself, 
And shadows measure out the long way home. 


a call for revolution. 
rivers rise, and overflow their banks! 
branches bud with leaves in the autumn, 
butterflies arrive to bring the snow! 
every window opened, every lock is broken, 
every pot is filled, every table shared.
the language of ears sees no colors, 
and dignity wears no chains.
prophets return to being carpenters, 
and poets till the earth.
soldiers lay down their guns to become fathers, 
nations give way to family.
the faces of god all become one, 
the hands of god become many! 
freedom becomes a verb not a dream, 
hunger is buried by compassionate hands.
forgiveness a way of living, 
respect the bridge all must cross.
truth is applauded for asking questions, 
as the young and old exchange gifts.
every moment sacred and shared, 
the earth revered and protected.
a call for revolution
just as far away as near


Dear! Wilt thou remember me in thy new home? 
There dost thou begin the world under
            new auspices with new offerings
Deserted is now the leafy cottage; its
            shady neighborhood where we two
            first exchanged our looks, where
            every particle of dust, every.
            creeper and leaf is redolent
            of the wealth of eternal acquaintance
            in the worship of hearts,
And a dismal void now cries in the wilderness.
As didst thou forget me, many a man could
                        come to thee,
Then out of sympathy for me would that
            cottage weep out an offended heart,
Wherever dist thou turn thy eyes,
            my reminiscences there made thy heart ache,
Thou wilt drown that reproach here
            in the depths of new field; 
I alone am lost in the woods' of oblivion.
The distance between thee and me was so
            long no real distance,
As that old mansion would bring my
            distance into nearness.
Now hast thou formed new ties,
Opened a new fountain of laughter and tears,
New performance and new revelry of song,
Under the impulse of new welcome! 
To the cold storage my own tune is consigned.
Dear! Mine is today forlorn hope, as
            pre-ordained by the divinity,
Today on my grave will be built thy bridal
            sanctum sanatorium 
In the air is echoed and re-echoed
The music of the Sylvan flute in the mouth 
                        of some cow-herd,
Lost, lost am I in the western horizon! 
Farewell, Dear, our role comes to an end
            with the setting sun,
Now art thou a new one in a new home!

Said Death as, strolling through the County Jail,
He entered that serene assassin's cell
And hung his hat and coat upon a nail.
'I think that life in this secluded spot
Agrees with men of your trade, does it not?'

'Well, yes,' said Goldenson, 'I can't complain:
Life anywhere-provided it is mine-
Agrees with me; but I observe with pain
That still the people murmur and repine.
It hurts their sense of harmony, no doubt,
To see a persecuted man grow stout.'

'O no, 'tis not your growing stout,' said Death,
'Which makes these malcontents complain and scold
They like you to be, somehow, scant of breath.
What they object to is your growing old.
And-though indifferent to lean or fat
I don't myself entirely favor _that_.'

With brows that met above the orbs beneath,
And nose that like a soaring hawk appeared,
And lifted lip, uncovering his teeth,
The Mamikellikiller coldly sneered:
'O, so you don't! Well, how will you assuage
Your spongy passion for the blood of age?'

Death with a clattering convulsion, drew
His coat on, hatted his unmeated pow,
Unbarred the door and, stepping partly through,
Turned and made answer: 'I will _show_ you how.
I'm going to the Bench you call Supreme
And tap the old women who sit there and dream.

Beautiful skies changing hour by hour
Floating clouds billow, streak and follow
Catching glints of sunlight-heightening majesty
Enhancing tranquility as gentle winds blow. 

With  knees  so  wounded  
Unable  to  bend
From  so  much  kneeling
On  the  splinter  strewn
Ordeal  of  existence, 
With  shoulders yoked  between  shafts

Of  dream  and  reality, 
And  hoofs  time  bound
I lumber, plod, dragging
The  waterlogged  lifeload  of  desire
Across  traceless  tracks
Of  the  vast  desert  of infinity. 

THERE WAS a graven image of Desire
Painted with red blood on a ground of gold
Passing between the young men and the old,
And by him Pain, whose body shone like fire,
And Pleasure with gaunt hands that grasped their hire.
Of his left wrist, with fingers clenched and cold,
The insatiable Satiety kept hold,
Walking with feet unshod that pashed the mire.
The senses and the sorrows and the sins,
And the strange loves that suck the breasts of Hate
Till lips and teeth bite in their sharp indenture,
Followed like beasts with flap of wings and fins.
Death stood aloof behind a gaping grate,
Upon whose lock was written Peradventure. 


Why speak of Giamschid rubies
Whence rosy starlight drips?
I know a richer crimson,
The ruby of her lips.

Why speak of pearls of Oman
That shells of ocean sheathe?
I know a purer nacre,
The white pearls of her teeth.

Why tell me of the sapphires
That Kings and Khalifs prize?
I know a lovelier azure,
The sapphires of her eyes.

Go search the far Earth over,
Go search the farthest sea,
You will not find a cameo


The photo’s small and rather creased but there 
We are, a family group in black and white. 
A camera has the trick of freezing time. 
We’re posed before a boat outside our house, 
It is to be a sort of caravan 
For holidays. It has a cabin newly built 
Upon a hull that’s often sailed the Humber. 
Each one of us is smiling in the sun. 
The cabin’s shadow says it’s afternoon, 
The trees’ and hedgerow’s leaves proclaim it spring. 

The War is over now. My father’s home 
On leave and looks relaxed. My mother’s pleased, 
I remember how she wept and prayed for him 
On D-Day when his coaster carried troops 
And petrol to the beach at Normandy. 
My grandad stands erect and rather stiff, 
And grandma, too, sits very upright, posed, 
Their daughter, Eileen, looks so young. I think 
She misses wartime dances and romances. 

And is that me, that boy with folded arms 
And hair as fair as any Anglo-Saxon? 
I cannot now recall what I was thinking then, 
What it was like to be a boy of ten, 
Now that my hair is grey and I’ve grown old 
And all those people in that photograph 
Are talking, laughing, drinking, full of life 
Within my head though fifty years and more 
Have passed, and all of them are long since dead. 
A camera has the trick of freezing time. 


Slowly
I am ageing
start was slow
but pace is fast

I did not realise
only when the hair greyed
did I wonder
that I am matured

It is a tragedy
to ripen is to fruit
to mature is fatal
though maturity is wisdom

Slowly I have lost interest
yes, my urge to dress up
and enjoy life afresh
is losing momentum
and I am lagging unwanted

It all began
with my loss of identification
of beings of either Gender
I started treating
Hes and Shes 
as if what use
the difference could make? 

It is a retreat
all battles have been won
no more passions
lurking underneath
stirring unwanted emotions.


My limbs are crazy
they behave painfully drowsy
the lust for life
it is in the snail pace strife
I miss nothing, 
but suddenly everything is gone
blank is the page
ink in the letters have evaporated
the perfume in the bottle
it has become perfect air
no softness in the texture
no satin in the hair touch
nomore my skin 
reacts to delicate moisturisers
I just feel 
I am a clueless camphor
distilled in the air, 
bodyless, odourless
past melted into.   nowhere. 

Since I had just arrived
from foreign shores
where men are shy
and women tease, 
I halted briefly at the dune
and looked straight into
the Southern sun.
You later said you  smiled
right when I draped  with care
the Mapleleaf upon 
what I would call in Latin only
mons pubis, (cute, those curls) .
I've loved Canadian women
ever since. Au Canada. 

Folks has be'n to town, and Sahry
Fetched 'er home a pet canary--,
And of all the blame', contrary,
Aggervatin' things alive!
I love music-- that I love it
When it's free-- and plenty of it--;
But I kindo' git above it,
At a dollar-eighty-five!

Reason's plain as I'm a-sayin'--,
Jes' the idy, now, o' layin'
Out yer money, and a-payin'
Fer a willer-cage and bird,
When the medder-larks is wingin'
Round you, and the woods is ringin'
With the beautifullest singin'
That a mortal ever heard!

Sahry's sot, tho'--. So I tell her
He's a purty little feller,
With his wings o' creamy-yeller,
And his eyes keen as a cat;
And the twitter o' the critter
'Pears to absolutely glitter!
Guess I'll haf to go and git her
A high-priceter cage 'n that

Am vegetarian; 
advocate non violence; 
only hunt with words.  


I sat before my desk last eve
To assess my current plight; 
The things I see, you might agree, 
Indicate a major blight.

My heartbeat is irregular
And, likewise are my bowels; 
My appetite has flown the coop
While my nervous stomach growls.

My sex drive took a wrongway turn, 
On life's highway, some miles back; 
My drugs for that don't seem to work
So, I'm no good in the sack.

My bones keep going crackle-pop
And my back's in constant pain; 
I have fungus on my toe nails
And my garden needing rain.

My teeth and hair are getting thin, 
I'm having trouble seeing; 
My prostate gland has swollen up
And that restricts my peeing.

That about sums it up, for now, 
Not to mention larger ills.
Did I forget to tell you how
I keep mixing up my pills? 


I'll be eighty five, when spring arrives
And, with luck, I do survive; 
Gosh! It's great to be alive. 

A candle burned, 
And shadows fell upon the walls, 
Trying to do away with the gloom. 

Shadows fell upon the walls, 
Trying to consume the light, 
And losing the battle to the candlelight. 

Trying to do away with the gloom, 
The candle burned down to a nub.
And shadows fell again upon the walls. 

So, a new candle burned, 
Trying to do away with the shadows
Which fell against the walls.

And so, the battle goes, 
Light against the dark. 
And the candle is kept lit, 
When  the shadows fall again.



The path was laid, the buildings built, 
the cakes were baked, the clothes were made, 
the cars went past on spinning wheels, 
the shoes were stitched, designed and heeled. 
Who was it that produced all this; 
the candles in the restaurants serving bliss. 

The clouds spun past the steepled sky, 
the moon shone bright as they went by, 
and in the broken spaces rent, 
the far flung stars shone across the firmament. 
Who was it that produced all this; 
the candles in the heavens shining bliss. 

The people passed bedecked with robes, 
some walked fast, some thoughtfully strolled, 
some looked out, some looked within, 
some looked at me, some looked grim. 
Who was it that produced all this; 
the candles in the eyes reflecting bliss. 

The candles' flames merged in the mind, 
and in the merging spoke in chimes. 
The flame spread wide enfolding all, 
who was there left with need to ask. 
Who is it that produced all this; 
That candle, only source of bliss. 


i know how to look what lies down under and
i journey through myself as a ritual cleansing. 

the
wick light eye's insight torches the way in, purification
passion melts drops the wax as garment, leaving 
me naked warm to touch. 

all that i have to for giving, give up, save
the real. 

now if i am not myself, then
who is me.


'I don't mean to be rude', 
Said the hungry cannibal, 
'But I could go for some finger food.

'My senses
Gets depreciated
When a boisterous crowd
Turns bedlam.


Paroxysm unleashes
And I learn fatalism
Indignantly 
Furiously
Babbling for 
Measures
Precautions
Diametrically opposing
The Giver
And
The taker
Witnessing
A Carnage
Genocides
Burnt human carcass
CAPITALISM
Mercenaries
Jostling 
Democracy
To irregularly menstruate
And
Podgy politicians
Poaching thousand millions
Sit poised and ponder
To make a Sacrilege

With our children
Unless
Sopped
With freebies.

Play, Phoebus, on thy lute,
And we will sit all mute;
By listening to thy lyre,
That sets all ears on fire.

And as he leads the way
Through heaven, the very spheres,
As men, turn all to ears

Aye, Montecelli, that's the name.
You may have heard of him perhaps.
Yet though he never savoured fame,
Of those impressionistic chaps,
Monet and Manet and Renoir
               He was the avatar.

He festered in a Marseilles slum,
A starving genius, god-inspired.
You'd take him for a lousy bum,
Tho' poetry of paint he lyred,
In dreamy pastels each a gem: . . .
               How people laughed at them!

He peddled paint from bar to bar;
From sordid rags a jewel shone,
A glow of joy and colour far
From filth of fortune woe-begone.
'Just twenty francs,' he shyly said,
               'To take me drunk to bed.'

Of Van Gogh and Cezanne a peer;
In dreams of ecstasy enskied,
A genius and a pioneer,
Poor, paralysed and mad he died:
Yet by all who hold Beauty dear
               May he be glorified


I can not paint. So it is
words I use, to paint a
portrait of my thoughts.


Eons of its icy silence
As a water fall, 

From the deep crevice
In the mountain, it descends
Like a torrent-

The language it speaks
Can not be matched
By any human speech-

The valley resounds, 
I gape, astounded over
The magic it weaves-

From east the Sun’s rays
Have come down to play, 
The game of hide and seek-

As they filters down
Through the dense Deodars, 
Water gushes like a child-

All creatures exult
The forest just 
Seems lost in contemplation


Sitting still, on a wooden bench
under a canopy
on a vantage point, 
I wondered, 
why are tears
flowing down my cheeks


The artist's brush scoops up the shades of green, 
and creates a scene.
Trees, banks, deep valleys, fields and gentle hills, 
how the picture fills.
Some vivid yellows in the sunshine's rays, 
on his canvas, blaze.
Rich blue envisaged in the summer sky, 
is the perfect dye.
Such subtle shadows to be applied in black, 
require the knack.
The whole portrayal is a captivating sight, 
with highlights, white.
Then somewhere you'll find a signature in grey, 
inscribed 


This night
Beauteous and bright, 
Beauteous by the cool breeze
It brings in nice, 
Beauteous by the sweet smells
Alluring soft
Of flowers that bloom
Around this place, 
And bright by the full round moon 
Shining upon the distant sky-

Here, 
I rest on my reclining chair
My thoughts inclining to else where; 
I gaze upon this star studded sky; 
Like scattered gems 
On a carpet black, 
Suddenly these sparks
Capture my eyes
And pull me back
From my lazing thoughts 
Soothing my pensive mood
This lovely sight -

Twinkle
As I look at them 
They wink at me, 
I feel them smile; 
Not one or two a bunch of them
Ready to take me on a ride, 
I start to count them 
But countless I find; 
Give up the game, I lose 
A loss pleasing my mind-

I like
To close my eyes to keep them in; 
But they open the lids inward 
Fill me with joy; 
Disarmed gazing I recline; 
Springs up a thought
Into me so nice
‘Me a captive to these stars 
In my mind! ’Never before I imagined
Pushed down and removed
Suddenly it raised in my actions
Pushing slowly and silently
Ask the missing owls and dark nights
How I get dumb departed
From such mysterious elements of love.

Few cracks and sparks
With rocket speed pierce and
Form a substance in my distance
Far it goes in her proceedings
Ceiling my imagination over searches
Perceptions and distress treatments
All at a naked eye and life. 

The fact is i was in a car accident,
hence i wonder what is the reason behind that?
The fact is it is not the first time,
hence i shouldn't be a poet. 



A car is a car
If it can ride you nearby or far

A car is a car
When it gets you in time to the bar

A car is a car
When you are addressed as Madam or Sir

But for some
A car is not just a car
It is a home
After a daylight roam
It is a home
After a nightly roam
Kind of like a homelessness 
Reoccurring syndrome

Now give me any banger of a car
I'll give it hotly showers of a sauna
Play sweet tunes to it from a guitar
By the time you watch me stand by it
And pose with an exotic cigar
Waiting to take you out to dinar
You may even prefer it to a modernised jaguar

You see, to me
A car is just a car
Be it in a new silver shining coat
Or one decorated with tarnished scars
The simple reality
Is they all have similar
Passenger capacity

Whether be it a personalised seater stretch limousine
Or a Ferrari with an exploding roaring engine
A car is a car
A vehicle of motion
A medium of transportation
Even when it shows signs of erosion
As long as it can move from junction to junction
I personally sanction

A car is just a car



A caravan
Of cattle and humans
Trudged ahead before me
Down the road
Quietly, helplessly, patiently, 
In stoic acceptance of their destiny, 
In search of daily bread and livelihood-

For a few seconds, 
I paused in my steps, 
And turned my eyes heavenwards, 
Hoping for a heavenly reprieve from this crazy, mindless existence.
But heavenly offices, my dear, don't work fast, I reminded myself, 
Mired as they are, neck deep, in a cesspool of bureaucratic red-tape.
So with a bent head, eyes turned back towards Mother Earth, 

I rejoined the caravan
Of cattle and humans, 
Trudging ahead before me
Down the road
Quietly, helplessly, patiently, 
In stoic acceptance of my destiny, 
In search of daily bread and livelihood-Crawled under the house to retrieve
something's that I had fogotten.
While I took them out, I sorted and found
that most of what I'd stored, was damp and rotten.

As I sorted through the memories I once knew
stuck together were photos of me and my brother.
As I pulled them apart, their memories rushed to my heart
past memories now a big part of all the others. 


Was more then mold in that cardboard box
there were those memories of things from my past.
But as I now see, they will always be, in my hearts memories
and not those tangible things that just won't last.

'Break me my bounds, and let me fly
To regions vast of boundless sky;
Nor I, like piteous Daphne, be
Root-bound. Ah, no! I would be free
As yon same bird that in its flight
Outstrips the range of mortal sight;
Free as the mountain streams that gush
From bubbling springs, and downward rush
Across the serrate mountain's side,--
The rocks o'erwhelmed, their banks defied,--
And like the passions in the soul,
Swell into torrents as they roll.
Oh, circumscribe me not by rules
That serve to lead the minds of fools!
But give me pow'r to work my will,
And at my deeds the world shall thrill.
My words shall rouse the slumb'ring zest
That hardly stirs in manhood's breast;
And as the sun feeds lesser lights,
As planets have their satellites,
So round about me will I bind
The men who prize a master mind!'

He lived a silent life alone,
And laid him down when it was done;
And at his head was placed a stone
On which was carved a name unknown

When Liberverm resigned the chair
Of This or That in college, where
For two decades he'd gorged his brain
With more than it could well contain,
In order to relieve the stress
He took to writing for the press.
Then Pondronummus said, 'I'll help
This mine of talent to devel'p;'
And straightway bought with coin and credit
The _Thundergust_ for him to edit.

The great man seized the pen and ink
And wrote so hard he couldn't think;
Ideas grew beneath his fist
And flew like falcons from his wrist.
His pen shot sparks all kinds of ways
Till all the rivers were ablaze,
And where the coruscations fell
Men uttered words I dare not spell.

Eftsoons with corrugated brow,
Wet towels bound about his pow,
Locked legs and failing appetite,
He thought so hard he couldn't write.
His soaring fancies, chickenwise,
Came home to roost and wouldn't rise.
With dimmer light and milder heat
His goose-quill staggered o'er the sheet,
Then dragged, then stopped; the finish came-
He couldn't even write his name.
The _Thundergust_ in three short weeks
Had risen, roared, and split its cheeks.
Said Pondronummus, 'How unjust!
The storm I raised has laid my dust!'

When, Moneybagger, you have aught
Invested in a vein of thought,
Be sure you've purchased not, instead,
That salted claim, a bookworm's head. 

some shy away it
some are proud to deny it
'tail wags' yearns for it


To kneel to Judah's King,
He binds His frost upon the land
To ripen it for Spring --
To ripen it for Spring, good sirs,
According to His Word.
Which well must be as ye can see --

When we poor fenmen skate the ice
Or shiver on the wold,
We hear the cry of a single tree
That breaks her heart in the cold --
That breaks her heart in the cold, good sirs,
And rendeth by the board.
Which well must be as ye can see --

Her wood is crazed and little worth
Excepting as to burn,
That we may warm and make our mirth
Until the Spring return --
Until the Spring return, good sirs,
When well must be as ye can see --

And all who sleep therein!
And guard the fens from pirate folk,
And keep us all from sin,
To walk in honesty, good sirs,
Of thought and deed ad word!
Which shall befriend our latter end

Dear you not only look good
But are carved out of wood
You are like fresh flower from garden
Which has not boomed all of sudden? 

I think you have fallen so deep
You had not time to peep
You have maintained an kept the figure
You are bound to succeed in future

Not all may know but only handful
You are pretty and beautiful
You are like full moon
you can be easily seen in noon

know it well what you are
You may be very far
Still a bright and shining star
Your eyes truly sparkle as they are

Feel it from within and express
You should not be in duress
Keep smiling always with eyes to glare
don't hold it back or prevent it to stare


They should not have left him there alone, 
Alone that is except for the cat. 
He was only nine, not old enough 
To be left alone in a basement flat, 
Alone, that is, except for the cat. 
A dog would have been a different thing, 
A big gruff dog with slashing jaws, 
But a cat with round eyes mad as gold, 
Plump as a cushion with tucked-in paws--- 
Better have left him with a fair-sized rat! 
But what they did was leave him with a cat. 
He hated that cat; he watched it sit, 
A buzzing machine of soft black stuff, 
He sat and watched and he hated it, 
Snug in its fur, hot blood in a muff, 
And its mad gold stare and the way it sat 
Crooning dark warmth: he loathed all that. 
So he took Daddy's stick and he hit the cat. 
Then quick as a sudden crack in glass 
It hissed, black flash, to a hiding place 
In the dust and dark beneath the couch, 
And he followed the grin on his new-made face, 
A wide-eyed, frightened snarl of a grin, 
And he took the stick and he thrust it in, 
Hard and quick in the furry dark. 
The black fur squealed and he felt his skin 
Prickle with sparks of dry delight. 
Then the cat again came into sight, 
Shot for the door that wasn't quite shut, 
But the boy, quick too, slammed fast the door: 
The cat, half-through, was cracked like a nut 
And the soft black thud was dumped on the floor. 
Then the boy was suddenly terrified 
And he bit his knuckles and cried and cried; 
But he had to do something with the dead thing there. 
His eyes squeezed beads of salty prayer 
But the wound of fear gaped wide and raw; 
He dared not touch the thing with his hands 
So he fetched a spade and shovelled it 
And dumped the load of heavy fur 
In the spidery cupboard under the stair 
Where it's been for years, and though it died 
It's grown in that cupboard and its hot low purr 
Grows slowly louder year by year: 
There'll not be a corner for the boy to hide 
When the cupboard swells and all sides split 
And the huge black cat pads out of it.

your first death

my last

now rest my little dear

a cast
of shadows
maketh
hazy souls 

from where
we'll hum
our dirge

our tune
a scourge
of time

to tell of our no more

-

Yet
bark-rough
our skin of late

how? -

so thin
we were in life
beneath 

we needed such a carapace 
to cosy from the world 

-

I'm reminded of a flow of trees bent
in our direction
jostling greens
lending metaphors 

Is it wisdom? 

We let our struggle go
See the red-black eyes

red-black death
 
your flesh
was new
and fresh

-

I'm old
and we are dead
together

DEAD! 

SOLD! 

blue-ice cold

forever

-

And still
we never 
were alive

clever
as an irony

Let us look beyond
o'er the cirrus
o'er the blue 

in mist as love
we cannot part


With the body that awfully sagged away,
And the lips blood-crisped, and the eyes flame-bright,
And the poor hands folded and cold as clay --
Oh, I've thought and I've thought of him all the day.

For the weary old doctor says to me:
"He'll only last for an hour or so.
Both of his legs below the knee
Blown off by a bomb. . . . So, lad, go slow,

And please remember, he doesn't know

"
So I tried to drive with never a jar;
And there was I cursing the road like mad,
When I hears a ghost of a voice from the car:
"Tell me, old chap, have I `copped it' bad?"
So I answers "No," and he says, "I'm glad


"Glad," says he, "for at twenty-two
Life's so splendid, I hate to go.
There's so much good that a chap might do,
And I've fought from the start and I've suffered so.
'Twould be hard to get knocked out now, you know


"Forget it," says I; then I drove awhile,
And I passed him a cheery word or two;
But he didn't answer for many a mile,
So just as the hospital hove in view,
Says I: "Is there nothing that I can do?"

Then he opens his eyes and he smiles at me;
And he takes my hand in his trembling hold;
"Thank you -- you're far too kind," says he:
"I'm awfully comfy -- stay . . . let's see:
I fancy my blanket's come unrolled --
My feet, please wrap 'em -- they're cold . . . they're cold

"She had a name among the children;
But no one loved though someone owned
Her, locked her out of doors at bedtime
And had her kittens duly drowned.

In Spring, nevertheless, this cat
Ate blackbirds, thrushes, nightingales,
And birds of bright voice and plume and flight,
As well as scraps from neighbours’ pails.

I loathed and hated her for this;
One speckle on a thrush’s breast
Was worth a million such; and yet

I'm going to close my swimming pool today.

After vacuuming the pool and adding chemicals

I check for appropriate PH and chlorine.

It's good to swim one more time before Summer folds.

My wife joins me in swimming one hundred lengths of the pool.

Pool water is crystal clear, water ripples gently spread.

Sunshine hides behind many thick hanging clouds.

Waiting for a breeze, pine trees stand still.

Cicadas sing their last songs before their singing season ends.

Around the pool, many red Knockout roses bloom.

Without scorching sun, rose petals are more beautiful.

Cats gather to play around the pool.

Some cats lie to rest, while others sit and watch around.

Hearing my wife's call, they come closer to her.

She comforts them with her gentle massage on their heads and shoulders.

Blackpearl wants to come closer to my wife

He over stretches his paws and falls into the pool.

He cries out loud in his panic.

He paddles his limbs unceasingly, 

But as the result of his movements, he floats and swims.

My wife swims to lead the way.

He swims by her side to the end of the pool

Then he climbs out of the pool by using steps.

On pool deck, he cries with repeated meows. 

My wife comforts him and immediately he stops crying.


the cat she sits, 
a stoic, 
purrs and meows
as fits her mood, 

the cat she sits
and does not move, 
as befits
a statue, 

on the mantle piece
table or window sill, 

then with a whirl she moves from
place to place, 
soon stretching out
and lies about, 

suddenly, starts and startles, 
remembering something
she has forgot, 
runs up and down
the steps

chasing her shadow
or something more profound, 
dances up and down
and all around, 
flops on the ground

and sighs
her secret kept

we in a quandry
wonder, 
what makes
her dreams
come true


He is a beautiful kitty cat
Frank is his name
And around the barnyard
He has risen to fame

Not only does he have
A coat so warm and soft
He’s quite the little mouser
Even up in the tall hay loft

He has a certain way 
About him, it’s a fact
His personality, my friend
Changes how you react

You fall in love so quickly
When Frank comes into the room
For he takes a lot of time
Out of his busy day to groom 

He keeps your heart on a string
And this you can take to the bank
When you become a victim of 
A charming cat named Frank

Grandad Cat 
curls his tail
and wants to tell a tale
to his Grand


Kits Cats
He claws them before him
and he meows a catchy tune
that he shall 
tell them a tale

But little Toby
he purrs: 
No, Grand – you're such a bad story-teller
cos you only have 
one tale


A cat with nine lives, 
Isn't sitting wondering. 
Where to go and who to visit, 
On vacation.
However, 
Most dudes choose to purr at home. 

For a humanist
A chock
For a robber
An asset
For a country
A change 
For an artist
A mirror


A caterpillar,
this deep in fall--
    still not a butterfly.
 



Love can cause so much pain
Full of worries and so much strain
Complete derailment of train
Only losses and not so much gain

Why it must be caused at all? 
Do we not know it is near fall? 
Still we go for honest call
Ready for high jump and scaling of the wall

Loved ones may not depart
They may drift away with slow start
You might have got wind out of it
It has met untimely death before you could meet

It must breathe beautifully
Sustain the attack heart fully
It may heal with passage of time
You have done no crime

Heart is to break and so head is to ache
Let there by any type breakage or attack
Heart will pulsate with new emerging waves
It has not to ache but to pave 

New waves to catch from any direction
Take it to memory with careful action
Making it sure for no more heart break
No worry on face or eyes to speak


I have never known a cause so just that it
replaces husbands, sons, daughters, mothers
and children.

Show me the cause that replaces love.  

life.

How can it be that 'free people' are ordered
to fight in a country they have never heard of? 
For a cause the they know not and for a people
that would spit upon their graves! 

Who the hell are these politicians.  

these
armchair patriots who order-no command
our loved ones to war! To death? 

Must we continue to commit inhumain acts
in the name of humanity? 

How many of our loved one must die, before
we say.  

no more? 


Becoming extinct because he forgot how to fly, and could only walk.
Consider man, who may well become extinct
Because he forgot how to walk and learned how to fly before he thinked. 

Some drink to Friendship, some to Love,
Through whom the world is fair, perdie!
But I to one these others prove,
Who leaps 'mid lions for a glove,
Or dies to set another free
I drink to Loyalty.

II.

No dagger his, no cloak and mask,
Free-faced he stands so all may see;
Let Friendship set him any task,
Or Love reward he does not ask,
The deed is done whate'er it be
So here's to Loyalty. 

Kentish Sir Byng stood for his King,
Bidding the crop-headed Parliament swing:
And, pressing a troop unable to stoop
And see the rogues flourish and honest folk droop,
Marched them along, fifty score strong,
Great-hearted gentlemen, singing this song.
To the Devil that prompts 'em their treasonous parles!
Cavaliers, up! Lips from the cup,
Hands from the pasty, nor bite take nor sup
Till you're-

(Chorus)
Marching along, fifty-score strong,
Great-hearted gentlemen, singing this song.

Hampden to hell, and his obsequies' knell.
Serve Hazelrig, Fiennes, and young Harry as well!
England, good cheer! Rupert is near!
Kentish and loyalists, keep we not here

(Chorus)
Marching along, fifty-score strong,
Great-hearted gentlemen, singing this song?

To the Devil that pricks on such pestilent carles!
Hold by the right, you double your might;
So, onward to Nottingham, fresh for the fight,

(Chorus)
March we along, fifty-score strong,
Great-hearted gentlemen, singing this song

It is breeze that blows us so, 
Takes us wherever we go
Across the water to flow
To a wonder that we know
From a story very old
About a cavern of gold.
It has been for ages told
That only those with hearts bold
And noble can see the soul
Of the cavern as a whole.
If stealing is not their role, 
Danger is kept in control. 

Celebrated Accident 

Beautiful rainbow over the valley 
I saw a man climb up its bow only
to disappear in a symphony of
colours. When the rainbow paled
the man fell to earth. He is now a 
famous pianist and plays popular   
music for an adoring audience, 
wears a multi coloured tie and sits
in a wheelchair


Way down in the Boom Belt lived Mrs. Roselle;
A person named Petrie, he lived there as well;
But Mr. Roselle he resided away
Sing tooral iooral iooral iay.

Once Mrs. Roselle in her room was alone:
The flesh of her flesh and the bone of her bone
Neglected the wife of his bosom to woo
Sing tooral iooral iooral ioo.

Then Petrie, her lover, appeared at the door,
Remarking: 'My dear; I don't love you no more.'
'That's awfully rough,' said the lady, 'on me-
Sing tooral iooral iooral iee.'

'Come in, Mr. Petrie,' she added, 'pray do:
Although you don't love me no more, I love you.
Sit down while I spray you with vitriol now
Sing tooral iooral iooral iow.'

Said Petrie: 'That liquid I know won't agree
With my beauty, and then you'll no longer love me;
So spray and be '-O, what a word he did say!-
Sing tooral iooral iooral iay.

She deluged his head and continued to pour
Till his bonny blue eyes, like his love, were no more.
It was seldom he got such a hearty shampoo
Sing tooral iooral iooral ioo.

Then Petrie he rose and said: 'Mrs. Roselle,
I have an engagement and bid you farewell.'
'You see,' she began to explain-but not he!
Sing tooral, iooral, iooral iee.

The Sheriff he came and he offered his arm,
Saying, 'Sorry I am for disturbin' you, marm,
But business is business.' Said she, 'So they say
Sing tooral, iooral, iooral iay.'

The Judge on the bench he looked awfully stern;
The District Attorney began to attorn;
The witnesses lied and the lawyers-O my!-
Sing tooral, iooral, iooral iyi.

The chap that defended her said: 'It's our claim
That he loved us no longer and told us the same.
What else than we did could we decently do?
Sing tooral, iooral, iooral ioo.'

The District Attorney, sarcastic, replied:
'We loved you no longer-that can't be denied.
Not having no eyes we may dote on you now-
Sing tooral, iooral, iooral iow.'

The prisoner wept to entoken her fears;
The sockets of Petrie were flooded with tears.
O heaven-born Sympathy, bully for you!
Sing tooral, iooral, iooral ioo.

Four jurors considered the prisoner mad,
And four thought her victim uncommonly bad,
And four that the acid was all in his eye
Sing rum tiddy iddity iddity hi. 

A middle-northern March, now as always-- 
gusts from the South broken against cold winds-- 
but from under, as if a slow hand lifted a tide, 
it moves--not into April--into a second March, 

the old skin of wind-clear scales dropping 
upon the mold: this is the shadow projects the tree 
upward causing the sun to shine in his sphere. 

So we will put on our pink felt hat--new last year! 
--newer this by virtue of brown eyes turning back 
the seasons--and let us walk to the orchid-house, 
see the flowers will take the prize tomorrow 
at the Palace. 
Stop here, these are our oleanders. 
When they are in bloom-- 
You would waste words 
It is clearer to me than if the pink 
were on the branch. It would be a searching in 
a colored cloud to reveal that which now, huskless, 
shows the very reason for their being. 

And these the orange-trees, in blossom--no need 
to tell with this weight of perfume in the air. 
If it were not so dark in this shed one could better 
see the white. 
It is that very perfume 
has drawn the darkness down among the leaves. 
Do I speak clearly enough? 
It is this darkness reveals that which darkness alone 
loosens and sets spinning on waxen wings-- 
not the touch of a finger-tip, not the motion 
of a sigh. A too heavy sweetness proves 
its own caretaker. 
And here are the orchids! 
Never having seen 
such gaiety I will read these flowers for you: 
This is an odd January, died--in Villon's time. 
Snow, this is and this the stain of a violet 
grew in that place the spring that foresaw its own doom. 

And this, a certain July from Iceland: 
a young woman of that place 
breathed it toward the South. It took root there. 
The color ran true but the plant is small. 

This falling spray of snow-flakes is 
a handful of dead Februaries 
prayed into flower by Rafael Arevalo Martinez 
of Guatemala. 
Here's that old friend who 
went by my side so many years: this full, fragile 
head of veined lavender. Oh that April 
that we first went with our stiff lusts 
leaving the city behind, out to the green hill-- 
May, they said she was. A hand for all of us: 
this branch of blue butterflies tied to this stem. 

June is a yellow cup I'll not name; August 
the over-heavy one. And here are-- 
russet and shiny, all but March. And March? 
Ah, March-- 
Flowers are a tiresome pastime. 
One has a wish to shake them from their pots 
root and stem, for the sun to gnaw. 

Walk out again into the cold and saunter home 
to the fire. This day has blossomed long enough. 
I have wiped out the red night and lit a blaze 
instead which will at least warm our hands 
and stir up the talk. 
I think we have kept fair time. 
Time is a green orchard. 

When a snowman winks his eyes of coal, 
And from their windows children know. 
Magic's in the air.
And they wish they are on Santa's list.
As children everywhere wish this.

Excites with the bright lights shining.
Dining festively on treats. 
Will be remembered year to year.

Joyous Eid al-Adha (The Festival of Sacrifice) 
'A Celebration of Family, Community and Culture'
'A Celebration of Family, Community and Culture'

Happy Kwanzaa.

And.  

The Best of New Years to Come, 
To ALL in Celebration of United Humanity. 

The day was really a boon for them
Which suppressed their hunger and pain
Amidst the  pleasure of victory
They had little money for food
But they spent it buying fire crackers
To celebrate the victory.
The next day they will experience the same agony
But for whom they sacrificed their money
And remained hungry
They will earn billions and billions
And look at them with scorn. 

What  attracts  everyone's  fancy
Makes  them  dream  to  be  me
Is  but  my  wellknownness
That  denies  me  a life-
Enters  the stage

Before  i  seem  to  enter; 
An  echo  with  a real  voice
Like the truth  of  liars
Makes  silence  eloquent, 
To  whom  all  propose  a toast

Despite  a cold  embrace
Or  an adder's  kiss
As  if  a stranger   with  whom
I'm  forced  to live. 
In my  own  eyes   not  love  light


Only  history's finely  cut  lies. 

Oh, hadst thou fall'n, brave youth! on that proud day,
When our victorious fleet o'er the red surge
Rolled in terrific glory, thou hadst fall'n
Most honoured; and Remembrance, while she thought
Upon thy gallant end, had dried her tear!
Now far beyond the huge Atlantic wave
Thy bones decay; the withering pestilence,
That swept the islands of the western world,
Smote thee, untimely drooping to the tomb!
But 'tis enough; whate'er a soldier's fate,
That firm he hied him, where stern honour bade;
Though with unequal strength, he sunk and died. 

The Centennial Historical Theater was here
And what a grand time we all had
The folks from Spanish Cove joined in
And you know, their acting wasn’t too bad

The drama unfolded right before our eyes
It was an interesting and entertaining play
It told how the German’s settled in Oklahoma
How they loved it and decided to stay

It was certainly a lesson for all of us
I’m sure it is in the history books 
It was like that book was opened wide
And inside was a rare and wonderful look

Perhaps we’ll get to see them again
These talented actors from the theatre 
It was the very exciting and informative to see
They certainly had an artistic creator

I was guided by complete faith in certain belief
I used to get many tips or certain brief
It was helping to come to the near solution
I too was helped by strong resolution

Though it has ruled me from the day I gained conscience
I am not blind or averse to the fact of science
Some of the facts have definitely influenced
I my self have taken some decisions and distanced 

It shakes my faith towards philosophy of life
Many times I thought she could have been better wife
Seconds later it turned out to be best suited for inspiration
Emergence of perfect shadow in mind for imagination

She might have refused outright the proposal
Matter would have ended without any disposal
I wanted it to mature with dignity and honor
No more surprises but considered need of an hour

Her eye brows are simply seen as unique lines
Why do I think they are perfectly in match with mines? 
Do the eyes convey any special greetings? 
Is it simple invitation for secret meeting? 

I am unable to guess what her minds may speak
Thousand of thoughts cross over mind and sneak
Sometimes they puzzle me for future so bleak
It shivers me from within as if I am feeble and weak

It seems she has no refuge to seek solace and confide 
She has s o much pain in eyes but could not hide
She may burst into tears anytime as unexpected rain
Her tremendous efforts to stop it and see to it not go in vain

She has complete universal expression on her face
So has so much pain and anguish for unreasonable race
She has her own world to live with and rejoice
Not letting her emotions to be translated and expressed in voice

The language is not so difficult to understand
Vastness of sea can’t be measured by standing only on sand
You got to swim across the sea and dive to the sea bed
Hidden innumerable treasures found in form of while blue and red


Well no need to struggle to know her better
She can pen down her feelings better in letter
If not possible then try to read or follow
Soothe her feelings even if bitter pills to swallow

She is in her complete command
No specific request or particular demand
May be she is in search of honest company? 
No one can impose a will or access deny


Not every wino is a Holy Man. 
Oh, but some of them are. 
I love those who've learned
to sit comfortably 
for long periods with their hams
pressed against their calves, 
outdoors, 
with a wall for a back-rest, 
contentedly saying nothing.
These move about only when
necessary, 
on foot, and almost always
in pairs.
I think of them as oblates. 
or they thirst for it. 
They have looked into the eyes
unprotected by smoked glass. 

Oh, I can smile for you, and tilt my head, 
And drink your rushing words with eager lips, 
And paint my mouth for you a fragrant red, 
And trace your brows with tutored finger-tips. 
When you rehearse your list of loves to me, 
Oh, I can laugh and marvel, rapturous-eyed. 
And you laugh back, nor can you ever see 
The thousand little deaths my heart has died. 
And you believe, so well I know my part, 
That I am gay as morning, light as snow, 
And all the straining things within my heart 
You'll never know. 

Oh, I can laugh and listen, when we meet, 
And you bring tales of fresh adventurings, -- 
Of ladies delicately indiscreet, 
Of lingering hands, and gently whispered things. 
And you are pleased with me, and strive anew 
To sing me sagas of your late delights. 
Thus do you want me -- marveling, gay, and true, 
Nor do you see my staring eyes of nights. 
And when, in search of novelty, you stray, 
Oh, I can kiss you blithely as you go . . 
And what goes on, my love, while you're away, 
You'll never know. 

There are times when you feel 
unsafe and insecure 
about yourself that
you ain’t at all sure
If you’ll wake up the next day
And no matter the pain, 
no matter the sorrow
you still want to go on
be part of tomorrow.

Then, just to make yourself feel good
you scribble down a letter 
to an insurance firm
asking the details of the kinds of cover
it does offer.
Mailing it makes you feel better.

But deep down you know
Wherever you hide or go
You can’t cheat death
And an insurance company 
can do nothing, to save you.
It’s ridiculously stupid and funny.

lowly they fade, 
sharp jaw lines, 
strong limbs, 
firm skin.

Trees lose leaves 
in winter 
as we all
shed our youth.

Sounds evaporate, 
they peter 
in and out, 
out and in.

Soon a mist falls 
like a foggy haze, 
it blurs and blots 
the landscape.

Strength and vigor
leave us slyly, 
breathless, 
as they slip away.

The mirror's our 
one consolation.
We don't see 
so clearly now

and as a wintry sun 
winks and mocks
we lose the will 
to pair odd socks. 

A certain man wishes to be a prince
Of this earth; he also wants to be
A saint and master of the being-world.
Conscience cannot exist in the first:
The second cannot exist without conscience.
Therefore he, who has enough conscience
To be disturbed but not enough to be
Compelled, can neither reject the one
Nor follow the other.  

I have a dear friend that is dying
Given six months, thirty months ago
But on a daily basis
I don’t care if my existence ends
If only I could give my presence to her
What a strange juxtaposition
Her struggling to survive
Me, not worrying
Not caring
Her strength is phenomenal
After all this time, even her children have acquiesced
I can’t begin to grasp her mindset
The totality, finality of her disease
The daily struggles to endure
The intuitive yearning to breathe
And me
Not afraid or anxious
Impatiently anticipating demise
Knowing that there is no alternative
No option
The flickering; teases, torments, taunts
Would prescience alter thinking? 
A change in conviction modulate? 
I am ashamed
I have what others writhe for
Why can’t I embrace it

The night is still and cold and clear
I hear the church bells start to ring
And hear angelic Choirs sing: 

"Peace on Earth, Good will to men, 
This day a Savior is born for them."
A child is born to be a King, 
This is the essential thing."

A tree adorned with lights and glitter
in two weeks’ time will just be litter, 
Wrapping paper, ripped and torn, 
will be in landfills before too long.

Concentrate upon the star, 
The guiding light to who we are.
Never, ever condescend
To live in darkness
once again


To know women well
You need certain truth to tell
You have good heart in male
That is very much liked by female

If there is no respect for female
No good thoughts to think of and inhale
You may be called feminine
But there may be real famine

We may be strangulated
The birth place may be regulated
It will remain completely unrelated
Causes and problems are definitely related

She may remain as sex symbol
This is really pathetic hole
We blame her for everything as whole
She is centre of attraction for all

She has everything to excel
On all fronts doing exceptionally well
Carrying the home front and others as well
There is altogether complete story to tell

Can we regulate any thing on her or impose? 
Can’t we put trust in her or repose? 
Does it harm our interest or cause? 
We need to apply break or observe pause

Respect begets the respect
Shake well the conscience to introspect
It is real union or bond
Male n female relation must be cordially found


Vous me degoutez des mensonges, 
Des mensonges veridiques, 
Et de vos visages pieux, 
Et de vos mains larges et etendues
Accueillantes, faussement chretiennes, 
Tandis qu' au-dessous
Il y a la salete et la laideur, 
Et des coeurs pourris, 
Et des hyenes sauvages qui hurlent
Dans la terre desolee de votre coeur.

    __' To Certain.'  Langston Hughes.  (- . 

Let us see how civilized these people would be, 
When they are left with a week long power cut, 
Not running water taps, credit cards repossessed, 
The next destination not known and confused. 

A bull imprisoned in a stall
Broke boldly the confining wall,
And found himself, when out of bounds,
Within a washerwoman's grounds.
Where, hanging on a line to dry,
A crimson skirt inflamed his eye.
With bellowings that woke the dead,
He bent his formidable head,
With pointed horns and gnarly forehead;
Then, planting firm his shoulders horrid,
Began, with rage made half insane,
To paw the arid earth amain,
Flinging the dust upon his flanks
In desolating clouds and banks,
The while his eyes' uneasy white
Betrayed his doubt what foe the bright
Red tent concealed, perchance, from sight.
The garment, which, all undismayed,
Had never paled a single shade,
Now found a tongue-a dangling sock,
Left carelessly inside the smock:
'I must insist, my gracious liege,
That you'll be pleased to raise the siege:
My colors I will never strike.
I know your sex-you're all alike.
Some small experience I've had
You're not the first I've driven mad.

'A murdered poet? Is it true? 
What the hell should we do? 

Should we bid ourselves adiu? 
Should we cheer, should we boo? 
Should we shout into the blue? 
Should we gasp, should we coo? 
Should we drink the fallen dew? 
Make a coat of a newborn ewe? 
Mourn the loved and fallen few? 
Stop and hold us all with glue? 
Laugh at those of even hue? 
Cause I Never heard of one named Lou. 
Yes, cows are always saying moo, 
That of course, is nothing new. 
There’s nothing here for saying "oooo" 
Or sitting pious in a pew, 
Or standing in a pious queue, 
Or in Paris at the Rue. 
American’s will always sue. 
Yes they will, and me too.
So here’s a "Dear John" line for you: 
And all without a darkened view, 
There’s nothing left to win or woo, 
Nothing left but me and you. 
Surely seems like a lonely zooshot in the eye 
shot in the brain 
shot in the **** 
shot like a flower in the dance 

amazing how death wins hands down 
amazing how much credence is given to idiot forms of life 

amazing how laughter has been drowned out 
amazing how viciousness is such a constant 

I must soon declare my own war on their war 
I must hold to my last piece of ground 
I must protect the small space I have made that has allowed me life 

my life not their death 
my death not their death-quiet and wondering
here I am with broken wing
can’t move.  can’t breathe
alone again

you and I never give up
to troubles coming everyday
we always smile to crisis that comes

we’ll never leave an empty place 
a chance to dominate our hearts
love is filled with honesty
sincerity seen at first sight. 

ocean’s floor never dries 
always wet by our untiring love
excited lips and hungry moves
disturb the silence of the night. 

i like the way you understand
the way you comprehend
the way you take in
no matter what-you’re all I ever need.  

There she stood on the subway platform
Not just beautiful, gorgeous, no, a goddess
Sent down from Heaven to drive men wild
And at that moment, she smiled at me

I couldn't trust myself to speak
For fear I'd sound like a jerk
So I just smiled back at her
And then, our train pulled in

Inside the train she sat next to me
And like I always do I began a writing a poem
I could sense her reading what I wrote
Then suddenly she said 'that's beautiful'
I looked up and gazed into hazel eyes highlighted with flecks of gold
'Not as beautiful as you' I replied
'Thank you' she said blushing

We started talking about this and about that
And found out we had nothing in common
At least not enough to build a relationship on
But enough to become friends so we did

Every now and then we meet on the subway
And will gladly tell each other our latest
And she bitches to me about her boyfriend

And though we will never be more than friends
I'm thankful I had the chance to meet her
Because one can never really have too many friends
And this one certainly is beautiful


Did you ever come in a chance to miss? 
When life was running smooth and at ease
What made you to involve in extra affair? 
Considered to be unethical and unfair

Kiss gives indication of lovely miss
Wife may know it without any miss
She may wait for chance not to miss
To some bad luck miss may escape no miss

There will be a war scene at gate
You may curse your lovely fate
Wife may not like it to state
But score will be leveled at any rate


Nothing has changed around
Everything is in order and nicely found
There is no dramatic change or any deviation
There is no abnormality in question

Everything is there as usual
Even if we notice as casual
There may be slight variation in nature
Any change is welcome for the future

What a lovely morning with fine dews
Show of magical spell for the views
Its slow disappearance from the scene
No where it can be presented or seen

Golden rays falling delicately on the ground
Birds present melodious melancholy with sound
Human life comes to awareness with emergence of the day
Surely to look forward and find some way

With day light to it s full zenith
Entire world is heaving under the beneath
Many new arrivals with meeting of certain deaths
Some where floral tributes and some where floral wreaths

Change is always integral part of the system
No one can even slightly alter them
It is already beautiful and nothing more to add
It is in your hand to feel so good or even bad

There is no disharmony and looks so congenial
We got to accept it and offer no denial
It is human psychology to present something new
It is for others to accept it or take it for review

The sun can’t be shadowed by human being
Such foolish orders can’t be accepted even from king
Anything thought or acted contrary
May make it redundant and unnecessary

Add some color or fragrance
See and feel it in everybody’s presence
You have no other way than to fall to its dictates
You may have immense pleasure as it indicates


All these years I was running for shelter and cover 
can you see wounds inflicted on my body? 
It is cruel tale  but in fact done by somebody

I shall make him to pay dearly, 
I have waited for it to happen but missed nearly, 
I want no escape for him and allow him barely
She will never be seen in public life or seen rarely

I was simply her follower
She was one of my closest and among fewer
Her every appearance was making me to delight
I used to think about her and very eager to invite fight

She used to remain very cool and light
She will not appreciate any fight
She was of course not weakest object
She was there with full enthusiasm to inject

I never used to joke with her
She was not that cheap to be found here
I used to respect her sentiments and enjoy
She was source of happiness and joy
 
She may be proving very symbol of love, 
I was never afraid to steer and drove
I preferred look down and not above
She simply laughed at me as she had nothing to prove 

Today, I am different person and may draw sword, 
prove my self worthy of her love without any word
I shall block her from coming without tying cord

I watched her treacherous move
I stood helplessly and thought how to prove
I took all precaution and tried improve
She remained adamant and unmoved

I was burning inside with rage 
I was knocking like wounded tiger in cage
Earth and stars may watch it helplessly
I shall stand in disgrace and shoot at aimlessly

It makes me insane with laud laugh
It has made me weak and not tough  
I am determined to show my revenge coolly
I shall bear the pain later fully, 




I think of blackening her face with dirt
This should only be punishment for flirt
Torture for long years on me should be fined, 
I used to express happiness when she smiled, 

and I may make it more interesting
It will be crucial time for testing
I shall not relax and go for resting
I am aghast at for such twisting

Love is known for sacrifice
No one can afford to loose and feel nice
She may not dare to come out for days
surely I will make it difficult for her always

I may remind her all time for her torture
She may always worry for her future
She may cry all the time to find insecure
I shall point at her and make it doubly sure

I have witnessed down trend
I was all the time ready to mend
She was not lover but as dear friend
I failed to know why she changed at the end


How can one, explain, what they feel, 
inside? On the surface, it seems like
one thing, but it's really a roller coaster, 
ride. One minute your up, the next, you're
down, you may feel like smiling and then, 
comes the frown. All kinds of emotions, go
through your mind, as you look for the answer, 
but can't find. You try your best, to make light
of everything, knowing quite well, what the
consequences, will bring. Always try hard, to
find something nice, to think about, this is
sure, to change your mood. Every time, you
feel down and out, keep this in mind and it
definitely, will help, your attitude

I threw in 
face cream, 
slippers, 
tops.
I added a few 
sexy frocks.
My daddy's picture, 
old emotions, 
fears, anxieties, 
hearts devotions.
I threw in letters
I had written, 
and little things
that had me smitten
and then I sat 
upon the lot
and tried to get the
thing to lock.
I should have 
known, 
I should have 
guessed, 
I'd put in
one too many
vests, 
so I unpacked, 
sat down with glee
and had a soothing
cup of tea. 

Now the new chum loaded his three-nought-three, 
It's a small-bore gun, but his hopes were big. 
"I am fed to the teeth with old ewe," said he, 
"And I might be able to shoot a pig
 

And he trusted more to his nose than ear 
To give him warning when pigs were near. 

Out of his lair in the lignum dark. 
Where the wild duck nests and the bilbie digs, 
With a whoof and a snort and a kind of bark 
There rose the father of all the pigs: 
And a tiger would have walked wide of him 
As he stropped his tusks on a leaning limb. 

Then the new chum's three-nought-three gave tongue 
Like a popgun fired in an opera bouffe: 
But a pig that was old when the world was young 
Is near as possible bullet-proof. 
(The more you shoot him the less he dies, 
Unless you catch him between the eyes.) 

So the new chum saw it was up to him 
To become extinct if he stopped to shoot; 
So he made a leap for a gidgee limb 
While the tusker narrowly missed his boot. 
Then he found a fork, where he swayed in air 
As he gripped the boughs like a native bear. 

The pig sat silent and gaunt and grim 
To wait and wait till his foe should fall: 
For night and day were the same to him, 
And home was any old place at all. 
"I must wait," said he, "till this sportsman drops; 
I could use his boots for a pair of strops
 


The crows that watch from the distant blue 
Came down to see what it all might mean; 
An eaglehawk and a cockatoo 
Bestowed their patronage on the scene. 
Till a far-off boundary rider said 
"I must have a look -- there is something dead
 


Of a dried-up chop from a tough old ewe. 
Says he, "It's better than native bear 
And nearly as tender as kangaroo. 
An emu's egg I can masticate, 
But pork," says he, "is the thing I hate

"The sun was bright, the leaves aglow
When I was young, long, long ago

When life did not pass in a bang and a flash
When time seemed a game- there was nothing too rash
To try. When fire burned without turning to ash-

Then I was at leisure. Ready and fresh 
As the day. And I went 

Looking for something: for some moist treasure 
Or other, something proud, something free 
Something that lived in a watery cave, rising 
To my will, willing, guileful but unsurprising, 
Sweet and modish.. Something that would be 
Worth the seeking – a precise, pretty pleasure.

Pride I found. In plenty. 
A proud mind, proud heart, above all, proud flesh, 

Fine and fierce: -a  wonder well beyond my wish
And to think. I went there looking for a dish
Of quite another kind. I did not hook my fish.  

But all was well.- too well I know. 
Now that the winds of  old age blow. 

Infatuation is ever changing
as a cloud in passing. 
Trees developing leaves
turning from green, gold and
brown.

Strong trade winds whip them 
to the ground
lying there returning
to mother earth and vanish

A lady changing her attire.
Putting on and taking off her
make-up, so is infatuation.

Ever changing like the seasons
from warm to hot, then cool
finally cold.

Cool in the Spring warming
for Summer hot and passionate.
Autumn winds tend to cool off
preparing for the icy gusts
of winter.

Images of what was, but is no
more. Infatuation a changing
emotion. 

Forth from Calais, at dawn of night, when sunset summer on autumn shone,
    Fared the steamer alert and loud through seas whence only the sun was gone:
    Soft and sweet as the sky they smiled, and bade man welcome: a dim sweet hour
    Gleamed and whispered in wind and sea, and heaven was fair as a field in flower,
    Stars fulfilled the desire of the darkling world as with music: the star-bright air
    Made the face of the sea, if aught may make the face of the sea, more fair.
    Whence came change? Was the sweet night weary of rest? What anguish awoke in the dark?
    Sudden, sublime, the strong storm spake: we heard the thunders as hounds that bark.
    Lovelier if aught may be lovelier than stars, we saw the lightnings exalt the sky,
  Living and lustrous and rapturous as love that is born but to quicken and lighten and die.
  Heaven's own heart at its highest of delight found utterance in music and semblance in fire:
  Thunder on thunder exulted, rejoicing to live and to satiate the night's desire.
  And the night was alive and an-hungered of life as a tiger from toils cast free:
  And a rapture of rage made joyous the spirit and strength of the soul of the sea.
  All the weight of the wind bore down on it, freighted with death for fraught:
  And the keen waves kindled and quickened as things transfigured or things distraught.
  And madness fell on them laughing and leaping; and madness came on the wind:
  And the might and the light and the darkness of storm were as storm in the heart of Ind.
  Such glory, such terror, such passion, as lighten and harrow the far fierce East,
  Rang, shone, spake, shuddered around us: the night was an altar with death for priest.
  The channel that sunders England from shores where never was man born free
  Was clothed with the likeness and thrilled with the strength and the wrath of a tropic sea.
  As a wild steed ramps in rebellion, and rears till it swerves from a backward fall,
  The strong ship struggled and reared, and her deck was upright as a sheer cliff's wall.
  Stern and prow plunged under, alternate: a glimpse, a recoil, a breath,
  And she sprang as the life in a god made man would spring at the throat of death.
  Three glad hours, and it seemed not an hour of supreme and supernal joy,
  Filled full with delight that revives in remembrance a sea-bird's heart in a boy.
  For the central crest of the night was cloud that thundered and flamed, sublime
  As the splendour and song of the soul everlasting that quickens the pulse of time.
  The glory beholden of man in a vision, the music of light overheard,
  The rapture and radiance of battle, the life that abides in the fire of a word,
  In the midmost heaven enkindled, was manifest far on the face of the sea,
  And the rage in the roar of the voice of the waters was heard but when heaven breathed free.
  Far eastward, clear of the covering of cloud, the sky laughed out into light
  From the rims of the storm to the sea's dark edge with flames that were flowerlike and white.
  The leaping and luminous blossoms of live sheet lightning that laugh as they fade
  From the cloud's black base to the black wave's brim rejoiced in the light they made.
  Far westward, throned in a silent sky, where life was in lustrous tune,
  Shone, sweeter and surer than morning or evening, the steadfast smile of the moon.
  The limitless heaven that enshrined them was lovelier than dreams may behold, and deep
  As life or as death, revealed and transfigured, may shine on the soul through sleep.
  All glories of toil and of triumph and passion and pride that it yearns to know
  Bore witness there to the soul of its likeness and kinship, above and below.
  The joys of the lightnings, the songs of the thunders, the strong sea's labour and rage,
  Were tokens and signs of the war that is life and is joy for the soul to wage.
  No thought strikes deeper or higher than the heights and the depths that the night made bare,
  Illimitable, infinite, awful and joyful, alive in the summit of air--  
  Air stilled and thrilled by the tempest that thundered between its reign and the sea's,
  Rebellious, rapturous, and transient as faith or as terror that bows men's knees.
  No love sees loftier and fairer the form of its godlike vision in dreams
  Than the world shone then, when the sky and the sea were as love for a breath's length seems--
  One utterly, mingled and mastering and mastered and laughing with love that subsides
  As the glad mad night sank panting and satiate with storm, and released the tides.
  In the dense mid channel the steam-souled ship hung hovering, assailed and withheld
  As a soul born royal, if life or if death be against it, is thwarted and quelled.
  As the glories of myriads of glow-worms in lustrous grass on a boundless lawn
  Were the glories of flames phosphoric that made of the water a light like dawn.
  A thousand Phosphors, a thousand Hespers, awoke in the churning sea,
    And the swift soft hiss of them living and dying was clear as a tune could be;
  As a tune that is played by the fingers of death on the keys of life or of sleep,
  Audible alway alive in the storm, too fleet for a dream to keep:
  Too fleet, too sweet for a dream to recover and thought to remember awake:
  Light subtler and swifter than lightning, that whispers and laughs in the live storm's wake,
  In the wild bright wake of the storm, in the dense loud heart of the labouring hour,
  A harvest of stars by the storm's hand reaped, each fair as a star-shaped flower.
  And sudden and soft as the passing of sleep is the passing of tempest seemed
  When the light and the sound of it sank, and the glory was gone as a dream half dreamed.
  The glory, the terror, the passion that made of the midnight a miracle, died,
  Not slain at a stroke, nor in gradual reluctance abated of power and of pride;
  With strong swift subsidence, awful as power that is wearied of power upon earth,
  The might of the night subsided: the tyranny kindled in darkness fell:
  And the sea and the sky put off them the rapture and radiance of heaven and of hell.
  The waters, heaving and hungering at heart, made way, and were wellnigh fain,
  For the ship that had fought them, and wrestled, and revelled in labour, to cease from her pain.
  And an end was made of it: only remembrance endures of the glad loud strife;
  And the sense that a rapture so royal may come not again in the passage of life. 

The damned ship lurched and slithered.  Quiet and quick
 My cold gorge rose; the long sea rolled; I knew
I must think hard of something, or be sick;
 And could think hard of only one thing -- YOU!
You, you alone could hold my fancy ever!
 And with you memories come, sharp pain, and dole.
Now there's a choice -- heartache or tortured liver!
 A sea-sick body, or a you-sick soul!

Do I forget you?  Retchings twist and tie me,
 Old meat, good meals, brown gobbets, up I throw.
Do I remember?  Acrid return and slimy,
 The sobs and slobber of a last years woe.
And still the sick ship rolls.  'Tis hard, I tell ye,
To choose 'twixt love and nausea, heart and belly. 

This intends to be a chant to Life
To every moment of joy, even strife
To every thread of inspiration
All privileges and incantation

To wise thoughts and deep insights
Imparted to others - days and nights
To everyone's quest for happiness
And acceptance of sadness

To daily throbs of hearts passionate
Embracing love - pure, ultimate
To every human achievement
Towards the world's development

To nations' struggles for their progress
Aimed at their children's peace, happiness
A chant to the Most Saviour
To Him we highly praise thanking for every favour

If the world around you brings grief
And you hardly find relief, 
Then seek the spiritual pole comforting your soul.

If your country rulers don't care
For the people's education, health, welfare, 
Let sunbeams illuminate their minds
For the better of people's life and daydreams.

If people noble values forget
And their ancestors do not respect, 
Help them listen for the sublime voice of silence
That's of paramount importance! 

If warships stay on the shore
And innocent children live no more, 
Send waves of compassion, sympathy
For their families missing them ever more.

Please keep struggling for a peaceful chance
You shall be alive, hopefully
Understanding this complex life dance

Have you ever had? 
A chaos of thought
Rampaging through 
Your brain

You think all at once
And hope and pray
That you remember
The concepts and thoughts


I marvel how Nature could ever find space 
For so many strange contrasts in one human face: 
There's thought and no thought, and there's paleness and bloom 
And bustle and sluggishness, pleasure and gloom. 

There's weakness, and strength both redundant and vain; 
Such strength as, if ever affliction and pain 
Could pierce through a temper that's soft to disease, 
Would be rational peace--a philosopher's ease. 

There's indifference, alike when he fails or succeeds, 
And attention full ten times as much as there needs; 
Pride where there's no envy, there's so much of joy; 
And mildness, and spirit both forward and coy. 

There's freedom, and sometimes a diffident stare 
Of shame scarcely seeming to know that she's there, 
There's virtue, the title it surely may claim, 
Yet wants heaven knows what to be worthy the name. 

This picture from nature may seem to depart, 
Yet the Man would at once run away with your heart; 
And I for five centuries right gladly would be 
Such an odd such a kind happy creature as he. 

How often do I wish I were
What people call a character;
A ripe and cherubic old chappie
Who lives to make his fellows happy;
With in his eyes a merry twinkle,
And round his lips a laughing wrinkle;
Who radiating hope and cheer
Grows kindlier with every year.
For this ideal let me strive,
And keep the lad in me alive;
Nor argument nor anger know,
But my own way serenly go;
The woes of men to understand,
Yet walk with humour hand in hand;
To love each day and wonder why
Folks are not so jocund as I.

So be you simple, decent, kind,
With gentle heart and quiet mind;
And if to righteous anger stung,
Restrain your temper and your toungue.
Let thought for others be your guide,
And patience triumph over pride . . .
With charity for those who err,
Live life so folks may say you were--

Take of English earth as much
As either hand may rightly clutch.
In the taking of it breathe
Prayer for all who lie beneath.
Not the great nor well-bespoke,
But the mere uncounted folk
Of whose life and death is none
Report or lamentation.
Lay that earth upon thy heart,
And thy sickness shall depart!

It shall sweeten and make whole
Fevered breath and festered soul.
It shall mightily restrain
Over-busied hand and brain.
It shall ease thy mortal strife
'Gainst the immortal woe of life,
Till thyself, restored, shall prove
By what grace the Heavens do move.

Take of English flowers these --
Spring's full-vaced primroses,
Summer's wild wide-hearted rose,
Autumn's wall-flowerr of the close,
And, thy darkness to illume,
Winter's bee-thronged ivy-bloom.
Seek and serve them where they bide
For these simples, used aright,
Can restore a failing sight.

These shall cleanse and purify
Webbed and inward-turning eye;
These shall show thee treasure hid,
Thy familiar fields amid;
And reveal (which is thy need)
Every man a King indeed!A Charm invests a face
Imperfectly beheld—
The Lady dare not lift her Veil
For fear it be dispelled—

But peers beyond her mesh—
And wishes—and denies—
Lest Interview—annul a want
That Image—satisfies—Sometimes I kind of feel sad and bored
I tell Him just what has been bothering me
I know He understands and He will see

Just what I need to do to turn it all around
Just out in nature where I can feel
What’s important to me and what is real

And He knows just how to plant a seed
Of truth and peace and what I need to do
And you know, my friend, it will work for you

Just sit yourself down or take a walk
Get all ready for a nice little talk
So when you’re feeling sad and bored 

Long years ago we said our vows, 
Which ended with a kiss; 
In thinking on those years, I see
Some trials, some tears and bliss.

I oft time lead in many ways, 
But sometime lean on her; 
Though mutual sharing is our goal, 
That oft does not occur.

My friends think I'm aggressive, 
That seems my natural bent; 
We walk the married road, perhaps

Our children honor and respect, 
That greatly pleases us; 
The tender harmony we share
Is an even greater plus.

Please pardon, please this age'ed male, 
Raised in a different clime; 
Forgive him for he has become
A symbol of his time.

Both praise or criticism would be
appreciated. Perhaps it would clear my mind. 

Munhall, to save my soul you bravely try,
Although, to save my soul, I can't say why.
'Tis naught to you, to me however much
Why, bless it! you might save a million such
Yet lose your own; for still the 'means of grace'
That you employ to turn us from the place
By the arch-enemy of souls frequented
Are those which to ensnare us he invented!
I do not say you utter falsehoods-I
Would scorn to give to ministers the lie:
They cannot fight-their calling has estopped it.
True, I did not persuade them to adopt it.
But, Munhall, when you say the Devil dwells
In all the breasts of all the infidels
Making a lot of individual Hells
In gentlemen instinctively who shrink
From thinking anything that you could think,
You talk as I should if some world I trod
I don't at all object-forbid it Heaven!
That your discourse you temperately leaven
With airy reference to wicked souls
Cursing impenitent on glowing coals,
Nor quarrel with your fancy, blithe and fine,
Which represents the wickedest as mine.
Each ornament of style my spirit eases:
The subject saddens, but the manner pleases.
But when you 'deal damnation round' 'twere sweet
To think hereafter that you did not cheat.
Deal, and let all accept what you allot 'em.
But, blast you! you are dealing from the bottom

Lovely day for a Cherub to descend! 
Muses get your Cithara out! 
Roses bloom and Robin sings
Shaisha stands guard 
Where lies the baby Kumar
Parvati shaped him
With turmeric and gold
Silvery dust of moon to adorn
Like a pink cotton candy
His is a beauty to behold
Unmatched in his velour
Pride and joy of his mother
Stands tall with his father
Oh! The waiting grand parents
Not to mention uncle and aunts
So anxious to dole out
A hug and a kiss to blow out
Waiting! waiting! waiting! 
An angel is descending 

Well! Well! Well! 
The bundle of joy is here
With all the love and care

With hugs and kisses
Happy Grandma


Life is like playing a chess.
Life is moving in a slow pace.
Unknowing of whats happening next.
Each twists and turns comes in surprises.
It's just an calculations.
Some times it may work, 
Some times it may not.

One step forward, 
With two steps backward.
Just missed a step, 
Chopped is the head.
Aren't we in that place.

Life will move on fighting and defending, 
But many things get lost on the way.
Protecting one, 
Moves forward or retreat backward.
Sometimes forced or ready to attack.
Though never wanted to.
Some one is cut off protecting self.
Some times a simple jealousy may, 
be the reason for attack.
The fight keeps on going till the end.
Even though one may want to leave the ground.
Once started you cannot quit.
Either you win or die.
Thats the rule in the battle field.

Finally. 
When the winner is declared.
With a Checkmate.
Just turn around and see, 
How many have you lost.
The lost ones may be your Dear Ones.

Did I win to loose everything 
or did I loose everything to win.

I am confused.
Whether I should.
Celebrate the Success, 
Or 
Celebrate the Failure.

Yes, Life is a Chess! 



A child,
Curious and innocent,
Slips from his Nurse, and rejoicing
Loses himself in the Fair.

Thro' the jostle and din
Wandering, he revels,
Dreaming, desiring, possessing;
Till, of a sudden
Tired and afraid, he beholds
The sordid assemblage
Just as it is; and he runs
With a sob to his Nurse
(Lighting at last on him),
And in her motherly bosom
Cries him to sleep.

Thus thro' the World,
Seeing and feeling and knowing,
Goes Man: till at last,
Tired of experience, he turns
To the friendly and comforting breast
Of the old nurse, Death. 

Before tiny hands
touched the raindrops, 
before she smiled, 
before little feet
made a splash, 
before all that. 

Before the sun
made her eyes squint, 
before the grass
made her nose twitch, 
before her heart did a leap
before all that. 

Before the night
made her fearful, 
before the dark
left her spooked
before the cat scratched
before all that.

I didn't see the light shine
never heard the rainfall
didn't understand
the colours of our world
but now I'm born again, 
just like that. 

wanderer of blue eyes
and silver seeking hair
following a white moth
you will not wonder long
why white wings transform
to green leaves and orange fruit
in a twinkling as the wind shifts
you want neither intoxicant
nor philosophy
nor squirming guesses
but turning your head
to your smiling mother
you laugh
and scan the grass
for newness


I'm a child again, 
as memories come flooding back.
Here I am standing outside my old school
which is due to be demolished for something more modern.

Nobody's about, all is silence, except for the birds
chattering away in the same old Elm tree 
which still stands against the side of the bicycle shed.

Such a strange feeling, something I can't describe.

I lift the latch on the gate, and walk through
into the playground, and pause awhile.

Voices seem to echo in the air around me.

Ah! Sarah, the noisy one with the ginger hair, into every scrape, 
always a whirlwind.  Unstoppable was Sarah.

Robert the shy, reserved one.  Never mixed much, a bit of a loner really.
I heard somewhere, that he'd become a lawyer or something.

And, Yes. Jenny.  Who could forget Jenny.
Jenny Mc


Kenny, who was clever at everything, 
always laughing, always smiling, always your friend.

I wonder where they are now.
All have gone forever.
A terrible loneliness is creeping over me.

Why did I come. To refresh my memories, perhaps, 
some bad, some good.

So long ago now, that they all feel good to me, 
tinged with a sadness in my heart for what has been.

I'm reliving those memories of when I was a child, 
with the hopes and thoughts of a child.

Moving towards the gate, unthinking as usual.
I'm forgetting to close it
like I used to do all those years ago.

I must turn around and close it now

And then there was our teacher, Mrs Saunders.

Oh My! What's this, a tear? .

            Weary childhood's mandragore,
        From his pretty eyes have sunken
            Pleasures, to make room for more- -
Sleeping near the withered nosegay, which he pulled the day before.

        Nosegays! leave them for the waking:
            Throw them earthward where they grew.
        Dim are such, beside the breaking
            Amaranths he looks unto- -
Folded eyes see brighter colours than the open ever do.

        Heaven-flowers, rayed by shadows golden
            From the paths they sprang beneath,
        Now perhaps divinely holden,
            Swing against him in a wreath- -
We may think so from the quickening of his bloom and of his breath.

        Vision unto vision calleth,
            While the young child dreameth on.
        Fair, O dreamer, thee befalleth
            With the glory thou hast won! 
Darker wert thou in the garden, yestermorn, by summer sun.

        We should see the spirits ringing
            Round thee,- -were the clouds away.
        'Tis the child-heart draws them, singing
            In the silent-seeming clay- -
Singing! - -Stars that seem the mutest, go in music all the way.

        As the moths around a taper,
            As the bees around a rose,
        As the gnats around a vapour,- -
            So the Spirits group and close
Round about a holy childhood, as if drinking its repose.

        Shapes of brightness overlean thee,- -
            Flash their diadems of youth
        On the ringlets which half screen thee,- -
            While thou smilest,.  not in sooth
Thy smile.  but the overfair one, dropt from some aethereal mouth.

        Haply it is angels' duty,
            During slumber, shade by shade:
        To fine down this childish beauty
            To the thing it must be made,
Ere the world shall bring it praises, or the tomb shall see it fade.

        Softly, softly! make no noises! 
            Now he lieth dead and dumb- -
        Now he hears the angels' voices
            Folding silence in the room- -
Now he muses deep the meaning of the Heaven-words as they come.

        Speak not! he is consecrated- -
            Breathe no breath across his eyes.
        Lifted up and separated,
In a sweetness beyond touching- -held in cloistral sanctities.

        Could ye bless him- -father- -mother? 
            Bless the dimple in his cheek? 
        Dare ye look at one another,
            And the benediction speak? 
Would ye not break out in weeping, and confess yourselves too weak? 

        He is harmless- -ye are sinful,- -
            Ye are troubled- -he, at ease:
        From his slumber, virtue winful
            Floweth outward with increase- -
Dare not bless him! but be blessed by his peace- -and go in peace. 

All the time in the world
Can never be as precious
As the years your child grows
It is a luxury of the ambitious

Although minutes are impounded
With things that must be done
Chores and working for a dollar
Should not eliminate the fun

Children are a marvel to observe
Each moment becomes more satisfying
Even when the days are challenging
Rewards of success are gratifying 

When the hours of budding have dissolved
An adult emerges and comprehends
With joy and laughter, remembering when-  
The moments continue to give dividends 

alking on this lonely road of lost memories
I remember the dawn of my day
of the innocent child
who brought joy to everyone's heart
but also sorrow
this child was tormented
by an unknown pain that couldnt be healed
it brought dark days in this child's silent world
he felt the loss of comfort
the touch of their sweet words
couldn't cut through the deafning winds
it brought no peace to him in all his years
it only left him empty


I am a tribal child, living in the forest thrones, 
Where fireflies light the mangrove crowns, 
The sago trees are here to be the granules of starch, 
The hungry crocodiles in the water look for our tiny limbs, 
The glittering eyes of the jungle cat and bees swarm, 
Our hens are stationed under the wooden platforms, 
Where I cuddle with my mummy half naked, not by choice, 
The rain forest has the canopy for us to be dry, to rejoice, 
The smell of kerosene lit lamps and burnt woods, 
The perfect scent that anyone can breathe in our abode, 
The precious colorful beads are shells and seeds, 
We blame the spirits for our every illness, 
We cream our nerves with herbs of green, 
We wall for miles to go to a school sponsored, 
Our books are always wet when we return, 
Riding the boats in the dancing rivers, 
Where the monkeys play with their relatives, 
When the air from the north goes down to south, 
Where my poor parents toil to be alive, 
We have contributed nothing to the mankind, 
As the satellites are not ours, but the stars, 
Our trees exist as we exist as poor and deprived. 

Testosterone muscled men have, 
The Top and the center, the caves, 
Something is there to do the basic, 
Nothing is there to think angelic, 
Given the work, they do sincerely, 
As the kids in the play school aviary, 
The children long to be praised, 
The children need to be reminded, 
The children want to be around, 
The loving hearts that care, 
In each and every man, there is a child, 
That long for the love of a mother, 
When the women identify that child, 
They have the responsible man in the household, 
When the women take good care of that child, 
They have the obedient handyman in the household.
When the women try to be funny with that child
The child will be the runaway kid, 
Likes to play truant, shows the authority, 
Displays tantrums and becomes juvenile delinquent.
Identify and rear that child efficiently.. 

take a deep breath little one
hold the hands and numbers inside your chest
open your eye to all, see it all
because either there is a red signal, or nothing whatsoever
exist not in the back your mind, exist as the world; 
the clouds, the skies, the heat, the stars, the planets, the nothingness
and you will be everything
take a deep breath little one. 

Have you ever 
Had a moment
Were you are 
Lying in a field 

The sun shines
Upon your face
As you bury 
Yourself in a sea
Of tall green grass

Then as you gaze 
Up into the sky
At the white fluffy clouds
That passes on by
Your imagination flares
In a creative style

Fairytale Characters
Magical beings
Cloud your imagination
In a child's world of dreams

Then stretching 
Out your arms
To pillow your
Sleepy head
You gaze up in wonder
In a child like bliss

The laughter of friends
Playing in the sun
Make you smile
In a dream like state

And in that 
One singular moment
That one blissful state
You are who you are


He was just a little kid
In a kid’s kind of world
Examining the places
Where the red dirt swirled

Hills and little trenches
To climb and investigate
Thoughts and visions
For a child to create

There’s no better place
For a youngster to enjoy
Than in the red dirt country
They don’t even need a toy

Just old-fashioned imagination
That all little children possess
Tucked into their little heads
Many things they can access

There’s nothing like watching
A child in a world of red dirt
Let’s imagine we’re a kid again
You know, it wouldn’t hurt

When to the garden of untroubled thought
I came of late, and saw the open door,
And wished again to enter, and explore
The sweet, wild ways with stainless bloom inwrought,
And bowers of innocence with beauty fraught,
It seemed some purer voice must speak before
I dared to tread that garden loved of yore,
That Eden lost unknown and found unsought.

Then just within the gate I saw a child, --
A stranger-child, yet to my heart most dear;
He held his hands to me, and softly smiled
With eyes that knew no shade of sin or fear:
"Come in," he said, "and play awhile with me;"
"I am the little child you used to be

"a child, a child, a child is born
to a mother who lies near death;

There's not an echo round me,
But I am glad should learn,
How pure a fire has found me,
The love with which I burn.
For none attends with pleasure
To what I would reveal;
They slight me out of measure,
And laugh at all I feel.

The rocks receive less proudly
The story of my flame;
When I approach, they loudly
Reverberate his name.
I speak to them of sadness,
And comforts at a stand;
They bid me look for gladness,
And better days at hand.

Far from all habitation,
I heard a happy sound;
Big with the consolation,
That I have often found.
I said, 'My lot is sorrow,
My grief has no alloy;
The rocks replied--'Tomorrow,
Tomorrow brings thee joy.'

These sweet and sacred tidings,
What bliss it is to hear!
For, spite of all my chidings,
My weakness and my fear,
No sooner I receive them,
Than I forget my pain,
And, happy to believe them,
I love as much again.

I fly to scenes romantic,
Where never men resort;
For in an age so frantic
Impiety is sport.
For riot and confusion
They barter things above;
Condemning, as delusion,
The joy of perfect love.

In this sequestered corner,
None hears what I express;
Delivered from the scorner,
What peace do I possess!
Beneath the boughs reclining,
Or roving o'er the wild,
I live as undesigning
And harmless as a child.

No troubles here surprise me,
I innocently play,
While Providence supplies me,
And guards me all the day:
My dear and kind defender
Preserves me safely here,
From men of pomp and splendour,
Who fill a child with fear. 

Do you know who your father is? 
I know mine, I am a Child Of The King! 
My Father is unlimited in His abilities, 
Readily equipped to do any and everything.

My Father resides on a Heavenly Throne, 
A King so powerful He sits there alone, 
The Prince Of Peace, every day and night

Although His address is the entire universe, 
He’s centrally positioned in the middle of the sky, 
Nothing sneaks by this Majestic Presence, 
Omnipotent is my Father, that’s the reason why.

From the very beginning of creation & time itself, 
My Father the King has always been in control, 
Familiar with the innermost thoughts of your mind, 
And the workings from the very depths of your soul.

Galatians   but when the fulness of time was come, 
John   greater in me than he who is in the world, 
We're born not of preference, race, religion, just boy or girl.

You may be surprised at the things you read and hear, 
Instead of accepting teachings and doctrines He holds near, 
Father always knew how perilous the world would become, 
Because many choose to be sons & daughters of the evil one.

John  &  what love the Father hath bestowed on the family, 
There's no need to knock on the door because I have my own key, 
Being a Child Of The King is for everyone and acceptance is free.

Although fully aware this life is only a temporary fixture, 
Shake me, wake me, tell me what’s wrong with this picture? 
Why choose forever with pain and suffering in a lake of fire? 
When your Brother gave His life for you to be accepted higher.

There’s no reason to lie on job applications or credit card forms, 
It’s your Father’s pleasure to give you more than the norm, 
Remember, in all that is done, you are A Child Of The King. 

There is heard a hymn when the panes are dim, 
And never before or again, 
When the nights are strong with a darkness long, 
And the dark is alive with rain. 

Never we know but in sleet and in snow, 
The place where the great fires are, 
That the midst of the earth is a raging mirth 
And the heart of the earth a star. 

And at night we win to the ancient inn 
Where the child in the frost is furled, 
We follow the feet where all souls meet 
At the inn at the end of the world. 

The gods lie dead where the leaves lie red, 
For the flame of the sun is flown, 
The gods lie cold where the leaves lie gold, 
And a Child comes forth alone. 

I lay down on my living room floor
Convinced that the world would end.
A crisis off Cuba with missiles in route.
Yes, I am a Child of Then.

A lady in pink with blood on her dress.
A President shot in the head
I remember where I was exactly that day
Yes, I am a Child of Then.

Police battle Blacks, Watts is in flames
Protests rage on without end.
King is dead at the hand of a bigoted man
Yes, I am a Child of Then.

Camelots heir sought to bind up the wounds
Then Sirhan Sirhan shot him dead.
Bobby bled out on the kitchen tiled floor
Yes, I am a Child of Then.

Asian girl running, naked, on a dirt country road.
A Viet Cong man shot in the head
Fifty Eight Thousand names on a wall
Yes, I am a Child of Then. 

SILENT and amazed, even when a little boy,

   As contending against some being or influence. 

Praise of the knights of old
May sleep: their tale is told,
And no man cares:
The praise which fires our lips is
A knight's whose fame eclipses
All of theirs.

The ruddiest light in heaven
Blazed as his birth-star seven
Long years ago:
All glory crown that old year
Which brought our stout small soldier
With the snow!

Each baby born has one
Star, for his friends a sun,
The first of stars:
And we, the more we scan it,
The more grow sure your planet,
Child, was Mars.

For each one flower, perchance,
Blooms as his cognizance:
The snowdrop chill,
The violet unbeholden,
For some: for you the golden
Daffodil.

Erect, a fighting flower,
It breasts the breeziest hour
That ever blew,
And bent or broke things brittle
Or frail, unlike a little
Knight like you.

Its flower is firm and fresh
And stout like sturdiest flesh
Of children: all
The strenuous blast that parches
Spring hurts it not till March is
Near his fall.

If winds that prate and fret
Lament, or blame
The brave plant's martial passion,
It keeps its own free fashion
All the same.

We that would fain seem wise
Assume grave mouths and eyes
Whose looks reprove
Too much delight in battle:
But your great heart our prattle
Cannot move.

We say, small children should
Be placid, mildly good
And blandly meek:
Whereat the broad smile rushes
Full on your lips, and flushes
All your cheek.

If all the stars that are
Laughed out, and every star
Could here be heard,
Such peals of golden laughter
We should not hear, as after
Such a word.

For all the storm saith, still,
Stout stands the daffodil:
For all we say,
Howe'er he look demurely,
Our martialist will surely
Have his way.

We may not bind with bands
Those large and liberal hands,
Nor stay from fight,
Nor hold them back from giving:
No lean mean laws of living
Bind a knight.

And always here of old
Such gentle hearts and bold
Our land has bred:
How durst her eye rest else on
The glory shed from Nelson
Quick and dead?

Shame were it, if but one
Such once were born her son,
That one to have borne,
And brought him ne'er a brother:
His praise should bring his mother
Shame and scorn.

A child high-souled as he
Whose manhood shook the sea
Smiles haply here:
His face, where love lies baslcing,
With bright shut mouth seems asking,
What is fear?

The sunshine-coloured fists
Beyond his dimpling wrists
Were never closed
For saving or for sparing--
For only deeds of daring
Predisposed.

Unclenched, the gracious hands
Let slip their gifts like sands
Made rich with ore
That tongues of beggars ravish
From small stout hands so lavish
Of their store.

Sweet hardy kindly hands
Like these were his that stands
With heel on gorge
Seen trampling down the dragon
On sign or flask or flagon,
Sweet Saint George.

Some tournament, perchance,
Of hands that couch no lance,
Might mark this spot
Your lists, if here some pleasant
Small Guenevere were present,
Launcelot.

My brave bright flower, you need
No foolish song, nor heed
It more than spring
The sighs of winter stricken
Dead when your haunts requicken
Here, my king.

Yet O, how hardly may
The wheels of singing stay
That whirl along
Bright paths whence echo raises
The phantom of your praises,
Child, my song!

Beyond all other things
That give my words fleet wings,
Fleet wings and strong,
You set their jesses ringing
Till hardly can I, singing,
Stint my song.

But all things better, friend,
And worse must find an end:
And, right or wrong,
'Tis time, lest rhyme should baffle,
I doubt, to put a snaffle
On my song.

And never may your ear
Aught harsher hear or fear,
Nor wolfish night
Nor dog-toothed winter snarling
Behind your steps, my darling,
My delight!

For all the gifts you give
Me, dear, each day you live,
Of thanks above
All thanks that could be spoken
Take not my song in token,
Take my love. 

if you take away
a child's books, 
you take away his spirit's
ability to dream! 
if you close his mind, 
you close the door
to his future




We were so still, Eskimo-footed arctic marksmen in the muffling silence of the eternal snows - eternal, ever since Wednesday - that we never heard Mrs. Prothero's first cry from her igloo at the bottom of the garden. Or, if we heard it at all, it was, to us, like the far-off challenge of our enemy and prey, the neighbor's polar cat. But soon the voice grew louder.
"Fire!" cried Mrs. Prothero, and she beat the dinner-gong.

And we ran down the garden, with the snowballs in our arms, toward the house; and smoke, indeed, was pouring out of the dining-room, and the gong was bombilating, and Mrs. Prothero was announcing ruin like a town crier in Pompeii. This was better than all the cats in Wales standing on the wall in a row. We bounded into the house, laden with snowballs, and stopped at the open door of the smoke-filled room.


"Call the fire brigade," cried Mrs. Prothero as she beat the gong.

"
There was no fire to be seen, only clouds of smoke and Mr. Prothero standing in the middle of them, waving his slipper as though he were conducting.
"Do something," he said. And we threw all our snowballs into the smoke - I think we missed Mr. Prothero - and ran out of the house to the telephone box.
"Let's call the police as well," Jim said. "And the ambulance

" "And Ernie Jenkins, he likes fires



Years and years ago, when I was a boy, when there were wolves in Wales, and birds the color of red-flannel petticoats whisked past the harp-shaped hills, when we sang and wallowed all night and day in caves that smelt like Sunday afternoons in damp front farmhouse parlors, and we chased, with the jawbones of deacons, the English and the bears, before the motor car, before the wheel, before the duchess-faced horse, when we rode the daft and happy hills bareback, it snowed and it snowed. But here a small boy says: "It snowed last year, too. I made a snowman and my brother knocked it down and I knocked my brother down and then we had tea




"Were there postmen then, too?"
"With sprinkling eyes and wind-cherried noses, on spread, frozen feet they crunched up to the doors and mittened on them manfully. But all that the children could hear was a ringing of bells

"
"You mean that the postman went rat-a-tat-tat and the doors rang?"
"I mean that the bells the children could hear were inside them

"
"I only hear thunder sometimes, never bells

"
"There were church bells, too

"
"Inside them?"


"Get back to the postmen"

"
"Ours has got a black knocker. 

"
"And then they stood on the white Welcome mat in the little, drifted porches and huffed and puffed, making ghosts with their breath, and jogged from foot to foot like small boys wanting to go out

"
"And then the presents?"


"Get back to the Presents

"
"There were the Useful Presents: engulfing mufflers of the old coach days, and mittens made for giant sloths; zebra scarfs of a substance like silky gum that could be tug-o'-warred down to the galoshes; blinding tam-o'-shanters like patchwork tea cozies and bunny-suited busbies and balaclavas for victims of head-shrinking tribes; from aunts who always wore wool next to the skin there were mustached and rasping vests that made you wonder why the aunts had any skin left at all; and once I had a little crocheted nose bag from an aunt now, alas, no longer whinnying with us. And pictureless books in which small boys, though warned with quotations not to, would skate on Farmer Giles' pond and did and drowned; and books that told me everything about the wasp, except why


"Go on the Useless Presents

"
"Bags of moist and many-colored jelly babies and a folded flag and a false nose and a tram-conductor's cap and a machine that punched tickets and rang a bell; never a catapult; once, by mistake that no one could explain, a little hatchet; and a celluloid duck that made, when you pressed it, a most unducklike sound, a mewing moo that an ambitious cat might make who wished to be a cow; and a painting book in which I could make the grass, the trees, the sea and the animals any colour I pleased, and still the dazzling sky-blue sheep are grazing in the red field under the rainbow-billed and pea-green birds. Hardboileds, toffee, fudge and allsorts, crunches, cracknels, humbugs, glaciers, marzipan, and butterwelsh for the Welsh. And troops of bright tin soldiers who, if they could not fight, could always run. And Snakes-and-Families and Happy Ladders. And Easy Hobbi-Games for Little Engineers, complete with instructions. Oh, easy for Leonardo! And a whistle to make the dogs bark to wake up the old man next door to make him beat on the wall with his stick to shake our picture off the wall. And a packet of cigarettes: you put one in your mouth and you stood at the corner of the street and you waited for hours, in vain, for an old lady to scold you for smoking a cigarette, and then with a smirk you ate it. And then it was breakfast under the balloons


"Were there Uncles like in our house?"




Or I would go out, my bright new boots squeaking, into the white world, on to the seaward hill, to call on Jim and Dan and Jack and to pad through the still streets, leaving huge footprints on the hidden pavements.
"I bet people will think there's been hippos

"
"What would you do if you saw a hippo coming down our street?"
"I'd go like this, bang! I'd throw him over the railings and roll him down the hill and then I'd tickle him under the ear and he'd wag his tail

"
"What would you do if you saw two hippos?"

Iron-flanked and bellowing he-hippos clanked and battered through the scudding snow toward us as we passed Mr. Daniel's house.
"Let's post Mr. Daniel a snow-ball through his letter box

"
"Let's write things in the snow

"
"Let's write, 'Mr. Daniel looks like a spaniel' all over his lawn

"
Or we walked on the white shore. "Can the fishes see it's snowing?"

The silent one-clouded heavens drifted on to the sea. Now we were snow-blind travelers lost on the north hills, and vast dewlapped dogs, with flasks round their necks, ambled and shambled up to us, baying "Excelsior

" We returned home through the poor streets where only a few children fumbled with bare red fingers in the wheel-rutted snow and cat-called after us, their voices fading away, as we trudged uphill, into the cries of the dock birds and the hooting of ships out in the whirling bay. And then, at tea the recovered Uncles would be jolly; and the ice cake loomed in the center of the table like a marble grave. Auntie Hannah laced her tea with rum, because it was only once a year.

Bring out the tall tales now that we told by the fire as the gaslight bubbled like a diver. Ghosts whooed like owls in the long nights when I dared not look over my shoulder; animals lurked in the cubbyhole under the stairs and the gas meter ticked. And I remember that we went singing carols once, when there wasn't the shaving of a moon to light the flying streets. At the end of a long road was a drive that led to a large house, and we stumbled up the darkness of the drive that night, each one of us afraid, each one holding a stone in his hand in case, and all of us too brave to say a word. The wind through the trees made noises as of old and unpleasant and maybe webfooted men wheezing in caves. We reached the black bulk of the house. "What shall we give them? Hark the Herald?"
"No," Jack said, "Good King Wencelas. I'll count three

" One, two three, and we began to sing, our voices high and seemingly distant in the snow-felted darkness round the house that was occupied by nobody we knew. We stood close together, near the dark door. Good King Wencelas looked out On the Feast of Stephen
And then a small, dry voice, like the voice of someone who has not spoken for a long time, joined our singing: a small, dry, eggshell voice from the other side of the door: a small dry voice through the keyhole. And when we stopped running we were outside our house; the front room was lovely; balloons floated under the hot-water-bottle-gulping gas; everything was good again and shone over the town.
"Perhaps it was a ghost," Jim said. 
"Perhaps it was trolls," Dan said, who was always reading.
"Let's go in and see if there's any jelly left," Jack said. And we did that.


" It was very warm in the little house. Auntie Hannah, who had got on to the parsnip wine, sang a song about Bleeding Hearts and Death, and then another in which she said her heart was like a Bird's Nest; and then everybody laughed again; and then I went to bed. Looking through my bedroom window, out into the moonlight and the unending smoke-colored snow, I could see the lights in the windows of all the other houses on our hill and hear the music rising from them up the long, steady falling night. I turned the gas down, I got into bed. I said some words to the close and holy darkness, and then I slept

"Hush, hush! Speak softly, Mother dear, 
So that the daisies may not hear; 
For when the stars begin to peep, 
The pretty daisies go to sleep. 

"See, Mother, round us on the lawn, 
With soft white lashes closely drawn, 
They've shut their eyes so golden-gay, 
That looked up through the long, long day. 

"But now they're tired of all the fun-- 
Of bees and birds, of wind and sun 
Playing their game at hide-and-seek;-- 
Then very softly let us speak
 


A myriad stars above the child 
Looked down from heaven and sweetly smiled; 
But not a star in all the skies 
Beamed on him with his Mother's eyes. 

She stroked his curly chestnut head, 
And whispering very softly, said, 
"I'd quite forgotten they might hear; 
Thank you for that reminder, dear. 

R. L. Stevenson


Now there is nothing wrong with me
Except -- I think it's called T. 

B.
And that is why I have to lay
Out in the garden all the day.

Our garden is not very wide
And cars go by on either side,
And make an angry-hooty noise
That rather startles little boys.

But worst of all is when they take
Me out in cars that growl and shake,
With charabancs so dreadful-near
I have to shut my eyes for fear.

But when I'm on my back again,
I watch the Croydon aeroplane
That flies across to France, and sings
Like hitting thick piano-strings.

When I am strong enough to do
The things I'm truly wishful to,
I'll never use a car or train
But always have an aeroplane;

And just go zooming round and round,
And frighten Nursey with the sound,
And see the angel-side of clouds,
And spit on all those motor-crowds

For the long nights you lay awake
And watched for my unworthy sake:
For your most comfortable hand
That led me through the uneven land:
For all the story-books you read:
For all the pains you comforted:

For all you pitied, all you bore,
In sad and happy days of yore:- 
My second Mother, my first Wife,
The angel of my infant life- 
From the sick child, now well and old,
Take, nurse, the little book you hold!

And grant it, Heaven, that all who read
May find as dear a nurse at need,
And every child who lists my rhyme,
In the bright, fireside, nursery clime,
May hear it in as kind a voice
As made my childish days rejoice

HERE a little child I stand 
Heaving up my either hand; 
Cold as paddocks though they be, 
Here I lift them up to Thee, 
For a benison to fall 
On our meat and on us all. Amen. 

ALL the bells of heaven may ring,
All the birds of heaven may sing,
All the wells on earth may spring,
All the winds on earth may bring
      All sweet sounds together---
Sweeter far than all things heard,
Hand of harper, tone of bird,
Sound of woods at sundawn stirred,
Welling water's winsome word,
      Wind in warm wan weather,

One thing yet there is, that none
Hearing ere its chime be done
Knows not well the sweetest one
Heard of man beneath the sun,
      Hoped in heaven hereafter;
Soft and strong and loud and light,
Very sound of very light
Heard from morning's rosiest height,
When the soul of all delight
      Fills a child's clear laughter.

Golden bells of welcome rolled
Never forth such notes, nor told
Hours so blithe in tones so bold,
As the radiant mouth of gold
      Here that rings forth heaven.
If the golden-crested wren
Were a nightingale---why, then,
Something seen and heard of men
Might be half as sweet as when
      Laughs a child of seven. 

One of a kind this cheerful sound
A child's laughter wherever it's found
From the giggling of a baby in a playpen
To the laughter of a toddler again and again

A child's laughter can bring a smile
To one who hasn't done so in such a long while
I know because that one was me
Until my daughter's laugh set mine free

A child's laughter so gleeful and pure
An innocence adults miss for sure
Laughter that can bring back the past
And memories of a youth that flew by so fast

A child's laughter can bring out the best
Of most any man when he's depressed
Cause his spirit that's fallen to soar
Until at last he laughs once more


Today I found a can of paint.
The paintbrush was there, too.
Mommy must have left it
when her painting was all through.

It was such a pretty color, 
I learned you call it 'red'.
It made me think of pretty things
that same color in my head.

I painted rainbows from the sky, 
and hearts, and bows for hair.
When Mommy saw it, she got mad
and sat me in a chair.

She told me I was naughty
and to think of what I’d done.
While I thought, she scrubbed and scrubbed
and cleaned off all my fun.

I’ll never understand my mom, 
why she laughed when we were through. 
I only said I wished 
the pretty color had been blue. 

The world is wide with wonder
For everything is new
A child’s mind is like a sponge
Or like a flower sipping morning dew

I love to watch them question
Every single thing
You never know what is next
And what each day will bring

Perhaps we too should open
Our minds deliciously
And see the world as a child does
How exciting life would be

Every heart here is a mom and a child, 
Nowhere has it gone, except to give and love, 
Never has it failed to collect those star dusts, 
To garnish the colorful and rustic experiences, 
The heart has the fine tuner to which, 
The inaudible are the blasting and intuitive, 
Always awake and never close its lids of eyes, 
For it loves those who have mothered and, 
Also it, itself a mother, who only knows to care, 
Nonstop questions of have you eaten or not, 
Are you alright or not? Simply call you darling, 
Irresistible enquiries even after nipped many times, 
Whether your finance is fine or not, 
Is your spouse kind to you, not like its spouse? 
A Very generous heart that is willing to part, 
What little money it has, to fold and squeeze, 
In the hands of its loved one who are in need, 
Even when it is on the sick bed recuperating, 
When I called its name for assurance, 
It asked me back in the motherly voice, 
What I needed as if it is in the kitchen, 
a mother’s heart has never gone cold, 
Always warm, the memories bring the smile.




Darling and sweet Amma


Through long nursery nights he stood
By my bed unwearying,
Loomed gigantic, formless, queer,
Purring in my haunted ear
That same hideous nightmare thing,
Talking, as he lapped my blood,
In a voice cruel and flat,
Saying for ever, "Cat!
Cat!
Cat!..


That one word was all he said,
That one word through all my sleep,
In monotonous mock despair.
Nonsense may be light as air,
But there's Nonsense that can keep
Horror bristling round the head,
When a voice cruel and flat
Says for ever, "Cat!
Cat!
Cat!..


He had faded, he was gone
Years ago with Nursery Land,
When he leapt on me again
From the clank of a night train,
Overpowered me foot and head,
Lapped my blood, while on and on
The old voice cruel and flat
Says for ever, "Cat!
Cat!
Cat!..


Morphia drowsed, again I lay
In a crater by High Wood:
He was there with straddling legs,
Staring eyes as big as eggs,
Purring as he lapped my blood,
His black bulk darkening the day,
With a voice cruel and flat,
"Cat!
Cat!
Cat!
Cat!..

" he said, "Cat!
Cat!..


When I'm shot through heart and head,
And there's no choice but to die,
The last word I'll hear, no doubt,
Won't be "Charge!" or "Bomb them out!"
Nor the stretcher-bearer's cry,
"Let that body be, he's dead!"
But a voice cruel and flat
Saying for ever, "Cat!
Cat!
Cat!"For Morn, my dome of blue, 
For Meadows, green and gay, 
And Birds who love the twilight of the leaves, 

For the big Bees that hum
And hide in bells of flowers; 
For the winding roads that come 
To Evening’s holy door, 
And guard my innocence for evermore. 

Made  homeless  from  home 
Bombed  city  where  though all  
 Extend  arms,  find it  harder 
To hold  peace  than  explosives
In  a  napalmed  land   
As  home bred exile  I    learn  
To  grow  under    a  chemical  sky

Dripping  with  nuclear fall outs
 Flowing  to  other  poison
Poured  daily  on   earth  and  mind -
Today  planet  earth, tomorrow  the stars. 
How  sad   man  who dreams of a home  
In  hereafter, can't share their warmth
To    each   other's heart, here  and  now.. 

the coin falls
dropped in the well
bouncing off walls
deep to hell

a muffled plumpf

is all to tell


A CHILD'S smile--nothing more; 
Quiet, and soft, and grave, and seldom seen; 
Like summer lightning o'er, 
Leaving the little face again serene. 

I think, boy well-beloved, 
Thine angel, who did grieve to see how far 
Thy childhood is removed 
From sports that dear to other children are, 

On this pale cheek has thrown 
The brightness of his countenance, and made 
A beauty like his own-- 
That, while we see it, we are half afraid, 

And marvel, will it stay? 
Or, long ere manhood, will that angel fair, 
Departing some sad day, 
Steal the child-smile and leave the shadow care? 

Nay, fear not. As is given 
Unto this child the father watching o'er, 
His angel up in heaven 
Beholds Our Father's face for evermore. 

And he will help him bear 
His burthen, as his father helps him now: 
So may he come to wear 
That happy child-smile on an old man's brow. 

Oh what fun when it snows
It’s a little boy’s delight
To tromp around in snow knee deep
His world so crystal and white

Cute as a button he is
Searching for places to explore
A special sparkly season
That a kid cannot ignore

A chilly newfound place it is
His mind goes simply wild
He puts himself into outer space
This precious little child

Don’t you wish we all
Could live in his creative world? 
Squash life’s daily problems
Like a snowball that was hurled

Let’s see things as a little child
When the New Year soon appears
Look forward with excitement
And with a child’s innocent cheer

O Maker of this universe! ! ! ! ! 
Sought in silence, prose and verse! 

On strings of these my humble lays

O Knower of all black and white
Pour on us Thy heaven's light

Thou knowst our deep folds and layers
Unto Thee I send my prayers

Bless the sick with healthy life
Help the ones who are in strife

Grow us strong to serve the nation
with progress, peace and education

Ignorance sweeps us with its might
Help us remove it by our light

Save us from all evils odd

Grace our minds with blessings Thine
We wish to stay forever Thine

The path is thorny and so broad

Our hands are seeking for Thy mercy
Bless us with


Thy boundless mercy

Bless my parents and my teachers
Friends and siblings, all Thy creatures! 

Ameen! ! 

Welcome to my world
Some say it's a simple place
Well that may be so
But at least, there's always a smile on my face

Welcome to my world
It's a world full of joy
It's a world full of love
The world to me now is just one big toy

If ever you're feeling low
If ever you have no place to go
I'll always welcome you to my world
That's something you should know

Welcome to my world
It's a world free of hate
It's a world free of wars
So please don't hesitate
To come and visit my world


A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with full
	hands;
How could I answer the child?


I do not know what it
	is any more than he.

I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful
	green stuff woven.

A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped,
Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we
	may see and remark, and say Whose?

Or I guess the grass is itself a child


the produced babe
	of the vegetation.

Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,
And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow
	zones,
Growing among black folks as among white,
Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the 
same, I receive them the same.

And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.

Tenderly will I use you curling grass,
It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,
It may be if I had known them I would have loved them;
It may be you are from old people and from women, and
	from offspring taken soon out of their mother's laps,
And here you are the mother's laps.

This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old
	mothers,
Darker than the colorless beards of old men,
Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.

O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues!
And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths
	for nothing.

I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men
	and women,
And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring
	taken soon out of their laps.

What do you think has become of the young and old men?
What do you think has become of the women and
	children?

They are alive and well somewhere;
The smallest sprouts show there is really no death,
And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait
	at the end to arrest it,
And ceased the moment life appeared.

All goes onward and outward


and nothing collapses,
And to die is different from what any one supposed, and
	luckier. 

Cultures are so in depth with their own religions

People brought up to believe that selling

Their daughters is OK.  

mutilation of their bodies is OK

Letting their daughters to be married to older men is OK

The reality of their world is beyond my comprehension

Why is this so.  

because it is our culture.  

as so many women have said so. . 

in their own words

This makes me so mad to see that children are married off at such an early age in there lives

When they should be

Running Free

Playing with friends their own age

Learning about life and the world through a child's eyes

Laughing.  

Living happy life's. . 

Just being a child

When I see this and how they live. . today in this day and age

I cry and weep as a mother. . how can this be

Children should be Just that.  

children

Not a commodity to be bargained with it shouldn't be this way

Its just not right. . 

tears trickle down my face as I see so many

Not given a chance to be who they want to be

At least I was able to do so.  

move forward and on

They cannot which is why I cry for the children of our timeshow can a parent have a child
and show no love
give not a care of that child
how can they do that 
and take no blame 
when that child falls apart or fails 
so much is unknown for this child
love 
caring 
happiness
all that a parent is suppose to teach 
went untaught
this child left in a world
only herself to rely on 
and yet she choose to take care of everyone else
putting herself last until it was too late
now she is drowning in pain
and no one is there to dig her out
or give her just one helping hand
all those around
that she has helped
just walk by
and you know why
cause she looks perfectly fine to them 
she is traped behind a mask
to the world she looks like a happy child
happy is but the opposite to how she feels[NOTE: THIS POEM IS NOT TO BE USED ANYWHERE WITHOUT MY CONCENT. PLEASE USE THE LINKS IN MY BIOGRAPHY OR MESSAGES ON THIS SITE TO CONTACT ME. THANKS.]


I can't remember, 
Skipping rocks on the pond, 
My childhoods forgotten, 
My Childhoods lost, 

Going to the lake, 
Sitting on the beach, 
Playing with friends, 
or dancing in the streets, 

I can't remember, 
The crash in the fog, 
My childhood was forgotten, 
My childhood was lost, 

The doctor doing surgery, 
Me getting pills, 
I can't remember any of it, 
None of it's clear, 

I still can't remember, 
How it is gone, 
My childhood forgotten, 
My childhood's lost! 

Well I'm gonna end it right now, 
I gonna kill myself off, 
A childhood Forgotten, 
A childhood lost


Hear someone giggle, 
Peer out, there is no one.  puzzled; 
am here smiled drizzle. 

An urgency to protect those young, 
Only comes when convenience begins.
And the ones not so young, 
Are quick to do that with that done.

Children adapt with a growing up fast.
And understand to comprehend, 
Who protects them to defend.
And who uses them to pretend.

Yet unfortunately too many are left, 
To defend themselves with no one else. 
There to provide guidance by those adults.
Adults experiencing a childhood kept to relive, 
As a result of keeping 'themselves' children. 

Some call it checkers, 
I call it draughts.
Don't play with me
If you think it's just a game
And you don't mind losing.
I play a mean game. I play to win.
Old Peter Salaveros taught me
When I was a boy.
We played on a scrubbed table
In the seamen's mess, 
Just him and me.
We played seriously.
Neither of us smiled. 

I remember those long hot Summer's, as if they were yesterday, 
When the sun shone down on our street, the place I loved to play.
For many a window glistened, cleaned well to a sparkling shine, 
Where starched white shirts blew gaily, on many a washing line.

I remember the sounds of the trains at night, as they passed on the track below, 
Way down, the steep embankment, where many wild ferns would grow.
And many a door was left ajar, a life filled with Honesty and Trust, 
When everyone toiled and struggled, to bring home a well earned crust.

I remember the old wheels turning, at the colliery across the way, 
And I still see the old Miners faces, as they finished their shift for the day.
Their eyes still black from the coal dust, they'd make their way home from the pit, 
Eager to rest their weary legs, but still full of banter and wit! 

I remember the loveable character, who lived just across the street, 
He'd sit outside his window, and shout from his favourite seat.
With his belly full of beer, he'd be heard on a Saturday night, 
Then wake the whole street with a song and a dance! He looked such a comical sight! 

I walked the lovely hillside, so often with my Dad, 
And so enjoyed the tales he told, of when he was a lad.
These were the best years of our lives, in a very special way, 
I'll never forget those Summer's, they seem like yesterday. 

The seeds of dreamtime dwell in the centre of a child's spirituality, 
Natural wisdom's mindful appreciation of the present moment
Presents to their logic, angels can sing and teddy bears can talk, 
Mummy will never leave and Pinocchio can walk,    
Pussycats won't scratch and doggy's tails are toys, 
Dolly's are for little girls and bats are for boys.
This dream of life in this state of heaven  
Will change their thinking when they are seven, 
Their little wonder brain absorbs knowledge so fast
With millions of nerve cells forming to last, 
Verbals torrent "What's this, what's that, why this, who's that", 
With a language learnt in no time flat.
They enter the zone of thinking, logic and learning at school, 
The march of time takes away the cuddly lovely little child, 
To behold teenagers, young invigorating meek and mild 
The core of their being formed with parental guidance and love.
With an inner kindness and respect soul stamped from above
The seeds of spirituality have grown thru their veins, 
Now the world is their oyster to take charge of the reigns. 

laying in bed looking up at the ceiling
my eyes got blurry, and my head started reeling.
i saw a vision start to take form
of a child who was unborn.

this child was in the womb of its mother
being fed by the tube to give it life.

he turned and looked straight at me
and its eyes were as big as can be.

he raised his small little hand
and signaled me to look inside.
it was something that he could not hide.

the vision came closer to me
just so that i could see.

i saw the pain that this child was in
because his mother was
thinking to abort
and for the last two months he had fought.

was thought by the mother
of becoming belated.

this young mother was under peer pressure
to take this childs life
and it did not matter if it was wrong or right.

this young child was screaming at me
'how could they let this be'
i am life given by the lord
why would she want to abort.

tell her to give me a chance 
so that i could live in the warmth
of her arms, and fill her heart with joy.
it would matter not, if i'm a girl or a boy.

can't she feel me, and see me 
in her dreams at night
and that i'm in a perilous fight.
i want to live just like she
there is nothing wrong with me.

the vision started to fade away
and in my heart, i  started to pray
let this child live another day
and from this woman the pain to go away.

LIFE IS SACRED, DON'T THROW IT AWAY
IF YOUR MOTHER THOUGHT LIKE YOU
YOU WOULD'NT BE HERE TODAY. 

I use to watch my boy
When he was just one
As he slept the night away
In a dreamlike slumber land

He use to gurgle and smile
In his cute little way
Always made me wonder
What do children dream of? 

Is it fluffy white clouds? 
That drifts in a summer morn

Or is it twinkle little star
In the moonlight beam

Do they play with their loved ones? 
In a candy land of dreams

Oh won't that be grand
Living life in candy land

Then he would just gurgle
His sweet little baby sound

Then softly I would tuck
In his cot so warm

And watch him once again
Drift off to never land

He is my insperation
He is my shining light

He was given to me in faith
So I cherish him for life


I remember when I was a child
I’d hear my parents argue
Because I was so very young
I didn’t know what to do

Sometimes I get so scared
I’d pray that I’d fall to sleep
Hoping that when I did awake
I wouldn’t hear a peep

I would lay there for a while
To listen to see what I could hear
No one ever had a clue
How much I was filled with fear

So it seemed that for now
It was quiet but then
I always knew just like before
That it could always start again





) 

Why do I feel this sadness deep inside
Is it mistakes that I try to hide? 
Like a drowning victim gasping for air
Your chest becomes tight and your hearts in despair.

Like a wind blown feather landing on the ground
You want to scream, but you don’t make a sound.
Hundreds of people all around
Yet this sadness gets you down.
You don’t know how or why you get this way
You just want to hide - or run away.

Some get sad for menial things
But this is what sadness brings.
So this thought I will inflict
" you have to get over it really quick".

Sadness can pull you down, especially
When there’s no help around.
TAKE YOUR LIPS AND SPREAD THEM WIDE
AND PULL OUT THAT LAUGHTER FROM DEEP INSIDE.

Did you feel the difference that it brought
This is what I was taught.

             SMILE!                : -)Memories of my childhood
I know will last forever
Long ago childhood memories
Through my mind often pass

I remember snow covered mornings
With the wind howling through the streets
I remember wearing winter clothes
So my friends I could go meet

I remember the bone chilling cold
Like it was only yesterday
I remember always saying
I have to leave this place one day

I remember learning as I grew older
It wasn't measured in gifts received
Or how much money was spent

I learned it was better to give then receive
I learned, that not all people could give
But if you opened your heart and home

Lend a helping hand to those in need
Especially the needs of a child
Nothing beats the look you'll receive
From a child with a big bright smile








HWhat can lambkins do
All the keen night through?
Nestle by their woolly mother
The careful ewe.


What can nestlings do
In the nightly dew?
Sleep beneath their mother's wing
Till day breaks anew.


If in a field or tree
There might only be 
Such a warm soft sleeping-place
Found for me

a chill in the air, 
drinking coffee, and listening
for the groan

of leaves beginning to turn.
and the sight of your eyes
undressing you heart

in the simplest moment. 
the wrinkled smile, talking
softly about nothing

and giving it meaning.
some things just are. 
and destiny is a small wind

that blows the falling leaf
into the almost sound
of laughter on your lips. 

a chill in the air. 
we build a small fire
with the hands of companions, 

and lovers. 

I rose at the dead of night 
And went to the lattice alone 
To look for my Mother's ghost 
Where the ghostly moonlight shone. 

My friends had failed one by one, 
Middleaged, young, and old, 
Till the ghosts were warmer to me 
Than my friends that had grown cold. 

I looked and I saw the ghosts 
Dotting plain and mound: 
They stood in the blank moonlight 
But no shadow lay on the ground; 
They spoke without a voice 
And they leapt without a sound. 

I called: ' O my Mother dear, ' — 
I sobbed: ' O my Mother kind, 
Make a lonely bed for me 
And shelter it from the wind: 

' Tell the others not to come 
To see me night or day; 
But I need not tell my friends 
To be sure to keep away. ' 

My Mother raised her eyes, 
They were blank and could not see; 
Yet they held me with their stare 
While they seemed to look at me. 

She opened her mouth and spoke, 
I could not hear a word 
While my flesh crept on my bones 
And every hair was stirred. 

She knew that I could not hear 
The message that she told 
Whether I had long to wait 
Or soon should sleep in the mould: 
I saw her toss her shadowless hair 
And wring her hands in the cold. 

I strained to catch her words 
And she strained to make me hear, 
But never a sound of words 
Fell on my straining ear. 

From midnight to the cockcrow 
I kept my watch in pain 
While the subtle ghosts grew subtler 
In the sad night on the wane. 

From midnight to the cockcrow 
I watched till all were gone, 
Some to sleep in the shifting sea 
And some under turf and stone: 
Living had failed and dead had failed 
And I was indeed alone. 

A chilly Peace infests the Grass
The Sun respectful lies - 
Not any Trance of industry
These shadows scrutinize - 

Whose Allies go no more astray
For service or for Glee - 
But all mankind deliver here
From whatsoever sea -They please me not-- these solemn songs 
That hint of sermons covered up. 
'T is true the world should heed its wrongs, 
But in a poem let me sup, 
Not simples brewed to cure or ease 
Humanity's confessed disease, 
But the spirit-wine of a singing line, 
Or a dew-drop in a honey cup

Ash is a quiet tree, light and leafy
It soothes and mildly shades, easing 
With a grace, with a favour quickly won, 
Tasting of clouds and a milky sun. 
The day is blond with its cheer
All that is tranquil and fun gathers near
Under its ringlets, free-flowing, fair.

Under its scattered coins 
Without fuss, without noise
Tight knots and screws may be undone
Racks loosened, heat plunged in
Wetness. Time sweetly, gently runs.  

But there are darker woods, with foliage
That surges sable like night over day
And stirs with its eloquence, with a
Mane of menace and fluency
All that is deep at the core
Of things, all that is beyond.
All that is not rest, all that reaches for more.
Those shadowy tresses catch and curl in their waves, 
A riot of  tenderness, rapt in a phrase
That has nothing to do with desire-
A thousand tales, a world where everything
And nothing is sure.


When you are called from the forest, 
To go where no trees throng the earth-
Now tell true: which of these would you choose
To sing its song in your tired mind? In that
Inescapable dearth, which tree
Of memory would best tell again 
Of the worth of what had been? 
Which of the two, judge by the pain
(Welcome the rawness, 
Nurture the bruise)    
Would have been hardest to lose

I shall be telling this without regret.
Somewhere, somehow, during my earthly time 
I met several damsels, some ordinary, some sublime.
I have chosen to love the one with a soul deepest
And since then, I have not known any rest. 

Earth's Redeemer, to save us from all danger,
And, as the Holy Record tells, born in a manger.

Chorus --

Till your sweet music o'er the kingdom swells,
To warn the people to respect the morn

And the Virgin Mary His mother felt very forlorn
As she lay in a horse's stall at a roadside inn,

Oh! think of the Virgin Mary as she lay
In a lowly stable on a bed of hay,

Is not by drinking whisky or wine,

Whom He sent into the world to save sinners from hell
And by believing in Him in heaven we'll dwell;
Who can save us from hell, death, and scorn.

Then he warned, and respect the Saviour dear,
And treat with less respect the New Year,
And respect always the blessed morn

As well as the morn of the New Year,

Therefore, good people, be warned in time,
Who sent His Son to save us from hell and scorn.

There the heavenly babe He lay
In a stall among a lot of hay,
While the Angel Host by Bethlehem
Sang a beautiful and heavenly anthem.

Much more so than the New Year,

And let the rich be kind to the poor,
And think of the hardships they do endure,
Who are neither clothed nor fed,
And Many without a blanket to their bed. 


The dawn rose red o'er Bethlehem, the stars shone through the gray, 

Along the hills of Galilee the white flocks sleeping lay, 

Now all your sorrows He doth heal, your sins He takes away; 

I went sighing past the church across the moorland dreary-
'Oh! never sin and want and woe this earth will leave,
And the bells but mock the wailing round, they sing so cheery.
Still in cellar, and in garret, and on moorland dreary
The orphans moan, and widows weep, and poor men toil in vain,

Then arose a joyous clamour from the wild-fowl on the mere,
Beneath the stars, across the snow, like clear bells ringing,
Though thou be dumb, yet o'er their work the stars and snows are singing.
Blind! I live, I love, I reign; and all the nations through
With the thunder of my judgments even now are ringing.
Do thou fulfil thy work but as yon wild-fowl do,
Thou wilt heed no less the wailing, yet hear through it angels singing.'


Eversley,  

His hair was like a light.
(O weary, weary were the world,
But here is all aright.)

His hair was like a star.
(O stern and cunning are the kings,
But here the true hearts are.) 

His hair was like a fire.
(O weary, weary is the world,
But here the world's desire.)

His hair was like a crown,
And all the flowers looked up at Him,
And all the stars looked down 



I 

The shepherds went their hasty way,
And found the lowly stable-shed
Where the Virgin-Mother lay:
And now they checked their eager tread,
For to the Babe, that at her bosom clung,
A Mother's song the Virgin-Mother sung.

II 

They told her how a glorious light,
Streaming from a heavenly throng.
Around them shone, suspending night!
While sweeter than a mother's song,
Blest Angels heralded the Savior's birth,

III

She listened to the tale divine,
And closer still the Babe she pressed:
And while she cried, the Babe is mine!
The milk rushed faster to her breast:
Joy rose within her, like a summer's morn;
Peace, Peace on Earth! the Prince of Peace is born.

IV

Thou Mother of the Prince of Peace,
Poor, simple, and of low estate!
That strife should vanish, battle cease,
O why should this thy soul elate? 
Sweet Music's loudest note, the Poet's story,
Didst thou ne'er love to hear of fame and glory?

V

And is not War a youthful king,
A stately Hero clad in mail?
Beneath his footsteps laurels spring;
Him Earth's majestic monarchs hail
Their friends, their playmate! and his bold bright eye
Compels the maiden's love-confessing sigh.

VI

Tell this in some more courtly scene,
To maids and youths in robes of state!
I am a woman poor and mean,
And wherefore is my soul elate.
War is a ruffian, all with guilt defiled,
That from the aged father's tears his child!

VII

A murderous fiend, by fiends adored,
He kills the sire and starves the son;
The husband kills, and from her board
Steals all his widow's toil had won;
All safety from the night, all comfort from the day.

VIII

Then wisely is my soul elate,
That strife should vanish, battle cease:
I'm poor and of low estate, 
The Mother of the Prince of Peace.
Joy rises in me, like a summer's morn:
Peace, Peace on Earth! The Prince of Peace is born

FOR THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL CHILDREN OF THE CHURCH OF THE DISCIPLES

'What means this glory round our feet,'
  The Magi mused, 'more bright than morn?'
And voices chanted clear and sweet,
  'To-day the Prince of Peace is born!'

'What means that star,' the Shepherds said,
  'That brightens through the rocky glen?'
And angels, answering overhead,
  Sang, 'Peace on earth, good-will to men!'

'Tis eighteen hundred years and more
  Since those sweet oracles were dumb;
We wait for Him, like them of yore;
  Alas, He seems so slow to come!

But it was said, in words of gold
  No time or sorrow e'er shall dim,
That little children might be bold
  In perfect trust to come to Him.

All round about our feet shall shine
  A light like that the wise men saw,
If we our loving wills incline
  To that sweet Life which is the Law.

So shall we learn to understand
  The simple faith of shepherds then,
And, clasping kindly hand in hand,
  Sing, 'Peace on earth, good-will to men!'

And they who do their souls no wrong,
  But keep at eve the faith of morn,
Shall daily hear the angel-song,
  'To-day the Prince of Peace is born!

In the bleak mid-winter 
Frosty wind made moan, 
Earth stood hard as iron, 
Water like a stone; 
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, 
Snow on snow, 
In the bleak mid-winter 
Long ago. 


Nor earth sustain; 
Heaven and earth shall flee away 
When He comes to reign: 
In the bleak mid-winter 
A stable-place sufficed 


Enough for Him whom cherubim 
Worship night and day, 
A breastful of milk 
And a mangerful of hay; 
Enough for Him whom angels 
Fall down before, 
The ox and ass and camel 
Which adore. 


Angels and archangels 
May have gathered there. 
Cherubim and seraphim 
Thronged the air, 
But only His mother 
In her maiden bliss 
Worshipped the Beloved 
With a kiss. 


What can I give Him, 
Poor as I am? 
If I were a shepherd 
I would bring a lamb, 
If I were a wise man 
I would do my part, - 
Yet what I can I give Him, 
Give my heart


As the combs went in her hair.
Mary that is of might,
Bring us to thy Son’s sight.

They held the gold combs out from her,
A span’s length off her head;
And of her bearing-bed.
Mary most full of grace,
Bring us to thy Son’s face.

When she sat at Joseph’s hand,
She looked against her side;
And either way from the short silk band
Her girdle was all wried.
Mary that all good may,
Bring us to thy Son’s way.

Mary had three women for her bed,
The twain were maidens clean;
The first of them had white and red,
The third had riven green.
Mary that is so sweet,
Bring us to thy Son’s feet.

She had three women for her hair,
Two were gloved soft and shod;
The third had feet and fingers bare,
Mary that wieldeth land,
Bring us to thy Son’s hand.

She had three women for her ease,
The twain were good women:
The first two were the two Maries,
The third was Magdalen.
Mary that perfect is,
Bring us to thy Son’s kiss.

Joseph had three workmen in his stall,
To serve him well upon;
The first of them were Peter and Paul,
The third of them was John.
Bring us to thy Son’s ken.

"If your child be none other man’s,
But if it be very mine,
The bedstead shall be gold two spans,
The bedfoot silver fine."
Bring us to thy Son’s birth.

"If the child be some other man’s,
And if it be none of mine,
The manger shall be straw two spans,
Betwixen kine and kine."
Mary that made sin cease,
Bring us to thy Son’s peace.

It fell on such a night,
Neither with sounds of psalteries,
Nor with fire for light.
Bring us to thy Son’s house.

The star came out upon the east
With a great sound and sweet:
Kings gave gold to make him feast
And myrrh for him to eat.
Mary, of thy sweet mood,
Bring us to thy Son’s good.

He had two handmaids at his head,
One handmaid at his feet;
The twain of them were fair and red,
The third one was right sweet.
Mary that is most wise,
Bring us to thy Son’s eyes. Amen. 

Chorus.

What sweeter music can we bring, 
Than a Carol, for to sing 
The Birth of this our heavenly King? 
Awake the Voice! Awake the String! 
Heart, Ear, and Eye, and every thing 
Awake! the while the active Finger 
Runs division with the Singer.

From the Flourish they came to the Song.

Voice 
Dark and dull night, fly hence away, 
And give the honor to this Day, 
That sees December turn'd to May.

Voice 
If we may ask the reason, say: 
The why, and wherefore all things here 
Seem like the Spring-time fo the year?

Voice 
Why does the chilling Winter's morn 
Smile, like a field beset with corn? 
Or smell, like to a mead new-shorn, 
Thus, on the sudden?

Voice 
Come and see 
The cause, why things thus fragrant be: 
'Tis He is born, whose quick'ning Birth 
Gives life and luster, public mirth, 
To Heaven and the under-Earth.

Chorus:
We see Him come, and know Him ours, 
Who, with His Sun-shine, and His Showers, 
Turns all the patient ground to flowers.

Voice 
The Darling of the World is come, 
And fit it is, we find a room 
To welcome Him.

Voice 
The nobler part 
Of all the house here, is the Heart,

Chorus:
Which we will give Him; and bequeath 
This Holly and this Ivy Wreath, 
To do Him honor; who's our King, 

One side of the potato-pits was white with frost -
How wonderful that was, how wonderful!
And when we put our ears to the paling-post
The music that came out was magical.

The light between the ricks of hay and straw
Was a hole in Heaven's gable. An apple tree
With its December-glinting fruit we saw -
O you, Eve, were the world that tempted me.

To eat the knowledge that grew in clay
And death the germ within it! Now and then
I can remember something of the gay
Garden that was childhood's. Again.

The tracks of cattle to a drinking-place,
A green stone lying sideways in a ditch,
Or any common sight, the transfigured face
Of a beauty that the world did not touch.

My father played the melodion
Outside at our gate;
There were stars in the morning east
And they danced to his music.

Across the wild bogs his melodion called
To Lennons and Callans.
As I pulled on my trousers in a hurry
I knew some strange thing had happened.

Outside in the cow-house my mother
Made the music of milking;
The light of her stable-lamp was a star
And the frost of Bethlehem made it twinkle.

A water-hen screeched in the bog,
Mass-going feet
Crunched the wafer-ice on the pot-holes,
Somebody wistfully twisted the bellows wheel.

My child poet picked out the letters
On the grey stone,
The winking glitter of a frosty dawn.

Cassiopeia was over
Cassidy's hanging hill,
I looked and three whin bushes rode across
The horizon — the Three Wise Kings.

And old man passing said:
‘Can't he make it talk -
The melodion.' I hid in the doorway
And tightened the belt of my box-pleated coat.

I nicked six nicks on the door-post
With my penknife's big blade -
there was a little one for cutting tobacco.

My father played the melodion,
My mother milked the cows,
And I had a prayer like a white rose pinned
On the Virgin Mary's blouse..


Yet, the old man was dying.. Why..
How could that be? 

A believer, till then, since I had believed with all my might

At the stroke of midnight I told myself that
Anybody should be forbidden to die on

I kept repeating the same few words like a mantra
Until I fell asleep.
But the old man couldn't listen to me. He was dead.

When I got the news, I told myself that

Badly drawn by the naïve mind of a child.

Hope died with the old man..

South of the Line, inland from far Durban,
A mouldering soldier lies--your countryman.
Awry and doubled up are his gray bones,
And on the breeze his puzzled phantom moans
Nightly to clear Canopus:  "I would know
By whom and when the All-Earth-gladdening Law
Of Peace, brought in by that Man Crucified,
Was ruled to be inept, and set aside?

And what of logic or of truth appears
In tacking 'Anno Domini' to the years?
Near twenty-hundred livened thus have hied,
But tarries yet the Cause for which He died

"In presence of the multitude, 
I have shown barring no gift, 
For what hath I worth thy child.  

In glance of many gifts bestowen, 
Frankensence, Muir, Silver, Gold, 

In tater clothes I bow Mother Mary, 
And confess the birth of virgin son, 
Yet words fall short of glory be.

As thy man Joseph smiles upon, 
I surrender in humilitance unto my lack.

In moment chance hold thy hand, 
of the child that taketh my place, 
For this tiny babe shall wash me clean.

In this childs eyes my saving grace, 
In his fathers hand thy mercy proclaims.   


to the harbour to buy a tree and I remember the sea 
that slapped against the dock was apple green and foamy. 
Mother bought a tree, for next to nothing, since its top 
was broken and it looked like a rejected child that waited 
for a car to come pick it up and bring it to the orphanage 
 By putting the tree on top of the dinner table and a star 
and a bit of glitter it looked nice in a child’s eye. 

Mother was angry we didn’t know way, and went to bed.
and there was nothing under the tree. Mother got up told 
us to dress and we walked to my uncle’s house. At first he 
didn’t want to let her in, but when he saw us children he 
opened the door.  We had plenty to eat although my aunt 
had a sour mien. But happy we walked home and thought 

Meat is Meat (a christmas tale)  

Santa came running up the road his coat was open
exposing a hairy belly, arms full of parcels, asked 
me if I was a vet, because Rudolf had broken its leg.
telling children that Santa was their own uncle Ted) 
every child got an uncle Ted)  but was willing this once
to help him out. I called a Lapland friend, who has 
a herd of reindeer lives in a tent and is dressed for 
year long winters, he gave us a reindeer for free as 
he too was a sentimental fool and had eight children. 
Problem solved, but what about Rudolf? We sent him 
to an abattoir where he was humanly slaughtered, 
(humanly, means he was shot through its head when
eating  carrots)  as a reindeer is too cute to eat its flesh 
was sold as veal, which is meat of doe eyed calves. 

With dark green needled memories
Of childhood dreams and mysteries
Wrapped present-like in front of me.

I glimpse a past wherein i see
The child that then grew into me
Not forward fast but haltingly.

A time for being with family
A time that's gone so fleetingly
Yet lives for always deep in me.

When twelfth night comes whole hauntingly
One lingered look and then i see

With feelings now felt longingly
No corner in my house to see

No greater gift
Could come to me
Than just 
For once
For once 
To see
My own children
Just being happy. 

A plan that could not fail
Rather then indulgences
He went straight into retail
Positioned presents as a blessing
And to keep the whole thing green
Decided that we all should have
When he phoned Sears and K Mart
On his celestial phone
The response was overwhelming
And they changed their budgets when
He had explained the concept
To these quite commercial men
Who then took back their words
This concept is amazing
How do we start 
And when? 
Its not that easy mate
The condition of your entry 
Is that you should celebrate
The goodness thats amongst us
And not just profits seek
For while valued is the businessman
The world belongs unto the meek
At this point there was silence
I think a pin was dropped
So the businessmen decided

A chrysanthemum espied a marigold
and said:
'Why hurry! 
Stay a while.
The sunshine is still all colour.
You are in the dawn of youth; 
my childhood died a long ago.
Yours are the shavings of autumn; 
mine is only the incense of spring.

'A cicada shell;
it sang itself
    utterly away.

The wine they drink in Paradise 
They make in Haute Lorraine; 
To be a sign and signal rod 
Shall never thirst again. 

The wine they praise in Paradise 
They make in Ponterey, 
The purple wine of Paradise, 
But we have better at the price; 
It's wine they praise in Paradise, 
It's cider that they pray. 

The wine they want in Paradise 
They find in Plodder's End, 
The apple wine of Herford, 
Of Hafod Hill and Herford, 
Where woods went down to Herford, 
And there I had a friend. 

The soft feet of the blessed go 
In the soft western vales, 
The road of the silent saints accord, 
The road from heaven to Herford, 
Where the apple wood of Herford 
Goes all the way to Wales. 

A Cigarette 


Dawn, yes and the mist, what else do you 
expect on lake Martin early and summer? 
Swamp cypress dripping with Spanish moss.
I have stopped rowing, water swirling around
Oar blades, the silence is absolute I dare not
Inhale, a bird shrieks, the lake shudders 
An evil thought has entered Paradise, I hear
The faint noise of outboard motors, 
The moment of ethereal stillness has gone, 
I lit a cigarette inhale deeply, exhale and blow
Rings a pure delight into morning air. 

My cigarette is burning in the ashtray
I'm trying but I can't sleep
There are too many things on my mind
How do you do this to me
Another long drag on that cigarette
But all my nerves do is race
Now I'm searching all my memories
Just looking for your face
The cherry of this cigarette
Burns so bright as your eyes
'Marlboro' printed on that white paper
Reminds me of your well thought out lies
I take another drag that comes so close to the filter
The smoke drifts away like my dreams
This burning ember is staunched out in the ashtray
Like my hopes for you and me


As 'legal representative'
I read a missive not my own,
On new designs the senders give
For clothes, in tints as shown.

Here figure blouses, gowns for tea,
And presentation-trains of state,
Charming ball-dresses, millinery,
Warranted up to date.

And this gay-pictured, spring-time shout
Of Fashion, hails what lady proud?
Her who before last year was out
Was costumed in a shroud. 

A city plum is not a plum; 
A dumb-bell is no bell, though dumb; 
A party rat is not a rat; 
A sailor's cat is not a cat; 
A soldier's frog is not a frog; 
A captain's log is not a log. 

Unlovely city, to which few tourists come
With squinting cameras and alien hats;
Left under a cloud by those who love the sun
And can afford to marry – a cloud of bits
Of soot more myriad than gnats, a cloud
Of smoke and rain, an insubstantial threat
Whose colour is the pigment of long wrath,
I think of you, surprised to find my blood
Warmed by a wry desire, a kind of love.
I see the trams, like galleons at night,
Go rocking with their golden cargo down
The iron hills; then hearing that bold din
My other senses frolic at a fête
Of phantom guests – the smells of fish and chips,
Laborious smoke, stale beer and autumn gusts,
The whispering shadows and the winking hips,
The crack of frosty whips, brief summer"s dust.
And in that city through a forked November
Love, like a Catherine-wheel, delighted me
And when it sputtered out, hung charred and sombre,
The city flavoured my delicious misery.
And so I guess that any landscape"s beauty
Is fathered by associative joys
Held in a shared, historic memory,
For beauty is the shape of our desires.
My northern city, then, by many called
Ugly or worse, much like an aged nurse
Tender yet stern who taught one how to walk,
Is dear to me, and it will always have
A desolate enchantment that I"ll love.




After that hot gospeller has levelled all but the churched sky,
I wrote the tale by tallow of a city's death by fire;
Under a candle's eye, that smoked in tears, I
Wanted to tell, in more than wax, of faiths that were snapped like wire.
All day I walked abroad among the rubbled tales,
Shocked at each wall that stood on the street like a liar;
Loud was the bird-rocked sky, and all the clouds were bales
Torn open by looting, and white, in spite of the fire.
Should a man wax tears, when his wooden world fails?
In town, leaves were paper, but the hills were a flock of faiths;
To a boy who walked all day, each leaf was a green breath
Rebuilding a love I thought was dead as nails,
Blessing the death and the baptism by fire.I understand the boredom of the clerks
fatigue shifting like dunes within their eyes
a frightful nausea gumming up the works
that once was thought aggression in disguise.
Do you remember? then how lightly dead
seemed the moon when over factories
it languid slid like a barrage of lead
above the heart, the fierce inventories
of desire. Now women wander our dreams
carrying money and to our sleep's shame
our hands twitch not for swift blood-sunk triremes
nor languorous white horses nor ill fame,
  but clutch the groin that clouds a pallid sky
  where tow'rs are sinking in their common eye.

My ship is flung upon the gutter's wrist
and cries for help of storm to violate
that flesh your curiosity too late
has flushed. The stem your garter tongue would twist
has sunk upon the waveless bosom's mist,
thigh of the city, apparition, hate,
and the tower whose doves have, delicate,
fled into my blood where they are not kissed.

You have left me to the sewer's meanwhile,
and I have answered the sea's open wish
to love me as a bonfire's watchful hand
guards red the shore and guards the hairy strand,
our most elegant lascivious bile,
my ship sinking beneath the gutter's fish.

How can I then, my dearest winter lay,
disgorge the tasty worm that eats me up
falling onto the stem of a highway
whose ardent rainbow is the spoon's flat cup
and in the vilest of blue suited force
enamored of the heated needle's arm
finds the ministrant an own tongue's remorse
so near the blood and still so far from harm,
thus to be eaten up and gobbled down
volcanoes of speedometers, the strike
that heats the iris into flame and flow'rs
the panting chalice so a turning pike:
  you are not how the gods refused to die,
  and I am scarred forever neath the eye.

What are my eyes? if they must feed me, rank
with forgetting, in the jealous forest
of lustrous blows, so luminously blank
through smoke and in the light. All faint, at rest,
yet I am racing towards the fear that kills
them off, friends and lovers, hast'ning through tears
like alcohol high in the throat of hills
and hills of night, alluring! their black cheers
falling upon my ears like nails. And there
the bars grow thick with onanists and camps
and bivouacs of bears with clubs, are fair
with their blows, deal death beneath purple lamps
  and to me! I run! closer always move,
  crying my name in fields of dead I love.

I plunge deep within this frozen lake
whose mirrored fastnesses fill up my heart,
where tears drift from frivolity to art
all white and slobbering, and by mistake
are the sky. I'm no whale to cruise apart
in fields impassive of my stench, my sake,
my sign to crushing seas that fall like fake
pillars to crash! to sow as wake my heart

and don't be niggardly. The snow drifts low
and yet neglects to cover me, and I
dance just ahead to keep my heart in sight.
the face that flees you, hidden city, white
swan. There's no art to free me, blinded so. 

Lines on a civic holiday trip on the Grand Trunk,
to Toronto, August,  Address to Mr. Hodge,
conductor of Caledonian games at Ingersoll.

From Ingersoll, on Canadian Thames, 
We come to greet mine host of the St. James,
This being our town's civic holiday ; 
Yet we remember twenty-fourth of May,
For then at our Caledonian games 
He did loud proclaim the victors' names .
We came in part to contribute
To our town's mechanics' institute,
Who got up this grand excursion
Where each one has his own diversion.
Some did remain at Burlington Bay,
While we to Toronto did wend our way,
And came to see this presentation
To stalwart son of Scottish nation. 

I don't love a radical mischief, 
I love an innocent beautiful thief, 
who steals the hearts with rosy smiles, 
can turn old ones in naughty juveniles, 
one who swims like a pretty mermaid, 
lo my bills of love always prepaid, 
one who loves not only the humans, 
birds and beasts, animals and insects, 
with a lovely virus whole world infects, 
is never confined in a single belief, 
so much universal is the lovely thief, 
a lovely clad soul in the skin's salt, 
a poem of love and a work of art, 
one who hates, from my side ducked, 
anyone who loves is my beloved.
In a Claddagh Ring her heart described, 
Love, loyalty, friendship inscribed, 

(Claddagh Ring is an Irish ring. DECEMBER Birthstone Silver Claddagh Ring, inscribed with 'Love Loyalty Friendship')I can see your boarding house now, 
A spacious, two-storied bungalow
That overlooked the blue-water harbour.
Your rambling house had good prospects.

There were boarders, like me, coming and going: 
Some were short-term: some were long-term.
I had a bedroom with a view  upstairs: 
We dined and watched television downstairs.

It was a case of upstairs, downstairs.
You believed in me as a man, a student: 
You listened when I found study difficult, 
You insisted that I finish the course.

Thanks partly to you, I did graduate then, 
With a degree that opened doors in teaching; 
Doors that would otherwise have been closed.
But there was more to you than that. 

For you were a spiritualist, a medium: 
You were in touch with the other side.
You spoke of the light or dark aura I had.
An aura of happiness: an aura of dejection.

You advised me to trust the voice of intuition, 
Which has served me well in many a crisis.
You predicted that I would live a long life; 
You were an angel and I know your spirit lives.

   -May, 

To whatever inspires anyone to write or share their verse.

 

So it shines bright and fair
As it must, well beyond reaching, 
As fine, as far, untouchable as stars. But they
Twinkle, glitter, fade. While this light, radiant, glows

Steadily, for all its blaze, for all its fire, 
Its shooting meteors. Strange that beneath
Its aromatic conflagration, its dire
Raging flame, the heartland, heathland, though it burns, 

Does not blacken with hopeless yearning. 
Rather, crust broken, woken from dreaming, it grows
Rosy in moments, readily losing its grey
Dusty tiredness, nor hoping, nor in fear

Of ruin, nor needing more than this teaching -
How to keep brightness from melting away- 
Not seeking meaning, nor wanting the beam
For its own. That fierce majestic gleam, 

Finds its way to so many. Does it know
Its own worth, how it turns
Keys in locks, opens doors, whirls
The dead times aside, drives out dusk with its rays-. 

How it rejoices pain, celebrates feeling, 
Forces eyes open, elevates weeping-? 
Or does it, in seeming solitude, unaware, 
Give its goodness oblivious? Does it despair 

As it shines bright and near, 
One, itself, as all beings, but breaching
The walls of remoteness - warmer, more dear, 
Lending us flavour, maturing peaches

High on our walls, sweeter than May, 
More luminous than scented suns, than day, 
Puzzling healing poetry out of our prose-
A never-ending, intricately lustrous rose. 

SOFT, small, and sweet as sunniest flowers
      That bask in heavenly heat
When bud by bud breaks, breathes, and cowers,
      Soft, small, and sweet.

A babe's hands open as to greet
      The tender touch of ours
And mock with motion faint and fleet

The minutes of the new strange hours
      That earth, not heaven, must mete;
Buds fragrant still from heaven's own bowers,
      Soft, small, and sweet.

A velvet vice with springs of steel
      That fasten in a trice
And clench the fingers fast that feel
      A velvet viceÑ

What man would risk the danger twice,
      Nor quake from head to heel?
Whom would not one such test suffice?

Well may we tremble as we kneel
      In sight of Paradise,
If both a babe's closed fists conceal
      A velvet vice.

Two flower-soft fists of conquering clutch,
      Two creased and dimpled wrists,
That match, if mottled overmuch,
      Two flower-soft fists---

What heart of man dare hold the lists
      Against such odds and such
Sweet vantage as no strength resists?

Our strength is all a broken crutch,
      Our eyes are dim with mists,
Our hearts are prisoners as we touch
      Two flower-soft fists. 

I would peer through the fences
As I walked along the street
It seemed shade trees kind of guarded
So the folks I couldn’t meet

Why, they must be so rich I thought
Too rich for the likes of me
But I slowed down my gait
Still could mostly just see trees

I fancied myself rich too some day
When I grew up and then
Because I had so much money 
I would spend and spend and spend

I would have a house much larger
Than any on this street 
And I would be much friendlier 
To anyone I’d meet 

That was when I was just a kid
When I grew up and walked by then
I wasn’t jealous any more 
But still enjoyed the classy blend

THIS is thy hour O Soul, thy free flight into the wordless,
   Away from books, away from art, the day erased, the lesson done,
   Thee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing, pondering the themes thou
         lovest best.
   Night, sleep, death and the stars. 

I have worn this day as a fretting, ill-made garment,
Impatient to be rid of it.
And lo, as I drew it off over my shoulders
This jewel caught in my hair. 

Recalling past events we often find as
Time rolls on, splint'ring golden memories
Into fragments, we need a resolutely
Patient mind, to pick thru' pieces left behind.
Then oozing love between each broken dream
We can scheme to stick the jigsaw shapes until
Quite whole and clear, we see then brilliantly, 
Another stored and well-loved memory.
Contentedly, we then can live in days when
Our young love was strong, as it used to be. 

There sandy seems the golden sky
And golden seems the sandy plain.
No habitation meets the eye
Unless in the horizon rim,
Some halfway up the limestone wall,
That spot of black is not a stain
Or shadow, but a cavern hole,
Where someone used to climb and crawl
To rest from his besetting fears.
I see the callus on his soul
The disappearing last of him
And of his race starvation slim,
Oh years ago - ten thousand years. 

Wound in metal optic nerves
your both hands swivel
one behind the other or for a time
together
round life's face of birth, death, worries
and old age
with the silent legless movement
of a slug, mistaking your and Man's passing years
for real Time
which no hand could ever catch. 

A clock stopped -- not the mantel's
   Geneva's farthest skill
Can't put the puppet bowing
   That just now dangled still.

An awe came on the trinket!
   The figures hunched with pain,
Then quivered out of decimals
   Into degreeless noon.

It will not stir for doctors,
   This pendulum of snow;
The shopman importunes it,
   While cool, concernless No

Nods from the gilded pointers,
   Nods from seconds slim,
Decades of arrogance between

The race of the season is over ; 
I've lost and Diana has won ; 
She's feasting on Broadacres' clover, 
And I am right out of the fun. 
Though Di was the one to begin it, 
She soon found me making the pace ; 
I thought all along I should win it, 
And only backed her for a place. 

At Ascot Diana was leading, 
At Henley I spurted ahead ; 
At Cowes side by side we were speeding; 
At Trouville I fancy I led. 
Neck to neck we ran, shoulder to shoulder, 
The pack was too killing to last 
(If the weather had only been colder!) 
I flagged, and Diana shot past. 

My heart's not by any means broken; 
I hope I'm not wanting in pluck ; 
A tear or two, low be it spoken, 
Then I kissed her and wished her good luck. 
Di won the race fairly as stated; 
But when her attractions are reckoned, 
My own must not be underrated 
I finished a very good second

a cloud came down
and spread over
it kept on coming
closer and closer
tranquility and reassurance
along with peace
which descended


A dark cloud of rain
drifted into my life
And for some time, 
I felt good, happy. 
I no longer felt lonely.

I thought life would go on happily
In one long, long stretch of time. 
But when the cold, harsh 
winds of change started blowing, 
The cloud of rain 
had to drift away. 

Life is still going on
In one long, long stretch of time. 
I am not lonely.
I can't say I am sad or unhappy.
But you have left a void
That would take me 
a long, long time to fill. 

Arms hold the soundless music of the sky.
The lyricism of the soul burns high.
Brief poems dance with distance against space, 
Snow interlocks the landscape into place.

I look at you through bare bones of old trees, 
Invoke the magic of simplicity.
You write me verses while the moments fall.
White notes that never can my tears annul.

Best that emotions not be said aloud.
You paint our picture on a passing cloud, 
Which, like a child, I try to memorize, 
Before it fades like winter from my eyes. 

A cloud`s romance 
 White butterflies covered the glade like a film star`s living room 
still unspoilt by drops of red wine, cake crumbs and vomits.  
They suddenly flew up over tree tops became a white cloud drifting 
about looking for another green dell that was perfectly happy being 
green, yet pleased when the cloud landed and became a white carpet. 
Mind, it had wanted to be occupied by many-  coloured butterflies 
it had happened to the clearing before and the forest`s animal came 
to admire the beauty of a carpet that only appeared once every 
years.  The oldest animal in the forest a boar that had survived
 when hunters come by rolling itself into a lump pretending to be a rock 
peed on by dogs, man`s best friend, what a joke cowardly creatures
serving man and betraying their own, told of a day when the glade was 
golden one morning dazzling everyone but in the end it was buttercups 
a delicatessen for rabbits and feral cows also called elks. 
Elk or caribou as some say are animals wolves like to kill and eat, and
humans hunt and kill for fun.  Elks cannot be used domestically as
they have small udders dry meat and tend to be belligerent and will not 
sit up and beg like a dog that has lost all its dignity.   
Meanwhile, a white cloud is wandering on blue just being endearing. 

A cloud shinned up a mountain,
a lightning struck it; 
it felt helpless
when
trapped in the lap of the mountain range; 
flight was forbidden,
a rock gripped it
and
it fell
and
reached the bottom
with a bang.
I thought it was a thunder
till
the unexpected happened in home.
A friend invited a friend to a feast.
Does anyone ask the first snowfall:
'Where were you born? 'A Cloud withdrew from the Sky
Superior Glory be
But that Cloud and its Auxiliaries
Are forever lost to me

Had I but further scanned
Had I secured the Glow
In an Hermetic Memory
It had availed me now.

Never to pass the Angel
With a glance and a Bow
Till I am firm in Heaven
Is my intention now. 

The sky was dark
Not knowing what to do
Wanting to give up
Because you thought you'd never see the sun
But then someone shone a flashlight through the darkness
and you could see again
and soon after
The clouds disappeared
slowly but surely
The sky cleared
and you could see again
the blindfold was gone
The world filled back up with color
It's time for the story to continue
No more darkness
The time might haunt you
But the story must continue
No more looking down
You finally looked up
and in the blink of an eye
there it was
what you wished for
A cloudless sky


I'm oddly old

young-mind paradox

eyes glassed
see all
play ‘Catch-a-Subject'

snapshot brain races
blowing in the words

oldoldoldoldold! 

I'm effin' old
legs last another walk
along the high street

eyes crawl flit crawl

FLIT! 
 
The Leggy Girl 
gorgeous 
captured
lashes long 
longing  
accentuate the blink of blue

solid bounce of bust 
titillates 

SHE KNOWS

knows not of me
feeling her with metaphors
notching up a fantasy
with palimpsest
and ink
deep I go

oldoldoldoldold! 

I'm youthfully old 
no subcutaneous fat for Slaughter 
Mark R. Slaughter's wiry arm
twisty stubborn

my psalm of life
my pen
my strange imagination
battle on

a back-street wander steals a shifty cat 
death-night charcoal
he's fifteenth century lore and ghost
and eyes me up for terror target 

he'll do for written thought! 

on: the morrow of a day
and I meander by the water

the pond ponders
shares my recollections
captured in a unison of gliding ripples
riding o'er the mirror
like fingers lightly stroking mammary skin
a sensuous trail
to happen o'er her nipples

and in the blur
reflections
dance in grand contortions
thro' a space-time wake of swans
consumed in melancholic muse

oldoldoldoldold! 

I'm old
yet I'm at home with age 
age-old age 
adage-riddled
strewn across a page
drowned
in second-rate sketches

I catch a cloudy thought
within the yin and yang of sleep
search inside my drunken face
jaundiced with the nicotine
of thigh-blessed cigars

ears closed 
I droop to Thirties' blues
draw on the harp
forget the worries
let whiskers grey. 

-

Though sparse, 
The mist of mind hangs; 
And yet I capture all the
Strumming chords, 
Finger-picking neural play
To freshen up the brain, 
Goad me think: 

For once I do -! 

And yet again, 
I think of you!

and how they take us far

Oh, she was ever so beautiful
As she stood out in the grass
A pristine white fence surrounds her
There’s no way I could simply pass

I know she hoped that I would visit
I knew that’s what she thought
I’d snapped some amazing pictures
Great remembrances of her I’ve got 

For I saw this pretty lady before
As she stood within her stall
Beth is the name she is called
She’s lovely and that’s not all

She has a grace you can’t imagine
She’d be clumsy you might think
But she’s neat when she nibbles grain
And lady-like when she drinks

Her markings are absolutely perfect
A white blaze upon her face 
If you get her relative’s book down
Impressive ancestry you would trace

She’s a charmer, oh she really is
Makes you want to kiss her nose
Gentle and extremely wonderful 
She’s relaxed and quite composed 

I hope you can visit like I did
This beautiful Clydesdale gal
I wish I could see her every day
I know we’d be such pals

I MADE my song a coat
Covered with embroideries
Out of old mythologies
From heel to throat;
But the fools caught it,
Wore it in the world's eyes
As though they'd wrought it.
Song, let them take it,
For there's more enterprise
In walking naked. 

I WALKED into that room.
I took the raincoat off, set it hanging

On a nail; I spun around
Cold, to consider at length and well

Myself, it seemed, hanging there
On a nail—

These are the same
Shoulders, these are my arms

Disjected, I have known this
Incoherence of buttons

Clinging—Unreasonable, unyielding thread!—
This way and that to all too familiar holes

—Thus, duly inspected, I
Took to the door, I checked myself

Out, out from this rack
Of cloth, this institution, this store.

Then there were two
Strangers, yes they were both

Strangers, the two of them something
Odd, and surpassing eager—

"Is there anything his he left behind
Anything to survive, something used

Something old, something he wore
To cover his head, something scribbled

Or green, something fresh, a poem
He did not live to publish? He had on a coat

At the end,
For rain."

"Yes he did,
There is a room above
Where it hung
on a nail.
We none of us could
Bring ourselves
To look
Till the day we tried it on
Ourselves,
Till it fit
And we let it lie after, left it well enough
Alone
It’s been a few days since
We let
The rag-picker have it
For who
Knows how much.
What’s it to you?"

"It is wanted, naturally,
By the museum of letters—
Won’t you say who has it
Or if there is a mark
To certify it?"

"And how will you get your hands on it?
Will you fish for it
On the mountain
Of rags? Listen,
Friend,
There is something,
Stitched into the lining,
A label its very own:
TAILOR-MASTER"Now Jones had left his new-wed bride to keep his house in order,
And hied away to the Hurrum Hills above the Afghan border,
To sit on a rock with a heliograph; but ere he left he taught
His wife the working of the Code that sets the miles at naught.

And Love had made him very sage, as Nature made her fair;
So Cupid and Apollo linked , per heliograph, the pair.
At dawn, across the Hurrum Hills, he flashed her counsel wise --
At e'en, the dying sunset bore her busband's homilies.

He warned her 'gainst seductive youths in scarlet clad and gold,
As much as 'gainst the blandishments paternal of the old;
But kept his gravest warnings for (hereby the ditty hangs)
That snowy-haired Lothario, Lieutenant-General Bangs.

'Twas General Bangs, with Aide and Staff, who tittupped on the way,
When they beheld a heliograph tempestuously at play.
They thought of Border risings, and of stations sacked and burnt --
So stopped to take the message down -- and this is whay they learnt --

"Dash dot dot, dot, dot dash, dot dash dot" twice. The General swore.
"Was ever General Officer addressed as 'dear' before?
"'My Love,' i' faith! 'My Duck,' Gadzooks! 'My darling popsy-wop!'

The artless Aide-de-camp was mute; the gilded Staff were still,
As, dumb with pent-up mirth, they booked that message from the hill;
For clear as summer lightning-flare, the husband's warning ran: --
"Don't dance or ride with General Bangs -- a most immoral man


[At dawn, across the Hurrum Hills, he flashed her counsel wise --
But, howsoever Love be blind, the world at large hath eyes.]
With damnatory dot and dash he heliographed his wife
Some interesting details of the General's private life.

The artless Aide-de-camp was mute, the shining Staff were still,
And red and ever redder grew the General's shaven gill.
And this is what he said at last (his feelings matter not): --
"I think we've tapped a private line. Hi! Threes about there! Trot!"

All honour unto Bangs, for ne'er did Jones thereafter know
By word or act official who read off that helio.
But the tale is on the Frontier, and from Michni to Moo
ltan
They know the worthy General as "that most immoral man

"I drink milky coffee
cos' I don't like it black.
It ain't because I'm weird
or stuff or anything like that.
I just like milky coffee
but when I asked  for it
no one understood me
although I gasped for it.

I went into this burger bar
and asked the guy to make one.
He looked at me quite vacant
and asked me to explain one.
I said you tip some coffee out
and put a drop more milk in, 
but he just stood there gapin'
and said he couldn't do it! 

I really hate hot coffee
and I ain't gonna lie
I'd rather eat asbestos
than let my poor tongue fry.
So now I'm drinkin' fruit juice, 
to make like I'm discernin'.
They serve it at posh restaurants.
It stops my stomach churnin'. 

A Coffin—is a small Domain,
Yet able to contain
A Citizen of Paradise
In it diminished Plane.

A Grave—is a restricted Breadth—
Yet ampler than the Sun—
And all the Seas He populates
And Lands He looks upon

To Him who on its small Repose
Bestows a single Friend—
Circumference without Relief—
Or Estimate—or End—The hills hang woods around, where green, below
Dark, breezy boughs of beech-trees, mats the moss,
Crisp with the brittle hulls of last year's nuts;
The water hums one bar there; and a glow
Of gold lies steady where the trailers toss
Red, bugled blossoms and a rock abuts;
In spots the wild-phlox and oxalis grow
Where beech-roots bulge the loam, protrude across
The grass-grown road and roll it into ruts.

And where the sumach brakes grow dusk and dense,
Among the rocks, great yellow violets,
Blue-bells and wind-flowers bloom; the agaric
In dampness crowds; a Fungus, thick, intense
With gold and crimson and wax-white, that sets
The May-apples along the terraced creek
At bold defiance. Where the old rail-fence
Divides the hollow, there the bee-bird whets
His bill, and there the elder hedge is thick.

No one can miss it; for two cat-birds nest,
Calling all morning, in the trumpet-vine;
And there at noon the pewee sits and floats
A woodland welcome; and his very best
At eve the red-bird sings, as if to sign
The record of its loveliness with notes.
At night the moon stoops over it to rest,
And unreluctant stars. Where waters shine
There runs a whisper as of wind-swept oats. 

Every critic in the town
Runs the minor poet down;
Every critic--don't you know it?
Is himself a minor poet. 

Cold insecurity
now slept on, feels sharp
in the morning light.

Fear takes a hold, 
her eyes deepen 
her worries multiply.

White sheets 
are no protection
as she delays getting up.

Pondering, fretting, 
she can't put a stopper 
in debt.

The letterbox bangs, 
startlingly harsh
as her children stir.

She shudders
as the final demands
hit the hallway floor. 

I offered my heart
in the palm of my hand, 
a burning nova
to a private world
where love and forgiveness 
knew no bounds

tender and trusting, 
it beat only for you
so long ago

but hurt fans out 
like the surface ripples 
on a pond after a pebble falls, 
each new hurt
spreading rings ever wider

and with each new ring, 
more feelings fade
spreading wider, chilling deeper, 
til cold as ice, 
they become as stones
bouncing on a frozen pond

their rhythm etched forever
in a cold, cold heart. 

On this cold, gray-wintry day, 
The sun is nowhere to be found.

Listen!  I hear the rain: 
Pit pat, pit pat—dripppppp, plop.
Pit pat, pit pat—dripppppp, plop.

Like a sad song, its music play
To the melancholy lyric of: 
"A Cold, Gray Wintry Day."A snowy icy night, painted hill tops all are white, 
all the rivers flow like ice, and raindrops fall as hail, 
from so very, very high, above.
Whispered breath, a smoky kind of grey, 
as I wander in the coldness of my winter dreams, 
trees stretching skywards hold distant memories
of rustled leaves and a lazy warming friendly breeze.
I so much love you and I want you by my side
in the coldness of this dark and lonely frozen hour.
Your lips are all I ever miss, 
as I stand here cold and with a sense of helplessness
waiting for your kiss to bring back love and summertime
to the chilled and bitter darkness, that I often find.
On this snowy icy night of my winter dreams
please hurry, come back home to me
and bring that warm and gentle loving face, 
the one that I do miss so very much.
How I wish that you were always here
then nothing would we ever fear
and even in the cold and dark
our love will keep us safe and warm
until the coming of the calm and gentle, warming, dawn. 

A cold rain starting
And no hat --
So

We just sat there.
It was a cold rainy day
Our backs were to each other
For there was nothing left to say.

Was it really raining? 
Or were those just tears 
Streaming from my eyes? 
I never should have tried to brand
When I knew you could never be mine

The wind picked up 
Whipping harshly at my face
But I kept my back turned to you 
Afraid to look you in the face 

You stood and looked at me
As the rain started to poor
Asking me with your eyes 
If I was completely sure 

Not risking one last glance 
I rose and walked away
It was only when I disappeared into the fog
That I heard you yell for me to stay

It was a cold rainy day
The day I cleaned up the mess I made 
It was a cold rainy day
A perfect day for heartbreak


For me every day is a holiday, 
and the proceeding nice night, 
what else I can say, 
is lovely and bright! 

For me it's lovely and bright, 
Our shadows on curtains, 
Okay I off the light, 
Now nothing it sustains.

For me the cold is exciting, 
but you are still shivering, 
hot arms are inviting, 
try you will find it fevering.

For me is the winter, 
be a little more crazing, 
it's a night of December, 
its charms are amazing.

For me not the snow falls, 
it's only raining, 
listen to the calls, 
from the roof it's draining.

For me It's a bold lovely call, 
I'm coming to you now, 
don't you hear at all? 
soil's welcome wow! 

For me earth is a paradise, 
I have a fairy in my arms, 
everything I excise, 
need you and your charms.

For me for the rest is morning, 
for the best is night, 
cold winter is charming, 
and you are a delight. 

Spring was dull this year
but then we had snow. 
It glistened like starlight 
to a prisoner.

The tulips and daffodils
hid beneath the ground
for fear of 
extinction.

We waited for sunshine
as days lengthened
and cold fingers warmed, 
remembering the frost.

When summer came, 
a profusion of colour
shone from
a clear blue sky.

I ran across 
green fields, 
free as a puppy 
on its first jaunt.

I didn't go home 
until the last drop 
of sun 
left the sky. 

The pain has past
The ancient tears of that century
Have dried and left only shadows of sorrow
The vines of gray you planted
Your lies
Have ripened  
Vintage vinegar 
Cold and pure


Weeds creeping to grow.
A cold wind; withering my
E-colored eyebrow. 

According to the forecasts
In the north this winter will be cold
Wetter too, they are saying
You know how quick that can get old.

The south, however will be warmer
Or so the "experts" say
It is perfect for the bugs and such
Who will then live for another day.

But I live in the northwest part
Of our country that will probably stay
The same, but for some of you
A cold winter in the USA

A collection of flowers
Out on the farm
All different colors
With each its own charm.

Sunflowers and poppies, 
Snapdragons as well
I do so love flowers
You surely can tell.

So come to my farm
I will share them with you
If you want to know flowers
These are great to pursue




Laws created as they are, 
Could be interpreted to many. 
As making little sense.
Especially when those, 
Who preside over them. 
Have difficulty explaining, 
Just where that thin line begins.
Getting thinner but far from relinguishing, 
To diminish an ultimate end.

Something that naturally grows, 
And is 'illegally' smoked.
Is considered to be a federal offense.
With the locking up behind bars, 
For bringing a harm, if done, to folks.
With the filling up of prison cells, 
At the taxpayer's expense.

Which makes perfect sense.
To those earning a living. 
Marketing a lucrative decadence.
With a revolving done of their doors.

However. 
Someone who commits mass murder, 
Is not only granted psycological treatment.
But a background check. 
For anything to prove a dysfunctional childhood.
Which is eventually used, 
To provide one empathy and a defense one gets.

A miscarriage of justice? 
Whoever they are to became attracted, 
To allow the birth of this ludicrous twistedness. 
Are the ones who should be accused, 
And scrutinized for not using adequate birth prevention.

And yet. 
Those who are labelled as dissidents, 
Are considered to pose the greatest threat. 
To such standards that are valued to those, 
With a collective and 'normal' mindset projected. 
To protect. 

An industry of knowledge where citizens are made, 
A field of intellect where its seeds are sown, 
To reap them somewhere else, 
A blessed place even for the cursed. 

I

When one is young and eager,
A bejant and a boy,
Though his moustache be meagre,
That cannot mar his joy
When at the Competition
He takes a fair position,
And feels he has a mission,
A talent to employ.

With pride he goes each morning
Clad in a scarlet gown,
A cap his head adorning
(Both bought of Mr. Brown);
He hears the harsh bell jangle,
And enters the quadrangle,
The classic tongues to mangle
And make the ancients frown.

He goes not forth at even,
He burns the midnight oil,
He feels that all his heaven
Depends on ceaseless toil;
Across his exercises
A dream of many prizes
Before his spirit rises,
And makes his raw blood boil.

II

Though he be green as grass is,
And fresh as new-mown hay
Before the first year passes
His verdure fades away.
His hopes now faintly glimmer,
Grow dim and ever dimmer,
And with a parting shimmer
Melt into 'common day.'

He cares no more for Liddell
Or Scott; and Smith, and White,
And Lewis, Short, and Riddle
Are 'emptied of delight.'
Todhunter and Colenso
(Alas, that friendships end so!)
He curses in extenso
Through morning, noon, and night.

No more with patient labour
The midnight oil he burns,
But unto some near neighbour
His fair young face he turns,
To share the harmless tattle
Which bejants love to prattle,
As wise as infant's rattle
Or talk of coots and herns.

At midnight round the city
He carols wild and free
Some sweet unmeaning ditty
In many a changing key;
And each succeeding verse is
Commingled with the curses
Of those whose sleep disperses
Like sal volatile.

He shaves and takes his toddy
Like any fourth year man,
And clothes his growing body
After another plan
Than that which once delighted
When, in the days benighted,
Like some wild thing excited
About the fields he ran.

III

A sweet life and an idle
He lives from year to year,
Unknowing bit or bridle
(There are no proctors here),
Free as the flying swallow
Which Ida's Prince would follow
If but his bones were hollow,
Until the end draws near.

Then comes a Dies Irae,
When full of misery
And torments worse than fiery
He crams for his degree;
And hitherto unvexed books,
Dry lectures, abstracts, text-books,
Perplexing and perplexed books,
Make life seem vanity.

IV

Before admiring sister
And mother, see, he stands,
Made Artium Magister
With laying on of hands.
He gives his books to others
(Perchance his younger brothers),
And free from all such bothers
Goes out into all lands. 

she knew it was the last free breath that she would ever take.

Right then and there she knew it, her world forever changed.
Her life took on new meaning as if all was prearranged.

She knew she had to meet him, this guy moved in next door.
So she slipped on her bikini and went strolling by the shore.

She paid him no attention, just made sure that he would see
the woman he would surely love from then till eternity.


When he first saw her walking down the beach without a care
he didn't have the nerve to speak, just gave an open stare.

He knew right then he loved her though he didn't know her name.
From that day on he knew his life would never be the same.

He tried to get attention yet you'd think she didn't see
the feelings that he couldn't hide had nearly made him flee.

He knew he had to meet her, this young girl in the sun.
He made his move and from then on their worlds had become one.


When their eyes met they melted almost beyond control.
The world began to tremble with this collision of the souls.

Many watched the fireworks that day out by the lake.
The water was the backdropp for the love they'd surely make.

Their love was overpowering, yet ever gently so.
It made each think that they must never let the other go. 

It winds along the face of a cliff 
This path which I long to explore, 
And over it dashes a waterfall, 
And the air is full of the roar 
And the thunderous voice of waters which sweep 
In a silver torrent over some steep. 

It clears the path with a mighty bound 
And tumbles below and away, 
And the trees and the bushes which grow in the rocks 
Are wet with its jewelled spray; 
The air is misty and heavy with sound, 
And small, wet wildflowers star the ground. 

Oh! The dampness is very good to smell, 
And the path is soft to tread, 
And beyond the fall it winds up and on, 
While little streamlets thread 
Their own meandering way down the hill 
Each singing its own little song, until 

I forget that 't is only a pictured path, 
And I hear the water and wind, 
And look through the mist, and strain my eyes 
To see what there is behind; 
For it must lead to a happy land, 
This little path by a waterfall spanned. 

Relics of castles and mines fill the eye
Of the curious here,  tell their own tale
With colourful mixture of  'truth and lie'
Known as legend.   This allure never fails
Along Cornish coasts, where adventures leap
From every cave. The past is present, clings
With dark grit to each cliff and white beach.
Old cannon ball scars, and granite rock rings
Where victims stood no chance.  Castellated
Forts brought battle's swift end to each mighty
Man, and slower death to prisoners,  fated
To black dungeon cell.  Danger fell in flights
Of ladders too, which daily took the lives
Of countless miners,  toiling  in the dark
To dig for tin.   Sea above,  and striving
With the deadly wet within, souls made marks
Of painful gain with every load.  Beauty
Was not noticed then, daylight hours and night
The same, lives were spent in laboured duty.
Viewed now by tourist, never will seem quite
As tragic as old gravestones tell.   Former
Days were coloured with tough life, bravely borne. 

A combustible woman from Thang
Exploded one day with a BANG!
The maid then rushed in
And said with a grin,
'Pardon me, madam -  you rang.


'There was a humorous president, 
Whatever he said—that he meant.
Barring all else, 
He made fun of himself.
For he was a comedian’s mint. 

MADAM, you bade me act a part, 
A comedy of your devising-- 
Forbade me to consult my heart, 
To be sincere--or compromising. 


The play was not my own device, 
My stage-struck youth lies far behind me; 
And yet--I thought it would be nice 
To play the part that you assigned me. 


Thus have I learned my rôle so well 
That, as I play, you question whether 
Fate has not taught your jest a spell 
To bind me to you altogether. 


The truth is this: so ill I wrought 
In mastering the part you gave me, 
That now 'tis tyrant of my thought, 
And nothing in the world can save me! 


Between me and my work, your face, 
In haunting fashion, daily lingers; 
Your eyes make mine their dwelling place 
Your dream-hand thrills my idle fingers. 


Through death-white nights I dream of you-- 
Of what might move, and what has moved you-- 
Ah! no! There's nothing you can do!.  
.  

It's not as though I really loved you. 

A couple went to the family doctor
        Husband to get his usual insulin dose
        And wife takes her contraceptive injection.
        There is a new doctor in the absence of the Physician.
        The new doctor is really an absent minded mediocre
        Who does illegal abortions? 
        It seems by mistake the syringes being changed
       And the husband got the contraceptive and wife the insulin.
       Then after sometimes she conceived for the fifth occasion. 

ambition and becoming
and plans and aspirations
and ideals and holy-book dreams
and yearning for one after another: 
then the wind blows through our fleshless skulls
in a Dali-Goya landscape


A comforting Angel came to see me today. An Angel kisseed kissed my tears away. I wasn't feeling quiiet myself. 

I felt a warmth brush came by me quickly and dried my tears away. A gentle touch immedialety. I felt better. So now  the day seemed brighter. I guess  that's just the way you feel when an Angel comforts you. written and Posted e lie together in complete silence
Not speaking a word, just let our hearts beat
And listen to them tell one another how in love they are 
I'll put my ear to your heart and listen to it beating
As if every beat were a different reason for you loving me

Running my fingers through your as you sleep
You dream, dreams of us that when you wake shall come true
Worry not, you'll never lose me
Cry not, any tears you shed in vain I'll consume, so you don't see them and grow sadder

You'll never lose my love
You may misplace it
You may lose sight of it
You may even lose part of it
But, you'll never lose all of it

For you could not have been created by man
Nor machine
Nor any form of science
Let me die, in the knowledge that the life I
have lived, was one of worth and the seasons
that have past, were not wasted.
where Fairies Sing in Passion, 
Free of charge is a Slow Poison, 
that doesn't kill, 
just makes us ecstatic, 
Firing the Sour Prose, 
Feel a Sweet Poetry,

let me die in it, 
I don't know the name of this fairy, 
but it's a pleasure to dance with her, 
I don't know her religion, Color or Crete, , 
but Edward Kofi Louis hasn't only danced 
with her like me,

and when he says it's muse of true love, 
I believe, 
I trust, 
my friend cannot be wrong.' I wuz innocent' he cries, 
his hands upraised in righteousness, 

the gun still smoking in his right hand, 
a handful of his opponent's shirt in his left, 

his arm smeared with mud from the ball's illicit touch, 
his boot toecapped in the sunlight, 

gleaming wet with his rival's blood


A little say to you, my darling-
You don't come and love me
I can't commit you as because
I am not alone, I loved thee-
A millions of patriotic heart, 
are hopefully waiting for me
And I have been hearing thee, 
voices from dawn to till night-
They are calling me as slam-bang, 
with a same lyric and melody
As like as a national anthem, 
is sang as sonorous by together thee
Darling, I can love thy if you love thee
If you come and go with me there
and sing a song what they are singing
I commit you that I will be with you 
forever and ever-

Of his trade—
With mental powers at work, 
A true poet rarely sleeps.  
His mind ever churning 
With powerful imagery 
That produces thought, 
Sound, rhythm and gesture.  
He molds with metaphor,  
Shapes with simile,  
And paints with irony
Like some great maestro
In his toil to produce 
A beautiful symphony 
For himself and all who would enjoy.  
Little wonder he rarely sleeps.

I am thankful that I found a friend, 
who veraciously believes in me.

Two minds of the creative, 
concertedly understand, 
that we share a common concept, 
and from that, a common bond.

I am grateful to your ideals, 
and how they interact with mine.
I am forever indebted to your critiques, 
because I am inspired, by what you write.

I wrote this for a very good friend of mine, Afzal Shauq :)He works so hard every day
Doing pretty much what he’s told
The days slowly turn into years
As his life carefully unfolds

He sweats and agonizes and toils
To put food on the table each day
Keeping family fed and clothed
And he does it his own unique way

His love for family is his passion
For he wants the best life he can make
For his wife and his kids and his dog 
Praying his spirit won’t break

As he drives home every day
He goes past a barn lost in age
Falling apart and he knows 
Some day he’ll be at that stage

Horses roam in their fences
Lost in their own sort of world
He wonders if their life is not better
Instead of the world he’s been hurled

But he’s strong and yes, he’s constant
For he knows how to take a stand
Knowing at times he’ll make mistakes
For after all, he is just a common man

I pray you to take me to that height, 
From where fall is not possible, 
But I know my worth, 
Being a human being I am the victim of
All those infirmities which a comman man has, 
Jealousy, prejudice, hatred, anger, and greed, 
inhabit my mind, 
I confess my sin yet I am not strong enough
To stay away from them, 
And help me attain that height of spiritual glory, 
From where fall is not possible. 

The day is turning ghost, 
And scuttles from the kalendar in fits and furtively, 
   To join the anonymous host 
Of those that throng oblivion; ceding his place, maybe, 
   To one of like degree. 

   I part the fire-gnawed logs, 
Rake forth the embers, spoil the busy flames, and lay the ends 
   Upon the shining dogs; 
Further and further from the nooks the twilight's stride extends, 
   And beamless black impends. 

   Nothing of tiniest worth 
Have I wrought, pondered, planned; no one thing asking blame or 
praise, 
   Since the pale corpse-like birth 
Of this diurnal unit, bearing blanks in all its rays - 
   Dullest of dull-hued Days! 

   Wanly upon the panes 
The rain slides as have slid since morn my colourless thoughts; and 
yet 
   Here, while Day's presence wanes, 
And over him the sepulchre-lid is slowly lowered and set, 
   He wakens my regret. 

   Regret--though nothing dear 
That I wot of, was toward in the wide world at his prime, 
   Or bloomed elsewhere than here, 
To die with his decease, and leave a memory sweet, sublime, 
   Or mark him out in Time . . . 

   --Yet, maybe, in some soul, 
In some spot undiscerned on sea or land, some impulse rose, 
   Or some intent upstole 
Of that enkindling ardency from whose maturer glows 
   The world's amendment flows; 

   But which, benumbed at birth 
By momentary chance or wile, has missed its hope to be 
   Embodied on the earth; 
And undervoicings of this loss to man's futurity 
   May wake regret in me. 

In todays technological uptrend
we have the world within our hand
a network could take us all around
 
A  gap within ourselves at hand
no technology could do to mend
a gap between the heart and mind
 
A dangerous gap at hand
it engulfs the soul in deep sand
no technology yet could mend
 
The heart would cry out for the world
the mind is petty and cold
not very far from each other the two ends
 
the mind is the ' doer'
the heart is the 'teller'
the mind prefers not to be a listener
 
soul rules the heart
fear rules the mind
conscience is the real communicator
 
CONSCIENCE IS THE TRUE COMMUNICATION TOOBoruck and Waterman upon their grills
In Hades lay, with many a sigh and groan,
Hotly disputing, for each swore his own
Were clearly keener than the other's ills.
And, truly, each had much to boast of-bone
And sinew, muscle, tallow, nerve and skin,
Blood in the vein and marrow in the shin,
Teeth, eyes and other organs (for the soul
Has all of these and even a wagging chin)
Blazing and coruscating like a coal!
For Lower Sacramento, you remember,
Has trying weather, even in mid-December.

Now this occurred in the far future. All
Mankind had been a million ages dead,
And each to her reward above had sped,
Each to his punishment below,-I call
That quite a just arrangement. As I said,
Boruck and Waterman in warmest pain
Crackled and sizzed with all their might and main.
For, when on earth, they'd freed a scurvy host
Of crooks from the State prison, who again
Had robbed and ravaged the Pacific Coast
And (such the felon's predatory nature)
Even got themselves into the Legislature.

So Waterman and Boruck lay and roared
In Hades. It is true all other males
Felt the like flames and uttered equal wails,
But did not suffer _them_; whereas _they_ bored
Each one the other. But indeed my tale's
Not getting on at all. They lay and browned
Till Boruck (who long since his teeth had ground
Away and spoke Gum Arabic and made
Stump speeches even in praying) looked around
And said to Bob's incinerated shade:
'Your Excellency, this is mighty hard on
The inventors of the unpardonable pardon.'

The other soul-his right hand all aflame,
For 'twas with that he'd chiefly sinned, although
His tongue, too, like a wick was working woe
To the reserve of tallow in his frame-
Said, with a sputtering, uncertain flow,
And with a gesture like a shaken torch:
'Yes, but I'm sure we'll not much longer scorch.
Although this climate is not good for Hope,
Whose joyous wing 'twould singe, I think the porch
Of Hell we'll quit with a pacific slope.
Last century I signified repentance
And asked for commutation of our sentence.'

Even as he spoke, the form of Satan loomed
In sight, all crimson with reflections's fire,
Like some tall tower or cathedral spire
Touched by the dawn while all the earth is gloomed
In mists and shadows of the night time. 'Sire,'
Said Waterman, his agitable wick
Still sputtering, 'what calls you back so quick?
It scarcely was a century ago
You left us.' 'I have come to bring,' said Nick,
'St. Peter's answer (he is never slow
In correspondence) to your application
For pardon-pardon me!-for commutation.

'He says that he's instructed to reply
(And he has so instructed me) that sin
Like yours-and this poor gentleman's who's in
For bad advice to you-comes rather high;
But since, apparently, you both begin
To feel some pious promptings to the right,
And fain would turn your faces to the light,
Eternity seems all too long a term.
So 'tis commuted to one-half. I'm quite
Prepared, when that expires, to free the worm
And quench the fire.' And, civilly retreating,
He left them holding their protracted meeting. 

The difference between them was palpable, 
kind of off key like a strange smell, 
they didn't quite gel.

She'd go her way, smooth and easy, 
thoughtful and kind, straight, 
and trusting.

He was a hard, edgy man, private, not shy, 
a sharp tongue __ tough, 
so you see the situation.

She tried to wring his neck once, 
when they'd had a fight, 
you'd never believe it! 

Now they're this old couple, 
timeless, mild, like peas in a pod
You'd never have guessed their past

and when they sit together 
it's a companionable 
kind of love. 

The lapse of time and rivers is the same,
Both speed their journey with a restless stream;
The silent pace, with which they steal away,
No wealth can bribe, no prayers persuade to stay;
Alike irrevocable both when past,
And a wide ocean swallows both at last.
Though each resemble each in every part,
A difference strikes at length the musing heart;
Streams never flow in vain; where streams abound,
How laughs the land with various plenty crown’d!
But time, that should enrich the nobler mind,
Neglected, leaves a dreary waste behind. 

Sweet stream that winds through yonder glade, 
Apt emblem of a virtuous maid 
Silent and chaste she steals along, 
Far from the world's gay busy throng: 
With gentle yet prevailing force, 
Intent upon her destined course; 
Graceful and useful all she does, 
Blessing and blest where'er she goes; 
Pure-bosom'd as that watery glass, 
And Heaven reflected in her face. 

In the instant whirling 
Of a tornado, 
A father throws himself
Upon a child, 
To protect him from
A falling tree.
The child lives, 
But the young father dies. 

To whom 
do I complain
is it here. ? 

People living round me 
whom my heart reaches
trying to beat as one
run from me

I present songs of love
played on my heart's violin
But they would rather
dance for money.



Your love hath been, nor long ago,
A fountain at my fond heart's door,
Whose only business was to flow;
And flow it did; not taking heed
Of its own bounty, or my need.

What happy moments did I count!
Blest was I then all bliss above!
Now, for that consecrated fount
Of murmuring, sparkling, living love,
What have I? Shall I dare to tell?
A comfortless and hidden well.

A well of love--it may be deep--
I trust it is,--and never dry:
What matter? If the waters sleep
In silence and obscurity.
--Such change, and at the very door
Of my fond heart, hath made me poor. 

He lodged us in a spacious house,
And plenteous was our fare.
But now at every frugal meal
There's not a scrap to spare.
Alas! alas that this good man
Could not go on as he began

In the long night, when every creature should
naturally take some rest, or else his life cannot long
hold out, then it falls most into my woeful thoughts
how I have dropped so far behind that except death
nothing can comfort me, so do I despair of all
happiness. This thought remains with me until
morning, and forth from morning until eve. I need
borrow no grief; I have both leisure and leave to
mourn. There is no creature who will take my woe or
forbid me to weep enough and wail my fill; the sore
spark of pain destroys me.
This love has so placed me that he will never fulfill
my desire; for neither pity, mercy, nor grace can I
find. Yet even for fear of death can I not root out love
from my sorrowful heart. The more I love, the more
my lady pains me; through which I see, without
remedy, that I may in no way escape death.
Now in truth I will rehearse her name. She is called
Goodness-set-in-womanhood, Staidness-in-youth,
and Beauty-without-pride, and Pleasure-under-
control-and-fear. Her surname is Fair-ruthless,
Wisdom-knit-to-fortune. Because I love her she slays
me guiltless. Her I love best, and shall as long as I
live, better an hundred thousand times than myself,
better than all the riches and created beings of this world.
Now has not Love bestowed me well, to love where I
shall never have part or lot! Alas, so is Fortune's
wheel turned for me, so am I slain with Love's fiery
arrow! I can only love her best, my sweet foe. Love
has taught me no more of his art than ever to serve,
and cease for no sorrow.
Within my true, care-worn heart there is so much
woe, and so little joy as well, that woe is me that ever
I was born. For all that I desire I lack, and all that
ever I would not have, that, in truth, I ever find ready
to my hand. And of all this I know not to whom to
complain, for she who might bring me out of this
cares not whether I weep or sing, so little pities she
my pain. Alas! In sleeping-time I wake; when I
should dance I tremble with fear.
This heavy life I lead for your sake, though you pay
For truly I dare say it, as I see it: I seems to methat
your sweet heart of steel is now whetted against me
too keenly. My dear heart, foe best-beloved, why will
you do me all this sorrow? What have I done or said
to grieve you, except that I serve and love you and
nobody else, and as long as I live will ever?
Therefore, sweet, be not displeased. You are so good
and fair, it would be a very great wonder if you did
not have suitors of all kinds, both good and bad; and
the least worthy of all, I am he.
Nevertheless, my own sweet lady, though I be
unskillful and unfit ever to serve your highness, even
as best I knew how, yet this I swear, there is nobody
more glad than I to do your pleasure or to cure
whatever I know to distress you. And had I as much
power as will, then should you feel whether it were
so or not; for in this world is no living being who
would more gladly fulfill your heart's desire. For I
both love and fear you so sorely, and ever must and
have done right long, that none is better loved, and
never shall be. And yet I would only beg you to
believe me well, and be not angry, and let me
continue to serve you. Lo, this is all! For I am not so
bold or mad as to desire that you should love me; for
alas! Well I know that may not be; I have so little
worth, and you so much. For you are one of the most
excellent of the living, and I the most unlikely to
prosper. Yet, for all this, know you right well you
shall not so drive me from your service that I shall
not ever serve you faithfully, with all my five wits,
whatever woe I feel. For I am so set upon you that
though you never pity me, I must love you and ever
be as true as any man living can be.
The more I love you, goodly and noble one, the less I
find you love me. Alas! When will that obduracy
soften? Where now is all your womanly pity, your
noble gentleness, your graciousness? Will you spend
nothing of it on me? And as wholly as I am your,
sweet, and as great will I have to serve you, if thus
you let me die, you have gained but little from it. For
I believe I have given no cause. And this I beseech
you heartily, that if ever you find, so long as you live,
a servant more true to you than I, then leave me and
boldly slay me, and I will forgive you all my death.
And if you find no truer man, why will you allow me
to perish thus, and for no type of guilt except my
good desire? As good then be untrue as true.
But to your will I submit my life and death, and with
a fully obedient heart I pray, do with me as is your
pleasure. Much rather had I please you and die than
to think or say anything to offend you at any time.
Therefore, pity my bitter pains, sweet, and of your
grace grant me some drop; for else neither hope nor
happiness may remain with me, nor linger in my
troubled, careworn heart. 

I learn, I teach; 
I study, I preach; 
I compose poems, weave stories, 
Write essays, pen opinions; 
I do research, prepare scientific articles; 
I love nature, music, books, conversing, 
Traveling and roaming; 
Until I also love and be loved
By an equally passionate she, 
Have unalloyed love for HIM, 
And compassion for fellow-beings
I am not a complete man


The Complicated Scam 
I met a man in a bar he was a monk dressed as civilian 
to study the world and he painted me a picture.
How wondrous life was behind wall, a cell each a habit a
and a pair of sandals. Regular meals of the healthy kind
Monks never got diabetes or heart diseases, and the wine
they drank at each meal was home made.
We had another drink followed by more it was closing time
I rose to leave, and he began crying   
He had nowhere to go, he said, what about the cloister, no they 
will not open their doors I drank too much wine and seduced 
A novice. I suggested he should take a photo prostrate in the front
Of our Saviour. He thought that was a good idea, but he had
No camera, I gave him mine -  he was a monk even a fallen one-
I never saw him again, but saw my camera for sale in the window 
of a second-hand shop


Not even a master sculptor 
Could form lips soft as your velvet bows
Curved slightly upwards they unveil
Bright embers of your facial glow.

Not even a famous poet
Could find the words to describe
That special quality about you 
when your smile comes alive.

Not even a concert pianist
Could reach a note as high
Or touch the depth of the emotion
That's contained within your eyes.

Not even a gifted artist
Could uncover with his brush
That special shade that rises
In sweet Jennifer's blush. 

You are a red velvet rose,  
lying on white ivory keys,  
surrounded by black polished wood 
and each notes musical breeze.   

You have warm tender eyes  
with the life of a smile 
and smooth satin limbs 
moving  in a classic elegant style.   

You are soft to the touch;  
yet, your resilient petals are strong,  
a composition of rare feminine Art,  
an allegro introducing a song.   

You are a beautiful chord,  
a sound enticingly new,  
my heart in silence sings to you  
sweet rose covered with dew.  Give me your hand

Make room for me
to lead and follow
you
beyond this rage of poetry.

Let others have
the privacy of
touching words
and love of loss
of love.

For me
Give me your hand. 

A crocodile ruled an African pond; 
Beneath the waters he hid.
During a drought, the animals came, 
All "thirsty, " with their kids.

And while seeking just a little drink
To cool their parching tongue, 
The old croc would launch attacks—
Putting them on the run.

But in the end, fate would change—
The croc would get his due.
The draught won.  The pond dried up.
And his skeleton laid in view. 

Once upon a time there was a mistake
So silly so small
That no one would even have noticed it

It couldn't bear
To see itself to hear of itself

It invented all manner of things
Just to prove
that it didn't really exist

It invented space 
To put its proofs in
And time to keep its proofs
And the world to see its proofs

All it invented
Was not so silly
Nor so small
But was of course mistaken

Could it have been otherwise




Thoughts are powerful.
Such concepts of the mind
Are ever forming images                         
And ideas of every kind.

Thoughts are multipurpose.
Multitasking too.
And here are some things
That they are known to do.

Thoughts make and mold, 
Pierce and console.
They are known to drive.
Unite, or divide.       

Thoughts can destroy, 
And they can create. 
They're used to support, 
Or to debate.  

Thoughts are powerful
And interesting too.
The list could be endless
As to what they can do.

HEALTH WARNING TO GNATS FLYING OVER MT. FUJI

Gnat whines furiously
as it flies over Fuji
outlined against sky.
But that is as far as it goes
squashed now on travel poster. 

Primary ambition-
Earning, spending, loving, rejoicing, leaving everything far behind.
 
Secondry ambition-
Showing, helping, donating, worshipping everything that is blind.

Coclusion-
Both are boring, hurting, devastating, disturbing, and unkind.

Choose something in between, 
In everything balance should be seen. 

You have gone away from my life
But you still inhabit in my heart
When I try to forget you, 
I remember you most. 

I can never be as graceful as a dolphin.

No, I can never ever be.

The fact is as clear as the crystal waters of the Pacific Ocean.

No matter how hard I try 

I always ended up in one corner

And just cry-

Why can I not swim my way to victory? 

Why do I always drown in my own tears? 

I don’t wanna be a laughingstock.

But this is my role in the class.

To provide entertainment

And make myself a complete fool

Floating in that filthy pool.

Today, I’ll never ever forget

This frustration and disappointment

When I decided to give up the fight

And walk away feeling frustrated

Coz I lost the battle when I didn’t even fight.

Tears, tears, tears! 

Stinging my cheeks

Burning my soul 

With too much shame

Now I know

I can never be like them

I’ll just float away

And let the tides carried me away

From this misery and sorrows

Of this frustrated swimmer. 

Where I am lost in transaction of cash, 
Where mobiles ring and the deal is done, 
I know by heart the heart of all pearls
And search always for the back with flaws
With eyes of profit and loss facing
The front.
Too busy, I never learnt to find real time
For me to just be and understand the inner
Meaning of life and the underside of my being, 
Woven to the terror in my mind.
I don't know who I am save bear a business name.
It seems strange almost as strange as I'll be, 
Some day. 

Shall I be left forgotten in the dust
When the flower which has a touch of earth
And no sublime feelings, revives? 
If I'll search for myself, I'll certainly
Find  the rarest of pearl-ME. 

YOUR troubles shrink not, though I feel them less
       Here, far away, than when I tarried near;
     I even smile old smiles--with listlessness--
       Yet smiles they are, not ghastly mockeries mere.

     A thought too strange to house within my brain
       Haunting its outer precincts I discern:
       --That I will not show zeal again to learn
     Your griefs, and, sharing them, renew my pain

     It goes, like murky bird or buccaneer
     That shapes its lawless figure on the main,
     And each new impulse tends to make outflee
     The unseemly instinct that had lodgment here;
     Yet, comrade old, can bitterer knowledge be
     Than that, though banned, such instinct was in me

And hope that we also aren't nearly that way.

we revel in a range of tastes
many very fine and some we know
to be perhaps a little base.
They all have one thing in common
these enjoyments that we partake
they all need something from outside
to fill a need we find inside.
And when fully satisfied
in a deep contentment we then reside
one that we feel was delivered
by the tasty dish that our senses savoured.
That is the error that I spy
Ohh no that’s not it say I.
This contentment, deep satisfaction
Is revealed when we no longer feel
that we lack that which we so much need
to satisfy a whim or lust or greed.
So to be happy give up what you desire
let it burn in the sacrificial fire
and be content.
No longer mixing thoughts of pleasure
with the ever present happiness
that is revealed
when we just let go of what we held. 

While my sad Muse the darkest Covert Sought, 
To give a loose to Melancholy Thought; 
Opprest, and sighing with the Heavy Weight 
Of an Unhappy dear Lov'd Monarch's Fate; 
A lone retreat, on Thames's Brink she found, 
With Murmering Osiers fring'd, and bending Willows Crown'd, 
Thro' the thick Shade cou'd dart no Chearful Ray, 
Nature dwelt here as in disdain of Day: 
Content, and Pleas'd with Nobler Solitude, 

Nor Nests for wanton Birds, the Glade allows; 
Scarce the soft Winds were heard amongst the Boughs. 
While thus She lay resolv'd to tune no more 
Her fruitless Songs on Brittains Faithless Shore, 
All on a suddain thro' the Woods there Rung, 
Loud Sounds of Joy that Jo Peans Sung. 
Maria! Blest Maria! was the Theam, 

The River Nimphs their Crystal Courts forsake, 
Curl their Blew Locks, and Shelly Trumpets take: 

And the surprising News along the Shore, 
In raptur'd Songs the wondring Virgins bore; 
Whilst Mourning Eccho now forgot her Sighs, 
And sung the new taught Anthem to the Skyes. 
All things in Nature, a New Face put on, 
Thames with Harmonious Purlings glides along, 
And tells her Ravisht Banks, she lately bore 
A Prize more great than all her hidden Store, 
Or all the Sun it self e're saw before. 

The brooding Spring, her Fragrant Bloom sent out, 

Scattering her early Perfumes round about; 
No longer waits the Lasie teeming Hours, 
But e're her time produc'd her Oderous Flowers; 
Maria's Eyes Anticipate the May, 
The Muses all upon this Theam Divine, 
Tun'd their best Lays, the Muses all, but mine, 
Sullen with Stubborn Loyalty she lay, 
And saw the World its eager Homage pay, 
While Heav'n and Earth on the new Scene lookt gay. 

But Oh! What Human Fortitude can be 
Sufficient to Resist a Deity? 
Even our Allegiance here, too feebly pleads, 
The Change in so Divine a Form perswades; 
Maria with the Sun has equal Force, 
No Opposition stops her Glorious Course, 
Her pointed Beams thro' all a passage find, 
And fix their Rays Triumphant in the Mind. 
And now I wish'd among the Crouds to Adore, 
And constant wishing did increase my Power; 

From every thought a New-born Reason came 
Which fortifyed by bright Maria's Fame, 
Inspir'd My Genious with new Life and Flame, 
My Muse who never fail'd Obedience yet, 
To pay her Tribute at Marias Feet, 
Maria so Divine a part of You, 
Let me be Just -- but Just with Honour too. 

Resolv'd, She join'd her Chorus with the Throng, 
And to the listning Groves Marias Vertues Sung; 

Maria all Inchanting, Gay, and Young, 
All Hail Illustrious Daughter of a King, 
Shining without, and Glorious all within, 
VVhose Eyes beyond your scantier Power give Laws, 
Command the VVord, and justifie the Cause; 
Nor to secure your Empire needs more Arms 
Than your resistless, and all Conquering Charms; 
Minerva Thus alone, Old Troy Sustain'd, 
But Oh! your Form and Manner to relate, 

The Envying Fair as soon may Imitate, 
'Tis all Engaging Sweet, 'tis all Surprising Great; 
A thousand Beauties Triumph in your Air, 
Like those of soft Young Loves your Smiles appear, 
And to th'Ungarded Hearts, as dangerous are: 
All Natures Charms are open'd in your Face, 
You Look, you Talk, with more than Human Grace; 

All that is Wit, all that is Eloquence. 
The Births of finest Thought and Noblest Sense, 
Easie and Natural from your Language break, 

And 'tis Eternal Musick when you speak; 
Thro' all no formal Nicety is seen, 
But Free and Generous your Majestick Meen, 
All that is Great and Lovely in the Sex, 
Heav'n did in this One Glorious Wonder fix, 
Yet if with Sighs we View that Lovely Face, 
And all the Lines of your great Father's Trace, 

Your Vertues should forgive, while we adore 
That Face that Awes, and Charms our Hearts the more; 
But if the Monarch in your Looks we find, 
Behold him yet more glorious in your Mind; 
A Gratious Sweetness, Affability, 
A Tender Mercy and True Piety; 
And Vertues even sufficient to Attone 
For all the Ills the Ungrateful VVorld has done, 
Where several Factions, several Intrests sway, 
And that is still it'h Right who gains the Day; 
How e're they differ, this they all must grant, 
Your Form and Mind, no One Perfection want, 
Without all Angel, and within all Saint. 

The Murmering World till now divided lay, 
Vainly debating whom they shou'd Obey, 
Till You Great Cesar's Off-spring blest our Isle, 
The differing Multitudes to Reconcile; 
Thus Stiff-neckt Israel in defiance stood, 

Who from the Mount with dazling brightness came, 
And Eyes all shining with Celestial Flame; 
Whose Awful Looks, dispel'd each Rebel Thought, 
And to a Just Compliance, the wilde Nations brought. 

By those soft tods of wool,
With which the air is full;
By all those tinctures there
That paint the hemisphere;
By dews and drizzling rain,
That swell the golden grain;
By all those sweets that be
I'th' flowery nunnery;
By silent nights, and the
Three forms of Hecate;
By all aspects that bless
The sober sorceress,
While juice she strains, and pith
To make her philtres with;
By Time, that hastens on
Things to perfection;
And by your self, the best
Conjurement of the rest;
--O, my Electra!  be
In love with none but me.

IT'S my fear that my wake won't be quiet,
Nor my wake house a silent place :
For who would keep back the hundreds
Who would touch my breast and my face?

For the good men were always my friends,
From Galway back into Clare;
In strength, in sport, and in spending,
I was foremost at the fair;

In music, in song, and in friendship,
In contests by night and by day,
By all who knew it was given to me
That I bore the branch away.

Now let Manus Joyce, my friend
(If he be at all in the place),
Make smooth the boards of the coffin
They will put above my face.

The old men will have their stories
Of all the deeds in my days,
And the young men will stand by the coffin,
And be sure and clear in my praise.

But the girls will stay near the door,
And they'll have but little to say:
They'll bend their heads, the young girls,
And for a while they will pray.

And, going home in the dawning,
They'll be quiet with the boys;
The girls will walk together,
And seldom they'll lift the voice;

And then, between daybreak and dark,
And between the hill and the sea,
Three women, come down from the mountain,
Will raise the keen over me.

But 'tis my grief that I will not hear
When the cuckoo cries in Glenart,
That the wind that lifts when the sails are loosed,
Will never lift my heart. 

An Individual Outlook

I am an individual
A living, breathing cluster of flesh and bone
A bundle of emotions
Joy and happiness
Misery and sadness
My problem is not that millions are stuck in the swamp of misery
I am engrossed with the thought that
Why am I stuck in it? 
Sickness and poverty is global in its magnitude
Yet my tears are only for my being swept away by it
Confined in this body my soul knows only my suffering
How do I know that a being next to me is hurting just as much? 
Society is an abstract I am forced to deal with
I accept communion just as my need
I work towards it only for my own self
If not fruit full I will brush it aside as easily 
As I weed out the lawn to keep it healthy
So is there anything wrong with it
If every one will take care of oneself
We all could be much more happy
Self-reliance is a virtue we all need to cultivate

Now here comes another out look

A Universal Outlook 

We may come and go alone
But we depend on others for our survival
Alone we perish together we thrive
We are part of a whole
Confined in our body 
Our soul is part of this vast cosmic consciousness
Obscure is our vision yet it shines and shimmers
Like water shimmers under rays of sun
An illusion it may be but leaves an impression
Deep enough for us to feel a longing
For this universal consciousness
Some time only way to experience it
Is to feel the pain of others
To wipe somebody’s tears
Ignore your own suffering
To alleviate pain of a grieving heart
To our surprise often 
We help our self in the process
A sense of calm satisfaction
Working like a balm upon our wounded ego
Self-interest in reverse action

This is the secret of our survival
Key to unlock the door of happiness
We have to remind our self constantly
Though we can’t follow the highest ideals
Yet don’t want to become selfish individuals either
There is a middle ground, a middle out look
Just as valid as a dusk or dawn
A small connecting point
For you and I. 

everyday. 
a conscious decision, 
to live with arms outstretched, 

or to run and hide.
to dare to be
what you believe

or to hide in someone else's shadow.
to walk to the edge, 
spread your wings and fly

or to cower in fear in the nest.
to get your hands dirty, 
or to turn the other way

to fall down, and get up, 
or to lie there and quit.
to give unconditionally, 

or to take without remorse.
to speak the truth. 
or to settle for the lie

everyday. 
a conscious decision!(Microscopic)

A speck that would have been beneath my sight
On any but a paper sheet so white
Set off across what I had written there.
And I had idly poised my pen in air
To stop it with a period of ink
When something strange about it made me think,
This was no dust speck by my breathing blown,
But unmistakably a living mite
With inclinations it could call its own.
It paused as with suspicion of my pen,
And then came racing wildly on again
To where my manuscript was not yet dry;
Then paused again and either drank or smelt--
With loathing, for again it turned to fly.
Plainly with an intelligence I dealt.
It seemed too tiny to have room for feet,
Yet must have had a set of them complete
To express how much it didn't want to die.
It ran with terror and with cunning crept.
It faltered: I could see it hesitate;
Then in the middle of the open sheet
Cower down in desperation to accept
Whatever I accorded it of fate.
I have none of the tenderer-than-thou
Collectivistic regimenting love
With which the modern world is being swept.
But this poor microscopic item now!
Since it was nothing I knew evil of
I let it lie there till I hope it slept.

I have a mind myself and recognize
Mind when I meet with it in any guise
No one can know how glad I am to find
On any sheet the least display of mind. 

When I touch the scars of last year's wounds
Really I get a consolation, 
And I think of the next year approaches very soon
Without an invitation? 
Those wounds were healed by the nature
But the new winds who knows? 
May pierce and reunite to make them fresh.
I touch the lonely heart with my palpitate palm
And feel a different beat, 
But I cannot change my sorrowful song friend, 
Though you provide a pleasant music
Because it's my panache.

* The unseaworthy Soulship must be rigged properly to the Windswept.  
[ A diary from the Seabed]A rare fullness describes best
The love which releases utter
Fulfillment, -  love which gives rest.
Searching for wholeness, we can trust
That fate will arrange,  entire
And complete, a right love,  by
Guiding our heart, and firing
Us fully for unqualified
Giving,  achieving this truth
Will consummate total love, 
Which when brimful, conclusive
Yet rounded, is easy to prove. 

A tattered coolie who was born in a leap year that comes home after a strenuous day's work? 
He loves his coquetry daughter.
Her mother has disappeared when she was an infant.
He thinks that he has to make a cordon to protect her from the ruffian the apothecary's son.
His wife eloped through this rickety fence and he is scared of his precious daughter's future.
He dreams one day his daughter goes right of the passage with rituals.
But who knows and how long this skeleton survives with his sing-song

Indulg'd by ev'ry active thought
When upwards they wou'd fly
Nor can Ambition be a fault
If plac'd above the sky 
When humbld first we meekly crave
Remission for the past
We from the fore-tasts which we have
May guesse our Joys at last 

Then let my Contemplation soar
And Heav'n my Subject be
Though low on Earth in nature poor
Some prospect we may see 

And now that scene before me stands
And large Possessions there
Where none usurps anothers Lands {
And Theives we do not fear 

All Care all Sorrow all Surprise
Fly from that World of peace
Where tears are wip'd from clouded Eyes
And Sighs for ever cease 

Decay or Sicknesse find no place
In that untainted Air
But still th'incorruptable Face {
Shall as at first be fair 

Agility in pace or flight
The Blessed shall convey
Where e're the Lamb more fair then light {
Shall lead the radiant way 

Whilst Praises in Seraphick Sounds {
The blisful road shall trace
And musick seem to passe the bounds
Even of unbounded Space 

Such balmy Odours shall disperse
As from the Bridegroom's pores {
The holy Canticles rehearse {
Fell on the Bolts and Doors 

When to his Spouse the well belov'd
More white then Jordans Flocks {
Spake whilest her hand the Barrs remov'd
And dew-drops fill'd his locks 

The Crosse shall there triumphant rise
And ev'ry Eye shall scan
That promis'd Ensign in the skies
Close by the Son of Man 

Which Martirdom adorns
And prostrate lye beneath his feet
My Coronet of Thorns 

For Conscience here opprest
Shall there full retribution find
And none his Claimes molest 

Hypocrisy and feign'd pretence
To cover foul Dissigns
Shall blusshing fly as far from thence
As to the deepest Mines 

We there shall know the use of Foes
Whom here we have forgiven
When we shall thank them for those woes
Which pav'd our way to Heaven 

There all good things that we have mist
With Int'rest shall return
Whilst those who have each wish possest
Shall for that fullnesse mourn 

There Coventry of Tufton's Line {
For piety renown'd
Shall in transcending virtues Shine
And Equally be Crown'd 

Around her shall the Chains be spread
Of Captives she has freed
And ev'ry Mouth that she has fed
Shall testify the deed 

Whilst Scools supplied to mend our youth
Shall on the List be shown
A Daughter and a Mother both
In Her the Church shall own 

The Gospell crosse the seas rehearst
By her diffusive aid
And fifty-thousand pounds dispers'd
Shall there be largely paid 

My Heart by her supporting Love
In all its Cares upheld
For that, to see her Crown improve
With transports shall be fill'd 

From Gratitude what graces flow
What endlesse pleasures spring
From Prayers whilst we remain below
Above whilst Praise we Sing 

And Mammon wert thou well employ'd {
What Mansions might be wonne
Whilst Woolsey's Pallace lyes destroy'd {
And Marlbrough's is not done. { 

Whilst to this Heav'n my Soul Aspires
All Suff'rings here are light
He travells pleas'd who but desires
A Sweet Repose at Night. 

BRAVE flowers--that I could gallant it like you,
     And be as little vain!
You come abroad, and make a harmless show,
     And to your beds of earth again.
You are not proud: you know your birth:
For your embroider'd garments are from earth.

You do obey your months and times, but I
     Would have it ever Spring:
My fate would know no Winter, never die,
     Nor think of such a thing.
O that I could my bed of earth but view
And smile, and look as cheerfully as you!

O teach me to see Death and not to fear,
     But rather to take truce!
How often have I seen you at a bier,
     And there look fresh and spruce!
You fragrant flowers! then teach me, that my breath
Like yours may sweeten and perfume my death. 

A crowd of people were staring 
At the cold dead body 
That was lying in the street. 

Cops and cars, cars and cops, 
Cops and cars and more cars and cops 
Were all over. 
And the light from the police cars 
That was blinking 
Made the scene look like 
some kind of bistro. 

He was so young, 
the dead man on the floor 
And I thought life was too short for him, 
To die at this age. 
I'd no idea where he lived, 
no idea what he did 
But something in his face 
Seemed innocent and saintlike. 

Suddenly, 
A question formed in my mind 
And I shot it to the crowd, 
saying 'Why? ' 
'Why did they shoot him? ' 
I asked 
But no one answered, 
They just stared at me 
And turned their faces back to the dead body. 
Their look was so scary. 

But then-, 
'Maybe they think the world 
Is a better place, ' 
An old woman said, 
'Without him.'

 gentle contentment invades my heart, 
And begins a start toward peace.
Changes dull mood, lightens my mind, reaches
Down into my soul, parting
Me from previous darkness, and it spreads
Deep happiness, wraps smiles of bright
Colour around my day, holds me tightly
In it's spell as it readys me
For love, which I know will increase and flood
My cold blood, giving me ardour
From which until now I've been locked and barred.
Gentle contentment feels lovely. 

It seems for so many years
I've lived my life for someone else
I put my feelings and needs
Away somewhere on a shelf

I always put my children first
Their needs ahead of my own
I had to look out for them
Until they were grown

Taking care of them
Was like a full time job
But it didn't feel like work
Although, at times it was so hard

I was always there for them
That, they always knew
They knew that Mom would help them
To always make it through

As the years passed they slowly changed
They gradually started to grow
Along the way they had to learn
Because there was so much they didn't know

But hopefully they listened
As I guided them along the way
Because the day will come
When they to will be parents themselves one day

You may think I gave a lot
Because true love never found it's way to me
But I didn't care and it didn't matter
Because my kids were my world to me

The day will come
When they are grown
They'll move on
To live out on their own

Then that's the time
When I will see
If true love
Was meant for me

If true love never finds me
And I have no one to call my own
I know that what I'll leave behind
Will be my kids, and they were home grown


  And still as oft I thrust it back;
Thy messengers I could not see
  In those who everything did lack,
  The poor, the outcast and the black.

Pride held his hand before mine eyes,
  The world with flattery stuffed mine ears;
I looked to see a monarch's guise,
  Nor dreamed thy love would knock for years,
  Poor, naked, fettered, full of tears.

Yet, when I sent my love to thee,
  Thou with a smile didst take it in,
And entertain'dst it royally,
  Though grimed with earth, with hunger thin,
  And leprous with the taint of sin.

Now every day thy love I meet,
  As o'er the earth it wanders wide,
With weary step and bleeding feet,
  Still knocking at the heart of pride
  And offering grace, though still denied. 

Look how the sun rises and sets, 
Earth becomes heaven where man lives; 
It is man who gets and forgets; 

Roses bloom and nightingales sing, 
Rivers run, their waves fall and rise; 
It is man, only takes and dies.

It is man who has made the law
and has destroyed everyone's peace.
If you look, you will find no flaw


A Poet does not fear death
A Poet must use his pen, his breath
To tell the truth about humanity
Freedom, brotherhood and liberty.

If you are afraid to tell it like it is
My friend, you are not yet a Poet
You are indeed a sheepish puppet
Who stands to beg and to please.

A Poet is, by definition, controversial

A Poet always plays the most adept role
For he understands the tricks, and the ruses.

A Poet shall not be labeled as a Communist, 
Leftist, Centrist, Capitalist or Rightist
A Poet will not die, a Poet will not lie
Listen to the drumbeats which mourn and sigh.

A Poet will never, never, never die
He will forever live in the strong mind
Of the youth, in the eyes of the blind
And in the tears of the children who cry.

A Poet knows no race, no color, and no boundary
When it comes to helping men and women
Of this earth. A Poet fights for unity and liberty
All men and women are equal under the sun.

A Poet will live in the Heaven forever
In the saliva of the poor and the wounded
In the heart of the forgotten and the stranded
And in the holy soul of the destitute pauper.

If you are a Poet, neutralize the oppressors
Tell them to go rot and burn in Hell
Tell them that they belong in jail
Our people are resilient survivors.

If you are a Poet, stand for what is right
Stand with the weak, the sick and the powerless
Oh! Comrade, you have been fearless and priceless
For our people who will never be afraid to fight.

Death is a reward for the proud, and the brave
Liberty or death, our people will never, never die
Nobody can kill our dreams. The son of the slave
Is forever free to roam, to speak out and to cry.

Brother, in spite of your complexion, you are one of us
Because you understand our struggle, our plight, and our pain
Brother, you are a Poet, a warrior who defeated bigots, thugs
Racists, tyrants; many thanks, you did not fight in vain.

A Poet is more powerful and creative than you can imagine
A Poet is not afraid being controversial and strangely targeted
A Poet will defend the sick, the destitute and the wounded
A Poet will give away, for the right causes, his heart, soul and spleen.

A Poet is proud and brave
The progeniture of the slave
Will never, never lie
The Hero will never die.


I've sometimes wished that Ingersoll were wise
To hold his tongue, nor rail against the skies;
For when he's made a point some pious dunce
Like Bartlett of the _Bulletin_ 'replies.'

I brandish no iconoclastic fist,
Nor enter the debate an atheist;
Why Bartlett, then, is suffered to exist.

Even infidels that logic might resent,
Saying: 'There's no place for his punishment
That's worse than earth.' But humbly I submit
That he would make a hell wherever sent. 

heart felt what to say
mind fetched the words carefully
voice just spoke it out


Death you are going to die
You have ravished our hearts and compelled us to cry
Death you are going to die
You have strangled our loved ones and made us ask why

Death you are going to die
Evil enemy of existence-it's no lie
Death you are going to die
Slimy servant of sin-your doom is very nigh

Death you are going to die
Your last breath is imminent -this you can't deny
Death you are going to die
Buried forever-never to open your eye

Death you are going to die
No one will mourn you destruction nor even sigh
Death you are going to die
Bid sadness farewell-kiss separation good bye

Death you are going to die
You are your final fatality-my, my, my
Death you are going to die
No more clouds of sadness-perpetual fair blue sky

Death you are going to die
Your ugly head will be crushed by Someone on high
Death you are going to die
 
Death you are going to die
Celebration time-the saints are ready to fly
Death you are going to die
Joy and life forever in the sweet bye and bye


Alone, am I in this darkened place.
Alone, as I group, search, for a ray of light.

Alone, as the black of night, blankets
all traces of humanity.

Alone, with the only sound I hear, is the
beating of my heart.

Alone, as slowly, panic grips me, with the
harsh reality of oneness.

Alone, as my mind.  

I, attempt to leave this
prison of darkness, silence and uncertainty.

Alone, as perspiration breaks my skin, and
I slowly contemplate, what if it all ends here? Now.

Alone, panicked, I attempt to recall prayers learned

No! 
Not that one! I need another! Something more contrite! 

Alone, desperately, I search the jumbled memories
of youth. Where.  

where is that special prayer I
need? Dammit, where is it! Ahhhh.  

for the loss of temper. I'm just a bit upset.
Since I'm talking to you, I need to be honest.
I'm scared! Yes.  

yes I believe in you. I want to
be at your side.  

but I just don't want to die to
do it.

Alone, and I did it again! I know I made Him angry, with
that type of dialog.

Alone, and I'm thinking, this catholic up bringing, is
tuff on a guy. If one doesn't do what He wants, 
bingo, you go to hell! I try to be a good guy, however, 
sometime I slip. Then I think, what the hell am I
going to do, to make up for that! 

Alone, and I'm now talking directly to Him! What.  

do
I really expect, an answer? 

Alone, and I am now on the verge on being certifiably, mad! 

Alone, I gotta hang on here. Calm myself. Think. Think! 

Alone, I take a long, deep breath.  

and let it out. There, 
that's better.

Alone. What's that! A noise? A voice? What? 

Alone, as a silent, hallowed voice, breaks the
eerie stillness. 'You.  

you there in the darkness.'

Alone, as I think, no! No Way! That voice is not
speaking to me! 

Alone, as my heart is beating like a trip hammer. I
wait.  

maybe the voice was just my imagination.
Then, the voice, again. This time louder! 
'What do you mean, am I talking to you? It
must be you. Are you not the only on there in
the darkness? '

Alone.  

oh shit, I'm not alone! He's here! 
The voice responds, ' I don't think we need
the 'oh shit' part.

Alone.  

as I swallow hard. Trembling I ask, 
'What.  

what do you want? '
'I want to help you, ' the hallowed voice responds.

Alone, and I'm thinking, Good, that's good, He's not
mad at me. My voice trembles, as I respond, 
'What do you want me to do? How.  

how are
you gonna help me? '

Alone, as I wait for a reply, for what seems to be
and eternity. Then, I hear His voice.
'I can tell you how to never be in the dark
again. Would you like that? '

Alone.  

darkness, forget that stuff. He's here
to help me! All of a sudden the world is
right! He's gonna help me! As I blurt out, 
'Thank you! Thank you! Yes, please tell
me, how to rid this darkness now
and forever! '

'You promise to do as I ask.'

Alone, I anxiously, I reply. 'Yes, anything! '

'You will never be in the dark again. If
you do this one thing.'


He hesitated, and than spoke. 'If you
want to rid the darkness in your life, 
then pay your electric bill, you putz! '


And that thing you said, 
did you really mean to be, 
so very, very mean and hurtful? 
And to offend in such a deep defence, 
and when I’m feeling down, 
why, so it seems, do you want
to kick my very soul, 
and bruise my sensibilities
with hateful speech.

You say that’s all you know, 
and how you have survived, 
a life scarred with unkindness.
Encountered of so many kinds
that you lost count and lost sight, 
of the kind of man you really are.
My dearest friend, 
locked inside a mind with
bitter experience, the label on its jar.

But then I do like talking to myself; 
sometimes. 

They had a cook with them who stood alone For boiling chicken with a marrow-bone, Sharp flavouring powder and a spice for savour. He could distinguish London ale by flavour, And he could roast and boil and seethe and fry, Make good thick soup and bake a tasty pie.  As for blancmange, he made it with the best. 

The ship -cook was tired it had been a long day, the ship was old 
full of cockroaches, one had found its way in his bread dough and 
when the captain cut a slice of bread it was there, a brown raisin; 
the old man had been very angry. The cook’s trouble was roaches 
they were everywhere. He had asked to have the galley fumigated
 when the ship was in dry dock, but no it was far too expensive. 
Every week he boiled a big pan of water and squirted into corners, 
 it helped a bit and he had buckets full, but soon they were back 
encroaching his galley. Then there were mites in the flour which 
he had to sift before baking bread, not his fault yet he had to take 
the flack. He often worked till late evening to keep the galley clean 
he had even painted it so on the surface it looked bright and nice.
 He was losing the battle against insects he often felt he was losing 
his mind as well, they appeared in his dreams strangulating him. 
Time was hard not easy to get a job, still when his ship docked in 
Bombay he was off and the crew could get someone else to insult. 

At a hermitage:

    A cool fall night--
getting dinner, we peeled
    eggplants, cucumbers.
 



Large shadows loomed
On my heart
I was unable
To dispel the gloom

After loosing my love
Utterly
A blood of despair 
Filled the room

Abruptly 
A sunflower came
Removed
The horrible 
Sense of doom

Casting the rays of hope 
On my heart 
Everywhere
Roses in bloom

When she smiles
Coquettishly
My heart begins to beat
With a soundless boom




I am a poor fisherman
And the eyes of my net are too big
Even a Whale could easily jumps
And my tumbledown boat isn't seaworthy
Just rests on the polluted beach.
It's totally an off season for fishing
And the rough waves are surfing.
I lit the half burned candle
in my shaky hut.
And I pray the cruel wind
Give me a sound sleep.
The fishmongers are jealous of you
Being a beautiful Virgin
And they gossip a lot in the marketplace.
A friend of mine who mends the nets
And the friendly Sea Gulls too
Told me that you're pink of color.
I call you Pinky! 
Though it's a risky journey
If you could drift with the waves
Towards my neglected solitary Harbor
I can wait in standing my whole life for you
Like a lonesome Lighthouse! 

*To my Life-school Art Teacher, the poetess Sandra Fowler in gratitude

WITH HIS SONGS AND HER DAYS TO HIS LADY AND TO LOVE

Violets and leaves of vine,
Into a frail, fair wreath
We gather and entwine:
A wreath for Love to wear,
Fragrant as his own breath,
To crown his brow divine,
All day till night is near.
Violets and leaves of vine
We gather and entwine.

Violets and leaves of vine
For Love that lives a day,
We gather and entwine.
All day till Love is dead,
Till eve falls, cold and gray,
These blossoms, yours and mine,
Love wears upon his head,
Violets and leaves of vine
We gather and entwine.

Violets and leaves of vine,
For Love when poor Love dies
We gather and entwine.
This wreath that lives a day
Over his pale, cold eyes,
Kissed shut by Proserpine,
At set of sun we lay:
Violets and leaves of vine
We gather and entwine. 

The angry, glaring sunlight had left for the day.
The air had a soothing chill and a soft breeze was blowing-
Night was fast approaching in all its splendour, 
With a halo of glimmering moonlight, 
Ripe, mature, in full bloom, 
Holding out promise of joys and pleasures
Still not experienced, 
Only fantasized about


The party was on in full swing-
And there I was, shuffling around uneasily, 
Dressed as per the prescribed code-
Talking, smiling, and eating politely
Playing silly games as per the host's instructions; 
Liquor was being served freely and in abundance; 
The music played on, loud and lively- 
Finally it was over and we could leave-

The hostess of the evening stood near the door
Sipping from a goblet of red wine.
We said goodbye-
Smiling, running her fingers through her long, silky, black hair with practiced sophistication, she turned around and went back to the party-
The stragglers watched and cheered
As she raised her glass to her lips and downed the remaining dregs 
Of the heady drink of Liberty and Freedom-When the corrupt politician 
was shut behind the bars, 
he roared in anger in a language
couched in figures and metaphors: 
" From the cremains of my body, 
one thousand of me will be erupting
to serve the cause of the people".

When this one robber single-handedly
looted the coffers of the State
and got graft for the jobs given to the poor, 
the people reel in poverty 
and the youths die untimely.
"How could this nation face 
one thousand of his incarnates? "
This question made one of his followers
sleepless, and in a frenzied mood, 
he slit his leader's throat
and cried aloud for his suicide, 
saving the judges from the strains
of bending the laws  to give him bail.


'With warmth for your severe winter', you said.
And every snowflake from my landscape fled.
I felt the sun from half a world away
Touch my skin with your autograph that day.

Regret echoes back to you on the air.
Love and remembrance, Friend, we both must bear.
Although I knew the poem was no more, 
Your solace healed my being to the core.

Stanzas have gone into that atmosphere
In which two songsmiths held each other dear.
Yet somewhere our cosmos is burning bright, 
Like Oriental candles against night.

And heard the waves breaking:
They came to meet us with candles alight
To show the path we were taking.
A myrtle, trained on the gate, was white
With tufted flowers down shaking.

With head beneath her wing,
A little wren was sleeping
So near, I had found it an easy thing
To steal her for my keeping
From the myrtle bough that with easy swing
Across the path was sweeping.

Down rocky steps rough-hewed,
Where cup-mosses flowered,
And under the trees, all twisted and rude,
Wherewith the dell was dowered,
They led us, where deep in its solitude
Lay the cottage, leaf-embowered.

The thatch was all bespread
With climbing passion flowers;
They were wet, and glistened with raindrops,
shed
That day in genial showers.
'Was never a sweeter nest,' we said,
'Than this little nest of ours.'

We laid us down to sleep:
But as for me—waking,
I marked the plunge of the muffled deep
On its sandy reaches breaking;
For heart joyance doth sometimes keep
From slumber, like heart-aching.

And I was glad that night,
With no reason ready,
To give my own heart for its deep delight,
That flowed like some tidal eddy,
Or shone like a star that was rising bright
With comforting radiance steady.

But on a sudden—hark!
Music struck asunder
Those meshes of bliss, and I wept in the dark,
So sweet was the unseen wonder;
So swiftly it touched, as if struck at a mark
The trouble that joy kept under.

I rose—the moon outshone:
I saw the sea heaving,
And a little vessel sailing alone,
The small crisp wavelet cleaving;
'T was she as she sailed to her port unknown—
Was that track of sweetness leaving.

We know they music made
In heaven, ere man's creation;
It dropt with lamentation,
And ever since cloth its sweetness shade
With sighs for its first station.

Its joy suggests regret—
Its most for more is yearning;
And it brings to the soul that its voice hath met,
No rest that cadence learning,
But a conscious part in the sighs that fret
Its nature for returning.

O Eve, sweet Eve! methought
When sometimes comfort winning,
As she watched the first children's tender sport,
Sole joy born since her sinning,
If a bird anear them sang, it brought
The pang as at beginning.

While swam the unshed tear,
Her prattlers little heeding,
Would murmur, 'This bird, with its carol clear,
When the red clay was kneaden,
Sang to him thus in Eden.'

The moon went in—the sky
And earth and sea hiding,
I laid me down, with the yearning sigh
Of that strain in my heart abiding;
I slept, and the barque that had sailed so nigh
In my dream was ever gliding.

I slept, but waked amazed,
With sudden noise frighted,
And voices without, and a flash that dazed
My eyes from candles lighted.
'Ah! surely,' methought, 'by these shouts
upraised,
Some travellers are benighted.'

A voice was at my side—'
Waken, madam, waken!
The long prayed-for ship at her anchor doth
ride.
Let the child from its rest be taken,
For the captain doth weary for babe and for
bride—
Waken, madam, waken!

'The home you left but late,
He speeds to it light-hearted;
By the wires he sent this news, and straight
To you with it they started.'
O joy for a yearning heart too great,
O union for the parted!

We rose up in the night,
The morning star was shining;
We carried the child in its slumber light
Out by the myrtles twining:
Orion over the sea hung bright,
And glorious in declining.

Mother, to meet her son,
Smiled first, then wept the rather;
And wile, to bind up those links undone,
And cherished words to gather,
And to show the face of her little one,
That had never seen its father.

That cottage in a chine,
We were not to behold it;
But there may the purest of sunbeams shine,
May freshest flowers enfold it,
For sake of the news which our hearts must
twine
With the bower where we were told it.

Now oft, left lone again,
Sit mother and sit daughter,
And bless the good ship that sailed over the
main,
And the favouring winds that brought her;
While still some new beauty they fable and
feign
For the cottage by the water. 

A Counterfeit -  a Plated Person - 
I would not be - 
Whatever strata of Iniquity
My Nature underlie - 
Truth is good Health -  and Safety, and the Sky.
How meagre, what an Exile -  is a Lie,
And Vocal -  when we die -What is the song the children sing,
When doorway lilacs bloom in Spring,
And the Schools are loosed, and the games are played
That were deadly earnest when Earth was made?
Hear them chattering, shrill and hard,
After dinner-time, out in the yard,
As the sides are chosen and all submit
To the chance of the lot that shall make them "It

"
(Singing) 
"Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!

Catch a nigger by the toe!

(If he hollers let him go!)

Eenee, Meenee. Mainee, Mo!

You-are-It!"

Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, and Mo
Were the First Big Four of the Long Ago,
When the Pole of the Earth sloped thirty degrees,
And Central Europe began to freeze,
And they needed Ambassadors staunch and stark
To steady the Tribes in the gathering dark:
But the frost was fierce and flesh was frail,
So they launched a Magic that could not fail.
(Singing) 
"Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!

Hear the wolves across the snow!

Some one has to kill 'em--so

Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo

Make--you--It!"

Slow ly the Glacial Epoch passed,
Central Europe thawed out at last;
And, under the slush of the melting snows
The first dim shapes of the Nations rose.
Rome, Britannia, Belgium, Gaul--
Flood and avalanche fathered them all;
And the First Big Four, as they watched the mess,
Pitied Man in his helplessness.
(Singing)
 "Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!

Trouble starts When Nations grow,

Some one has to stop it--so

Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!

Make-you-It!"

Thus it happened, but none can tell
What was the Power behind the spell--
Fear, or Duty, or Pride, or Faith--
That sent men shuddering out to death--
To cold and watching, and, worse than these,
Work, more work, when they looked for ease--
To the days discomfort, the nights despair,
In the hope of a prize that they never could share,
(Singing) 
"Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!

Man is born to Toil and Woe.

One will cure another--so

Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo

Make--you--It!"

Once and again, as the Ice went North
The grass crept up to the Firth of Forth.
Once and again, as the Ice came South
The glaciers ground over Lossiemouth.
But, grass or glacier, cold or hot,
The men went out who would rather not,
And fought with the Tiger, the Pig and the Ape,
To hammer the world into decent shape.
(Singing)
 "Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!

What's the use of doing so?


But Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo

Make-us-It!"

Nothing is left of that terrible rune
But a tag of gibberish tacked to a tune
That ends the waiting and settles the claims
Of children arguing over their games;
For never yet has a boy been found
To shirk his turn when the turn came round;
Nor even a girl has been known to say
"If you laugh at me I shan't play

"
For-- 
 "Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo,

(Don't you let the grown-ups know!)

You may hate it ever so,

But if you're chose you're bound to go,

When Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo

Make-you-It!"I took a little drive one day
Out in the country where I live
The peace I felt as I drove along
Showed my world had much to give

I saw a windmill operating
The way a windmill should
I looked at the cliffs that loomed above
From a place I’ve often stood

I drove on down the road a ways
And there before my eyes
A schoolhouse broken into pieces
I guess that’s not a surprise

For time has lost the battle
With structures built long ago
Nothing can last forever
This schoolhouse shows it so

Over there was once a homestead
Several families once lived within
It served to house many lifetimes
It’s usefulness now dim

Then there it was, that famous barn
Blood red is the amazing color
It’s quite a landmark, you know
For uniqueness there is no other

Did you ever think about the beauty
You find driving out in the country? 
I can’t think of any way
To spend a day more peacefully

A Country for old Men 

I have been into town bought a paper and drank a beer, 
in the cafe where the old men sit in the afternoon shade.
I feel more at ease here amongst other wrinklies. 
On the other side of the road, near the pharmacy, 
the big clock on the wall tells us it’s five and the temp is 
Celsius, but in the shade and with a breeze blowing 
it feels fine. In a few years the big clock will tell us that 
time is up, but others will come and take our place. 
There is a vast pool of us in deaths ante room; we are 
but tiny ants on a window pane so easily squashed by  
a child’s thumb. I sit in the shed, see how cigarette smoke 
spirals up and out before dissipating in still hot air, and 
thought of the silent sighs I heard when a beautiful girl 
walked past our cafe. We shall never possess anything 
as lovely again. 

You don’t have to go to the dale
To find her playing with a butterfly; 
She would hide from you
As she is young and shy; 

You can’t see her among trees and bushes
For she does not stay in a place; 
Just track down her in fields
On her head she has done a new lace; 

She may be on the hill, sitting on stone
And staring at the sky in a pensive mood; 
She has been going there to watch
The flitting clouds since her childhood; 

Yonder at the edge of dale you can see
Her squatting by the river side playing; 
With sands, snails and pebbles
Watching the boats as they go down gliding; 

Sometimes I watch her lithely tread 
The narrow paths across the desolate field; 
Her eyes looking for someone
Where the green crops wild flowers yield; 

She is lost in herself and wanders through
Vales, forests, hills and hot desert; 
Singing, dancing, laughing and murmuring
No one knows what is in her heart; 

Sometimes they think she has met
Someone somewhere in those lonely lands; 
Who fell in love with her and promised
To return and would ask her for her hands;After I finished my handicraft
We'll go together full of apples in the basket.
The far away isolated park where a bench is alone since last year.
A year has passed but you are still stuck in the town.
You have forgotten my address and at least a single line to say hello! 
I know that you are busy in the ruined Manor among the maid servants.
She is sixty two and still a spinster. 

While knitting woolen booties for my infant twin brothers
Grandma prompts; 
'Hey! My little needle
You are a big girl
And wear a bra now.
I could read ther secret heart
Through your talking eyes.
Don't idle in the fields
And bring home nettles.
Keep in touch with the Sunday School
And learn some miracle prayers.
World is big like a Watermelon, 
You are an Ant; Not an Elephant
River beneath the singing Mountain is really deep honey
And beware of Piranha! '

* To Aisha, a shy year-old Afghan woman who was sentenced by Taliban commander to have her nose and ears cut off for fleeing her abusive in-laws. 

A bird that I don't know,
Hunched on his light-pole like a scarecrow,
Looks sideways out into the wheat
The wind waves under the waves of heat.
The field is yellow as egg-bread dough
Except where (just as though they'd let
It live for looks) a locust billows
In leaf-green and shade-violet,
A standing mercy.
The bird calls twice, "Red clay, red clay";
Or else he's saying, "Directly, directly

"
If someone came by I could ask,
Around here all of them must know --
And why they live so and die so --
Or why, for once, the lagging heron
Flaps from the little creek's parched cresses
Across the harsh-grassed, gullied meadow
To the black, rowed evergreens below.
They know and they don't know.
To ask, a man must be a stranger --
And asking, much more answering, is dangerous;
Asked about it, who would not repent
Of all he ever did and never meant,
And think a life and its distresses,
Its random, clutched-for, homefelt blisses,
The circumstances of an accident?
The farthest farmer in a field,
A gaunt plant grown, for seed, by farmers,
Has felt a longing, lorn urbanity
Jailed in his breast; and, just as I,
Has grunted, in his old perplexity,
A standing plea.
From the tar of the blazing square
The eyes shift, in their taciturn
And unavowing, unavailable sorrow.
Yet the intonation of a name confesses
Some secrets that they never meant
To let out to a soul; and what words would not dim
The bowed and weathered heads above the denim
Or the once-too-often washed wash dresses?
They are subdued to their own element.
One day
The red, clay face
Is lowered to the naked clay;
After some words, the body is forsaken
The shadows lengthen, and a dreaming hope
Breathes, from the vague mound, Life;
From the grove under the spire
Stars shine, and a wandering light
Is kindled for the mourner, man.
The angel kneeling with the wreath
Sees, in the moonlight, graves. 

The path of mossy ground nestled
In between maternal hedgerows, 
That overgrew atop, dimming down
The brilliance of the day. 
Embosomed, a calm-cool vision –
Abstract takes of nature, in
Leaf-spattered green shades; 
Stem-speckled brown hues; 
Shards of sunlight percolating
Through the random flaws to
Up glittering sprites upon the leaves.

And avian chatter bounced along the burrow, 
Smattered by the crosstalk 
Of busybody insects; 
But outside the green comfort zone, 
Other worlds of other sounds of other life
Otherwise gave a hint of 
Other dozy goings on.

Hawthorn filled the air, 
Filled the nose, 
Filled the head –
Pungency had overpowered all –
Gave the late-spring-early-summer haze.

Here and there a break of colour: 
Odd bluebells – escapees from nearby woods –
Blue-blushing bell faces glancing down, 
Aware of their erectness in the stem; 
The flaming wing of red admirals 
Broke through a hedge hole to
Break up the calm backdrop, 
While flitting blue tits gave
To greater-bodied animation.

Nature’s warm narration – 
The undertones of life.

Have you ever taken a trip
That you just cannot forget? 
No matter where you travel
This place was truly a hit

Well, that’s the way it was
While driving to Hitchcock
On that country red dirt road
Such peacefulness I got

Open fields along the way
Cattle gazed right at me
A lonely bull out in a field
Seeing what there was to see

Wildflowers with such charm 
The air so fresh and pure
Yep, whatever ails you, friend
This could possibly be the cure

So if someday you find 
You can’t seem to get a grip
Hop into your vehicle
And take a country trip

I've got a couple more years on you, baby.  

that's all. 
I've had more chances to fly and more places to fall. 
And it ain't that I'm wiser.  
It's only that I've spent more time with my back to the wall. 
And I've picked up a couple more years on you, baby.. that's all. 

I've walked a couple more roads than you, baby.  

that's all. 
And I'm tired of runnin' while you're only learning to crawl. 
And you're headin somewhere.  
But I've been to somewhere.  and found it was nowhere at all. 
And I've picked up a couple of years on you baby.  that's all. 

Now sayin' goodbye, girl don't never come easy at all. 
But you've got to fly 'cuz you're hearin' those young eagles call. 
And someday when you're older, you'll smile at a man strong and tall. 
And you'll say I've got a couple more years on you, baby.  that's all. 

I've got a couple more years on you baby.  that's all. 
You'll say I've had more chances to fly and more places to fall. 
It ain't that I'm wiser.  
It's only that I've spent more time with my back to the wall. 
And I've picked up a couple more years on you baby.  that's all. 

There was an old man who had cats, 
Those cats were fat and usually ate rats.
The cats chased the old man, 
Right into the room fan.
No more old man, but the reign of cats.

There was a time with unusual crime, 
One robbed a bank while he only used mime.
No one understood it, 
But some still used it.
I guess that they never ate thyme.


Is the sad tale of many a human heart. 

I met a bear on a city roadside accidentally.
'Don't get frightened that I know Men sing well
And I would like to hear a song from your deep voice.'
The bear told in a friendly manner.
' It's mighty dark for me to travel*
Oh! The beautiful bears are our friends
That reminds us in the book of History.
Hardly I carry this honeycomb with bees in my childhood old satchel.
I am sorry, it could be melt now as my poor heart is warm like an autumnal breeze.'
Bear showed me a wry smile and I realized that sniffed I am an Alcoholic.
I saw some bruises on my back and that could be the touch of bear's claws, 
But it's not painful.
The scenario resembles my precious grandson's lost 'Teddy bear' in this cryptic homeward dream.
(*'Bill Monroe with Jim & Jesse')  

[ I am not worthy to loosen the thongs of his sandals.-A humble prayer-]

I dedicate this poem to baby Adam and I am sure that one day you understand this unseen old silly man's dream. 

I was twenty one and she was sixteen, 
My fiancee was a beauty that is still unseen, 
Every girl is pretty in her lovely teens, 
See her images if you have aesthetic screens.

Yes, now that girl is sweet sixty one
Still, she is singular and next to none, 
Was it possible not to become a poet so romantic? 
Is it possible for me not to remain still aesthetic? 

Time veered and snatched those lovely charms.  
Grand Mother still has her golden arms, 
For pretty Grand Children she is a garland, 
For the too old love she is a casual rand.

Life was nothing but song and dance, 
I can never forget that courtship and romance, 
If that year from my life I subtract, 
But why should I it's still intact.

Still I have something black and white, 
A courtship's snap my too old write, 
Whenever frustrated I look at the lit, 
Her smiling photograph, I still owe it.

(Her black and white photograph is still a source of inspiration)There was a verdant pasture somewhere
Whose land was the very picture of beauty

How can the beauty of that elegance be described
Brooks of sparkling water were running on every side

Many were the pomegranate trees
And so were the shady peepul trees

Cool breeze flowed everywhere
Birds were singing everywhere

A goat arrived at a brook's bank from somewhere
It came browsing from somewhere in the nearby land

As she stopped and looked around
She noticed a cow standing by

The goat first presented her compliments to the cow
Then respectfully started this conversation

'How are you! Madam Cow'? 
The cow replied, 'Not too well

'My life is a mere existence
My life is a complete agony

My life is in danger, what can I say? 
My luck is bad, what can I say? 

I am surprised at the state of affairs
I am cursing the evil people

The poor ones like us are powerless
Misfortunes surround the ones like us

None should nicely deal with Man

He murmurs if my milk declines
He sells me if my weight declines

He subdues us with cleverness! 
Alluring, he always subjugates us! 

I nurse his children with milk
I give them new life with milk

My goodness is repaid with evil

Having heard the cow's story like this
The goat replied, 'This complaint is unjust

Though truth is always bitter
I shall speak what is fair

This pasture, and this cool breeze
This green grass and this shade

Such comforts, were beyond our lot! 
They were a far cry for us speechless poor! 

We owe these pleasures to Man
We owe all our happiness to Man

We derive all our prosperity from him
What is better for us, freedom or bondage to him? 

Hundreds of dangers lurk in the wilderness

We are heavily indebted to him
Unjust is our complaint against him

If you appreciate the life's comforts
You would never complain against Man'

Hearing all this the cow felt embarrassed
She was sorry for complaining against Man

She mused over the good and the bad
And thoughtfully she said this

'Small though is the body of the goat
Convincing is the advice of the goat! 'My village is full of greenery..
Very beautiful independent houses.
Surrounded by a garden of vegetables, 
Near are the fields, 
And opposite is a river.
I just went out, 
Unknowing of the cow dung pit.
Which was preserved for some purpose.

Fell into the pit of cow dung
After falling what can happen. 
Nothing I was fully covered by cow dung.
I could see many laughing.
And making fun of me.
I can get angry too.
And I may  feel like doing funny things in anger too.
Any way, I fell down
Why not to take a handful of cow dung, 
and throw on the people
who are laughing and mocking at me.
Such thoughts can come to mind also.

Imagine each things you throw on others, 
Its actually hitting you twice.
And then a time will come, 
When you will repent.
So this way its hitting twice.
And not necessary you may get, 
a chance ever to tell sorry.
This guilt will pull you down.

But.  
I don't want to do any such stupid things.
There was no choice left.
Go and have a beautiful wash.
Went to the village river.
And took a deep dive.
And came out with purity.

If I could pure my mind, 
of all the dirts and filths, 
which it was covered with, 
by Just having a confession, 
And come out with purity.

Then every day, 
I will take a deep dive into the river, 
And come out with purity.

It doesn't mean I will
Keep on doing mistakes
And keep on going for confessions.

I will take a deep dive into the river.
Taking a deep dive
Means I will keep my mind pure from all devil thoughts.



I pat
the cow.

The cow
drops a cow pat.

I never
pet or pat

another cow

again
.  

ever. 

You know, I wouldn’t mind if I
Were living in a cow kind of world
Green grass and red dirt roads
A sky overhead with cloudy swirls

Just eating and having little chats
You don’t have a single care
Life is gentle and relaxing
At least no problems you’re aware

Following one another sometimes
Like to the shade or out of the rain
Or to the grain trough or pile of hay
They always want the very same

Moms and aunts share in calf-sittin’
While the babies take a little snooze
Everyone getting along it seems
Don’t feel they have a thing to lose

Yes, I think it would be a good life
If in my next time around I was hurled
Into the life that seems quite satisfying
In a comforting cow kind of world

A cow was tied to a peg
But allowed to go on its legs.
Its rope moved in cycle.
It grazed inside this circle, 

More grass was available, 
Beyond this limited circle, 
But the rope in motion
Laid the line of its action.

In the place of this cow, 
One’s life also fits in how? 
Life is tethered to an object
That controls the subject.

How many have the courage, 
Or, more strength at any age, 
To break this stale bondage
That shackles at every stage? 

An opportunity comes once
In one’s life, by chance.
If it’s missed by an error, 
Then, it’s lost forever. 

I know I can’t 
make 
you stay
but where 
is your 
heart 

You left me 
when I needed 
you most
why couldn’t you 
have just stayed 
just to help
if even for 
just 
one night

I know I could have 
tried to fight
to make you 
stay

I shouldn't have 
to fight 
for you to be 
at my side
for it makes 
me realize 
you are not 
who I 
thought you 
were

I no longer 
want you 
at my side
is it that hard 
for you 
to understand 

I was not 
complete

I am now 

I am independent 
on my own

I am no longer afraid 
to walk 
this world 
alone

I am no longer afraid 
to keep living 

I am always
awake or afraid
asleep or be dead

I asked you 
before 
where is you 
heart
for mine was 
with you 
now it is not

I should not have 
to fight 
to get you 
to love me
so now 
it is not 
you
I want now 
at my side

I no longer want 
anyone 
at my side

I am no longer afraid 
to walk this world 
alone

I am no longer afraid 
to keep living

I must choose
to be
awake or afraid
asleep or be dead
choices such 

No longer inclined  
to such am I 
they are 
mine


You stalk, you haunt, you seek, 
You prey on the vulnerable, mild and weak! 
You scout out the crowd, for an innocent soul, 
You have no feelings, a heart so cold! 

You think you're a King, 
As you sit on your throne, 
With those cowards behind you, 
Your evil to the bone! 

Your a School Bully! 
It's as simple as that, 
But one day, when you fall from grace, 
I'll take off my hat

I dreamed in the Mexican desert, I drove cattle on my grand son's wooden horse.
The Marshall caught me at the border.
I said, ' I am Lone Ranger.'
Then he gave me his horse and some forged documents to cross the border.
She woke me up in the morning.
I grumbled; 'Let me sleep today is the Independence Day.'
'Hey! We are still aliens.'

I dedicate this poem to my sincere friend Denis. 

Joe


* Wherever you go you never find a home like in your Motherland. 

The plums tasted 
sweet to the unlettered desert-tribe girl- 
but what manners! To chew into each! She was ungainly, 
low-caste, ill mannered and dirty, 
but the god took the 
fruit she'd been sucking. 
Why? She'd knew how to love. 
She might not distinquish 
splendor from filth 
but she'd tasted the nectar of passion. 
Might not know any Veda, 
but a chariot swept her away- 
now she frolics in heaven, esctatically bound 
to her god. 
will save anyone 
who can practice rapture like that- 
I myself in a previous birth 
was a cowherding girl 
at Gokul. 

Sweet dreams form a shade,
O'er my lovely infants head.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams,
By happy silent moony beams

Sweet sleep with soft down.
Weave thy brows an infant crown.
Sweet sleep Angel mild,
Hover o'er my happy child.

Sweet smiles in the night,
Hover over my delight.
Sweet smiles Mothers smiles,
All the livelong night beguiles.

Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,
Chase not slumber from thy eyes,
Sweet moans, sweeter smiles,
All the dovelike moans beguiles.

Sleep sleep happy child,
All creation slept and smil'd.
Sleep sleep, happy sleep.
While o'er thee thy mother weep

Sweet babe in thy face,
Holy image I can trace.
Sweet babe once like thee.
Thy maker lay and wept for me

Wept for me for thee for all,
When he was an infant small.
Thou his image ever see.
Heavenly face that smiles on thee,

Smiles on thee on me on all,
Who became an infant small,
Infant smiles are His own smiles,
Heaven & earth to peace beguiles. 

THE angels are stooping
Above your bed;
They weary of trooping
With the whimpering dead.
To see you so good;
The Sailing Seven
Are gay with His mood.
I sigh that kiss you,
For I must own
That I shall miss you
When you have grown. 

O men from the fields, 
Come gently within. 
Tread softly, softly 
O men coming in! 
Mavourneen is going 
From me and from you, 
Where Mary will fold him 
With mantle of blue! 
From reek of the smoke 
And cold of the floor 
And the peering of things 
Across the half-door. 
O men of the fields, 
Soft, softly come thro' 
Mary puts round him 
Her mantle of blue. 

Hard to still such a thrill
that so fast revives my babyhood
as all heaven condenses in the touch
of my baby's warm little palm in mine
and whose thoughts compared, all
other thoughts are nought and despite
a fleeting moment, the measure
of such ecstatic moment century fulfils. 

why don’t I
just 
give in
into this 
craving 

I know I will 
give in 
so why not 
now

Save me from 
days of worrying
eating myself 
alive 
trying to 
decide
When I already 
know 
I will do it

I just don’t care 
anymore
let them notice 
me 
for once 
in my life

If they freak
its better 
than not 
reach 

I guess
at least I 
might 
be noticed

Who am I 
kidding
they will not 
notice
an outsider 
they may 
start asking 
questions

They will be 
forced 
to notice 
me

The question is
will they 
care

I already know
they won’t
even if they 
notice me
what I have
done to 
myself

I think it won’t 
matter 
because they 
don't care
not about 
me 

What have I 
done
to myself

Maybe they will 
realize
if they would have 
noticed me 
before 
instead of 
ignoring 
me so

I might not have 
this craving

I might have 
had the 
strength to 
fight it
yeah right 
they will 
deny it 
all of it

They will say the 
outsider lies
and never even 
look my way

Why did I ever worry 
about this
one in a hundred 
chance they 
will notice

Show me that 
they actually 
care

I worry about what 
the outsider thinks
yes I do 
but why 
they know not 
of me

They may think 
they do 

The truth is no one 
knows me 
not even I

Maybe after 
this
after I give 
in

I will find 
myself

Just for me or 
maybe this is 
me


THAT crazed girl improvising her music.
Her poetry, dancing upon the shore,

Her soul in division from itself
Climbing, falling She knew not where,
Hiding amid the cargo of a steamship,
Her knee-cap broken, that girl I declare
A beautiful lofty thing, or a thing
Heroically lost, heroically found.

No matter what disaster occurred
She stood in desperate music wound,
Wound, wound, and she made in her triumph
Where the bales and the baskets lay
No common intelligible sound

from the hard seed
to the rough and ruffled root
a scaly stem. 
much of use to me
how do we get
an incense flower
and a sweet little fruit
with another seed within it
what an expression of creation
rough soft to rough again
just like a
'rough and tough grandma' of mine
born to my tender daughter again
nature never pretends and
a creation goes onwhy search for him
every where
when he is right within me
 
whether iam a spec or the sea
why search for him 
every where
when he is right within me
 
THE CREATOR WOULD BE IN HIS CREATION
 
whether iam  a spec or the sea
he would be in me
i would show him
in every bit of me
for this whole world to see


For the sole edification 
Of this decent congregation, 
Goodly people, by your grant 
I will sing a holy chant -- 
I will sing a holy chant. 
If the ditty sound but oddly, 
'Twas a father, wise and godly, 
Sang it so long ago -- 
Then sing as Martin Luther sang, 
As Doctor Martin Luther sang: 
"Who loves not wine, woman and song, 
He is a fool his whole life long!" 

He, by custom patriarchal, 
Loved to see the beaker sparkle; 
And he thought the wine improved, 
Tasted by the lips he loved -- 
But the kindly lips he loved. 
Friends, I wish this custom pious 
Duly were observed by us, 
To combine love, song, wine, 
And sing as Martin Luther sang, 
As Doctor Martin Luther sang: 
"Who loves not wine, woman, and song, 
He is a fool his whole life long!"There is a destiny that makes us brothers:
None goes his way alone:
All that we send into the lives of others
Comes back into our own.

I care not what his temples or his creeds,
One thing holds firm and fast
That into his fateful heap of days and deeds
The soul of man Is cast. 

I will not go near that house, 

Especially not tonight.

It's usually all boarded up, 

Doors and windows sealed tight.

 

It looks like a door is open.

I see the flickering of a light.

There are logs in the fireplace.

A fire is burning bright.

 

I'm sure there are witches dancing, 

And goblins jumping about.

If you listen carefully, 

You can hear monsters shout.

 

There must be a mummy, 

And an ogre or two, 

Along with a werewolf

Lapping up an unspeakable stew.

 

They put out decorations

To overcome my fright, 

But I will not go near that house, 

Especially not tonight

I sat against your knees all night.
I watched the sun rise in your coffee cup.
In all that time you never spoke to me.
I think I must have cried a thousand tears.

Inside the wall a cricket sang good luck.
The irony of that did not escape you.
For when I tilted up my chin you smiled
To think how once he conned us with that song.

The morning rises white against the pane, 
Bland as a sheet of paper without words.
Our eyes communicate it silently, 
I think this fog goes on and on, my friend.

I sat against your knees all day.
I watched the sun sink in your coffee cup.
I think we must have cried a thousand tears.
Before the cricket sang us both to sleep.

From my book, 'The Colors Cry In Rain', Apollo Books, USAUnder the cover of the drowsy night, 
I see a very painful sight, 
On the outskirts of the city, 
A crime is born out of pity, 
The crime is henious in nature, 
Modesty experiences a  fracture, 
Who are these awesome faces, 
I saw on them no traces, 
No traces of shame and modesty, 
Humanity seems to be void of honesty, 
They are waiting for the customers, 
They can be both old and new comers, 
No job for them is a better substitute, 
For each one of them is a prostitute. 

A gender has the burden, 
Another in delusion, 
The fetal abortion, 
The crime of passion, 
The accused in desperation, 
Facing the prosecution, 
The heavenly judges in confusion, 
How to deliver the version, 
Of verdict in unfair notion, 
When the hunters are in dream, 
Not knowing of their stream, 
The lonely expecting human and their scream, 
Why is this injustice to women

Sometimes human is worse than animal
Animal never at fault
Only human that could be right or wrong
Maybe it sounds like a reason
But human can not escape just by saying
It is driven only by instinct


Bow before the insolence. 
death do I provoke? 
A flame upon your fire, 
an eternal flame burns within all these scarlet remnants.
Even with death grasping me, 
an inferno within; 
dilated eyes burn, hotter than any sinful lips.
they ignite the downy tinder of my heart.

I always get burned.
 
Boiling this bad blood, 
purifying love by any means, 
Look within these eyes. feel the flame. 

The beat.
The very heart of life; destruction. 

Its heart beats the same as mine. 
I unwrap my hold around you, 
my gaze softened into the somber coals of eternity. 
My grip upon you, melting to every curve of your body, 
My name I burned upon your heart, 
the pain will be moments, 
but I will be there forever. 

Mismatched confinement
recruited enticement
seizing and slathering grace, 
insidious and grim.
Reminded of the treachery
a clique reduced in numbers
laughs at the foolishness.

We smile behind a mask
and let on a deceitful appearance
mutilated in mind and body.
Our hearts are not one
but of a mind
confused in our own self
repenting on decisions and desire.

Remind me not of who I have become.

Record the blissful child who has grown
and lost his naivete
and lose his memories of the past
and find them well hidden in the future.

For we are who we are -
the mask we dance in
hides our smile, 
but never our eyes.
Deceitful looks, overlooked.
We laugh and wonder
who are we to be us
and to be a mingler among them. 

Life is guided by fate
Fate is guided by her talk
Fate can wait for her
She has the divine gift
To make you sleep in few seconds
As its she who can
Take your life in a span
I swear on her
She never knows about herself
But i have a doubt
Wheather she thinks well
Or goes only with worst. 


Might that deliberate reluctance then suggest an abiding presence of a Satanic Master, that perhaps, it collectively worships? 

‘Tis, a critical thought.  .. 

to ponder. .. 

How often have the critics, trained
To look upon the sky
Through telescopes securely chained,
Forgot the naked eye.

Within the compass of their glass
Each smallest star they knew,
And not a meteor could pass
But they were looking through.

When a new planet shed its rays
Beyond their field of vision,
And simple folk ran out to gaze,
They laughed in high derision.

They railed upon the senseless throng
Who cheered the brave new light.
And yet the learned men were wrong,
The simple folk were right.

As long as there is a will
We could be anything we want
We are free
We could choose and decide ourselves
There is happiness
At the end of the road that we choose
Something will be vain
If you think it useless
Everything is depended by your point of viewsometimes. 
it really becomes difficult
to keep the HEAD in place
if you go through a political magazine
if you watch through a political channel
it could really get you.
your HEAD might start spinning
 
every party has a dedicated channel
your HEAD  might sway to the right
if you are watching the ruling party's channel
a neutral channel might put it back in place.. 

again
an opposition channel would swing it to the left
it really becomes difficult
to keep the HEAD in place
 
if you are going through a political magazine
if there is an interview of a politician
who has just switched party or changed alliance
if there is anything highligted in the interview.  

about
what he said BEFORE and AFTER switching. 
my advice would be.  

please don't even venture to read it
it would swing your HEAD left and right.. 

continuosly and rapidly
your HEAD might take a full round before you finish
 
INSPITE OF ALL THESE CONSEQUENCES
IF YOU ARE AN ARDENT FAN OF POLITICS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.  

A CRUDE METHOD OF
PLACING TWO STICKS ON EITHER SIDES MIGHT HELP
THE HEAD TO STAY IN PLACEI don't want to say anything
You have left me for nothing
You have filled my life with sorrow
I don't know what will happen tomorrow
Your indifference will take my life
I myself have put my throat on the knife
Everything was going on very well
No sooner did I stand than I fell
Now you have made a fun of me
And you are walking with  glee
What will happen to my emotion? 
Where you have made a commotion
I think I was absolutely wrong
My ruin has sounded a furious gong
My sentiments are extremely genuine

Nursing a fracture
On bed, leg stretched out in cast; 
Friends smile and sign.  

Oh, there are eyes that he can see,
 And hands to make his hands rejoice,
But to my lover I must be
 Only a voice.

Oh, there are breasts to bear his head,
 And lips whereon his lips can lie,
But I must be till I am dead
 Only a cry.




Dont keep me hidden, 
in this dark room, 
please show me the sun, 
so that I can bloom.
I know you kept me here, 
just to keep me warm, 
but now it is time, 
to show me the dawn.
I am ready to flower, 
I need some light, 
and the warmth of the sun, 
that shines so bright.
I have been shut away, 
all winter long, 
my bulb and stem, 
are now extra strong.
My date is near, 
to join all the rest, 
and show off my trumpet
at it's very best.
I dont care where I stand, 
or where I go, 
I just want to put on, 
a very good show.
I am boasting not, 
but I will be, a real smart fellow 
standing proud, 
in the brightest of yellow.
If I go out now, 
they say I am sure to catch a chill, , 
so I am stuck in this room, 
on a drafty windowsill.
It's frosty outside, 
but the crocuses bloom, 
and here I remain, in this dark tomb 
the March winds blow, I'll be in such a state, 
I know I wont pass my graduation date. 

My forest brave, my Red-skin love, farewell; 
We may not meet to-morrow; who can tell 
What mighty ills befall our little band, 
Or what you'll suffer from the white man's hand? 
Here is your knife! I thought 'twas sheathed for aye. 
No roaming bison calls for it to-day; 
No hide of prairie cattle will it maim; 
The plains are bare, it seeks a nobler game: 
'Twill drink the life-blood of a soldier host. 
Go; rise and strike, no matter what the cost. 
Yet stay. Revolt not at the Union Jack, 
Nor raise Thy hand against this stripling pack 
Of white-faced warriors, marching West to quell 
Our fallen tribe that rises to rebel. 
They all are young and beautiful and good; 
Curse to the war that drinks their harmless blood. 
Curse to the fate that brought them from the East 
To be our chiefs--to make our nation least 
That breathes the air of this vast continent. 
Still their new rule and council is well meant. 
They but forget we Indians owned the land 
From ocean unto ocean; that they stand 
Upon a soil that centuries agone 
Was our sole kingdom and our right alone. 
They never think how they would feel to-day, 
If some great nation came from far away, 
Wresting their country from their hapless braves, 
Giving what they gave us--but wars and graves. 
Then go and strike for liberty and life, 
And bring back honour to your Indian wife. 
Your wife? Ah, what of that, who cares for me? 
Who pities my poor love and agony? 
What white-robed priest prays for your safety here, 
As prayer is said for every volunteer 
That swells the ranks that Canada sends out? 
Who prays for vict'ry for the Indian scout? 
Who prays for our poor nation lying low? 
None--therefore take your tomahawk and go. 
My heart may break and burn into its core, 
But I am strong to bid you go to war. 
Yet stay, my heart is not the only one 
That grieves the loss of husband and of son; 
Think of the mothers o'er the inland seas; 
Think of the pale-faced maiden on her knees; 
That marches on toward the North-West wild. 
The other prays to shield her love from harm, 
To strengthen his young, proud uplifted arm. 
Ah, how her white face quivers thus to think, 
Your tomahawk his life's best blood will drink. 
She never thinks of my wild aching breast, 
Nor prays for your dark face and eagle crest 
Endangered by a thousand rifle balls, 
My heart the target if my warrior falls. 
O! coward self I hesitate no more; 
Go forth, and win the glories of the war. 
Go forth, nor bend to greed of white men's hands, 
By right, by birth we Indians own these lands, 
Though starved, crushed, plundered, lies our nation low.  


How deep in life I had to fall
Living a constant lie
But then with back against the wall
I couldn't help but cry

"I've had enough I can't go on
It's far too hard to bear
Where can I hide where can I run
Is anybody there"? 

Angry, downhearted, plagued with doubts
But no one seemed to care
My whispers turned to frightened shouts
"Please help me if You're there"

A week, a month, just crawled on by
Tears were nothing strange
Hopeless, depressed, wanting to die  
But then I felt the change

I heard a voice perhaps a thought
But then it came again
The facts were all so plain

Knowing exactly how we feel
And all we've said and done

Upon the ground upon my face
The truth began to pour
Ridding my soul of all disgrace
Closing the devil's jaw

Enabling me my faults to see
The filthy things I've done
. 

A Cry in the Night


From the courtyard far below
We all heard the woman scream.
Faces at the windows saw
The masked assailant stalk his prey.


"Stop that", someone shouted down.
but none went to the woman’s aide.
Not even did we call police
while she still might have been saved.


She screamed for help but no help came, 
Her hands bled from defensive wounds.
Her killer made a final thrust
And she folded in a swoon.

He grabbed her purse which was the prize
And left her in the courtyard, dead
Her name was Kitty Genovese
A pretty girl, the tabloids said.

A moment in a City’s life-
Not a source of civic pride
Glad she was not a child of mine
Did you watch the night that Kitty died? 

Source: 
the events of  the night of March o! woodsmen of the mountain side!
Ho! dwellers in the vales!
Ho! ye who by the chafing tide
Have roughened in the gales!
Leave barn and byre, leave kin and cot,
Lay by the bloodless spade;
Let desk, and case, and counter rot,
And burn your books of trade.

The despot roves your fairest lands;
And till he flies or fears,
Your fields must grow but arm|\ed bands,
Your sheaves be sheaves of spears!
Give up to mildew and to rust
The useless tools of gain;
And feed your country's sacred dust
With floods of crimson rain!

Come, with the weapons at your call --
With musket, pike, or knife;
He wields the deadliest blade of all
Who lightest holds his life.
The arm that drives its unbought blows
With all a patriot's scorn,
Might brain a tyrant with a rose,
Or stab him with a thorn.

Does any falter? let him turn
To some brave maiden's eyes,
And catch the holy fires that burn
In those sublunar skies.
Oh! could you like your women feel,
And in their spirit march,
A day might see your lines of steel
Beneath the victor's arch.

When thoughts like these give cheer?
The Lily calmly braves the storm,
And shall the Palm-tree fear?
No! rather let its branches court
The rack that sweeps the plain;
And from the Lily's regal port
Learn how to breast the strain!

Ho! woodsmen of the mountain side!
Ho! dwellers in the vales!
Ho! ye who by the roaring tide
Have roughened in the gales!
Come! flocking gayly to the fight,
From forest, hill, and lake;
We battle for our Country's right,
And for the Lily's sake!(YEARS AGO)

One day I thought of leaving, It was a moment, I closed my eyes, my self was torn to pieces, a part of me was taken away that moment I saw a crying orphan begging me to stay. 

I found my self surrounded by all of you
your tears filled my eyes and in my turn started to cry asking how and why  i forgot my place which is placed so high in the sky

you whispered to me.. 

you are the giver and you will never be a miser, 

in your eyes I  saw my touch healing you, watchful eyes guarding you, 

when the sky will be mean Iam the rain in your desert, the shiny sun in a stormy way, I'm the cover in the lonely nights, iam the breeze in a summer day, 

we as it may seems Florence nightingale to soldiers in the war
We are the guide for the lost in UN unknown land, we maintain our motto pledge to provide the needy with our care, regardless to religion, ethnicity and race. 

(deeply rooted in the land, no one shakes us, able always to stand in the face of a stormy sands)                       
we are the pain relievers, happiness builders, secrets' keepers

when every body leaves, you find me there ready to give, ready to care, eradicate scary nights with night mare, like the doves carry you back to home, 

AFTER THAT HECTIC DAY. .. 

I BECOME MORE CONSISTENT TO STAY

despite  DIFFICULTIES.., CROOKED WAY..
I will be your father, mother, I will not bother, how much the cost, how much i pay, 

and when my tears became dear to my eyes, 
your praying convinced me more and morrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
just. . .. to stayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

a cuckoo cries
and through a thicket of bamboo
the late moon shines


A cuckoo sings
to me, to the mountain,
    to me, to the mountain.




In our dainty little kitchen,
Over all the tin-pan people,
In a realm exceeding clean,
Oft I like to loiter, watching
While she mixes things for tea;
And she tasks me, slyly smiling,
"Now just guess what this will be!"

Hidden in a big blue apron,
Her dimpled arms laid bare,
And the love-smiles coyly mingling
With a housewife’s frown of care—
See her beat a golden batter,
Pausing but to ask of me,
As she adds a bit of butter,
"Now just guess what this will be!"

Then I bravely do my duty,
Guess it, "pudding," "cake" or "pie,"
"Dumplings," "waffles," "bread" or "muffins;"
But no matter what I try,
This provoking witch just answers:
"Never mind, just wait and see!
But I think you should be able,
Dear, to guess what this will be."

Little fraud! she never tells me
Until ’tis baked and browned—
And I think I know the reason
For her secrecy profound—
She herself with all her fine airs
And her books on cookery,
Could not answer, should I ask her,
"Dearest, what will that mess be?"Medium heat showers at six in the morning
Freshen me up with that needed zest
Vitalizing me to face another day
The flow of water sounds like waterfalls
Pinnacles of a bathroom
Smells of hygiene everywhere
Shampoos, creamy soaps and aftershave lotions
What a day to start your motion


Back to my room
It’s like a routine; I’d know which band of clothes to choose
Soaking cologne to my body is a boost
Enhancing your confidence
And be more prudent
My wet look
Would make women get hooked

After doing my routine, I step out of the front door
Grabbing the morning newspaper from the lawn
Back to the living room
A delightful aroma of the best natural coffee
Penetrates my nostrils
My brain sends signals to my body
'Be ready for energy and vitality'
I sit down in the kitchen
Reading the headlines and checking my schedule
I pick up the cup on the table
My passion is tested
I deeply inhale 
The first sip could expand your blood vessels
After the next sips
I could feel the blood rush
My heart was beating faster
Like a conga beat

The caffeine with a dropp of chocolates
Driving me to a roller coaster ride
That is what I need
To face the world
Get a cup of coffee
Get a Cappuccino
Don’t say no
You’ll know


It's empty 
You plea

I fill half
You sigh

I pour full
You drink all

If it's empty
You.  

Makes me wide awake through the day
Just a smile and a hug from your kind heart
oh! what more can I say! 

I am blessed with many friends in this site
It spells wonders, it makes me feel small
And no more I need my heart to shift.! 

Friendship is a special thing for us all
It comes straight from the deepest place in your heart
It reaches out, speaks out, can hear and listen
It must not keep us apart

So come, and be with me today and everyday
Go get a cup, let's have some coffee and chat
I want it very very hot, with cream, no sugar please
With cookies, chocos and cowboy hat


Your love, bittersweet
Is like a cup of coffee
Addicting my heart


EMOTIONS' CUP. 

Sip with me a cup of few sunny, 

warm and rainy emotions in this morning. 

say it before you leave..

The noisy sound which is around 

prevent us at times to listen to the beautiful songs.., 

do not let us see the truth and the depth of it, 

the beauty which is there every where.

wasting for the pleasure when we lose appreciation's treasure

when we stay blind.. 



I do realize what within, 

that infront and what behind.., 

Before the death I taste the life..

from each garden I carry some flowers, 

I plant one in me and give other to another.

I carry a stone from each weepy land, 

a dropp from each rain.

a painful song, a beautiful scene.
, 
when I'm away.
by recalling them  
I do guard my heart, 
I revive my sighing mind 


When we leave without realizing the beauty of that sound which could be found among the crowd..

we leave while carrying life's heaviness in one strand.  

A cup of tea, some soda bread, 
Would you take some milk and sugar, friend? 
Sit here by the fireside
And share with me the daylights end.
 
You show your photos with just pride
This one of your eldest, a blushing bride
Wasn’t it just yesterday
she was a toddler hard at play? 

Here are prints of Bob and Fred
Your two boys, both Ginger heads
Bob’s at University
My Henry used to work with Fred..

.
I had a letter yesterday
From our friend, Mary, at Black Bay
Her son is fighting in Iraq
She counts the days until he’s back

 
Its’ hard for me now Henry’s gone-
my children grown and moved away.
Filling moments isn’t easy
II'm grateful that you came today. 
 
Remember when we all were young
and danced at ceili’s all night long
We gave our parents anxious times
staying out sometimes till dawn..

A cup of tea, some soda bread, 
Have it with a bit of jam.
Let the tea steep and grow strong
Night is coming soon anon. 

A CUP OF TIME. 

I sat outside, the trees nearly bare before
me.  

as my eyes fixed on a leaf of autumn
as it skidded along the concrete walkway.

I sipped the hot brew from the container
cupped between my hands. Memories
from time past, like waves on a beach. 
flooded over me. Children scattered to
the far places of the earth and a wife long
since removed to the great abyss.

Another sip of the comforting liquid.  

memories
of happier times.  

the distant echoed laughter
from loved ones.  

and against the slate gray
sky, pictures of precious memories floating
in the drifting clouds.

Ahhhhh, this brew, this cup of time returns so
many memories.  

so much happiness and yes
the inevitable sorrows of life.

As I emptied the hot brew, it seemed the memories
ceased. Is it possible.  

without my brew in this
cup of memories.  

that now memories are not? 

I reflected on that possibility. No.  

I would not
let that happen, for tomorrow I shall return yet
again.  

with my cup of time.  

to recall
that which I hold so dear.



or the look your eyes
dont lingering give. 

the tone of your voice
haunts graveyards before children, 
silences the final clock! 

and we walk not alone amid ghosts
and disembodied bodies
all reaching out with bleeding lips

no murmur, no cries, silent soldiers
bearing the burnt cross of life
searching for freedom, and

a cup of water

with a cup of wine
come dine with me, 
on thoughts of mine, 

Bacchinal or Dionysus
or more sedate, 
wine, aged for time of taste

tickles the palate, 
tittilates the mind, 
sip from the well of memory

ritual and ceremony, 
serious and light, 
wine from her vines

arouse the senses
cloud the issues
brighten the spirits

raise a cup of wine
for  old lang syne


May the sun ever shine 
      upon your hair 
          may stardust light your way.
So the glory you enfold
      may shine forth like a rainbow 
                      made of elfin coloured gold. 

May the wind ever cool your brow 
      and whisper 
          to you of wonders 
                      it has seen on other days.
So you may ever walk 
          in a fresh tender breeze 
while the wind serenades sings 
          for you among the enchanted trees.

Telling you of stories as wondrous 
      as tints of Autumn’s falling leaves 
yet amazingly diverse 
      like the springtime flight of bees.

Sacred bees should fly 
      only to the sweetest 
of wild meadow flower, 
      then seek out far flung blooms 
treasures that grace 
      only secret hidden glades.

In remembrance of starset lovers 
      in consecrated blessing 
                        of their finest hour.

Gathered nectar 
      mixed on nuptial wind 
Greek gods 
      would bring to me 
upon your lips 
      only could it 
honoured be 
      a cup of honeyed wine 
would I give to thee.

Fain would the angels be 
      when I held that cup to thee. 

I would give you wine and song 
      to bless the startling memory
 
of first reborn celestial day, 
      veiled in radiance, you came along.

When you touched my heart 
      with a love, pure, endures ever lasts.
Took me from cold depths of stone 
      to a jewel, radiant shines for us alone.

In another world we roam 
      always together 
                  never more apart 

on breath of love 
      that endures longer 
                  than mere mortal heart.


you only see me running or on the phone
i work all the time even at dawn
i have my money so I`m not alone
***
you who live in loneliness
and have no time for cupid
if you keep living like this
then you must be stupid
***
i eat when i have to and drink
i only wash up when i stink
working all day i cannot blink
i never have fun, but in my thoughts i sink
****
you know what my fellow? 
you actually need a shrink
or an arrow in your blue heart
to change it to pink
*****
you made us sad and moved emotions inus
so, by the power given to me by Venus
i throw the arrow of mercy at your heart
so living life you shall start


When the sickness is sadness, 
laughter is the cure.

I am tired of all your pious talk.
Also, I am tired of all the dead.
They refuse to listen, 
so leave them alone.
Take your foot out of the graveyard, 
they are busy being dead.

Everyone was always to blame: 
the last empty fifth of booze, 
the rusty nails and chicken feathers
that stuck in the mud on the back doorstep, 
the worms that lived under the cat's ear
and the thin-lipped preacher
who refused to call
except once on a flea-ridden day
when he came scuffing in through the yard
looking for a scapegoat.
I hid in the kitchen under the ragbag.

I refuse to remember the dead.
And the dead are bored with the whole thing.
But you - you go ahead, 
go on, go on back down
into the graveyard, 
lie down where you think their faces are; 
talk back to your old bad dreams. 

I heard an angel speak last night,
     And he said 'Write!
Write a Nation's curse for me,
And send it over the Western Sea.'

I faltered, taking up the word:
     'Not so, my lord!
If curses must be, choose another
To send thy curse against my brother.

'For I am bound by gratitude,
     By love and blood,
To brothers of mine across the sea,
Who stretch out kindly hands to me.'

'Therefore,' the voice said, 'shalt thou write
     My curse to-night.
From the summits of love a curse is driven,
As lightning is from the tops of heaven.'

'Not so,' I answered. 'Evermore
     My heart is sore
For my own land's sins: for little feet
Of children bleeding along the street:

'For parked-up honors that gainsay
     The right of way:
For almsgiving through a door that is
Not open enough for two friends to kiss:

'For love of freedom which abates
     Beyond the Straits:
For patriot virtue starved to vice on
Self-praise, self-interest, and suspicion:

'For an oligarchic parliament,
     And bribes well-meant.
What curse to another land assign,
When heavy-souled for the sins of mine?'

'Therefore,' the voice said, 'shalt thou write
     My curse to-night.
Because thou hast strength to see and hate
A foul thing done within thy gate.'

'Not so,' I answered once again.
     'To curse, choose men.
For I, a woman, have only known
How the heart melts and the tears run down.'

'Therefore,' the voice said, 'shalt thou write
     My curse to-night.
Some women weep and curse, I say
(And no one marvels), night and day.

'And thou shalt take their part to-night,
     Weep and write.
A curse from the depths of womanhood
Is very salt, and bitter, and good.'

So thus I wrote, and mourned indeed,
     What all may read.
And thus, as was enjoined on me,
I send it over the Western Sea.

The Curse

Because ye have broken your own chain
          With the strain
Of brave men climbing a Nation's height,
Yet thence bear down with brand and thong
     On souls of others, -- for this wrong
          This is the curse. Write.

Because yourselves are standing straight
          In the state
Of Freedom's foremost acolyte,
Yet keep calm footing all the time
     On writhing bond-slaves, -- for this crime
          This is the curse. Write.

          With a claim
To honor in the old world's sight,
Yet do the fiend's work perfectly
     In strangling martyrs, -- for this lie
          This is the curse. Write.

Ye shall watch while kings conspire
Round the people's smouldering fire,
          And, warm for your part,
Shall never dare -- O shame!
To utter the thought into flame
     Which burns at your heart.
          This is the curse. Write.

Ye shall watch while nations strive
With the bloodhounds, die or survive,
          Drop faint from their jaws,
Or throttle them backward to death;
And only under your breath
     Shall favor the cause.
          This is the curse. Write.

Ye shall watch while strong men draw
The nets of feudal law
          To strangle the weak;
And, counting the sin for a sin,
Your soul shall be sadder within
     Than the word ye shall speak.
          This is the curse. Write.

When good men are praying erect
          And deliver the earth,
The prayer in your ears, said low,
Shall sound like the tramp of a foe
     That's driving you forth.
          This is the curse. Write.

When wise men give you their praise,
They shall praise in the heat of the phrase,
          As if carried too far.
When ye boast your own charters kept true,
Ye shall blush; for the thing which ye do
     Derides what ye are.
          This is the curse. Write.

When fools cast taunts at your gate,
Your scorn ye shall somewhat abate
          As ye look o'er the wall;
For your conscience, tradition, and name
Explode with a deadlier blame
     Than the worst of them all.
          This is the curse. Write.

Go, wherever ill deeds shall be done,
Go, plant your flag in the sun
          Beside the ill-doers!
And recoil from clenching the curse
     With a curse of yours.
          This is the curse. Write. 

A curve 
in full silvery light
a full moon
a meeting of curves
an arch
the fashionable curve
a wave
the passionate weave
all beauty
in curves of heart
the dove's bosom
dodging touch by action
the lovely breasts
curving from virginity
to eternity's unrest.
milking love
and molten passions
splitting hearts
and spilling iron thoughts
all curves in hips
and lips and 
she stoops
to curve me
down and down
to win her over
and win me all quivers'The Prophet' Leland Wright'

This is the best description of "a cut above love"
This is what fairy tales are design out of 
Outlining what can’t be described 
Still don’t know what it really means 
What comes to the heart is still sketchy 
I want to define but when it comes fairly
I barely care for the meaning 
Especially when the love brightens the evening 
I know of the backlash and the blisters it cause
But that’s like looking too deep at a narrow space for flaws 
What we have is far more than a flower that blossoms
The flower was already grown, smells so good I can’t toss-em 
Her scent, her smile, must have been heaven sent on my aisle
Being isolated from her darkens my path, like feeling demons wrath
Like I was on a plane crash, but when she comes I rise from the ashes 
Like a phoenix and embrace what she gives, I trust all her motive seeds 
Shield her from anything, love sealed, liquefied by molten lead 
Attack anyone who would try to keep her captive
Our love is massive, no room for bickering and clashing 
I keep my faith in the Sabbath, loves alignment is above NASA
And even if we ever broke the string of eternal love 
I would know it was cut above a flying dove 
In this case water was as thick as blood 
A better comparison is a rose resemblance is equal to a family tree 
So I can’t ignore any of my love ones needs 


'Angel, From Above' Tiffany O'Donahue

Your description may be true, 
But even the best of fairy tales can die, and turn blue.
Out lining can be erased, 
And we can search for a meaning 'til we're blue in the face.
We can look and we can try, 
But the meanings in our heart, we won't ever find.
Love can come easy or you will fall hard, 
But pay attention because it could hit and kill your glass heart.
It is bright as the radiance of the sun, 
But can make you hurt, even before it's begun.
You can look into a deep dark abyss and what will you find, 
Nothing, can't see anywhere to hide.
The blooming of a flower is gorgeous at the beginning, 
Your heart stops and your breath starts quickening.
His smell, his dimples, all from the heaven above, 
Being away from you hurts, but it strengthens my love.
No planes could burn us down or turn us to dust, 
I kiss your sexy lips, and I know I have your trust.
Protect me, because you're my guardian angel, 
Save me, even if we look at it from a different angle.
Our love is immense; there won't ever be a big fight, 
The string is strong and forever binding, 
The cut is immense and our hearts' shine is blinding.
Water may be thicker than blood, 
But there's nothing that we can compare our love.
So now I must give you my love, 
The Cut Above Love is not small. 

Shivering and shaking at the knees
So cold, she feared some fatal disease
Go do like Jack Horner
And stand in the corner
They're usually ninety degrees


They are the tiny drops from the sky.
Who are so pure that they cannot deny
They quietly listen to all that we say 
Then, touch the earth or vanish in a bay.
When I'm with you I will not cry even a single a tear 
And your touch have chased away all of my fear 
you have given me a life that I could live worthwhile 
it is even better every time you smile.
 You changed my world with a blink of an eye 
That is something that I can not deny 
You put my soul from worst to best 
That is why I treasure you my dearest
Feel our bodies pressed close
As close as skin to skin, 
Open your heart to me--
Come on, let me in
Fill my senses with your rush
Let me taste your deep kiss, 
Hold me tightly to your heart.

It so magical those things you've made 
to bring back my faith that almost fade 
now my life is a dream come true 
it all began when I was loved by you. 

Remember those days, 
When it was said honesty pays.
And people tried their best, 
To be respecting of others? 

Today thieves blatantly steal from others, 
With a declaration as to what they own.
And dismiss others they choose to disrespect, 
With a respect from them that is demanded to be shown.

Remember those days, 
When it was said honesty pays.
And people tried their best, 
To be respecting of others? 

If you don't remember times like this, 
Don't concern yourself with it.
You are probably the least affected.
And your life is based upon. 
A cutting to paste from a snippet quick.
With an easier claim as a creation you made exist.
To wallow away in a minutes of unearned fame.
Void of originality.
But that's where the minds today, 
Prefer to sit to then languish over it.
Bemoaning their boredom with the ease of life.

Only the counting of illegal funds, 
For many would make this right! 

Remember those days, 
When it was said honesty pays.
And people tried their best, 
To be respecting of others? 
Well
Move over.
You are in the way. 

The sun smiles, 
forcefully examining the bitterness of the leaves
that have become
crushed under the weight
of the eve’s rainfall.

I look on, 
curiously wondering 
why the sun seems to give light, 
to even the most shattering
displays of nature’s fury.

I am broken, I think.
The sun has never fixed me.

Outside the drops of rain evaporate steadily.
Dew, which once subsided in even the most porous
of surfaces 
has all but disappeared, 
confronted  instead
by a warmth as steady
as the sun is iridescent. 

You are an observer, I say.
Callous, cold, and unfeeling.

On the ground two squirrels fight playfully.
An acorn has fallen between the two, 
and with quizzical wonderment
I watch as a
stalled fury erupts 
into a courtship like dance
of dominator 
versus 
domineered. 

Atleast they have each other, I muse.
Who do you have? 

The last remnants of darkness have lifted
and the birds respond with a steady hum. 
In their song I hear them say, 
serenity, serenity: 
this is the world.

I turn my head, 
And dropp my gaze
downward.

Serenity, serenity, 
Is not the world’s way.


The sun rises fully, 

I sit on the ground. 



Although they claim to save your soul.
The truth is it’s a power game
the priests of all creeds are the same.

Although the priests may well protest.
Your soul’s of little interest.
They want to tell you what to do.
If you believe their words are true

 you will obey like silly sheep
Instead of walking you will creep.
Obey the rules they give to you
Exactly as they want you to

I am quite certain some believe
 that what they promise they achieve
Because for you they intercede
Your place in heaven’s guaranteed

Another trick which they all use
The threat of Hell if you refuse
 tobelieve all the words they say
That their way is the only way.


They label me a heretic
Because I know what makes them tick.
To most it’s just a power game
 a way to achieve lasting fame.

They do not practice what they preach
 and disbelieve the things they teach.
you may say I am cynical
 but I reply I’m practical.

 Their prime objective is to rise
 as high up in their hierarchies 
as it is possible to do.
Except perhaps for very few.

The godly men of every creed
Who do their best to meet the need
Of those who follow faithfully
and count no man an enemy.




If you in the village think that my work was a good one,
Who closed the saloons and stopped all playing at cards,
And haled old Daisy Fraser before Justice Arnett,
In many a crusade to purge the people of sin;
Why do you let the milliner's daughter Dora,
And the worthless son of Benjamin Pantier,
Nightly make my grave their unholy pillow

War and Disaster, Famine and Pestilence,
Vaunt-couriers of the Century that comes,
Behold them shaking their tremendous plumes
Above the world! where all the air grows dense
With rumors of destruction and a sense,
Cadaverous, of corpses and of tombs
Predestined; while, like monsters in the glooms,
Bristling with battle, shadowy and immense,
The Nations rise in wild apocalypse.
Where now the boast Earth makes of civilization?
We seek to see them in the dread eclipse
Of hell and horror, all the devastation
Of Death triumphant on his hills of slain. 

Any fool can be a father.
 It takes a man to be a Dad.
Though some fellows would much rather
 play the field as Jack the Lad.
Take their pleasure where they can
 avoid responsibility
The lack the guts to be a man 
despite their masculinity.
Real Dads are made of sterner stuff. 
Take their duties seriously 
stay steadfast when the goings tough 
and always try their best to be.
The kind of Dad who’s firm but fair.
But best of all He’s always there.



Parky the penguin felt so low, 
He didn’t really like the snow, 
Or the blustery winds that blow
Across his icy world.

Parky the penguin thought that he
Would find a boat and go to sea, 
He needed to be wild and free, 
Gone from his icy world.

Parky the penguin sailed away, 
Spotted a sunny sandy bay, 
Where he could laze around all day.
Unlike his icy world.

Parky the penguin got so hot, 
And could not find one shady spot, 
He knew he was a daft crackpot, 
Leaving his icy world.

Parky the penguin hitched a ride, 
On a tiny raft, narrow not wide, 
And reaching home, had verified, 
He’d missed his icy world.

Parky the penguin hugged his Mum, 
Then skidded off upon his tum, 
His escapade was not humdrum, 
Nor was his icy world.


may be in my life,
how well things are going,
my body and soul
are two cliff peaks
from which a dream of who I can be
falls, and I must learn 
to fly again each day,
or die.

Death draws respect 
and fear from the living.
Death offers 
no false starts. It is not
a referee with a pop-gun
at the startling 
of a hundred yard dash.

I do not live to retrieve
or multiply what my father lost
or gained.

I continually find myself in the ruins
of new beginnings,
uncoiling the rope of my life
to descend ever deeper into unknown abysses,
tying my heart into a knot 
round a tree or boulder,
to insure I have something that will hold me,
that will not let me fall.

My heart has many thorn-studded slits of flame
springing from the red candle jars.
My dreams flicker and twist
on the altar of this earth,
light wrestling with darkness,
light radiating into darkness,
to widen my day blue,
and all that is wax melts
in the flame-

I can see treetops

In Memoriam 
Victims of the Paris Massacre
November Oh, the nights in Paris! 
We have been temporary Parisians
for two weeks, and every hour
our delight is keener. We might
expect to be jaded, weary of nocturnal
pleasures, ready to sink into complacency
and complaint. But no exhaustion 
of body and soul assails us. We are like
pilgrims refreshed after reaching their goal, 
celebrating a festival of expectations, 
in a city where the clocks run backwards
giving us more time than we consume.

Just yesterday we bonded with strangers, 
all of us neighbors of the autumn night
which welcomed us, as if honey spilled out of
the moon's interior and fell to earth
along with its pale blue light
to sweeten everything it touched, 
flowing over us, making even the saddest 
person among us shine with simple pleasure.
After the concert, we shuffled toward the exit, 
pressed body to body, all of us smiling because
some inner delight in each of us stretched forth, 
blending together in the warmth of the moment.

When we hit the street, and the cold air
slapped our cheeks, we suddenly joined hands, 
and began to dance in a long line of revelers, 
twisting and swaying, singing snatches of songs, 
or just shouting our joy to the moon. Pedestrians
with other goals to reach joined our ranks, 
all of us laughing at the sheer nonsense
of all this frivolity. We became for that moment
what we are meant to be - one body becoming one soul.
And then almost as quickly as it began, 
the dance came to its end, as people hugged and separated.
And we dispersed, under the honeyed light of the moon. 

My therapist is an astrologer, 
with whom I have discussed the
merits of disbelief in free will.

Lacking free will does not
disobligate the guilty from
their responsibilities.

Their actions are accountable.

But it begs the question, 
if astrology can predict that
I will be a danger to myself
or others, should she have
one of us committed

The devil's nephew, it was said, came to earth
And made his bed with humans, long ago.

Now when she saw him, standing there. full girthed, 
Golden-haired, tall and handsome, bowing low, 
She stared. 'I will have his heart as mine' she 
Said. Next day she bought a potion, her fair
Hair she would make red, then on spending spree
She ordered gown of jewelled blue. Rarely
Next time a Ball was held she saw to it
That her appearance would be timed. At ten
In she went, and once his roving eyes had lit
On her, she knew success. He straightway came
Striding to her side, his arrogance aglow
With lust, ravage her he must that night. Games
Like these he knew. For hours they danced, so
The story goes, as morning rose he swept
Her into bed. It seemed her wily act
Had met it's goal. He did not prove inept.

Nine months passed. Birthing then a mutant child, 
Half human-devil, frame so strong it took
The then world by surprise, and drove it wild.
It grew gigantic, and it's heart forsook
Any love the mother gave, cravings placed
In rampaging monsterous ways. Appaling
Plans the devil made to sire a hybrid race
Of wicked giant men. But, came it's fall
No more - - - or have you found it otherwise? 


Genesis - Chapter  

I picked a dangerous rose
Thorny, precious and sweet
Without blood there is no love


My pain grows and my heart sinks, 
When far away in the sky a star blinks, 
The star of my life is about to sink, 
And when about it I impatiently think, 
I grow restless with the heat of sentiments, 
My vivacity departs and my soul bends, 
When I go to Him with my accounts sinful, 
I couldn't do my duty towards Him, 
The prospects of my acquital is dim, 
I live my life in earning n spending, 
All my good deeds are still pending, 
I have reached on the sharp turn of life, 
I don't know when I will end this strife, 
The world is drawing me towards it, 
It seems I will not get respite a bit, 
I came in this world but all alone, 
My loneliness has forever gone, 
I am crushed under the burden of ties, 
I don't know where my destination lies, 
Friends and foes are alike to me, 
Both wound me with emotional glee, 
And allow me a pleasant and fair concession.>The General stood looking in the mirror
Perfectly attired, Cap a Pied.
He turned to me and said
'We must not delay this, Mister Marshall.
This bitter cup that fate has handed me'
I handed him his sword in silence.
We'd be fighting in the hills
Were it up to me, 
but even I knew that our men
were starving, Surrounded, 
there could be no victory.

Traveler was mounted in an instant
Few looked finer on a horse than
Our Robert Lee.
Under flag of truce we rode
to the Mc


Lean House, 
there to await the modern Ulysses.

Grant rode up dressed in a Sergent's uniform, 
mud splattered, 
His shoulder straps the only hint
of rank.
He looked more like the man
who had been beaten
Than General Lee who had to play that part.
He took Lee's white gloved hand, offered in greeting
both men's faces  etched with suffering, I saw.
They reminisced  about their other meeting, 
when both served Scott in the Mexican  War.
Then General Lee asked Grant
to state terms of surrender.
They sat down and, in short order, 
ended the unpleasantness of war.

The Victor was generous to the Vanquished: 
No Rebel would be tried, or lose their home.
The men permitted to retain their side arms
Rations fed to men of skin and bone.
We'd Stack the drums and cannon in the field
Give our parole despite our internal pain
There were troops still in the field but it was over
April Ninth, a dark day without rain. 

Say we can meet
in the astral place, 
then I can travel
deaths dark corridoor
with some dignity
and grace.
If your bright light shines
fore or aft, 
I'll know I'm safe in spirit
and night will pass
into beams of brightness.

And yours will be
the might I see
when I wander eternity.
Then if your own
sweet chariot should pass me
with its wheels of flame, 
I shall be warmed, 
and then I'll live again. 

Among my dead father's papers, 
a sepia photo of a girl. 
The inscription on the back, 
'С а м м а й .. oт .. С в е т л а н ы '.

Made me wonder, 
if somewhere in a Russian town, 
at the back of a dark drawer, 
there is a photo of my father, 
with the inscription. 

'Svetlana.. 

from.. 

Sammy'. 

A dark moon rising
almost as black as coal
nothing can be done
to save the world

The only way forward
is backwards


You asked 
if I had 
a dark side.

Most of my life 
has been lived 
on the dark side.


But I always 
believed in the power 
and cosmic beauty 
of solar energy 
radiant vibrant stellar 
life giving light.


You asked 
if I had 
a dark side.

Most of my life 
has been lived 
on the dark side.


Yet my heart and soul were 
no part of the madness 
the blackness the void 
except as reluctant captive 
resisting the entombing life 
depleting molasses dark side.


Can be switch off and to do it quick.
This darkness that's been turned on, 
Can be turned off with a doing it.
A darkness that's been turned on, 
For so long
Can be gone.

Too many minds are getting sick, 
In darkness that has started.
Who suggested there's a benefit, 
In darkness that has started.
Where's the switch, 
To flip what's started.
Leaving people more psychotic.
Where's the switch, 
To flip what's started.
Leaving people more neurotic.
Flip the switch! 
Flip the switch! 

A darkness that's been turned on, 
Can be switch off and to do it quick.
This darkness that's been turned on,

A darkness that's been turned on, 
For so long

Flip the switch!

Where's the switch, 
To flip what's started.
Leaving people more psychotic.
Where's the switch,

Leaving people more neurotic.
Flip the switch! 
Flip the switch! 

Robotic and hypnotic in a darkness that has started! 
Where's the switch, 
To end neurotic people getting more psychotic.
Where's the switch, 
In people's minds that have them blinded to these times.
Flip the switch, 
To turn back on the light to help them find. 
An end to darkness to be fed on to feed.

A darkness that's been turned on long, 
Will leave people to grieve on.
And on, 
Not to be gone.
A darkness that's been turned on long, 
Will leave people to grieve on.
And on, 
Not to be gone.
But prolonged.A darting fear—a pomp—a tear—
A waking on a morn
To find that what one waked for,
Inhales the different dawn. 

A date with destiny seems like
a twist of fate.
A date with decisions seems
like a struggle of vices & virtues.
A date with a life a new
is a beginning for the new born.
A date of judgement is a
life experience of pain or
pleasure. 

with Dracula
I've a date tonight
we'll be out late
and get a bite.

such a gentle man -
he gets a chill
whenever he hears
that blood was spilled'Konkani Mai Ascends the Throne'
(Hyperlinks are highly recommended to grasp the aura of this poem)     

On the horizon is a winding road.
Bent ol man is lugging his load.

Far out to sea; a billowing sail.
The peacock struts an lends a wail.

The distant hills a beauteous view
Mid morn it is, and where the crew? 

Sky an the earth meet and end.
oh! Saladin go, an for them send.

Haven't got all day to sit an wait
Pooch won't be bathed at this rate

Horses are restless back in the barn
The gypsy girls are out picking corn

A commotion near the outhouse there
Pushpa hurry! Go get Ramsingh here

Ah Hariram; the postman is cycling in
Oh! Ramsingh check that infernal din

Excuse mem-sb it's the Konkani binge
They've stolen the Mai's cartage sling

No wonder my! They are so upset, 

Pushpa's full of mysterious lure
Let it happen? I might have a cure

Agustus hasn't felt me, in this year.
I Wonder now, how long can I bear? 

Hariram Ah! you have this wad
He looks well built an yes so sad

The sweat has run, down his shirt
Muscled leg's, have caught some dirt


Starched turban, whistle an rap
Brawny like a fruit tree full of sap.

Ya.. 

uh.. 

umm it's a letter from mum
Hariram! Oh! Why don't you come? 

I've got this carton that you'll pack
Phuspa's sneaky, the witching hack

She's ebony black an white her teeth
Well endowed and braids like a wreath

I know she's caught Augustus' eye
Mass at Basilica, he left on the sly

She's so earthy with heathen ways
Wherefore now the inquisition days

Hariram here hold me up the stool
Bother I think, he can't be a fool

Oh come on Hariram; a little bit up
His eyes I saw, were a brimming cup

Gingerly at first he held my back
Rasped me then, against the rack

My legs went weak, and I drooped
Lowered me down and slowly stooped

In a flash it hit me, a punch of whiff
By myside I felt him, eager an stiff

Breathed he heavy in an guttural hiss
Taught me the meaning of earthly bliss

My elation's path sullied in dirt
No taboos chain, raunch and flirt

lay I ravished an the stair creaked
knew well Pushpa, what I seaked

(April I met Pamela Anderson and we went on a date.
She was very becoming and everything went great.
It was an honor to date this star.
I made her forget about Tommy Lee and it wasn't hard.

When I first asked her out, she decided to resist.
But at the end of our date she and I kissed.
As I popped the question, I got down on one knee and begged.
And you're most likely aware that I'm pulling your leg. 

Although she is moving out
She'll never be far away
She'll always live here with me
In my heart each day

Hopefully I taught her
The right things along the way
To help her make the right decisions
Each and every day

The most important thing 
That she should know
That if things don't work out
She always has a place to go

Though she no longer lives here
This will always be her home
The warm and kindest place
Her heart has ever known

A place where the welcome mat
Is always put out
A place that she can run to
When she's filled with doubt

It's so very hard to let her go
But I know that I must
I have so much faith in her
And a world of trust

I know she's smart enough
To make it on her own
It's hard to admit 
My little girl has finally grown

I hope she knows in her heart
Just how much I care
Because  every time she needed me
I always tried to be there

I hope she knows if life gets tough
And she should need a friend
That she can always count on me
Until the very end

It's never very easy
Watching someone you love leave
I know that I must be strong
But silently I'll grieve

Someone who's been around
Morning, noon and night
No longer having her here
Just will not seem right

But she knows I love her
With all of my heart
And it's that love
That will never let us part






The loss of a child
Emotions run so deep
Your pain is running wild


The hurt will heal
In due time
But forever she'll live
Always in your mind

Try not to dwell 
On how she died
But try remember
The times at her side

Remember the years
When she was young
Remeber the times
When you two had fun


She'll be in your thoughts
Each and every day
The memory of her
Will never fade away

No matter what you do
No matter where you go
Images of her
In your mind will always glow






And wake when night is chilly
Beneath the comfortless cold moon;
A fool to pluck my rose too soon,
A fool to snap my lily.

My garden-plot I have not kept;
Faded and all-forsaken,
I weep as I have never wept:
Oh it was summer when I slept,
It's winter now I waken.

Talk what you please of future spring
And sun-warm'd sweet to-morrow:
Stripp'd bare of hope and everything,
No more to laugh, no more to sing,
I sit alone with sorrow. 

I know part of the Secret
resides in this room.
The whole house, all four floors, 
partakes of the Secret, the way
the whole loaf nourishes
a multitude. I sit very still, 
because no other imperative
nudges me into some alien action
abroad, or down the street, 
or in that corner on my left, 
where a high-backed chair
with green upholstery and wide arms
once stood. Its legs left a crease
in the plush carpet, but no one can
tell me what happened to it.
It was the chair I sat in
for my First Communion. And sitting
in that chair, my father read to me, 
TRISTRAM SHANDY, his favorite novel, 
and poems by Borges, in Spanish
and in English. I have the books
still; I lost the chair and the man, 
my father, who was good to me. 
I sat on a low chair and looked
up into his calm blue eyes, and
sometimes thought he was creating
those words himself, each one 
born in a flash, just before his lips
shaped the sounds that made the words
live in my mind. From that moment
forward, those words were pieces of Time
Unending. Until I die and join him, 
once again a family, my memory of his
voice guides me through the darkness and
the light. Oh, but where is that chair? 
Where is that comfort, that fullness
that was mine, when the world was just
a man speaking and a child listening? 
Somewhere in this room resides the Secret
of those times. Perhaps it has been absorbed
by the breathing of the walls, or the pulse-beat
of the carpet, or the swirling of the air.
My father, those are your traces, aren't they? 
You never left me, not entirely. Your soul is
so large it occupies both worlds at once.
Part of you resides with the angels, and
another part swirls through the air I breathe.

A daughter is beauty at its finest.
Heart of an angel, soul so pure, and sweet.
Angels in Heaven do not compare to thine beauty, and grace my ever so beautiful, and lovely  daughter.
Seeing you at birth brought more joy to me 
than all the money in the world could ever do.
You are morning, bright, and shining, 
you are noon, you reside at the highest point in my heart, 
 you are the dew kissed night.
You are my daughter, heart, and soul. 

The man who has ransacked, 
My heart with a whip of the eyelash, 
Gone and hid from the scene of passion crime, 
Leaving the heartless human hauntingly alone, 	
Searching for him in the empty fields and barns, 
Really a bane, the rats have the nest and the young, 
The love making sun exerts the great heat, 
The saplings are browned, cowardly futile, 
Nocturnal creatures are awake, 
Prancing for the drops from the sweat, 
People gather in every other square, 
Those are named after every other dream, 
Sugar canes are no more rigid, oozing out the sweet, 
The birds have the floppy wings, yet to pick up the speed, 
The land is ready to be abandoned, waiting for the new grooms, 
They may fly through the wind holding the vacuum, 
To suck the nectar this has no mitochondrial power house, 
We are weak, overwhelmed, tired and the skeletons, 
The mother earth’s dear children, but the reminders of corruption, 
The persons, who have ransacked our hearts with a thumb print, 
Are in the celebration mood to invite another phase of spring, 
We are very weak, tired, hungry and thirsty for unpredictable future. 

A dawn of a new day
Like moment that never pass
Is function of Earth and Sun
And that’s my scientific guess

A dawn of a new day
From a fiery red bull’s eye
It streams a life-giving force
Like a baby newborn’s cry

A dawn of a new day
Is marked by a rising sun
That’s shining its golden rays
So life on Earth could have begun

A dawn of a new day
I greet you with all my heart
Just keep coming back in the morning
Make sure at dusk you depart

***
December his might be a vague emotion, 
For the exaggeration I carry for you.
Wild are your movements and, 
Natural goes your artistic world, 
It's the cycle I don't understand, 
But I love never to understand.

Believe me to believe you and, 
Acknowledge you for living me.
I live when I see you breathe, 
I breathe when I hear you live.
We breathe,  we live in a home,  room of own, 
Not knowing much but ourselves.

I never try to know much as you know, 
Nor I wish to know as less we know. 

Dated: 

One fourth of century, 
Half of my life, 
I have lived, 
Twenty seven. 

Thousands of people and relations, 
More of the work, 
I have experienced, 
Betrayal. 

More of my living, 
Less of my work, 
I see my future, 
Constant. 

If this is the last, 
Before I stop, 
I wish to say, 
I am in love with you. 

Dated: 

Insist on the impossible, 
be convinced to dream; 

Obtain cast-iron conviction
and durable discipline; 

Discover a hundred thousand
words for yes, 
eliminate every negative phrase; 

Be drunk on ecstatic joy
and revel in the truth of human potential; 

The future is yours to secure, 
fortune is smiling over the horizon. 

Long before critical thinking among the masses
Stories were passed down without consideration
Is this true? 
What are the facts? 
Does this hold veracity? 
Or is it simply a wish, a fable? 
No experiential validity
A two thousand year old tale
Told and told again til believed
Many such tales exist among cultures
A hero, a savior
There are no saints
Afterlife, a comforting delusion
Human nature invents, fills in gaps, wishes
No proof is needed
Only belief based on fear
Colored eggs distract
Churches fill only on this day
Show me otherwise and I will consider


On a sunny brae, alone I lay
One summer afternoon;
It was the marriage-time of May
With her young lover, June. 

From her mother's heart, seemed loath to part
But her father smiled on the fairest child
He ever held in his arms. 

The trees did wave their plumy crests,
The glad birds caroled clear;
And I, of all the wedding guests,
Was only sullen there! 

There was not one, but wished to shun
My aspect void of cheer;
The very grey rocks, looking on,
Asked, "What do you here?" 

And I could utter no reply;
In sooth, I did not know
Why I had brought a clouded eye
To greet the general glow. 

So, resting on a heathy bank,
I took my heart to me;
And we together sadly sank
Into a reverie. 

We thought, "When winter comes again,
Where will these bright things be?
All vanished, like a vision vain,
An unreal mockery! 

The birds that now so blithely sing,
Through deserts, frozen dry,
Poor spectres of the perished spring,
In famished troops, will fly. 

And why should we be glad at all?
The leaf is hardly green,
Before a token of its fall
Is on the surface seen!" 

Now, whether it were really so,
I never could be sure;
But as in fit of peevish woe,
I stretched me on the moor. 

A thousand thousand gleaming fires
Seemed kindling in the air;
A thousand thousand silvery lyres
Resounded far and near: 

Methought, the very breath I breathed
Was full of sparks divine,
And all my heather-couch was wreathed
By that celestial shine! 

And, while the wide earth echoing rung
To their strange minstrelsy,
The little glittering spirits sung,
Or seemed to sing, to me. 

"O mortal! mortal! let them die;
Let time and tears destroy,
That we may overflow the sky
With universal joy! 

Let grief distract the sufferer's breast,
And night obscure his way;
They hasten him to endless rest,
And everlasting day. 

To thee the world is like a tomb,
A desert's naked shore;
To us, in unimagined bloom,
It brightens more and more! 

And could we lift the veil, and give
One brief glimpse to thine eye,
Thou wouldst rejoice for those that live,
Because they live to die
 


The music ceased; the noonday dream,
Like dream of night, withdrew;
But Fancy, still, will sometimes deem
Her fond creation true. 

My eyes make pictures when they're shut:--
I see a fountain large and fair,
A Willow and a ruined Hut,
And thee, and me, and Mary there.
O Mary! make thy gentle lap our pillow!
Bend o'er us, like a bower, my beautiful green Willow!

A wild-rose roofs the ruined shed,
And that and summer well agree
And lo! where Mary leans her head,
Two dear names carved upon the tree!
And Mary's tears, they are not tears of sorrow:
Our sister and our friend will both be here to-morrow.

'Twas Day! But now few, large, and bright
The stars are round the crescent moon!
And now it is a dark warm Night,
The balmiest of the month of June!
A glow-worm fallen, and on the marge remounting
Shines, and its shadow shines, fit stars for our sweet fountain.

O ever -- ever be thou blest!
For dearly, Asra! love I thee!
This brooding warmth across my breast,
This depth of tranquil bliss -- ah me!
Fount, Tree, and Shed are gone, I know not whither,
But in one quiet room we three are still together.

The shadows dance upon the wall,
By the still dancing fire-flames made;
And now they slumber, moveless all!
And now they melt to one deep shade!
But not from me shall this mild darkness steal thee:
I dream thee with mine eyes, and at my heart I feel thee!

Thine eyelash on my cheek doth play--
'Tis Mary's hand upon my brow!
But let me check this tender lay,
Which none may hear but she and thou!
Like the still hive at quiet midnight humming,
Murmur it to yourselves, ye two beloved women

Chequer'd with woven shadows as I lay 
Among the grass, blinking the watery gleam, 
I saw an Echo-Spirit in his bay 
Most idly floating in the noontide beam. 
Slow heaved his filmy skiff, and fell, with sway 
Of ocean's giant pulsing, and the Dream, 
Buoyed like the young moon on a level stream 
Of greenish vapour at decline of day, 
Swam airily, watching the distant flocks 
Of sea-gulls, whilst a foot in careless sweep 
Touched the clear-trembling cool with tiny shocks, 
Faint-circling; till at last he dropt asleep, 
Lull'd by the hush-song of the glittering deep, 
Lap-lapping drowsily the heated rocks. 

There isn't a day that goes by. That I don't try to think about the kids that were so cruel to me. They didn't realy know that they were  doing to me would hurt me. written Posted 



A Day! Help! Help! Another Day!
Your prayers, oh Passer by!
From such a common ball as this
Might date a Victory!
From marshallings as simple
The flags of nations swang.
Steady—my soul: What issues
Upon thine arrow hang

It will not always be like this, 
The air windless, a few last
Leaves adding their decoration
To the trees’ shoulders, braiding the cuffs
Of the boughs with gold; a bird preening

In the lawn’s mirror. Having looked up
From the day’s chores, pause a minute, 
Let the mind take its photograph
Of the bright scene, something to wear
Against the heart in the long cold. 

There was this day
That I'll always remember
This day in December

To be honest I wasn't 
Expecting it all
When I turned up at my dance class
Photo shoot call

It was at my friend's house
We got a fab photo
Shut up and Dance
On the radio

Hugs and kisses
Ready to go
Her boyfriend's sly looks
And you on my phone

Standing outside
My taxi is due
Passing the time
Talking to you

I'll never forget
And always remember
How you made my day
My day in December



Earlier this morning, hundreds of thousands flooded St. Peter's Square, forming crescent-moon crowds around giant video screens. Basking in an emotional send-off at his final general audience, the pope stressed, 'Loving the church also means having the courage to take difficult and anguished choices, . '

With an emotionless look on her pale face, Mary stared at the TV screen in her rented attic room. As a white cloud of doves ascends into the sky and circles the square, cries of "Viva il Papa! " burst from the crowds.


'did you weep
when I was abused? '
she asks
with trembling hands. 


Notes: 

"Viva il Papa! " means 'Long live the Pope! '


Cheeks dimpling
Two eyes gleam
Lips parting.
Baby's smiling.


Nose crinkling
Red mouth curls
Eyes are twinkling.
Baby's clowning.


Toes  gripping
Two knees bend.
Feet are moving, 
Baby's walking.


Mind wandering, 
Gaze intense, 
Brow is puckering, 
Baby's 'pottying'


Lips smacking, 
Two jaws race, 
Cheeks are bulging, 
Baby's eating.


Head bobbing, 
Fingers twirl, 
Knees are knocking, 
Baby's dancing.


Eyes closing, 
Two hands still.
Senses dozing, 
Ssssh - Baby's sleeping. 

Just like a number of months before, 
I awoke from a terrible dream
screaming
I took the next few moments of haze then 
scrambling for my bearings
Just a dream, or a warning? 
too soon to tell, yet
already
program running out of my skull. 
And just like that, 
I've armed myself with my old ways
and off to great start to a brand new day

Collecting my thoughts came
easier after the haze of sleep left
And I looked over to you
where you were sleeping
like a baby
Rising within me was not
the fuzzy warm feelings of love
but old regrets and resentments
Somehow I'm to live with your
mistakes
randomly yoking me up from sleep
as if I were a slave
A slave, in fact, to a terrible master.

I kicked myself for throwing the
blankets off, and I shivered
and for a moment it felt as if the
cold
could crystallize my tears
A passing thought to check
your cell phone occurred to me
but I swore my sleuthing days were over
dammit. 
for the steps I take within that deed
promises
the serenity that I need.

Shedding some light
hopefully to my thoughts
as well as my room
I reached over my nightstand
for the lamp and my book
I believe the best way to
use such a book
is by way of 'divining'. 
for my two thumbs to part the pages
and let the sages of those before me
speak the words
in the language only we
understood.

I searched for the meaning within
closed my eyes, hugged my book
hoping
that I could gain the wisdom-
that somehow if I could unlock it
with the right key
it would be mine. 
Vaguely I sensed someone watching
and looked down beside me
and saw your eyes
You asked if I was ok
my answer was 'it's a work in progress'. 
Which is the truth.
And I think back to my reading and realized. 

Past is past, what's done is done. 
Even as hard as one works it
We're still a walking time bomb
We've got some time
now
under our belt
and although the old habits within us still surface, 
and all the hurt that's ever felt, 
He goes into his room
and I into mine
the separation within that important 
hour
will help both of us find-
Strength of self, 
and strength even together
Equipped with this, 
things can only get better
The two of us working this
go so very much hand in hand
I tell people it's the way of broken 
marriages
but before hocked wedding bands. 
I know I've hurt you
and I'm sorry if I ever did
I've my own master, and disease
rid
I pray for you every night
that you too find your way. 
I love you with all my heart, 
forever and a day.

'Keep coming back, it works if you work it, 
so work it, you're worth it! ! '


Thick and oppressive
The blanket of despair
I know so well, 
Envelopes me, shutting out
My usual self.

It cannot be explained.
The usual comebacks, 
'Everybody feels down'
Tells me I have failed, 
Once again to plead
For help.


I am fearful and tearful
I think only in the negative
I think largely of death.
Sadness for no reason.

Books and music have no excitement
I am reduced to tears
By a helpful hand 
So helpless
I look for help
And find none.

My salvation is the referral
For professional help
Sedation and gentle treatment
Help me.
I am on a path to freedom. 


I wake up in the morning and pull back the curtains, wide, 
And look out through the window to view the world outside, 
To see if the sky is blue or grey, sunny or with rain, 
And see if the postman's on his way with letters that contain, 
News of family and friends, and more 'bills' by the way, 
Attempting to motivate the mind, and start another day.

With all the jobs I have to do before we leave the house, 
To get the breakfast going, for self and for my spouse, 
To put clothes in the washing machine, make sandwiches for lunch, 
And add some fruit and maybe also, some biscuits we can munch.
To load the car with coats and bags, and other odds and ends, 
And quickly venture off to work and see what the day sends.

With people wanting this and that and taking orders for
Various kinds of merchandise which we might have in store, 
Writing down their preferences for all their different needs, 
Sorting out the dates and times, working at different speeds.
Busy as we move along, through the hours set for work, 
Having no time to rest awhile, there is no time to shirk.


The telephone keeps ringing, the doorbell's buzzing too, 
I'd really love a cup of tea, but what am I to do, 
There's 'can I have', 'would you please' and 'could you just this once', 
I'm really getting hungry, my stomach, how it grunts.
There's 'what's the time? ' and 'must get done' before we start to close, 
And having stood the whole day long, there's the pain that's in my toes.

Out go the lights, down come the blinds, it's time to pack away, 
All the paperwork and goods that we have used today, 
Sweep the floor, dust the shelves, check orders already placed, 
Tidy everything away, and clear the bags of waste.
Switch off the lights, set the alarm, close and lock the door, 
Jump in the car, slip off the shoes, now the toes are really sore.

Here's home at last but there's no rest yet, the washing in the drum
Must be hung up, so here we go.  My feet are going numb.
There's vacuuming, and ironing, the meal to prepare and cook, 
Oh, how I would love to just sit down and quietly read a book.
At last it's time to climb the stairs, I'm ready for my bed, 
Until a 'certain' alarm, shatters the sweet dreams in my head.


at your record on the doctor's desk
or a letter not meant for you.
How could you have known? It's not true
that your life passes before you
in rapid motion, but your watch
suddenly ticks like an amplified heart,
the hands freezing against a white
that is a judgment. Otherwise nothing.
The face in the mirror is still yours.
Two men pass on the sidewalk
and do not stare at your window.
Your room is silent, the plants
locked inside their mysterious lives
refuses to bloom, does not accept
your definition. It makes no sense,
your scanning the street for a traffic snarl,
a new crack in the pavement,
a flag at half-mast -- signs
of some disturbance in the world
because your friend, the morning sun,
has turned its dark side toward you. 


Although you're not with us, physically, 
We can sense you here, literally.

Your body might have decayed, 
But your soul forever remains.

When your eyes we gave away
the day you could no longer stay, 
All I wished for was your sincere eyes
to show the world to a man in need
with pure honesty and no lies.

We miss you more and more every day, 
And oh, how we long to say your name
and hear you call us back.


I wish you were here so I could hug you
Like every other girl hugs her father any time of any day.
But how I wish it were another man
(whom He took away.) 

If it is true that you can listen to what we say to you, 
I hope you acknowledge that this is true: 

Dad, 
My heart aches at the thought of you gone
and I wish to see you again, sometime in the long run.
Almost two years through, 
And it feels like it was just yesterday that pain started seeping through.
I am aware that Heaven brought peace upon your suffering heart
and that in every minute on Earth you felt anguish
and that wishing you survived is probably selfish
of my part,   
But I wish you survived and let someone else die. 
However, that does not count, 
Since what is done is done and is irreversible.
So I hope, from the bottom of my little heart, 
That peace finds your way
and rest nestles in your mind, 
Knowing that we are alright.


I love you,
and it hurts how much I miss you, 

We love you forever and ever. 

I utilize every opportunity that i get, 
because i believe everything happens for a reason. 


I took a day off
To lie in my despair
I took a day off from pretending
To dwell on the fact that life
Really isn't fair 

I didn't bother hiding the fact 
That I was in the midst of misery
I didn't care who saw 
So for the first time I cried openly 

I didn't want to get out of bed
I just wanted the world to go away
Because there really wasn't anything 
Anyone could say to make me feel okay

That day was one much needed 
But didn't last long 
And when I woke up the next morning
My day of despair had ended
So I got out of bed 
And my life continued on


It was such a lovely sunshine-day,
 The house and the yard couldn't hold me;
I roved to the woods, on my back I lay,
 In cradle of fancy rolled me;
But there were ants, and gnats that bite,
The horse-fly was keen, the wasp showed fight.

 "Dear me, don't you want to be out in this fine
weather?" --said mother, who sat on the steps and sang.

It was such a lovely sunshine-day,
 The house and the yard couldn't hold me;
A meadow I found, on my back I lay,
 And sang what my spirit told me;
Then snakes came crawling, a fathom long,
To bask in the sun,--I fled with my song.

 "In such blessed weather we can go barefoot,"--said mother,
as she pulled off her stockings.

It was such a lovely sunshine-day,
 The house and the yard couldn't hold me;
I loosened a boat, on my back I lay,
 While blithely the current bowled me;
But hot grew the sun, and peeled my nose;
Enough was enough, and to land I chose.

 "Now these are just the days to make hay in,"-- said mother,
as she stuck the rake in it.

It was such a lovely sunshine-day,
 The house and the yard couldn't hold me;
I climbed up a tree, oh, what bliss to play,
 As cooling the breeze consoled me;
But worms soon fell on my neck, by chance,
And jumping, I cried: "'T is the Devil's own dance!"

 "Yes, if the cows aren't sleek and shiny to-day, they'll
never be so,"--said mother, gazing up the hillside.

It was such a lovely sunshine-day,
 The house and the yard couldn't hold me;
I dashed to the waterfall's endless play,
 There only could peace enfold me.
The shining sun saw me drown and die,--
If you made this ditty, 't was surely not I.

 "Three more such sunshine-days, and everything will
be in,"--said mother, and went to make my bed. 

Whereon shall no man work, but play;
Whereon it is enough for me,
Not to be doing, but to be! 


Through every fibre of my brain,
Through every nerve, through every vein,
I feel the electric thrill, the touch
Of life, that seems almost too much. 

I hear the wind among the trees
Playing celestial symphonies;
I see the branches downward bent,
Like keys of some great instrument. 

And over me unrolls on high
The splendid scenery of the sky,
Where though a sapphire sea the sun
Sails like a golden galleon, 

Towards yonder cloud-land in the West,
Towards yonder Islands of the Blest,
Whose steep sierra far uplifts
Its craggy summits white with drifts. 

Blow, winds! and waft through all the rooms
The snow-flakes of the cherry-blooms!
Blow, winds! and bend within my reach
The fiery blossoms of the peach! 

O Life and Love! O happy throng
Of thoughts, whose only speech is song!
O heart of man! canst thou not be
Blithe as the air is, and as free

Thanks for beautiful blue skies
Thanks for fragrant air silently filling the garden
Thanks for colorful fall leaves
Swirling and dancing through air even in their demise
The smell of earth mingled with scent of life
Still emitted from fallen leaves
Thanks for crisp afternoon sunshine
Filtering through bare trees
Thanks for little birds’ morning chorus-
Busy squirrel’s ritual of nibbling on acorns 
And depositing some underground
Thanks for my ears and my eyes to be able to watch
This wondrous sight
Thanks for my family and friends
Most of all thanks for this happy state of mind
Receptive to the simple joys of the day
I need not know whom to thank-
It is enough to know that I have so much to be thankful for. 


Please help me! 
Don't leave me be! 
Please help me or I won't make it.
I can't take it! 

My life is screwed over now, 
so I'll just take my bow.
I'm finished and over
so you can run me over.

I can't see to get up any more 
are you keeping the score? 
What score? My life score because we're in a fight.
It's been days since I've seen the light! 

Won't you help me? 
Please help me.
I'm ruined once more.
Ruined once more. 


A DAY'S WORK

A day's work
A few lines
An old man
Makes life easy
For himself.

What if the lines do not live
The old man will not live forever also.

A few lines
A pleasant sunny day
A grandchild to be taken home
From gan.

An easy life 
A happy life
Another day. 

You came here

without a single fear.

 

On your way you brought your return-ticket, 

but you better not lose your wicket.

 


There is only one match to be played, 

So just hope there is no disturbance from any raid.

 

Win the toss, 

& be the boss.

 

Or lose the toss, 

& show off your gloss.

 

Be a bowler, 

bowl it slower.

 

Be a batsman, 

with a direct hit to heaven.

 

Disturb the clouds, 

their anger all so aroused.

 

Bring on the covers, 

& become lovers.

 

Love the match delay, 

one that you've got without the obligation to pay.

 

Remember your spouse, 

who's always watching you from her house.

 

Take her name, 

& resume the game.

 

The target is nearing, 

& so is the balls remaining.

 

Score that victorious six, 

With emotions all so mixed.

 

With the game now over, 

The crowd won't get any louder.

 

Appreciate them, 

& place them at your success' strong stem.

 


Now its time to pack, 

& take all those memories back.



Tell them to your friends, 

In conversations that seem to have no ends.



Treasure that two-way ticket.

Keep it, conserve it, caress it. 

Never does a mother forget, that miracle of birth, 
It stays within her memory, 
With the last and with her first.

Nine long months of waiting, 
For that bundle of joy to arrive, 
Then wondering how to raise it, 
While setting some of her life aside.

That was instilled in her from the start, 
She gives this little blessing of joy, 
All her loving trust and heart.

Time passes quickly,  
All childish things let go.
To become what you have taught them, 
And everything you know.


A day to take upon themselves, 
A spouse to start anew, 
Starting the process over again, 
Now the rest my child is up to you

Today would be the perfect day
to lay in bed and snuggle with you.
I'm so exhausted and I want to sleep
but I'll lay here still awhile yet.
I would love to snuggle and pass the time
with the woman I adore and want
to be with through all time.
Today would be the perfect day to snuggle
with my true and only Angel.

I would just love to spend this tired day
in bed with you talking and snuggling it away.
Just to be in the arms of my true love
would help give me peace and calm to fall asleep.
Today would be the perfect day to spend
in bed and snuggle with you my only one.
It would be perfect just because I would be with you.
Any time I spend with you is perfect time
because I love you dear and there is
no other way I'd rather spend my time than be with you.
I wish that you were here to lay in bed with me
and snuggle it away.
In your arms is the perfect place to ever be. 

This is the perfect day for us to sit and snuggle.
I can feel that you're sad as am I
because we so badly and deeply are missing each other.
We need a day and many more to just sit
and snuggle while talking, kissing, 
crying the tears to wash away our sad loneliness, 
a day just to snuggle and enjoy the presence
and touch of each other to heal our hurt hearts
completely together.

This is a day to just snuggle my Angel
so feel my arms wrap around you as I reach out to hold.
Feel my sweet kisses and my warmth
as it fully surrounds and fills you.
I will also be holding your hand while I say
I so completely and fully love you my precious diamond.
You are the most wonderful amazing and beautiful woman
and I just want to hold you forever and ever.

Kira you are so loved and I want to
give you such reassurance in every way possible
and today is a day to just sit and snuggle
while I stroke your hair and just listen, 
talk, or sit in pure silence to give you that
which you so need and want.
We need a day to just hold each other
and forget the whole world as we make up for lost time.
I love you sweet lady you're my hero and best friend.

Kira I am always there with you so let's snuggle in spirit, 
give each other the comfort that's so very needed.
I miss you, want you, and need you because I so love you.
I want to give you everything that is possible, 
my heart is yours as is my soul and if you
didn't know my whole life is as well.
So Kira my darling let's spend this day in spirit
so tightly and lovingly snuggling with each other
and just know in our hearts that soon
we will be snuggling in person. 

The world is too loud for me
The quiet sleep never occurs in night
The refreshing dawn always confusing my mind
A sound that doesn't exist
A thought that doesn't have origin
Voices that become noise at the back of my head
I must take the control before I jump from my window
I must remember myself before I run to the forest
Screaming like a mad man
I should get them out from my jumbling memory
I must apply my rule before it turns tragedy
It is not my concern in the first place
It is not my business to get involved

The life is a torture to me
A consent without agreement
A fire without a cause
Does this inspiration come from mine? 
Could this feeling be real to me? 
The days become frightening
Because I don't know which one is true
Without even given a choice to reject
The story that is not for me to hear
The dream that is not my desire to lust
And I should keep replying in my mind over and over
Never get too close so I will not be lost
Never hope too high cause it never be right


I have nothing
I don't make something
I'm just stealing
What looks good but you don't notice
What is precious but you sadly waste
What interest me but you never give a damn

I don't need everything
I'm not obsessed with anything
I just love to see your face
When I take away your treasure
When you realize that you have lost it
When it feels better owned by me than you

I'm definitely not a good man
I'm not even honorable
You can see I'm just a dirty thief
Maybe I will lie to get your attention
Maybe I will cheat you after you swayed
But it is a trick part of the game

I don't want to be bored and lonely
I never ask to be labeled like most of society
And don't call me irresponsible
It is just based on my nature instinct
You just offer an intriguing challenge
And just blame it to your heart that so intricate to be conquered


I love my body
I like when I have most of control in my body
I have learned from my experience
When something dangerous coming inside
It will reject
When it needs rest immediately
It will alert
When we don't take care ourselves
It will protest
When we keep ignoring and pushing too hard
It will shut down
Sometimes we don't understand why our body doesn't cooperate
But don't think that it is a made up lie

I don't want to do exercise just because
I want to impress everyone
That I have perfect body
That I am more powerful
I don't need big muscle to show
I only need a strength to carry my groceries
I don't need to break the record of speed
I only need to efficiently use my time
I don't need vigorous stamina
I only need to not tire easily when working everyday
I don't need a gymnastic level
I only need to be able to move my body without pain
I don't need a body of supermodel
I only need a body that makes me comfortable and happy

I will never force someone to do any kind of sport
Just because I can do it
Just because I am doing those routine also
Because everybody is different
And has its own preference
Sometimes I'm too lazy to do any kind of practice
I love when practice gives me time to think
I love when practice makes me aware to move my body correctly
I even love when practice pushes my body to its limit
And I shouldn't care if I'm bathed with sweat
But it doesn't have to be done all day
Our body needs its own time to repair itself and fill again its energy
Not to be torturing with our neglect that we think we are undefeated
You will find the hard way that your body could break your plan easily


A day without poetry 
Is a lost day- 
A day without silence
Is a lost day also- 
A day without love 
Is the greatest loss of all-

Without Love
What is Life? 
Without Love, 
How can there be Poetry

How I long for pork roll, 
For the indescribable taste.
Any day without Taylor ham
Is really a bit of a waste. 

To you who’d read my songs of War 
And only hear of blood and fame, 
I’ll say (you’ve heard it said before) 
"War’s Hell!" and if you doubt the same, 
Today I found in Mametz Wood
A certain cure for lust of blood: 

Where, propped against a shattered trunk, 
In a great mess of things unclean, 
Sat a dead Boche; he scowled and stunk 
With clothes and face a sodden green,
Big-bellied, spectacled, crop-haired, 
Dribbling black blood from nose and beard. 

You got to know when to hold ‘em, know when to fold ‘em, 
Know when to walk away and know when to run.
You never count your money when you're sittin at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealins' done.

David Reese too young to fold, 
David Reese a popular jack of all trades when it came to poker, 
The bluffing, 
the betting, 
the skill that he played poker, 
- was his ace of his sleeve.
He played poker without deuces wild, 
not needing Jokers.
To bad his lungs were not flushed out for him to breathe, 
Was is the casino smoke? 
Or was it his lifestyle in general? 
But whatever the circumstance was, 
he cashed out to soon, 
he had gone to see his maker, 
He was relatively young far from being too old.

Now evr'y gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
'cause evr'y hands a winner and evr'y hands a loser, 
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.

David "Chip" Reese has been quoted as replying, 
"I'll stop playing at my funeral, 


And he did just that.

Because he knows what you deal with, 
- knows what your deal is, 
He knows your hand before you have one, 
And he has time bluff you, 
all eternity, 
and raise you,  
Till you have stood up and say you're done.

(between these two shores
i float like a dead leaf
am not dead either..
if i was i will not feel the pain

budded flowered and became  a fruit
on one shore
eaten and as a bare stray seed laid
at the other shore

as a seed i did germinate
the mother root grew into a tree
an off spring flower and fruit came by
all along as a seed i thought i was the tree itself

I NEVER THOUGHT I WILL LOOSE
MY IDENTITY AS A SEED
CAN A TREE SHOW ITS SEED
EVEN IF IT WANTS TO

ALL ALONG. 

I thought i was the tree itself
may be i was a part of each part
the stem to hold, the leaf to nourish
till fate wind blew me down as a dead leaf

today as a dead leaf i float
wanting a living from one shore
wanting relationship from the other
as a dead leaf i float.. 

am not dead with pain

ALL ALONG
I DID THINK I WAS THE TREE ITSELF
BEING JUST A SEED


at daybreak
Death has a boot
on my neck
the first line for him
I'm a slave to words

Who is really interested in reading your poetry?  A smirk on his face. 

I have nothing important to write, I say, All I can do is sit down at the computer and bleed. If no one reads it, you, Death, will be my reviewer. 

O Rose! who dares to name thee?
No longer roseate now, nor soft, nor sweet;
But pale, and hard, and dry, as stubble-wheat,---
     Kept seven years in a drawer---thy titles shame thee.

     The breeze that used to blow thee
Between the hedgerow thorns, and take away
An odour up the lane to last all day,---
     If breathing now,---unsweetened would forego thee.

     The sun that used to smite thee,
And mix his glory in thy gorgeous urn,
Till beam appeared to bloom, and flower to burn,---
     If shining now,---with not a hue would light thee.

     The dew that used to wet thee,
And, white first, grow incarnadined, because
It lay upon thee where the crimson was,---
     If dropping now,---would darken where it met thee.

     The fly that lit upon thee,
To stretch the tendrils of its tiny feet,
Along thy leaf's pure edges, after heat,---
     If lighting now,---would coldly overrun thee.

     The bee that once did suck thee,
And build thy perfumed ambers up his hive,
And swoon in thee for joy, till scarce alive,---
     If passing now,---would blindly overlook thee.

     The heart doth recognise thee,
Alone, alone! The heart doth smell thee sweet,
Doth view thee fair, doth judge thee most complete,---
     Though seeing now those changes that disguise thee.

     Yes, and the heart doth owe thee
More love, dead rose! than to such roses bold
As Julia wears at dances, smiling cold!---
     Lie still upon this heart---which breaks below thee

I could not dig; I dared not rob:
Therefore I lied to please the mob.
Now all my lies are proved untrue
And I must face the men I slew.
What tale shall serve me here among
Mine angry and defrauded young

I took a year out of my life and story—
A dead year, and said, 'I will hew thee a tomb! 
'All the kings of the nations lie in glory;'
Cased in cedar, and shut in a sacred gloom;
Swathed in linen, and precious unguents old;
Fainted with cinnabar, and rich with gold.

'Silent they rest, in solemn salvatory,
Sealed from the moth and the owl and the
flittermouse—
Each with his name on his brow.
'All the kings of the nations lie in glory,
Every one in his own house:'
Then why not thou?
 

 

'Year,' I said, 'thou shalt not lack
Bribes to bar thy coming back;
Doth old Egypt wear her best
In the chambers of her rest?
Doth she take to her last bed
Beaten gold, and glorious red?
Envy not! for thou wilt wear
In the dark a shroud as fair;
Golden with the sunny ray
Thou withdrawest from my day;
Wrought upon with colours fine
Stolen from this life of mine:
Like the dusty Libyan kings,
Lie with two wide-open wings
On thy breast, as if to say,
On these wings hope flew away;
And so housed, and thus adorned,
Not forgotten, but not scorned,
Let the dark for evermore
Close thee when I close the door;
And the dust for ages fall
In the creases of thy pall;
And no voice nor visit rude
Break thy sealed solitude.'
 

 

I took the year out of my life and story?
The dead year, and said, 'I have hewed thee a tomb!
'All the kings of the nations lie in glory,'
Cased in cedar, and shut in a sacred gloom;
But for the sword, and the sceptre, and diadem,
Sure thou didst reign like them.'
So I laid her with those tyrants old and hoary,
According to my vow;
For I said, 'The kings of the nations lie in glory,
And so shalt thou!'
 

 

'Rock,' I said, 'thy ribs are strong,
That I bring thee guard it long;
Hide the light from buried eyes—
Hide it, lest the dead arise.'
'Year,' I said, and turned away,
'I am free of thee this day;
All that we two only know,
I forgive and I forego,
So thy face no more I meet
In the field or in the street.'

Thus we parted, she and I;
Life hid death, and put it by;
Life hid death, and said, 'Be free!
I have no more need of thee.'
No more need!   O mad mistake,
With repentance in its wake!
Ignorant, and rash, and blind,
Life had left the grave behind;
But had locked within its hold
With the spices and the gold,
All she had to keep her warm
In the raging of the storm.

Scarce the sunset bloom was gone,
And the little stars outshone,
Ere the dead year, stiff and stark,
Drew me to her in the dark;
Death drew life to come to her,
Beating at her sepulchre,
Crying out, 'How can I part'
With the best share of my heart?
Lo, it lies upon the bier,
Captive, with the buried year.
O my heart!'   And I fell prone,
Weeping at the sealed stone;
'Year among the shades,' I said,
'Since I live, and then art dead,
Let my captive heart be free
Like a bird to fly to me.'
And I stayed some voice to win,
But none answered from within;
And I kissed the door—and night
Deepened till the stars waxed bright;
And I saw them set and wane.
And the world turned green again.

'So,' I whispered, 'open door,
I must tread this palace floor—
Sealed palace, rich and dim.
Let a narrow sunbeam swim
After me, and on me spread
While I look upon my dead;
Let a little warmth be free
To come after; let me see
Through the doorway, when I sit
Looking out, the swallows flit,
Settling not till daylight goes;
Let me smell the wild white rose,
Smell the woodbine and the may;
Mark, upon a sunny day,
Sated from their blossoms rise
Honey-bees and butterflies.
Let me hear, O! let me hear,
Sitting by my buried year,
Finches chirping to their young,
And the little noises flung
Out of clefts where rabbits play,
Or from falling water-spray;
And the gracious echoes woke
By man's work: the woodman's stroke,
Shout of shepherd, whistlings blithe,
And the whetting of the scythe;
Let this be, lest, shut and furled
From the well-beloved world,
I forget her yearnings old,
And her troubles manifold,
Strivings sore, submissions meet,
And my pulse no longer beat,
Keeping time and bearing part
With the pulse of her great heart.

So! swing open door, and shade
Take me, I am not afraid,
For the time will not be long;
Soon I shall have waxen strong—
Strong enough my own to win
From the grave it lies within.'

And I entered.   On her bier
Quiet lay the buried year;
I sat down where I could see
Life without and sunshine free,
Death within.   And I between,
Waited my own heart to wean
From the shroud that shaded her
In the rock-hewn sepulchre—
Waited till the dead should say,
'Heart, be free of me this day'—
Waited with a patient will—
AND I WAIT BETWEEN THEM STILL.
 

 

I take the year back to my life and story
The dead year, and say, 'I will share in thy tomb.
'All the kings of the nations lie in glory;'
Cased in cedar, and shut in a sacred gloom!
They reigned in their lifetime with sceptre and
diadem,
But then excellest them;
For life doth make thy grave her oratory,
And the crown is still on thy brow;
'All the kings of the nations lie in glory'
And so dost thou. 

A little while ago I was among them 
Smiling, talking and calling the life pleasure, 
I remember a twinge of pain in my chest
And then it was dark all around, 
I heard my loving ones crying and wailing, 
People asked one another, 'What happened to him? How did he die? ' 
Somebody replied, 'It was a heart attack.'
Somebody said, 
'It was so sudden that we could do nothing.' 
There was a lot of hustle and bustle around, 
After sometimes I was given a warm bath
And they wrapped me in the shroud, 
But I didn't feel any suffocation, 
It reminded me of something
When I was alive, I couldn't sleep covering my face 
for the fear of suffocation, 
Now it could hurt me no more.
I felt I was being carried away on the steal, 
People were enchanting sacred verses, 
They buried me with heavy hearts
And returned their homes.
Suddenly I woke up by the gentle pat of my wife, 
She was standing beside my bed saying, 'Wake up darling, the day has advanced.''A deafness too excessive.'
Are kept thoughts to think to myself, 
As I mingle.
But left to leave, 
My opinion unexpressed.
And without pre-conceived, 
Expectations.

A social gathering of merriment enjoyed.
And from overheard chit-chat tossed about, 
Nothing concrete, 
Sticks within these walls that matter.
Although representing and with prestige, 
Are those flaunting their 'titles'.
As if annointed through their professions.

And. 
From them I step aside.
I step away to go outside.
There I find fresh and crisp air.
'Unspoiled.' I want this to believe.
I want to believe it remains untainted.
Clear an unaffected by an innocence kept.

But. 
I have long stopped pretending, 
My sensitivity is a result. 
From being unaware and too naive.
Diversed is my experiences. 
To convince anyone, 
I re-act with a sensitivity to have that believed.

'A deafness too excessive.'
Are kept thoughts to think to myself, 
As I mingle.
But left to leave, 
My opinion unexpressed.
And without pre-conceived, 
Expectations.

'Perhaps my seriousness of life to take, 
To not comprehend why so many. 
Live theirs to fake, 
Is a delusion I can not shake? '
I question myself.
While sipping on champagne, 
To not have my inner thoughts suspected.

And maybe I am too sensitive, 
With it not to realized. 
What I see and hear to disbelieve, 
Is a 'reality' accepted amongst those. 
Who have successfully achieved, 
A deafness too excessive that has left. 
What I perceive to be reality, alone.

~You seem to be thinking with thoughts so deep.~

Not really.
I'm just quietly taking in the atmosphere.
The ambiance of it all.

~REALLY? 
I'm bored by it all, myself.
And I'm the host.
But don't hold that against me.
It's a routine.
If you know what I mean? ~

You're kidding? 

~If I could tell a joke I would.
I bet you have lots to say? 
Much more than the nonsense, 
I've already heard.
Success isn't all what it is 'dressed' to be.
Sometimes I feel like an outsider.
Pretending I want to be inside.
And craving to stay within the 'loop'.~

You 'might' want to cover your ears, first.
I only crave to stay who I am.

~LOL. 
I love it already.
Let's step outside.
Feel free to offend me as much as you please.
And trust me. 
You can say anything.
I'm not like the others who came with deaf ears.~

It is excessive. Overdone but impressive.

~Yes. It is.
But sometimes those impressions made, 
Can leave one in tears.~They got ready to shoot the scene, 
He unbuttoned her, 
Her nude body was shining like marbel, 
But her coyness was annoying him
She didn't seem to be habitual
In the trade
But she posed to be brave.  
They started making love amidst
Sweet moans, 
The lust of her snowy creamy skin, 
The touch of her soft luscious lips
Got him into the heaven of untamed desires, 
The cameras were moving, 
But ignoring them their hard work was continued, 
Now she was supporting the act
For she couldn't afford to miss that chance.
They were perspiring, 
tossing their bodies
And ultimately the summit was attained.
But while counting money
She began to groan saying 
'I have done it.'
He couldn't help cursing himself
When he came to know that
It was her first experience
And that her pestilence stricken son was 
On the verge of death for want of money.
She did it to earn money for her son's cure.
Hearing this he gave her all the money
He had earned that day. 

Nostalgia that arrests  the moments
Before they flee
Nudges its way into my consciousness
Walking  me  back to my  first look of  grace -
The dwelling place of my origins
Where voiceless  my spirit

Near but unattainable
Still  wanders wondering-
Speechless behold before we part.
Oh  thought  form.
A tie  Time cannot dissever. Only
What i've lost is  what i possess for ever. 

I have a dear friend on this site who
I appreciate so very much.
I often bother her too much and as I usually do, 
I ramble on more than I should, 
but she shows me patience and that makes me feel good.

I'm not a good man and I know that is true, 
I've caused problems and once lost my temper
and used language and attitude quite blue.
Yet after time and with a poem I apologized
and she loved it too.
I assume she still does and I really hope
because I put my heart in it's soul.

Sandra Feldman is a good friend to me, 
like so very few out there she listens to me, 
doesn't mock me or get mad when I talk about Kira too.
That means more than she can ever know.
something not done or received from many by me, 
I thank you Sandra you're a true friend to me.

Sandra's poetry is so beautiful, striking, 
and truly heart and soul touching.
It's one of the very few things that keeps me coming back.
She respects me just as I do her, 
Sandra is a true friend and I'm happy to have her.

Sandra you have a beautiful heart and soul, 
you've been there for me and I will always be here for you.
I'm not a good person or man but you treat me equal
and that means more that you can ever know.
I apologize for those things I did wrong.
Sandra you're a great friend and I thank you so much. 

Dear Jane; 
This card I'm sending may make you blue, 
I hate to admit it, but I don't love you. 
There's another woman in my life, 
and I've asked her to be my wife. 
She has a boy, he is my son, 
he thinks that I am number one. 
Please don't shed any tears for me, 
I'm not worth the misery. 

The snot ran slowly, in rivulets, 
coloured by staph and streptococci, 
mixed in haphazard way, down
and came to rest within the coarse
and curly hairs that hid his chin, 
a goatee of a salt and pepper hue.
He coughed again, a painful sound, 
his chest seemed to recoil in fear
and tears rolled from the corners
of his bloodshot eyes, to meet
down at the chin, with greenish pus
dissolving some to start the flow anew, 
down to his trousers, striped and blue 
leaving their telltale stains upon
what once was upperclass from better days, 
before the tumour burst one lonely night
and sent its scouts to roam and seize
in search of sugar which would feed
the rogue and nasty cells that were, 
and soon would be, his private hell
before the system would give in, at last
and make its peace by shouting welcome to its doom.
He'd burned his bible when he still could stand
no use to have a book that gave false hopes, 
he should have done so when his mother died, 
same thing he thought, she'd filled her lungs
with tons of fluids in the end, it took away
all powers just to breathe, though she was strong
and pulled the plug herself, no respirator would
accompany her life into the other world, oh no.
And now it was his time, it came so bloomin' fast
he'd had no time to reminisce or let the past, 
his own, drift by in front of tired eyes, a film
His will and wiley ways, how could a world exist
in which omnipotence took on the role of judge, 
and executioner, without a shred of love for man
pointing its thumb, to either heaven or to hell, 
depending on an ambience of strange and unknown truths.
The nurse, a pretty thing, see-through her uniform, 
well semi in its lovely, clingy way, she had a smile
that seemed reserved for him alone, and if he could, 
a whole and heart man again, he would not hesitate, 
and money always paved the way, he'd lay it on the line
that life itself is short and one must take the hand
of such a treasure chest who would be proud to bear
his children, make his home into a haven for them all, 
she'd left, next to the water jug, a small syringe, 
capped still but full of liquid green, a pad of wipes
sat, awkwardly, not far away and held a note, of rose
and flowered paper, a Hallmark brand for sending thoughts
to lovers through the Royal Mail, it said, in purple ink: 
It's what you want and need, my handsome friend, you've seen
so many times, when I went through the day's routine, 
just do the same, it will be quick and as you do, please press
your buzzer then, and be assured I really, fully understand
I'll be right here, like lightning flash to hold your dying hand.This is the State above the Law.
The State exists for the State alone


[This is a gland at the back of the jaw,
And an answering lump by the collar-bone.]

Some die shouting in gas or fire;
Some die silent, by shell and shot.
Some die desperate, caught on the wire -
Some die suddenly. This will not.

"Regis suprema voluntas Lex"

[It will follow the regular course of--throats.]
Some die pinned by the broken decks,
Some die sobbing between the boats.

Some die eloquent, pressed to death
By the sliding trench as their friends can hear
Some die wholly in half a breath.
Some--give trouble for half a year.

"There is neither Evil nor Good in life
Except as the needs of the State ordain


[Since it is rather too late for the knife,

All we can do is to mask the pain.]

Some die saintly in faith and hope--
One died thus in a prison-yard--
Some die broken by rape or the rope;
Some die easily. This dies hard.

"I will dash to pieces who bar my way.
Woe to the traitor! Woe to the weak! "

[Let him write what he wishes to say.

It tires him out if he tries to speak.]

Some die quietly. Some abound
In loud self-pity. Others spread
Bad morale through the cots around .
This is a type that is better dead.

"The war was forced on me by my foes.
All that I sought was the right to live


[Don't be afraid of a triple dose;

The pain will neutralize all we give.


Here are the needles. See that he dies

While the effects of the drug endure. . . .

What is the question he asks with his eyes?--


A Death blow is a Life blow to Some
Who till they died, did not alive become—
Who had they lived, had died but when
They died, Vitality begun. 

Beeny did not quiver,
Juliot grew not gray,
Thin Valency's river
Held its wonted way.
Bos seemed not to utter
Dimmest note of dirge,
Targan mouth a mutter
To its creamy surge.


Yet though these, unheeding,
Listless, passed the hour
Of her spirit's speeding,
She had, in her flower,
Sought and loved the places -
Much and often pined
For their lonely faces
When in towns confined.


Why did not Valency
In his purl deplore
One whose haunts were whence he
Drew his limpid store?
Why did Bos not thunder
Targan apprehend
Body and breath were sunder
Of their former friend

It was windy that night, all those questioned agreed, 
when the woman was struck by some falling debris.
It was here on West h Street, at the corner of Seventh, 
by the condo they’re building on the site of Saint Vincent’s.
A section of plywood had chanced to fall, 
driving "Tina" Nguyen head first into a wall.
She fell to the pavement and she struck her head.
They rushed her to Bellevue, but she was already dead.
Was it chance? Was it fate? Was it some Divine plan? 
Her death was so random, so hard to understand.
We walk these same streets, so I think you’ll agree
It could have been you. It might have been me. 

You were business tycoons
Your empire was at the height shined in noon
It was associated with pride  
It was open fact and was nothing to hide

As an individual you had thrown complete weight
You had lion’s share to take it to its height
Nobody could do it as you did
You had provided great impetus and lead

What else you needed in life at later stage
The years were passing off to touch the age
You did your level best to build the empire 
No one could ignore you to admire

You were best as good administrator but no humanist
You did all to make it success and insisted
 It was brilliant show put up ever by anybody
You were not careful for your existence and body

It has taken heavy toll and now you regret your life
Thought it was tough and like double edged of knife
You sailed through smoothly with all the odds against
You excelled in all the climate and served as best

You failed to realize that human body has some restrictions
It can work full time with innumerable instructions
If need be many nights can be spent on the spot
It is done only to speak about your ability a lot

When person is established fully in establishment
He needs to change and live in different environment
All hectic movements can be brought to some shift
It must be done smoothly without creating a rift

You miss the opportunity and it will prove a hell
Nothing may move positively and sound well
It is your down fall and sun is heading for decline
You can’t run for everything with all the inclination

The near ones may desert as you are proving failure 
They have nothing to gain from you for sure
You were utilized at maximum level
You have nothing more to excel 


You are in dilemma over your near end
You have created foes and no new friends
It was only great empire and nothing else
You lived under set pattern which has proved false

Before you could find cover
It has taken you over
You had no time left with to decide
You were on ground and simple tied

In few minutes time you will be consigned to flames
Not all people are to be cursed or blamed
It has come at the right time and at place
You had lost all the opportunities and race"O day! he cannot die
When thou so fair art shining!
O Sun, in such a glorious sky,
So tranquilly declining; 

He cannot leave thee now,
While fresh west winds are blowing,
And all around his youthful brow
Thy cheerful light is glowing! 

Edward, awake, awake -
The golden evening gleams
Warm and bright on Arden's lake -
Arouse thee from thy dreams! 

Beside thee, on my knee,
My dearest friend! I pray
That thou, to cross the eternal sea,
Wouldst yet one hour delay: 

I hear its billows roar -
I see them foaming high;
But no glimpse of a further shore
Has blest my straining eye. 

Believe not what they urge
Of Eden isles beyond;
Turn back, from that tempestuous surge,
To thy own native land. 

It is not death, but pain
That struggles in thy breast -
Nay, rally, Edward, rouse again;
I cannot let thee rest!" 

One long look, that sore reproved me
For the woe I could not bear -
One mute look of suffering moved me
To repent my useless prayer: 

And, with sudden check, the heaving
Of distraction passed away;
Not a sign of further grieving
Stirred my soul that awful day. 

Paled, at length, the sweet sun setting;
Sunk to peace the twilight breeze:
Summer dews fell softly, wetting
Glen, and glade, and silent trees. 

Then his eyes began to weary,
Weighed beneath a mortal sleep;
And their orbs grew strangely dreary,
Clouded, even as they would weep. 

But they wept not, but they changed not,
Never moved, and never closed;
Troubled still, and still they ranged not -
Wandered not, nor yet reposed! 

So I knew that he was dying -
Stooped, and raised his languid head;
Felt no breath, and heard no sighing,
So I knew that he was dead. 

If they would stop, 
And apply the same critiquing done. 
They do to others.
With a self examination made.
They couldn't do it.

It has been that long, 
Since they have been in their own backyards.
They would know where to begin.
But would they go. 
To dig in with a beginning to end the stench? 
To clean up the mess they have ignored. 
That has clearly become a debris of toxic waste.

Or. 
Is the fence they peer over, 
Just too attractive with distractions. 
To leave.
To prevent their own poisoning? 
Stay tuned. 
For more declarations of excuses, 
And blaming to be done. 

god in a manifold here

Man one in  many

Nature is enriched

Animal is wild

One to decipher
ignoring god given wealth

Blue, blue is the sea to-day, 
Warmly the light 
Sleeps on St. Andrews Bay -- 
Blue, fringed with white. 

That's no December sky! 
Surely 'tis June 
Holds now her state on high, 

Only the tree-tops bare 
Crowning the hill, 
Clear-cut in perfect air, 
Warn us that still 

Winter, the aged chief, 
Mighty in power, 
Exiles the tender leaf, 
Exiles the flower. 

Is there a heart to-day, 
A heart that grieves 
For flowers that fade away, 
For fallen leaves? 

Oh, not in leaves or flowers 
Endures the charm 
That clothes those naked towers 
With love-light warm. 

O dear St. Andrews Bay, 
Winter or Spring 
Gives not nor takes away 
Memories that cling

All round thy girdling reefs, 
That walk thy shore, 
Memories of joys and griefs 
Ours evermore. 

The breeze is cool and the distant quill coos, 
The sultry solitude rules with blooming hues, 
The rays of country's dust march through the holes, 
Laden are those, who are yet to rise to bow.

The running of river sends the noises of bangles, 
The early cattle are out to graze and grow, 
The tea stalls at the sheds have the boiling boilers, 
The elderly men are there to curse the rulers.

The month of curse is welcome with beautiful kolam, 
A handful of cow dung and the flowers of pumpkin, 
Adorn each threshold of every household, young, 
Girls are out to pray for a good spouse, early morning.

The misty month before the month of harvest and marriage, 
Our men have the thought of reaping the profits, 
A few from the fields and a few from the betrothal, 
Generations of life spent without any being a rebel.

The joy is there in the community where we can enjoy, 
The hands are there to hold us tight, not at tryst, but at tears, 
The state and the fools look for the Sun, fun and gun from the west, 
Knowing not happiness is assured on the lands of humble tribes. 

You hear the sound of carols from afar.
Bright bulbs and tinsel, cinnamon and cloves.
Beyond a hill of snow you see a star.

buy nuts and raisins, fruit from nearby groves, 
cards inscribed in gold: "joy, love and peace."

And you can eat kielbasa from a spit
as fat drips sizzling in makeshift stoves
and zlotys are exchanged and butts are lit.

Here you can watch fat women slaughter fish 
if you stand in the line and bear the shoves, 
pretending that you really have a wish.

And for a moment you can close your eyes
and can forget the cold that pierces gloves 
and see a diamond necklace in the skies, 

or Jesu here among the city doves. 

Person can’t be deceived by his own conscience
He has inner instinct to remember and feel the presence
One may be successful in little time period
People may think different of him and avoid

"Did you ever see my profile? 
Catch me there for while
It may speak for my self and reveal
There is hardly anything to conceal" I replied to a question

"Poets need not speak for themselves
Their volumes or work may speak itself
It is how you present your life and work poetically
It gets on to the heart of people theoretically" I finished it  by saying 

You have so much to learn from friends
They may advance from different angles and lend
The valuable support and inspiration
It may its own weight and startling revelation

I find female readers or friends more considerate
They are near to the truth and hold views very moderate
What they present is purely from mother’s heart
They never try to impose or even try to look smart

They may be found in friend, daughter or beloved
Most all feelings are bridged and puzzle is solved
They nearly take you to the dead far end
Revive it with kind and best human trend

I may not see in them only from sex point of view
I try to understand them and give their legitimate due
This must be the secret of any poet and be pursued
So at any time they are not misunderstood and sued

Should I restrict my self to only writing? 
What if some one offers beautiful fighting? 
Not ending in scuffle but lovely exchanges of words
I always take it as good sign and look forward

what tasks poets are supposed to presume and perform? 
Take the readers views in arms and stay informed 
this may prove to be great joy for the moment
it may be not only great event but surely good movement

Is it purely a matter of poetical value? 
Don’t you think our presence in vital role is due? 
What we are expected to deliver at the critical juncture? 
Is the future really dependent on well presentation of literature? 

I take it as holy task making our presence known on all the forums
We may encounter many unpleasant tasks with future in doldrums
It is how you tackle the sentiments of readers at your heart
The pace may be very slow but you may find it very encouraging from startthey say hardships and tears and sweat built character
(it's mentioned at every closed opportunity and every stunning defeat)   

you can build character by falling and climbing, 
running and returning, 
failing and never succeeding.
today, 
I am officially over building character
I've got enough character to start my own third world country
I've built sky-scrapers of character
I've got my own bank and I invest character in the stock market
I'm going to start loaning it out to the character-deprived! 
I'll learn how to knit and make character scarves to donate to
homeless shelters.

don't you understand? 
I've got character seeping out my ears, 
hiding under my bed.
and if I keep on building all this darn character, 
soon I'll have no place to put it: 
I'll have to start sending it to Mars via space rocket, or
making it into earth-friendly shoes

good grief world, do you get what I'm trying to tell you? 
I'm THROUGH building character! 
I'm THROUGH struggling and wishing and 
wiping my red cheeks.
my character-run toyota hybrid will have to wait-
and character-land will have to disintegrate
because

I'm THROUGH building character. 

And my father told me then
As in this poem I pass to you
‘What you have pursued is your ego’s road’

Had I trailed the path my heart showed
Never would I have struggled 
With such lines of rhyme, 
But as the learned may recall
There is always a time
To be a poet 
Or to follow the passions
In a dream

Read your own book of rules 
Had it never been in times scheme
Life has to fade after seasons in the sun, 
O world as in life
Remember in death too 
What I have won

But is what the world sees 
That victory I dreamt of in life
Or is glory in surpassing 
The barricade of strife.

And my dreams tell you now 
In this secret I reveal 
What I have sought 
Is a decree of forgotten times

Had I rushed up a retreat 
For dollars and dimes
Never would I have found peace
In lines which burn to death
But as men in trance may recall
Poets cannot rhyme life with wealth 

To be or not to be like Hamlet
To live a dream in a yonder world
Read of yesterday in times book 
Where like chaos, future swirled 
Life will burn at deaths tip 
Till darkness takes over the ashes

O world as before death too
Will I see in my afterlife these flashes? 
And still is what I write in ink
The letters the world gets to see
Or is poetry an image 
In a mirror of words I free for decree

Expect na, sir, in this narration, 
A fleechin, fleth'rin Dedication, 
To roose you up, an' ca' you guid, 
An' sprung o' great an' noble bluid, 
Because ye're surnam'd like His Grace- 
Perhaps related to the race: 
Then, when I'm tir'd-and sae are ye, 
Wi' mony a fulsome, sinfu' lie, 
Set up a face how I stop short, 
For fear your modesty be hurt. 

This may do-maun do, sir, wi' them wha 
Maun please the great folk for a wamefou; 
For me! sae laigh I need na bow, 
And when I downa yoke a naig, 
Sae I shall say-an' that's nae flatt'rin- 
It's just sic Poet an' sic Patron. 

The Poet, some guid angel help him, 
Or else, I fear, some ill ane skelp him! 
He may do weel for a' he's done yet, 
But only-he's no just begun yet. 

The Patron (sir, ye maun forgie me; 
I winna lie, come what will o' me), 
On ev'ry hand it will allow'd be, 
He's just-nae better than he should be. 

I readily and freely grant, 
He downa see a poor man want; 
What's no his ain, he winna tak it; 
What ance he says, he winna break it; 
Ought he can lend he'll no refus't, 
Till aft his guidness is abus'd; 
And rascals whiles that do him wrang, 
Ev'n that, he does na mind it lang; 
As master, landlord, husband, father, 
He does na fail his part in either. 

But then, nae thanks to him for a'that; 
Nae godly symptom ye can ca' that; 
It's naething but a milder feature 
Of our poor, sinfu' corrupt nature: 
Ye'll get the best o' moral works, 
'Mang black Gentoos, and pagan Turks, 
Or hunters wild on Ponotaxi, 
Wha never heard of orthodoxy. 
That he's the poor man's friend in need, 
The gentleman in word and deed, 
It's no thro' terror of damnation; 
It's just a carnal inclination. 

Morality, thou deadly bane, 
Thy tens o' thousands thou hast slain! 
Vain is his hope, whase stay an' trust is 
In moral mercy, truth, and justice! 

No-stretch a point to catch a plack: 
Abuse a brother to his back; 
Steal through the winnock frae a whore, 
But point the rake that taks the door; 
Be to the poor like ony whunstane, 
And haud their noses to the grunstane; 
Ply ev'ry art o' legal thieving; 
No matter-stick to sound believing. 

Learn three-mile pray'rs, an' half-mile graces, 
Wi' weel-spread looves, an' lang, wry faces; 
Grunt up a solemn, lengthen'd groan, 
And damn a' parties but your own; 
I'll warrant they ye're nae deceiver, 
A steady, sturdy, staunch believer. 

O ye wha leave the springs o' Calvin, 
For gumlie dubs of your ain delvin! 
Ye sons of Heresy and Error, 
Ye'll some day squeel in quaking terror, 
When Vengeance draws the sword in wrath. 
And in the fire throws the sheath; 
When Ruin, with his sweeping besom, 
Just frets till Heav'n commission gies him; 
While o'er the harp pale Misery moans, 
And strikes the ever-deep'ning tones, 
Still louder shrieks, and heavier groans! 

Your pardon, sir, for this digression: 
I maist forgat my Dedication; 
But when divinity comes 'cross me, 
My readers still are sure to lose me. 

So, sir, you see 'twas nae daft vapour; 
But I maturely thought it proper, 
When a' my works I did review, 
To dedicate them, sir, to you: 
Because (ye need na tak it ill), 
I thought them something like yoursel'. 

Then patronize them wi' your favor, 
And your petitioner shall ever- 
I had amaist said, ever pray, 
But that's a word I need na say; 
For prayin, I hae little skill o't, 
I'm baith dead-sweer, an' wretched ill o't; 
But I'se repeat each poor man's pray'r, 
That kens or hears about you, sir- 

"May ne'er Misfortune's gowling bark, 
Howl thro' the dwelling o' the clerk! 
May ne'er his genrous, honest heart, 
For that same gen'rous spirit smart! 
May Kennedy's far-honour'd name 
Lang beet his hymeneal flame, 
Till Hamiltons, at least a dizzen, 
Are frae their nuptial labours risen: 
Five bonie lasses round their table, 
And sev'n braw fellows, stout an' able, 
To serve their king an' country weel, 
By word, or pen, or pointed steel! 
May health and peace, with mutual rays, 
Shine on the ev'ning o' his days; 
Till his wee, curlie John's ier-oe, 
When ebbing life nae mair shall flow, 
The last, sad, mournful rites bestow!" 

I will not wind a lang conclusion, 
With complimentary effusion; 
But, whilst your wishes and endeavours 
Are blest with Fortune's smiles and favours, 
I am, dear sir, with zeal most fervent, 
Your much indebted, humble servant. 

But if (which Pow'rs above prevent) 
That iron-hearted carl, Want, 
Attended, in his grim advances, 
By sad mistakes, and black mischances, 
While hopes, and joys, and pleasures fly him, 
Make you as poor a dog as I am, 
Your humble servant then no more; 
For who would humbly serve the poor? 
But, by a poor man's hopes in Heav'n! 
While recollection's pow'r is giv'n- 
If, in the vale of humble life, 
The victim sad of fortune's strife, 
I, thro' the tender-gushing tear, 
Should recognise my master dear; 
If friendless, low, we meet together, 
Then, sir, your hand-my Friend and Brother

Because I went the lone ways
Among the tall trees,
Because I loved the blue days,
The bird melodies,
Deemed you I did our love wrong
In loving these too?
Ah, every forest love song
Was sung, love, for you.
The green slope, the sky above,
The wild forest lore-
All these were but the mind's love:
The deep heart has more.
And were you rival of the wren?
Resentful of the dawn?
Ah, what would these avail, then,
If you, dear, were gone?
The wild joy that things possess
Would seem out of place,
And all beauty meaningless
For want of one face;
The wren's lilt for lack of you
Would wring the heart's core,
And stars upon the night's blue
Would move me no more. 

And they were stronger hands than mine
That digged the Ruby from the earth--
More cunning brains that made it worth
The large desire of a king,
And stouter hearts that through the brine
Went down the perfect Pearl to bring.

Lo, I have wrought in common clay
Rude figures of a rough-hewn race,
Since pearls strew not the market-place
In this my town of banishment,
Where with the shifting dust I play,
And eat the bread of discontent.

Yet is there life in that I make.
thou who knowest, turn and see--
As thou hast power over me
So have I power over these,
Because I wrought them for thy sake,
And breathed in them mine agonies.

Small mirth was in the making--now
I lift the cloth that cloaks the clay,
And, wearied, at thy feet I lay
My wares, ere I go forth to sell.
The long bazar will praise, but thou--
Heart of my heart--have I done well

Take these rhymes into thy grace, 
Since they are of thy begetting, 
Lady, that dost make each place 
Where thou art a jewel's setting.

Some such glamour lend this Book; 
Let it be thy poet's wages 
That henceforth thy gracious look 
Lies reflected on its pages. 

As Love will carve dear names upon a tree,
Symbol of gravure on his heart to be,

So thought I thine with loving text to set
In the growth and substance of my canzonet;

But, writing it, my tears begin to fall --
This wild-rose stem for thy large name's too small!

Nay, still my trembling hands are fain, are fain
Cut the good letters though they lap again;

Perchance such folk as mark the blur and stain
Will say, `It was the beating of the rain;'

Or, haply these o'er-woundings of the stem
May loose some little balm, to plead for them.

If I could only be with you, one more 
time! It most certainly, would make my
day! I would do things for you, like I used
to do. As if you never, were away! Just
to see your smile and be able, to hear
your laugh, would be a blessing in
disguise! To be able to look up at your
face, with the twinkle, in your eyes! How
I long, for the days, when you were here
and we'd talk, on the phone everyday. I'd
call you in the morning, to see, if you were, 
okay. We both, loved to do the morning
puzzle, in the paper and if one of us, got
stuck, we'd call. When given the answer, 
we realized, it wasn't that difficult, at all! 
We did a lot for each other, because we
had a deep abiding love! I miss these
precious days, we shared and still, hope
it can be felt, from up above

Poetry, look at me, 
We've been friends, lovers for so long, 
Was our love-life something wrong? 
To desire with such fire, 
All a poem can prolong.

Life is nonsense without substance, 
If some good you can't perform, 
I have loved you with my conscience, 
And the passion of a Storm.

Poetry, beloved Fountain, 
Of my Life, you are my home, 
And my Country and my Mountain, 
And my ever reaching Dome, 
You're the Ocean of my motion, 
Where forever I shall roam, 
With this Love that is Devotion, 
I shall never be alone. 

How  deeply you love your family members? 
When concentrate fully and center
complete thoughts and its implementation
try to remain with them in same station

What makes you to be drawn towards? 
why is the same feelings from inward? 
It may be blood relation and close affinity
this is real one and there lies the beauty


OTHERS because you did not keep
That deep-sworn vow have been friends of mine;
Yet always when I look death in the face,
When I clamber to the heights of sleep,
Or when I grow excited with wine,
Suddenly I meet your face. 

A deep yearning for the past
For what can never be again
For what is loved and lost at once-

A deep yearning for the past
As if life itself is necessarily the endless realization
Of its own forever lostness, 
And the longing for it all 
Even what is now and already gone. 

A life of fire
burns deep inside

As the days
and nights pass
a desire for truth
and meaning burn deeper. 

We are not alone


The shadows play hide and seek
Dreams are too timid
Sandman shows no clemency
Sleep is a captive princess in the stone castle
Who is this woman who lays next to me? 
Do I know her? She has so changed.
Her perfume was never this? 
She even smells different
As to me she often was indifferent
Vanity or pride the stronger
I think staring out of my cage

Far away I see two figures
Fused in each other, must be lovers.
Hand in hands, silver figures of delight
Drenched in full moon
Like an unasked boon
Happiness crept in to crevices 
of  my desert dry  heart.
Was it me and my love? 
My lost love, my beloved  lover

Under the passionate Andalusian sun 
I hear the altar bells ringing
My love in snow white gown
Invited half my town
They were all there the groom
The bride, the best man, the flowergirls
For two years they were all there
With an act that put Judas to ignominy
Each one pulled out a Houdini 
Without planes or trains
They distanced from us a thousand miles
Without tears nor parting smiles

I was no quitter, I did bend
Till everything felt polished n bland
We dressed by each night grand
Awed audiences at parties
Academy awards won’t do justice
To the act we put out as a perfect family
With smiles as fake as Oprah’s tears
She loved our  hounds very much
They taught her the rolling over and  play dead trick.
In sleepless night, I would smoke away
The thoughts of my love boat that was castaway 
If I knew death of love was marriage
I would have worn a deeper shade of black on that day'a defaut bien sur de dieu amerique je

The country is secured by its own fellow citizens
No out side help can save even if it comes then
It is national pride and sacrifice that may help
All necessary precaution can stave off situation with correct steps

It is our sacred duty to rush for help and defend
You must rush for help and can’t pretend 
It has to be protected at all cost
It must occupy our attention and remain upper most

We are duty bound and committed to defend territorial integrity
Whether it is in case of internal disturbances or by mutiny
The state must find itself in preparedness and challenge
It is their internal matter and must be able to manage

It gives sense of belonging to the motherland
Strong nations may try to be hostile or be friend
The diplomacy must also play part to ward off danger
Nothing should be thought of out of anger

The nation can be pushed off by many years 
Many human lives are lost amidst fears
The economy may remain in doldrums
The nation can’t sing glory by beating drums

Each dropp of blood may strengthen our belief
It may provide sense of security with relief
No price can be compared to that of freedom
This type of occasion arrives seldom

Is it not the reflection of our strong mind? 
Can that be compared with or any where find? 
What are all factors that can contribute to great cause? 
The nation can survive the test and uniformly pause 

People may not mind to offer voluntarily any kind of service
It is not mechanical piece or form of any device
This type sense is generated towards mainland
Their existence is dependant mainly on strong bond


Who may not want their land free from any occupation? 
How can they bear any insult based on discrimination? 
Who will grant them prestige and pride once under domination? 
They can never accept slavery and is out of question


The country can heave a sigh of relief where people are vigilant
They may rise to occasion even if that has to be instant
It is not for asking but as matter of sacred duty
Motherland is to be defended without any doubt and fully


We have come across and tested it on number of occasion
We have stood for maintaining amity and friendly relation
If that has been taken as weakness then we have stood our ground
The necessary precautions coupled with popular support is found'Naff' comes back as 'cutting-edge'.

Time gripped me first, held me
tightly, then tumbled me 
across Space. Time was just 
a smoky haze, circulating 
around everything. Space was
a viscous vortex, spinning
in a tight circle, like a mountain
drilling itself into a planet.
Suddenly, the spinning stopped, 
and Space stretched out, stretched
before me, behind me, above and below
me.  And Time was everywhere

For ages I was part of every-
thing. My face was morning light.
My eyes were the last stars to fade, 
and the first to ignite. My torso
was a hill thrust against the bank
of a swift-flowing river. My  brain
was the motion of river currents.
My sex, still a mystery to me, was
the sap rushing up the tree trunk, 
along the branches, and permeating
the leaves which stiffen in green health.
My heart was the growth of sweet flowers.

But how these things became 
me is a story hidden from me.
I dimly recall my soul being
placed near my heart. The weight
of it made me stumble. I fell
into black loam. I recovered
my strength, heaved myself up, 
and stood poised and tall. I've 
grown accustomed to that soul-
weight. Gradually, I sensed                                                                                                   
the luster it spread through 
my body.  It is not a brightness

like day. It is nothing like a sun-
rise flooding a deep valley. It is
the brightest shadow, it is the dark-
est light.  My soul led me
to this world made for me. and I 
for it. My walks are frequent now.
I traipse across my world and enter
other worlds. I have met and claimed 
six others as my friends. We talk 
for hours as the sun slants toward
its night realm. I stay the night
in my friends' world. We never

argue, we love and laugh together.
But can it be some peril stalks us? 
As I was walking along my familiar 
path, I suddenly felt dizzy and pitched 
forward. Rocks smashed my head. For 
an hour I was without awareness. It was
not like sleep. It was a blankness.
When I awoke, I carried within 
my soul fear of that place. It was 
terrifying to be NOTHING again. 
If I sleep, truly sleep, will I
dream the whole of it again

If I felt that you had been here, 
it was because your angel would have touched me with his wing like a breeze, 
and
you would have been here with him
in an indestructible sensation.
Maybe you thought if the angel had told me, 
I would have known, 
but he wouldn't have said anything.
He would never tell me, 
but I've been waiting for you, 
to give me your love
in rainy mornings
with hopeless awakes. 

Thrust upwards through the soil.
Tempted by the warm sunshine, 
To join the bright trefoil.

These flowers of spring beneath the feet, 
Are glorious blooms to view.
Their gentle faces tilt up and greet, 
The dawn of each day, new.

Under the trees they're shaded, 
From the summer's burning heat.
In splendour they are paraded, 
To make the meadows sweet.

So frail and delicate they seem
But their strength is hidden away.
A beautiful creation so supreme, 
They hold you in their sway.

How these small plants lift spirits high, 
They are a delightful sight.
A pleasure sent to charm the eye, 
And such memories to invite. 

Those finding themselves annoyed? 
Choose to be.
Those with heachaches.
And other aches and pains? 
Wouldn't know what they would do, 
Without them.

Those complaining on a daily basis? 
Have been given too much attention.
And those in the business of others? 
Have none of their own.
Leaving those entertained by gossip. 
With nothing else to do but that in their lives.

There is just too much varieity.
Too much abundance.
Too much that is available. 
For anyone to sit an expect, 
A delivery of an accepted life to live! 
And. 
Confinement is only found defined, 
In one's own mind. 

In the middle of the intersection of the Rue de Seine & the Rue de Buci a van stops & the driver, taking his sweet time despite the pile up of traffic, loads several cases of bottles onto his trolley & wheels them into the Bar du Marche. About twenty sheep (a flock of sheep in the middle of Paris?) moving slowly up the Rue de Buci, approach the van & clamber into its open side door, & the shepherd, slamming the door shut, sits down at a table & orders a cafe express which is brought by a surly waiter a few moments later, the van driving off with a load of bleating sheep, this incident similar in many respects to the one I encountered last night at in the Pigalle Metro station trying to catch the last train home – a herd of Texan long horn cattle completely filling the platform, impossible to get near the train when it stopped, had to walk home. 

From the humble river of respect let love flow 
From the clouds of communication let love flow
From the sweet streams of submission let love flow
From the umbrella of understanding let love flow
From the moon light of marital bliss let love flow
From the igloo of intimacy let love flow
From the ocean of orgasm let real love flow

Let it flow until floods of hope fill our hearts
Let it flow until every home overflows with joy
Let it flow until hatred is forever buried
Let it flow until war dies and peace ever lives
Let it flow until drought of divorce disappears
Let it flow until all mankind becomes brothers
Let it flow until night gives way to endless day


A deluge of tears fell in January
as roads flooded 
and homes were lost. 

No wintry frosts or snow, 
just muddied waters
taking no prisoners. 

January pissed on us.
We, that put our last pence
in bricks and mortar.

Now, February's here
and rain’s still falling
under a blackening sky, 

dark as the eyes of a beaten woman
when her man leaves his mark
on her fears. 

I no longer recognize
The flowers of summer youth
That bloomed in the dawn of my innocence
When love was like sunlight
Gleaming on dewy petals.

Cherished kisses are forever gone
Like fading memories
That sink into the soft soil
Of freshly dug graves.

A departed lover
Never returns
But her spirit lingers
In ghost shadows
That consume me. 

Since first the White Horse Banner blew free,
By Hengist's horde unfurled,
Nothing has changed on land or sea
Of the things that steer the world.
(As it was when the long-ships scudded through the gale
So it is where the Liners go.)
Time and Tide, they are both in a tale-- 
"Woe to the weaker -- woe! "

No charm can bridle the hard-mouthed wind
Or smooth the fretting swell.
No gift can alter the grey Sea's mind,
But she serves the strong man well.
(As it is when her uttermost deeps are stirred
So it is where the quicksands show,)
All the waters have but one word--
"Woe to the weaker -- woe! "

The feast is ended, the tales are told,
The dawn is overdue,
And we meet on the quay in the whistling cold
Where the galley waits her crew.
Out with the torches, they have flared too long,
And bid the harpers go.
Wind and warfare have but one song--
"Woe to the weaker -- woe!"

Hail to the great oars gathering way,
As the beach begins to slide!
Hail to the war-shields' click and play
As they lift along our side!
Hail to the first wave over the bow--
Slow for the sea-stroke! Slow!--
All the benches are grunting now:--
"Woe to the weaker -- woe!"Pain.
I know it's there.
I can't truly feel it now, but
only because it's sleeping in 
a pit in my soul. 
and when it wakes up
it will never cease to vex me; 
whispering in my ear
that only it loves me, 
that I need no one else, 
that it will kiss me with misery
and hold me in arms of stone.
It stirs, and the biting
mausoleum chill is more than I
can take.  But I have realized
that breaking free will cost me
dearly; because maybe it's fate; 
and perhaps I do need
this spiral of silent agony and
just as silent tears.  

they let me
know that I'm still alive; 
pain is my only true vital sign; 
it's the only thing I can feel anymore.
I don't want to feel it.  

but
I have to. 

The day is too beautiful to be inside in
The worlds of sunlight leaves and distant walkways
Call 
But inside deeper than all darkness
The demons play their cruel habitual game 
And nothing is seen
But the  screaming of one's own dark pain-

Nothing beautiful matters
All the world outside does not exist
Inside where the deepest hell is 
There is no escape forever
For the Emptiness one who oneself is-A mind which loses its calmness and peace 
By a terrible shock, becomes depressive
And suffers from a mental disorder, anxiety.

When a man loses his dearest one accidently
Or if his closest one betrays him terribly
His mind begins to burn in the fire of depression. 

Like a nocturnal owl the mind spends sleepless nights.
Like a blood sucker depression saps its vitality
And then like a straw it soars in the sky of nothingness.

Like the withered leaves falling in winter, 
Thoughts become pale, sapless and dry 
In the cells of a depressive mind. 

No smile, no joy, no happiness lives there.
One by one they bid the mind goodbye.
Then it starts to lead a lonely life day after day.

It lives as one who is alive physically 
But almost insane or dead mentally
And behaves like an abnormal being.

When a mind becomes depressive by chance, 
It suffers from loneliness and unending agony
Like a convict confined in a dark lone cell for years.

The mind rests on the thorn-bed day after day
In a dark and desolate room isolated from life
And gradually becomes so restless and suicidal. 

A depressive man needs love, support and care
From his dear ones to be cured properly
Fom the terrible state of mind called depression. 

(By sure Prognosticks) when to dread a Show'r: 
While Rain depends, the pensive Cat gives o'er 
Her Frolicks, and pursues her Tail no more. 
Returning Home at Night, you'll find the Sink 
Strike your offended Sense with double Stink. 
If you be wise, then go not far to Dine, 
You spend in Coach-hire more than save in Wine. 
A coming Show'r your shooting Corns presage, 
Old Aches throb, your hollow Tooth will rage. 
Sauntring in Coffee-house is Dulman seen; 
He damns the Climate, and complains of Spleen.

Mean while the South rising with dabbled Wings, 
A Sable Cloud a-thwart the Welkin flings, 
That swill'd more Liquor than it could contain, 
And like a Drunkard gives it up again. 
Brisk Susan whips her Linen from the Rope, 
While the first drizzling Show'r is born aslope, 
Such is that Sprinkling which some careless Quean 
Flirts on you from her Mop, but not so clean. 
To rail; she singing, still whirls on her Mop. 
Not yet, the Dust had shun'd th'unequal Strife, 
But aided by the Wind, fought still for Life; 
And wafted with its Foe by violent Gust, 
'Twas doubtful which was Rain, and which was Dust. 
Ah! where must needy Poet seek for Aid, 
When Dust and Rain at once his Coat invade; 
Sole Coat, where Dust cemented by the Rain, 
Erects the Nap, and leaves a cloudy Stain.

Now in contiguous Drops the Flood comes down, 
Threat'ning with Deloge this Devoted Town. 
To Shops in Crouds the dagled Females fly, 
Pretend to cheapen Goods, but nothing buy. 
The Templer spruce, while ev'ry Spout's a-broach, 
Stays till 'tis fair, yet seems to call a Coach. 
The tuck'd-up Sempstress walks with hasty Strides, 
While Streams run down her oil'd Umbrella's Sides. 
Here various Kinds by various Fortunes led, 
Commence Acquaintance underneath a Shed. 
Triumphant Tories, and desponding Whigs, 
Forget their Fewds, and join to save their Wigs. 
Box'd in a Chair the Beau impatient sits, 
While Spouts run clatt'ring o'er the Roof by Fits; 
And ever and anon with frightful Din 
The Leather sounds, he trembles from within. 
So when Troy Chair-men bore the Wooden Steed, 
Pregnant with Greeks, impatient to be freed, 
(Those Bully Greeks, who, as the Moderns do, 
Instead of paying Chair-men, run them thro'.) 
Laoco'n struck the Outside with his Spear, 
And each imprison'd Hero quak'd for Fear.

Now from all Parts the swelling Kennels flow, 
And bear their Trophies with them as they go: 
Filth of all Hues and Odours seem to tell 
What Streets they sail'd from, by the Sight and Smell. 
They, as each Torrent drives, with rapid Force 
From Smithfield, or St. 

Pulchre's shape their Course, 
And in huge Confluent join at Snow-Hill Ridge, 
Fall from the Conduit prone to Holborn-Bridge. 
Sweepings from Butchers Stalls, Dung, Guts, and Blood,
Drown'd Puppies, stinking Sprats, all drench'd in Mud,
Dead Cats and Turnips-Tops come tumbling down the Flood. 

THUS Tapistry of old, the Walls adorn'd, 
Ere noblest Dames the artful Shuttle scorn'd: 
Arachne, then, with Pallas did contest, 
And scarce th' Immortal Work was judg'd the Best. 
Nor valorous Actions, then, in Books were fought; 
But all the Fame, that from the Field was brought, 
Employ'd the Loom, where the kind Consort wrought: 
Whilst sharing in the Toil, she shar'd the Fame, 
And with the Heroes mixt her interwoven Name. 
No longer, Females to such Praise aspire, 
And seldom now We rightly do admire. 

So much, All Arts are by the Men engross'd, 
And Our few Talents unimprov'd or cross'd; 
Even I, who on this Subject wou'd compose, 
Which the fam'd Urbin for his Pencil chose, 
(And here, in tinctur'd Wool we now behold 
Correctly follow'd in each Shade, and Fold) 
Shou'd prudently from the Attempt withdraw, 
But Inclination proves the stronger Law: 
And tho' the Censures of the World pursue 
These hardy Flights, whilst his Designs I view; 
My burden'd Thoughts, which labour for a Vent, 
Urge me t'explain in Verse, what by each Face is meant. 


Of SERGIUS first, upon his lofty Seat, 
With due Regard our Observations treat; 
Who, whilst he thence on ELYMAS looks down, 
Contracts his pensive Brow into a Frown, 
With Looks inquistive he seeks the Cause 
Why Nature acts not still by Natures Laws. 
'Twas but a Moment, since the Sorcerer's Sight 
Receiv'd the Day, and blaz'd infernal Light: 
Untouch'd, the Optiques in a Moment fail'd, 
Their fierce Illumination quench'd, or veil'd; 
Throughout th' Extention of his ample Sway, 
No Fact, like this, the Roman cou'd survey, 
Who, with spread Hands, invites Mankind to gaze, 
And sympathize in the profound Amaze. 
To share his Wonder every one combines, 
By diff'rent Aspects shewn, and diff'rent Signs. 
A comely Figure, near the Consul plac'd, 
With serious Mildness and Instruction grac'd,
To Others seems imparting what he saw, 
And shews the Wretch with reverential Awe: 
Whilst a more eager Person next we find, 
Viewing the Wizard with a Skeptic's Mind; 
Who his fixt Eyes so near him do's apply, 
We think, enliv'ning Beams might from them fly, 
To re-inkindle, by so just an Aim, 
The radial Sparks, but lately check'd and tame, 
As Tapers new put-out will catch approaching Flame. 
But dire Surprize th' Enquiry do's succeed, 
Whilst full Conviction in his Face we read, 
And He, who question'd, now deplores the Deed. 


To sacred PAUL a younger Figure guides, 
With seeming Warmth, which still in Youth presides; 
And pointing forward, Elder Men directs, 
In Him, to note the Cause of these Effects; 
Upon whose Brow do's evidently shine 
Deputed Pow'r, t' inflict the Wrath Divine; 
Whilst sad and solemn, suited to their Years, 
Each venerable Countenance appears, 
Where, yet we see Astonishment reveal'd, 
Tho' by the Aged often 'tis conceal'd; 
Who the Emotions of their Souls disguize, 
Lest by admiring they shou'd seem less Wise. 


But to thy Portrait, ELYMAS, we come 
Whose Blindness almost strikes the Poet dumb; 
And whilst She vainly to Describe thee seeks, 
The Pen but traces, where the Pencil speaks. 
Thou Darken'd seem'st, as thou would'st feel the Light; 
And with projected Limbs, betray'st a Dread, 
Of unseen Mischiefs, levell'd at thy Head. 
Thro' all thy Frame such Stupefaction reigns, 
As Night it self were sunk into thy Veins: 
Nor by the Eyes alone thy Loss we find, 
Each Lineament helps to proclaim thee Blind. 
An artful Dimness far diffus'd we grant, 
And failing seem all Parts through One important Want. 

Oh! Mighty RAPHAEL, justly sure renown'd! 
Since in thy Works such Excellence is found; 
No Wonder, if with Nature Thou'rt at strife, 
Who thus can paint the Negatives of Life; 
And Deprivation more expressive make, 
Than the most perfect Draughts, which Others take. 
Whilst to this Chiefest Figure of the Piece, 
All that surround it, Heightnings do encrease: 
In some, Amazement by Extreams is shewn, 
Who viewing his clos'd Lids, extend their Own. 
Nor can, by that, enough their Thoughts express, 
Which op'ning Months seem ready to confess. 


Thus stand the LICTORS gazing on a Deed, 
Which do's all humane Chastisements exceed; 
Enfeebl'd seem their Instruments of smart, 
When keener Words can swifter Ills impart. 


Thou, BARNABAS, though Last, not least our Care, 
Seem'st equally employ'd in Praise, and Prayer, 
Acknowledging th' Omnipotent Decree, 
Yet soft Compassion in thy Face we see; 
Whilst lifted Hands implore a kind Relief, 
Tho' no Impatience animates thy Grief; 
But mild Suspence and Charity benign, 
Do all th' excesses of thy Looks confine. 


Thus far, our slow Imagination goes: 
Wou'd the more skill'd THEANOR his disclose; 
Expand the Scene, and open to our Sight 
What to his nicer Judgement gives Delight; 
Whose soaring Mind do's to Perfections climb, 
Nor owns a Relish, but for Things sublime: 
Then, wou'd the Piece fresh Beauties still present, 
Nor Length of Time wou'd leave the Eye content: 
As moments, Hours; as Hours the Days wou'd seem, 
Observing here, taught to observe by HIM. 

Quivering fears, Heart-tearing cares, 
Anxious sighs, Untimely tears, 
Fly, fly to Courts,
Fly to fond worldling's sports,
Where strained Sardonic smiles are glossing still,
And grief is forced to laugh against her will, 
Where mirth's but mummery, 
And sorrows only real be. 

Fly from our Countrey pastimes! fly,
Sad troops of humane misery;
Come serene looks,
Clear as the Crystal brooks,
Or the pure azur'd heaven, that smiles to see 
The rich attendance on our poverty.
Peace and a secure mind,
(Which all men seek) we only find. 

Abused Mortals! did you know
Where Joy, Hearts-ease, and comforts grow; 
You'd scorn proud towers,
And seek them in these bowers,
Where winds sometimes, our woods perhaps may shake,
But blustering care could never tempest mak, 
Nor murmurs e'er come nigh us. 
Saving of fountains that glide by us. 

Here's no fantastick Mask, nor dance,
But of our Kids, that frisk and prance: 
Nor wars are seen, 
Unless upon the green 
Two harmless Lambs are butting one the other;
Which done, both bleating run, each to his Mother. 
And wounds are never found,
Save what the Plow-share gives the ground. 

Here are no false entrapping baits,
To hasten to too hasty fates;
Unless it be
The fond Credulity
Of silly fish, which worldling-like, still look
Upon the Bait, but never on the Hook:
Nor envy, uless among
The Birds, for prize of their sweet song. 

Go! let the diving Negro seek
For Gems, hid in some forlorn creek;
We all Pearls scorn,
Save what the dewy morn
Congeals upon each little spire of grass;
Which careless Shepherds beat down as they pass; 
And gold ne'er here appears, 
Save what the yellow Ceres bears. 

Blest silent Groves! ô may ye be
For ever Mirth's best Nursery! 
May pure contents 
For ever pitch their tents 
Upon these Downs, these Meads, these Rocks, these Mountains,
And peace still slumber by these purling Fountains! 
Which we may every year
Find when we come a fishing here. 

Now hardly here and there a hackney-coach
Appearing, show'd the ruddy morn's approach.
Now Betty from her master's bed had flown,
And softly stole to discompose her own.
The slip-shod 'prentice from his master's door
Had par'd the dirt, and sprinkled round the floor.
Now Moll had whirl'd her mop with dext'rous airs,
Prepar'd to scrub the entry and the stairs.
The youth with broomy stumps began to trace
The kennel-edge, where wheels had worn the place.
The small-coal man was heard with cadence deep;
Till drown'd in shriller notes of "chimney-sweep

"
Duns at his lordship's gate began to meet;
And brickdust Moll had scream'd through half a street.
The turnkey now his flock returning sees,
Duly let out a-nights to steal for fees.
The watchful bailiffs take their silent stands;
And schoolboys lag with satchels in their hands. 

Supposed to have been written under the Ruins of
Rufus's Castle, among the remains of the ancient
Church on the Isle of Portland. 
CHAOTIC pile of barren stone,
That Nature's hurrying hand has thrown,
Half finish'd, from the troubled waves;
On whose rude brow the rifted tower
Has frown'd, through many a stormy hour,
On this drear site of tempest-beaten graves.
Sure Desolation loves to shroud
His giant form within the cloud
That hovers round thy rugged head;
And as through broken vaults beneath,
The future storms low-muttering breathe,
Hears the complaining voices of the dead.
Here marks the fiend with eager eyes,
Far out at sea the fogs arise
That dimly shade the beacon'd strand,
And listens the portentous roar
Of sullen waves, as on the shore,
Monotonous, they burst and tell the storm at hand.
Northward the demon's eyes are cast
O'er yonder bare and sterile waste,
Where, born to hew and heave the block,
Man, lost in ignorance and toil,
Becomes associate to the soil,
And his heart hardens like his native rock.

On the bleak hills, with flint o'erspread,
No blossoms rear the purple head;
No shrub perfumes the zephyrs' breath,
But o'er the cold and cheerless down
Grim desolation seems to frown,
Blasting the ungrateful soil with partial death.
Here the scathed trees with leaves half-dress'd,
Shade no soft songster's secret nest,
Whose spring-notes soothe the pensive ear;
But high the croaking cormorant flies,
And mews and hawks with clamorous cries
Tire the lone echoes of these caverns drear.
Perchance among the ruins grey
Some widow'd mourner loves to stray,
Marking the melancholy main
Where once, afar she could discern
O'er the white waves his sail return
Who never, never now, returns again!
On these lone tombs, by storms up-torn,
The hopeless wretch may lingering mourn,
Till from the ocean, rising red,
The misty moon with lurid ray
Lights her, reluctant, on her way,
To steep in tears her solitary bed.
Hence the dire spirit oft surveys
The ship, that to the western bays
With favouring gales pursues its course;
Then calls the vapour dark that blinds
The pilot,--calls the felon winds
That heave the billows with resistless force.
Commixing with the blotted skies,
High and more high the wild waves rise,
Till, as impetuous torrents urge,
Driven on yon fatal bank accursed
The vessel's massy timbers burst,
And the crew sinks beneath the infuriate surge.
There find the weak an early grave,
While youthful strength the whelming wave
Repels; and labouring for the land,

With shorten'd breath and upturn'd eyes,
Sees the rough shore above him rise,
Nor dreams that rapine meets him on the strand.
And are there then in human form
Monsters more savage than the storm,
Who from the gasping sufferer tear
The dripping weed?--who dare to reap
The inhuman harvest of the deep,
From half-drown'd victims whom the tempests spare?
Ah, yes! by avarice once possess'd,
No pity moves the rustic breast;
Callous he proves--as those who haply wait
Till I (a pilgrim weary worn)
To my own native land return,
With legal toils to drag me to my fate

Beautiful silvery Tay,
With your landscapes, so lovely and gay,
Along each side of your waters, to Perth all the way;
No other river in the world has got scenery more fine,
Only I am told the beautiful Rhine,
Near to Wormit Bay, it seems very fine,
Where the Railway Bridge is towering above its waters sublime,
And the beautiful ship Mars,
With her Juvenile Tare,
Both lively and gay,
Does carelessly lie By night and by day,
In the beautiful Bay
Of the silvery Tay.
Beautiful, beautiful silvery Tay,
Thy scenery is enchanting on a fine summer day,
Near by Balnerino it is beautiful to behold,
When the trees are in full bloom and the cornfields seems like gold -
And nature's face seems gay,
And the lambkins they do play,
And the humming bee is on the wing,
It is enough to make one sing,
While they carelessly do stray,
Along the beautiful banks of the silvery Tay,
Beautiful silvery Tay,
Rolling smoothly on your way,
Near by Newport, as clear as the day,
Thy scenery around is charming I'll be bound. 
And would make the heart of any one feel light and gay on a fine summer day,
To view the beautiful scenery along the banks of the silvery Tay. 

A well deserved and needed rest for me my sweet dear.
Will you come and join me for a snuggle so sweet and near? 
Will you honor me with your sweet spirit and open arms? 
Can I hold you dear and feel your peace surround me now? 
I need this rest and some wholesome sleep, 
I so want you here and have you next to me.
I want to hold my one and say I love you more each day.

It's a well deserved and needed rest my dear and Angel true, 
a deserved rest and snuggle for the 
both of us and I want to hold you near.
Come sweet one and look me in the eyes, 
I will caress your cheek and rub your back as I give you all my love.
I want to surround you in all my warmth as we close our eyes.
I love you so my only one and want to sleep with you, 
not sex my dear but peaceful holding now.
Come rest with me my only one you're all I want and need. 

Now mind is clear
as a cloudless sky.
Time then to make a
home in wilderness.

What have I done but
wander with my eyes
in the trees? So I 
will build: wife,
family, and seek
for neighbors.

Or I
perish of lonesomeness
or want of food or
lightning or the bear
(must tame the hart
and wear the bear) .

And maybe make an image
of my wandering, a little
image—shrine by the
roadside to signify
to traveler that I live
here in the wilderness
awake and at home. 

Blessed to be born in this world
We all may feel that's the truth
Until I read this-
An abandoned baby
Malnourished, hardly an year old
Famine struck
Skin and bone
No food to feed
No water to have
Stranded alone in barren land
Helpless eyes staring straight
Standing legs more like a bamboo stick
Cerebral neurons popping out
Veins struggling to carry weak blood
My heart is not strong enough 
To read the rest-
A vampire vulture
Sitting beside and
Looking eager to end its hunger! 
I pray! Save these innocents! 
Let this never happen again

converting every moment
of life
into money
has strolled us
into this destructive path
of disharmony


It was devastating! 

a development
if without humanity
is a march backwards


A cruel devil walked down into
That peaceful and quiet valley under a blue sky
Being surrounded by high mountains in nature’s abundance.
It dastardly attacked, tore and demolished
Anything and everything in that hilly place.
It ruined a society, a civilization, a history and lives
So cruelly it turned everything into dust.

We hear and are given to believe that
YOU are so kind to those whom you create, 
Then why and how 
Do YOU remain so cool, inert and inactive now? 
How YOU digest this dastardly acts on them.

Are YOU truly kind to those whom you create? 
Or am I to believe something just the opposite? 

I hesitated to pinch her from her stem
Instead I planted myself next to her
Where I too have flourished in a sense
.

thought it was a tear
till i saw the sun lap it
and say oh honey


The tides can speak the language of the sea
The moon knows the dialect of the sun
Mountains can communicate with clouds, through a single touch

And true lovers can always speak one another's tongue
Although they may be different: 
And even some languages that have not been invented yet. 

I
DEATH, if thou wilt, fain would I plead with thee:
Canst thou not spare, of all our hopes have built,
One shelter where our spirits fain would be,
            Death, if thou wit?

No dome with suns and dews impearled and gilt,
Imperial: but some roof of wildwood tree,
Too mean for sceptre's heft or swordblade's hilt.

Some low sweet roof where love might live, set free
From change and fear and dreams of grief or guilt;
Canst thou not leave life even thus much to see,
            Death, if thou wilt?

     II
Man, what art thou to speak and plead with me?
What knowest thou of my workings, where and how
What things I fashion? Nay, behold and see,
            Man, what art thou?

Thy fruits of life, and blossoms of thy bough,
What are they but my seedlings?  Earth and sea
Bear nought but when I breathe on it must bow.

Bow thou too down before me: though thou be
Great, all the pride shall fade from off thy brow,
When Time and strong Oblivion ask of thee,
            Man, what art thou ?

      III
Death, if thou be or be not, as was said,
Immortal; if thou make us nought, or we
Survive: thy power is made but of our dread,
            Death, if thou be.

Thy might is made out of our fear of thee:
Who fears thee not, hath plucked from off thine head
The crown of cloud that darkens earth and sea.

Earth, sea, and sky, as rain or vapour shed,
Shall vanish; all the shows of them shall flee:
Then shall we know full surely, quick or dead,
            Death, if thou be. 

DEATH:
For my dagger is bathed in the blood of the brave,
I come, care-worn tenant of life, from the grave,
Where Innocence sleeps 'neath the peace-giving sod,
And the good cease to tremble at Tyranny's nod;
I offer a calm habitation to thee,--
Say, victim of grief, wilt thou slumber with me?
My mansion is damp, cold silence is there,
But it lulls in oblivion the fiends of despair;
Not a groan of regret, not a sigh, not a breath,
Dares dispute with grim Silence the empire of Death.
I offer a calm habitation to thee,--
Say, victim of grief, wilt thou slumber with me?

MORTAL:
Mine eyelids are heavy; my soul seeks repose,
It longs in thy cells to embosom its woes,
It longs in thy cells to deposit its load, 
Where no longer the scorpions of Perfidy goad,--
Where the phantoms of Prejudice vanish away,
And Bigotry's bloodhounds lose scent of their prey.
Yet tell me, dark Death, when thine empire is o'er,
What awaits on Futurity's mist-covered shore? 

DEATH:
Cease, cease, wayward Mortal! I dare not unveil
The shadows that float o'er Eternity's vale;
Nought waits for the good but a spirit of Love,
That will hail their blest advent to regions above.
For Love, Mortal, gleams through the gloom of my sway, 
And the shades which surround me fly fast at its ray.
Hast thou loved?--Then depart from these regions of hate,
And in slumber with me blunt the arrows of fate.
I offer a calm habitation to thee.--
Say, victim of grief, wilt thou slumber with me? 

MORTAL:
Oh! sweet is thy slumber! oh! sweet is the ray
Which after thy night introduces the day;
How concealed, how persuasive, self-interest’s breath,
Though it floats to mine ear from the bosom of Death!
I hoped that I quite was forgotten by all,
Yet a lingering friend might be grieved at my fall,
And duty forbids, though I languish to die,
When departure might heave Virtue’s breast with a sigh.
O Death! O my friend! snatch this form to thy shrine,
And I fear, dear destroyer, I shall not repine. 

Alas, poor Death! Where is thy glory?
Where is thy famous force, thy ancient sting?

Alas, poor mortal, void of story!
Go spell and read how I have killed thy King.

Poor Death! And who was hurt thereby?
Thy curse being laid on Him makes thee accurst.

Let losers talk, yet thou shalt die;
These arms shall crush thee.

Spare not, do thy worst.
I shall be one day better than before;
Thou so much worse, that thou shalt be no more. 



With honour, wealth, and peace happy and blest,
What ails thee hang thy head, and cross thine arms,
And sit i' the dust to sigh these sad alarms?
What deluge of new woes thus over-whelm
The glories of thy ever famous Realm?
What means this wailing tone, this mournful guise?
Ah, tell thy Daughter; she may sympathize. 



Art ignorant indeed of these my woes,
Or must my forced tongue these griefs disclose,
And must my self dissect my tatter'd state,
And thou a child, a Limb, and dost not feel
My weak'ned fainting body now to reel?
This physic-purging-potion I have taken
Will bring Consumption or an Ague quaking,
Unless some Cordial thou fetch from high,
Which present help may ease my malady.
If I decease, dost think thou shalt survive?
Or by my wasting state dost think to thrive?
Then weigh our case, if 't be not justly sad.
Let me lament alone, while thou art glad. 



And thus, alas, your state you much deplore
In general terms, but will not say wherefore.
What Medicine shall I seek to cure this woe,
If th' wound's so dangerous, I may not know?
But you, perhaps, would have me guess it out.
What, hath some Hengist like that Saxon stout
By fraud and force usurp'd thy flow'ring crown,
Or by tempestuous Wars thy fields trod down?
Or hath Canutus, that brave valiant Dane,
The regal peaceful Sceptre from thee ta'en?
Or is 't a Norman whose victorious hand
With English blood bedews thy conquered Land?
Or is 't intestine Wars that thus offend?
Do Maud and Stephen for the Crown contend?
Do Barons rise and side against their King,
And call in Foreign aid to help the thing?
Must Edward be depos'd? Or is 't the hour
That second Richard must be clapp'd i' th' Tower?
Or is it the fatal jar, again begun,
That from the red, white pricking Roses sprung?
Must Richmond's aid the Nobles now implore
To come and break the tushes of the Boar?
If none of these, dear Mother, what's your woe?
Pray, do not fear Spain's bragging Armado.
Doth your Ally, fair France, conspire your wrack,
Or doth the Scots play false behind your back?
Doth Holland quit you ill for all your love?
Whence is this storm, from Earth or Heaven above?
Is 't drought, is 't Famine, or is 't Pestilence?
Dost feel the smart, or fear the consequence?
Your humble Child entreats you shew your grief.
Though Arms nor Purse she hath for your relief--
Such is her poverty,--yet shall be found
A suppliant for your help, as she is bound.



I must confess some of those Sores you name
My beauteous Body at this present maim,
But foreign Foe nor feigned friend I fear,
For they have work enough, thou knowest, elsewhere.
Nor is it Alcie's son and Henry's Daughter
Whose proud contention cause this slaughter;
Nor Nobles siding to make John no King,
French Louis unjustly to the Crown to bring;
No Edward, Richard, to lose rule and life,
Nor no Lancastrians to renew old strife;
York nor Earl of March to soil
Their hands in Kindred's blood whom they did foil;
No need of Tudor Roses to unite:
None knows which is the Red or which the White.
Spain's braving Fleet a second time is sunk.
France knows how of my fury she hath drunk
By Edward third and Henry fifth of fame;
Her Lilies in my Arms avouch the same.
My Sister Scotland hurts me now no more,
Though she hath been injurious heretofore.
What Holland is, I am in some suspense,
But trust not much unto his Excellence.
For wants, sure some I feel, but more I fear;
And for the Pestilence, who knows how near?
Famine and Plague, two sisters of the Sword,
Destruction to a Land doth soon afford.
They're for my punishments ordain'd on high,
Unless thy tears prevent it speedily.
But yet I answer not what you demand
To shew the grievance of my troubled Land.
Before I tell the effect I'll shew the cause,
Which are my sins--the breach of sacred Laws:
Idolatry, supplanter of a N ation,
With foolish superstitious adoration,
Are lik'd and countenanc'd by men of might,
The Gospel is trod down and hath no right.
Church Offices are sold and bought for gain
That Pope had hope to find Rome here again.
For Oaths and Blasphemies did ever ear
From Beelzebub himself such language hear?
What scorning of the Saints of the most high!
What injuries did daily on them lie!
What false reports, what nick-names did they take,
Not for their own, but for their Master's sake!
And thou, poor soul, wast jeer'd among the rest;
Thy flying for the Truth I made a jest.
For Sabbath-breaking and for Drunkenness
Did ever Land profaneness more express?
From crying bloods yet cleansed am not I,
Martyrs and others dying causelessly.
How many Princely heads on blocks laid down
For nought but title to a fading Crown!
'Mongst all the cruelties which I have done,
Oh, Edward's Babes, and Clarence's hapless Son,
O Jane, why didst thou die in flow'ring prime?--
Because of Royal Stem, that was thy crime.
For Bribery, Adultery, for Thefts, and Lies
Where is the Nation I can't paralyze?
With Usury, Extortion, and Oppression,
These be the Hydras of my stout transgression;
These be the bitter fountains, heads, and roots
Whence flow'd the source, the sprigs, the boughs, and fruits.
Of more than thou canst hear or I relate,
That with high hand I still did perpetrate,
For these were threat'ned the woeful day
I mocked the Preachers, put it fair away.
The Sermons yet upon record do stand
That cried destruction to my wicked Land.
These Prophets' mouths (all the while) was stopt, 
Unworthily, some backs whipt, and ears crept; 
Their reverent cheeks bear the glorious marks
Of stinking, stigmatizing Romish Clerks; 
Some lost their livings, some in prison pent,
Some grossly fined, from friends to exile went:
Their silent tongues to heaven did vengeance cry,
Who heard their cause, and wrongs judg'd righteously,
And will repay it sevenfold in my lap.
This is fore-runner of my after-clap.
Nor took I warning by my neighbors' falls.
I saw sad Germany's dismantled walls,
I saw her people famish'd, Nobles slain,
Her fruitful land a barren heath remain.
I saw (unmov'd) her Armies foil'd and fled,
Wives forc'd, babes toss'd, her houses calcined.
I saw strong Rochelle yield'd to her foe,
I saw poor Ireland bleeding out her last,
Such cruelty as all reports have past.
Mine heart obdurate stood not yet aghast.
Now sip I of that cup, and just 't may be
The bottom dregs reserved are for me.


To all you've said, sad mother, I assent.
Your fearful sins great cause there 's to lament.
My guilty hands (in part) hold up with you,
A sharer in your punishment's my due.
But all you say amounts to this effect,
Not what you feel, but what you do expect.
Pray, in plain terms, what is your present grief?
Then let's join heads and hands for your relief.



Well, to the matter, then. There's grown of late
'Twixt King and Peers a question of state:
Which is the chief, the law, or else the King?
One saith, it's he; the other, no such thing.
My better part in Court of Parliament
To ease my groaning land shew their intent
To crush the proud, and right to each man deal,
To help the Church, and stay the Common-Weal.
So many obstacles comes in their way
As puts me to a stand what I should say.
Old customs, new Prerogatives stood on.
Had they not held law fast, all had been gone,
Which by their prudence stood them in such stead
They took high Strafford lower by the head,
And to their Laud be 't spoke they held 'n th' Tower
All England's metropolitan that hour.
This done, an Act they would have passed fain
No prelate should his Bishopric retain.
Here tugg'd they hard indeed, for all men saw
This must be done by Gospel, not by law.
Next the Militia they urged sore.
This was denied, I need not say wherefore.
The King, displeased, at York himself absents.
They humbly beg return, shew their intents.
The writing, printing, posting to and fro,
Shews all was done; I'll therefore let it go.
But now I come to speak of my disaster.
Contention's grown 'twixt Subjects and their Master,
They worded it so long they fell to blows,
That thousands lay on heaps. Here bleeds my woes.
I that no wars so many years have known
Am now destroy'd and slaughter'd by mine own.
But could the field alone this strife decide,
One battle, two, or three I might abide,
But these may be beginnings of more woe--
Who knows, the worst, the best may overthrow!
Religion, Gospel, here lies at the stake,
Pray now, dear child, for sacred Zion's sake,
Oh, pity me in this sad perturbation,
My plundered Towns, my houses' devastation,
My ravisht virgins, and my young men slain,
My wealthy trading fallen, my dearth of grain.
The seedtime's come, but Ploughman hath no hope
Because he knows not who shall inn his crop.
The poor they want their pay, their children bread,
Their woful mothers' tears unpitied.
If any pity in thy heart remain,
Or any child-like love thou dost retain,
For my relief now use thy utmost skill,
And recompense me good for all my ill.



Dear mother, cease complaints, and wipe your eyes,
Shake off your dust, cheer up, and now arise.
You are my mother, nurse, I once your flesh,
Your sunken bowels gladly would refresh.
Your griefs I pity much but should do wrong,
To weep for that we both have pray'd for long,
To see these latter days of hop'd-for good,
That Right may have its right, though 't be with blood.
After dark Popery the day did clear;
But now the Sun in's brightness shall appear.
Blest be the Nobles of thy Noble Land
With (ventur'd lives) for truth's defence that stand.
Blest be thy Commons, who for Common good
And thy infringed Laws have boldly stood.
Blest be thy Counties, who do aid thee still
With hearts and states to testify their will.
Blest be thy Preachers, who do cheer thee on.
And shall I not on them wish Mero's curse
That help thee not with prayers, arms, and purse?
And for my self, let miseries abound
If mindless of thy state I e'er be found.
These are the days the Church's foes to crush,
To root out Prelates, head, tail, branch, and rush.
Let's bring Baal's vestments out, to make a fire,
Their Mitres, Surplices, and all their tire,
Copes, Rochets, Croziers, and such trash,
And let their names consume, but let the flash
We hate Rome's Whore, with all her trumpery.
Go on, brave Essex, shew whose son thou art,
Not false to King, nor Country in thy heart,
But those that hurt his people and his Crown,
By force expel, destroy, and tread them down.
Let Gaols be fill'd with th' remnant of that pack,
And sturdy Tyburn loaded till it crack.
And ye brave Nobles, chase away all fear,
And to this blessed Cause closely adhere.
O mother, can you weep and have such Peers?
When they are gone, then drown your self in tears,
If now you weep so much, that then no more
The briny Ocean will o'erflow your shore.
These, these are they (I trust) with Charles our king,
Out of all mists such glorious days will bring
That dazzled eyes, beholding, much shall wonder
At that thy settled Peace, thy wealth, and splendour,
Thy Church and Weal establish'd in such manner
That all shall joy that thou display'dst thy banner,
And discipline erected so, I trust,
That nursing Kings shall come and lick thy dust.
Then Justice shall in all thy Courts take place
Without respect of persons or of case.
Then bribes shall cease, and suits shall not stick long,
Patience and purse of Clients for to wrong.
Then High Commissions shall fall to decay,
And Pursuivants and Catchpoles want their pay.
So shall thy happy Nation ever flourish,
When truth and righteousness they thus shall nourish.
When thus in Peace, thine Armies brave send out
To sack proud Rome, and all her vassals rout.
There let thy name, thy fame, and valour shine,
As did thine Ancestors' in Palestine,
And let her spoils full pay with int'rest be
Of what unjustly once she poll'd from thee.
Of all the woes thou canst let her be sped,
Execute to th' full the vengeance threatened.
Bring forth the beast that rul'd the world with's beck,
And tear his flesh, and set your feet on's neck,
And make his filthy den so desolate
To th' 'stonishment of all that knew his state.
This done, with brandish'd swords to Turkey go,--
(For then what is it but English blades dare do?)
And lay her waste, for so's the sacred doom,
And do to Gog as thou hast done to Rome.
Oh Abraham's seed, lift up your heads on high,
For sure the day of your redemption's nigh.
The scales shall fall from your long blinded eyes,
And him you shall adore who now despise.
Then fullness of the Nations in shall flow,
And Jew and Gentile to one worship go.
Then follows days of happiness and rest.
Whose lot doth fall to live therein is blest.
No Canaanite shall then be found 'n th' land,
And holiness on horses' bells shall stand.
If this make way thereto, then sigh no more,
But if at all thou didst not see 't before.
Farewell, dear mother; Parliament, prevail,
And in a while you'll tell another tale



.[W.]

IF her disdain least change in you can move,
You do not love,
For when that hope gives fuel to the fire,
You sell desire.
Love is not love, but given free ;
And so is mine ; so should yours be.

[D.]

Her heart, that weeps to hear of others' moan,
To mine is stone.
Her eyes, that weep a stranger's eyes to see,
Joy to wound me.
Yet I so well affect each part,
As—caused by them—I love my smart.

[W.]

Say her disdainings justly must be graced
With name of chaste ;
And that she frowns lest longing should exceed,
And raging breed ;
So her disdains can ne'er offend,
Unless self-love take private end.

[D.]

'Tis love breeds love in me, and cold disdain
Kills that again,
As water causeth fire to fret and fume,
Till all consume.
Who can of love more rich gift make,
That to Love's self for love's own sake?


I'll never dig in quarry of an heart
To have no part,
Nor roast in fiery eyes, which always are
Canicular.
Who this way would a lover prove,
May show his patience, not his love.

A frown may be sometimes for physic good,
But not for food ;
And for that raging humour there is sure
A gentler cure.
Why bar you love of private end,
Which never should to public tend


Courage my Soul, now learn to wield
The weight of thine immortal Shield.
Close on thy Head thy Helmet bright.
Ballance thy Sword against the Fight.
See where an Army, strong as fair,
With silken Banners spreads the air.
Now, if thou bee'st that thing Divine,
In this day's Combat let it shine:
And shew that Nature wants an Art
To conquer one resolved Heart.


Pleasure
Welcome the Creations Guest,
Lay aside that Warlike Crest,
And of Nature's banquet share:
Where the Souls of fruits and flow'rs
Stand prepar'd to heighten yours.

Soul
I sup above, and cannot stay
To bait so long upon the way.

Pleasure
On these downy Pillows lye,
Whose soft Plumes will thither fly:
On these Roses strow'd so plain
Lest one Leaf thy Side should strain.

Soul
My gentler Rest is on a Thought,
Conscious of doing what I ought.

Pleasure
If thou bee'st with Perfumes pleas'd,
Thou in fragrant Clouds shalt show

Soul
A Soul that knowes not to presume
Is Heaven's and its own perfume.

Pleasure
Every thing does seem to vie
Which should first attract thine Eye:
But since none deserves that grace,
In this Crystal view thy face.

Soul
When the Creator's skill is priz'd,
The rest is all but Earth disguis'd.

Pleasure
Heark how Musick then prepares
For thy Stay these charming Aires ;
Which the posting Winds recall,
And suspend the Rivers Fall.

Soul
Had I but any time to lose,
On this I would it all dispose.
Cease Tempter. None can chain a mind
Whom this sweet Chordage cannot bind.

Chorus
Earth cannot shew so brave a Sight
As when a single Soul does fence
The Batteries of alluring Sense,
And Heaven views it with delight.
Then persevere: for still new Charges sound:
And if thou overcom'st thou shalt be crown'd.

Pleasure
All this fair, and cost, and sweet,
Which scatteringly doth shine,
Shall within one Beauty meet,
And she be only thine.

Soul
If things of Sight such Heavens be,
What Heavens are those we cannot see?

Pleasure
Where so e're thy Foot shall go
The minted Gold shall lie;
Till thou purchase all below,
And want new Worlds to buy.

Soul
Wer't not a price who 'ld value Gold?
And that's worth nought that can be sold.

Pleasure
Wilt thou all the Glory have
That War or Peace commend?
Half the World shall be thy Slave
The other half thy Friend.

Soul
What Friends, if to my self untrue?
What Slaves, unless I captive you?

Pleasure
Thou shalt know each hidden Cause;
Try what depth the Centre draws;
And then to Heaven climb.

Soul
None thither mounts by the degree
Of Knowledge, but Humility.

Chorus
Triumph, triumph, victorious Soul;
The World has not one Pleasure more:
The rest does lie beyond the pole,
And is thine everlasting Store. 

Soul
O Who shall, from this Dungeon, raise
A Soul inslav'd so many wayes?
With bolts of Bones, that fetter'd stands
In Feet ; and manacled in Hands.
Here blinded with an Eye ; and there
Deaf with the drumming of an Ear.
A Soul hung up, as 'twere, in Chains
Of Nerves, and Arteries, and Veins.
Tortur'd, besides each other part,
In a vain Head, and double Heart.

Body
O who shall me deliver whole,
From bonds of this Tyrannic Soul?
Which, stretcht upright, impales me so,
That mine own Precipice I go;
And warms and moves this needless Frame:
(A Fever could but do the same.)
And, wanting where its spight to try,
Has made me live to let me dye.
A Body that could never rest,
Since this ill Spirit it possest.

Soul
What Magic could me thus confine
Within anothers Grief to pine?
Where whatsoever it complain,
I feel, that cannot feel, the pain.
And all my Care its self employes,
That to preserve, which me destroys:
Constrain'd not only to indure
Diseases, but, whats worse, the Cure:
And ready oft the Port to gain,
Am Shipwrackt into Health again.

Body
But Physick yet could never reach
The Maladies Thou me dost teach;
Whom first the Cramp of Hope does Tear:
And then the Palsie Shakes of Fear.
The Pestilence of Love does heat :
Or Hatred's hidden Ulcer eat.
Joy's chearful Madness does perplex:
Or Sorrow's other Madness vex.
Which Knowledge forces me to know;
And Memory will not foregoe.
What but a Soul could have the wit
To build me up for Sin so fit?
So Architects do square and hew,
Green Trees that in the Forest grew. 


Dorinda
When Death, shall snatch us from these Kids,
And shut up our divided Lids,
Tell me Thyrsis, prethee do,
Whither thou and I must go.

Thyrsis
To the Elizium: (Dorinda) oh where i'st?

Thyrsis
A Chast Soul, can never mis't.

Dorinda
I know no way, but one, our home
Is our Elizium?

Thyrsis
Cast thine Eye to yonder Skie,
There the milky way doth lye;
'Tis a sure but rugged way,
That leads to Everlasting day.

Dorinda
There Birds may nest, but how can I,
That have no wings and cannot fly.

Thyrsis
Do not sigh (fair Nimph) for fire
Hath no wings, yet doth aspire
Till it hit, against the pole,
Heaven's the Center of the Soul.

Dorinda
But in Elizium how do they
Pass Eternity away.

Thyrsis
Ho, ther's, neither hope nor fear
Ther's no Wolf, no Fox, no Bear.
No need of Dog to fetch our stray,
Our Lightfoot we may give away;
And there most sweetly thine Ear
May feast with Musick of the Sphear.
How I my future state
By silent thinking, Antidate:
I preethe let us spend, our time come,
In talking of Elizium.

Thyrsis
Then I'le go on: There, sheep are full
Of softest grass, and softest wooll;
There, birds sing Consorts, garlands grow,
Cold winds do whisper,springs do flow.
There, alwayes is, a rising Sun,
And day is ever, but begun.
Shepheards there, bear equal sway,

Dorinda
Ah me, ah me.

Thyrsis
Dorinda, why do'st Cry?

Dorinda
I'm sick, I'm sick, and fain would dye:
Convinc't me now, that this is true,
By bidding, with mee, all adieu
I cannot live, without thee, I
Will for thee,much more with thee dye.

Dorinda
Then let us give Corellia charge o'th Sheep,
And thou and I'le pick poppies and them steep
In wine, and drink on't even till we weep,
So shall we smoothly pass away in sleep. 

Soul. 
Whilst my Souls eye beheld no light
But what stream'd from thy gracious sight
To me the worlds greatest King,
Seem'd but some little vulgar thing.

Whilst thou prov'dst pure; and that in thee
I could glass all my Deity; 
How glad did I from Heaven depart,
To find a lodging in thy heart!

S. Now Fame and Greatness bear the sway,
('Tis they that hold my prisons Key):
For whom my soul would die, might she
Leave them her Immortalitie. 

G. I, and some few pure Souls conspire,
And burn both in a mutual fire,
For whom I'd die once more, ere they 
Should miss of Heavens eternal day.

And with an adamantine chain,
Lock me to thee? What if I chase
The world away to give thee place?

G. Then though these souls in whom I joy
Are Seraphims, Thou but a toy,
A foolish toy, yet once more I 
Would with thee live, and for thee die. 

My dearest Love, since thou wilt go,
And leave me here behind thee;
For love or pity, let me know
The place where I may find thee.

AMARIL.  In country meadows, pearl'd with dew,
And set about with lilies;
There, filling maunds with cowslips, you
May find your Amarillis.

HER.  What have the meads to do with thee,
Or with thy youthful hours?
Live thou at court, where thou mayst be

Let country wenches make 'em fine
With posies, since 'tis fitter
For thee with richest gems to shine,
And like the stars to glitter.

AMARIL.  You set too-high a rate upon
A shepherdess so homely.
HER.  Believe it, dearest, there's not one
I' th' court that's half so comely.

I prithee stay.  AMARIL.  I must away;
Let's kiss first, then we'll sever;
AMBO  And though we bid adieu to day,
We shall not part for ever. 

i{My Soul} I summon to the winding ancient stair;
Set all your mind upon the steep ascent,
Upon the broken, crumbling battlement,
Upon the breathless starlit air,
'Upon the star that marks the hidden pole;
Fix every wandering thought upon
That quarter where all thought is done:
Who can distinguish darkness from the soul
i{My Self}.  The consecretes blade upon my knees
Is Sato's ancient blade, still as it was,
Still razor-keen, still like a looking-glass
Unspotted by the centuries;
That flowering, silken, old embroidery, torn
From some court-lady's dress and round
The wodden scabbard bound and wound
Can, tattered, still protect, faded adorn
i{My Soul.} Why should the imagination of a man
Long past his prime remember things that are
Emblematical of love and war?
Think of ancestral night that can,
If but imagination scorn the earth
And interllect is wandering
To this and that and t'other thing,
Deliver from the crime of death and birth.
i{My self.} Montashigi, third of his family, fashioned it
Five hundred years ago, about it lie
Flowers from I know not what embroidery --
Heart's purple -- and all these I set
For emblems of the day against the tower
Emblematical of the night,
And claim as by a soldier's right
A charter to commit the crime once more.
i{My Soul.} Such fullness in that quarter overflows
And falls into the basin of the mind
That man is stricken deaf and dumb and blind,
For intellect no longer knows
i{Is} from the i{Ought,} or i{knower} from the i{Known -- }
That is to say, ascends to Heaven;
Only the dead can be forgiven;
But when I think of that my tongue's a stone.
i{My Self.} A living man is blind and drinks his drop.
What matter if the ditches are impure?
What matter if I live it all once more?
Endure that toil of growing up;
The ignominy of boyhood; the distress
Of boyhood changing into man;
The unfinished man and his pain
Brought face to face with his own clumsiness;
The finished man among his enemies? --
How in the name of Heaven can he escape
That defiling and disfigured shape
The mirror of malicious eyes
Casts upon his eyes until at last
He thinks that shape must be his shape?
And what's the good of an escape
If honour find him in the wintry blast?
I am content to live it all again
And yet again, if it be life to pitch
Into the frog-spawn of a blind man's ditch,
A blind man battering blind men;
Or into that most fecund ditch of all,
The folly that man does
Or must suffer, if he woos
A proud woman not kindred of his soul.
I am content to follow to its source
Every event in action or in thought;
Measure the lot; forgive myself the lot!
When such as I cast out remorse
So great a sweetness flows into the breast
We must laugh and we must sing,
We are blest by everything,
Everything we look upon is blest. 

A diamond or a coal? 
A diamond, if you please: 
Who cares about a clumsy coal 
Beneath the summer trees? 
A diamond or a coal? 
A coal, sir, if you please: 
One comes to care about the coal 

through you, I have learned how to love again
you always make me smile when I am down
you are as loving as the shimmering angel

I would have fallen even more
without you at my side at each step
we went through some hard times, some joy times together

the messages you made just to tell me
how much you caring, thinking of me
helped me through harsh days

you taught me that I could do anything
you still encouraged me even when 
you didn't agree with road I walked in

you didn't leave me while I was at the edge
I always had someone whom I could trust
and who patiently understood me

take my hand
and take my whole life too
what a wonderful worlda mind  body soul
 all the same in all human
 some smile some do cry

some smile some do cry
am i those.  

those small  human
who cry when they laugh


I tired something new today
I figured why not
having a conversation
with yourself
is a normal occurrence
on every day bases
it could be a whisper
a shout
or just simple
solid line voice
with yourself
going over an incident
that may have happened
earlier today
something from the past
or a future event
you had in mind.

I decided to try something different
I got tired of the way I felt
sometimes, kinda like
out of place
some other things
took control and I did not
enjoy that very much
so I talked to my sadness
I told it, I don't mind
having you around for a visit
once in a while
but please
as soon as you see
the door opened
please leave

I told happiness
to think things over
and think about moving in
for a lifetime
I did not push it
or propose yet
not to scare happiness away
that quick, but I just love
having bliss around
I feel light and alive
and all I want to do is dance
I thought the conversation went well
I was right
happiness decided
to dwell for a while
maybe a big while.

There is a secret
the decision and choice
was strictly mine, 
happiness just decided
to follow.
Smile

Words can flower too, 
In the garden of speech, 
In poetic reach, 
In the greenery of hope, 
Kissed by love's rain
They may even sooth, 
Our inner pain. 

A Poem sweet and sound, 
Is good to have around, 
When by yourself, 
It calms your nerves, 
Truly a new friend found.

'Truth is Love'
such words were said
as the poet painted 
the town 
   all read


There was very little physical about their love, 
It went well beyond all that, 
Like two Swans whose necks intertwine, 
Creating an everlasting bond, 
They embraced, floating away together, 
Into the Eternity of Time, 
Forever


We’ve been in the rain so long
That our eyes are sore and red; 
When joy is missing, 
We gaze down too long at our feet
As we slowly walk through the city, 
But there must be a different sky waiting
Offering love and inspiration.

Beneath these yellow factory skies, 
Even the street lights look sadly dim, 
Like our spiritual light within
Blurred by an affectionless life.
 
Things began to change
When I met you in a small bar
Not far from the school where you teach; 
I saw Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass
Easing out of your purse, 
I knew we had to talk.

As we spoke over drinks
In the early evening, 
I felt loneliness begin to lift
Like dark persistent clouds
Being pushed aside by sunlight, 
As if Walt Whitman were sending us
Prayers mingled with lilacs.

Indeed, there is a different sky waiting, 
Azure blue and dazzling, 
Inviting flowers to bloom
On romantic avenues
When two people finally find each other.

In my mind I have already seen
You smile in a summer dress
Beneath a different sky welcoming our love. 

from my gallery of faces

he has the softest eyes
I have ever seen, 
watery and doe full
is it compassion and empathy
that I see, 

or some rheumy humor
bathing the scene

all doubts are washed away
by the sonorous baritone, 
the soft and delicate tones
of interest and feeling
and a shy smile, 

now I know what
she sees in him, 
the seas and oceans, 
green fields, 
skies blue, 
and merry meadows 
too, 

they are his sun
and her moon
a divine dance of 
heavenly bodies

admiring and 
circling each other
with a love that lives

breathing  a notalgia
an infinty at echoes


Highways, byways and motorways 
are very much the same to me.
I much prefer the bridle ways
Those quiet lanes are traffic free.

 I care not where the path may lead.
I stroll along at my own pace.
I’m free from any need for speed
I am quite happy to retrace

 my steps. Should I mistake 
the path   I follow get it wrong
What does it matter if I take? 
 a shortcut which proves to be long.

I opted out of life’s rat race.
I am at no mans beck and call
 I choose my way and choose my pace
 and don’t regret my choice at all.

I live my life free from all stress
 I only have myself to please.
No time constraints to cause distress.
 I freed myself from that disease.

Time does not matter not to me
I thought it did but I was wrong.
At last I am completely free
To listen to a different song.



not many years ago, 
one I would wish that no-one else
experience or know, 
whilst erstwhile partner (what fool I!)  
screwed his most recent slut, 
I lay with morphine pumping through
my veins. Strong stuff, it’s said. Yes, but
it may diminish feeling in
a body in a bed, 
but nothing would diminish
anguish coursing through my head.
Out plopped the babe, this tiny boy
- so beautiful to me -
yet too ‘imperfect’ to be born
for all the world to see.
Still - his father was a cruel man
who knew not how to care, 
knew not of strength or loyalty
or even ‘being there’.
Michael was the name we gave.
He lies now under snow
buried in a garden 
where the head-bowed snowdrops grow.
Forgotten not, my wee young lad.
You could not make it through.
Yet your mother now, though bitter
has great gratitude to you.
Such joy, in time, comes with the pain; 
you made me come to see
that  life goes on; and through your death
real life embraces me. 

Drugs are not drugs in this world of mine
Rather they are a crutch for when you feel weak
My dealer is not merely a dealer
But a witch doctor that helps the lot of us sleep
These tattoos are not just ink on my skin
My artist is not only a tattoo artist in a shop
These tattoos are a book of memories and our skin an album
The artist is our teacher helping us deal with the pain until it stops
Please visit this world so different from yours
But refrain from the urge to stop and stare
This different view of life has done us plenty good
In a world full of people who don't want to go anywhere
People expect us to fail
They could never imagine we would ever rise up
We are laying in the waste but looking to the stars
No one was ever hurt by wishing nor wanting too much


Each raindrop on the water
is a ripple on the tide.
A million drops creating
a million ripples that collide.
I think, much like the raindrops
each and every thing you do, 
effects another action, 
and creates the one called-you.

Had you walked a different pathway, 
chose a different time for tears.
You may have found a new horizon, 
added hopes, avoided fears.
If you worked each day for different goals, 
wished upon a different star, 
Your dreams might not look distant
.  

your worries might seem far, 
If you trusted in another, 
gave your heart to someone true.
You might not recognize yourself
.  

became a different you.

Each raindrop on the water
creates a ripple on the lake.
You create a new tomorrow, 
with every action.  

each mistake


We shared so much. Laughs of joy and moments of pain. And tears of happiness. We had an understanding as well as a place in the heart of  one another. We talked about our dreams. About being freinds for life. When in trouble you helped me with all your strengh. The strengh from your love. Love from your warm heart. We walked right beside each other as we felt a friendly breeze. No matter wwhere you'll be. You will always be in my heart. Just promise me I  will be in your heart too. You are an Angel who walked into my life. I would hate to say goodbye because  it's too soon. But them  we will never part. In the memory of my forever friend Helene Susan Nemirow written and Posted ow can we say that we still love each other
When we selfishly went the opposite ways? 
You took the freeway and I, the skyways
How can we say that we care for each other
When we no longer snore under the same roof? 

We don’t know where we slept last night
We have no idea if one lied down on the right
Or the other on the left side that is aloof.

Our depraved children are scared and confused
We don’t know how to humanely explained
The logarithmic formula that we diffused
Haphazardly when the in-laws complained
About the crickets that became bitterly aloud.

These days, we are neither happy nor proud.

How can we say that we blindly love each other
When we both agreed to go our separate ways? 
How can we frankly care for each other
When we both abandoned the gourmet food on the trays? 

The feelings are strange, unusual and compressed
The plants and the flowers are no longer natural
Our children looked sad, desperate and depressed
Amidst this mess though we tried to remain cordial.



This book is written for Man's ultimate need,
A creed of joy sent down to the aged Earth
From days of happier daring and more mirth
To comfort and console all hearts that bleed.
Here shall ye find how Love, that mastering weed
Of tropic growth and paradisal power,
Sprang in a night and found its fortunate hour
And was fulfilled of glory, flower, fruit, seed,
A wonder to the Forest.--O ye souls
Of men and women, who on Time's whim wait
Nor clutch her hem when Pleasure turns to flee!
Read of these two, who ill content with doles
Rose in their rage and gave assault to Fate
And won their birth--fruit. Read. Nay, dare it ye

for every cause an effect
what created the cause, another effect, 
sounds too circular to accept, 
doesn't explain, the why
only tells the history of a sigh

and if  I can know the source
will it change the orbit of course, 
deny the sigh and why, 
or should I believe in forces beyond
exchanging ignorance for bliss, 
rely on it,  assume the why has caused it all
will it change my life, the struggle and strife


With apologies to S. 

T. Coleridge and Kubla Khan



Is there a crying in the forests of this soul? Divinity
Is failing? Or a dream has stretched the twining elasticity
Of thought beyond endurance? Or perhaps a fine stability
Was never meant to be - except in ruin. Brute sublimity
Requires the bright, the still, the lithic quelling of variety.

But this swaying veil of lock and eye, it shuts out equanimity, 
Demands and reaches for a writhing dusk’s impossibility, 
Tearing at reality to make a unanimity, 
To bring together, fling apart the fabric of the unity
Of breast and thigh, the close-sheathing of minds, finding satiety
Only for fleeting moments. This wrenching, kind avidity
Gluts itself on trifles, greatness, in a mad affinity
For everything and nothing, swings and sings the night’s ability
To form, unform, to stir, to swim in, welter in plasticity-
Such is the dancing in the forests of this soul’s divinity. 

You can talk directly without any perception
This theory has existed for thousands of years from inception
Kind and pure heart catch the impulse by telepathy
What else we need if we hear two words of sympathy
 
It is pure reflection in heart
It picks up the signal and start
The very straight path for salvation
With all the means for elation

It can win any adversary
It is not hypnotism or any magic
It has simple natural law
You act honest as you draw

It is said that magnetic field does exist
It has capacity to pull and insist
It can prevail upon others for definite views
This can be experienced by only few

Light travels faster than sound
This is how messages are sent all around
Human thoughts find same way to ravel
The message is conveyed and felt as real

The message is received from a friend the moment you think
You may wonder and think how it has happened and wink? 
It is considered important that how honestly you feel about others? 
The same way it is realized on other side too

It is not blind faith or wrong practice
In olden days it was very good device
The great thinkers used to convey through meditation
It was known as  powerful knowledge with indication


Why were you born when the snow was falling? 
You should have come to the cuckoo's calling 
Or when grapes are green in the cluster, 
Or, at least, when lithe swallows muster 
For their far off flying 
From summer dying. 


Why did you die when the lambs were cropping? 
You should have died at the apples' dropping, 
When the grasshopper comes to trouble, 
And the wheat-fields are sodden stubble, 
And all winds go sighing 
For sweet things dying. 

Rough wind, that moanest loud
Grief too sad for song;
Wild wind, when sullen cloud
Knells all the night long;
Sad storm whose tears are vain, 
Bare woods, whose branches strain,
Deep caves and dreary main,--
Wail, for the world’s wrong

To be intoned, all but the two italicized lines, which are to be spoken in a snappy, matter-of-fact way.


Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong.
Here lies a kitten good, who kept
A kitten's proper place.
He stole no pantry eatables,
Nor scratched the baby's face.

He let the alley-cats alone.
He had no yowling vice.
His shirt was always laundried well,
He freed the house of mice.
Until his death he had not caused
His little mistress tears,
He wore his ribbon prettily,

He washed behind his ears.
Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong. 

No more will we stumble and fall 
On the sand at Portobello beach 
Rolling in laughter 
In love and in happiness. 

No more will we stumble and fall 
By the canal and the bushes 
That May in Amsterdam 
In fun and bliss. 

No more will we stumble and fall 
Reckless into each others hearts 
As the bed fell apart 
And we crashed and slept in chaos! 

No more will we stumble and fall 
Drunk in the winter snow 
Wild and free as the wind 
When Joy and Love were new. 

No more shall we stumble and fall 
Where all defenses are broken 
Where love rushes in like the tide 
When your eyes were my heaven


The ash tray holds the ashes
From his smoked out cigarettes
With each new passing day
He's filled with more regrets

It seems life and chances
Have all but passed him by
He struggles just to exist
But he's not too sure why

His life has been a failure
By any standard that you use
It seems the choices that he made
Were always the wrong one's to choose

But still he always tried
To do what was right
He sleeps away the days
He stay awake all night

Drinking eases the pain
Of a life that went all wrong
He tried so very hard
But he's just not that strong

Years ago his wife left him
She couldn't take no more
One day when he returned home
He found a note upon door

She wrote, I am leaving
I just can't live this way
I hope you find it in your heart
To forgive me one day

Our children need a stable life
Not like the one we've been living
It seems you do all the taking
While I do all the giving

I never minded making you happy
That was my part to do as your wife
But I know out there somewhere
For me and the kids, there's a better life

So that is why we have to leave
I wish you nothing but the best
I'll think of you when I look at the kids

Well that was twenty years ago
That's how long he's been alone
His body is old and feeling tired
He's waiting to be called home




-The Angel Valadriel descended from Heaven to Earth, and she lived among human beings as one of them. She brought into their lives the 
Shining Light.

The angel's name was Valadriel, and she chose
for herself an uncommon destiny. From her earliest
awakening, she saw shining in the highest heaven
a disc of purest light, burning, brightening, 
glistening, glowing, growing larger and spinning, 
casting divine light over all of the angels.
Their wings folded, their faces radiant, 
the angels were transfixed in joy, 
and joy spread across the fields of heaven, 
flooding the angels and also the redeemed souls
with measureless grace.  Valadriel alone
was sad: she closed her eyes and beat
her wings fiercely, striving to reach
the source of the LIGHT.  


Valadriel flew toward immense sheets of cosmic
LIGHT, free, untrammeled, unabsorbed. She flew
on a steep incline of the time-space  energy field.
Everywhere, all through time, galaxies were forming, 
suns igniting, systems colliding and making super-systems.
Valadriel kept flying, despite the paralyzing awe, 
and the small doubt that was growing larger in her
The angel Valadriel and a new Disc of Shining Light! 

The Shining Disc dimmed as it descended, descending
from the highest heaven to the higher heaven it dimmed
to starlight, from there to the middle heaven it dimmed to
sunlight, from there to the lower heaven it dimmed to moonlight, 
from there to the lowest heaven it dimmed to daylight. from there
to Earth it dimmed to lightless night, and there, there
to a darkness alternating with daylight
where Valadriel resides, in natural realm that is
She spins the disc and she feels human sorrow, the light
begins to glow and she feels the weight of human sin, 
the light shines feebly and she feels what humans call hope.
slowly, slowly, the disc casts divine grace among human beings, 
steadily a joy spreads across the fields of the earth. 

A gentleman of City fame
Now claims your kind attention;
East India broking was his game,
His name I shall not mention:
No one of finely-pointed sense
Would violate a confidence,
And shall I go
And do it?  No!
His name I shall not mention.

He had a trusty wife and true,
And very cosy quarters,
A manager, a boy or two,
Six clerks, and seven porters.
A broker must be doing well
(As any lunatic can tell)
Who can employ
An active boy,
Six clerks, and seven porters.

His knocker advertised no dun,
No losses made him sulky,
He had one sorrow - only one -
He was extremely bulky.
A man must be, I beg to state,
Exceptionally fortunate
Who owns his chief
And only grief
Is - being very bulky.

"This load," he'd say, "I cannot bear;
I'm nineteen stone or twenty!
Henceforward I'll go in for air
And exercise in plenty

"
Most people think that, should it come,
They can reduce a bulging tum
To measures fair
By taking air
And exercise in plenty.

In every weather, every day,
Dry, muddy, wet, or gritty,
He took to dancing all the way
From Brompton to the City.
You do not often get the chance
Of seeing sugar brokers dance
From their abode
In Fulham Road
Through Brompton to the City.

He braved the gay and guileless laugh
Of children with their nusses,
The loud uneducated chaff
Of clerks on omnibuses.
Against all minor things that rack
A nicely-balanced mind, I'll back
The noisy chaff
And ill-bred laugh
Of clerks on omnibuses.

His friends, who heard his money chink,
And saw the house he rented,
And knew his wife, could never think
What made him discontented.
It never entered their pure minds
That fads are of eccentric kinds,
Nor would they own
That fat alone
Could make one discontented.

"Your riches know no kind of pause,
Your trade is fast advancing;
You dance - but not for joy, because
You weep as you are dancing.
To dance implies that man is glad,
To weep implies that man is sad;
But here are you
Who do the two -
You weep as you are dancing!"

His mania soon got noised about
And into all the papers;
His size increased beyond a doubt
For all his reckless capers:
It may seem singular to you,
But all his friends admit it true -
The more he found
His figure round,
The more he cut his capers.

His bulk increased - no matter that -
He tried the more to toss it -
He never spoke of it as "fat,"
But "adipose deposit

"
Upon my word, it seems to me
Unpardonable vanity
(And worse than that)
To call your fat
An "adipose deposit


At length his brawny knees gave way,
And on the carpet sinking,
Upon his shapeless back he lay
And kicked away like winking.
Instead of seeing in his state
The finger of unswerving Fate,
He laboured still
To work his will,
And kicked away like winking.

His friends, disgusted with him now,
Away in silence wended -
I hardly like to tell you how
This dreadful story ended.
The shocking sequel to impart,
I must employ the limner's art -
If you would know,
This sketch will show
How his exertions ended.

MORAL.

I hate to preach - I hate to prate -
- I'm no fanatic croaker,
But learn contentment from the fate
Of this East India broker.
He'd everything a man of taste
Could ever want, except a waist;
And discontent
His size anent,
And bootless perseverance blind,
Completely wrecked the peace of mind
Of this East India broker. 

there is something in other
people that we all love

adore
even unreasonably that we like
to touch and caress with our own
hands
only to put dirt on their
clean skins

even without talking
we like to undress 
and scrutinize every hidden
corner and see
what is there


it makes our heart beat
jump, 
dive
collide
burst, 
explode 

it can even make us
dangerous as
 some of them may
be the cause of
untimely deaths
of some of us
who cannot
bear
the agonies of
our
flesh

 we keep on saying
'no regrets! : 

no hurt feelings, 

 this is the lifetime
of joy

there is so much 
thinking 
spending 
more whole nights
about wishing, 
and dreaming even
if in the process we also
shrink ourselves
into minute particles of
insignificance

of brittleness
that make our eyes 
shatter 

nerves cut off
systems turn off



 when the first morning light
however
 comes
through the leaks of our
awakening
walls

 we wake up
rise from
our positions
of defeat &
we proclaim incessantly
through a murmur: 


'forget it, 
 it is not me! 'Disillusioned sacred heart
about to be exposed, 
about to be mocked by the infidels
so lonely and cold, even in the summer.
we appeal, the judge before the Judge
forgive and forget, 
let the so-called sacred heart know peace. 

The houses are haunted
By white night-gowns.
None are green,
Or purple with green rings,
Or green with yellow rings,
Or yellow with blue rings.
None of them are strange,
With socks of lace
And beaded ceintures.
People are not going
To dream of baboons and periwinkles.
Only, here and there, an old sailor,
Drunk and asleep in his boots,
Catches Tigers
In red weather. 

They lie in parallel rows,
on ice, head to tail, 
each a foot of luminosity 
barred with black bands,
which divide the scales'
radiant sections 

like seams of lead
in a Tiffany window.
Iridescent, watery 

prismatics: think abalone,
the wildly rainbowed
mirror of a soap-bubble sphere, 

think sun on gasoline.
Splendor, and splendor, 
and not a one in any way 

distinguished from the other
- nothing about them
of individuality. Instead 

they're all exact expressions
of the one soul,
each a perfect fulfillment 

of heaven's template,
mackerel essence. As if, 
after a lifetime arriving 

at this enameling, the jeweler's
made uncountable examples
each as intricate 

in its oily fabulation
as the one before; 
a cosmos of champleve. 

Suppose we could iridesce,
like these, and lose ourselves
entirely in the universe 

of shimmer- would you want
to be yourself only,
unduplicatable, doomed 

to be lost? They'd prefer,
plainly, to be flashing participants,
multitudinous. Even on ice 

they seem to be bolting
forward, heedless of stasis.
They don't care they're dead 

and nearly frozen,
just as, presumably,
they didn't care that they were living: 

all, all for all,
the rainbowed school
and its acres of brilliant classrooms, 

in which no verb is singular,
or every one is. How happy they seem,
even on ice, to be together, selfless, 

which is the price of gleaming. 

You see, the thing was this way -- there was me, 
That rode Panopply, the Splendor mare, 
And Ikey Chambers on the Iron Dook, 
And Smith, the half-caste rider on Regret, 
And that long bloke from Wagga -- him that rode 
Veronikew, the Snowy River horse. 
Well, none of them had chances -- not a chance 
Among the lot, unless the rest fell dead 
Or wasn't trying -- for a blind man's dog 
Could see Enchantress was a certain cop, 
And all the books was layin' six to four. 
They brought her out to show our lot the road, 
Or so they said: but, then Gord's truth! you know, 
You can believe 'em, though they took an oath 
On forty Bibles that they's tell the truth. 
But anyhow, an amateur was up 
On this Enchantress; and so Ike and me, 
We thought that we might frighten him a bit 
By asking if he minded riding rough -- 
"Oh, not at all," says he, "oh, not at all! 
I heard at Robbo Park, and if it comes 
To bumping I'm your Moses! Strike me blue!" 

Says he, "I'll bump you over either rail, 
The inside rail or outside -- which you choose 
Is good enough for me" -- which settled Ike. 
For he was shaky since he near got killed 
From being sent a buster on the rail, 
When some chap bumped his horse and fetched him down 
At Stony Bridge; so Ikey thought it best 
To leave this bloke alone, and I agreed. 

So all the books was layin' six to four 
Against the favourite, and the amateur 
Was walking this Enchantress up and down, 
And me and Smithy backed him; for we thought 
We might as well get something for ourselves, 
Because we knew our horses couldn't win. 
But Ikey wouldn't back him for a bob; 
Because he said he reckoned he was stiff, 
And all the books was layin' six to four. 

Well, anyhow, before the start the news 
Got around that this here amateur was stiff, 
And our good stuff was blued, and all the books 
Was in it, and the prices lengthened out, 
And every book was bustin' of his throat, 
And layin' five to one the favourite. 
So there was we that couldn't win ourselves, 
And this here amateur that wouldn't try, 
And all the books was layin' five to one. 

So Smithy says to me, "You take a hold 
Of that there moke of yours, and round the turn 
Come up behind Enchantress with the whip 
And let her have it; that long bloke and me 
Will wait ahead, and when she comes to us 
We'll pass her on and belt her down the straight, 
And Ikey'll flog her home -- because his boss 
And so he won't be touched; and, as for us, 
We'll swear we only hit her by mistake!" 
And all the books was layin' five to one. 

Well, off we went, and comin' to the turn 
I saw the amateur was holdinig back 
And poking into every hole he could 
To get her blocked; and so I pulled behind 
And drew the whip and dropped it on the mare. 
I let her have it twice, and then she shot 
Ahead of me, and Smithy opened out 
And let her up beside him on the rails, 
And kept her there a-beltin' her like smoke 
Until she struggled past him, pullin' hard, 
And came to Ike; but Ikey drew his whip 
And hit her on the nose, and sent her back 
And won the race himself -- for, after all, 
It seems he had a fiver on The Dook 
And never told us -- so our stuff was lost. 
And then they had us up for ridin' foul, 
And warned us off the tracks for twelve months each 
To get our livin' any way we could; 
But Ikey wasn't touched, because his boss 

But Mister -- if you'll lend us half-a-crown, 
I know three certain winners at the Park -- 
Three certain cops as no one knows but me; 
And -- thank you, Mister, come an' have a beer 
(I always like a beer about this time) . . . 
Well, so long, Mister, till we meet again. 

To Ernest Brace

"And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was
about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto
me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and
write them not

"                           --REVELATIONS, x, 

That raft we rigged up, under the water,
Was just the item: when he walked,
With his robes blowing, dark against the sky,
It was as though the unsubstantial waves held up
His slender and inviolate feet. The gulls flew over,
Dropping, crying alone; thin ragged lengths of cloud
Drifted in bars across the sun. There on the shore
The crowd's response was instantaneous. He
Handled it well, I thought--the gait, the tilt of the head, just right.
Long streaks of light were blinding on the waves.
And then we knew our work well worth the time:
The days of sawing, fitting, all those nails,
The tiresome rehearsals, considerations of execution.
But if you want a miracle, you have to work for it,
Lay your plans carefully and keep one jump
Ahead of the crowd. To report a miracle
Is a pleasure unalloyed; but staging one requires
Tact, imagination, a special knack for the job
Not everyone possesses. A miracle, in fact, means work.
--And now there are those who have come saying
That miracles were not what we were after. But what else
Is there? What other hope does life hold out
But the miraculous, the skilled and patient
Execution, the teamwork, all the pain and worry every miracle involves?

Visionaries tossing in their beds, haunted and racked
By questions of Messiahship and eschatology,
Are like the mist rising at nightfall, and come,
Perhaps to even less. Grave supernaturalists, devoted worshippers
Experience the ecstasy (such as it is), but not
Our ecstasy. It was our making. Yet sometimes
When the torrent of that time
Comes pouring back, I wonder at our courage
And our enterprise. It was as though the world
Had been one darkening, abandoned hall
Where rows of unlit candles stood; and we
Not out of love, so much, or hope, or even worship, but
Out of the fear of death, came with our lights
And watched the candles, one by one, take fire, flames
Against the long night of our fear. We thought
That we could never die. Now I am less convinced.
--The traveller on the plain makes out the mountains
At a distance; then he loses sight. His way
Winds through the valleys; then, at a sudden turning of a path,
The peaks stand nakedly before him: they are something else
Than what he saw below. I think now of the raft
(For me, somehow, the summit of the whole experience)
And all the expectations of that day, but also of the cave
We stocked with bread, the secret meetings
In the hills, the fake assassins hired for the last pursuit,
The careful staging of the cures, the bribed officials,
The angels' garments, tailored faultlessly,
The medicines administered behind the stone,
That ultimate cloud, so perfect, and so opportune.
Who managed all that blood I never knew.

The days get longer. It was a long time ago.
And I have come to that point in the turning of the path
Where peaks are infinite--horn-shaped and scaly, choked with 

thorns.
But even here, I know our work was worth the cost.
What we have brought to pass, no one can take away.
Life offers up no miracles, unfortunately, and needs assistance.
Nothing will be the same as once it was,
I tell myself.--It's dark here on the peak, and keeps on getting 
darker.
It seems I am experiencing a kind of ecstasy.
Was it sunlight on the waves that day? The night comes down.
And now the water seems remote, unreal, and perhaps it is. 

The most ardent love, although sincere
Cannot deny Fate and Destiny, 
Those endless nights of lonely tears
Will not bring you here to be with me.

The dreams we had and many plans
Made with much Love and deepest Hope
They drift away like shifting sands
We both despair,  in heartache grope.

No ending here, mere thoughts unfold, 
Rewinding memories of the past
A love story  that cannot be told
And a love too distant.  to even last. 

I'm the angel sent to protect you. 
Watching your life through closed eyes, 
I watch and observe. 
Such a delicate creature of beauty, 
My heart Begins to attack my mind with longing, 
Wanting to hold you forever, even longer than eternity, 
My heart's exploding with the thought of you, 
So painful; love hurts, 
Watching my hidden desire from a far, 
Never together only distanced by love. 

A distant view
Can beckon you
To dream of unknown destinations
Where life has no more regulations
And freedom reigns.
There are no chains.

A distant view
Can summon you 
With magnetic power. A forceful attraction
Revealing nothing, not even a fraction
of what is in store
What you're looking for.

A distant view
Can often woo
Your heart, and let you fantasise
About a place you could colonise
Where your soul's at ease
And, your life's a 'breeze'. 

I lower myself slowly plummet-like, 
breathing from canned breath, 
scanning from my goggles' borrowed eyes. 

I surge
with a passion groundswell and eddy in the whirlpool
of joy and sorrow
rolling underneath one another, 
shedding hunger, thirst, pain or desire. 

now
what traces itself below me or afar-nil, no bottom line, 
save silhouetted
on tomorrow's door 'no admittance prior opening time'.
it retreats
rainbow-like at my approach, till home call anchor
hikes me up to the shore of want and need. 

Two roads meet at four cross roads 
We are in the midst of it with enough loads
They may be passing through thick woods
All dangerous with not enough foods

We may feel sorry later not to choose the correct path
You may think calmly while taking bath
at the time of choosing option you have no time left
It may take you to the right or left

The road is wide open and it is for you to choose
You have everything to gain and nothing to loose
Still the choice may matter most in gaining the ground
You may feel sorry when nothing is actually found

You may cut sorry figure with lots of despair
The atmosphere may look heavy with no movement in air
You may wish and think that you had better option to choose
The sorry state of affairs had altered everything to loose

You can’t go in all the directions and prefer solid action
You may stick to your views with no more, reactions
You may prefer to do as much as you can do
It may not allow you to have way and pass through

You may prove as strange traveler
You have killer’s instinct and nose works as inhaler
You may be warned of danger lurking by
You may go in for it with powerful try

The world has changed a lot 
Many wars have been fought
Peace and harmony is always sought
Still we are in dilemma and simply caught

I stood motionless on the road with confusion
Nothing was leading me with fresh infusion
It was double state of mind with no useful purpose
I had no other reason to go for it or suppose

the chances looked vary fair even if I erred
They will be addressed later and cared
What was most import that bothered me much? 
I had never ventured in to land a such  

 I looked calm with composure
I was ready for dangerous exposure
Nothing was appealing but I was very much sure
I had the reason to feel relieved with fine cure




I was not simply passing there
I knew how to find it and where? 
It may not look bright and promising
There was certainly something missing
i
 For me all the roads equally lay
I could leave mark for another day
I was determined to find it anyway
Though I had no option for assertive say


I will try to find your shadow, 
When the sundial comes alive, 
And I'll search all far and narrow, 
Till all Light becomes divine, 
For divine was this strange feeling, 
Of you anchored in my mind, 
For divine, was never meeting, 
Yet pretending you were mine. 

Cruelty has a human heart,
   And Jealousy a human face;
 Terror the human form divine,
   And Secresy the human dress.
 
 The human dress is forged iron,
   The human form a fiery forge,
 The human face a furnace sealed,
   The human heart its hungry gorge. 

I had no answer for her seeking motherhood
The storm was expected as it was likelihood
The desire was so intense that it almost made me to sink
I sat motionless and eyes remained static without any blink

It can be had only after rendering some satisfaction
Why does this question arise when there is sudden urge or indication? 
Why does woman demand after feeling so much suffocation? 
 
It is not easy to feel pulse of psychological mind
You may go for easy way out or try to find
The real crux of problem to have some escape
Try to think fresh and give it a complete reshape
 
Is it strong feeling to come and take shape of little child? 
Why does she agree for total forgiveness and go very mild? 
Is it divinity call to be responded by her with greater responsibility? 
Is it not the genius call emerging from within to be followed with ability? 

I read between lines the strong urge and decided to act
It was no game of love or hate but simple act to react
Why was that intense feeling for bearing a soul in womb? 
Why initially I thought it like explosives used in bomb? 

She had her own reasons to express true form
She was attached to earth loved creation like earthworm
It was in fact her womb that longed for some lively space
There was nothing new in her mental agony like mad race

She was expected to think on general lines of all mothers
She had followed family patters consisting of sisters and brothers
I bowed my head in respect to her wishful thinking
It saved me from negative thought and sinking too

What did she whisper in my ears when I was too close? 
"I want junior man in my lap with same pose"
What an ideal thinking when she was really in turmoil? 
Heart and mind at daily clash with mind ready to boil

"I feel jealous for being your close friend"
"I see in it as new beginning and not the end
Let stars and moon shine in their own sphere! 
Why we should not acclaim our feat without any fear? 


I couldn’t believe my eyes but saw the bright shine
She was perfect model with eyes so beautiful and fine
I was to deliver her happiness for divinity call
It was just to take me to sky without further fall


Those were the days, 
When we were oh-so-close.

We each had our own ways, &
Yet it was our togetherness that rose.

Battling through the weather, &
Shining through the darkness, 

We blossomed as a flower, 
Sans support from any harness

Then time took over, 
Chalking between us an abyss.

Syncing us now takes forever, 
Something we'd rather miss.

Over relational, 
Our individual priorities have taken precedence.

Over familial, 
Nothing else seems more of a menace. 

But why are we so separate? 
Was our intimacy ever authentic? 

The questions still reverberate, 
As we overtire our psychic.

To ourselves we justify our acts, &
We reason beyond acceptable logic.

But nothing can hide the facts, &
No effort can bring back our frolic. 

Just like that date which cannot be relived, 
Just like that tear which cannot be refunded, 

Just like that moment which cannot be returned, 
Just like that heartbeat which cannot be rehearsed, 

So our friendship cannot be rekindled, 
So our telepathy cannot be resumed, 

So our minds cannot be reconnected, 
So our union cannot be reestablished.

Our minds continue to conceive grudges and anger, 
Which often instantly erupts upon our interaction. 

Our heart sink in sadness of such languor, &
Stirs us to mutually end our pointless faction.

After our endless quarrels, &
After the explosion of the debris, dirt, & dust, 

We've now nullified our past laurels, &
For each other no longer lust. 

Although those moments may never return, 
Where we wake and sleep to each other's tune, 

The memories are mentally stored in an urn, &
Will be rekindled when we feel least immune.

The eventual death of our joint oneness
Brought back the best of our individuality.

It revoked all triggers to sadness, &
Summoned us towards our preferred reality. 







It was a rare, rare find! 
I say this with my heart and mind; 
I was so thrilled to find a man –
So learned, yet simple – I was his fan! 

A man of science
With conscience! 
He donned a string of fine degrees; 
The man was bent to fight disease; 
He occupied the highest chair
At MAHE’s academic hill, so rare.

I wondered how a man could rise
So adamantly, without vice
To be a great phenomenon –
A proud, prodigy physician.
He made his parents, country proud, 
And placed his family in ninth cloud! 



Step by step, he climbed each rung
Of life’s ladder to stay among
The most elite of medical men
With scholastic prowess and ken
That few Indians ev’r attained, 

He was an eminent teacher, 
And ‘State-of-the-art’ top reacher; 
A par excellence Professor, 
Erudite ex tempore speaker.

He loves to teach and train students, 
And toils to updat knowledge, hence; 
He wears a smile of humbleness
That masks a face of true greatness.


He continues still to be: 
A cardiologist- Teacher, 
A referee and researcher; 
An examiner and author; 
A friendly guide, philosopher.

For pursuing a noble role
Of healing people suffering
And yet, from others differing! 
Man in his early seventies, 


Keep your ethics and act sane; 
Fleece no patient who is sick; 
Quarrels with him, never pick.

Doctor, doctor, condescend; 
Treat your patient like your friend; 
Be patient until the end; 
Don’t look for rich dividend.

Doctor, doctor, listen well; 
Life for patients can be hell; 
Spend your life to save lives more; 
Don’t rub salt upon the sore! 

Doctor, doctor, health is wealth; 
Do not look for wealth in health; 
Do not use a rusty knife; 
Heed your conscience all through life.

Doctor, doctor, noble man! 
Make the world better, you can; 
Wonders many, you can do.

Doctor, doctor, health-carer! 
Be a good soul, torch-bearer; 
Do not accept gifts to heal; 
Life is worth more than money; 
Show your love and tender care; 
What is sweeter than honey? 

Be a nurse and love your work; 
Shower kindness on those ill; 
Ease their pain and heart’s anguish; 
Make their beds and give their pill.

Be a nurse and nobly live; 
Make the world a better place; 
When you make others happy, 
You ennoble human race.

Be a nurse, comforting sick; 
Extend life, give quality; 
Gain on earth, eternity


Thee gave me knowledge of human body 
And mind, illness afflicting; health shoddy!  

 Illness knows no poor or rich, good or bad
Visits all indiscriminate, makes sad
Let me treat equally all, not for money 
The relief that patients get- my honey! 

Medical Man’s Ethics- not to be hung
Simply on the wall- I know, but to hug
To my heart of hearts and follow sincere

Let me learn more and more, newer and newer
Help me cure my patients faster and faster
Let my fees be the last priority
Words of love and solace first priority! 

Page of tablets and tonics, let not my way
Keep them minimum to hold the sway
Consoling words and comforting touch 
All should cure my patient as a magic touch


Little KITTY LORIMER,
Fair, and young, and witty,
What has brought your ladyship
Rambling to the City?

All the Stags in Capel Court
Saw her lightly trip it;
All the lads of Stock Exchange
Twigg'd her muff and tippet.

With a sweet perplexity,
And a mystery pretty,
Threading through Threadneedle Street,
Trots the little KITTY.

What was my astonishment—
What was my compunction,
When she reached the Offices
Of the Didland Junction!

Up the Didland stairs she went,
To the Didland door, Sir;
Porters lost in wonderment,
Let her pass before, Sir.

'Madam,' says the old chief Clerk,
'Sure we can't admit ye.'
'Where's the Didland Junction deed?'
Dauntlessly says KITTY.

'If you doubt my honesty,
Look at my receipt, Sir.'
Up then jumps the old chief Clerk,
Smiling as he meets her.

KITTY at the table sits
(Whither the old Clerk leads her),
'I deliver this,' she says,
'As my act and deed, Sir.'

When I heard these funny words
Come from lips so pretty;
This, I thought, should surely be
Subject for a ditty.

What! are ladies stagging it?
Sure, the more's the pity;
But I've lost my heart to her,—
Naughty little KITTY. 


A dog, a cat, a bird, a bat, 
They all lived in a sailors hat; 
One day he said  'I'll throw you out, '
He did, they fell
Split splat, split splat.

(Written Feb My dog has died.
I buried him in the garden
next to a rusted old machine.


Some day I'll join him right there,
but now he's gone with his shaggy coat,
his bad manners and his cold nose,
and I, the materialist, who never believed
in any promised heaven in the sky
for any human being,
I believe in a heaven I'll never enter.
Yes, I believe in a heaven for all dogdom
where my dog waits for my arrival
waving his fan-like tail in friendship.

Ai, I'll not speak of sadness here on earth,
of having lost a companion
who was never servile.
His friendship for me, like that of a porcupine
withholding its authority,
was the friendship of a star, aloof,
with no more intimacy than was called for,
with no exaggerations:
he never climbed all over my clothes
filling me full of his hair or his mange,
he never rubbed up against my knee
like other dogs obsessed with sex.

No, my dog used to gaze at me,
paying me the attention I need,
the attention required
to make a vain person like me understand
that, being a dog, he was wasting time,
but, with those eyes so much purer than mine,
he'd keep on gazing at me
with a look that reserved for me alone
all his sweet and shaggy life,
always near me, never troubling me,
and asking nothing.

Ai, how many times have I envied his tail
as we walked together on the shores of the sea
in the lonely winter of Isla Negra
where the wintering birds filled the sky
and my hairy dog was jumping about
full of the voltage of the sea's movement:
my wandering dog, sniffing away
with his golden tail held high,
face to face with the ocean's spray.

Joyful, joyful, joyful,
as only dogs know how to be happy
with only the autonomy
of their shameless spirit.

There are no good-byes for my dog who has died,
and we don't now and never did lie to each other.

So now he's gone and I buried him,
and that's all there is to it.



He had drifted in among us as a straw drifts with the tide, 
He was just a wand'ring mongrel from the weary world outside; 
He was not aristocratic, being mostly ribs and hair, 
With a hint of spaniel parents and a touch of native bear. 
He was very poor and humble and content with what he got, 
So we fed him bones and biscuits, till he heartened up a lot; 
Then he growled and grew aggressive, treating orders with disdain, 
Till at last he bit the butcher, which would argue want of brain. 

Now the butcher, noble fellow, was a sport beyond belief, 
And instead of bringing actions he brought half a shin of beef, 
Which he handed on to Fido, who received it as a right 
And removed it to the garden, where he buried it at night. 

'Twas the means of his undoing, for my wife, who'd stood his friend, 
To adopt a slang expression, "went in off the deepest end", 
For among the pinks and pansies, the gloxinias and the gorse 
He had made an excavation like a graveyard for a horse. 

Then we held a consultation which decided on his fate: 
'Twas in anger more than sorrow that we led him to the gate, 
And we handed him the beef-bone as provision for the day, 
Then we opened wide the portal and we told him, "On your way

"A dog’s tale


A small dog shows his loyalty
 he sleeps beside his master grave.
By his own choice he is quite free
 to seek the home he does not have.

He leaves his post by morning light 
and sallies forth in search of food.
Where he is greeted with delight
 by children from the neighbourhood.

Polite and friendly he’ll accept 
what ever scraps may come his way.
The people know by night he slept
 beside his masters grave, he lay.

This duty although self imposed
 he carried out until he died
Though no one at that time supposed 
his fame would spread, become world wide.

Granted freedom of the city
A reward for his constancy
an honour very few can boast.

Epitome of loyalty
 this small dog earned his world wide fame.
By keeping vigil faithfully.
Grey Friars Bobby was his name.

His statue stands  for all to see.
Today keeps vigil in his stead
 but Bobby has gone hopefully
to lie beside his master’s bed.

The tourists come from far and wide
 to view his statue and to see
the place where Bobby lived and died
 in Greyfriars cemetery.

Jan-his is a poem about a dog
Not just any dog, but our dog.

It’s funny how everyone wanted to 
give him a name, but each name was not the same.

Some wanted to call him Tarzan
I called him Rex
My sister who is into books and stuff
Named him Malcolm X
My other younger sister called him Fofi
A tribute to our late dog
I didn’t really mind ‘bout the name
Doesn’t it sound a little like coffee? 
My younger brother called him Undertaker
Name of his favorite wrestler
I really loved  this name, but mother was like
"Come up with something else, this is not a game"
My older brother called him Jaguar, 
A name that’s good for a car

I remember once a friend said, 
You should do something before-
Your dog is  dead
I can see he’s suffering from multiple personality
You all should do something before you feel guilty
Of  his death.

Well to settle this matter
We all gathered - talked, argued
(everyone was so serious) 
For many hours composed of seconds and minutes
But we didn’t agree on anything.

 "Let me put an end to this controversy
But you should promise that you agree with me, 
I have come with the perfect name for the dog
And he shall be named DOG" mother said.

We all agreed.



Her coat shone silky smooth that afternoon. 
Her tail wagged like a metronome.
She raced the local kids around the oval.
They laughed and called her 'sausage dog'.

That night she stumbled on the stairs.
She whimpered when I tried to pick her up.
By midnight she was shivering with shock.
The vet suspected herniated discs.

Next day - incontinence and paraplegia.
The suited specialist duly kept us waiting.
Offered surgery (without a guarantee) .   
Two thousand dollars?  You must be joking! 

The breeder said 'Give old George a ring.
He'll soon have her on her feet again.
He treats them in an open fronted shed.
Calls himself a canine chiropractor.' 

George Schofield - nearly eighty five years old - 
A nugget of a man with heart of gold, 
Placed his stumpy hands upon her spine.
In seven days, my little dog was fine.


I used to range those farming fields, 
It became my daily habit; 
And oft when roaming far and wide, 
I'd catch a big fat rabbit.

Every possum, skunk and cat I saw
Were always under siege.
I'd chase them til completely pooped
Then sit and scratch my fleas.

But, then my master moved to town, 
Oh! What a dreadful change; 
Now, I am tethered to a leash, 
No longer can I range.

I cannot run, or bark, or jump
But, in neighbor's yard I poop.
My master, though required by law
Does not own a pooper-scoop.

They call me Rover, though I can't, 
That causes me much strife.
At last I've learned why one would say
'I'm leading a dog's life'. 

Dolls sit among the cushions 
as though they are waiting for her.
Their porcelain smiles, fixed, 
their eyes wide, a cobalt blue, 
and their dresses have lace collars.

Tiny tea cups on saucers are
arranged on a small table.
There's a pot with yellow flowers, 
taking centre place. It's surrounded 
by plastic cakes and pastries. 

On her bed is a huge rag doll, 
it's flopped over, looking helpless.
Her nightie is on the floor 
covering her slippers but the toes peep through.
Soon she'll be returning.

She'll run in daintily, 
go straight to the corner where I sit. 
I, with my broken arm, my one eye
and bald head.  Then she'll pick me up 
and call me her baby.

I was the first doll she ever had, 
still here, still treasured, 
but failing now, roughened by use, 
by play times, but thoroughly 
and most definitely loved. 

Daffodils, clear rills with musk-rose fills!  
Tweet-tweet, It's a feast in eyes of the green universe; 
With Her photographic smile, her youth blooms! 
With genuine style, her bosom blossoms, 
She is an apple of my eyes, my heart says; 
Jeepers creepers! A dolly bird is the seventh wonder of my heart! 

The beauty of a poem - romantic! 
The beauty of the music - sardonic, 
The beauty of light rays, 
The beauty of life says, 
Yet it is the beauty of the love fulfills! 
Holy mackerel! A dolly bird is the seventh wonder of my heart! 

Beauty is in her graceful walk! 
Beauty is in her witful talk, 
Beauty is in her voluptuous body - nice! 
Beauty is in her sleek smooth skin of my lady - spice, 
Her slender waist with tender heart! 
Holy moly! A dolly bird is the seventh wonder of my heart! 

Above all is small - a heart warm, 
With natural aura and a pretty smile, 
She's got the class and she's got the style! 
With personality at top, a heaven's charm, 
With the kind soul, She's got a catchy heart! 
Gordon Bennett! A dolly bird is the seventh wonder of my heart

In my early years, 
the streets of St. Paul were lined
on both sides with Dutch Elms, 
growing profusely across three seasons
of the year. The trees had grown
to great heights, and at the limit 
of their upward growth, the branches
spread out, and from both sides
they joined and created an arch
over street and boulevards, enclosing
them beneath a dome of leaves and branches.

It was under that dome I had
my being and grew from childhood
through adolescence into early manhood.
Sun shafts falling into the canopy
with their white light absorbed
them yellow-green of the leaves
and filtered that mellow color
over my existence. And its beauty
touched  me as deeply as any beauty
on earth, or any imaginable
in my young mind. And it lasted.

That sight was not only beautiful
in itself, but I believe it was the source
of my sense of beauty: what is calm 
and stable, upright and lasting, something
beyond me that yet still contains me, what
presents many things in the world which
hold me rapt in wonder, but also brings me
deep within to an interior place where
all is silent and absolutely still, and
my delight is a portion of the whole of wonder.
I spent many summer days, sitting

beneath that dome, with its lattice of branches
and canopy of leaves, reading the ancient poets -
Horace and Ovid, and further back, Theocritus
and Callimachus. They were the threshold
to a sacred time when gods and humans and animals
were all thriving under the dome of Gaia's life.
Each day ended for me as it did for them 
with the slow crescendo of the cicadas' tremulous song.
Beauty does not wait upon our wills or nature.
It is a perpetual stretching out in revelation, then
a movement forward into some other arena

of display. We who live our lives, burnished
and bright, under the light of the sun
must take what is offered, when it is offered, 
bound as we are to time, which also also does
not wait upon our wills or nature. Time is not 
pitched for human delight. It is poetry's mission
to bring delight within the boundary of time.
What else can we do but surrender to time's flow, 
link it to beauty by means of verse, and watch
their royal procession under the dome
of Dutch Elms passing through our lives. 

Clorinda met me on the way
As I came from the train;
Her face was anything but gay,
In fact, suggested pain.
"Oh hubby, hubby dear!" she cried,
"I've awful news to tell. . . 

"
"What is it, darling?" I replied;
"Your mother -- is she well?"

"Oh no! oh no! it is not that,
It's something else," she wailed,
My heart was beating pit-a-pat,
My ruddy visage paled.
Like lightning flash in heaven's dome
The fear within me woke:
"Don't say," I cried, "our little home
Has all gone up in smoke!"

She shook her head. Oh, swift I clasped
And held her to my breast;
"The children! Tell me quick," I gasped,
"Believe me, it is best

"
Then, then she spoke; 'mid sobs I caught
These words of woe divine:
"It's coo-coo-cook has gone and bought
A new hat just like mine

"Another dominating force emerging on horizon
The area of influence is divided into zones
They are out to destroy the hegemony created by man
It is now power lobby and struggle waged by women

They are up in arms against so called dominating zone
They have made great impact and made their presence known
They have made in roads and have come up of their own
Men might have not liked their escape from yoke and frowned

How long one can be kept at bay for no reasons? 
The resistance is bound to emerge by right thinking persons
The flowers adore the garden in all the seasons
Why women can’t find suitable place and come on

They have suffered terribly under male domination
Complete freedom for them was never raised and was out of question
It was male chauvinism that was only main hurdle
The women have opened the front and come out in middle

It is their legitimate right to breathe in fresh air
They are not glass dolls loitering here with bobbed hair
They are clear in their ambition and has made powerful drive
No one can term it miracle and has to recognize and believe

They have their class of own and worth to prove
Large section of people may oppose and disprove
How can we muffle the voice of women for their rights? 
They have every right to come out for rights and fight

They have largest numbers in developed and non developed countries
It was adding insult to their woes and miseries
The cruelty committed on them are appearing as main led stories
It is cause of tension for right thinking people and adding worries

What can be termed as trumphatant victory? 
Jubilation all over with no more sorry
It is well deserved crown for their long battle
They were tied up at home like animals

The sun may shine uniformally over globe
No more complaints and no more probes
It is fine way leading to the leading to the tunnel
They are fine blend of personalities to be observed in channels


They may look victorious is clear win or triumph
They are known as capable and better half
Everything may move on now with complete harmony
It is cherished dream and might have not dreamed by many

Woman is incarnation of living god
We owe many things to them and have got
They were side by side when wars were fought
They are combination of that entire and that is what we are taught


A pretty donkey's pretty dream                                            To be a pretty singer needs pretty                                       Time to sing a very pretty song                                           Because its voice is so harsh, so                                         It needs a million of light years                                        To improve its voice adjustments,                                       A pretty donkey made up its mind                                         To fly up in the sky, but                                                  Unfortunately it lost because it                                        Did not think well at that time,                                          A pretty donkey wants to have a                                          Driver's test to be licensed, but                                          Unfortunately it failed because                                        Its eye test failed completely,                                       A pretty donkey wants to go to                                          A concert, but he can not go                                            Because it needs to walk on two legs,                                  A pretty donkey made up its mind                                          To write all its donkey diaries, but                                     Unfortunately it was illiterate, so                                       It decided to go to the donkey's school                                        To learn all about the donkey's life. 

They sought a new truth	
The door opened yet again
Still, no one entered


Where do you go now? 
It depends on where you are
A door works both ways


A door just opened on a street--
   I, lost, was passing by--
An instant's width of warmth disclosed
   And wealth, and company.

The door as sudden shut, and I,
   I, lost, was passing by,--
Lost doubly, but by contrast most,
   Enlightening misery. 

I' got no patience with blues at all!
And I ust to kindo talk
Aginst 'em, and claim, 'tel along last Fall,
They was none in the fambly stock;
But a nephew of mine, from Eelinoy,
That visited us last year,
He kindo convinct me differunt
While he was a-stayin' here.

Frum ever'-which way that blues is from,
They'd tackle him ever' ways;
They'd come to him in the night, and come
On Sundays, and rainy days;
They'd tackle him in corn-plantin' time,
And in harvest, and airly Fall,
But a dose 't of blues in the wintertime,
He 'lowed, was the worst of all!

Said all diseases that ever he had--
The mumps, er the rheumatiz--
Er ever'-other-day-aigger's bad
Purt' nigh as anything is!--
Er a cyarbuncle, say, on the back of his neck,
Er a felon on his thumb,--
But you keep the blues away from him,
And all o' the rest could come!

And he'd moan, 'They's nary a leaf below!
Ner a spear o' grass in sight!
And the whole wood-pile's clean under snow!
And the days is dark as night!
You can't go out--ner you can't stay in--
Lay down--stand up--ner set!'
And a tetch o' regular tyfoid-blues
Would double him jest clean shet!

I writ his parents a postal-kyard,
He could stay 'tel Spring-time come;
And Aprile first, as I rickollect,
Was the day we shipped him home!
Most o' his relatives, sence then,
Has either give up, er quit,
Er jest died off; but I understand
He's the same old color yit

Do you blame me that I loved him?
If when standing all alone
I cried for bread a careless world
Pressed to my lips a stone.

Do you blame me that I loved him,
That my heart beat glad and free,
When he told me in the sweetest tones
He loved but only me?

Can you blame me that I did not see
Beneath his burning kiss
The serpent's wiles, nor even hear
The deadly adder hiss?

Can you blame me that my heart grew cold
The tempted, tempter turned;
When he was feted and caressed
And I was coldly spurned?

Would you blame him, when you draw from me
Your dainty robes aside,
If he with gilded baits should claim
Your fairest as his bride?

Would you blame the world if it should press
On him a civic crown;
And see me struggling in the depth
Then harshly press me down?

Crime has no sex and yet to-day
I wear the brand of shame;
Whilst he amid the gay and proud
Still bears an honored name.

Can you blame me if I've learned to think
Your hate of vice a sham,
When you so coldly crushed me down
And then excused the man?

Would you blame me if to-morrow
The coroner should say,
A wretched girl, outcast, forlorn,
Has thrown her life away?

Yes, blame me for my downward course,
But oh! remember well,
Within your homes you press the hand
That led me down to hell.

He does not see as man;
Within His love I know there's room
For those whom others ban.

I think before His great white throne,
His throne of spotless light,
That whited sepulchres shall wear
The hue of endless night.

That I who fell, and he who sinned,
Shall reap as we have sown;
That each the burden of his loss
Must bear and bear alone.

No golden weights can turn the scale
Of justice in His sight;
And what is wrong in woman's life
In man's cannot be right.A doubt if it be Us
Assists the staggering Mind
In an extremer Anguish
Until it footing find.

An Unreality is lent,
A merciful Mirage
That makes the living possible
While it suspends the lives. 

I didn’t realize it will soon last
The union may end very fast
It was never expected to happen
It took place all of sudden

We had faced lot of difficulties
It was full of uncertainties
It dragged on for unspecified years
We too did not yield and grounded ears

The sun was its peak with lot to smile
We too were living with our own style
It did not occur in mind for a second or while
It did turn dramatically to turn against meanwhile

It was cruel joke and shattered our dream
The sun too started to ooze with his beam
I couldn’t find coolness in moon light
Everything was turning against and not going right

Did Almighty think our love was not real? 
Had we not done enough for wounds to heal? 
Was it not His wish to bless us for long time? 
What was our fault or commitment of crime? 

It has served us biggest blow
The river water has stopped to flow
The eyes have stopped to see and glow
The life has come to grinding halt or become slow

What should I dream of left out world? 
My body is crumbling and shivering in cold
I may have to suffer and undergo sufferings untold
I still have faith in you and soul not sold

I shall look down to earth from heaven
I know the disgrace has fallen
You may be crying with face sullen
Our bond is broken all of sudden

I may not loose sense or faint
I have nothing to with complaint
I shall fulfill the left out mission
I have no guilt in mind for admission


They took early the message: 
His known nod.*
And concentrated the clouds high up on Olymp
brooding over menacing shadows their assault.
Frowned too Ossa's peaks.
Started darkening the sky.
Shadows flooded pastures, ravines, 
covered prairies, gorges, glens, dingles.

The whole area all around in heavy mist.
Smites Boreas the mountaineer lull.
Ready the royal vehicle to carry the pyr.
Neighing the devine steeds.
The great charioteer parades over clouds in rage.
Lightnings, thunderbolts upon ridges expels.
From its roots up the mega mountain quakes.

Mature the downfall.
The first raindrops in bursting attack.
Bush, tree leaves clug.
Shepherds, herds, wild beasts, 
Nymphs, Muses, Sileni
the omens discern: 
''Α niche, nook to protect, alcove, cave.''

Rushing the downpour 
drums on the ground in dance wild.
Brooks, runlets, torrents and rills run, 
flow in haste the slopes deep.
Defeated obstacles on land wide wide, 
capsized cockles swirling in plight.

To His Mercy an appeal? 
They laugh! 
'' In necessity's loop bound are gods too.''
Speed, feathers on feet to save.



Beloved, having dragged the net about us,
And knitted mesh to mesh, we grow immortal;
And that old harp awakens of itself
To cry aloud to the grey birds, and dreams,
That have had dreams, live in us. 


Hence Burgundy, Claret, and Port, 
Away with old Hock and madeira, 
Too earthly ye are for my sport; 
There's a beverage brighter and clearer. 
Instead of a piriful rummer, 
My wine overbrims a whole summer; 
My bowl is the sky, 
And I drink at my eye, 
Till I feel in the brain 
A Delphian pain - 
Then follow, my Caius! then follow: 
On the green of the hill 
We will drink our fill 
Of golden sunshine, 
Till our brains intertwine 
With the glory and grace of Apollo! 
And of the East and West, 
To thee my soul is flown, 
And my body is earthward press'd. - 
It is an awful mission, 
A terrible division; 
And leaves a gulph austere 
To be fill'd with worldly fear. 
Aye, when the soul is fled 
To high above our head, 
Affrighted do we gaze 
After its airy maze, 
As doth a mother wild, 
When her young infant child 
Is in an eagle's claws - 
And is not this the cause 
Thou bearest me along 
Through sights I scarce can bear: 
O let me, let me share 
With the hot lyre and thee, 
The staid Philosophy. 
Temper my lonely hours, 
And let me see thy bowers 
More unalarm'd

Once a dream did weave a shade
 O'er my angel-guarded bed,
 That an emmet lost its way
 Where on grass methought I lay.
 
 Troubled, wildered, and forlorn,
 Dark, benighted, travel-worn,
 Over many a tangle spray,
 All heart-broke, I heard her say:
 
 'Oh my children! do they cry,
 Do they hear their father sigh? 
 Now they look abroad to see,
 Now return and weep for me.'
 
 Pitying, I dropped a tear:
 But I saw a glow-worm near,
 Who replied, 'What wailing wight
 Calls the watchman of the night? 
 
 'I am set to light the ground,
 While the beetle goes his round:
 Follow now the beetle's hum; 
 Little wanderer, hie thee home! 

 'Once in a dream (for once I dreamed of you)
We stood together in an open field;
Above our heads two swift-winged pigeons wheeled,
Sporting at ease and courting full in view.
When loftier still a broadening darkness flew,
Down-swooping, and a ravenous hawk revealed;
Too weak to fight, too fond to fly, they yield;
So farewell life and love and pleasures new.
Then as their plumes fell fluttering to the ground,
Their snow-white plumage flecked with crimson drops,
I wept, and thought I turned towards you to weep:
But you were gone; while rustling hedgerow tops
Bent in a wind which bore to me a sound
Of far-off piteous bleat of lambs and sheep. 

Was it a dream? We sail'd, I thought we sail'd,
Martin and I, down the green Alpine stream,
Border'd, each bank, with pines; the morning sun,
On the wet umbrage of their glossy tops,
On the red pinings of their forest-floor, 
Drew a warm scent abroad; behind the pines
The mountain-skirts, with all their sylvan change
Of bright-leaf'd chestnuts and moss'd walnut-trees
And the frail scarlet-berried ash, began.
Swiss chalets glitter'd on the dewy slopes, 
And from some swarded shelf, high up, there came
Notes of wild pastoral music--over all
Ranged, diamond-bright, the eternal wall of snow.
Upon the mossy rocks at the stream's edge,
Back'd by the pines, a plank-built cottage stood, 
Bright in the sun; the climbing gourd-plant's leaves
Muffled its walls, and on the stone-strewn roof
Lay the warm golden gourds; golden, within,
Under the eaves, peer'd rows of Indian corn.
We shot beneath the cottage with the stream. 
On the brown, rude-carved balcony, two forms
Came forth--Olivia's, Marguerite! and thine.
Clad were they both in white, flowers in their breast;
Straw hats bedeck'd their heads, with ribbons blue,
Which danced, and on their shoulders, fluttering, play'd. 
They saw us, they conferred; their bosoms heaved,
And more than mortal impulse fill'd their eyes.
Their lips moved; their white arms, waved eagerly,
Flash'd once, like falling streams; we rose, we gazed.
One moment, on the rapid's top, our boat 
Hung poised--and then the darting river of Life
(Such now, methought, it was), the river of Life,
Loud thundering, bore us by; swift, swift it foam'd,
Black under cliffs it raced, round headlands shone.
Soon the plank'd cottage by the sun-warm'd pines 
Faded--the moss--the rocks; us burning plains,
Bristled with cities, us the sea received. 


Once I dreamed I awoke on a ship
In my own special room, as she swayed and dipped
Touching and seeing the things in my dream
I stopped at the railing and looked at the sea
And it just as fine and as clear as could be
But storm clouds arose and the ship began to toss
I ran back to my room, completely at loss
How to find a life jacket somewhere on that boat
Something in case, just to keep me afloat
I hunted for hours; it seemed quite a search
But when I woke up, I was wearing a purse. 


I dreamt of autumn in the window's twilight, 
And you, a tipsy jesters' throng amidst. ' 
And like a falcon, having stooped to slaughter, 
My heart returned to settle on your wrist. 

But time went on, grew old and deaf. Like thawing 
Soft ice old silk decayed on easy chairs. 
A bloated sunset from the garden painted 
The glass with bloody red September tears. 


But time grew old and deaf. And you, the loud one, 
Quite suddenly were still. This broke a spell. 
The dreaming ceased at once, as though in answer 
To an abruptly silenced bell. 

And I awakened. Dismal as the autumn 
The dawn was dark. A stronger wind arose 
To chase the racing birchtrees on the skyline, 
As from a running cart the streams of straws. 


I had a dream--a strange, wild dream--
Said a dear voice at early light;
And even yet its shadows seem
To linger in my waking sight.

Earth, green with spring, and fresh with dew,
And bright with morn, before me stood;
And airs just wakened softly blew
On the young blossoms of the wood.

Birds sang within the sprouting shade,
Bees hummed amid the whispering grass,
And children prattled as they played
Beside the rivulet's dimpling glass

Fast climbed the sun: the flowers were flown,
There played no children in the glen;
For some were gone, and some were grown
To blooming dames and bearded men.


'Twas noon, 'twas summer: I beheld
Woods darkening in the flush of day,
And that bright rivulet spread and swelled,
A mighty stream, with creek and bay.

And here was love, and there was strife,
And mirthful shouts, and wrathful cries,
And strong men, struggling as for life,
With knotted limbs and angry eyes.

Now stooped the sun--the shades grew thin;
The rustling paths were piled with leaves;
And sunburnt groups were gathering in,
From the shorn field, its fruits and sheaves.

The river heaved with sullen sounds;
The chilly wind was sad with moans;
Black hearses passed, and burial-grounds
Grew thick with monumental stones.


Still waned the day; the wind that chased
The jagged clouds blew chillier yet;
The woods were stripped, the fields were waste,
The wintry sun was near its set.

And of the young, and strong, and fair,
A lonely remnant, gray and weak,
Lingered, and shivered to the air
Of that bleak shore and water bleak.

Ah! age is drear, and death is cold!
I turned to thee, for thou wert near,
And saw thee withered, bowed, and old,
And woke all faint with sudden fear.

'Twas thus I heard the dreamer say,
And bade her clear her clouded brow;
'For thou and I, since childhood's day,
Have walked in such a dream till now.


'Watch we in calmness, as they rise,
The changes of that rapid dream,
And note its lessons, till our eyes
Shall open in the morning beam.


'I dreamed I was a spider;
A big, fat, hungry spider;
A lusty, rusty spider
With a dozen palsied limbs;
With a dozen limbs that dangled
Where three wretched flies were tangled
And their buzzing wings were strangled
In the middle of their hymns.


And I mocked them like a demon--
A demoniacal demon
Who delights to be a demon
For the sake of sin alone;
And with fondly false embraces
Did I weave my mystic laces
Round their horror-stricken faces
Till I muffled every groan.

And I smiled to see them weeping,
For to see an insect weeping,
Sadly, sorrowfully weeping,
Fattens every spider's mirth;
And to note a fly's heart quaking,
And with anguish ever aching
Till you see it slowly breaking
Is the sweetest thing on earth.

I experienced a pleasure,
Such a highly-flavored pleasure,
Such intoxicating pleasure,
That I drank of it like wine;
And my mortal soul engages
That no spider on the pages
Of the history of ages
Felt a rapture more divine.


I careened around and capered--
Madly, mystically capered--
For three days and nights I capered
Round my web in wild delight;
Till with fierce ambition burning,
And an inward thirst and yearning
I hastened my returning
With a fiendish appetite.

And I found my victims dying,
'Ha!' they whispered, 'we are dying!'
Faintly whispered, 'we are dying,
And our earthly course is run.'
And the scene was so impressing
That I breathed a special blessing,
As I killed them with caressing
And devoured them one by one. 


I dreamed
A dream of you,
Not as you seemed
When you were late unkind
And blind
To my eyes' pleading for a debt long due,
But touched and true
And all inclined
To tenderest fancies on love's inmost theme.
How sweet you were to me and ah, how kind
In that dear dream!

I felt
Your lips on mine
Mingle and melt,
And your cheek touch my cheek.
I, weak
With vain desires and askings for a sign
Of love divine,
Found my grief break,
And wept and wept in an unending stream
Of sudden joy set free, yet could not speak,
Dumb in my dream.

I knew
You loved me then,
And I knew too
The bliss of souls in Heaven
New--shriven,
Who look with pity on still sinning men,
And turn again
To be forgiven
And spend themselves in praise from morn till even
Nor break their dream.

I woke
In my mid bliss,
At midnight's stroke,
And knew you lost and gone.
Forlorn
I called you back to my unfinished kiss,
But only this
One word of scorn
You answered me, 


'Twas better loved to seem
Than loved to be, since all love is forsworn,
Always a dream.''Amid the mystic fields of Love
I wander'd, and beheld a grove.
Breathlessly still was part, and part
Was breathing with an easy heart;
And there below, in lamblike game,
Were virgins, all so much the same,
That each was all. A youth drew nigh,
And on them gazed with wandering eye,
And would have pass'd, but that a maid,
Clapping her hands above her, said,
‘My time is now!’ and laughing ran
After the dull and strange young man,
And bade him stop and look at her.
And so he call'd her lovelier
Than any else, only because
She only then before him was.
And, while they stood and gazed, a change
Was seen in both, diversely strange:
The youth was ever more and more
That good which he had been before;
But the glad maiden grew and grew
Such that the rest no longer knew
Their sister, who was now to sight
The young man's self, yet opposite,
As the outer rainbow is the first,
But weaker, and the hues reversed.
And whereas, in the abandon'd grove,
The virgin round the Central Love
Had blindly circled in her play,
Now danced she round her partner's way;
And, as the earth the moon's, so he
Had the responsibility 
Of her diviner motion. ‘Lo,’
He sang, and the heavens began to glow,
‘The pride of personality,
Seeking its highest, aspires to die,
And in unspeakably profound
Humiliation Love is crown'd!
And from his exaltation still
Into his ocean of good-will
He curiously casts the lead
To find strange depths of lowlihead.’

To one same tune, but higher, ‘Bold,’
The maiden sang, ‘is Love! For cold
On Earth are blushes, and for shame
Of such an ineffectual flame
As ill consumes the sacrifice!


’If Sky is my way, 
And Rainbow is my chariot, 
Where Sun and Moon will be the torch of my chariot, 
Clouds as the feathers of my chariot, 
And Wind as the fuel of my chariot, 
Now I can flight everywhere like an omnipresent; 
To find out my lover, 
As I dont know where she is-
and she doesn't know that I Love her.
But I'll gift her the glowing stars- 
as diamonds on her crown.. 

Each night, earth life suspended, 
Without asking where you are going
Or who you are, you experience
As if life dreams of itself, 
Content to keep happy, immortality 
Behind the curtain of sleep.
It's a world you have no word for
And though it was real at the moment, 
You call it a dream, 
Which is lost as you awake. 


Today I slipped into a dream
And saw a better world
A world of peace and gentleness
Before my eyes unfurled

And in my fantasy beheld
A vision of mankind
All set beneath a bow of fire
In glory full enshrined

His voice was singing so in tune
With all that was around
That such a heav`nly melody
Did o`er the earth resound

And all the hands that owned contempt
Were clasped together tight
To form a ring of unity - 
`Twas such a splendid sight

Then all the eyes that never saw
How wondrous life could be
So glinted through the bow of fire -
It surely dazzled me

For all humanity became
As just one beating heart
Together joined in harmony
Thus no more set apart

At night he gazed upon the stars
By day towards the sun
To mingle with the fruitful earth
With all he was at one

Then all the trees bowed down in awe
All creatures danced and played
All flowers spread their petals wide
As `neath the sun they swayed

(But this was just a wistful dream
One that may never be
A vision in a saddened heart -
`Twas just a fantasy)       

Today I slipped into a dream
And saw a better world
Where  sixteen billion gemstones flashed
Which in her hair were purled


In visions of the dark night
        I have dreamed of joy departed-
      But a waking dream of life and light
        Hath left me broken-hearted.

      Ah! what is not a dream by day
        To him whose eyes are cast
      On things around him with a ray
        Turned back upon the past?

      That holy dream- that holy dream,
        While all the world were chiding,
      Hath cheered me as a lovely beam
        A lonely spirit guiding.

      What though that light, thro' storm and night,
        So trembled from afar-
      What could there be more purely bright
        In Truth's day-star


You sat there with a smile
That lit up the night
I thought to myself
What an incredible beautiful sight

Long straight black hair
Teeth that gleamed so white
Without even trying
She sure knows how to excite

Clothes that fit so perfectly
On a form that looks so good
When I see the word beauty
It is so clearly understood

I have never talked with you
But I see you all the time
Because of you these words I wrote
All came together in a rhyme






dream of you and me.
Our shared bond and unity.
An eternal love story to last the ages, 
inspiring people well beyond
our lives completed pages.
My Angel and me locked in
true loves bond, 
a sacred coupling sealed in
celestial unity for all time.

A dream of you and me, 
a sacred bond of eternal unity.



I mean, are you even real? 
For me you're more than perfect
My heart skips when I look back
To the days we were together
Never cared about the weather
The best life had to offer
In a rose garden I found a four-leaf clover
Without you I'm lost, dead and hopeless
My love without you can't exist I confess
So don't let me wake up
In the cold, harsh world, but stay a dream and keep me locked up


Guid-Mornin' to our Majesty! 
May Heaven augment your blisses 
On ev'ry new birth-day ye see, 
A humble poet wishes. 
My bardship here, at your Levee 
On sic a day as this is, 
Is sure an uncouth sight to see, 
Amang thae birth-day dresses 
Sae fine this day. 

I see ye're complimented thrang, 
By mony a lord an' lady; 
That's unco easy said aye: 
The poets, too, a venal gang, 
Wi' rhymes weel-turn'd an' ready, 
Wad gar you trow ye ne'er do wrang, 
But aye unerring steady, 
On sic a day. 

For me! before a monarch's face 
Ev'n there I winna flatter; 
For neither pension, post, nor place, 
Am I your humble debtor: 
So, nae reflection on your Grace, 
Your Kingship to bespatter; 
There's mony waur been o' the race, 
And aiblins ane been better 
Than you this day. 

'Tis very true, my sovereign King, 
My skill may weel be doubted; 
But facts are chiels that winna ding, 
An' downa be disputed: 
Your royal nest, beneath your wing, 
Is e'en right reft and clouted, 
And now the third part o' the string, 
An' less, will gang aboot it 
Than did ae day.Far be't frae me that I aspire 
To blame your legislation, 
Or say, ye wisdom want, or fire, 
To rule this mighty nation: 
But faith! I muckle doubt, my sire, 
Ye've trusted ministration 
To chaps wha in barn or byre 
Wad better fill'd their station 
Than courts yon day. 

And now ye've gien auld Britain peace, 
Her broken shins to plaister, 
Your sair taxation does her fleece, 
Till she has scarce a tester: 
Nae bargain wearin' faster, 
Or, faith! I fear, that, wi' the geese, 
I shortly boost to pasture 
I' the craft some day. 

I'm no mistrusting Willie Pitt, 
When taxes he enlarges, 
(An' Will's a true guid fallow's get, 
A name not envy spairges), 
That he intends to pay your debt, 
An' lessen a' your charges; 
Abridge your bonie barges 
An'boats this day. 

Adieu, my Liege; may freedom geck 
Beneath your high protection; 
An' may ye rax Corruption's neck, 
And gie her for dissection! 
But since I'm here, I'll no neglect, 
In loyal, true affection, 
May fealty an' subjection 
This great birth-day. 

Hail, Majesty most Excellent! 
While nobles strive to please ye, 
Will ye accept a compliment, 
A simple poet gies ye? 
Thae bonie bairntime, Heav'n has lent, 
Still higher may they heeze ye 
In bliss, till fate some day is sent 
For ever to release ye 
Frae care that day. 

For you, young Potentate o'Wales, 
I tell your highness fairly, 
Down Pleasure's stream, wi' swelling sails, 
I'm tauld ye're driving rarely; 
But some day ye may gnaw your nails, 
An' curse your folly sairly, 
That e'er ye brak Diana's pales, 
Or rattl'd dice wi' Charlie 
By night or day. 

Yet aft a ragged cowt's been known, 
To mak a noble aiver; 
So, ye may doucely fill the throne, 
For a'their clish-ma-claver: 
There, himat Agincourt wha shone, 
Few better were or braver: 
And yet, wi' funny, queer Sir John,




I was so dead I wondered at no thing,-- 
Not even that the angels slowly turned 
Their faces, speechless, as I hurried by 
(Beneath my feet the golden pavements burned); 

Because the heavens stretched endlessly like space. 
At last a terror siezed my very soul; 
I seemed alone in all the crowded place. 

Then, sudden, one compassionate cried out, 
Though like the rest his face from me he turned, 
As I were one no angel might regard 
(Beneath my feet the golden pavements burned): 

Who does not know his loving mercy swift 
But waits the moment consummate and ripe, 
Each burden, from each human soul to lift
 


Though I was dead, I died again for shame; 
Lonely, to flee from heaven again I turned; 
The ranks of angels looked away from me 
(Beneath my feet the golden pavements burned). 

I heard the dogs howl in the moonlight night; 
I went to the window to see the sight;
All the Dead that ever I knew 
Going one by one and two by two. 

On they pass'd, and on they pass'd; 
Townsfellows all, from first to last; 
Born in the moonlight of the lane, 
Quench'd in the heavy shadow again. 

Schoolmates, marching as when they play'd 
At soldiers once - but now more staid; 
Those were the strangest sight to me 
Who were drown'd, I knew, in the awful sea.

Straight and handsome folk, bent and weak, too; 
Some that I loved, and gasp'd to speak to;
Some but a day in their churchyard bed; 
Some that I had not known were dead. 

A long, long crowd - where each seem'd lonely, 
Yet of them all there was one, one only, 
Raised a head or look'd my way; 
She linger'd a moment - she might not stay. 

How long since I saw that fair pale face! 
Ah! Mother dear! might I only place 
My head on thy breast, a moment to rest, 
While thy hand on my tearful cheek were prest! 

On, on, a moving bridge they made 
Across the moon-stream, from shade to shade, 
Young and old, women and men; 
Many long-forgot, but remembered then, 

And first there came a bitter laughter;
A sound of tears a moment after; 
And then a music so lofty and gay, 
That eve morning, day by day, 
I strive to recall it if I may. 

Only a dream, a beautiful baseless dream; 
Only a bright 
Flash from your eyes, a brief electrical gleam, 
Charged with delight. 

Only a waking, alone, in the moon's last gleam 
Fading from sight; 
Only a flooding of tears that shudder and stream 
Fast through the night. 


As Hermes once took to his feathers light,
When lulled Argus, baffled, swooned and slept,
So on a Delphic reed, my idle spright
So played, so charmed, so conquered, so bereft
The dragon-world of all its hundred eyes;
And seeing it asleep, so fled away,
Not to pure Ida with its snow-cold skies,
Nor unto Tempe, where Jove grieved a day;
But to that second circle of sad Hell,
Where in the gust, the whirlwind, and the flaw
Of rain and hail-stones, lovers need not tell
Their sorrows. Pale were the sweet lips I saw,
Pale were the lips I kissed, and fair the form
I floated with, about that melancholy storm. 


wish me luck on the trip

Last night's dream was awfully unusual
Some thing I rarely have experienced
Death and destruction not of Nature's 
But the casualties caused by humans.

Heartless, robot like cruel humans
Striking adults with black cannons
Smashing babies like clay figures.
Body parts scattered every where.

Amid all that chaos stood my 
Frozen, cold face, statue like figure 
Devoid of any grief or sadness
Or the slightest frantic awareness. 
 
Though in all honesty I should have been
Trembling and moaning with eyes closed
Unable to wake up from that horrible dream
But nothing like that of sort happened.

Waking consciousness took over eventually
Reconstructing the dream I became fearful
Recollecting my frozen icy expression
How should I think of that mental regression.

Does it resemble our mostly quiet life style
Partly brought upon with advancing years
Where deprived of new life adventures
Calm mind descends into eon collections.


Free and unhindered plays in its own scenarios
Or is it that I have become immune to suffering
Death, destruction, gunshots and bomb blasts
All kind of horror acts known for happenings.

It causes no emotional disturbance or
Personal impact when seen from a distance
Is it emotional maturity or lack of empathy? 
A horrible state of mind to be in certainly.

To lose compassion for pain and suffering! 
To become a neutral witness of dying babies! 
Such a person not even in my dreams.

Let me remain a human with a grieving heart, 
Extending a helping hand whenever I could, 
Let me not be without the love and empathy
That connects us all from farthest of distance.

Let this dream not be the indication of what 
Lies there beyond the time called golden years 
When life transforms me into a heartless
Stone cold figure in a fragile cage of bones. 


A child riding his three wheeler
A big truck follows 
Wraps the child
And his three wheeler 
In the front left wheel of truck
From the back of car window
I watch helpless.  

not knowing
If the child survived or not
Last thing I remember is his 
Smiling face 
Getting the thrill ride
On his three wheeler
Dream breaks—-
The fear, the anxiety
The sadness persists.

Being helpless is the worst
Thing in life
Back in past my little kids 
Have taken many a thrill rides
On their three wheeler
And I ran with them
Or after them in the middle of street
To make sure the oncoming 
Traffic saw us
Fear never kept us away from 
Enjoying little things
And I never felt helpless
That had let us live our life 
Safe and secure.

Now I sense an aura of fear
All around dealing with news
Of young children, even grownups
Being shot by others
At the slightest of provocation
Some time even without provocation
Be it by the hands of police, gang members
Mentally sick or avengers
What troubles me most is the thought
That the shooters too have lost
Their sense of security
They have weapon, yet fear of having
The other person a weapon makes
Them shoot an unarmed person.

In fear of death one must put
His own survival first-
There is no denial of the fact
But can any body perform
The duty of protecting others
With so much fear for their own life
And how can a citizen live his life
Not knowing which of his action
Would result in altercation with authority
Or other community members
How can one live with so much fear? 
How long can we ignore the demand
That give a gun in each hand 
Or take the guns away from all
How long can we ignore the distrust
That nobody is protecting here any body
But their own selves
That jungle law still prevails in civil society
How long can we run away from our selves 
When we have every thing to fear
And nothing to assure us. 


A dream for you
And one for me; 
A mermaid's blue, 
A symphony, 
A secret house
Inside a tree
The dreamworld's full
Of company.

At night we go
To places rare, 
Where no one knows
That they are there; 
And every dream
A hidden stair, 
That takes us to
A new somewhere.

If only dreams
Could overlap
The sleeping seams
Within our nap, 
And precious streams
Not on a map
Then other lives, 
We could unwrap. 


Upon the saddle I am mounted
My foot in the stirrup is set
Precious time is happily counted
a kinder horse have I never met
Upon the rocky trail I ride
I enjoy fresh air and tree-given shade
Within this horse my trust I confide
and I new friend I have surely made
Though the hills are steep and the trail is rough
This horse has been well-trained
Through the rugged trail, he proves hardy and tough
He knows the way and needs not to be reined
I hear the water of a running creek
I spot a lone deer in the distance
At the sight of this animal, I am unable to speak
While upon a horse she ignores my existence
Closer to nature I start to feel
Trees on either side I can see
Almost like a dream, yet so real
There has never been a happier me
But the trail has ended, I start to cry
I will have a horse of my own! 


But when? 
For now, I depart and heave a big sigh
And look forward to the rocky trail againi lay here and dream a dream 
a dream of my future
a dream where i smile
a real smile not the fake one i hide behind

but my real smile
for i am the real me
in this dream 
i am happy 

i laugh
a laugh i haven't done in years 
in this dream i live a life where i am wanted by those around me
in this dream i feel like i belong where i am 


for in this dream i no longer live alone 
i have a group of friends 
that enjoys my company
that choose to hang with me
not as a last resort

or some cruel joke
but because they like me 
if that is possible
for it was in this dream 
it was wonderful 

the feeling of belonging
is one i have never felt 
besides in this dream
will this dream ever become true



The pretty world                                                          Around us and in us                                                       Is like a flashy dream,                                                      When we grasp it,                                                         It flies away like a passing cloud.                                                   It's the dream that lives in us                                                And we don't live in it because                                             It does not stay.                                                                It's a difficult dream that                                                    Flips from between your hands.                                              It's a tricky dream that                                                    You live it for long time, then                                           It goes suddenly in a moment.                                                It's a moment that goes quickly                                                 In a huge trip in one's life.                                              It's our pretty dream that we                                                 Live it for a short period of time.                                          This is our pretty life                                                       Summed up in one pretty moment                                                     That vanishes suddenly.                                                       The whole life is like a pretty                                                Dream that is a moment that                                                           Goes away quickly though we feel it                                              Like a long trip in our life.

A dream lies dead here. May you softly go 
Before this place, and turn away your eyes, 
Nor seek to know the look of that which dies 
Importuning Life for life. Walk not in woe, 
But, for a little, let your step be slow. 
And, of your mercy, be not sweetly wise 
With words of hope and Spring and tenderer skies. 
A dream lies dead; and this all mourners know: 

Whenever one drifted petal leaves the tree- 
Though white of bloom as it had been before 
And proudly waitful of fecundity- 
One little loveliness can be no more; 
And so must Beauty bow her imperfect head 
Because a dream has joined the wistful dead

Mellow hazes, lowly trailing
Over wood and meadow, veiling
Somber skies, with wildfowl sailing
Sailor-like to foreign lands;
And the north-wind overleaping
Summer's brink, and floodlike sweeping
Wrecks of roses where the weeping
Willows wring their helpless hands.

Flared, like Titan torches flinging
Flakes of flame and embers, springing
From the vale the trees stand swinging
In the moaning atmosphere;
While in dead'ning-lands the lowing
Of the cattle, sadder growing,
Fills the sense to overflowing
With the sorrow of the year.


Sorrowfully, yet the sweeter
Sings the brook in rippled meter
Under boughs that lithely teeter
Lorn birds, answering from the shores
Through the viny, shady-shiny
Interspaces, shot with tiny
Flying motes that fleck the winy
Wave-engraven sycamores.

Fields of ragged stubble, wrangled
With rank weeds, and shocks of tangled
Corn, with crests like rent plumes dangled
Over Harvest's battle-piain;
And the sudden whir and whistle
Of the quail that, like a missile,
Whizzes over thorn and thistle,
And, a missile, drops again.

Muffled voices, hid in thickets
Where the redbird stops to stick its
Ruddy beak betwixt the pickets
Of the truant's rustic trap;
And the sound of laughter ringing
Where, within the wild-vine swinging,
Climb Bacchante's schoolmates, flinging
Purple clusters in her lap.

Rich as wine, the sunset flashes
Round the tilted world, and dashes
Up the sloping west and splashes
Red foam over sky and sea--
Till my dream of Autumn, paling
In the splendor all-prevailing,
Like a sallow leaf goes sailing
Down the silence solemnly. 


I DREAMED that one had died in a strange place
Near no accustomed hand,
And they had nailed the boards above her face,
The peasants of that land,
Wondering to lay her in that solitude,
And raised above her mound
A cross they had made out of two bits of wood,
And planted cypress round;
And left her to the indifferent stars above
Until I carved these words:


who
can blame her for hunkering
into the doorwells at night,
the only blaze in the dark
the brush of her hopeful tail,
the only starlight
her little bared teeth?

and when she is not satisfied
who can blame her for refusing to leave,
Master Of The Hunt, why am i
not feeding, not being fed?


the coming of fox

one evening i return
to a red fox
haunched by my door.

i am afraid
although she knows
no enemy comes here.

next night again
then next then next
she sits in her safe shadow

silent as my skin bleeds
into long bright flags
of fur.


dear fox

it is not my habit
to squat in the hungry desert
fingering stones, begging them
to heal, not me but the dry morninngs
and bitter nights.
it is not your habit
to watch, none of this
is ourrs, sister fox.
tell yourself that anytime now
we will rise and walk away
from somebody else's life.
any time.


leaving fox

so many fuckless days and nights
only the solitary fox
watching my window light
barks her compassion.
i move away from her eyes.
from the pitying brush
of her tail
to a new place and check
for signs. so far
i am the only animal.
i will keep the door unlocked
until something human comes.


one year later

what if,
then,
entering my room,
brushing against the shadows,
lapping them into rust,
her soft paw extended,
she had called me out?
what if,
then,
i had reared up baying,
and followed her off
into vixen country?
what then of the moon,
the room, the bed, the poetry
of regret?


a dream of foxes

in the dream of foxes
there is a field
and a procession of women
clean as good children
no hollow in the world
surrounded by dogs
no fur clumped bloody
on the ground
only a lovely line
of honest women stepping
without fear or guilt or shame
safe through the generous fields. 

To do some little good before I die;
To wake some echoes to a loftier theme;
To spend my life's last store of industry
On thoughts less vain than Youth's discordant dream;
To endow the world's grief with some counter--scheme
Of logical hope which through all time should lighten
The burden of men's sorrow and redeem
Their faces' paleness from the tears that whiten;

To take my place in the world's brotherhood
As one prepared to suffer all its fate;
To do and be undone for sake of good,
And conquer rage by giving love for hate;
That were a noble dream, and so to cease,
Scorned by the proud but with the poor at peace. 


Lying listless in the mosses
Underneath a tree that tosses
Flakes of sunshine, and embosses
Its green shadow with the snow--
Drowsy-eyed, I sink in slumber
Born of fancies without number--
Tangled fancies that encumber
Me with dreams of long ago.

Ripples of the river singing;
And the water-lilies swinging
Bells of Parian, and ringing
Peals of perfume faint and fine,
While old forms and fairy faces
Leap from out their hiding-places
In the past, with glad embraces
Fraught with kisses sweet as wine.

Willows dip their slender fingers
O'er the little fisher's stringers,
While he baits his hook and lingers
Till the shadows gather dim;
And afar off comes a calling
Like the sounds of water falling,
With the lazy echoes drawling
Messages of haste to him.


Little naked feet that tinkle
Through the stubble-fields, and twinkle
Down the winding road, and sprinkle
Little mists of dusty rain,
While in pasture-lands the cattle
Cease their grazing with a rattle
Of the bells whose clappers tattle
To their masters down the lane.

Trees that hold their tempting treasures
O'er the orchard's hedge embrasures,
Furnish their forbidden pleasures
As in Eden lands of old;
And the coming of the master
Indicates a like disaster
To the frightened heart that faster
Beats pulsations manifold.

Puckered lips whose pipings tingle
In staccato notes that mingle
Musically with the jingle-
Haunted winds that lightly fan
Mellow twilights, crimson-tinted
By the sun, and picture-printed
Like a book that sweetly hinted
Of the Nights Arabian.


Porticoes with columns plaited
And entwined with vines and freighted
With a bloom all radiated
With the light of moon and star;
Where some tender voice is winging
In sad flights of song, and singing
To the dancing fingers flinging
Dripping from the sweet guitar.

Would my dreams were never taken
From me: that with faith unshaken
I might sleep and never waken
On a weary world of woe!
Links of love would never sever
As I dreamed them, never, never!
I would glide along forever
Through the dreams of long ago. 


I had a dream short
yester night; 
I saw in that
some thing of mine; 
my life, 
full of craze; 
those sights, 
them I gaze
were they of mine? 

A cross junction 
of love and hate; 
from there a lane
leads to resting place; 
the pavement there, 
a heap of mud near
a plant over there, 
that, my desire, 
I had planted
along with you joint

 

Underneath, 
it was dry; there
I saw your mind
unwilling to water; 
soil unsaturated
thirst not satiated, 
expectations 
high of mine 
seen crumbled 
out fallen 
the desire plant 
shedding dry leaves; 
tear drops 
water less! 


SO heavenly beautiful it lay, 
It was less like a human corse 
Than that fair shape in which perforce 
A lost hope clothes itself alway. 

The dream showed very plain: the bed 
Where that known unknown face reposed,-- 
A woman's face with eyelids closed, 
A something precious that was dead; 

A something, lost on this side life, 
By which the mourner came and stood, 
And laid down, ne'er to be indued, 
All flaunting robes of earthly strife; 

Shred off, like votive locks of hair, 
Youth's ornaments of pride and strength, 
And cast them in their golden length 
The silence of that bier to share. 

No tears fell,--but with gazings long 
Lorn memory tried to print that face 
On the heart's ever-vacant place, 
With a sun-finger, sharp and strong.-- 

Then kisses, dropping without sound, 
And solemn arms wound round the dead, 
And lifting from the natural bed 
Into the coffin's strange new bound. 

Yet still no farewell, or belief 
In death, no more than one believes 
In some dread truth that sudden weaves 
The whole world in a shroud of grief. 

And still unanswered kisses; still 
Warm clingings to the image cold 
With an incredulous faith's close fold, 
Creative in its fierce 'I will.' 

Hush,--hush! the marble eyelids move, 
The kissed lips quiver into breath: 
Avaunt, thou mockery of Death! 
Avaunt!--we are conquerors, I and Love. 

Corpse of dead Hope, awake, arise, 
A living Hope that only slept 
Until the tears thus overwept 
Had washed the blindness from our eyes. 

Come back into the upper day: 
Pluck off these cerements. Patient shroud, 
We'll wrap thee as a garment proud 
Round the fair shape we thought was clay. 

Clasp, arms; cling, soul; eyes, drink anew 
The beauty that returns with breath: 
Faith, that out-loved this trance-like death, 
May see this resurrection too. 


Bring me a quart of colonial beer 
And some doughy damper to make good cheer, 
I must make a heavy dinner; 
Heavily dine and heavily sup, 
Of indigestible things fill up, 
Next month they run the Melbourne Cup, 
And I have to dream the winner. 
Stoke it in, boys! the half-cooked ham, 
The rich ragout and the charming cham., 
I've got to mix my liquor; 
Give me a gander's gaunt hind leg, 
Hard and tough as a wooden peg, 
And I'll keep it down with a hard-boiled egg, 
'Twill make me dream the quicker. 

Now that I'm full of fearful feed, 
Oh, but I'll dream of a winner indeed 
In my restless, troubled slumber; 
While the night-mares race through my heated brain 
And their devil-riders spur amain, 
The trip for the Cup will reward my pain, 
And I'll spot the winning number. 

Thousands and thousands and thousands more, 
Like sands on the white Pacific shore, 
The crowding people cluster; 
For evermore is the story old, 
While races are bought and backers are sold, 
Drawn by the greed of the gain of gold, 
In their thousands still they muster. 

     *       *       *       *       * 

And the bookies' cries grow fierce and hot, 
'I'll lay the Cup! The double, if not! ' 
'Five monkeys, Little John, sir! ' 
'Here's fives bar one, I lay, I lay! ' 
And so they shout through the livelong day, 
And stick to the game that is sure to pay, 
While fools put money on, sir! 

And now in my dream I seem to go 
And bet with a 'book' that I seem to know -  
A Hebrew money-lender; 
A million to five is the price I get -  
Not bad! but before I book the bet 
The horse's name I clean forgret, 
Its number and even gender. 

Now for the start, and here they come, 
And the hoof-strokes roar like a mighty drum 
Beat by a hand unsteady; 
They come like a rushing, roaring flood, 
Hurrah for the speed of the Chester blood; 
For Acme is making the pace so good 
They are some of 'em done already. 

But round the track she begins to tire, 
And a mighty shout goes up 'Crossfire! ' 
The magpie jacket's leading; 
And Crossfire challenges fierce and bold, 
And the lead she'll have and the lead she'll hold, 
But at length gives way to the black and gold, 
Which right to the front is speeding. 

Carry them on and keep it up -  
A flying race is the Melbourne Cup, 
You must race and stay to win it; 
And old Commotion, Victoria's pride, 
Now takes the lead with his raking stride, 
And a mighty roar goes far and wide -  
'There's only Commotion in it! ' 

But one draws out from the beaten ruck 
And up on the rails by a piece of luck 
He comes in a style that's clever; 
'It's Trident! Trident! Hurrah for Hales! ' 
'Go at 'em now while their courage fails; ' 
'Trident! Trident! for New South Wales! ' 
'The blue and white for ever! ' 

Under the whip! with the ears flat back, 
Under the whip! though the sinews crack, 
No sign of the base white feather: 
Stick to it now for your breeding's sake, 
Stick to it now though your hearts should break, 
While the yells and roars make the grand-stand shake, 
They come down the straignt together. 

Trident slowly forges ahead, 
The fierce whips cut and the spurs are red, 
The pace is undiminished 
Now for the Panics that never fail! 
But many a backer's face grows pale 
As old Commotion swings his tail 
And swerves -  and the Cup is finished. 

     *       *       *       *       * 

And now in my dream it all comes back: 
I bet my coin on the Sydney crack, 
A million I've won, no question! 
'Give me my money, you hook-nosed hog! 
Give me my money, bookmaking dog! ' 
But he disappeared in a kind of fog, 
And I woke with 'the indigestion'. 


Last night in my dream
he was smiling at me, 
calling my name
'Sweet Rose of Tralee'.
With his ring on my finger
and church lights all aglow, 
I walked back down the aisle
as his Bride ~ long ago.
Last night in my dream
love was his song
and those beautiful 
memories live on. 

I came to her house
On Mulberry Street
Hoping just to say hello
And gaze into her eyes
Of infinite realms of tenderness.

I wanted to share
The poetry of her soul
And the rhythmic music of her body
As well as the melody of her voice.

She invited me in for tea
Where we lit candles
In the living room
And breathed in the perfume
Of a sacred incense.

Every thought consumed me
To escape reality by mingling
All of my existence into her wondrous essence, 
To exchange my individual aura
For a dream of us. 


Twenty-eight naked young women bathed by the shore
Or near the bank of a woodland lake
Twenty-eight girls and all of them comely
Worthy of Mack Sennett's camera and Florenz Ziegfield's
Foolish Follies.

They splashed and swam with the wondrous unconsciousness
Of their youth and beauty
In the full spontaneity and summer of the fieshes of
     awareness
Heightened, intensified and softened
By the soft and the silk of the waters
Blooded made ready by the energy set afire by the
     nakedness of the body,

Electrified: deified: undenied.


A young man of thirty years beholds them from a distance.
He lives in the dungeon of ten million dollars.
He is rich, handsome and empty standing behind the linen curtains
Beholding them.
Which girl does he think most desirable, most beautiful?
They are all equally beautiful and desirable from the gold distance.
For if poverty darkens discrimination and makes
perception too vivid,
The gold of wealth is also a form of blindness.
For has not a Frenchman said, Although this is America. 

What he has said is not entirely relevant,

Where is he going?
Is he going to be among them to splash and to laugh with them?
They did not see him although he saw them and was there among them.
He saw them as he would not have seen them had they been conscious
Of him or conscious of men in complete depravation:
This is his enchantment and impoverishment
As he possesses them in gaze only.



He felt the wood secrecy, he knew the June softness
The warmth surrounding him crackled
Held in by the mansard roof mansion
He glimpsed the shadowy light on last year's brittle leaves fallen,
Looked over and overlooked, glimpsed by the fall of death,
Winter's mourning and the May's renewal. 


Why go to Saint-Juliot? What's Juliot to me?
I've been but made fancy
By some necromancy
That much of my life claims the spot as its key.


Yes. I have had dreams of that place in the West,
And a maiden abiding
Thereat as in hiding;
Fair-eyed and white-shouldered, broad-browed and brown-tressed.


And of how, coastward bound on a night long ago,
There lonely I found her,
The sea-birds around her,
And other than nigh things uncaring to know.


So sweet her life there (in my thought has it seemed)
That quickly she drew me
To take her unto me,
And lodge her long years with me. Such have I dreamed.


But nought of that maid from Saint-Juliot I see;
Can she ever have been here,
And shed her life's sheen here,
The woman I thought a long housemate with me?


Does there even a place like Saint-Juliot exist?
Or a Vallency Valley
With stream and leafed alley,
Or Beeny, or Bos with its flounce flinging mist


I don't know
if it was my dream or reality? 

that all the men were seen
with long tails
big ears
and horny heads 
stepping on four legs
grazing.  few
roaming. . few        
and fighting.  more
some where in a jungle of 
leafles trees 

while in the mean time 
the animals of different kind
who were found
not talking to each other only
but also were walking
unexpectedly on two
with some critical 
smiles ofamazing success
and were forwarding hand to hand
towards the empty cities
to occupy.


Was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway; 
And to the forest edge you came one day 
(This was my dream) and looked and pondered long, 
But did not enter, though the wish was strong:
You shook your pensive head as who should say, 
‘I dare not—too far in his footsteps stray— 
He must seek me would he undo the wrong. 

Not far, but near, I stood and saw it all 
Behind low boughs the trees let down outside;
And the sweet pang it cost me not to call 
And tell you that I saw does still abide. 
But ’tis not true that thus I dwelt aloof, 
For the wood wakes, and you are here for proof. 


With moon-white hearts that held a gleam
I gathered wild-flowers in a dream,
And shaped a woman, whose sweet blood
Was odour of the wildwood bud.

From dew, the starlight arrowed through,
I wrought a woman's eyes of blue;
The lids that on her eyeballs lay,
Were rose-pale petals of the May.

Out of a rosebud's veins I drew
The flagrant crimson beating through
The languid lips of her, whose kiss
Was as a poppy's drowsiness.

Out of the moonlight and the air
I wrought the glory of her hair,
That o'er her eyes' blue heaven lay
Like some gold cloud o'er dawn of day.

I took the music of the breeze
And water, whispering in the trees,
And shaped the soul that breathed below
A woman's blossom breasts of snow.


A shadow's shadow in the glass
Of sleep, my spirit saw her pass:
And thinking of it now, meseems
We only live within our dreams.

For in that time she was to me
More real than our reality;
More real than Earth, more real than I
The unreal things that pass and die. 


Just yesterday morning, it was no item
 between heart and dripping eyes,
 to understand slowly confusion, entire world 
 is running by. In the darkness crossing a big city, where
 single step will going ahead,
 It was the sin of our frustrations, inviting
 a self image with each temptation.
 Don't know where to go just going true
 Trying to found a place, that fill me up with peace.
 Just before sunshine brightup with heat
 A beautiful scenic view it was a point. that
 it wasn't in my mind, will sharp noises of the water
 and deep blue from the ocean, with horizon of skylight. 
 like sweet singing behind waves and rocks!



 No,
 it wasn't a rock, or a wave, it was a image
 walking over those waves. with a mixture for
 automatic description brighten up my mind,
 an old writers must to follow.
 it was short but clear and pure
 every word for understanding.
 like portions of small water falls,
 Never before in peaceful run my mind,
 when trying to clean my dripping eyes,
 may the emotion, or the difference pure voice cure my peace.
 Saying who you thank will be sad for you?
 I know it all and stop your crying. 
 Will bright sunshine come out from behind
 to make me blind instants and like the course
 of small creak the pure voice slowly was going away.
 Saying step step follow my foot prints. 


Take this kiss upon the brow! 
          And, in parting from you now,
          Thus much let me avow-
          And, in parting from you now,
          Thus much let me avow-
          You are not wrong, who deem
          That my days have been a dream; 
          Yet if hope has flown away
          In a night, or in a day,
          In a vision, or in none,
          Is it therefore the less gone? 
          All that we see or seem
          Is but a dream within a dream.

          I stand amid the roar
          Of a surf-tormented shore,
          And I hold within my hand
          Grains of the golden sand-
          How few! yet how they creep
          Through my fingers to the deep,
          While I weep- while I weep! 
          Them with a tighter clasp? 
          One from the pitiless wave? 
          Is all that we see or seem
          But a dream within a dream


As the Night begins to slumber, 
And most dreams start to awake, 
I do softly sigh and wonder, 
If true love is really great.

I have dreamt of your sweet coming, 
Of us drifting in Love's Lake, 
Like two Swan's in love's pure splendor, 
But you're gone when I awake. 


I am not a dreamer, but                                                She is a dreamer                                                         A different dreamer,                                                     My world is different                                                       From her world,                                                           I went so far to fulfill                                                Her dream which we shared together,                                            But I discovered that the dream she                                         Is looking for is different                                                From what we shared together,                                            I got sad and of course                                                   I was all right,                                                        We shared a pretty dream, but                                            All was in vain,                                                         A dream lost and a dreamer lost                                       Only a bitter memory was remembered,                                               It's unfair to lose a pretty dream                                        For a wrong wish's sake,                                                     A dreamer is not a precious person now, but                               A loser and an absurd loser,                                                                          Now I am looking for a new dream                                        Because I am a pretty dreamer                                                 Of a pretty dream in a pretty dreamy world. 



He lived beyond men, and so stood
Admitted to the brotherhood
Of beauty:-dreams, with which he trod
Companioned like some sylvan god.
And oft men wondered, when his thought
Made all their knowledge seem as naught,
If he, like Uther's mystic son,
Had not been born for Avalon.

When wandering mid the whispering trees,
His soul communed with every breeze;
Heard voices calling from the glades,
Bloom-words of the Leimoniaeds;
Or Dryads of the ash and oak,
Who syllabled his name and spoke
With him of presences and powers
That glimpsed in sunbeams, gloomed in showers.


By every violet-hallowed brook,
Where every bramble-matted nook
Rippled and laughed with water sounds,
He walked like one on sainted grounds,
Fearing intrusion on the spell
That kept some fountain-spirit's well,
Or woodland genius, sitting where
Red, racy berries kissed his hair.

Once when the wind, far o'er the hill,
Had fall'n and left the wildwood still
For Dawn's dim feet to trail across,-
Beneath the gnarled boughs, on the moss,
The air around him golden-ripe
With daybreak,-there, with oaten pipe,
His eyes beheld the wood-god, Pan,
Goat-bearded, horned; half brute, half man;
Who, shaggy-haunched, a savage rhyme
Blew in his reed to rudest time;
And swollen-jowled, with rolling eye-
Beneath the slowly silvering sky,
Whose rose streaked through the forest's roof-
Danced, while beneath his boisterous hoof
The branch was snapped, and, interfused
Between gnarled roots, the moss was bruised.

And often when he wandered through
Old forests at the fall of dew-
A new Endymion, who sought
A beauty higher than all thought-
Some night, men said, most surely he
Would favored be of deity:
That in the holy solitude
Her sudden presence, long-pursued,
Unto his gaze would stand confessed:
The awful moonlight of her breast
Come, high with majesty, and hold
His heart's blood till his heart grew cold,
Unpulsed, unsinewed, all undone,
And snatch his soul to Avalon. 


I still find comfort
In the soft caress
Of the moonlight’s
Tender glow
And hear your voice
Crystal clear
Drifting gently
Through a seductive breeze.

And I still feel
Your lips upon my neck, 
How you would even kiss
The beads of my rosary
In a resplendent prayer
For our eternity
In a dreamscape of love.

Some days and events
Never end
But carry us through
This life
That often feels
Like a city besieged 
By dog armies
Of the insensitive and cruel.


And I’ll never forget
When your body was a part of mine. 

With glass, I am a man – or so I think! –
A role to play when blessed with courtly drink: 
A gin or two, then vintage port or wine
To pep me up and gift me with a shine.

I know it’s false, as I now must depend
Upon my daily shots with open end.
Insidious, it all becomes routine
To beg a drink each day for self-esteem.





Life life life life life life is drink
Life life life life life life the brink
Life life life life life life is drink
Life life life life life life the brink
Life life life life life life is drink
Life life life life life life the brink
Life life life life is on the brink


There is something about a Martini,
A tingle remarkably pleasant;
A yellow, a mellow Martini;
I wish I had one at present.
There is something about a Martini,
Ere the dining and dancing begin,
And to tell you the truth,
It is not the vermouth--
I think that perhaps it's the gin. 


Make a wish
While you drink like a fish
Maybe the lady in red
Will descend on your lips with a kiss
Before the bouncer throws you out
Of the club in one piece

And love comes in at the eye;
That's all we shall know for truth
Before we grow old and die.
I lift the glass to my mouth,
I look at you, and I sigh. 

A drop fell on the apple tree
Another on the roof;
A half a dozen kissed the eaves,
And made the gables laugh.

A few went out to help the brook,
That went to help the sea.
Myself conjectured, Were they pearls,
What necklaces could be!

The dust replaced in hoisted roa
The birds jocoser sung;
The sunshine threw his hat away,
The orchards spangles hung.

The breezes brought dejected
And bathed them in the glee;
The East put out a single flag,


a hard rain
dropped last night
minutes to hours
so cold so scary

a reservoir
laid above us
from nineteen thirties
so vast so majestic


O pondering rainy night! 
you said hello passionately to us
were you missing your friends here? 
we felt that you are a refreshing gift

O great Situ Gintung Reservoir! 
you watered tenderly our environment
were you loving your friends from up there? 
we felt exactly that you are a relieving present

very long rain and old water resistant
around two until five after midnight
Situ Gintung's badly broken apart
huge water came down very fast

smashed homes, trees, and stuffs
crashed people, old and young
took our all life, rich and poor
separated from beloved ones

we cry for you, sisters
we pray for you, brothers
if a sad thing should happen
it must be happened, my friend

we weep deeply
we scream to the sky
why it must be done to you? 
human and nature mourn to you


it reminds us
Flood of Noah
it reminds us
Tsunami of Aceh

it reminds us
to rethink what we've done
it reminds us 
to reconsider what we've walked in

Your Love is bigger than Your Anger
Your Will has happened in that pathetic morning

Your Grace is greater than Your Punishment 
Your Care is upon us, upon our sons and our daughters

Please, be pity on us, on your weakest creatures
Please, give mercy upon us, upon our fragile hearts, spirits, and souls



From the grief ocean, I steal, a drop of happiness, 
For every autumn, I get a lovely beautiful spring, 
For human youth; the festive, to dance and sing, 
We nature, within nature; keepeth blissful fitness, 

When spring comes, nature with its beauty; greet, 
Flower with hue sways and butterflies do flip flop, 
Calm breeze's sensational blush; a birth of hope, 
Seasons love, mingles with whole color, they meet.

Know, a place in mind, away from the physical spring, 
Hatching spring and brooding youth forever, a bliss, 
Grief of the world; dry petals, away from hate, I kiss, 
From the grief ocean, a drop of happiness, they bring.

There will not be a spring without autumn; no taste, 
If no sorrow, what taste happiness will provide, say? 
If no youth, why then heart will throb; gaily and gay? 
Autumn prepares to decorate the heart with haste.. 


IT'S THE SYMBOL                                                         OF LIFE.                                                                WHEN WE MISS IT                                                          WE LOSE,                                                               WE GET THIRSTY AND                                                       WE FEEL SAD.                                                            THOUGH VERY SMALL,                                                       BUT IT'S LOVELY AND                                                       BLESSED.                                                                WE LOOK FOR IT                                                            WHEN WE NEED IT.                                                       IT'S MUCH MORE PRECIOUS                                                  THAN THE PURE GOLD ITSELF.                                              IT'S THE DROP OF                                                         WATER. 


The world is mostly water, but                                         Do each of us get a drop of water                                       In a glass of water anytime and anywhere?                               We're thirsty because we can not get                                     Just a drop of water in a glass of water!                               Some people have a lot of pure water in                                    Pretty tanks and in pretty bottles of water and                           There are some people who die because they're thirsty                             And they can not get even a drop of water!                                       It's a shame upon the whole world because some                            They get the best water and some die because of                               Lack of water anytime, anywhere, and everywhere!                               Where is the water we want? Where is the H?                                Life is useless with water!

A drop plus another drop equal two pretty drops and so on, but            Where are the other pretty drops that heaven drop to us!                       Life is going to die if we don't take care of our water on the           Surface of our pretty earth and everything around us!                   We will die if we don't keep our water well because of a lot of            Troubles arising from our mistakes and global warming

A water bead on lotus leaf -
Shimmering  with  a glow 
But up to that time only 
As long is on the leaf.

With a little jerk or a shake    
It rolls down  and ends.

This life is like that only
As a drop on a lotus leaf
Priceless is our human life
But very mortal and short lived.

With a little quiver or a tweak 
It shatters and then breaks.
Very short lived and uncertain
Like the dew on the grass tips. 

To extract the beauty of life 
So long you are alive -

Love all with love and  peace - 
Love flower bird and child.
Spread out the treasure of love
To the saints, demons  and the beasts.
 
Enjoy the life without  harming others
Live and let live with peace, 
Who knows when the heart  will stop  
Even when you're at your height of success! 

Life is like  water drops 
Wobbling   on  lotus leaf.
Short lived and uncertain
Like the dew on the grass tips. 


came with tears in eyes
white tears as snow
o baby i said
what's the matter
she never replied
but then stood, sat
and did lie
it's my eyes
burn with pain
she sighed
o my lover
only a look i passed
and only a drop
touched her eyes
removing all the burn
and the pain as well
and this is the why
because the darling
was a paper
and that drop
was a drop
of poetry. 


To Meath of the pastures, 
From wet hills by the sea, 
Through Leitrim and Longford 
Go my cattle and me. 
I hear in the darkness 
Their slipping and breathing. 
I name them the bye-ways 
They’re to pass without heeding. 
Then the wet, winding roads, 
Brown bogs with black water; 
And my thoughts on white ships 
And the King o’ Spain’s daughter. 
O! farmer, strong farmer! 
You can spend at the fair 
But your face you must turn 
To your crops and your care. 
And soldiers—red soldiers! 
You’ve seen many lands; 
But you walk two by two, 
And by captain’s commands. 
O! the smell of the beasts, 
The wet wind in the morn; 
And the proud and hard earth 
Never broken for corn; 
And the crowds at the fair, 
The herds loosened and blind, 
Loud words and dark faces 
And the wild blood behind. 
(O! strong men with your best 
I would strive breast to breast 
I could quiet your herds 
With my words, with my words.) 
I will bring you, my kine, 
Where there’s grass to the knee; 
But you’ll think of scant croppings 
Harsh with salt of the sea. 

Mellow meadows, shimmering in summers heat, 
dipping down the valley, 
rolling down the steep
hillside. 
What a delightful and pleasurable treat, 
to sit and ponder, 
and wander, 
your feet deep amongst the wild flowers, 
where drones the sweet bees, 
collecting nectar, an endless toil, 
as they leap from bloom to bloom.  
Then with collecting complete
return home, 
bodies heavy but content.  
And eyes sweep the distant scene, 
through a haze of wheat.
A drowsy afternoon, 
renewing memories to keep, 
and maybe too, 
some fresh memories to greet.

as her single mother
tries to open her eyes

A drug infested mind
not allowing her to hear
her baby cry

She keeps telling everyone
everything is fine
so she can keep
living the lie
and living the life

Until she opens her eyes
a lonely baby still cries


All wars start with                                                      A war drum and a war drummer.                                             The pretty beating of a drummer                                            Shows clearly his good drum.                                              There are a lot of pretty drums                                            And they need pretty drummers.                                             A known war has a starting drum and                                        A nice drummer.                                                           Wars are ugly and their drums are                                          Uglier, but their drummers are the ugliest.                               Our world is a place for some wars                                          Here and there.                                                         Undoubtedly war drummers play a great                                    Role in staging an ugly war.                                              In reality the war drum is the                                             Tool of war.                                                               Wars are sometimes justified greatly                                            By their tools and reasons.                                               Wars are ugly and horrible.                                            A drum and a drummer are needed                                                For any ugly wars.                                                      The pretty beating on a drum by                                           A distinguished drummer makes                                            A big difference. 


O' dear my beloved - 
I ‘m totally wet and drowning in your love
Floating like a swan in a lake 
Being filled with honey, being matured 
From your desire lust and love.
Let me drink your offerings of love 
Oozing from your desires, body and mind
Let me get drunk with it 
And get sunken in your illustrious beauty throughout. 

Let that addiction and tipsiness of being 
Clinging and stuck to your body -
Persist in me for ever and ever as long as I breathe
People may judge me as a tattered 
And a shoddy drunkard on the  road side
But let me be content and continue 
In dreaming you day and night.


Let me be a drunkard and be sunken 
In the liquor, made out of your love 
Let me have that joy divine 
With your smile and those mesmerizing look
From those  sparkling eyes.

For ever and ever I'd prefer	
To be sunken in your love 
I desire to remain as a tippler or boozer
Drinking the juices of your love. 
Love to see you as  a dove divine
Sitting on my shoulder -
Cooing to spread the love benign.

Let me forget all my pains and strife 
By being dipped into your addictive love you offered! 


O' dear my beloved - 
I ‘m totally wet and drowning in your love
- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And keep me dancing still
That I may stay a sober man
Although I drink my fill.


Sobriety is a jewel
That I do much adore;
And therefore keep me dancing
Though drunkards lie and snore.
O mind your feet, O mind your feet,
Keep dancing like a wave,
And under every dancer
A dead man in his grave.
No ups and downs, my pretty,
A mermaid, not a punk;
A drunkard is a dead man,
And all dead men are drunk. 


Leaves are like ideas in the mind
They come when needed
They flourish and give life
Light and great wisdom

When ideas have served their purpose
They need to be swept away
We must constantly sweep out the old
And give way for the new one


Man breathes for life
As he reaches
His old age
It will cease

And will fall apart
Like a dry leaf


A Scabbard-fish trying to catch 
The common snipe bird as such! 

An inefficient fellow born in a family rich 
Unable to manage and maintain the properties! 

A person who, learned with books and education, 
Have fears to speak and discuss in a learned audience! 

Are considered to be like a dumb person having a dream! 
He could not explain and express what he had dreamt


Simon Danz has come home again,
From cruising about with his buccaneers;
He has singed the beard of the King of Spain,
And carried away the Dean of Jaen
And sold him in Algiers. 

In his house by the Maese, with its roof of tiles,
And weathercocks flying aloft in air,
There are silver tankards of antique styles,
Plunder of convent and castle, and piles
Of carpets rich and rare. 

In his tulip-garden there by the town,
Overlooking the sluggish stream,
With his Moorish cap and dressing-gown,
The old sea-captain, hale and brown,
Walks in a waking dream. 

A smile in his gray mustachio lurks
Whenever he thinks of the King of Spain,
And the listed tulips look like Turks,
And the silent gardener as he works
Is changed to the Dean of Jaen. 

The windmills on the outermost
Verge of the landscape in the haze,
To him are towers on the Spanish coast,
With whiskered sentinels at their post,
Though this is the river Maese. 

But when the winter rains begin,
He sits and smokes by the blazing brands,
And old seafaring men come in,
Goat-bearded, gray, and with double chin, 
And rings upon their hands. 

They sit there in the shadow and shine
Of the flickering fire of the winter night;
Figures in color and design
Like those by Rembrandt of the Rhine,
Half darkness and half light. 

And they talk of ventures lost or won,
And their talk is ever and ever the same,
While they drink the red wine of Tarragon,
From the cellars of some Spanish Don,
Or convent set on flame. 

Restless at times with heavy strides
He paces his parlor to and fro;
He is like a ship that at anchor rides,
And swings with the rising and falling tides,
And tugs at her anchor-tow. 

Voices mysterious far and near,
Sound of the wind and sound of the sea,
Are calling and whispering in his ear,
'Simon Danz! Why stayest thou here?
Come forth and follow me!' 

So he thinks he shall take to the sea again
For one more cruise with his buccaneers,
To singe the beard of the King of Spain,
And capture another Dean of Jaen
And sell him in Algiers. 


Fire, Water, Woman, are Man's Ruin;
Says wise Professor Vander Bruin.
By Flames a House I hir'd was lost
Last Year: and I must pay the Cost.
This Spring the Rains o'erflow'd my Ground:
And my best Flanders Mare was drown'd.
A Slave I am to Clara's Eyes:
The Gipsey knows her Pow'r, and flies.
Fire, Water, Woman, are My Ruin:
And great Thy Wisdom, Vander Bruin. 


Do you recall how I was once your fire –? 
And we, a regal cloud of unity
Meandering through the closing blues of night, 
Commanding stars to glitter; 
Dawn to blush?  

Your answer comes in ever-blanking stares: 
A wall that blocks the know, 
Damping down the glow that used to emanate
From clear and lucid eyes.
They've lost the will to recognise.

But hear! We are fifty years together –
And once we writhed in pleasure – 
Drowning in emotion, 
That which was our prime.

You don't recall. 
You only lie as vegetation
Scattered on the ground:  
A living mound of flesh, 
Devoid of any neural mesh
To let you say 'I'm sound.'

Don't worry Dear, 
For I'm aware with memory! 
I'll tell you how we were.
We have our right of history! 

If you could just concur.




Please remember, remember me, remember, remember me, remember  
Please remember, remember me, remember, remember me, remember  
Please remember, remember me, remember, remember me, remember
Please remember, remember me, remember, remember me, remember
Please remember, remember me, remember, remember me, remember  
Please remember, remember me, remember, remember me, remember
Please remember, remember me, remember, remember me
Please remember, remember me, remember, remember 
Please remember, remember me, remember
Please remember, remember me
Please remember, remember  
Please remember
Please


Your face had only the 
eyes, when you flew backwards, 
hovering like a humming bird.

There was no absolute, 
hoisting the beheaded god.
In transience I will meet you 
in air and shed the body.

In mouth-hole you put 
all your wisdom, to bisect the 
virgin house. Violence creeps into 
the  roses. They droop and bleed.

I will talk to burgundy-black 
moon, not to leave footprints on 
my face. My lips are going to 
catch the stolen kisses. 


In bed of illness
Fed 
On the remnants 
Of hope

Hearing the footsteps
Coming close
Tiptoeing 
On the slender rope
Of breaths

Awake, asleep
Between 
The blankness
Of 
A blurred consciousness

Aching bones
On a well-stuffed
Mattress, warm
From long hours
Of sleep

The dimming light
Of heart
A glare
On burning pupils.



A Dying Tiger—moaned for Drink—
I hunted all the Sand—
I caught the Dripping of a Rock
And bore it in my Hand—

His Mighty Balls—in death were thick—
But searching—I could see
A Vision on the Retina
Of Water—and of me—


'Twas not my blame—who sped too slow—
'Twas not his blame—who died
While I was reaching him—
But 'twas—the fact that He was dead—~


How do you love a EMO girl

Do you leave little love letters
for her to find as you go out
the door to start your 
journey of the day? 
Do you tell her how wonderful
she is no matter the angry
words she has to say? 
Do you fight to take her
razors and hide them away? 
Do you kneel down in the
blood at her feet cry never
to give in to that horrible
cold dark defeat? 
~*How do you love a EMO girl*~
With my heart and soul
Would these unselfish
acts be enough
Or will unconditional love
be the right stuff


Above the clouds there is a star
A star that looks down on me
A star that I makes my wishes shine
A star that brightens my path
A star that enlightens my world
A star that makes me feel loved
A star that makes me dreams come true
A star that breaks my loneliness
A star that makes me smile
A star that I up to and not down on
A star that protects me from my enemies
A star that brings my bliss and hope
A star that sticks to its promises
A star that supports me take me as I am
A star that never fades away. 
A star that will live with me forever and ever


A few fine lines, at random drawn,
Like the shell-pattern wrought in lawn
To hasty glance will seem.
My trivial faults base slander's slime
Distorted into foulest crime,
And men me worthless deem.

A few small points, pricked down on wood,
May be made out a picture good
Of the bright Southern Sieve.
Who planned, and helped those slanderers vile,
My name with base lies to defile?
Unpitied, here I grieve.

With babbling tongues you go about,
And only scheme how to make out
The lies you scatter round.
Hear me--Be careful what you say;
People ere long your words will weigh,
And liars you'll be found.

Clever you are with changeful schemes!
How else could all your evil dreams
And slanders work their way?
Men now believe you; by and by,
The truth found out, each vicious lie
Will ill for ill repay.


The proud rejoice; the sufferer weeps.
O azure Heaven, from out thy deeps
Why look in silence down?
With pity on the sufferers look,
And on the evil frown.

Those slanderers I would gladly take,
With all who help their schemes to make,
And to the tigers throw.
If wolves and tigers such should spare,
Td hurl them 'midst the freezing air,
Where the keen north winds blow.
And should the North compassion feel
I'd fling them to great Heaven, to deal
On them its direst woe.

As on the sacred heights you dwell,
My place is in the willow dell,
One is the other near.
Before you, officers, I spread
These lines by me, poor eunuch, made.
Think not Mang-tsze severe. 

That night our anger and pain 
took the shape of a rain
poured down - lashing slaps 
in the face of blooming daisies
plashing water's smooth surface
of puddles oiled by yellow moon
In the morning I felt.  ashamed
looking at the soaked faces 
of the beaten tender daisies. 


Securely sunning in a forest glade, 
A mild, well-meaning snake
Approved the adaptations he had made
For safety’s sake.

He liked the skin he had—
Its mottled camouflage, its look of mail,
And was content that he had thought to add
A rattling tail.


The tail was not for drumming up a fight;
No, nothing of the sort.
And he would only use his poisoned bite
As last resort.


A peasant now drew near,
Collecting wood; the snake, observing this,
Expressed concern by uttering a clear
But civil hiss.


The simple churl, his nerves at once unstrung, 
Mistook the other’s tone
And dashed his brains out with a deftly-flung
Pre-emptive stone.


Moral

Security, alas, can give
A threatening impression;
Too much defense-initiative
Can prompt aggression. 

Two fellers, Isrel named and Joe,
One Sundy mornin' 'greed to go
Agunnin' soon 'z the bells wuz done
And meetin' finally begun,
So'st no one wouldn't be about
Ther Sabbath-breakin' to spy out.


Joe didn't want to go a mite;
He felt ez though 'twarn't skeercely right,
But, when his doubts he went to speak on,
Isrel he up and called him Deacon,
An' kep' apokin' fun like sin
An' then arubbin' on it in,
Till Joe, less skeered o' doin' wrong
Than bein' laughed at, went along.

Past noontime they went trampin' round
An' nary thing to pop at found,
Till, fairly tired o' their spree,
They leaned their guns agin a tree,
An' jest ez they wuz settin' down
To take their noonin', Joe looked roun'
And see (acrost lots in a pond
That warn't mor'n twenty rod beyond)
A goose that on the water sot
Ez ef awaitin' to be shot.





Two women with
the same claim
came to the feet of
the wise king. Two women,
but only one baby.
The king knew
someone was lying.
What he said was
Let the child be
cut in half; that way
no one will go
empty-handed. He
drew his sword.
Then, of the two
women, one
renounced her share:
this was
the sign, the lesson.
Suppose
you saw your mother
torn between two daughters:
what could you do
to save her but be
willing to destroy
yourself—she would know
who was the rightful child,
the one who couldn't bear
to divide the mother. 


Some cawing Crows, a hooting Owl,
A Hawk, a Canary, an old Marsh-Fowl,
One day all meet together
To hold a caucus and settle the fate
Of a certain bird (without a mate),
A bird of another feather.
'My friends,' said the Owl, with a look most wise,
'The Eagle is soaring too near the skies,
In a way that is quite improper;
Yet the world is praising her, so I'm told,
And I think her actions have grown so bold
That some of us ought to stop her.'
'I have heard it said,' quoth Hawk, with a sigh,
'That young lambs died at the glance of her eye,
And I wholly scorn and despise her.
This, and more, I am told they say,
And I think that the only proper way
Is never to recognize her.'
'I am quite convinced,' said Crow, with a caw,
'That the Eagle minds no moral law,
She's a most unruly creature.'
'She's an ugly thing,' piped Canary Bird;
'Some call her handsome—it's so absurd—
She hasn't a decent feature.'
Then the old Marsh-Hen went hopping about,
She said she was sure—she hadn't a doubt—
Of the truth of each bird's story:
And she thought it a duty to stop her flight,
To pull her down from her lofty height,
And take the gilt from her glory.
But, lo! from a peak on the mountain grand
That looks out over the smiling land
And over the mighty ocean,
The Eagle is spreading her splendid wings—
She rises, rises, and upward swings,
With a slow, majestic motion.
With a cry of rapture, away she flies,
Close to the Great Eternal:
She sweeps the world with her piercing sight;
Her soul is filled with the infinite
And the joy of things supernal.
The genius-crowned or the power-shod,
Over the dust-world sailing;
And back, like splinters blown by the winds,
Must fall the missiles of silly minds,
Useless and unavailing. 


There once was a dog 
Who was friends with a hog. 
They sat around on a log 
Drinking beer and grog, 
With never a care 
Of how they might fare. 
I happened along 
Took them both home, 
To people this poem, 
Said it wouldn’t take long. 
Dined them on caviar and champagne, 
Then brought them back again. 
Now the hog plays the flute; 
The dog talks of Beirut- 
And they curtsy and bow 
Dog never says, bow-wow- 
Now that my assets are sunk in them, 
I think I’d prefer them both drunk again. 


A raven, while with glossy breast
Her new-laid eggs she fondly press'd,
And, on her wicker-work high mounted,
Her chickens prematurely counted
(A fault philosophers might blame,
If quite exempted from the same),
Enjoy'd at ease the genial day;
'Twas April, as the bumpkins say,
The legislature call'd it May.
But suddenly a wind, as high
As ever swept a winter sky,
Shook the young leaves about her ears,
And fill'd her with a thousand fears,
Lest the rude blast should snap the bough,
And spread her golden hopes below.
But just at eve the blowing weather
And all her fears were hush'd together:
And now, quoth poor unthinking Ralph.
'Tis over, and the brood is safe;
(For ravens, though, as birds of omen,
They teach both conjurors and old women
To tell us what is to befall,
Can’t prophesy themselves at all.)
The morning came, when neighbour Hodge,
Who long had mark'd her airy lodge,
And destined all the treasure there
A gift to his expecting fair,
Climb’d like a squirrel to his dray,
And bore the worthless prize away.


Moral:
'Tis Providence alone secures
In every change both mine and yours:
Safety consists not in escape
From dangers of a frightful shape;
An earthquake may be bid to spare
The man that’s strangled by a hair.
Fate steals along with silent tread,
Found oft’nest in what least we dread,
Frowns in the storm with angry brow,
But in the sunshine strikes the blow. 


SILENT and sunny was the way 
Where Youth and I danced on together: 
So winding and embowered o'er, 
We could not see one rood before. 
Nevertheless all merrily 
We bounded onward, Youth and I, 
Leashed closely in a silken tether: 
(Well-a-day, well-a-day!) 
Ah Youth, ah Youth, but I would fain 
See thy sweet foolish face again! 

It came to pass, one morn of May, 
All in a swoon of golden weather, 
That I through green leaves fluttering 
Saw Joy uprise on Psyche wing: 
Eagerly, too eagerly 
We followed after,--Youth and I,-- 
Till suddenly he slipped the tether: 
(Well-a-day, well-a-day!) 
'Where art thou, Youth?' I cried. In vain; 
He never more came back again. 


Yet onward through the devious way 
In rain or shine, I recked not whether, 
Like many other maddened boy 
I tracked my Psyche-winged Joy; 
Till, curving round the bowery lane, 
Lo,--in the pathway stood pale Pain, 
And we met face to face together: 
(Well-a-day, well-a-day!) 
'Whence comest thou?'--and I writhed in vain-- 
'Unloose thy cruel grasp, O Pain!' 

But he would not. Since, day by day 
He has ta'en up Youth's silken tether 
And changed it into iron bands. 
So through rich vales and barren lands 
Solemnly, all solemnly, 
March we united, he and I; 
And we have grown such friends together 
(Well-a-day, well-a-day!) 
I and this my brother Pain, 
I think we'll never part again. 


If one could have that little head of hers
Painted upon a background of pure gold,
Such as the Tuscan's early art prefers!
No shade encroaching on the matchless mould
Of those two lips, which should be opening soft
In the pure profile; not as when she laughs,
For that spoils all: but rather as if aloft
Yon hyacinth, she loves so, leaned its staff's
Burden of honey-colored buds to kiss
And capture 'twixt the lips apart for this.
Then her little neck, three fingers might surround,
How it should waver on the pale gold ground
Up to the fruit-shaped, perfect chin it lifts!
I know, Correggio loves to mass, in rifts
Of heaven, his angel faces, orb on orb
Breaking its outline, burning shades absorb:
But these are only massed there, I should think,
Waiting to see some wonder momently
Grow out, stand full, fade slow against the sky
(That's the pale ground you'd see this sweet face by),
All heaven, meanwhile, condensed into one eye
Which fears to lose the wonder, should it wink. 


Photographs a glimmer
Faces shinning all a shimmer.
Perfect are those faces
Remembering all the good places.
Appearance is not all, 
We all have one downfall.

Sitting here on my bed
Feeling the pounding of my aching head.
Framed memories provoke tears
But they aren’t from my fears.
Medals hang from strings
Telling a story, while a melody sings.

Such a safe haven this seems
Everyone so happy and keen.
To school I go, perfect and fine
That dance, that night was fun and kind.
But I knew that he who was mine
Such a relationship entwined.

But it was no more-
It hit me straight at the core.
All happiness was drained
Nothing left but hurt and pain.
Smiles now hide, the sorrow
Maybe real happiness will come tomorrow.

Friends now help me stand
And if they didn’t I’d be damned.
Music soothes my soul
Like warmth coming from hot coals.
When I see him I cry
But I should hold it back I try.


There is nothing I can do
All I have now are memories of you.
Many words I had are lost
This is at my cost.
I left them unspoken
When they should of shinned like a token.

The photographs depict a serene place
But the issue was not of this case.
Memories in mind, all aglow 
Here I go with the wavering flow.
Looking into the mirror, all clear
I see a person, brave mastering all fear.

Such a fake image of myself
I’m nowhere near to that ballerina on the shelf.
Sitting back on my bed
My memories just flashed through my aching head.
Faces all alight
My FRI
S smiles will always dim this dark and scary night.


A face looks so carnivorous
From the nostrils down: 
An open, ravenous trap, 
Half full or half empty
Gleaming with ivory shears
And threatened sharpness
Of incisors clicking.

I fear it's raging hungers, this face; 
It looks ghastly unkind
With tearing, strong molars, 
An impertinent softness of tongue lurking
Concealing the violence till the last instant
While delicately testing 
The perfect temperature of warm blood.

Who says humans
Don't eat their young; 
Things sometimes happen in the dark, 
Late of night, things you'd never catch in daylight-
Why do some never have children at all; 
Perhaps they became too fond of newborn flesh, 
Delicate as the palest veal-calf of the restaurant.


And it only looks human
When you add in some eyes. 

Smile with me, 
Don’t shed a tear, 
My pain is enough, 
Your agony, 
I can’t bear.
It is I, who is going away, 
Dying isn’t fascinating, 
With you by my side, 
I can say.
Please, please let me die alone, 
So that I can at least
Shriek with pain and moan.
When you sit by my side, 
I forget my pain, 
I just hang in dark abyss
Of moss green eyes, your eyes.
To look at you is unbearable, 
‘Cause it’s I who is deserting you.
I am not doing it by will
It’s my fate’s turn, they say
You go to church to avert it
And in there you cry and 
Pray, pray, pray.
The world says
I am leaving you a legacy, 
What they don’t see 
Is you suffer, 
Suffer at the thought that I am dying
I want to tell you, 
Don’t fret
I will always need you
Whether I live or die.
I will be watching, 
I will be waiting, 
Just to see you are all right, 
I promise you this, 
Either in life or in death


THE Danish Conqueror, on his royal chair,
Mustering a face of haughty sovereignty,
To aid a covert purpose, cried--'O ye
Approaching Waters of the deep, that share
With this green isle my fortunes, come not where
Your Master's throne is set.'--Deaf was the Sea;
Her waves rolled on, respecting his decree
Less than they heed a breath of wanton air.
--Then Canute, rising from the invaded throne,
Said to his servile Courtiers,--'Poor the reach, 
The undisguised extent, of mortal sway!
He only is a King, and he alone
Deserves the name (this truth the billows preach)
Whose everlasting laws, sea, earth, and heaven, obey.'
This just reproof the prosperous Dane
Drew, from the influx of the main,
For some whose rugged northern mouths would strain
At oriental flattery;
And Canute (fact more worthy to be known)
From that time forth did for his brows disown 
The ostentatious symbol of a crown;
Esteeming earthly royalty
Contemptible as vain.
Now hear what one of elder days,
Rich theme of England's fondest praise,
Her darling Alfred, 'might' have spoken;
To cheer the remnant of his host
When he was driven from coast to coast,
Distressed and harassed, but with mind unbroken:
'My faithful followers, lo! the tide is spent 
That rose, and steadily advanced to fill
The shores and channels, working Nature's will
Among the mazy streams that backward went,
And in the sluggish pools where ships are pent:
And now, his task performed, the flood stands still,
At the green base of many an inland hill,
In placid beauty and sublime content!
Such the repose that sage and hero find;
Such measured rest the sedulous and good
Of humbler name; whose souls do, like the flood 
Of Ocean, press right on; or gently wind,
Neither to be diverted nor withstood,
Until they reach the bounds by Heaven assigned.


'A faded picture
Full of hope
With mother and child
Ahead the unfurled road
Lays crumbled now
In some forgotten drawer 

Memories held 
In black and white
Faded with each 
Passing night
Were only relived
When they temporarily 
Came to light

The mother's grave now
Overgrown with tears
The child's face now
Overgrown with years
And the faded picture 
Now lies still with hope


The purple gloom of midnight hides
all outward signs of the decay.
A sense of grandeur still abides.
That’s absent by the light of day. 

  Stray silver moonbeams softly show 
to best advantage what remains
 of elegance from long ago 
but very tactfully refrain, 

From highlighting faults and flaws, 
 so obvious in the bright sunlight.
The broken panes and sagging doors
are kindly hidden by the night..

The formal gardens overgrown.
They have been long deprived of care, 
dividing walls just heaps of stone.
Show through the brambles here and there.


I chose to walk this way by night.
 By daylight it distresses me
 to see it in its present plight. 
When I recall it used to be.

A boys idea of paradise
I used to wish that it was mine.
It makes me sad to realise.
Nothing can halt its slow decline.

They’ll tear it down and in its place.
They will erect monstrosities 
without a single saving grace.
That they can sell profitably.

A stately home for centuries
 will disappear without a trace.
 But I will retain my memories.
That something that they can’t erase.




When the last lonely bar has closed
And you’re drunk with sadness
And not with booze; 
Look me up with your running panty hose
And your smoky dress; 
Look me up with your tearful eyes
And your weary voice; 
Look me up with your abandoned children
Dangling from your heart
Like a nearly broken necklace; 
Look me up like a lost sinner
With unutterable crimes to confess
Look me up, dear angel, 
Before you’re gone forever, 
A fading memory beneath forgetful sod. 


WE who are old, old and gay,
O so old!
Thousands of years, thousands of years,
If all were told:
Give to these children, new from the world,
Silence and love;
And the long dew-dropping hours of the night,
And the stars above:
Give to these children, new from the world,
Rest far from men.
Is anything better, anything better?
Tell us it then:
Us who are old, old and gay,
O so old!
Thousands of years, thousands of years,
If all were told. 


The shattered glass our failed charade, 
he parades his hearts blockade, 
he taunts me, 
he tears at my heart, 
during life's masquerade. 
The shattered glass my heart's window pane, 
acting out our sad parade. 


Am I that transparent? 
You can see what I am at a glance, 
but my soul is buried deep, 
try and probe this endless sleep, 
and you'll find me lying there, 
no where to go, 
no one to know, 
no one to see, 
no one to be, 
no one that cares, 
that cares for me. 


Our weak facade, 
our lifeless ball masquerade, 
no one to see, 
no one to be, 
as we preform our failed charade, 
acting out our sad parade. 

In my land there spreads a great Plague
That leaves my countrymen in a coma
An ideology that has failed and is vague
Still tries to brainwash with its dogma.

Its interest breeds undue Unrest
Banking on the throes of Poverty, 
Wearing the Mask that it wants the best
But in truth, it is rooted in Autocracy.


History revealed its pathetic dreams-
In places it reigned there was Chaos, 
And those who pursue its ways it seems
Just want Power to bring us a great loss.

Freedom has been where this land embarks, 
It people, though lowly, have Patriotism.
And never will there be the teachings of Marx
That will seed here to grow Communism.


NEVER

A path was drawn for his leadership, 
No man had ever been more blessed, 
Of Philistine hold and grant Israel rest.

Born through the hand of the Almighty, 
A Nazirite from birth, strong physically, 
He sadly grew up to be a stubborn lad.

He was weak with women and in character, 
Devoid of respect and had a quick temper, 
Prone to resolve all issues with anger
Through violent rage ending up with murder.

With all his physique, he failed to free
His land Israel from her captivity.
Revenge was his focus, his main agenda
Till he fell in love with sly Delilah.

Empty in the head and never had a plan, 
Samson was a strong hunk but failed as a man.
Delilah had used him and with his sight gone, 
He ended up a toy for the Philistine fun.

His strength was restored albeit in futility, 
He died in his blindness physically
But then he saw Truth spiritually.


In the Book of Judges, he is remembered
As the man with potentials for great leadership, 
In death he lost that success from his grip.

There are Samsons today, in our times.
With all their knowledge, they engage in crime, 
For strength and power, dollars and dimes, 
Failed leadership is a generation's slime.





I MEANT to be so strong and true!
The world may smile and question, When?
But what I might have been to you
I cannot be to other men.
Just one in twenty to the rest,
And all in all to you alone, -
This was my dream; perchance 'tis best
That this, like other dreams, is flown.


For you I should have been so kind,
So prompt my spirit to control,
To win fresh vigor for my mind,
And purer beauties for my soul;
Beneath your eye I might have grown
To that divine, ideal height,
Which, mating wholly with your own,
Our equal spirits should unite. 





I think that I shall never know
Why I am thus, and I am so.
Around me, other girls inspire
In men the rush and roar of fire,
The sweet transparency of glass,
The tenderness of April grass,
The durability of granite;
But me- I don't know how to plan it.
The lads I've met in Cupid's deadlock
Were- shall we say?- born out of wedlock.
They broke my heart, they stilled my song,
And said they had to run along,
Explaining, so to sop my tears,
First came their parents or careers.
But ever does experience
Deny me wisdom, calm, and sense!
Though she's a fool who seeks to capture
The twenty-first fine, careless rapture,
I must go on, till ends my rope,
Who from my birth was cursed with hope.
A heart in half is chaste, archaic;
But mine resembles a mosaic-
The thing's become ridiculous!
Why am I so? Why am I thus



 when the wizard's wand
Had wrecked for aye my fairyland;
Had razed my castles to the earth,
And killed my child heart with his mirth;
Then weeds grew rank where flowers had been,
And slow snakes flashed their length between.

With many tears I called your name,
And 'Give me back my fairyland!'
You took me by the willing hand
Ere day had lit the dawn's pale flame;
You left me when the darkness came.

You said you'd find my fairyland.
I open eyes too sad for tears—
Nought but an open grave appears. 

In having made me so.
And let my spirit go.

Please take my wings and let me be
One of your cherished kind.
A human being who lives and dies
And knows and lives their mind.

I cannot love or now be loved
Or cherish love in art.
So take these wings, I yield them for
A fragile human heart.

You know I've cried a million tears
And how it pains my soul.
To only love, and yes, be loved
Has always been my goal. 


I've done all that you ask.
Please let me die to know that love
In which your favored bask.

And give my wings to human kind
Who may not know their cost.
So they may come to you as I 
In knowledge of what's lost. 


Faint fairy out of fantasy, 
Draws out its slender wand
To touch the heart in its warm stead, 
So to keep it running bright
Like the summer coming straight, 
Quick within like an ocean 
In its watery joy.
Into it to sink deep in the heart, 
Where the glow charts
Brightness to get the vibrancy.
The smile from the light being
Shows satisfaction. 

Over hill, over dale,
Thorough bush, thorough brier,
Over park, over pale,
Thorough flood, thorough fire!
I do wander everywhere,
Swifter than the moon's sphere;
To dew her orbs upon the green;
The cowslips tall her pensioners be;
In their gold coats spots you see;
Those be rubies, fairy favours;
In those freckles live their savours;
I must go seek some dewdrops here,
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear. 


On winter nights beside the nursery fire 
We read the fairy tale, while glowing coals 
Builded its pictures. There before our eyes 
We saw the vaulted hall of traceried stone 
Uprear itself, the distant ceiling hung 
With pendent stalactites like frozen vines; 
And all along the walls at intervals, 
Curled upwards into pillars, roses climbed, 
And ramped and were confined, and clustered leaves 
Divided where there peered a laughing face. 
The foliage seemed to rustle in the wind, 
A silent murmur, carved in still, gray stone. 
High pointed windows pierced the southern wall 
Whence proud escutcheons flung prismatic fires 
To stain the tessellated marble floor 
With pools of red, and quivering green, and blue; 
And in the shade beyond the further door, 
Its sober squares of black and white were hid 
Beneath a restless, shuffling, wide-eyed mob 
Of lackeys and retainers come to view 
A sudden blare of trumpets, and the throng 
About the entrance parted as the guests 
Filed singly in with rare and precious gifts. 
Our eager fancies noted all they brought, 
The glorious, unattainable delights! 
But always there was one unbidden guest 
Who cursed the child and left it bitterness. 


The fire falls asunder, all is changed, 
I am no more a child, and what I see 
Is not a fairy tale, but life, my life. 
The gifts are there, the many pleasant things: 
Health, wealth, long-settled friendships, with a name 
Which honors all who bear it, and the power 
Of making words obedient. This is much; 
But overshadowing all is still the curse, 
That never shall I be fulfilled by love! 
Along the parching highroad of the world 
No other soul shall bear mine company. 
Always shall I be teased with semblances, 
With cruel impostures, which I trust awhile 
Then dash to pieces, as a careless boy 
Flings a kaleidoscope, which shattering 
Strews all the ground about with coloured sherds. 
So I behold my visions on the ground 
No longer radiant, an ignoble heap 
Of broken, dusty glass. And so, unlit, 
Even by hope or faith, my dragging steps 
Force me forever through the passing days. 


Once these paths were rivers, 
these fields the processions of water.

One day on these paths  
the princesses used to go by the pea-cock boats.
On these paths with huge goods 
the merchants used to move.

These paths were rivers, 
these fields the processions of water.

In these fields, the silvery fishes, 
touching the uprising waves, how nicely 
rolled up and down in the dark water! 

Pedestrian, 
am I telling you a fairy tale? 




Naked save for her delicate butterfly wings
She lays on a toadstool as mother nature sings
A posy of wild flowers held up to her nose
Long pixie slippers curl over her toes

A golden dragonfly hovers curiously above
Illuminating an aura of an enchanting love
The caterpillar arches her perfectly painted form
for the handsome snail with a hope so forlorn

Two magic mushrooms in wizard shaped hats
Three ladybugs chat upon their grassy mats
Time passes slowly in this moment just for me
As I gaze happily into my painted fantasy


How many of you can find a faithful friend? 
That will stick close by you unto the very end
When trouble comes they will never forsake
Always ready to give more than they will take

A friend like that is so very hard to find
One you can count on to talk and unwind
Someone that's concerned about how you feel
Cares for you deeply with a love that's real

A friend when in need is a friend indeed
Show yourself friendly by sowing the seed
How sweet are the words spoken between friends
Just like a balm that heals or a needle that mends

A friend that sticks closer than any brother
Very trustworthy and not the same as another
You can count on them to answer when you call
There to help you when your back is to the wall




To tame alike, humans and kine.

He breathes with us, with us he dines, 
The cupbearer of life’s wine.

He feeds us all - the beings of clay, 
As people raise chickens for prey.

We play in his gape, love in his lap, 
Unaware of his bewitching trap.

He relishes our cries and sighs
While lurking in passionless skies.

He is the solid truth here
His shadows are kin and peers.

He is death, our faithful lover
Who leads us to peace bricked bower.



Starting to drown in her fake personality, 
Try to stay afloat, but she snaps back to reality. 
Lipgloss, mirrors, designer clothes. 
Everyday she has to be on her toes. 
Shopping, smoothies, guys galore. 
Learning to fit in, yet still wanting more. 
One little slip, and your starting to fall, 
acting less like a human, and more like a doll. 
Wanting the attention, and all of the wealth. 
But to achieve this, she couldn't be herself. 
As she starts to drown in her fake personality, 
she wonders if she wants this that badly. 
Lipgloss, mirrors, and designer clothes, 
she looks for a way to end this all.


"You know that place between sleep and awake, 
That place where you still remember dreaming? 
That’s where I’ll always love you, 
That’s where I’ll be waiting." ~ Peter Pan


Now a little more beautiful you should be
And more deeper the meaning of solitude in your eyes
How many rains passed over them as far as dreams
How many lunar eclipses, and solar flares
How many winds blew after the parting
Like a single frame of a black-and-white silent film
Still stands in the prehistory of all remembrances

Left for me the books read and forgotten
Wish candles gone out in a ruined church
Left for me spleen and melancholy in a thousand pieces
Dried oysters, cries of flamingoes
Upside down rowing boats, preparation for migration
Left for me the last sand castle at the shore
Under the siege of phosphorescences
And the waves of sunset sea

Left for me miseries only-adjacent
The doorbells rung and fled, apartment apertures
Battles of district, pregnant cats of the street
Left for me a seam on my knee souvenir from childhood
And the pain I still feel today of the cobblestone
Upon which I fell at the moment I left
The hand of my mother

Left for me a rickety bike without tires
Nobody rides, abandoned on a vacant lot
A wired toy car adorned by staples
And a second hand loneliness made in China
As a matter of life and death
Left for me a pirate ship on steam
And at its deck the Albatross without a mate
In the Baudelaire’s poem
Not yet dead! 


Left for me the medieval chateau in which Rilke wrote his requiems
Cold courtyards, desolate holy springs, Dracula’s cellars
Country travels, golden thistles, old landscape pictures
An official post at the Dead Letter Office of Bartleby
Left for me graverobbers who drink wine from skulls
A puppet theater of fake loves in my broken heart
The torn pages of a Barbara Cartland novel
Pirandello’s plays, Piranesi’s prisons

Left for me sculpted pumpkins, tumbled down pine trees
A fall still life and the sounds of accordion

But now a little more beautiful you should be


Nevermore at doorways that are barken
Shall the madcap wind knock and the moonlight;
Nor the circle which thou once didst darken,
Shine with footsteps of the neighbouring moonlight,
Visitors for whom thou oft didst hearken.

Nevermore, gallooned with cloudy laces,
Shall the morning, like a fair freebooter,
Make thy leaves his richest treasure-places;
Nor the sunset, like a royal suitor,
Clothe thy limbs with his imperial graces.

And no more, between the savage wonder
Of the sunset and the moon's up-coming,
Shall the storm, with boisterous hoof-beats, under
Thy dark roof dance, Faun-like, to the humming
Of the Pan-pipes of the rain and thunder.

Oft the Satyr-spirit, beauty-drunken,
Of the Spring called; and the music measure
Of thy sap made answer; and thy sunken
Veins grew vehement with youth, whose pressure
Swelled thy gnarly muscles, winter-shrunken.

And the germs, deep down in darkness rooted,
Bubbled green from all thy million oilets,
Where the spirits, rain-and-sunbeam-suited,
Of the April made their whispering toilets,
Or within thy stately shadow footed.


Oft the hours of blonde Summer tinkled
At the windows of thy twigs, and found thee
Bird-blithe; or, with shapely bodies, twinkled
Lissom feet of naked flowers around thee,
Where thy mats of moss lay sunbeam-sprinkled.

And the Autumn with his gypsy-coated
Troop of days beneath thy branches rested,
Swarthy-faced and dark of eye; and throated
Songs of roaming; or with red hand tested
Every nut-bur that above him floated.

Then the Winter, barren-browed, but rich in
Shaggy followers of frost and freezing,
Made the floor of thy broad boughs his kitchen,
Trapper-like, to camp in; grimly easing
Limbs snow-furred and moccasined with lichen.

Now, alas! no more do these invest thee
With the dignity of whilom gladness!
They unto whose hearts thou once confessed thee
Of thy dreams now know thee not! and sadness


why you so pale? 
O fallen feather! 
where is your friend? 
O fallen feather! 

it is me who wait
O fallen feather! 
always beside you
O fallen feather! 

why you so sad? 
O fallen feather! 
where is your green? 
O fallen feather! 

there is a pond
O fallen feather! 
who can receive
O fallen feather! 

fly down beautifully
O fallen feather! 
through snow 
O fallen feather! 

bring love's message
O fallen feather! 
to all man's heart
O fallen feather


A trusting little leaf of green, 
 A bold audacious frost; 
A rendezvous, a kiss or two, 
 And youth for ever lost.
      Ah, me! 
 The bitter, bitter cost.

A flaunting patch of vivid red, 
 That quivers in the sun; 
A windy gust, a grave of dust, 
 The little race is run.
      Ah, me! 


a fallen leaf
hugs the roof
a fallen leaf
sends a grief

a fallen leaf
has to leave
a fallen leaf
such relief

a fallen leaf
smiles to me
a fallen leaf
touches me 

a fallen leaf
dreams of me
a fallen leaf
loves me

O fallen leaf! 
no more, no more
you left me
no more, no more

O fallen leaf! 
be with me
wherever
be with me


Who will dance with the wind now that you’re really gone? 
Who will catch the sun’s rays on the hot summer morn? 

Who will slow down the gust when it’s out of control? 
Who will dilute the air that’s toxic to my soul? 

Who will speak to the clouds about sending the rain? 
Who will shelter me from the storm and soothe my pain? 

Who will stand in the rain when others hide away? 
Who will provide a place for little birds to play? 
 
Who will catch my rain drops before they touch the ground? 
Who will keep luxuriant  grass from  turning brown? 

Who will present me a fruit for my morning dish? 
Who will nourish my eyes and satisfy my wish? 

Who will fix this huge hole in the soil of my heart? 
Who will give me comfort now that we are apart



A FALLING LEAF

In the multitude
    between the cacophonies
         of the world’s moods

there free falls
    from a maple tree
         with waving witnesses

a solitary leaf
    the only from the
         many arms of this
	  aging forest amazon

an appendage dropping, 
    descending, drifting, 
         sailing downward
 
from its height
    to an umbrageous world
         below ––––    	

a solo flight
    its last and only journey
         with earth’s gravity
              to a mossy couch
                   below –––– 

to be transfigured
    into elemental structures
         in mother nature’s
             compost factory

architectured to be hoisted upward
    through subterranean corridors
         then erected in budded form

into a newly-Easter 
    arboreal quilted aparison

to awaken with the 
    luminescence of a 
          rousing sun

to flutter with the melodic
         breezes of spring airs

to hear the distant
    drumming of an on-marching storm

to pitter and patter 
    with dripping drops of rain

to once again be a leaf –– 
    one with the fingernails of a tree.


A soul falling deeper
and deeper into despair
calling out for someone
to be there

As the souls merge as one
to relight and raise 
the falling soul
a peaceful calm engulfs
the earth

As they all rise together
they all know, 
unlike the living they will
always be one


They say: 
'you snooze, you lose'
and it's said like a truth I should keep
but the uncouth answer I choose
Is at least you don't lose sleep

Time draws near, I await my fate, 
The fate all mortals must await; 
Or must I make this trip alone? 

My dimming faith has gone astray, 
On this I think and even pray; 
This sordid world of greed and sin, 
Has stretched my faith extremely thin, .

Am I alone, do others see
Religion's great diversity; 
Eternal wars in faith's own name, 
Faith without works must take the blame.

Time's drawing near, but I must wait
To view the face of Heaven's gate; 
When, if I see death's final glow
Then I shall know, most surely know. 


YES, write, if you want to, there's nothing like trying;
     Who knows what a treasure your casket may hold?
     I'll show you that rhyming's as easy as lying,
     If you'll listen to me while the art I unfold.

     Here's a book full of words; one can choose as he fancies,
     As a painter his tint, as a workman his tool;
     Just think! all the poems and plays and romances
     Were drawn out of this, like the fish from a pool!

     You can wander at will through its syllabled mazes,
     And take all you want, not a copper they cost,--
     What is there to hinder your picking out phrases
     For an epic as clever as "Paradise Lost"?

     Don't mind if the index of sense is at zero,
     Use words that run smoothly, whatever they mean;
     Leander and Lilian and Lillibullero
     Are much the same thing in the rhyming machine.

     There are words so delicious their sweetness will smother
     That boarding-school flavor of which we're afraid,
     There is "lush"is a good one, and "swirl" is another,--
     Put both in one stanza, its fortune is made.

     With musical murmurs and rhythmical closes
     You can cheat us of smiles when you've nothing to tell
     You hand us a nosegay of milliner's roses, 
     And we cry with delight, "Oh, how sweet they do smell!"

     Perhaps you will answer all needful conditions
     For winning the laurels to which you aspire,
     By docking the tails of the two prepositions
     I' the style o' the bards you so greatly admire.

     As for subjects of verse, they are only too plenty
     For ringing the changes on metrical chimes;
     A maiden, a moonbeam, a lover of twenty 
     Have filled that great basket with bushels of rhymes.

     Let me show you a picture--'t is far from irrelevant--
     By a famous old hand in the arts of design;
     'T is only a photographed sketch of an elephant,--
     The name of the draughtsman was Rembrandt of Rhine.

     How easy! no troublesome colors to lay on,
     It can't have fatigued him,-- no, not in the least,--
     A dash here and there with a haphazard crayon,
     And there stands the wrinkled-skinned, baggy-limbed beast.

     Just so with your verse,-- 't is as easy as sketching,--
     You can reel off a song without knitting your brow,
     As lightly as Rembrandt a drawing or etching;
     It is nothing at all, if you only know how.

     Well; imagine you've printed your volume of verses:
     Your forehead is wreathed with the garland of fame,
     Your poems the eloquent school-boy rehearses,
     Her album the school-girl presents for your name;

     Each morning the post brings you autograph letters;
     You'll answer them promptly,-- an hour isn't much
     For the honor of sharing a page with your betters,
     With magistrates, members of Congress, and such.

     Of course you're delighted to serve the committees
     That come with requests from the country all round,
     You would grace the occasion with poems and ditties
     When they've got a new schoolhouse, or poorhouse, or pound.

     With a hymn for the saints and a song for the sinners,
     You go and are welcome wherever you please;
     You're a privileged guest at all manner of dinners,
     You've a seat on the platform among the grandees.

     At length your mere presence becomes a sensation,
     Your cup of enjoyment is filled to its brim 
     With the pleasure Horatian of digitmonstration,
     As the whisper runs round of "That's he!" or "That's him!"

     But remember, O dealer in phrases sonorous,
     So daintily chosen, so tunefully matched,
     Though you soar with the wings of the cherubim o'er us,
     The ovum was human from which you were hatched.

     No will of your own with its puny compulsion
     Can summon the spirit that quickens the lyre;
     It comes, if at all, like the Sibyl's convulsion
     And touches the brain with a finger of fire.

     So perhaps, after all, it's as well to he quiet
     If you've nothing you think is worth saying in prose,
     As to furnish a meal of their cannibal diet
     To the critics, by publishing, as you propose.

     But it's all of no use, and I'm sorry I've written,--
     I shall see your thin volume some day on my shelf;
     For the rhyming tarantula surely has bitten,
     And music must cure you, so pipe it yourself. 

Being with family is best part, 

real world to spend meaningful life; 

and it is when you feel at home.  

to mingle with people you love.

 

Family is the basic unit

and the foundation of society.

making peace and unity at home, 

is the secret of a progressive community.

life shall become worthwhile for all the people

yearning for a happy family is to make it happened. 


May the years unfold gently, 
       while richly filled 
               with happiness, prosperity, and peace.
May you ever strive forward, with love 
       and friendship at your side.

Never forsaking the noble ideals, 
    to ease the suffering; 
       of mortal man. For the dream 
              is the tie to life.

      Always walk in his ways.
Returning to the path if erring footfall 
      by chance causes thee to stray.
For man’s ways hold many thorns 
      that pierce unguarded flesh.
No comfort is found there no security.

Only great pain.  torment.  distress.  
      before the grave. Man’s works 
  crumble perish with coming age.
We seek through life’s journey 
      slowly understanding - is distilled 

For life’s toils end 
      in this world of shadows - 
upon the breath of a warm wind 
      to carry us home above the plains. 


Sitting in front of the fire, Auntie Flo's reciting a story, 
the same one she broadcasts every year, 
but no one is listening.

Uncle Fred, 'out to the world' snores rhythmically
on the sofa.

Mother exhausted, having cooked the lunch, 
without help, as usual, 
stifles a yawn.

Dad, brow furrowed, is trying to piece together
Eddy's lego set, 
whilst Eddy glowers, 
after all, it was 'his' present.

Joe, playing with a set of 'disco lights'
is sending flashes of colour across the room, 
straight into Grandpa's eyes, 
making him feel even more bilious
after having consumed too many chocolates.

Grandma's knitting.
and every other day, come to that, 
probably yet another scarf for what she believes is
still the war effort.

The cat, curled up on her lap, purrs contently, 
oblivious of the knitting needles, waving precariously
in front of his sleepy eyes.

Susan is gazing at the TV screen, .
glued, for the umpteenth time to, 'The Sound of Music' movie, 
singing every song, word for word, 
at the top of her voice.

'Turkey was nice', said Auntie, 
'I was given too much', moaned Grandpa, belching loudly.
'Your problem is, you never can refuse a second helping', said Grandma, 'so it's your own fault'.


Mother grins and asks, 
'Would anybody like another mince pie? 'Once more we talk about it.
How sad it's all become.
No matter how we look at it
this family is not one.

They say it shouldn't matter.
Who needs them after all? 
But, please explain the pain I feel
even though I've got it all.

I see my pain and emptiness
like a hollowed out old tree. 
It may seem to be standing tall
but, it's empty just like me.

There's such a contradiction
to my entire life.
I'm happy and fulfilled 
being a mother and a wife.

What about 'a sister'
and 'a daughter'

how about that? 
These are roles I was born to play.
Why can't I? Tell me that.


A family divided
that's what we've grown to be.
I've got mine and you've got yours
but we have no family tree. 

A thirsty town fails, harvesting the moon, 
and turns into a vast lake of tears.
They were fighting for their right to remain
poor and hungry. It was a fractured
amnesia in the pit of flesh.

Was it a pink rose? No one had planted
a kiss on the lips of a thorn. An unbuttoned
triangle snaps the cold and opens the thighs
of a tulip valley. Drop by dropp honeydew
dances into a hairy lap.

The shooting stars go into trance, multiply
the intimate minutes and indulge in
sprouting the horns. The longest night feels
betrayed and beseeches foremothers to
conceive again.



 

NOT to myself this breath of vesper song,
Not to these patient friends, this kindly throng,
Not to this hallowed morning, though it be
When every summit, topmast, steeple, tower,
That owns her empire spreads her starry flower,
Its blood-streaked leaves in heaven's benignant dew
Washed clean from every crimson stain they knew,--
No, not to these the passing thrills belong
That steal my breath to hush themselves with song.
These moments all are memory's; I have come
To speak with lips that rather should be dumb;
For what are words? At every step I tread
The dust that wore the footprints of the dead
But for whose life my life had never known
This faded vesture which it calls its own.
Here sleeps my father's sire, and they who gave
That earlier life here found their peaceful grave.
In days gone by I sought the hallowed ground;
Climbed yon long slope; the sacred spot I found
Where all unsullied lies the winter snow,
Where all ungathered spring's pale violets blow,
And tracked from stone to stone the Saxon name
That marks the blood I need not blush to claim,
Blood such as warmed the Pilgrim sons of toil,
I come an alien to your hills and plains,
Yet feel your birthright tingling in my veins;
Mine are this changing prospect's sun and shade,
In full-blown summer's bridal pomp arrayed;
Mine these fair hillsides and the vales between;
Mine the sweet streams that lend their brightening green;
I breathed your air--the sunlit landscape smiled;
I touch your soil--it knows its children's child;
Throned in my heart your heritage is mine;
I claim it all by memory's right divine
Waking, I dream. Before my vacant eyes
In long procession shadowy forms arise;
Far through the vista of the silent years
I see a venturous band; the pioneers,
Who let the sunlight through the forest's gloom,
Who bade the harvest wave, the garden bloom.
Hark! loud resounds the bare-armed settler's axe,
See where the stealthy panther left his tracks!
As fierce, as stealthy creeps the skulking foe
With stone-tipped shaft and sinew-corded bow;
Soon shall he vanish from his ancient reign,
Leave his last cornfield to the coming train,
Quit the green margin of the wave he drinks,
For haunts that hide the wild-cat and the lynx.

But who the Youth his glistening axe that swings
To smite the pine that shows a hundred rings?
His features?--something in his look I find
That calls the semblance of my race to mind.
His name?--my own; and that which goes before
The same that once the loved disciple bore.
Young, brave, discreet, the father of a line
Whose voiceless lives have found a voice in mine;
Thinned by unnumbered currents though they be,
Thanks for the ruddy drops I claim from thee!

The seasons pass; the roses come and go;
Snows fall and melt; the waters freeze and flow;
The boys are men; the girls, grown tall and fair,
Have found their mates; a gravestone here and there
Tells where the fathers lie; the silvered hair
Of some bent patriarch yet recalls the time
That saw his feet the northern hillside climb,
A pilgrim from the pilgrims far away,
The godly men, the dwellers by the bay.
On many a hearthstone burns the cheerful fire;
The schoolhouse porch, the heavenward pointing spire
Proclaim in letters every eye can read,
Knowledge and Faith, the new world's simple creed.
Hush! 't is the Sabbath's silence-stricken morn
No feet must wander through the tasselled corn;
No merry children laugh around the door,
No idle playthings strew the sanded floor;
The law of Moses lays its awful ban
On all that stirs; here comes the tithing-man
At last the solemn hour of worship calls;
Slowly they gather in the sacred walls;
Man in his strength and age with knotted staff,
And boyhood aching for its week-day laugh,
The toil-worn mother with the child she leads,
The maiden, lovely in her golden beads,--
The popish symbols round her neck she wears,
But on them counts her lovers, not her prayers,--
Those youths in homespun suits and ribboned queues,
Whose hearts are beating in the high-backed pews.
The pastor rises; looks along the seats
With searching eye; each wonted face he meets;
Asks heavenly guidance; finds the chapter's place
That tells some tale of Israel's stubborn race;
Gives out the sacred song; all voices join,
For no quartette extorts their scanty coin;
Then while both hands their black-gloved palms display,
Lifts his gray head, and murmurs, 'Let us pray!'
And pray he does! as one that never fears
What if he dwells on many a fact as though
Some things Heaven knew not which it ought to know,--
Tells Him there's something He must not forget;
Such are the prayers his people love to hear,--
See how the Deacon slants his listening ear!
What! look once more! Nay, surely there I trace
The hinted outlines of a well-known face!
Not those the lips for laughter to beguile,
Yet round their corners lurks an embryo smile,
The same on other lips my childhood knew
That scarce the Sabbath's mastery could subdue.
Him too my lineage gives me leave to claim,--
The good, grave man that bears the Psalmist's name.

And still in ceaseless round the seasons passed;
Spring piped her carol; Autumn blew his blast;
Babes waxed to manhood; manhood shrunk to age;
Life's worn-out players tottered off the stage;
The few are many; boys have grown to men
Since Putnam dragged the wolf from Pomfret's den;
Our new-old Woodstock is a thriving town;
Brave are her children; faithful to the crown;
Her soldiers' steel the savage redskin knows;
Their blood has crimsoned his Canadian snows.
And now once more along the quiet vale
Rings the dread call that turns the mothers pale;
Full well they know the valorous heat that runs
In every pulse-beat of their loyal sons;
Who would not bleed in good King George's cause
When England's lion shows his teeth and claws?
With glittering firelocks on the village green
In proud array a martial band is seen;
You know what names those ancient rosters hold,--
Whose belts were buckled when the drum-beat rolled,--
But mark their Captain! tell us, who is he?
On his brown face that same old look I see
Yes! from the homestead's still retreat he came,
Whose peaceful owner bore the Psalmist's name;
The same his own. Well, Israel's glorious king
Who struck the harp could also whirl the sling,--
Breathe in his song a penitential sigh
And smite the sons of Amalek hip and thigh:
These shared their task; one deaconed out the psalm,
One slashed the scalping hell-hounds of calm;
The praying father's pious work is done,
Now sword in hand steps forth the fighting son.
On many a field he fought in wilds afar;
See on his swarthy cheek the bullet's scar!
There hangs a murderous tomahawk; beneath,
Without its blade, a knife's embroidered sheath;
Save for the stroke his trusty weapon dealt
His scalp had dangled at their owner's belt;
But not for him such fate; he lived to see
The bloodier strife that made our nation free,
To serve with willing toil, with skilful hand,
The war-worn saviors of the bleeding land.
His wasting life to others' needs he gave,--
Sought rest in home and found it in the grave.
See where the stones life's brief memorials keep,
The tablet telling where he 'fell on sleep,'--
Watched by a winged cherub's rayless eye,--
A scroll above that says we all must die,--
Those saddening lines beneath, the 'Night-Thoughts' lent:
So stands the Soldier's, Surgeon's monument.
Ah! at a glance my filial eye divines
The scholar son in those remembered lines.

The Scholar Son. His hand my footsteps led.
No more the dim unreal past I tread.
O thou whose breathing form was once so dear,
Whose cheering voice was music to my ear,
Art thou not with me as my feet pursue
The village paths so well thy boyhood knew,
Along the tangled margin of the stream
Whose murmurs blended with thine infant dream,
Or climb the hill, or thread the wooded vale,
Or seek the wave where gleams yon distant sail,
Or the old homestead's narrowed bounds explore,
Where sloped the roof that sheds the rains no more,
Where one last relic still remains to tell
Here stood thy home,--the memory-haunted well,
Whose waters quench a deeper thirst than thine,
Changed at my lips to sacramental wine,--
Art thou not with me, as I fondly trace
The scanty records of thine honored race,
Call up the forms that earlier years have known,
And spell the legend of each slanted stone?
With thoughts of thee my loving verse began,
Not for the critic's curious eye to scan,
Not for the many listeners, but the few
Whose fathers trod the paths my fathers knew;
Still in my heart thy loved remembrance burns;
Still to my lips thy cherished name returns;
Could I but feel thy gracious presence near
Amid the groves that once to thee were dear
Could but my trembling lips with mortal speech
Thy listening ear for one brief moment reach!
How vain the dream! The pallid voyager's track
No sign betrays; he sends no message back.
No word from thee since evening's shadow fell
On thy cold forehead with my long farewell,--
Now from the margin of the silent sea,
Take my last offering ere I cross to thee


The family all gathered around the heavy laden table
Their hands clasped together with heads bowed down low
Giving their many thanks for another chance to be able
To receive all the blessings that the Father would bestow

Many tasty home made dishes were passed from hand to hand
Sounds of laughter coming from every woman, child and man
Conversations around the table would never seem to end
Others wondering when they'll ever see each other again

Children running to and fro in each and every directions
Everyone showing lots of love and many unbridled affections
Families coming together in a great display of much unity
Allowing others to see how a family should really ought to be

The time has been much well spent and now it is time to part
Seeing loved ones once again had really touched their heart
Goodbyes and farewells were one of the hardest things to do
Looking forward to another reunion and another new year too




 Whose comfort is dismaid,
Whose hope is vaine, whose faith is scorned,
 Whose trust is all betraid,


 If he have held them deare,
 And cannot cease to moane,
Come, let him take his place by me;
 He shall not rue alone.


 But if the smalest sweete
 Be mixt with all his sowre;
If in the day, the moneth, the yeare,
 He finde one lightsome hower,


 Then rest he by himself;
 He is noe mate for me,
Whose hope is falen, whose succor voyde,
 Whose hart his death must be.


 Yet not the wished death,
 That hathe noe plainte nor lacke,
Which, making free the better parte,
 Is onely nature's sacke.


 Oh me! that wer too well,
 My death is of the minde,
Which alwayes yeeldes extreame paines,
 Yet keepes the worst behind.


 As one that lives in shewe
 But inwardly doth die,
Whose knowledge is a bloody field
 Wheare all hope slaine doth lie;


 Whose harte the aulter is,
 Whose spirit, the sacrifize
Unto the Powers whome to appease
 Noe sorrowes can sufize.


 Whose fancies are like thornes,
 On which I goe by night,
Whose arguments are like a hoste,
 That force hath put to flight.


 Whose sense is passion's spye,
 Whose thoughtes, like ruins old
Of Carthage, or the famous towne
 That Sinon bought and sold.


 Which still before my face,
 My mortall foe doth lay,
Whome love and fortune once advanced
 And nowe hath cast away.


 O thoughtes! noe thoughtes but woundes,
 Sometimes the seate of Joy
Sometimes the chaire of quiet rest
 But nowe of all annoy.


 I sowed the feild of peace,
 My blisse was in the Springe;
And day by day I ate the fruit
 That my Live's tree did bring.


 To nettels nowe my corne,
 My feild is turnd to flint,
Where sitting in the cipres shade,
 I reade the hiacint.


 The joy, the rest, the life
 That I enioyed of yore
Came to my lot that by my losse,
 My smarte might smarte the more.


 Thus to unhappie men
 The best frames to the worste;
O tyme, O places. O woordes, O lookes,
 Deere then but nowe accurst!


 In 'was' stood my delight,
 In 'is' and 'shall' my woe;
My horrors fastned in the 'yea,'
 My hope hangs in the 'noe.'


 I looke for noe delight,
 Releefe will come too late;
Too late I finde, I finde too well,
 Too well stoode my Estate.


 Behold, heere is the end,
 And nothing heere is sure:
Ah nothinge ells but plaints and cares
 Doth to the world enduer.


 Forsaken first was I,
 Then utterly foregotten;
And he that came not to my faith,
 Lo! my reward hath gotten.


 Nowe Love, where are thy lawes
 That make thy torments sweete?
What is the cause that some through thee
 Have thought their death but meet?


 Thy stately chaste disdaine,
 Thy secret thanckfulnes,
Thy grace reservd, thy common light
 That shines in worthines.


 O that it were not soe
 Or that I could excuse!
O that the wrath of Jelousie
 My judgement might abuse!


 O fraile unconstant kind,
 And safe in truste to noe man!
Noe woemen angells are, yet loe!
 My mistris is a woman!


 Yet hate I but the falte,
 And not the faultie one;
Nor can I rid me of the bonds
 Wherein I lie alone.


 Alone I lie, whose like
 By love was never yet;
Nor rich, nor poore, nor younge, nor old,
 Nor fond, nor full of witt.


 Hers still remaine must I,
 By wronge, by death, by shame;
I cannot blot out of my minde
 That love wrought in her name.


 I cannot set at naught
 That I have held soe deare,
I cannot make it seem so farre
 That is indeede soe neare.


 Nor that I meane, henceforth
 This strange will to professe:
I never will betray such trust
 And fall to ficklenesse.


 Nor shall it ever faile
 That my word bare in hand:
I gave my word, my worde gave me,
 Both worde and gaift shall stand.


 Syth then it must be thus
 And this is all to ill,
I yeelde me captiue to my curse,
 My harde fate to fulfill.


 The solitarie woodes,
 My Cittie shall become;
The darkest den shalbe my lodge
 Whereto noe light shall come.


 Of heban blacke my boorde;
 The wormes my meate shalbe,
Wherewith my carcase shalbe fed
 Till thes doe feede on me.


 My wine, of Niobe,
 My bed the cragie rocke,
My harmony, the serpent's hisse,
 The shreikinge owle, my cocke.


 Mine exercise naught ells
 But raginge agonies;
My bookes, of spightfull fortune's foiles
 And drerye tragedies.


 My walkes the pathes of plaint,
 My prospect into Hell,
With Sisiphus and all his pheres
 In endles paines to dwell.


 And though I seeme to use
 The poet's fained stile,
To figure forth my wofull plight,
 My fall and my exile.


 Yet is my greeffe not faind,
 Wherein I starve and pine,
Whoe feeleth most shall finde it least
 Comparinge his with mine.


 My songe,--if anie aske
 Whose grievous case is such?
Dy er thou let'st his name be knowne,--
 His follye showes too much.


 But best, were thee to hide
 And never come to light;
For in the worle can none but thee
 These accents sound aright.


 And soe a end: my tale is tould:
 His life is but disdaind,
Whose sorrowes present paine him soe,
 His pleasures are full faind.


 

Feelings fathom fantasy, 
Words that become song, 
When in melodious unity, 
A Poem may be born. 


I'll tell you something: every day
people are dying. And that's just the beginning.
Every day, in funeral homes, new widows are born,
new orphans. They sit with their hands folded,
trying to decide about this new life.

Then they're in the cemetery, some of them
for the first time. They're frightened of crying,
sometimes of not crying. Someone leans over,
tells them what to do next, which might mean
saying a few words, sometimes
throwing dirt in the open grave.


And after that, everyone goes back to the house,
which is suddenly full of visitors.
The widow sits on the couch, very stately,
so people line up to approach her,
sometimes take her hand, sometimes embrace her.
She finds something to say to everbody,
thanks them, thanks them for coming.

In her heart, she wants them to go away.
She wants to be back in the cemetery,
back in the sickroom, the hospital. She knows
it isn't possible. But it's her only hope,
the wish to move backward. And just a little,
not so far as the marriage, the first kiss. 


A fantasy that came to me
As wild and wantonly designed
As ever any dream might be
Unraveled from a madman's mind,--
A tangle-work of tissue, wrought
By cunning of the spider-brain,
And woven, in an hour of pain,
To trap the giddy flies of thought.


I stood beneath a summer moon
All swollen to uncanny girth,
And hanging, like the sun at noon,
Above the center of the earth;
But with a sad and sallow light,
As it had sickened of the night
And fallen in a pallid swoon.
Around me I could hear the rush
Of sullen winds, and feel the whir
Of unseen wings apast me brush
Like phantoms round a sepulcher;
And, like a carpeting of plush,

A lawn unrolled beneath my feet,
Bespangled o'er with flowers as sweet
To look upon as those that nod
But odorless as those that blow
In ashes in the shades below.

And on my hearing fell a storm
Of gusty music, sadder yet
Than every whimper of regret
That sobbing utterance could form,
And patched with scraps of sound that seemed
Torn out of tunes that demons dreamed,
And pitched to such a piercing key,
It stabbed the ear with agony;
And when at last it lulled and died,
I stood aghast and terrified.
I shuddered and I shut my eyes,
And still could see, and feel aware
Some mystic presence waited there;
And staring, with a dazed surprise,
I saw a creature so divine
That never subtle thought of mine
May reproduce to inner sight
So fair a vision of delight.

A syllable of dew that drips
From out a lily's laughing lips
Could not be sweeter than the word
I listened to, yet never heard.--
For, oh, the woman hiding there
Within the shadows of her hair,
Spake to me in an undertone
So delicate, my soul alone
But understood it as a moan
Of some weak melody of wind
A heavenward breeze had left behind.

A tracery of trees, grotesque
Against the sky, behind her seen,
Like shapeless shapes of arabesque
Wrought in an Oriental screen;
And tall, austere and statuesque
She loomed before it--e'en as though
The spirit-hand of Angelo
Had chiseled her to life complete,
With chips of moonshine round her feet.
And I grew jealous of the dusk,
To see it softly touch her face,
As lover-like, with fond embrace,
It folded round her like a husk:
But when the glitter of her hand,
Like wasted glory, beckoned me,
My eyes grew blurred and dull and dim--
My vision failed--I could not see--
I could not stir--I could but stand,
Till, quivering in every limb,
I flung me prone, as though to swim
The tide of grass whose waves of green
Went rolling ocean-wide between
My helpless shipwrecked heart and her
Who claimed me for a worshiper.

And writhing thus in my despair,
I heard a weird, unearthly sound,
That seemed to lift me from the ground
And hold me floating in the air.
I looked, and lo! I saw her bow
Above a harp within her hands;
A crown of blossoms bound her brow,
And on her harp were twisted strands
Of silken starlight, rippling o'er
With music never heard before
By mortal ears; and, at the strain,
I felt my Spirit snap its chain
And break away,--and I could see
It as it turned and fled from me
To greet its mistress, where she smiled
To see the phantom dancing wild
And wizard-like before the spell
Her mystic fingers knew so well. 

I saw Winter 'neath a spindle tree,
She plucked berries bright to crown her head.
She was singing little robin's song
While wild beech-leaves round and round her spread.
I ran home into my little house,
Pulled to the shutters, barred up the door;
I knelt down to blow the fire to flame,
Great dark shadows danced upon the floor.
Long-legged shadows came from corners drear,
Leaped up white walls, fell, and climbed again.
I hear North Wind pushing at the gate,
I won't open, not for wind or rain.
Oh, run home, wee ones, lest the whirling leaves
Take ye far away, fairy folk to see.
Crowning her dark hair with berries red
I saw Winter 'neath a spindle tree. 

Her voice is like clear water 
That drips upon a stone 
In forests far and silent 
Where Quiet plays alone.

Her thoughts are like the lotus 
Abloom by sacred streams 
Beneath the temple arches 
Where Quiet sits and dreams.

Her kisses are the roses 
That glow while dusk is deep 
In Persian garden closes 
Where Quiet falls asleep. 

I was an Arab, 
I loved my horse; 
Swift as an arrow 
He swept the course. 

Sweet as a lamb 
He came to hand; 
He was the flower 
Of all the land. 

Through lonely nights 
I rode afar; 
Star upon star. 

His breath the air: 
Beautiful desert, 
Boundless and bare! 

Free as the wild wind, 
Light as a foal; 
Ah, there is room there 
To stretch one's soul. 

Far reached my thought, 
Scant were my needs: 
A few bananas 
And lotus seeds. 

Sparkling as water 
Cool in the shade, 
Ibrahim's daughter, 
Beautiful maid. 

Out of thy Kulleh, 
Fairest and first, 
Give me to drink 
Quencher of thirst. 

I am athirst, girl; 
Parched with desire, 
Love in my bosom 
Burns as a fire. 

Green thy oasis, 
Waving with Palms; 
Oh, be no niggard, 
Maid, with thy alms. 

Kiss me with kisses, 
Buds of thy mouth, 
Sweeter than Cassia 
Fresh from the South. 

Bind me with tresses, 
Clasp with a curl; 
And in caresses 
Stifle me, girl. 

I was an Arab 
Ages ago! 
Hence this home-sickness 
And all my woe. 


Roaming through the meadow
With the sun shinning bright.
It's like looking through a window
Into a fantasy that portrays light.

The wind whispers through the trees
Then slips through the grass.
While asking you to come forward please
It's about to tell you your task.

Wandering down a crooked path
A stream flows into view.
This winding road holds all your wrath
And the stream hints a desolate hue.

The trail leads to open grassy hills
The wind murmurs an urgent message.
Your dream you must fulfill. 
Speaking of a secret passage.


Thunder starts to howl and lightening shrieks
You run from the raging battle to shelter.
The rain is coming down so hard it stings your cheeks
You bound like a lion who skelters.

You come upon flowing music and twinkling lights
The growling storm has seemed to dispersed.
Their enjoyable dancing has awoken the night
Have others seen this, or are you the first? 

The wondrous masquerade vanishes into the dark
The magical happenings disappear, the air is cold.
You now find yourself in a golden lit park
You know that not every story is foretold.

What an enchanting ideality this was
This must be your fantasy that you can see.
But there has to be a known cause
For this dream to occur in me.





The King is in his trenches, the millionaire at home;
The Kaiser with his toiling troops, the Czar is at the front.
And know no more than peasant girls which nation is to blame.
The wounded live to fight again, or live to slave for bread;
The Slain have graves above the Slain—the Dead are with the Dead.
The widowed young shall wed or not, the widowed old remain—
And all the nations of the world prepare for war again!
Ten millions at the battle fronts, and we’re five millions all!
We toiled not as our fathers toiled, for
Sport was all our boast;




The seer stood on the mountain side, the witch was in her cave;
The gipsy with his caravan, the sailor on the wave;
The sophist in his easy chair, with ne’er a soul to save,
The factory slaves went forth to slave, the peasant to the field;
The women worked in winter there for one-tenth of the yield;
The village Granny nursed their babes to give them time to slave;
The child was in the cradle, and the grandsire in his grave.
The rich man slumbered in his chair, full fed with wine and meat;
The lady in her carriage sat, the harlot walked the street
With paint upon her cheek and neck, through winter’s snow and sleet.
We saw the pride of Wealth go mad, and Misery increase—

The wizard on the mountain side, he drew a rasping breath,
For he was old and near to life, as he was near to death;
And he looked out and saw the star they saw at Nazareth.
"Two thousand years have passed," he said. "A thousand years," he said.
"A hundred years have passed," he said, "and, lo! the star is red!
The time has come at last," he said, and bowed his hoary head.
He laid him on the mountain-side—and so the seer was dead.
And so the Eastern Star was red, and it was red indeed—
We saw the Red Star in the South, but we took little heed.
(The Prophet in his garret starved or drank himself to death.) 

The witch was mumbling in her hole before the dawn was grey;
The witch she took a crooked stick and prodded in the clay;
She doddered round and mumbled round as is the beldame’s way.
"Four children shall be born," she said, "four children at a birth;
Four children of a peasant brood—and what shall come on earth?
Four of the poorest peasantry that Europe knows," she said,
"And all the nations of the world shall count their gory dead!"
The babes are born in Italy—and all the world is red! 



The Ship


The tree You grew was stout and sound to carve the plank and keel.
(And when the darkness hid the sky Your hand was on the wheel.)
The pine You grew was straight and tall to fashion spar and mast.
Our sails and gear from flax and hemp were stout and firm and fast.
You gave the metal from the mine and taught the carpenter
To fasten plank and rib and beam, and sheath and iron her.
More graceful than the albatross upon the morning breeze.
Ah me! she was the fairest thing that ever sailed the seas;
And when the madness of mankind burns out at last in war,
The world may yet behold the day she’ll sail the seas once more.
We stole Your electricity to fortify our pride!
You gave the horse to draw our loads, You gave the horse to ride;
But we must fly above the Alps and race beneath the tide.
We searched in sacred places for the things we did not need;
Your anger shook our cities down—and yet we took no heed.
We robbed the water and the air to give us "energy,"
As we’d exhaust Thy secret store of electricity.
The day may come—and such a day!—when we shall need all three. 


And lest Thou shouldst not understand our various ways and whys,
We sent the grand Titanic forth, for pleasure, gold and show;
And all her skeletons of wealth and jewels lie below.
For fame or curiosity, for pride, and greed, or trade,
We sought to know all things and make all things that Thou hast made!
From Pole to Pole we sought to speak, and Heaven’s powers employ—
Our cruisers feverishly seek such language to destroy.
We shaped all things for war, and now the Sister Nations wade
Knee-deep in white man’s blood to wreck all things that we have made!
For in the rottenness of Peace—worse than this bitter strife!—
We murdered the Humanity and Poetry of Life. 


The Bells and the Child
.
The gongs are in the temple—the bells are in the tower;
The "tom-tom" in the jungle and the town clock tells the hour;
And all Thy feathered kind at morn have testified Thy power. 

Did ever statesman save a land or science save a soul?—
Did ever Tower of Babel stand or war-drums cease to roll?—

Did ever child in cradle laid—born of a healthy race—
Cease for an hour, all unafraid, to testify Thy grace?
That shook its rattle from its bed in its proud father’s face? 

Cathedral bells must cease awhile, because of Pride and Sin,
Or failed to peal for victory that brave men died to win.
(Or failed to ring the Old Year out and ring the New Year in.) 

And all its ways must run with blood, for we knew more than Thou!
And millions perish at the guns or rot beside the plough,
For we knew more than Thou. 


A wind is ruffling the tawny pelt
Of Africa, Kikuyu, quick as flies,
Batten upon the bloodstreams of the veldt.
Corpses are scattered through a paradise.
Only the worm, colonel of carrion, cries:
'Waste no compassion on these separate dead!'
Statistics justify and scholars seize
The salients of colonial policy.
What is that to the white child hacked in bed?
To savages, expendable as Jews?
Threshed out by beaters, the long rushes break
In a white dust of ibises whose cries
Have wheeled since civilizations dawn
>From the parched river or beast-teeming plain.
The violence of beast on beast is read
As natural law, but upright man
Seeks his divinity by inflicting pain.
Delirious as these worried beasts, his wars
Dance to the tightened carcass of a drum, 
While he calls courage still that native dread
Of the white peace contracted by the dead.

Again brutish necessity wipes its hands
Upon the napkin of a dirty cause, again
A waste of our compassion, as with Spain,
The gorilla wrestles with the superman.
I who am poisoned with the blood of both,
Where shall I turn, divided to the vein?
I who have cursed
The drunken officer of British rule, how choose
Between this Africa and the English tongue I love?
Betray them both, or give back what they give?
How can I face such slaughter and be cool?
How can I turn from Africa and live


Each moment that I'm pulled out of the dark, I wish I could extinguish the light.
Yet some nights my eyes linger past the shade to the sunshine, 
and my soul dances feverishly to a merry song far off, 
and my heart barks at me like an anxious dog, come alive. 


Flow down, cold rivulet, to the sea,
    Thy tribute wave deliver:
No more by thee my steps shall be,
    For ever and for ever.

Flow, softly flow, by lawn and lea,
    A rivulet then a river:
Nowhere by thee my steps shall be
    For ever and for ever.

But here will sigh thine alder tree
    And here thine aspen shiver;
And here by thee will hum the bee,
    For ever and for ever.

A thousand suns will stream on thee,
    A thousand moons will quiver;
But not by thee my steps shall be,
    For ever and for ever. 


FAREWELL, thou little Nook of mountain-ground,
Thou rocky corner in the lowest stair
Of that magnificent temple which doth bound
One side of our whole vale with grandeur rare;
Sweet garden-orchard, eminently fair,
The loveliest spot that man hath ever found,
Farewell!--we leave thee to Heaven's peaceful care,
Thee, and the Cottage which thou dost surround.

Our boat is safely anchored by the shore,
And there will safely ride when we are gone; 
The flowering shrubs that deck our humble door
Will prosper, though untended and alone:
Fields, goods, and far-off chattels we have none:
These narrow bounds contain our private store
Of things earth makes, and sun doth shine upon;
Here are they in our sight--we have no more.

Sunshine and shower be with you, bud and bell!
For two months now in vain we shall be sought:
We leave you here in solitude to dwell
With these our latest gifts of tender thought; 
Thou, like the morning, in thy saffron coat,
Bright gowan, and marsh-marigold, farewell!
Whom from the borders of the Lake we brought,
And placed together near our rocky Well.

We go for One to whom ye will be dear;
And she will prize this Bower, this Indian shed,
Our own contrivance, Building without peer!
--A gentle Maid, whose heart is lowly bred,
Whose pleasures are in wild fields gathered,
With joyousness, and with a thoughtful cheer, 
Will come to you; to you herself will wed;
And love the blessed life that we lead here.

Dear Spot! which we have watched with tender heed,
Bringing thee chosen plants and blossoms blown
Among the distant mountains, flower and weed,
Which thou hast taken to thee as thy own,
Making all kindness registered and known;
Thou for our sakes, though Nature's child indeed,
Fair in thyself and beautiful alone,
Hast taken gifts which thou dost little need. 

And O most constant, yet most fickle Place,
Thou hast thy wayward moods, as thou dost show
To them who look not daily on thy face;
Who, being loved, in love no bounds dost know,
And say'st, when we forsake thee, 'Let them go!'
Thou easy-hearted Thing, with thy wild race
Of weeds and flowers, till we return be slow,
And travel with the year at a soft pace.

Help us to tell Her tales of years gone by,
And this sweet spring, the best beloved and best; 
Joy will be flown in its mortality;
Something must stay to tell us of the rest.
Here, thronged with primroses, the steep rock's breast
Glittered at evening like a starry sky;
And in this bush our sparrow built her nest,
Of which I sang one song that will not die.

O happy Garden! whose seclusion deep
Hath been so friendly to industrious hours;
And to soft slumbers, that did gently steep
Our spirits, carrying with them dreams of flowers, 
And wild notes warbled among leafy bowers;
Two burning months let summer overleap,
And, coming back with Her who will be ours,
Into thy bosom we again shall creep. The perfect hour;
That the winged joy, sweet honey-loving rover,
Flits from the flower.

Grieve not,—it is the law. Love will be flying— 
Yea, love and all.
Glad was the living; blessed be the dying!
Let the leaves fall. 


I

My fairest child, I have no song to give you; 
No lark could pipe to skies so dull and grey: 
Yet, ere we part, one lesson I can leave you 
For every day. 

II 

Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever; 
Do noble things, not dream them, all day long: 
And so make life, death, and that vast for-ever 
One grand, sweet song. 

Blasting the malachites beneath the rudder,
The seething sea spews pearly blobs of foam.
The shore sails nearer as we move from under
The ship's smooth, towering shape and make for home.

The pier is empty. Pigeons coo and chatter
And peck at corn and scraps of food- At sea,
The ship's stern sways, the bowsprit draws a pattern
Upon the dimming sky's dark canopy.

Where now? March. Dusk. In port, the church bells ringing.
Of spring and sadness full this soul of mine.
Lights at the inn- No, home I'll go, I'm thinking!
For I am drunk - drunk though I've touched no wine. 

With all my will, but much against my heart, 
We two now part. 
My Very Dear, 
Our solace is, the sad road lies so clear. 
It needs no art,
With faint, averted feet 
And many a tear, 
In our opposed paths to persevere. 
Go thou to East, I West. 
We will not say 
There 's any hope, it is so far away. 
But, O, my Best, 
When the one darling of our widowhead, 
The nursling Grief, 
Is dead, 
And no dews blur our eyes 
To see the peach-bloom come in evening skies, 
Perchance we may, 
Where now this night is day, 
And even through faith of still averted feet, 
Making full circle of our banishment, 
Amazed meet; 
The bitter journey to the bourne so sweet 
Seasoning the termless feast of our content 
With tears of recognition never dry. 

I worked so long in the shadow of Bob Menzies, 
that I was surprised when he did step down.
After a caucus vote, I stepped up to become
the seventeenth Prime Minister of Australia.
I knew I was certainly ready for the top job.
At Immigration, I changed 'White Australia'.
As Treasurer, I knew all about the high notes, 
and balanced the budget in decimal currency.
As Prime Minister, I sponsored a referendum 
that recognized the Aboriginal people as citizens, 
giving them the census, the vote and equal rights
I kept unemployment down, while wages went up.
I travelled the world more than ever before.
In Washington I said, 'All the way with LBJ', 
when I sent our troops to that futile war in Vietnam.
In London, I criticized neutral countries.
My popularity was soaring in the opinion polls; 
the Liberals won the election on a roll, 
so that I no longer felt lonely and insecure.



It was late in that the tide turned.
My party lost seats in the Senate to Labor.
I was blamed for the loss, high inflation 
and retaining under-achieving cabinet ministers.
Why not? I was a conservative by instinct after all.
No, I was not ruthless with dismissals, like Menzies..
Why did I allow a second inquiry into the 'Voyager? ' 
I was eventually proved right about that sinking. 
Then the doctor diagnosed the depression I dreaded,   
but carefully concealed  behind a ready smile. 


It was a Sunday morning in mid-December that I drove
with friends from my Portsea home  to Point Nepean, 
Port Phillip Bay, to see a round-the-world yacht race.
At noon, we drove on to the secluded Cheviot Beach, 
which was well-known for its high waves and  rip currents.
I decided to swim there, with a shoulder injury, 
although my friends begged me not to risk it.
I waded into the shallows, then swam into the deep, 
letting the current decide my fate, not sure
if I even wanted to return to the far-off shore.
I was alone in the water I had always loved
and when I saw high waves about to embrace me, 
I knew it was all over.



When I entered in you, I know not? 
When and how you accepted me, I know not? 
But what I know for certain is we became one
Inseparable, indispensable and essential to live.

Now when you have grown old and weak
I am still young 
With few bubbly thoughts, Unfulfilled 
I may leave you anytime
Should you be prepared
To go back to dust 
From where you emerged
I cannot accompany you
For your final journey
A journey which you have to take all alone
So be prepared, 
People will come to see you off
But nobody will remain with you to talk
They will respect you, they will remember you
But they will never be your buddy

Together we lived but you will die alone
We shared good and bad days together
This togetherness will not last for long
I cannot live with you forever and ever
I will be commanded to enter a new body soon
I know not how that will be
All your accounts will be revealed
When time will come you will see
We will meet one last time when 
I shall enter you on Almighty’s command
Till then take good rest
Inside your grave 
And taste the good or bad 
Everything will be paid


No reference will work, no preferences will be honored
I kept reminding you what is right and what is wrong
The result will be out as soon as you reach your grave
So taste the fruits of your own medicines.
I wish you happy journey all alone 
from now onwards, till we meet again 
just lay down quite 
and see the scenes of your life


HOME of the gifted! fare thee well, 
  And a blessing on thee rest; 
While the heather waves its purple bell 
  O'er moor and mountain crest; 
While stream to stream around thee calls, 
  And braes with broom are drest, 
Glad be the harping in thy halls- 
  A blessing on thee rest.

While the high voice from thee sent forth 
  Bids rock and cairn reply, 
Wakening the spirits of the North, 
  Like a chieftan's gathering cry; 
While its deep master-tones hold sway 
  As a king's o'er every breast, 
Home of the Legend and the Lay! 
  A blessing on thee rest!

Joy to thy hearth, and board, and bower! 
  Long honours to thy line! 
And hearts of proof, and hands of power, 
  And bright names worthy thine! 
By the merry step of childhood, still 
  May thy free sward be prest! 
-While one proud pulse in the land can thrill, 
  A blessing on thee rest


How the mountains talked together,
          Looking down upon the weather,
          When they heard our friend had planned his
          Little trip among the Andes
          How they'll bare their snowy scalps
          To the climber of the Alps
          When the cry goes through their passes,
          "Here comes the great Agassiz!"
          "Yes, I'm tall," says Chimborazo,
          "But I wait for him to say so,--
          That's the only thing that lacks,-- he
          Must see me, Cotopaxi!"
          "Ay! ay!" the fire-peak thunders,
          "And he must view my wonders
          I'm but a lonely crater
          Till I have him for spectator!"
          The mountain hearts are yearning,
          The lava-torches burning,
          The rivers bend to meet him,
          The forests bow to greet him,
          It thrills the spinal column
          Of fossil fishes solemn,
          And glaciers crawl the faster
          To the feet of their old master!
          Heaven keep him well and hearty,
          Both him and all his party!
          From the sun that broils and smites,
          From the centipede that bites,
          From the hail-storm and the thunder,
          From the vampire and the condor,
          From the gust upon the river,
          From the sudden earthquake shiver,
          From the trip of mule or donkey,
          From the midnight howling monkey,
          From the stroke of knife or dagger,
          From the puma and the jaguar,
          From the horrid boa-constrictor
          That has scared us in the picture,
          From the Indians of the Pampas
          Who would dine upon their grampas,
          From every beast and vermin
          That to think of sets us squirmin',
          From every snake that tries on
          The traveller his p'ison,
          From every pest of Natur',
          Likewise the alligator,
          And from two things left behind him,
          (Be sure they'll try to find him,)
          The tax-bill and assessor,--
          Heaven keep the great Professor!
          May he find, with his apostles,
          That the land is full of fossils,
          That the waters swarm with fishes
          Shaped according to his wishes,
          That every pool is fertile
          In fancy kinds of turtle,
          New birds around him singing,
          New insects, never stinging,
          With a million novel data
          About the articulata,
          And facts that strip off all husks
          From the history of mollusks.

          And when, with loud Te Deum,
          He returns to his Museum
          May he find the monstrous reptile
          That so long the land has kept ill
          By Grant and Sherman throttled,
          And by Father Abraham bottled,
          (All specked and streaked and mottled
          With the scars of murderous battles,
          Where he clashed the iron rattles
          That gods and men he shook at,)
          For all the world to look at!
          Bless him and all his band,
          On the sea and on the land,
          Bless them head and heart and hand,
          Till their glorious raid is o'er,
          And they touch our ransomed shore!
          Then the welcome of a nation,
          With its shout of exultation,
          Shall awake the dumb creation,
          And the shapes of buried aeons
          Join the living creature's paeans,
          Till the fossil echoes roar;
          While the mighty megalosaurus
          Leads the palaeozoic chorus,
          And the land his proud possessor,--
          Bless them now and evermore


I.
ADIEU, New-England's smiling meads,
    Adieu, the flow'ry plain:
I leave thine op'ning charms, O spring,
    And tempt the roaring main.

               II.
In vain for me the flow'rets rise,
    And boast their gaudy pride,
While here beneath the northern skies
    I mourn for health deny'd.

               III.
Celestial maid of rosy hue,
    O let me feel thy reign! 
I languish till thy face I view,
    Thy vanish'd joys regain.

               IV.
Susanna mourns, nor can I bear
    To see the crystal show'r,
Or mark the tender falling tear
    At sad departure's hour; 

               V.
Not unregarding can I see
    Her soul with grief opprest:
But let no sighs, no groans for me,
    Steal from her pensive breast.

               VI.
In vain the feather'd warblers sing,
    In vain the garden blooms,
And on the bosom of the spring
    Breathes out her sweet perfumes.

               VII.
While for Britannia's distant shore
    We sweep the liquid plain,
And with astonish'd eyes explore
    The wide-extended main.

               VIII.
Lo! Health appears! celestial dame! 
    Complacent and serene,
With Hebe's mantle o'er her Frame,
    With soul-delighting mein.

               IX.
To mark the vale where London lies
    With misty vapours crown'd,
Which cloud Aurora's thousand dyes,
    And veil her charms around.

               X.
Why, Phoebus, moves thy car so slow? 
    So slow thy rising ray? 
Give us the famous town to view,
    Thou glorious king of day! 


               XI.
For thee, Britannia, I resign
    New-England's smiling fields; 
To view again her charms divine,
    What joy the prospect yields! 

               XII.
But thou!  Temptation hence away,
    With all thy fatal train,
Nor once seduce my soul away,
    By thine enchanting strain.

               XIII.
Thrice happy they, whose heav'nly shield
    Secures their souls from harms,
And fell Temptation on the field
    Of all its pow'r disarms


We cannot, must not, judge your act.
We didn't share your pain.
You've left this life on your own terms-
How many wish the same? 
We weep for that which might have been; 
a happy heart and home.
When that proved to be impossible, 
the choice was yours alone.
For those of us who linger here
In doubt and groundless fears, 
We respect your heart's decision
and the life within your years.

My fairest child, I have no song to give you; 
No lark could pipe in skies so dull and gray; 
Yet, if you will, one quiet hint I'll leave you, 
For every day. 

I'll tell you how to sing a clearer carol 
Than lark who hails the dawn or breezy down; 
To earn yourself a purer poet's laurel 
Than Shakespeare's crown. 

Be good, sweet maid, and let who can be clever; 
Do lovely things, not dream them, all day long; 
And so make Life, and Death, and that For Ever, 
One grand sweet song. 

Farewell, false love, the oracle of lies, 
A mortal foe and enemy to rest, 
An envious boy, from whom all cares arise, 
A bastard vile, a beast with rage possessed, 
A way of error, a temple full of treason, 
In all effects contrary unto reason. 

A poisoned serpent covered all with flowers, 
Mother of sighs, and murderer of repose, 
A sea of sorrows whence are drawn such showers 
As moisture lend to every grief that grows; 
A school of guile, a net of deep deceit, 
A gilded hook that holds a poisoned bait. 

A fortress foiled, which reason did defend, 
A siren song, a fever of the mind, 
A maze wherein affection finds no end, 
A raging cloud that runs before the wind, 
A substance like the shadow of the sun, 
A goal of grief for which the wisest run. 

A quenchless fire, a nurse of trembling fear, 
A path that leads to peril and mishap, 
A true retreat of sorrow and despair, 
An idle boy that sleeps in pleasure's lap, 
A deep mistrust of that which certain seems, 
A hope of that which reason doubtful deems. 

Sith then thy trains my younger years betrayed,
And for my faith ingratitude I find; 
And sith repentance hath my wrongs bewrayed,
Whose course was ever contrary to kind:
False love, desire, and beauty frail, adieu. 
Dead is the root whence all these fancies grew. 


Come on, come on 
Join the party
Mingle with our fools
A farewell to your bloody rules.

Colourful dressings and settings
Personal emotions and conflicts
Smiles and cries
We miss you, please forget us.

Calling for a presence of masters
Insulting them before some idiots
Bloody minds and capabilities
Fit for nothing, nothing in reality.

Sweet hearts miss you all
A farewell to you all
Out of all from idiots
We respect you with heart.

Deadly talks in walks
Greeting and wishes on surface
Curse and slaps in depth
We know you are ready to fight.

We miss you one and all
Name sake our love and all
Its a farewell to you fools
We mean farewell to idiots
Get lost and we begg
Never come back. 


Since yesterday had to throw me and bolt,
Today has hurt my heart even more.
The autumn wild geese have a long wind for escort
As I face them from this villa, drinking my wine.
The bones of great writers are your brushes, in the School of Heaven,
And I am a Lesser Xie growing up by your side.
We both are exalted to distant thought,
Aspiring to the sky and the bright moon.
But since water still flows, though we cut it with our swords,
And sorrows return, though we drown them with wine,
Since the world can in no way answer our craving,
I will loosen my hair tomorrow and take to a fishing boat. 


May the Babylonish curse
Straight confound my stammering verse,
If I can a passage see
In this word-perplexity,
Or a fit expression find,
Or a language to my mind,
(Still the phrase is wide or scant)
To take leave of thee, great plant!
Or in any terms relate
Half my love, or half my hate:
For I hate, yet love, thee so,
That, whichever thing I shew,
The plain truth will seem to be
A constrain'd hyperbole,
And the passion to proceed
More from a mistress than a weed.


Sooty retainer to the vine,
Bacchus' black servant, negro fine;
Sorcerer, that mak'st us dote upon
Thy begrimed complexion,
And, for thy pernicious sake,
More and greater oaths to break
Than reclaimed lovers take
'Gainst women: thou thy siege dost lay
Much too in the female way,
While thou suck'st the lab'ring breath
Faster than kisses or than death.


Thou in such a cloud dost bind us,
That our worst foes cannot find us,
And ill fortune, that would thwart us,
Shoots at rovers, shooting at us;
While each man, thro' thy height'ning steam,
Does like a smoking Etna seem,
And all about us does express
(Fancy and wit in richest dress)
A Sicilian fruitfulness.


Thou through such a mist dost shew us,
That our best friends do not know us,
And, for those allowed features,
Due to reasonable creatures,
Liken'st us to fell Chimeras,
Monsters that, who see us, fear us;
Worse than Cerberus or Geryon,
Or, who first lov'd a cloud, Ixion.


Bacchus we know, and we allow
His tipsy rites. But what art thou,
That but by reflex canst shew
What his deity can do,
As the false Egyptian spell
Aped the true Hebrew miracle?
Some few vapours thou may'st raise,
The weak brain may serve to amaze,
But to the reins and nobler heart
Canst nor life nor heat impart.


Brother of Bacchus, later born,
The old world was sure forlorn,
Wanting thee, that aidest more
The god's victories than before
All his panthers, and the brawls
Of his piping Bacchanals.
These, as stale, we disallow,
Or judge of thee meant: only thou
His true Indian conquest art;
And, for ivy round his dart,
The reformed god now weaves
A finer thyrsus of thy leaves.


Scent to match thy rich perfume
Chemic art did ne'er presume
Through her quaint alembic strain,
None so sov'reign to the brain.
Nature, that did in thee excel,
Fram'd again no second smell.
Roses, violets, but toys
For the smaller sort of boys,
Or for greener damsels meant;
Thou art the only manly scent.



Stinking'st of the stinking kind,
Filth of the mouth and fog of the mind,
Africa, that brags her foyson,
Breeds no such prodigious poison,
Henbane, nightshade, both together,
Hemlock, aconite ---


Nay, rather,
Plant divine, of rarest virtue;
Blisters on the tongue would hurt you.
'Twas but in a sort I blam'd thee;
None e'er prosper'd who defam'd thee;
Irony all, and feign'd abuse,
Such as perplext lovers use,
At a need, when, in despair
To paint forth their fairest fair,
Or in part but to express
That exceeding comeliness
Which their fancies doth so strike,
They borrow language of dislike;
And, instead of Dearest Miss,
Jewel, Honey, Sweetheart, Bliss,
And those forms of old admiring,
Call her Cockatrice and Siren,
Basilisk, and all that's evil,
Witch, Hyena, Mermaid, Devil,
Ethiop, Wench, and Blackamoor,
Monkey, Ape, and twenty more;
Friendly Trait'ress, loving Foe,-
Not that she is truly so,
But no other way they know
A contentment to express,
Borders so upon excess,
That they do not rightly wot
Whether it be pain or not.


Or, as men, constrain'd to part
With what's nearest to their heart,
While their sorrow's at the height,
Lose discrimination quite,
And their hasty wrath let fall,
To appease their frantic gall,
On the darling thing whatever,
Whence they feel it death to sever,
Though it be, as they, perforce,
Guiltless of the sad divorce.


For I must (nor let it grieve thee,
Friendliest of plants, that I must) leave thee.
For thy sake, tobacco, I
Would do any thing but die,
And but seek to extend my days
Long enough to sing thy praise.
But, as she, who once hath been
Ever after, nor will bate
Any tittle of her state,
Though a widow, or divorced,
So I, from thy converse forced,
The old name and style retain,
A right Katherine of Spain;
And a seat, too, 'mongst the joys
Of the blest Tobacco Boys;
Where, though I, by sour physician,
Am debarr'd the full fruition
Of thy favours, I may catch
Some collateral sweets, and snatch
Sidelong odours, that give life
Like glances from a neighbour's wife;
And still live in the by-places
And the suburbs of thy graces;
And in thy borders take delight,
An unconquer'd Canaanite. 

I know a little country place
Where still my heart doth linger,
And o'er its fields is every grace
Lined out by memory's finger.
Back from the lane where poplars grew
And aspens quake and quiver,
There stands all bath'd in summer's glow
A farm house by the river.

Its eaves are touched with golden light
So sweetly, softly shining,
And morning glories full and bright
About the doors are twining.
And there endowed with every grace
That nature's hand could giver her,
There lived the angel of the place
In the farm house by the river.

Her eyes were blue, her hair was gold,
Her face was bright and sunny;
The songs that from her bosom rolled
Were sweet as summer's honey.
And I loved her well, that maid divine,
And I prayed the Gracious Giver,
That I some day might call her mine
In the farm house by the river.

His will for aye be heeded!
Perhaps amid the angels' bliss,
My little love was needed.
Her spirit from its thralldom torn
Went singing o'er the river,
And that sweet life my heart shall mourn
Forever and forever.

She dies one morn at early light
When all the birds are singing,
And Heaven itself in pure delight
Its bells of joy seemed ringing.
They laid her dust where soon and late
The solemn grasses quiver,
And left alone and desolate
The farm house by the river. 


THROUGH the ample open door of the peaceful country barn,
   A sun-lit pasture field, with cattle and horses feeding;
   And haze, and vista, and the far horizon, fading away. 


The year stood at its equinox
And bluff the North was blowing,
A bleat of lambs came from the flocks,
Green hardy things were growing;
I met a maid with shining locks
Where milky kine were lowing.

She wore a kerchief on her neck,
Her bare arm showed its dimple,
Her apron spread without a speck,
Her air was frank and simple. 

She milked into a wooden pail
And sang a country ditty,
An innocent fond lovers' tale,
That was not wise nor witty,
Pathetically rustical,
Too pointless for the city.

She kept in time without a beat
As true as church-bell ringers,
Unless she tapped time with her feet,
Or squeezed it with her fingers; 
Her clear unstudied notes were sweet
As many a practised singer's.

I stood a minute out of sight,
Stood silent for a minute
To eye the pail, and creamy white
The frothing milk within it;

To eye the comely milking maid
Herself so fresh and creamy:
'Good day to you,' at last I said;
She turned her head to see me: 
'Good day,' she said with lifted head;
Her eyes looked soft and dreamy,

And all the while she milked and milked
The grave cow heavy-laden:
I've seen grand ladies plumed and silked,
But not a sweeter maiden;

But not a sweeter fresher maid
Than this in homely cotton,
Whose pleasant face and silky braid
I have not yet forgotten. 


Seven springs have passed since then, as I
Count with a sober sorrow;
Seven springs have come and passed me by,
And spring sets in to-morrow.

I've half a mind to shake myself
Free just for once from London,
To set my work upon the shelf
And leave it done or undone;

To run down by the early train,
Whirl down with shriek and whistle, 
And feel the bluff North blow again,
And mark the sprouting thistle
Set up on waste patch of the lane
Its green and tender bristle.


And spy the scarce-blown violet banks,
Crisp primrose leaves and others,
And watch the lambs leap at their pranks
And butt their patient mothers.

Alas, one point in all my plan
My serious thoughts demur to: 
Seven years have passed for maid and man,
Seven years have passed for her too;

Perhaps my rose is overblown,
Not rosy or too rosy;
Perhaps in farmhouse of her own
Some husband keeps her cosy,
Where I should show a face unknown.
Good-bye, my wayside posy. 

Clad in shabby dress, stinks sweat, 
A churlish who works day and night
In the field, 
To speed up the pace of progress, 
To continue the game of politics, 
The destiny of kingdoms
Lies on his rough palms, 
By dint of his being, 
The kings are kings and
He is the father of civilization. 

With just a handful of barren land, 
And tottering dreams based on the sand. 
Yet the desire continued to bloom, 
To produce the green out of the doom. 

No frill now, can satiate his needs. 
A tinge of grass is for all he pleads. 
Extracting life out of nature's legacy 
So small is that farmer's fantasy.   

I’d love to be an archaeologist, 
and dig up a real good find.
A skeleton or two would frankly do, 
each one of a human kind.

Some pottery, and tiles of mosaic, 
jewellery that women wore, 
back through stages, in far distant ages.
Even a dinosaur’s jaw.

There were Romans, Saxons, and Vikings, 
who all roamed over our land.
With their pleasures, they must leave some treasures, 
to be uncovered by hand.

Hours of gentle light digging and scraping, 
at soil to reveal a prize.
A coin, some flax, buckle of bronze, flint axe, 
can make one’s excitement rise.

Our history is found under our feet, 
we walk upon it each day.
A fascinating state, to excavate, 
this earth, this brown mud, this clay.


All summer long, had listened to the wooing
Of amorous brids that flew across the hedge, 
Singing their blithe sweet songs for her undoing.
So many were the flattering things they told her, 
The parent tree seemed quite too small to hold her.

At last one lonesome day she saw them fly
Across the fields behind the coquette summer, 
They passed her with a laughing light good-bye, 
When from the north, there strode a strange new comer; 
Bold was his mien, as he gazed on her, crying, 
'How comes it, then, that thou art left here sighing! '

'Now by my faith though art a lovely leaf-
May I not kiss that cheek so fair and tender? '
Her slighted heart welled full of bitter grief, 
The rudeness of his words did not offend her, 
She felt so sad, so desolate, so deserted, 
Oh, if her lonely fate might be averted.

'One little kiss, ' he sighed, 'I ask no more-'
His face was cold, his lips too pale for passion.
She smiled assent; and then bold Frost leaned lower, 
And clasped her close, and kissed in lover's fashion.
Her smooth cheek flushed to sudden guilty splendour, 
Another kiss, and then sweet surrender.

Just for a day she was a beauteous sight, 
The world looked on to pity and admire
This modest little leaf, that in a night
Had seemed to set the forest all on fire.
And then - this victim of a broken trust, 
A withered thing, was trodden in the dust. 


A tear silently falls
Glistening with Fear.
As night approaches.
Within the Mirror.

Inside this doubtful world, 
The day of tomorrow
Is only but a routine
Filled with screams of sorrow.

If I cry out to you
I will be silenced.
Three warnings I recieve
Before he erupts into violence.

I smile at his ugly face
Pretending to be thrilled, 
At what he has given me, 
A life of fearful chills.

I do as I am told
If not, blood I will see.
A hand upon my mouth
He will never let me be.

I gag and choke on blood.
Once again I've made a mistake.
But will he be nice today? 
How much more can I take? 

Into another world I go.
Isolated, Cold, and Alone.
He calmly talks to me
In an un-nerving frightful tone.

He has taken me far away
There is no one to help.
He smiles as he comes near.
And the deck's cards have been delt. 

A mirror stands against my back.
And I reach behind towards the glass.
No one should have to see this. 
I hope it will shatter and crash.

Can you not see me? 
Nor hear my cries of plea? 
Help me out of this dark world.
Please, just let me be free.

As you take a look at me.
From your world into mine.
Please remember what happened here.
And know death can sometimes be kind.

A World of Hate is Horrid.
A World of Perfection Ideal.
Dreams are premonitions.
And Violence very Real.


My Father's words are my legacy
He gave the pen of ardent writing.
The love for books and careful study, 
And wealth of knowledge gained by reading.

The gift of painting self portraits
In oil and watercolor mediums
As artist he had various traits
That lingers now like sweet perfume.

He taught me best the gift of laughter, 
Sincerity in friendships made, 
In conflict silence is much greater
And cursing he always forbade.

'Strive to gain sound education
Value work and your family
Respect the race of any nation
Live well your life with integrity.'

He never schooled at parenting
And he may not be a perfect one
Through all mistakes and human failings
He lived this life an honest man.

He passed the torch and made life rich
By leaving me with all these lessons
Though in my heart I suffer grief
His love and memory will live on.

With love and thanks - goodbye! 
You've made the mark and passed your test
And now with angels you can fly.



'And after my skin has been destroyed, 
                      (Job) 



The love that I see in your father’s eyes
The smile on his face as he talks with you
How the sound of your voice lights up his life
Every time he is on the phone with you
Never doubt this special love he has 
I see a father who adores his daughter
It’s a very special kind of bond you share
And you are a very special daughter


Consummate pain
Like a cruel wrench
Gripped his heart
And crushed, it bled
A father's tears.

No words define
His anguished grief
A wretched loss
His own son. 
His seed.

The baby he carried 
In his arms
And nurtured
In paternal love
Now broken, scarred
A shriveled man
His father's eyes 
Now bleed.

He would take him back
To be his child
Return him safely
To his past
No war could touch him 
Hidden there
His eyes see through 
An hourglass.

My boy, my son! 
What have they done? 
Your life a mangled mess
What's left to do? 
These father's tears
Will not replace
The boy, the man
That I once knew! 





River flowing with splattering noise, 
ploughmen working in the sugarcane 
fields with rustling sounds of their leaves, 

crushed cane juice flowing with bubbling noise, 
the whistling sounds from the mouth of the 
small shells drifted from the sea into the land, 

great noise due to the rubbing of horns
due to bulls fight, sounds while the buffalo
jumps splashing into the shallow water, 
 
many such different pleasant noises, mingled 
with each other, offer a feeling of  euphoria, 
the land of fertile fields of Kosala Kingdom


The sound of raindrops
Ripples from ear to ear
The water uncovers a hidden treasure
A small red rose bud danced 
On the swing of air 

The breeze softly touched 
The tender skin of my love
The heat muted and remained
Inside the shells of the desires
Calmly paving way for love to blossom

Rays clings to my skin  
Making it wet and salty like teardrops
I rested my head on the lap of my love
And closed my eyes to feel the droplets of water 
Dripping from her silky hairs

My heart starts to pound out of my chest
And with a bang sound everything stopped
I no longer hear the pounding sound of rain
Nature has returned the peace
The blue, cyan sky returned

The sun rays were hitting the leaves
And the droplets started to reflect the colours
I felt soaked, as if had just taken a shower
I stood up to stretch my arms towards the heavens
The storm was over, but our Love remained. 


i as a man
remain tender even
when
i am born
as a man
when i grow even
into a man
in body and soul
even when  i am grown as a man
it's only my body that's masculine
my soul still remains feminine


With sounds of happiness the deer
Browse on the celery of the meads.
A nobler feast is furnished here,
With guests renowned for noble deeds.
The lutes are struck; the organ blows,
Till all its tongues in movement heave.
Each basket loaded stands, and shows
The precious gifts the guests receive.
They love me and my mind will teach,
How duty's highest aim to reach.

With sounds of happiness the deer
The southern-wood crop in the meads,
What noble guests surround me here,
Distinguished for their worthy deeds!
From them my people learn to fly
Whate'er is mean; to chiefs they give
A model and a pattern high;--
They show the life they ought to live.
Then fill their cups with spirits rare,
Till each the banquet's joy shall share.


With sounds of happiness the deer
The salsola crop in the fields.
What noble guests surround me here!
Each lute for them its music yields.
Sound, sound the lutes, or great or small.
The joy harmonious to prolong;--

And with my spirits rich crown all
The cups to cheer the festive throng.
Let each retire with gladdened heart,
In his own sphere to play his part. 


On dashed my four steeds, without halt, without stay,
Though toilsome and winding from Chow was the way.
I wished to return--but the monarch's command
Forbade that his business be done with slack hand;
And my heart was with sadness oppressed.

On dashed my four steeds; I ne'er slackened the reins.
They snorted and panted--all white, with black manes.
I wished to return, but our sovereign's command
Forbade that his business be done with slack hand;--
And I dared not to pause or to rest.

Unresting the Filial doves speed in their flight,
Ascending, then sweeping swift down from the height,
Now grouped on the oaks. The king's high command
Forbade that his business be done with slack hand;--
And my father I left, sore distressed.

Unresting the Filial doves speed in their flight,
Now fanning the air and anon they alight
On the medlars thick grouped. But our monarch's command
Forbade that his business be done with slack hand;--
Of my mother I thought with sad breast.

My four steeds I harnessed, all white and black-maned,
Which straight on their way, fleet and emulous strained.
I wished to return; and now venture in song
The wish to express, and announce how I long
For my mother my care to attest. 


Oh do not die, for I shall hate
All women so, when thou art gone,
That thee I shall not celebrate,
When I remember, thou wast one.

But yet thou canst not die, I know;
To leave this world behind, is death,
But when thou from this world wilt go,
The whole world vapours with thy breath.

Or if, when thou, the world’s soul, go`st,
It stay, ’tis but thy carcase then,
The fairest woman, but thy ghost,
But corrupt worms, the worthiest men.

Oh wrangling schools, that search what fire
Shall burn this world, had none the wit
Unto this knowledge to aspire,
That this her fever might be it ?

And yet she cannot waste by this, 
Nor long bear this torturing wrong,
For much corruption needful is
To fuel such a fever long.

These burning fits but meteors be,
Whose matter in thee is soon spent.
Thy beauty, and all parts, which are thee,
Are unchangeable firmament.

Yet ’twas of my mind, seizing thee,
Though it in thee cannot persever.
For I had rather owner be
Of thee one hour, than all else ever. 


Bound by earth and sky
The particles of darkness
Of my existence
Got crystallized into
Fertile dew-drops.

The thin clouds
Of scattered dew-drops
In the womb of an
Unfathomable vacuum
Assembled in ones and twos
Over my semi-bald head, 
Promising a heavy downpour
On the pale leaves of grass at my feet, 
During an autumnal twilight.

I was really amused to perceive
How those mere dew-drops
Could regenerate
So much greenery
Here, there, everywhere
And even on my bald- head.

At a distant horizon
On the dark boughs
Of a parched gulmohar tree
Red petals appeared
And singing birds perched
And surprisingly I could hold 
The fragrance of thin hairs
Grown around her nape
With a solid passion, 
Singing nursery-rhymes
To utmost perfection.


In the empty corridors of my ribs
Broken desires and disabled opportunities
Raised their wrinkled scalps
For a few drops of dew.

I really marvelled
At the sight of those dew-drops
Of such multiple colours
Creating a cascading effect
In their beauty and significance
Which I adored
And many a time imbibed.

But, alas!  I didn’t know
Such ethereal dew-drops
Could feel so insecure
Merely at the sight
Of a pregnant eastern sky. 



A FEW KIND WORDS 

A few kind words 
From a stranger far away
Than I can by myself make. 

Poem of the evening 
Little lines 
Go forth into the hearts and minds 
Of those kind readers 
Who care. 


Let us spend a few moments together, 
the holidays won’t last for ever, 
the promises we made to finish up the house chores, 
will be our New Year's resolution for the next year.

Let us spend a few moments together, 
let us feel each others pains together, 
let us look in each others eyes, 
let us rediscover the lost love in our hearts.

Let us spend a few moments together, 
our long relationship has made our dreams stale, 
let us share the soft touch of red roses of our love, 
let us walk hand in hand together adoring the surf on the beach.

Let us spend a few moments together, 
let us not worry about driving to popular places and beating the crowds, 
let us sit close together and look at the stars in night skies, 
let us really relive this life together.>
there's still a few old men
who can shoe a horse, 
plow with a mule

build their own house, 
hunt for their food, 
and grow the rest


talk to you about books
no one reads anymore
sharpen a knife, bait a hook, 

teach a boy to be a man. 
and a girl that she's loved.
work all day and love all night

string their own guitar. 
treat a woman with respect
stand beside you through

both good and bad. 
what you gonna do when
 all the old men are gone

The room where a young boy 
beheld toy soldiers' bedspread battles, 
great legions clashing in still air —


Where later Mother surprised him as he dressed, 
her yellow eyes as sharp as hawks'.

A few years later, 
a room with a love-seat, 
a shy, first kiss.

Passion's frenzied grasping
on a bed that filled a tiny room
a few years after that

then, an upstate New York 
farmhouse bedroom —
pounding on the floor to try
to make the LSD turn off.

After a lost year, a room
a pinkish Ocean, 
washing all my memories clean. 

Babies must not eat the coal
And they must not make grimaces,
Nor in party dresses roll
And must never black their faces.

They must learn that pointing's rude,
They must sit quite still at table,
And must always eat the food
Put before them--if they're able.

If they fall, they must not cry,
Though it's known how painful this is;
No--there's always Mother by
Who will comfort them with kisses. 


A few words
Could bring more than a sound
Touch the ears turn wry to golden smile
or sharper than a glass to cut into pieces

Misunderstanding, 
Winding up a road between us
Separating emotions out of mind from the case
Would be wrong to let ego reign the grace
How ignorant sometimes heart could be? 
Deaf two ears, and blinding opened eyes
Pretend the silence is your voice
Avoiding you is not a choice

Misunderstanding
A curse of few words
Lead a way to stray from the truth
A plead for apologizing replied by ignoring
A few words used for fighting and shouting and hurting
You.  .   

Silence
Standing still but beautifully broken 
I looked into your eyes and surprised
In a mirror of a story without lies
Heard.  

listened a word. 

'sorry'
Encodes a meaning of 'Forgive me'
No, your lips tightly sealed
It is your voice within sent to me

A few words
I used as the sharp glass tease
Cut you deeply, and you bleed
Saw it all behind the naked eyes
But you still standing to hold me
Never mind how wrong i can be
How i can find a magic in a few words
To heal your pain stained and clot
Regretting how wrong i did to you
To believe unreal and count your tears
I never thought so hurtful this way
When i thinking of myself it linking to you
I hurting myself whenever i hurt you

A few words
I tried to search for proper sorry
Would you blind your eyes, deaf two ears? 
Words crime sound nothing but now i fear? 
It fears me as i don't to lose you
.  

Forget the past and start a new
we never meant to be hurt. 
You replied with A few words
In form of softness creating golden smile
Your sweet words neutralize the voice of bile
I learned how to speak when i was a child
But just understanding 'A few words' now

Misunderstanding
Lesson of learning to understand
If i can turn back each time i hurt you
Will avoid this bruises stamp on you
Now, between this winding road
As i standing at the aisle of choices
Picking either Emotions or Mind
Decided to fuse, balance these two
A relevant choice for not to hurt you
Sanity tell all to me, 
We meet not to wait this end
We born to be happy till the end of time


A few words
Powerful or hurtful
Time to choose. 

The twisted story just for a write to point what
words can do.. 

for me it's better silent than let
people hurt by our words, unless we make say it better


And I began to take hope again
I have always pretended it did not matter
But like everyone else
The approval and admiration and love of others
Is what I really strive for. 

We have a soul at times.
No one’s got it non-stop,
for keeps.

Day after day,
year after year
may pass without it.

Sometimes
it will settle for awhile
only in childhood’s fears and raptures.
Sometimes only in astonishment
that we are old.

It rarely lends a hand
in uphill tasks,
like moving furniture,
or lifting luggage,
or going miles in shoes that pinch.

It usually steps out
whenever meat needs chopping
or forms have to be filled.

For every thousand conversations
it participates in one,
if even that,
since it prefers silence.

Just when our body goes from ache to pain,
it slips off-duty.


It’s picky:
it doesn’t like seeing us in crowds,
our hustling for a dubious advantage
and creaky machinations make it sick.

Joy and sorrow
aren’t two different feelings for it.
It attends us
only when the two are joined.

We can count on it
when we’re sure of nothing
and curious about everything.

Among the material objects
it favors clocks with pendulums
and mirrors, which keep on working
even when no one is looking.

It won’t say where it comes from
or when it’s taking off again,
though it’s clearly expecting such questions.

We need it
but apparently
it needs us
for some reason too.



I must write a short poem ~
The cream of the crop.
But where should I start? 
Where should I stop? 
This is a problem haunting me
This is a hidden difficulty.
Anxiety enters as hours go by, 
Only a poet could understand why! 
'Short and sweet' is my desire, 
Never to ramble into the mire. 

Please don't take drugs
Because drugs will kill you
Please don't drink and drive


Poetry. 
She lures us in, 
As if with her beguiling grin
She captures hearts inclined to sin

Poetry. 
That lady fair
Displays a most defiant glare
When we attempt to leave her lair

Poetry. 
Makes us drunk with glee
But, she will never set us free
From that which we desire, but can never be

Poetry. 
Entices all
With her soul she does call
To those that she may soon enthral

Poetry. 
That fickle mistress
Causes hearts and souls distress
Because she fills that need.  

that humans do possess


Amang the trees, where humming bees, 
At buds and flowers were hinging, O, 
Auld Caledon drew out her drone, 
And to her pipe was singing, O: 
'Twas Pibroch, Sang, Strathspeys, and Reels, 
She dirl'd them aff fu' clearly, O: 
When there cam' a yell o' foreign squeels, 
That dang her tapsalteerie, O. 

Their capon craws an' queer "ha, ha's," 
They made our lugs grow eerie, O; 
The hungry bike did scrape and fyke, 
Till we were wae and weary, O: 
But a royal ghaist, wha ance was cas'd, 
A prisoner, aughteen year awa', 
He fir'd a Fiddler in the North, 
That dang them tapsalteerie, O. 

She comes to me in my dreams

A lace wrapped wraith with golden hair

She runs carelessly 

Through the mist shrouded  forest

of my dark unsettled sleep 

A dream, a dream 

And lost

I awake

And am left with the moist air

upon my bed

Damp and chilled I rise to my day

And all that is left

Is the memory of a dream


A field of cotton--
as if the moon
    had flowered.
 



Look at 
That girl
Sitting 
Alone
In the field of 
Damaged Roses.
Just look
She is a 
Beautiful
Disgrace.
Do you dare
To stare
At her? 
She is dying. 
Her life
Slipping away.
So she lays
In a field of
Damaged Roses.
Her 
Beautiful Nightmare
Coming to an end.
The sun sets
A 
Crimson moon rises
In it's place.
And this
Disturbed Angel
Lays. 
Dying
In the field of
Damaged Roses.  

When you are raised with trust and fear
you beleave in courage when it is near 
you learn to trust as days goes  by
but  learn  betrayed as  years  fly
its only then when you must learn
that life is cruel when you are not known
you must learn now what the meaning is 
the word survival, its what was preached.
they teached you how to love when you was young
but also not to quit on what you have learn 
for you are someone rather special 
this is a battle that someone lend you 
don't lean back and quit the game
you have to fight to gain respect
for you have no clue or have any idea
the so called game, might bring you fear
for this is not just a simple game 
this is reality going your way 
you must fight and trully beleave 
a fight for survival its what was preached.
for this is life or you learn it or you'll weep. 


A wonderful someone tall 
and lean 
Perhaps making the fairy
scene
Knocking on my door to
say 
I'm your man from far away
Honey lips like the melon
dew, 
A gentle spirit kind and 
true.
A giving heart a summer
day, 
Will it always be this way? 
Coming from somewhere 
across the sea, 
Or will this always an 
illusion be?

'Twas my purpose, on a day,
To embark, and sail away.
As I climbed the vessel's side,
Love was sporting in the tide;
'Come,' he said, 'ascend—make haste,
Launch into the boundless waste.'

Many mariners were there,
Having each his separate care;
They that rowed us held their eyes
Fixed upon the starry skies;
Others steered, or turned the sails,
To receive the shifting gales.

Love, with power divine supplied,
Suddenly my courage tried;
In a moment it was night,
Ship and skies were out of sight;
On the briny wave I lay,
Floating rushes all my stay.

Did I with resentment burn
At this unexpected turn?
Did I wish myself on shore,
Never to forsake it more?
No--'My soul,' I cried, 'be still;
If I must be lost, I will.'

Next he hastened to convey
Both my frail supports away;
Seized my rushes; bade the waves
Yawn into a thousand graves:
Down I went, and sunk as lead,
Ocean closing o'er my head.

Still, however, life was safe;
And I saw him turn and laugh:
'Friend,' he cried, 'adieu! lie low,
While the wintry storms shall blow;
When the spring has calmed the main,
You shall rise and float again.'

Soon I saw him, with dismay,
Spread his plumes, and soar away;
Now I mark his rapid flight;
Now he leaves my aching sight;
He is gone whom I adore,
'Tis in vain to seek him more.

How I trembled then and feared,
When my love had disappeared!
'Wilt thou leave me thus,' I cried,
'Whelmed beneath the rolling tide?'
Vain attempt to reach his ear!
Love was gone, and would not hear.

Ah! return, and love me still;
See me subject to thy will;
Frown with wrath, or smile with grace,
Only let me see thy face!
Evil I have none to fear,
All is good, if thou art near.

Yet he leaves me--cruel fate!
Leaves me in my lost estate--
Have I sinned? Oh, say wherein;
Tell me, and forgive my sin!
Shall I see thy face no more?

Be not angry; I resign,
Henceforth, all my will to thine:
I consent that thou depart,
Though thine absence breaks my heart;
Go then, and for ever too:
All is right that thou wilt do.

This was just what Love intended;
He was now no more offended;
Soon as I became a child,
Love returned to me and smiled:
Never strife shall more betide
'Twixt the bridegroom and his bride. 


Tears fall, they just won't end
It seems my aching heart will never mend.
Any joy inside quickly dies
As I realize soon you will depart from my side.
From this earth you cannot leave just yet
My mind then fills with lifelong regrets.
I need you to stay here with me
I hold your hand tight as I plea.
But soon embrace your peaceful expression
And realize your life could never be measured
With anything other than love so true
Love that touched all of whom you knew.
All the ones you loved so very dearly
And even the ones you met just briefly
Happiness and inspiration you always brought
Fairness and kindness you always sought.
And now as we sense your days coming to a close
Where you go from here we all know, 
The wonderful human He made perfectly.
In His arms He will hold you forever
In His arms fear will touch you never.
You will live in unending peace
As I imagine this, it becomes bittersweet.
Because I know you have completed the tasks 
No more will this world cause you pain
Soon we will be reunited once again.
Death is not easy, but a natural part of life
Just like love, happiness, trials, and strife.
I know over me your eyes will look down
And I will feel your love all around.
Sadness like joy will come and go
But the love I have for you will continue to grow.
Tears fall, they just won't end
But I know my aching heart will one day mend. 


They were indeed simple people
the people of the east
A FINE CULTURE they did have
the people of the east
 
A FINE CULTURE
the east should have given the rest
when the west brought out the 'machine'
the east brought out the 'human'
 
Today's world  is not lacking in machine
Today's world is lacking in human
 
Today's east is sending 'productive men' all over
the east should have sent 'human men' all over
How did the east stray? 
when did it loose it's way? 
 
The east then found everything in simplicity
simplicity was it's strength and beauty
simplicity gave the east it's integrity
simplicity never ever gave the east an inferiority

 
Today the east mocks the west
the 'material' wealth of the west.. 

has
put to rest.  

the 
true spirit of the east
 
We blame it on simplicity
we say we were plundered due to our simplicity
a handed down book on simplicity
only became a liability.. 

we say
 
What the west had gained
everybody did gain.  

the 'machine'
what the east had lost
everbody did loose.  

the 'human'
 
Today what are we in
an 'un human' man is managing a dangerous dumb 'machine'.  

and
THAT'S THE DANGER WE ARE IN.  

without
a fine culture


After all the rain, the sun
Shines on hill and grassy mead;
Fly into the garden, child,
You are very glad indeed.

For the days have been so dull,
Oh, so special dark and drear,
That you told me, "Mr. Sun
Has forgotten we live here


Dew upon the lily lawn,
Dew upon the garden beds;
Daintly from all the leaves
Pop the little primrose heads.

And the violets in the copse
With their parasols of green
Take a little peek at you;
They're the bluest you have seen.

On the lilac tree a bird
Singing first a little not,
Then a burst of happy song
Bubbles in his lifted throat.

O the sun, the comfy sun!
This the song that you must sing,
"Thank you for the birds, the flowers,
Thank you, sun, for everything


"she tells me what to do
even while I am
or plan to
or think I am

by now, I should and would know
what I want to do, 
if ever I sought advice
it is only her, I would seek

has she no faith, 
I know what to do, 
of course she has
but she knows better

how, what and when, to do
so when in need I'll ask, 
if she stopped telling me
what to do, 

I'd think she didn't care anymore, 
stiil it's often annoying 
being told what to do


My heart I place upon the line, 
Not knowing is the worst -
Have I the right to want for more, 
Or if I do, be cursed? 

To be content as in the past
Is safe in many ways -
Yet, I don't wish to settle now
And simply count my days; 

Instead I long to understand
This newness that you bring, 
I feel myself awakening
Like blossoms in the spring; 

So many things I've yet to learn, 
Perhaps that's why you're here -
I dare not interrupt your life
And yet I want you near; 

I have no right to make demands, 
For I am just your friend, 
But now that I'm aware of you, 
I cannot comprehend

My life without you in it -
Already I have changed, 
I never want to lose you now
That you have rearranged

My thoughts, and yes, my feelings
They will never be the same -
My peaceful world's turned upside down
And baby, you're to blame.

My heart I place upon that line, 
While I am contemplating
What's right for you - what should I do? 
Impatiently


I'm waiting.



in those days
as cavemen.. 

man feared
the rumble and tumble in the sky
the lightning and thunder
he thought was god's wrath
the god's are at war he would say
 
today they say
the lightning and thunder
the commotion up there
is a reflection of humans depression
it gathers from each small one
to make it big on the sky
 
whatever may be the truth is. 
the lovely rain after all this
definitely is his caress
a lovely hug from him it is
every tiny dropp of rain is his
fingers touch on me


What else is love an ecstasy that constrains
to forget the ethics, to put tomes on the shelf, 
a petition against dry ice of the brains, 
when the plaintiff becomes a justice himself, 
when the hearts write a new code of conduct, 
kill the bloody brain who is he to obstruct? 
What else is love the surrender to someone, 
a total blind submission no room is left, 
the senses are drunk and unite for the one, 
a thief himself who inspires for the theft, 
when the eyes regain see a fire rainbow, 
but how color blinds can enjoy this show? 
What else is love a cool and soothing fire, 
a mutiny of heart against the hating brains, 
the weapon of love the instinctive desire, 
sets aside all and keeps the lovely stains, 
the skies when steal this colorful verse, 
a rainbow rules, 

"Earth not yet adverse

"Right down the shocked street with a
                                              siren-blast
That sends all else skittering to the
                                                       curb,
Redness, brass, ladders and hats hurl
                                                       past,
     Blurring to sheer verb,

Shift at the corner into uproarious gear
And make it around the turn in a squall
                                              of traction,
The headlong bell maintaining sure and
                                                      clear,
     Thought is degraded action!

Beautiful, heavy, unweary, loud,
                                        obvious thing!
I stand here purged of nuance, my
                                          mind a blank.
All I was brooding upon has taken
                                                      wing,
     And I have you to thank.

As you howl beyond hearing I carry you
                                          into my mind,
Ladders and brass and all, there to
                                                    admire
Your phoenix-red simplicity, enshrined
     In that not extinguished fire.





Will stand strong like a house on a rock.
Through storms of life it will accord, 
A firm foundation,  strength it won't lack.

Those who say that they have 'faith'
But they believe because it feels good.
In this, they just try to speak and negate

One cannot aptly take up defense
Without a sword out there in the battle.
Active, alive, used in each struggle.

Words have a way of exposing the heart, 
What is inside it,  these we will impart, 
Our words bear the reality of our fruit.

A man would be sure to reap what he sows.
Let's speak what He said and not forfeit

I hope you enjoyed this sermon in rhyme, 
And I pray the His light shine on you.
Read His Word for you don't have much time-
Read it.


Entangled in my hair
Did not injure me;
My blenching and trembling,
Nothing but dissembling,
Nothing but coquetry.

I long for truth, and yet
I cannot stay from that
My better self disowns,
For a man's attention
Brings such satisfaction
To the craving in my bones.

Brightness that I pull back
From the Zodiac,
Why those questioning eyes
That are fixed upon me?
What can they do but shun me
If empty night replies?


A first Mute Coming—
In the Stranger's House—
A first fair Going—
When the Bells rejoice—

A first Exchange—of
What hath mingled—been—
For Lot—exhibited to
Faith—alone—Love, 

Fear and Hate and Childish Toys
Are here discreetly blent;
Admire, you ladies, read, you boys,
My Country Sentiment.

But Kate says, 'Cut that anger and fear,
True love's the stuff we need!
With laughing children and the running deer
That makes a book indeed.'

Then Tom, a hard and bloody chap,
Though much beloved by me,
'Robert, have done with nursery pap,
Write like a man,' says he.

Hate and Fear are not wanted here,
Nor Toys nor Country Lovers,
Everything they took from my new poem book
But the flyleaf and the covers. 


Amazing monster! that, for aught I know, 
With the first sight of thee didst make our race 
For ever stare! O flat and shocking face, 
Grimly divided from the breast below! 
Thou that on dry land horribly dost go 
With a split body and most ridiculous pace, 
Prong after prong, disgracer of all grace, 
Long-useless-finned, haired, upright, unwet, slow! 

O breather of unbreathable, sword-sharp air, 
How canst exist? How bear thyself, thou dry 
And dreary sloth? WHat particle canst share 
Of the only blessed life, the watery? 
I sometimes see of ye an actual pair 
Go by! linked fin by fin! most odiously. 


A fish eye just looks straight 
It never shows emotions
It cannot refuse a bait
That may take it to oblivion.

A fish eye can only stare
Taking everything in one look
In innocence it will dare
To try what it's like on a hook.

A fish eye never cries
As the body grows limp in pain
Eventually it will die
And its scales go down the drain.

A fish eye you cannot eat
It seems to be looking at you
Each spoonful of fleshy meat
Seems to ask 'What did you do? 



Oh hush, little baby, thy papa's at sea;
The big billows rock him as mamma rocks thee.
He hastes to his dear ones o'er billows of foam;
Then sleep, little darling, till papa comes home.
Sleep, little baby; hush, little baby;
Papa is coming, no longer to roam.


The shells and the pebbles, all day tossed about,
Are lulled into sleep by the tide ebbing out.
The tired shore slumbers, stretched out in the sand,
While the waves hurry off at mid-ocean's command.
Then hush, little darling; sleep, little darling;
Sleep, baby, rocked by thy mother's own hand.


The winds that have rollicked all day in the west
Are hushed into sleep on the calm evening's breast.
The boats that were out with the wild sea at play
Are now rocked to sleep in the arms of the bay.
Then rest, little baby; sleep, little baby;
Papa will come at the break of the day.



Sleep, little darling; too soon thou wilt be
A man like thy father, to sail o'er the sea.
Then sleep will not come at thy bidding or prayer,
For thou wilt be harassed by danger and care.
Then sleep, little darling; rest, little baby;
Rest whilst thou may, dear, and sleep whilst thou dare. 


I saw you twice the other day
Stirring passion anew
It's easy saying just move on
Less easier to do

Ive always said to others
There's plenty more fish in the sea
But some days it makes no difference
How many fish there be

On the face of it, a small fish
But you took over my whole sea
Never before had I gone fishing
It was all so new to me

You were someone that I longed for
I'd never felt like that before
Some months on, now I'm seeing
The sea has fish once more

But some days you're the only fish
Swimming in my sea
And the fervor that you stirred in me
Will forever be


You are the mighty blue sea
You welcome me
With open arms
You offer 
the whole of your precious treasure
But I am no match
To your height
I could never
Become a river
Nor the vast sea-shore
I am just a fistful of sand
Loaded on the truck
And transported
To build
A house. 


a fitting pun -
I was misled
the seamstress
was only
sew sew
in bed. 

It was after a while
You had a new bicycle
Ocean blue with tri-colors stripes
Six speeds and a gear pipe
Your h birthday gift
Another miles adrift
Bridging our distance
Is a five miles turn

Ocean blue bicycle
You come with a smile
Spends time in my cubicle
With your usual style
Smooth talking
We study
We kiss
Another day would be promising
Orgy
What bliss
A five miles turn
And awaiting kiss
Would churn
The tender hearts


What torture lurks within a single thought 
When grown too constant, and however kind, 
However welcome still, the weary mind 
Aches with its presence. Dull remembrance taught 
Remembers on unceasingly; unsought 
The old delight is with us but to find 
That all recurring joy is pain refined, 
Become a habit, and we struggle, caught. 
You lie upon my heart as on a nest, 
Folded in peace, for you can never know 
How crushed I am with having you at rest 
Heavy upon my life. I love you so 
You bind my freedom from its rightful quest. 
In mercy lift your drooping wings and go. 


An internal fire burns, 
Lights my life & is in all I learn
Fallen victim to pure dis concern, 
I pull back the boundaries, to see between the lines
Now all I witness is the truth and lies

Spilled out before us into our lives
I spread the word but receive jokes and jibes, 
But all I show is the truth of our people’s lives
I guess there not ready to open there eyes
A flight of fancy before they realize

Still it hurts deep inside
Right beside where my fire burns
Where people ignore your words and rhymes, no one cares, 
At least for this moment in time

To heal the world is an impossible task
But its inside me now I must work on it while it last’s, 
Before becomes an empty vision from my past.
The end is coming and it will be the last
Were part of history in our earths past
But, nothing will survive long enough to last


Some say to me I'm pitiful
craving the joy you intend for another
I'm the shadow roommate
the homely friend of the beautiful
girl she is; 
the one you'll marry
and I will position myself
for the bouquet
when it is you I want.

You knock and enter; 
I lower my eyes
unable to look at you
and you take a flower 
from her bouquet
and give it to me
because that is the way you are
kind to everyone.

And I take it to my diary
and put it between my
written pages
where it will scent my thoughts
of what will never be.

The cruelest love of all
lies in that Love's Aspiration
lies dead in the road
unnoticed.
It's not your fault or hers
it's my own secret obsession
from which I'll never be free.


I sit in the window, looking out down below
and I hear your voice: 

' I just want you to know
I think you are great'
and then you left
and I could hear her
crying softly
in a bedroom
full of tears
and I rise to look to see about her
trailing guilt
and hope against hope
and wonder
still reeling
from the fact
that you
had spoken to me; 

no longer invisible
filled with your words which have splattered
onto me
intended from my roommate
electrified that you noticed me
a single flower from a bouquet
intended for her-

awakening then
from yet another daydream
of you
and me. 


A flea and a fly in a flue
Were imprisoned, so what could they do?
Said the fly, "let us flee!"
"Let us fly!" said the flea.
So they flew through a flaw in the flue. 

Thou shalt not laugh, thou shalt not romp, 
Let's grimly kiss with bated breath; 
As quietly and solemnly 
As Life when it is kissing Death. 
Now in the silence of the grave, 
My hand is squeezing that soft breast; 
While thou dost in such passion lie, 
It mocks me with its look of rest.

But when the morning comes at last, 
And we must part, our passions cold, 
You'll think of some new feather, scarf 
To buy with my small piece of gold; 
And I'll be dreaming of green lanes, 
Where little things with beating hearts 
Hold shining eyes between the leaves, 
Till men with horses pass, and carts. 


I watched the days
and time 
fly by

Sparrows -
their songs too brief


When searching for solutions
Intellect can be as great an obstacle
As our emotional being
If it prefers to construct its own truth
And regards it as an absolute
A flicker that is experienced 
In silence of mind holds
The hints and impressions
For a problem even though
Solution is still at large in mind. 


A Flight
============

A colorful kite was I 
Made out of glittering hues, 
With green, blue red and white
A lovely colorful kite was I.
 
So loving and happy was I, 
Being cared, nurtured and loved so much. 
The thread of love being knotted with me, 
I was flown in blue open sky.

Fluttering  and roaming around
With white clouds and birds at large, 
Playing hide and seek, merrily with them 
Being knotted with the thread of my loved. 

The pleasure and comfort we had 
With the combined effort of two of us, 
Both of our  souls being so content
With the sublime beauty of  life! ! 

With a sudden shake and a jerk in between 
The thread I found to be torn.
I'm floating away to far distance 
Getting forlorn and out of sight! 

Knowing nothing about what happens around
Simply I am whisked away and driven out. 
But I cannot forget you, 
Cannot dream anything but you. 


Where ever I am being drawn
Even I am forlorn, 
I am always with you dear
As earlier as I was.

Kite is no more  in sight
Love thread is wound up on wheel, 
The symphony we had is broken now, 
A deadly silence is all around! ! .   


In  hope of wamth and  fields; 
Stunned, look at concrete. . 

Every sea has two distinct shores 
One of hate the other of love 
One of strife the other of joy 
In between floats, life barge to and fro


I am like a floating cloud in this
Vast open seemingly barren sky.
Hidden in my bosom millions of tiny vapors, 
Formless, colorless, faceless, 
Waiting for a chance to get a face, a color, or a form.
In their expression I find a bit of my identity, 
But very often I float around
Carrying that mysterious world within. 
That veiled mysterious world-
So near yet so unknown.
Every now and than a flash of light escapes from it, 
Like a meteor bursting on night sky.
It touches me, inspires me
Illuminates my whole being for a moment-
Then every thing becomes quiet again, 
Like nothing has happened.
Mystics call it the world of silence-
Unfathomable.
There all is tranquil, all is calm.
This infinite space within-
The substratum of life, 
It holds me, cuddles me, guides me through.
Always pulling me with some magical energy
Yet always beyond my reach. 


Ah! It is not rainy season
From where fell 
The rain drops! 
It is thirsty Summer
Long lonely roads simmer
But  from where
fell the rain drops
I looked up
And found
One floating cloud
Showering blessings
From above
Oh I know, I know
I was waiting for it
All these years


Romantic nights of song and dance
Still live within my heart
And when I recall our ecstasy
Beautiful memories start.

In love, we waltzed beneath the moon
How foolish! I cannot deny. 
Hand in hand and cheek to cheek
We left the world behind.

Such joy will never come again
For we are young no more.
And in golden dreams I clearly see
The way we were before.

The places where we used to go
Have crumbled now with time, 
Gone has the old seat by the mill
And church bells never chime.

But love goes back a long long way
Maturing with the years like wine
And hand in hand and side by side
We still leave the world behind. 


Down mildest shores of milk-white sand,
  By cape and fair Floridian bay,
Twixt billowy pines -- a surf asleep on land --
   And the great Gulf at play,

 Past far-off palms that filmed to nought,
  Or in and out the cunning keys
That laced the land like fragile patterns wrought
   To edge old broideries,

 The sail sighed on all day for joy,
  The prow each pouting wave did leave
All smile and song, with sheen and ripple coy,
   Till the dusk diver Eve

 Brought up from out the brimming East
  The oval moon, a perfect pearl.
In that large lustre all our haste surceased,
   The sail seemed fain to furl,

 The silent steersman landward turned,
  And ship and shore set breast to breast.
Under a palm wherethrough a planet burned
   We ate, and sank to rest.

 But soon from sleep's dear death (it seemed)
  I rose and strolled along the sea
Down silver distances that faintly gleamed
   On to infinity.

 Till suddenly I paused, for lo!
  A shape (from whence I ne'er divined)
Appeared before me, pacing to and fro,
   With head far down inclined.

 `A wraith' (I thought) `that walks the shore
  To solve some old perplexity.'
Full heavy hung the draggled gown he wore;
   His hair flew all awry.

 He waited not (as ghosts oft use)
  To be `dearheaven'd!' and `oh'd!'
But briskly said:  "Good-evenin'; what's the news?
   Consumption?  After boa'd?

 "Or mebbe you're intendin' of
  Investments?  Orange-plantin'?  Pine?
Hotel? or Sanitarium?  What above
   This yea'th CAN be your line?

 "Speakin' of sanitariums, now,
  Jest look 'ee here, my friend:
I know a little story, -- well, I swow,
   Wait till you hear the end!

 "Some year or more ago, I s'pose,
  I roamed from Maine to Floridy,
And, -- see where them Palmettos grows?
   I bought that little key,

 "Cal'latin' for to build right off
  A c'lossal sanitarium:
Big surf!  Gulf breeze!  Jest death upon a cough!
   -- I run it high, to hum!

 "Well, sir, I went to work in style:
  Bought me a steamboat, loaded it
With my hotel (pyazers more'n a mile!)
   Already framed and fit,

 "Insured 'em, fetched 'em safe around,
  Put up my buildin', moored my boat,
COM-plete! then went to bed and slept as sound
   As if I'd paid a note.

 "Now on that very night a squall,
  Cum up from some'eres -- some bad place!
An' blowed an' tore an' reared an' pitched an' all,
   -- I had to run a race

 "Right out o' bed from that hotel
  An' git to yonder risin' ground,
For, 'twixt the sea that riz and rain that fell,
   I pooty nigh was drowned!

 "An' thar I stood till mornin' cum,
  Right on yon little knoll of sand,
 wishin' I had stayed to hum
   Fur from this tarnal land.

 "When mornin' cum, I took a good
  Long look, and -- well, sir, sure's I'm ME --
That boat laid right whar that hotel had stood,
   And HIT sailed out to sea!

 "No:  I'll not keep you:  good-bye, friend.
  Don't think about it much, -- preehaps
Your brain might git see-sawin', end for end,
   Like them asylum chaps,

 "For here *I* walk, forevermore,
  A-tryin' to make it gee,
How one same wind could blow my ship to shore
   And my hotel to sea!





From cold Norse caves or buccaneer Southern seas
 Oft come repenting tempests here to die;
Bewailing old-time wrecks and robberies,
 They shrive to priestly pines with many a sigh,
Breathe salutary balms through lank-lock'd hair
 Of sick men's heads, and soon -- this world outworn --
Sink into saintly heavens of stirless air,
 Clean from confessional.  One died, this morn,
 Sweet sovereign Lady of all souls that bide
In contemplation, tames the too bright skies
 Like that faint agate film, far down descried,
Restraining suns in sudden thoughtful eyes
 Which flashed but now.  Blest distillation rare
Of o'er-rank brightness filtered waterwise
 Through all the earths in heaven -- thou always fair,
Still virgin bride of e'er-creating thought --
Dream-worker, in whose dream the Future's wrought --
Healer of hurts, free balm for bitter wrongs --
Most silent mother of all sounding songs --
Thou that dissolvest hells to make thy heaven --
Thou tempest's heir, that keep'st no tempest leaven --
But after winds' and thunders' wide mischance
Dost brood, and better thine inheritance --
Thou privacy of space, where each grave Star
As in his own still chamber sits afar
To meditate, yet, by thy walls unpent,
Shines to his fellows o'er the firmament --
Oh! as thou liv'st in all this sky and sea
That likewise lovingly do live in thee,
So melt my soul in thee, and thine in me,
 Divine Tranquillity!


Gray Pelican, poised where yon broad shallows shine,
Know'st thou, that finny foison all is mine
In the bag below thy beak -- yet thine, not less?
Hath wrought that every soul, this loving morn,
Into all things may be new-corporate born,
And each live whole in all:  I sail with thee,
Thy Pelican's self is mine; yea, silver Sea,
    In this large moment all thy fishes, ripples, bights,
Pale in-shore greens and distant blue delights,
White visionary sails, long reaches fair
By moon-horn'd strands that film the far-off air,
    Bright sparkle-revelations, secret majesties,
Shells, wrecks and wealths, are mine; yea, Orange-trees,
That lift your small world-systems in the light,
Rich sets of round green heavens studded bright
With globes of fruit that like still planets shine,
Mine is your green-gold universe; yea, mine,
White slender Lighthouse fainting to the eye
That wait'st on yon keen cape-point wistfully,
Like to some maiden spirit pausing pale,
 New-wing'd, yet fain to sail
    Above the serene Gulf to where a bridegroom soul
Calls o'er the soft horizon -- mine thy dole
Of shut undaring wings and wan desire --
Mine, too, thy later hope and heavenly fire
Of kindling expectation; yea, all sights,
 All sounds, that make this morn -- quick flights
Of pea-green paroquets 'twixt neighbor trees,
Like missives and sweet morning inquiries
From green to green, in green -- live oaks' round heads,
Busy with jays for thoughts -- grays, whites and reds
Of pranked woodpeckers that ne'er gossip out,
But alway tap at doors and gad about --
Robins and mocking-birds that all day long
Athwart straight sunshine weave cross-threads of song,
Shuttles of music -- clouds of mosses gray
That rain me rains of pleasant thoughts alway
From a low sky of leaves -- faint yearning psalms
Of endless metre breathing through the palms
That crowd and lean and gaze from off the shore
Ever for one that cometh nevermore --
Palmettos ranked, with childish spear-points set
Against no enemy -- rich cones that fret
High roofs of temples shafted tall with pines --
Green, grateful mangroves where the sand-beach shines --
Long lissome coast that in and outward swerves,
All riches, goods and braveries never told
Of earth, sun, air and heaven -- now I hold
Your being in my being; I am ye,
 And ye myself; yea, lastly, Thee,
My Father, Friend, Beloved, dear All-One,
Thee in my soul, my soul in Thee, I feel,
Self of my self.  Lo, through my sense doth steal
Clear cognizance of all selves and qualities,
Of all existence that hath been or is,
Of all strange haps that men miscall of chance,
And all the works of tireless circumstance:
Each borders each, like mutual sea and shore,
Nor aught misfits his neighbor that's before,
Nor him that's after -- nay, through this still air,
Out of the North come quarrels, and keen blare
Of challenge by the hot-breath'd parties blown;
Yet break they not this peace with alien tone,
Fray not my heart, nor fright me for my land,
-- I hear from all-wards, allwise understand,
The great bird Purpose bears me twixt her wings,
And I am one with all the kinsmen things
That e'er my Father fathered.  Oh, to me
All questions solve in this tranquillity:
E'en this dark matter, once so dim, so drear,
Now shines upon my spirit heavenly-clear:
Thou, Father, without logic, tellest me
How this divine denial true may be,
-- How `All's in each, yet every one of all
Maintains his Self complete and several.



And while we dream of calling back a time
To be as one of love sublime, 
Drinking out the days of mellow wine, 
Life laughs! 

You cast out emotions, 
Find another man! 

And I? 
In my meandering, 
I find anew a love with inner deserts
Parched of hope

Onwards! 
Now a storm: 
As clouds thunder in their black torment, 
I cry in harmony, 
Sing our song of history

Perfumed
And slender on your legs, 
A flow of memories
Lament your walk away, 
Leaving me to fail in love
Upon another day


Who am I? What is my Being? 

Friendships and passions no more stir
Grief and aches no longer grip
It's neither dream nor deep sleep
No sense of time but am aware

Nothing is in the awareness
Still completeness pervades
Within is like a serene lake
Without thought waves I am awake

Mind that has engulfed within 
Disappeared as river into the ocean

Streams of sense move in and as silence

When the mind dissolves itself in the SELF


Am an intuitive seer
A dynamic loving Being
A blissful awareness
A flow of tranquility


A flow of tranquility 
Is coming to me
And I can feel it all over me


This flower a beauty, 
battered and Hurt, 
This Beautiful flower wasn't Destroyed, 
she In time strengthened, and bloomed once more. 


i am the flower
which dreamt to be..
a sparrow
to see herself
when she dreamt..
to be a sparrow
crossing the time
and the place
to prevent her dream
of being..
a sparrow
and be a flower
deams of nothing
but being a flower
for love..
and painting. 


TELL me, ye Zephyrs! that unfold,
While fluttering o'er this gay Recess,
Pinions that fanned the teeming mould
Of Eden's blissful wilderness,
Did only softly-stealing hours
There close the peaceful lives of flowers?

Say, when the 'moving' creatures saw
All kinds commingled without fear,
Prevailed a like indulgent law
For the still growths that prosper here?
Did wanton fawn and kid forbear
The half-blown rose, the lily spare?

Or peeped they often from their beds
And prematurely disappeared,
Devoured like pleasure ere it spreads
A bosom to the sun endeared?
If such their harsh untimely doom,
It falls not 'here' on bud or bloom.

All summer long the happy Eve
Of this fair Spot her flowers may bind,
Nor e'er, with ruffled fancy, grieve,
From the next glance she casts, to find
That love for little things by Fate
Is rendered vain as love for great.

Yet, where the guardian fence is wound,
So subtly are our eyes beguiled
We see not nor suspect a bound,
No more than in some forest wild;
The sight is free as air--or crost
Only by art in nature lost.

And, though the jealous turf refuse
By random footsteps to be prest,
And feed on never-sullied dews,
'Ye', gentle breezes from the west,
With all the ministers of hope
Are tempted to this sunny slope!

And hither throngs of birds resort;
Some, inmates lodged in shady nests,
Some, perched on stems of stately port
That nod to welcome transient guests;
While hare and leveret, seen at play,
'Appear' not more shut out than they.

Apt emblem (for reproof of pride)
This delicate Enclosure shows
Of modest kindness, that would hide
The firm protection she bestows;
Of manners, like its viewless fence,
Ensuring peace to innocence.

Thus spake the moral Muse--her wing
Abruptly spreading to depart,
She left that farewell offering,
Momento for some docile heart;
That may respect the good old age
When Fancy was Truth's willing Page;
And Truth would skim the flowery glade,
Though entering but as Fancy's Shade. 


Your rosy cheeks
The scent of kindness seeks
Its own level
I smell and revel
You were a flower girl
Blind
And now
A pretty woman
The most beautiful rose
On my mind
You 
Remember me
When you touch my hand
Love's spring
Begins to flow
Your radiant smile
The sparkle in my heart
And
A warm glow


Filling the air around sublime a fragrance strikes! 
Alluring sweet 'n soft, this soothing smell arrives 
My sense rears to find from where this feel derives 
But fails to place the source; who sends this scent divine? 

Oh! Dear! I now hear arousing words yours
Passion, honey to share and profound burning fire
Before the sleepless night disheartened goes tired
It is your flower that invites me to there! 
 


I want to fall on you like rain
upon a wildflower
Opening new reason from you
Scaring all the old bees away from
Pollinating your bed
Scaring all the fake men off who
Can only stand the sun
So it’s just me and you in the
Meadow
The rabbits in the hole
The grasses are wet and beginning to bow
The forest is damp and sleepy
And in the meadow
I bend down and kiss your petals wetly
Falling all over you
Letting your pistil slip into my mouth
Sucking off your honey, 
Almost plucking you
But not going so far
Just pulling you so that you can feel
Your roots leaving
To let you almost taste
My world in the sky
So afterwards you can go down 
Believing
The words on my lips
When I fall on my knees for you
A flower in the rain. 


I did not bring you roses 
When you searched for something rare, 
Instead I brought you daisies
And I hoped you wouldn't care; 

And now I look behind me
With a wistful little smile -
You would have taken dandelions
And loved me all the while.



OLD friend, that with a pale and pensile grace 
Climbest the lush hedgerows, art thou back again, 
Marking the slow round of the wond'rous years? 
Didst beckon me a moment, silent flower? 

Silent? As silent is the archangel's pen 
That day by day writes our life chronicle, 
And turns the page,--the half-forgotten page, 
Which all eternity will never blot. 

Forgotten? No, we never do forget: 
We let the years go: eash then clean with tears, 
Leave them to bleach, out in the open day, 
Or lock them careful by, like dead friends' clothes, 
Till we shall dare unfold them without pain,-- 
But we forget not, never can forget. 
Flower, thou and I a moment face to face-- 
My face as clear as thine, this July noon 
Shining on both, on bee and butterfly 
And golden geetle creeping in the sun-- 
Will pause, and,lifting up, page after page, 
The many-colored history of life, 
Look backwards, backwards. 


So, the volume close! 
This July day, with the sun high in heaven, 
And the whole earth rejoicing,--let it close. 

I think we need not sigh, complain, nor rave; 
Nor blush,--our doings and misdoing all 
Being more 'gainst heaven than man, heaven them does keep 
With all its doings and undoings strange 
Concerning us.--Ah, let the volume close: 
I would not alter in it one poor line. 

My dainty flower, my innocent white flower 
With such a pure smile looking up to heaven, 
With such a bright smile looking down on me-- 
(Nothing but smiles,--as if in all the world 
Were no such things as thunder-storms or frosts, 
Or broken petals trampled on the ground, 
Or shivering leaveswhirled in the wintry air 
Like ghosts of last years joys--my pretty flower, 
I'll pluck thee--smiling too. Not one salt drop 
Shall stain thee:--if these foolish eyes are dim, 
That they behold such beauty and such peace, 

Essence for the elites, 
Colors general delights.
But the flower blooms, 
For ecstasy of nectar, 
I'm drunk of it's seven lights. 


When famed Varelst this little wonder drew,
Flora vouchsafed the growing works to view;
Finding the painter's science at a stand,
The goddess snatch'd the pencil from his hand,
And finishing the piece, she smiling said,
Behold one work of mine that ne'er shall fade. 

Heart's ease or pansy, pleasure or thought,
Which would the picture give us of these?
Surely the heart that conceived it sought
  Heart's ease.

Surely by glad and divine degrees
The heart impelling the hand that wrought
Wrought comfort here for a soul's disease.

Deep flowers, with lustre and darkness fraught,
From glass that gleams as the chill still seas
Lean and lend for a heart distraught
  Heart's ease. 

I had always wished flowers to boom
With nice place, space and very good room
Where they can come out from their hiding
See the world themselves and chiding

We know it is for short duration
So is the life too in question! 
Why do we stop them from booming? 
When danger is already large looming? 

Let children too invade this holy land
No restriction for their coming to befriend
Lovely air and nature for very good refuge
Large and tall trees with mountains so huge

We want their arrival restricted
Cruelty and other sorts inflicted
Yet they come despite out precaution
We just need to think it with only caution

We need to leave certain things to our creator
He is whole and sole and real mentor
What we are on earth today? 
Just helpless animal pushed away

We do the things never called for
We defy the rules and kill the persons in war
We recklessly aim at complete annihilation
How can we go in for such devastation? 

Let us do the complete rethinking
Take steps before ship is sinking
Not a blade of grass may grow
If we continuously pollute the river flow

We can destroy the land several times today
Still some weapons will be left to throw away
We can mange to destroy but not to revive
Yet time is left to think over and survive

What will be left on earth to enjoy? 
If we employ the methods to destroy
Why flowers, children, and trees alone? 
Only beautiful earth will left behind with stones


A flower spoke to the soil
but its pains remained untold;
the bushes were pruned
but
they were trapped in snow.

They say the garden is abloom,
the sunshine washes the flowerbeds
and the cool reigns.

for instance, this week
I'm eating sunflower seed bread

and suppose that no-one had told me
that just like those cutesy baby tapeworms
sunflower seeds made themselves at home
and grew like men having babies

until one day, someone would say good morning
and you'd open your mouth and just like
one of those happy film cartoons
out would pop a big yellow sun flower as
an answer

worse still if you were strolling round 
a Van Gogh show and someone asked you
what you thought of them
and thought you were taking the mickey
like some Disney moment

yes we need other people's wisdom
to live safely I mean
why don't they grow like tapeworms, 
do you know, smartypants

Hollow, holes ridden reed, just
timed that way
and a graceful breath
and gradual
make a sound together-
peaceful to the mind
soothing to the heart
tickling to the body. 

they could
never make it apart. 


Just a fly on the wall
watching this small world go by
trapped in this house
it sees the door open
it flies as fast as it can
but that is not that fast 
for its wings have been 
bent and broken
and never quiet healed
just as it reaches it
the door slams shut
second before it could have reached freedom
so close but yet so far
the fly returns to the wall
sitting and watching
mostly unnoticed
when it is noticed
they either ignore it
or try to kill it
not one of them has tried to set it free
there is one that has tried to capture it
in a small little glass jar
that one once succeeded
almost driving the fly over the edge
being stuck in a by glass jar
but it escaped
it moved back into the larger prison
moved back to its place on the wall
and there the fly will remain until
for I am that fly
there I stay with my undying eyes
watching this world fly by
one day 
one person will let it fly free
either that or I will have to wait until my wings fully heal
and then I shall fly free from this prison


I.
Forbear this liquid fire, Fly,
It is more fatal then the dry,
That singly, but embracing, wounds;
And this at once both burns and drowns.

                  II.
The salamander, that in heat
And flames doth cool his monstrous sweat,
Whose fan a glowing cake is said,
Of this red furnace is afraid.

                 III.
Viewing the ruby-christal shine,
Thou tak'st it for heaven-christalline;
Anon thou wilt be taught to groan:
'Tis an ascended Acheron.

                  IV.
A snow-ball heart in it let fall,
And take it out a fire-ball;
Ali icy breast in it betray'd
Breaks a destructive wild granade.

                  V.
'Tis this makes Venus altars shine,
This kindles frosty Hymen's pine;
When the boy grows old in his desires,
This flambeau doth new light his fires.

                  VI.
Though the cold hermit over wail,
Whose sighs do freeze, and tears drop hail,
Once having pass'd this, will ne'r
Another flaming purging fear.

                 VII.
The vestal drinking this doth burn
Now more than in her fun'ral urn;
Her fires, that with the sun kept race,
Are now extinguish'd by her face.

                 VIII.
The chymist, that himself doth still,
Let him but tast this limbecks bill,
And prove this sublimated bowl,
He'll swear it will calcine a soul.

                  IX.
Noble, and brave! now thou dost know
The false prepared decks below,
Dost thou the fatal liquor sup,
One drop, alas! thy barque blowes up.

                  X.
What airy country hast to save,
Whose plagues thou'lt bury in thy grave?
For even now thou seem'st to us
On this gulphs brink a Curtius.

                  XI.
And now th' art faln (magnanimous Fly)
In, where thine Ocean doth fry,
Like the Sun's son, who blush'd the flood
To a complexion of blood.

                 XII.
Yet, see! my glad auricular
Redeems thee (though dissolv'd) a star,
Flaggy thy wings, and scorch'd thy thighs,
Thou ly'st a double sacrifice.

                 XIII.
And now my warming, cooling breath
Shall a new life afford in death;
See! in the hospital of my hand
Already cur'd, thou fierce do'st stand.

                 XIV.
Burnt insect! dost thou reaspire
The moist-hot-glasse and liquid fire?
I see 'tis such a pleasing pain,
Thou would'st be scorch'd and drown'd again. 



Small type of great ones, that do hum
Within this whole world's narrow room,
That with a busie hollow noise
Catch at the people's vainer voice,
And with spread sails play with their breath,
Whose very hails new christen death.
Poor Fly, caught in an airy net,
Thy wings have fetter'd now thy feet;
Where, like a Lyon in a toyl,
Howere thou keep'st a noble coyl,
And beat'st thy gen'rous breast, that o're
The plains thy fatal buzzes rore,
Till thy all-bellyd foe (round elf)
Hath quarter'd thee within himself.

  Was it not better once to play
I' th' light of a majestick ray,
Where, though too neer and bold, the fire
Might sindge thy upper down attire,
And thou i' th' storm to loose an eye.
A wing, or a self-trapping thigh:
Yet hadst thou fal'n like him, whose coil
Made fishes in the sea to broyl,
When now th'ast scap'd the noble flame;
Trapp'd basely in a slimy frame,
And free of air, thou art become
Slave to the spawn of mud and lome?

  Nor is't enough thy self do's dresse
To thy swoln lord a num'rous messe,
And by degrees thy thin veins bleed,
And piecemeal dost his poyson feed;
But now devour'd, art like to be
A net spun for thy familie,
And, straight expanded in the air,
Hang'st for thy issue too a snare.
Strange witty death and cruel ill
That, killing thee, thou thine dost kill!
Like pies, in whose entombed ark
All fowl crowd downward to a lark,
Thou art thine en'mies' sepulcher,
And in thee buriest, too, thine heir.


  Yet Fates a glory have reserv'd
For one so highly hath deserv'd.
As the rhinoceros doth dy
Under his castle-enemy,
As through the cranes trunk throat doth speed,
The aspe doth on his feeder feed;
Fall yet triumphant in thy woe,
Bound with the entrails of thy foe. 


Swimming in its world of amber 
The long-legged fly can still remember 

The burning heat 
Of the sun in the Eocene 

From its golden sea, this fly has seen 
The dance of continents, the rise and fall 

Of all ten thousand things 
Upon our planet. 

In the many facets of its eyes 
Seas have filled with water, deepened, dried, 

Mountain ranges risen, crumbled. 
This fly has seen the centaur and the unicorn 

And the first Neanderthal. 
Nations, empires passed before it, 

Wave after wave in quick succession. 
This fly was in its amber when 

King Cheops built his pyramid 
And Roman Caesar conquered Gaul. 

Now with this ancient creature in my palm 
I am become 
The green flash of the setting sun. 


Just a fly 
the wall 
my perch

Watching this small 
world go by

Trapped in this 
house
it sees 
door open
flies as fast 
it is so 
can

Yet not that 
fast 
for its wings 
have been 
bent so 
broken

Never quiet 
healed
for as it 
does 
reach it
the door so 
slamed shut

Second before 
freedom so 
could have 
reached

Close but yet 
far
fly returns 
to wall
sitting watching
mostly unnoticed

When it is noticed
they either ignore 
it
try to kill 
it

No one has tried 
to set it 
free

There is one 
that has tried 
to capture it
small little glass 
jar

That one once 
succeeded
by driving the fly 
over the edge 
purposley pushing 
wrong button

Then being stuck 
in a by glass 
jar

Escaped it did
moved back 
into the larger 
prison

Moved back to its place 
on the wall

There the fly will 
remain untill 

Have they no shame
for I am that fly 
on the wall

I stay with my 
undying eyes
watching this 
world fly by
one day 

Some person will 
let it fly free

Saith I will have to wait 
until my wings fully heal

Then I shall fly free 
from this prison


I cried so much on my sins, 
Noah asked Him, 
Should I go to the earth once again? 
Man is now matured enough, 
No more prophets, 
Who keeps me away from you! 
Otherwise your beauty is enough, 
To excite me for more sins, 
I can't kiss you sweetheart, 
But the Angel is helpless here, 
A flying kiss! He cannot stop. 

She flies from petals to petals, 
In a twinkling of the poetic eyes
Like a gymnast performs it so well! 
That's how the poet sees butterflies.

In colorful lights when she dances
Like a sweet cute girl of only seven
Shakes n awakes the sleeping buds
That's how a poet views the heaven.

Excites the buds to open their petals
Aromatic beauty makes air ecstatic
Touches millions of senses in a second
That's how a poet turns so aesthetic.

Owe to the show of a cute butterfly   
To the tunes of beating rainbow wings
To the flood lights of colors in dance
That's how a poet gets a pen of stings. 


the phone rang at a. m.
and it was a man from Denver:

One day I sent some words to Tel Aviv.
Perhaps, they whisper in the grasses yet.
Good-bye to my last teacher and my best.
A letter to be read over your grave.

I left you in another century.
There was no place for poetry to stop.
I think you understand how limited
Mere words and stanzas are to bring you back.

Your shadow lingers on that distant pane, 
Through which two wordsmiths viewed their brevity.
You often signed your letters with, 'Till soon', 
Warm words far more endearing than farewell.



A fond farewell to a friend
That is going
Home to see
His dad
That is sick in
Alberta


A fond kiss, and then we sever;
A farewell, and then forever! 
Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,
Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee.
Who shall say that Fortune grieves him,
While the star of hope she leaves him?
Me, nae cheerfu' twinkle lights me;
Dark despair around benights me.
I'll ne'er blame my partial fancy,
Nothing could resist my Nancy;
But to see her was to love her;
Love but her, and love forever.
Had we never lov'd say kindly,
Had we never lov'd say blindly,
Never met--or never parted--
We had ne'er been broken-hearted.
Fare thee well, thou first and fairest!
Fare thee well, thou best and dearest!
Thine be like a joy and treasure,
Peace. enjoyment, love, and pleasure!
A fond kiss, and then we sever;
A farewell, alas, forever!
Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,
Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee


In this fool's game that shouldn't begin, 
You play deep love without honest rules.
If you think that you will always win, 
Well it's wrong, 'cause this game is for fools.

If you think that my style is easy, 
And you hunt me without honest rules, 
Well, my way to be is not sleazy, 
And it's good, 'cause this game is for fools.

If you think to catch me so slowly, 
And you dance this without honest rules, 
If you think that my life is lonely, 
Well it's wrong, but life is yet for fools.

In this morbid dance without feelings, 
Dance of wishes without honest rules, 
To think that love means mutual dealings
It is as wrong as are your game fools.

If you think that you'll be a winner
In this love fight without honest rules
Well, love means not sex after dinner.
You can loose, 'cause it's a game for fools.

If you think that you can get everything
In this world of yours without right rules, 
If you think that I'm a stupid thing, 
Well it's wrong 'cause it's a game for fools. 

What powerful things, are an eagle's wings, 
As he soars high on currents of air.
So graceful in flight, when seen at great height, 
Oh! How you wish you could be there.

Gliding supreme, in a wonderful dream, 
Free as that proud bird of prey.
A beautiful sight, when his sharp eyes alight
On good food, when off on a foray.

In silence he sits, motionless, his wits
Gauging what his next move ought to be.
Such elegance and style, he hunts with such guile, 
Endowed with a foolproof strategy.

His skill is top-notch he is always on watch, 
For creatures that are travelling with haste.
He swoops with sheer speed, and captures his feed, 
Devouring it, and loving the taste.

While he is trailblazing, he rules like a king, 
The fields are his conquered domain.
A veritable speeder, a formidable leader, 
In legendary splendour, long may he reign. 


do not mountains, 
trees, and rivers live
their time, and die? 
does not the sun
rise in the morning
only to lay down at night? 
are not universes born of dust, 
only to return to dust? 
why should we be any different? 

all that lives but a fleeting glimpse
into the workings of eternity.
yet everything that comes and goes
leaves an indelible mark, 
a footprint on the water, 
a face put to the wind


Sitting close to a forbidden place, able to reach out and touch
the entrance to it.

Watching sunlight dance and shimmer through traces of designs
upon it's windows, twelve rectangular windows, like twelve
apostles waiting, standing guard so no one unanticipated can
enter.

Deadbolt standing rigidly on the door, key hole beckoning me
to explore the labyrinths beyond it's entrance.

Wonder, full of curiosity am I, wanting to see what lies beyond
the reach of sight beyond my eyes.

Touching softly, tongs of my mind, echoing and re-echoing my
heart's curious desires.

Feeling a gentle urging from within to go exploring is hard to ignore, 
especially when my mind is being tantalized by it's
curiosity and unknowing.

Walking silently across my mind, figuring out ways to get 
inside and see the wonder of my imagining.

Sitting close to a forbidden place, able to reach out and touch
the entrance to it, yet cannot get beyond the door except in
my imagination. 


What days await this woman, whose strange feet
Breathe spells, whose presence makes men dream like wine,
Tall, free and slender as the forest pine,
Whose form is moulded music, through whose sweet
Frank eyes I feel the very heart's least beat,
Keen, passionate, full of dreams and fire:
How in the end, and to what man's desire
Shall all this yield, whose lips shall these lips meet?

One thing I know: if he be great and pure,
This love, this fire, this beauty shall endure;
Triumph and hope shall lead him by the palm:
But if not this, some differing thing he be,
That dream shall break in terror; he shall see
The whirlwind ripen, where he sowed the calm.


Flitting around the forest, 
going further into it's dense foliage, 
unafraid of what will be found there.

Announcing the arrival of animals, 
coming to greet and ascend the ladder 
of beginning times in unending themes
of becoming times in unending rectitude. 

There is a place I search for still,
Sequestered as the world of dreams,
A bushy hollow, and a hill
That whispers with descending streams,
Cool, careless waters, wandering down,
Like Innocence who runs to town,
Leaving the wildwood and its dreams,
And prattling like the forest streams.

But still in dreams I meet again
The child who bound me, heart and hand,
And led me with a wildflower chain
Far from our world, to Faeryland:
Who made me see and made me know
The lovely Land of Long-Ago,
Leading me with her little hand
Into the world of Wonderland.


The years have passed: how far away
The day when there I met the child,
The little maid, who was a fay,
Whose eyes were dark and undefiled
And crystal as a woodland well,
That holds within its depths a spell,
Enchantments, featured like a child,
A dream, a poetry undefiled.

Around my heart she wrapped her hair,
And bound my soul with lips and eyes,
And led me to a cavern, where
Grey Legend dwelt in kingly guise,
Her kinsman, dreamier than the moon,
Who called her Fancy, read her rune,
And bade her with paternal eyes
Divest herself of her disguise.

And still I walk with her in dreams,
Though many years have passed since then,
And that high hill and its wild streams
Are lost as is that faery glen.
And as the years go swiftly by
I find it harder, when I try,
To meet with her, who led me then
Into the wildness of that glen. 


To hew the shaft, and lay the architrave, 
And spread the roof above them,---ere he framed 
The lofty vault, to gather and roll back 
The sound of anthems; in the darkling wood, 
Amidst the cool and silence, he knelt down, 
And offered to the Mightiest solemn thanks 
And supplication. For his simple heart 
Might not resist the sacred influences, 
Which, from the stilly twilight of the place, 
And from the gray old trunks that high in heaven 
Mingled their mossy boughs, and from the sound 
Of the invisible breath that swayed at once 
All their green tops, stole over him, and bowed 
His spirit with the thought of boundless power 
And inaccessible majesty. Ah, why 
Should we, in the world's riper years, neglect 
Only among the crowd, and under roofs, 
That our frail hands have raised? Let me, at least, 
Here, in the shadow of this aged wood, 
Offer one hymn---thrice happy, if it find 
Acceptance in His ear. 
Father, thy hand 
Hath reared these venerable columns, thou 
Didst weave this verdant roof. Thou didst look down 
Upon the naked earth, and, forthwith, rose 
All these fair ranks of trees. They, in thy sun, 
Budded, and shook their green leaves in the breeze, 
And shot towards heaven. The century-living crow, 
Whose birth was in their tops, grew old and died 
Among their branches, till, at last, they stood, 
As now they stand, massy, and tall, and dark, 
Fit shrine for humble worshipper to hold 
Communion with his Maker. These dim vaults, 
These winding aisles, of human pomp and pride 
Report not. No fantastic carvings show 
The boast of our vain race to change the form 
Of thy fair works. But thou art here---thou fill'st 
The solitude. Thou art in the soft winds 
That run along the summit of these trees 
In music; thou art in the cooler breath 
That from the inmost darkness of the place 
Comes, scarcely felt; the barky trunks, the ground, 
The fresh moist ground, are all instinct with thee. 
Here is continual worship;---Nature, here, 
In the tranquility that thou dost love, 
Enjoys thy presence. Noiselessly, around, 
From perch to perch, the solitary bird 
Passes; and yon clear spring, that, midst its herbs, 
Wells softly forth and wandering steeps the roots 
Of half the mighty forest, tells no tale 
Of all the good it does. Thou hast not left 
Thyself without a witness, in these shades, 
Of thy perfections. Grandeur, strength, and grace 
Are here to speak of thee. This mighty oak--- 
By whose immovable stem I stand and seem 
Almost annihilated---not a prince, 
In all that proud old world beyond the deep, 
E'er wore his crown as lofty as he 
Wears the green coronal of leaves with which 
Thy hand has graced him. Nestled at his root 
Is beauty, such as blooms not in the glare 
Of the broad sun. That delicate forest flower 
With scented breath, and look so like a smile, 
Seems, as it issues from the shapeless mould, 
An emanation of the indwelling Life, 
A visible token of the upholding Love, 
That are the soul of this wide universe. 

My heart is awed within me when I think 
Of the great miracle that still goes on, 
In silence, round me---the perpetual work 
Of thy creation, finished, yet renewed 
The lesson of thy own eternity. 
Lo! all grow old and die---but see again, 
How on the faltering footsteps of decay 
Youth presses----ever gay and beautiful youth 
In all its beautiful forms. These lofty trees 
Wave not less proudly that their ancestors 
Moulder beneath them. Oh, there is not lost 
One of earth's charms: upon her bosom yet, 
After the flight of untold centuries, 
The freshness of her far beginning lies 
And yet shall lie. Life mocks the idle hate 
Of his arch enemy Death---yea, seats himself 
Upon the tyrant's throne---the sepulchre, 
And of the triumphs of his ghastly foe 
Makes his own nourishment. For he came forth 
From thine own bosom, and shall have no end. 

There have been holy men who hid themselves 
Deep in the woody wilderness, and gave 
Their lives to thought and prayer, till they outlived 
The generation born with them, nor seemed 
Less aged than the hoary trees and rocks 
Around them;---and there have been holy men 
Who deemed it were not well to pass life thus. 
But let me often to these solitudes 
Retire, and in thy presence reassure 
My feeble virtue. Here its enemies, 
The passions, at thy plainer footsteps shrink 
Dost scare the world with falling thunderbolts, or fill, 
With all the waters of the firmament, 
The swift dark whirlwind that uproots the woods 
And drowns the village; when, at thy call, 
Uprises the great deep and throws himself 
Upon the continent, and overwhelms 
Its cities---who forgets not, at the sight 
Of these tremendous tokens of thy power, 
His pride, and lays his strifes and follies by? 
Oh, from these sterner aspects of thy face 
Spare me and mine, nor let us need the wrath 
Of the mad unchained elements to teach 
Who rules them. Be it ours to meditate, 
In these calm shades, thy milder majesty, 
And to the beautiful order of the works 
Learn to conform the order of our lives. 


Once upon a time there was a number
Pure and round like the sun
But alone very much alone

It began to reckon with itself

It divided multiplied itself
It subtracted added itself
And remained always alone

It stopped reckoning with itself
And shut itself up in its round
And sunny purity

Outside were left the fiery
Traces of its reckoning

They began to chase each other through the dark
To divide when they should have multiplied themselves
To subtract when they should have added themselves

That's what happens in the dark

And there was no one to ask it
To stop the traces
And to rub them out.

lend me twinkle star
I will glitter your tears
O vagabond of glamor! 
lay your soul on body armor

lend me sparkle moon
I will dazzle your wound
O spoiled soldier!

lend me a slice of prize
I will harmonize your daze
O afraid poet!

knowing they will never meet physically while on earthly
plains.

A transcendental form of intense and beautiful love beyond any
other in this worldly life.

Nothing to mar it's affection, romance always running high, 
lifting spirits daily in every moment as both hearts are 
filled with a joy from above.

A never-ending plethora of good feelings and plenty of intense
desires, all of them in a realm of beauty, never found here on
earth.

Waiting a lifetime for these special moments to happen, now 
that they have, feeling so joyful and at peace.

Nothing else can fulfill this wonderful feeling, it is the 
most intense love ever felt without any physical contact
whatsoever.

There is nothing like it's tender and loving caring, filling
your entire being and every particle and fiber within.

Never cheating on physical love, because it is beyond this 
world of earthly sins and can never be compared to it at all. 


sea​​, makes me become a wanderer
like the wind
crossed the doubt and the hope
then lay for a seconds
to enjoy the silence

sea​​, makes me become a fighter
like a rock
crashing, day and night
still silent, of course keep survive
though full of wounds and holes

sea​​, makes me become a hermit
like the wave
came and repeated
there's always room
there's always less

sea​​, where I become a man
met the meaning of creation
so, I can guide the other me


Open to everything, questioning it all as it appears before me in absolute finality.
A deepening silence giving me new perspectives of learning as I am led to a new form of wisdom in another dimension beyond life's comprehension. 


I have come far enough
from where I was not before
to have seen the things
looking in at me from through the open door

and have walked tonight
by myself
to see the moonlight
and see it as trees

and shapes more fearful
because I feared
what I did not know
but have wanted to know.

My facd is my own, I thought.
But you have seen it
turn into a thousand years.
I watched you cry.

I could not touch you.
I wanted very much to
touch you
but could not.

If it is dark
when this is given to you,
have care for its content
when the moon shines.

My face is my own.
My hands are my own.
My mouth is my own
but I am not.

Moon, moon,
whn you leave me alone
all the darkness is
an utter blackness,

a pit of fear,
a stench,
hands unreasonable
never to touch.

But I love you.
Do you love me.
What to say
when you see me. 


IN a coign of the cliff between lowland and highland,
     At the sea-down's edge between windward and lee,
Walled round with rocks as an inland island,
     The ghost of a garden fronts the sea.
A girdle of brushwood and thorn encloses
     The steep square slope of the blossomless bed
Where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its roses
          Now lie dead.

The fields fall southward, abrupt and broken,
     To the low last edge of the long lone land.
If a step should sound or a word be spoken,
     Would a ghost not rise at the strange guest's hand?
So long have the grey bare walks lain guestless,
     Through branches and briars if a man make way,
He shall find no life but the sea-wind's, restless
          Night and day.

The dense hard passage is blind and stifled
     That crawls by a track none turn to climb
To the strait waste place that the years have rifled
     Of all but the thorns that are touched not of time.
The thorns he spares when the rose is taken;
     The rocks are left when he wastes the plain.
The wind that wanders, the weeds wind-shaken,
          These remain.

Not a flower to be pressed of the foot that falls not;
     As the heart of a dead man the seed-plots are dry;
From the thicket of thorns whence the nightingale calls not,
     Could she call, there were never a rose to reply.
Over the meadows that blossom and wither
     Rings but the note of a sea-bird's song;
Only the sun and the rain come hither
          All year long.

The sun burns sere and the rain dishevels
     One gaunt bleak blossom of scentless breath.
Only the wind here hovers and revels
     In a round where life seems barren as death.
Here there was laughing of old, there was weeping,
     Haply, of lovers none ever will know,
Whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping
          Years ago.

Heart handfast in heart as they stood, "Look thither,"
     Did he whisper? "look forth from the flowers to the sea;
For the foam-flowers endure when the rose-blossoms wither,
     And men that love lightly may die---but we?"
And the same wind sang and the same waves whitened,
     And or ever the garden's last petals were shed,
In the lips that had whispered, the eyes that had lightened,
          Love was dead.

Or they loved their life through, and then went whither?
     And were one to the endÑbut what end who knows?
Love deep as the sea as a rose must wither,
     As the rose-red seaweed that mocks the rose.
Shall the dead take thought for the dead to love them ?
     What love was ever as deep as a grave ?
They are loveless now as the grass above them
          Or the wave.

All are at one now, roses and lovers,
     Not known of the cliffs and the fields and the sea.
Not a breath of the time that has been hovers
     In the air now soft with a summer to be.
Not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons hereafter 
     Of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep, 
When as they that are free now of weeping and laughter 
          We shall sleep.

Here death may deal not again for ever; 
     Here change may come not till all change end.
From the graves they have made they shall rise up never, 
     Who have left nought living to ravage and rend.
Earth, stones, and thorns of the wild ground growing, 
     While the sun and the rain live, these shall be;
Till a last wind's breath upon all these blowing
          Roll the sea.

Till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble,
     Till terrace and meadow the deep gulfs drink,
Till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble 
     The fields that lessen, the rocks that shrink,
Here now in his triumph where all things falter,
     Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread, 
As a god self-slain on his own strange altar,
          Death lies dead. 


Were it that you so shun me, 'cause you wish
(Cruels't) a fellow in your wretchednesse,
Or that you take some small ease in your owne
Torments, to heare another sadly groane,
I were most happy in my paines, to be
So truely blest, to be so curst by thee:
But oh! my cries to that doe rather adde,
Of which too much already thou hast had,
And thou art gladly sad to heare my moane;
Yet sadly hearst me with derision.

  Thou most unjust, that really dust know,
And feelst thyselfe the flames I burne in.  Oh!
How can you beg to be set loose from that
Consuming stake you binde another at?

  Uncharitablest both wayes, to denie
That pity me, for which yourself must dye,
To love not her loves you, yet know the pain
What 'tis to love, and not be lov'd againe.

  Flye on, flye on, swift Racer, untill she
Whom thou of all ador'st shall learne of thee
The pace t'outfly thee, and shall teach thee groan,
What terrour 'tis t'outgo and be outgon.

  Nor yet looke back, nor yet must we
Run then like spoakes in wheeles eternally,
And never overtake?  Be dragg'd on still
By the weake cordage of your untwin'd will
Round without hope of rest?  No, I will turne,
And with my goodnes boldly meete your scorne;
My goodnesse which Heav'n pardon, and that fate
MADE YOU HATE LOVE, AND FALL IN LOVE WITH HATE.

  But I am chang'd!  Bright reason, that did give
My soule a noble quicknes, made me live
One breath yet longer, and to will, and see
Hath reacht me pow'r to scorne as well as thee:
That thou, which proudly tramplest on my grave,
Thyselfe mightst fall, conquer'd my double slave:
That thou mightst, sinking in thy triumphs, moan,
And I triumph in my destruction.

  Hayle, holy cold! chaste temper, hayle! the fire
Rav'd o're my purer thoughts I feel t' expire,
And I am candied ice.  Yee pow'rs! if e're
I shall be forc't unto my sepulcher,
Or violently hurl'd into my urne,
Oh make me choose rather to freeze than burne. 


O lamb of gleaming richness! 
listen to firefly’s happiness
it moves the audience
to reject unbalance

O mentor of enchanting kindness! 
sense dialog of waves
it lure stoned heart
to rejuvenate

O gardener of exciting tenderness! 
touch bleakest of haunted crows
it surprise the sunrise
to dive in a rush

O shepherd of charming fertileness! 
look upon leaves of grass
it pull the joyful out
from scarf throat

O guard of amazing vigorousness! 
search for truest lightness
it absorb aura of secure
and give pleasure


Sitting under shade of the tree
To add one more and make it three
World may look sound and almost free

Nice imagination with wonderful ideas
Trying to woo her with my honest pleas
It was not new but stored in corner of mind
Always searching for match but not to find

I found her anyway as lucky to be called
She had in past many initiatives stalled
I too was not desperate but followed with zeal
She relented and agreed later as it was real

One may not find suitable match at all
He may go on making frantic efforts or several calls
It may come all of sudden at an appointed hour
You may rejoice with joy and role on the floor

One dreams of change in life when gains adulthood
He or she is forbidden to look in neighborhood
He may find it luckily in near by place
He had to search elsewhere if not found favorable in case

Sometimes you are drawn at females with outer beauty
All may fascinate us with their beautiful face and look so pretty
You may be making full circle around the city
With a hope that it may result in reality

"Who can be considered lucky? " that may be known little later
It may prove bone of contention or important subject matter
The time may prove good healer and ship may anchor safely
The realization may soon take over sooner or little later

Luck may favor and life may move on with great speed
You may go for big adventure without any greed
It may be highly motivated and in accordance with need
You have full burden on your solder for family to feed

She may come to be known as lucky star
You may not like to remain away or very far
She may also prefer to stay by the side of you
She may try her best to remain companion true


Life is like two wheels of motor
It moves on water as simple floater
What we need most is to push it with efforts
Always remain faithful by maintaining good rapports

Neither to crate bitterness nor driving any wedge
Always to remain together by cementing the bridge
We hinge on bare thread and try to reach an edge
The relation must last long till it has reached an age

No one is lucky but credit goes to all
In distress we pull together by responding to a call
It may be joint effort that may bring smile
Life may just move on and not stop for a while


The poet- a forum, 
Get everything there
With them.
With them
Your graphic design
Can be changed.
Welcome your own life
That is very sensitive. 


Old Davis owned a solid mica mountain
In Dalton that would someday make his fortune.
There'd been some Boston people out to see it:
And experts said that deep down in the mountain
The mica sheets were big as plate-glass windows.
He'd like to take me there and show it to me.

'I'll tell you what you show me. You remember
You said you knew the place where once, on Kinsman,
The early Mormons made a settlement
And built a stone baptismal font outdoors-
But Smith, or someone, called them off the mountain
To go West to a worse fight with the desert.
You said you'd seen the stone baptismal font.
Well, take me there.'

Someday I will.'

'Today.'

'Huh, that old bathtub, what is that to see?
Let's talk about it.'

'Let's go see the place.'

'To shut you up I'll tell you what I'll do:
I'll find that fountain if it takes all summer,
And both of our united strengths, to do it.'

'You've lost it, then?'

'Not so but I can find it.
No doubt it's grown up some to woods around it.
The mountain may have shifted since I saw it
In eighty-five.'

'As long ago as that?'

'If I remember rightly, it had sprung
A leak and emptied then. And forty years
Can do a good deal to bad masonry.
You won't see any Mormon swimming in it.
But you have said it, and we're off to find it.
Old as I am, I'm going to let myself
Be dragged by you all over everywhere- '
'I thought you were a guide.'

'I am a guide,
And that's why I can't decently refuse you.'

We made a day of it out of the world,
Ascending to descend to reascend.
The old man seriously took his bearings,
And spoke his doubts in every open place.

We came out on a look-off where we faced
A cliff, and on the cliff a bottle painted,
Or stained by vegetation from above,
A likeness to surprise the thrilly tourist.

'Well, if I haven't brought you to the fountain,
At least I've brought you to the famous Bottle.'

'I won't accept the substitute. It's empty.'

'So's everything.'

'I want my fountain.'

'I guess you'd find the fountain just as empty.
And anyway this tells me where I am.'

'Hadn't you long suspected where you were?'

'You mean miles from that Mormon settlement?
Look here, you treat your guide with due respect
If you don't want to spend the night outdoors.
I vow we must be near the place from where
The two converging slides, the avalanches,
On Marshall, look like donkey's ears.
We may as well see that and save the day.'

'Don't donkey's ears suggest we shake our own?'

You don't like nature. All you like is books.
What signify a donkey's cars and bottle,
However natural? Give you your books!
Well then, right here is where I show you books.
Come straight down off this mountain just as fast
As we can fall and keep a-bouncing on our feet.
It's hell for knees unless done hell-for-leather.'

Be ready, I thought, for almost anything.

We struck a road I didn't recognize,
But welcomed for the chance to lave my shoes
In dust once more. We followed this a mile,
Perhaps, to where it ended at a house
I didn't know was there. It was the kind
To bring me to for broad-board paneling.
I never saw so good a house deserted.

'Excuse me if I ask you in a window
That happens to be broken, Davis said.
'The outside doors as yet have held against us.
I want to introduce you to the people
Who used to live here. They were Robinsons.
You must have heard of Clara Robinson,
The poetess who wrote the book of verses
And had it published. It was all about
The posies on her inner windowsill,
And the birds on her outer windowsill,
And how she tended both, or had them tended:
She never tended anything herself.
She was 'shut in' for life. She lived her whole
Life long in bed, and wrote her things in bed.
I'll show You how she had her sills extended
To entertain the birds and hold the flowers.
Our business first's up attic with her books.'

We trod uncomfortably on crunching glass
Through a house stripped of everything
Except, it seemed, the poetess's poems.
Books, I should say!- if books are what is needed.
A whole edition in a packing case
That, overflowing like a horn of plenty,
Or like the poetess's heart of love,
Had spilled them near the window, toward the light
Where driven rain had wet and swollen them.
Enough to stock a village library-
Unfortunately all of one kind, though.
They bad been brought home from some publisher
And taken thus into the family.
Boys and bad hunters had known what to do
With stone and lead to unprotected glass:
Shatter it inward on the unswept floors.
How had the tender verse escaped their outrage?
By being invisible for what it was,
Or else by some remoteness that defied them
To find out what to do to hurt a poem.
Yet oh! the tempting flatness of a book,
To send it sailing out the attic window
Till it caught wind and, opening out its covers,
Tried to improve on sailing like a tile
By flying like a bird (silent in flight,
But all the burden of its body song),
Only to tumble like a stricken bird,
And lie in stones and bushes unretrieved.
Books were not thrown irreverently about.
They simply lay where someone now and then,
Having tried one, had dropped it at his feet
And left it lying where it fell rejected.
Here were all those the poetess's life
Had been too short to sell or give away.

'Take one,' Old Davis bade me graciously.

'Why not take two or three?'

'Take all you want.'
Good-looking books like that.' He picked one fresh
In virgin wrapper from deep in the box,
And stroked it with a horny-handed kindness.
He read in one and I read in another,
Both either looking for or finding something.

The attic wasps went missing by like bullets.

I was soon satisfied for the time being.

All the way home I kept remembering
The small book in my pocket. It was there.
The poetess had sighed, I knew, in heaven
At having eased her heart of one more copy-
Legitimately. My demand upon her,
Though slight, was a demand. She felt the tug.
In time she would be rid of all her books. 

A fountain pen, beautiful pen
The most precious ink pen was it
Not on brand name or quality terms
But it was a gift that I remember
Forever, as a fondly gift of a friend.

The first use of pen was a happy event
Being proud to write in white paper
With a writing pen, the ink pen
The gentleman's gift for my admission
The day of commencement in High school.

I showed the gift to all of my friends
Its quality, color, they appreciated
It was a happy event in my life that day
The beginner's day the usage of a pen
An innocent mind's expression of happiness.

Slowly and steadily I wrote my notes
Enjoyed the curves of letters, flowing ink
The nib, cap, and body shapes
Beautiful it felt in such a pleasantry.

The first pen and the first letters
Wrote in note book was so happy to enjoy
The inspiration, motivation I got there
From the good man of love to a student.

Not before dusk
Dare they appear.
Foxy tails brush 
The ground, as they
Race for cover 
At any sound.

Hunger will win, 
As  family
Rearing brings need.
Fox feeds warily, 
Maybe one night
Fear will recede. 


Remarkably steadfast, the 
mighty oak was standing up, as 
the thick rain was pounding at it.
I had come a faraway to unleash 
the tenacity.

The flesh and the moon.
It was the anniversary of ropes 
and shackles. You should not have
adored the distant dreams 
without touching them. The transcript 
was not ready. No template 
was perfect.

I would not know most of you.
That was a bliss. In blue and dark―
I will sail for nothingness. No more, 
no less. The chirping, synchronized trill 
of crickets, encourages to stand still, I listen 
without hearing.

I have come back to zero. 

Watching nature shower her blossoms all over the ground as
winds blow across trees, unlatching them from their branches
of safety.

Now lying on the ground, looking up, gently falling asleep
into other lands, escaping the fragile life that they knew
wouldn't last, because it was so very temporary. 

Faraway voices
like distant Indian drums
footsteps and heartbeats 
all rolled into one

A mind so fragile 
but yet so strong


Beautiful star with the crimson lips
And flagrant daffodil hair,
Come back, come back, in the shaking ships
O'er the much-overrated sea,
To the hearts that are sick for thee
With a woe worse than mal de mer-
O beautiful stars with the crimson lips
And the flagrant daffodil hair. -
O ship that shakes on the desolate sea,
Neath the flag of the wan White Star,
Thou bringest a brighter star with thee
From the land of the Philistine,
Where Niagara's reckoned fine
And Tupper is popular-
O ship that shakes on the desolate sea,
Neath the flag of the wan White Star. 

Silver key of the fountain of tears,
Where the spirit drinks till the brain is wild;
Softest grave of a thousand fears,
Where their mother, Care, like a drowsy child,
Is laid asleep in flowers. 

You are in me, I know.
You are the fragrant flower, 
You are the dazzling star.
You are in me, I know.
You have kept my history, 
You have shaped my geography.
And for you I have remained
Famous for all time. 


express freely
it may not look silly
your intention of retaining
the desire for love maintaining

it has to go from your direction
reach out to the people with real affection
show it to them  that it is love for peace
we all live with harmony and at ease

What may make others to wonder? 
As the clouds appear with thunder
it may rain heavily with shower
touching the roots for birth of flower

Who can stop  this natural process? 
you are gifted with an open access
You were observing it all along
nothing can go out of hand or wrong

You may not be able to convince
they can not be compelled to show or evince
for sacred love to be shown to fellow man
it is show of eagerness that any one can

it will be too late to regret or express sorrow
it can not be left for uncertainty or tomorrow
The love has its origin from eternity
it has to be expressed and shown with fine quality

You may have  solid return
sometimes you may have same turn
you are earning a praise from deprived
the long term effect can not be believed

The love and affection is not the commodity to show
it is essence of life and naturally grow
we are not used to difference of opinion
we need to appreciate if it existed in companion

There is enough room and  space to fall in line
it must be shown  that  you really feel it fine
the time pass off within no time to come
there won't be  anybody later on to welcome 

Show the willingness for all kind gesture
you have seen its utility for the future
the world  can be built effectively on good will
the stones should not be used with flowers to kill

It will have far reaching consequences and effect
the kindness is seen in hidden act
the love is understood by all and is common fact
it should be shown tenderly without any tact

There is no other short cut or easy option
the show of strength or wealth is ruled out of question
the simplicity is not seen with cordial relation
the joy and happiness mus come out with elation

the love can not be measured 
it is to be shown and assured
in its simplest form and must be shown
with warmth and affection to be fully grown


In all the corners of world you may find readers
There is no dearth of talent and you will find many leaders
Every household is having President Obama and Princess Margaret
You may find their wisdom call at any time and they will proudly state

They are running commentary and have solution for all the problems
Unfortunately no one has approached anytime and consulted them
They are ready to render ant kind of service and boost of their image
They are furious at not being taken note of and express open rage

"It happens all the time" they may confide to friend circle of their dismay
How important role is waiting for them and they are readily available to play
They have no other choice but fall in their line and render the service
But unfortunately they can’t blame the system as no one comes for their advice

All statistical data are generated by them for ready reference
They may express unhappiness that why people draw no interference
There were times when people use to rush to them for direction
Now they are jobless and find easy time to comment for action

It is very easy to set some body’s house on fire
It is also very easy to avail services from others on hire
People may move round you all the time and admire
You will have your area to work with as golden empire

There is no dearth of people to gain their support
Ships may anchor at free and all weather port
How bees are attracted toward sweets to make honey? 
People too may look towards you for easy money

It is said world can be made to bend
You act in good manner with feelers to send
They may work for you to crate impression
You will have all the right then for expression

Leaders are not crated over night
They have worked day and night for people’s rights
They claim to have far off vision with sight
They may prove their prophecy all the time right

You need go out for your rightful place
It is star studded gamble and mad race
You may be down with defeat and loose the face
There may be few who may emerge victorious in the case


World may listen to them with utmost care
They may want to know where they are 
There where about may be known world over
They will be provided with safety cover


I have alloweed free hand to friends
As they stand by and beautiful messages always send
What do they try to prove me as an  individual? 
It is real feeling and not casual

There is still something hidden in heart 
I fear somethiung may happen at the start
Will they come on my way and obstruct? 
Will they unnecessarily advise and instruct? 

I am so much attached to their presence
I sometimes do miss their absence
Is it true feeling wth its essence? 
They relieve my pain when I am so  much tense

This is one aspect and rules the scene
I wish to continue and am very keen
But I have some other priorities too
They are equally inportant and true

I feel it may detract my steps
Their atachmenet may prove as trap
It will be hinderence to what I think
It may take me down and sink

I can’t allow them to cross my way
They should  reasonably kept away
I have clear perception in mind
I may go positively for it to find

It may leave some bad remark
But I got to over come and embark
I will have to separate frienship and ship
I am the only person to sail or dip

It may prove hazardous or smooth
It may still speak the truth
This was purely my humble adventure
I had set it and seen the future

I may go down or sail through
Friends may try to rescue too
It will be still called a personal victory
I shall be able to raise the head without feeling sorry


let the free mind wonder
far away from noise and thunder
open sky without any barrier
the whole world  is open to make carrier
 
we are born free and must remain 
it must be exclusively our domain
how can we tie some one and keep in chain? 
It is useless to think such think in our brain

There has to be no slavery
We must show the courage and bravery
How can we chain our brethren? 
This causes us great concern

Many nations practice racial abuse
Basic human right violated and refused
Faith and belief are made to suffer
We should avoid such things even if we differ

The days are not far off  to be realized
Many have consented and obliged
some more are to follow and take lead
Countless still suffer and bleed

It may be counted as  blot
Humanity has suffered a lot
It must come to an end
Something needs to be improve our trend


Leaning out the window, head gently lying on an arm, 
looking skyward.

Wonder bouncing along with the clouds, happily playing
games within them.

Heart heavy with stress and everyday problems, yet this
mind is above, riding with the clouds, free and peace-
filled.

This discrepancy is a puzzle, but nothing more, there is
no worry or obsession with it.

Reveling in a funny mood, finding self caught, enjoying
what I do not understand.

Looking skyward, heart racing with the wind, blowing
clouds across the sky, freeing my mind, perpetuating 
the quiet myth of reality. 


A free soul
Is walking down the street
And I am also walking down the street
Where I saw that free soul
That is very old and frail


Oh lord see me
tell me I'm still free
I see non existent chains
wrapped around me

In a world of opportunity
I thought we was free
but I have a feeling
some ones watching me

Oh lord save me
take all these eyes off of me
why is there no peace
in the land of the free

It seems to me
the only way anybody can be free
is if they are not breathing


A respected man he is
A loved man he is
For his doings, for what he did
Yes he is a freedom fighter

He never stood and watched
He was part of them
Those who had hearts for the innocent people
But in the end he was a leader

He was the one who was punished
Punished for the wonderful things he did for the people
He did them with his power
Now he earn the people respect

They love him he’s their hero
He fought for them 
He fought for people’s freedom
Yes he is our freedom fighter

He never gave up no matter what
They never got him down no matter what they did
He stayed away from home and family
Living in locked house for years
Almost his man time in Roben Island

He is South Africa’s father
He is Africa’s father
He is the world’s father
He is every one’s father, a loved father
He is our freedom fighter  

                        A special dedication to: 
Mr. Nelson Mandela
Tata


I remember a good human being
who was a dedicated freedom fighter
Every violation on human rights
Every violation on child rights
Every time he questioned
Where justice was his intention
Where genuine freedom to humans
His inspiration and motive always
A man of values we saw in him
A man of virtuous human being
He guided the children to study well
And make a human mind self awareness
And to question every misdeed
And to follow the truthful life
I still remember with pride of him
A great human being the roll model ever
A freedom fighter a great human being. 

Freedom is not attained in single day
It has proved difficult and in tortuous way
How many precious lives are lost in process? 
Do we have any words for criticism to face? 

Whoever has laid down life may not go in waste
It requires sacrifice and untiring efforts to stand test
We may be able to core it out right or gain the freedom
If the path so chose is non-violence then it is really wisdom

No wars have been won with continued hostility and bloodshed
The revolution may be written as history of shame with no watershed
There may be holocaust and human misery to be swallowed later
The result may have been there but many may come to be known as traitor

Freedom fighters are termed as dacoits or law breakers
They will make enough propaganda for ready takers
It may help them for little times to come and regroup
This can be called as popular uprising and not as military coup

The mighty power has witness sudden downfall
They have bow under tremendous pressure and international call
They have fear of losing the out side support
No out side help can come through the busy ports

Freedom can be won through non-violence means too
It may minimize human loss and this is equally true
We have witnessed many prolonged and bloody revolutions
It has not helped to prove misery but only lead to power devolution

What even if freedom is gained in total sense? 
Has that got any relevance in its presence? 
Have we attained whatever was desired or expected from? 
The truth is bitter but to be explained to whom? 

Who will never accept our own theory of deception? 
How we remained under subjugation from inception? 
Why did we not rise in revolt and tried for solution? 
Did we try for it honestly and went for its dissolution? 

Will story be rewritten when brought facts in open? 
If so when it will find the light of the day and reopen? 
Who will shed the light and appreciate the sacrifice? 
The fact will be forgotten when people occupy the office


It is hard won struggle and must be preserved at all cost
The power should be shared and utilized for the most
Who knows it may prove acid test for days to come? 
Why not celebrate it with fun fare and welcome? 

It is unforgettable that freedom has cost us so much
We can’t afford to loose it again in a manner as such
Who will pardon us if we fail to cherish and protect
It has to be defended at all costs in fact


To free from yoke is called freedom
It is arising out of great struggle and wisdom 
It has no parallel in history and forgotten seldom
 It is great occasion as  freedom is won

It is considered holier than holy
It is celebrated with fun fare and enjoyed wholly
It is considered as unique occasion
It has been realized through wisdom  and vision

No one may prefer long domination
It will result into hatred and alienation
It will give rise to rebellion and mutiny
The powerful kingdom may be reduced  as small or tiny

It gives rise to national sentiments
There is always popular movement
It is backed by aspirations and hatred
They are all out to lead and to be led

Have  you even seen the joy and happiness in animal? 
When they are freed from captivity from arrival? 
We are human being and have some powerful thinking
How can  any  right person may prefer to witness sinking? 

Everybody is driven by simple logic
No one should be kept under yoke without any basic
It can not be the power game or show of strength
We are prepared to sacrifice and go to any length

We may be subjected to an act of omission and emission
But it an never be the sole aim of domination
No country may prefer to be called a slave nation

No one can keep it for long and rule with peace
It may be temporary lull or truce
The hidden lava may erupt to engulf  all
It may then amount to disappearance and fall

No one has survived or tolerated the subjugation
Either its s bloodbath or peaceful anticipation
The outcome is definitely on expected lines
The sun is emerging with powerful shine

It may add to more or existing agony and pain
The phase may be called critical and uncertain 
It might have played havoc with the system
It was so far not realized by them

It is possible that you may be  treated even shabbily 
You may face misrule and can't digest it happily
The freedom struggle had last long with enormous losses
Now there may be fight for becoming the head or bosses

We may have complete say in internal matter
We may be recognized as peace lover and trend setter
What are we going to offer to the free world? 
Will it be an attempt to push them  back to the  arena of cold

In the present world of freedom
We are the blessing ones
The inheritors of freedom
The great boon of human beings
We can freely discuss things
We can make our own comments
In the world of freedom
We are entitled the privileges 
Without hurting other's feelings
The great men's and teachings
We are entitled to study
We are going forward, as in any period. 

Don’t shut the door
As they are not meant for
Let the open fresh air to rush
Don’t’ make unnecessary push

It is not the love alone
Devastation is done by cyclone
Abusive words are hurled on phone
Injury is caused by pelting the stone

In olden days the defaulters were stoned to death
They were paraded open and to witness the wrath
You are completely shutting from your memory
You suffer from anguish and pain with sorry

I hate to shut off and sever the relation
Though it has spoiled the good equation
Who are we to hate and malign the bond? 
We are love hungry and very much fond

Think it has happened for something good
You were in dire need and have come out of wood
What would have happened if it had continued for long? 
Something untoward might have happened or wrong

The love nest can’t be built on lies
You can afford foes but not unreliable allies
It may ruin your place into pieces
You may cry it all the time for misses

Let love not suffer at the end
That is sign of good friend
You have enough time to mend
Set the pace with time as good trend

Love doesn’t mean to live together
To take care at all times and bother
To die for cause if of one suffers
Though on divergent path that may differ

We have known it for centuries
There had been lot of queries
No one has got yet satisfactory answer
It might have been enjoyed only by the fewer


So now I've taken leave of life, 
I thought you'd like to know, I still 
Possess a mind in love, oh wife; 
A soulful eye to catch a show of 
Silent beauty – ever yours; 
An ear to pick the metaphors
Of tonal dance in words you say, 
Grasp a thought in verse you pray
Inside your head, bemused of mind, 
Softly mournful, intertwined with
Understanding tears. 

I'll drift a whisper o'er to you
To tell that I am quietly calm; 
Keeping time till your adieu
To flesh, upon the carol of a
Psalm of consummation. Now! 
A fresh endeavour – we're forever
One together, resting yonder, 
Cross our open plane of blue.

A fresh start
In my life
Me again'my ego tripped over my id to become a superego
'twas a freudian slip that tripped into my consciousness
my superego tripped over my id to become my ego.

I think all minds are the same, just a theory you know
my conscious mind was full to the brim with superegos, and dreams
lie on the couch to spill the beans on your dreams

my interpretations are famous you know all minds are the same
give me a mind, and I will diagnose that you loved your mum, or dad
to put them in the sack your mind's on fire

get on that couch you theory I can tell,  I can read your mind
spill the beans come clean you are only a theory
if you are weary in mind it was those dreams last night that must be put right'

'i think sometimes
what we need most of all, 
more than money, possessions, 
sex, or accolades. 
is a friend.

someone to walk beside you, 
that you can talk to, 
and listen to. 
someone that you can
laugh with, cry with, fight with, 
be crazy with.  and they still
walk beside you.

someone who can see you
for what you are.  and they still
walk beside you

a friend!
and they say
the only way to find one
is to be one


Rocking and rolling down life's precious avenues of forgiveness, 
hoping it will touch me in the near future.
Appearing before me, a song in twilight, beckoning me to follow.
When I do, I run into my friend and we move on together, never to
be separated again in life on earth. 


Friendship is an amazing relationship, 
I don't know how others understand, 
I don't know how others withstand, 
It is something hidden and locked by a zip.

By the passage of time, 
A friend is gradually exposed, 
Constituents are often decomposed, 
Keeping the relations becomes a crime.

If the common interest, 
Is very much alike, 
And if the same thing, both dislike, 
The friend is nearer than nearest.

I never found dearer than dearest, 
Wish you good luck and all the best.

Friendship needs trust and sighting, 
Often a friend like a comedian of Hollywood, 
Says or writes some thing not very good
Ask him to explain his saying or writing.

Before changing your attitude or the behavior, 
You should inform your friend about his lacks, 
Don't make his heart a wall of cracks, 
You shouldn't be destroyer, act like a savior.


I didn't find a savior in my life, 
Except one, my lovely wife

Just around the corner is a friend indeed
When called upon in need
Sincere, vibrant, resilient
A flower in the garden
Or a companion in silence
Treading the path of life
Inch by inch or mile by mile
Leaving the footsteps behind
For us to remind
The time that we shared
With the heart that cared
It flew like a feather
Yet falls back from ether
Ever so gently to rest upon memory
Light and soft is remembrance's touch indeed
A listener, a teacher, a friend indeed
Just around the corner
When called upon in need. 

Sea, why you are keeping your turbulence
At all times while I smiles
Sea why you prefer to be scary
To the little children playing in your beach
Sea why you are angry sometimes
Some days with roaring sounds
Is it actually against the whole world
Or limited to the poor humans of land
Sometimes you are making disturbing attacks
The homes just like the bird cages you destroys
I knew you are trustworthy, and keeps words
Anything taken you promptly returns
Sea, why you are saline and always keeps salinity
Why it can't be changed in to sweet always
The children likes the sweet than saline water
Here I see you as my friend always. 


I was groping for a friend
in a net of eyes by the tube; 
I was looking for a brother
in a heart of dearness as old; 
I am sharing for a life
to a friend not yet known; 
I am trusting a brother
at a distance my dreams've shown.
I am talking to a friend
in a net of dearness by the tube; 
I am looking at his eyes
seemed like Moses of old.
I am sharing for a life
to a friend now yet called
at a distance shared a promise
for a newfound life yet assured; 
for at a distance, a friend
and a brother, now behold; 
he's there, I'm here yet embracing
in this little lovely world. 


We both decided to dress in style
when visiting our 'long ago' friend
knowing for sure, he'd wear a smile
if we were clad in up-to-date trend.
But the years have been 
and altered the scene.
Once we were pretty, long hair
with a sheen. 
Still, we possess  a genuine heart. 

Oh we've arrived, 
we are here, we are here! 
And now the beautiful kisses start. 


Who has room for a friend
Who has money to spend,
And a goblet of gold
For your fingers to hold,
At the wave of whose hand
Leap the salmon to land,
Drop the birds of the air,
Fall the stag and the hare.
Who has room for a friend
Who has money to lend?
We have room for a friend!

Who has room for a friend
Who has nothing to lend,
When the goblet of gold
Is as far from his hold
As the fleet-footed hare,
Or the birds of the air.
Who has room for a friend
Who has nothing to spend?
We know not such a friend. 


Good is a friend in need
Of people
In his house
Every sunday for the morning and evening service
Good is a friend that is in need
Of love also
Good is in need of people
Who can forgive each other each day
That they live their lives
Here on earth


What has friendship got to do in times of need? 
A thousand reasons  perhaps for one to see
Someone in collaboration with unlikely times. , 

Thus, I turn to the Great Provider for counsel
And wisdom for such trial, 
For I too have also been there

Sometime, somewhere buddy! 
I could not offer you fortune, 
For I have none but perhaps
Some note to cheer you up


Like the earthworm burrowing in mud
To fit in some kind of home and feel 'comfy'

Yes, that is you all the while, 
Laughing our heartaches to no end

Until they got tired of you; 
Such loving  care I find  in you, my friend-
A medicine to a searching soul for passion. 

Somber thoughts, saddened feelings, hearing that
a friend is again in the hospital with major 
problems.

Praying intently, specifically for her healing
here on earth, so we can again do things together, 
musically. 


A friend is a mirror, 
an image with no error, 
as long as you're before, 
a truthful, can't ignore, 
how much you are pretty, 
how much you are ugly, 
tells you not any other, 
when you leave the mirror, 
he forgets your image.
Face truth with courage.


A friend is also
Someone to talk with
Someone to help one get through it all
A friend is also
Years of sharing thoughts and books
A way of seeing the world
Someone who strengthens
One’s own belief 
Encouragement, Help
Laughter and Enjoyment 
Thank you for being 
My friend Yaakov
I’ll miss you 



A friend is gone
A true friend
A pleasure to be with
The world is diminished 
More lonely and sad
Without him. 

I need a friend, 
A friend like you, 
A friend that will always be here with me through my roughest times, 
Everyone needs a friend like you, 
You have always been there for me through my roughest times, 
You are a great friend, 
Greatest friend I can ask for, 
You’re my best friend, 
A friend that everyone needs, 
A friend like you indeed a great friend, 
I am glad that I have you as my friend. 

Puffs a bright light from the magic of a fay, 
Very much through his wand of marvels to play
A baby dragon to form so cute and gay, 
Love has in that innocence, its way
Tender that way to touch the fay's heart to stay
To be fond of the dragon with wings to sway
The air to let it up floating without delay.
The fay young, with none to play with till this day, 
So has created a playmate that he may
Have a true loving friend with warmth's every ray. 


An untimely death of a dear friend
Never it is possible to forget
A life long friendship that expected
But death took away the life.

Still memories of the best moments
Parted with the departed friend
Ever it is an asset for a future life
Which the death couldn't take away.

Death, always a winner in the play
Death, always finding its way
Nature entrusted the duty to it
We have to accept the reality in principle. 

SICKNESS brought me this
Thought, in that scale of his:
Why should I be dismayed
Though flame had burned the whole
World, as it were a coal,
Now I have seen it weighed
Against a soul


Strumming the harp of intense sorrow as it tugs at his
heart incessantly.

Keeping awake with floods of tears, soaking pillows 
nightly with the love of a loved one.

Thoroughly bereft and falling into the circumference of
despicable life, lost and forgotten, love having left
for another horizon, one where there is no way to follow.

Shrouded in darkness, taking away even a soul by insistence
of death's remaining heartbreak.

So lonely, abject, forlornly seeking the solace of suicide, 
wanting not to live another minute without her smile and
look of love for him in her eyes.

When death comes and grabs the being of your entire life 
and affection, what is left? 


Nothing.

Life departs from a being also, paradise has been lost
forever and here he is, standing on empty shores of 
tomorrow, no hopes left to begin again. 

Rolling restlessly down life's roads, wanting more than ever to be expressed in platitudes of friends.
Talking, spreading conversations in the wayward winds, wandering down pathways of yesterday.
Meeting once in the past, we became friends forever, joining in repasts through the years.
Exchanging thoughts and loving the time we spent together while rolling restlessly down life's roads. 


One there is, above all others,
Well deserves the name of friend;
His is love beyond a brother's,
Costly, free, and knows no end:
They who once his kindness prove,
Find it everlasting love! 

Which of all our friends to save us,
Could or would have shed their blood?
This was boundless love indeed!

Men, when raised to lofty stations,
Often know their friends no more;
Slight and scorn their poor relations
Though they valued them before.
But our Saviour always owns
Those whom he redeemed with groans. 

When he lived on earth abased,
Friend of sinners was his name;
Now, above all glory raised,
He rejoices in the same:
Still he calls them brethren, friends,
And to all their wants attends. 

Could we bear from one another,
What he daily bears from us?
Yet this glorious Friend and Brother,
Loves us though we treat him thus:
Though for good we render ill,
He accounts us brethren still. 

O for grace our hearts to soften!
We, alas! forget too often,
What a Friend we have above:
But when home our souls are brought,
We will love thee as we ought. 

Friendship that helps everyone
The best friend is a real friend
Who give timely advises and inspiration
He joins to the adventures and jointly enjoys
He knows the mindful thoughts of dear friend
And cautions the dangers when it approaches
Cheats never, helps more a friendship more useful
The best friend is the real friend. 


A  friend  to  light  a  candle
When  darkness  overcomes.
A  friend  to  hold  you  closer
When  distant  thunder  drums.

A  friend  to  gently  tie  you
When  sirens  sing  your  name.
A  friend  with  words  to  soothe  you
When  life's  a  losing  game.

A  friend  to  cool  your  passions
When  passions  take  their  hold.
A  friend  to  warm you  gently
When  a  frozen  heart's  too  cold.

A  friend  to  spread  contentment 
As  seasons  wax  and  wane, 
Make  sense  of  love's  confusion, 
And  bear  life's  grief  and  pain.

A  friend  who  knows  this  season 
Of  love; both  yours  and  mine.
A  friend, another  reason, 
To  send  this  Valentine. 


We were challenged by The Dingoes - they're the pride of Squatter's Gap-
To a friendly game of football on the flat by Devil's Trap.
And we went along on horses, sworn to triumph in the game,
For the honour of Gyp's Diggings, and the glory of the same.

And we took the challenge with us. It was beautiful to see,
With its lovely curly letters, at its pretty filigree.
It was very gently worded, and it made us all feel good,
For it breathed the sweetest sentiments of peace and brotherhood.

We had Chang, and Trucker Hogan, and the man who licked The Plug,
Also Heggarty, and Hoolahan, and Peter Scott, the pug;
And we wore our knuckle-dusters, and we took a keg on tap
To our friendly game of football with The Dingoes at The Gap.

All the fellows came to meet us, and we spoke like brothers dear.
They'd a tip-dray full of tucker, and a waggon load of beer,
And some lint done up in bundles; so we reckoned there'd be fun
Ere our friendly game of football with the Dingo Club was done.

Their umpire was a homely man, a stranger to the push,
With a sweet, deceitful calmness, and a flavour of the bush.
He declared he didn't know the game, but promised on his oath
To see fair and square between the teams, or paralyse them both.

Then we bounced the ball and started, and for twenty minutes quite
We observed a proper courtesy and a heavenly sense of right,
Butin a handy patch of mud,
And the hero rose up, chewing dirt, and famishing for blood.

Simple Simonsen, the umpire, sorted out the happy pair,
And he found a pitch to suit them, and we left them fighting there;
But The Conqueror and Cop-Out met with cries of rage and pain,
And wild horses couldn't part those ancient enemies again.

So the umpire dragged them from the ruck, and pegged them off a patch,
And then gave his best attention to the slugging and the match.
You could hardly wish to come across a fairer-minded chap
For a friendly game of football than that umpire at The Gap.

In a while young Smith, and Henty, and Blue Ben, and Dick, and Blake,
Chose their partners from The Dingoes, and went pounding for the cake.
Timmy Hogan hit the umpire, and was promptly put to bed
'Neath the ammunition waggon, with a bolus on his head.

Feeling lonely-like, Magee took on a local star named Bent,
And four others started fighting to avoid an argument:
So Simonsen postponed the game, for fear some slight mishap
Might disturb the pleasant feeling then prevailing at The Gap.

Sixty seconds later twenty lively couples held the floor,
And the air was full of whiskers, and the grass was tinged with gore,
And the umpire kept good order in the interests of peace,
Whilst the people, to oblige him, sat severely on the p'lice.

Well, we fought the friendly game out, but I couldn't say who won;
We were all stretched out on shutters when the glorious day was done;
Both the constables had vanished; one was carried off to bunk,
And the umpire was exhausted, and the populace was drunk.

But we've written out a paper, with good Father Feeley's aid,
Breathing brotherly affection; and the challenge is conveyed
To the Dingo Club at Squatter's, and another friendly game
Will eventuate at this end, on the flat below the claim.

We have pressed The Gap to bring their central umpire if they can-
Here we honestly admire him as a fair and decent man-
And we're building on a pleasant time beside the Phoenix slums,
For The Giant feels he's got a call to plug him if he comes. 


A friendship is a bond you have with someone else. 
A friendship is special just like one's gift. 
A friendship is a time to share your feelings. 
A friendship is something very remembering. 
A friendship is something I truly have. 
A friendship is something everyone should want to last. 
A friend is there to be by your side. 
A friend is there to tell you everything is going to be alright.

A friendship Into every life a little rain must fall

Call me any time you need an umbrella


I take inspiration from the gentleman
Who is passing through precious old age
But keeps smart and acts swiftly
Makes his own positive thoughts
Giving counsels to the needy in time
The man who is adjusted to the modern world
A selfie in hands, face book, and whatsup
Fearing none other than his own conscience
The truth, justice, equality, and wise thoughts
Ever he makes his own ways on this life.
How can such a man avoid the friendship. 

Someone walks in deep ravines
Where his foot is a little hurt
With sharpened stones here and there
Still he prefers the walk to enjoy
To have the little joyous moments of life
The relation between man and nature
Here the birds calls on their friend
Come on, our dear and take rest
Under this tree shade to have the cool breeze
We are here to make you happy
Our voice nature given with blessing
Which misses to you in real life
Where you are busily engaged
This deep ravine though looks a little different
It is more or less good than your surface roads
Which you spent crores to maintain
Here the ways are not man made
Here the ways are made by the great nature
The creativity on making meadows in its own place
Destroying altogether in heavy flood
We the birds and animals preciously keeps it on
To main the equilibrium to this wonderful universe. 

The sea boasts, I am all powerful
I bless all of you for your own comforts
Less damages I makes on you, 
And preferring to enjoy your presence
In Catamaran, boats, and fishing vessels
You catches from  me the fishes
Like a large aquarium somewhere maintained
The world class facility there I made
You traveled through me with small ships
And found new nations, and civilizations
People, fortunes, natural wealth and all
You made yourself prosperous through years
I was ever glad in humans prospering
But in return you can provide me less polluted
And we can maintain a friendship throughout
As the lovely mother takes her little son. 


Struggling to survive in a foreign land
I met an old lady, working on a small piece of quilt
"Lovely", I remarked
Proudly she showed me nine more pieces made by her friends
To complete the mosaic of her quilt
Nuance of her wrinkled face were filled with cherished memories of a lifetime
"Do you have friends? " She asked after a pause
A quilt needle pierced through my heart
"No, " I said quietly, " All were left behind

"
That night in my cold empty room
Tears rolling from my eyes
I longed for the placid familiarity of my homeland
For the warmth of a friendship quilt
At midnight moon came out smiling from the clouds
In its pellucid light from window pane
A checkered pattern emerged on the wall
The flat white squares on the wall
Were dappled with the leaves and tree branches hanging in the sash
Silhouette of a perfect quilt breathing life in still room-
Made me smile through my tears
I opened the window
Standing in the dark room, listening to the quaint causerie 
Of stars and moon, of wind and leaves
I watched the ebullition of benevolence from Nature
Sweeping through my backyard
Clairvoyance? 
For a sylph whispered from the woods
"You are not alone"

A frightened heart
Got frightened with the lightening and thunder
That the sky had striked  inside of that frightened heart
Because I am not able to repair that frightened heart


After a sacred kill
Many centuries have passed for us
living without you.
Thyme will preserve you body, 
your brain, syndrome, for our children.

When the apocalypse starts, 
Arctica would keep the seeds, grains, alive
and every death will be accounted for.
From mars the ice will come.
And people will bow before
the chariot of sun for breaking the stars.

Why the sadness is pouring? 
I was not afraid of falling saints, 
of big poles, but the masks of bones and skull.
Those veils are burning. The grandmothers
look at the blue sky and again we are
distributing our secrets to poor. 

A huge python crawls in dream again
Massive shadowy figure of long grey serpent
Moves with tremendous force in cold obscurity
Shiva's faithful companion, 
A garland of grace and beauty
Wrapped around his blue neck so gingerly.

Tonight he wasn't there
As an accomplice of ocean churning
For seekers of immortality
Tonight he was an ordained employee of death
In cold blooded merciless cruelty destroying, 
Devouring all what was built with love and care.

Walls and bricks fall all around 
Dust and smoke blind the vision
Choking me out of my breath
I stood there in darkness shaking and trembling
Oh! How I wished to save just a little nook.

A silent prayer, a wishful thinking
Echoed in fearful heart
Hope of a tiny dwelling to be spared
Amid the fallen debris of rocks and iron
His coils and fang will have mercy
For a little room where the most delicate
The most helpless of all 
A little innocent life lies
Blissfully unaware of lurking danger.

Just then I break away from sleep
All apprehension of that fateful event stops
A sense of relief takes over
Akin to when an earthquake shakes every thing
But in a next moment of afferent sensation
When the earth becomes still
One feels himself alive again.

Fear grips my heart 
A wakeful consciousness
Still disoriented 
Entwined with truth and illusion
Haunted by the vivid memory 
Of a terrifying, wretched moment
Struggles to regain and recompose.

For now all is calm in dark night
In quiet submission whatever was spared 
Stirs back to life again
Cobra wraps in his coils whoever
Or what so ever it wishes to wring
And leaves the rest unscathed. 


A BAG which was left and not only taken but turned away was not found. The place was shown to be very like the last time. A piece was not exchanged, not a bit of it, a piece was left over. The rest was mismanaged. 


A frisky lamb 
And a frisky child 
Playing their pranks 
In a cowslip meadow: 
The sky all blue 
And the air all mild 
And the fields all sun 
And the lanes half shadow. 




Now you know some fellahs, they want fame and fortune 
Yeah, and other fellahs they just wanna swing 
But all I wanted all my life 
Was a TV set and a truck and a wife 
And a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing. 

Yeah the TV and the truck I got on credit. 
And I got that girl with a little old Woolworth ring 
And life was warm and life was sweet 
But still, it was kinda incomplete 
Without a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing. 

chorus: 
Hey, John you walk the line, 
Do 'Deelia' one more time 
And when you do them Cottonfields 
You warm this heart of mine. 

So, one day I thought, Hey, I'm gonna do it! 
(That's what I said) 
So, I mortgaged the farm and pawned her wedding ring. 
I sold the gold tooth out of my mouth 
And jumped in the pickup and headed South. 
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing. 

I hit Nashville cold and wet and hungry. 
I said, 'I'm here, bring him on let him do his thing.' 
But they told me down at the Old Pit Grill 
I'd have to go all the way to Andersonville 
For a front row seat to hear ole Jonny sing. 

I found his house knocked on the door and it was opened 
By a brown-haired girl and a baby with a teethin' ring. 
I said 'I seen you somewhere before 
but don't stand there and block the door 
I want a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.' 

(chorus) 

She said I'd have to go down to The Opry 
And the feller there said I'd have to wait till Spring. 
He said, 'We've been sold out for months and months 
And this poor insane fellah wants 
A front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.' 

Well, he said a couple more things, and I started cryin' 
And then he laughed at me and that's when I started to swing. 
Well I bust through the doors in a roaring rage, 
Crawled over the crowd till I reached the stage 
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing. 

(chrous) 

Then some crazy guard started shootin' 
I shot back, and the next thing I know I was winged 
and on the floor 
When a guy in a voice kinda deep and low 
Says, 'Boy that's a mighty long way to go 
For a front row seat to hear ANYBODY sing.' 

And I guess that judge, he weren't no music lover. 
I got fifteen months but that don't mean a thing. 
Cos' yesterday in the prison yard 
A show come through and HAR! de HAR! 
I had a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing. 

(chorus plus some typical Shel ranting and raving)
Mother: Alice, dear, what ails you,
Dazed and white and shaken? 
Has the chill night numbed you? 
Is it fright you have taken? 

Alice: Mother I am very well,
I felt never better; 
Mother, do not hold me so,
Let me write my letter.

Mother: Sweet, my dear, what ails you? 

Alice: No, but I am well.
The night was cold and frosty,
There's no more to tell.


Mother: Ay, the night was frosty,
Coldly gaped the moon,
Yet the birds seemed twittering
Through green boughs of June.

Soft and thick the snow lay,
Stars danced in the sky.
Not all the lambs of May-day
Skip so bold and high.

Your feet were dancing, Alice,
Seemed to dance on air,
You looked a ghost or angel
In the starlight there.

Your eyes were frosted starlight,
Your heart, fire, and snow.
Who was it said 'I love you? '

Alice: Mother, let me go

My Heart
a frozen door
closed by the hands of greed

A moment 
one has chose
to shackle and chain down

My Heart
an open door
by one I have never met

space/time
will never change
the miracle she performed.



The afternoon of summer folds
Its warm arms round the marigolds,

And with its gleaming fingers, pets
The watered pinks and violets

That from the casement vases spill,
Over the cottage window-sill,

Their fragrance down the garden walks
Where droop the dry-mouthed hollyhocks.

How vividly the sunshine scrawls
The grape-vine shadows on the walls!

How like a truant swings the breeze
In high boughs of the apple-trees!

The slender 'free-stone' lifts aloof,
Full languidly above the roof,

A hoard of fruitage, stamped with gold
And precious mintings manifold.

High up, through curled green leaves, a pear
Hangs hot with ripeness here and there.

Beneath the sagging trellisings,
In lush, lack-lustre clusterings,

Great torpid grapes, all fattened through
With moon and sunshine, shade and dew,

Until their swollen girths express
But forms of limp deliciousness--

Drugged to an indolence divine
With heaven's own sacramental wine. 


You complete me, 
Like the milk for my cereal 
In my favourite bowl
Or a cup of sugar in a chocolate cake recipe

The pinch of salt you add to my life
Makes the eggs you scrambled with your smile
So much better to eat

You provide a teaspoon of honey
when I need a cup of tea to soothe
my scattered thoughts
even though I know you will piece me back together
without my knowing it.

You are the spine that holds this tender body together
even if it is your touch that makes me melt
when we are alone.

Once I am blended with your sweetness
and stirred by your kisses, 
This love will be delicious 
and served for your pleasure. 


How much a person can be persuaded to fall in line? 
To what extent he can be made comfortable and feel fine? 
This is debatable point and must be paid full attention
It is very much crucial and deserves circulation and full mention

At certain level, weak human mind surrenders to circumstances
He is forced end the life out of despair at once
Such stage can be warded off with some positive infusion
It can save the situation arising out of confusion

Solace and advice form two formidable pillars for strength
The individual can be persuaded to act on same wave length
The time help and proper guidance can bring him new hope
Otherwise life is considered stiff challenge as if to walk on rope


Hope and despair can drive a person to nut
There may be many ifs and buts
Still doors are not closed for future recovery
Timely help and consolation is not new discovery

When person is seized of certain problems
No amount of persuasion may work for them
It is taken and considered as futile attempt 
It may leave him helpless with no option left

It is not that he is not aware of the escape routes
Only problem is he is unable to reach the end or roots
This leaves him in the helpless state with no answer
No one may stand by him and extend possible help ever

It is human psychology not to board a sinking ship
It is also customary to choose set path as followed by sheep
No may try for new route to explore the possibility
There is hardly any doubt for his ability 

Two sweet words can perform miracle
It helps to change the reverse cycle
It gives person a respite and chance to think
One a risk is over then ship may be salvaged and not sink

It can be guided back to calling port
The individual too can recover with active support
Once anchored at free berth the service can be rendered
The person too can be restored to confidence when offered


It helps to build and recover the lost ground
Ups and down can be in any field and found
One may face reversals or setbacks despite being cautious
The risk involved in it is not temper ray but always continuous 

It is individual’s best efforts and reliance
It may help him to come out even if at odd or variance
The most important part is application of mind and compliance
The immediate sense of acknowledging the reversal and not defiance




To a Lady: 

You love your children- 
you are a good mother; 

you love your husband- 
you are a good wife; 

you love your family- 
you are a good homemaker; 

you love your country- 
you are a good patriot; 
But still not a full man.

If you loved both your children
and the whole world
 
both your husband
and the whole world
 
both your family
and the whole world
 
both your country
and the whole world

only then you would be a full man.


To a Man: 

You love your children- 
you are a good father; 

you love your wife- 
you are a good husband; 

you love your family- 
you are a good guardian; 

you love your country- 
you are a good patriot; 
But still not a full man.

If you loved both your children
and the whole world
 
both your wife
and the whole world
 
both your family
and the whole world
 
both your country
and the whole world

only then you would be a full man. 


What is part time love or full time? 
It is not to be object prime
love is not commodity
it has to be blended with fine  quality

it is slur on the name of sacred bond
Everybody adore it and  are secretly fond of
it can't be  brought  in at once  or traded
The fragrance  and sweetness may sometimes be faded

how could it be exchanged even for silly thought? 
so much upheaval and many wars have been fought 
The opinion or discussion can't be sought 
it is totally absurd  to opine and get caught


A fuller figured woman
should never be ashamed
of the ampleness upon her
nor the need to rearrange
her wardrobe every season
as the curves fight with her clothes
oh god save me from the skinny
i've never fancied one of those.

A fuller figured woman
should not put out the light
when she gradually undresses
and prepares herself for night
for the fuller figured woman
is not someone to be scorned
for her body won't discomfort you
and she'll always keep you warm. 


Pale, at its ghastly noon,
    Pauses above the death-still wood--the moon;
    The night-sprite, sighing, through the dim air stirs;
      The clouds descend in rain;
      Mourning, the wan stars wane,
    Flickering like dying lamps in sepulchres!
    Haggard as spectres--vision-like and dumb,
      Dark with the pomp of death, and moving slow,
    Towards that sad lair the pale procession come
      Where the grave closes on the night below.

    With dim, deep-sunken eye,
    Crutched on his staff, who trembles tottering by?
    As wrung from out the shattered heart, one groan
    Breaks the deep hush alone!
    Crushed by the iron fate, he seems to gather
      All life's last strength to stagger to the bier,
    And hearken--Do these cold lips murmur "Father?"
      The sharp rain, drizzling through that place of fear,
    Pierces the bones gnawed fleshless by despair,
    And the heart's horror stirs the silver hair.

    Fresh bleed the fiery wounds
      Through all that agonizing heart undone--
    Still on the voiceless lips "my Father" sounds,
      And still the childless Father murmurs "Son!"
    Ice-cold--ice-cold, in that white shroud he lies--
      Thy sweet and golden dreams all vanished there--
    The sweet and golden name of "Father" dies
    Into thy curse,--ice-cold--ice-cold--he lies!
      Dead, what thy life's delight and Eden were!

    Mild, as when, fresh from the arms of Aurora,
      While the air like Elysium is smiling above,
    Steeped in rose-breathing odors, the darling of Flora
      Wantons over the blooms on his winglets of love.
    So gay, o'er the meads, went his footsteps in bliss,
      The silver wave mirrored the smile of his face;
    Delight, like a flame, kindled up at his kiss,
      And the heart of the maid was the prey of his chase.

    Boldly he sprang to the strife of the world,
      As a deer to the mountain-top carelessly springs;
    As an eagle whose plumes to the sun are unfurled,
      Swept his hope round the heaven on its limitless wings.
    Proud as a war-horse that chafes at the rein,
      That, kingly, exults in the storm of the brave;
    That throws to the wind the wild stream of its mane,
      Strode he forth by the prince and the slave!

    Life like a spring day, serene and divine,
      In the star of the morning went by as a trance;
    His murmurs he drowned in the gold of the wine,
      And his sorrows were borne on the wave of the dance.

    Worlds lay concealed in the hopes of his youth!--
      When once he shall ripen to manhood and fame!
    Fond father exult!--In the germs of his youth
      What harvests are destined for manhood and fame!

    Not to be was that manhood!--The death-bell is knelling,
      The hinge of the death-vault creaks harsh on the ears--
    How dismal, O Death, is the place of thy dwelling!
      Not to be was that manhood!--Flow on, bitter tears!
    Go, beloved, thy path to the sun,
      Rise, world upon world, with the perfect to rest;
    Go--quaff the delight which thy spirit has won,
      And escape from our grief in the Halls of the Blest.

    Again (in that thought what a healing is found!)
      To meet in the Eden to which thou art fled!--
    Hark, the coffin sinks down with a dull, sullen sound,
      And the ropes rattle over the sleep of the dead.
    And we cling to each other!--O Grave, he is thine!
      The eye tells the woe that is mute to the ears--
    And we dare to resent what we grudge to resign,
      Till the heart's sinful murmur is choked in its tears.
    Pale at its ghastly noon,
    Pauses above the death-still wood--the moon!
    The night-sprite, sighing, through the dim air stirs:
      The clouds descend in rain;
      Mourning, the wan stars wane,
    Flickering like dying lamps in sepulchres.
    The dull clods swell into the sullen mound;
      Earth, one look yet upon the prey we gave!
    The grave locks up the treasure it has found;
    Higher and higher swells the sullen mound--
      Never gives back the grave


i carefully place 
myself on the pyre of 
dreams that desert me 
from time to time.  

my ears intently tune 
themselves to hear 
the message of futility 
conveyed through 
the crackling of chips 

everywhere on this island 
insulated by the salt waters 
my soul roams about in 
desperation for a release



Through airy roads he wings his instant flight
To purer regions of celestial light;
Enlarg'd he sees unnumber'd systems roll,
Beneath him sees the universal whole,
Planets on planets run their destin'd round,
And circling wonders fill the vast profound.
Th' ethereal now, and now th' empyreal skies
With growing splendors strike his wond'ring eyes:
The angels view him with delight unknown,
Press his soft hand, and seat him on his throne;
Then smilling thus: 'To this divine abode,
'Thrice welcome thou.'  The raptur'd babe replies,
'E'er vice triumphant had possess'd my heart,
'E'er yet the tempter had beguil d my heart,
'E'er yet on sin's base actions I was bent,
'E'er yet I knew temptation's dire intent;
'E'er yet the lash for horrid crimes I felt,
'E'er vanity had led my way to guilt,
'But, soon arriv'd at my celestial goal,
'Full glories rush on my expanding soul.'
Joyful he spoke: exulting cherubs round
Clapt their glad wings, the heav'nly vaults resound.
  Say, parents, why this unavailing moan?
Why heave your pensive bosoms with the groan?
To Charles, the happy subject of my song,
A brighter world, and nobler strains belong.
Say would you tear him from the realms above
By thoughtless wishes, and prepost'rous love?
Doth his felicity increase your pain?
Or could you welcome to this world again
The heir of bliss? with a superior air
Methinks he answers with a smile severe,
'Thrones and dominions cannot tempt me there.'
  But still you cry, 'Can we the sigh borbear,
'And still and still must we not pour the tear?
'Our only hope, more dear than vital breath,
'Twelve moons revolv'd, becomes the prey of death;
'Delightful infant, nightly visions give
'Thee to our arms, and we with joy receive,
'We fain would clasp the Phantom to our breast,
'The Phantom flies, and leaves the soul unblest.'
  To yon bright regions let your faith ascend,
Prepare to join your dearest infant friend
In pleasures without measure, without end. 


That is a funeral song
For a dear friend
That had died a few days ago
He left us so fast
That he didn't had the  time to say good bye 
To us
Because when we receive the news from his wife
Saying that he died
I thought that I was having a nightmare
While I was watching tv


Oldie is dreamy 
Really it is funny
Sun may not have remained sunny
It might have been witnessed by you and not by many

It might have come out from west
You might have gone for its test
Your may be searching for the rest
You prove to be dreamer and try for best

We see so many irrelevant things
It certainly to do something
The chain of thoughts goes on continuously
It is useless thinking if we admit honestly

We can’t base our plan on dreamy side
The reality and fact may remain open very wide
It may have pleasant side in the isolation
It has nothing to do with facts or relation


Still it is nice resort
We have so many comforts
Things move on as per our wish
The end has got very nice finish

Why it makes you so much happy? 
You find beautiful girls to marry? 
The sun doesn’t get set at all
It is always pleasant and happy call

Reveal it not for even for amusement
You may invite adverse comments
For you it may be fine moment
Enjoy it to self and make good movement


What do I search in my fertile mind? 
What it actually probes and what it finds? 
Is it material gain or natural thrust? 
All should be answered and it is must

I wonder at nature’s magical show
I find mountains clad with snow
I simply think and gaze through window
I feel cool breeze in air and words grow

I wave my hand in the air
When find nothing, scratch the hair
Mind simply wonder and try to collect
I grab them hastily and recollect

This is how I have come into being
I have kingdom and act as king
I may act and unveil the forgotten gate
They may eventually flow at any rate

I feel gentle touch when thoughts invade
Do they say bye or offer me a shade
I sit underneath the tree and feel its flow
Face shine beautifully with fine glow

Reddishness rush and I hear something
It is musical note in the ears to ring
What is this little whispering to suggest? 
It is difficult to understand and digest

I may try to prove as nature’s child
Prefer to be hard but always mild
Go as usual without being wild
Words to be smooth and very kind

It is me and no one else
No one dares and openly tells
I am the only one to decide the destiny
It is the way I rule the kingdom tiny

I may sit idly and think seriously of the past
How quickly it has ended in succession very last
I find nothing new in the morning
What else can be there in the evening? 


If need be I can end seclusion
It may be good to find lovely inclusion
Why don’t I share my treasured philosophy? 
Will it reward me with any of the trophy? 

Well, this has haunted me quite a lot
Heart and mind many times fought
Still it prevails with lot of confusion
I must see it with new concept and vision

I must reach at the end of the road
It has to be done without bearing any load
I am sure it will deliver very good result
I need not ask anybody or consult

It may open new gate and air may rush in
Cool mind to open and shun the ideas of any sin
It may invite scores of many things to usher
Joy and happiness all over when some one may whisper


Forts, garrisons, the old memories
Memories of the past through the old forts
Here the remains of conquest, killing sprees
Where humans acted in such brutal ways
For power, kingdom, subjugation
Forming territories, as their own
Fixing the boundaries, providing security
The world of conflicts of earlier eras
Every old brick  seems to be red
Every stone seems to be crying of old memory
The world of conquests, kingdoms
The poor humans ever in tragic states
They got better freedom in modern times
With hopes they tries to make a living
Still they are not let in peace
Only expect better future in good ways. 


Stranded in a small room filled with lovely music and a variety of songs being sung.
Watching the farthest door open at my glance, beckoning 
me to approach and go on through to my future destiny, 

Inner ideas of what my future home will look like.
Beautiful angles set in bluened rooms with lots of 
space to move around in.

Wide open expanses - just like my internal desert is.
Blowing many formulas into the equation, so it may 
eventually look exactly as I've dreamed. 

Puppies running through my mind, glad to see me again, 
wanting to be petted, bathed, talked to.

Now that they are on a future horizon I can only imagine
being with them, doing what we used to do when together.


'All that we are not stares back at what we are.'  - W. H. Auden 



A birthplace came back: the homeland image.
I'd left, but escapism is fiction, 

when the mind is born to stand on one place
of history. Feet are nomads (independent)        

on the bottom of bodies. They grasp their
own agendas, staying fixed upon the lights

of ones viewpoint; the city which resides behind the
eyes: cleftnotes rising from said cities.

There is a future and a sentimental projection, 
Each one is the hard side and soft side of life, 

The gazebo, flipped over and crushed, or
Full of flowers, inviting in its emptiness.

My hands are the hands of family; my mother's hands, 
my father's hands, inverted replicas of my own, 

matches, as in one flowing species, and
the copies sent out into duplicate worlds.

It is recalling days wrapped in ribbons
or the burgeoning oceans bringing relief

to lives and dusty hearts. To gorge on predictions, 
tends to kill, in their deceptive clothing, 

or they can uplift one's consciousness till one can
see the burned tops of mountain ranges, or 

know they are there; know that, within human grasps, 
are peaks to purify the feuding lungs.

Childhood sank: sun into sea. An inner child breathes, 
has his way, and the days roll, moved by direction. 


Into the darkness, evil forges it's path to 
unsuspecting people, trying hard to live 
their lives without too much strife.

Countless times, begun anew in different ways, 
people step out and find their way, looking 
ahead to the future, finally seeing some light 
shining, holding out hope for them.

Just reaching it, reaching out to grasp some 
of it for themselves, suddenly darkness falls, 
leaving them blinded, grasping at air.

Evil lurking close by has forged it's paths to
them, ruining their lives or taking them away
from life into the painless void of death.

Never again to feel the warmth of day, their 
souls gone to heaven while their bodies decay.

All promises, the future that lay ahead of a 
person now lies dead. 


A future to be told in perfect time
When everything will work out to be right
Flowing like a long Shakespearean rhyme
Never to be know in a time too soon
But when that moment finally arrives
The sun shines like the Arizona noon
Giving all the generations revives
Creating everyone's countless mysteries
If only they can see it and believe
No matter the name of all their countries
Finally people will choose to receive
That the future is not yet to be told
Instead a future is something to hold


A fuzzy fellow, without feet,
Yet doth exceeding run!
Of velvet, is his Countenance,
And his Complexion, dun!

Sometime, he dwelleth in the grass!
Sometime, upon a bough,
From which he doth descend in plush
Upon the Passer-by!

All this in summer.
But when winds alarm the Forest Folk,
He taketh Damask Residence—
And struts in sewing silk!

Then, finer than a Lady,
Emerges in the spring!
A Feather on each shoulder!
You'd scarce recognize him!

By Men, yclept Caterpillar!
By me! But who am I,
To tell the pretty secret
Of the Butterfly


Pain makes love to strengthen
It is on right footing then
There is no gain without pain
Earth experiences pain when it rains

No doubts should be raised
It must always be praised
It may not yield immediate result
The strong foundation has to be built

It may cause you great concern
It can’t be called trend as modern
It was there previous and may remain so
You can’t do it at first attempt or go

Love has to be observed from two points
The pick up of positive threads as hints
To follow it as natural gift
No ill feeling or to have slight rift

Love is ocean of sorrow 
No one knows what will happen to morrow
Purity in sense and with sincerity to follow
No to blind promises as to be proved hollow

Love is to be considered as holiest gift
There is supposed to be no shift
It may endure you life time tragedy
It may also prove hoax and turn in comedy

Assume where it can take to you in case you late
It should not be termed as bad luck or fate
It has to be accepted fire ball
Immediately respond to it with a first call

It may wait endlessly for your reply
There is no special condition to imply
Think on dotted lines and make a grand push
It may pay handsomely to you without any rush

Love may remain for many more days to come
Your action must speak volumes with grand welcome
Nothing goes wrong if patiently waited for
There is nothing like pain or anything in store


Grey mists of a morning; 
Wild Winter’s adorning, 
All forest, woodland and sea. 
Black clouds on the headland 
Rain falls on the wet sand - 
A raven sits high in his tree. 

O give me the heather 
No matter the weather 
Wild purple on Merrick’s fair hill - 
O give me the breeze 
Thru gold-yellow trees 
My heart is ever there still 

Green grass is all white frost 
Gold bracken’s now compost 
Trees are as bare as a bone: 
The glen has no cover 
For pheasant or plover 
The wind in the wires does moan. 

There’s geese in the stubble 
Craggy cliffs crack with rubble 
The cry of sea-birds is gone: 
Waves break on the shore 
Casting spray aft and fore 
The storm rages on and on. 

Let the Seasons all roll 
And the Winter extoll, 
That Hope is an evergreen: 
Nature’s wild and majestic 
And other places domestic 
Compared to my Galloway scene. 


Ah! ken ye what I met the day
Out oure the Mountains 
A coming down by craggi[e]s grey 
An mossie fountains -- 
A[h] goud hair'd Marie yeve I pray
Ane minute's guessing --
For that I met upon the way
Is past expressing.
As I stood where a rocky brig 
A torrent crosses
I spied upon a misty rig
A troup o' Horses -- 
And as they trotted down the glen
I sped to meet them
To see if I might know the Men
To stop and greet them.
First Willie on his sleek mare came
At canting gallop -- 
His long hair rustled like a flame
On board a shallop.
Then came his brother Rab and then
Young Peggy's Mither
And Peggy too -- adown the glen
They went togither -- 
I saw her wrappit in her hood
Fra wind and raining --
Her cheek was flush wi' timid blood
'Twixt growth and waning -- 
She turn'd her dazed head full oft 
For there her Brithers
Came riding with her Bridegroom soft 
And mony ithers.
Young Tam came up an' eyed me quick
With reddened cheek --
Braw Tam was daffed like a chick --
He coud na speak --
Ah Marie they are all gane hame 
Through blustering weather
An' every heart is full on flame
Ah! Marie they are all gone hame
Fra happy wedding, 
Whilst I -- Ah is it not a shame?
Sad tears am shedding. 


Five little girls, of Five, Four, Three, Two, One:
Rolling on the hearthrug, full of tricks and fun. 

Five rosy girls, in years from Ten to Six:
Sitting down to lessons - no more time for tricks. 

Five growing girls, from Fifteen to Eleven:
Music, Drawing, Languages, and food enough for seven! 

Five winsome girls, from Twenty to Sixteen:
Each young man that calls, I say "Now tell me which you MEAN!" 

Five dashing girls, the youngest Twenty-one:
But, if nobody proposes, what is there to be done? 

Five showy girls - but Thirty is an age
When girls may be ENGAGING, but they somehow don't ENGAGE. 

Five dressy girls, of Thirty-one or more:
So gracious to the shy young men they snubbed so much before! 


Five PASSE girls - Their age? Well, never mind!
We jog along together, like the rest of human kind:
But the quondam "careless bachelor" begins to think he knows
The answer to that ancient problem "how the money goes"

What wonder that I should be dreaming
Out here in the garden to-day?
The light through the leaves is streaming,--

Paulina cries, "Play!"

The birds to each other are calling,
The freshly-cut grasses smell sweet;

To Teddy's dismay, comes falling
The ball at my feet.

"Your stroke should be over, not under!"
"But that's such a difficult way!"
The place is a springtide wonder
Of lilac and may;

Of lilac, and may, and laburnum,
Of blossom,--
We're losing the set!
"Those volleys of Jenny's,--return them;
"Stand close to the net!"


* * * * * * *

You are so fond of the Maytime,
My friend, far away;
Small wonder that I should be dreaming
Of you in the garden to-day. 

A deck of cards, and I think of the game poker

An ace is a joker
Or a choker
In the game of poker
You can win from behind
With five, four or three of a kind

Never be in a rush
To dish out a flush
When you do, rub it in a a blush

This game of poker, I love so much
Every card and every single touch
Winners, beginners, high shakers and losers


Many a moths around one flame 
Life’s alluring inviting game 
Many lose themselves; what to blame? 
The desire to burn in is to blame. 

This game goes on for fixed time 
So long the wick burns cute a dame 
The flame too has its demise tame, 
Who sets this flirtatious game sublime? 





Try to see what is it that I’m feeling? 
Try to find out what lies deep beneath
Beneath the pretty complexion of this make-up world
Beneath the pretense and the mind games that we play
Will you choose to display the truth for all to see? 
Or join me in this game of hide, disguise and lies? 
Perhaps it’s better to live in the abstract thoughts of others
Or maybe create a world all of our own
A little piece of heaven here on earth
You’ll be the Eve and Adam I
Surprise me with the apple
And tear us down from the clouds onto the floor
And as we fall with no regret
Laughing out of pride and out of boredom
We had the chance 
We didn’t last
So what will follow us in time to come? 
Will we build another paradise for just us two? 
Or get the tickets to the one around the corner? 
It’s always easier to blame others for the failure that we’ll face
It’s always much more appealing and amusing
To have a scapegoat in our sight
A little being to throw up for the sacrifice
And buy ourselves the time we’ll need to find another
Another image of a perfect life
Until the day that someone breaks in with the torchlight
And sheds the light unto the shadows that will dwell there in the corners
Revealing to our eyes what is already buried in our mind
No place is perfect
Nothing is faultless and pure
The evil that we pretend not to notice
Is ourselves playing god in this polluted garden of green gods
Of a soulless sense of existence
With no guilt, no time and no remorse


If adorable as adore gloating
Adorable, original, fatso aged; 
Good! A safe, adorable trailing, 
A dear goofball as originated.


Good! A fair stale load bearing
Adorable of egalitarian dogs, 
Fool database or agile daring
A feared aboriginal toad logs.


Alas! Good of aged libertarian; 
Alas! Fair, dogged elaboration; 
Ago glorified adorable Satan; 
So flailed garbage adoration; 


Or a garbage, fool and idealist
Of laggard ideas elaboration; 
A fool, adorable, daring ageist
Bolder, ga-ga falsie adoration; 


Fool ga-ga, idle, sad aberration; 
Good! A bold fears egalitarian
Flag, adores ideal abrogation; 


Good! Safe, adorable, liar, giant; 
Star, ga-ga ideal, fool debonair; 
As adored fair, boogie, gallant; 
Agile odor and sabotage flair.


So light and soft the days fall—
Like petals one by one 
Down from yon tree whose flowers all
Must vanish in the sun.

Like almond-petals down, dear,
Odorous, rosy-white, 
Falling to our green world here 
Off the thick boughs of night.

One like another still lies—
Tomorrow is today. 
Always the buzzing bee flies,
Who never flies away.

Ever the same blue sky rounds
Its chalice for the sun. 
The mountains at the world's bounds
Their purple chorals run.

And ever you and I, friend, 
Free of this mortal scheme, 
Look out beyond desire's end 
And dream the spacious dream. 


The pains you give to me, 
the misbehaves I face everyday, 
the maltreatment I tolerate, 
might have wet my eyes for sometime! 
But I know the time apparently cruel, 
is making a pavement for me, 
in the thorny bushes of life, 
and I am heading to the gates of a garden, 
where there is my fair lady, 
in a silky white dressing, 
with a bouquet of white scented flowers, 
in her smooth and touching soft palm, 
and, 
with a kind and inviting smile on her pink lips.
Sweetheart! 
All lines of love have been erased from my palm, 
heat of pains I got in my life, 
have made my palm so much heated and soft, 
that when you give your left palm in my right palm, 
you will not find it difficult to imprint a new love line, 
and when I shall take the bouquet in my left palm, 
my both palms will be frozen, 
the new love line will be an immortal line.
Who says I shall die? 
I shall kiss my fair lady, 
she will sit beneath a tall tree, 
with its roots deep in the earth, 
and its apex touching the skies, 
with her feet in the water of an eternal canal, 
I shall put my head on her thighs, 
with the bouquet of new flowers of love, 
in my left hand, 
and my right arm enveloping her for ever.
She will comb my dusty hairs with her artistic fingers, 
and I shall sleep for ever in a new garden, 
and you say it will be my grave! 
No I can't believe, 
it will be a garden of my fair lady

Oh, no; I would not leave thee, my sweet home,
Decked with the mantling woodbine and the rose,
And slender woods that the still scene inclose,
For yon magnificent and ample dome
That glitters in my sight! yet I can praise
Thee, Arundel, who, shunning the thronged ways
Of glittering vice, silently dost dispense
The blessings of retired munificence.
Me, a sequestered cottage, on the verge
Of thy outstretched domain, delights; and here
I wind my walks, and sometimes drop a tear
O'er Harriet's urn, scarce wishing to emerge
Into the troubled ocean of that life,
Where all is turbulence, and toil, and strife.
Calm roll the seasons o'er my shaded niche;
I dip the brush, or touch the tuneful string,
Or hear at eve the unscared blackbirds sing;
Enough if, from their loftier sphere, the rich
Deign my abode to visit, and the poor
Depart not, cold and hungry, from my door. 

SEE how the flowers, as at parade, 
Under their colours stand display'd: 
Each regiment in order grows, 
That of the tulip, pink, and rose. 
But when the vigilant patrol 
Of stars walks round about the pole, 
Their leaves, that to the stalks are curl'd, 
Seem to their staves the ensigns furl'd. 
Then in some flower's beloved hut 
Each bee, as sentinel, is shut, 
And sleeps so too; but if once stirr'd, 
She runs you through, nor asks the word. 
O thou, that dear and happy Isle, 
The garden of the world erewhile, 
Thou Paradise of the four seas 
Which Heaven planted us to please, 
But, to exclude the world, did guard 
With wat'ry if not flaming sword; 
What luckless apple did we taste 
To make us mortal and thee waste! 
Unhappy! shall we never more 
That sweet militia restore, 
When gardens only had their towers, 
And all the garrisons were flowers; 
When roses only arms might bear, 
And men did rosy garlands wear


We are very slightly changed
From the semi-apes who ranged
India's Prehistoric clay;
He that drew the longest bow
Ran his brother down, you know,
As we run men down to-day.

"Dowb," the first of all his race,
Met the Mammoth face to face
On the lake or in the cave:
Stole the steadiest canoe,
Ate the quarry others slew,
Died -- and took the finest grave.

When they scratched the reindeer-bone,
Some one made the sketch his own,
Filched it from the artist -- then,
Even in those early days,
Won a simple Viceroy's praise
Through the toil of other men.
Ere they hewed the Sphinx's visage
Favouritism governed kissage,
Even as it does in this age.

Who shall doubt "the secret hid
Under Cheops' pyramid"
Was that the contractor did
Cheops out of several millions?
Or that Joseph's sudden rise
To comptroller of Supplies
Was a fraud of monstrous size
On King Pharaoh's swart Civilians?

Thus, the artless songs I sing
Do not deal with anything
New or never said before.
As it was in the beginning
Is to-day official sinning,
And shall be for evermore


Lightened darkness surrounding life outside my window with it's gentle coat of arms.
Royally enjoying wafts of nature being imaginatively sent through the window panes.
Glorious feelings touching all senses, penetrating their answering calls within these echoing walls. 

Looking around a sterile waiting room for some sign of human touches.
Only thing is a few magazines on a glass table.
No pictures hanging on the walls, no colorful hues painted anywhere - all is dark - nondescript.
Yet, the doctor is intelligent, creative, wonderful, a joy in all respects and a gentleman besides. 


Shepherd.	  Echo, I ween, will in the woods reply,	
  	  And quaintly answer questions. Shall I try? 	
Echo.	                        Try.	
Shepherd.	  What must we do our passion to express? 	
Echo.	                        Press.	       
Shepherd.	  How shall I please her, who ne'er loved before? 	
Echo.	                        Before.	
Shepherd.	  What most moves women when we them address? 	
Echo.	                        A dress.	
Shepherd.	  Say, what can keep her chaste whom I adore? 	        
Echo.	                        A door.	
Shepherd.	  If music softens rocks, love tunes my lyre.	
Echo.	                        Liar.	
Shepherd.	  Then teach me, Echo, how shall I come by her? 	
Echo.	                        Buy her.	    
Shepherd.	  When bought, no question I shall be her dear? 	
Echo.	                        Her deer.	
Shepherd.	  But deer have horns: how must I keep her under? 	
Echo.	                        Keep her under.	
Shepherd.	  But what can glad me when she's laid on bier? 	        
Echo.	                        Beer.	
Shepherd.	  What must I do when women will be kind? 	
Echo.	                        Be kind.	
Shepherd.	  What must I do when women will be cross? 	
Echo.	                        Be cross.	        
Echo.	                        Wind.	
Shepherd.	  If she be wind, what stills her when she blows? 	
Echo.	                        Blows.	
Shepherd.	  But if she bang again, still should I bang her? 	        
Echo.	                        Bang her.	
Shepherd.	  Is there no way to moderate her anger? 	
Echo.	                        Hang her.	
Shepherd.	  Thanks, gentle Echo! Right thy answers tell	
  	  What woman is, and how to guard her well.	        
Echo.	                        Guard her well. 


Gentle father, big and brawny, tenderly, gently, picking up
his new born child.
Little blue yes open wide, looking memorizingly at her father.
Intently listening to his deep soothing voice, peaceful and
calm, lying in her father's safe, protective arms.
Contented beyond this world, looking forward to every second
spent with him, this is the way a family is begun. 


I sleep by my love, 
Holding her close. 
Feeling the beat of her gentle heart.
 
I whisper in her ear 'I love you'
She turns to me and says ' your my everything'
I look into your eyes with crippling devotion, 
We share a bond unseen By the eye, 
A love always willing to Defy. 


Thick the mist at early morning's dawn, 
Cold the chill that enters by the door, 
White the frost, that lies, across the lawn, 
Each one piercing, striking to the core
Of one's whole being.  Then wakes the foggy morn, 
Where sunshine will in time, melt frost on haw, 
And rouse the sleeping field mouse in the corn, 
By dripping water down upon his paw.
He'll scuttle off, expression all forlorn, 
To leave the day to begin its gentle thaw.

The daily chores, which dull the mind, 
But converse with a gentle voice that sings, 
As if all the golden thoughts you find, 
Have materialized thus, on scripted wings, 
Leaving one's humdrum life behind.


Can't give him more than he undoubtedly
Deserves. The scoundrel! Look at his photograph!
A lady-killer! Hanging's too good by half
For such as he.' So said the stranger, one
With crimes yet undiscovered or undone.
But at the inn the Gipsy dame began:
'Now he was what I call a gentleman.
He went along with Carrie, and when she
Had a baby he paid up so readily
His half a crown. Just like him. A crown'd have been
More like him. For I never knew him mean.
Oh! but he was such a nice gentleman. Oh!
Last time we met he said if me and Joe
Was anywhere near we must be sure and call.
He put his arms around our Amos all
Save him from justice! Nicer man never trod.


'I hold the door open for you 
a simple act of courtesy
This any gentleman would do.
To you I act insultingly.

Because you simply do not know
 how a true lady should react
 and the hostility you show.
 Just demonstrates this sorry fact.

How sad it is this should be so
That Feminists can only see
Politeness as another blow 
against their female dignity.

A lady knows how to accept
 such a proffered courtesy
She feels entitled to expect
 to be treated courteously

 I do not say that feminists
cannot be ladies. I dare not
 I am quite sure some must exist
In my experience not a lot

I will still act the gentleman
I know that ladies understand
 I act this way to show I can
Be as polite as any man.

So if my manners cause offence
It is something I regret.
But perhaps I might influence
Some feminists so they forget.

Their attitude towards all men
is fuelled by their ignorance.
 I hope that they will think again
There might just be the slightest chance.

I recognise equality
I merely choose to be polite
 If you prefer hostility
It is your choice you have the right.



It is not what they built.  It is what they knocked down.
It is not the houses.  It is the spaces in between the houses.
It is not the streets that exist.  It is the streets that no longer exist.
It is not your memories which haunt you.
It is not what you have written down.
It is what you have forgotten, what you must forget.
What you must go on forgetting all your life.
And with any luck oblivion should discover a ritual.
You will find out that you are not alone in the enterprise.
Yesterday the very furniture seemed to reproach you.
Today you take your place in the Widow's Shuttle.

*

The bus is waiting at the southern gate
To take you to the city of your ancestors
Which stands on the hill opposite, with gleaming pediments, 
As vivid as this charming square, your home.
Are you shy?  You should be.  It is almost like a wedding, 
The way you clasp your flowers and give a little tug at your veil.  Oh, 
The hideous bridesmaids, it is natural that you should resent them
Just a little, on this first day.
But that will pass, and the cemetery is not far.
Here comes the driver, flicking a toothpick into the gutter, 
His tongue still searching between his teeth.
See, he has not noticed you.  No one has noticed you.
It will pass, young lady, it will pass.

*

How comforting it is, once or twice a year, 
To get together and forget the old times.
As on those special days, ladies and gentlemen, 
When the boiled shirts gather at the graveside
And a leering waistcoast approaches the rostrum.
It is like a solemn pact between the survivors.
They mayor has signed it on behalf of the freemasonry.
The priest has sealed it on behalf of all the rest.
Nothing more need be said, and it is better that way-

*

The better for the widow, that she should not live in fear of surprise, 
The better for the young man, that he should move at liberty between the armchairs, 
The better that these bent figures who flutter among the graves
Tending the nightlights and replacing the chrysanthemums
Are not ghosts, 
That they shall go home.
The bus is waiting, and on the upper terraces
The workmen are dismantling the houses of the dead.

*

But when so many had died, so many and at such speed, 
There were no cities waiting for the victims.
They unscrewed the name-plates from the shattered doorways
And carried them away with the coffins.
So the squares and parks were filled with the eloquence of young cemeteries: 
The smell of fresh earth, the improvised crosses
And all the impossible directions in brass and enamel.

*

'Doctor Gliedschirm, skin specialist, surgeries hours or by appointment.'
Professor Sarnagel was buried with four degrees, two associate memberships
And instructions to tradesmen to use the back entrance.
Your uncle's grave informed you that he lived in the third floor, left.
You were asked please to ring, and he would come down in the lift
To which one needed a key. 

*

Would  come down, would ever come down
With a smile like thin gruel, and never too much to say.
How he shrank through the years.
How you towered over him in the narrow cage.
How he shrinks now. 

*
But come.  Grief must have its term?  Guilt too, then.
And it seems there is no limit to the resourcefulness of recollection.
So that a man might say and think: 
When the world was at its darkest, 
When the black wings passed over the rooftops, 
(And who can divine His purposes?)  even then
There was always, always a fire in this hearth.
You see this cupboard?  A priest-hole! 
And in that lumber-room whole generations have been housed and fed.
Oh, if I were to begin, if I were to begin to tell you
The half, the quarter, a mere smattering of what we went through! 

*

His wife nods, and a secret smile, 
Like a breeze with enough strength to carry one dry leaf
Over two pavingstones, passes from chair to chair.
Even the enquirer is charmed.
He forgets to pursue the point.
It is not what he wants to know.
It is what he wants not to know.
It is not what they say.
It is what they do not say. 


WITH steady march across the daisy meadow, 
And by the churchyard wall we go; 
But leave behind, beneath the linden shadow, 
One, who no more will rise and go: 
Farewell, our brother, here sleeping in dust, 
Till thou shalt wake again, wake with the just. 

Along the street where neighbor nods to neighbor, 
Along the busy street we throng, 
Once more to laugh, to live and love and labor,-- 
But he will be remembered long: 
Sleep well, our brother, though sleeping in dust: 
Shalt thou not rise again--rise with the just? 

Farewell, true heart and kindly hand, left lying 
Where wave the linden branches calm; 
'T is his to live, and ours to wait for dying, 
We win, while he has won, the palm; 
Farewell, our brother! But one day, we trust, 

A WIND-SWEPT tulip-bed--a colored cloud 
Of butterflies careering in the air-- 
A many-figured arras stirred to life, 
And merry unto midnight music dumb-- 
So the dance whirls. Do any think of thee, 
Amiel, Amiel? 
Friends greet each other--countless rills of talk 
Meander round, scattering a spray of smiles. 
Surely--the news was false. One minute more 
And thou wilt stand here, tall and quiet-eyed, 
Shakespearian beauty in they pensive face, 
Amiel, Amiel. 


Many here knew and loved thee--I nor loved, 
Scarce knew--yet in thy place a shadow glides, 
And a face shapes itself from empty air, 
Watching the dancers, grave and quiet-eyed-- 
Eyes that now see the angels evermore, 
Amiel, Amiel. 

On just such night as this, 'midst dance and song, 
I bade thee carelessly a light good by-- 
'Good by'--saidst thou; 'A happy journey home!' 
Was the unseen death-angel at thy side, 
Mocking those words--('A happy journey home,' 
Amiel, Amiel? 

Ay, we play fool's play still; thou hast gone home. 
While these dance here, a mile hence o'er thy grave 
Drifts the deep New Year snow. The wondrous gate 
We spoke of, thou hast entered; I without 
Grope ignorant still--thou dost its secrets know, 
Amiel, Amiel. 

What if, thus sitting where we sat last year, 
Thou camest, took'st up our broken thread of talk, 
And told'st of that new Home, which far I view, 
As children, wandering on through wintry fields, 
Mark on the hill the father's window shine, 
Amiel, Amiel? 

No. We shall see thy pleasant face no more; 
Thy words on earth are ended. Yet thou livest; 
'T is we who die.--I too, one day shall come, 
And, unseen, watch these shadows, quiet-eyed-- 
Then flit back to thy land, the living land, 
Amiel, Amiel. 


Sleeping in daylight
too scared to sleep at night
there's voices in my head 
from people who are dead

They say that they
want to talk to me
to tell me about the past

But I don't
want to talk to them
because I know
I died with them that night


in the circle of dreams they
came floating 

flailing apparitions ready to dance, 
to untuned emptiness

the ghostly dance in the light, that 
had no moon

only fireflies pulsating lights, gravid
scenes

delighting only the night looking on 
in her dark gown

around and around without a sound, the ghostly
dance of wispy wisps appeared

then as the night was eaten by light where did
they goin the circle of dreams they
came floating 

flailing apparitions ready to dance, 
to untuned emptiness

the ghostly dance in the light, that 
had no moon

only fireflies pulsating lights, gravid
scenes

delighting only the night looking on 
in her dark gown

around and around without a sound, the ghostly
dance of wispy wisps appeared

then as the night was eaten by light where did
they go


As I play the blues
on my Gibson guitar
it takes me back
to those train track blues

The heart and soul
of Slash and his crew
Les Paul and Gibson
the true train track blues


See! I give myself to you, Beloved!
My words are little jars
For you to take and put upon a shelf.
Their shapes are quaint and beautiful,
And they have many pleasant colours and lustres
To recommend them.
Also the scent from them fills the room
With sweetness of flowers and crushed grasses.

When I shall have given you the last one,
You will have the whole of me,
But I shall be dead. 


It was my d birthday.
I had just given birth to our d daughter 
month earlier.

He went shopping for my birthday present.
I had visions of jewels and lacy things.
I couldn't wait to see what he would buy me! 
Afterall, I just gave him another daughter.

When he came home with the gift he seemed so proud.
He said he knew I was going to be happy! 
With nervous fingers I opened the present
greedily clawing the wrapping paper off
to reveal the symbol of his love for me.

The breath caught in my throat as I choked back my tears.
Inside the bag I found the symbol of our love
boxes of snack cakes and a hot-pink sweat-suit! 
I tried to pretend I wasn't offended 
but he knew me too well.

For years I used this birthday as leverage against him.
I viewed it as an insult that he would think so little of me
as to buy me a ''gift fit for a pig''.

Last night, something hit me like a ton of bricks. 
he bought me the cakes because he knew I liked them
and the sweat-suit because he wanted me to be comfortable.
(and it was pink because that's my favorite color)        
He did think about the gift. 

He was also showing me that he wasn't concerned
what size I was
or what size I would become.
He was telling me that he loved me.  

unconditionally.
I didn't see what that gift really was
and I didn't appreciate it until last night.

I thanked him for the cakes and the sweat-suit this morning. 
years late.
He understood.


'If you don't like the gun, my dear, 
I can exchange it for a negligee but 
I've given you many negligees. 
I think a gun's important
to have around the house 
when I'm at home with the wife.

'Let's say some guy breaks in   
looking for your money 
or maybe for your honey.
Will you smile and say, 
'How can I help you, Mister? 
I hope you brought protection.' 

'Remember, a gun's your guardian angel 
whether you're sleeping or awake.
That's what I told the wife when I 
gave her a gun as big as this one.
She needs it for the nights
I'm over here with you.

'I am in love with you right from the start
Flood of love has inundated my heart! 


Now my thought is full of sweet dreams

You are an inspiration to live long
You are a muse to write love song.

As if I was frozen in ice
Now my life is like paradise. 


They were created with perfection
But arrived before well baked
Sent to show the way
Searchers of another day
Nestled in our hearts
Never to be forgotten
Drawn now into dream
Revel in the knowing
The angels of adventure.


Arrived as a calm against the storm
Opening the changes around
They escaped this reality
Leaving a message of trust
Treat the coming for what it is
And explore the dream
For they where a gift from heaven

Simple the delight they gave
Melting the hearts around
Into sleep now taken
These tiny infants of the dream
They herald the changes within. 

We do our best to avoid
the Zika Virus. We smack
mosquitoes and avoid
tanned folks just back 
from two weeks in the tropics. 

The Zika Virus is 
something we acquire 
but the Virus Ignoramus is 
something we inherit
from the Piltdown Man. 

To one degree or another 
we all suffer from the
Virus Ignoramus. 
Recessive in you and me 
and those with whom we agree

it breaks out like a rash 
and stays forever on those  
with whom we disagree. 
No wonder we talk only to 
folks with whom we agree. 

or rather a problem with me 
and he doesn't.
Or so we discover
while taking a break 
at a big convention.
I hope I don't lose my job.


We're in a bar with Lady Gaga 
My boss has a whiskey sour
and I'm nursing a Coke.

He doesn't believe
faith is a gift no one's 
guaranteed but knows
some folks have it
and others don't.
Why is that, he asks, 
finishing his sour, 
signaling for another.

I tap into memories
from philosophy class
and recite the proofs 
some folks accept
and others deny.
My boss sees the logic
but still doesn't believe.
So I sip my Coke and say
faith is a gift logic can't buy.

A few more drinks and he asks 
what a man must do 
if he wants to believe.
Ominous, I think, but here goes.
My wife, after all, has a job
with benefits.

he doesn't believe in
to grant him faith.
Ask Him more than once
and if he receives it
he will be amazed 
that someone 
like me believes. 

Time is of the essence.
It is full of many presents.
Some blow up in our faces.
Others give loving embraces. 


James Holmes awaited news of his fate. (Would his madness be held to mitigate? 
His terrible sin, his awful crimes; Life or Death, How to decide?) 
What is Justice for multiple homicides? 
He murdered twelve and injured more; Now what would the verdict hold in store? 
A lethal injection, A Lover’s pinch, was that the outcome he devoutly wished? 
Else he would get the world and time to contemplate his awful crimes.
He’d be Locked away from the world of men; never to be free again.
Haunted by souls he condemned to death; who had cursed him with their dying breath.

Life, the jury has decreed, as punishment for his awful deed.

He'll be locked in the prison of his mind; an awful penance is this gift of time. 


One baby boy, was his Mother’s joy, 
Cradled, warm upon her knee.
The Holy birth, was a gift to earth, 
A Saviour for you and me.

A tiny life, knowing yet, no strife, 
Was now waiting to begin.
He came to save, and therefore forgave, 
Our vast multitudes of sin.

Some shepherds they heard what had occurred, 
And followed a Star post haste.
Three wise men too, on their camels, knew
This new King had to be traced.

Rough the cattle stall, with mud brick wall, 
Crude built manger filled with straw.
This special child, so gentle and mild, 

So this babe, so small, did thus enthral, 
All those who knelt down to pray.
Still here in our hearts today.


he had seen me
on the cover of a dime store novel; 
that I looked a lot prettier in person.

On our first date
he brought my mother
a box of cigars
and my father 
a dozen used golf balls.

The trunk of his car had no lid
and you could see the road
on the passenger side beneath your feet.

He had charm.

He stood under my bedroom window
and tied a note to a brick; 
it broke the window
set off burglar alarms; 
the police came
and he apologized.


We went to dinner and he smelled like chicken poop
from putting barb wire around the chicken coop.

I told him pigs will fly before I married him
and he showed up the next day
at the hardware store
where I worked
with a pig in the flatbed of a pick-up truck.

He called me out
strapping wings on the pig
yelling: 
"Pig to fly on runway nine
Pig to fly on runway niner."

He had charm.

Showed up one Saturday
wearing a gingham dress
over his jeans
saving he was saving up
to buy it for me.
"How does it look? "
he said, "wanted to be sure."

I was sure.

Married him.

Oh, he still has charm; 
lots of it rubs off on me. 

The tree has entered my hands,
The sap has ascended my arms,
The tree has grown in my breast -
Downward,
The branches grow out of me, like arms.

Tree you are,
Moss you are,
You are violets with wind above them.
A child - so high - you are,
And all this is folly to the world. 

A whirling, dervish of a girl tosses my heart about; 
lifts it to heights I've never dreamed.

A twisting roaring power
that can rain on my parade
bring darkness to my skies
not to see the light
in her eyes, 
or heaven's sweetest grace
with the smile on her face.

She is unparalleled 
a ride on a carousel
a mystery, an open book; 
she can kill me 
with just one look, and
make all my storms subside. 

I lock myself in my room
And I hear a loud boom
He tries to open my door
But I'm right next to it on the floor
Crying until my tears are gone.

Finally he stops
He gives in with a loud pop
The door falls over
And I roll over
I don't wanna die that way
If I die I'll do it the right way
A girl can only hope it'll work that way.

I'll wait until it's my time
Then whatever is mine
Can be thrown away
Not like he wanted it anyway

My dad walks in
He tries to pin
Me to the ground
And tells me not to make a sound
I ignore him, and scream
Hopefully someone switched teams
A girl can only dream.

When it was all over
I moved forward
To the door
Wishing there weren't four
People standing so close
But I hope they chose
To be on my team
A girl can only dream.

They tied up my wrists
There were so many twists
I can't tell if they used one or two ropes
A girl can only hope.

There were a bunch of strange men
Saying exactly what they can
Do to this girl
They tell me to go and curl
Into a ball and try to hide
But I let that slide
I stand my ground
And I don't make a sound

They look at me and frown
Then they try to drown
Me and I can't breathe
I wish I could just leave
Then I wouldn't be put in this much pain
I swear my dad's the main
One in charge of these creeps.

He doesn't care what happens to me
Why should he? 
It's not like he ever wanted me
Why should he? 
I'm just some stupid mistake
And my heart breaks
So easily.


Once upon a time not many years ago 
a girl named Fred fell in love with a boy named Fran. 
Although the names seemed an odd combination 
and could easily be confused by people who did not know 
that Fred was a girl and Fran was a boy. 
They made the perfect couple as everyone agreed 
and when their wedding day arrived, 
the priest who was standing in 
did not know about the names 
only that he was marrying a Fred to a Fran. 
Turning to Fran he said, 
Fred with you take this woman 
to be your lawful wedded wife. 
Excuse me Father, but I think that should be husband. 
The priest looked up a bit dismayed, but just carried on. 
Turning to Fred said Fran will you take this man 
to be your lawful wedded husband. 
Excuse me Father, but I think that should wife. 
The priest’ eyes rolled around in his head 
very dazed and confused. 
The silent sniggers in the congregation began to grow louder 
as peels of laughter not bells rang out within the church. 
The poor priest was now in utter disarray 
and after blessing the rings; 
he handed them back the wrong way about. 
Then the poor priest red faced said 
to whomever I pronounce you man and wife. 
Just to make things more riotous 
someone switched the Wedding March 
to Rock Around The Clock, 
which sent the bride and groom bopping down the isle, 
and the poor priest he had a nervous breakdown 
saying he would never perform 
a wedding ceremony again. 
He would stick to funerals 
as there was only one body involved 
and they wouldn’t talk back to him. 


My days have been spent
on rain-washed streets 
beneath dismal grey skies
weeping in retreat
from the most beautiful
of possibilities, 
but I still believe
in a glittering new world
where a girl recites Coleridge
or Wordsworth at the bus station
while a woman's fingers keep count
on a Buddhist rosary
and a waitress waters roses
after bringing coffee to my table.


One day, I'll be as exuberant 
as the first summer sunrise
and I'll smile child-like
in the magical dawn
and not even a secret mischievous twin
will ever suppress my happiness again. 

We plucked a red rose, you and I
All in the summer weather;
Sweet its perfume and rare its bloom,
Enjoyed by us together.
The rose is dead, the summer fled,
And bleak winds are complaining;
We dwell apart, but in each heart
We find the thorn remaining.


We sipped a sweet wine, you and I,
All in the summer weather.
The beaded draught we lightly quaffed,
And filled the glass together.
Together we watched its rosy glow,
And saw its bubbles glitter;
Apart, alone, we only know
The lees are very bitter.


We walked in sunshine, you and I,
All in the summer weather.
The very night seemed noonday bright.
When we two were together.
I wonder why with our good-by
O'er hill and vale and meadow
There fell such shade, our paths seemed laid
Forevermore in shadow.


We dreamed a sweet dream, you and I,
All in the summer weather,
Where rose and wine and warm sunshine
Were mingled in together.
We dreamed that June was with us yet,
We woke to find December.
We dreamed that we two could forget,
We woke but to remember. 



A neighbor of mine in the village 
Likes to tell how one spring
When she was a girl on the farm, she did 
A childlike thing.

One day she asked her father
To give her a garden plot
To plant and tend and reap herself, 
And he said, 'Why not?'

In casting about for a corner 
He thought of an idle bit
Of walled-off ground where a shop had stood, 
And he said, 'Just it.'

And he said, 'That ought to make you 
An ideal one-girl farm,
And give you a chance to put some strength 
On your slim-jim arm.'

It was not enough of a garden 
Her father said, to plow;
So she had to work it all by hand, 
But she don't mind now.

She wheeled the dung in a wheelbarrow 
Along a stretch of road;
But she always ran away and left 
Her not-nice load,

And hid from anyone passing. 
And then she begged the seed.
She says she thinks she planted one 
Of all things but weed.

A hill each of potatoes, 
Radishes, lettuce, peas,
Tomatoes, beets, beans, pumpkins, corn, 
And even fruit trees.

And yes, she has long mistrusted
That a cider-apple
In bearing there today is hers,
Or at least may be.

Her crop was a miscellany 
When all was said and done,
A little bit of everything, 
A great deal of none.

Now when she sees in the village 
How village things go,
Just when it seems to come in right, 
She says, 'I know!

'It's as when I was a farmer. ' 
Oh never by way of advice!
And she never sins by telling the tale 
To the same person twice. 


My heart beats faster when I'm with you
My mind is always on you
You are the only thing i think about
Im always caught up with your smile then to listen to you
And im sorry for that! 
I only want to spend time wth you
You are the one who comes in my dreams all the time i sleep
I dont know what happened to me? 
What is this feeling? 
Can it be? 
Is this love? 
Yes, this is love! 
I love him! 
But he doesnt love me
He loves someone else as I see


Can I forget her cruelty
Who, brown miracle, gave you me?
Or with unmoisted eyes think on
The proud surrender overgone,
(Lowlihead in haughty dress),
Of the tender tyranness?
And ere thou for my joy was given,
How rough the road to that blest heaven!
With what pangs I fore-expiated
Thy cold outlawry from her head;
How was I trampled and brought low,
Because her virgin neck was so;
How thralled beneath the jealous state
She stood at point to abdicate;
How sacrificed, before to me
She sacrificed her pride and thee;
How did she, struggling to abase
Herself to do me strange, sweet grace,
Enforce unwitting me to share
Her throes and abjectness with her;
Thence heightening that hour when her lover
Her grace, with trembling, should discover,
And in adoring trouble be
Humbled at her humility!
And with what pitilessness was I
After slain, to pacify
The uneasy manes of her shame,
Her haunting blushes!--Mine the blame:
What fair injustice did I rue
For what I--did not tempt her to?
Nor aught the judging maid might win
Me to assoil from HER sweet sin.
But nought were extreme punishment
For that beyond-divine content,
When my with-thee-first-giddied eyes
Stooped ere their due on Paradise!
O hour of consternating bliss
When I heavened me in thy kiss;
Thy softness (daring overmuch!)
Profan-ed with my licensed touch;
Worshipped, with tears, on happy knee,
Her doubt, her trust, her shyness free,
Her timorous audacity


A girl sang a song in the temple's chorus, 
About men, tired in alien lands, 
About the ships that left native shores, 
And all who forgot their joy to the end. 

Thus sang her clean voice, and flew up to the highness, 
And sunbeams shined on her shoulder's white -- 
And everyone saw and heard from the darkness 
The white and airy gown, singing in the light. 

And all of them were sure, that joy would burst out: 
The ships have arrived at their beach, 
The people, in the land of the aliens tired, 
Regaining their bearing, are happy and reach. 

And sweet was her voice and the sun's beams around. . 
And only, by Caesar's Gates -- high on the vault, 
The baby, versed into mysteries, mourned, 
Because none of them will be ever returned. 


Deserted by love
In the summertime, 
I walk by the river
And speak to seagulls
And feed them my sandwich.

I used to worship the dawn, 
But now, I awake alone
In a dreamless home.

I fantasize a departure
To an exotic place
Where I’ll have a new
And lovelier face.

A girl will kiss me
Who doesn’t intend
To make me cry. 


The girl looks so smart, so lovely 
So romantic and so lively
With her charming  smile
Expressing the sign of no guile.

Her eyes are always veiled
With a mysterious spectacle. 
Who knows or who can say 
If her heart is a scorching day? 

Her sweet coated words and her rosy lips
Fascinate even a passer by so deep.
But behind her charming smile, inside her
Perhaps you will find only charcoal's fire.


May be her heart is chained 
Only with love's agony and pain 
Like a solitary prisoner
Confined within a cell year after year. 

Perhaps behind the glass, her eyes 
Are filled with the fire of love's anguish.
In her heart there may have an ocean 
Filled with the tears of love and  separation. 

With the mysterious glass she looks so nice
But may be she is in disguise.
She may shatter all of your dream 
If you fall in love with her sometime.

Like a burning pyre 
Or a devastating fire
Her mind may be truly burning
With the heat of love's suffering.  

But the girl looks so smart, so lovely 
So romantic and so lively
With her charming  smile
Expressing the sign of no guile. 


'I, the day just over,
Gave a lock of hair to--no!
How DARE you say, my lover?'

He asked you?--Let me understand;
Come, child, let me sound it!
'Of course, he WOULD have asked it, and--
And so--somehow--he--found it.

'He told it out with great loud eyes--
Men have such little wit!
His sin I ever will chastise
Because I gave him it.

'Shameless in me the gift, alas!
In him his open bliss:
But for the privilege he has
A thousand he shall miss!

'His eyes, where once I dreadless laughed,
Call up a burning blot:
I hate him, for his shameful craft
That asked by asking not!'

Luckless boy! and all for hair
He never asked, you said?
'Not just--but then he gazed--I swear
He gazed it from my head!

'His silence on my cheek like breath
I felt in subtle way;
More sweet than aught another saith
Was what he did not say.

'He'll think me vanquished, for this lapse,
Who should be above him;
Perhaps he'll think me light; perhaps--
Perhaps he'll think I--love him!

'Are his eyes conscious and elate,
I hate him that I blush;
Or are they innocent, still I hate--
They mean a thing's to hush.

'Before he nought amiss could do,
Now all things show amiss;
'Twas all my fault, I know that true,
But all my fault was his.

'I hate him for his mute distress,
'Tis insult he should care!
Because my heart's all humbleness,
All pride is in my air.

'With him, each favour that I do
Is bold suit's hallowing text;
Each gift a bastion levelled, to
The next one and the next.

'Each wish whose grant may him befall
Is clogged by those withstood;
He trembles, hoping one means all,
And I, lest perhaps it should.

'Behind me piecemeal gifts I cast,
My fleeing self to save;
And that's the thing must go at last,
For that's the thing he'd have.

'My lock the enforc-ed steel did grate
To cut; its root-thrills came
Down to my bosom. It might sate
His lust for my poor shame!

'His sifted dainty this should be
For a score ambrosial years!
But his too much humility
Alarums me with fears.

'My gracious grace a breach he counts
For graceless escalade;
And, though he's silent ere he mounts,
My watch is not betrayed.

'My heart hides from my soul he's sweet:
Ah dread, if he divine!
One touch, I might fall at his feet,
And he might rise from mine.

'To hear him praise my eyes' brown gleams
Was native, safe delight;
But now it usurpation seems,
Because I've given him right.

'Before I'd have him not remove,
Now would not have him near;
With sacrifice I called on Love,
And the apparition's Fear.'

Foolish to give it!--'Twas my whim,
When he might parted be,
To think that I should stay by him
In a little piece of me.

'He always said my hair was soft--
What touches he will steal!
Each touch and look (and he'll look oft)
I almost thought I'd feel.

'And then, when first he saw the hair,
To think his dear amazement!
As if he wished from skies a star,
And found it in his casement.

'He's kiss the lock--and I had toyed
With dreamed delight of this:
But ah, in proof, delight was void--
I could not SEE his kiss!'


So, fond one, half this agony
Were spared, which my hand hushes,
Could you have played, Sweet, the sweet spy,
And blushed not for your blushes

A dear old Cornish friend would often say
When looking at a blue-topped winter sky
And pointing out the view - - 'A given day
This be - - a given day for we to try
To understand the why this day be not
The normal winter-grey, and be we glad
To wet our fields and lanes today with sad.'

Then buxom Rosie smiled and playfully
Waylaid me in her country-woman style
A 'given' thing that if we searched would find.
She then would bend to pick a primrose eyeing
Us, and winking underneath a leaf - - 



'The sun
Be caught in this, and all coming Spring beside, - -
Look lass, - - before this given thing be gone.

'Give me a glass of water
To drink in this summer.
Give me a glass of water, 
I have nothing to drink, 
The area is full of water, though.

Give me a bowl of rice
Or a bread to eat, 
I want nothing more than this.

Give me a bowl of rice 
To eat, on this day.
On this day, I am hungry.
I am being eaten by
My hunger, my thirst, 
That are within me. 


Water was another of the four elements
defined by the Greek philosophers like Aristotle.
Any schoolboy now knows there are elements, 
which I have seen on charts in science classrooms.

The Greek thinkers did not know that water molecules
consist of two hydrogen atoms and one of oxygen.
They lacked strong microscopes to peer into matter, 
although some of them theorised about atoms.

Water covers about two-thirds of the Earth's surface, 
which makes it greater, in a sense, than air, fire and earth.
Water is like the opposite of fire: cold not hot, 
liquid not flame, and very useful for fire fighters.

Water has a dark side in floods and storms, 
but many positive qualities necessary for life.
The human body needs drinks of water regularly
to avoid dehydration, chronic thirst and fainting.

Yesterday I bought some bottled water at the supermarket
to compare the taste of it with water from the tap: 
the refined water did taste purer than tap water, 
and it has fewer calories than my usual soft drinks.




'What's in a glass of wine?'
There, set the glass where I can look within.
Now listen to me, friend, while I begin
And tell you what I see-
What I behold with my far-reaching eyes,
And what I know to be
Below the laughing bubbles that arise
Within this glass of wine.
There is a little spirit, night and day,
That cries one word, for ever and alway:
That single word is 'More!'
And whoso drinks a glass of wine, drinks him:
You fill the goblet full unto the brim,
And strive to silence him.


Glass after glass you drain to quench his thirst,
Each glass contains a spirit like the first;
And all their voices cry
Until they shriek and clamor, howl and rave,
And shout 'More!' noisily,
Till welcome death prepares the drunkard's grave,
And stills the imps that rave.


That see I in the wine:
And tears so many that I cannot guess;
And all these drops are labelled with 'Distress.'
I know you cannot see.
And at the bottom are the dregs of shame:
Oh! it is plain to me.
And there are woes too terrible to name:
Now drink your glass of wine. 

A glaze of the sun, 
Songs of that white birds, 
On the staircase
And all around me, 
I am astonished
On the type of life
That is there in the street
And for which I stood. 

In the eyes of the mouth, 
there is a silence
that I wish, I could mount on a shelf
of domestic quiet
to be understood by the heart of another
unfettered by words-
as volumes are spoken, 
without words


  Let me review the scene,
And summon from the shadowy Past
  The forms that once have been.

The Past and Present here unite
  Beneath Time's flowing tide,
Like footprints hidden by a brook,
  But seen on either side.

Here runs the highway to the town;
  There the green lane descends,
Through which I walked to church with thee,
  O gentlest of my friends!

The shadow of the linden-trees
  Lay moving on the grass;
Between them and the moving boughs,
  A shadow, thou didst pass.

Thy dress was like the lilies,
  And thy heart as pure as they:
  Did walk with me that day.

I saw the branches of the trees
  Bend down thy touch to meet,
The clover-blossoms in the grass
  Rise up to kiss thy feet,

"Sleep, sleep to-day, tormenting cares,
  Of earth and folly born!"
Solemnly sang the village choir
  On that sweet Sabbath morn.

Through the closed blinds the golden sun
  Poured in a dusty beam,
Like the celestial ladder seen
  By Jacob in his dream.

And ever and anon, the wind,
  Sweet-scented with the hay,
Turned o'er the hymn-book's fluttering leaves
 That on the window lay.

Long was the good man's sermon,
  Yet it seemed not so to me;
For he spake of Ruth the beautiful,
  And still I thought of thee.

Long was the prayer he uttered,
  Yet it seemed not so to me;
For in my heart I prayed with him,
  And still I thought of thee.

But now, alas! the place seems changed;
  Thou art no longer here:
Part of the sunshine of the scene
  With thee did disappear.

Though thoughts, deep-rooted in my heart,
  Like pine-trees dark and high,
Subdue the light of noon, and breathe
  A low and ceaseless sigh;

This memory brightens o'er the past,
  As when the sun, concealed
Behind some cloud that near us hangs
  Shines on a distant field. 


A GLIMPSE, through an interstice caught,
   Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-room, around the stove,
         late of a winter night--And I unremark'd seated in a corner;
   Of a youth who loves me, and whom I love, silently approaching, and
         seating himself near, that he may hold me by the hand;
   A long while, amid the noises of coming and going--of drinking and
         oath and smutty jest,
   There we two, content, happy in being together, speaking little,
         perhaps not a word. 


The old woman waited, 
standing on the sidwalk
watching the round-about
She seems frail, 
a long life, weighted 
on hunched shoulders
Yet a look of contentment
nonetheless in her eyes
As the car approaches
she starts to it
A woman, middle-aged, 
and obviously her daughter
quickly jumps out of the car
and hurries to her mother
to assist the old woman
The old woman ducks
the outstretched arm holding 
the door for her, 
scurrying into the car
(refusing to believe that 
she would need such help! Imagine!) 
with a haste that startled
the younger woman
The younger woman's rebuts only
fell on selectively deaf ears.

As they drove away, 
I couldn't help but cry.
Such an ordinary, everyday occurrence
never to be remembered
by anyone. 
but me.
The defiance of the old woman and her will
The tenderness of the daughter
and the her appreciation, subconscious, 
That she has this time with her mother.
I said a prayer for them. 
I prayed that the daughter never forgets
and the old woman
enjoyed her life and that it was full.
And as I returned to my
mother's hospital room, 
a surprise pang of jealousy
and regret overwhelmed me.
The search for answers
I know I would never find
filled and crushed my heart. 
I entered my mother's room quietly
and sat by her side while she slept.
and my mother's peace.
And I watched her beautiful
young face throughout the night. 


I caught but a glimpse of him. Summer was here.
And I strayed from the town and its dust and heat.
And walked in a wood, while the noon was near,
Where the shadows were cool, and the atmosphere
Was misty with fragrances stirred by my feet
From surges of blossoms that billowed sheer
Of the grasses, green and sweet.

And I peered through a vista of leaning tree,
Tressed with long tangles of vines that swept
To the face of a river, that answered these
With vines in the wave like the vines in the breeze,
Till the yearning lips of the ripples crept
And kissed them, with quavering ecstasies,
And wistfully laughed and wept

And there, like a dream in swoon, I swear
I saw Pan lying--, his limbs in the dew
And the shade, and his face in the dazzle and glare
Of the glad sunshine; while everywhere,
Over across, and around him blew
Filmy dragon-flies hither and there,
And little white butterflies, two and two,
In eddies of odorous air. 


Wonderful is  not  so  much
The  mausoleum's  chisel cut  beauty
As  the  beauty  of  the  love
Arrested  in  its  architecture-
Starry  white  dome in  starry  space
Ray lit clouds set  aglow

Fairer than  the  sky, akin  to  third eye
Visitors' mind  illumine  with   cosmic  bliss
As  night snuffs  asleep.
What's  bricked  up looking  glass
Dawn  sunpolishes
Till  Jamuna's  surface  looks  back

Hallucinating but  still  real.
There's  in  it  no  beauty
That's not  surpassed in  beauty
By  beautiful  carved adage
Till earth  wears  out  love  like  theirs
Suffuses  this   world  wonder  sarcophagus. 


What is my thought of you, beloved one,
Now you have passed from me and gone your ways?
Glory is gone with you from stars and sun,
And all wise meaning from the nights and days.
There is no colour, no delight, no praise
In the deep forest, where your dear eyes shone,
Nor any dryad face with cheeks ablaze
To paint the glades grown sere as Avalon.
--What is my thought of you? No thought have I
But just to weep the pity of lost things,
Grieve with the wind, and rain tears with the rain.
The sun may smile, who knows, in a blue sky,
To--morrow? But to--day Hope's passionate wings
Are folded and Love waits on only Pain. 


A goal
A goal makes
A great difference.

Let there be a goal
And let us play
The game life-long.

Let us play in the sky
Let us play in the ocean
Let us play on this earth
And let us continue our play
Without any break.

And let us remember, 
In this play no one is the winner
But each one is the fighter. 

What do you do 
when you’ve pursued a dream 
and finally 
made it come true, 
do you find another dream 
and start pursuing it to? 
The answer is simple 
yes 
that is what you have to do. 
Just keep pursuing all your dreams 
no matter how wild 
they may seem. 
You have to have 
a goal in life 
and our dreams are that goal. 
We have to pursue them, 
each and everyone 
to the bitter end, 
for if we don’t 
we will end up 
with a wasted life. 
I thought once 
I’d given up mine, 
but that was just a rest bite. 
I came back 
refreshed, 
renewed 
and pursued my dream 
even harder than before 
until finally 
I made it happen 
and made one of my dreams 
come true.

April  god in wrath 
Was beating a man; 
He cuffed him loudly 
With thunderous blows 
That rang and rolled over the earth. 
All people came running. 
The man screamed and struggled, 
And bit madly at the feet of the god. 
The people cried, 
"Ah, what a wicked man!" 
And -- 
"Ah, what a redoubtable god!


"I Found you and I lost you, 
All on a gleaming day. 
The day was filled with sunshine, 
And the land was full of May.

A golden bird was singing 
Its melody divine, 
I found you and I loved you, 
And all the world was mine.

I found you and I lost you, 
All on a golden day, 
But when I dream of you, dear, 
It is always brimming May. 

The subtle beauty of this day 
Hangs o'er me like a fairy spell, 
And care and grief have flown away, 
And every breeze sings, "all is well
 

I ask, "Holds earth or sin, or woe?" 
My heart replies, "I do not know


Nay! all we know, or feel, my heart, 
Today is joy undimmed, complete; 
In tears or pain we have no part; 
The act of breathing is so sweet, 
We care no higher joy to name. 
What reck we now of wealth or fame?

The past--what matters it to me? 
The pain it gave has passed away. 
The future--that I cannot see! 
I care for nothing save today-- 
This is a respite from all care, 
And trouble flies--I know not where.

Go on, oh noisy, restless life! 
Pass by, oh, feet that seek for heights! 
I have no part in aught of strife; 
I do not want your vain delights. 
The day wraps round me like a spell 
And every breeze sings, "All is well

"Reincarnation turned me 
into golden fish 
now I am cursed to fulfill
wish after wish. 


A beckoning spirit of gladness seemed afloat,
That lightly danced in laughing air before us:
The earth was all in tune, and you a note
Of Nature's happy chorus.

'Twas like a vernal morn, yet overhead
The leafless boughs across the lane were knitting:
The ghost of some forgotten Spring, we said,
O'er Winter's world comes flitting.

Or was it Spring herself, that, gone astray,
Beyond the alien frontier chose to tarry?
Or but some bold outrider of the May,
Some April-emissary?

The apparition faded on the air,
Capricious and incalculable comer.--
Wilt thou too pass, and leave my chill days bare,
And fall'n my phantom Summer


 

Good and ugly
Are the extremes of the society
But bad's bad



I woke before the morning, I was happy all the day, 
I never said an ugly word, but smiled and stuck to play. 

And now at last the sun is going down behind the wood, 
And I am very happy, for I know that I've been good. 

My bed is waiting cool and fresh, with linen smooth and fair, 
And I must be off to sleepsin-by, and not forget my prayer. 

I know that, till to-morrow I shall see the sun arise, 
No ugly dream shall fright my mind, no ugly sight my eyes. 

But slumber hold me tightly till I waken in the dawn, 
And hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn. 

Good-Bye sweet, sweet summer, must you always go away? 
Oh how I shall miss your short warm nights and long hot days
For once can't you be here to stay? 


This summer shall remain special to me
In my memory this summer will forever more be

No it wasn't a summer of love, loss, or mystery
But was a summer of realization
A summer of learning more about me

This Summer I asked questions about myself that I never did before
This summer I answered those questions honestly
Pondered many thoughts
And did so much more

This summer during the warm nights I looked up at the stars
And wondered if this lifestyle was for me

This summer I looked up at the stars 
And was forced to answer honestly 
If this was where I wanted to be 

Oh summer even though I'll miss you so
A new season is around the corner
To Fall I must say hello

While I shall miss staring up at the stars
While the warm summer breeze plays with my hair 
I won't mind the falling leaves or chilling air

While I'll miss being warmed by the sun's never ending rays
I won't mind watching the leaves turn to different colors & shades
Or as the chilly air picks up the falling leaves
And blows them away

While it somewhat pains me to bid farewell
To summer that has left me forever changed

Maybe my fall will be like my summer
Maybe by the end of it I'll never be the same

So I must say goodbye to you summer
But I'm not to distressed or worried at all
After all who knows how much I'll have discovered about myself
By the end of beautiful Fall


I saw Al once a month
for years, maybe more, 
doing business together.
He retired to hunt bear 
in Alaska, hook Tarpon 
in Florida, golf in Scotland.
He had it all planned.
Nothing would stop him.

Months later I learned
doctors said he had
cancer of the blood.
The outlook was bleak.
I called Al and he said 
six months, maybe a year
of chemo. No guarantees.
But he'd beat it.

A year later Al called, 
said the chemo had worked.
He was cured and was 
going on a trip fishing.
We agreed to have lunch 
when he got back.
He said he'd call me.

Al called when he got back 
but the news wasn't good.
His blood was fine but 
doctors found a tumor, 
a big one on his brain, 
no way to operate, likely
malignant, more chemo. 
We agreed to have lunch later.
He'd give me a ring.

We never had lunch, of course, 
but I met Al's wife at the wake 
six months or so later.
She said Al had mentioned me
many times over the years.
She thanked me many times
for being a good customer. 

How many good hearts are there? 
Do my fingers count too many? 
Do we think we can find any? 
Blindly groping in the dark, 
Who can we really trust


He publishes poems
by writers who find
no publishers elsewhere.

They suffer rejection
and he gives them hope.
Some improve

and some do not.
But hope isn't always
the best thing.

It's not hopeful to tell 
a child with clubfoot
to take ballet. 



I thought my life was well 
rounded in a bottle.
I was aloof and trampled 
by the weight of my despair.
The canopy of drear was in 
all the curves of my circumference.
It was a blasphemous time and 
power that was not dainty, but me. 
Alone, was my past life. 
This world was rounded 
to converge with a fit of 
jealous rage that I suppressed 
with a good intoxication. Now, 
although late in this life, I have 
those things. I have taken advantage 
of this life He has given me. With 
every new breath I take I absorb
a gift a new love for my life.
I have a chance; a new start.



Never let his 
People down.
For he is
The king and
his responsibility
is to see
The welfare of 
All subjects. 

A good leader
leading by example
is a good leader
showing the way 
By rational moves
with endurances and love
He rules his subjects
Disciplines of people
He make his goals
The subject progress is
All his dream
Education, A must
To good leader
As ass on the throne
Formal education not only his yard stick
With life's experience
A good leader, A jewel
At home
            



I'm not even sure
of the meaning of good
or how close
the modal of should

from the core of the motive
to an act of compassion
is free of the germs of subterfuge
and the viruses of cheat

good relates to another, 
I was born of a mother
into the species called human
not always humane

learned and imitated, 
fed by a mother ueaten by father -
Are acts of good, directed
by should and conditional would


Beyond words.
A good man is
Beyond words.
A good cause
Would never suffer
At the hands of
A good man.
A good man is
Always busy in
Searching the Truth. 
And where there is
Truth, there is love
And where there is both
Love and Truth
One can find everything
There, near and far.
A good man is
The main pillar 
Of everything here.
A good man is
The holy sir, holy air
And he is the future.
A good man is 
The loving friend of the poor.
And I am a poor creature, here
O my dear, and You
Have blessed me, I know
It is Your grace
And it is Your nature
It is Your nature
To grace the poor. 


It's great to have a man around the
house. And better still, if he happens
to be your spouse. There may be 
times, when you'll not see eye to eye.
But even then, what would life be, 
without that special guy?  At times
we get into a snit, when they don't
do the many things, we ask them to 
do. We all know for a fact, when they 
have time, they'll do anything for you.
No matter how you look at it, consider
yourself lucky, if you've found a good
man. As we all know, good men are 
hard to find. So don't complain and I'll
do the same, as we could have wound
up, with the other kind

A good man never dies--
In worthy deed and prayer
And helpful hands, and honest eyes,
If smiles or tears be there:
Who lives for you and me--
Lives for the world he tries
To help--he lives eternally.
A good man never dies.


II

Who lives to bravely take
His share of toil and stress,
And, for his weaker fellows' sake,
Makes every burden less,--
He may, at last, seem worn--
Lie fallen--hands and eyes
Folded--yet, though we mourn and mourn,
A good man never dies. 


A good man can never be
A bad one, as we know
Nature created all with 
All goodness.

We are here to know
Everyone's utility
For our society.

At times the nature
Surprised us, 
Only because
We are preconceived.

We are here to take
And taste the sweetness
Of all and all activities. 

A good poem should convey message, 
It cannot be in one or two lines like statement, 
It has to be in paragraphs of equal lines! 

The sentences should have rhymes, 
We have to write without mistakes, 
In spelling, grammar and meanings! 

Need not be in urge to publish hurriedly
Write, edit, arrange, rearrange, post honestly
You get your poem appreciated nicely


Saying Good Morning as I'm saying Good Night on the other
side of the world, poetry, is so all defining as we write
each in our own homes far from one another.

Poetry allowing us to be in the same space of time together, 
in spite of the distance between us.

Beauty touching us from different continents of the world
and being brought together through our words of poetry that
we are sharing.

So all-encompassing, poetical wonder surprising us with 
every detail being created in two separate minds, penned and
written in each other's hearts as we are friends for life, 
brought together by poetry.

Though we may never meet physically, we have surpassed time
and miles to meet in another dimension where we can always 
share our soul's wonder and delight through a poem.

So joyful, a new song of rhythm planted in my heart, and I


Cookies for George, 
years back from Viet Nam, 
are the only payment
the man will accept  
to mow your lawn, 
rake your leaves, 
shovel your snow.

He sleeps behind 
his brother's house
above the garage.
Every two weeks
he shaves and bathes. 
His brother takes him 
to the Veterans Hospital. 

George has cancer again
years after Agent Orange.
But he'll mow your lawn, 
rake your leaves
and shovel your snow 
for nothing less than
cookies for George. 


It's a silent cold night here; 
All are quite asleep deep! 
No one roams in the street; 
No sound of dogs heard! 
Pitch darkness covers all; 
I am with the computer 
Composing this poem
Before I go to sleep.
Sky too covered with clouds
Dark and no Star peeps through
To wink its eyes on lovers! 
Tomorrow's job is tomorrow known
For me to pay full justice as I do now! 
Nice to see comments by my friends! 
Bye now!  Good Night!  Sweet Dreams


We built a ship upon the stairs 
All made of the back-bedroom chairs, 
And filled it full of soft pillows 
To go a-sailing on the billows. 

We took a saw and several nails, 
And water in the nursery pails; 
And Tom said, "Let us also take 
An apple and a slice of cake;"-- 
Which was enough for Tom and me 
To go a-sailing on, till tea. 

We sailed along for days and days, 
And had the very best of plays; 
But Tom fell out and hurt his knee, 
So there was no one left but me. 


A good poet. 
Who is a good poet? 
Is good poet sinless? 
Who is sinless? 
And what is a sin? 
Who is free from
Obtuseness, inactivity
Heedlessness and delusion? 

What is it like? 
Who is writing poems? 
Is poem in love? 
And what is love 
In this world of passions
Attachment, aversion. 

Is poet happy? 
Ask the poet and 
The answer you received
Is not his 
Hearing the answer
Are you in tranquility.
A good poet
A good poet. 




She had no papers when she ran away 
from her parents' thatched-roof hut, 
a speck on an English landlord's farm.  

Her family had to plant and harvest 
turnips and potatoes but it wasn't 
hard work that had made her run. 

It was her father who got drunk 
in front of an open fire in winter 
when work was slow and food 

was scarce and the family hungry. 
He'd fall asleep and then wake up 
and yell all night that his kids 

had misbehaved and made 
the English landlord angry. 
There are more reasons today 

to be illegal than in but  
thrashings with a razor strop 
created a stowaway then. 


Some people call me blessed 
others call me an angel, 
but I think myself as none of these. 
Just an ordinary person 
who as he travels down life’s busy road, 
will stop for a moment 
to give a stranger a hand, 
a stranger in distress. 
That does not make me blessed 
or very much an angel. 
You could call me a Good Samaritan 
and a friend to whom ever 
I might chance upon 
as I travel on my way.


You said you'd never leave me
And I, I did believe you
For there could never be
Another one for me like you

At first I didn't know you
Though I really wanted to
You talked to me, a simple 'hey'
Was the cause of my happiness everyday

I said the right things and you wanted to see me
We met and everything was as it should be
We parted and promised to reunite
Instead it all ended up in a fight

You said 'good things happen' and I must say
The time I could spend with you has been the best day
Now you left me and with you you took my life's sense
You seem to forget that a good thing never ends


On the horizon
I watch Sun rise; 
Now tangerine, 
In the blink of an eye
It turns
Colour of corn kernels.

Conjures up 
Image 
Of fruit juice: 
What better way
To start the day 
With a glass in the morning
Along with milk and 
Corn flakes-Her eyes are the windows of a soul
Where only the white thoughts spring,
And they look, as the eyes of the angels look,
For the good in everything.


Her lips can whisper the tenderest words
That weary and worn can hear,
Can tell of the dawn of a better morn
Till only the cowards fear.

Her hands can lift up the fallen one
From an overthrow complete,
Can take a soul from the mire of sin

And she can walk wherever she will-
She walketh never alone.
The work she does is the Master's work,

Tour to distant places makes me forget the world; 
Friends would be missing me for more than days! 
But my works of poetry will talk very well to them all
Satisfying their curiosities whether I am there or not! 
Hope you all understand what I say and bye till then

Go to sleep--though of course you will not-- 
to tideless waves thundering slantwise against 
strong embankments, rattle and swish of spray 
dashed thirty feet high, caught by the lake wind, 
scattered and strewn broadcast in over the steady 
car rails! Sleep, sleep! Gulls' cries in a wind-gust 
broken by the wind; calculating wings set above 
the field of waves breaking. 
Go to sleep to the lunge between foam-crests, 
refuse churned in the recoil. Food! Food! 
Offal! Offal! that holds them in the air, wave-white 
for the one purpose, feather upon feather, the wild 
chill in their eyes, the hoarseness in their voices-- 
sleep, sleep . . . 

Gentlefooted crowds are treading out your lullaby. 
Their arms nudge, they brush shoulders, 
hitch this way then that, mass and surge at the crossings-- 
lullaby, lullaby! The wild-fowl police whistles, 
the enraged roar of the traffic, machine shrieks: 
it is all to put you to sleep, 
to soften your limbs in relaxed postures, 
and that your head slip sidewise, and your hair loosen 
and fall over your eyes and over your mouth, 
brushing your lips wistfully that you may dream, 
sleep and dream-- 


A black fungus springs out about the lonely church doors-- 
sleep, sleep. The Night, coming down upon 
the wet boulevard, would start you awake with his 
message, to have in at your window. Pay no 
heed to him. He storms at your sill with 
cooings, with gesticulations, curses! 
You will not let him in. He would keep you from sleeping. 
He would have you sit under your desk lamp 
brooding, pondering; he would have you 
slide out the drawer, take up the ornamented dagger 
and handle it. It is late, it is nineteen-nineteen-- 
go to sleep, his cries are a lullaby; 
his jabbering is a sleep-well-my-baby; he is 
a crackbrained messenger. 


The maid waking you in the morning 
when you are up and dressing, 
the rustle of your clothes as you raise them-- 
it is the same tune. 
At table the cold, greeninsh, split grapefruit, its juice 
on the tongue, the clink of the spoon in 
your coffee, the toast odors say it over and over. 


The open street-door lets in the breath of 
the morning wind from over the lake. 
The bus coming to a halt grinds from its sullen brakes-- 
lullaby, lullaby. The crackle of a newspaper, 
the movement of the troubled coat beside you-- 
sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep . . . 
It is the sting of snow, the burning liquor of 
the moonlight, the rush of rain in the gutters packed 
with dead leaves: go to sleep, go to sleep. 
And the night passes--and never passes--Magnificent animal Harambe, 
the Silverback gorilla killed at the zoo.


Lovely child, the three-year-old who 
jumped in Harambe's den.

The mother took her son to the zoo 
and the child behaved like a child.

Harambe showed great restraint
and didn't do what a gorilla could.

He was curious, kind and patient
until the screaming spooked him.

Then he dragged the child like a doll
through the water up to a wall.

Today Harambe, not the child, 
would still be alive if the mother had

taken the child in utero to 
Planned Parenthood and not the zoo. 


There's a gorilla in my back yard.
I'm making friends with him, 
approaching cautiously, 
as he moves toward my world.

He says a few words, 
or what he thinks are words, 
to show me how 'human' he is.
He clumsily hikes
a football through his legs.

I've taken a risk
to approach this great beast
whose silver-steel muscles
could crush me in an instant.

Venturing out of his habitat, 
he's overcome his natural 
fear of the unknown.

A great sharing's 
taking place
behind my house. 



I

In summer when the days are hot 
The subway is delayed a lot; 
In winter, quite the selfsame thing; 
In autumn also, and in spring.

And does it not seem strange to you 
That transportation is askew 
In this--I pray, restrain your mirth!-- 
In this, the Greatest Town on Earth?

II

All night long and every night 
The neighbors dance for my delight; 
I hear the people dance and sing 
Like practically anything.

Women and men and girls and boys, 
All making curious kinds of noise 
And dancing in so weird a way, 
I never saw the like by day.

So loud a show was never heard 
As that which yesternight occurred: 
They danced and sang, as I have said, 
As I lay wakeful in my bed.

They shout and cry and yell and laugh 
And play upon the phonograph; 
And endlessly I count the sheep, 
Endeavouring to fall asleep.

III

It is very nice to think 
This town is full of meat and drink; 
That is, I'd think it very nice 
If my pappa but had the price.

IV

This town is so full of a number of folks, 
I'm sure there will always be matter for jokes. 



Thank you for representing life as a Gothic horror 
with the nerve-wrecking shocks of demented men, 
dad as Heathcliff, mom as Mr Rochester’s mad first 
wife and you a strange mixture between Jane Eyre 
and the rebellious Catherine 

Thank you for recreating ‘Great Expectations’ in which 
you are Pip, for describing your life in Sherwood with 
Robin Hood among the criminal poor, adding scenes 
of the Phantom’s life in his nightmare underworld lair, 
yet, I cannot share the stage with you

I am following the narrative imperative of Pratchett’s 
Discworld series, applying Mary Poppins’ advice in a 
wild dance through the mutable universe depicted in 
Bedknobs and Broomsticks - balancing this edifice 
with ideals and visions; therefore 

Thank you for adding Edgar Allan Poe and Artemis 
Fowl to the pastoral scenes of my slow-moving life, 
I shall remember you believe that intrigue is the 
staple of life as I am sitting quietly, waiting for 
the White Rabbit to pass by again


Gathered in the graveyards
waiting for our own deaths
recesses called graves
waiting to take us

It's the life that poverty gave to us
the life the government
won't help us to get out of

Maybe it's time for a new hope
and a new government


Taken is the time, to make intense the mess of what they are today, 
Break them down with loneliness and cast out an empty helping hand, which in turn is a stage on which we direct there play, and as we had planned, they stay divided, with no holding of each others hands.

Sail them home with debt ridden stress, 
As we all know how it’s going to be, 
Like a distressed mistress in our brought red dress’s, for a helping hand, they flock in great numbers 
Opening door two of our plans, 
And follow they will do, for they no nothing of what be false or what be true

I’m not saying that we are right or you wrong it’s up to is all to make, 
But being idle and being proud leaves you all knotted and bound, not by us but by your mundane brains, merchandise and greed have led you down a path which leads to we, 
Never will you understand, your all just part of our master plan 

Sail them home with debt ridden stress, 
As we all know how it’s going to be, 
Like a distressed mistress in our brought red dress’s, for a helping hand, they flock in great numbers 
Opening door two of our plans, 
And follow they will do, for they no nothing of what be false or what be true

We pay you cash too make a past, one for you all too be amazed.
But you take the time to create distress and in-turn your own dismay
And it’s with this lack, of intellectual life and masses of ego traits, that lead you like sheep bleating and flocking our way, 
They way already chosen by your lack of self-restraint, cursing your inner core which leaves you lost among millions of life’s endless corridors

Not focused or thought on during there time is the question of life itself.
You choose much of many things, whilst loosing touch with what was one yourself, left corrupted by what spiritual devastations in brings.

Are wearing there gold crowns and more, paid in honour by the poor, 
For ignorant souls like you and thee become the builders off our destiny


Why people
Go for govt. job? 
No work

O THOU, in whom we live and move—
Who made the sea and shore;
Thy goodness constantly we prove,
And grateful would adore;
And, if it please Thee, Power above!
Still grant us, with such store,
The friend we trust, the fair we love—
And we desire no more. Amen

LORD, we thank, and thee adore,
For temporal gifts we little merit;
At present we will ask no more—
Let William Hislop give the spirit. 

She smiled as we passed her table -
a nod of politeness, rather than recognition.
She was lunching with her husband -
and thinly clad in the summer heat.
She must have been in her eighties, 
but remarkably elegant and self-assured.

Her hair was swept up in a messy chignon, 
Her voice was cultured without being posh.
She reminded me of mum -
without the cringe
and the scoliosis.
Same generous mouth.
Same kind, deep-set eyes.


After the meal
I noticed her leave the table
and return with a new coat of lipstick.
I thought how gracefully
she carried her years
and what a salutary lesson 
she offered
those sad souls
for whom cosmetic surgery
seems the only option.

A grain of rice 
Alone 
In the cooking pot
Cries, "I wish 
I could get out! "

I wish I could get out
Of this cooking pot
With the entire waters 
Of The Flood, 
Nay, Styx drained
Enough to drown
The Universe
And the infernal fire under it.

the other me slithers out of
peep holes, cracks and crs
slides and spreads, rolls and multiplies
filling the here and vast beyond

rides the golden chariots, 
glides on the wings of fantasy
begetting dreams of dreams, 
floating on clouds wrapped and cloaked

shedding my skin, dropping my leaves
hung up to dry, 
dominated by lack of means, 
I shrink wither and recline

by moods eluding and flirtatious
devoid of trauma, drama and catharsis
indulge myself
into realms of there

sometimes I  can  be followed, 
pride is of no use
guilt and blushing have no place, 
I am free, of electronics too

on a vacation, from some of myself


If starry space no limit knows
      And sun succeeds to sun,
There is no reason to suppose
      Our earth the only one.
'Mid countless constellations cast
      A million worlds may be,
      And steer to destiny.
 
Just think! A million gods or so
      To guide each vital stream,
With over all to boss the show
      A Deity supreme.
Such magnitudes oppress my mind;
      From cosmic space it swings;
So ultimately glad to find
      Relief in little things.

For look! Within my hollow hand,
      While round the earth careens,
I hold a single grain of sand
      And wonder what it means.
Ah! If I had the eyes to see,
      And brain to understand,
I think Life's mystery might be
      Solved in this grain of sand. 


Almighty Creator
are you mindful 
of grains of sand 
along your great sea? 
I am less than nothing 
on the shores of infinity, 
but I come 
from the desert to drink. 

Do you see this grain of sand
Lying loosely in my hand?
Do you know to me it brought
Just a simple loving thought?
When one gazes night by night
On the glorious stars of light,
Oh how little seems the span
Measured round the life of man.

Oh! how fleeting are his years
With their smiles and their tears;
For such atoms as we are?
Then outspake this grain of sand
'I was fashioned by His hand
In the star lit realms of space
I was made to have a place.

'Should the ocean flood the world,
Were its mountains 'gainst me hurled
All the force they could employ
Wouldn't a single grain destroy;
And if I, a thing so light,
Have a place within His sight;
You are linked unto his throne
Cannot live nor die alone.

In the everlasting arms
Mid life's dangers and alarms
Let calm trust your spirit fill;
Trustingly I raised my head
Hearing what the atom said;
Knowing man is greater far
Than the brightest sun or star. 


Let us begin and carry up this corpse,
       Singing together.
   Leave we the common crofts, the vulgar thorpes
       Each in its tether
   Sleeping safe on the bosom of the plain,
       Cared-for till cock-crow:
   Look out if yonder be not day again
      Rimming the rock-row!
   That's the appropriate country; there, man's thought,
      Rarer, intenser,
  Self-gathered for an outbreak, as it ought,
      Chafes in the censer.
  Leave we the unlettered plain its herd and crop;
      Seek we sepulture
  On a tall mountain, citied to the top,
      Crowded with culture!
  All the peaks soar, but one the rest excels;
      Clouds overcome it;
  No! yonder sparkle is the citadel's
      Circling its summit.
  Thither our path lies; wind we up the heights:
      Wait ye the warning?
  Our low life was the level's and the night's;
      He's for the morning.
  Step to a tune, square chests, erect each head,
      'Ware the beholders!
  This is our master, famous, calm and dead,
      Borne on our shoulders.

   Sleep, crop and herd! sleep, darkling thorpe and croft,
      Safe from the weather!
  He, whom we convoy to his grave aloft,
      Singing together,
  He was a man born with thy face and throat,
      Lyric Apollo!
  Long he lived nameless: how should spring take note
      Winter would follow?
  Till lo, the little touch, and youth was gone!
      Cramped and diminished,
  Moaned he, "New measures, other feet anon!
      My dance is finished"?
  No, that's the world's way: (keep the mountain-side,
      Make for the city!)
  He knew the signal, and stepped on with pride
      Over men's pity;
  Left play for work, and grappled with the world
      Bent on escaping:
  "What's in the scroll," quoth he, "thou keepest furled
      Show me their shaping,
  Theirs who most studied man, the bard and sage,--
      Give!"--So, he gowned him,
  Straight got by heart that book to its last page:
      Learned, we found him.
  Yea, but we found him bald too, eyes like lead,
      Accents uncertain:
  "Time to taste life," another would have said,
      "Up with the curtain!"
  This man said rather, "Actual life comes next?
      Patience a moment!
  Grant I have mastered learning's crabbed text,
      Still there's the comment.
  Let me know all! Prate not of most or least,
      Painful or easy!
  Even to the crumbs I'd fain eat up the feast,
      Ay, nor feel queasy

"
  Oh, such a life as he resolved to live,
      When he had learned it,
  When he had gathered all books had to give!
      Sooner, he spurned it.
  Image the whole, then execute the parts--
      Fancy the fabric
  Quite, ere you build, ere steel strike fire from quartz,
      Ere mortar dab brick!

   (Here's the town-gate reached: there's the market-place
      Gaping before us.)
  Yea, this in him was the peculiar grace
      (Hearten our chorus!)
  That before living he'd learn how to live--
      No end to learning:
      Use for our earning.
  Others mistrust and say, "But time escapes:
      Live now or never!"
  He said, "What's time? Leave Now for dogs and apes!
      Man has Forever

"
  Back to his book then: deeper drooped his head:
      Calculus racked him:
  Leaden before, his eyes grew dross of lead:
      Tussis attacked him.
  "Now, master, take a little rest!"--not he!
      (Caution redoubled
  Step two abreast, the way winds narrowly!)
      Not a whit troubled,
  Back to his studies, fresher than at first,
      Fierce as a dragon
  He (soul-hydroptic with a sacred thirst)
      Sucked at the flagon.
  Oh, if we draw a circle premature,
      Heedless of far gain,
  Greedy for quick returns of profit, sure
      Bad is our bargain!
      (He loves the burthen)--
      Perfect the earthen?
  Did not he magnify the mind, show clear
      Just what it all meant?
  He would not discount life, as fools do here,
      Paid by instalment.
  He ventured neck or nothing--heaven's success
      Found, or earth's failure:
  "Wilt thou trust death or not?" He answered "Yes:
      Hence with life's pale lure!"
  That low man seeks a little thing to do,
      Sees it and does it:
  This high man, with a great thing to pursue,
      Dies ere he knows it.
  That low man goes on adding one to one,
      His hundred's soon hit:
  This high man, aiming at a million,
      Misses an unit.
  That, has the world here--should he need the next,
      Let the world mind him!
      Seeking shall find him.
  So, with the throttling hands of death at strife,
      Ground he at grammar;
  Still, thro' the rattle, parts of speech were rife:
      While he could stammer
  He settled Hoti's business--let it be!--
      Properly based Oun--
  Gave us the doctrine of the enclitic De,
      Dead from the waist down.
  Well, here's the platform, here's the proper place:
      Hail to your purlieus,
  All ye highfliers of the feathered race,
      Swallows and curlews!
  Here's the top-peak; the multitude below
      Live, for they can, there:
  This man decided not to Live but Know--
      Bury this man there?
  Here--here's his place, where meteors shoot, clouds form,
      Lightnings are loosened,
  Stars come and go! Let joy break with the storm,
      Peace let the dew send!
  Lofty designs must close in like effects:
      Loftily lying,
  Leave him--still loftier than the world suspects,
      Living and dying. 


Maury's wife frets 
about growing old
withering up 

and sagging so 
it's up to Maury
to let her know 

every day she's 
a grand buffet
that he can't wait 

to see and sample.
Her appetizers are 
enticing, entrees 

perfectly prepared.
At his age though, 
Maury has to pause.

He knows now
this will mean 
a long nap later. 


I see a grave very small, 
Inside it an infant is sleeping, 
His soul is away but where is the soul, 
I shall tell you, wait, and let me fly, 
To the first sky, 
I see the infant and I see a fairy, 
Breast feeding the infant, 
Singing a sweet melody, 
What a lullaby is this! 

I see a grave not too small, 
Inside it a child is sleeping, 
His soul is away but where is the soul, 
I shall tell you, wait, and let me fly, 
To the second sky, 
I see the child and other children, 
Making too much noise, 
Playing hide and seek, 
What a game is this! 

I see a grave bigger than the two, 
Inside it a boy is sleeping, 
His soul is away but where is the soul, 
I shall tell you, wait, and let me fly, 
To the third sky, 
I see the boy with a sweet lovely girl, 
They are sharing snacks, 
And cold drink, 
What a drink is this! 

I see again a grave is it, 
Inside it a teenager is sleeping, 
His soul is away but where is the soul, 
I shall tell you, wait, and let me fly, 
To the fourth sky, 
I see the teenager keenly watching, 
The forbidden fruit on the bosom of a tree, 
With his keen thirsty eyes, 
What a fruit is this! 

I see another grave, 
Inside it a naughty youth is sleeping, 
His soul is away but where is the soul, 
I shall tell you, wait, and let me fly, 
To the fifth sky, 
I see the youth with his old girl friend, 
Desirous to taste the fruit, 
But her beauty of refraining, 
What a beauty is refraining! 

I see one more grave, 
Inside it a father is sleeping, 
His soul is away but where is the soul, 
I shall tell you, wait, and let me fly, 
To the sixth sky, 
A lovely woman with all her charms, 
Relieving the father of his pains, 
 And hard working for the child, 
What a child is this! 

I see last of the graves, 
It’s waiting yet for the old grandfather, 
His soul is away but where is the soul, 
I shall tell you, wait, and let me fly, 
To the seventh sky, 
I see nothing an Angel informed, 
His soul is in his lovely grandchild, 
What a grandchild is this


A GRANDCHILD GIVES NEW HOPE IN LIFE

A grandchild gives new hope in life 
An old man plays and says nonsense 
And is happy again-
 
A little smiling child 
Who does not know or understand 
Who cannot speak to me
Gives me hope  again 
And makes me forget 
All my failed ambitions-


Because this small child lives 
I regain my love of life-

What a blessing to be 
A grandfather in my old age. 

Resurrecting life in a desert heat, children play and
compete at Encanto Pool.


Our Granddaughter winning with little effort, smiling
all the way, so proud of her accomplishment.

Standing her ground, gaining courage, being a team
member, helping everyone to become winners. 


For her heart was pounding such
I thought it would leap from her chest
and fall flat onto the cold floor
to slide there to quivering extinction.

Her soul was shriveling such 
that it twined and twisted upon a single thread-
its catchment snapping for the plunge into the river Styx.


Laid down in her cool night, 
misted with early dew in her eyes
she grieved cold, cold upon cold; 
her body shivering.

Vulture claws and talons reached
her Spiritual Keep
and sank their meanness deep
wounding the marrow
of where she lived-
all her treasures now exposed
and her Will raw-tested near impoverishment.
Grandmother cried.


Yet I saw her there over time repose
and recompose and thrust away
these encumberments; 
the dreadful sight of a dead child-our mother, 
birthed, she said from hours labor-
and followed thereafter in days a husband dead
in cancer's clutch-
she sat alone, comfortless
as we children drew near in our bewilderment-
this sense of total demolishment shrouding all around.


Our eyes drew near; we could see
she began to shunt aside fear
transforming herself 
from the Pity-Pyre to new resolve to live again
for the sake and betterment of us-the children.

Clear as the book and the page we could read
Grandmother began repairing heart and sinew, 
face and spirit and like the phoenix bird 
rises before us-new mission ensconced upon her clear.

Steel Purpose all in her she said: 

'I shall be here children, no need to be afraid.'
This is what Grandmothers are for.


'My unseen friends how beautiful you are, 
I haven't seen anything, in this time of ugliness, 
More pretty than you, more lovely than you, 
I have seen photographs, some are current, 
And some when they were half open buds, 
Even then I can imagine how nice the flowers are, 
That spread odor and color in the lonely life, 
Everyday every night their words shine like stars, 
How amazing are these stars, having various costumes, 
Sometimes they appear as a moon in the dark nights, 
Sometimes they appear as a sun in cold winter days, 
And in the heat strokes they enter through windows, 
Like a cool breeze and temperature that is high, 
Due to the heat of friends and acquaintances, 
I see around me and I am tense and sad, 
The magicians come and sing a song for me, 
They play music on various instruments, 
In the early morning it's a flute I listen to, 
During noon one plays a tune on guitar, 
In the evening it's a piano and a violin at night, 
A few are dancers and when they dance, 
My eyelids are closed even then I watch, 
The beauty of their dance amusing and amazing, 
I feel the touch of the soft lovely palm, 
On my forehead and even my heart, 
Is touched by lullabies of the beauty of words, 
Words arranged in beautiful lines, 
A fragrance that shines like a rainbow, 
Yes the fragrance shines because it's a poem, 
A poem having thoughts I personify, 
And I see charming friends, who awake a sleeping child, 
We sing together, we dance together, 
We play many games and when I sleep, 
I see beautiful fairies in a garden of poems, 
Where these friends are turned in trees, 
And the poems appear as green branches, 
And their words as roses and jasmines, 
Different in color and fragrance but flowers, 
In the garden I find myself in a wonderland, 
How beautiful is my life with my unseen friends, 
The magicians who come from various parts, 
Of the world with magic of poetry, 
Once I wished I could meet my friends, 
In the real life but I mended myself, 
Let them shine in a distant Milky Way, 
They are moons and stars if they come to me, 
They may join those whom I see around me.
A distant object is always pretty and nice. 


Man looking into the sea,
taking the view from those who have as much right to it as
           you have to it yourself,
it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing,
but you cannot stand in the middle of this;
the sea has nothing to give but a well excavated grave.
The firs stand in a procession, each with an emerald turkey-
           foot at the top,
reserved as their contours, saying nothing;
repression, however, is not the most obvious characteristic of
           the sea;
the sea is a collector, quick to return a rapacious look.
There are others besides you who have worn that look --
whose expression is no longer a protest; the fish no longer
           investigate them
for their bones have not lasted:
men lower nets, unconscious of the fact that they are
           desecrating a grave,
and row quickly away -- the blades of the oars
moving together like the feet of water-spiders as if there were
           no such thing as death.
The wrinkles progress among themselves in a phalanx -- beautiful 
           under networks of foam,
and fade breathlessly while the sea rustles in and out of the
           seaweed;
the birds swim throught the air at top speed, emitting cat-calls
           as heretofore --
the tortoise-shell scourges about the feet of the cliffs, in motion
           beneath them;
and the ocean, under the pulsation of lighthouses and noise of
           bell-buoys,
advances as usual, looking as if it were not that ocean in which
           dropped things are bound to sink --
in which if they turn and twist, it is neither with volition nor
           consciousness. 


Though life should come
With all its marshalled honours, trump and drum,
To proffer you the captaincy of some
Resounding exploit, that shall fill
Man’s pulses with commemorative thrill,
And be a banner to far battle days
For truths unrisen upon untrod ways,
What would your answer be,
O heart once brave?
Seek otherwhere; for me,
I watch beside a grave.

Though to some shining festival of thought
The sages call you from steep citadel
Of bastioned argument, whose rampart gained
Yields the pure vision passionately sought,
In dreams known well,
But never yet in wakefulness attained,
How should you answer to their summons, save:
I watch beside a grave?

Though Beauty, from her fane within the soul
Of fire-tongued seers descending,
Or from the dream-lit temples of the past
With feet immortal wending,
Illuminate grief’s antre swart and vast
With half-veiled face that promises the whole
To him who holds her fast,
What answer could you give?
Sight of one face I crave,
One only while I live;
Woo elsewhere; for I watch beside a grave.

Though love of the one heart that loves you best,
A storm-tossed messenger,
Should beat its wings for shelter in your breast,
Where clung its last year’s nest,
The nest you built together and made fast
Lest envious winds should stir,
And winged each delicate thought to minister
With sweetness far-amassed
To the young dreams within—
What answer could it win?
The nest was whelmed in sorrow’s rising wave,
Nor could I reach one drowning dream to save;
I watch beside a grave. 


Far from the churchyard dig his grave, 
On some green mound beside the wave; 
To westward, sea and sky alone, 
And sunsets. Put a mossy stone, 
With mortal name and date, a harp 
And bunch of wild flowers, carven sharp; 
Then leave it free to winds that blow, 
And patient mosses creeping; slow, 
And wandering wings, and footsteps rare 
Of human creature pausing there.

'MISERRIMUS,' and neither name nor date,
Prayer, text, or symbol, graven upon the stone;
Nought but that word assigned to the unknown,
That solitary word--to separate
From all, and cast a cloud around the fate
Of him who lies beneath. Most wretched one,
'Who' chose his epitaph?--Himself alone
Could thus have dared the grave to agitate,
And claim, among the dead, this awful crown;
Nor doubt that He marked also for his own 
Close to these cloistral steps a burial-place,
That every foot might fall with heavier tread,
Trampling upon his vileness. Stranger, pass


A GREAT AND UNUSUAL HAPPINESS

A great and unusual happiness 
Came to me 
When I saw and was with my granddaughter-
Her smile at four months 
Her mother’s smile-
Her beauty- the beauty of innocence-

How each little smile of hers
Opened my heart and soul
And made me feel 
As if never before
How simply happy and good life is-


Under a canopy of stars
A full moon rises.
We sip our wine, 
Laugh and talk
By candlelight; 
It’s your deal.
Efficiently you
Shuffle and ruffle
The new deck.
They flap, flap, flap; 
Flutter over one another
From a perfect bow you create
With your hands.
You’re a better player; 
You always win in the end.
I play for fun; 
I win a perfect evening with you. 

She swept me up to the dreamy sky.
Riffs of her music filled my heart.
In her close embrace, I swooned.
Hugged me and kissed me.
I was born again.
Her eyes glinted.
I fell down.
Wounded.
Peach


A great fool is he
Who dares to deny
Your presence, dear.
A great fool is he
Who denies your role
In every action and
In every reaction.

Pardon me, I am
Nothing here
Without you dear.
Pardon me, I dare
Not to utter
Any word, I know
All words are yours. 

A great Hope fell
You heard no noise
The Ruin was within
Oh cunning wreck that told no tale
And let no Witness in

The mind was built for mighty Freight
For dread occasion planned
How often foundering at Sea
Ostensibly, on Land

A not admitting of the wound
Until it grew so wide
That all my Life had entered it
And there were troughs beside

A closing of the simple lid
That opened to the sun
Until the tender Carpenter
Perpetual nail it down -


The Moon weeps for Zimbabwe, 
Proud Lady of Africa, friendless, folorn			
In the winter of her desolation.				
Delighting in her nut brown form				
When we were young, I was her lover, 			
Fed and clothed with her oblation, 				
We flourished, blessed by one another.			

The Moon cries for my chosen country, 			
Great Lady of Africa, focus and womb		
Of freedom.  Lusty, I lay between her breasts, 		
Hungry nipples wet with the wild spume 			
Of my kisses.  In ecstasy, she drew 				
On the strength of my body.  Our guests 			
The gentle milkers, the stars, the morning dew.		

With the Moon I mourn for Zimbabwe
Grief, nostalgia? No! Anguish and pain; 			
Ineffable rage burn deep in my heart, 			
As she lies raped, dishonored, bound in chains		
Between bulls, indifferent executioners, 			
Prepared to be torn apart.					
Does anyone care? Does it matter? 

 

A great man died
And thousands said good-bye 
And I was one of them-

When I die
Only a few will say good-bye-
 
So long as a few who really care 
will able to go on with their lives
without me 
I don't mind-
 
Even those who are not great
Must die 
And said be goodbye to, 
And I one of them-


It was written in marble in golden letters:
here a great man lived and worked and died.
He laid the gravel for these paths personally.
This bench — do not touch — he chiseled by himself
   out of stone.
And — careful, three steps — we're going inside.

He made it into the world at just the right time.
Everything that had to pass, passed in this house.
Not in a high rise,
not in square feet, furnished yet empty,
amidst unknown neighbors,
on some fifteenth floor,
where it's hard to drag school field trips.

In this room he pondered,
in this chamber he slept,
and over here he entertained guests.
Portraits, an armchair, a desk, a pipe, a globe, a flute,
a worn-out rug, a sun room.
From here he exchanged nods with his tailor and
   shoemaker
who custom made for him.

This is not the same as photographs in boxes,
dried out pens in a plastic cup,
a store-bought wardrobe in a store-bought closet,
a window, from which you can see clouds better
   than people.


Happy? Unhappy?
That's not relevant here.
He still confided in his letters,
without thinking they would be opened on their
   way.
He still kept a detailed and honest diary,
without the fear that he would lose it during a
   search.
The passing of a comet worried him most.
The destruction of the world was only in the hands

He still managed not to die in the hospital,
behind a white screen, who knows which one.
There was still someone with him who remembered
his muttered words.


He partook of life
as if it were reusable:
he sent his books to be bound;
he wouldn't cross out the last names of the dead from
   his address book.
And the trees he had planted in the garden behind
   the house
grew for him as Juglans regia
and Quercus rubra and Ulmus and Larix
and Fraxinus excelsior.




Admired and enjoyed, 
As a guide I deployed, 
Messages I found, 
In her poems so profound, 
Her messages of ethics, 
Her sense of civics, 
A true loving heart, 
In the battle with thwart! 

Always wins the wars, 
She's Venus in stars, 
A candle although old, 
But her flame is gold, 
A beacon on the shore, 
Guess her and adore, 
You know her well, 
A melodious bell! 

When my brain is tired, 
I am not admired, 
Inspiration I need, 
Then my childish greed, 
Looks her for a feed, 
And a flower I read, 
Fragrance of her flower, 
Is an inspiring shower! 

Should I take her name? 
Watch the Hall of Fame, 
Pick your lovely choice, 
And listen to the voice, 
Of the lady with grace, 
What a smiling face! 
Or remain in suspense, 
I am too much dense! 


My Dear Friend, your guess is wrong, 
No more teasing, now I don't prolong, 
Her love children you see every night, 
And in the sun you see her light, 
Her love children are the beautiful flowers, 
Her love children are the pleasant showers, 
Her favorite child is the beautiful moon, 
She believes in love and love is a boon. 


I have my own 
Appliance for
Reducing sounds
But I am talkative.

I am free and so
You cann't force me
To talk only in
Mother-tongue.

And what is a 
Mother-tongue? 
Is earth not
The mother? 

Hereafter, reign
A great silence. 


The day when I met you
Your attitude impressed me in my mind and heart
You are known to everyone as a great yesterday 
soldier for our country.
You were distinguished soldier, an officer, 
a man among men.
You are the most valuable gift for our country
Your contribution to the World War II is unforgettable.
Your Knowledge on military is a precious gift for
our young soldiers.
You loved our country and you did the best for her.
Today, you are away from us, living by yourself
Your marched forward legs are stands still today.
You be the best what ever you are and where ever you are.
But the love you have shown on us will 
cherish in our heart forever. 
As bible says LOVE is patient and kind 
and let that faith surround you.
You are a great soldier for the all time 
and yet to be seen




with the happiness
of others, 
To feel sad
with the sadness
of others.
A great thing by
a great soul really. 


Sweet Chance, that led my steps abroad, 
Beyond the town, where wild flowers grow -- 
How rich and great the times are now! 
Know, all ye sheep 
And cows, that keep 
On staring that I stand so long 
In grass that's wet from heavy rain -- 
A rainbow and a cuckoo's song 
May never come together again; 
May never come 
This side the tomb. 


What is human kind? 
What is its value? 
What is its purpose? 

The answers. 
Often considered weak
Human kind
in acts of kindness



Once he said to me.
"Become so still you hear the blood flowing 
through your veins."

One night as I sat in quiet,
I seemed on the verge of entering a world inside so vast
I know it is the source of 
all of
us. 

in the beginning..
it was a colour, 
a colour decided to be a poem
and it was.
so fresh and green, 
as green as olive trees..
shining in jerusalem, 
scattering peace and wishes..
as sacred pearls, 
to all lovers and pilgrims
i saw that poem..
in a green voice..
coming from light remains, 
by the right place of tur mountain
as it was sung by saints and angels
and manifested by the holy spirit, ..
who wrote it's title, 
before the dawn does plant..
the dancing of wishes, 
to be forever green

 

Good morning, Life--and all 
Things glad and beautiful. 
My pockets nothing hold, 
But he that owns the gold, 
The Sun, is my great friend-- 
His spending has no end. 

Hail to the morning sky, 
Which bright clouds measure high; 
Hail to you birds whose throats 
Would number leaves by notes; 
Hail to you shady bowers, 
And you green field of flowers. 

Hail to you women fair, 
That make a show so rare 
In cloth as white as milk-- 
Be't calico or silk: 
Good morning, Life--and all 
Things glad and beautiful. 


As we hurry away to the end, my friend, 
 Of this sad little farce called existence, 
We are sure that the future will bring one thing, 
 And that is the grave in the distance.
And so when our lives run along all wrong, 
 And nothing seems real or certain, 
We can comfort ourselves with the thought (or not) 
 Of that spectre behind the curtain.

But we haven’t much time to repine or whine, 
 Or to wound or jostle each other; 
And the hour for us each is to-day, I say, 
 If we mean to assist a brother.
And there is no pleasure that earth gives birth, 
 But the worry it brings is double; 
And all that repays for the strife of life, 
 Is helping some soul in trouble.

I tell you, if I could go back the track
 To my life’s morning hour, 
I would not set forth, seeking name or fame, 
 Or that poor bauble called power.
I would be like the sunlight, and live to give; 
 I would lend, but I would not borrow; 
Nor would I be blind and complain of pain, 
 Forgetting the meaning of sorrow.

This world is a vaporous jest at best, 
 Tossed off by the gods in laughter; 
And a cruel attempt at wit were it
 If nothing better came after.
It is reeking with hearts that ache and break, 
 Which we ought to comfort and strengthen, 
As we hurry away to the end, my friend, 
 And the shadows behind us lengthen.


'There is no grief
which time does not lessen
or soften' -
so said Cicero, a man so often right; 
a Stoic, those for whom
all life presents a lesson
to be learned from, 
and then, to move on from..

But I wonder about all this: 
is grief ever lessened or softened? 
Is it not, perhaps, overlaid
in our so various ways? 

For some, grief framed and falsified
to ease that grief; 

For some, like hyacinths and crocus bulbs, 
left in a dark cupboard in the autumn of our grief
to respond to time, and
become at last
themselves? 


gently, gently, the covers pulled
over the loving bed, 
the true, the pure, the lovely painful grief, 
the memory deep cherished, 
gently, gently, folded
into the cupboards of the heart

there to be known, without the door disturbed
until the time - 'a grief ago' as Dylan wrote -
the cupboard opened only for love's sake
without grief. : 
those carefully folded memories
brought out and loved
and lived a while



not grief, not grief.  

but
the pure memory of grief

and behold, 
life. 


A grief ago,
She who was who I hold, the fats and the flower,
Or, water-lammed, from the scythe-sided thorn,
Hell wind and sea,
A stem cementing, wrestled up the tower,
Rose maid and male,
Or, master venus, through the paddler's bowl
Sailed up the sun;

Who is my grief,
A chrysalis unwrinkling on the iron,
Wrenched by my fingerman, the leaden bud
Shot through the leaf,
Was who was folded on the rod the aaron
Road east to plague,
The horn and ball of water on the frog
Housed in the side.

And she who lies,
Like exodus a chapter from the garden,
Brand of the lily's anger on her ring,
Tugged through the days
Her ropes of heritage, the wars of pardon,
On field and sand
The twelve triangles of the cherub wind
Engraving going.

Who then is she,
She holding me? The people's sea drives on her,
Drives out the father from the caesared camp;
The dens of shape
Shape all her whelps with the long voice of water,
That she I have,
The country-handed grave boxed into love,
Rise before dark.

The night is near,
A nitric shape that leaps her, time and acid;
I tell her this: before the suncock cast
Her bone to fire,
Let her inhale her dead, through seed and solid
Draw in their seas,
So cross her hand with their grave gipsy eyes,
And close her fist. 





'Time is running out
for the one who thought
he was above

He is his father's son
he did what he had done
a groomer through and through

Now he has to pay
for what he has done
he'd better pray to god
the law gets him
before someone else does


A poet is a grown-up child, anyhow, 
He couldn’t compose, otherwise-
A poet is an adorer of queerness, 
A bit - willful, a bit - precise-

"Hunting is a game of chance, "
We’ve forgotten that well-known phrase, 
And we must remember that kids
Are forbidden to play such games. 


An apple a day 
keeps the doctor away 
is a proverb; 

Alas! the cost of an apple 
is more than twenty rupee; 

It does not suit everybody's pocket, 
So go to another alternative fruit, 
Cost effective to all purse
and competitive in price; 

Take it as a policy, 
A Guava fruit a day 
keeps diabetes away, 
It is a new saying to follow from today. 


Brunhilde Bloggs no fixed address.
Was very fond of cheap red wine.
Somewhat disordered in her dress.
Her voice a grating nasal whine.

She begs for cash from passersby.
Her manner almost threatening.
Her raging thirst to satisfy
 at each refusal glowering.


  A policeman tells her "move along"
 and she reacts aggressively 
Insists she has done nothing wrong.
 But he has little sympathy

He has no choice but to arrest
 and take her into custody.
 She has become a public pest.
 Which no one is allowed to be

Brunhilde Bloggs has an address 
at least for several months to come.
She got what she deserved no less
 but she was luckier than some.  

Who passed out cold and froze to death 
in some back alley out of sight.
A victim to cold winters breath
 in drunken dreams of sheer delight.




You are sitting on the bank of a lake, 
Engaged in fishing and smoking with silence, 
You are not interested in a particular fish, 
Depending entirely on your fate for the day.

The fish may be beautiful or may be ugly, 
A friend of your system or harmful for it, 
It may suit to your taste, 
Or just a food, for your hunger, so wild.

You are hungry and thirsty, 
Just need a fish, 
Being called by instinct.
Whether moral or immoral.

Bring your ears a little closer to my mouth, 
Hunger of the girls are more intense, 
But they know it well, 
They may fish a snake.
What is inside the lake, 
You are completely unaware, 


A man who is never sentimental, 
Always discussing philosophy and ethics, 
Always busy in business dynamics, 
And not admires you when you're emotional, 
Is merely a book to be kept on the shelf, 
Not for reading by your loving self, 

A man who is always sentimental, 
In a minute he is happy and cross in the next, 
Is a write on computer an editable text, 
Carefully handle him, may be too fatal.
Treat him like a child and keep him busy, 
Better you get rid of this man so fussy.

A man who is sentimental only sometimes, 
Understands your emotions and knows you well, 
Stands by you in paradise or hell, 
Suits to you like beautiful rhymes.
May be your partner for the whole of life, 
Love him, marry him, be his wife. 


Next doors’ grass had greened
and the honeyed light of autumn
spread thickly over thirsty trees
not quite ready to turn.

I heard her ugly honking.
Incongruous really, 
considering the feathered charm
and pert uprightness 
of her maternity.

Her four new chicks
were cute and ping-pong light -
their day old voices peeping, 
their yellow legs a-creeping
like ants around her.

Next day she honked again -
but alas, I was too late! 
My canine scavenger
was sunning herself
guiltily on the back step -
a mouthful of feathers
palpable evidence of her crime.

Miss P honked again
and strode aggressively up the drive.
Her sole surviving chick 
scuttled after her.

A few days later
I heard her honking sadly.
This time she walked alone. 


Someone has, as it were, thrown away a dark net
and the town has become a trout in that net; 
no morning, as it were, has ever approached here, 
the town has submerged in an overflowing darkness.

The town seems to be the island of a fairy tale.
I wonder who are, like giants, snatching away
the ornament of the forehead of a teen girl 
and devouring then the bone-marrow in rapture.

I wonder who, by tearing up the civilization, 
are eating up finally its bones and flesh.
Hadn't ever a single monk or saint come  
amid this darkness here? 
 

If it happens so, then you, o poet, take up the charge
and play the guitar of light in this darkness.



  a man with rights
a gun at his side
no reason to fight
act as a cowboy in the past

a gun, a man, and a wisdom
fire anyone, random
a car, a child, even a wall
rush to greet the deathly call

are we in war? 
why blood flooding on my floor? 
while the silent Parliament
still hold on in his old brand

a nation with its laws
all the world see your show
the rights of the gun
a player has some fun

until when this will end? 
how many life have to be sent? 
might you finally understand
and make a better amendment

a man who isn't blind
a pen as a gun
please give us a good sign
for the future of our sons



in a dress 
I suddenly find  
a sea of laughing faces  

apparently
I misunderstood  
just what a drag race is


a windy evening, 
I hear my stomach grumbling ~
neighbour's barbecuea sudden strong wind, 
leaves pile up at neighbor's yard
I stopped the rakingbetween me and my peony ~
              the changing
                           of seasons


                           it's been dull
until. 
the peoniesa stormy cloud clears
over the washed-glass windows -
after the rainfallthe air fell silent~
every now and then
a coyote howlsreading outdoor, 
the wind flips the pages
of my memoryafter working out, 
my sweat 
finds a cleavage

New Year's Eve
a drunk poet face-to-face
with the moon


I wanted to leave you a note but. 

In the weak breeze the sunshine yields. 
There is a bell upon the fields. 
On the long hedgerow's tangled run 
A low white cottage intervenes: 
Against the wall a blind man leans, 
And sways his face to have the sun. 
Our horses' hoofs stir in the road, 
Quiet and sharp. Light hath a song 
Whose silence, being heard, seems long. 
The point of noon maketh abode, 
And will not be at once gone through. 
The sky's deep colour saddens you, 
And the heat weighs a dreamy load. 

The road led straight to the temple.
Notre Dame, though not Gothic at all.
The huge doors were closed.  I chose one on the side, 
Not to the main building-to its left wing, 
The one in green copper, worn into gaps below.
I pushed.  Then it was revealed: 
An astonishing large hall, in warm light.
Great statues of sitting women-goddesses, 
In draped robes, marked it with a rhythm.

Color embraced me like the interior of a purple-brown flower
Of unheard-of size.  I walked, liberated
From worries, pangs of conscience, and fears.
I knew I was there as one day I would be.
I woke up serene, thinking that this dream
Answers my question, often asked: 
How is it when one passes the last threshold


First Love's Touch, 
mutual gathering was only through them, 
our Hands.

We poets celebrate
Hearts and Souls; 
Love too wields magic, 
but neglect too often
those stalwart two-
the human hands-
we're birth'd with.


Entwined most
in our Corporeal Destinies
yet hands occupy
in the Pantheon of Graces
a position lower than should be.

Consider birth's first
is a touching hand.


First our eyes open 
then
we are lifted by them.

Is not reaching for love
first with these twins? 

Was not my First Love
first touched by them? 

Did we not, we two, hold hands
along the heart-way walkways? 

Did not these two first wave
sweet hellos and partings? 

What poet's mind could word
without them? 


Alas, too, it was these two 
which fluttered dismissively
signaling
First Love was leaving.


At death's bed 
the last we reach
for nurse, loved ones
or darlings, 
with be with these two hands, 
when from this world departing.

Is not electricity
generated by them
in the touching of our bodies? 

Are not hands reaching on the Grecian Urn
expressing love's startings, 
it's yawlings and yearnings? 

I will die
as we all will-
its hands that will pray for me.

Coffin bound
I will lay, 
my two hands crossing.

I am touched by loving hands
from birth
to Death's Regarding.

All my life these two ambassadors
convey 
sweet touches
to me and from me
to others.

The tear of child
is reached by these
and Child Worlds mended.

Lover, I 
have only these
to express what 
what my Heart says
Love Is.


In the end
cry for them too: 
Fluttering Twins, 
unsung, 
ungraced, 
each hand- 
perforce
will reach out
one to each-
one floating flower to another. 


Shadows of birds and things flittering about, 
casting their patterns of darkness into my 
mind's catacombs.  

Always brought forward when they are ready to 
enjoy their freedom in a hand-held poem. 

HOLD it up sternly! See this it sends back! (Who is it? Is it you?)
   Outside fair costume--within ashes and filth,
   No more a flashing eye--no more a sonorous voice or springy step;
   Now some slave's eye, voice, hands, step,
   A drunkard's breath, unwholesome eater's face, venerealee's flesh,
   Lungs rotting away piecemeal, stomach sour and cankerous,
   Joints rheumatic, bowels clogged with abomination,
   Blood circulating dark and poisonous streams,
   Words babble, hearing and touch callous,
   No brain, no heart left--no magnetism of sex;                      
   Such, from one look in this looking-glass ere you go hence,
   Such a result so soon--and from such a beginning!


'I can fashion with my hands, ' he said
an empty space
with which I can then shape
a shape
that is round 
and reminds
me of you and I.


A swift
swooping move
draws your smile
mid-air; 
a wavy motion
elicits memories of us
spooning on moonlit nights.

I draw an oval
within which we 
are framed-
our love-lined photograph.

I can take your hands
and place them in mine
slipping on your finger
a ring
hoping on forever.


You say yes
and my hands
flutter
a happy
quivering-
clasping yours
to steady them-
and my happy heart
is now covered with 
yet another 
happy hand
smiling; 
yours-
the one with the ring. 


If I can but see
those reaching arms before me, 

feel flat against my chest
your welcoming breasts; 

for me this would content.

If I could but feel
that dizzying quivering
your touch makes, 

that for me would content.


If I can see
my own soul stirrings
in your beckoning eyes, 
my contour
fitting your contour
perfectly, 

I'd sigh
the perfect sigh.


So close we; 
paper  thin
the space between; 

that all points of contact
blend 
smooth skin
against smooth skin.
.
Give me your handkerchief; 
wave it 
before me; 

and here is mine
in sweet
surrender, 
buffeted
by that perfect breeze; 
my
and your
deep breathing
brings.
mutually; 

handkerchiefed. 


A happy accident

Alone. Alone always alone
 The warmth of love I’d never known. 
Conceived upon a one night stand
 and then abandoned out of hand.

Nobody ever wanted me.
It seemed I was condemned to be 
unloved unwanted and alone
My heart grew cold and turned to stone.

I could not love, no one showed me
 affection: I could not see 
that to receive I had to give. 
And so I lived in misery.  

I grew up in an orphanage 
until I had attained the age.
When they considered I should be.
 Grown up enough to be set free.

Not their responsibility
and that is how I came to be.
 A dweller in bed sitter land. 
Nobody seemed to understand.

Just how lonely life can be
I knew that no one cared for me.
I thought that no one ever would
 nor could I see why they should.

Until one day I found a friend
 my loneliness was at an end. 
She was an orphan just like me
 and had endured the misery.
 
 Of feeling that she was alone 
unwanted  too by anyone.
I needed her she needed me
We learned together we could be.


Good friends who earned each others trust
 and very  slowly to adjust.
 Adopt a different point of view 
and realise it was not true.

   That we were not unlovable 
and that we were  quite capable
of giving and receiving love
A treasure which we rate above.

All of the trapping of success
To suffer no more loneliness 
To love and be loved in return
 A lesson that we had to learn.
 
 Which banished all our misery.
Now we are married happily.
 And have two children of our own
Deep love has from a friendship grown.



Two people at the crossroads
Of a happy and loving life
For years they were together
But never became husband and wife
 
They shared their joys together
As well as all the tears
The good times they had together
As well as their fears
 
They raised a couple of children
Who always showed respect
A good effort that is made
A good result is what you get
 
But now they're at the crossroads
Of a long and beautiful life
Deep inside his one regret
That he never made her his wife
 
But she didn't want to marry
For reasons all her own
But that did not prevent them
From building a warm and loving home
 
So now as the sun begins to set
On two people growing old
Their love was like a fairy tale
Their story seldom told
 
So many years together 
So many memories they shared
But through it all what keep them close
Was because for each other they always cared


and read till the light was gone and the book
was no more than a part of the darkness. 
I could easily have switched on a lamp, 
but I wanted to ride this day down into night,
to sit alone and smooth the unreadable page 
with the pale gray ghost of my hand. 

Live and let others live that's what I can say, 
A happy and prosperous life I pray, 
My beloved granddaughter was born today, 
I love this day and one, who was born on this day, 
My love, well wishes and joys to stay, 
All pains and sorrows I brutally slay, 
Smile whole night and smile whole day, 
Sing and dance how much you may, 
Enjoy this life as it's nothing but a play, 
Beautiful returns of the charming day, 
What a reason to be happy for tearing clay, 


Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? 
I think I'd better not because you'll say
'You silly cow, you know I hate the heat.
It makes me cross and grumpy, and I'll beat

The living daylights out of those who sigh
And dream beneath a cloudless summer sky.'
How sad for you, the Aussie eye of heaven
Shines hot and hellish from around eleven.

By three o-clock you're panting in the heat.
This blood summer really has you beat.
Oh what the heck, no matter what you say.
Let's have a drink and celebrate YOUR day.


So long as you can breathe and I can see.
So long we'll share this muse called poetry. 

My mother stands at the screen door, laughing.
"Out out damn Spot," she commands our silly dog.
I wonder what this means. I rise into adult air

like a hollyhock, I’m so proud to be loved
like this. The air is tight to my nervous body.
I use new clothes and shoes the way the corn-studded

soil around here uses nitrogen, giddily.
Ohio, Ohio, Ohio. Often I sing
to myself all day like a fieldful of August

insects, just things I whisper, really,
a trance in sneakers. I’m learning
to read from my mother and soon I’ll go to school,

I hate it when anyone dies or leaves and the air 
goes slack around my body and I have to hug myself,
a cloud, an imaginary friend, the stream in the road-

side park. I love to be called for dinner.
Spot goes out and I go in and the lights
in the kitchen go on and the dark,

which also has a body like a cloud’s,
leans lightly against the house. Tomorrow
I’ll find the sweat stains it left, little grey smudges.


Here’s a sky no higher than a street lamp,
and a stack of morning papers cinched by wire.


A stout dog, vaguely beagle,
minces over the dry, fresh-fallen snow;
and here’s our sleep-sodden paperboy
with his pliers, his bike, his matronly dog,

his unclouding face set for paper route
like an alarm clock. Here’s a memory
in the making, for this could be the morning

he doesn’t come home and his parents
two hours later drive his route until
they find him asleep, propped against a street lamp,

his papers all delivered and his dirty paper-
satchel slack, like an emptied lung,
and he blur-faced and iconic in the morning

air rinsing itself a paler and paler blue
through which a last few dandruff-flecks
of snow meander casually down.

The dog squeaks in out of the dark,
snuffling me too me too. And here he goes
home to memory, and to hot chocolate

on which no crinkled skin forms like infant ice,
and to the long and ordinary day,
school, two triumphs and one severe

humiliation on the playground, the past
already growing its scabs, the busride home,
dinner, and evening leading to sleep

like the slide that will spill him out, come June,
into the eye-reddening chlorine waters
of the municipal pool. Here he goes to bed.

Kiss. Kiss. Teeth. Prayers. Dark. Dark.
Here the dog lies down by his bed,
and sighs and farts. Will he always be

this skinny, chicken-bones?
He’ll remember like a prayer
how his mother made breakfast for him

every morning before he trudged out
to snip the papers free. Just as
his mother will remember she felt

guilty never to wake up with him
to give him breakfast. It was Cream
of Wheat they always or never had together.

It turns out you are the story of your childhood
and you’re under constant revision,
like a lonely folktale whose invisible folks

are all the selves you’ve been, lifelong,
shadows in fog, grey glimmers at dusk.
And each of these selves had a childhood

it traded for love and grudged to give away,
now lost irretrievably, in storage
like a set of dishes from which no food,

no Cream of Wheat, no rabbit in mustard
sauce, nor even a single raspberry,
can be eaten until the afterlife,

which is only childhood in its last
disguise, all radiance or all humiliation,
and so it is forfeit a final time.


In fact it was awful, you think, or why
should the piecework of grief be endless?
Only because death is, and likewise loss,

which is not awful, but only breathtaking.
There’s no truth about your childhood,
though there’s a story, yours to tend,

like a fire or garden. Make it a good one,
since you’ll have to live it out, and all
its revisions, so long as you all shall live,

for they shall be gathered to your deathbed,
and they’ll have known to what you and they
would come, and this one time they’ll weep for you.

The map in the shopping center has an X
signed "you are here." A dream is like that.
In a dream you are never eighty, though

you may risk death by other means:
you’re on a ledge and memory calls you
to jump, but a deft cop talks you in

to a small, bright room, and snickers.
And in a dream, you’re everyone somewhat,
but not wholly. I think I know how that

works: for twenty-one years I had a father
and then I became a father, replacing him
but not really. Soon my sons will be fathers.

Surely, that’s what middle-aged means,
being father and son to sons and father.
That a male has only one mother is another

story, told wherever men weep wholly.
Though nobody’s replaced. In one dream
I’m leading a rope of children to safety,

through a snowy farm. The farmer comes out
and I have to throw snowballs well to him
so we may pass. Even dreaming, I know

he’s my father, at ease in his catcher’s
squat, and that the dream has revived
to us both an old unspoken fantasy:

we’re a battery. I’m young, I’m brash,
I don’t know how to pitch but I can
throw a lamb chop past a wolf. And he

can handle pitchers and control a game.
I look to him for a sign. I’d nod
for anything. The damn thing is hard to grip

without seams, and I don’t rely only
on my live, young arm, but throw by all
the body I can get behind it, and it fluffs

toward him no faster than the snow
in the dream drifts down. Nothing
takes forever, but I know what the phrase

means. The children grow more cold
and hungry and cruel to each other
the longer the ball’s in the air, and it begins

to melt. By the time it gets to him we’ll be
our waking ages, and each of us is himself
alone, and we all join hands and go.

Toward dawn, rain explodes on the tin roof
like popcorn. The pale light is streaked by grey
and that green you see just under the surface

of water, a shimmer more than a color.
Time to dive back into sleep, as if into
happiness, that neglected discipline 

In those sixth-grade book reports
you had to say if the book was optimistic
or not, and everyone looked at you

the same way: how would he turn out?
He rolls in his sleep like an otter.
Uncle Ed has a neck so fat it’s funny,

and on the way to work he pries the cap
off a Pepsi. Damn rain didn’t cool one weary
thing for long; it’s gonna be a cooker.

The boy sleeps with a thin chain of sweat
on his upper lip, as if waking itself,
becoming explicit, were hard work.


Who knows if he’s happy or not?
A child is all the tools a child has,
growing up, who makes what he can.


A happy lip—breaks sudden—
It doesn't state you how
It contemplated—smiling—
Just consummated—now—
But this one, wears its merriment
So patient—like a pain—
Fresh gilded—to elude the eyes
Unqualified, to scan—


When these graven lines you see, 
Traveller, do not pity me; 
Though I be among the dead, 
Let no mournful word be said.

Children that I leave behind, 
And their children, all were kind; 
Near to them and to my wife, 
I was happy all my life.

My three sons I married right, 
And their sons I rocked at night; 
Death nor sorrow never brought 
Cause for one unhappy thought.

Now, and with no need of tears, 
Here they leave me, full of years,-- 
Leave me to my quiet rest 
In the region of the blest. 

How lucky could I get
I have two sons with no regrets
They are my heart and soul
Forever as I grow old


It seems they test me each day
But all my love I still send their way
They are my day, they are my night
In my mind they are never out of sight

My live is lived just for them
It's hard to remember way back when
When they weren't a part of me
Now their smiling faces I always see

When the world starts to get me down
They cheer me up by being around
When my heart is feeling pain
It goes away when they call my name


When I hear them say mom
All is good, all is calm


Another year, so cruel and so unkind, 
Has now entered in the dark black hole, 
Still dances on earth its porn whole sole, 
A year has gone another is born, 
With the same sharpness of deadly horn, 
Unpredictable infant with tightly closed palms, 
Pinching hairs I see on its knife like arms, 
I could have described hopefully its charms, 
But I see it has come with black storms.

Many believe in forecasts and predictions, 
But I smile on it, I prefer calculations, 
Based on truthful ground realities, 
Facts and figures! Calculate cruelties, 
I am also a human I believe in hope. 
Dangerous is the height, we walk on a rope, 
And the air that is blowing now a days, 
Is the worst enemy that always betrays! 
Satanic agents who support the terror? 
I lack courage, can't work as a mirror! 
We all are cowards and can't be truthful, 
So how can I hope for a year beautiful! 
But as an optimistic I hope and pray, 
A happy new year, be it so, it may


I will love again; I will.
Not a soul is safe.
I'll throw my heart unto the world: 
I'll share it for I've faith.

Shall I need to paint it red; 
It will be fresh and fair: 
My hands will bleed from washing it.
There will be a happy pair

Storm blown ripples
line my weathered brow, 
face a map of life’s journey, 
of striving, disappointments
happiness and joy.


The winds of sorrow, 
and displeasure have
left their mark on 
my furrowed brow, but
my sparkling crows feet, 
eyes, are happy lines.


Although
the sad waters have left
their lines of memory, 
there are no tears
for past events to fill up
dry lakes of discontent, 
and my now happy smile, 
helps smooth the waters of
my still much wrinkled face.


Flowers of hope have opened, 
blossoms of bliss bloomed, 
and seas of tranquillity and
peace now fill my soul and
my heart is filled with love.

All thoughts of past and future
displaced through practice, 
meditation, quietness, being
still; these daily moments of 
calm, bring a realisation that 
to be happy I must only 
live now, in present moment, 
for as each moment dies, 
for me, a new one is born.



I was just sitting here doing my thing
Whistling a tune, started to sing
When all of a sudden, I realised
Why it's our song I am singing
And tears welled up in my eyes

Oh but my love, they are happy tears
I long for you & no longer have fears
If there is one thing I have learned
It is that true love always finds a way
And it will be ours, come what may


Come into my open arms
and I’ll chase away your fears, 
feed your empty aching need
and dry up all your tears.

To the lonely, weary traveler, 
my heart’s a soothing balm; 
a harbor from the storm tossed seas, 
a respite and a calm.

So come to me and rest your head, 
here upon my breast, 
lay down your heavy burdens
and take much needed rest.

All things change soon enough
and this, too, will fade away, 
the heart will mend, the storm will cease, 
and tomorrow’s a brand new day. 

A hater he came and sat by a ditch,
And he took an old cracked lute;
And he sang a song which was more of a screech
'Gainst a woman that was a brute. 


Diamonds of creamed

  
 misty-pearl
Hang in the dank  air.

Soundless, 

.  the thick calm unfurls
On every leaf there.

The woodland bathes

  
. in the hush.
Shadows are pregnant
With wait, 

 while the deeps of lush
Green sigh, 

  .  . .   and childlike
I stand in awe, 

  .  . ..  undisturbed.
The hushed quiet seeps

  .  .. 

into my psyche.

Nothing stirs to break

   

the awesome scene.
Hauntingly placid, 

  .  . .  transcendent
And spectred

  .  .. with sensation, 
This heals with a peace

  
.   which stills
My mind so serenely. 


When you leave a room forever
(As a hotel room, or a waiting room in some foreign town) , 
Though you know you may never go there again, 
It pull's on your mind's substance, somehow
Acquiring an existence larger than life, 
Imbuing your memory, with the breath of expectation: 
Uncomplete, never finished.

You probe your mind afterwards, wondering
What was left undone, unsaid, unthought, unaccomplished.
You realize this place will stay with you indefinitely, 
An alternate stillborn, stubborn dimension
Where some microcosmic quanta of self remains aware; 
Un-decomposing, not recoverable.


We miss so much of the bigger picture, 
Is it surprising things might go on beneath the surface; 
Imagining we are within feet of others, who should have inhabited
All our waking days; or near the grave of someone
Hidden beneath our sight, who should have been
Our nearest and dearest; but through chance or mundane error, 
Now they are become only thin, ghostly fingers
Prickling at our brain-pans, like a haunted deja-vu. 


A hauntingly beautiful dream is 
in the power of everyone.

To be the best you can be, and to
profit from your gifts.

Fulfilling the potential you have
seen in all your dreams.

To always feel balanced in your
mind.

Never to allow negativity to
dominate your thoughts.

To love those who love you with
endearing actions, and thoughts.

To furnish your larder with wholesome
foods.

Never to waste your talents, but to 
enhance through actions, and education.

Giving generously of yourself to those
who need your help.

Participating in life to the fullest 
extent without sacrificing your energy, 

Walking tall no matter your disabilities 
head held high.

Being a friend to those who value your 
kindness, and those who need you.

Giving of yourself to assist those less
fortunate.

Using only resources that are needed 
without waste.

And most of all be yourself to you, 
including everyone else.

Love is a hauntingly beautiful word.
Its essence flows over all endearing.

Enfolding, and caressing it glows bright.
Love is a word of joy for all to hear.

Its meaning is clear, and received dear.
Love means what it says, and in mind it stays.

Love is never lost but lives eternally.
Being in love is a sight to behold by all.

This old house out in the country
Surely, isn't much to see, 
With it's sagging walls and chimneys, 
Yet, it's still a home for me.

It has served a useful purpose
For a hundred years, or more; 
And has welcomed many faces
Through it's wide and gracious door.

Like a mother toiling ever, 
It has lost it's shape, once trim, 
And it's style is long outmoded
By more youthful ones with vim.

Now it sits on it's foundation, 
Sinking slowly in the sand, 
Tired from all it's years of serving; 
How it needs a helping hand.

No, I would not take a million
For this tired old place of mine, 
Because a house is really home
When it has weathered with the time. 

The harvest soon comes
A hawk's eye is needed now
Two watching a front


I'm lying here, wide awake
Trying hard to get some sleep; 
But my brain is totally buzzing, 
So it's useless counting sheep! 

My mind is manically racing, 
Thinking of words and ideas; 
I think of the sad poem that I just wrote, 
And my eyes suddenly fill up with tears. 

I need to get some sleep, 
As I'm actually pretty tired; 
But my brain is so alive: 
Like, it's been electrically wired! 

Many times, I've had new thoughts, 
And jumped out of my cosy bed, 
To quickly grab a pen and paper, 
And jot them down before they leave my head. 

Is this a common problem, 
Which all writers share? 
Do they, too, wake up the next day 
Feeling a little worse for wear

My hands are folded as i bow down and pray
My expectant heart is waiting for you to say
Go in peace, rise my child, don't worry
I will be here for you till eternity

say your word, and i promise you
My heart, my mind, just for you
Seeking your face wherever you go.


I need your healing touch now
I need your comfort, your peace
I need to relax, to be calm
Touch me and i will be healed

To you I come for mercy and grace
To you I uncover my wounds
To you i bare my shame
Just for you, i will show outwardly
That I owe you worship and my adoration.

And then i am in peace
In the thought of your love
Finding rest in the assurance
That you will hear me.



With memories old and wishes new
We crown our cups again,
And here's to you, and here's to you
With love that ne'er shall wane!
And may you keep, at sixty-seven,
The joy of earth, the hope of heaven,
And fame well-earned, and friendship true,
And peace that comforts every pain,
And faith that fights the battle through,
And all your heart's unbounded wealth,
And all your wit, and all your health,--
Yes, here's a hearty health to you,
And here's to you, and here's to you,
Long life to you


Everybody wants
A healthy body
A compassionate heart
A fine smooth mind
A skin that glows
Hairs that are soft
And freely flow
As smooth as silk
As soft as a cloud
The one who has them
Makes him feel proud
To have a body like this
One does not have to do
Anything special
Has to develop
The habit of excercise
Do not eat food
That is junk and greasy
Respect and preserve
The gift god has given to you 
Take Care of your body
The body shall keep you
And your heart happy
Throughout your life
Disease
Shall not come
Near you  
Love your body
It shall love you
Never forget 
A healthy body means
A healthy mind


The scales on my eyes now removed 
I can see the error of my ways
I had protected myself from infectious diseases
Yet continually ignored and neglected my inner most being
Always concerned about bacteria or viruses invading the host
Colds and influenza taking up permanent residence
I began eating plenty of vegetables and fruit
Handfuls of supplements I would digest and pass
Within so many pools of expensive green urine
That even my bladder had to laugh-
When in the end all that really mattered
Was that my sins had been washed clean
By the blood the Savior had shed for me

I have a heart
that shows me LOVE

I have a heart
that tells me I`m
in LOVE with you


A night between t. March and t. April, Two thousand eight, 
Nature arrested my naughty heart, 
The juvenile delinquent was charged of a sexy naught, 
The whole day it was restless and I thought it's a gastric pain, 
Excessive use of Chooran, (Salts mainly Ammonium Chloride) , 
Started dancing in the arteries, I never knew they are blocked, 
Salts increased Blood Pressure that caused a mild heart attack, 
The specialist sentenced my heart for a boring imprisonment of a few days in CCU, 
Whereat Angiography revealed blockages of the sins in various arteries, 
Ranging from per cent to per cent, 
I told my beloved the artery that is blocked per cent, 
Seems the sin of your love, she smiled and asked, 
What about others? 
The specialist who knew my family history, 
Interrupted and said it's genetic, 
No need of worry, you are an stable patient, 
I said I don't know what a stable patient is, 
He replied, "You have no other disease, 
Neither high blood pressure, or the sugar problem

"
What a foolish doctor! He is not a poet! 
If he would be a poet he must have known, 
The juvenile delinquency of love affairs, 
Blocks arteries and the valves of the heart, 
Instead of advising no more love affairs, 
He forbade the meat eating and chewing tobacco, 
He didn't like the poem of heart attack, 
Disliked it and made an indecent comment, 
I like the comment of my daughter-in-law, 
She said, papa made everyone an April fool, 
I replied yes I fooled even Angel of Death. 


A heart is for sale, 
It's old and stale, 
Sometimes insane, 
Sometimes profane, 
Sometimes it's liked, 
But often is disliked! 
Cracked all-round, 
But is still profound! 
Has a funny caricature 
It's allotropic in nature, 
It's a veiled black coal, 
If you make it your goal, 
Pay your love as its price, 
You'll find it nice, 
It may appear on your cheeks, 
As a mole she seeks, 
Or at your lovely peaks, 
Like a diamond that weeks, 
Your controlled sentiments, 
If you need ornaments! 
It can change its shape, 
No need of a rape, 
It will waive its tail, 
Like a convict in jail, 
You are rich in love, 
It's cheap like a dove, 
With a branch of olive, 
Struggling to survive!.
I have a heart full of sparrows 
hopscotching in my evergreen
they chirp and they twitter and 
boy do they dither- 
they give magic to my every day.

.
I sit beside my picture window
and watch them go shopping
for twigs and leaves and grass
and carry them back all day long
one beak at a time. 
.
Some days though 
bring excitement drama and suspense
when the black-hearted crows 
attack their nests 
hidden in the depths of my evergreen tree.
.
The sparrows explode out of its green depths
and give angry deadly chase
darting and dive-bombing 
swooping and screeching
lethal threats
.
And I come a-running 
broom in hand
to scare those crows away
but my sparrows have sent them packing, 
. . 

those wee little gangbangers on wings.



I shall always remember
that bloody ship and shore. 

bobbing in that tarnished pail

Forever edgy in my mind
restless, pacing always. 

Nostrils flaring, 
battling that putrid affront. 
that bloody thieving affront, 

A smell of death. 
death of an intrinsic trust.




Evidence of your loving heart
Springs awake
Touchstones of delicately
Translucent sunny yellows

Edge your ancient homestead
Dogwoods, peaches, crocus
Carefully heart-line a journey
Back to where your world once stood

Old roses now rabble upon a headstone
Your sweet little girl’s final resting place
A crumbled barn near-by
Where Ol’ Bossy was once stalled

Providing milk for the children
I can almost hear them
A lively bunch-singing out
-Tag your- it! 

Fresh churned butter and home-baked bread
That sweet cream whipped up
Adorning Sunday’s special
Blackberry cobbler treats

And I wonder
What became of you and your dear family? 
How did these old hills come to claim
Your songs sprinkled in sunny love? 



I have to give a clue
As to whom my heart is beating for
To put an end
To all these silly guesses
And pave way to where
My heart's beating never rests

An enigma 
Out of a cloudy rhyme
Swirling waves of ink
Like a confused child
It is where the key lies
Behind these overused phrases
And dusty lines
Meant to be unraveled
Not just by any curious mind

A revelation
Of the dauntless heart
A surge of inspiration
That needs no further introduction
Built within this fortress of words
Where all emotions
I dare not say

But it is only through
A shiny mirror
As one stares lovingly
At his duplicate
Where the code breaks
The riddle of all riddles. 

As to whom my heart is beating for. 


Good bye then, 
I could not never pretend
To need to depend on anyone. 

Goodbye, goodbye, 
Let me climb my own tree, 
I found it too
And you did not lead me to it
Nor can you climb it for me
Or make its highest branches
Any nearer. 

The leaves are falling again
And I pick them up, 
Just the same as anyone
Who can bend a little
To look for them. 

I know- I save to much, 
Upfront in my memory, 
It is like an Attic-storing things
I may never use again
But cannot discard
Always keeping the past alive.


Being myself is something I must do, 
Everyday-not now and then, 
Or routinely five days a week. 
The persistent hope of discovery
Sooner or later provides
A man who will always abide
By that which seems most perfect
And the nature of increase
Which is never satisfied. 


Just single love
When love enters 
The storage capacity increases
It accommodates everyone in it
Love emanates from the soul
And it embraces the whole world
Within us 
A love filled heart is a well
So deep that no one can scale the depth
But beware of a virus called 'Hate'
It is enemy to love and never leaves it alone
So crush it under the burden of love
To crawl, to beg and to respite
Enjoy this worldly life
Fill your heart with LOVE


as i write this poem today
im only thinking of you
the way that you act
and how you say hey

my love is forbidden
yet it knows no bounds
my heart cant be broken
again and again

so im sorry my love
but this will have to wait
until my heart mends
i will have to say no

but never forget
that i love you so.
i'll never forget
your beautiful soul. 


love has chosen a heart
to sing

a tune that it has never
heard

beating fast, it goes into
a spin

as the loved one walks past
oblivious

taking his heart in his hands, 
this young man, eighteen

speaks, 'Hi, I'm Pete, would you care
to go out? 

the loved one, long ginger hair, blue eyes, 
answers, 'Sure, my name is Prue.'

Pete is besides himself, barely remembering 
his question

his heart now pounding, 'What about a coffee now? '


'Sure', she said without a beat, and into the future 
they walked, as love attracts lovelove has chosen a heart
to sing

a tune that it has never
heard

beating fast, it goes into
a spin

as the loved one walks past
oblivious

taking his heart in his hands, 
this young man, eighteen

speaks, 'Hi, I'm Pete, would you care
to go out? 

the loved one, long ginger hair, blue eyes, 
answers, 'Sure, my name is Prue.'

Pete is besides himself, barely remembering 
his question

his heart now pounding, 'What about a coffee now? '

'Sure', she said without a beat, and into the future 
they walked, as love attracts love


I shall speak of Love and things.
I pray my words will give it wings: 
To fly and never know again-
A heart that wants to stay a 'friend'.

Now throw your eyes unto another, 
Never turn them from each other, 
Bravely think of all your life; 
Now have Those eyes, yet, brought you strife

Release me from a world unknown.
And take away the pain, 
That I've never shown.


I can relate my life with yours, 
And understand what you are going through, 
Always waiting for closed doors.

Those doors that will never open for you, 
Are being held shut by yourself.
And no light will ever shine through.

You must surrender to your fear, 
And take the painful road to the light.
To that place you once held so dear.

That road will lead through many tears.
And will take every bit of your strength.
But you mustn't give up keep your head clear.

I once faced myself on that long road, 
And had to watch the pain I've caused.
Now I have to carry that enormous load.


I can't throw it away and leave it behind.
Because it makes you feel human, 
And shows that you are kind.

You will like the sound.
That you have a heart to give, 
It just has to be found. 


Long time ago
A woman tried to trade her own heart: ..
..
My tears, would you please get dry? !                      
 Is there somebody or something                          
To stop Me, stop my Cry?                          
Abyss! !                                                    
Release my body and my soul!                   Despair! !                                                         
My heart, is not your home:                              
Go! Disappear! Disintegrate! !                             
Get Homeless! Hungry!   Die! ! !                    

  
  . ..                     
  Aww..  Heart to become a killer? !             
 No, 
 Never
 Can't! ..                                    
 Not even the despair and loneliness..                 
  I know, they're bad.. 

But they are personal    
They're mine! ..                                         
Hahahahaha.                                                
No! I don't want anything (or nothing,)    die? !             
Do search for better word and choice:                                    
What would it be? !                                              
Transformation? ! Naah.. Evolution? ! Ttsst.  

Change? ! .~hard..                        
Sell.. 

hmm.. 

sounds bad
. 

Trade.. 

yes! ! That's it! Trade it! !                           
I' ll trade my broken lonely crying heart                   
For anything to anyone..                                      
Who wants it?                                                    
A broken lonely crying heart Once!                        
A broken lonely crying heart Twice! !                      
A broken.  

No Offered Price? !                                                                                                      
The cheapest thing! A paper clip, a thread, Nothing! !                                                            
.. Lonely crying heart.                                            
No one? !                                                            
Come on.  

Can't be that hard!   
No problem.. 

I Can be patient..                               
I'll wait.. 

but please:                                             
Stop time or help me  stop my Cry..   


And so, the poor woman 
couldn't  even do a trade..
And you know what? 
She had to heal herself.
She did it smartly 
By sharing little half torn
 smiles..
And broken  little pieces 
of 
her heart..
Bits, were put into baked cakes
shared  in a small neighborhood
Others were put in flower's seeds
who knows where wind did spread them
But most, were put into warm words 
and shared with an entire world..
Her heart  developed..
Now days she found her dolphin smile 
Again.


The West Village by then was changing; before long
the rundown brownstones at its farthest edge
would have slipped into trendier hands. She lived,
impervious to trends, behind a potted hedge of
rubber trees, with three cats, a canary—refuse 
from whose cage kept sifting down and then 
germinating, a yearning seedling choir, around
the saucers on the windowsill—and an inexorable
cohort of roaches she was too nearsighted to deal
with, though she knew they were there, and would
speak of them, ruefully, as of an affliction that
     might once, long ago, have been prevented.

Unclassifiable castoffs, misfits, marginal cases:
when you're one yourself, or close to it, there's
a reassurance in proving you haven't quite gone
under by taking up with somebody odder than you are.
Or trying to. 'They're my friends,' she'd say of
her cats—Mollie, Mitzi and Caroline, their names were,
and she was forever taking one or another in a cab
to the vet—as though she had no others. The roommate
who'd become a nun, the one who was Jewish, the couple
she'd met on a foliage tour, one fall, were all people
she no longer saw. She worked for a law firm, said all
     the judges were alcoholic, had never voted.

But would sometimes have me to dinner—breaded veal,
white wine, strawberry Bavarian—and sometimes, from 
what she didn't know she was saying, I'd snatch a shred
or two of her threadbare history. Baltic cold. Being 
sent home in a troika when her feet went numb. In
summer, carriage rides. A swarm of gypsy children 
driven off with whips. An octogenarian father, bishop
of a dying schismatic sect. A very young mother
who didn't want her. A half-brother she met just once.
Cousins in Wisconsin, one of whom phoned her from a candy 
store, out of the blue, while she was living in Chicago.
     What had brought her there, or when, remained unclear.

As did much else. We'd met in church. I noticed first
a big, soaring soprano with a wobble in it, then 
the thickly wreathed and braided crimp in the mouse-
gold coiffure. Old? Young? She was of no age.
Through rimless lenses she looked out of a child's,
or a doll's, globular blue. Wore Keds the year round,
tended otherwise to overdress. Owned a mandolin. Once
I got her to take it down from the mantel and plink out,
through a warm fuddle of sauterne, a lot of giddy Italian 
airs from a songbook whose pages had started to crumble.
The canary fluffed and quivered, and the cats, amazed,
     came out from under the couch and stared.

What could the offspring of the schismatic age and a 
reluctant child bride expect from life? Not much.
Less and less. A dream she'd had kept coming back,
years after. She'd taken a job in Washington with 
some right-wing lobby, and lived in one of those
bow-windowed mansions that turn into roominghouses,
and her room there had a full-length mirror: oval,
with a molding, is the way I picture it. In her dream
something woke her, she got up to look, and there 
in the glass she'd had was covered over—she gave it
     a wondering emphasis—with gray veils.

The West Village was changing. I was changing. The last
time I asked her to dinner, she didn't show. Hours—
or was it days? —later, she phoned to explain: she hadn't
been able to find my block; a patrolman had steered her home.
I spent my evenings canvassing for Gene Mc


Carthy. Passing,
I'd see her shades drawn, no light behind the rubber trees.
She wasn't out, she didn't own a TV. She was in there,
getting gently blotto. What came next, I wasn't brave
enough to know. Only one day, passing, I saw
new shades, quick-chic matchstick bamboo, going up where 
the waterstained old ones had been, and where the seedlings—
     O gray veils, gray veils—had risen and gone down. 


Make a difference
Each day you live
Open your heart
Learn to give

Life for many
Is so unkind
Giving people
Are hard to find

So open your heart
Give what you can
We’re all responsible
For our fellow man

It’s so easy to look
The other way
But the tables could turn
On any given day

So help if you can
For one day you may be
The one who’s down and out
The one no one will see


We are all together in this every quickening sickening ride
No need to keep it all inside
For it is all in ourselves where we tend to confide
Just let it out and tell a soul
And let them carry on this giving role
There is no need to hog this oxygen
While there are others out their willing to be your friend
Just keep on pushing and never stop your heart from pumping
Face your fears and quit your running
I am here because this is me
But we can help each other out over boundaries others foresee


I say hi to everybody
When I start to depart! 
It is when my sunflower
Kindly Tears me apart
My kindness is helpless
I have a helpless heart



See the dark night has slept, 
Covering herself with the light of thy memories, 
And left me with the darkness of dejection, 
I don't know when the streak of light will pierce this darkness, 
But I'm sure that my light, my vivaciy is no more now, 
This is the moment you waited for, 
Come and make my being a heap of ruin, 
So that you may be relieved from my tiresome love. 


Nothing's certain.  Crossing, on this longest day, 
the low-tide-uncovered isthmus, scrambling up 
the scree-slope of what at high tide
will be again an island,

to where, a decade since well-being staked 
the slender, unpremeditated claim that brings us 
back, year after year, lugging the 
makings of another picnic—

the cucumber sandwiches, the sea-air-sanctified
fig newtons—there's no knowing what the slamming 
seas, the gales of yet another winter
may have done. Still there,

the gust-beleaguered single spruce tree, 
the ant-thronged, root-snelled moss, grass 
and clover tuffet underneath it, 
edges frazzled raw

but, like our own prolonged attachment, holding. 
Whatever moral lesson might commend itself, 
there's no use drawing one, 
there's nothing here

to seize on as exemplifying any so-called virtue 
(holding on despite adversity, perhaps)  or 
any no-more-than-human tendency—
stubborn adherence, say,

to a wholly wrongheaded tenet. Though to 
hold on in any case means taking less and less 
for granted, some few things seem nearly 
certain, as that the longest day

will come again, will seem to hold its breath, 
the months-long exhalation of diminishment 
again begin. Last night you woke me
for a look at Jupiter,

that vast cinder wheeled unblinking
in a bath of galaxies. Watching, we traveled
toward an apprehension all but impossible
to be held onto—

that no point is fixed, that there's no foothold
but roams untethered save by such snells, 
such sailor's knots, such stays
and guy wires as are

mainly of our own devising. From such an 
empyrean, aloof seraphic mentors urge us
to look down on all attachment,
on any bonding, as

in the end untenable. Base as it is, from 
year to year the earth's sore surface
mends and rebinds itself, however
and as best it can, with

thread of cinquefoil, tendril of the magenta
beach pea, trammel of bramble; with easings,
mulchings, fragrances, the gray-green
bayberry's cool poultice—

and what can't finally be mended, the salt air
proceeds to buff and rarefy: the lopped carnage
of the seaward spruce clump weathers
lustrous, to wood-silver.

Little is certain, other than the tide that
circumscribes us that still sets its term
to every picnic—today we stayed too long
again, and got our feet wet—

and all attachment may prove at best, perhaps,
a broken, a much-mended thing. Watching
the longest day take cover under
a monk's-cowl overcast,

with thunder, rain and wind, then waiting,
we dropp everything to listen as a 
hermit thrush distills its fragmentary,
hesitant, in the end

unbroken music. From what source (beyond us, or 
the wells within?)  such links perceived arrive—
diminished sequences so uninsistingly
not even human—there's

hardly a vocabulary left to wonder, uncertain
as we are of so much in this existence, this 
botched, cumbersome, much-mended,
not unsatisfactory thing. 


Three times I had the lust to kill,
To clutch a throat so young and fair,
And squeeze with all my might until
No breath of being lingered there.
Three times I drove the demon out,
Though on my brow was evil sweat. . . .
And yet I know beyond a doubt
He'll get me yet, he'll get me yet.

I know I'm mad, I ought to tell
The doctors, let them care for me,
Confine me in a padded cell
And never, never set me free;
But Oh how cruel that would be!
For I am young - and comely too . . .
Yet dim my demon I can see,
And there is but one thing to do.

Three times I beat the foul fiend back;
The fourth, I know he will prevail,
And so I'll seek the railway track
And lay my head upon the rail,
And sight the dark and distant train,
And hear its thunder louder roll,
Coming to crush my cursed brain . . .


When dusk dissolves the last shreds of light, 
Do heroes lay awake at night? 
Or do they dream, brilliant days to come-
With a winning smile, good deeds all done? 
Perhaps defeat creeps with them to bed, 
As a rusty nail in the back of their head.
Maybe all they wish at night, 
Is for dawn to kill their dreamless fright.
Mayhap they do not wish at all, 
As full moons unwind and fate befalls.
For surely all taste Fate's stale breath-
No might of man may outlast Death.
And are wrung like wet socks into Life's thirsty hands.


When evil intrudes into our day
So many are silent or turn away.
They back away, stare at the ground
Scarcely a hero can be found.
It was on the "L' train yesterday; 
A man was beating on his child
A woman had the nerve to say
"Stop what you're doing 
For it is vile

"
You've heard the tale-
You know the rest
He turned on her
He ripped her dress
He lashed out and knocked her down
Our heroine  lay there on the ground.
A heroine  bloodied but unbowed.
New York would be a better town
If more like her would stand their ground
For evil cannot stand the Sun.
We need more heroes, but here was one. 


You'll always be my my hero
no matter what you do

You don't need any flashy entrance
your sexyness already puts me in a trance

You don't need a costume
only in our bedroom

You'll play the hero and I'll be the villian
haha baby too much helpin'

We'll be like the Incredibles or the couple from Fanastic Four
our super hero babies.. 

so hardcore

You'll never be zero espeacially not to me
I know you'll love being the hero.. 

won't you Freddy



William Shakespeare
died in the seventeenth century
leaving a legacy of sonnets and plays.
Who could deny his sheer genius? 
He will live in our hearts through the days.
His fine words flow; his beliefs they show.
as he wrote about beauty 
and the cold winds that blow. 
with a 'Ho and A Hey Nonino'.


'Who Is Sylvia? ' ~ a most popular poem.
'Midsummer night's dream' ~ a popular play.
I steal his words when I honestly say
Holy fair and wise was he; the heavens 
such talent did lend him. 

He recited the lines of love-scenes of Shakespeare
and she got  elated and called him often for chatting.
He sang  a  heart-moving  melody 
and  she  praised him with all the words she knew.
He blabbed all the details of his family
but she was cagey in divulging her secrets.
She looked at his palm as a palmist did
and amazed at his strong, lengthy fingers.
He would primp himself before meeting her, 
carrying a bag full of biscuits and fruits
which he didn't buy even  for his children.
He wrote sonnets about his longing heart
and she thanked him for her  being the heroine  
of his poems as the dark lady of Shakespeare.
When he stretched his hand to pull her, 
She hopped off and evaded his touch.
' Doesn't my heart have a nice embrace of yours? '
he  asked her with his begging eyes.
' You will poach my heart first and then my body
feigning  you  are in love with me', she said biting her teeth.
' Citing the hills, seas and the sky, I promise you, I love you'.
Before he  finished  saying,  she blared out: 
' I can't give space in this little heart  for all those I meet. 
I have already sold it to someone. Waiting long for him'
With needless grief, and hanging head, 
his body gave company to his heart in its walk-out.
When he narrated this tale to his friend, 
' Don't talk of that beast cheated me last year', 
he said and puffed his cigar.
          -Poetry is the supreme fiction, madame.
Take the moral law and make a nave of it
And from the nave build haunted heaven. Thus,
The conscience is converted into palms,
Like windy citherns hankering for hymns.
We agree in principle. That's clear. But take
The opposing law and make a peristyle,
And from the peristyle project a masque
Beyond the planets. Thus, our bawdiness,
Unpurged by epitaph, indulged at last,
Is equally converted into palms,
Squiggling like saxophones. And palm for palm,
Madame, we are where we began. Allow,
Therefore, that in the planetary scene
Your disaffected flagellants, well-stuffed,
Smacking their muzzy bellies in parade,
Proud of such novelties of the sublime,
Such tink and tank and tunk-a-tunk-tunk,
May, merely may, madame, whip from themselves
A jovial hullabaloo among the spheres.
This will make widows wince. But fictive things
Wink as they will. Wink most when widows wince. 


If you believe in a higher being
And you know he sees it all
You go forward wth a confidence
Whether you rise or fall

If you believe that every lifetime
Is to learn and help you grow
The evolution of each person
The higher being comes to know

If you believe in not hurting
Any living thing
A path towards enlightenment
Is what that journey brings

If you believe we're all equal
And each lifetime's purpose serves
To improve tolerance and empathy
In a run of learning curves

If you believe in reincarnation
Different body, different role
Your trials and tribulations
Bring understanding to your soul

If you believe in a higher being
And you know he sees it all
Unfairness and injustice
Will be karmically restored. 


HAD cigarettes no ashes, 
                 And roses ne'er a thorn, 
             No man would be a funker 
             Of whin, or burn, or bunker. 
             There were no need for mashies, 
                 The turf would ne'er be torn, 
             Had cigarettes no ashes, 
                 And roses ne'er a thorn. 


             Had cigarettes no ashes, 
                 And roses ne'er a thorn, 
             The big trout would not ever 
             Escape into the river. 
             No gut the salmon smashes 
                 Would leave us all forlorn, 
             Had cigarettes no ashes, 
                 And roses ne'er a thorn. 


             But 'tis an unideal 
                 Sad world in which we're born, 
             And things will 'go contrairy' 
             With Martin and with Mary: 
             And every day the real 
                 Comes bleakly in with morn, 
             And cigarettes have ashes, 
                 And every rose a thorn. 


The under-painting reveals a lightly
Misted late afternoon baby blue sky

Perhaps taking up the top seventh of
 This composition, olive meanders

Tinged sunny – green on distant Western 
Cedar’d canopies, evergreen icons

Evidence of a much higher kind of 
Peace, an ancient species cleaving pre-cambric 

Nutrients to nourish precarious 
Life, perched closely together, rooted

 In steep layers of Valley’s mountainous  
Rock, providing shelter and song for

An interesting  natively – born crew
Beddings of softest mosses give respite

Bobcats, possums, catbirds, cardinals and 
Carolina Chickadees all cradled in

Sweetly swaying boughs of tender’d embrace
Colorful fungus adorns decaying 

Hickory trees, heart and sapwood provides
Cellulose rations for termite’s cafe

Felled horizontal curbs mark ancient 
Well traveled hidden paths, a treaded

Multi - generational trek, gateways
To wide open sun - graced feeding hills

Inviting contemplation nurtures all, 
Colorful artists, writers, readers, huge

Black bear, white – tailed fawns, yellow jackets
Occasional blue birds flit near thorny 

Honey locust, tall violet thistle-d sold
-iers give energy to bumble bee’s  sky-

Dances, feathered sedges keeping beat, mellow breezes
Supporting hawk’s purposeful departure

Crows swagger on overhangs shooting the breeze
Cawing bellicosely to whoever might

 Listen, over painting of this precious 
Cacophony features geometric 

Light and sepia -  shaded angulate
-d planes, criss -crossed fine antlered twigs

Now naked, deciduous  and lichen 
Festooned branches tidily sweeping heaven’s

Edge, three distinct stronger trunks dominate
The foreground, a greater ancient, seeming 

Wiser warrior envelopes trinities
 In and as one vine-laced covenant



In Italy, where this sort of thing can occur,
I had a vision once - though you understand
It was nothing at all like Dante's, or the visions of saints,
And perhaps not a vision at all. I was with some friends,
Picking my way through a warm sunlit piazza
In the early morning. A clear fretwork of shadows
From huge umbrellas littered the pavement and made
A sort of lucent shallows in which was moored
A small navy of carts. Books, coins, old maps,
Cheap landscapes and ugly religious prints
Were all on sale. The colors and noise
Like the flying hands were gestures of exultation,
So that even the bargaining
Rose to the ear like a voluble godliness.
And then, where it happened, the noises suddenly stopped,
And it got darker; pushcarts and people dissolved
And even the great Farnese Palace itself
Was gone, for all its marble; in its place
Was a hill, mole-colored and bare. It was very cold,
Close to freezing, with a promise of snow.
The trees were like old ironwork gathered for scrap
Outside a factory wall. There was no wind,
And the only sound for a while was the little click
Of ice as it broke in the mud under my feet.
I saw a piece of ribbon snagged on a hedge,
But no other sign of life. And then I heard
What seemed the crack of a rifle. A hunter, I guessed;
At least I was not alone. But just after that
Came the soft and papery crash
Of a great branch somewhere unseen falling to earth.

And that was all, except for the cold and silence
That promised to last forever, like the hill.


Then prices came through, and fingers, and I was restored
To the sunlight and my friends. But for more than a week
I was scared by the plain bitterness of what I had seen.
All this happened about ten years ago,
And it hasn't troubled me since, but at last, today,
I remembered that hill; it lies just to the left
Of the road north of Poughkeepsie; and as a boy
I stood before it for hours in wintertime. 

To think to know the country and now know
The hillside on the day the sun lets go
Ten million silver lizards out of snow!
As often as I've seen it done before
I can't pretend to tell the way it's done.
It looks as if some magic of the sun
Lifted the rug that bred them on the floor
And the light breaking on them made them run.
But if I though to stop the wet stampede,
And caught one silver lizard by the tail,
And put my foot on one without avail,
And threw myself wet-elbowed and wet-kneed
In front of twenty others' wriggling speed,- 
In the confusion of them all aglitter,
And birds that joined in the excited fun
By doubling and redoubling song and twitter,
I have no doubt I'd end by holding none.

It takes the moon for this. The sun's a wizard
By all I tell; but so's the moon a witch.
From the high west she makes a gentle cast
And suddenly, without a jerk or twitch,
She has her speel on every single lizard.
I fancied when I looked at six o'clock
The swarm still ran and scuttled just as fast.
The moon was waiting for her chill effect.
I looked at nine: the swarm was turned to rock
In every lifelike posture of the swarm,
Transfixed on mountain slopes almost erect.
Across each other and side by side they lay.
The spell that so could hold them as they were
Was wrought through trees without a breath of storm
To make a leaf, if there had been one, stir.
One lizard at the end of every ray.
The thought of my attempting such a stray

Beautiful is the 'thank you'
Wrapped with gratitude, 
Offered to peace prone people
	                        

	                        
	                          .  
	                        

	                        
	                          .  


Wrapped with gratitude, 
Offered to peace prone people
Who offer what is real-themselves
To nurse  with love and humility
napalm asphyxiated victims 
in our stained world

veiling ambition with face of
humanity. 

Beautiful is the moment
when sunlit world fades away 
And with it mind made mirror 
While look inward drawn, sight insight led, 
and heart shuts out desire to let in
consciousness. 

With what magnificence
immensity
holds the falling rock
abreast on the brow of the hill! with what grace
ensconced in spring
immensity
reveals itself in butterflies
re-blossoming winter worn
landscape! with what wonder
immensity
as an ever new joy smiles
on the face of the mirror you are holding
inside your heart
right now

A man is bringing a cup of coffee to his face, 
tilting it to his mouth. It's historical, he thinks. 
He scratches his head: another historical event. 
He really ought to rest, he's making an awful lot of 
history this morning.
  Oh my, now he's buttering toast, another piece of 
history is being made.
  He wonders why it should have fallen on him to be 
so historical. Others probably just don't have it, 
he thinks, it is, after all, a talent.
  He thinks one of his shoelaces needs tying. Oh well, 
another important historical event is about to take 
place. He just can't help it. Perhaps he's taking up 
too large an area of history? But he has to live, hasn't 
he? Toast needs buttering and he can't go around with 
one of his shoelaces needing to be tied, can he?
  Certainly it's true, when the h century gets written 
in full it will be mainly about him. That's the way the 
cookie crumbles--ah, there's a phrase that'll be quoted 
for centuries to come.
  Self-conscious? A little; how can one help it with all 
those yet-to-be-born eyes of the future watching him?
  Uh oh, he feels another historical event coming . . . 
Ah, there it is, a cup of coffee approaching his face at 
the end of his arm. If only they could catch it on film, 
how much it would mean to the future. Oops, spilled it all 
over his lap. One of those historical accidents that will 
influence the next thousand years; unpredictable, and 
really rather uncomfortable . . . But history is never easy, 
he thinks . . .(For Barbara Crosby)
While it is true 
(though only in a factual sense) 
That in the wake of a   
Her-I-can comes a   
Shower 
Surely I am not 
The gravitating force   
that keeps this house   
full of panthers 

Why, LBJ has made it   
quite clear to me   
He doesn't give a 
Good goddamn what I think 
(else why would he continue to masterbate in public?) 

Rhythm and Blues is not 
The downfall of a great civilization 
And I expect you to 
Realize 
That the Temptations   
have no connection with   
The CIA 

We must move on to   
the true issues of   
Our time 
like the mini-skirt   
Rebellion 
And perhaps take a   
Closer look at 
Flour power 

It is for Us 
to lead our people   
out of the 
Wein-Bars 
   into the streets 
into the streets 
(for safety reasons only)   
Want to lose the 
support 
of our Jewish friends 

So let us work 
for our day of Presence   
When Stokely is in 
The Black House 
And all will be right with   
Our World


KING AHASUERUS in his palace at Shu-Shàn
Gave a feast unto his princes, Tarshish, Meres, Memucàn,
And some others whose outlandish names it boots not to rehearse—
You will find them all in "Esther," chapter First, and fourteenth verse.

And when the feast was at its height, and jest and story flew,
And reverberant laughter shook the hangings, white, and green, and blue,
Ahasuerus hammered with his sceptre on the board,
And at the royal signal silence promptly was restored.

"Great lords, our Privy Councillors," the mighty monarch said,
"The chiefest of our provinces is now without a head;
"Assyria is vacant; and we ask you, who is he
"Who worthiest is to rule the roost in that great Satrapy?"

Then one named one; another, one; till all had said their say;
But at each name the monarch shook his head and answered "Nay.
"Ye only think," he cried, "of high degree and princely birth;
"Hen-w&horbar;y-nor is the man for Us, whose claim is simply—worth."

Hen-w&horbar;y-nor! At the name there burst so joyful a hurroo
That the palace-hangings swayed in curves of white and green and blue;
And, waving golden goblets, Tarshish, Meres, Memucàn,
Etcetera, shouted "Live the King! Hen-w&horbar;y-nor is the man!"

Now, Hen-w&horbar;y-nor was a modest chief, who ruled a scanty folk,
And his soul was filled with wonder when the news upon him broke
(Which proves, if proof is wanted, that a man may be alert
And wideawake to everything except his own desert).

The war-worn hero fain had put the glittering prize aside,
But Duty called with trumpet-tone and would not be denied,
And at the old familiar sound his answering spirit leapt,
And his posts were straightway flying with the message "I accept."

And his people—ah, his people!—they were glad and they were sad:
They were proud and yet cast down: the news was good, the news was bad.
Each felt higher by a cubit, and yet lower by a head,
And they bragged of his promotion, mingling tears with what they said.
 
But where all sincerely sorrowed, Persian chroniclers agree
That the saddest of the mourners were the Civil Scribery—
A superior class of men, who, these same chroniclers declare,
Were the best of all good fellows in that land—or anywhere.

Now the Scribery had a custom, quite peculiar to this folk,
To give departing friends an apotheosis of smoke;
So they waited on the Satrap, and besought him to submit
To the process on such evening as His Altitude thought fit.

" 'Tis small honour we can render," said the scribe who spoke their views;
"We are poor, Sir—devilish poor—with ten per centum off our screws;
"But we'd fain give you a pleasure to remember when you're gone"—
And the kindly Satrap bowed his honour'd head, and said "I'm on."

But when the deputation had departed, there came near
A stealthy-footed chamberlain who whispered in his ear,
"There s a Farewell Ode included in the pleasure they prepare!"—
And the hero of a hundred fights dropped back into his chair.

Yea, he whose eye had ever in fierce conflict brightest glowed—
He who before had ne'er known fear—now quailed before the Ode!
And he cried, "Is there no outlet from this horrible abyss?

"Yet stay!"—for now a happy thought took shape within his brain—
"You cannot Farewell-Ode a man who chooses to remain!"
Oh, blessed inspiration! the solution clear he saw!
And out he rushed, and wired Ahasuerus, "I withdraw!"


                          *       *      *       *      *
Exit Farewell Ode. But synchronously with its exit came
A new problem into history that still preserves his fame,
For historians still dispute the question, each with some fresh lie,
Why Hen-w&horbar;y-nor slung Assyria—But we know the reason why. 

Houses bemoan fate, whenever wind blows; 
Softly cantankerous, they assess their pains-
Stiff as arthritis, the way that years show.

A hundred years pass in the blink of an eye, 
To wood beams, comfortably sleeping with rot; 
Floors bedded with termites, rafters open to sky.

Then sooner or later, the occupants die-
A place doesn't last long, when no longer loved; 
Becomes shelter to rodents, and small pupae.

Its memories sealed with cobwebs and time, 
Shingles on its bones, no one left cares-
It's slated for dust: a history left behind. 

The mighty wings of the chosen
The mighty dragons long forgotten
Above all creatures do they tower
There lies within them limitless power
The human race is forvever shamed
To tame that which cannot be tamed
Death to a dragon, is an obstacle to overcome
Their spirit lives on, more powerful they become
Dragons and humans had once been friends
But for human actions there are no amends
Dragons do not easily forget past wrongs
Their pain lives on in ballads and songs
Their sadness, their torture, it makes them cry
They fear their end is drawing nigh
The evil of humans has been too great
Their existance lies in the hands of fate
For dragons no longer take part in war
Away from death do they constantly soar
Because dragons had almost destroyed their own race
Their existance from history did they nearly erase
Territory and power struggles soon led to hate
hundreds would die over a single mate
But they overcame their fate; with wisdom
and forever established their eternal kingdom


Maturity is increasing day by day, 
Distances are decreasing day by day, 
Friction that causes heat of the hate, 
Evolution is greasing day by day. 

Human machine in the future I see, 
Much more rectified caricature I see. 
Understanding better, tolerance extreme, 
A pretty heart catching picture I see. 

The machine is free of sounds and smokes, 
Humanity not a victim of violent strokes, 
Coexistence, brotherhood, the machine produces, 
Live, let others live, the produce provokes. 

UNO more powerful with its decisive roles, 
More food from the sea, vegetation and soles, 
Some fills for the belt of ozone from the earth, 
Something from space for human black holes! 

To wait and see for man's construction, 
He will see, can we feed our growing population, 
He has made us worthy of His Perfection. 

you came out 
and you settled in the confines
and they gave you an identity
and a context,  
an operating platform
and you saw the world
and you wanted to make meaning
and you wondered 
what the hell is going on here - 
and what did you do? 

you took a belief
a Book, a Leader
a system
and you cling to it
for dear life
for eternity, you think

or did they do it to you

I've noticed, again, a small hole in my sock
And there's something I don't understand: 
It puzzles me greatly, I'm baffled, and so
On this subject I now should expand.

I put the sock onto my left foot and see
That peeping out there's my big-toe; 
This makes me unhappy, because I am sure
That left there, the small hole it must grow.

To effect a solution is easy enough, 
So I swap the sock o'er to my right, 
Then the known laws of physics get twisted around, 
I begin to lose trust in my sight.

I cannot believe what I see on my foot
It seems that the hole has reversed; 
It's moved to the left - to my other big-toe! 
I now think my sock has been cursed.

I swap the sock back, and the hole moves again, 
It's creepy - what does it intend? 
It's back to the right, where it was in verse two, 
I now think I've gone round the bend.

And so I surrender, it's all got too much
Sock-holes move, and of that there's no doubt; 
I just wanted to warn you about it, and thought, 
Like the toe, that I'd just point it out.

(Written Aug for Rene Magritte

The carpenter's made a hole
In the parlor floor, and I'm standing
Staring down into it now
At four o'clock in the evening,
As Schliemann stood when his shovel
Knocked on the crowns of Troy.

A clean-cut sawdust sparkles
On the grey, shaggy laths,
And here is a cluster of shavings
>From the time when the floor was laid.
They are silvery-gold, the color
Of Hesperian apple-parings.

Kneeling, I look in under
Where the joists go into hiding.
A pure street, faintly littered
With bits and strokes of light,
Enters the long darkness
Where its parallels will meet.

The radiator-pipe
Rises in middle distance
Like a shuttered kiosk, standing
Where the only news is night.
Here's it's not painted green,
As it is in the visible world.

Some treasure, or tiny garden?
Or that untrodden place,
The house's very soul,
Where time has stored our footbeats
And the long skein of our voices?

Not these, but the buried strangeness
Which nourishes the known:
That spring from which the floor-lamp
Drinks now a wilder bloom,
Inflaming the damask love-seat
And the whole dangerous room.




The Wife
The house is like a garden, 
 The children are the flowers, 
The gardener should come methinks
 And walk among his bowers, 
Oh! lock the door on worry
 And shut your cares away, 
Not time of year, but love and cheer, 
 Will make a holiday.

	The Husband
Impossible! You women do not know
The toil it takes to make a business grow.
I cannot join you until very late, 
So hurry home, nor let the dinner wait.

	The Wife
The feast will be like Hamlet
 Without a Hamlet part: 
The home is but a house, dear, 
 Till you supply the heart.
The Xmas gift I long for
 You need not toil to buy; 
Oh! give me back one thing I lack –
 The love-light in your eye.

	The Husband
Of course I love you, and the children too.
Be sensible, my dear, it is for you
I work so hard to make my business pay.
There, now, run home, enjoy your holiday.

	The Wife (turning) 
He does not mean to wound me, 
 I know his heart is kind.
Alas! that man can love us
 And be so blind, so blind.
A little time for pleasure, 
 A little time for play; 
A word to prove the life of love
 And frighten care away! 
Tho’ poor my lot in some small cot
 That were a holiday.

	The Husband (musing) 
She has not meant to wound me, nor to vex –
Zounds! but ‘tis difficult to please the sex.
Yet there she goes, with discontented mien.
I gave her diamonds only yesterday: 
Some women are like that, do what you may. 

A holiday is not a holiday
Without the children and grandchildren 
Friends are friends 
And mean so much
But a holiday is not a holiday
Without the children and grandchildren.

'No man ever attained supreme knowledge, unless his heart had been
torn up by the roots.'


When I presage the time shall come--yea, now
Perchance is come, when you shall fail from me,
Because the mighty spirit, to whom you vow
Scourges my sloth, and from your side dismissed
Henceforth this sad and most, most lonely soul
Must, marching fatally through pain and mist,
When I presage that none shall hear the voice
From the great Mount that clangs my ordained advance,
That sullen envy bade the churlish choice
Yourself shall say, and turn your altered glance;
Quivers like broken entrails, when the wheel
Rolleth some dog in middle street, or fresh
Fruit when ye tear it bleeding from the peel;
If my soul cries the uncomprehended cry
When the red agony oozed on Olivet!
Yet not for this, a caitiff, falter I,
Beloved whom I must lose, nor thence regret
The doubly-vouched and twin allegiance owed
To you in Heaven, and Heaven in you, Lady.
That I should keep for you my fealty?
For still 'tis thus:-because I am so true,
My Fair, to Heaven, I am so true to you

a holy poet 
is like a holy man: 
all you need 
are words and texts stubbornly tied to some creed
and cleverness and weasel-ability
and one main word in your vocabularya home for a person in heaven
who gives up arguments
even if he is on the truth
who gives up lying
even while joking
who has a high standard
of character in life


Bud, come here to your uncle a spell,
And I'll tell you something you mustn't tell--
For it's a secret and shore-'nuf true,
And maybe I oughtn't to tell it to you--!
But out in the garden, under the shade
Of the apple-trees, where we romped and played
Till the moon was up, and you thought I'd gone
Fast asleep--, That was all put on!
For I was a-watchin' something queer
Goin' on there in the grass, my dear--!
'Way down deep in it, there I see
A little dude-Fairy who winked at me,
And snapped his fingers, and laughed as low
And fine as the whine of a mus-kee-to!
I kept still-- watchin' him closer-- and
I noticed a little guitar in his hand,
Which he leant 'ginst a little dead bee-- and laid
His cigarette down on a clean grass-blade,
And then climbed up on the shell of a snail--
Carefully dusting his swallowtail--
And pulling up, by a waxed web-thread,
This little guitar, you remember. I said!
And there he trinkled and trilled a tune--,
'My Love, so Fair, Tans in the Moon!'
Till presently, out of the clover-top
He seemed to be singing to, came k'pop!
The purtiest, daintiest Fairy face
In all this world, or any place!
Then the little ser'nader waved his hand,
As much as to say, 'We'll excuse you!' and
I heard, as I squinted my eyelids to,
A kiss like the drip of a drop of dew

I read within a poet's book 
A word that starred the page:
"Stone walls do not a prison make, 
Nor iron bars a cage!" 

Yes, that is true; and something more
You'll find, where'er you roam,
That marble floors and gilded walls
Can never make a home. 

But every house where Love abides,
And Friendship is a guest,
Is surely home, and home-sweet-home:
For there the heart can rest. 

Those cold hands sheltered in his lap. 
A simple life chosen to live, perhaps? 
Could no bed be offered though? 
Not even a chair? 
In that desolate, gray street of the city
frozen like ice, but still calmly sitting
a cigarette is lit
 and- smoking, fretting, spitting -
he makes his retreat from human affairs

And so, another lonely story
without any care
shoots a puffy white cloud
of smoke in the air
and I can't help but stare. 
at all of his dreams
briefly lingering there
as he disappears
leaving the cold, winter road seem
so quiet
and bare.

And the sun in the sky is
 In my eyes as it rises
I look at this guy
 As he tries not to cry his 
Heart out. 
Sometimes we drive by
 even though he needs help
The indifference within
 is a sin in itself
Only focused on the ladders
we climb and we climb
And Heaven forbid 
if you're not to work on time

Maybe he's hungry; he very well could be sad
Maybe bad luck's all the luck that he's had
Perhaps he was rich and traded stocks for big cash
'till the whole market crashed 
- fortune gone in a flash
Maybe he thought, 
 'In America, land of Prosperity, 
Surely someone will lead me back to the fun
I'll repay them their kindness - no harm will be done-'

'-But in the Home of the Brave and the greatest of lands
Not one single man will lend me a hand. 
When an insult and pocket change is all that I find
In my sweet home America - I must've lost my mind! '

I see the sun in your eyes, 
 in the sky as it rises
Remember my friend, 
 life is full of surprises
And one day-
You may find yourself standing next to him

Beggin' for bucks; beggin' for change; 
Down on your luck; down in the drain; 
Lookin' aroun' with a frown on your face
Cuz you ran outta gas 
and now your ass is sittin' out of the race
Could you ever let go of the stuff you don't need? 
Or, is it deep in your bones and the blood that you bleed? 
did you read the fine print in your contract on the day
you signed your soul and life away? 

So, 
if you ever see a lonely story
Without any care
cold wind in his hair
Mmaybe his thumb in the air. 
Stare if you dare
but, consider it fair - -
Fairly likely that one day
It could be little 
old you
standing there. 

We are the Smart  Apes
who rose from the African Plains
who learned to eat meat
and grow large brains; 

I see Cro-Magnon man
and Neanderthal man; 
living in the Caves
fashioning spear tips; 

I, Cro-Magnon Man
came from the Middle East
to Europe
to find there Neanderthal, 
short, 
stocky
slow.

I could see
he had no knowledge of serrated
spear tips: 

was no match
for my nimble technologies.
and the warming climes.

I inter-married and /or dispersed him
until today I am all that is left.

I brought new fire to Neanderthal; 
in it simmers his remains.

I see other animals
learning fear
as the Ape spread
from Africa
to Java, to Asia
and Europe; 

There were halting migrations
twice made
driven by climate change; 
 
the whole human race
dwindled down to thousand souls; 
a tiny gene pool; 
the ancestors of our entire progeny.

We are all mutants then
from a  gene pool too small; 
we are all genetic experiments; 
incomplete, 
plagued by paradox; 
killers but builders too; 
peace lovers but war-makers too; 
creators
and destroyers; 
an animal with
a bad genetic start.

I see the development of the opposable thumb; 
tooling making; 
art, technology, the family
war and genocide; 
religiosity
and non-religiosity
all in the mix.

There was tyranny, 
democracy, 
fascism, capitalism
socialism, communism
all from the same brain.

Here comes History, 
generational knowledge; 
books; 
computers.

We Apes touch other worlds.
Send our voices into space
grasp the nature of the universe
invented the concept of Love
threaten the planet with permanent
change, 
pollute our own nest
invent science, 
enslave millions, 
and pave under the trees.

We are Homo Sapiens
self-named 'Wise Men.'

And we live in this Irony. 

Twin stars, aloft in ether clear,
Around each other roll alway,
Within one common atmosphere
Of their own mutual light and day.

And myriad happy eyes are bent
Upon their changeless love alway;
As, strengthened by their one intent,
They pour the flood of life and day.

So we through this world's waning night
May, hand in hand, pursue our way;
Shed round us order, love, and light,
And shine unto the perfect day.


n the hub of foreign tongues, 
a hunger hatched a dreamt day
Induced fairy tale left hung, 
a child is lost in sublime story

East to west, spent and fated
gained-dough at heavy cost
A gleaming snow whose eyes are smeared
In promised loam, a dream is lost


What now is the present? 
when in the past I am in refuge
Both of the worlds reprehend, 
with regrets in deluge

Buoyed-up in flimsy deeds, 
when undercurrent is unseen
A body will soon submerge
against the flow, to go upstreamfrom one worry to the next, I'm worried
at intervals and pauses, 
I find time to worry
one man's worry, 
another man's cause for contemplation

be aware, be alert, be cautious
of course they say they're not worried
women don't take the world as is
forever trying to change and if they can't
it's environment, or male counterpart

got a soul or invented one.
still I'd rather worry than have no hopes
thus from one hope to the next I'm worried"The word is zebra, " was what she said, 
Her narrowed eyes pooling with significance; 
What hidden trigger did she possess? 
The knife she had not shown; not yet.

Red rivers ran behind her eyes, 
In a face so flat and so unsmiling; 
Cold reptiles were hunting sun, 
Somewhere beneath vermilion skies.

A viper lodged behind her tongue, 
She never stopped to choose her battles; 
She thought the war had just begun-
But all her carnage days were done. 

A house breathes through its bones, 
Its summits sit like sentries; 
Though rafters decompose-
It never denies entry.

Its ghosts lie in their beds, 
Soft earth beneath their memory; 
The shutters firmly closed-
The past seen only dimly. 

There is a street in every town that owns a house
called lonely. Then when your just passing by you might
just say, 'if only.
If only could mean a life time of thoughts but it does'nt cure
a lonely house and all its faults.
Boarded up windows and tiles gone from the roof, graffiti
painted by a rebelious youth.
Such a lonely house and an oh such a tired one, 
one that has lost all it's fun.
Stairs and rafters all gone to pot all that is left
is wood worm and dry rot.
No children playing in the garden, it's just a house condemend
by the council without no pardon. Poor lonely house someones
forgotton dream, now describing lifes social scene.
This lonely house stands in the way because their building
a By Pass or a new motorway.
The house called lonely could be any where, in the town, the
country or city square.
Even in your street there's a house called lonely just waiting
for you to say 'if only'An old man standing at the door of the old house he knows
Through the ripped and filthy curtains the wind softly blows
With careful steps he walks through the old and darkened hall
And remembers endless stories of a time he can't recall
 
He slowly opens up a softly squeaking door
and enters the room the same way he did  before
A broken clock still ticking at the time his daughters grown
now only leaves the silence of the memories left unknown
He sees the empty chandeliers where the candles would once burn
and remembers endless stories of a time that won't return
 
The dusty mirror hanging where it has always been 
He remembers all the stories that the mirror must have seen
It knows the secrets  of the room that never saw the light of day
knows the past and all the glories that slowly fade away
 memories of a time that has never once been told
and the once young and beautiful faces now wrinkled and grown old
The old man stands before the mirror on the wall
holding memories of a time he can't recall
 
He walks out the room with a tear rolling down his face
Thinks about the memories of this old and broken place
He opens up the white back door
and hears birds  sing the same old songs they sang before
The man walks outside to the garden to see the sun shining bright
Shining upon the roses, growing red and white
 
His old love there stands underneath the oaken tree
the same place she was standing when he once bend the knee
Thinking about the time together they have spend
He holds her close and whispers: ‘We've made it through the end'A house is not a home
and now neither is ours
the day you left there world 
left our faces with a throne
and though you were ready
we still wish it didn't have to be
cause a house is not a home
when its filled with sadness and misery

Bickering and arguments
left this family in pieces
as rules and laws are bent
and friends go away like diseases
a house is not a home
if a smile no longer comes
and time no longer stops
a house is not a home
if a heart beat feels like a stomp


From my cottage kitchen window I can see
Two fields away the blue, the shining sea
And ships that slowly glide to far-off shores
Each one a separate world with its own laws; 

They pass beyond my window and are gone.
When morning comes that miracle, the sun
Lifts slowly from the sea, a sacrament
Of grace and glory, or enlightenment.

My cottage truly is a house of light: 
By night shines Sirius, cold and bright
And in the afternoon our living room
Seems more like a sunny meadow in mid-June.

From it we see the sun prepare to slumber
Wrapped in the gleaming waters of the Humber
While to the south another lighthouse shines—
Peace be to Spurn and you who read these lines.A House upon the Height—
That Wagon never reached—
No Dead, were ever carried down—
No Peddler's Cart—approached—

Whose Chimney never smoked—
Whose Windows—Night and Morn—
Caught Sunrise first—and Sunset—last—
Then—held an Empty Pane—

Whose fate—Conjecture knew—
No other neighbor—did—
And what it was—we never lisped—
Because He—never told—Oh! Divine Mother of all creations
Blessed am I a tool for procreation
Enjoying life as housewife with high education
Which I use to teach my children
Who shall be responsible citizens
And serve the society with all devotion! 

Bless me serve my neighbor well
Whose wards look upto me to tell
All they need to stand with strength
And sharpen their mind and spirit in length
Grant me wisdom, love and patience
Make my sweet home abode of Providence

One can’t say the house sans nothing
while one is having a chaste and good 
hearted wife in the house; he has everything! 

while there is no wife and there is a wife who defers 
and confronts with wordy duel, that house becomes 
a forest with thick bushes where tiger lives

Biology invigorated by Chemistry and empowered by Geography
infuses us with a plethora of poignant sensations, embraced by
the  velvet of tenderness and clasped in the arms of monogamy.
My heart is made of metal and yours, my virtuous bride, of magnet.
Evocative and provocative energy enmeshes our nostalgia. 
Conjugal ripples from the surface of our skin rush through our veins
into our deepest depths until reciprocal osmosis becomes orgasmic.

The wind is tired of its futile attempts to get between us.
You are the gloves on my hands and the paint on my wall.
Squeezing and teasing, huddling and cuddling, unifying and satisfying- 
tangled together in the tranquil tapestry of inseparability.
I have captured the warmth of the sun and the romance of the moon, 
and gift wrapped  them with my own heart and tears just for  you.
Drip drop, drip drop, until you are enveloped in the ocean of my love. 

A hug each day
Will drive your blues away
To welcome you
or i hate to see you go
It will lessen your pain
and be assured
that every thing's okey
to hug each one with kindness and love
so here's sweetie Meggie
to give you a hug each day


and here's my hug.  

They are my rarest treasure. 

And now.. 

because, every answered prayer
Is a HUG from HIM.. 

A huge frog and I,
staring at each other,
neither of us moves.
 



The only mistake committed by almighty
then realizing the mistake made already
the brain to be used at different level 
from childhood till the admission in school

The young age was enjoyed with much fun fare
not to know much about but still to go somewhere 
where is the time to think about any existence? 
so it is the stage to deny any such presence

I have heard people saying about non belief
Stand with folding hand to express no gratitude
this is how they express ignorance with different attitude

They think it was not a divine act
the birth is merely a naked fact
there is purely scientific reality
it has nothing to do with any morality

The person can shape his own destiny
though he may have to cross the hurdles many
only personal skill may come to the rescue
by dint of ability he may have his share due

unwise are those who see nothing beyond eye
how the wings can be tested if one does not fly? 
how fruits can be enjoyed without earnest try? 
let us understand the fact and do not feel shy

human nature is such to think beyond line
everything does not seem quiet and fine
all secrets and anxieties just remain hidden
we may be called wise but internally laden

There is no end to quest
it can be utilized to its best
let us not forget about the rest
this is the time and crucial test

Only one stroke and finally coming to the sense
it may compel him to believe in presence
who brings sun shine and cool nights? 
has he ever tried to know as matter of right? 

The animals do not think much about fate
they have no brain to speak or state
still they are not ungrateful as we are
think negatively and stay very far

We are blinded by materialistic scene
such progress by human being was never seen
it is merely attributed to human skill
no divine power had anything to fill

It is not received well with any logic
certainly there is reason to believe the magic
it is almighty that has brought us on earth
why no one is capable of stopping the death? 

I shall go by and stand for the standard argument
I have to enjoy every available opportunity and moment
Let us not be equated with or disrespectful to only one

This was not a joke or a comedy, 
It was a real human's tragedy. 
Not a scene coming straight from Hollywood, 
It was the time when the world still stood. 

I felt astonished and sad that I did cry, 
To hold my tears, I did really try. 
When listening the news in my TV set, 
I could not believe it, my TV I reset..

Panic, chaos, screaming and total confusion, 
Stopped the human evolution. 
Bodies, mixed with blood and debris
Manifested in the devastated streets. 

Without wasting time, the helping hands
From all over the globe try to remove the sands
From those who my still be alive, 
And those wandering around
Desperate looking for food not found
Or the precious water soon to arrive. 

They are also part of the human race, 
A wounded child with a dirty face. 
Hungry and tired looking for his mom, 
Happy to find the open arms of Sargent Tom. 
Like drinking a bitter and cold drink
Things in life that twice make you think. 


Your harsh words have left 
An indelible impression, 
Hatred can be won by love alone, 
As one gets relief from 
Scorching heat 
By gentle rain, 
As the sermon of a saint soothes 
The disturbed mind, 
Your words could have healed 
The wounds of my heart, 
For once you touched me, felt me, 
And covered your being with my love, 
As you said, 
You smelt my love and called it red rose, 
What's happened now? 
Thorns have grown on my lips, 
My being has become the grave of your hatred, 
Is it a diversion 
Or you're posing to be more sensible.


'Twas at the Seige of Matagarda, during the Peninsular War,
That a Mrs Reston for courage outshone any man there by far;
She was the wife of a Scottish soldier in Matagarda Port,
And to attend to her husband she there did resort. 

'Twas in the Spring of the year 
That General Sir Thomas Graham occupied Matagarda with men;
These consisted of a detachment from the Scots Brigade,
And on that occasion they weren't in the least afraid. 

And Captain Maclaine of the h did the whole of them command,
And the courage the men displayed was really grand;
Because they held Matagarda for fifty-four days,
Against o'erwhelming numbers of the French - therefore they are worthy of praise. 

The British were fighting on behalf of Spain,
But if they fought on their behalf they didn't fight in vain;
For they beat them manfully by land and sea,
And from the shores of Spain they were forced to flee. 

Because Captain Maclaine set about repairing the old fort,
So as to make it comfortable for his men to resort;
And there he kept his men at work day by day,
Filling sand-bags and stuffing them in the walls without delay. 

There was one woman in the fort during those trying dags,
A Mrs Reston, who is worthy of great praise;
She acted like a ministering angel to the soldiers while there,
By helping them to fill sand-bags, it was her constant care. 

Mrs Reston behaved as fearlessly as any soldier in the garrison,
And amongst the soldiers golden opinions she won,
For her presence was everywhere amongst the men,
And the service invaluable she rendered to them. 

Methinks I see that brave heroine carrying her child,
Whilst the bullets were falling around her, enough to drive her wild;
And bending over it to protect it from danger,
Because to war's alarms it was a stranger. 

And while the shells shrieked around, and their fragments did scatter,
She was serving the men at the guns with wine and water;
And while the shot whistled around, her courage wasn't slack,
Because to the soldiers she carried sand-bags on her back. 

A little drummer boy was told to fetch water from the well,
But he was afraid because the bullets from the enemy around it fell;
And the Doctor cried to the boy, Why are you standing there?
But Mrs Reston said, Doctor, the bairn is feared, I do declare. 

And she said, Give me the pail, laddie, I'll fetch the water,
Not fearing that the shot would her brains scatter;
And without a moment's hesitation she took the pail,
Whilst the shot whirred thick around her, yet her courage didn't fail. 

And to see that heroic woman the scene was most grand,
Because as she drew the water a shot cut the rope in her hand;
But she caught the pail with her hand dexterously,
Oh! the scene was imposing end most beautiful to see. 

The British fought bravely, as they are always willing to do,
Although their numbers were but few;
So they kept up the cannonading with their artillery,
And stood manfully at their guns against the enemy. 

And five times the flagstaff was shot away,
And as often was it replaced without dismay;
And the flag was fastened to an angle of the wall,
And the British resolved to defend it whatever did befall. 

So the French were beaten and were glad to run,
And the British for defeating them golden opinions have won
Ah through brave Captain Maclaine and his heroes bold,
Likewise Mrs Reston, whose name should be written in letters of gold. 

Can you find a humble man, 
One who holds no greedy plan, 
Knowing wealth has no true worth.

Perhaps, if you search around
You may find the one I seek; 
Standing firm on shaky ground
Proud, yet modest, kind, yet meek.

If your search discovers him
Would you for a moment pause, 
To lift his precious diadem
And return to me, because

I cannot find the one I seek, 
Someone with a gentle plan; 
Proud, yet modest, kind, yet meek; 
Can you find a humble man

Just a word of sincere thanks 
To a friend I met on PH 
One to whom I owe a huge debt 
Not of the current toxic variety 
But one that I can never repay 
He has always been a positive critic 
Making me aware of poetic logic 
And the nuances of this fine art 
All of which are truly important 
For the uninitiated making a start 
I am now encouraged to explore 
New techniques and to read more 
As I am clearly and reasonably convinced 
That if the right interest is evinced 
Even a mediocre poet can aspire 
To bring into his poetry some fire 
Thank you Michael 
For this poetry lesson 

Came down a humming bird; 
Skimming down and darting up
As an ever revolving top.

It reeled round and round
Before it alighted on a shoe flower; 
That hung from a drooping branch
In the corner of my front yard garden.

It precariously clung on to it
Like a small pendant on a chain
A sight so cool, now so rare
That lighted up my dull spirits! 


Once they, showed themselves up
On almost every sunny day 
Promptly after the monsoon rains
When the plants en masse, in resplendent blooms

Oh! How I love this tiny bird
Not larger than a bumble bee
Dressed in a cloak of green and black
Flitting round on fluttering wings


With terrific feats and nimble jerks
It hovers close to hanging blooms
Balancing itself sans any support
And draws out nectar with needle bill


I fail to capture its lightning move
As it goes whizzing through the lambent air
Quickly disappearing like a mote of soot
Losing itself in the vast expanse of the blue

Being less than an ounce of fat
So light, sleek and well streamlined
It travels faster than the light of speed
In a fleeting dash, moving out of sight

Can any other bird rival it in agility 
Or vie with it in its simple grace? 
How cute, this spirit of ‘unbodied joy'
This winged diminutive denizen of the sky

Hummingbird helicopterily flying about, 
barely staying a moment to get a drink 
for it's journey around nature's
abode. 

Distance stretches
to the horizon, 
over the edge
is the distance down.
I am over
Falling slow as a feather.

My past passes me, 
painfully.
It is a long way, 
the bottom.
In the mortuary of mind
lay my ancestors
arms open and calling.
The dying left in me
will not speed its entirity
towards the inevitable.

       >>  
My ancestors are laughing now.
Applauding joyfully, 
glad that I am released
from the restrictions of being. 

I write poetry not very often but I repeat them so, 
I have very limited numbers to count, 
Just one to twelve for long poems, sixty for short poems 
And again, sixty for Haikus. 

I am not liked by anyone on this site either, 
Since, I have limitations on numbers and 
But did you ever ponder why so? ? ? ? ? ? 

I am designed that way, my friends, now 
Will you ever ask why earth is round? 
Why moon appears only at night 
Why sun is so bright? Why birds fly not swim? 
Nobody knows but they accept the facts as it is. 

But they are unable to cope-up with my repetitions why? ? 
They jump on my back, they blame, they shout and what not. 
They even ignore me and nurture hatred, 
Dear friends, you know better why all this, don’t you? ? 

You are fortunate, 
and added wings to it with fertile mind to grow ideas, 
enriched with vocabulary, refined with grammar and icing on the cake by rich memory bank. Still, you have limitations, don’t you? 

Don’t misunderstand me, I am just an ordinary member here 
Why here, everywhere and believe me nobody likes me, 
I am the sufferer with blames, abuses and mistreatments 
Still, I am part and parcel of your life, inseparable. 

Hey, did you guess me, I am your CLOCK 
With limitations of One to twelve numbers 
Hours are my long poems, Minutes are my short poems 
And Seconds are my Haikus, now read again and enjoy. .. 

A hundred flowers must breathe
In your body's breath, 
And a dozen angels grieve
Because their soul's been cleft.

In bringing you to me; 
And never once thought of the price
Once your wings were freed.

He put the seashore in your breast, 
With ocean's rhythms beating there, 
And in pale rays of moon, he dressed
The highlights of your eyes and hair.

Your face he molded from a shell, 
And your teeth, from dainty pearls.
In your voice he hid the bell, 
And satin in your skin, he purled.

So all the world could see his care
He finished you; a work of art: 
So that no man might ever dare
To break that gently beating heart. 

Turandot, Puccini’s opera, told by stylised illustrations in a book 
riddles posed to every Prince who wished to be her suitor on pain 
of death if he could not get the answers right, beheaded by 
imperial gesture of the shimmering beauty 

Another Prince intrigued by the Princess, the first riddle: Every 
night it soars anew, every day it dies - Hope, he replied; Illusion
said the Princess cold - the second riddle: Dream and the flame 
flares anew - It is my blood that burns within with love for you, 
answered the Prince - the third riddle: What is ice 

that gives you fire - You cast a hundred spells - he sighed, The 
answer is Turandot; he won the challenge, but would not marry 
her against her will, set her one riddle - Say my name, made 
her a gift of it to doom them both if she named him, then she 
declared LOVE to be the stranger’s name 

Chose to marry the strange Prince who by being brave and 
generous won her respect; she despised all others but 
feared him, cried her first tears - Conquer you or be 
conquered – an enchanting Persian tale from A 
Thousand and One Nights


Hunters, where does Hope nest?
Not in the half-oped breast,
Nor the young rose,
Nor April sunrise—those
With a quick wing she brushes,
The wide world through,
Greets with the throat of thrushes,
Fades from as fast as dew.

But, would you spy her sleeping,
Cradled warm,
Look in the breast of weeping,
The tree stript by storm;
But, would you bind her fast,
Yours at last,
Bed-mate and lover,
Gain the last headland bare
That the cold tides cover,
There may you capture her, there,
Where the sea gives to the ground
Only the drift of the drowned.
Yet, if she slips you, once found,
Push to her uttermost lair
In the low house of despair.
There will she watch by your head,
Sing to you till you be dead,
Then, with your child in her breast,
In another heart build a new nest. 

Tell me about your illness
Help me to understand
You are fighting something
That rarely affects a man

He me to see
What the conquences can be
I'll listen very intently
As you explain it all to me

I don't know what to say
Or even what to do
I wouldn't wish this on anyone
But especially not on you

It breaks my heart to see you
With your mind so occupied
Knowing that you're not far away
From a moment when you'll cry

I'm not sure what I can do
Or even what to say
But know that every single night
My prayers will come your way




H‘tis too soon to call, 
But I couldn’t fight my falls
To sent you roses and kisses, 
To fill your desires & wishes

Your love makes me whole
unfold mysteries thus fold
Your love is true & faithful
‘tis pleasant & yet bountiful

Your beauty never sleeps
It sit on the mountain steep.
Bliss in the heavens be won, 
My heart is pumping for you.

My ambition’s ever endless
Passion storm doth priceless
Dance me to the end of love, 
Into a fresh beautiful moves.
 
I’ll never write a sad songs, 
Or strike heart with thongs
I’ll Never let a single tear  falls, 
I Handle with care, when call.

In the hour of grief and pains, 
In the gloomiest hour of rains
My heart lives it solemn vows, 
Endless love my heart will sow. 

Once upon a time 
when we were young
you caught my eye 
like a ball to a glove.
I didn't know how we'd turn out 
but, I knew I had your love.

When we're together I think of how much I love you.
I love you more than life.
A world we created together
my beautiful wife.

So, when you ask me 
how much I love you
.
I've always loved you.
So now you know.

Here's your poem.
Now leave me alone.he gray cloudless sky is strangely silent
As my skeletal arms reach toward heaven
Within my frame of time thoughts are absent
Suddenly, from nowhere there is an ascension 

Hundreds of black birds flying synchronized.  
So thick that there is barely an inch between
In unison- their aerobatics seem improvised; 
Unanimously landing on my crown to convene

Conflicting chatter creates an odd serenade 
Each bird is contriving a plan with authority 
Apparently a decision to agree has been made
Taking aim at a bountiful place is their priority 

A hush remains as flapping wings take flight
Visual traces are now distant from this old oak 
Binding roots tie tomorrows to a weary plight
As the silver moon bestows its glowing cloak


A hut leaned against a house
counting its days
winter after winter.
One winter
snow shattered its roof; 
another winter
rain felled it.
Someone bought the house
and
raised a bungalow instead.

One upon a time
a hut was there; 
now
it is sod. 

Oh, thou great Power ! in whom I move,
For whom I live, to whom I die,
Behold me through thy beams of love,
Whilst on this couch of tears I lie
And cleanse my sordid soul within,

No hallowed oyls, no grains I need,
No rags of saints, no purging fire ;
One rosie drop from David's seed
Was worlds of seas to quench thine ire
O precious ran some ! which once paid,
That Conmminatum est was said ;

And said by Him that said no more,
But seal'd it with his sacred breath :
Thou, then, that has dispong'd my score,
And dying wast the death of Death,
Be to me now, on thee I call,
My life, my strength, my joy, my all

Bow down and hear our cry, 
Our earthly rulers falter, 
Our people drift and die; 
The walls of gold entomb us, 
The swords of scorn divide, 
Take not thy thunder from us, 
But take away our pride. 

From all that terror teaches, 
From lies of tongue and pen, 
From all the easy speeches 
That comfort cruel men, 
From sale and profanation 
Of honour and the sword, 
From sleep and from damnation, 

Tie in a living tether 
The prince and priest and thrall, 
Bind all our lives together, 
Smite us and save us all; 
In ire and exultation 
Aflame with faith, and free, 
Lift up a living nation, 
A single sword to thee. 

AFTER READING 'LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT.'

For oh, my steps are weak,
And ever as I go,
Some soothing sentence speak;

That I may turn my face
Through doubt's obscurity
Toward thine abiding-place,
E'en tho' I cannot see.

For lo, the way is dark;
Through mist and cloud I grope,
Save for that fitful spark,
The little flame of hope.

For fear that I may fall;
I know not where to go
Unless I hear thy call.

My fainting soul doth yearn
For thy green hills afar;
So let thy mercy burn--
My greater, guiding star

Almighty Framer of the Skies! 
O let our pure devotion rise, 
Like Incense in thy Sight! 
Wrapt in impenetrable Shade 
The Texture of our Souls were made 
Till thy Command gave light. 
The Sun of Glory gleam'd the Ray, 
Refin'd the Darkness into Day, 
And bid the Vapours fly; 
Impell'd by his eternal Love 
He left his Palaces above 
To cheer our gloomy Sky. 

How shall we celebrate the day, 
The mark of worldly scorn; 
When the Archangel's heavenly Lays, 
Attempted the Redeemer's Praise 
And hail'd Salvation's Morn! 
 

The Pains of Poverty he bore, 
To gaudy Pomp unknown; 
Tho' in a human walk he trod 
In Glory all his own. 

The Torments of this Vale of tears; 
Nor bade his Vengeance rise; 
He saw the Creatures he had made, 
Revile his Power, his Peace invade; 
He saw with Mercy's Eyes. 

How shall we celebrate his Name, 
Who groan'd beneath a Life of shame 
In all Afflictions tried! 
The Soul is raptured to concieve 
A Truth, which Being must believe, 

My Soul exert thy Powers, adore, 
Upon Devotion's plumage sar 
To celebrate the Day; 
Shall animate my grateful Tongue; 
From him I'll catch the Lay

And up and down 'twixt heaven and earth, 
In glorious grief and solemn mirth, 
The shining angels climb. 

And unto everything 
That lives and moves, for heaven, on earth, 
With equal share of grief and mirth, 
The shining angels sing:-- 

'Babes new-born, undefiled, 
In lowly hut, or mansion wide-- 

'O young men, bold and free, 
In peopled town, or desert grim, 
When ye are tempted like to Him, 

'Poor mothers, with your hoard 
Of endless love and countless pain-- 
Remember all her grief, her gain, 

'Mourners, half blind with woe, 
Look up! One standeth in this place, 
And by the pity of His face 
The Man of Sorrows know. 

'Wanderers in far countrie, 
O think of Him, who came, forgot, 
To His own, and they received Him not-- 

'O all ye who have trod 
The wine-press of affliction, lay 
Your hearts before His heart this day-- 
With laws, to us, are blind, 
You can try to damn our future, 
But can never change our mind.

If you take away our protest, 
If you ban our presence there, 
We will swarm you with our millions
So you know- we took the dare.

If you take away our freedom, 
Roots will soon sprout underground; 
And then you'll never conquer
What grows tall, without a sound.

You may take our money
In the dark, steal all our wealth; 
But the lamppost on the corner
You will pay, for all your stealth.

Every act has its reaction, 
Every wrong will come to light: 
And though you choose the battle-
We'll choose the time, to fight. 

The sea is mighty, but a mightier sways
His restless billows. Thou, whose hands have scooped
His boundless gulfs and built his shore, thy breath,
That moved in the beginning o'er his face,
Moves o'er it evermore. The obedient waves
To its strong motion roll, and rise and fall.
Still from that realm of rain thy cloud goes up,
As at the first, to water the great earth,
And keep her valleys green. A hundred realms
Watch its broad shadow warping on the wind,
And in the dropping shower, with gladness hear
Thy promise of the harvest. I look forth
Over the boundless blue, where joyously
The bright crests of innumerable waves
Glance to the sun at once, as when the hands
Of a great multitude are upward flung
In acclamation. I behold the ships
Gliding from cape to cape, from isle to isle,
Or stemming toward far lands, or hastening home
From the old world. It is thy friendly breeze
That bears them, with the riches of the land,
And treasure of dear lives, till, in the port,
The shouting seaman climbs and furls the sail.

But who shall bide thy tempest, who shall face
The blast that wakes the fury of the sea?
When on the armed fleet, that royally
Bears down the surges, carrying war, to smite
Some city, or invade some thoughtless realm,
Descends the fierce tornado. The vast hulks
Are whirled like chaff upon the waves; the sails
Fly, rent like webs of gossamer; the masts
Are snapped asunder; downward from the decks,
Downward are slung, into the fathomless gulf,
Their cruel engines; and their hosts, arrayed
In trappings of the battle-field, are whelmed
By whirlpools, or dashed dead upon the rocks.
Then stand the nations still with awe, and pause,
A moment, from the bloody work of war.

These restless surges eat away the shores
Of earth's old continents; the fertile plain
Welters in shallows, headlands crumble down,
And the tide drifts the sea-sand in the streets
Of the drowned city. Thou, meanwhile, afar
In the green chambers of the middle sea,
Where broadest spread the waters and the line
Sinks deepest, while no eye beholds thy work,
Creator! thou dost teach the coral worm
To lay his mighty reefs. From age to age,
He builds beneath the waters, till, at last,
His bulwarks overtop the brine, and check
The long wave rolling from the southern pole
To break upon Japan. Thou bid'st the fires,
That smoulder under ocean, heave on high
The new-made mountains, and uplift their peaks,
A place of refuge for the storm-driven bird.
The birds and wafting billows plant the rifts
With herb and tree; sweet fountains gush; sweet airs
Ripple the living lakes that, fringed with flowers,
Are gathered in the hollows. Thou dost look
On thy creation and pronounce it good.
Its valleys, glorious with their summer green,
Praise thee in silent beauty, and its woods,
Swept by the murmuring winds of ocean, join
The murmuring shores in a perpetual hymn. 

Bacchus, let me drink no more!
Wild are seas that want a shore!
When our drinking has no stint,
There is no one pleasure in't.
I have drank up for to please
Thee, that great cup, Hercules.
Urge no more; and there shall be
Daffadils giv'n up to thee. 

In what torn ship soever I embark,
That ship shall be my emblem of thy Ark;
What sea soever swallow me, that flood
Shall be to me an emblem of thy blood;
Though thou with clouds of anger do disguise
Thy face, yet through that mask I know those eyes,
Which, though they turn away sometimes,
They never will despise.

I sacrifice this Island unto thee,
And all whom I loved there, and who loved me;
When I have put our seas 'twixt them and me,
Put thou thy sea betwixt my sins and thee.
As the tree's sap doth seek the root below
In winter, in my winter now I go,
Where none but thee, th' Eternal root
Of true Love, I may know.

Nor thou nor thy religion dost control
The amorousness of an harmonious Soul,
But thou wouldst have that love thyself: as thou
Thou lov'st not, till from loving more, Thou free
My soul: who ever gives, takes liberty:
O, if thou car'st not whom I love
Alas, thou lov'st not me.

Seal then this bill of my Divorce to All,
On whom those fainter beams of love did fall;
Marry those loves, which in youth scattered be
On Fame, Wit, Hopes (false mistresses) to thee.
Churches are best for Prayer, that have least light:
And to 'scape stormy days, I choose
An Everlasting night. 

Old leaves have no defence against the wind.
A gray hawk is October's inner cry.
The bells of Salem church play elegies.
Distance becomes a single snowflake's fall.

The mood is blue as autumn's last frost flowers, 
Small bits of heaven hidden in the grass.
Tom Roach who called them by their favored name, 
Went home across the green fields long ago.

Yet sometimes when the light moves slowly west, 
And bells summon a faithful few for prayers, 
I see his shadow picking a bouquet.
To live in memory is to be alive.

For my grandfather who started to work in the coal mines of West Virginia when he was twelve years old. 

Wilt thou forgive that sin where I begun,
         Which was my sin, though it were done before?
     Wilt thou forgive that sin, through which I run,
         And do run still, though still I do deplore?
             When thou hast done, thou hast not done,
                 For I have more.

     Wilt thou forgive that sin which I have won
         Others to sin, and made my sin their door?
     Wilt thou forgive that sin which I did shun
       A year or two, but wallow'd in, a score?
           When thou hast done, thou hast not done,
               For I have more.

   I have a sin of fear, that when I have spun
       My last thread, I shall perish on the shore;
   But swear by thyself, that at my death thy Son
       Shall shine as he shines now, and heretofore;
           And, having done that, thou hast done;
               I fear no more. 

I will confess
With cheerfulness,
Love is a thing so likes me,
That, let her lay
On me all day,
I'll kiss the hand that strikes me.

I will not, I,
Now blubb'ring cry,
It, ah!  too late repents me
That I did fall
To love at all--
Since love so much contents me.

No, no, I'll be
In fetters free;
While others they sit wringing
Their hands for pain,
I'll entertain
The wounds of love with singing.

With flowers and wine,
And cakes divine,
To strike me I will tempt thee;
Which done, no more
I'll come before
Thee and thine altars empty. 

OH thou great Power, in whom I move, 
For whom I live, to whom I die, 
Behold me through thy beams of love, 
Whilest on this Couch of tears I lye; 
And Cleanse my sordid soul within, 
By thy Chirsts Bloud, the bath of sin. 

No hallowed oyls, no grains I need, 
No rags of Saints, no purging fire, 
One rosie drop from David's Seed 
Was worlds of seas, to quench thine Ire. 
O pretious Ransome! which once paid, 
That Consummatum est was said. 

And said by him, that said no more, 
But seal'd it with his sacred breath. 
Thou then, that hast dispung'd my score, 
And dying, wast the death of death; 
Be to me now, on thee I call, 
My Life, my Strength, my Joy, my All. 

When I love, as some have told
Love I shall, when I am old,
O ye Graces!  make me fit
For the welcoming of it!
Clean my rooms, as temples be,
To entertain that deity;
Give me words wherewith to woo,
Suppling and successful too;
Winning postures; and withal,
Manners each way musical;
Sweetness to allay my sour
And unsmooth behaviour:
For I know you have the skill
Vines to prune, though not to kill;
And of any wood ye see,
You can make a Mercury. 

Under the green sods, lie unknown
The mighty warriors of our land.
Strong and steadfast they marched to the field, 
Wielding weapons in their hand.

Their daring and their deeds of grit, 
Secured freedom for our land.
Blessed be the wombs that bore, 
Those dauntless men of fiery brand.

Plucked away from hearth and kin, 
They oft dwelt in lands unknown.
Many a laurel they had won.
Living a dismal life forlorn.

Lay in ambush in dingy trench
Crossed swords with formidable might
Starved to death in enemy camps
Fought with verve for country's right

The resolute brigade knew no rest
Ease and comfort, they had none
To drill and discipline, they were wed
Life's winsome pleasures, they did shun

Bravely  bared their manly breasts 
Before triggered guns and flying bullets
Shed out every dropp of blood 
To save the nation from rival blasts

Long, long may their memories last
Let every tongue their daring praise
Let the Nation bow its head
Let their deeds, our morale raise. 

Sea-born goddess, let me be
By thy son thus graced, and thee,
That whene'er I woo, I find
Virgins coy, but not unkind.
Let me, when I kiss a maid,
Taste her lips, so overlaid
With love's sirop, that I may
In your temple, when I pray,
Kiss the altar, and confess
There's in love no bitterness. 

A is the beginning of all letters.

Om is the beginning of all creations.
It is the creation, it is the preservation
And also it acts as the symbol of destruction.

I rise in the morning
With Your call .
And I perform my duties
As per Your orders.
I am here to see You and
Your wonderful nature.

It is Your wish and Your pleasure, 
You have kept me here for a bright future. 

A Jacaranda tree stands tall,  and sways as if to say, 
Look!  At this magnificence, I’m wearing blue today.
forgive the way I shout aloud,   my lack of modesty,  
but nowhere in this troubled world is finery like me.

Light rays slide between each leaf,  to settle on the tips 
to lightly kiss your face with a hundred million tiny lips.
You only have to lift your eyes to greet the filtered sun
a sight  I  guarantee will  warm the heart of everyone.

Though very tall, my leaf is small, its form is one of fern, 
large panicles of  bluebells swell to  trumpet unconcern.
A Bee collecting nectar from an ample deep white throat, 
takes flight to join its family,  and of its feast to gloat.

Look up to see each fern like leaf, floating up on high, 
like footprints of a centipede that stroll across the sky
See how far my branches reach, admire their greenery, 
so beautiful and strong, I am the Jacaranda tree.

Roan  he weary day runs down and dies,
The weary night wears through:
And never an hour is fair wi' flower,
And never a flower wi' dew.

I would the day were night for me,
I would the night were day:
For then would I stand in my ain fair land,
As now in dreams I may.

O lordly flow the Loire and Seine,
And loud the dark Durance:
But bonnier shine the braes of Tyne
Than a' the fields of France;
And the waves of Till that speak sae still
Gleam goodlier where they glance.

O weel were they that fell fighting
On dark Drumossie's day:
They keep their hame ayont the faem
And we die far away.

O sound they sleep, and saft, and deep,
But night and day wake we;
And ever between the sea banks green
Sounds loud the sundering sea.

And ill we sleep, sae sair we weep
But sweet and fast sleep they:
And the mool that haps them roun' and laps them
Is e'en their country's clay;
But the land we tread that are not dead
Is strange as night by day.

Strange as night in a strange man's sight,
Though fair as dawn it be:
For what is here that a stranger's cheer
Should yet wax blithe to see?

The hills stand steep, the dells lie deep,
The fields are green and gold:
The hill-streams sing, and the hill-sides ring,
As ours at home of old.

But hills and flowers are nane of ours,
And ours are over sea:
And the kind strange land whereon we stand,
It wotsna what were we
Or ever we came, wi' scathe and shame,
To try what end might be.

Scathe and shame, and a waefu' name,
And a weary time and strange,
Have they that seeing a weird for dreeing
Can die, and cannot change.

Shame and scorn may we thole that mourn,
Though sair be they to dree:
But ill may we bide the thoughts we hide,
Mair keen than wind and sea.

Ill may we thole the night's watches,
And ill the weary day:
And the dreams that keep the gates of sleep,
A waefu' gift gie they;
For the songs they sing us, the sights they bring us,
The morn blaws all away.

On Aikenshaw the sun blinks braw,
The burn rins blithe and fain:
There's nought wi' me I wadna gie
To look thereon again.

On Keilder-side the wind blaws wide:
There sounds nae hunting-horn
That rings sae sweet as the winds that beat
Round banks where Tyne is born.

The Wansbeck sings with all her springs
The bents and braes give ear;
But the wood that rings wi' the sang she sings
I may not see nor hear;
For far and far thae blithe burns are,
And strange is a' thing near.

The light there lightens, the day there brightens,
The loud wind there lives free:
Nae light comes nigh me or wind blaws by me
That I wad hear or see.

But O gin I were there again,
Afar ayont the faem,
Cauld and dead in the sweet saft bed
That haps my sires at hame!

We'll see nae mair the sea-banks fair,
And the sweet grey gleaming sky,
And the lordly strand of Northumberland,
And the goodly towers thereby;
And none shall know but the winds that blow
The graves wherein we lie. 

From dawn to dusk
I see a timid sun
And overbearing clouds
Playing upon our dreams
The sun wants to give fire
To our extinguishing hopes
But clouds are full of mischief
They overshadow the sun
And our dreams die of cold.




The glittering roofs are still with frost; each worn  
  Black chimney builds into the quiet sky 
  Its curling pile to crumble silently. 
  Far out to westward on the edge of morn, 
  The slender misty city towers up-borne 
  Glimmer faint rose against the pallid blue; 
  And yonder on those northern hills, the hue 
  Of amethyst, hang fleeces dull as horn. 
  And here behind me come the woodmen's sleighs 
 With shouts and clamorous squeakings; might and main 
 Up the steep slope the horses stamp and strain, 
 Urged on by hoarse-tongued drivers—cheeks ablaze, 
 Iced beards and frozen eyelids—team by team, 
 With frost-fringed flanks, and nostrils jetting steam. 

from a news item reporting an assault on a Japanese tourist 
who had unwittingly insulted a person by using a phrasebook 
Board bearing a grudge against his former employers 

The Japanese are said to be 
Of all the nations in the world 
The most polite and courteous 
So it was strange to hear one say 
"Excuse me please, you b-r, you 
Can kiss my a-e, thank you, good day! " 
It was not what he meant to say, 
He simply wished to ask the way 
And was surprised when he was slapped 
Across the face and chased half-way 
Along the street to his hotel 
Wherein he learnt that others too 
Had found the natives just as wild 
And prone to sudden violent rage. 

Ishuro Nakamura, clerk 
Translator to the Tourist Board 
Was sacked. He bore a grudge and planned 
Revenge, compiled a travellers’ guide 
Containing mistranslations, thus 
"What is the cost of X or Y? " 
Became in Nakamura’s book 
A direct sexual invitation, 
"How pleasant is this sunny weather! " 
In Japanese was rendered as 
"I understand your mother is 
A prostitute", while "Kindly send 
The chef my compliments" became 
"This soup is vomit, take it back! " 

The repercussions were immense, 
No less than fifteen Japanese 
Were summonsed to appear in court 
On charges that they had disturbed 
The peace and three were up for GBH. 
The phrasebook had to be withdrawn 
Some fifty thousand copies trashed. 
Returning tourists flying home, 
Quite traumatized, upset and shocked 
Were offered counselling paid for by 
The Tourist Board. There was no sign 
Of Nakamura, he had fled; 
His phrasebook now immortalized 
Is greatly prized by book collectors. 

High up above the open, welcoming door 
It hangs, a piece of wood with colours dim. 
Once, long ago, it was a waving tree 
And knew the sun and shadow through the leaves 
Of forest trees, in a thick eastern wood. 
The winter snows had bent its branches down, 
The spring had swelled its buds with coming flowers, 
Summer had run like fire through its veins, 
While autumn pelted it with chestnut burrs, 
And strewed the leafy ground with acorn cups. 
Dark midnight storms had roared and crashed among 
Its branches, breaking here and there a limb; 
But every now and then broad sunlit days 
Lovingly lingered, caught among the leaves. 
Yes, it had known all this, and yet to us 
It does not speak of mossy forest ways, 
Of whispering pine trees or the shimmering birch; 
But of quick winds, and the salt, stinging sea! 
An artist once, with patient, careful knife, 
Had fashioned it like to the untamed sea. 
Here waves uprear themselves, their tops blown back 
By the gay, sunny wind, which whips the blue 
And breaks it into gleams and sparks of light. 
Among the flashing waves are two white birds 
Which swoop, and soar, and scream for very joy 
At the wild sport. Now diving quickly in, 
Questing some glistening fish. Now flying up, 
Their dripping feathers shining in the sun, 
While the wet drops like little glints of light, 
Fall pattering backward to the parent sea. 
Gliding along the green and foam-flecked hollows, 
Or skimming some white crest about to break, 
The spirits of the sky deigning to stoop 
And play with ocean in a summer mood. 
Hanging above the high, wide open door, 
It brings to us in quiet, firelit room, 
The freedom of the earth's vast solitudes, 
Where heaping, sunny waves tumble and roll, 
And seabirds scream in wanton happiness. 

I am a Jeanie in a bottle.
A ripe age sent from the times long ago.

Here I am in todays world
waiting for a wish.  a magical endeavor.

Come all of you who try, who love each day and
fill your hearts content.

Live your wishes and mark the times.
All is available if only we go out and seek. 

.  

the life we deserve.

Nor half so brittle as her heart, thou art ; 
What would'st thou say ? shall both our properties by thee be spoke, 
—Nothing more endless, nothing sooner broke? 

Marriage rings are not of this stuff ; 
Oh, why should ought less precious, or less tough 
Figure our loves ? except in thy name thou have bid it say, 
'—I'm cheap, and nought but fashion ; fling me away.' 

Yet stay with me since thou art come, 
Circle this finger's top, which didst her thumb ; 
Be justly proud, and gladly safe, that thou dost dwell with me ; 
She that, O ! broke her faith, would soon break thee. 

On a little hill amid fertile fields lies a small cemetery,
a Jewish cemetery behind a rusty gate, hidden by shrubs,
abandoned and forgotten. Neither the sound of prayer
nor the voice of lamentation is heard there
Only the voices of our children ring out, seeking graves
   and cheering
each time they find one--like mushrooms in the forest, like
   wild strawberries.
Here's another grave! There's the name of my mother's
mothers, and a name from the last century. And here's a name,
and there! And as I was about to brush the moss from the name--
Look! an open hand engraved on the tombstone, the grave
   of a kohen,
his fingers splayed in a spasm of holiness and blessing,
and here's a grave concealed by a thicket of berries
that has to be brushed aside like a shock of hair
from the face of a beautiful beloved woman.




GENIUS of Raphael! if thy wings
Might bear thee to this glen,
With faithful memory left of things
To pencil dear and pen,
Thou would'st forego the neighbouring Rhine,
And all his majesty--
A studious forehead to incline
O'er this poor family.

The Mother--her thou must have seen,
In spirit, ere she came 
To dwell these rifted rocks between,
Or found on earth a name;
An image, too, of that sweet Boy,
Thy inspirations give--
Of playfulness, and love, and joy,
Predestined here to live.

Downcast, or shooting glances far,
How beautiful his eyes,
That blend the nature of the star
With that of summer skies! 
I speak as if of sense beguiled;
Uncounted months are gone,
Yet am I with the Jewish Child,
That exquisite Saint John.

I see the dark-brown curls, the brow,
The smooth transparent skin,
Refined, as with intent to show
The holiness within;
The grace of parting Infancy
By blushes yet untamed; 
Age faithful to the mother's knee,
Nor of her arms ashamed.

Two lovely Sisters, still and sweet
As flowers, stand side by side;
Their soul-subduing looks might cheat
Such beauty hath the Eternal poured
Upon them not forlorn,
Though of a lineage once abhorred,
Nor yet redeemed from scorn. 

Mysterious safeguard, that, in spite
Of poverty and wrong,
Doth here preserve a living light,
From Hebrew fountains sprung;
That gives this ragged group to cast
Around the dell a gleam
Of Palestine, of glory past,
And proud Jerusalem

Oh, it's dreadful to think in a country like this 
With its chances for work - and enjoyment 
That a man like Mc


Guinness was certain to miss 
Whenever he tried for employment. 

He wrote to employers from Bondi to Bourke, 
From Woolloomooloo to Glen Innes, 
But he found - though his wife could get plenty of work - 
There was never a job for Mc


Guinness. 

But perhaps - later on - when the Chow and the Jap 
Begin to drift down from the tropics, 
When a big yellow stain spreading over the map 
Provides some disquieting topics, 

Oh, it's then when they're wanting a man that will stand 
In the trench where his own kith and kin is, 
With a frown on his face and a gun in his hand - 
Then there might be a job for Mc


Guinness

Who were the twain that trod this track
So many times together
Hither and back,
In spells of certain and uncertain weather?

Commonplace in conduct they
Who wandered to and fro here
Day by day:
Two that few dwellers troubled themselves to know here.

The very gravel-path was prim
That daily they would follow:
Borders trim:
Never a wayward sprout, or hump, or hollow.

Trite usages in tamest style
Had tended to their plighting.
'It's just worth while,
Perhaps,' they had said. 'And saves much sad good-nighting.'

And petty seemed the happenings
That ministered to their joyance:
Simple things,
Onerous to satiate souls, increased their buoyance.

Who could those common people be,
Of days the plainest, barest?
They were we;
Yes; happier than the cleverest, smartest, rarest. 

Your activities made me laugh
Like the activities of a joker.
Let me say you a joker
You are a laughingstock 
Just like a joker.

O men, You are always acting
Within the clutches of illusory energy
And doing everything opposite.
O men, You have the capability to
Know the Truth and you have power
Of spiritual realization but of no use.

Truth consciousness and
And it is the perfect benediction for humanity.
Knowing well all these, O men you are acting
Just like a joker and you are an
Instrument of laughter, my dear. 

It is slanting, slicing  across experience 
Like an sundown sunbeam, but less gentle, 
This thing that has happened. Perspective 
Cannot cope. It is a lesson, a book
Dropping in the mind like lead in the lap, 
Making one leap with pain, exclaim with accents
Dire and feelings fiery, birthing something combustible, 
Something questioning, loping after what could give
Answers. And never catching up, of course. Look, 
Knowledge has vanished with a puff. It was a trap
Not a fortresss. But I miss its walls, its paths.
Now I am chasing phantoms across endlessness.
Or is that too to finish soon? Where is my clock, my map

After traveling the universe, 
I decided to travel my own earth, 
Carrying in my luggage
Only my mind and heart. 

In my way to Egypt, 
I stopped in Jerusalem
Kneeling down and kissing
The Holy Land. 

I kept going, landing on top of a pyramid
In minutes I was in Mecca, 
Searching for the prophet Mohamed

I saw the green pasture of Ireland
Trying to find Rachel Ann Butler
And give to her my love
Along with a red rose. 

I went across to the United Kingdom
To meet Sir John Knight
Shake his hand and have a chat
And show to him my true friendship. 

The trip seems endless, 
So, I have no choice
But to keep on going to reach my goal, 
Traveling the whole world. 

After being impressed by the city's lights
Seeing from the top of the Eiffel Tower, 
I flew to the Vatican City
Where I kissed the Holy Father's hand. 

Lost in the crowd  running away from the bulls, 
I found myself tired in Barcelona. 
I decided to get a physical and spiritual rest

In my desperate need to see the world, 
I flew to the Philippines
Having the honor to meet Lady Grace, 
Whom I gave a kiss on her cheek. 

Realizing I was still in New York, 
Since I never really left, 
Now, it is up to you
To tell me what happened, I am confused! 


down this winding road
life is not forever 
just a fleeting abode

We are in the act of dressing
preparation of the soul
always traveling onward 
mysteries unfold

material treasures vanish
like a stranger in the night
These were only put here 
to help make our journey lite

as in the box we travel
Coloring this adventure blue
searching for the answer
our spirits to renew

Each day packing our suitcase
Collecing tresures of this life
when we have accomplished
each one will take his fight. 

It's a journey . . . that I propose . . . I am not the guide . . . nor technical assistant . . . I will be your fellow passenger . . .

Though the rail has been ridden . . . winter clouds cover . . . autumn's exuberant quilt . . . we must provide our own guide-posts . . .

I have heard . . . from previous visitors . . . the road washes out sometimes . . . and passengers are compelled . . . to continue groping . . . or turn back . . . I am not afraid . . .

I am not afraid . . . of rough spots . . . or lonely times . . . I don't fear . . . the success of this endeavor . . . I am Ra . . . in a space . . . not to be discovered . . . but invented . . .

I promise you nothing . . . I accept your promise . . . of the same we are simply riding . . . a wave . . . that may carry . . . or crash . . .

It's a journey . . . and I want . . . to go . . . 

One dropp of rain
A glimpse of sun
One stroke of pain
A touch of fun

A ride- smooth & rough
Sometimes up, a sudden down
A kiss of ease & stubborn tough
Smile of life, fearful frown

A calm tranquil ocean
Emergent surprising tide
Massed but still the one
Revealing words & sensations to hide

Frightful soul, argumentative life
Determinedly losing to compromise
Delicate as petal, deadly like knife
Simultaneously watching sunset & rise

A clear blue sky
A broken rainbow
Dreams- not far or nigh
Yet something to mow

Baffling path of life so many mysteries to solve
And one by one so many emotions to evolve


Oh great warriors 
Of yore
Sages of folk lore, 
Could you tell me
Why do I feel vanquished
In the face of victory? 

Had no aspiration to build 
Great empires, 
Or enlighten 
The ignorant.

Just a small aspiration
To be free
And protest against 
Pressure of
Conformity-

On being released, 
from captivity, 
Stood dazed in front of 
Open cage, 
Like a bird
Who has forgotten the
Instinct to fly

Looked skyward: 
Jonathan Livingston Seagull
Soaring high-


Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach is a fable in novella form
about a seagull learning about life and flight. 

Yes, I know everything is polluted, 
Even beliefs are disputed, 
Humanity is infected, 
And man is dejected, 
Due to germs of hunger, 
But the clouds now thunder, 
And the lightning I see, 
You too, it's not only me, 
A player is playing a tune on his flute, 
He looks handsome, lovely and cute, 
The dust of ignorance is now being washed, 
The powerful lords I see outclassed, 
The earth has started her green revolution, 
The air is fresh and free of pollution, 
The seeds have been sown, 
And waiting to be grown, 
I expect the rains very soon, very soon, 
I see a new sun; I see a new moon, 
The hungry poor men are talking of rights, 
They are walking whole day they are walking whole nights, 
With powerful arms and legs of might, 
They've started their journey with all their might, 
From a hell-fare state to a welfare state, 
And you rotten eggs, don't underrate, 
Very soon you will see the heavy wild rains, 
And the flood of rivers like the bullet trains, 
Will shake the earth sweeping out your throne, 
I see you hanging, no dress no crown, 
Like Mussolini's woman upside down, 
Not another place, the mob in your lands, 
Will take his revenge with a stick of his hands, 
Too much is too much you have crossed the limits, 
Your power is deceptive and bogus are your writs, 
The journey has started and it will continue, 
Stale is now your throne's old glue. 

In my childhood, 
the journey was a perilous one: 
full of hardships, pains and tears.
In my adulthood, 
the journey was a generous one: 
full of wonders, hardships and pains.
In my manhood, 
the journey was a gentle one: 
full of smiles, wonders and hardships.
But in me, of years. 
all was in wonderful passion
that happened from the beauty
of everything new.
Now, I ask why

A journey of a billion seconds
A billion heart beats and more
A billion foot steps and counting
A billion stars far above the sky
A billion drops of rain

A journey of a million pints of love
A million cans of happiness
A million rays of smiles
A million cups of peace
A million sunsets
A million dreams
A million breaths

A journey of a thousand tears
A thousand busts of anger
A thousand miserable days
A thousand sad moments


Life is not secure
With tragedies
And miseries
All around
Yet, difficulties 
Can be sought out
With internal wisdom
And beauty
So pure
So bright.

The missing links
Make the innards co-ordinate
With brain
And all customise
In right direction
To sail through the awkward seas
In coracle of reverie.




n a bleak and frosty night
Vexed and weary two travellers rode
Along the pathways-craggy and ragged
From Nazareth, trudging miles on end

Full pregnant, was she with child
Mary -the Virgin, suffused with Spirit Holy
Conceived before, she had known her spouse.

Abiding in Heaven’s Providence n’ care
They had rode past miles behind
Far too fatigued by the trip
Mary, now badly needed a place to rest.

 Heading towards the blinking lights
Not far from the city’s guarded gate
Joseph sighted a tavern-small
Perched high on a tiny hill

A sense of relief beamed past
They have come at last to the journey’s end
Finally found a place to rest! 
An interim home away from home

Tethering the donkey outside the gate
Joseph helped Mary alight the brute
In eager search, he hurried inside
With Mary, following with faltering steps.

But the couple, to their dismay found
Within the tavern, room, there was none
For many a man had gathered round
To halt there on that freezing night


Sundry folk from surrounding lands
Had reached Bethlehem for the yearly census
Tradesmen selling clothes and cheese
Nomads of varying clans and clime

Petulant camels, braying donkeys
The place was littered with man and beast.
The tavern small, so packed to full
Had no more space to harbour the crowd

Mary and Joseph, though dejected, 
Were encamped within a manger- warm
With tender concern, Joseph joked, 
To ease the strain on Mary’s face

"Gaze upon this palace of gold
Where a son shall soon be born to us"! 
Mary smiled a gentle smile, 
Humoured by her husband’s jest

Under the gaze of tethered hosts
In veiled privacy of the midnight gloom
She gave birth to a radiant child, 
The great Redeemer to all Mankind 

The star studded sky suddenly glowed
With a rare brilliance never beheld
And a celestial voice trailed along
Delivering ‘tidings of joy’ to the globe around

The voices of hope.  
Screaming for lives..
Were not fulfilled
The truth is
We can't handle the truth
Take me to the place. 
Where the weather
Is fine all around
We could live
Till the world
Is no longer exists. 
and remember
The arts of love
Implies to flirtation
Your longing
Is descriptive
Well painted
onto the canvas of psychopath
A journey without destiny. 
Is a long lost destination
Only the determined
Would understand
and noddedif it was a share
which gave you joy
how can you use it
as a ploy. 

Arms around your waist, 
And hairflying in the air, 
That first joyride on mobike
On Delhi roads sealed our fate.

A lot can happen over coffee, 
The best in town you will find, 
As we walked hand in hand
Through a plush hotel lobby.

As we sat, you said say yes now, 
What, we have just met, I protest.
I know for sure, it’s destined
 Please just don’t ask me how.

Love at first sight, 
I laughed out loud, 
Happens in Mills and Boon, 
As we slipped out at night.

I said yes the very next day
Still fills me with disbelief.
Like a hero of romantic movies
You were charming in so many ways.

Now the mobike is gone, 
And we travel side by side, 
In a luxury air conditioned car.
To  town, to work every morn.

In silence we drive, preoccupied
Hands on lap, hair in place,  I see
A couple on a speeding bike, 
And think of that first joyride-Come, let us all sing very high
And all sing very loud
And keep on singing in the street
Until there's quite a crowd;

And keep on singing in the house
And up and down the stairs;
Then underneath the furniture
Let's all play Polar bears;

And crawl about with doormats on,
And growl and howl and squeak,
Then in the garden let us fly
And play at hid and seek;

And "Here we gather Nuts and May,"
"I wrote a Letter" too,
"Here we go round the Mulberry Bush,"
"The Child who lost its shoe";

And every game we ever played.
And then--to stay alive--
Let's end with lots of Birthday Cake
Because to-day you're five. 

splendid eyes;
Paradise-verdure he stately passes * to win to the Father of
Paradise,
Through the conscious and palpitant grasses * of inter-tangled
relucent dyes.

The angels a-play on its fields of Summer * (their wild wings
rustled his guides' cymars)
Looked up from disport at the passing comer, * as they pelted each
other with handfuls of stars;
And the warden-spirits with startled feet rose, * hand on sword, by
their tethered cars.

With plumes night-tinctured englobed and cinctured, * of Saints, his
guided steps held on
To where on the far crystelline pale * of that transtellar Heaven
there shone
The immutable crocean dawn * effusing from the Father's Throne.

Through the reverberant Eden-ways * the bruit of his great advent
driven,
Back from the fulgent justle and press * with mighty echoing so was
given,
As when the surly thunder smites * upon the clanged gates of Heaven.

Over the bickering gonfalons, * far-ranged as for Tartarean wars,
Went a waver of ribbed fire *--as night-seas on phosphoric bars
Like a flame-plumed fan shake slowly out * their ridgy reach of
crumbling stars.

At length to where on His fretted Throne * sat in the heart of His
aged dominions
The great Triune, and Mary nigh, * lit round with spears of their
hauberked minions,
The poet drew, in the thunderous blue * involved dread of those
mounted pinions.

As in a secret and tenebrous cloud * the watcher from the disquiet
earth
At momentary intervals * beholds from its ragged rifts break forth
The flash of a golden perturbation, * the travelling threat of a
witched birth;

Till heavily parts a sinister chasm, * a grisly jaw, whose verges
soon,
Slowly and ominously filled * by the on-coming plenilune,
Supportlessly congest with fire, * and suddenly spit forth the
moon:-

With beauty, not terror, through tangled error * of night-dipt
plumes so burned their charge;
Swayed and parted the globing clusters * so,--disclosed from their
kindling marge,
light lay large.

Hu, hu! a wonder! a wonder! see, * clasping the singer's glories
clings
A dingy creature, even to laughter * cloaked and clad in patchwork
things,
Shrinking close from the unused glows * of the seraphs'
versicoloured wings.

A rhymer, rhyming a futile rhyme, * he had crept for convoy through
Eden-ways
Into the shade of the poet's glory, * darkened under his prevalent
rays,
Fearfully hoping a distant welcome * as a poor kinsman of his lays.

The angels laughed with a lovely scorning: *--'Who has done this
sorry deed in
in?
Never our fingers knew this stuff: * not so fashion the looms of
Eden!'

The singer bowed his brow majestic, * searching that patchwork
through and through,
too:
The hallowed harpers were fain to frown * on the strange thing come
'mid their sacred crew,
Only the singer that was earth * his fellow-earth and his own self
knew.

But the poet rent off robe and wreath, * so as a sloughing serpent
doth,
Laid them at the rhymer's feet, * shed down wreath and raiment both,
Stood in a dim and shamed stole, * like the tattered wing of a musty
moth.

'Thou gav'st the weed and wreath of song, * the weed and wreath are
solely Thine,
And this dishonest vesture * is the only vesture that is mine;
The life I textured, Thou the song *--MY handicraft is not divine!'

He wrested o'er the rhymer's head * that garmenting which wrought
him wrong;
A flickering tissue argentine * down dripped its shivering silvers
long:-
'Better thou wov'st thy woof of life * than thou didst weave thy
woof of song!'

Never a chief in Saintdom was, * but turned him from the Poet then;
Never an eye looked mild on him * 'mid all the angel myriads ten,
Save sinless Mary, and sinful Mary *--the Mary titled Magdalen.

'Turn yon robe,' spake Magdalen, * 'of torn bright song, and see and
feel.'
They turned the raiment, saw and felt * what their turning did
reveal -
All the inner surface piled * with bloodied hairs, like hairs of
steel.

'Take, I pray, yon chaplet up, * thrown down ruddied from his head.'
They took the roseal chaplet up, * and they stood astonished:
Every leaf between their fingers, * as they bruised it, burst and
bled.

'See his torn flesh through those rents; * see the punctures round
his hair,
As if the chaplet-flowers had driven * deep roots in to nourish
there -
for wear?'

'Fetch forth the Paradisal garb!' * spake the Father, sweet and low;
Drew them both by the frightened hand * where Mary's throne made
irised bow -
'Take, Princess Mary, of thy good grace, * two spirits greater than
they know.

'Ten o'clock: the broken moon
Hangs not yet a half hour high,
Yellow as a shield of brass,
In the dewy air of June,
Poised between the vaulted sky
And the ocean's liquid glass.

Earth lies in the shadow still;
Low black bushes, trees, and lawn
Night's ambrosial dews absorb;
Through the foliage creeps a thrill,
Whispering of yon spectral dawn
And the hidden climbing orb.

Higher, higher, gathering light,
Veiling with a golden gauze
All the trembling atmosphere,
See, the rayless disk grows white!
Hark, the glittering billows pause!

Faint, far sounds possess the ear.
Elves on such a night as this
Spin their rings upon the grass;
On the beach the water-fay
Greets her lover with a kiss;
Through the air swift spirits pass,
Laugh, caress, and float away.

Shut thy lids and thou shalt see
Angel faces wreathed with light,
Mystic forms long vanished hence.
Ah, too fine, too rare, they be
For the grosser mortal sight,
And they foil our waking sense.

Yet we feel them floating near,
Know that we are not alone,
Though our open eyes behold
Nothing save the moon's bright sphere,
In the vacant heavens shown,
And the ocean's path of gold. 

He created beautiful animals and birds
for us to love them while we live
A jungle is never be a jungle without them
Their roaring and singing voices are the
rhythm of the jungle
The sun and the rain always blessed them
They live with nature and they get what ever
they wish from her
They are more beautiful when we see them
living with the nature.
The nature brought them and allow the nature
to take them back other than kill them by hunting
animals and birds for us and let us take care
of them from the hunters who kill them. 

Her life had always been one in which a door would close
And another door or two would open. 
Today she awoke and sighed with defeated weakness
Pale and mortally exhausted by her diseased beliefs 
Not even a window of opportunity was to open
For as is with everything in life
She had reached the very end
Beyond which she herself had believed nothing existed
All doors to her tomb had now been sealed___


(I am Supergirl. I throw back my cape 
so that you may view the bathing suit within. 
I rear up around a corner, life-size, 
I materialise from a blank wall. 

Before and after your lunch hour, 
in between projects, out of hours, 
you will always think of arms around you, 
you will welcome my reminiscence. 

In between the mystic’s flashes, 
in the cracks of the hit parade 
you will conceive – in a leap
of the imagination – me. 

Innocent, myself, of all my meaning,  
I make a permanent summons. 
At the buffers, at the fire on the hill, at the cliff top 
you will stare into space – and see me. 

I do not tower over you. 
I am discreet, my warmth always conveying 
the necessity of someone 
you don’t have to quarrel with. 

I am meek and closer to you 
than you are to yourself. 
So like you, yet always a little different. 
So different from you, yet the same. 

Heads bob around us like jellyfish. 
Stay calm. These are the musical curves 
that the universe reads. My static tumbles forth 
with all the definition of a joke. 

It doesn’t matter if you can’t swim. 
It doesn’t matter if you can’t dance. 
Look on the rising and falling of my body 
and submit to the cycles and patterns. 

The sun rises over the lip of the ocean with the confidence 
of the Kreutzer Sonata and Jupiter whirling. 
Old men, tuned to the power chord, will sing 
and apples gladden on the trees. 

I am always there. It is a little kick of light
that engenders the pulse of glory. 
Later I will police your dreams. 
Nothing could be more ordinary. 

Man is a dangerous species
man endangers himself
a killer from the heart he is
unlike animals
man is not his true self
it is not the hunger
it is not his greed
it is 'the fear' in him
which makes him
a killer from the heart


Oh no
Oh god
A killer is loose
That killer is me
Inside my sleep
I'm happy in there
No one around
After im done

  .  

But when I wake up
I feel so vulnerable
Nothing to protect me
My heart is black
Just like her soul
I hate to see it
But i cant bear to look
She hates my glare
She loves my hair


I cant not look.. 

b'cause i cant stopthinking about her

Strewn on the ground
were the nouns; 
the gerunds
and the active verbs, 
along with the Criminal Looks
and Sly Slights.

There was a Wad of Silence
masquerading as 'Quiet Time.'

The Absences were white chalk outlines
and fittingly so-
there was nothing of substance left.

The yellow plastic cord-rope
denoted the murder scene-
'move on'  the cop said
'nothing left here to see.'

You could glimpse the outline
of a person there
face-down in the street; 
cut down from childhood
with Withering Stares
and Stab-Words; 
Rejecting Gerunds
Shredded Feeling Tones, 
Mocking Participles-
Little Murders all of them-
Psychic Evils
marauding Word Killers-
inflicting wounds that bleed-
inside the mind; 
 
blood red emotions
running thick in the street.

Someone calls but they come much too late.

What's really needed is for those who need to know
Psychic Wounds 
burrow deep
and eat out
from the inside.

A word is a dangerous thing
to swing
in a crowded room.

You can put someone's
heart out
in the bitter
cold; 
where warm hearts
freeze-dry; 
shrivel up
and sometimes cynicalize

from Bitter Hate
and then 
Word-Murder
somebody else. 

We mainly grow
Through bearing hardship
We tend to learn
By living pain
We're able to
Enjoy the sunshine
From wading through
The pouring rain

Embracing hard times
Help us learn
To trust that good days
Will return

And every cloud 
Has silver linings
And every minus has a plus
They'll be good times
They'll be bad
It's the same for all of us

We're given what we need to grow
Enough to almost fall apart
But riding through it helps us know
A kind and gentle loving heart


From the slow march and muffled drum,
And crowds distrest,
And book and bell, at length I have come
To my full rest.


A ten years' rule beneath the sun
Is wound up here,
And what I have done, what left undone,
Figures out clear.


Yet in the estimate of such
It grieves me more
That I by some was loved so much
Than that I bore,


From others, judgment of that hue
Which over-hope
Breeds from a theoretic view
Of regal scope.


For kingly opportunities
Right many have sighed;
How best to bear its devilries
Those learn who have tried!


I have eaten the fat and drunk the sweet,
Lived the life out
From the first greeting glad drum-beat
To the last shout.


What pleasure earth affords to kings
I have enjoyed
Through its long vivid pulse-stirrings
Even till it cloyed.


What days of strain, what nights of stress
Can cark a throne,
Even one maintained in peacefulness,
I too have known.


And so, I think, could I step back
To life again,
I should prefer the average track
Of average men,


Since, as with them, what kingship would
It cannot do,
Nor to first thoughts however good
Hold itself true.


Something binds hard the royal hand,
As all that be,
And it is That has shaped, has planned
My acts and me. 

Sweetness is on your lips
like honey flavoured early morning dew.
And your eyes have a depth of blue
that even deepest oceans cannot match
with a twinkling like the stars that flash
across the space between 
in which our sight it seems is seen.
And your hair as in a gentle breeze
It takes each fine strand and wisps it
on the air as if a string that music makes
deep within, a heartfelt ring.
And your smile a glowing 
and in its glowing knowing 
that this is true love that’s surely flowing.
Our eyes melt into one
and lips they coalesce
arms embrace entwined.
Love flows and joins
and what seemed a seeming two
are known as one, no longer me and you.
And all the Angels stop and stare
the stars in their travels pause
the sands of time suspend their race
the universe so vast in space
becomes a very tiny place.
Because love flows and joins
this is Love’s gift to all
to know you are so vast, not small
joined in abundant bliss
that’s truly universal



'May I kiss you? ' John asked timidly, fearing that she would say, 'No! ' 

She looked into his questioning eyes and perceived a glint of fear. 

'Yes, ' she answered softly. 

As he approached she presented her lips, spread full as a target of attraction, deliberately relaxed. Her eyes twinkled welcome, her lips shone smooth like reflecting water, half smiling in contented anticipation. Inches away her glowing face loomed like a planet, then those cherry red lips sprang to make capture.

Together they pressed: soft springy cushions of fire caressed his lips in a passionate embrace. 

forward. Well-water,
hand-hauled, mineral, cool, could be
a kiss, or pastures
fiery green after rain, before
the grazers. The kiss -- like a shoal of fish whipped
one way, another way, like the fever dreams
of a million monkeys -- the kiss
carry me -- closer than your carotid artery -- to you. 

A kiss, becomes a pact between two souls, 
penetrating barriers that shy doubt patrols.
for surely not one earthly joy exists, 
to bring such utter comfort like a kiss.

The softest kiss will land upon a child 
Who’s smile turns all but stone soft and mild
Like some fragile petals gloriously strewn
to lightly dust the surface of our moon.

The sweetest kiss, well placed, lingers tenderly
be worth a mothers life if gifted son or daughterly
It is sensitive,  uniquely shaped to seal 
So each will recognise the love they feel.

Young lips that shyly meet to bruise in passion 
colour’s plum, all senses erstwhile ashen.   
Flesh that swells to lure, to tempt, to promise
Shares mortal fear with every doubting Thomas

Loyal lips will flutter, face to face with death.
The final kiss, departing in another’s last breath.
Searching for tranquillity a place to rest a while 
Until once more they can return, welcome in a babies smile.

There is untold magic in a kiss


Nothing really to dwell upon
The air flowing in wetness
Mercifully kills all
Analysing tantalysing
It is within a kiss
That one can peacefully die


LOVE is a plant with double root, 
And of strange, elastic power: 
Men's minds are divided in naming the fruit, 
But a kiss is only the flower. 

Of all  raw  passions, kiss  alone
Seals  lips  but  opens  hearts
So  short  its distance
Be  it  of   blood  or two  souls, 

To  reverence   awareness, 
Sweetest  though  unspoken
Understood  by  any  tongue
Whose  affection natural  as  sigh

Tastes  like  nothing  on  earth, 
Links  to  states  no  man  thinks, 
Itself  raises as  a  moment
In  time's  memory, 

Love  so  sublime
Whose  sound  silent
Yet its echo  lasts  as  truth-

Exiled on the isle of passion and shackled in the prison of craving. 
Bottled up emotion - screaming and shouting and searching for an escape.
Like a dehydrated deer tracking water -Like a desert hunting an oasis.
Deluge of flames enrapture my being with the fervor of a thousand fire.  
Tranquillized by cloud of restraint yet burning with the inferno of love.
Raining from the sky of my being- cascading from my connubial essence. 
Sunshine from the hub of my heart, moistens my lips in the dew of desire.
Pregnant with the passion of the sun and birthing the beauty of a rose.
Visuality captures my appetite like  predator pouncing on  prey.
Tenderly touching - meticulously massage like a cool breeze in summer.
Flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone, lips of my lips, tongue of my tongue. 
Giving and receiving, urging and merging, tightening and heightening. 
Sugar cane and honey splashed together-overflowing into a river of release.
Floating on ecstasy, as time stands still to salute the creation of art. 

Lips, 
Magnets, 
Locked in to, 
A melting alloy; 
Nuances of pink; 
Dewy and swollen 
Soggy pouts; 
In the brink, 
Of thawing in to, 
The perfection of bliss. 

A kiss and a wave goodbye: 
Is that what's left, at the end; 
Goodbye to lovers, goodbye to friends, 
The mothers and fathers, when you've reached the end-
Just goodbye? 

A kiss and a wave goodbye, 
And take along a piece of my heart, to say
Goodbye, as you're going to that final place
Of endless sleep, where are found no more days-
Just say, goodbye? 

A kiss and a wave goodbye, 
And a hope that someday we'll meet again; 
Surely this can't be the end of our song, 
And just when I’d thought, to sing it for ever so long-
And now just say, goodbye

Lost kisses lost kisses
With the wind may fly
After finding him sleeping
On his shoulder you lie
Roll up on him tightly
But with greatest care
Gently delicate kindly
Shhh! Don't wake him 
shh.. 

don't let him be aware
Then, all kisses! Once: 
kiss deep: 
the soul, not the skin! 
-Vacuum any sad cry! 
Spick and span cleaned
The heart of a child
Once again let rise! 
Then slowly and kind
Sweet heart of a child
Let's start filling  back
With goodness revived
 And Smiles.. In biig size

The last kiss lay in the road
 dusty and memory-filled
 and I on my endless trek
 paused more out of respect
 and morbid passion-regret
 asked my self
 shall I retrieve it, 
 a curiosity, 
 inspect it
 as lost artifice

or continue to tread my road
 to endless, endings
 even I know
 lead no where? 

 How many last kisses
 I ask
 inhabit my roads
 even I know
 they cannot be endless
 yet
 how many
 puckerings can I present
 to new suitors
 all intent
 with new intents
 and failing finishes? 

A new kiss
 with someone new
 requires I think
 first taking that dusty kiss
 from the past renewed
 and giving it first
 another hopeless chance
 and then infusing it with new
 faith fulled energy
 that says
 we are are all
 renewed in the offering; 
 transformed
 and cleansed
 in the sacrament
 that is the formerly dusty
 transformed kiss; 

and we thereby again place ourselves
 again in that category: 
 The
 Hopelessly
 Romantic Romantic.

So be it. 

Death kisses me, Sucking the oxygen from my lungs, 
A kiss so deadly, It can only be felt once, 
A kiss of death so seductive, You'll never come back, 
You get a taste of what can be, you get a taste of what you lack, 
Death lays you upon a bed of crimson love, 
You feel the moisture, seeping through your clothes, 
You look down as your eyes fill with delight, 
You see your wrists dripping, Growing this bed of lustful fright, 
You let out a gentle moan, for these pleasure you've never known, 
Who knew death would feel so right. 

Lines blur. my vision fades, 
Darkness; faded into this one, eternal, night. 
Let death encase me with its final shroud of shadows. 
So enthralled you take a final breath, 
The lips of death beckon you, You have no choice..
You humbly accept. 

And so I closed my eyes
And for some minutes long
a tear's being caught 
By eyelashes, blocked.

Its sparkle brought you close
Have felt your stare and ah, 
Warm touch of our souls
A kiss on teared eye. 

A soft silken kiss, 
Laid upon dying lips, 
Breathing your Words into my soul, 
As I am breathing out lovely interpretations of love, 
Fingers, crawl upon thy flesh, 
A burning seed of fateful lust, 
A kiss So gentle Only my heart knows its there, 
My fingers forever running through raven hair. 

After 'L'Aquilone' by Giovanni Pascoli (

Air from another life and time and place,
Pale blue heavenly air is supporting
A white wing beating high against the breeze,

And yes, it is a kite! As when one afternoon
All of us there trooped out
Among the briar hedges and stripped thorn,

I take my stand again, halt opposite
Anahorish Hill to scan the blue,
Back in that field to launch our long-tailed comet.

And now it hovers, tugs, veers, dives askew,
Lifts itself, goes with the wind until
It rises to loud cheers from us below.

Rises, and my hand is like a spindle
Unspooling, the kite a thin-stemmed flower
Climbing and carrying, carrying farther, higher

The longing in the breast and planted feet
And gazing face and heart of the kite flier
Until string breaks and—separate, elate—

The kite takes off, itself alone, a windfall. 

His victim lay helplessly
there on the table.
He picked up the blade
with the handle of sable.

With no thought of mercy
He hefted the knife
And cut out the heart
of that innocent life.


It would do for a side dish
A garnish for meat.
An artichoke heart
Is a healthy taste treat. 

They ask me if I've ever thought about the end of
the world, and I say, "Come in, come in, let me

" After a few
bites it's the afterlife they want to talk about.
"Ouch," I say, "did you see that grape leaf
skeletonizer?" Then they're talking about
redemption and the chosen few sitting right by
His side. "Doing what?" I ask. "Just sitting?" I
am surrounded by burned up zombies. "Let's
have some lemon chiffon pie I bought yesterday
at the Dog Bakery

" But they want to talk about
my soul. I'm getting drowsy and see butterflies
everywhere. "Would you gentlemen like to take a
nap, I know I would

" They stand and back away
from me, out the door, walking toward my
neighbors, a black cloud over their heads and
they see nothing without end. 

A long macrame
Plant holder in cream white cord; 
A knotty affair. 




This empyreal, celestial bodies & the core, all a place assigned, 
Mine lies in a wearied sunrise, crackling in a pool of sweat, cupped in my palms, 
Like an obelisk,  defiant heaving dawn from the elements, 
Passing of my day, fathomed in the Sun’s shadow, moving across my length.

No lofty notes sing my praise, with a catch in their heart, 
No great affections fret their inattentions or miss their embrace, 
In penury my sweat reigns; intimidations &wretchedness, all on me are in vain.
Your skyscraping cathedrals were once putty in my hands, thrown into your windowpane

Alpha &Omega of my life, bejeweled with the non-material Tiara of undiluted sweat, 
Where my hands had’nt reached it hastened darkness; 

Sweat Talk; --
I embark on my great journey; I am sweat, talisman of the diligent, 
Trickling beads across his forehead & chin, fat shining, 
Hoodwinked by pimp time, ran into bricks that went to build your house.
Faithfully waiting for him around the corners, during his work pauses, 
I have felt the cellar chills, as sepulchral as a church confession, 
Flowing down his side locks, lingering in my path, patient.//


Each dropp joining the other in tacit conspiracy, 
My journey’s intricate masonry, surpasses the bricks laid in a missionary, 
Then ran in thick oily snakes, as if underwater, back into his hair, 
Bundling away all that your technology couldn’t ensnare.

Scaling jaw-dropping heights for your gasp of fresh air, 
Running into his eyes faster than he could wipe away, 
Only I dare to stand at the edge of this precipice &peep, 
All your wealth wouldn’t allow you to enter this water knee-deep.

Always smelt of the first touch of rain on mud, -a deodorant, 
More fragrant than your cultivated flowers, rewards of honest effort, 
Severing ties with the heat, taking asylum in the mane of his neck, 
Then in his collars I settle, making way for sweet home-coming.//

Down from his arm-pits I ran, slide carrying your dark load, 
 With my armloads deposited prosperity at your threshold
As life forces rose & sank to the dreadful tides of rigour, 
for a mere day’s wages, lost in time against the horizon, a lone figure.//

I  may not outlive the bleached marble or the weather –beaten monuments, 
But shall shine in the unwept stone more bright than it’s teary contents, 
Sometimes curved &made my way back on his knitted eyebrows, 
Have become a cardinal piece on your chaotic chessboard of nonchalance.//

With  the touch of my hand see a nation rise, 
As I percolate into his rolled –up sleeves, 
 where hidden lie with his meagre savings, always armed, 
With full knowledge of one’s purpose ; traveling
a short  journey covered everyday, . between wish& fulfillment.

When the shovel hits mud, between the clank of metal &the glow of mud
all doubts resolved, everything else falls away in the light of one arc, 
in that one moment, I  (sweat)  stand in a stupor, full of awe! 
The void bridged between the spirit & body, a feel of low animal joy
That only a tired body would know at the end of the day-there I lie.

Government has fixed my price, a day’s daily wage, 
That doesn’t count the tired wrinkles beyond my age, 
But I have braved the sun &all its elements, I surely am underpaid.

Than sit on his fat haunches, to live by the sweat of his brow

* For all those who live by the sweat of their brow

You are beautiful and faded 
Like an old opera tune 
Played upon a harpsichord; 
Or like the sun-flooded silks 
Of an eighteenth-century boudoir. 
In your eyes 
Smoulder the fallen roses of out-lived minutes, 
And the perfume of your soul 
Is vague and suffusing, 
With the pungence of sealed spice-jars. 
Your half-tones delight me, 
And I grow mad with gazing 
At your blent colours. 

My vigour is a new-minted penny, 
Which I cast at your feet. 
Gather it up from the dust, 
That its sparkle may amuse you. 

You student, with the collar blue,
Long pines my heart with anxious pain.
Although I do not go to you,
Why from all word do you refrain?

O you, with girdle strings of blue,
My thoughts to you forever roam!
Although I do not go to you,
Yet why to me should you not come?

How reckless you, how light and wild,
There by the tower upon the wall!
One day, from sight of you exiled,
As long as three long months I call.A Lady red—amid the Hill
Her annual secret keeps!
A Lady white, within the Field
In placid Lily sleeps!

The tidy Breezes, with their Brooms—
Sweep vale—and hill—and tree!
Prithee, My pretty Housewives!
Who may expected be?

The Neighbors do not yet suspect!
The Woods exchange a smile!
Orchard, and Buttercup, and Bird—
In such a little while!

And yet, how still the Landscape stands!
How nonchalant the Hedge!
As if the "Resurrection"
Were nothing very strange

O' Dear; My nectar; Rarest fruit; Girl of excellent beauty! 
Joyful Tamil music with seven good notes; - a lady 
Who speaks the language so sweet like sugar cane! 
O' sugar candy! Come cherished in my beautiful mind

Unwillingly Miranda wakes, 
Feels the sun with terror, 
One unwilling step she takes, 
Shuddering to the mirror. 

Miranda in Miranda's sight 
Is old and gray and dirty; 
Twenty-nine she was last night; 
This morning she is thirty. 

Shining like the morning star, 
Like the twilight shining, 
Haunted by a calendar, 
Miranda is a-pining. 

Silly girl, silver girl, 
Draw the mirror toward you; 
Time who makes the years to whirl 
Adorned as he adored you. 

Time is timelessness for you; 
Calendars for the human; 
What's a year, or thirty, to 
Loveliness made woman? 

Oh, Night will not see thirty again, 
Yet soft her wing, Miranda; 
Pick up your glass and tell me, then-- 
How old is Spring, Miranda

I have been here before so I know the way
It is down the corridor third on the right.
The door is wide open, I pause to observe
the harshness of time her face out of sight.
 
Who are you? the elderly woman demands
the words are aggressively spoken,  terse.
Once more I’m a child being reprimanded, 
needing to urinate,  withered by thirst.

I sense her contempt of my scrambled style, 
my comfy laced  shoes, my out of date coat.
The frayed silk scarf that controls greying hair
to knot just above the  pulse in my throat.

Lost your tongue silly girl,  she sternly says
I blush and wonder who else will hear
The ill natured sharpness is certain to seem
like a  shriek of tired brakes to anyone near.

Tears threaten to veil the bud of each eye.
Apprehension and dread form to grip my chest.
The old childhood stammer returns as I try 
to reply,  I have come at the nurses request.

The change is so sudden deflating her tone   
 I am feeling, you know. .. very tired today" 
Her fingers search restlessly sides of her chair, 
she adds sweetly  " someone with cake can stay".

For a while there is silence, awareness our friend 
a moment to once more  recall a sharp tongue
the clash of two souls of different design, of 
colourless dreams,  of escaping while young.

Old age has been cruel to those exquisite eyes 
now flecks of fine ash in a weathered complexion.
She fingers lank hair and gazes elsewhere
as if mourning the absence of pride and affection.

I pull up a chair,  take my place by her side
Who are you, she asks me, again and again.
Why mother I say don’t you recognise me, 
I’m the lady with cake aren’t you glad that I came.


To sail in the moonlight clear, -
And merrily we would float
From the dragons that watch us here! 

Thy gown should be snow-white silk
And strings of oriental pearls,
Like gossamers dipped in milk,
Should twine with thy raven curls! 

Red rubies should deck thy hands,
And diamonds should be thy dower -
But fairies have broke their wands,
And wishing has lost its power

I am unable, yonder beggar cries,
To stand, or move; if he say true, he lies. 

O World! O Life! O Time!
On whose last steps I climb,
Trembling at that where I had stood before;
When will return the glory of your prime?
No more -Oh, never more!

Out of the day and night
A joy has taken flight:
Fresh spring, and summer, and winter hoar
Move my faint heart with grief, but with delight
No more -Oh, never more

The merry merry lark was up and singing,
And the hare was out and feeding on the lea;
And the merry merry bells below were ringing,
When my child's laugh rang through me.

Now the hare is snared and dead beside the snow-yard,
And the lark beside the dreary winter sea;
And the baby in his cradle in the churchyard
Sleeps sound till the bell brings me.


Eversley,  

Horace: Book II, Elegy "Eripitur nobis iam pridem cara puella---"


While she I loved is being torn 
From arms that held her many years, 
Dost thou regard me, friend, with scorn, 
Or seek to check my tears?

Bitter the hatred for a jilt, 
And hot the hates of Eros are; 
My hatred, slay me as thou wilt, 
For thee'd be gentler far.

Can I endure that she recline 
Upon another's arm? Shall they 
No longer call that lady "mine" 
Who "mine" was yesterday?

For Love is fleeting as the hours. 
The town of Thebes is draped with moss, 
And Ilium's well-known topless towers 
Are now a total loss.

Fell Thebes and Troy; and in the grave 
Have fallen lords of high degree. 
What songs I sang! What gifts I gave! 
. . . . She never fell for me. 

My thoughts hold mortal strife;
I do detest my life,
And with lamenting cries
Peace to my soul to bring
Oft call that prince which here doth monarchize:
But he, grim grinning King,
Who caitiffs scorns, and doth the blest surprise,
Late having decked with beauty's rose his tomb,
Disdains to crop a weed, and will not come. 

O well for him who lives at ease
With garnered gold in wide domain,
Nor heeds the splashing of the rain,
The crashing down of forest trees. -
O well for him who ne'er hath known
The travail of the hungry years,
A father grey with grief and tears,
A mother weeping all alone. -
But well for him whose feet hath trod
The weary road of toil and strife,
Yet from the sorrows of his life

I.
WHO hath known the ways of time
Or trodden behind his feet?
There is no such man among men.
For chance overcomes him, or crime
Changes; for all things sweet
In time wax bitter again.
Who shall give sorrow enough,
Or who the abundance of tears?
Mine eyes are heavy with love
And a sword gone thorough mine ears,
A sound like a sword and fire,
For pity, for great desire;
Who shall ensure me thereof,
Lest I die, being full of my fears?

Who hath known the ways and the wrath,
The sleepless spirit, the root
And blossom of evil will,
The divine device of a god?
Who shall behold it or hath?
The twice-tongued prophets are mute,
The many speakers are still;
No foot has travelled or trod,
No hand has meted, his path.
Man’s fate is a blood-red fruit,
And the mighty gods have their fill
And relax not the rein, or the rod.

Ye were mighty in heart from of old,
Ye slew with the spear, and are slain.
Keen after heat is the cold,
Sore after summer is rain,
And melteth man to the bone.
As water he weareth away,
As a flower, as an hour in a day,
Fallen from laughter to moan.
But my spirit is shaken with fear
Lest an evil thing begin,
New-born, a spear for a spear,
And one for another sin.
Or ever our tears began,
It was known from of old and said;
One law for a living man,
And another law for the dead.
For these are fearful and sad,
Vain, and things without breath;
While he lives let a man be glad,
For none hath joy of his death.

II.
Who hath known the pain, the old pain of earth,
Or all the travail of the sea,
The many ways and waves, the birth
Fruitless, the labour nothing worth?
Who hath known, who knoweth, O gods? not we.
There is none shall say he hath seen,
There is none he hath known.
Though he saith, Lo, a lord have I been,
I have reaped and sown;
I have seen the desire of mine eyes,
The beginning of love,
The season of kisses and sighs
And the end thereof.
I have known the ways of the sea,
All the perilous ways,
Strange winds have spoken with me,
And the tongues of strange days.
I have hewn the pine for ships;
Where steeds run arow,
I have seen from their bridled lips
Foam blown as the snow.
With snapping of chariot-poles
And with straining of oars
I have grazed in the race the goals,
In the storm the shores;
As a greave is cleft with an arrow
At the joint of the knee,
I have cleft through the sea-straits narrow
To the heart of the sea.
When air was smitten in sunder
I have watched on high
The ways of the stars and the thunder
In the night of the sky;
Where the dark brings forth light as a flower,
As from lips that dissever;
One abideth the space of an hour,
One endureth for ever.
Lo, what hath he seen or known,
Of the way and the wave
Unbeholden, unsailed-on, unsown,
From the breast to the grave?

Or ever the stars were made, or skies,
Grief was born, and the kinless night,
Mother of gods without form or name.
And light is born out of heaven and dies,
And one day knows not another’s light,
But night is one, and her shape the same.

But dumb the goddesses underground
Wait, and we hear not on earth if their feet
Rise, and the night wax loud with their wings;
Dumb, without word or shadow of sound;
And sift in scales and winnow as wheat
Men’s souls, and sorrow of manifold things.

III.
Nor less of grief than ours
The gods wrought long ago
To bruise men one by one;
But with the incessant hours
Fresh grief and greener woe
Spring, as the sudden sun
Year after year makes flowers;
And these die down and grow,
And the next year lacks none.

As these men sleep, have slept
The old heroes in time fled,
No dream-divided sleep;
And holier eyes have wept
Than ours, when on her dead
With heavenly hair far-swept
Back, heavenly hands outspread
Round what she could not keep,

Could not one day withhold,
One night; and like as these
White ashes of no weight,
Held not his urn the cold
Ashes of Heracles?
For all things born one gate
Opens, no gate of gold;
Opens; and no man sees
Beyond the gods and fate


"  
  Praise Him who sendeth joy and woe.
  O praise Him, all that dies, and lives.
  He opens and He shuts his hand,
  But why, we cannot understand:
  Pours and dries up his mercies' flood,
  And yet is still All-perfect Good.
  We fathom not the mighty plan,
 We women, when afflictions come,
 We only suffer and are dumb.
 And when, the tempest passing by,
 He gleams out, sun-like, through our sky,
 We look up, and through black clouds riven,
 We recognize the smile of Heaven.
 Ours is not wisdom of the wise,
 We have no deep philosophies:
 Childlike we take both kiss and rod,

A lane of Yellow led the eye
Unto a Purple Wood
Whose soft inhabitants to be
Surpasses solitude
If Bird the silence contradict
Or flower presume to show
In that low summer of the West
Impossible to know -'Gee,  you're  looking  good  today'.
I  said  as  I  looked  down.
He  winked  a  bit  and  slightly  smiled, 
But  never  made  a  sound.

'Yes,  you're  looking  good  today  '.
I  said   in  joyful  cheer.
I  would  have  hugged  him  oh  so  tight, 
Could  I  have  held  him  near.

He  was  there,  just  as  he  was, 
Sure  all  there  was of  him.
A  silent  head,  without  a  form.
A  tech,  in  charge of  them.

The  wires  and  plugs  that  kept   alive  
The  head  of  my  best  friend.
So  he  could  live  another  day, 
of  life,  that  may  not   end.

The  table  there  on  which  it  lay, 
A laptop  universe.
Sadly  holding  this  display.
How  could  a  fate  be  worse? 

They'd  made  for  him  a  phony  form, 
Just  as  he  once  had  been.
They  sure  need  a  place  called  Hell, 
To  put  these  _______s  in.

I  pressed  a  tab  on  his  display
And  he  soon  came alive.
What  ere  it  was, it  seemed  as  though, 
He  had  a  good  hard  drive.

I  heard  his voice  as  it  had  been.
Amazing,  what  they do! 
'My  friend, I'm glad  you  came  today.
I  don't  see  much  of  you '.

I  tried  to  smile,  it  must  be  him, 
I  thought  there  after  all.
Science  plays  such  tricks  on  us  
So  often  in  this  hall.

He  talked  to  me,  I  talked  to  him, 
For  just  a  little  while.
I  wonder  at  such  things  as  this, 
Our  lives  of  endless  guile.

I  left  the  lab  of  tortured  souls
And  looked  out  at the  stars.
Perhaps  they  did  such things  as  this  
Once  long  ago, on  Mars.

I  breathed  the  air, such  as  it   was; 
With  all  its  smoke  and grit
And  prayed  I'd  be at  peace  someday
As  just  a  part  of it. 

It is not enough to have our own identity.
Our individuality is just one layer, a small brick
In a multilayered cosmic structure.
We are part of a bigger world, 
And wish to be part of that larger identity.
To be a mother-father, brother-sister, 
Son or  daughter or a friend and relative
Is part of accepting that greater identity.
A social activity related to the service of others
Is rewarded by a sense of elation and stimulation.
In an environment where wider consciousness
Of a larger community is overlooked
Sense of oneness is diminished.
A segregated individual starts to 
Suffer from malice of loneliness 
Holding an insecure place 
In a large body of universal existence. 

What lively lad most pleasured me
Of all that with me lay?
I answer that I gave my soul
And loved in misery,
But had great pleasure with a lad
That I loved bodily.

Flinging from his arms I laughed
To think his passion such
He fancied that I gave a soul
Did but our bodies touch,
And laughed upon his breast to think
Beast gave beast as much.

I gave what other women gave
That stepped out of their clothes.
But when this soul, its body off,
Naked to naked goes,
He it has found shall find therein
What none other knows,

And give his own and take his own
And rule in his own right;
And though it loved in misery
Close and cling so tight,
There's not a bird of day that dare
Extinguish that delight. 

Our Lombard country-girls along the coast
Wear daggers in their garters: for they know
That they might hate another girl to death
Or meet a German lover. Such a knife
I bought her, with a hilt of horn and pearl.
Father, you cannot know of all my thoughts
That day in going to meet her,—that last day
For the last time, she said;—of all the love
And all the hopeless hope that she might change
And go back with me. Ah! and everywhere,
At places we both knew along the road,
Some fresh shape of herself as once she was
Grew present at my side; until it seemed—
So close they gathered round me—they would all
Be with me when I reached the spot at last,
To plead my cause with her against herself
So changed. O Father, if you knew all this
You cannot know, then you would know too, Father,
What can be told I'll tell, if you will hear.
I passed a village-fair upon my road,
And thought, being empty-handed, I would take
Some little present: such might prove, I said,
A parting gift. And there it was I bought
The knife I spoke of, such as women wear.
That day, some three hours afterwards, I found
For certain, it must be a parting gift.
And, standing silent now at last, I looked
Into her scornful face; and heard the sea
Still trying hard to din into my ears
Some speech it knew which still might change her heart,
If only it could make me understand.
One moment thus. Another, and her face
Seemed further off than the last line of sea,
So that I thought, if now she were to speak
I could not hear her. Then again I knew
All, as we stood together on the sand
At Iglio, in the first thin shade o' the hills.
"Take it," I said, and held it out to her,
While the hilt glanced within my trembling hold;
"Take it and keep it for my sake," I said.
Her neck unbent not, neither did her eyes
Move, nor her foot left beating of the sand;
Only she put it by from her and laughed.
Father, you hear my speech and not her laugh;
It was another laugh than the sweet sound
Which rose from her sweet childish heart, that day
Eleven years before, when first I found her
Alone upon the hill-side; and her curls
Shook down in the warm grass as she looked up
Out of her curls in my eyes bent to hers.
She might have served a painter to pourtray
That heavenly child which in the latter days
Shall walk between the lion and the lamb.
I had been for nights in hiding, worn and sick
And hardly fed; and so her words at first
Seemed fiftul like the talking of the trees
And voices in the air that knew my name.
And I remember that I sat me down
Upon the slope with her, and thought the world
Must be all over or had never been,
We seemed there so alone. And soon she told me
Her parents both were gone away from her.
I thought perhaps she meant that they had died;
But when I asked her this, she looked again
Into my face and said that yestereve
They kissed her long, and wept and made her weep,
And gave her all the bread they had with them,
And then had gone together up the hill
Where we were sitting now, and had walked on
Into the great red light; "and so," she said,
"I have come up here too; and when this evening
They step out of the light as they stepped in,
I shall be here to kiss them." And she laughed.
Then I bethought me suddenly of the famine;
And how the church-steps throughout all the town,
When last I had been there a month ago,
Swarmed with starved folk; and how the bread was weighed
By Austrians armed; and women that I knew
For wives and mothers walked the public street,
Saying aloud that if their husbands feared
To snatch the children's food, themselves would stay
Till they had earned it there. So then this child
Was piteous to me; for all told me then
To man's or to the Church's charity,
Because of the great famine, rather than
To watch her growing thin between their knees.
And sights and sounds came back and things long since,
And all my childhood found me on the hills;
And so I took her with me.
I was young.
Scarce man then, Father: but the cause which gave
The wounds I die of now had brought me then
Some wounds already; and I lived alone,
As any hiding hunted man must live.
It was no easy thing to keep a child
In safety; for herself it was not safe,
And doubled my own danger: but I knew
Yet a little while
Pardon me, Father, if I pause. I think
I have been speaking to you of some matters
There was no need to speak of, have I not?
You do not know how clearly those things stood
Within my mind, which I have spoken of,
Nor how they strove for utterance. Life all past
Is like the sky when the sun sets in it,
Clearest where furthest off.
I told you how
She scorned my parting gift and laughed. And yet
A woman's laugh's another thing sometimes:
I think they laugh in Heaven. I know last night
Where women walked whose painted images
I have seen with candles round them in the church.
They bent this way and that, one to another,
Playing: and over the long golden hair
Of each there floated like a ring of fire
Which when she stooped stooped with her, and when she rose
Rose with her. Then a breeze flew in among them,
As if a window had been opened in heaven
This world of ours should set; (for in my dream
I thought our world was setting, and the sun
Flared, a spent taper; ) and beneath that gust
The rings of light quivered like forest-leaves.
Then all the blessed maidens who were there
Stood up together, as it were a voice
That called them; and they threw their tresses back,
And smote their palms, and all laughed up at once,
For the strong heavenly joy they had in them
And looking round, I saw as usual
That she was standing there with her long locks
Pressed to her side; and her laugh ended theirs.
For always when I see her now, she laughs.
And yet her childish laughter haunts me too,
The life of this dead terror; as in days
When she, a child, dwelt with me. I must tell
Something of those days yet before the end.
I brought her from the city—one such day
When she was still a merry loving child,—
The earliest gift I mind my giving her;
A little image of a flying Love
Made of our coloured glass-ware, in his hands
A dart of gilded metal and a torch.
And him she kissed and me, and fain would know
Why were his poor eyes blindfold, why the wings
And why the arrow. What I knew I told
Of Venus and of Cupid,—strange old tales.
And when she heard that he could rule the loves
Of men and women, still she shook her head
And wondered; and, "Nay, nay," she murmured still,
"So strong, and he a younger child than I!"
And then she'd have me fix him on the wall
Fronting her little bed; and then again
She needs must fix him there herself, because
I gave him to her and she loved him so,
And he should make her love me better yet,
If women loved the more, the more they grew.
But the fit place upon the wall was high
For her, and so I held her in my arms:
And each time that the heavy pruning-hook
I gave her for a hammer slipped away
As it would often, still she laughed and laughed
And kissed and kissed me. But amid her mirth,
Just as she hung the image on the nail,
It slipped and all its fragments strewed the ground:
And as it fell she screamed, for in her hand
The dart had entered deeply and drawn blood.
And so her laughter turned to tears: and "Oh!"
I said, the while I bandaged the small hand,—
"That I should be the first to make you bleed,
Who love and love and love you!"—kissing still
The fingers till I got her safe to bed.
And still she sobbed,—"not for the pain at all,"
She said, "but for the Love, the poor good Love
You gave me." So she cried herself to sleep.
Another later thing comes back to me.
'Twas in those hardest foulest days of all,
When still from his shut palace, sitting clean
Above the splash of blood, old Metternich
(May his soul die, and never-dying worms
Feast on its pain for ever! ) used to thin
His year's doomed hundreds daintily, each month
Thirties and fifties. This time, as I think,
Was when his thrift forbad the poor to take
That evil brackish salt which the dry rocks
Keep all through winter when the sea draws in.
The first I heard of it was a chance shot
In the street here and there, and on the stones
A stumbling clatter as of horse hemmed round.
Then, when she saw me hurry out of doors,
My gun slung at my shoulder and my knife
Stuck in my girdle, she smoothed down my hair
And laughed to see me look so brave, and leaped
Up to my neck and kissed me. She was still
A child; and yet that kiss was on my lips
So hot all day where the smoke shut us in.
For now, being always with her, the first love
I had—the father's, brother's love—was changed,
I think, in somewise; like a holy thought
Which is a prayer before one knows of it.
The first time I perceived this, I remember,
Was once when after hunting I came home
Weary, and she brought food and fruit for me,
And sat down at my feet upon the floor
Leaning against my side. But when I felt
Her sweet head reach from that low seat of hers
So high as to be laid upon my heart,
I turned and looked upon my darling there
And marked for the first time how tall she was;
And my heart beat with so much violence
Under her cheek, I thought she could not choose
But wonder at it soon and ask me why;
And so I bade her rise and eat with me.
And when, remembering all and counting back
The time, I made out fourteen years for her
And told her so, she gazed at me with eyes
As of the sky and sea on a grey day,
And drew her long hands through her hair, and asked me
If she was not a woman; and then laughed:
And as she stooped in laughing, I could see
Beneath the growing throat the breasts half-globed
Like folded lilies deepset in the stream.
Yes, let me think of her as then; for so
Her image, Father, is not like the sights
Which come when you are gone. She had a mouth
Made to bring death to life,—the underlip
Sucked in, as if it strove to kiss itself.
Her face was pearly pale, as when one stoops
Over wan water; and the dark crisped hair
And the hair's shadow made it paler still:—
Deep-serried locks, the dimness of the cloud
Where the moon's gaze is set in eddying gloom.
Her body bore her neck as the tree's stem
Bears the top branch; and as the branch sustains
The flower of the year's pride, her high neck bore
That face made wonderful with night and day.
Her voice was swift, yet ever the last words
Fell lingeringly; and rounded finger-tips
She had, that clung a little where they touched
And then were gone o' the instant. Her great eyes,
That sometimes turned half dizzily beneath
The passionate lids, as faint, when she would speak,
Had also in them hidden springs of mirth,
Which under the dark lashes evermore
Shook to her laugh, as when a bird flies low
Between the water and the willow-leaves,
And the shade quivers till he wins the light.
I was a moody comrade to her then,
For all the love I bore her. Italy,
The weeping desolate mother, long has claimed
Her sons' strong arms to lean on, and their hands
To lop the poisonous thicket from her path,
Cleaving her way to light. And from her need
Had grown the fashion of my whole poor life
Which I was proud to yield her, as my father
Had yielded his. And this had come to be
A game to play, a love to clasp, a hate
To wreak, all things together that a man
Needs for his blood to ripen; till at times
All else seemed shadows, and I wondered still
To see such life pass muster and be deemed
Time's bodily substance. In those hours, no doubt,
To the young girl my eyes were like my soul,—
Dark wells of death-in-life that yearned for day.
Sig.
And though she ruled me always, I remember
That once when I was thus and she still kept
Leaping about the place and laughing, I
Did almost chide her; whereupon she knelt
And putting her two hands into my breast
Sang me a song. Are these tears in my eyes?
'Tis long since I have wept for anything.
I thought that song forgotten out of mind;
And now, just as I spoke of it, it came
All back. It is but a rude thing, ill rhymed,
Such as a blind man chaunts and his dog hears
Holding the platter, when the children run
To merrier sport and leave him. Thus it goes:—


She wept, sweet lady,
And said in weeping:
"What spell is keeping
The stars so steady?
Why does the power
Of the sun's noon-hour
To sleep so move me?
And the moon in heaven,
Stained where she passes
As a worn-out glass is,—
Wearily driven,
Why walks she above me?
"Stars, moon, and sun too,
I'm tired of either
And all together!
Whom speak they unto
That I should listen?
For very surely,
Though my arms and shoulders
Dazzle beholders,
And my eyes glisten,
All's nothing purely!
What are words said for
At all about them,
If he they are made for
Can do without them?"
She laughed, sweet lady,
And said in laughing:
"His hand clings half in
My own already!
Oh! do you love me?
Oh! speak of passion
In no new fashion,
No loud inveighings,
But the old sayings
You once said of me.
"You said: ‘As summer,
Through boughs grown brittle,
Comes back a little
Ere frosts benumb her,—
So bring'st thou to me
All leaves and flowers,
Though autumn's gloomy
To-day in the bowers.’
"Oh! does he love me,
When my voice teaches
The very speeches
He then spoke of me?
Alas! what flavour
Still with me lingers?"
(But she laughed as my kisses
Glowed in her fingers
With love's old blisses.)


That I should sing upon this bed!—with you
To listen, and such words still left to say!
Yet was it I that sang? The voice seemed hers,
As on the very day she sang to me;
When, having done, she took out of my hand
Something that I had played with all the while
And laid it down beyond my reach; and so
Turning my face round till it fronted hers,—
"Weeping or laughing, which was best?" she said.
But these are foolish tales. How should I show
The heart that glowed then with love's heat, each day
More and more brightly?—when for long years now
The very flame that flew about the heart,
And gave it fiery wings, has come to be
The lapping blaze of hell's environment
Whose tongues all bid the molten heart despair.
Yet one more thing comes back on me to-night
Which I may tell you: for it bore my soul
Dread firstlings of the brood that rend it now.
It chanced that in our last year's wanderings
We dwelt at Monza, far away from home,
If home we had: and in the Duomo there
I sometimes entered with her when she prayed.
An image of Our Lady stands there, wrought
In marble by some great Italian hand
In the great days when she and Italy
Sat on one throne together: and to her
And to none else my loved one told her heart.
She was a woman then; and as she knelt,—
Her sweet brow in the sweet brow's shadow there,—
They seemed two kindred forms whereby our land
(Whose work still serves the world for miracle)
Made manifest herself in womanhood.
Father, the day I speak of was the first
For weeks that I had borne her company
Into the Duomo; and those weeks had been
Much troubled, for then first the glimpses came
Of some impenetrable restlessness
Growing in her to make her changed and cold.
And as we entered there that day, I bent
My eyes on the fair Image, and I said
Within my heart, "Oh turn her heart to me!"
And so I left her to her prayers, and went
To gaze upon the pride of Monza's shrine,
Where in the sacristy the light still falls
Upon the Iron Crown of Italy,
On whose crowned heads the day has closed, nor yet
The daybreak gilds another head to crown.
But coming back, I wondered when I saw
That the sweet Lady of her prayers now stood
Alone without her; until further off,
Before some new Madonna gaily decked,
Tinselled and gewgawed, a slight German toy,
I saw her kneel, still praying. At my step
She rose, and side by side we left the church.
I was much moved, and sharply questioned her
Of her transferred devotion; but she seemed
Stubborn and heedless; till she lightly laughed
And said: "The old Madonna? Aye indeed,
She had my old thoughts,—this one has my new."
Then silent to the soul I held my way:
And from the fountains of the public place
Unto the pigeon-haunted pinnacles,
Bright wings and water winnowed the bright air;
And stately with her laugh's subsiding smile
She went, with clear-swayed waist and towering neck
And hands held light before her; and the face
Which long had made a day in my life's night
Was night in day to me; as all men's eyes
Turned on her beauty, and she seemed to tread
Beyond my heart to the world made for her.
Ah there! my wounds will snatch my sense again:
The pain comes billowing on like a full cloud
Of thunder, and the flash that breaks from it
Leaves my brain burning. That's the wound he gave,
The Austrian whose white coat I still made match
With his white face, only the two grew red
As suits his trade. The devil makes them wear
White for a livery, that the blood may show
Braver that brings them to him. So he looks
Sheer o'er the field and knows his own at once.
Give me a draught of water in that cup;
My voice feels thick; perhaps you do not hear;
But you must hear. If you mistake my words
And so absolve me, I am sure the blessing
Will burn my soul. If you mistake my words
And so absolve me, Father, the great sin
Is yours, not mine: mark this: your soul shall burn
With mine for it. I have seen pictures where
Souls burned with Latin shriekings in their mouths:
Shall my end be as theirs? Nay, but I know
'Tis you shall shriek in Latin. Some bell rings,
Rings through my brain: it strikes the hour in hell.
You see I cannot, Father; I have tried,
But cannot, as you see. These twenty times
Beginning, I have come to the same point
And stopped. Beyond, there are but broken words
Which will not let you understand my tale.
It is that then we have her with us here,
As when she wrung her hair out in my dream
To-night, till all the darkness reeked of it.
Her hair is always wet, for she has kept
Its tresses wrapped about her side for years;
And when she wrung them round over the floor,
I heard the blood between her fingers hiss;
So that I sat up in my bed and screamed
Once and again; and once to once, she laughed.
Look that you turn not now,—she's at your back:
Gather your robe up, Father, and keep close,
Or she'll sit down on it and send you mad.
At Iglio in the first thin shade o' the hills
The sand is black and red. The black was black
When what was spilt that day sank into it,
And the red scarcely darkened. There I stood
This night with her, and saw the sand the same.
What would you have me tell you? Father, father,
How shall I make you know? You have not known
The dreadful soul of woman, who one day
Forgets the old and takes the new to heart,
Forgets what man remembers, and therewith
Forgets the man. Nor can I clearly tell
How the change happened between her and me.
Her eyes looked on me from an emptied heart
When most my heart was full of her; and still
In every corner of myself I sought
To find what service failed her; and no less
Than in the good time past, there all was hers.
What do you love? Your Heaven? Conceive it spread
For one first year of all eternity
And then when most your soul is blent with it
And all yields song together,—then it stands
O' the sudden like a pool that once gave back
Your image, but now drowns it and is clear
Again,—or like a sun bewitched, that burns
Your shadow from you, and still shines in sight.
How could you bear it? Would you not cry out,
Among those eyes grown blind to you, those ears
That hear no more your voice you hear the same,—
But hell, hell, hell?"—until the name so breathed
Whirled with hot wind and sucked you down in fire?
Even so I stood the day her empty heart
Left her place empty in our home, while yet
I knew not why she went nor where she went
Nor how to reach her: so I stood the day
When to my prayers at last one sight of her
Was granted, and I looked on heaven made pale
With scorn, and heard heaven mock me in that laugh.
O sweet, long sweet! Was that some ghost of you,
Even as your ghost that haunts me now,—twin shapes
Of fear and hatred? May I find you yet
Mine when death wakes? Ah! be it even in flame,
We may have sweetness yet, if you but say
As once in childish sorrow: "Not my pain,
My pain was nothing: oh your poor poor love,
Your broken love!"
My Father, have I not
Yet told you the last things of that last day
On which I went to meet her by the sea?
Midway upon my journey, when I stopped
To buy the dagger at the village fair,
I saw two cursed rats about the place
I knew for spies—blood-sellers both. That day
Was not yet over; for three hours to come
I prized my life: and so I looked around
For safety. A poor painted mountebank
Was playing tricks and shouting in a crowd.
I knew he must have heard my name, so I
Pushed past and whispered to him who I was,
And of my danger. Straight he hustled me
Into his booth, as it were in the trick,
And brought me out next minute with my face
All smeared in patches and a zany's gown;
And there I handed him his cups and balls
And swung the sand-bags round to clear the ring
For half an hour. The spies came once and looked;
And while they stopped, and made all sights and sounds
Sharp to my startled senses, I remember
A woman laughed above me. I looked up
And saw where a brown-shouldered harlot leaned
Half through a tavern window thick with vine.
Some man had come behind her in the room
And caught her by her arms, and she had turned
With that coarse empty laugh on him, as now
He munched her neck with kisses, while the vine
Crawled in her back.
And three hours afterwards,
When she that I had run all risks to meet
Laughed as I told you, my life burned to death
Within me, for I thought it like the laugh
Heard at the fair. She had not left me long;
But all she might have changed to, or might change to,
(I know nought since—she never speaks a word—)
Seemed in that laugh. Have I not told you yet,
Not told you all this time what happened, Father,
When I had offered her the little knife,
And bade her keep it for my sake that loved her,
And she had laughed? Have I not told you yet?
"Take it," I said to her the second time,
"Take it and keep it." And then came a fire
That burnt my hand; and then the fire was blood,
And sea and sky were blood and fire, and all
The day was one red blindness; till it seemed,
Within the whirling brain's eclipse, that she
Or I or all things bled or burned to death.
And then I found her laid against my feet
And knew that I had stabbed her, and saw still
Her look in falling. For she took the knife
Deep in her heart, even as I bade her then,
And fell; and her stiff bodice scooped the sand
Into her bosom.
And she keeps it, see,
Do you not see she keeps it?—there, beneath
Wet fingers and wet tresses, in her heart.
For look you, when she stirs her hand, it shows
The little hilt of horn and pearl,—even such
A dagger as our women of the coast
Twist in their garters.
Father, I have done:
And from her side now she unwinds the thick
Dark hair; all round her side it is wet through,
But, like the sand at Iglio, does not change.
Now you may see the dagger clearly. Father,
I have told all: tell me at once what hope
Can reach me still. For now she draws it out
Slowly, and only smiles as yet: look, Father,
She scarcely smiles: but I shall hear her laugh

Rose of Lancaster
Divine diva
My eyes fill
When I hear your voice 
'Das Lied von der Erde'
Deep like the earth
Warm like the sun
Soft like the spring


FATHER, I scarcely dare to pray,
So clear I see, now it is done,
That I have wasted half my day,
And left my work but just begun;

So clear I see that things I thought 
Were right or harmless were a sin;
So clear I see that I have sought,
Unconscious, selfish aims to win;

So clear I see that I have hurt
The souls I might have helped to save; 
That I have slothful been, inert,
Deaf to the calls thy leaders gave.

In outskirts of thy kingdoms vast,
Father, the humblest spot give me;
Set me the lowliest task thou hast; 
Let me repentant work for thee

Let us go hence: the night is now at hand;
      The day is overworn, the birds all flown;
      And we have reaped the crops the gods have sown;
  Despair and death; deep darkness o'er the land,
  Broods like an owl; we cannot understand
      Laughter or tears, for we have only known
      Surpassing vanity: vain things alone
  Have driven our perverse and aimless band.

  Let us go hence, somewhither strange and cold,
     To Hollow Lands where just men and unjust
  Find end of labour, where's rest for the old,
     Freedom to all from love and fear and lust.
  Twine our torn hands! O pray the earth enfold
     Our life-sick hearts and turn them into dust.

Time and companionship make our love sweeter, 
Every moment together draws us closer.
Even our buddies witness our bond grows stronger, 
Just stay being true and do not become a stranger.
Embrace our promise to love each other, 
Endless shall it become as we stay together.

And as time goes by. 
None can stop our love's lullaby, 
Deep inside our hearts it shall stand by.

Over the years our love is steadfast, 
Like true lovebirds ours will last.
Inspiration makes us endearing, 
Volts of vigor make us enduring.
Embracing our dreams for the future, 
Reminds us always of  true love to nurture. 

My lamp is out, my task is done,
And up the stair with lingering feet
I climb. The staircase clock strikes one.
Good night, my love! good night, my sweet!

My solitary room I gain.
A single star makes incomplete
The blackness of the window pane.
Good night, my love! good night, my sweet!

Dim and more dim its sparkle grows,
And ere my head the pillows meet,
My lids are fain themselves to close.
Good night, my love! good night, my sweet!

My lips no other words can say,
But still they murmur and repeat
To you, who slumber far away,
Good night, my love! good night, my sweet

the quiet skies:
And from the west,
Where the sun, his day's work ended,
Lingers as in content,
There falls on the old, gray city
An influence luminous and serene,
A shining peace.

The smoke ascends
In a rosy-and-golden haze. The spires
Shine and are changed. In the valley
Shadows rise. The lark sings on. The sun,
Closing his benediction,
Sinks, and the darkening air
Thrills with a sense of the triumphing night-
Night with her train of stars
And her great gift of sleep.

So be my passing!
My task accomplish'd and the long day done,
My wages taken, and in my heart
Some late lark singing,
Let me be gather'd to the quiet west,
The sundown splendid and serene,
Death. 

To many hours spent upon the road, 
my return, a most lonely entrance, 
times separation has left empty space, 
leaving need of wanting eminence.

As I enter the room. . 

darkness, 
like everyone has fallen' from vision, 
the lonely glow of a single candle, 
tells the story of all that is known.

Switch of light, illuminates shadows, 
and my true, I now must bare, 
huddled in corner, covered in blanket, 
is my sweet Lady, oh so fair.

Ever so slowly, place a kiss on her brow, 
as not to startle, my sleeping beauty, 
with exhale of lengthen breath, 
state of rest is her moody.

Slowly I lift her, carrying to the loft, 
the room of our sacred bed, 
many a night, we dance between sheets, 
yet tonight she shall lay her head.

Somberly, I retire to her side, 
as to not awaken her more, 
a long day has been her journey, 
and this moment I find a'more.

So let her rest in peaceful slumber, 
for tomorrow there be 'ell to pay, 
she'll awaken to her loving kids, 
and I once again.   

gone away.. 

When I go up through the mowing field,
The headless aftermath,
Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew,
Half closes the garden path.

And when I come to the garden ground,
The whir of sober birds
Up from the tangle of withered weeds
Is sadder than any words

A tree beside the wall stands bare,
But a leaf that lingered brown,
Disturbed, I doubt not, by my thought,
Comes softly rattling down.

I end not far from my going forth
By picking the faded blue
Of the last remaining aster flower
To carry again to you. 

Well, did you ever!  Oh how grand! 
In the smallest of rooms I stared
As farmer friends beamed, proud planning
Had now worked, to get me in there.

Scenes of sealife, all shaped to size, 
Gulls climbed tiled walls, ultra-style flooring
Depicting shore was grand, beguiling, 
But nothing beat the best encore.  .

New plastic loo-seat caught my eye.
A see-through piece, - - clear, indiscreet
Watery-blues fully defied
Belief with petrified fish,  neatly
Entombed, smiling, dead-eyed at me! 
Sea-horses cavorting with crabs
Amid floating bubbles, freely
Suspended in jellified padding, 
Completed with shells by the score, 
Sea-weedy bordered,


flourescent too! 

I smiled warily, bolted the door
And then did the best I could do, 
I just flushed it - - - unobtrusively

laugh a day
laugh it now 
laugh as loud 
as you want; 
it shakes up your body
lets good things flow
through your veins; 
don’t think about it
just laugh a minute
or laugh a day
laugh long as laugh-time
 

 
you and I 
come let’s laugh
ha ha ha ha
just like that 
as two humans
alive and meaning well
ha ha ha ha



not the laugh of envy
or derision
or being superior
oh no, never that sort of laugh
but simple laugh
as laugh as laugh
 

not the laugh of victory
or of I-know-better
or see-I-told-you-so
but just the laugh of being
the laugh of life
the laugh of love
as natural as laugh



you and I 
come let’s laugh
ha ha ha ha
just like that 
as two humans
alive and meaning well
ha ha ha ha



I brought this laugh
for no rhyme or reason
I heard it in the oceans 
and in the trees
and I got it free
so really there’s no fee
but I’d like you to pass 
it back to me and I’ll 
throw it back to you
like playing ball; 
or you can pass the ball
to anyone anyway you like
this laugh as bright
as sun rays on ocean waves



you and I 
come let’s laugh
ha ha ha ha
just like that 
as two humans
alive and meaning well
ha ha ha ha


THE trees bend down along the stream,
Where anchored swings my tiny boat.
The day is one to drowse and dream
And list the thrush's throttling note.
When music from his bosom bleeds
Among the river's rustling reeds.
No ripple stirs the placid pool,
When my adventurous line is cast,
A truce to sport, while clear and cool,
The mirrored clouds slide softly past.
The sky gives back a blue divine,
And all the world's wide wealth is mine.
A pickerel leaps, a bow of light,
The minnows shine from side to side.
The first faint breeze comes up the tide — 
I pause with half uplifted oar,
While night drifts down to claim the shore. 

THOUGH your eyes with tears were blind,	
Pain upon the path you trod:	
Well we knew, the hosts behind,	
Voice and shining of a god.	
 
For your darkness was our day:	        
Signal fires, your pains untold	
Lit us on our wandering way	
To the mystic heart of gold.	
 
Naught we knew of the high land,	
Beauty burning in its spheres;	        
Sorrow we could understand	
And the mystery told in tears. 

Somebody said, in the crowd, last eve, 
 That you were married, or soon to be.
I have not thought of you, I believe, 
 Since last we parted.  Let me see: 
Five long Summers have passed since then –
 Each has been pleasant in its own way –
And you are but one of a dozen men
 Who have played the suitor a Summer day.

But, nevertheless, when I heard your name, 
 Coupled with some one’s, not my own, 
There burned in my bosom a sudden flame, 
 That carried me back to the day that is flown.
I was sitting again by the laughing brook, 
 With you at my feet, and the sky above, 
And my heart was fluttering under your look –
 The unmistakable look of Love.

Again your breath, like a South wind, fanned
 My cheek, where the blushes came and went; 
And the tender clasp of your strong, warm hand
 Sudden thrills through my pulses sent.
Again you were mine by Love’s decree: 
So for a moment it seemed last night, 
 When somebody mentioned your name to me.

Just for the moment I thought you mine –
 Loving me, wooing me, as of old.
The tale remembered seemed half divine –
 Though I held it lightly enough when told.
The past seemed fairer than when it was near, 
 As ‘blessings brighten when taking flight, ’
And just for the moment I held you near –
 When somebody mentioned your name last night. 

A LEAF for hand in hand!
   You natural persons old and young!
   You on the Mississippi, and on all the branches and bayous of the
         Mississippi!
   You friendly boatmen and mechanics! You roughs!
   You twain! And all processions moving along the streets!
   I wish to infuse myself among you till I see it common for you to
         walk hand in hand

Between the being and memory
A memo's hit against a human
And the crumbs of waiting

Between the foreboding and the first darkness
Like a shadow
Alone with the burden of silence

Between the morning and awakening
Star-like he carries the cross
A leaf of hope


Travka nadanja

Izmedu bica i sjecanja
O covjeka razbi se pomen
I truni cekanja

Izmedju slutnje i prve tmine
Ko sjenka
Sam s teretom tišine

Izmedu jutra i nudenja
Zvjezdano nosi svoj krst
Travka nadanja


that easily either.  It takes a bluster, 
a filabuster of north wind, 
and the wasp-sting of the first
chill of late September
to tear them off the page
of summer.

Persuasion doesn’t do it.
Sometimes in the middle of winter, 
(the DEAD of winter, as they say)  
you might see one shriveled
oakleaf, dangling from a frozen
filament of stem, 
defiant, victorious.

Nothing likes to end; 
the October wind invites
the leaf to tango in the frosty air. 
A shy curtsey, a twirling turn, 
a pirouette, then the dance
is over and only the bare
fingers of the tree remain. 

If there’s a hand a soft bottom call
Autumns of rain autumns of gold
In each leaf the soul beauty enfolds
And it’s not dying just fallen asleep
Beauty spelled peaceful in spring to leap

And another lone of heart
Struggled from isolation’s depths
Hoping to make a fresh start

One who always occupied
The same solitary spaces
Through a curious window found
Another who traveled to many places

One who never really searched
For a lifetime counterpart
Dared make a real connection with
One who knew more of Love’s Art

One who never tried, yet true
One who tried and lost a few
Steeled themselves as small steps they took 
To precipice’s edge to risk a look

Two having weighed the risk
Of making promises to keep
Held hands and shared a smile
Then together took the leap

One and One became One
On Leap Year Day Instead of the separate Two
That they had been before

So if you are thinking of
Taking just such a leap
For the sake of sharing love
That’s both true and deep
On Leap Year Day in Leap, Leap, I say! 
Leap! Marriage is great! 
Leap! Leap! Leap! 
Leap! Don’t hesitate

I never thought our story
Would come this far
And we still have yet to write 
A whole lot more

I keep waiting for us
To go up in flames
Keep waiting for us to end
So I can assign the blame 

Though there's no sign of disaster in sight
I can't help but remember 
That it's when you least expect  
That disaster decides to strike

But for once the skies seem to be clear
So maybe I should enjoy
How your hand brushes against mine
Maybe it's not wrong to like
The chills you send down my spine

Maybe I should enjoy 
The feeling of you being close 
And your breath caressing my face 
Maybe it's not such a bad thing
That you make my heart race

I never thought I'd have all this doubt about you
Over flowing inside my head 
But I'm ready to throw caution to the wind
And take a leap of faith instead


A learned man came to me once. 
He said, "I know the way, -- come
 

And I was overjoyed at this. 
Together we hastened. 
Soon, too soon, were we 
Where my eyes were useless, 
And I knew not the ways of my feet. 
I clung to the hand of my friend; 
But at last he cried, "I am lost

"A learned person 
Who had learnt many moral books; 
Who knows what is just and morality

Designed bangles jewelry, 
Who bargains her beauty – 
With narrow waist and broad hip 
Resembling the hood of a cobra - 
Sells her private parts for money! 
 
A person who destroyed the almshouse 
Meant for poor people and saints

A Leave-Taking

          Let us go hence, my songs; she will not hear. 
          Let us go hence together without fear;
          Keep silence now, for singing

time is over, 
          And over all old things and all things dear. 
          She loves not you nor me as we all love her. 
          Yea, though we sang as angels in her ear, 
                   She would not hear.

          Let us rise up and part; she will not know.
          Let us go seaward as the great winds go, 
          Full of blown sand and foam; what help is here? 
          There is no help, for all these things are so, 
          And all the world is bitter as a tear.
          And how these things are, though ye strove to show, 
                   She would not know.

          Let us go home and hence; she will not weep. 
          We gave love many dreams and days to keep, 
          Flowers without scent, and fruits that would not grow, 
          Saying, `If thou wilt, thrust in thy sickle and reap.' 
          All is reaped now; no grass is left to mow; 
          And we that sowed, though all we fell on sleep, 
                   She would not weep.

          Let us go hence and rest; she will not love. 
          She shall not hear us if we sing hereof, 
          Nor see love's ways, how sore they are and steep. 
          Come hence, let be, lie still; it is enough. 
          Love is a barren sea, bitter and deep; 
          And though she saw all heaven in flower above, 
                   She would not love.

          Let us give up, go down; she will not care. 
          Though all the stars made gold of all the air, 
          And the sea moving saw before it move 
          One moon

flower making all the foam

flowers fair; 
          Though all those waves went over us, and drove 
          Deep down the stifling lips and drowning hair, 
                   She would not care.

          Let us go hence, go hence; she will not see. 
          Sing all once more together; surely she, 
          She too, remembering days and words that were, 
          Will turn a little toward us, sighing; but we, 
          We are hence, we are gone, as though we had not been there. 
          Nay, and though all men seeing had pity on me, 
                   She would not see. 

She will not smile;
She will not stir;
I marvel while
I look on her.
The lips are chilly
And will not speak;
The ghost of a lily
In either cheek.

Her hair--ah me!
Her hair--her hair!
How helplessly
My hands go there!
But my caresses
Meet not hers,
O golden tresses
That thread my tears!

I kiss the eyes
On either lid,
Where her love lies
Forever hid.
I cease my weeping
And smile and say:
I will be sleeping
Thus, some day

Stand still, and I will read to thee
A lecture, love, in love's philosophy.
    These three hours that we have spent,
    Walking here, two shadows went
Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd.
But, now the sun is just above our head,
    We do those shadows tread,
    And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd.
So whilst our infant loves did grow,
Disguises did, and shadows, flow
From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not so.
That love has not attain'd the high'st degree,
Which is still diligent lest others see.

Except our loves at this noon stay,
We shall new shadows make the other way.
    As the first were made to blind
    Others, these which come behind
Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.
If our loves faint, and westwardly decline,
    To me thou, falsely, thine,
    And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.
The morning shadows wear away,
But these grow longer all the day;
But oh, love's day is short, if love decay.
Love is a growing, or full constant light,
And his first minute, after noon, is night. 

To hear, one day, report from those who came
With pitying sorrow, or exultant joy,
To tell of earthly tasks in His employ:
For some were sorry when they saw how slow
The stream of heavenly love on earth must flow;
And some were glad because their eyes had seen,
Along its banks, fresh flowers and living green.
So, at a certain hour, before the throne
The youngest angel, Asmiel, stood alone;
Nor glad, nor sad, but full of earnest thought,
And thus his tidings to the Master brought:
"Three servants of thy holy name, renowned
"Above their fellows. One is very wise,
"With thoughts that ever range above the skies;
"And one is gifted with the golden speech
"That makes men glad to hear when he will teach;
"And one, with no rare gift or grace endued,
"Has won the people's love by doing good.
"With three such saints Lupon is trebly blest;

The hearts of all are like an open book:
"In every soul the secret thought I read,
"And well I know who loves me best indeed.
"But every life has pages vacant still,
"Whereon a man may write the thing he will;
"Therefore I read in silence, day by day,
"And wait for hearts untaught to learn my way.
"But thou shalt go to Lupon, to the three
"Who serve me there, and take this word from me:
"Tell each of them his Master bids him go
"Alone to Spiran's huts, across the snow;
"There he shall find a certain task for me:
"But what, I do not tell to them nor thee.
"Give thou the message, make my word the test,
"And crown for me the one who answers best

"
Silent the angel stood, with folded hands,
Then drew one breath, obedient and elate,
And passed, the self-same hour, through Lupon's gate.

First to the Temple door he made his way;
And there, because it was an holy-day,
He saw the folk by thousands thronging, stirred
By ardent thirst to hear the preacher's word.
Then, while the echoes murmured Bernol's name,
Through aisles that hushed behind him, Bernol came;
Strung to the keenest pitch of conscious might,
With lips prepared and firm, and eyes alight.
One moment at the pulpit steps he knelt
In silent prayer, and on his shoulder felt
The angel's hand: --"The Master bids thee go
"Alone to Spiran's huts, across the snow,
"To serve Him there

" Then Bernol's hidden face
Went white as death, and for about the space
Of ten slow heart-beats there was no reply;
Till Bernol looked around and whispered, "WHY?"
But answer to his question came there none;
The angel sighed, and with a sigh was gone.

Within the humble house where Malvin spent
His studious years, on holy things intent,
Sweet stillness reigned; and there the angel found
The saintly sage immersed in thought profound,
Weaving with patient toil and willing care
A web of wisdom, wonderful and fair:
A seamless robe for Truth's great bridal meet,
And needing but one thread to be complete.
Then Asmiel touched his hand, and broke the thread
Of fine-spun thought, and very gently said,
"The One of whom thou thinkest bids thee go
"Alone to Spiran's huts, across the snow,
"To serve Him there

" With sorrow and surprise
Malvin looked up, reluctance in his eyes.
The broken thought, the strangeness of the call,
The perilous passage of the mountain-wall,
The solitary journey, and the length
Of ways unknown, too great for his frail strength,
Appalled him. With a doubtful brow
He scanned the doubtful task, and muttered "HOW?"
But Asmiel answered, as he turned to go,
With cold, disheartened voice, "I do not know


Now as he went, with fading hope, to seek
Scarce twenty steps away whom should he meet
But Fermor, hurrying cheerful down the street,
With ready heart that faced his work like play,
And joyed to find it greater every day!
The angel stopped him with uplifted hand,
"He whom thou servest here would have thee go
"Alone to Spiran's huts, across the snow,
"To serve Him there

" Ere Asmiel breathed again
The eager answer leaped to meet him, "WHEN?"

The angel's face with inward joy grew bright,
And all his figure glowed with heavenly light;
He took the golden circlet from his brow
And gave the crown to Fermor, answering, "Now!
"For thou hast met the Master's bidden test,
"And I have found the man who loves Him best.
"Not thine, nor mine, to question or reply
"When He commands us, asking 'how?' or 'why?'
"He knows the cause; His ways are wise and just;
"Who serves the King must serve with perfect trust

"Once on a time, the ancient legends tell,
Truth, rising from the bottom of her well,
Looked on the world, but, hearing how it lied,
Returned to her seclusion horrified.
There she abode, so conscious of her worth,
Not even Pilate's Question called her forth,
Nor Galileo, kneeling to deny
The Laws that hold our Planet 'neath the sky.
Meantime, her kindlier sister, whom men call
Fiction, did all her work and more than all,
With so much zeal, devotion, tact, and care,
That no one noticed Truth was otherwhere.

Then came a War when, bombed and gassed and mined,
Truth rose once more, perforce, to meet mankind,
And through the dust and glare and wreck of things,
Beheld a phantom on unbalanced wings,
Reeling and groping, dazed, dishevelled, dumb,
But semaphoring direr deeds to come.

Truth hailed and bade her stand; the quavering shade
Clung to her knees and babbled, "Sister, aid!
I am--I was--thy Deputy, and men
Besought me for my useful tongue or pen
To gloss their gentle deeds, and I complied,
And they, and thy demands, were satisfied.
But this--" she pointed o'er the blistered plain,
"This is beyond me! Take thy work again


Tablets and pen transferred, she fled afar,
And Truth assumed the record of the War. 
She saw, she heard, she read, she tried to tell
Facts beyond precedent and parallel--
Unfit to hint or breathe, much less to write,
But happening every minute, day and night.
She called for proof. It came. The dossiers grew.
She marked them, first, "Return. This can't be true

"
Then, underneath the cold official word:
"This is not really half of what occurred


She faced herself at last, the story runs,
And telegraphed her sister: "Come at once.
Facts out of hand. Unable overtake
Without your aid. Come back for Truth's own sake!
Co-equal rank and powers if you agree.

They need us both, but you far more than me!"Out of lemon flowers
loosed
on the moonlight, love's
lashed and insatiable
essences,
sodden with fragrance,
the lemon tree's yellow
emerges,
the lemons
move down
from the tree's planetarium

Delicate merchandise!
The harbors are big with it-
bazaars
for the light and the
barbarous gold.
We open
the halves
of a miracle,
and a clotting of acids
brims
into the starry
divisions:
creation's
original juices,
irreducible, changeless,
alive:
so the freshness lives on
in a lemon,
in the sweet-smelling house of the rind,
the proportions, arcane and acerb.

Cutting the lemon
the knife
leaves a little cathedral:
alcoves unguessed by the eye
that open acidulous glass
to the light; topazes
riding the droplets,
altars,
aromatic facades.

So, while the hand
holds the cut of the lemon,
half a world
on a trencher,
the gold of the universe
wells
to your touch:
a cup yellow
with miracles,
a breast and a nipple
perfuming the earth;
a flashing made fruitage,
the diminutive fire of a planet. 

Although it's flight is quite erratic
 This dainty insect soars ecstatic
 And though it seems to have no power
 It effortlessly gains each flower
 On wings so fragile and exquisite
 Every blossom begs it's visit
 And we entreat the question why


You think that you are beauty
transposed into beautiful.

What ignorance possesses your
neuronic pulsating mind.

Are you in control of your mind, 
or does your ephemerality control it? 

How long will this superficiality 
of mind, last? 

Until your mind starts to realise 
beauty is paper thin.

When all that really matters is an
understanding that you are a mind.

That your body is full to the brim
with bacteria in the trillions.

And that you have not explored the aim
of being, is not to be for eternity.

The growing idleness of summer grass
With its frail kites of furious butterflies
Requests the lemonade of simple praise
In scansion gentler than my hammock swings
And rituals no more upsetting than a
Black maid shaking linen as she sings
The plain notes of some Protestant hosanna—
Since I lie idling from the thought in things—

Or so they should, until I hear the cries
Of two small children hunting yellow wings,
Who break my Sabbath with the thought of sin.
Brother and sister, with a common pin,
Frowning like serious lepidopterists.
The little surgeon pierces the thin eyes.
Crouched on plump haunches, as a mantis prays
She shrieks to eviscerate its abdomen.
The lesson is the same. The maid removes
Both prodigies from their interest in science.
The girl, in lemon frock, begins to scream
As the maimed, teetering thing attempts its flight.
She is herself a thing of summery light,
Frail as a flower in this blue August air,
Not marked for some late grief that cannot speak.

The mind swings inward on itself in fear
Swayed towards nausea from each normal sign.
Heredity of cruelty everywhere,
And everywhere the frocks of summer torn,
The long look back to see where choice is born,
As summer grass sways to the scythe's design. 

This is 
the direct 
feeling 
with being 
in the state 
of illusion

Songs 
and 
poems
are written 
trying to 
describe 
the 
indescribable

therefore, 
we are all 
suspended 
in a force 
which has 
no words

Plant 
a seed 
and you 
will know 
what lies 
beyond 
the 
ordinary. . 

I give you 
the gift 
of seeing 
for the first 
time. . 

Twelve Apostles

and 
broke bread

These men 
are said 
to have been 
devotees

What 
were they 
following? 

''Follow me 
and I will 
show you''

but, what 
we see 
is not 
interpreted 
the same way 
twice. . 
nor through 
sets 
of eyes

So, 
the only teacher 
is 
the one 
who sits 
on top 
of your 
head.

You see, 
no one 
follows 
the same 
path. . 

Sorrow 
follows 
desperation 
and 
defeat. 

To surrender, 
is 
to pass thru 
the blood 
and the 
pain

There is 
only one 
individual 
who is 
standing 
with you

Walk 
in the dark, 
in the light, 
trudge 
the path 
alone. . 

Peace
go find 
your peace 
and share 
that 
indescribable 
envy 
with others
but 
do not 
try to 
sway them 
by boasting
triumph. . 

Just be. 
and 
the example 
is set.

I watch on You


Tube the young man who looks something like an old man 
He does not want to be pitied
He explains his way in Happiness

Humbled I think that there are so many things 
I an old man still have
That he will never have

Sorrow comes 
I am ashamed of myself

He lived such a short life 
And with so many difficulties

I will try in the future to focus less
On all I have not done and probably can never do

Life and disease are merciless
The young man is gone

I am an old man still alive
I still can write a poem for myself
And for the memory of another 
Of the many teachers
I have had in the wisdom of life 
I am not sure I have been able to learn from. 

Lying in my hammock, I'm looking at the sky.
No matter what goes on down here, the birds go sailing by.
They don't pay me attention, for I am no concern.
I feel if I watch long enough, there's so much I could learn.

What is it that they're showing  me that I have yet to see? 
They fly and soar without a care, just happy to be free.
I guess I'm very lucky to be living as I do.
I have nothing that I yearn for and my bills arn't overdue.


I'll just lie here in my hammock on my front porch in the shade.
I'll thank the birds for showing me that I've really got it made! !


'Tis time, my soul, thou shouldst be purged of pride.
What men are these with thee, whose ill deeds done
Make thee thus shrink from them and be denied?
They are but as thou art, each mother's son
A convict in transgression. Here is one,
Sayest thou, who struck his fellow and he died.
And yet he weeps hot tears. Do thy tears run?

Where is thy greater virtue? Thinkest thou sin
Is but crime's record on the judgment seat?
Or must thou wait for death to be bowed down?
Oh for a righteous reading which should join
Thy deeds together in an accusing sheet,
And leave thee if thou couldst, to face men's frown

Two swallowtails
Danced a dance of love
Aloft on a summer draft
Circling 
Rising
Wings touching
Glances in the sun
Two butterflies
The briefest of lives
Forever entwined
Passionate moment
A chapel of flowers
A cathedral of light
A lesson in love


It's not as if I owned your heart.
That is the mistake of the lover
who thinks his beloved is no longer free, 
who is dismayed when she blooms
into a new confidence and flowers 
in acts of independence. He cannot see
he is still the shining center for her.
His heart no longer informs his actions: 
He misplaces his tenderness, claims it's lost.
What remains is hurt And he turns away
from her light, seeks a dark solace in envy.                       Bright keys only they heard in their song
of love fall flat. The music they knew snaps, 
no longer able to turn passion into love. 

Nobody gives a damn about you 
Until you pick up a gun or strap on a bomb 
And kill someone with your version of kindness
Nobody gives a damn about you
Until you have a couple too many drinks
Get behind the wheel of your SUV
And kill someone with your version of having fun
Nobody gives a damn about you
Until you call someone a Honky or a Nigger
And kill someone with your version of the truth
Nobody gives a damn about you
Until you learn to give a damn about yourself(*when a young girl ventures out for her
  first class in swimming she should briefed
  on consequence of body baring as well
  as likely presence of paedophiles) .

a young girl went for swimming class
changed in to her new suit, surprised
at her own form and size, the aura of 
her bountiful beauty and freshness that 
enchanted her, went in to a world of 
dream, slipped in to pool like a princess, 
coach in tow who stunned and amazed
at her form and fragrance held her soft
in water in his hands, spread wide.

suddenly it seemed water is hot and
boiling, quickly they moved to change
room, where he bared her nude, it 
was her curiosity and his anxiety! .

Moody miserable looking day
The sun preferring to remain 
Hide since first ray; 
Sky black faced morose
Sends down thunderous cursing roars- 

Hooligan wind freed, scoops in
To drive out hapless dry leaves 
The lonely pavements off; 
Chilling my spine now it begins 
To rain, out there cats and dogs- 

I look out of my window panes
To me the world outside seen
Drained of life deserted forlorn
Left alone to face the onslaught from top; 
No body around here? Oh! I find her close-

Right on top of my neighbor’s roof
I see a crow on the edge of eaves board
Sitting as if in deep trance
Sodden unmindful of the outside chaos 
Created by the sky atop-

What she is doing out there I wonder 
Could have moved yards to the tree over 
And sought shelter from rains’ torture 
But no; bathing in the horrendous showers 
She sits sharp with her uncanny eyes-

I wait; watch again to locate her sight 
She looks towards a hole down the lane
A hole large, to where the run off rush
Passing the yard the pavements and bush
Where the flow gets sucked and water out gush- 

And all of sudden I see her take off 
Stoop and pick up a sizable frog
That comes out of the pit water logged; 
With prey on her beak, flying she goes, 
Towards a branch of that tree near of-

Thunder roars; the wind witnessing soars 
Rain continues to come down non stop
And I learn a telling truth of life 
From this wise bird; a lesson how to spot
One’s daily meals; lesson essential all us for-I have been wondering
            What you are thinking about, and by now suppose
                         It is certainly not me.
            But the crocus is up, and the lark, and the blundering
                         Blood knows what it knows.
It talks to itself all night, like a sliding moonlit sea.

                         Of course, it is talking of you.
            At dawn, where the ocean has netted its catch of lights,
                         The sun plants one lithe foot
            On that spill of mirrors, but the blood goes worming through
                         Its warm Arabian nights,
Naming your pounding name again in the dark heart-root.

                         Who shall, of course, be nameless.
            Anyway, I should want you to know I have done my best,
                         As I'm sure you have, too.
            Others are bound to us, the gentle and blameless
                         Whose names are not confessed
In the ceaseless palaver. My dearest, the clear unquaried blue
 
                          Of those depths is all but blinding.
            You may remember that once you brought my boys
                         Two little woolly birds.
            Yesterday the older one asked for you upon finding		
                         Your thrush among his toys.
And the tides welled about me, and I could find no words.

                         There is not much else to tell.
            One tries one's best to continue as before,
                         Doing some little good.
            But I would have you know that all is not well
                         With a man dead set to ignore
The endless repetitions of his own murmurous blood. 




     And from Britannia's public posts retire,
     Nor longer, her ungrateful sons to please,
     For their advantage sacrifice your ease;

           Me into foreign realms my fate conveys,
     Through nations fruitful of immortal lays,
     Where the soft season and inviting clime
     Conspire to trouble your repose with rhyme.

           For wheresoe'er I turn my ravish'd eyes,
   Gay gilded scenes and shining prospects rise,
   Poetic fields encompass me around,
   And still I seem to tread on classic ground;
   For here the Muse so oft her harp has strung
   That not a mountain rears its head unsung,
   Renown'd in verse each shady thicket grows,
   And ev'ry stream in heavenly numbers flows

     How am I pleas'd to search the hills and woods
   For rising springs and celebrated floods!
   To view the Nar, tumultuous in his course,
  And trace the smooth Clitumnus to his source,
   To see the Mincio draw his wat'ry store
   Through the long windings of a fruitful shore,
   And hoary Albula's infected tide
   O'er the warm bed of smoking sulphur glide.

         Fir'd with a thousand raptures I survey
   Eridanus through flowery meadows stray,
   The king of floods! that rolling o'er the plains
   The towering Alps of half their moisture drains,
   And proudly swoln with a whole winter's snows,
   Distributes wealth and plenty where he flows.

         Sometimes, misguided by the tuneful throng,
   I look for streams immortaliz'd in song,
   That lost in silence and oblivion lie,
   (Dumb are their fountains and their channels dry)
   Yet run forever by the Muse's skill,
   And in the smooth description murmur still.

         Sometimes to gentle Tiber I retire,
   And the fam'd river's empty shores admire,
   That destitute of strength derives its course
   From thrifty urns and an unfruitful source;
   Yet sung so often in poetic lays,
   With scorn the Danube and the Nile surveys;
   So high the deathless Muse exalts her theme!
   Such was the Boin, a poor inglorious stream,
   That in Hibernian vales obscurely stray'd,
   And unobserv'd in wild meanders play'd;
   'Till by your lines and Nassau's sword renown'd,
   Its rising billows through the world resound,
   Where-e'er the hero's godlike acts can pierce,
   Or where the fame of an immortal verse.
         Oh could the Muse my ravish'd breast inspire
   With warmth like yours, and raise an equal fire,
   Unnumber'd beauties in my verse should shine,
   And Virgil's Italy should yield to mine!
         See how the golden groves around me smile,
   That shun the coast of Britain's stormy isle,
   Or when transplanted and preserv'd with care,
   Curse the cold clime, and starve in northern air.
   Here kindly warmth their mounting juice ferments
   To nobler tastes, and more exalted scents:
  Ev'n the rough rocks with tender myrtle bloom,
   And trodden weeds send out a rich perfume.
   Bear me, some god, to Baia's gentle seats,
   Or cover me in Umbria's green retreats;
   Where western gales eternally reside,
   And all the seasons lavish all their pride:
   Blossoms, and fruits, and flowers together rise,
   And the whole year in gay confusion lies.
         Immortal glories in my mind revive,
   And in my soul a thousand passions strive,
   When Rome's exalted beauties I descry
   Magnificent in piles of ruin lie.
   An amphitheatre's amazing height
   Here fills my eye with terror and delight,
   That on its public shows unpeopled Rome,
   And held uncrowded nations in its womb:
   Here pillars rough with sculpture pierce the skies:
   And here the proud triumphal arches rise,
   Where the old Romans deathless acts display'd,
   Their base degenerate progeny upbraid:
   Whole rivers here forsake the fields below,
   And wond'ring at their height through airy channels flow.
         Still to new scenes my wand'ring Muse retires,
   And the dumb show of breathing rocks admires;
   Where the smooth chisel all its force has shown,
   And soften'd into flesh the rugged stone.
   In solemn silence, a majestic band,
   Heroes, and gods, the Roman consuls stand,
   Stern tyrants, whom their cruelties renown,
   And emperors in Parian marble frown;
   While the bright dames, to whom they humbly su'd,
   Still show the charms that their proud hearts subdu'd.

         Fain would I Raphael's godlike art rehearse,
  And show th' immortal labours in my verse,
   Where from the mingled strength of shade and light
   A new creation rises to my sight,
   Such heav'nly figures from his pencil flow,
   So warm with life his blended colours glow.
   From theme to theme with secret pleasure tost,
   Amidst the soft variety I'm lost:
  Here pleasing airs my ravish'd soul confound
  With circling notes and labyrinths of sound;
   Here domes and temples rise in distant views,
   And opening palaces invite my Muse.

         How has kind Heav'n adorn'd the happy land,
   And scatter'd blessings with a wasteful hand!
   But what avail her unexhausted stores,
   Her blooming mountains, and her sunny shores,
   With all the gifts that heav'n and earth impart,
   The smiles of nature, and the charms of art,
   While proud oppression in her valleys reigns,
   And tyranny usurps her happy plains?
   The poor inhabitant beholds in vain
   The red'ning orange and the swelling grain:
   Joyless he sees the growing oils and wines,
   And in the myrtle's fragrant shade repines:
   Starves, in the midst of nature's bounty curst,
   And in the loaden vineyard dies for thirst.

         Oh Liberty, thou goddess heavenly bright,
   Profuse of bliss, and pregnant with delight!
   Eternal pleasures in thy presence reign,
   And smiling plenty leads thy wanton train;
   Eas'd of her load subjection grows more light,
   And poverty looks cheerful in thy sight;
   Thou mak'st the gloomy face of Nature gay,
   Giv'st beauty to the sun, and pleasure to the day.

         Thee, goddess, thee, Britannia's Isle adores;
   How has she oft exhausted all her stores,
   How oft in fields of death thy presence sought,
   Nor thinks the mighty prize too dearly bought!
   On foreign mountains may the sun refine
   The grape's soft juice, and mellow it to wine,
   With citron groves adorn a distant soil,
   And the fat olive swell with floods of oil:
   We envy not the warmer clime, that lies
   In ten degrees of more indulgent skies,
   Nor at the coarseness of our heaven repine,
   Tho' o'er our heads the frozen Pleiads shine:
   'Tis Liberty that crowns Britannia's Isle,
   And makes her barren rocks and her bleak mountains 
smile.

         Others with towering piles may please the sight,
   And in their proud aspiring domes delight;
   A nicer touch to the stretch'd canvas give,
   Or teach their animated rocks to live:
   'Tis Britain's care to watch o'er Europe's fate,
   And hold in balance each contending state,
   To threaten bold presumptuous kings with war,
   And answer her afflicted neighbours' pray'r.
   The Dane and Swede, rous'd up by fierce alarms,
   Bless the wise conduct of her pious arms:
   Soon as her fleets appear, their terrors cease,
  And all the northern world lies hush'd in peace.

         Th' ambitious Gaul beholds with secret dread
   Her thunder aim'd at his aspiring head,
  And fain her godlike sons would disunite
  By foreign gold, or by domestic spite;
  But strives in vain to conquer or divide,
  Whom Nassau's arms defend and counsels guide.

        Fir'd with the name, which I so oft have found
   The distant climes and different tongues resound,
  I bridle in my struggling Muse with pain,
   That longs to launch into a bolder strain.

         But I've already troubled you too long,
   Nor dare attempt a more advent'rous song.
   My humble verse demands a softer theme,
   A painted meadow, or a purling stream;
   Unfit for heroes; whom immortal lays,
   And lines like Virgil's, or like yours, should praise. 

Fanfare of northwest wind, a bluejay wind
announces autumn, and the equinox
rolls back blue bays to a far afternoon.
Somewhere beyond the Gorge Li Po is gone,
looking for friendship or an old love's sleeve
or writing letters to his children, lost,
and to his children's children, and to us.
What was his light? of lamp or moon or sun?
Say that it changed, for better or for worse,
sifted by leaves, sifted by snow; on mulberry silk
a slant of witch-light; on the pure text
a slant of genius; emptying mind and heart
for winecups and more winecups and more words.
What was his time? Say that it was a change,
but constant as a changing thing may be,
from chicory's moon-dark blue down the taut scale
to chicory's tenderest pink, in a pink field
such as imagination dreams of thought.
But of the heart beneath the winecup moon
the tears that fell beneath the winecup moon
for children lost, lost lovers, and lost friends,
what can we say but that it never ends?
Even for us it never ends, only begins.
Yet to spell down the poem on her page,
margining her phrases, parsing forth
the sevenfold prism of meaning, up the scale
from chicory pink to blue, is to assume
Li Po himself: as he before assumed
the poets and the sages who were his.
Like him, we too have eaten of the word:
with him are somewhere lost beyond the Gorge:
and write, in rain, a letter to lost children,
a letter long as time and brief as love.

II

And yet not love, not only love. Not caritas
or only that. Nor the pink chicory love,
deep as it may be, even to moon-dark blue,
in which the dragon of his meaning flew
for friends or children lost, or even
for the beloved horse, for Li Po's horse:
not these, in the self's circle so embraced:
too near, too dear, for pure assessment: no,
a letter crammed and creviced, crd full,
storied and stored as the ripe honeycomb
with other faith than this. As of sole pride
and holy loneliness, the intrinsic face
worn by the always changing shape between
end and beginning, birth and death.
How moves that line of daring on the map?
Where was it yesterday, or where this morning
when thunder struck at seven, and in the bay
the meteor made its dive, and shed its wings,
and with them one more Icarus? Where struck
that lightning-stroke which in your sleep you saw
wrinkling across the eyelid? Somewhere else?
But somewhere else is always here and now.
Each moment crawls that lightning on your eyelid:
each moment you must die. It was a tree
that this time died for you: it was a rock
and with it all its local web of love:
a chimney, spilling down historic bricks:
perhaps a skyful of Ben Franklin's kites.
And with them, us. For we must hear and bear
the news from everywhere: the hourly news,
infinitesimal or vast, from everywhere.

III

Sole pride and loneliness: it is the state
the kingdom rather of all things: we hear
news of the heart in weather of the Bear,
slide down the rungs of Cassiopeia's Chair,
still on the nursery floor, the Milky Way;
and, if we question one, must question all.
What is this ‘man'? How far from him is ‘me'?
Who, in this conch-shell, locked the sound of sea?
We are the tree, yet sit beneath the tree,
among the leaves we are the hidden bird,
we are the singer and are what is heard.
What is this ‘world'? Not Li Po's Gorge alone,
and yet, this too might be. ‘The wind was high
north of the White King City, by the fields
of whistling barley under cuckoo sky,'
where, as the silkworm drew her silk, Li Po
spun out his thoughts of us. ‘Endless as silk'
(he said) ‘these poems for lost loves, and us,'
and, ‘for the peachtree, blooming in the ditch.'
Here is the divine loneliness in which
we greet, only to doubt, a voice, a word,
the smoke of a sweetfern after frost, a face
touched, and loved, but still unknown, and then
a body, still mysterious in embrace.
Taste lost as touch is lost, only to leave
dust on the doorsill or an ink-stained sleeve:
and yet, for the inadmissible, to grieve.
Of leaf and love, at last, only to doubt:
from world within or world without, kept out.
 
IV

Caucus of robins on an alien shore
as of the Ho-Ho birds at Jewel Gate
southward bound and who knows where and never late
or lost in a roar at sea. Rovers of chaos
each one the ‘Rover of Chao,' whose slight bones
shall put to shame the swords. We fly with these,
have always flown, and they
stay with us here, stand still and stay,
while, exiled in the Land of Pa, Li Po
still at the Wine Spring stoops to drink the moon.
And northward now, for fall gives way to spring,
from Sandy Hook and Kitty Hawk they wing,
and he remembers, with the pipes and flutes,
drunk with joy, bewildered by the chance
that brought a friend, and friendship, how, in vain,
he strove to speak, ‘and in long sentences,' his pain.
Exiled are we. Were exiles born. The ‘far away,'
language of desert, language of ocean, language of sky,
as of the unfathomable worlds that lie
between the apple and the eye,
these are the only words we learn to say.
Each morning we devour the unknown. Each day
we find, and take, and spill, or spend, or lose,
a sunflower splendor of which none knows the source.
This cornucopia of air! This very heaven
of simple day! We do not know, can never know,
the alphabet to find us entrance there.
So, in the street, we stand and stare,
to greet a friend, and shake his hand,
yet know him beyond knowledge, like ourselves;
ocean unknowable by unknowable sand.

V

The locust tree spills sequins of pale gold
in spiral nebulae, borne on the Invisible
earthward and deathward, but in change to find
the cycles to new birth, new life. Li Po
allowed his autumn thoughts like these to flow,
and, from the Gorge, sends word of Chouang's dream.
Did Chouang dream he was a butterfly?
Or did the butterfly dream Chouang? If so,
why then all things can change, and change again,
the sea to brook, the brook to sea, and we
from man to butterfly; and back to man.
This 'I,' this moving ‘I,' this focal ‘I,'
which changes, when it dreams the butterfly,
into the thing it dreams of; liquid eye
in which the thing takes shape, but from within
as well as from without: this liquid ‘I':
how many guises, and disguises, this
nimblest of actors takes, how many names
puts on and off, the costumes worn but once,
hero or poet, father or friend,
suiting the eloquence to the moment's end;
childlike, or bestial; the language of the kiss
sensual or simple; and the gestures, too,
as slight as that with which an empire falls,
or a great love's abjured; these feignings, sleights,
savants, or saints, or fly-by-nights,
the novice in her cell, or wearing tights
on the high wire above a hell of lights:
what's true in these, or false? which is the ‘I'
of 'I's'? Is it the master of the cadence, who
transforms all things to a hoop of flame, where through
tigers of meaning leap? And are these true,
the language never old and never new,
such as the world wears on its wedding day,
the something borrowed with something chicory blue?
In every part we play, we play ourselves;
even the secret doubt to which we come
beneath the changing shapes of self and thing,
yes, even this, at last, if we should call
and dare to name it, we would find
the only voice that answers is our own.
We are once more defrauded by the mind.

Defrauded? No. It is the alchemy by which we grow.
It is the self becoming word, the word
becoming world. And with each part we play
we add to cosmic Sum and cosmic sum.
Who knows but one day we shall find,
hidden in the prism at the rainbow's foot,
the square root of the eccentric absolute,
and the concentric absolute to come. 

VI

The thousand eyes, the Argus ‘I's' of love,
of these it was, in verse, that Li Po wove
the magic cloak for his last going forth,
into the Gorge for his adventure north.
What is not seen or said? The cloak of words
loves all, says all, sends back the word
whether from Green Spring, and the yellow bird
'that sings unceasing on the banks of Kiang,'
or 'from the Green Moss Path, that winds and winds,
nine turns for every hundred steps it winds,
up the Sword Parapet on the road to Shuh.'
‘Dead pinetrees hang head-foremost from the cliff.
The cataract roars downward. Boulders fall
Splitting the echoes from the mountain wall.
No voice, save when the nameless birds complain,
in stunted trees, female echoing male;
or, in the moonlight, the lost cuckoo's cry,
piercing the traveller's heart. Wayfarer from afar,
why are you here? what brings you here? why here?'

VII

Why here. Nor can we say why here. The peachtree bough
scrapes on the wall at midnight, the west wind
sculptures the wall of fog that slides
seaward, over the Gulf Stream.
                                                      The rat 
comes through the wainscot, brings to his larder
the twinned acorn and chestnut burr. Our sleep
lights for a moment into dream, the eyes
turn under eyelids for a scene, a scene,
o and the music, too, of landscape lost.
And yet, not lost. For here savannahs wave
cressets of pampas, and the kingfisher
binds all that gold with blue.
                                                 Why here? why here?
Why does the dream keep only this, just this C?
Yes, as the poem or the music do?

The timelessness of time takes form in rhyme:
the lotus and the locust tree rehearse
a four-form song, the quatrain of the year:
not in the clock's chime only do we hear
the passing of the Now into the past,
the passing into future of the Now:
hut in the alteration of the bough
time becomes visible, becomes audible,
becomes the poem and the music too:
time becomes still, time becomes time, in rhyme.
Thus, in the Court of Aloes, Lady Yang
called the musicians from the Pear Tree Garden,
called for Li Po, in order that the spring,
tree-peony spring, might so be made immortal.
Li Po, brought drunk to court, took up his brush,
but washed his face among the lilies first,
then wrote the song of Lady Flying Swallow:
which Hsuang Sung, the emperor, forthwith played,
moving quick fingers on a flute of jade.
Who will forget that afternoon? Still, still,
the singer holds his phrase, the rising moon
remains unrisen. Even the fountain's falling blade
hangs in the air unbroken, and says: Wait!

VIII

Text into text, text out of text. Pretext
for scholars or for scholiasts. The living word
springs from the dying, as leaves in spring
spring from dead leaves, our birth from death.
And all is text, is holy text. Sheepfold Hill
becomes its name for us, anti yet is still
unnamed, unnamable, a book of trees
before it was a book for men or sheep,
before it was a book for words. Words, words,
for it is scarlet now, and brown, and red,
and yellow where the birches have not shed,
where, in another week, the rocks will show.
And in this marriage of text and thing how can we know
where most the meaning lies? We climb the hill
through bullbriar thicket and the wild rose, climb
past poverty-grass and the sweet-scented bay
scaring the pheasant from his wall, but can we say
that it is only these, through these, we climb,
or through the words, the cadence, and the rhyme?
Chang Hsu, calligrapher of great renown,
needed to put but his three cupfuls down
to tip his brush with lightning. On the scroll,
wreaths of cloud rolled left and right, the sky
opened upon Forever. Which is which?
The poem? Or the peachtree in the ditch?
Or is all one? Yes, all is text, the immortal text,
Sheepfold Hill the poem, the poem Sheepfold Hill,
and we, Li Po, the man who sings, sings as he climbs,
transposing rhymes to rocks and rocks to rhymes.
The man who sings. What is this man who sings?
And finds this dedicated use for breath
for phrase and periphrase of praise between
the twin indignities of birth and death?
Li Yung, the master of the epitaph,
forgetting about meaning, who himself
had added 'meaning' to the book of >things,'
lies who knows where, himself sans epitaph,
his text, too, lost, forever lost . 
                                                        And yet, no,
text lost and poet lost, these only flow
into that other text that knows no year.
The peachtree in the poem is still here.
The song is in the peachtree and the ear.

IX

The winds of doctrine blow both ways at once.
The wetted finger feels the wind each way,
presaging plums from north, and snow from south.
The dust-wind whistles from the eastern sea
to dry the nectarine and parch the mouth.
The west wind from the desert wreathes the rain
too late to fill our wells, but soon enough,
the four-day rain that bears the leaves away.
Song with the wind will change, but is still song
and pierces to the rightness in the wrong
or makes the wrong a rightness, a delight.
Where are the eager guests that yesterday
thronged at the gate? Like leaves, they could not stay,
the winds of doctrine blew their minds away,
and we shall have no loving-cup tonight.
No loving-cup: for not ourselves are here
to entertain us in that outer year,
where, so they say, we see the Greater Earth.
The winds of doctrine blow our minds away,
and we are absent till another birth.

X

Beyond the Sugar Loaf, in the far wood,
under the four-day rain, gunshot is heard
and with the falling leaf the falling bird
flutters her crimson at the huntsman's foot.
Life looks down at death, death looks up at life,
the eyes exchange the secret under rain,
rain all the way from heaven: and all three
know and are known, share and are shared, a silent
moment of union and communion.
Have we come
this way before, and at some other time?
Is it the Wind Wheel Circle we have come?
We know the eye of death, and in it too
the eye of god, that closes as in sleep,
giving its light, giving its life, away:
clouding itself as consciousness from pain,
clouding itself, and then, the shutter shut.
And will this eye of god awake again?
Or is this what he loses, loses once,
but always loses, and forever lost?
It is the always and unredeemable cost
of his invention, his fatigue. The eye
closes, and no other takes its place.
It is the end of god, each time, each time.

Yet, though the leaves must fall, the galaxies
rattle, detach, and fall, each to his own
perplexed and individual death, Lady Yang
gone with the inkberry's vermilion stalk,
the peony face behind a fan of frost,
the blue-moon eyebrow behind a fan of rain,
beyond recall by any alchemist
or incantation from the Book of Change:
unresumable, as, on Sheepfold Hill,
the fir cone of a thousand years ago:
still, in the loving, and the saying so,
as when we name the hill, and, with the name,
bestow an essence, and a meaning, too:
do we endow them with our lives?
They move
into another orbit: into a time
not theirs: and we become the bell to speak
this time: as we become new eyes
with which they see, the voice
in which they find duration, short or long,
the chthonic and hermetic song.
Beyond Sheepfold Hill,
gunshot again, the bird flies forth to meet
predestined death, to look with conscious sight
into the eye of light
the light unflinching that understands and loves.
And Sheepfold Hill accepts them, and is still.

XI

The landscape and the language are the same.
And we ourselves are language and are land,
together grew with Sheepfold Hill, rock, and hand,
and mind, all taking substance in a thought
wrought out of mystery: birdflight and air
predestined from the first to be a pair:
as, in the atom, the living rhyme
invented her divisions, which in time,
and in the terms of time, would make and break
the text, the texture, and then all remake.
This powerful mind that can by thinking take
the order of the world and all remake,
will it, for joy in breaking, break instead
its own deep thought that thought itself be dead?
Already in our coil of rock and hand,
hidden in the cloud of mind, burning, fading,
under the waters, in the eyes of sand,
was that which in its time would understand.
Already in the Kingdom of the Dead
the scrolls were waiting for the names and dates
and what would there irrevocably be said.
The brush was in the hand, the poem was in the love,
the praise was in the word. The ‘Book of Lives'
listed the name, Li Po, as an Immortal;
and it was time to travel. Not, this year,
north to the Damask City, or the Gorge,
but, by the phoenix borne, swift as the wind,
to the Jade Palace Portal. There
look through the clouded to the clear
and there watch evil like a brush-stroke disappear
in the last perfect rhyme
of the begin-all-end-all poem, time.

XII

Northwest by north. The grasshopper weathervane
bares to the moon his golden breastplate, swings
in his predicted circle, gilded legs and wings
bright with frost, predicting frost. The tide
scales with moon-silver, floods the marsh, fulfils
Payne Creek and Quivett Creek, rises to lift
the fishing-boats against a jetty wall;
and past them floods the plankton and the weed
and limp sea-lettuce for the horseshoe crab
who sleeps till daybreak in his nest of reed.
The hour is open as the mind is open.
Closed as the mind is closed. Opens as the hand opens
to receive the ghostly snowflakes of the moon, closes
to feel the sunbeams of the bloodstream warm
our human inheritance of touch. The air tonight
brings back, to the all-remembering world, its ghosts,
borne from the Great Year on the Wind Wheel Circle.
On that invisible wave we lift, we too,
and drag at secret moorings,
stirred by the ancient currents that gave us birth.
And they are here, Li Po and all the others,
our fathers and our mothers: the dead leaf's footstep
touches the grass: those who were lost at sea
and those the innocents the too-soon dead:
                                                                             all mankind
and all it ever knew is here in-gathered,
held in our hands, and in the wind
breathed by the pines on Sheepfold Hill.
How still the Quaker Graveyard, the Meeting House
how still, where Cousin Abiel, on a night like this,
now long since dead, but then how young,
how young, scuffing among the dead leaves after frost
looked up and saw the Wine Star, listened and heard
borne from all quarters the Wind Wheel Circle word:
the father within him, the mother within him, the self
coming to self through love of each for each.
In this small mute democracy of stones
is it Abiel or Li Po who lies
and lends us against death our speech?
They are the same, and it is both who teach.
The poets and the prophecies are ours:
and these are with us as we turn, in turn,
the leaves of love that fill the Book of Change. 

October Ih, 
My friend, dear friend, why should I hear your voice
Over the Babel of voices, suddenly 
Calling as from the new world to the old? 
Hush!—are you weary? would you follow me? 
Would you make dark the house, and shut the door,
Summon steam-pacing trains, wave-racing ships, 
To bear you past the high assembled nations— 
Past the loud cries, the plucking hands of the age— 
Even to the East that drowses on her throne?

Come then—it's good to be alive today; 
For yesterday is dead, and dim tomorrow
Flits like a ghost before us, threatening 
Our peering eyes with mistily flapping wings. 
Grandly the streets loom upward; huge skyscrapers
Catch at the glory of the sunrise, wear 
The morning like a mantle, bare their heads 
In praise and prayer. And with us on the pavement, 
Above us in the air there, and below, 
Under our feet, by train and tram and subway, 
The people bear the burden of the age— 
Each to his work, each to his love, his dream, 
The little secret vision of his soul, 
Veiled, muffled, trampled, baffled, but agleam: 
Our people, eager to work, eager to laugh, 
Eager to love—if but to love were easy, 
Pausing not for the slow and difficult thing 
As they push past their neighbors to the goal. 

Now to the ship—down the long crowded wharves,
The tangle of souls and voices threading thinly 
Through the slight gangway. Do you see her there— 
Huge, black, incredible, fortress-walled in steel,
Hiding her heart of fire? She has no fear; 
The fierce waves leap at her, the arrogant storms
Tease at her flying heels, the boastful winds 
Front her in vain. Superb, invincible, 
From world to world, over the ravenous ocean 
Grandly she bears the fruitage of the time: 
Rich fields of corn, mill-yields of goods, long train-loads 
Of strong machines, man's hope and love and power
Sealed in a million letters, and at last 
Even us, the little human mustard seeds— 
Dark earth-specks with the kingdom of heaven within.

Gaily we tread the deck, softly we sleep, 
Lightly we chatter away the idle days, 
While strong hands, from dark hold to sunny mast,
Do our enormous tasks. And now at last 
The world again, low chalky cliffs, the shore, 
Parked England silvery green, her viny casements 
And dewy lawns, her iron towns of toil 
Smoke-bound, unfree. And London, stony London,
Gray storehouse of the heaped-up centuries, 
Of hidden sins and valors, locked-in joys; 
London the empire-hearted, grave with cares 
Under her tawny sky that dulls the sun.

We linger not—swiftly the new age runs 
And he must haste who takes her by the hand. 
Over the Channel! Come! the little houses 
And patchwork fields of France. Paris fullblown, 
The red red rose of the world, whose golden heart 
Lies bare to the greedy sun, whose petals droop
Ever so softly to the falling time, 
Most lovely at the signal hour of change. 
Germany then, the little patterned cities 
Of the old time swept, garnished for the new; 
The ancient halls hung with the ancient art, 
And musical with high-stringed orchestras 
Playing melodious prophecies; gay Berlin, 
Garish, unmellowed, pale, but full of hope, 
And proud desire. 

Ah whither do they march, 
These nations with the sweat upon their brows, 
Huge burden-bearers, panoplied in steel, 
Facing bleak mists of doubt? Will they cast 
down Their heavy fears and bathe their brows in light
And freely run across the fields of dawn— 
Children of joy, blood brothers born in love, 
Valiant for peace as once for murderous war? 
Nearer they draw, trimly the sharp rails cut 
Their boundaries—twin scissor-blades of fate. 
Swift steamers tie their ports together, bring 
Tourist ambassadors from state to state. 
Bold man-birds fly through the unsentineled air, 
And cobweb wires invisible, more strong 
Than chains of steel, are spun from tower to tower,
Bridging the oceans, linking capitals, 
Binding men's hearts. O kings of the peopled earth,
O men, rulers of kings, dare you resist 
Warriors of science, who are blazing trails 
Your statesmenship must travel to new goals? 
Laggards, beware lest the advancing myriads, 
Bound for the promised land, trample you down!

Dark Russia, standing at the Asian gate, 
Questions us with her eastward-peering eyes. 
Proud Moscow from her hundred towers looks out—
Moscow, bejeweled with domes, magnificent, 
Out of her past barbaric gazes far 
Into the future, swings her Kremlin portal 
To show the sad Siberian wilderness, 
And bids us follow through the autumnal days. 
Softly we slip along the garnered fields, 
Past clustered villages, low-thatched and brown, 
Each with a gay church gilded; shimmer down 
The shining Urals, and salute at last 
Great Asia where in solitude she waits 
Under the northern star. 

Her forest then, 
Level and low; dark little pines, thin birches 
Their leaves all golden on the silver stems. 
And square-faced peasants crowding to the train,
Slow, sleepy-eyed, thick-bearded. Onward still 
Through the stark plains; Baikal blue in its mountains,
The home of wheeling birds that dive and soar. 
And by and by a dragon-guarded roof 
With gay beasts perched along its tips, that lift 
Like the slim corner of a pale new moon 
Poised in the sky at sunset. 

We have come
To the first gate of the world. The still Pacific
Glitters between the hills. Dark crowds astare
Greet us with chatter and laughter—beardless men
With shaven brows and long thin tasseled braids,
Clad in dim blue under the darkening sun.
The obliterating night curtains our eyes,
And when at last the red dawn draws the veil
A heavy wall looms over us gray and stern
With towered gates fortress-guarded. And our engine,
Steaming and shrieking past the caravans—
The shaggy ponies, little loaded asses,
The slow process camels pacing down—
Scatters the dust of time, pierces the wall,
And pauses under the shadow of yellow roofs
Where the Forbidden City, wide and still,
Lies dreaming in her sunrise-slanted woods.

Peking! She faces us with marble eyes
Inscrutable. She hearkens to our noise
And guards her secret. Shall we win her over—
We with our guns, our dark machines, our mansions
High piled over her lowly curving roofs;
We with our loud commands? Will she arise, 
Weary of silence, wave her yellow flag,
Summon her myriads for the modern race,
The huge new tasks, the war for love and light?
Hush! If we wait and listen, will she speak,

Softly! No steamer, elbowing storms aside,
No engine nosing through the ancient wall,
No hurrying foot, no soul worn or at war,
Shall penetrate the Circle and the Square,
Set with sweet woods, the green wall and the blue,
And touch the three rings of the Temple of Heaven,
The terraced marble seat, cloud-carved and fair, 
Where, at the Centre of the Earth, in peace,
The tranquil East, contemplative, serene,
Dwells with the sun and moon.

Hush—bare your head
And strip your spirit free. When you have won
The ultimate Wisdom, seek the winged portal
Once more. Then she, the sage, may rise to you,
Hold converse with you, pilgrim of the age,
And take you to her heart and bless your gifts,
And be as one with you forevermore.(To Robert Graves) 

I 

Here I'm sitting in the gloom 
Of my quiet attic room. 
France goes rolling all around, 
Fledged with forest May has crowned. 
And I puff my pipe, calm-hearted, 
Thinking how the fighting started, 
Wondering when we'll ever end it, 
Back to hell with Kaiser sent it, 
Gag the noise, pack up and go, 
Clockwork soldiers in a row. 
I've got better things to do 
Than to waste my time on you. 

II 

Robert, when I drowse to-night, 
Skirting lawns of sleep to chase 
Shifting dreams in mazy light, 
Somewhere then I'll see your face 
Turning back to bid me follow 
Where I wag my arms and hollo, 
Over hedges hasting after 
Crooked smile and baffling laughter, 
Running tireless, floating, leaping, 
Down your web-hung woods and valleys, 
Where the glowworm stars are peeping, 
Till I find you, quiet as stone 
On a hill-top all alone, 
Staring outward, gravely pondering 
Jumbled leagues of hillock-wandering. 

III 

You and I have walked together 
In the starving winter weather. 
We've been glad because we knew 
Time's too short and friends are few. 
We've been sad because we missed 
One whose yellow head was kissed 
By the gods, who thought about him 
Till they couldn't do without him. 
Now he's here again; I've been 
Soldier David dressed in green, 
Standing in a wood that swings 
To the madrigal he sings. 
He's come back, all mirth and glory, 
Like the prince in a fairy tory. 
Winter called him far away; 
Blossoms bring him home with May. 

IV 

Well, I know you'll swear it's true 
That you found him decked in blue 
Striding up through morning-land 
With a cloud on either hand. 
Out in Wales, you'll say, he marches 
Arm-in-arm with aoks and larches; 
Hides all night in hilly nooks, 
Laughs at dawn in tumbling brooks. 
Yet, it's certain, here he teaches 
Outpost-schemes to groups of beeches. 
And I'm sure, as here I stand, 
That he shines through every land, 
That he sings in every place 
Where we're thinking of his face. 

V 

Robert, there's a war in France; 
Everywhere men bang and blunder, 
Sweat and swear and worship Chance, 
Creep and blink through cannon thunder. 
Rifles crack and bullets flick, 
Sing and hum like hornet-swarms. 
Bones are smashed and buried quick. 
Yet, through stunning battle storms, 
All the while I watch the spark 
Lit to guide me; for I know 
Dreams will triumph, though the dark 
Scowls above me where I go. 
You can hear me; you can mingle 
Radiant folly with my jingle. 
War's a joke for me and you 
While we know such dreams are true

Dawn comes later and later now,   
and I, who only a month ago
could sit with coffee every morning   
watching the light walk down the hill   
to the edge of the pond and place   
a doe there, shyly drinking,

then see the light step out upon   
the water, sowing reflections   
to either side—a garden
of trees that grew as if by magic—
now see no more than my face,   
mirrored by darkness, pale and odd,

startled by time. While I slept,   
night in its thick winter jacket   
bridled the doe with a twist
of wet leaves and led her away,
then brought its black horse with harness   
that creaked like a cricket, and turned

the water garden under. I woke,   
and at the waiting window found   
the curtains open to my open face;   
beyond me, darkness. And I,
who only wished to keep looking out,   
must now keep looking in. 

Yellow foliage fallen on my hands
Remind me, they once were green
Reminisce me of our beautiful time
Standing here, witnessing running days
Flying and leaving that moment away
So soon days changing another season, 
But I know our time wont be faded away
Even it only just golden past days

Encarved smiles by those memories
Haunting clock ticking, bringing old times, 
Staying alive, In a distance of silence
Presently living between our breaths
Far by the oceans, across the lands
Two minds bind to different poles of hearts
Between us, joining two souls, you and me
The only junction connecting us over the sea
Maybe i am the only one who counting
Upon the days till you are here to return
Chasing the time toward the end
To end the season of waiting

Since you been gone, 
Day by day I'm living with the sky
Looking the same sun, hope it warming you
Staring the moon bright, hope it shelters your night
Your last promise to return, I am undone the last bye
I shall await, await for your shadow to tell me you're back
But spring has losing it flowers, and leaves about to leave
Evening breeze of autumn, I still living with the sunset sky
It could be another day of waiting, but i am loyal to stay
So in each breathe i take in, my soul write my words
Chaining word by word, embroidered with my prayers
A single hush flying with a letter from my all
Swifting free, those are my letters in the wind

Wandering in this shared world atmosphere
Bird singing over the melodies, tunes of harmony
Singing verses of secret letter hidden in the wind
Encompassed by your magnetic heart, it will find
From a single hush traveled to be in your breathing
May it'll be revealed when reach to heart then your mind
A letter to words then completing the meaning
Binding to your mind of what i am here telling
My whispering soul to you, if you wondering

Below the stars, the shining sparks
Sometimes i feel someone is remembering me
Could it be a reply for me, my letter in the wind? 
Take nothing for granted, the only thing i honestly mean
Only praying for you having all great life and things
Maybe this waiting is not going to end
But my prayers will never stop to send
And the letters will be continuously written
In each of my breathing, every second
Till the last breath of my life

Stand here, watching how green turn yellow
and that's how it was our beautiful time
For life has time with mystery flow
Remind you never be low, just go
Trust all things within you
Be strong whatever you do
I am not be there but the wind will
Carrying a letter for you
from me till end of my time

There will always be something wrong today; 
That might have been right yesterday, 
But who are we to decide what is wrong and right, 
For today or any other day or night? 

Sure there will always be the good old days, 
And as sure as these days will be old, we too must change our ways.
Maybe when these days are ild we will find something good
About them, for all good things are worth the wait; Dude.

We have internet and superfast communication, 
But do we gain better wisdom from having more information? 
We know what is causing AIDS yet still the statistics rise.
Are we overwhelmed by what we know or is it all a surprise? 

I come not to offer a quick and convenient fix
To the present problems, I'm just adding a few idioms to the mix.
Idiom, sounds a lot like idiot; especially to the idiot who might
Be thinking that idioms are old, so let me set him aright: 

I wrote a letter to a friend the other day, 
It took three days to reach her but I at least said everything I had to say.
Now I could easily have called her in three minutes then
End up paying three times the amount for fewer words than my pen.
 
So which is the easier way? 
The quick, pocket pinching convenience of today, 
Or the slow satisfaction that was and is still available? 
Hear my voice through pen and paper, Or touch my words through a cable. 

You reign above each one I know with the love I will forever bear
The love of thanks and admiration from the depths of a heart that carries life twelve years too late.
If comfort, strength and inspiration come from heaven, then you ny friend, are an angel
'Friend', such a word that carries not few enough meanings - these meanings of which in circumstance we can not agree.
'Friend', I sit and question in the darkness of light.  

the lightness of day.  but still will see, will hope, will make believe much more than your practical theory - the truth
I understand but cannot accept the locks and bars of professionalism.
I long not for the games, but the closeness of a companionship with the one who understands my dreams, and is a constant reminder of who I want to be.
Friends shake their heads, they say I've changed.
I though, am nodding, and I raise my hand to a teacher as a student always should, not stepping out of line, not calling out loud.
write by james


The past is like a story
I have listened to in dreams
That vanished in the glory
Of the Morning's early gleams;
And--at my shadow glancing--
I feel a loss of strength,
As the Day of Life advancing
Leaves it shorn of half its length.

But it's all in vain to worry
At the rapid race of Time--
And he flies in such a flurry
When I trip him with a rhyme,
I'll bother him no longer
Than to thank you for the thought
That 'my fame is growing stronger
As you really think it ought.'

And though I fall below it,
I might know as much of mirth
To live and die a poet
Of unacknowledged worth;
For Fame is but a vagrant--
Though a loyal one and brave,
And his laurels ne'er so fragrant
As when scattered o'er the grave. 

Sir, since the last Elizabethan died,
     Or, rather, that more Paradisal muse,
     Blind with much light, passed to the light more glorious
     Or deeper blindness, no man's hand, as thine,
     Has, on the world's most noblest chord of song,
     Struck certain magic strains.  Ears satiate
     With the clamorous, timorous whisperings of to-day,
     Thrilled to perceive once more the spacious voice
     And serene unterrance of old.  We heard
     -- With rapturous breath half-held, as a dreamer dreams
     Who dares not know it dreaming, lest he wake --
     The odorous, amorous style of poetry,
     The melancholy knocking of those lines,
     The long, low soughing of pentameters,
     -- Or the sharp of rhyme as a bird's cry --
     And the innumerable truant polysyllables
     Multitudinously twittering like a bee.
     Fulfilled our hearts were with the music then,
     And all the evenings sighed it to the dawn,
     And all the lovers heard it from all the trees.
     All of the accents upon the all the norms!
     -- And ah! the stress of the penultimate!
     We never knew blank verse could have such feet.

     Where is it now?  Oh, more than ever, now
     I sometimes think no poetry is read
     Save where some sepultured C¾sura bled,
     Royally incarnadining all the line.
     Is the imperial iamb laid to rest,
     And the young trochee, having done enough?
     Ah! turn again! Sing so to us, who are sick
     Of seeming-simple rhymes, bizarre emotions,
     Decked in the simple verses of the day,
     Infinite meaning in a little gloom,
     Irregular thoughts in stanzas regular,
     Modern despair in antique metres, myths
     Incomprehensible at evening,
     And symbols that mean nothing in the dawn.
     The slow lines swell. The new style sighs. The Celt
     Moans round with many voices.
     Gaunt anap¾sts stand up out of the verse,
     Combative accents, stress where no stress should be,
     Spondee on spondee, iamb on choriamb,
     The thrill of all the tribrachs in the world,
     And all the vowels rising to the E!
     To hear the blessed mutter of those verbs,
     Conjunctions passionate toward each other's arms,
     And epithets like amaranthine lovers
     Stretching luxuriously to the stars,
     All prouder pronouns than the dawn, and all
     The thunder of the trumpets of the noun

Apu
Can you hear me? 
Long years have elapsed
 
Your call aroused me from my sleep

Can you see me
I have crossed over
To the other side of the border.  

Oh, our days were so jolly
The Kash flowers, so lovely
So tasty, tamarind jelly.

How adventurous we were? 
Have we not seen the train? 
Have we traveled 
in that train? 
Yes, yes
We have traveled to Mars
Where water is found
Under layers of ice
We can melt the ice
And bring water to surface

Yes, life is possible
As ice will again become liquid
And we
Can bring life
To our land
Yes Apu, 
We have really traveled
On the train.


With love
From Didi


This to the Crown, and blessing of my life,
The much lov'd husband, of a happy wife.
To him, whose constant passion found the art
To win a stubborn, and ungratefull heart;
And to the World, by tend'rest proof discovers
They err, who say that husbands can't be lovers.
With such return of passion, as is due,
Daphnis I love, Daphnis my thoughts persue,
Daphnis, my hopes, my joys, are bounded all in you:
Ev'n I, for Daphnis, and my promise sake,
What I in women censure, undertake.
But this from love, not vanity, proceeds;
You know who writes; and I who 'tis that reads.
Judge not my passion, by my want of skill,
Many love well, though they express itt ill;
And I your censure cou'd with pleasure bear,
Wou'd you but soon return, and speak itt here. 

Quid facis Arctoi charissime transfuga coeli,
Ingele, proh sero cognite, rapte cito?
Num satis Hybernum defendis pellibus Astrum,
Qui modo tam mollis nec bene firmus eras?
Quae Gentes Hominum, quae sit Natura Locorum,
Sint Homines, potius dic ibi sintre Loca?
Num gravis horrisono Polus obruit omnia lapsu,
Jungitur & praeceps Mundas utraque nive?
An melius canis horrescit Campus Aristis,
Amuius Agricolis & redit Orbe labor?
Incolit, ut fertur, saevam Gens mitior Oram,
Pace vigil, Bello strenua, justa Foro.
Quin ibi sunt Urbes, atque alta Palatia Regum,
Musarumque domus, & sua Templa Deo.
Et dare jura potest regia Virgo viris.
Utque trahit rigidum Magnes Aquilone Metallum,
Gandet eam Soboles ferrea sponte sequii.
Dic quantum liceat fallaci credere Famae,
Invida num taceat plura, sonet ve loquax.
At, si vera fides, Mundi melioris ab ortu,
Ipsa licet redeat (nostri decus orbis) Eliza,


Vidimus Effigiem, mistasque Coloribus Umbras:
Sic quoque Sceptripotens, sic quoque visa Dea.
Augustam decorant (raro concordia) frontem
Majestas & Amor, Forma Pudorque simul.
Ingens Virgineo spirat Gustavus in ore:
Agnoscas animos, fulmineumque Patrem.
Nulla suo nituit tam lucida Stella sub Axe;
Non Ea quae meruit Crimine Nympha Polum.
Ah quoties pavidum demisit conscia Lumen,
Utque suae timuit Parrhasis Ora Deae!
Et, simulet falsa ni Pictor imagine Vultus,
Delia tam similis nec fuit ipsa sibi.
Ni quod inornati Triviae sint forte Capilli,
Sollicita sed buic distribuantur Acu.
Scilicet ut nemo est illa reverentior aequi;
Haud ipsas igitur fert sine Lege Comas.
Gloria sylvarum pariter communis utrique
Est, & perpetuae Virginitatis Honos.
Sic quoque Nympharum supereminet Agmina collo,
Fertque Choros Cynthi per Juga, per Nives.
Haud aliter pariles Ciliorum contrahit Arcus
Acribus ast Oculis tela subesse putes.
Luminibus dubites an straverit illa Sagittis
Quae foret exuviis ardua colla Feram.
Alcides humeros coopertus pelle Nemaea
Haud ita labentis sustulit Orbis Onus.
Heu quae Cervices subnectunt Pectora tales.
Frigidiora Gelu, candidiora Nive.
Caetera non licuit, sed vix ea tota, videre;
Nam chau fi rigido stant Adamante Sinus.
Seu chlamys Artifici nimium succurrerit auso,
Sicque imperfectum fugerit impar Opus:
Sive tribus spernat Victrix certare Deabus,
Et pretium formae nec spoliata ferat.
Junonis properans & clara Trophaea Minervae;
Mollia nam Veneris praemia nosse piget.
Hinc neque consuluit fugitivae prodiga Formae,
Nectimuit seris invigilasse Libris.
Insommem quoties Nymphae monuere sequaces
Decedet roseis heu color ille Genis.
Jamque vigil leni cessit Philomela sopori,
Omnibus & Sylvis conticuere Ferae.


Tanti est doctorum volvere scripta Virum.
Et liciti quae sint moderamina discere Regni,
Quid fuerit, quid sit, noscere quicquid erit.
Sic quod in ingenuas Gothus peccaverit Artes
Vindicat, & studiis expiat Una suis.
Exemplum dociles imitantur nobile Gentes,
Et geminis Infans imbuit Ora sonis.
Transpositos Suecis credas migrasse Latinos,
Carmine Romuleo sic strepit omne Nemus.
Upsala nec priscis impar memoratur Athenis,
Aegidaque & Currus hic sua Pallas habet.
Illinc O quales liceat sperasse Liquores,
Quum Dea praesideat fontibus ipsa sacris!
Illic Lacte ruant illic & flumina Melle,
Fulvaque inauratam tingat Arena Salam.
Upsalides Musae nunc & majora conemus,
Quaeque mihi Famae non levis Aura tulit.
Occultam gemina de meliore Notam.
Quemque tenet charo descriptum Nomine semper,
Non minus exculptum Pectore fida refert.
Sola haec virgineas depascit Flamma Medullas,
Et licito pergit solvere corda foco.
Unica nec Virgo Volsiniensis erit.
Discite nunc Reges (Majestas proxima coelo)
Discite proh magnos hinc coluisse Deos.
Ah pudeat Tanitos puerilia fingere coepta,
Nugas nescio quas, & male quaerere Opes.
Acer Equo cunctos dum praeterit illa Britanno,
Et pecoris spolium nescit inerme sequi.
Ast Aquilam poscit Germano pellere Nido,
Deque Palatino Monte fugare Lupam.
Vos etiam latos in praedam jungite Campos,
Impiaque arctatis cingite Lustra Plagis.
Victor Oliverus nudum Caput exerit Armis,
Ducere sive sequi nobile laetus Iter.
Spina cui canis floruit alba comis.
Ultima quos Boreae carcere Claustra premunt.
Aeoliis quales Venti fremuere sub antris,
Et tentant Montis corripuisse moras.
Hanc Dea si summa demiserit Arce procellam
Quam gravis Austriacis Hesperiisque cadat!
Omnia sed rediens olim narraveris Ipse;
Nec reditus spero tempora longa petit.
Non ibi lenta pigro stringuntur frigore Verba,
Solibus, & tandem Vere liquanda novo.
Sed radiis hyemem Regina potentior urit;
Haecque magis solvit, quam ligat illa Polum.
Dicitur & nostros moerens andisse Labores,
Fortis & ingenuam Gentis amasse Fidem.
Oblatae Batavam nec paci commodat Aurem;
Nec versat Danos insidiosa dolos.
Sed pia festinat mutatis Foedera rebus,
Et Libertatem quae dominatur amat.
Digna cui Salomon meritos retulisset honores,
Et Saba concretum Thure cremasset Iter.
Hanc tua, sed melius, celebraverit, Ingele, Musa;
Et labor est vestrae debitus ille Lyrae.
Nos sine te frustra Thamisis saliceta subimus,
Sparsaque per steriles Turba vagamur Agros.
Et male tentanti querulum respondet Avena:
Quin & Rogerio dissiluere fides.


Grataque speramus qualiacumque fore. 

Absent upon Public Employment 

My head, my heart, mine eyes, my life, nay more,
My joy, my magazine, of earthly store,
If two be one, as surely thou and I,
How stayest thou there, whilst I at Ipswich lie?
So many steps, head from the heart to sever,
If but a neck, soon should we be together.
I, like the Earth this season, mourn in black,
My Sun is gone so far in's zodiac,
Whom whilst I 'joyed, nor storms, nor frost I felt,
His warmth such fridged colds did cause to melt.
My chilled limbs now numbed lie forlorn;
Return; return, sweet Sol, from Capricorn;
In this dead time, alas, what can I more
Than view those fruits which through thy heart I bore?
Which sweet contentment yield me for a space,
True living pictures of their father's face.
O strange effect! now thou art southward gone,
I weary grow the tedious day so long;
But when thou northward to me shalt return,
I wish my Sun may never set, but burn
Within the Cancer of my glowing breast,
The welcome house of him my dearest guest.
Where ever, ever stay, and go not thence,
Till nature's sad decree shall call thee hence;
Flesh of thy flesh, bone of thy bone,
I here, thou there, yet both but one. 

It’s so silent in and around
All thinks it’s not my way
My pave leads me to my family
I will be silent till it breaks
I will keep mum if someone killed
I will be silent if a girl molested
I will escape if some riot breakup
I will be murmur if corruption occurs
I will protect mine if nature reacts	
I will vote and I will relax
I will work and I will earn
But I will entertain as I wish	 
I ‘am projected instead of us
I am in a circle of my’’ F’’
I need to live and I need to survive 
Rest is not my concern
I is the base and I is the downfall
Where need to build a WE, to be in a paradise
Come out of the shell and be in a society
So that will learn the sense of society
Or one day I’ will stand alone
And that will perish, 	
At the point will end this society
Be a human to be a human being




To you, my aunt, who would explore
The literary Chankley Bore,
The paths are hard, for you are not
A literary Hottentot
But just a kind and cultured dame
Who knows not Eliot (to her shame).
Fie on you, aunt, that you should see
No genius in David G.,
No elemental form and sound
In  

E. and Ezra Pound.
Fie on you, aunt! I'll show you how
To elevate your middle brow,
And how to scale and see the sights
From modernist Parnassian heights.

First buy a hat, no Paris model
But one the Swiss wear when they yodel,
A bowler thing with one or two
Feathers to conceal the view;
And then in sandals walk the street
(All modern painters use their feet
For painting, on their canvas strips,
Their wives or mothers, minus hips).

Perhaps it would be best if you
Created something very new,
A dirty novel done in Erse
Or written backwards in Welsh verse,
Or paintings on the backs of vests,
Or Sanskrit psalms on lepers' chests.
But if this proved imposs-i-ble
Perhaps it would be just as well,
For you could then write what you please,
And modern verse is done with ease.

Do not forget that 'limpet' rhymes
With 'strumpet' in these troubled times,
And commas are the worst of crimes;
Few understand the works of Cummings,
And few James Joyce's mental slummings,
And few young Auden's coded chatter;
But then it is the few that matter.
Never be lucid, never state,
If you would be regarded great,
The simplest thought or sentiment,
(For thought, we know, is decadent);
Never omit such vital words
As belly, genitals and -----,
For these are things that play a part
(And what a part) in all good art.
Remember this: each rose is wormy,
And every lovely woman's germy;
Remember this: that love depends
On how the Gallic letter bends;
Remember, too, that life is hell
And even heaven has a smell
Of putrefying angels who
Make deadly whoopee in the blue.
These things remembered, what can stop
A poet going to the top?

A final word: before you start
The convulsions of your art,
Remove your brains, take out your heart;
Minus these curses, you can be
A genius like David G.

Take courage, aunt, and send your stuff
To Geoffrey Grigson with my luff,
And may I yet live to admire
How well your poems light the fire. 

If I could write a letter to my Dad. 
I’d ask him, are you watching over me? 
Seeing through my eyes the life, I’ve had.
Translating all the worldly sights, I see.

If I could put a question to my Dad
I’d ask him are you always at my side
The centre of my soul is very sad
Starting from the day they said you died.

If I could put my arms around my Dad
I’d ask him how to bare the wrath of men
Who, acting in the name of a religion, 
kill without regret and  feed on mayhem.

If I could just but walk beside my Dad
I’d ask him, was it hard to leave this earth.
did he shed the cares of loosing all he had
as, thought fell dormant, waiting for rebirth.

If I could just remember my Dad.
One memory, no matter how small
Of a special time of bonding that we had
But I can’t, it’s like he never was at all.


(Roan Jan.I sit with an excuse, 
Which is of no use. 
How unfortunate I am today, 
For not being on your Big day. 

I remember the promise, 
And now with excuse. 
The word of present, 
Turned out absent. 

I know that you will forgive, 
For you will understand and give. 
By soul I am there, 
For reasons am here. 

I,  from the deepest, 
Breath of my own, intone longest. 
Curse that whore and other four, 
Who kept me away from today and many more. 

That trollop harlot of today, 
Would be punished someday. 
I regret for not being today, 
But thank for cursing her everyday. 

Dated: 




You raise my temperature, 
Honey.
Take me to a hot adventure, 
Honey.
Unzip my chest gently
observe my heart beat rapidly
And let me watch yours smile at me.
you raise my temperature, 
Honey.
I felt the heat writing this letter, 
Honey.
Till death do us apart
Honey, 
Let's keep this fire burning.

Your Loving Husband.

***The Book of Passion (Till death do us apart)Now that time has come; because we did together.
While oranges are oft good, and soon then be in name.
And if the moon becomes so large and pale then full.
So common though I be and you did come out, with me.
Remember that, the first red alley, darker still to come may be.
The second time once reversed, a lonely road, so long to me. 

Now that you have caught sight 
of the other side of darkness 
the invisible side 
so that you can tell 
it is rising 
first thing in the morning 
and know it is there 
all through the day

another sky 
clear and unseen 
has begun to loom 
in your words 
and another light is growing 
out of their shadows 
you can hear it

now you will be able 
to envisage beyond 
any words of mine 
the color of these leaves 
that you never saw 
awake above the still valley 
in the small hours 
under the moon 
three nights past the full

you know there was never 
a name for that color

From 'The Shadow Of Sirius'

Yes, you were born my friend without an aim.
The circled target board was created by you.
This is not wrong within this life, it's true.
Don't be frustrated, it is not a shame. 
Dream, Be ambitious-work- and don't be lame. 
Be happy, don't deprive yourself a shoe.
As long as it is something you can do. 
Don't blame yourself- We're humans it's a game.


The most important thing's your peace of mind.
Believe me, this will make you live and strive.
What is the life but to amuse and play? *
Search and you won't find something left behind.
You need to play the game to stay alive.
And wake to live and live another day.


(*)    The idea of this verse is extracted from the Holy Quran: 
(w ma al haiat al donya ela lae'eb w lahww)Sure of Success, to You I boldly write, 
Whilst Love do's ev'ry tender Line endite; 
Love, who is justly President of Verse, 
Which all his Servants write, or else rehearse. 
Phoebus (howe'er mistaken Poets dream)  
Ne'er us'd a Verse, till Love became his Theme. 
To his stray'd Son, still as his Passion rose, 
He rais'd his hasty Voice in clam'rous Prose: 
But when in Daphne he wou'd Love inspire, 
He woo'd in Verse, set to his silver Lyre. 

The Trojan Prince did pow'rful Numbers join 
To sing of War; but Love was the Design: 
And sleeping Troy again in Flames was drest, 
To light the Fires in pitying Dido's Breast. 


Love without Poetry's refining Aid 
Is a dull Bargain, and but coarsely made; 
Nor e'er cou'd Poetry successful prove, 
Or touch the Soul, but when the Sense was Love. 


Oh! cou'd they both in Absence now impart 
Skill to my Hand, but to describe my Heart; 
Then shou'd you see impatient of your Stay 
Soft Hopes contend with Fears of sad Delay; 
Love in a thousand fond Endearments there, 
And lively Images of You appear. 
But since the Thoughts of a Poetick Mind 
Will never be to Syllables confin'd; 
And whilst to fix what is conceiv'd, we try, 
The purer Parts evaporate and dye: 
You must perform what they want force to do, 
And think what your ARDELIA thinks of you. 

Hope this letter finds you seated
In your cosy little world
Where mere mortals are forbidden
And life is a pleasant dream

Do you ever feel guilty? 
Of your secret stash of money
Piled away in offshore accounts
Or you extravagant lifestyle
Private islands and swathes of land
With no trespass signs

Do you still have a human conscious? 
Embedded within your souls
Or you have evolved a robotic one
Devoid of human emotion
The roots of mankind

Why are you amassing so much? 
One house is good enough
But you are happy to own hundreds
Money, the root of all-evil
Is found in abundance in your homes

I have heard that you do Philanthropic works
Donating millions to charity
To soothe your dead conscious
But do you know that
The resources on earth
Are abundant for us all
If only, us mortals
Can share them
They will be no poverty
Diseases will be minimized
And more productive souls will live longer


Your late kind Gift let me restore;
For I must never wear it more.
My Mother cries, What's here to do?
A Crimson Velvet Cap for you!
If to these Heights so soon you climb,
You'll wear a Coachman's Cap in time:
Perhaps on Palfry pace along,
With ruffled Shirt, and Tete--Moutton;
Banish the Woman from your Face,
And let the Rake supply the Place;
Delighted see the People stare,
And ask each other what you are?

If she goes on to this dull Tune,
Poor I must be a Quaker soon.
She'll scarcely let me wear a Knot;
But keeps me like a Hottentot;
Says, Dressing plain, at small Expence,
Shews better Taste, and better Sense.
I'd take her Judgment, I confess,
Sooner in any Thing, than Dress;
A Science, which she little knows,
Who only huddles on her Cloaths.

This Day, to please my Brother Con.
She let me put your Present on;
And when she saw me very glad,
Cry'd out, She looks like one that's mad!
Know, Girl, (says she) that Affectation
Suits only those in higher Station;
Who plead Prescription for their Rule,
Whene'er they please to play the Fool:
But that it best becomes us Cits,
To dress like People in their Wits.''Dear Jack, whilst you thro' Flanders roam,
Can you forget your Friends at Home?
Say, will your Tutors give you Time
To write to Hereticks in Rhyme?
A Name they brand us with, dear Youth,
And we affirm they injure Truth.
The sacred Page before us lies,
Which you lock up from vulgar Eyes.
In vain to Men a Light is giv'n,
To point them out the Path to Heav'n;
If, lest their Sight should make them stray,
Their Guides alone must see the Way.

I fancy now you answer thus:
This serious Subject is unfit.
To exercise a School--boy's Wit;
Then talk of other Matters, Con.
Inform me how your Class goes on:
Are you, poor Boys! at School To--day,
Whilst others are allow'd to play?

Dear Jack, that is our Case, 'tls true;
We envy them, and envy you;
You, who may ramble from your Book,
To view the Towns Eugenio took;
Ev'n now, perhaps, attend the Story,
How Marlbro' won immortal Glory;
page 
Whilst he, who tells the wondrous Tale,
At ev'ry Period turning pale,
Still fancies Vengeance o'er his Head,
And asks you--Are you sure He's dead?

S.
I just heard happy News, dear Boy;
And Friendship bids me share the Joy:
Hibernia has not pray'd in vain;
Cyrus will visit her again;
Cyrus, long train'd in Wisdom's School,
And by Mandana form'd for Rule.
Ramsay, we find from whence you drew
Those Characters admir'd in you:
We Cassendana's Virtues trace,
And lovely Form in Weymouth's Race.

O would Mandana cross the Seas,
And hear a People speak her Praise,
With Britain vie to hail the Dame,
Who, Granville, could exalt thy Name,
Transmitting down thy Fame with Care,
And double Lustre, in her Heir

Does a man turn away from right and good
Brought to the fact of humility not being able to provide
Children crying day and night denied everyday necessities
A lack of pride in being a man among men
Perceived lazy by a society that never has been hungry	

Does man lack character, ethics, and moral stability
On dark cold chilling nights with no shelter or stillness
Caught up in a fight for mere  wake in the morning survival 
Things never perceived when childhood dreams were dreamed

When does enough become enough for you and I
How many go postal events or deaths in the streets
For the norm not to be normal in the sight of us all
Suffered long enough to bring suffering to an end
The level of misconception considered deeplymost woman to day are highly liberated lot, 
they no longer care to, wake up early and 
greet their hubbies with a cup of coffee, but 
expect hubbies to take lead in coffee et all.

they have abandoned the traditional sari, that is 
a marvel in design, concept, etiquette, comfort
that goes to show case them, beautiful and 
elegant what ever be their real form, color, height, 
weight et all and many formulations in wear.

jeans they wear are tight at the precious site, 
and showcase their butt to the actual contour, 
is a marvel, as to how they make jeans to such
perfection in size and seating, like Shakespeare 
had said  "a chair that fits buttocks of  all sizes".

such tight fitting at precious frontal site lead
to trouble in urinary tract, and may lead to
kidney, besides affects fertility in woman, .
it is amazing ladies in western countries wear, 
half skirt, sleeveless blouse in freezing cold
while their men wear full suite, tie and boots, 
that protects them from detrimental cold.

such exposure to earn a coveted quote on 
their, "sexuality" does last few seconds, while
those, in traditional saris stay excited for the
men when exposed up to their  heels, while 
exposed up to their knee, they go crazy, 
wild and delirious, . for any thing covered 
causes excitement and while those 
exposed bare, declines in excitement 
as  in "proximity leads to contempt".
 
beauty does not lie in exposure of vitals 
and chemicals, but in healthy body, mind, 
compassion, love  for family, elders, kids
and, colleagues, that reflects in them
as 'inner beauty', an instant hit with men.

the bridal make that woman plan days 
together, with lakhs spend, does not last
even a day as the groom seeks to remove 
it, earliest when the mighty sun calls it a day. 

physical attraction too does not last a day, 
as the the real test lies in their mutual 
understanding that depends on the "zing thing"
in woman, exclusive in them, like finger
prints that are dissimilar in any two.

woman today are still lucky, as men despite
their dominance in life and work, when back 
home and after a shower and dinner, attention
to kids seeks them out like a lazy pet, and falls 
back on their impressive bust, for love and 
comfort for the rest of the night with them.

if woman still want a highly liberated life, men
might go astray, with home shifted often, children
delivered and abandoned at locations, like in wild 
affected by vagaries of nature and deprived of love.
does any woman wants  this to happen to them? ! .

That will make his health and life to sustain for ever to mend,

A LIFE BETWEEN THEMThe most painful dawn, 
one can ever know, 
is the painful death, 
of love let go.
Gone with its passing, 
Are more than just dreams, 
A flower shall wilt, 
As jealousy teems.

The most painful noon, 
One can ever see, 
Is the painful death, 
Of  your mothers dream.
Gone with her eyes, 
Are the reflection of you, 
As a mirror shall break, 
So shall you too.

The most painful day, 
One can ever feel, 
Is the painful death, 
Of the ideal.
The mirror once broke, 
Shall repair a new, 
But in its reflection, 
A darker view.

The most painful dusk, 
One can ever taste, 
Is the painful death, 
Of your lovers face.
Gone with her smile, 
Are the remnants of wonder, 
Impossible to hold, 
When buried asunder.  

The most painful eve, 
One will ever fight, 
Is the painful death, 
Of dawn to night.
While life is a trial, 
Filled with ladders and rope, 
There is nothing more painful, 
Than forgetting to
hope. 



Where there are answers
To questions I've always asked

Where I no longer have to worry
About future, present, and past

In a life I never knew
I imagined I'd be carefree

But for all I know
That's daydream
Not a reality

So in another world
There is a life I never knew
But I realize now. 

That I don't want to. 

There are faces in the darkness

There to see and not be seen.

We are players acting out

"A Midsummer night's  Dream"

 

I am a minor player-

An inconsequential part

Think of me as of a wall

Between two loving hearts

 

I've learned my choreography

And know my lines by heart.

I hear the music playing-

the thing’s about to start.

 

Stage love is unending

and best described as blind.

No pair ending up estranged-
the happy ever kind-


 

The people go home happy

By car or cab or train

And wake up the next morning

To find that nothing’s changed. 

I multiply my own madness
I write and write again
Words and more words
Lines and more lines
Hope and more hope
To the end of my time

I have lived my life in writing
And I will so live it to the end

Even if I have not been good enough
It has given me meaning and hope and joy and sanity and love
For so many years

I am still here
And no matter how much longer it will be

I thank G-d for having given me 
A life in writing as my life


Even the moon and the stars
And all the lights of the night
Cannot explain why
This man I met walking bent and lonely tonight
Had a life incommensurate in joy and blessing 
With his great ability 
For creating Music of Beauty. 

A LIFE IS LIVED THE WAY IT IS LIVED 

A life is lived the way it is lived
I did what I did 
And made mistakes
Maybe most of it was a mistake
I don’t know.

I told myself always 
The one thing I would never do
Is  regret. 
Regrets I don’t have
But the tone of regret now touches all I do
And some deep sadness says
‘I should not have failed so much.’

G-d who gave me this one life
And so much time
And so much opportunity 
G-d who gave me my chance truly. 

Can I blame You, 
If I did not make it

There! little girl; don't cry! 
They have broken your doll, I know; 
And your tea-set blue, 
And your play-house, too, 
Are things of the long ago; 
But childish troubles will soon pass by. -- 
There! little girl; don't cry! 

There! little girl; don't cry! 
They have broken your slate, I know; 
And the glad, wild ways 
Of your schoolgirl days 
Are things of the long ago; 
But life and love will soon come by. -- 
There! little girl; don't cry! 

There! little girl; don't cry! 
They have broken your heart I know; 
And the rainbow gleams 
Of your youthful dreams 
Are things of the long ago; 
But Heaven holds all for which you sigh. -- 
There! little girl; don't cry

A lesson learned
Is a lesson worth
All the gold
Upon this earth

A lesson learned
Without the pleasure
Of maybe what
Would  be my treasure

Is a lesson
I've become to rue
Not finding out
If you were true

At worst
I would have known the score
Instead of wondering
For evermore

I accept I'll probably
Never know
With a lesson learned
I gotta let go


I wanna
Life like Vanilla
A little bland
But expected smooth
A creamy soft sweetness
Without the need for forgiveness.

I wanna
Life like Vanilla
To lift the karma of my soul
Above contention
Beyond retribution
To a place where
You’ll never meet
An old lover that you
Forgot to call
The day after
In a grocery store aisle.

I wanna 
Life like Vanilla
Where there is no reaction
To action
Or inaction.
Where you’re guaranteed
To reap what you sow
But no one cares
Because-
It’s ALL like Vanilla.

YEAH! 
I wanna
Life like Vanilla
Where the rent is always paid.
Where the final cost
Is never
Too high.
Where you never
Wake to find
That you not only
Have an incurable disease
BUT
That you passed it on
To the one you love 
The most.

HELL YEAH! 
Give me
A life like Vanilla
Without the threat
Of nuclear terrorism or
The need to overthrow
Evil dictators
Where soldiers are
Never mothers
Or fathers
Or sons
Or daughters
Or brothers
Or sisters
And exist to only attend
Ceremonies
And present awards
For patriotism
Where no one attends
Because they’ve grown
Common
Expected
Old
Allot
Li ke 
Those 
Barely touched 
Tubs
In Ice-cream parlors
Flavored 
Vanilla. 

Frail friends, I love you all! 
Maybe that's the trouble, 
storm in the eye of a storm. 
Everyone wants too much. 
Instead we gratefully accept 
some stylized despair: 

suitcoats left hanging 
on folding chairs, snow falling 
inside a phonebooth, cows 
scouring some sad pasture. 
You know the sort of landscape, 
all sensibility and no trees. 

Nothing but space, a little 
distance between friends. 
As if loneliness didn't make us 
responsible, and want accomplices. 
Better to drink at home 
than to fall down in bars. 

Or to read all night a novel 
with missing heirs, pages 
in ten-point type, and lay my body 
down, a snarl of urges 
orbited by blood, 
dreaming of others. 

So my question to you is simple and yet sharp as a knife, 
Are you living a life of death or the death of your life? 
Is death coming suddenly, or are you just wasting away? 
Which of these morose questions holds the truth I cannot say, 
With one hand you're watching your life decay, 
On the other you're waiting for your last day, 
Whichever of these statements you feel is true, 
The end of your life is all it comes down to. 

The white burning in the threshold
Spinning a circle for a circus lion cross
Being whispered into his ear
A harlequin tear the edge of his smile and a path
The door became a mastering light
To disappear among the words of opening
Too many for an entrance and only one for a step real
Come into those eyes stretching across the faces
To learn the edges of a sight
Is not too hard provided that you don't even want to
The eyes are those of a parent
Will do the things for you
Give food shelter protection perhaps
Feed you on the mind that speaks of fire

Or  you'll be raised a child of chill
Its breath frozen held in a flame
Forever burning in the treetops
Dressed in your hair ties by the lips
Let loose of a necklace around a white neck
Belted around the waist vest cherished
Of a life on the edge of a stainless steel


Life is a river of living riches
As is the bountiful nature itself
Filled with wonderful living things
All beautiful, essential and splendid
Of which fate evolves within specificities
Where opportunities abound around in surge
Awaiting pleasure for whoever sees it through.

Life is a forest of living ideas
As is the thoughts of the mind itself
Filled with voluminous vivid aspirations
All beautiful, essential and so profound
Of which dream arises within capacities
Where inspiration triggers able perspiration
Awaiting success for whoever works it through.

Life is a display of living arts
As is the outcome of imaginations itself
Filled with colors from the talents of poets
All beautiful, essential and very adorable
Where love becomes the ultimate feeling
Awaiting zest for whoever wishes it through. 

A life pops out
When the mother is giving birth
Today
And at the same time she is feeling the pain of giving birth
Birth doesn't come without pain
Because pain is the part of giving birth


Leave me to my senses
And the darkness of a room, 
For I have no reflection
And my eyes refuse to see
The light even if a day or love, 
Or memory-so extinguished, 
Is the lamp that once lit up
My life with purpose. 

Myself-so outward changed, 
That I seem not to maintain
A singular character
Apart from others, 
Whose, separately, take their cue
From placement and environment, 
Each by turn-but tell me-
Did you expect another me? 

Another page, another grave
For yesterday's treasure-
The sustaining pursuit
Or a self-made uncertainty, 
 A need for growth or freedom-
What does it mean- but me or you-
 Alive with possibility, 
Owning nothing to the past but this? 


New York City
 KARNA was abondoned since he was illegitimately born before KUNTI got married.  

KARNA
 was born with an ear ring [kundalam] and a shield in his chest [kavasam] with this no body
 could have killed KARNA.. 

he was very magnanimous and that was his DHARMA.. 

and that
 was his second shield. . 

KURUSHETRA war if taken on the face of it seems very inhuman
 towards this great soul]
 
I DEDICATE THIS TO MY DAD WHO WAS A FAN OF KARNA
 
Not just an arrow
would do to put this man down
'DHARMA' his life guard

Abandoned when born
born to kunti and the SUN
zero in the five

Born with  kundalam
born with kavasam in chest
death could not pierce him

Warrior by birth
humiliated by birth
an archer by birth

Most human he was
though a friend to duryodhan
heart of gold he had

Giver to the core
gave kavasam and kundalam
death's ploy to pierce him

The god's had to ploy
win over this man in sly
his dharma his life

Secret son met mom
promise on arjun given
a ploy there from mom

What a war was that
god's did it in style

Not just an arrow
would do to put this man down
'DHARMA' his life guard

to take his life out of him
a god given life

IN THE WAR FIELD. 

Arrow from Arjun
pierces Karna in his chest
Karna did not die

Not just an arrow
would do to put this man down
DHARMA  his life guard

KRISHNA as beggar
begged his dharma from this soul
a god not as  god

Karna gave dharma
in blood form to the beggar
all his shields he lost

Impressed by karna
krishna showed himself in full
from earth to the sky

A vision of god
with the world within he saw
KARNA died in peace

Not just an arrow
a life taken by many
what a noble soul


I hate what I've become, 
No one knows me, 
not even myself, 
I'm living the life you wanted, 
I'm living the life you dream about, 
When in reality, My dreams are about your life, 
Wanting the things I cannot have, 
your life seems so much more simple, 
When mine is a web of torture. 

I remember the old days
When hunger cleaved clean
The entrails within, 
Summer could pass without counting 
Raindrops but tears on my unscathed face 
Though unwilling, I became a man inside. 

I learnt how to plough, yoke oxen at seven 
A boy became a truculent man, grumpy and uneven. 
Throughout the cruel days of cries and whispers 
I don't remember dropping a molecule of whimpers 
I was taught to be deaf and dumb to pain 
Now defiant, sympathy is just a word in vain. 

Harsh were the days I journeyed 
Neither a sleep nor mirth have I enjoyed. 

Grungy and rough be my hands, 
I can't grasp an egg without breaking it 
Or stroke my fiancee without hurting her. 
I don't understand who I have become 
Though I can only remember who I were 
Not now but for time thus gone. 

A cold day freezes
My desperate thoughts
In a lonely place.

I can hear
A sad church bell chime
In a forlorn corner
Of this miserable city. 

I never want
To live long enough
To forget
Kissing your lips
Lovelier than chardonnay

Or the intoxicating
Lightheadedness
Of seeing you
In your white sweater
And being swayed
By the sensual fragrance
Of your perfume. 

Swept under the shadows of civilization
Africa lies frozen under the carpet of injustice
Shedding cold tears of abandonment
Africa reels under the weight of the world
Unkept, disease infested and prone to war
Africans live an underground life of beggars
Aid is a weapon of mass embarrassment
Delivered in a weird package called charity
Africa with its abundant resources
Has been turned into a junk yard
A mound of 'precious junk' 
Africa overflows with natural resources
Yet life remains frozen in the cold valley of stone age
Unable to reach the highest heights of civilization


I sat and I watched as a flower gently unfolded
I sat and I watched as it blossomed with gold
reaching out from its centre its beauty was told.

Ever so slowly it stretched out to the sun
basking in light and drinking the rain that came down
from the earth it emerged as it grew and it sprouted
revealing all that its invisible seed had endowed it.

I sat and I watched as it wilted and faded
I sat and I watched as it slowly grew old
returning back to its centre its end was foretold.
Ever so slowly it reached for the earth
with no resistance to falling to the place of its birth.

It had spoken its message, fulfilled its aim
in announcing that fragrance that its seed had contained; 
and now it rests gently on the the warmth of the ground
so totally surrendered to that end that it found.

I sat and I watched as all this unfolded
I sat and I watched as it blossomed and faded
the essence of fragrance, the centre of all
my love was made manifest by the unfolding of all. 

On Hepatitis Day.. 

approaching! 
 
There he is, a very sick man.
Taut his face and a darkish tan.
Life for him, now a staple ban.
left not a friend nor a fan.

Wonder how others see him out.
Doubles he up in a coughing bout.
Think some, he's a filthy lout.
Punks skip by, give him a shout.

Cool and dig on the party scene.
Blonds and brunettes vied to lean.
Now he is ever hardly seen.
An no one else is either keen.

Seldom up an down the street.
Then, too often, he feels the heat.
Barely walks an drags his feet.
Eschewed even by a cop on beat.

Cringes he often clasps his hands.
Hair now thinned to wiry strands.
Stands he far at mounting stands.
Lonely soul from unknown lands.

Frail an done, lost and Gaunt.
Life's now just a slippery Slant.
No more welcome at his haunt.
He has no need and no want.

Life for him is a steady bad day.
Those he knew, turn, shy away.
Pitiable man that has no sway.
Caught up nature an yelled a stay! 

Who'll pick up his dejected life? 
Who's got the time for this rife? 
A broken soul an body in strife.
Brooding days an toying a knife.

(May I  think  I'm  going  to  make  it  through, 
It's  been  so  long  you  see; 
There's  much  more  life  behind  me  now
Than  out  in  front  of  me.

There  was  a  time,  when  not  so  sure; 
I  thought  to  end  it  then.
I  didn't  see  how  one  could  live
Without  much  joy  and  win.

But  I  found  out  you  can  endure
Without  a  special  one.
And  after  all,  it  must  be  said; 
Of  fate,  what's  done  is  done.

And  so  I  choose  to  carry  on  
With  life  and  burdens  bore.
I  hope  if  I  can  carry  these, 

But  if  He  did,  I  hope  He'd  grant, 
My  just  one  simple  plea; 
To  end  my  life  with  one  great  love
Who'd  bring  great  joy  to  me.

So  now  I'm  near  the  end  of  life, 
My  joyless  days  near  done.
I'd  lie  if  I  would  dare  to  say,  
I  never  did  have  fun. 

But  what  is  true,  and  that's  the  rub, 
Of  life,  don't  you  agree; 
Is  love  is  really  what's  required, 
For  joy  to  be  set  free? 

So  on  it  is  with  what  remains, 
I  hope,  not  very  long; 
Of  life,  perhaps  to  know  great  love, 
If  it  should  come  along.

And  as  I  go  my  separate  way, 
I'll  not  begrudge  their  joy; 
If  others  feel  what  I  once  felt, 
When  I  was  just  a  boy.

Instead  I'll  smile  and  just  recall  
The  joy  I  felt  back  then.
And  know  that  I'll  feel  soon  enough
Love's  wondrous  joy  again. 

At the blinked of your innocent eyes
You see the kind of world you are in
Living through all the varied adventures
Life has become a challenge to indulge

At the touched of your innate senses
You feel the kind of world you deal with
Lingering through all the secular adversities
Life has become a maze of imperfections

At the thought of your curious mind
You discover the kind of world you live in
Searching through all those aged mysteries
Life has become a myriad of clever revelations

But as there is a beginning there also an end
To all the firsts times that you do and experience
As life is filled with complexities that made existence
It is apparent that such eventually  will come to a dead endlife's an inspiration in a lyrical-stoical style


A lifetime is a lot of days, 
A lot of places, a lot of faces; 
A lot of hours, to fill and fill
With sad and happy social graces.

A lifetime is a lot of days, 
A lot of lovers, both May and December; 
But just remember, as you near the end-
You've forgotten much more, than you'll ever remember. 

She had been through so much, 
Still, the cancer had spread
Now six weeks into treatment
 She's confined to her bed.　 

My wife's been a smoker
since she turned sixteen.
Through the years we were married
and the years in between.

Now though she breathes
like a fish brought to shore.
her long term addiction
had her craving one more. 

Who am I to judge her
or deny her last wish.
She is not getting better, 
I've no heart to resist.

I gave her the smokes
she had long put away
I gave her the lighter
and sought out her ash tray. 

A tremendous explosion ripped
through our first floor.
It indeed had proved fatal
her request for one more.

on purpose or accident
I can't judge her intent
in choosing to smoke
in her oxygen tent.
　In a single heart
My pen eating blue
A paper paling white
The means of all the skin
In the hear dying its ends
And eyes closing down
Make not a single sound

   Not present on the year
At any other period.
   When March is scarcely here

A color stands abroad
   On solitary hills
That science cannot overtake,
   But human naturefeels.

It waits upon the lawn;
   It shows the furthest tree
Upon the furthest slope we know;
   It almost speaks to me.

Then, as horizons step,
   Or noons report away,
Without the formula of sound,
   It passes, and we stay:

A quality of loss
   Affecting our content,
As trade had suddenly encroached
   Upon a sacrament. 

There's a light on in the attic. 
Thought the house is dark and shuttered, 
I can see a flickerin' flutter, 
And I know what it's about. 
There's a light on in the attic. 
I can see it from the outside. 
And I know you're on the inside.  lookin' out. 

In the darkness of your thoughts
Created by circumstances
Both complex and overwhelming, 
When no amount of spirits
Or conversation within yourself
Can erase the images imprinted
On your mind
  .  

Let me lift you out of suffering
On angel wings to lofty heights
Where nothing can hurt you
Where nothing is relevent
But the blessings of the moment
And the air that we breathe.  .  

Let me wrap you in my  warm embrace
And hold you close to my heart
With love and understanding
Beyond the need for mortal words
Your darkness will be lifted
And your spirit shall fly free.  ..

The light  in your darkness.   

let me be.

 see a light
A light through your heart
The special heart glows in the dark
Warm me with your melodious heartbeat tonight
Sweetly kill the quietness of the night
Come and inspire me for a of song
A song of love with sound of heartbeat
Could you stay a while 
Help me finish the song for you
With the hope we still together for long
So i have a chance to sing you
A song of a every night
My love song


I.

So far as our story approaches the end,
  Which do you pity the most of us three?---
My friend, or the mistress of my friend
  With her wanton eyes, or me?

	II.

My friend was already too good to lose,
  And seemed in the way of improvement yet,
When she crossed his path with her hunting-noose
  And over him drew her net.

	III.

When I saw him tangled in her toils,
  A shame, said I, if she adds just him
To her nine-and-ninety other spoils,
  The hundredth for a whim!

	IV.

And before my friend be wholly hers,
  How easy to prove to him, I said,
An eagle's the game her pride prefers,
  Though she snaps at a wren instead!

	V.

So, I gave her eyes my own eyes to take,
  My hand sought hers as in earnest need,
And round she turned for my noble sake,
  And gave me herself indeed.

	VI.

The eagle am I, with my fame in the world,
  The wren is he, with his maiden face.
---You look away and your lip is curled?
  Patience, a moment's space!

	VII.

For see, my friend goes shaling and white;
  He eyes me as the basilisk:
I have turned, it appears, his day to night,
  Eclipsing his sun's disk.

	VIII.

And I did it, he thinks, as a very thief:
  Though I love her---that, he comprehends---
One should master one's passions, (love, in chief)
  And be loyal to one's friends!''

	IX.

And she,---she lies in my hand as tame
  As a pear late basking over a wall;
Just a touch to try and off it came;
  'Tis mine,---can I let it fall?

	X.

With no mind to eat it, that's the worst!
  Were it thrown in the road, would the case assist?
'Twas quenching a dozen blue-flies' thirst
  When I gave its stalk a twist.

	XI.

And I,---what I seem to my friend, you see:
  What I soon shall seem to his love, you guess:
What I seem to myself, do you ask of me?
  No hero, I confess.

	XII.

'Tis an awkward thing to play with souls,
  And matter enough to save one's own:
Yet think of my friend, and the burning coals
  He played with for bits of stone!

	XIII.

One likes to show the truth for the truth;
  That the woman was light is very true:
But suppose she says,---Never mind that youth!
  What wrong have I done to you?

	XIV.

Well, any how, here the story stays,
  So far at least as I understand;
And, Robert Browning, you writer of plays,
  Here's a subject made to your hand

Come, stay. 

and let your light live
In my heart, in my soul, in my all in all

Come, stay with me, until this pain
Rest in peace and I will be whole..

Let your light shine like a free flowing vessel
Let that peace begin. 

I wonder about you 
standing purposely on immense seas 
with a sweeping loneness. 

A lighted tower, 
you seem perfectly suited to who you are. 

I, unlike you, 
am always in trouble with myself, 
there is great division. 
The bridge has never been built 
connecting one side of me to the other. 

I am attracted by your excellence. 

I see the tower 
and call upon the architect of my bridge; 
the specifications are 
that it connects me to you. 

When it comes time to cross 
I will know what is on the other side. 

You bridged me when we first made contact. 
Something very deep in you 
pulled me out of myself, 
the fog lifted 
and I moved toward your light, 

your eyes, the beams; 
your body, the tower; 
your voice, the horn 
and your presence the way, 

a lighthouse of dreams. 

a little smile
a little cry
i want to stay with a ray
for it seems to understand
the meaning of a sunbeam
against the sky that slowly virms
the last of ages the fourth of times
that cracks like fire and soul
and burns itself in a language
that never goes beyond
the microeconomic terms of contract
for an ill hailed host

A Limbic Poem

Life is a walk in  the sun, getting wet in the rain, 
a touch on the skin. a hug, a light in the eye.
She is my Moon Calf with the sheep's eyes, 
halfway to Heaven and my love that knows no bounds.

And I have no  peace when madness comes in, 
and love goes out the window and death waits. 
Death and time, time on the tom-toms, 
measuring - with the all persistent pain
of my psychological cancer which never lets go.
I have enough of madness, and my golden sadness
for the both of us.

I am living and can feel the pain that we are facing 
in the dark night, good or not, in the emptiness of death, 
in the unanswered question: Where is that love 
that reads the newspaper and dribbles away to emptiness? 
There is only my golden sadness, no rainbows, 
and only darkness that will go on forever without me


There once was a girl named Erin
At whom all the guys would be starin'
She was lean and lithe, 
But bad poems she despised.
So I'm fearin' about how I'm farin'tis the day after St Paddy's Day
and I've a few words to say - if I may? 
to a person new-old
with a heart of pure gold

(it was actually on the holiday, so this is truly fated to be a wish belated)Between sleep and waking.
Between self----


Unrest comes sweetly in the dusk
Of dreams, dressed in the musk  
Of plangent desires, of pleasures unblessed
By either staring day or striving night, 
Untrammelled, unconfined by what cannot be
In the blank realms of dank reality.

Haunting the shades of the brain, a paradox, 
A dark guest, comes to greet me. A secret jest
At the expense of sun and moon, 
A feral mockery, urbane, foxy, 
Hides in those eyes.
A soft caress which teases, ‘Never’
(But in this trance-time I imagine, ‘Soon’) 
Loosens my thighs. 

The tests
Of the world mean nothing here.
All that is day, bright and clear 
Is banished from my breast. 
All that is night, numb and sightless
Gone from my mind. I am unconfessed, 
Undone, ungendered, all sins unredressed, 
Absolved from the ugly blight of righteousness; 
Never, while kind drowsiness
Permits, to fight meaningless, 
Unnecessary battles. A light, dewy
Liminality divests
Me of all needs but one: a supple sinuous
Seeking, in this boundless space, a quest-
To be embraced and lost, unsought, unguessed. 

The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift, 
The road is forlorn all day, 
Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift, 
And the hoof-prints vanish away. 
The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,
Expend their bloom in vain. 
Come over the hills and far with me, 
And be my love in the rain. 

The birds have less to say for themselves 
In the wood-world’s torn despair
Than now these numberless years the elves, 
Although they are no less there: 
All song of the woods is crushed like some 
Wild, easily shattered rose. 
Come, be my love in the wet woods; come,
Where the boughs rain when it blows. 

There is the gale to urge behind 
And bruit our singing down, 
And the shallow waters aflutter with wind 
From which to gather your gown.
What matter if we go clear to the west, 
And come not through dry-shod? 
For wilding brooch shall wet your breast 
The rain-fresh goldenrod. 

Oh, never this whelming east wind swells
But it seems like the sea’s return 
To the ancient lands where it left the shells 
Before the age of the fern; 
And it seems like the time when after doubt 
Our love came back amain.
Oh, come forth into the storm and rout 
And be my love in the rain. 

Tiny little hands clasped my eyes
And a soft voice chirped guess who am I, 
Who are you, sound familiar, let me see-
I won’t tell, how could you have forgotten me

I know she enjoys these games we play.
Oh dear, you have to give me a hint today.
She was happy and was trying hard not to laugh
And I went along pretending to be a little daft-

Soon the mystery resolved and she was on my lap
My daughter looking amused tried to take a snap.
Come on Anika, say cheese and give a nice smile, 
Like a pro she posed, acting coy with those big eyes.

What took you so long my little angel? 
Its school, ballet and homework she prattled-
Now I have vacation, so can I stay here? 
I have packed and come, you know I care.

I want to paint and hear all the bed time tales, 
Yes dear, on hearing she ran like a gale.
Mom, you were not so liberal with us
Said my daughter, how come you make no fuss, 

When she spoils your fine linen with her paints.
There is a difference, now I am a grandparent-
She comes with fragrance of spring flowers, 
After she is gone I wistfully smile for hours-Can see your acts of infidelity, 
Even I closed my eyes completely.
There were times when I stood witnessed, 
Yet all those escapades you had I dismissed! 

Why can I not let you go? 
Hurting me is what you always do! 
Is loving you worth this dire sacrifice? 
Why you do this, do I not suffice? 

You are breaking my feeling, 
Each time when you are leaving! 
I know you are entwine with somebody, 
Candlelight dinner with sweet melody! 

The pain lingers in my sleep.
With teary eyes lying in weep.
Though in my dream you're angel, 
Soon in the morning I will see a devil! 

How long can I hold this suffering, 
To your continuous philandering? 
Maybe it is about time to declare, 
You are free to leave, I do not care

To the lasting pleasure of a good cigar




There is a hint still, still a hint, stillness scented
With the smoky  aftermath of what was, pleasure
Left behind,  an essence, a silky presence  
A  swelling memory, a spirit tranquilly  indwelling
That fills, quietly, the empty room, that makes all well. 
This is what is meant, this lifts gloom, this is the tent
In the desert which calms the mind and soothes the sense 
That  comes out of the lonely night to find that dryness 
Is comfortingly quenched by fragrance, by  remembrance. 

Come with me, hold tight my hand, 
Whilst I show you my beloved land, 
Africa’s blood washes through my veins, 
From Bushveld glades to savanna plains.

Have you ever heard a lion roar, 
Been close enough to touch his paw, 
Stared eye to eye, smelled his breath, 
Observed razor teeth of instant death; 

And then that roar-that numbing sound
Sending tremors through the very ground.
A lightening swipe of five sharp claws; 
No video this, you can’t press pause.

Reality life, your minutes numbered, 
Certain death- your life encumbered; 
But that day twas not meant to be, 
 
A shot rang out-a sound so sweet, 
The king of beasts lay at my feet, 
This was no trophy, no great prize.
My life.  

his death-no compromise. 

A list of some observation. In a corner, it's warm. 
       A glance leaves an imprint on anything it's dwelt on. 
       Water is glass's most public form. 
       Man is more frightening than its skeleton. 
       A nowhere winter evening with wine. A black 
       porch resists an osier's stiff assaults. 
       Fixed on an elbow, the body bulks 
       like a glacier's debris, a moraine of sorts. 
       A millennium hence, they'll no doubt expose 
       a fossil bivalve propped behind this gauze 
       cloth, with the print of lips under the print of fringe, 
       mumbling "Good night" to a window hinge. 

Never importune an importuner
Never psychologize a pathological liar
Never try to lie to a psychotic parapsychologist
Never pet a fly if you're post-para-epileptic

Never sympathize with an unknown sympathizer
Never parrot a petulant psychic
Never hypnotize a pedantic pedagogue
And NEVER, never talk Pig Latin to a hedgehog


I. 

THE FATHER.

FATHER of Heaven, and Him, by whom 
It, and us for it, and all else for us, 
Thou madest, and govern'st ever, come 
And re-create me, now grown ruinous: 
My heart is by dejection, clay, 
And by self-murder, red. 
From this red earth, O Father, purge away 
All vicious tinctures, that new-fashioned 
I may rise up from death, before I'm dead. 


II. 
THE SON.

Sin and Death, crept in, which were never made, 
By bearing one, tried'st with what stings 
The other could Thine heritage invade ; 
O be Thou nail'd unto my heart, 
And crucified again ; 
Part not from it, though it from Thee would part, 
But let it be by applying so Thy pain, 
Drown'd in Thy blood, and in Thy passion slain. 


III. 

THE HOLY GHOST.

O Holy Ghost, whose temple I 
Am, but of mud walls , and condensed dust, 
And being sacrilegiously 
Half wasted with youth's fires of pride and lust, 
Must with new storms be weather-beat, 
Double in my heart Thy flame, 
Which let devout sad tears intend, and let— 
Though this glass lanthorn, flesh, do suffer maim— 
Fire, sacrifice, priest, altar be the same. 


IV. 

THE TRINITY.

O blessed glorious Trinity, 
Bones to philosophy, but milk to faith, 
Which, as wise serpents, diversely 
Most slipperiness, yet most entanglings hath, 
As you distinguish'd, undistinct, 
By power, love, knowledge be, 
Give me a such self different instinct, 
Of these let all me elemented be, 
Of power, to love, to know you unnumbered three. 


V. 

THE VIRGIN MARY.

For that fair blessed mother-maid, 
Whose flesh redeem'd us, that she-cherubin, 
Which unlock'd paradise, and made 
One claim for innocence, and disseized sin, 
Whose womb was a strange heaven, for there 
Our zealous thanks we pour. As her deeds were 
Our helps, so are her prayers ; nor can she sue 
In vain, who hath such titles unto you. 


VI. 

THE ANGELS.

And since this life our nonage is, 
And we in wardship to Thine angels be, 
Native in heaven's fair palaces 
Where we shall be but denizen'd by Thee ; 
As th' earth conceiving by the sun, 
Yields fair diversity, 
Yet never knows what course that light doth run ; 
So let me study that mine actions be 
Worthy their sight, though blind in how they see. 


VII. 

THE PATRIARCHS.

And let Thy patriarchs' desire, 
—Those great grandfathers of Thy Church, which saw 
More in the cloud than we in fire, 
Whom nature clear'd more, than us grace and law, 
And now in heaven still pray, that we 
May use our new helps right— 
Be satisfied, and fructify in me ; 
Let not my mind be blinder by more light, 
Nor faith by reason added lose her sight. 


VIII. 

THE PROPHETS.

Thy eagle-sighted prophets too, 
—Which were Thy Church's organs, and did sound 
That harmony which made of two 
One law, and did unite, but not confound ; 
Those heavenly poets which did see 
Thy will, and it express 
In rhythmic feet—in common pray for me, 
That I by them excuse not my excess 
In seeking secrets, or poeticness. 


IX. 

THE APOSTLES.

And thy illustrious zodiac 
Of twelve apostles, which engirt this All, 
—From whom whosoever do not take 
Their light, to dark deep pits throw down and fall ;— 
As through their prayers Thou'st let me know 
That their books are divine, 
May they pray still, and be heard, that I go 
Th' old broad way in applying ; O decline 
Me, when my comment would make Thy word mine. 


X. 

THE MARTYRS.

And since Thou so desirously 
Didst long to die, that long before Thou couldst, 
And long since Thou no more couldst die, 
Thou in thy scatter'd mystic body wouldst 
In Abel die, and ever since 
In Thine ; let their blood come 
To beg for us a discreet patience 
Of death, or of worse life ; for O, to some 
Not to be martyrs, is a martyrdom. 


XI. 

THE CONFESSORS.

Therefore with Thee triumpheth there 
A virgin squadron of white confessors, 
Whose bloods betroth'd not married were, 
Tender'd, not taken by those ravishers. 
They know, and pray that we may know, 
Hourly tempestuous persecutions grow ; 
Temptations martyr us alive ; a man 
Is to himself a Diocletian. 


XII. 

THE VIRGINS.

The cold white snowy nunnery, 
Which, as Thy Mother, their high abbess, sent 
Their bodies back again to Thee, 
As Thou hadst lent them, clean and innocent ; 
Though they have not obtain'd of Thee, 
That or Thy Church or I 
Should keep, as they, our first integrity, 
Divorce Thou sin in us, or bid it die, 
And call chaste widowhead virginity. 


XIII. 

THE DOCTORS.

The sacred academy above 
Of Doctors, whose pains have unclasp'd, and taught 
Both books of life to us—for love 
In Thy other book—pray for us there, 
That what they have misdone 
Or missaid, we to that may not adhere. 
Mean ways, and call them stars, but not the sun. 


XIV.

And whilst this universal quire, 
That Church in triumph, this in warfare here, 
Warm'd with one all-partaking fire 
Of love, that none be lost, which cost Thee dear, 
Prays ceaselessly, and Thou hearken too 
—Since to be gracious 
Our task is treble, to pray, bear, and do— 
From trusting in those prayers, though pour'd out 
thus. 


XV.

From being anxious, or secure, 
Dead clods of sadness, or light squibs of mirth, 
From thinking that great courts immure 
All, or no happiness, or that this earth 
Is only for our prison framed, 
Or that Thou'rt covetous 
To them whom Thou lovest, or that they are maim'd 
From reaching this world's sweet who seek Thee 
thus, 


XVI.

From needing danger, to be good, 
From owing Thee yesterday's tears to-day, 
From trusting so much to Thy blood 
That in that hope we wound our soul away, 
From bribing Thee with alms, to excuse 
Some sin more burdenous, 
From light affecting, in religion, news, 
From thinking us all soul, neglecting thus 


XVII.

From tempting Satan to tempt us, 
By our connivance, or slack company, 
From measuring ill by vicious 
Neglecting to choke sin's spawn, vanity, 
From indiscreet humility, 
Which might be scandalous 
From being spies, or to spies pervious, 
From thirst or scorn of fame, deliver us. 


XVIII.

Deliver us through Thy descent 
Into the Virgin, whose womb was a place 
Of middle kind ; and Thou being sent 
To ungracious us, stay'dst at her full of grace ; 
And through Thy poor birth, where first Thou 
Glorified'st poverty ; 
And yet soon after riches didst allow, 
By accepting kings' gifts in th' Epiphany ; 
Deliver us, and make us to both ways free. 


XIX.

And through that bitter agony, 
Which is still th' agony of pious wits, 
Disputing what distorted Thee, 
And interrupted evenness with fits ; 
And through Thy free confession, 
Though thereby they were then 
Made blind, so that Thou mightst from them have gone ; 
We may not, and we may, blind unjust men. 


XX.

Through Thy submitting all, to blows 
Thy face, Thy robes to spoil, Thy fame to scorn, 
All ways, which rage, or justice knows, 
And by which Thou couldst show that Thou wast born ; 
And through Thy gallant humbleness 
Which Thou in death didst show, 
Dying before Thy soul they could express ; 
Deliver us from death, by dying so 
To this world, ere this world do bid us go. 


XXI.

When senses, which Thy soldiers are, 
We arm against Thee, and they fight for sin ; 
When want, sent but to tame, doth war, 
And work despair a breach to enter in ; 
Makes us idolatrous, 
And love it, not him, whom it should reveal ; 
When we are moved to seem religious 


XXII.

In churches, when th' infirmity 
Of him which speaks, diminishes the word ; 
When magistrates do misapply 
To us, as we judge, lay or ghostly sword ; 
When plague, which is Thine angel, reigns, 
Or wars, Thy champions, sway ; 
When heresy, Thy second deluge, gains ; 
In th' hour of death, th' eve of last Judgment day ; 
Deliver us from the sinister way. 


XXIII.

A sinner is more music, when he prays, 
Than spheres' or angels' praises be, 
In panegyric alleluias ; 
We know not what to say ; 
Thine ear to our sighs, tears, thoughts, gives voice and word ; 
O Thou, who Satan heard'st in Job's sick day, 
Hear Thyself now, for Thou in us dost pray. 


XXIV.

That we may change to evenness 
This intermitting aguish piety ; 
That snatching cramps of wickedness 
And apoplexies of fast sin may die ; 
That music of Thy promises, 
Not threats in thunder may 
Awaken us to our just offices ; 
What in Thy book Thou dost, or creatures say, 


XXV.

That our ears' sickness we may cure, 
And rectify those labyrinths aright, 
That we by heark'ning not procure 
Our praise, nor others' dispraise so invite ; 
That we get not a slipp'riness 
And senselessly decline, 
From hearing bold wits jest at kings' excess, 
To admit the like of majesty divine ; 


XXVI.

That living law, the magistrate, 
Which to give us, and make us physic, doth 
Our vices often aggravate ; 
That preachers taxing sin, before her growth ; 
That Satan, and envenom'd men— 
Which will, if we starve, dine— 
When they do most accuse us, may see then 
Us to amendment hear them, Thee decline ; 


XXVII.

That learning, Thine ambassador, 
From Thine allegiance we never tempt ; 
That beauty, paradise's flower 
For physic made, from poison be exempt ; 
That wit—born apt high good to do— 
By dwelling lazily 
On nature's nothing be not nothing too ; 
That our affections kill us not, nor die ; 
Hear us, weak echoes, O, Thou Ear and Eye. 


XXVIII.

By taking our blood, owest it us again, 
Gain to Thyself, or us allow ; 
And let not both us and Thyself be slain ; 
Which could not stick to Thee, 
O let it not return to us again ; 
But patient and physician being free, 
As sin is nothing, let it nowhere be. 

FIRST ANTIPHONE.
ALL the bright lights of heaven
I will make dark over thee;
One night shall be as seven
That its skirts may cover thee;
I will send on thy strong men a sword,
On thy remnant a rod;

SECOND ANTIPHONE.
All the bright lights of heaven
Thou hast made dark over us;
One night has been as seven
That its skirt might cover us;
Thou hast sent on our strong men a sword,
On our remnant a rod;

THIRD ANTIPHONE.
As the tresses and wings of the wind
Are scattered and shaken,
I will scatter all them that have sinned,
There shall none be taken;
As a sower that scattereth seed,
So will I scatter them;
As one breaketh and shattereth a reed,
I will break and shatter them.

FOURTH ANTIPHONE.
As the wings and the locks of the wind
Are scattered and shaken,
Thou hast scattered all them that have sinned,
There was no man taken;
As a sower that scattereth seed,
So hast thou scattered us;
As one breaketh and shattereth a reed,
Thou hast broken and shattered us.

FIFTH ANTIPHONE.
From all thy lovers that love thee
I will make darkness above thee,
And thick darkness under thee;
Before me goeth a light,
Behind me a sword;
Shall a remnant find grace in my sight?

SIXTH ANTIPHONE.
From all our lovers that love us
Thou madest darkness above us,
And thick darkness under us;
Thou hast kindled thy wrath for a light,
And made ready thy sword;
Let a remnant find grace in thy sight,

SEVENTH ANTIPHONE.
Wilt thou bring fine gold for a payment
For sins on this wise?
For the glittering of raiment
And the shining of eyes,
For the painting of faces
And the sundering of trust,
For the sins of thine high places
And delight of thy lust?

For your high things ye shall have lowly,
Lamentation for song;
Ye shall seek me and shall not reach me
Till the wine-press be trod;
In that hour ye shall turn and beseech me,

EIGHTH ANTIPHONE.
Not with fine gold for a payment,
But with coin of sighs,
But with rending of raiment
And with weeping of eyes,
But with shame of stricken faces
And with strewing of dust,
For the sin of stately places
And lordship of lust;

With voices of men made lowly,
Made empty of song,
We reach out hands to reach thee
Ere the wine-press be trod;

NINTH ANTIPHONE.
In that hour thou shalt say to the night,
Come down and cover us;
To the cloud on thy left and thy right,
Be thou spread over us;
A snare shall be as thy mother,
And a curse thy bride;
Thou shalt put her away, and another
Shall lie by thy side.

Thou shalt neither rise up by day
Nor lie down by night;
And the sight of thine eyes shall be made
As the burning of fire;
And thy soul shall be sorely afraid
For thy soul’s desire.

Ye whom your lords loved well,
Putting silver and gold on you,
The inevitable hell
Shall surely take hold on you;
Your gold shall be for a token,
Your staff for a rod;
With the breaking of bands ye are broken,

TENTH ANTIPHONE.
In our sorrow we said to the night,
Fall down and cover us;
To the darkness at left and at right,
Be thou shed over us;
We had breaking of spirit to mother
And cursing to bride;
And one was slain, and another
Stood up at our side.

We could not arise by day,
Nor lie down by night;
Thy sword was sharp in our way,
Thy word in our sight;
The delight of our eyelids was made
As the burning of fire;
And our souls became sorely afraid
For our soul’s desire.

We whom the world loved well,
Laying silver and gold on us,
The kingdom of death and of hell
Riseth up to take hold on us;
Our gold is turned to a token,
Our staff to a rod;
Yet shalt thou bind them up that were broken,

VERSE I 

    In a famed town of Caledonia's land, 
    A prosperous port contiguous to the strand, 
    A monarch feasted in right royal state; 
    But care still dogs the pleasures of the Great,
    And well his faithful servants could surmise 
    From his distracted looks and broken sighs 
    That though the purple bowl was circling free,
    His mind was prey to black perplexity. 

    At last, while others thoughtless joys invoke, 
  Fierce from his breast the laboured utterance broke; 
  "Alas!" he cried, "and what to me the gain 
  Though I am king of all this fair domain, 
  Though Ceres minister her plenteous hoard, 
  And Bacchus with his bounty crowns my board, 
  If Neptune still, reluctant to obey, 
  Neglects my sceptre and denies my sway? 
  On a far mission must my vessels urge 
  Their course impetuous o'er the boiling surge; 
  But who shall guide them with a dextrous hand, 
  And bring them safely to that distant land? 
 Whose skill shall dare the perils of the deep, 
  And beard the Sea-god in his stormy keep? 


VERSE II 

  He spake: and straightway, rising from his side 
  An ancient senator, of reverend pride, 
  Unsealed his lips, and uttered from his soul 
  Great store of flatulence and rigmarole; 
  -- All fled the Court, which shades of night invest, 
  And Pope and Gay and Prior told the rest. 

You can hel somebody
To a certain extend
But be aware that people can take advantage of you
Please learn to say no
Because if you don't you are going to get hurt


In alien lands I keep the body
Of ancient native rites and things:
I gladly free a little birdie
At celebration of the spring.

I'm now free for consolation,
At least, to one of his creations
I've given freedom in this world!


'A little bird I am,
Shut from the fields of air,
And in my cage I sit and sing
To Him who placed me there:
Well pleased a prisoner to be,

'Naught have I else to do;
I sing the whole day long;
And He whom most I love to please
Doth listen to my song,
He caught and bound my wandering wing,
But still He bends to hear me sing.

'A little birdy once asked me
how does one write good poetry? 
is it by the number of times
a person finds perfect rhymes? 
and what would make it sound better? 
is it by sticking to iambic meter
anapestic meter, trochaic meter
or any other type of meter? 

Should I adhere to the norm
of using an idiom
or two in everytime
I compose a poem? 
and when I perform
should my style and form
also conform
to the already existing forms? 

If I was ever to gain
an audience's attention
would I do that
by showing them
to what extent
I had attained
lyrical perfection
by using alteration? 

Should I write clearly
with lots of vivid imagery
sugar-coated with lots of similes? 
finally, should its meaning be
plain for all to see
or should it be shrouded
and coated with a tinge
of mystery
by adding all sorts
of metaphors and puns? 

I then replied: 
I'm not a laureate
neither am I a great poet! 
I just write from the heart
my lines don't conform
to anyone else's form
I have no specific

IN THE STORY

A little bit of Brooklyn fell
 From out the sky one day-
And landed in Corona
Near the subway and the bay

And when the mayor saw it
Sure it looked so green and fair
He said suppose we fund it-
And condemn the junkyards there


So they issued us some tax free bonds
To make the grandstands grow
And charged too much to sit in them
even up in the last row


There is a place within that always waits 
For sunshine, knowing rain at last abates. 

Everything recalls from whence it sprang; 
As the songbird’s joy, when first it sang. 

A little bit of ice inside the storm; 
A hint of parents in the newly born. 

The seed of love implanted at first sight, 
To blossom fullblown, tender loving light. 

Embedded in each tear the whole of grief; 
All our ends twined round one falling leaf. 

As brother unto brother does incline; 
A little bit of sun in me still shines. 

I saw you today and I have to say
That you really looked great
But I guess my words of kindness
Come just a little bit too late

I never took the time before
To praise you like I should
I know I never took the time
To tell you, you looked good

I know I never hit you
But words of love were few
I guess that’s why I find myself
Living life without you



about forty-five feet below it’s mother’s nest.

Stepping over the unseen fetus, the first rays
 
of dawn  reflected it’s tranquil blue, cooler than 

the required mother’s degree feathered belly.
 
No more than fourteen short days before escape 

from that hollow inside to inevitable blue skies. 

Then, there must be feedings every fifteen minutes. 
 
Impossible to even contemplate.

Now late for my classroom full of disabled

children, also demanding attention, slowly learning 

their way out, I hurry along surprised 

to find my palm cradling a tiny blue shell. 

When I feel there is no hope
And begin to feel I shall not cope
I reach up to the bookshelf to find
Something to read to ease my mind

And nine times out of ten what happens
Is your hand takes mine within seconds
Reaching for a little book to remind me
When I needed you most you did not leave me


Nought loves another as itself,
   Nor venerates another so,
 Nor is it possible to thought
   A greater than itself to know.
 
 'And, father, how can I love you 
   Or any of my brothers more? 
 I love you like the little bird
   That picks up crumbs around the door.'
 
 The Priest sat by and heard the child; 
   In trembling zeal he seized his hair,
 He led him by his little coat,
   And all admired the priestly care. 
 
 And standing on the altar high,
   'Lo, what a fiend is here! said he:
 'One who sets reason up for judge
   Of our most holy mystery.'
 
 The weeping child could not be heard,
   The weeping parents wept in vain:
 They stripped him to his little shirt,
   And bound him in an iron chain,
 
 And burned him in a holy place
   Where many had been burned before; 
 The weeping parents wept in vain.
   Are such thing done on Albion's shore

To and fro, to and fro
In my little boat I go
Sailing far across the sea
All alone, just little me.
And the sea is big and strong
And the journey very long.
To and fro, to and fro
In my little boat I go.

Sea and sky, sea and sky,
Quietly on the deck I lie,
Having just a little rest.
I have really done my best
In an awful pirate fight,
But we cdaptured them all right.
Sea and sky, sea and sky,
Quietly on the deck I lie--

Far away, far away
From my home and from my play,
On a journey without end
Only with the sea for friend
And the fishes in the sea.
But they swim away from me
Far away, far away
From my home and from my play.

Then he cried "O Mother dear

"
And he woke and sat upright,
They were in the rocking chair,
Mother's arms around him--tight.A little bread—a crust—a crumb—
A little trust—a demijohn—
Can keep the soul alive—
Not portly, mind! but breathing—warm—
Conscious—as old Napoleon,
The night before the Crown!

A modest lot—A fame petite—
A brief Campaign of sting and sweet
Is plenty! Is enough!
A Sailor's business is the shore!
A Soldier's—balls! Who asketh more,
Must seek the neighboring life

It was a little budding rose,
Round like a fairy globe,
And shyly did its leaves unclose
Hid in their mossy robe,
But sweet was the slight and spicy smell
It breathed from its heart invisible. 

The rose is blasted, withered, blighted,
Its root has felt a worm,
And like a heart beloved and slighted,
Failed, faded, shrunk its form.
Bud of beauty, bonnie flower,
I stole thee from thy natal bower. 

I was the worm that withered thee,
Thy tears of dew all fell for me;
Leaf and stalk and rose are gone,
Exile earth they died upon.
Yes, that last breath of balmy scent
With alien breezes sadly blent

Only a little scrap of blue 
Preserved with loving care, 
But earth has not a brilliant hue 
To me more bright and fair. 

Strong drink, like a raging demon, 
Laid on my heart his hand, 
When my darling joined with others 
The Loyal Legion band. 

But mystic angels called away 
My loved and precious child, 
And o'er life's dark and stormy way 
Swept waves of anguish wild. 

This badge of the Loyal Legion 
We placed upon her breast, 
As she lay in her little coffin 
Taking her last sweet rest. 

To wear that badge as a token 
She earnestly did crave, 
So we laid it on her bosom 
To wear it in the grave. 

Where sorrow would never reach her 
Nor harsh words smite her ear; 
Nor her eyes in death dimmed slumber 
Would ever shed a tear. 

"What means this badge?" said her father, 
Whom we had tried to save; 
Who said, when we told her story, 
"Don't put it in the grave
 


We took the badge from her bosom 
And laid it on a chair; 
And men by drink deluded 
Knelt by that badge in prayer. 

And vowed in that hour of sorrow 
From drink they would abstain; 
And this little badge became the wedge 
Which broke their galling chain. 

And lifted the gloomy shadows 
That overspread my life, 
And flooding my home with gladness, 
Made me a happy wife. 

And this is why this scrap of blue 
Is precious in my sight; 
It changed my sad and gloomy home 
And I'm stuck in the mall, 
The traffic is moving
At barely a crawl.

There's snow on the rooftops, 
The roadways and lawns; 
That's good for old Santa, 
But rough on his pawns.

My homecoming family
Is stranded out there; 
The reason is simple, 
They are coming by air.

My internet purchases
Have yet to arrive; 
They'll skin me alive.

I tried to send greetings, 
But failed with my fax; 
I've extended my credit
Right up to the max.

I'm going to sweep this
Far under the rug
And settle my nerves
With a hearty 'Humbug'.

Tonigt, I'll thaw turkey
And pour myself sherry, 
Get warm, snug and cozy
And make myself merry.

At this special moment, 
Perhaps I should write-
Just don't get uptight. 

She drew
Mother and father 
Brother and sister
And a rainbow

She drew
A tree and a root
A stone and a brook
And a rainbow

She drew
A house and a roof
A chimney and a sweeper
And a rainbow

She drew
A path and a step
A sound of a key
And a rainbow

She drew
A table and chairs
A meal and desert
And a rainbow

She drew
A bed and a lullaby
A good night kiss
And a rainbow

She drew
The night and a star
A Moon upon a star
And a rainbow

She drew
Mother and father
Sister and brother
And a rainbow


A little Dog that wags his tail
And knows no other joy
Of such a little Dog am I
Reminded by a Boy

Who gambols all the living Day
Without an earthly cause
Because he is a little Boy
I honestly suppose - 

The Cat that in the Corner dwells
Her martial Day forgot
The Mouse but a Tradition now
Of her desireless Lot

Another class remind me
Who neither please nor play
But not to make a 'bit of noise'
Beseech each little Boy -A little East of Jordan,
Evangelists record,
A Gymnast and an Angel
Did wrestle long and hard—

Till morning touching mountain—
And Jacob, waxing strong,
The Angel begged permission
To Breakfast—to return—

Not so, said cunning Jacob!
"I will not let thee go
Except thou bless me"—Stranger!
The which acceded to—

Light swung the silver fleeces
"Peniel" Hills beyond,
And the bewildered Gymnast

I found a little fairy 
someone had discarded on the ground. 
I picked her up 
put her in my pocket. 
Never again will she be alone. 
She can now sit on my desk 
as she has found a new home. 
If I have, any wishes 
I hope she will grant them to me. 
This little fairy I found 
someone had discarded on the ground. 

A flower grew out of the ground
A tiny flower from the dirt
A tiny living soul from underground
A baby crawling from the dirt
A little innocence of wild color
A tiny spark of hope
A tiny pleasure free of charge
A flower that i called my own
A little baby ran towards it
A tiny flower crushed beneath the feet
A little human innocence
A little bliss destroyed by ignorance
A little flower dead on the ground
A little baby jumping up and down
And only me from my own window, witnessed the death of my own flower beneath the feet of blissful child without idea of his first crime.  

A Little Fun Keeps You Young
 

A little fun keeps you young; 
A little laughter keeps you bright.
When you get to that age
When a mid life crisis looms
Go out and act like a kid again.
Don’t worry what the neighbors might say
They are probably crazy anyway.

Change your hair color grow it long
Change your style and wear a thong
That will put some spring in your step
Or goose yourself to give you some pep
Don't worry what the neighbors might say
They are probably crazy anyway

Dance till the wee hours in the morning
Let loose, but don’t get lost in the spring
Smile, even if there’s nobody around
Run, until you’re nowhere to be found
Don’t worry what the neighbors might say
You are more than crazy than they anyway..


Pssst.. 

have fun reading this, please, lol.

Everyday across the Internet 
we reach out to touch new friends. 
Friends who in person 
we might never see. 
Our hand is held out 
and at times is gratefully received. 
Recently I made a new friend 
who lives far away from me. 
Yet when we write to one another, 
she could be in the room next to me. 
This little poem is written just for her. 
A little gift of thanks from a friend 
in a different country. 
I just hope she likes it, 
for Tsira this is for you from me.

June he boat is so small, rifted from the house top, 
A lonely child, sits there quiet and in dread, 
Fear not of the life but of the water flooded, 
Entered into the streets and the homes of pitiable, 

The journey of her has begun with the thud, 
Holding the plank of the boat looking up, 
The sky is on mourn, the water just starts to flow, 
Backward, she observing what are on both sides, 

Those given up the hope, floated on the water, 
The trees, animals, human and their belongings, 
The toy car, she wanted the most, floats along with her, 
To the ocean, the bubbles of air gushing out, 

She holds her little boat tight, until rescued, 
The air is calm; the wind has gone back to rest, 
A small puppy tries to swim against the current, 
The eyes are as clear as the diamonds, 

Keeping the head up, dancing with the front legs, 
The lone girl sees the lone puppy, struggles, 
Just extends the hand to pick up, as she has, 
A little more space for the lost and obtained, 

Both of them on the shack of float, 
That has the two hearts, beating for life, 
Unaware of the destination, they let, 
Themselves to be drifted out nowhere else, 

But to the palace of hope, where the monarchs, 
Are crowned to the jubilation of the crowds, 
The little boat may be seen and saved, 
The little livings can continue living on the land, 
saved by the tree, which turned into the wood.
and the Boat.. 

A life that didn't stand a chance
destroyed before it began
like a sacrifice to the slaughter

A little girl is crying
her mother is in denial
a street full of people
everybody watching
but nobody looking

A little girl is crying
as her father sells ice and crack
for the devil and his crew


A little girl is crying


Children of the future age,
 Reading this indignant page,
 Know that in a former time
 Love, sweet love, was thought a crime.
 
 In the age of gold,
 Free from winter's cold,
 Youth and maiden bright,
 To the holy light,
 Naked in the sunny beams delight.
 
 Once a youthful pair,
 Filled with softest care,
 Met in garden bright
 Where the holy light
 Had just removed the curtains of the night.
 
 Then, in rising day,
 On the grass they play;
 Parents were afar,
 Strangers came not near,
 And the maiden soon forgot her fear.
 
 Tired with kisses sweet,
 They agree to meet
 When the silent sleep
 Waves o'er heaven's deep,
 And the weary tired wanderers weep.
 
 To her father white
 Came the maiden bright;
 But his loving look,
 Like the holy book
 All her tender limbs with terror shook.
 
 'Ona, pale and weak,
 To thy father speak!
 Oh the trembling fear!
 Oh the dismal care
 That shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair!


'Abandoned to sadistic streets, 
A school room of sullen tears, 
A little girl lost beneath
A blanket of rejection and fears
Moves slowly through
The lonely night; 
The effects of drugs
Are wearing off-

And dawn has no promise
Of sunlight and pleasant songs. 

Grant me the moment, the lovely moment
That I may lean forth to see
The other buds, the other blooms,
The other leaves on the tree:

That I may take into my bosom
The breeze that is like his brother,
But stiller, lighter, whose faint laughter
Exhoes the joy of the other.

Above on the blue and white cloud-spaces
There are small clouds at play.
I watch their remote, mysterious play-time
In the other far-away.

Grant I may hear the small birds singing
the song that the silence knows. 
(The Light and the Shadow whisper together,
The lovely moment grows,

Ripples into the air like water
Away and away without sound,
And the little girl gets up from her praying
On the cold ground)an unintentional remark
AND

with the flick
of a switch
your face
grows tight
and white
with rage

and I stand
heart hammering
helpless
to stop your hurt
and frustration

your habit
from along ago
when you hid your face
from the jeers
of your peers
and pretended you didn't care

I made 
a terrible mistake
and caused you more pain
than I could have ever imagined

I know
deep down
you have forgiven me

but sadly
I also know
you'll never forget. 

We  had build this dream house of ours, 
A little house under the clouds, 
with beautiful garden and trees, 
and five little stars shining above.

I had never complain along the way, 
My tears only flow not because of sadness, 
But seeing the five bright stars play above, 
Twinkling beautifully, to our utmost happiness.

I had tasted the heat of fire but kept my smiles, 
Seen droplets of tears  fell like rain from your eyes, 
As we know there is no perfect sky, 
Even in full moonlight, dark clouds do come for a while.

The day will soon come for me to leave, 
Pray our five bright stars will continue to give, 
For the spirit and love of this little house, 
Be a blessing for all-a gift from the sky. 

On days when the world 
seems to be getting on top of you, 
stop and look around, 
give someone a little hug 
and chase the world away. 
You would be surprised 
what a little hug can do. 
It can lift the weight 
off your shoulders 
and make you feel good to. 
So as you read this little poem, 
give someone a little hug. 
They might need it 
just as much as you.

June e sits by the window
Watching the rain fall down
He keeps looking to the sky
Hoping the sun will shine

His baseball glove in his hand
His baseball uniform on since early morning
Today was to be the day
He was to play his first little league game
But his joy was interrupted
By an not forcasted sudden rain

He sits by the window
Watching the rain fall down
He keeps looking to the sky
Trying to find the sun

sharpening the rulers
opening the compasses

For everything a reason
and a season under the sun; 
every puzzle has its answer
that is not uniquely our own.

Nothing remains a mystery
in the light of life's experience, 
or hurts like the awareness
we cannot live it over again.

Yet nothing is ever lost if we
pass such wisdom to one another; 
no life lived in vain, that sheds
light on the path for a brother. 

Ancient of Days, grown little for your mirth
(As under the low arch the land is bright)
Peered through you, gate of heaven--and saw the earth.

Or shutting out his shining skies awhile
Built you about him for a house of gold
To see in pictured walls his storied world
Return upon him as a tale is told.

Or found his mirror there; the only glass
That would not break with that unbearable light
Till in a corner of the high dark house

Star of his morning; that unfallen star
In that strange starry overturn of space
When earth and sky changed places for an hour
And heaven looked upwards in a human face.

Or young on your strong knees and lifted up
Wisdom cried out, whose voice is in the street,
And more than twilight of twiformed cherubim
Made of his throne indeed a mercy-seat.

Or risen from play at your pale raiment's hem
Or your tall body climbed the ivory tower
And kissed upon your mouth the mystic rose. 

I dreamed a little dream of you; 
too small a dream to contain
all the ways you reach out to me, 
too short to encompass your eternity, 
too coloured to reveal your purity; 

I dream a little dream of you; 

I sleep with you and you with me, 
as I dream my little dream, 
of what this seeming seems.
joined in our love. 

A little Madness in the Spring
Is wholesome even for the King,
Who ponders this tremendous scene - 
This whole Experiment of Green - 
As if it were his own

There is a little man inside the computer 
That sits around all day. 
He has nothing better to do 
Than to give us trouble all day 
With his freezing ray 
And to make himself 
A real nuisance at night. 
Better beware because he is watching you. 
He likes to think he is Big Brother 
From the other side of the screen. 
I'd like to pick up my computer 
And shake this pesky imp out 
As he always does things 
At the most inappropriate times.
 
He leaves a few little megahertz 
After taking a few little gigabytes 
Crunching and munching on wires 
So our web cams go on the Fritz 
Then he'll just sit back and laugh 
At our frustrated faces 
And know exactly which buttons to push 
As we start pulling out our hair 
We can reboot all we want 
Lose him for awhile 
But he's back again the very next day 

Afraid of his eyebrows moving in and out
Like an owl who wanted to prowl
Seeking his preys, to savour till it last
Until the dawning catches him in awful blast
But we love this man, no matter what
Just his eyes and smiles melt us 
he only have to say, hi and hello
Enough to stay, breath and live for a day


For Meggie who suggested I write this.

Deep in the oceans 
where the little fishes play 
there lives a little mermaid 
and her name is Haveagayday. 
She is not sure how she got her name, 
but it is her name no less, 
it might have been her mother 
who helped a fisherman in distress.

One day Haveagayday was playing 
with her friend a little merman named Gunga Din. 
While they played Bubbles, a moaning Clam 
came floating by on his way. 
He stopped for a moan 
that could never be alone. 
He said he couldn’t find a soft spot of sand to bury himself in. 

Now Haveagayday and Gunga Din suggested 
he go to some sandy beach
where the blue waters lap gently to the shore. 
There in the golden sand 
he could be on his own all day long.

Bubbles blew some more bubbles 
and quickly whooshed away 
leaving the little mermaid and merman 
to continue with their play. 
Several days later while playing near that spot 
they met up with the moaning clam, 
old Bubbles again.

"You said it would be quiet 
in that place in the sun, 
that I would have all the peace and quite I wanted. 
Well you were wrong 
with all those noisy surfers 
all trying to crack my shell."

Haveagayday and Gunga Din thought 
about what they could do. 
Then Gunga Din remembered 
about his Genie friend. 
If his bottle were still on the beach, 
his three wishes would help Bubbles 
get his peace and quiet.

Haveagayday and Gunga Din swam off 
to find the Genie in the bottle 
if he was still on the beach. 
They found the beach 
where Gunga Din had put the bottle. 
They searched along the beach 
hoping the bottle hadn’t been found.

Finally, they found the bottle 
and Gunga Din pulled the cork 
and set the Genie free. 
The Genie came out in a puff of smoke. 
"I have three wishes to grant thee."  
"I know Mr Genie and I’ll have those wishes 
for you to grant to me."

"Tell me what your wishes are 
and I will make them come true." 
"We have a friend named Bubbles 
who wants a quiet beach to live." 
"Granted." The Genie said.

"My second wish is that Bubbles 
has a friendly mate f
or when the loneliness gets too much." 
The Genie smiled and clicked his fingers 
and the wish was done. 
"You have one more wish. Do you want it now? " 
"Oh, yes please."

"I have a friend who is a Genie 
whom would like to be free. 
My third wish is then that you set my Genie free
for now and ever more."

The Genie snapped his fingers. 
"Your wish has been granted." 
He then looked at Gunga Din. 
"You know you wasted that last wish. 
You could have kept it for something your heart desired."  
"But I did Genie. My wish for your freedom 
was my hearts desire. 
That you be, free forever more."

Haveagayday and Gunga Din got married 
later on that year. 
The Best man at their wedding 
was the Genie whom he set free. 
Also at the Wedding 
were Bubbles and his bride to be Cuddles. 
Now they all live happily together   
Haveagayday, Gunga Din, Bubbles, Cuddles 
and of course the Genie 
under the deep blue sea.

June ust beyond the reef 
where the little fishes swim 
there lives a little merman 
and his name is Gunga Din. 
He frolics in the ocean 
from morning to night, 
playing with the mermaids 
is his hearts delight.

One day while playing 
on the ocean floor 
Gunga din found a bottle 
with a Genie trapped within. 
He opened the bottle 
and set the Genie free. 
The Genie then said to him. 
"Three wishes I now grant to thee."

"Three wishes? What are those? " 
Gunga Din asked the Genie. 
"Wishes are made 
for anything you want, 
and then I will make them come true." 
"But I have no need for wishes. 
I have everything my heart desires." 
"But surely there is something 
that you would like most of all? "

Gunga Din shook his head. 
"There is nothing I require." 
"Nothing? " Asked the Genie. 
"Nothing." Gunga Din replied. 
"You see Mr Genie 
I have everything I need. 
I am completely satisfied 
with everything I have got."

"The oceans are my gardens 
to play around all day within. 
I have plenty of friends 
to keep me company. 
So what do I need your wishes for? 
I have everything I’ll ever need."

"But I must grant you three wishes 
for setting me free 
and If you won’t take the wishes 
I cannot be free." 
Gunga thought for a moment. 
This cannot be right. 
Everyone must be free 
to do as they wish.

"Get back in the bottle, Mr Genie. 
I’ll take you to some distant sandy shore. 
I’ll put you on the beach 
for someone to find. 
I’m sure in that greedy world out there, 
that there is someone 
who will take up your wishes 
and set you free.


December he grew, like other girls and flowers,
Sheltered and tended daintily; 
And told her dolls, through sunny hours, 
A prince would come her love to be.

And none denied her as she grew
The kingdom where her prince was lord.
For him she bloomed, and drank the dew 
Of youth, and wore the virgin's sword.

From her strong tower of maidenhood 
She saw brave men ride east and west; 
And dreamed of peace in love's deep wood, 
With babies nestling on her breast. 

And when no knight her banner bore, 
Nor hailed her with love's accolade, 
Silent beside her open door
She wondered first, then grew afraid:

Afraid of quickened dust whereof 
Life made but phantoms for a show; 
Afraid of laughter and of love, 

And things the world calls wise and good 
She did to bid her fear be still; 
Gave largess of her brains and blood, 
Chastened her bold, far-wandering will. 

But, withering ever at the heart, 
She felt her spirit die unborn. 
A ghost, she moved on earth apart, 
And feared to face the angels' scorn. 

A Little Peep In My Life
 
waking up early in the morning
is always an exciting moment for me
my prayer time, my communion with Him

my husband, joining hands together
for our couple prayer time
all our concerns for the day
and intercede for others
who needs our prayers.

a typical day, a simple day for me
i just love it this way
no spectacular activities
no ifs, no buts

the usual routine, day in and day out
as would a wife and a mother do
preparing our meals straight from my heart
though simple, they love and savor my cooking
oh, it's mother's, who can compare her expertise on this? 
a compliment i always hear everyday from them

time for me.. 

to read and write
time for me to reach out a friend
time for me to listen to their woes
time for me to be there for them
oh, and these are my favorite thing

to be there when needed.. 

because.. 

i am a friend.. 

A little pig went to market, 
but no one wanted to buy him 
so the farmer took him home 
and started calling him Babe.

Babe was a herding pig 
and learned to herd sheep. 
Everyone looked amazed 
at the sheepdog trials.

Babe walked away 
with the first prize 
and left many sheepdogs 
with their mouths open.

Then came a movie producer 
and saw the little pig. 
He wrote a story 
and Babe got the lead.

Now the little pig that went to market 
is a big movie star. 
Last I heard is he in line 
for and Oscar someday.

February  LITTLE POEM/ AT HEART, AT HOME

A little poem-

At heart, a home-

And the soul, 

less alone. 

The song of birds, the rapture of the rose;
Cloud-dappled skies, the laugh of limpid springs,
Drowned sunbeams and the perfume April blows;
Bronze wheat a-shimmer, purple shade of trees -

Let us be praiseful, Sire, for simple sights; -
The blue smoke curling from a fire of peat;
Keen stars a-frolicking on frosty nights,
Prismatic pigeons strutting in a street;
Daisies dew-diamonded in smiling sward -

The hope to do a kindly deed each day;
The faith of fellowship, a conscience clean,
The will to worship and the gift to pray;
For all of worth in us, of You a part,

look down on us with kindness and affection. 
Let us see the way to helping others 
the way you have guided us to one another. 
Have mercy on those lost souls 
and show them the path back to your light. 
Help us forgive those who have wronged us 
and will wrong us in the future.

Amen

May aving a new friend in our
land, 
To her, we extend our hand.

My family, is waiting, to see
you there
To place a flower, in your 
hair..

Your house, number one, in 
the row, 
Surrounded by lots of mistletoe.

Decorated with candy kisses, 
For a special little misses.

You'll meet Snow White, 
Tinker Bell too, 
They'll come out, and play, 
with you.

You can join our fairy clan
Play in our family band.

Dance around our fairy ring, 
Enjoy yourself, laugh and
sing.

Yarrow, will help you too, 
Make sure your dreams 
come true.

So welcome to our fairy
land, 
Little Princess, from far
away land..
             TO           
SWEET DAUGHTER OF AFZAL SHAUQ      

 


Note of thanks of Afzal Shauq to Heather wilkins

Thanks dear heather for your love tribute to my litle Tiny daughter Hadeel Breshna afzal Khan (Sakani Hadeel)

What is thy pay? '
The Liberty of saying, 
What you have to say. 

It comes in many flavors.
It comes in lots of smells.
It can keep a secret
and never, ever tell.

You'll know it when you hear it.
If you look, you'll see it, too.
It's everywhere around outside, 
even there, inside of you.

It can turn a sad day happy.
It can turn a mad day glad.
It will even be there
when you've been really bad.

It's something in both day and night, 
every second, every minute.
It's right there in your family
and everyone who's in it.

Did you guess my riddle? 
Just a few things left to say -
If you want a lot of it, 
then give it ALL away! 

It's left and right.  It's all around.
It's under and above.
I think you've guessed the answer! 
It's   L - O - V - E    love. 

A little road not made of man,
Enabled of the eye,
Accessible to thill of bee,
Or cart of butterfly.

If town it have, beyond itself,
'T is that I cannot say;
I only sigh,--no vehicle
Bears me along that way. 

I cannot explain the way I feel about you
Girl, you're always on my mind
Everytime I often think of you
I get a funny feeling that
I'm so in love with you
I want to give you all my love
Let me show you that I'm real
The love that I have shall never fade away
I'm tired of being broken hearted
I need a little romance in my life
Can't you see I need little romance? 
Take my hand
May I have this dance
No one can love the way that I can love
I'm telling you
I need a chance
I need a little romance in my life


A little Snow was here and there
Disseminated in her Hair - 
Since she and I had met and played
Decade had gathered to Decade - 

But Time had added not obtained
Impregnable the Rose
For summer too indelible
Too obdurate for Snows -As i was wheeled to the operating room
His little voice still lingered in my ears
The anesthesia was successfully done
And before i went into a deep sleep
I can still see his face in the waiting room
Worried, with tears in his eyes
But showed his bravery for me

We were alone in my hospital bed
Waiting for the doctors to come
I was having a miscarriage
Nervous and fear painted my face

My little boy was holding my hands
Touching my head, stroking my hair
With his soft voice, he whispered
'Don't be afraid, I am here, 
I will take care of you, Mama

This promise of a little boy
Kept me going throughout my ordeal
He did touch my heart
And i was moved to tears
Knowing that in his innocent ways
He showed his bravery that night
And promised me
That everything will be alright


When you, my Dear, are away, away, 
How wearily goes the creeping day. 
A year drags after morning, and night 
Starts another year of candle light. 
O Pausing Sun and Lingering Moon! 
Grant me, I beg of you, this boon. 

Whirl round the earth as never sun 
Has his diurnal journey run. 
And, Moon, slip past the ladders of air 
In a single flash, while your streaming hair 
Catches the stars and pulls them down 
To shine on some slumbering Chinese town. 
O Kindly Sun! Understanding Moon! 
Bring evening to crowd the footsteps of noon. 

But when that long awaited day 
Hangs ripe in the heavens, your voyaging stay. 
Be morning, O Sun! with the lark in song, 
Be afternoon for ages long. 
And, Moon, let you and your lesser lights 
Watch over a century of nights. 

A little songbird sang 
from a treetop high. 
It sang for blue skies 
for within to fly. 
It sang out its message 
at the first rays 
of the dawning day. 
It also sang for peace and love 
within a world filled with unrest. 
It sang a joyous message 
for all those who wanted to hear 
that little songbird 
that sang in a treetop high.



January our touch says more
Than any word, 
And you have tears
Of love
In your eyes.
I feel my life flowing inside me
Like an insightful river.
I try to understand our intimacy
And our deep feelings.
I try to protect you and
To nurture your dreams.
Your beautiful soul is like a secret garden, 
With little, sweet flowers
Needing help to grow up
And having friends like sun, wind and water. 
I hold you tightly, 
And I try to make you understand that
You will always be my very wanted child, 
My light, 
My happiness
And my hope


A little soul with monstrous fears
Teaches lessons 
No one need hear.

We need Poets with guts, 
And not poltroons like me- 
Poets who Believe- 
Poets who can Dream. 


IAll summer long he collected his nuts
Burying them here and there
When it came to dig them up
He couldn’t remember where
He hid his treasure store

The moral of this tale
Be sure, there is one indeed
If you want to bury your treasures
And you ain’t that smart
Draw a little map, that will help for a start


I purchased 
A mug that had a picture of a little star
In a store that sells
Mugs


Some days you wake up 
and gloomy clouds cover the sky. 
It doesn’t mean you are 
going to have a bad day for a start. 
The sun might shine 
in someone else’s eyes 
and brighten up your own. 
So never, frown 
when you see the clouds. 
Don’t feel full of gloom. 
They might be there 
for someone else. 
Just smile a little bit 
and bring a little sunshine 
into someone else’s world.

April his beautiful world and creativity
Glimpses of fantastic and marvelous creations
Oceans, mountains, rivers and all
The rain forests, animals and rivers
Above those we the humans to enjoy
And make ourselves to lead a happy life
A blessing we gets in this birth
We are also blessed with the cognisance
Tries to conquer the entire universe
But miles to go far for the achievement
The little man ever ready to accomplish
The motivation we get from nature great. 

Break my ice
Breaking the window
Sealed inside the world
A tight small ball of tension
It will consume you 
But, never be consumed by you
Hold it down-
Add them up
Don’t the regrets add up fast? 
Especially when you can’t get past the past
Lovely is the moment 
Only as lovely as anything human can be
Only has hateful 
As the lost sin of a baby-
Only as precious as lustful love
Want to touch it
Want it to be yours
I’ll break every commandment
Just to see god right in front of my face
Shaking his head in shame
What a lovely vision 
Kind of like-
Broken fate
Oh so fake-
I suppose we should take a step back
Into the broken glass
Cut up feet
Everything I do-
It all seems I react too late


Your baby grows a tooth, then two,
and four, and five, then she wants some meat
directly from the bone. It's all

over: she'll learn some words, she'll fall
in love with cretins, dolts, a sweet
talker on his way to jail. And you,

your wife, get old, flyblown, and rue
nothing. You did, you loved, your feet
are sore. It's dusk. Your daughter's tall. 

I found a box filled with notebooks 
each filled with my writings of yesterdays. 
Writings that I had forgotten about 
across the span of time. 
They are of no great importance, 
but within their contents, 
I wonder if I will find some missing gems 
something, I may have written down 
and forgot about many years ago. 
I’m going to have to go through each one. 
It will be like returning to the past 
without the baggage it held. 
A little trip down memory lane 
when dreams were active then. 
I shall take my time and linger 
trying to remember what I was doing 
when I wrote whatever is there.

February here was a little turtle 
and his name was Muddle 
because at times he got confused 
could not remember if he was 
a tortoise or a turtle.

Had Muddle been brought up 
in the wild 
he would not have been confused, 
but he was brought up in captivity 
and now he was not sure what he was suppose to be.

Now Muddle lived a sheltered life. 
He had no friends or playmates 
to keep him company. 
Then one day in his glass cage, 
his owners put in someone new. 
Now he had someone to talk to. 

The newcomer stayed in his shell 
afraid to come out. He felt safe in there, 
thinking no one could see him 
when he was 
tucked inside his shell.

Muddle moved up to him 
and nudged him with his shell. 
"Have you gone to sleep in there? " 
Muddle asked as turtles do. 
"Come on out, 
no one is going to hurt you."

The stranger poked his head out 
and gave a look around. 
"Who are you? " he asked. 
"My name is Muddle. What is your name? " 
"My name is Timmy 
because I’m rather timid."

After their introductions, 
Muddle and Timmy 
settled in for a long chat. 
They talked to on another 
between little snacks, 
from sunrise to sunset.

Now Muddle had his company, 
someone he always wanted, 
and Timmy had a friend too. 
They both lived together happily 
and as they grew older 
Muddle found he wasn’t Muddle at all.

As it turned out 
Muddle was not Muddle, 
But Marianne. 
He was not a boy, but a little girl. 
Now Marianne and Timmy 
live together happily.

They are hoping for 
the patter of little feet 
in the not to distant future 
as they start their family 
and live happily ever after.

- May  little while a little love 
The hour yet bears for thee and me 
Who have not drawn the veil to see 
If still our heaven be lit above. 
Thou merely, at the day's last sigh, 
Hast felt thy soul prolong the tone; 
And I have heard the night-wind cry 
And deemed its speech mine own. 

A little while a little love 
The scattering autumn hoards for us 
Whose bower is not yet ruinous 
Nor quite unleaved our songless grove. 
Only across the shaken boughs 
We hear the flood-tides seek the sea, 
And deep in both our hearts they rouse 
One wail for thee and me. 

A little while a little love 
May yet be ours who have not said 
The word it makes our eyes afraid 
To know that each is thinking of. 
Not yet the end: be our lips dumb 
In smiles a little season yet: 
I'll tell thee, when the end is come, 
How we may best forget. 

A little while when I am gone
My life will live in music after me,
As spun foam lifted and borne on
After the wave is lost in the full sea. 

A while these nights and days will burn
In song with the bright frailty of foam,
Living in light before they turn
Back to the nothingness that is their home. 

A little while, a little while,
The weary task is put away,
And I can sing and I can smile,
Alike, while I have holiday.

Why wilt thou go, my harassed heart,
What thought, what scene invites thee now?
What spot, or near or far,
Has rest for thee, my weary brow?

There is a spot, mid barren hills,
Where winter howls, and driving rain;
But if the dreary tempest chills,
There is a light that warms again.

The house is old, the trees are bare,
Moonless above bends twilight's dome;
But what on earth is half so dear,
So longed for, as the hearth of home?

The mute bird sitting on the stone,
The dank moss dripping from the wall,
The thorn-trees gaunt, the walks o'ergrown,
I love them, how I love them all!

Still, as I mused, the naked room,
The alien firelight died away,
And from the midst of cheerless gloom
I passed to bright unclouded day.

A little and a lone green lane
That opened on a common wide;
A distant, dreamy, dim blue chain
Of mountains circling every side;

A heaven so clear, an earth so calm,
So sweet, so soft, so hushed an air;
And, deepening still the dream-like charm,
Wild moor-sheep feeding everywhere.

That was the scene, I knew it well;
I knew the turfy pathway's sweep
That, winding o'er each billowy swell,
Marked out the tracks of wandering sheep.

Could I have lingered but an hour,
It well had paid a week of toil;
But Truth has banished Fancy's power:
Restraint and heavy task recoil.

Even as I stood with raptured eye,
Absorbed in bliss so deep and dear,
My hour of rest had fleeted by,
And back came labour, bondage, care. 

A little while, a little while,
The noisy crowd are barred away;
And I can sing and I can smile
A little while I've holyday ! 

Where wilt thou go my harassed heart ?
Full many a land invites thee now;
And places near, and far apart
Have rest for thee, my weary brow - 

There is a spot 'mid barren hills
Where winter howls and driving rain
But if the dreary tempest chills
There is a light that warms again 

The house is old, the trees are bare
And moonless bends the misty dome
But what on earth is half so dear -
So longed for as the hearth of home ? 

The mute bird sitting on the stone,
The dank moss dripping from the wall,
The garden-walk with weeds o'ergrown
I love them - how I love them all ! 

Shall I go there? or shall I seek
Another clime, another sky,
Where tongues familiar music speak
In accents dear to memory ? 

Yes, as I mused, the naked room,
The flickering firelight died away
And from the midst of cheerless gloom
I passed to bright unclouded day - 

A little and a lone green lane
That opened on a common wide
A distant, dreamy, dim blue chain
Of mountains circling every side - 

A heaven so clear, an earth so calm,
So sweet, so soft, so hushed in air
And, deepening still the dreamlike charm,
Wild moor-sheep feeding everywhere - 

That was the scene - I knew it well
I knew the pathways far and near
That winding o'er each billowy swell
Marked out the tracks of wandering deer 

Could I have lingered but an hour
It well had paid a week of toil
But truth has banished fancy's power
I hear my dungeon bars recoil - 

Even as I stood with raptured eye
Absorbed in bliss so deep and dear
My hour of rest had fleeted by
And given me back to weary care -All people, fearfully call him a live poetry bomb, 
because his rhymes are deadlier than bullet’s storms.
When fires stanzas through his mouth’s barrel, 
hapless mind feels naked, in their wisdom’s apparel.
He often emails unsuspecting people to read his poetry 
and coax and beseech them to post their commentaries.
Many victims who had fell to fatal gunshots of his poetry, 
are still smarting from his deadly epitaphs in cemeteries.

He assembles vague paragraph and slices it into two half, 
so to fire it as a poem, and soar up his statistical graph.
Whenever he is short of ammunitions for poetic fights, 
he searches for explosives on rhyming dictionary’s sites.
Then he fuses combustive lines for his lethal mission, 
so to blow up all the literature with atomic poetry fission.
Then he ruthlessly bombs his poem on all poetry websites, 
wherein community of poets gather to taste literary delight.
Then he selfishly comments on other’s poems with fervour, 
knowing well that others would gladly reciprocate his favours.

Everyone in the society dreads his nuclear poetic blast, 
as it could push a poetic world into a literary holocaust.
People call him a poetic blitzkrieg of worst kind, 
as he shamelessly shatters a fragile peace of their minds.
for he mercilessly mutilates his inspiration’s streams.
Lo! all the wounded minds pray at mangled poem’s tomb  




Awaiting patiently
For a new sunrise to arrive
With my heart already healed
And my mind at peace, 
I still envision someone special
Coming my way one day! 

Someone who will not walk
Slowly in front of me
Or behind as my shadow
But someone close by my side
Heading the same direction
Toward the apex of life! 

I want someone humble, 
Fragile and caring
Bearing the softness of
A beautiful flower
And as colorful as the Rainbow! 
Someone who will not 
Look into my eyes
Instead of my heart! 

I need someone
Holding with pride my hand
While walking facing the Sun
Without going blind, 
In search of new horizons! 
Someone like you! 
The one I haven't yet found! 

Now, the question still remains: 
Where are you my love? 
I can hardly wait to meet you
Since time is passing by rapidly
And only the dream will stay behind! 
Hurry up! Come to me! 
And make this fantasy a reality! 


Only poems can attain, 
Where language seems to gather, 
More charm than you can name, 
Where Love blooms, poetic roses, 
And you leave a shattered world, 
Because poetry composes, 
The best things you've ever heard. 

No, I'll not say your name. I have said it now, 
As you mine, first in childish treble, then 
Up through a score and more familiar years 
Till baby-voices mock us. Time may come 
When your tall sons look down on our white hair, 
Amused to hear us call each other thus, 
And question us about the old, old days, 
The far-off days, the days when we were young. 

How distant do they seem, and yet how near! 
Now, as I lie and watch you come and go, 
With garden basket in your hand; in gown 
Just girdled, and brown curls that girl-like fall, 
And straw hat flapping in the April breeze, 
I could forget this lapse of years--start up 
Laughing--'Come, let's go play!' 
Well-a-day, friend, 
Our play-days are all done. 
Still, let us smile: 
For as you flit about your garden here 
You look like this spring morning: on your lips 
An unseen bird sings snatches of gay tunes, 
While, an embodied music, moves your step, 
Your free, wild, springy step, like Atala's, 
Or Pocahontas, careless child o' the sun-- 
Those Indian beauties I compare you to-- 
I, still your praiser,-- 
Nay, nay, I'll not praise, 
Fair seemeth fairest, ignorant 't is fair: 
That light incredulous laugh is worth a world! 
That laugh, with childish echoes. 
So then, fade, 
Mere dream. Come, true and sweet reality: 
Come, dawn of happy wifehood, motherhood, 
Ripening to perfect noon! Come, peaceful round 
Of simple joys, fond duties, gladsome cares, 
When each full hour drops bliss with liberal hand, 
Yet leaves to-morrow richer than to-day. 

Will you sit here? the grass is summer-warm. 
Look at those children making daisy-chains, 
So did we too, do you mind? That eldest lad, 
He has your very mouth. Yet, you will have 't 
His eyes are like his father's? Perhaps so: 
They could not be more dark and deep and kind. 
Do you know, this hour I have been fancying you 
A poet's dream, and almost sighed to think 
There was no poet to praise you-- 
Why, you're flown 
After those mad elves in the flower-beds there, 
Ha--ha--you're no dream now. 
Well, well--so best! 
My eyelids droop content o'er moistened eyes: 
I would not have you other than you are. 

Settin' round the stove, last night,
Down at Wess's store, was me
And Mart Strimples, Tunk, and White,
And Doc Bills, and two er three
Fellers o' the Mudsock tribe
No use tryin' to describe!
And says Doc, he says, says he--,
'Talkin' 'bout good things to eat,
Ripe mushmillon's hard to beat!'

I chawed on. And Mart he 'lowed
Wortermillon beat the mush--.
'Red,' he says, 'and juicy-- Hush--!
I'll jes' leave it to the crowd!'
Then a Mudsock chap, says he--,
'Punkin's good enough fer me--
Punkin pies, I mean,' he says--,
Them beats millons--! What say, Wess?

I chawed on. And Wess says--, 'Well,
You jes' fetch that wife of mine
All yer wortermillon-rine--,
And she'll bile it down a spell--
In with sorghum, I suppose,
But I'm here to tell all hands
Them p'serves meets my demands!'

I chawed on. And White he says--,
'Well, I'll jes' stand, in with Wess--
I'm no hog!' And Tunk says--, 'I
Guess I'll pastur' out on pie
With the Mudsock boys!' says he;
'Now what's yourn?' he says to me:
I chawed on-- fer-- quite a spell
Then I speaks up, slow and dry--,
Jes' tobacker!' I-says-I--.
And you'd ort o' heerd 'em yell

All night fell hammers, shock on shock;
With echoes Newgate's granite clang'd:
The scaffold built, at eight o'clock
They brought the man out to be hang'd.
Then came from all the people there
A single cry, that shook the air;
Mothers held up their babes to see,
Who spread their hands, and crow'd for glee;
Here a girl from her vesture tore
A rag to wave with, and join'd the roar;
There a man, with yelling tired, 
Stopp'd, and the culprit's crime inquired;
A sot, below the doom'd man dumb,
Bawl'd his health in the world to come;
These blasphemed and fought for places;
Those, half-crush'd, cast frantic faces,
To windows, where, in freedom sweet,
Others enjoy'd the wicked treat.
At last, the show's black crisis pended;
Struggles for better standings ended;
The rabble's lips no longer curst,
But stood agape with horrid thirst;
Thousands of breasts beat horrid hope;
Thousands of eyeballs, lit with hell,
Burnt one way all, to see the rope
Unslacken as the platform fell.
The rope flew tight; and then the roar
Burst forth afresh; less loud, but more
Confused and affrighting than before.
A few harsh tongues for ever led
The common din, the chaos of noises,
But ear could not catch what they said.
As when the realm of the damn'd rejoices
At winning a soul to its will,
That clatter and clangour of hateful voices
Sicken'd and stunn'd the air, until
The dangling corpse hung straight and still.
The show complete, the pleasure past,
The solid masses loosen'd fast:
A thief slunk off, with ample spoil,
To ply elsewhere his daily toil;
A baby strung its doll to a stick;
A mother praised the pretty trick;
Two children caught and hang'd a cat;
Two friends walk'd on, in lively chat;
And two, who had disputed places,
Went forth to fight, with murderous faces. 

They have watered the street,
It shines in the glare of lamps, 
Cold, white lamps, 
And lies
Like a slow-moving river,
Barred with silver and black.
Cabs go down it,
One,
And then another,
Between them I hear the shuffling of feet.
Tramps doze on the window-ledges,
Night-walkers pass along the sidewalks.
The city is squalid and sinister,
With the silver-barred street in the midst,
Slow-moving,
A river leading nowhere.

Opposite my window,
The moon cuts,
Clear and round,
Through the plum-coloured night.
She cannot light the city:
It is too bright.
It has white lamps,
And glitters coldly.

I stand in the window and watch the
 moon.
She is thin and lustreless,
But I love her.
I know the moon, 
And this is an alien city. 

A lone naked poplar stood aloof,
there was a crowd of crows.
The leaves of a Chinar shook
and the children shouted: 'Caw'caw.'
The crows fled like the wind
and
the branches trembled.
The poplar looked all around
and
found itself alone. 

A lone nightingale
Sheds tears
He hasn’t seen his rose
For years

If a dandelion comes
He cheers
Smells her scent
And peers

She is not around yet
No fears
Till there is her fragrance
He bears

 goat stood by the roadside
Bleating with no credible sympathy tears
In the eyes of men
He bleated and he cried 
No one asked whose goat it was
He looked at the blossoming fodder
Tantalizing him, still his bowels were void

He took his woes in his bleating
To the stream
He stood here throat parched
And his feet deep inside the water
He cried for his countrymen
He cried for himself
And he cried for tomorrow. 

To the moment I can write
In presence of my breath
With evidence of my veins strength
That I feel lonely on earth
Under the roof of almighty
I miss her to the extent
The very extent of my existence.

How to express this moment
Were I am hungry for her
I feel a pain in my heart
It seems to shatter my nerves
I want her in this moment
In this painful moment of tranquility
But she is far as I am. 

I am walking up the road
And seeing all the variegated bushes
With dews cooling my feet
I am in love with its colours
Of green, white, yellow, and green

It is a long journey and 
Without distraction 
I am a few trees away
No blowing gale force
Can swerve my way
And soon this finite journey 
Will see its end. 

Etching it's way across 
the sky
lonely swan in flight

seeking a snow capped 
mountain
On the darkest night. 

As I wake up every morning
My life losses its meaning
Finding you not around
Makes this feeling down
Your smile I miss
And the sweet kiss.

As I go to work
I am feeling broke
Emptiness engulfs me
Though I act happy as can be
Yet your shadow I can see
In all places that I stay.

As I rest into slumber
Your image I remember
So vividly in my mind
Memories you left behind
That I can no longer hold
Teardrops falling so cold. 

I saw thee in a dream, 
Around thou, there was no gleam..
Only thine! On a park down-town, 
Amid the greenery, sown
On a shady field: 'noone saw'.

Thou waken me, and there was no need, 
I had plenty of dreams I had to feed, 
That; I left behind all of them
To reach out thy love’s seed.

Nor oceans and seas, nor continents, 
Nor nights, nor days, nor the miles, 
Would build borders for our dreams, 
And disguise thy lively smiles.

But alas! Thy lofty secrecy. 
Thy impassable boundary, 
Forever thither, forever thine, 
Triggers my mind, like the wine.

But I, have never used that word, 
And I, have never lost my faith.
And for, thy worth is unprizable 
I’ll gain thy soul Saint. 

Saint, that no love can fill the rest
Nor the rest of others’ guests: 
There’re ones, died, and came to grief, 
And thou, never feel any ease.

But, as time flows on and on, 
Thou will taste the youthfulness.
And quite a while, others, 
Won’t get out of old presence.

Thy story – never been told –
Nobody has ever bought or sold
But in all dreams I dreamed, 
Thou were there; as a pure gold.

These are words, I would’ve told long ago, 
And I’m wandering since I wakened up, 
And I wonder, if my heart’ll reach thy soul, 
After the bud, I’ll find, the wonder I look up. 

That is the current that makes machinery, that makes it crackle, what is the current that presents a long line and a necessary waist. What is this current. 

What is the wind, what is it. 

Where is the serene length, it is there and a dark place is not a dark place, only a white and red are black, only a yellow and green are blue, a pink is scarlet, a bow is every color. A line distinguishes it. A line just distinguishes it. 

A long, long sleep, a famous sleep
That makes no show for dawn
By strech of limb or stir of lid, --
An independent one.

Was ever idleness like this?
Within a hut of stone
To bask the centuries away
Nor once look up for noon

Hidden in the shadows of her mind, 
     there are some reasons that the lady cannot find, 
     I could not see them as they were, 
     I didn't see enough,  or read the signs, 
     Her true past is only seen by her, 
   
   as I alone see mine.                                            
   
   I love her still  and guess I will, 
     for quite a long, long time.
 
          There was a space, a special place, 
     where she and I would go, 
     in our hearts were shipwrecked parts, 
     of the journeys we have known.
          Some say that it was meant to be, 
     that ships would run aground, 
     that love would end up lost at sea, 
     with partial dreams not found. 
 
          I wish we could have found the way, 
     and made a different yesterday, 
     I sometimes wish she'd come and talk, 
     I wish that she would walk with me, 
  
  and show me things that I won't see, 
     out in the rainy sunshine. 
          I love her and I guess I will, 
     for quite a long, long, time

Your life may blossom in Love and Peace
Through Love and Struggle you have to go on
You have to march for a brightening future
for the mankind. 

From the day that I met you
I knew I'd love you
Because you hugged me
And opened your heart

Your arms started hurting
From hugging too much
I decided to kiss you
You were so surprised

My old friend saw us
He ran to go tell
But I caught up beside him
And said go to hell! 

She decided to follow me
To a secret place
Where no one could find us
To tattle or tell

I started to talk
But she made me stop
She kissed my lips
And I did so back

She told me to wait
For her to get back
She had to go home
Just for a sec

So I waited and waited
Until it was I waited and waited
Till it started to pour

She finally came back
With some good news at hand
She told me she loved me
She wanted me now! 

I decided to kiss her
After a long wait at dawn
She finally loves me
After all this time

I have words to say
Although she might not know
What i'm about to say
But I have to say it's so


Ich Liebe Dich


When the heart is sad no pleasure in assemblages can be

I seek escape from tumult, my heart desires
The silence which speech may ardently love! 

I vehemently desire silence, I strongly long that
A small hut in the mountain's side may there be

Freed from worry I may live in retirement
Freed from the cares of the world I may be

Birds chirping may give the pleasure of the lyre
In the spring's noise may the orchestra's melody be

Showing the whole world to me this small wine-cup may be

My arm may be my pillow, and the green grass my bed be
Putting the congregation to shame my solitude's quality be

The nightingale be so familiar with my face that
Her little heart harboring no fear from me may be

Avenues of green trees standing on both sides be
The spring's clear water providing a beautiful picture be

The view of the mountain range may be so beautiful
To see it the waves of water again and again rising be

The verdure may be asleep in the lap of the earth
Water running through the bushes may glistening be

Again and again the flowered boughs touching the water be
As if some beauty looking at itself in mirror be

When the sun apply myrtle to the evening's bride
The tunic of every flower may pinkish golden be

When night's travellers falter behind with fatigue
Their only hope my broken earthenware lamp may be

May the lightning lead them to my hut
When clouds hovering over the whole sky be.

The early dawn's cuckoo, that morning's mu'adhdhinMay my confidante he be, and may his confidante I be

May I not be obligated to the temple or to the mosque
May the hut's hole alone herald of morning's arrival be

When the dew may come to perform the flowers' ablution
May wailing my supplication, weeping my ablution be

In this silence may my heart's wailing rise so high
That for stars' caravan the clarion's call my wailing be

May every compassionate heart weeping with me be
Perhaps it may awaken those who may unconscious be


My heart is in the east, and I in the uttermost west. 
How can I find savor in food? How shall it be sweet to me? 
How shall I render my vows and my bonds, while yet 
Zion lieth beneath the fetter of Edom, and I in Arab chains? 
A light thing would it seem to me 
to leave all the good things of Spain - 
Seeing how precious in mine eyes 
to behold the dust of the desolate sanctuary. 

He leaves the warm womb with a cold birth cry
and crawls in hot sun, soaked with icy sweat, 
aware that he who walks as man should
is born twice. 

despite his freewill, he is conscious
he is not so tall that he need never stretch
and not so small that he need never stoop.
his first care is to avoid the reproaches
of his own heart and the second one is
to escape the censures of the world, by making himself
as good as he makes others better. 

this responsibility
not power with which he is born is his last
judgement. 

though he learns all his life
yet MAN dies in ignorance, warring, instead of building
his spiritual status by good thoughts, 
good words and good deeds. 

Learning, Education, and School 


Many years ago, education was much simpler, or so it seemed! 
You had the Three R’s, a red brick school house, and it was clean! 
Then we added courses like Latin and Greek- of how awful- hard to speak, 
Never fear, let us add courses that will help art, shop and Home Ec- for something to eat. 

That’s right, food for thought, 
After all isn’t that is what school is all about. 
For forty plus years we followed that rule, 
We cooked up a great education until finally in the end we listened to the political correctness fools 

We discarded the ingredients that made our school great only to add new programs and policies which promote racism and hate.. 
What happened to our vocational programs, places where we taught our students trades, 
What happened to learning work as part of the dignity of man? 
What happened to learning is easy to see, instead of learning correctly, 
We are learning to fail because we are failing to read, 
Sstudents are porous and need to be reached. 

Essays, standard tests, and computer programs are great, but can they replace touch of loving parents? 
Listen to me, just a cry in the dark, it’s not our schools that are falling apart. 
We have lost our direction and maybe our focus. 

For you see it not your test score that count one, two, and three 
It simply must be the students who learn their A, B, and C’s 
They apply what they learn, not with paper and pen, 
but with hands, hearts, and mind and souls. 
So we can all learn to live together happily once and again. 

You stand there so silently, In the perfect frame of mind
Keeping all my secrets, A friend I always leave behind
You never judge me, And you never let me down
I can count on you, No matter what comes around
When you get a glimpse at me, Tell me, what you see
Do you believe in me, Are you proud of what you see
Mirror, mirror look at me, Tell me with all honesty
Can you reflect on me, Some of your clarity
I’m back so soon, it’s not even noon, And look at me, all foggy
Help me clear the steam, Mirror, I just wanna scream
I can’t see my reflection, I might need your protection
A dark shadow has appeared, And it feels kind of weird
Can you give me some shine, Can I have some of that shimmer
Can you make me sparkle, Like the glitter in your mirror
Help me get it together, Or I’ll shatter into bits
Help me stay whole and silver, Like the backbone in your mirror
Show me the strength that’s left in me, Enough with the crying and self-pity
Help me snip my shadow free, And turn it in to beauty
Mirror mirror can I ask, To leave the mirror of the past
Mirror mirror inside of me, What, reflection, do you see

 
How many words, 
Silently heard, 
Without a sound? 
The feelings rush, 
And Love does crush.
All else, around.

The look of Love, 
How deep it is, 
Volcanic, Passion, 
Turned to bliss
Words absolutely can't compete, 
With looks of Love as two hearts meeta lock of split hair
rests on the fusion of uranium eyes
scaled for its weight
scolded for its freedom
it'll wind with the smoke 
of snake forgotten wisdom
around the trees blast felled down
end up in an atom
no poem can describe
rest silence closed


In the light of the silent stars that shine on the struggling sea, 
In the weary cry of the wind and the whisper of flower and tree, 
Under the breath of laughter, deep in the tide of tears, 
I hear the Loom of the Weaver that weaves the Web of Years. 
 
The leaves of the winter wither and sink in the forest mould 
To colour the flowers of April with purple and white and gold: 
Light and scent and music die and are born again 
In the heart of a grey-haired woman who wakes in a world of pain. 
 
The hound, the fawn, and the hawk, and the doves that croon and coo, 
We are all one woof of the weaving and the one warp threads us through, 
One flying cloud on the shuttle that carries our hopes and fears 
As it goes thro’ the Loom of the Weaver that weaves the Web of Years. 
 
The green uncrumpling fern and the rustling dewdrenched rose 
Pass with our hearts to the Silence where the wings of music close, 
Pass and pass to the Timeless that never a moment mars, 
Pass and pass to the Darkness that made the suns and stars. 
 
Has the soul gone out in the Darkness? Is the dust sealed from sight? 
Ah, hush, for the woof of the ages returns thro’ the warp of the night! 
Never that shuttle loses one thread of our hopes and fears, 
As it comes thro’ the Loom of the Weaver that weaves the Web of Years. 
 
O, woven in one wide Loom thro’ the throbbing weft of the whole, 
One in spirit and flesh, one in body and soul, 
Tho’ the leaf were alone in its falling, the bird in its hour to die, 
The heart in its muffled anguish, the sea in its mournful cry, 
 
One with the flower of a day, one with the withered moon 
One with the granite mountains that melt into the noon 
One with the dream that triumphs beyond the light of the spheres, 
We come from the Loom of the Weaver that weaves the Web of Years. 

So much news, 
So much said, 
And Yet, 
Can you believe
What anyone says? 
Confused and obfuscated, 
We reach for the Truth, 
Knowing, very well it's been murdered, 
In an invisible telephone booth. 

How can my love hold him when the other
Flaunts a gaudy lust and is lioness
To his beast? Men are worthless, to trap them
Use the cheapest bait of all, but never
Love, which in a woman must mean tears
And a silence in the blood. 

I saw her just the other day, 
But, not knowing what to say, I turned away.
For she has lost her only son, 
off fighting in the war.
A bootless war that lingers on
Like a chancre sore.
There are others like her; 
Gold stars in windows shine-
For brave boys brought home in boxes
for "no one’s left behind. "
There’s no word that refers to her
Who has lost her only child.
A remnant who lingers here
the last one of her line.
I’ve seen her tend his graveside
like she once made his childhood bed.
She keeps the flowers watered, 
trims the grass above his head.
In her Living room, a folded flag
A grateful nation’s gift
To remind her of one she loved so
Whose death left her bereft.A loss of something ever felt I—
The first that I could recollect
Bereft I was—of what I knew not
Too young that any should suspect

A Mourner walked among the children
I notwithstanding went about
As one bemoaning a Dominion
Itself the only Prince cast out—

Elder, Today, a session wiser
And fainter, too, as Wiseness is—
I find myself still softly searching
For my Delinguent Palaces—

And a Suspicion, like a Finger
Touches my Forehead now and then
That I am looking oppositely
For the site of the Kingdom of Heaven—A lost and lonely boy
with nothing but his dreams
born into poverty
and a mother with collapsed vains

He watches her stick needles
between her toes
her eyes roll back
with ecstacy and pain
all he's left with is battered piano keys
on the rooms back wall

He plays those keys
to the rhythm of a rasp
his mother calls breathing
he plays those keys
for the love he should have had

This was is life
from a child to eighteen
no friends no love
just those piano keys

Then by chance
someone knocked on the door
said they'd just heard
someone playing the piano
like they'd never heard before
said they'd sign him right then and there
he never looked back
as he stepped out and closed the door

Sometimes he thinks back
to that lost and lonely boy
and thinks his life is all a dream

But then he hears Eric Clapton shout
we're on in ten minutes  
and he knows it's not a dream


When first we met she seemed so white
I feared her;
As one might near a spirit bright
I neared her;
An angel pure from heaven above
I dreamed her,
And far too good for human love
I deemed her.
A spirit free from mortal taint
I thought her,
And incense as unto a saint
I brought her.

Well, incense burning did not seem
To please her,
And insolence I feared she’d deem
To squeeze her;
Nor did I dare for that same why
To kiss her,
Lest, shocked, she’d cause my eager eye
To miss her.
I sickened thinking of some way
To win her,
When lo! she asked me, one fine day,
To dinner!

Twas thus that made of common flesh
I found her,
And in a mortal lover’s mesh
I wound her.
Embraces, kisses, loving looks
I gave her,
And buying bon-bons, flowers and books,
I save her;
For her few honest, human taints
I love her,
Nor would I change for all the saints
Above her
Those eyes, that little face, that so
Endear her,
And all the human joy I know
When near her;
And I am glad, when to my breast
I press her,
She’s just a woman, like the rest,

SEATED one day at the Organ,
    I was weary and ill at ease,
  And my fingers wandered idly
    Over the noisy keys.

  I do not know what I was playing,
    Or what I was dreaming then ;
  But I struck one chord of music,
    Like the sound of a great Amen.

  It flooded the crimson twilight,
  Like the close of an Angel's Psalm,
And it lay on my fevered spirit
  With a touch of infinite calm.

It quieted pain and sorrow,
  Like love overcoming strife ;
It seemed the harmonious echo
  From our discordant life.

It linked all perplexed meanings
  Into one perfect peace,
And trembled away into silence
  As if it were loth to cease.

I have sought, but I seek it vainly,
  That one lost chord divine,
Which came from the soul of the Organ,
  And entered into mine.

It may be that Death's bright angel
  Will speak in that chord again,
It may be that only in Heaven
  I shall hear that grand Amen. 

I was at night asleep
On my creaking bed
And a  sack of dreams
Tore upon my head.

I cuddled them and 
At the crack of the dawn
I remembered but one
And when I took it in my hands
It jumped and flew away 
Into the valley and the hills
Where a rainbow germinates
And blooms like a rising summer sun.

As close as  I thought I could touch the rainbow
It fizzled away and I lost him
As I lost my dream
Where is this dream? 
 That gave me a red herring
At death's door that I stood knocking
So that I give him his humble pie
For the prognosis of falsehood
Now that I am alive and cheerful
To tell the dream. 

MY friend he was; my friend from all the rest; 
With childlike faith he oped to me his breast; 
No door was locked on altar, grave or grief; 
No weakness veiled, concealed no disbelief; 
The hope, the sorrow and the wrong were bare, 
And ah, the shadow only showed the fair! 

I gave him love for love; but, deep within, 
I magnified each frailty into sin: 
Each hill-topped foible in the sunset glowed, 
Obscuring vales where rivered virtttes flowed. 
Reproof became reproach, till common grew 
The captious word at every fault I knew. 
He smiled upon the censorship, and bore 
With patient love the touch that wounded sore; 
Until at length, so had my blindness grown, 
He knew I judged him by his faults alone.

Alone, of all men, I who knew him best, 
Refused the gold, to take the dross for test! 
Cold strangers honored for the worth they saw; 
His friend forgot the diamond in the flaw. 

At last it came—the day he stood apart 
When from my eyes he proudly veiled his heart; 
When carping judgment and uncertain word 
A stern resentment in his bosom stirred; 
When in his face I read what I had been, 
And with his vision saw what he had seen. 

Too late! too late! Oh, could he then have known, 
When his love died, that mine had perfect grown; 
That when the veil was drawn, abased, chastised, 
The censor stood, the lost one truly prized. 

Too late we learn—a man must hold his friend 
Unjudged, accepted, trusted to the end. 

It takes so long to get there
Like madness to be too late. 
Fragile, fragile onset, 
Captured in the avenue of delay. 

Like a paper-cut-by surprise
You make a break and then you bleed
And then you find a band-aid
And wrap it tightly to your wound. 

Dare there be a reason
To withdraw one resolution
You can't-the pain is always there
Remaining with no solution. 


The air was heavy and still and warm -
It fell to me and a man I know,
To see two girls to their father's farm.

There was little seeing, that I recall:
We seemed to grope in a cave profound.
They might have come by a painful fall,
Had we not helped them over the ground.

The girls were sisters. Both were fair,
But mine was the fairer (so I say).
The dark soon severed us, pair from pair,
And not long after we lost our way.

We wandered over the country-side,
And we frightened most of the sheep about,
And I do not think that we greatly tried,
Having lost our way, to find it out.

The night being fine, it was not worth while.
We strayed through furrow and corn and grass
We met with many a fence and stile,
And a quickset hedge, which we failed to pass.

At last we came on a road she knew;
She said we were near her father's place.
I heard the steps of the other two,
And my heart stood still for a moment's space.

Then I pleaded, `Give me a good-night kiss.'
I have learned, but I did not know in time,
The fruits that hang on the tree of bliss
Are not for cravens who will not climb.

We met all four by the farmyard gate,
We parted laughing, with half a sigh,
And home we went, at a quicker rate,
A shorter journey, my friend and I.

When we reached the house, it was late enough,
And many impertinent things were said,
Of time and distance, and such dull stuff,
But we said little, and went to bed.

We went to bed, but one at least
Went not to sleep till the black turned grey,
And the sun rose up, and the light increased,
And the birds awoke to a summer day.

And sometimes now, when the nights are mild,
And the moon is away, and no stars shine,
I wander out, and I go half-wild,
To think of the kiss which was not mine.

Let great minds laugh at a grief so small,
Let small minds laugh at a fool so great.
Kind maidens, pity me, one and all.
Shy youths, take warning by this my fate. 

Last night I had this amazing poem, 
stuck in my head, 
But much to tired, I thought, "Oh I’ll remember."
and jumped into bed! 
Now this morning, try as I may, 
I cannot remember, 
what this poem was about! 
Love


snow-or winter! 
I wish I could remember because it was
both beautiful and bright, 
If only I had taken the time 
to simply sit and write! 
Now you my dear reader, 
will simply have to trust, 
This poem was lovely, 
but now its not here, 
And this poem about nothing 
is merely a distorted mirror, 
Of what this perfect poem
Was to be, 
But I guess we’ll just have to imagine, 
Both you, and me.

To all the poems that should have been, but we were to lazy to write them.   

So long since writing was his passion
That passion was gone after facing many problems
Problems which made him be a total different person
Soon, words were gone with the wind

Wanting to return to his old him
Simply could just not be
Trying would drag him deeper into the new

Life gave him other opportunities 
Opportunities, which he liked 
New routes, new people, new situations, 
A different world, the one he knew it would give him fortune

Now that old poet has almost forgotten his roots
A businessman he is now, a guy in a suit and tie.
Wearing fancy designer clothes
Where did the casual, simple guy go? 

Facing new problems and dealing with his boss
He now sits back, reflects and remembers the old him
How could he have stopped doing the things he loved the most? 
Being simple and not carrying so much about things
He barely noticed he has grown and time has passed
Too soon he thinks, kinda missed part of life.

There is no going back, he knows that 
All he wants is some free time
A moment to kick back and DJ again
Write again, be inspired.
For a day or two is enough

Grateful for what he has achieved 
Sad for what he has given up
Time should be found, 
Find a moment to do those things all over again 
Enjoy once more-The flowers
have lost
their petals.

Found refuge
somewhere
on a distant 
shore.

Now the
season has
changed.

The grass
is lush and
green.

Tiny buds
awaken from
their winter's
nap.

A relationship
lost.

'Found-old ring'
Someone out there is lost without a ring. 
That  to another one meant everything
Didn't it match? didn't it fit? 
It is gone-did it ever exist? 
The jewels that lay scattered over the floor
The barehanded people cannot endure. 

The anguish
Of reducing such sentiment
To the lever of littered pavement
Where eyes casting downward  must look to see
The intimation deserted lately
Each symbol makes  further testimony
In the trial of what was meant to be. 

Who found it? 
Let me  meet the one who knew its meaning
Because I suspect the recovering
Was not fortune-nor coincidence
Nor  the just act of Providence
But that one who possesses it in fact
Was the one who I gave to and took it back. 

The hope that it meant anything has left
With the article stolen in the theft
But I can't stop searching again. 
Anymore, 
Than I can believe it never happened
The emotion rests now with conviction
A life sentence of that consecration. 


A poetic voice emerged to
Recite a verse melodious 
So clear and audible to mind.

The epiphany woke me up stunned
Alas! Memory retained not a line
Quick was its' loss in a swift blink 
Like a song of impish wind chime.


e look inside ourselves for the answers to her questionable behavior 
Because twenty is too young to be so old and too old to still be innocent
But because we love her we try to understand that which cannot be understood
Lies and untruths abound whenever she is around
Her pain is our pain
But unlike a scraped elbow or knee this pain cannot be kissed and made all better
This pain is like a knife in our hearts
This pain screams and demands to be heard
This pain is invisible but demands to be seen
And so
We look in the mirror every morning and fail to recognize ourselves
She is our only child so how could we be the parents she describes us as
We are loving people and give her everything she wants except discipline
We are forgiving but what she wants most of all is punishment for her sins
She hates us for loving her 
Maybe we just expected she’d love us in return
Maybe it’s true we did and still do

Love her too much


A lotus dreams of pollination
far from the fast streams. 
My lotus pose for meditation
provokes insects and bees
to come, alight and look
for nectar, pollen, seeds
and so disturb my concentration, 
ignore my higher needs
and bring a Buddha-smile to my face
by tickling tenderly my heels.  

He leant against a lamp-post, lost
In some mysterious reverie:
His head was bowed; his arms were crossed;
He yawned, and glanced evasively:
Uncrossed his arms, and slowly put
Them back again, and scratched his side--
Shifted his weight from foot to foot,
And gazed out no-ward, idle-eyed.

Grotesque of form and face and dress,
And picturesque in every way--
A figure that from day to day
Drooped with a limper laziness;
A figure such as artists lean,
In pictures where distress is seen,
Against low hovels where we guess
No happiness has ever been. 

It was merely coincidental, 
that we met in the hospital.
I work as staff in the laboratory, 
while you stay at the dormitory.
Then we set near the lobby, 
as you became my hubby.

It was surely substantial, 
to talked about commercial.
You gave me your number, 
am sure mine you remember.
First we exchanged innate thought, 
later its love notes we often sought.

It was clearly incidental, 
kept an affair confidential.
Our secret had gone fonder, 
each mating we were bolder.
We ventured the seas of fantasy, 
as we savored the nectar of ecstasy.

Now what remains are memories, 
an elicit affair in forbidden love stories.  
Yet ours was sweet destiny to cherish, 
a kind of love affair that cannot vanish.
It may be wrong to the eyes of morality, 
but who is perfect in love in this society

On that November noon, as we drove in
To my home town, at the foot of Shivalik hills.
I realised, why it is so close to my heart, 
This is where my parents gave me a start.

So many fond memories come rushing in.
It seems yesterday I was a kid creating din.
My nephew who had got posted to my town, 
Urged me, Aunt why don’t you come down.

Saying, he had waited to see the city, 
And through my eyes, built memories
I recall he was tall, lanky and all of ten, 
When he came for my wedding celebrations.

Now he is a renowned heart surgeon, 
Kind, compassionate and a genial person.
I rang him when a family wedding took me there, 
Well son, let me show you around now that I am here.

So we drove into the city beautiful.
For mid November it was pretty cool.
My heart was swelling with pride, 
As I pointed to him different sights.

Rose garden here is best you will find
In entire Asia, don’t look surprised.
Big, small, frail, exotic, pale multi hued, 
Flowers were covered with droplets of dew. 

Later we drove to my sprawling alma mater
And showed him where I got my love for literature
Recounting tales of our famous escapades
How my bespectacled professor regaled

Us while teaching us in his inimitable style Yeats.
Oh, how overwhelmed I felt once inside the gates.
Later I told him lets just park the Chevrolet, 
And pay some money to the attendant.

We walked at a leisurely pace, and I pointed out, 
Library, auditorium and canteen- our favourite haunt
Steaming hot cups of tea and samosas
Can you believe all for just thirty paise? 

The avenue was lined with eucalyptus trees, 
Birds were chirping flitting about free.
As we caught with each others lives, 
We realised we had come far and walked miles.

We had reached a village with dense mango groves
We lingered and amused watched cocks and crows
As we drove back home, I said much hasn’t changed, 
Although I have been away from here for decades-

This is an affair that began in childhood
i would like to settle here if i could. 

City Beautiful- Chandigarh

Out of the starless night that covers me,
(O tribulation of the wind that rolls!)
Black as the cloud of some tremendous spell,
The susurration of the sighing sea 
Sounds like the sobbing whisper of two souls
That tremble in a passion of farewell.

To the desires that trebled life in me,
(O melancholy of the wind that rolls!)
The dreams that seemed the future to foretell,
The hopes that mounted herward like the sea,
To all the sweet things sent on happy souls,
I cannot choose but bid a mute farewell.

And to the girl who was so much to me
(O lamentation of this wind that rolls!)
Since I may not the life of her compel, 
Out of the night, beside the sounding sea,
Full of the love that might have blent our souls,
A sad, a last, a long, supreme farewell. 

An old picture I hold in my hand.
It’s me and you and our love-frozen in time.
A silent witness, after many years, of a great love that no longer exists.

I ask myself, where is all this great love now? 
Where are you now? 

Don't ask me if was the truth when I told that I loved you.
Yes, I am sure that I loved you.
But if you saw me now, you would see another person.
It's no longer the man who told you that.
It was me many years ago.
Now that man doesn't exist anymore.
That man changed, as everything changes in this world.

The universe is a big recycling machine; nothing remains the same forever.
How many "frozen in time" moments in my life. 
I see my face in the mirror and my face in the pictures.
Oh yes, it must be many moments; 
every one different from the other.
Every picture with a story to tell, 
a story to remind oneself of something for a moment; 
something big or small, good or bad, important or not.

This picture speaks for an immense love written in my heart.

A great love-frozen in time. 

It’s a love hate relationship
It’s been like this from the start
He lied to me, tricked my heart
Took my innocence and left me to have no choice
Took control of me his was the only voice
But, now I must sadly regret
He had lustful eyes the day we met
This is a love hate relationship
This is where its at
I want to lay down so bad
And if I don’t, he’ll push me onto my back
If I try to resist the house will echo a loud smack
He talks to me like I’m his property
He touched me like he paid the fee
And when we argue 
He holds up his ring
Tries to explain what marriage means
It’s a love hate relationship 
He tells me respect is what I lack
And if I laugh
It’ll be nothing but a blood bath
I’m not ashamed to admit I was wrong
And now the nights feel so long
It’s a love hate relationship 
I hate to love him
And he loves to hate me
His hostile eyes full of rage
His anger builds up as he takes the stage
I go through what we had 
I realize there is no reason to get mad
One day I’ll just get even
Hurt him till he’s on his knees pleading
Look at what we have 
Common now this abuse is just sad
I let go
Yea, this is the end
A love hate relationship will now just be my past
Because that kind of relationship could never last


A letter intended for someone, received, 
The post man clouded with confused doubts, 
As the letter was registered, a sign needed, 
When the cloaked person's same old pen signed, 
The post man smiled at his pretentious friend, 
Whom he knew for many months, the elf, 
Changed into a seraph, fully made up, 
when The sleeve was pulled up, wrinkles seen, 
The same old name carried same old IC number, 
He scratched his head with unbelief, 
Why a person must put make up as old and young, 
Even at his own home, either he wanted to impress, 
Himself or fool the visitors who are unaware. 

Phoebus make haste, the day's too long, begone, 
The silent night's the fittest time for moan; 
But stay this once, unto my suit give ear, 
And tell my griefs in either Hemisphere: 
(And if the whirling of thy wheels do n't drown'd 
The woful accents of my doleful sound), 
If in thy swift career thou canst make stay, 
I crave this boon, this errand by the way: 
Commend me to the man more lov'd than life, 
Show him the sorrows of his widow'd wife, 
My dumpish thoughts, my groans, my brackish tears, 
My sobs, my longing hopes, my doubting fears, 
And, if he love, how can he there abide? 
My interest's more than all the world beside. 
He that can tell the stars or Ocean sand, 
Or all the grass that in the meads do stand, 
The leaves in th' woods, the hail or drops of rain, 
Or in a cornfield number every grain, 
Or every mote that in the sunshine hops, 
May court my sighs and number all my drops. 
Tell him, the countless steps that thou dost trace, 
That once a day thy spouse thou mayst embrace; 
And when thou canst not treat by loving mouth, 
Thy rays afar, salute her from the south. 
But for one month I see no day (poor soul) 
Like those far situate under the pole, 
Which day by day long wait for thy arise, 
O how they joy when thou dost light the skies. 
O Phoebus, hadst thou but thus long from thine 
Restrain'd the beams of thy beloved shine, 
At thy return, if so thou couldst or durst, 
Behold a Chaos blacker than the first. 
Tell him here's worse than a confused matter, 
His little world's a fathom under water, 
Naught but the fervor of his ardent beams 
Hath power to dry the torrent of these streams. 
Tell him I would say more, but cannot well, 
Opressed minds abrupted tales do tell. 
Now post with double speed, mark what I say, 
By all our loves conjure him not to stay. 

I wrote this for you, 
So you wouldn't forget me, 
Remember the way it had to be.

I drowned in your eyes, 
And tasted your sweet lips, 
Touched your hair, 
With my cold finger tips.

You felt the same, 
And thought he is the one, 
We would be together, 
But we where torn apart by the gun.

I lay here in a pool of my own blood, 
Wishing that you would be here, 
I tried to reach for you picture, 
So I could see plain and clear.
Why I held you so dear.

Those deep eyes I've drowned in, 
Those sweet lips I've kissed, 
The softness of your hair, 
That is what I have missed. 

I am enjoyed in my heart
When you send messages
From a far world from here
A tropic climate that I knew
But managing yourself there to feed us
And keep us happy here in village
Where we find you in photographs
And prays well for your goodness
I love you ever in life, in my dreams
Whether it is day or night no concern
I am enjoyed in my heart
When you call me in phone at night
I loves you as my own, ever in life. 

We chase love, all of our lives, 
in case you are wondering, that is ALL of our lives.  . 

Do we do what it takes to earn it? 
Do you do what it takes and burn it? 

Do we seek a love that always is approved? 
Do we seek a love that is tried and proved? 

If this we do, we always lose, 
all goes to hell, drugs and booze.  . 

Here is a message, well hidden from you, 
The only REAL LOVE is found in a paradox stew! 

Seek not those who love you, 
love those who seek you, who accept you, who let you fly, 
Those who see you as perfect, who see you as goddess high! 
Woman, you have no flaws, those who see that illusion, 
are the lowly rodents to avoid, avoid a collision.

You have nothing to change, you got it going on, 
Only me and we need pull our dark sunglasses off.
Your ways are right your ways are smooth, 
When we open our pure eyes, you are the balm that soothes! 

Only take love, the kind that takes you as you are, 
You are perfect in all ways, I see no scars.

Perfect you are, woman divine
Never change a thing, you are perfectly sublime! 

How lucky would be a soul, if your love they snatched, 
The magic is whispered here:   NSA, NSA, NSA ~~~

(no strings attached)Like the earth needs the sun
I don’t need you for fun
Like the night needs the star
I need you for what you are
Like a religion needs a pray
Our love is needless to say
Like a human needs water
The bond ship will be forever
Like a baby needs milk
We have got all the perks
It’s not a jerk
To say what’s left for us
Is just
A love or bust


Man! ! 
You are so serious
You never say nothing  funny
You  love too much talking
Never giving me a chance to say
Anything.
(though I ain't got nothing to say)    

You  love talking  about your self
You  love talking  about Philosophy
Two subjects-
Which make me feel sleepy.

You know what? 
After all this time
I think I thought of something to say to you.

I love you, but you are boring. 

You and me
me and you
flower-bee
grass and dew. 

I love you with the slowest love
on earth, love embedded
in the mineral existence of canyons
and chasms, stretching across continents
and centuries past counting.

I love you with the patience
of a gardener who waits
sixty years for one flower
to bloom. Through sleet, 
through scorching sunrays, 
he lavishes his lonely care.
And on a dim morning 
of his old age, a scarlet flower
shines. No longer alone, he breathes
its bright fragrance as night descends.

I love you with my love of books
because reading long hours of solitude, 
turning page after pages brings 
ever closer the secret of delight, 
until it is revealed to one alert
to the other language of composition, 
a parallel language not of words
but of alien sounds audible only
to the lover's inmost hearing, poised
to change very character into
the beloved. Every book I touch
becomes our love story.

I love you with the passage of night
into day. Flung against columns 
of darkness, I stumble across blank fields, 
through waters without memory, up hills
wit no vistas. I drop to my knees and grope, 
a blind man yearning for your light.
And suddenly I see your face in a star-cluster! 
The stars fade into morning. I arise
and your presence is still warm 
with their distant fires. I greet you
suffused in beams of sunlight.(after reading a New York Times article re 
              a mummy kept preserved for about years) 

I'm gonna get me some mummy tape for your love 
preserve it for years or more 
I'm gonna let the world see you 
tapping a blue shell dance of love 
I'm gonna ride your love bareback 
on totem poles 
bear your image on mountains 
turning in ocean sleep 
string your sighs thru the rainbow 
of old age. 
In the midst of desert people and times 
I'm gonna fly your red/eagle/laughter 'cross the sky. 

I love the wildcats
I love their wild bedroom combats
The truth is I am a love rat
I like to talk the sweet love chat 
Flattery and chitchat is my lyrical loving format

I love them slim, I love them fat
I love them round, I love them flat
The truth is I am a love rat
Even the hornies that don't take a bath
I will still bow down and take off my hat

I know by heart the path
To the many wishes of a ladies heart
But I crawl in and out of my holes
With a lusty wandering heartless soul
So allow me to fly you to the higest pole

I give tit for tat
I could reward you with a lovely pat
You see loving a woman is a form of art
Take your time or right from the start
You will get slapped or spat at

Some call me a smooth talker
Some call me a love stalker
I can be your house or tomcat
I can be your relishing doormat
I am a love rat
And that is that

I'll make your heart drum beat by beat
I'll fondle you and care for you bit by bit
And when you my lovely baby flower fades
Paddle away I shall & farewell I will bade

- Sylvia Chidi


To your love, 
You really got me addicted, 
Like I never predicted. 
I thought it was a blessing from above, 
But, by leaving me alone, 
In me, a big wound you inflicted
Leaving me dried and cold like a stone. 

Things were so different
When you were around, 
When you were so near, 
Feeling so secure and without fear. 
Thinking about a love so different
I thought I finally found. 

Now, alone, my shaking body, 
Asks for you in the middle of the night, 
When I don't know where you are. 
I ask the moon or any star
Of you, to find. I might. 
So, to my frighten body
I can give an honest response
While listening to another song. 

Brokenhearted now, 
No knowing which is worse: 
The medication or the decease
Now, stuck with a prescription, 
That already expired, 
And can no longer be refilled, 
I find myself, getting old and tired. 
Dealing everyday with my addiction
And the true love for you, I still feel. 


Who's going to want it now, 
In that condition? 
It was once a delicacy
But look- it's spoiled! 

We should get rid of it
As soon as possible
Throw it away
Far, far away
Bury it if you can. 

The traces will no linger
More than a few days or hours. 
We will replace it easily
At the super-market. 

Each season
Brings a new variety
Freshly harvested crops
Rosy with sunshine
Waiting their turn. 


Except for the future, no more, 
With a head so heavy now, 
When I seem unlike myself
And so unsure of all that
I could not have seen
Beckoning to your open door. 

I know there must be words to explain
But I cannot reach them anymore
Close enough to assemble a phrase
Sounding out like I did before.
Trying to repair our wounds
Through a message that could endure. 

I am he, I am he, your lover
For now and eternity
Since before us there are days
To gather each fruit of possibility
And coming closer to each other, 
We will the nearer to heaven be
Beholding a beautiful sight
Of Love and Peace for always
Surrounding us with  a holy light
And blessed forever after, 
Together like we were meant to be.
Don't be afraid at all
And give Love and Peace a chance. 


To know of your whereabouts, 
I asked the moon about you
And it turned its back on me, , 
Trying to hide behind a cloud. 
I also asked the stars
With no response at all. 
I had no choice, indeed, 
But ask for help from above, 
Since, witnesses they were both
Of our passionate love. 
Now, stuck with inquire without result, 
I am alone, sad and really hurt, 
Making everything sounds like a satire, 
Getting old and tired. 
One question remaining, 
Should I give up
Love's matters
And retire? 
Her, and the whole world
Have the response. 


And I was the sun, 
I was a gardener
And you a beautiful rose. 
You were the diamond
And I was the ring. 
Two bodies, one soul
Great moments we shared
And I still recall. 
The time we spent together
Was not  a waste of time at all. 
For one reason or another, 
Love became a game, 
Strategies were not exchanged
Since it was just your game
You tried to drive me insane
But little did you know
Things drastically have changed
For, I am far from being the same. 
Now, we are heading some where
But not on the same lane. 


A reputation well earned
I am going places
But baby, let's face it

Without you there's really
Nowhere to go
Whatever I do
I keep thinking of you

You may not know it
But it's the truth
I would trade all my fortune
For a kiss from you


Honesty is the best gift
Anyone can give on Earth! 
I have nothing more 
Than honesty
To give you totally! 
From the bottom of my heart
I loved you passionately yesterday
And I still do so today! 

Distance and loneliness
Became our common destiny
When time passes by rapidly
And the furious fire
That once existed in us
Turned into sadden ashes
Spread all over by the wind! 
Only sweet memories remain
Of those golden years
We happily spent together! 

Now, we can rebuilt
Over the same dusty ground
A more solid structure, 
Stronger than ever
By learning from those
Silly mistakes we made yesterday! 
Learn to fall in love again
With one another
Embedded with the same
Or more intensity
Of those golden years! 

 I have never left
From your now barren heart, 
To all your friends 
You have confessed
A thousand times
And likewise, 
You should know
That you still vividly live
Within my heart and mind! 
In my dreams you are trapped
Every single night! 
The proof of my great love for you
Is clearly shown
Now, you have a decision to make
If you want to come back to me! 


For anytime I had a doubt
I knew when I thought of love
The scale would balance out

This imaginary instrument 
Swayed in my head
Kept me occupied
When a man turned his head

Many possibilities were weighed
Maybe I added on a few
The scale never failed me
Until I fell for you

Even though I contemplate
And look for reasons we should fail
My thoughts only turn to love
And you, you break my scale

Your beauty, reasons, and possibilities
Weigh a million pounds
And the risks, bitterness, and pain
Go crashing toward the ground


Love has its secrets, joy has its revealings.
How shall I speak of that which love has hid?
If my beloved shall return to greet me,
Deeds shall be done for her none ever did.

My beloved loved me. How shall I reveal it?
We were alone that morning in the street.
She looked down at the ground, and blushed, and trembled.
She stopped me with her eyes when these did meet.

What wouldst thou, sweet one? What wouldst thou with sorrow,
Thou, the new morning star with me, the night?
What are those flowers thou holdest to thy bosom?
What are the thoughts thou hidest from my sight?''

Thine are these flowers,'' she said, these foolish roses,
And thine the thoughts, if thus it be thy will.
I hold them close for fear that thou shouldst mock me,
I hold them to my heart for fear of ill.''

Nay, what of ill? 'Tis only age is evil,
Only forgetfulness and grief and pain;
What dost thou know of grief, that thou shouldst fear it?
Mine is the grief who cannot love again.''

She raised her eyes, she looked at me in wonder,
The ache is here,'' she said, by night and day;
I cannot teach my heart to bear its burden,
I cannot turn my silence from its way.''

Speak to me, child. I am thy wise physician,
A man acquainted with all grief can teach;
There is no sorrow but has joy for sister,
No silence but finds counterpart in speech.''

My beloved laughed. She saw through my dissembling;
She held to me her hand, that I might kiss,
The inside of her hand. 'Twas like a petal
Of her own roses, but more dear than this.

I felt its pulses, like a bird in prison;
Sweet child,'' I said, what wouldst thou I should prove?
I cannot make thee wiser than thy wisdom,
Who knowest all things since thou knowest love.''

How shall I tell it? How shall I reveal it?
I led her by the hand, as thus I said,
Back from the street to where it stood, my dwelling,
And closed the door on where it stood, my bed.

Her laughter stopped. Nay, use not thou unkindly.
Thine is the hand to deal or spare the blame;
I dare not be to thee thus uninvited,
Thou dost not know me, hast not learned my name.''

How shall I tell it? How shall I reveal it?
Love in that instant found its latest birth,
Soul of my soul,'' I cried, thy name is Pleasure,
The sweetest thing to love on this sad Earth.''

I held her in my arms, I pressed her fastly.
Ah, if thou lovedst me indeed,'' she cried.
I love thee, and I love thee,'' was my answer,
My sister, my beloved one, my bride!''

Love has its secrets. Joy has its revealings.
I speak of this which love in vain has hid;
If my beloved shall return to greet me,
Deeds shall be done for her none ever did. 

I love you Poetry, 
My Destiny, so close to me, 
In graying rain or shining sun, 
You are my love, my only one, 
We go together everywhere, 
We think alike, 
Our likes, dislikes, 
Express ourselves, 
In candid verse, 
And when it's time, 
To write our dreams, 
We always flow into extremes, 
For Love is our priority, 
My one and only, Poetry, 
With you I'll go just anywhere, 
As long as for me, you still care. 

A stir of emotions, thoughts racing through-
Can't help but keep my mind on you.
Giving a little, in hopes of a lot, 
I'm praying I am good enough
While watching eyes that watch me back, 
I wait for cues on which to act.
This touch and go is terrifying
In shades of grey, I search the underlying..
For reasons you may change your mind, 
In hopes I may find out in time..
To turn and run like I had planned to, 
Though I don't want this piece to fall through.
And while I see I need you, I am always hiding.
So in you I take this chance, and to you I am confiding.
Love me slowly, a love so kind.
And please don't leave my heart behind.(pt  
We seem so indifferent
Like we just don't feel
We've got cuts on our hearts
That will never heal
Beautiful as a train wreck
In that confusing way
Stuck in reverse
Living on yesterdays
We fall into the darkness
And drown in the sea
No love has ever been so tragic
As the love between you and me

(pt  
Your gorgeous as you always are
So beautiful no one could believe
That you could find such beauty
In someone like me
But we paint a pretty picture
We make it look so nice
With hearts hard as stone
And eyes carved from ice
Seperated only by distance
Our beauty envied by the stars
Our story so original
The tragedy of what we are

(pt  
Pick me up and carry me
Through our sweet abyss
Shroud me in your fantasy
Its not like I'll be missed
Give me all your heart
Your perfect in my imperfections
Look in the mirror and see it
That beautiful reflection
So we'll dance our way to freedom
We'll dance until we die
Forever framed in beauty
The tragedy of you and IThe moon comes forth, bright in the sky;
A lovelier sight to draw my eye
Is she, that lady fair.
She round my heart has fixed love's chain,
But all my longings are in vain.
'Tis hard the grief to bear.

The moon comes forth, a splendid sight;
More winning far that lady bright,
Object of my desire!
Deep-seated is my anxious grief;
In vain I seek to find relief;
While glows the secret fire.

The rising moon shines mild and fair;
More bright is she, whose beauty rare
My heart with longing fills.
With eager wish I pine in vain;
O for relief from constant pain,
Which through my bosom thrills!


'Do you see over my shoulders falling, 
Snake-like ringlets waving free? 
Have no fear, for they are twisted 
To allure you unto me.' 

Thus she spoke, the gentle dove, 
Listen to your plighted love: 
'Oh, how long I wait, till my sweetheart comes back,' she said, 
'Laying his caressing hand underneath my burning head.

'Reject me not if I should say to you
I do forget the sounding of your voice,  
I do forget your eyes that searching through  
The mists perceive our marriage, and rejoice.  
 
Yet, when the apple-blossom opens wide
Under the pallid moonlight’s fingering,  
I see your blanched face at my breast, and hide  
My eyes from diligent work, malingering.  
 
Ah, then, upon my bedroom I do draw  
The blind to hide the garden, where the moon
Enjoys the open blossoms as they straw  
Their beauty for his taking, boon for boon.  
 
And I do lift my aching arms to you,  
And I do lift my anguished, avid breast,  
And I do weep for very pain of you,
And fling myself at the doors of sleep, for rest.  
 
And I do toss through the troubled night for you,  
Dreaming your yielded mouth is given to mine,  
Feeling your strong breast carry me on into  
The peace where sleep is stronger even than wine. 

What have I to say to you
When we shall meet?
Yet—
I lie here thinking of you.

The stain of love
Is upon the world.
Yellow, yellow, yellow,
It eats into the leaves,
Smears with saffron
The horned branches that lean
Heavily
Against a smooth purple sky.

There is no light—
Only a honey-thick stain
That drips from leaf to leaf
And limb to limb
Spoiling the colours
Of the whole world.

I am alone.
The weight of love
Has buoyed me up
Till my head
Knocks against the sky.

See me!
My hair is dripping with nectar—
Starlings carry it
On their black wings.
See, at last
My arms and my hands
Are lying idle.

How can I tell
If I shall ever love you again
As I do now

Tell me no more of thy love, papeeha,
Wouldst thou recall to my heart, papeeha,
Dreams of delight that are gone,
When swift to my side came the feet of my lover
With stars of the dusk and the dawn?
I see the soft wings of the clouds on the river,
And jewelled with raindrops the mango-leaves quiver,
And tender boughs flower on the plain.
But what is their beauty to me, papeeha,
Beauty of blossom and shower, papeeha,
That brings not my lover again? 
Tell me no more of thy love, papeeha,
Wouldst thou revive in my heart, papeeha
Grief for the joy that is gone?
I hear the bright peacock in glimmering woodlands
Cry to its mate in the dawn;
I hear the black koel's slow, tremulous wooing,
And sweet in the gardens the calling and cooing
Of passionate bulbul and dove
But what is their music to me, papeeha
Songs of their laughter and love, papeeha,
To me, forsaken of love

In my minds
Eye
You are ever
Present

As a shadow
Hovering
Over me

Holding my
Heart
In your
Grip

Weaving a
Spell
Of magic

Loving from
Afar
Your forever
Casting a
Love spell.

What is this? That makes me warm and fuzzy inside, 
It’s beginning to be something I cannot hide, 

When I hear your name my heart begins to rush, 
I think this is more than just a crush, 

When you smile I feel so good, 
I would change this feeling if only I could, 

Are these feelings really true? 
As I think I’m falling in love with you. 




L-iving for someone dear
O-ffering unconditonal passion
V-alueing one's right so fair
E-nduring pains and depressions.

T-eaching the heart to be fair
H-ealing with gentle communication
A-cting what your heart declare
T-ouching with prudent conviction. 

E-ntwined with forgiveness flare
N-urtured with tender passion
D-evelop with motives so clear
U-nderstanding amidst confusion
R-esolve to be always just and fair
E-ndures to serve even at oblivion
S-acred vow to serve without fear. 

we did see it in
each others eyes
the love which
we never shared in words
ours
was a love
that never spoke
though we did. .. 

I have a love I would die for
and they say their love is real.
Would they step in front of an arrow shot? 
for this love they proclaim for me to feel.

I wouldn't want to test fates waters
of this depth of love they've now shown.
But if the chips were down
would their love for me last and grow? 

Romeo had Juliet, lover's poison passed their lips
I see couples that seem as close as this
they seemed joined together at the hip.

Life and love will be what it is to be
it will grow or it might fall apart.
It is all really, what one has stored deep inside, 
stored deep within their heart. 

We stole each others heart away, 
With hope, with dreams and care; 
E'er knowing love would pave the way
For blissful times we'd share.

So oft we trod those peaceful hills, 
When love was sweet and new; 
Twas there that passion lit the spark
From whence our family grew.

Then death made claim, that fated day, 
Amidst the tears we cried
And now, my dear, I see so clear, 
Our love has never died.

To soon, in time I'll follow you
Across that great divide; 
Together now, forevermore, 
Together, side by side.

he sun keep on shining high
With sweet and tender smiles
As melody of rhythm fill the sky
with scents of joy more than mile.

I never thought I could ever sigh
with needles of pains every while
As the wind whispers me to fly
the tears of sorrows in my eyes.

I love to fumble a lovely melody
rejoicing for having your serenity
but when you gifted me  infidelity
I hung my guitar to rest eternally. 

I may not be perfect as you see
But never did I love somebody
For  I vowed to serve forever thee
until my life be gone someday.

Let the wheel of fate take me faithfully
To where I may rest and find glory
of a true love untarnished till eternity. 

A lovely family
Is like the living tree, 
Which bears love’s tendency, 
Peaceful for all to be.
Joy that does beautify
Life so well is the key
To make all so happy.
The grace to build is spree, 
Makes life to act sunny
In a way we agree
To stay sound in glory, 
For sunlight to be free. 

In the memory of my
mind
your ever strolling
from time to time

A silhouette
oh so
fair
a beautiful face
none can compare


Looking lovely
and serene
almost like a fairy

Your always there
you never leave
a wonderful memory
of make believe.

If I could catch the green lantern of the firefly 
I could see to write you a letter. 

A lover is perplexed 
at seeing his fiancee! 
 
Is she a divine girl 
descending from heaven? 

Is she a beautiful peacock 
designed by creation? 
 
Is she a maid 
adorned with ornamental 
golden ear jewelary? 

My heart cannot decide! 
it doubts!

As Cloe came into the Room t'other Day,
I peevish began; Where so long cou'd You stay?
In your Life-time You never regarded your Hour:
You promis'd at Two; and (pray look Child) 'tis Four.
A Lady's Watch needs neither Figures nor Wheels:
'Tis enough, that 'tis loaded with Baubles and Seals.
A Temper so heedless no Mortal can bear—
Thus far I went on with a resolute Air.
Here's an ugly hard Rose-Bud fall'n into my Neck:
It has hurt Me, and vext Me to such a Degree—
See here; for You never believe Me; pray see,
On the left Side my Breast what a Mark it has made.
So saying, her Bosom She careless display'd.
That Seat of Delight I with Wonder survey'd;
And forgot ev'ry Word I design'd to have said. 

Where are you, my beloved? Are you in that little 
Paradise, watering the flowers who look upon you 
As infants look upon the breast of their mothers? 


Or are you in your chamber where the shrine of 
Virtue has been placed in your honor, and upon 
Which you offer my heart and soul as sacrifice? 


Or amongst the books, seeking human knowledge, 
While you are replete with heavenly wisdom? 


Oh companion of my soul, where are you? Are you 
Praying in the temple? Or calling Nature in the 
Field, haven of your dreams? 


Are you in the huts of the poor, consoling the 
Broken-hearted with the sweetness of your soul, and 
Filling their hands with your bounty? 


You are stronger than the ages. 


Do you have memory of the day we met, when the halo of 
You spirit surrounded us, and the Angels of Love 
Floated about, singing the praise of the soul's deed? 


Do you recollect our sitting in the shade of the 
Branches, sheltering ourselves from Humanity, as the ribs 
Protect the divine secret of the heart from injury? 


Remember you the trails and forest we walked, with hands 
Joined, and our heads leaning against each other, as if 
We were hiding ourselves within ourselves? 


Recall you the hour I bade you farewell, 
And the Maritime kiss you placed on my lips? 
That kiss taught me that joining of lips in Love 
Reveals heavenly secrets which the tongue cannot utter! 


That kiss was introduction to a great sigh, 
Like the Almighty's breath that turned earth into man. 


That sigh led my way into the spiritual world, 
Announcing the glory of my soul; and there 
It shall perpetuate until again we meet. 


I remember when you kissed me and kissed me, 
With tears coursing your cheeks, and you said, 
"Earthly bodies must often separate for earthly purpose, 
And must live apart impelled by worldly intent. 


"But the spirit remains joined safely in the hands of 


"Go, my beloved; Love has chosen you her delegate; 
Over her, for she is Beauty who offers to her follower 
The cup of the sweetness of life. 
As for my own empty arms, your love shall remain my 
Comforting groom; you memory, my Eternal wedding
 



Where are you now, my other self? Are you awake in 
The silence of the night? Let the clean breeze convey 
To you my heart's every beat and affection. 


Are you fondling my face in your memory? That image 
Is no longer my own, for Sorrow has dropped his 
Shadow on my happy countenance of the past. 


Sobs have withered my eyes which reflected your beauty 
And dried my lips which you sweetened with kisses. 


Where are you, my beloved? Do you hear my weeping 
From beyond the ocean? Do you understand my need? 
Do you know the greatness of my patience? 


Is there any spirit in the air capable of conveying 
To you the breath of this dying youth? Is there any 
Secret communication between angels that will carry to 
You my complaint? 


Where are you, my beautiful star? The obscurity of life 
Has cast me upon its bosom; sorrow has conquered me. 


Sail your smile into the air; it will reach and enliven me! 
Breathe your fragrance into the air; it will sustain me! 


Where are you, me beloved? 
Oh, how great is Love! 
And how little am I

FROM off a hill whose concave womb reworded
     A plaintful story from a sistering vale,
     My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,
     And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;
     Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
     Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,
     Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.

     Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
     Which fortified her visage from the sun,
     Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
     The carcass of beauty spent and done:
     Time had not scythed all that youth begun,
     Nor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven's fell rage,
     Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.

     Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,
     Which on it had conceited characters,
     Laundering the silken figures in the brine
     That season'd woe had pelleted in tears,
     And often reading what contents it bears;
     As often shrieking undistinguish'd woe,
     In clamours of all size, both high and low.

     Sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride,
     As they did battery to the spheres intend;
     Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
     To the orbed earth; sometimes they do extend
     Their view right on; anon their gazes lend
     To every place at once, and, nowhere fix'd,
     The mind and sight distractedly commix'd.

     Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,
     Proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride
     For some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,
     Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;
     Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,
     And true to bondage would not break from thence,
     Though slackly braided in loose negligence.

     A thousand favours from a maund she drew
     Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,
     Which one by one she in a river threw,
     Upon whose weeping margent she was set;
     Like usury, applying wet to wet,
     Or monarch's hands that let not bounty fall
     Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.

     Of folded schedules had she many a one,
     Which she perused, sigh'd, tore, and gave the flood;
     Crack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone
     Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;
     Found yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood,
     With sleided silk feat and affectedly
     Enswathed, and seal'd to curious secrecy.

     These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,
     And often kiss'd, and often 'gan to tear:
     Cried 'O false blood, thou register of lies,
     What unapproved witness dost thou bear!
     Ink would have seem'd more black and damned here!'
     This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,
     Big discontent so breaking their contents.

     A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh--
     Sometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew
     Of court, of city, and had let go by
     The swiftest hours, observed as they flew--
     Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,
     And, privileged by age, desires to know
     In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.

     So slides he down upon his grained bat,
     And comely-distant sits he by her side;
     When he again desires her, being sat,
     Her grievance with his hearing to divide:
     If that from him there may be aught applied
     Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,
     'Tis promised in the charity of age.

     'Father,' she says, 'though in me you behold
     The injury of many a blasting hour,
     Let it not tell your judgment I am old;
     Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power:
     I might as yet have been a spreading flower,
     Fresh to myself, If I had self-applied
     Love to myself and to no love beside.

     'But, woe is me! too early I attended
     A youthful suit--it was to gain my grace--
     Of one by nature's outwards so commended,
     That maidens' eyes stuck over all his face:
     Love lack'd a dwelling, and made him her place;
     And when in his fair parts she did abide,
     She was new lodged and newly deified.

     'His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;
     And every light occasion of the wind
     Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.
     What's sweet to do, to do will aptly find:
     Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
     For on his visage was in little drawn
     What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.

     'Small show of man was yet upon his chin;
     His phoenix down began but to appear
     Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
     Whose bare out-bragg'd the web it seem'd to wear:
     Yet show'd his visage by that cost more dear;
     And nice affections wavering stood in doubt
     If best were as it was, or best without.

     'His qualities were beauteous as his form,
     For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;
     Yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm
     As oft 'twixt May and April is to see,
     When winds breathe sweet, untidy though they be.
     His rudeness so with his authorized youth
     Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.

     'Well could he ride, and often men would say
     'That horse his mettle from his rider takes:
     Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,
     What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop
     he makes!'
     And controversy hence a question takes,
     Whether the horse by him became his deed,
     Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.

     'But quickly on this side the verdict went:
     His real habitude gave life and grace
     To appertainings and to ornament,
     Accomplish'd in himself, not in his case:
     All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,
     Came for additions; yet their purposed trim
     Pieced not his grace, but were all graced by him.

     'So on the tip of his subduing tongue
     All kinds of arguments and question deep,
     All replication prompt, and reason strong,
     For his advantage still did wake and sleep:
     To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,
     He had the dialect and different skill,
     Catching all passions in his craft of will:

     'That he did in the general bosom reign
     Of young, of old; and sexes both enchanted,
     To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain
     In personal duty, following where he haunted:
     Consents bewitch'd, ere he desire, have granted;
     And dialogued for him what he would say,
     Ask'd their own wills, and made their wills obey.

     'Many there were that did his picture get,
     To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind;
     Like fools that in th' imagination set
     The goodly objects which abroad they find
     Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign'd;
     And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them
     Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them:

     'So many have, that never touch'd his hand,
     Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart.
     My woeful self, that did in freedom stand,
     And was my own fee-simple, not in part,
     What with his art in youth, and youth in art,
     Threw my affections in his charmed power,
     Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower.

     'Yet did I not, as some my equals did,
     Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;
     Finding myself in honour so forbid,
     With safest distance I mine honour shielded:
     Experience for me many bulwarks builded
     Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil
     Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.

     'But, ah, who ever shunn'd by precedent
     The destined ill she must herself assay?
     Or forced examples, 'gainst her own content,
     To put the by-past perils in her way?
     Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay;
     For when we rage, advice is often seen
     By blunting us to make our wits more keen.

     'Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,
     That we must curb it upon others' proof;
     To be forbod the sweets that seem so good,
     For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.
     O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!
     The one a palate hath that needs will taste,
     Though Reason weep, and cry, 'It is thy last.'

     'For further I could say 'This man's untrue,'
     And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;
     Heard where his plants in others' orchards grew,
     Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;
     Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;
     Thought characters and words merely but art,
     And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.

     'And long upon these terms I held my city,
     Till thus he gan besiege me: 'Gentle maid,
     Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity,
     And be not of my holy vows afraid:
     That's to ye sworn to none was ever said;
     For feasts of love I have been call'd unto,
     Till now did ne'er invite, nor never woo.

     ''All my offences that abroad you see
     Are errors of the blood, none of the mind;
     Love made them not: with acture they may be,
     Where neither party is nor true nor kind:
     They sought their shame that so their shame did find;
     And so much less of shame in me remains,
     By how much of me their reproach contains.

     ''Among the many that mine eyes have seen,
     Not one whose flame my heart so much as warm'd,
     Or my affection put to the smallest teen,
     Or any of my leisures ever charm'd:
     Harm have I done to them, but ne'er was harm'd;
     Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,
     And reign'd, commanding in his monarchy.

     ''Look here, what tributes wounded fancies sent me,
     Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood;
     Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me
     Of grief and blushes, aptly understood
     In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;
     Effects of terror and dear modesty,
     Encamp'd in hearts, but fighting outwardly.

     ''And, lo, behold these talents of their hair,
     With twisted metal amorously impleach'd,
     I have received from many a several fair,
     Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech'd,
     With the annexions of fair gems enrich'd,
     And deep-brain'd sonnets that did amplify
     Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.

     ''The diamond,--why, 'twas beautiful and hard,
     Whereto his invised properties did tend;
     The deep-green emerald, in whose fresh regard
     Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;
     The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend
     With objects manifold: each several stone,
     With wit well blazon'd, smiled or made some moan.

     ''Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,
     Of pensived and subdued desires the tender,
     Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not,
     But yield them up where I myself must render,
     That is, to you, my origin and ender;
     For these, of force, must your oblations be,
     Since I their altar, you enpatron me.

     ''O, then, advance of yours that phraseless hand,
     Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;
     Take all these similes to your own command,
     Hallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise;
     What me your minister, for you obeys,
     Works under you; and to your audit comes
     Their distract parcels in combined sums.

     ''Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,
     Or sister sanctified, of holiest note;
     Which late her noble suit in court did shun,
     Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;
     For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,
     But kept cold distance, and did thence remove,
     To spend her living in eternal love.

     ''But, O my sweet, what labour is't to leave
     The thing we have not, mastering what not strives,
     Playing the place which did no form receive,
     Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves?
     She that her fame so to herself contrives,
     The scars of battle 'scapeth by the flight,
     And makes her absence valiant, not her might.

     ''O, pardon me, in that my boast is true:
     The accident which brought me to her eye
     Upon the moment did her force subdue,
     And now she would the caged cloister fly:
     Religious love put out Religion's eye:
     Not to be tempted, would she be immured,
     And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.

     ''How mighty then you are, O, hear me tell!
     The broken bosoms that to me belong
     Have emptied all their fountains in my well,
     And mine I pour your ocean all among:
     I strong o'er them, and you o'er me being strong,
     Must for your victory us all congest,
     As compound love to physic your cold breast.

     ''My parts had power to charm a sacred nun,
     Who, disciplined, ay, dieted in grace,
     Believed her eyes when they to assail begun,
     All vows and consecrations giving place:
     O most potential love! vow, bond, nor space,
     In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,
     For thou art all, and all things else are thine.

     ''When thou impressest, what are precepts worth
     Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,
     How coldly those impediments stand forth
     Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!
     Love's arms are peace, 'gainst rule, 'gainst sense,
     'gainst shame,
     And sweetens, in the suffering pangs it bears,
     The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.

     ''Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,
     Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine;
     And supplicant their sighs to you extend,
     To leave the battery that you make 'gainst mine,
     Lending soft audience to my sweet design,
     And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath
     That shall prefer and undertake my troth.'

     'This said, his watery eyes he did dismount,
     Whose sights till then were levell'd on my face;
     Each cheek a river running from a fount
     With brinish current downward flow'd apace:
     O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!
     Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses
     That flame through water which their hue encloses.

     'O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies
     In the small orb of one particular tear!
     But with the inundation of the eyes
     What rocky heart to water will not wear?
     What breast so cold that is not warmed here?
     O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,
     Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.

     'For, lo, his passion, but an art of craft,
     Even there resolved my reason into tears;
     There my white stole of chastity I daff'd,
     Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;
     Appear to him, as he to me appears,
     All melting; though our drops this difference bore,
     His poison'd me, and mine did him restore.

     'In him a plenitude of subtle matter,
     Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,
     Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,
     Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,
     In either's aptness, as it best deceives,
     To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes,
     Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.

     'That not a heart which in his level came
     Could 'scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,
     Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;
     And, veil'd in them, did win whom he would maim:
     Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;
     When he most burn'd in heart-wish'd luxury,
     He preach'd pure maid, and praised cold chastity.

     'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace
     The naked and concealed fiend he cover'd;
     That th' unexperient gave the tempter place,
     Which like a cherubin above them hover'd.
     Who, young and simple, would not be so lover'd?
     Ay me! I fell; and yet do question make
     What I should do again for such a sake.

     'O, that infected moisture of his eye,
     O, that false fire which in his cheek so glow'd,
     O, that forced thunder from his heart did fly,
     O, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow'd,
     O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
     Would yet again betray the fore-betray'd,
     And new pervert a reconciled maid!


'When people tell me they have loved
But once in youth,
I wonder, are they always moved
To speak the truth?

Not that they wilfully deceive:
They fondly cherish
A constancy which they would grieve
To think might perish.

They cherish it until they think
`Twas always theirs.
So, if the truth they sometimes blink,
`Tis unawares.

Yet unawares, I must profess,
They do deceive
Themselves, and those who questionless
Their tale believe.

For I have loved, I freely own,
A score of times,
And woven, out of love alone,
A hundred rhymes.

Boys will be fickle. Yet, when all
Is said and done,
I was not one whom you could call
A flirt--not one

Of those who into three or four
Their hearts divide.
Not side by side.

Each, while she reigned, possessed alone
My spirit loyal,
Then left an undisputed throne
To one more royal,

To one more fair in form and face
Sweeter and stronger,
Who filled the throne with truer grace,
And filled it longer.

So, love by love, they came and passed,
These loves of mine,
And each one brighter than the last
Their lights did shine.

Until--but am I not too free,
Most courteous stranger,
With secrets which belong to me?
There is a danger.

Until, I say, the perfect love,
The last, the best,
Like flame descending from above,
Kindled my breast,

Kindled my breast like ardent flame,
With quenchless glow.
I knew not love until it came,
But now I know.

You smile. The twenty loves before
Were each in turn,
You say, the final flame that o'er
My soul should burn.

Smile on, my friend. I will not say
You have no reason;
But if the love I feel to-day
Depart, `tis treason!

If this depart, not once again
Will I on paper
Declare the loves that waste and wane,
Like some poor taper.

No, no! This flame, I cannot doubt,
Despite your laughter,
Will burn till Death shall put it out,
And may be after. 

Lets get lost in each other, 
Letting the world around us fall apart, 
But staying whole within my arms, 
A lovers embrace.  

Is there anything better? 
The feelings of security, and warmth, 
Protection and hope, 
Lovers together, Letting love elope, 
Staying strong apart, but invincible when together, 
A lovers embrace that lasts forever. 

I envy every flower that blows 
Along the meadow where she goes, 
And every bird that sings to her, 
And every breeze that brings to her
The fragrance of the rose. 

I envy every poet's rhyme
That moves her heart at eventime,
And every tree that wears for her
Its brightest bloom, and bears for her
The fruitage of its prime. 

I envy every Southern night
That paves her path with moonbeams white,
And silvers all the leaves for her,
And in their shadow weaves for her
A dream of dear delight. 

I envy none whose love requires
Of her a gift, a task that tires:
I only long to live to her,
I only ask to give to her
All that her heart desires. 

When a lover hies abroad
Looking for his love,
Azrael smiling sheathes his sword,
Heaven smiles above.
Earth and sea
His servants be,
And to lesser compass round,
That his love be sooner found

When will we meet again? 
Ages have fled since you left, 
I have been roaming from shore to shore 
To set my mind free into the sky of time, 
But I keep coming back to my nest 
As the world around me remains the same
Like my love for you; 

Each day I am lulled to sleep by memories 
About just this love 
They drown me in a flood of  emotions, 
I set to motion my quill, to retrace my lost days 
The future is covered by a blanket of mystery, darkness; 
Where have you been all these years? 
When will we meet again? 

I have arrived at the summit today 
The eternal sun of love is burning at the zenith, 
The forest keeps whispering my secrets to the wind 
The birds carry them in their flights to alien shores
My love alone has coloured with purpose, my days on earth 
The dewdropp tries to emulate the river 
Just as the poet in me tries, to trap this love within lines; 

I keep following your footprints, left in my memories 
Though I keep retracing my past you are nowhere in this shore, 
I have to try and emulate the husband 
Who has lost his wife and marries again, 
While the husband should try to copy me 
Yet my love will cease to exist if fulfilled. 

Tangled in thought am I,
Stumble in speech do I?
Do I blunder and blush for the reason why?
Wander aloof do I,
Lean over gates and sigh,
Making friends with the bee and the butterfly?

If thus and thus I do,
Dazed by the thought of you,
Walking my sorrowful way in the early dew,
My heart cut through and through
In this despair of you,
Starved for a word or a look will my hope renew:


give then a thought for me
Walking so miserably,
Wanting relief in the friendship of flower or tree;
Do but remember, we
Once could in love agree,
Swallow your pride, let us be as we used to be. 

In a lovers arms
I find my calm

In a lovers arms
I reinstate my peace
With a sweet soft tender lingering kiss

In a lovers arms
My life long dreams are
Spiced up, stirred and stewed
Heated up with fascination
Grilled with imagination
Till they virtually become true
during our loving lifespan duration

In a lovers arms
My questions are answered
Answers to unanswered questions can wait
It is not a question of now or never
It is a question of how to make 
This sweet moment last forever

I.

 Oh, what a dawn of day!
 How the March sun feels like May!
     All is blue again
     After last night's rain,
 And the South dries the hawthorn-spray.
     Only, my Love's away!
 I'd as lief that the blue were grey,

	II.

Runnels, which rillets swell,
Must be dancing down the dell,
    With a foaming head
    On the beryl bed
Paven smooth as a hermit's cell;
    Each with a tale to tell,
Could my Love but attend as well.

	III.

Dearest, three months ago!
When we lived blocked-up with snow,---
    When the wind would edge
    In and in his wedge,
In, as far as the point could go---
    Not to our ingle, though,
Where we loved each the other so!

	IV.

Laughs with so little cause!
We devised games out of straws.
    We would try and trace
    One another's face
In the ash, as an artist draws;
    Free on each other's flaws,
How we chattered like two church daws!

	V.

What's in the `Times''?---a scold
At the Emperor deep and cold;
    He has taken a bride
    To his gruesome side,
That's as fair as himself is bold:
    There they sit ermine-stoled,
And she powders her hair with gold.

	VI.

Fancy the Pampas' sheen!
Miles and miles of gold and green
    Where the sunflowers blow
    In a solid glow,
And---to break now and then the screen---
    Black neck and eyeballs keen,
Up a wild horse leaps between!

	VII.

Try, will our table turn?
Lay your hands there light, and yearn
    Till the yearning slips
    Thro' the finger-tips
In a fire which a few discern,
    And a very few feel burn,
And the rest, they may live and learn!

	VIII.

Then we would up and pace,
For a change, about the place,
    Each with arm o'er neck:
    'Tis our quarter-deck,


    Help in the ocean-space!
Or, if no help, we'll embrace.

	IX.

See, how she looks now, dressed
In a sledging-cap and vest!
    'Tis a huge fur cloak---
    Like a reindeer's yoke
Falls the lappet along the breast:
    Sleeves for her arms to rest,
Or to hang, as my Love likes best.

	X.

Teach me to flirt a fan
As the Spanish ladies can,
    Or I tint your lip
    With a burnt stick's tip
And you turn into such a man!
    Just the two spots that span
Half the bill of the young male swan.

	XI.

Dearest, three months ago
When the mesmerizer Snow
    With his hand's first sweep
    Put the earth to sleep:
'Twas a time when the heart could show
All---how was earth to know,
    'Neath the mute hand's to-and-fro?

	XII.

Dearest, three months ago
When we loved each other so,
    Lived and loved the same
    Till an evening came
When a shaft from the devil's bow
    Pierced to our ingle-glow,
And the friends were friend and foe!

	XIII.

Not from the heart beneath---
'Twas a bubble born of breath,
    Neither sneer nor vaunt,
    Nor reproach nor taunt. 
See a word, how it severeth!
    Oh, power of life and death
In the tongue, as the Preacher saith!

	XIV.

Woman, and will you cast
For a word, quite off at last
    Me, your own, your You,---
    Since, as truth is true,
I was You all the happy past---
    Me do you leave aghast
With the memories We amassed?

	XV.

Love, if you knew the light
That your soul casts in my sight,
    How I look to you
    For the pure and true
And the beauteous and the right,---
    Bear with a moment's spite
When a mere mote threats the white!

	XVI.

What of a hasty word?
Is the fleshly heart not stirred
    By a worm's pin-prick
    Where its roots are quick?
See the eye, by a fly's foot blurred---
    Ear, when a straw is heard
Scratch the brain's coat of curd!

	 XVII.

Foul be the world or fair
More or less, how can I care?
    'Tis the world the same
    For my praise or blame,
And endurance is easy there.
    Wrong in the one thing rare---
Oh, it is hard to bear!

	XVIII.

Here's the spring back or close,
When the almond-blossom blows:
    We shall have the word
    In a minor third
There is none but the cuckoo knows:
    Heaps of the guelder-rose!
I must bear with it, I suppose.

	XIX.

Could but November come,
Were the noisy birds struck dumb
    At the warning slash
    Of his driver's-lash---
I would laugh like the valiant Thumb
    Facing the castle glum
And the giant's fee-faw-fum!

	XX.

Then, were the world well stripped
Of the gear wherein equipped
    We can stand apart,
    Heart dispense with heart
In the sun, with the flowers unnipped,---
    Oh, the world's hangings ripped,
We were both in a bare-walled crypt!

	XXI.

Each in the crypt would cry
But one freezes here! and why? 
    When a heart, as chill,
    At my own would thrill
Back to life, and its fires out-fly?
    Heart, shall we live or die?
The rest. . . . settle by-and-by!''

	XXII.

So, she'd efface the score,
And forgive me as before.
    It is twelve o'clock:
    I shall hear her knock
In the worst of a storm's uproar,
    I shall pull her through the door,
I shall have her for evermore

We two were lovers, the Sea and I; 
We plighted our troth ‘neath a summer sky.

And all through the riotous ardent weather
We dreamed, and loved, and rejoiced together.
	*	*	*
At times my lover would rage and storm.
I said: ‘No matter, his heart is warm.’

Whatever his humour, I loved his ways, 
And so we lived though the golden days.

I know not the manner it came about, 
But in the autumn we two fell out.

Yet this I know – ‘twas the fault of the Sea, 
And was not my fault, that he changed to me.
	*	*	*
I lingered as long as a woman may
To find what her lover will do or say.

But he met my smiles with a sullen frown, 
And so I turned to the wooing Town.

Oh, bold was this suitor, and blithe as bold! 
His look was as bright as the Sea’s was cold.

As the Sea was sullen, the Town was gay; 
He made me forget for a winter day.

For a winter day and a winter night
He laughed my sorrow away from sight.

And yet, in spite of his mirth and cheer, 
I knew full well he was insincere.

And when the young buds burst on the tree, 
The old love woke in my heart for the Sea.

Pride was forgotten – I knew, I knew, 
That the soul of the Sea, like my own, was true.

I heard him calling, and lo! I came, 
To find him waiting, for ever the same.

And when he saw me, with murmurs sweet
He ran to meet me, and fell at my feet.

And so again ‘neath the summer sky
We have plighted our troth, the Sea and I. 

Story: One evening, they came home late
Mom,   cooking dinner in a speedy craze
 Asked: Help me to set the table, please? 
There comes her sweetheart: 
Zdring! ! Zdrang! ! Zdrong! 
Shaking the sfrrr 
sfrrr  frying pan, 
Mom cries out: 
'LOVE! '
The daughter, 
with the plates 
in her hand, freeze
Dad's nose came out
from the newspaper wondering
Smiling, mom said: ~With love, my dears: 
'All things that on our table come, 
With love and kindness handled are.'

That evening? Oh, yes indeed, 
they had one of the most beautiful 
ever meals. 

Cute as a bug, bright eyed and spirited, 
the littler terrier 
filled all our lives; 
captured our hearts as easily as he managed
to sneak into the boy's room each night.

A bitter sweet chapter of our history; 
this adored pet of youth
that lies wrapped in his own death
remains forever wrapped in our memories. 
The poison was painful and slow.

He hid in the storm but I tracked his cries; 
cradled him back home to the comfort of family, 
to our broken hearts and the little boy's hands 
that would dig a very special place 
to gently give him back to the earth.

An innocent creature taken so mercilessly 
speaks even now these decades later. 
Some hearts are already dead 
lost in the darkness of their own cruelty; 
others live on in loving memories they leave behind. 

I dream of you, 
So far away, 
An image hardly touched, 
But when, my love, 
You love this way, 
One word can mean so much

I'm flirting with Death
He's got one hand on my knee
This is Russian roulette
But no guns are going off for me
The King of Hell's ring is on my finger
His other hand is on my heart
Out of a girl who was falling apart
My sharp gaze is fixed
On His deep dark eyes
His smile can be so deceiving
But to me He tells no lies
We are a picture perfect couple
Both so carved of stone
So intense, so madly in love
And never again to have to be alone
This devil I sleep beside
He pulled me from my purgatory
And gave me a brand new life
Forever I am thankful
For taking my dysfunctional mass of tissue and blood
And returning it an unbroken heart
He's given me eternity
He's given me love that I do not deserve
And a kingdom I now call home
Forever after I will wear this crown
Until the end of time I will wear His ring
No one ever guessed Death was capable of love this perfect
Nor did anyone anticipate that I would find my soul mate in the Darkest King
At this moment as He holds me
So close I can feel His heart beating so sweet but so strong
I am positive that my place is in this kingdom
In His arms I've found exactly where I belong


I'm flirting with Death
He's got one hand on my knee
This is Russian roulette
But no guns are going off for me
The King of Hell's ring is on my finger
His other hand is on my heart
Out of a girl who was falling apart
My sharp gaze is fixed
On His deep dark eyes
His smile can be so deceiving
But to me He tells no lies
We are a picture perfect couple

So intense, so madly in love
And never again to have to be alone
This devil I sleep beside
He pulled me from my purgatory
And gave me a brand new life
Forever I am thankful
For taking my dysfunctional mass of tissue and blood
And returning it an unbroken heart
He's given me a kingdom
He's convinced my once shattered heart to beat
Yet I still can't help but mourn the loss
Of the one who had destroyed me


My joints are stiff, my body aches
from A to B, an age it takes; 
problems they are manifold
oh why must I be old? 

To rise without my walking stick
and heave myself to perpendicular
is hard, and such a strain, 
oh glory, here we go again: 

there's something coming through the door
that crashes to the wooden floor; 
tons of junk-mail in the hall, 
oh well, I'm up, and didn't fall. 

I walked in to the marshes sad
And spotted him there on the lilly pad
He sat there, so very tiny
With slippery feet that were way too slimy
I'd slipped into a place I wasn't fond
And occupied myself with this little pond
I pulled up my long, tattered sleeves
And engaged with this fellow looking at me
Then I decided, I'd kiss him on the head
And he'd turn into a handsome prince instead! 
I took his wet body, put his head to my lips
And kissed him there, what a trip! 
Frightened, he started to ribbit up a storm
As I waited for him to transform
And then I concluded, alone in that bog
I had been fooled into kissing a.  

frog! 

I.
Wonder winged luminous in my eyes.
Elegance sheer I perceive and prize
On a flower who plays the sun of skies.
What psyche fair in colours does rise
In flight of swerve and curve amid ease? 
It my eyes trail wherever to please
Me to relish harmony it frees
Through me as my heart awes in its choice.
My heart sings of its hush to rejoice
On its coaxing wings of love as its voice
Drenched in rhythm to flutter with grace, 
Sends its charm my ardour does embrace.
Seeming emitted from its wings' base, 
Are bubbles leaping for bliss my eyes face.

II.
Bliss viewed from its pride glowing in flight.
What muse fuelled it to fill the air with light? 
Air groomed as spanking breeze to incite
Scenery refreshed with humour bright
Like the ocean of tune in my thought, 
Alp's summit in my spirit it wrought, 
Joy in its ripened bloom I have sought.
Gladness indispensable is found, 
As the place whole revolving around
Me glistens with colours bright abound.
How the colours blaze as bright as gold, 
My survey of such is turning bold.
Of my being it inclines to mold, 
Description is arduous to be told.

III.
Influences me its aplomb calm, 
To rise from seat to be nigh its charm.
Magnetised I extend my right arm
To induce it to float in my palm.
Tenderness on my palm it does stream, 
Of experience this touch is a dream.
Filled is my soul with the summer's gleam, 
Delectation my soul such will own.
Splendid grandeur in its beam is shown.
Spring of roses in my heart is grown.
Lavishing me with boon stark like the sun
In its giving of joy firm to run.
What enthusiasm star-like in one, 
Who has fetched at its very best, fun. 

The animals tumble
A fall from their cradle, from
Their  rest in the crescent of the moon

Twisting in mid air
Talons and teeth
Inconsolable noises of grief
Falling and calling
To mothers and mates 
Alpha males and leaders of the herd
Over and over 
And without a word
Little creatures tumble 

Their fate is bent
On this unstoppable
Downward 
Descent

A bump, a thud
They hit the ground
Wails, yelps, groans
All manners of sounds
Whimpers, murmurs
They anticipate death
Fur and feathers heave
In a united breath

Broken stares peek
For the black mass of flies
One hundred million greedy eyes
That come for the fester, 
Decay and disease
Dipping its crest into the forest, the moon
Scoops more sleeping babies
From the tops of the trees


The Moon makes us linger in the moment.
Its power over the tides is also felt
in the currents of our feelings. We submit
readily, and we stand very close, very still
by a grove of poplars and let the Moon's light
drench us. You tell me ancient poets drank moonlight
as if it were the wine of inspiration. Let us fill
two glasses and let the wine and moonlight mingle
before we drink. Only the soft hooting of a single owl
breaks the stillness.  

Time passes, it approaches the moment of the New Year
when past and present are briefly folded into future. 
But that is not our concern: The Moon and the Wine of
Inspiration have awakened something that will be awake
for a long time. I feel the meaning of life is floating
in the heavy air and circles around us. It longs to come
to rest in our place of being. Here is a sheet of paper, 
a pen, a writing table. I will stand apart but nearby, 
and join the owls' vigil in the poplar grove. While you
inscribe in the simplest words the profoundest thought. 

I would give up drinking
To be drunk with your perfume
On a summer night
With the sea breeze singing
A romantic lullaby, 
To kiss your eyes at midnight, 
Adorable woman, 
For whom every aching fiber
Of my lonely being craves. 

His name was Dale
He loved his ale
And ringing bells at five past three
A snake of a guy
Whose life was a Ley
And hell be his destiny
The ones who are blind
Are of his same kind
And those who chose not to see


A   Lyre From  Parnassus


As we were gone hopelessly above  in the sky.  

 As a  stars, have submitted far, behind a side. 

-  Even,  have not  found a paper? write on the moon. 

 - You have  lost the handle? - I  give.   phoenix feather. 

- Yes, an  ink has dried up!
I give.  tears of roses

- Muses have departed? I give.  lyre from  Parnassus. 

Because  we wanted, to collect. . violet impression. 

This the song, does not wait the  arrangement, and.  

I want.  not noise.  I want the  thin accompaniment.  

I deem that there are lyric days
So ripe with radiance and cheer,
So rich with gratitude and praise
That they enrapture all the year.
(As they would tell me in the Kirk,)
How he must look with pride and love
Upon his perfect handiwork!

To-day has been a lyric day
I hope I shall remember long,
Of meadow dance and roundelay,
Of woodland glee, of glow and song.
Such joy I saw in maidens eyes,
In mother gaze such tender bliss . . .
How earth would rival paradise
If every day could be like this!

Why die, say I? Let us live on
In lyric world of song and shine,
With ecstasy from dawn to dawn,
Until we greet the dawn Devine.
For I believe, with star and sun,
With peak and plain, with sea and sod,
Inextricably we are one,

While the milder fates consent,
Let's enjoy our merriment :
Drink, and dance, and pipe, and play ;
Kiss our dollies night and day :
Crowned with clusters of the vine,
Let us sit, and quaff our wine.
Call on Bacchus, chant his praise ;
Shake the thyrse, and bite the bays :
Rouse Anacreon from the dead,
And return him drunk to bed :
Sing o'er Horace, for ere long
Death will come and mar the song :
Then shall Wilson and Gotiere
Never sing or play more here. 

A. 

M. radio sounds good after midnight
all-night stations come alive late; 
can't see far, from inside a car
but the magic of music is a vision to appreciate.

What could ever be better
then to have troubles taken away, 
by songs on the road, that will carry the load
and wash off the dirt of the day.

When I was young I heard it said
early to rise, early to bed and you'll be blest, 
but those old truckers knew, what I found so true
only music, honest and raw, can give a soul real rest.

Put all worries to bed
turn up the A. 

M. when day has gone, 
listen there to find, a new state of mind
when the speakers crackle an old soulful song.

It sounds just like heaven, and
if it's then or now I just can't seem to tell, 
I hold this station from the past, as long as it will last
until the miles 'tween us cause it all to go to hell. 

I love America
even tho'
the dance is done
and children
run to the war
in Afganistan

I love America
even tho
I am being held hostage
in a dream

I love America
when the trees turn green
and it's all beautiful

I love America
the false reality'
that is on TV

I love America
when it 
was free



I walked down that lonely road
That sinuous, torturous bend
You know how I hated 
The cold, the distance, my thoughts.

My thoughts flew back and forth
Like a mad bird blinded by the light
I was lost; I was lonely; I was in pain
A mad bird was I.
There was no way out of this blundering

Floundering directionless path to nowhere.
There was no way out and the how and the whys
Were the least of it all.

I was like that mad bird in full, haphazard flight. 



Quick on my feet in those Novembers of my loneliness, 
I tossed a short pass, 
Almost the instant I got the ball, right over the head 
Of Barrel Terry before he knocked me cold. 


When I woke, I found myself crying out 
Latin conjugations, and the new snow falling 
At the edge of a green field. 


Lemoyne Crone had caught the pass, while I lay 
Unconscious and raging 
Alone with the fire ghost of Catullus, the contemptuous graces tossing 
Garlands and hendecasyllabics over the head 
Of Cornelius Nepos the mastodon, 
The huge volume. 


At the edges of Southeast Asia this afternoon 
The quarterbacks and the lines are beginning to fall, 
A spring snow, 


And terrified young men 
Quick on their feet 
Lob one another’s skulls across 
Wings of strange birds that are burning 
Themselves alive. 

Crabbed Age and Youth
Cannot live together:
Youth is full of pleasance,
Age is full of care;
Youth like summer morn,
Age like winter weather;
Youth like summer brave,
Age like winter bare:
Youth is full of sports,
Age's breath is short,
Youth is nimble, Age is lame:
Youth is hot and bold,
Age is weak and cold,
Youth is wild, and Age is tame:-
Age, I do abhor thee;
Youth, I do adore thee;
O! my Love, my Love is young!
Age, I do defy thee-
O sweet shepherd, hie thee,
For methinks thou stay'st too long. 

In the stillness of a cold night, 
I rushed home to my peaceful nest
And tired and exhausted
From a long and stressful workday, 
I collapsed in my lovely bed
To start dreaming about you! 

As time passed by rapidly, 
Deeper and deeper became my dream, 
Feeling in paradise when I found myself
Completely wrapped in your arms
But fully aware that it was just a dream
That only you could make it come true! 
I was afraid to wake up my love! 
I honestly confess! 

Believe me my darling, 
It was my greatest wish and desire
To set your whole body on fire
While enjoying my dream within a dream
That became my imaginary paradise, 
Only by you inspired! 

I honestly confess to you my dear
That these clearly spoken words
Passing freely through my ardent lips
Come from the very bottom
Of my now healing heart! 
So, please, my love, 
Hurry up! Come to me! 
We cannot afford to be apart
When waiting for us is paradise! 

Romeo Della Valle
New York City


A magic moment I remember:
I raised my eyes and you were there,
A fleeting vision, the quintessence
Of all that's beautiful and rare 
I pray to mute despair and anguish,
To vain the pursuits world esteems,
Long did I hear your soothing accents,
Long did your features haunt my dreams. 
Time passed. A rebel storm-blast scattered
The reveries that once were mine
And I forgot your soothing accents,
Your features gracefully divine. 
In dark days of enforced retirement
I gazed upon grey skies above
With no ideals to inspire me
No one to cry for, live for, love. 
Then came a moment of reinessance,
I looked up - you again are there
A fleeting vision, the quintessence
Of all that's beautiful and rare


I don’t remember exactly when Budberg died, it was either two years 
ago or three. 
The same with Chen. Whether last year or the one before. 
Soon after our arrival, Budberg, gently pensive, 
Said that in the beginning it is hard to get accustomed, 
For here there is no spring or summer, no winter or fall. 


"I kept dreaming of snow and birch forests. 
Where so little changes you hardly notice how time goes by. 
This is, you will see, a magic mountain." 


Budberg: a familiar name in my childhood. 
They were prominent in our region, 
This Russian family, descendants of German Balts. 
I read none of his works, too specialized. 
And Chen, I have heard, was an exquisite poet, 
Which I must take on faith, for he wrote in Chinese. 


Sultry Octobers, cool Julys, trees blossom in February. 
Here the nuptial flight of hummingbirds does not forecast spring. 
Only the faithful maple sheds its leaves every year. 
For no reason, its ancestors simply learned it that way. 


I sensed Budberg was right and I rebelled. 
So I won’t have power, won’t save the world? 
Fame will pass me by, no tiara, no crown? 
Did I then train myself, myself the Unique, 
To compose stanzas for gulls and sea haze, 
To listen to the foghorns blaring down below? 


Until it passed. What passed? Life. 
Now I am not ashamed of my defeat. 
One murky island with its barking seals 
Or a parched desert is enough 
To make us say: yes, oui, si. 
'Even asleep we partake in the becoming of the world." 
Endurance comes only from enduring. 
With a flick of the wrist I fashioned an invisible rope, 
And climbed it and it held me. 


What a procession! Quelles delices! 
What caps and hooded gowns! 
Most respected Professor Budberg, 
Most distinguished Professor Chen, 
Wrong Honorable Professor Milosz 
Who wrote poems in some unheard-of tongue. 
Who will count them anyway. And here sunlight. 
So that the flames of their tall candles fade. 
And how many generations of hummingbirds keep them company 
As they walk on. Across the magic mountain. 
And the fog from the ocean is cool, for once again it is July. 

If I had a Magic Pen, 
Oh the wonders I would do, 
I would write in every Heart, 
'Love thyself and others too'

Kindness is a magic wand, 
Truth, the light of every land, 
Love is magic, thru and thru
Poets dream, so why can't you

I wish I had a Magic Word, 
To turn bad things around, 
'Love' is the closest that I've heard, 
That has that magic sound. 

There in future it wishes
A peculiar lamp that makes
The whole world with light
The light which itself keeps away
The darkness of all in world
There in future it seems
The good lamp a glittering metal
Not it is gold, not it is silver
Or certain alloys in labs
May be still to be found somewhere
Such lamp a magical 
To make rivers purified
Through its wonderful rays 
The best human it to carry
Who is no longer here availabl


It is over twenty-five years ago, 
Since this lady performed a live show: 
Way back then, she was one of four, 
Topping the charts with hit songs galore.

She watches in the wings, waiting her turn: 
Within her heart, she feels a little concern.
Waiting onstage is her partner in crime: 
There’s no turning back: now is the time.

As the intro is played, the crowd go wild, 
And from her co-star, she receives a smile; 
His welcoming gesture, gentlemanly and gracious, 
Beckons her forwards onto the stage so spacious.

Wearing long boots and a black lacy dress, 
She makes her entrance – now for her test; 
She walks onstage to thousands of cheers: 
Her face says ‘I can’t believe that I’m here.’

The spotlight follows her every move -
Her nerves, her co-star hopes he can soothe.
She takes a bow, then, with outstretched hand, 
She takes a moment to acknowledge the band.

He sings, ‘Can’t believe it’s really you.’
Neither can believe that it’s really true.
She smiles at him, as she sings a line in reply, 
And suddenly a spark ignites within her eyes.

His silent language keeps urging her on, 
And, very soon, her nerves are all gone; 
She then, very visibly, begins to relax, 
And her old star quality comes flooding back.

Despite the fact that it has been an age, 
She is soon feeling confident upon the stage.
The two singers are so amazing together -
The magic of this moment will last forever.

At the end of the song, they thank everyone; 
Both of the singers have had so much fun.
Having made her comeback singing a duet, 
For more live performances, she is now set. 

if. . 

if. . 

if..
there is a lot of wind
between these words
it is god
who carries me to this world
if there is no wind
i will never be heard
the words he coins within me
he gives it voice and through
his sound
he makes me be heard
a thorough magician
HE ISThere was the flash of cold steel 
as the long thin blades of the scissors
disappeared into the fine fabric of his heavy coat
Drunk and passed out.
He would never again require it's warmth.
There was the sound of his last breath 
as it escaped through the hole in his punctured lung.
His last words spilled out like vomit
on the master bedroom's defiled floor
slightly muffled 
by the gurgling of blood which flowed freely 
from his open and Liar's mouth.
'Why? he gasped.
I loved you more than anyone could ever love you.'
Leaving all us to surmise. .. 
That just maybe
his daughter didn't think it appropriate
for the very last time.   

Oh if I were the velvet rose 
Upon the red rose vine, 
I'd climb to touch his window 
And make his casement fine.

And if I were the little bird 
That twitters on the tree, 
All day I'd sing my love for him 
Till he should harken me.

But since I am a maiden 
I go with downcast eyes, 
And he will never hear the songs 
That he has turned to sighs.

And since I am a maiden 
My love will never know 
That I could kiss him with a mouth 
More red than roses blow. 

O gentle as you please, my love, 
I am yet still a maiden
And ‘though I yearn to know your will
My heart is heavy laden

For if I choose to lay with you
I deem that we should marry
As you would be the father of
The child that I may carry

I will not live a life of fear
Insulted and derided
And labelled as a worthless whore
Forevermore chastis’ed

So if you will not marry me
By you I’ll not be bedded
A maiden I shall stay, my love, 
Until the day I’m wedded


I have written this day down in my heart 
As the sweetest day in the season; 
From all of the others I've set it apart--- 
But I will not tell you the reason, 
That is my secret---I must not tell; 
But the skies are soft and tender, 
And never before, I know full well, 
Was the earth so full of splendour.

I sing at my labour the whole day long, 
And my heart is as light as a feather; 
And there is a reason for my glad song 
Besides the beautiful weather. 
But I will not tell it to you; and though 
That thrush in the maple heard it, 
And would shout it aloud if he could, I know 
He hasn't the power to word it.

Up, where I was sewing, this morn came one 
Who told me the sweetest stories, 
He said I had stolen my hair from the sun, 
And my eyes from the morning glories. 
Grandmother says that I must not believe 
A word men say, for they flatter; 
But I'm sure he would never try to deceive, 
For he told me---but there---no matter!

Last night I was sad, and the world to me 
Seemed a lonely and dreary dwelling, 
But some one then had not asked me to be--- 
There now! I am almost telling. 
Not another word shall my two lips say, 
I will shut them fast together, 
And never a mortal shall know to-day 
Why my heart is as light as a feather. 

He said he loved me! Then he called my hair
 Silk threads wherewith sly Cupid strings his bow, 
 My cheek a rose leaf fallen on new snow; 
And swore my round, full throat would bring despair
To Venus or to Psyche.

			Time and care
 Will fade these locks; the merry god, I know, 
 Uses no grizzled cords upon his bow.
How will it be when I, no longer fair, 
 Plead for his kiss with cheeks, whence long ago
The early snowflakes melted quite away, 
The rose leaf died – and in whose sallow clay
 Lie the deep sunken tracks of life’s gaunt crow? 

When this full throat shall wattle fold on fold, 
 Like some ripe peach left drying on a wall, 
 Or like a spent accordion, when all
Its music has exhaled – will love grow cold

A man alone 
is a night alone 
is a poem alone 
a man alone 
is alone 
alone


A MAN ALONE IS ONLY HIS OWN DEATH

A man alone is only his own death
Who gives nothing to the generations to come
What does he give? 
What has his life been for? 
A man alone as far he goes 
Goes nowhere.
Even if they worship his dust 
His dust is just dust, 
And his life has been death also. 

He had to return to that old, old dam, 
Where he often roamed as a lad; 
To see it crumbling, eroding away, 
Left him pensive, reflective and sad-

And this he told me-

'I saw the high and low water marks
Clearly etched on the battered old wall; 
With life's flotsam and jetsam pounding away, 
My old dam seemed ready to fall.

It has guarded life's waters for near eighty years
And has lasted as long as I; 
Scars from those years are clearly in view-
I am telling you this with a sigh.

I feel an affinity with that old dam
And can see a reflection of me; 
After seeing it slowly decaying away, 
I was filled with a deep empathy.

Life, like the waters, must keep flowing on, 
Ever hampered by time and the years; 
I, in my twilight, keep thinking on this-
Pardon me, while I wipe some tears. 

A man started to wonder 
About the life of a tree
Standing at a place 
Without a single movement
How it must be feeling? 
Same sun from same place
Same moon from same place
Same wind, but from different directions
Life must be boring and redundant! 
To strengthen its place
And for smooth growth
The roots go deep down the ground
The stem grows thick and hard
Look at me, I am moving 
From places to places
And I see the different things
From different places
Same sun but rising from all directions
Same moon, but from different horizons
The world for me is a playground
And I keep moving 
I come back to this tree only
When I am tired or hungry
And I thank Almighty
For these two legs without roots-The Difference between a Man and a Woman; 

         When Man needs your silver hugs and caressing kisses, 
                        Woman needs your mind as well.
                                When Man taunts your falls and misses
                                            Woman shares a laughing spell.
                   When Man tells you all will be right
                                         Woman tells you the mistake.
                                                           When Man starts leaving during fight
                                                                         Woman sees through all that fake 

      Woman, with her knowing eyes and blowing hair
                  Man with muscles and puppy smile.
                                  Woman with her bounty fair
                                               Man's will last just for a while.

Which is better; man or woman? 
woman or man? 
Men are gifts we love to open, while women that we can save. 

A MAN BECAME ADDICTED TO POETRY 

A man became addicted to poetry-
Wherever he went he read or wrote a few lines-
Poetry became much of what he did-
Poetry and poetry and poetry- 
As if that alone could give meaning and pleasure to his life. 

A man became addicted to poetry
And so lost at times 
What true poetry is –

Now he writes without knowing
Whether he is truly writing
Or merely using the ‘idea and world of poetry’
For his own peace of mind. 

A man became addicted to writing poems 
Even when he lost the sense 
That they were true poetry. 
He then permitted himself 
To write poems 
He did not himself quite believe in. 
Can we say this is a poor poet 
And a harmless fool 
And someone who need not be taken seriously

A MAN DOES NOT KNOW WHO HE IS 

A man does not know who he is-
He is too old to not know, 
But he still does not know-

He is lost in his own dream of himself
That never happened -

A man is nowhere
And going nowhere
And too old to ever go anywhere again-

The long distance is farther than he has ever known
Or ever will know-

And it will not have him in it. 

A man feared that he might find an assassin; 
Another that he might find a victim. 
One was more wise than the other. 

The sunlight is too bright for me-
I was in prison for so long.

My trial, a show staged by the Court, 
condemned before I spoke a word.

I thought, by silence, to preserve
my family from Penury.

 I counted not on Richard Rich-
compensed to commit perjury.

"Lieutenant, help me up these stairs
I’ll find my own way down, I think."

Though weak, I stand and face the crowd
Some bravely bless me as I speak.

"I die loyal servant to my king

(I would not take the proffered oath

"I give my life for Holy Church
like Fisher did before me."

Anne Boleyn, King’s plaything..

"Axe man; spare my beard I pray-
my "Treason’s" not its doing."

By your blade is More made less? 

To those who caused his Martyrdom
The blade was less forgiving. 

A man hired by John Smith and Co.
Loudly declared that he'd tho.
Men that he saw
Dumping dirt near his door
The drivers, therefore, didn't do. 

There was a man I knew 
and just knowing him 
made me think of poetry. 

Loving him, I learned 
that accepting love 
is as important as giving it 

and the not-so-subtle difference 
and loving red-hot. 

Love like that 
can make you stupid - 
a total-immersion kind of stupid, 
but it made me want 
to read poetry. 

In a different time 
and a different place 
it might have worked 

but it was over 
and when the last page was turned 
he was only a man I knew 

no regrets 
just one perfect memory 
and because I loved him 
I write poetry.

In Casterbridge there stood a noble pile, 
Wrought with pilaster, bay, and balustrade 
In tactful times when shrewd Eliza swayed. - 
   On burgher, squire, and clown 
It smiled the long street down for near a mile 

II 

But evil days beset that domicile; 
The stately beauties of its roof and wall 
Passed into sordid hands. Condemned to fall 
   Were cornice, quoin, and cove, 
And all that art had wove in antique style. 

III 

Among the hired dismantlers entered there 
One till the moment of his task untold. 
When charged therewith he gazed, and answered bold: 
   "Be needy I or no, 
I will not help lay low a house so fair! 

IV 

"Hunger is hard. But since the terms be such - 
No wage, or labour stained with the disgrace 
Of wrecking what our age cannot replace 
   To save its tasteless soul - 
I'll do without your dole. Life is not much! 

V 

Dismissed with sneers he backed his tools and went, 
And wandered workless; for it seemed unwise 
To close with one who dared to criticize 
   And carp on points of taste: 
To work where they were placed rude men were meant. 

VI 

Years whiled. He aged, sank, sickened, and was not: 
And it was said, "A man intractable 
And curst is gone

" None sighed to hear his knell, 
   None sought his churchyard-place; 
His name, his rugged face, were soon forgot. 

VII 

The stones of that fair hall lie far and wide, 
And but a few recall its ancient mould; 
Yet when I pass the spot I long to hold 
   As truth what fancy saith: 
"His protest lives where deathless things abide!"A man in shabby dresses
A vagabond man he someone says
May be vagarious in character
In spite of his vagrancy
He was a valiant man in accidents
He served the people in circumstances
Where no one was ready to act in time
To rescue a drowning man he jumped
In waters of deep river and wells
His valorous attempts saves the life
Never he attempts to vainglory of incidents
Ever ready to serve the society
To take a decomposed body may be a suicide
No one took the responsibility to take
And give a suitable burial in public grave
But he was a man who drank heavy
And spent the money whatever he earned
Still we consider the man as great
His service to society not compensated
Or never it becomes remunerative
What people gives or not he considers
Only the love to society and people 
He considers always and makes himself great. 

A man, infirm
With age, slowly sucks
A fish bone. 

When the tiger had reached the thick forest, 
.. 

The tiger offers protection to the same forest! 
The same thick forest as well protects the tiger! 

Similarly, 

A man is said to have wealth only when 
.. 

He maintains his acquired wealth properly! 
Then only, the same wealth safeguards the person 
.. 

Who owns it without getting into any difficulty!A Man may make a Remark—
In itself—a quiet thing
That may furnish the Fuse unto a Spark
In dormant nature—lain—

Let us deport—with skill—
Let us discourse—with care—
Powder exists in Charcoal—
Before it exists in Fire. 

Under the separated leaves of shade 
Of the gingko, that old tree 
That has existed essentially unchanged 
Longer than any other living tree, 
I walk behind a woman. Her hair's coarse gold 
Is spun from the sunlight that it rides upon. 
Women were paid to knit from sweet champagne 
Her second skin: it winds and unwinds, winds 
Up her long legs, delectable haunches, 
As she sways, in sunlight, up the gazing aisle. 
The shade of the tree that is called maidenhair, 
That is not positively known 
To exist in a wild state, spots her fair or almost fair 
Hair twisted in a French twist; tall or almost tall, 
She walks through the air the rain has washed, a clear thing 
Moving easily on its high heels, seeming to men 
Miraculous.  

Since I can call her, as Swann couldn't 
A woman who is my type, I follow with the warmth 
Of familiarity, of novelty, this new 
Example of the type, 
Reminded of how Lorenz's just-hatched goslings 
Shook off the last remnants of the egg 
And, looking at Lorenz, realized that Lorenz 
Was their mother. Quaking, his little family 
Followed him everywhere; and when they met a goose, 
Their mother, they ran to him afraid. 


Imprinted upon me 
Is the shape I run to, the sweet strange 
Breath-taking contours that breathe to me: 'I am yours, 
Be mine!' 
Following this new 
Body, somehow familiar, this young shape, somehow old, 
For a moment I'm younger, the century is younger. 
the living Strauss, his moustache just getting gray, 
Is shouting to the players: 'Louder! 
Louder! I can still hear Madame Schumann-Heink-' 
Or else, white, bald, the old man's joyfully 
Telling conductors they must play Elektra 
Like A Midsummer Night's Dream -like a fairy music; 
Proust, dying, is swallowing his iced beer 
And changing in proof the death of Bergotte 
According to his own experience; Garbo, 
A commissar in Paris, is listening attentively 
To the voice telling how Mc


Gillicuddy me Mc


Gillivray, 
And Mc


Gillivray said to Mc


Gillicuddy-no, Mc


Gillicuddy 
Said to Mc


Gillivray-that is, Mc


Gillivray.  

Garbo 
Says seriously: 'I vish dey'd never met.' 


As I walk behind this woman I remember 
That before I flew here-waked in the forest 
At dawn, by the piece called Birds Beginning Day 
That, each day, birds play to begin the day- 
I wished as men wish: 'May this day be different!' 
The birds were wishing, as birds wish-over and over, 
With a last firmness, intensity, reality- 
'May this day be the same!' 
Ah, turn to me 
And look into my eyes, say: 'I am yours, 
Be mine!' 
My wish will have come true. And yet 
When your eyes meet my eyes, they'll bring into 
The weightlessness of my pure wish the weight 
Of a human being: someone to help or hurt, 
Someone to be good to me, to be good to, 
Someone to cry when I am angry 
that she doesn't like Elektra, someone to start on Proust with. 
A wish, come true, is life. I have my life. 
When you turn just slide your eyes across my eyes 
And show in a look flickering across your face 
As lightly as a leaf's shade, a bird's wing, 
That there is no one in the world quit like me, 
That if only.  

If only.  
That will be enough. 


But I've pretended long enough: I walk faster 
And come close, touch with the tip of my finger 
The nape of her neck, just where the gold 
Hair stops, and the champagne-colored dress begins. 
My finger touches her as the gingko's shadow 
Touches her. 
Because, after all, it is my wife 
In a new dress from Bergdorf's, walking toward the park. 
She cries out, we kiss each other, and walk arm in arm 
Through the sunlight that's much too good for New York, 
The sunlight of our own house in the forest. 
Still, though, the poor things need it.  

We've no need 
To start out on Proust, to ask each other about Strauss. 
We first helped each other, hurt each other, years ago. 
After so many changes made and joys repeated, 
Our first bewildered, transcending recognition 
Is pure acceptance. We can't tell our life 
From our wish. Really I began the day 
Not with a man's wish: 'May this day be different,' 
But with the birds' wish: 'May this day 
Be the same day, the day of my life.

'It was a man of many parts,
Who in his coffer mind
Had stored the Classics and the Arts
And Sciences combined;
The purest gems of poesy
Came flashing from his pen--
The wholesome truths of History
He gave his fellow men.

He knew the stars from 'Dog' to Mars;
And he could tell you, too,
Their distances--as though the cars
Had often checked him through--
And time 'twould take to reach the sun,
Or by the 'Milky Way,'
Drop in upon the moon, or run
The homeward trip, or stay.

With Logic at his fingers' ends,
Theology in mind,
He often entertained his friends
Until they died resigned;
And with inquiring mind intent
Upon Alchemic arts
A dynamite experiment--
. . . . . . .
A man of many parts

He is a successful man in life
A business man, wealthy man
School was only an ambition
Life was difficult in childhood
The poor parents can't afford
For an education to the little one
Who cried when others going to school
Still he tried his best, with hopes
And started a small business in village
The provisional store a busy store
Where he studied practical maths
Addition, subtraction made in mind
A good performer of mental calculation
Just we saw a winner of life
And a wealthy man he succeeded in life
Slowly people knew his talents
He got a ticket in council elections
He is a mayor of repute, action oriented
A good human being, secular always
The good world was his school
The great men the customers his teachers
The people gave him love and affection
A man of success and self taught man. 

I can’t remember when
I felt anything for myself
Except for revulsion and contempt; 
I haven’t been worried for years
And anxious for months
On my own account, 
The sum of my existence
Is a small amount.

When the balance is due, 
When everything is settled
And every vital decision decided, 
I need to know
That you made it through this world
With your soul and psyche whole, 
That you found the happiness
I was unable to give you. 

On that old bridge, during the last fight, 
Threw the ring into the river to drown and rest, 
Returned to find that young heart in the old body, 
Still holding the placard of ‘I am sorry' to the wind, 
Looking for the ring of love that he had lost, 
In the new bridge, as the old is closed and secured, 
The elderly man is searching for his sweet heart, 
In every young woman who passes by his side, 
from left to right, right to left and top to bottom, 
Let people call him ‘dirty old man', 
Without knowing his life long search for his young love, 
Let people name him after every name of the devil, 
As he does not realize that his love has gone old and cold, 
But he has that hope, on the sidewalks of the bridge, 
That connects the two different banks of life and death, 
Rises up for the small ships to pass through, 
The clocks at the bell towers are changed, 
the noise of the bells remind him that he is alive. 

Is there for honesty poverty 
That hings his head, an' a' that; 
The coward slave - we pass him by, 
We dare be poor for a' that! 
For a' that, an' a' that, 
Our toils obscure an' a' that, 
The rank is but the guinea's stamp, 
The man's the gowd for a' that. 
 
What though on hamely fare we dine, 
Wear hoddin grey, an' a' that? 
Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine, 
A man's a man for a' that. 
For a' that, an' a' that, 
Their tinsel show, an' a' that, 
The honest man, tho' e'er sae poor, 
Is king o' men for a' that. 
 
Ye see yon birkie ca'd a lord, 
Wha struts, an' stares, an' a' that; 
Tho' hundreds worship at his word, 
He's but a coof for a' that. 
For a' that, an' a' that, 
His ribband, star, an' a' that, 
The man o' independent mind 
He looks an' laughs at a' that. 
 
A price can mak a belted knight, 
But an honest man's aboon his might, 
Gude faith, he maunna fa' that! 
For a' that, an' a' that, 
Their dignities an' a' that, 
The pith o' sense, an' pride o' worth, 
Are higher rank than a' that. 
 
Then let us pray that come it may, 
(As come it will for a' that,) 
That Sense and Worth, o'er a' the earth, 
Shall bear the gree, an' a' that. 
For a' that, an' a' that, 
That man to man, the world o'er, 
Shall brithers be for a' that. 

A poetess can be wasteful when it comes to love.
She'll wade and wallow
through the waterfalls below and above.
She'll sip big for ability's sake and swallow.

Like a sponge, not dripping a drop, 
she'll dip into resources, diving deeper, 
Never noticing what she's got
She'll take all and label each a keeper. 

A man's love is like water.
If you discover a fountain and abuse the stream, 
the temperature is colder after it is hotter.
I'll wake up one day to find I am thirsty and it was only a dream. 

My path forth from the east gate lay,
Where cloud-like moved the girls at play.
Numerous are they, as clouds so bright,
But not on them my heart's thoughts light.
Dressed in a thin white silk, with coiffure gray
Is she, my wife, my joy in life's low way.

Forth by the covering wall's high tower,
I went, and saw, like rush in flower,
Each flaunting girl. Brilliant are they,
But not with them my heart's thoughts stay.
In thin white silk, with head-dress madder-dyed,
Is she, my sole delight, 'foretime my bride. 

To-night when I came from the club at eleven,
Under the gaslight I saw a face-
A woman's face! and I swear to heaven
It looked like the ghastly ghost of-Grace!


And Grace? why, Grace was fair; and I tarried,
And loved her a season as we men do.
And then-but pshaw! why, of course, she is married,
Has a husband, and doubtless, a babe or two.


She was perfectly calm on the day we parted;
She spared me a scene, to my great surprise.
She wasn't the kind to be broken-hearted,
I remember she said, with a spark in her eyes.


I was tempted, I know, by her proud defiance,
To make good my promises there and then.
But the world would have called it a mesalliance!
I dreaded the comments and sneers of men.


So I left her to grieve for a faithless lover,
And to hide her heart from the cold world's sight
As women do hide them, the wide earth over;


I thought of her married, and often with pity,
A poor man's wife in some dull place.
And now to know she is here in the city,
Under the gaslight, and with that face!


Yet I knew it at once, in spite of the daubing
Of paint and powder, and she knew me;
She drew a quick breath that was almost sobbing,
And shrank in the shade so I should not see.


There was hell in her eyes! She was worn and jaded;
Her soul is at war with the life she has led.
As I looked on that face so strangely faded,


While I have been happy and gay and jolly,
Received by the very best people in town,
That girl whom I led in the way to folly,
Has gone on recklessly down and down.


Two o'clock, and no sleep has found me.
That face I saw in the street-lamp's light
Peers everywhere out from the shadows around me-
I know how a murderer feels to-night

I 

Love me Sweet, with all thou art, 
Feeling, thinking, seeing; 
Love me in the lightest part, 
Love me in full being. 

II 

Love me with thine open youth 
In its frank surrender; 
With the vowing of thy mouth, 
With its silence tender. 

III 

Love me with thine azure eyes, 
Made for earnest grantings; 
Taking colour from the skies, 
Can Heaven's truth be wanting? 

IV 

Love me with their lids, that fall 
Snow-like at first meeting; 
Love me with thine heart, that all 
Neighbours then see beating. 

V 

Love me with thine hand stretched out 
Freely -- open-minded: 
Love me with thy loitering foot, -- 
Hearing one behind it. 

VI 

Love me with thy voice, that turns 
Sudden faint above me; 
Love me with thy blush that burns 
When I murmur 'Love me!' 

VII 

Love me with thy thinking soul, 
Break it to love-sighing; 
Love me with thy thoughts that roll 
On through living -- dying. 

VIII 

Love me in thy gorgeous airs, 
When the world has crowned thee; 
Love me, kneeling at thy prayers, 
With the angels round thee. 

IX 

Love me pure, as muses do, 
Up the woodlands shady: 
Love me gaily, fast and true, 
As a winsome lady. 

X 

Through all hopes that keep us brave, 
Farther off or nigher, 
Love me for the house and grave, 
And for something higher. 

XI 

Thus, if thou wilt prove me, Dear, 
Woman's love no fable, 
I will love thee -- half a year -- 
As a man is able. 

YOU said, last night, you did not think 
In all the world of men 
Was one true lover--true alike 
In deed and word and pen;-- 

One knightly lover, constant as 
The old knights, who sleep sound: 
Some women, said you, there might be-- 
Not one man faithful found: 

Not one man, resolute to win, 
Or, winning, firm to hold 
The woman, among women--sought 
With steadfast love and bold. 

Not one whose noble life and pure 
Had power so to control 
To tender hublest loyalty 
Her free, but reverent soul, 

That she beside him gladly moved 
As sovereign and slave; 
In faith unfettered, homage true, 
Each claiming what each gave. 

And then you dropped your eyelids white, 
And stood in maiden bloom 
Proud, calm:--unloving and unloved 
Descending to the tomb. 

I let you speak and ne'er replied; 
I watched you for a space, 
Until that passionate glow, like youth, 
Had faded from your face. 

No anger showed I--nor complaint: 
My heart's beats shook no breath, 
Although I knew that I had found 
Her, who brings life or death; 

The woman, true as life or death; 
The love, strong as these twain, 
Against which seas of mortal fate 
Beat harmlessly in vain. 

'Not one true man': I hear it still, 
Your voice's clear cold sound, 
Upholding all your constant swains 
And good knights underground. 

'Not one true lover':--Woman, turn; 
I love you. Words are small; 
'T is life speaks plain: In twenty years 
Perhaps you may know all. 

I seek you. You alone I seek: 
All other women, fair, 
Or wise, or good, may go their way, 
Without my thought or care. 

But you I follow day by day, 
And night by night I keep 
My heart's chaste mansion lighted, where 
Your image lies asleep. 

Asleep! If e'er to wake, He knows 
Who Eve to Adam brought, 
As you to me: the embodiment 
Of boyhood's dear sweet thought, 

And youth's fond dream, and manhood's hope, 
That still half hopeless shone; 
Till every rootless vain ideal 
Commingled into one,-- 

You; who are so diverse from me, 
And yet as much my own 
As this my soul, which, formed apart, 
Dwells in its bodily throne;-- 

Or rather for that perishes, 
As these our two lives are 
So strangely, marvellously drawn 
Together from afar; 

Till week by week and month by month 
We closer seem to grow, 
As two hill streams, flushed with rich rain, 
Each into the other flow. 

I swear no oaths, I tell no lies, 
Nor boast I never knew 
A love-dream--we all dream in youth-- 
But waking, I found you, 

The real woman, whose first touch 
Aroused to highest life 
My real manhood. Crown it then, 
Good angel, friend, love, wife! 

Imperfect as I am, and you, 
Perchance, not all you seem, 
We two together shall bind up 
Our past's bright, broken dream. 

We two together shall dare look 
Upon the years to come, 
As travellers, met in far countrie, 
Together look towards home. 

Come home! The old tales were not false, 
Yet the new faith is true; 
Those saintly souls who made men knights 
Were women such as you. 

For the great love that teaches love 
Deceived not, ne'er deceives: 
And she who most believes in man 
Makes him what she believes. 

Come! If you come not, I can wait; 
My faith, like life, is long; 
My will--not little; my hope much: 
The patient are the strong. 

Yet come, ah come! The years run fast, 
And hearths grow swiftly cold-- 
Hearts too: but while blood beats in mine 
It holds you and will hold. 

And so before you it lies bare,-- 
Take it or let it lie, 
It is an honest heart; and yours 
To all eternity. 

A man said to the universe: 
"Sir I exist!" 
"However," replied the universe, 
"The fact has not created in me 
A sense of obligation

"A man saw a ball of gold in the sky; 
He climbed for it, 
And eventually he achieved it -- 
It was clay. 

Now this is the strange part: 
When the man went to the earth 
And looked again, 
Lo, there was the ball of gold. 
Now this is the strange part: 
It was a ball of gold. 
Aye, by the heavens, it was a ball of gold. 

A man toiled on a burning road, 
Never resting. 
Once he saw a fat, stupid ass 
Grinning at him from a green place. 
The man cried out in rage, 
"Ah! Do not deride me, fool! 
I know you -- 
All day stuffing your belly, 
Burying your heart 
In grass and tender sprouts: 
It will not suffice you
 

But the ass only grinned at him from the green place. 

A man walks slowly to his own grave 
And whether he stops or runs, 
A man walks slowly to his own grave
wherever he is, 
whatever he does, 
A man walks surely to his own grave. 

A man walks slowly 
When he has nowhere special to go-

A man walks slowly 
And has the time to look around
The flowers, the trees, 
 His own memories his dreams-

He walks slowly 
And enjoys his walking-
 
Who knows how much longer
He will be able to go on walking? 

He walks slowsly
He has nowhere special to go-

He enjoys the morning light
He is at home with the world and happy-

He walks slowly 
And the deity thundered loudly, 
Fat with rage, and puffing. 
"Kneel, mortal, and cringe 
And grovel and do homage 
To My Particularly Sublime Majesty
 


The man fled. 

And this one looked at him 
With soft eyes 
Lit with infinite comprehension, 
And said, "My poor child!"A man who would woo a fair maid,
Should 'prentice himself to the trade;
And study all day,
In methodical way,
How to flatter, cajole, and persuade.
He should 'prentice himself at fourteen
And practise from morning to e'en;
And when he's of age,
If he will, I'll engage,
It is purely a matter of skill,
Which all may attain if they will:
But every Jack
He must study the knack
If he wants to make sure of his Jill!

If he's made the best use of his time,
His twig he'll so carefully lime
That every bird
Will come down at his word.
Whatever its plumage and clime.
He must learn that the thrill of a touch
May mean little, or nothing, or much;
It's an instrument rare,
To be handled with care,
And ought to be treated as such.
It is purely a matter of skill,
Which all may attain if they will:
But every Jack,
He must study the knack
If he wants to make sure of his Jill!

Then a glance may be timid or free;
It will vary in mighty degree,
From an impudent stare
To a look of despair
That no maid without pity can see.
And a glance of despair is no guide -
It may have its ridiculous side;
It may draw you a tear
Or a box on the ear;
You can never be sure till you've tried.
It is purely a matter of skill,
Which all may attain if they will:
But every Jack
He must study the knack
If he wants to make sure of his Jill

I
First Love

THOUGH nurtured like the sailing moon
In beauty's murderous brood,
She walked awhile and blushed awhile
And on my pathway stood
Until I thought her body bore
A heart of flesh and blood.
But since I laid a hand thereon
And found a heart of stone
I have attempted many things
And not a thing is done,
For every hand is lunatic
That travels on the moon.
She smiled and that transfigured me
And left me but a lout,
Maundering here, and maundering there,
Emptier of thought
Than the heavenly circuit of its stars
When the moon sails out.

II
Human Dignity
Like the moon her kindness is,
If kindness I may call
What has no comprehension in't,
But is the same for all
As though my sorrow were a scene
Upon a painted wall.
So like a bit of stone I lie
Under a broken tree.
I could recover if I shrieked
My heart's agony
To passing bird, but I am dumb
From human dignity.

III
The Mermaid 
A mermaid found a swimming lad,
Picked him for her own,
Pressed her body to his body,
Laughed; and plunging down
Forgot in cruel happiness
That even lovers drown.

IV
The Death of the Hare
I have pointed out the yelling pack,
The hare leap to the wood,
And when I pass a compliment
Rejoice as lover should
At the drooping of an eye,
At the mantling of the blood.
Then' suddenly my heart is wrung
By her distracted air
And I remember wildness lost
And after, swept from there,
Am set down standing in the wood
At the death of the hare.

V
The Empty Cup
A crazy man that found a cup,
When all but dead of thirst,
Hardly dared to wet his mouth
Imagining, moon-accursed,
That another mouthful
And his beating heart would burst.
October last I found it too
But found it dry as bone,
And for that reason am I crazed
And my sleep is gone.

VI
His Memories
We should be hidden from their eyes,
Being but holy shows
And bodies broken like a thorn
Whereon the bleak north blows,
To think of buried Hector
And that none living knows.
The women take so little stock
In what I do or say
They'd sooner leave their cosseting
To hear a jackass bray;
My arms are like the twisted thorn
And yet there beauty lay;
The first of all the tribe lay there
And did such pleasure take --
She who had brought great Hector down
And put all Troy to wreck --
That she cried into this ear,
'Strike me if I shriek.'

VII
The Friends of his Youth
Laughter not time destroyed my voice
And put that crack in it,
And when the moon's pot-bellied
I get a laughing fit,
For that old Madge comes down the lane,
A stone upon her breast,
And a cloak wrapped about the stone,
And she can get no rest
With singing hush and hush-a-bye;
She that has been wild
And barren as a breaking wave
Thinks that the stone's a child.
And Peter that had great affairs
And was a pushing man
Shrieks, 'I am King of the Peacocks,'
And perches on a stone;
And then I laugh till tears run down
And the heart thumps at my side,
Remembering that her shriek was love
And that he shrieks from pride.

VIII
Summer and Spring
We sat under an old thorn-tree
And talked away the night,
Told all that had been said or done
Since first we saw the light,
And when we talked of growing up
Knew that we'd halved a soul
And fell the one in t'other's arms
That we might make it whole;
Then peter had a murdering look,
For it seemed that he and she
Had spoken of their childish days
Under that very tree.
O what a bursting out there was,
And what a blossoming,
When we had all the summer-time
And she had all the spring!

IX
The Secrets of the Old
I have old women's sectets now
That had those of the young;
Madge tells me what I dared not think
When my blood was strong,
And what had drowned a lover once
Sounds like an old song.
Though Margery is stricken dumb
If thrown in Madge's way,
We three make up a solitude;
For none alive to-day
Can know the stories that we know
Or say the things we say:
How such a man pleased women most
Of all that are gone,
How such a pair loved many years
And such a pair but one,
Stories of the bed of straw
Or the bed of down.

X
His Wildness
O bid me mount and sail up there
Amid the cloudy wrack,
For peg and Meg and Paris' love
That had so straight a back,
Are gone away, and some that stay
Have changed their silk for sack.
Were I but there and none to hear
I'd have a peacock cry,
For that is natural to a man
That lives in memory,
Being all alone I'd nurse a stone
And sing it lullaby.

XI
From 'Oedipus at Colonus'
Cease to remember the delights of youth, travel-wearied aged man;
Delight becomes death-longing if all longing else be vain.
Even from that delight memory treasures so,
Death, despair, division of families, all entanglements of mankind grow,
In the long echoing street the laughing dancers throng,
The bride is catried to the bridegroom's chamber
through torchlight and tumultuous song;
I celebrate the silent kiss that ends short life or long.
Never to have lived is best, ancient writers say;
Never to have drawn the breath of life, never to have
looked into the eye of day;
The second best's a gay goodnight and quickly turn away. 

Though nurtured like the sailing moon
In beauty's murderous brood,
She walked awhile and blushed awhile
And on my pathway stood
Until I thought her body bore
A heart of flesh and blood.

But since I laid a hand thereon
And found a heart of stone

And not a thing is done,

Were I a king in very truth,
And had a son - a guileless youth -
In probable succession;
To teach him patience, teach him tact,
How promptly in a fix to act,
He should adopt, in point of fact,
A manager's profession.
To that condition he should stoop
(Despite a too fond mother),
With eight or ten "stars" in his troupe,
All jealous of each other!
Oh, the man who can rule a theatrical crew,
Each member a genius (and some of them two),
And manage to humour them, little and great,
Can govern a tuppenny-ha'penny State!

Both A and B rehearsal slight -
They say they'll be "all right at night"
(They've both to go to school yet);
C in each act MUST change her dress,
D WILL attempt to "square the press";
E won't play Romeo unless
His grandmother plays Juliet;
F claims all hoydens as her rights
(She's played them thirty seasons);
And G must show herself in tights
For two convincing reasons -
Two very well-shaped reasons!
Oh, the man who can drive a theatrical team,
With wheelers and leaders in order supreme,
Can govern and rule, with a wave of his fin,
All Europe and Asia - with Ireland thrown in

At puberty time, a ripening maiden, 
autumn led me in
lit as if from inside a sphere
by the light of my reddening being-
pure and separate from the light of intellect
and senses. 

mellowness stains burn not me
but what is sourness in me, till what
remains of me, the sheer flavour of life-sweetness. 

Love was agape 
And earth too began to shake 
When they saw divine and his lover 
in a secret soul's bower 
hugging in adoration's lap

During blushing daybreak 
they surreptitiously escaped 
to roam on 
love drawn map 
on Venus landscapes 
Wherein flows, love kissed lakes 
tickled by devotion's sheldrakes 

The mansion 
adored by the ruby's swastika 
bedecked by diamond's obelisks: 
Wherein incandescent chandeliers, 
tease by romantic breeze 
sings the songs of divine bliss 

They retired in love's mansion, 
built ever for joyous occasion, 
Where jewels of balconies 
embraces the palaces, 
perching on rosy colonies 

They merge in each other 
till their breath stopped to labor. 
At last, their love for each other ceased 
For super soul and soul merged 
seamlessly without crease! 




There is a book, which we may call
(Its excellence is such)
Alone a library, though small;
The ladies thumb it much.

Words none, things numerous it contains:
And thing with words compared,
Who needs be told, that has his brains,
Which merits most regard?

Ofttimes its leaves of scarlet hue
A golden edging boast;
And open’d, it displays to view
Twelve pages at the most.

Nor name, nor title, stamp’d behind,
Adorns its outer part;
But all within ‘tis richly lined,
A magazine of art.

The whitest hands that secret hoard
Oft visit: and the fair
Preserve it in their bosoms stored,
As with a miser’s care.

Thence implements of every size,
And form’d for various use
(They need but to consult their eyes),
They readily produce.

The largest and the longest kind
Possess the foremost page;
A sort most needed by the blind,
Or nearly such, from age.

The full charged leaf which next ensues,
Presents in bright array
The smaller sort, which matrons use,
Not quite so blind as they.

The third, the fourth, the fifth supply
What their occasions ask,
Who with a more discerning eye
Perform a nicer task.

But still with regular decrease,
From size to size they fall,
In every leaf grow less and less;
The last are least of all.

Oh! what a fund of genius, pent
In narrow space is here!
This volume’s method and intent
How luminous and clear!

It leaves no reader at a loss
Or posed, whoever reads:
No commentator’s tedious gloss,
Nor even index needs.

Search Bodley’s many thousands o’er!
No book is treasured there,
Nor yet in Granta’s numerous store,
That may with this compare.

No!—rival none in either host
Of this was ever seen,
Or, that contents could justly boast,
So brilliant and so keen. 

Something forgotten for twenty years: though my fathers 
and mothers came from Cordova and Vitepsk and Caernarvon, 
and though I am a citizen of the United States and less a 
stranger here than anywhere else, perhaps, 
I am Essex-born: 
Cranbrook Wash called me into its dark tunnel, 
the little streams of Valentines heard my resolves, 
Roding held my head above water when I thought it was 
drowning me; in Hainault only a haze of thin trees 
stood between the red doubledecker buses and the boar-hunt, 
the spirit of merciful Phillipa glimmered there. 
Pergo Park knew me, and Clavering, and Havering-atte-Bower, 
Stanford Rivers lost me in osier beds, Stapleford Abbots 
sent me safe home on the dark road after Simeon-quiet evensong, 
Wanstead drew me over and over into its basic poetry, 
in its serpentine lake I saw bass-viols among the golden dead leaves, 
through its trees the ghost of a great house. In 
Ilford High Road I saw the multitudes passing pale under the 
light of flaring sundown, seven kings 
in somber starry robes gathered at Seven Kings 
the place of law 
where my birth and marriage are recorded 
and the death of my father. Woodford Wells 
where an old house was called The Naked Beauty (a white 
statue forlorn in its garden) 
saw the meeting and parting of two sisters, 
(forgotten? and further away 
the hill before Thaxted? where peace befell us? not once 
but many times?). 
All the Ivans dreaming of their villages 
all the Marias dreaming of their walled cities, 
picking up fragments of New World slowly, 
not knowing how to put them together nor how to join 
image with image, now I know how it was with you, an old map 
made long before I was born shows ancient 
rights of way where I walked when I was ten burning with desire 
for the world's great splendors, a child who traced voyages 
indelibly all over the atlas, who now in a far country 
remembers the first river, the first 
field, bricks and lumber dumped in it ready for building, 
that new smell, and remembers 
the walls of the garden, the first light. 

Dreary East winds howling o'er us;
Clay-lands knee-deep spread before us;
Mire and ice and snow and sleet;
Aching backs and frozen feet;
Knees which reel as marches quicken,
Ranks which thin as corpses thicken;
While with carrion birds we eat,
Calling puddle-water sweet,
As we pledge the health of our general, who fares as rough as we:
What can daunt us, what can turn us, led to death by such as he?


Eversley,  

The lovely terrific ground
Wears a paved path

And a glamorous glow: 
Unblocked by barren branches

Of premature spring.
Somewhere

The woods terminate –
Giving a kind of birth to a field.

And on that flat field
The grass still licks

And drinks the 
Rain of revival

From last night's 
Shimmering showers.

A young girl's tricycle 
Cuts a puddle on the path.

Each half rains down on the pavement –
Sprinkling it with dots.

I once
Was the one to make that happen. 

Bursting bloom of beauty
Bringing on a scented swoon
Rose-beds, fully-clad trees
Flowering into a fragrant finery
Melody of the mirthful muse
Melting the melancholic mood.




A MARCH in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown;
   A route through a heavy wood, with muffled steps in the darkness;
   Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating;
   Till after midnight glimmer upon us, the lights of a dim-lighted
         building;
   We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim-lighted
         building;
   'Tis a large old church at the crossing roads--'tis now an impromptu
         hospital;
   --Entering but for a minute, I see a sight beyond all the pictures
         and poems ever made:
   Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and
         lamps,
   And by one great pitchy torch, stationary, with wild red flame, and
         clouds of smoke;
   By these, crowds, groups of forms, vaguely I see, on the floor, some
         in the pews laid down;                                       At my feet more distinctly, a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of
         bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen;)
   I staunch the blood temporarily, (the youngster's face is white as a
         lily;)
   Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene, fain to absorb
         it all;
   Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity,
         some of them dead;
   Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether,
         the odor of blood;
   The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms of soldiers--the yard
         outside also fill'd;
   Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the
         death-spasm sweating;
   An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders or calls;
   The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the
         torches;
   These I resume as I chant--I see again the forms, I smell the
         odor;                                                        Then hear outside the orders given, Fall in, my men, Fall in;
   But first I bend to the dying lad--his eyes open--a half-smile gives
         he me;
   Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,
   Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,
   The unknown road still marching. 



We mix from many lands,
        We march for very far;
     In hearts and lips and hands
        Our staffs and weapons are;
The light we walk in darkens sun and moon and star.

     It doth not flame and wane
        With years and spheres that roll,
     Storm cannot shake nor stain
        The strength that makes it whole,
The fire that moulds and moves it of the sovereign soul.

     We are they that have to cope
        With time till time retire;
     We live on hopeless hope,
        We feed on tears and fire;
Time, foot by foot, gives back before our sheer desire.

     From the edge of harsh derision,
        From discord and defeat,
     From doubt and lame division,
        We pluck the fruit and eat;
And the mouth finds it bitter, and the spirit sweet.

     We strive with time at wrestling
        Till time be on our side
     And hope, our plumeless nestling,
        A full-fledged eaglet ride
Down the loud length of storm its windward wings divide.

     We are girt with our belief,
        Clothed with our will and crowned;
     Hope, fear, delight, and grief,
        Before our will give ground;
Their calls are in our ears as shadows of dead sound.

     All but the heart forsakes us,
        All fails us but the will;
     Keen treason tracks and takes us
        In pits for blood to fill;
Friend falls from friend, and faith for faith lays wait to kill.

     Out under moon and stars
        And shafts of the urgent sun
     Whose face on prison-bars
        And mountain-heads is one,
Our march is everlasting till time's march be done.

     Whither we know, and whence,
        And dare not care wherethrough.
     Desires that urge the sense,
        Fears changing old with new,
Perils and pains beset the ways we press into;

     Earth gives us thorns to tread,
        And all her thorns are trod;
     Through lands burnt black and red
        We pass with feet unshod;

     Through the great desert beasts
        Howl at our backs by night,
     And thunder-forging priests
        Blow their dead bale-fires bright,
And on their broken anvils beat out bolts for fight.

     Inside their sacred smithies
        Though hot the hammer rings,
     Their steel links snap like withies,
        Their chains like twisted strings,
Their surest fetters are as plighted words of kings.

     O nations undivided,
        O single people and free,
     We dreamers, we derided,
        We mad blind men that see,
We bear you witness ere ye come that ye shall be.

     Ye sitting among tombs,
        Ye standing round the gate,
     Whom fire-mouthed war consumes,
        Or cold-lipped peace bids wait,
All tombs and bars shall open, every grave and grate.

     The locks shall burst in sunder,
        The hinges shrieking spin,
     When time, whose hand is thunder,
        Lays hand upon the pin,
And shoots the bolts reluctant, bidding all men in.

     These eyeless times and earless,
        Shall these not see and hear,
     And all their hearts burn fearless
        That were afrost for fear?
Is day not hard upon us, yea, not our day near?

     France! from its grey dejection
        Make manifest the red
     Tempestuous resurrection
        Of thy most sacred head!
Break thou the covering cerecloths; rise up from the dead.

     And thou, whom sea-walls sever
        From lands unwalled with seas,
     Wilt thou endure for ever,
        O Milton's England, these?
Thou that wast his Republic, wilt thou clasp their knees?

     These royalties rust-eaten,
        These worm-corroded lies,
     That keep thine head storm-beaten
        And sunlike strength of eyes
From the open heaven and air of intercepted skies;

     These princelings with gauze winglets
        That buzz in the air unfurled,
     These summer-swarming kinglets,
        These thin worms crowned and curled,
That bask and blink and warm themselves about the world;

     These fanged meridian vermin,
        Shrill gnats that crowd the dusk,
     Night-moths whose nestling ermine
        Smells foul of mould and musk,
Blind flesh-flies hatched by dark and hampered in their husk;

     These honours without honour,
        These ghost-like gods of gold,
     This earth that wears upon her
        To keep her heart from cold
No memory more of men that brought it fire of old;

     These limbs, supine, unbuckled,
        In rottenness of rest,
     These sleepy lips blood-suckled
        And satiate of thy breast,
These dull wide mouths that drain thee dry and call thee blest;

     These masters of thee mindless
        That wear thee out of mind,
     These children of thee kindless
        That use thee out of kind,
Whose hands strew gold before thee and contempt behind;

     Who have turned thy name to laughter,
        Thy sea-like sounded name
     That now none hearkens after
        For faith in its free fame,
Who have robbed thee of thy trust and given thee of their shame;

     These hours that mock each other,
        These years that kill and die,
     Are these thy gains, our mother,
        For all thy gains thrown by?
Is this that end whose promise made thine heart so high?

     With empire and with treason
        The first right hand made fast,
     But in man's nobler season
        To put forth help the last,
Love turns from thee, and memory disavows thy past.

     Lest thine own sea disclaim thee,
        Lest thine own sons despise,
     Lest lips shoot out that name thee
        And seeing thee men shut eyes,
Take thought with all thy people, turn thine head and rise.

     Turn thee, lift up thy face;
        What ails thee to be dead?
     Ask of thyself for grace,
        Seek of thyself for bread,
And who shall starve or shame thee, blind or bruise thine head?

     The same sun in thy sight,
        The same sea in thine ears,
     That saw thine hour at height,
        That sang thy song of years,
Behold and hearken for thee, knowing thy hopes and fears.

     O people, O perfect nation,
        O England that shall be,
     How long till thou take station?
        How long till thralls live free?
How long till all thy soul be one with all thy sea?

     Ye that from south to north,
        Ye that from east to west,
     Stretch hands of longing forth
        And keep your eyes from rest,
Lo, when ye will, we bring you gifts of what is best.

     From the awful northland pines
        That skirt their wan dim seas
     To the ardent Apennines
        And sun-struck Pyrenees,
One frost on all their frondage bites the blossoming trees.

     The leaves look up for light,
        For heat of helpful air;
     The trees of oldest height
        And thin storm-shaken hair
Seek with gaunt hands up heavenward if the sun be there.

     The woods where souls walk lonely,
        The forests girt with night,
     Desire the day-star only
        And firstlings of the light
Not seen of slaves nor shining in their masters' sight.

     We have the morning star,
        O foolish people, O kings!
     With us the day-springs are,
        Even all the fresh day-springs;
For us, and with us, all the multitudes of things.

     O sorrowing hearts of slaves,
        We heard you beat from far!
     We bring the light that saves,
        We bring the morning star;
Freedom's good things we bring you, whence all good things are.

     With us the winds and fountains
        And lightnings live in tune;
     The morning-coloured mountains
        That burn into the noon,
The mist's mild veil on valleys muffled from the moon:

     The thunder-darkened highlands
        And lowlands hot with fruit,
     Sea-bays and shoals and islands,
        And cliffs that foil man's foot,
And all the flower of large-limbed life and all the root:

     The clangour of sea-eagles
        That teach the morning mirth
     With baying of heaven's beagles
        That seek their prey on earth,
By sounding strait and channel, gulf and reach and firth.

     With us the fields and rivers,
        The grass that summer thrills,
     The haze where morning quivers,
        The peace at heart of hills,
The sense that kindles nature, and the soul that fills.

     With us all natural sights,
        All notes of natural scale;
     With us the starry lights;
        With us the nightingale;
With us the heart and secret of the worldly tale.

     The strife of things and beauty,
        The fire and light adored,
     Truth, and life-lightening duty,
        Love without crown or sword,
That by his might and godhead makes man god and lord.

     These have we, these are ours,
        That no priests give nor kings;
     The honey of all these flowers,
        The heart of all these springs;
Ours, for where freedom lives not, there live no good things.

     Rise, ere the dawn be risen;
        Come, and be all souls fed;
     From field and street and prison
        Come, for the feast is spread;
Live, for the truth is living; wake, for night is dead. 





   how beautiful the sea is: 
still and blue. 
The orange blossom in the breezes 
drifting through. 
The skylark in its glory 
has your accent too: 
Here, Margarita, is a story 
made for you. 

A king there was and far away, 
with a palace of diamonds
and a shopfront made of day. 
He had a herd of elephants,

A kiosk, more, of malachite, 
and a robe of rarest hue 
also a princess who was light 
of thought and beautiful as you. 

But one afternoon the princess 
saw high in the heavens appear
a star, and being mischievous,
resolved at once to bring it near. 

It would form the centrepiece 
of a brooch hung with verse, pearl, 
feathers, flowers: a caprice
of course of a little girl. 

But also, because a princess, 
exquisite, delicate like you, 
the others then cut irises 
roses, asters: as girls do. 

But, alas, our little one went far
across the sea, beneath the sky,
and all to cut the one white star
that saw her wondering and sigh.


She went beyond where the heavens are
and to the moon said, au revoir.
How naughty to have flown so far
without the permission of Papa. 

She returned at last, and though gone 
from the high heavens of accord, 
still there hung about and shone 

Which the king noted, said: you, 
child, drive me past despair, 
but what is that strange, shining dew 
on your hands, your face, your hair? 

She spoke the truth; her words shine 
with the clear lightness of the air: 
I went to seek what should be mine 
in that blue immensity up there. 

Are then the heavens for our display, 
with things that you must touch? 
You can be altogether too outre, 

To hear that I am sorry, truly, 
for I had no plans as such. But, 
once across the windy sky and sea 
I had so much that flower to cut. 

Whereupon, in punishment,
the king said, I'd be much beholden
if you'd go this moment and consent
to return what you have stolen.

So sad was then our little princess 
looking at her sweet flower of light, 
until and smiling at her distress 

Those fields are as I willed them,
and your rose but signatory
to the flowers up there that children
have in dreaming formed of me.

Again the king is laughing, brilliant 
in his robes's rich royalty, 
he troops the herd of elephant, 
in their four hundred, by the sea. 

Adored and delicate, the princess 
is once more a little girl 
who keeps for brooch the star and, yes, 
the flowers, and the feathers, the pearl. 

Beautiful, Margarita, the sea is, 
still and blue:
with your sweet breath have all the breezes 
blossomed too. 

Now soon from me and far you'll be,
but, little one, stay true
to a gentle thought made a story
once for you. 

The Princess and the Star

Margarita, the sea lies fair,
And from the bowers
The winds bring a subtle scent
Of orange flowers.

In my soul a lark is singing—
Your voice, my dear!
I am going to tell you a story.
Sit down and hear!

There once was a mighty monarch,
With a palace of diamonds bright,
And elephants in a stately troop,
And a tent that was made of light,

And a tower of malachite costly,
And a mantle of gorgeous hue,
And a fair little, sweet little princess,
As pretty, my darling, as you.

One evening the princess, gazing,
Saw a star in the heaven's afar.
She was mischievous, surely, the princess—
She wanted to gather that star.

To adorn for her bosom a breastpin
She wished it, the dear little girl, 
Along with the verse of a poet,
A feather, a flower and a pearl.

It seems dainty princesses, darling,
Are much as you are today,
For lilies they pick, and roses,
And stars. They are made that way!

So she went, the lovely princess,
O'er the sea, and under the sky,
To cut the white star that she longed for
From the vault of the heavens on high.

She went up by the moon, and farther,
On that beautiful summer eve;
But the bad thing was that she went away
Without asking her father's leave.

In the heaven's azure height,
She was seen all wrapt in a glory soft,
In a splendor sweet and bright.

And the king said: 'What were you doing?
I have looked for you everywhere.
And what is that on your bosom
That burns with a light so fair?'

The princess told no falsehood;
She gave him an answer true.
'I went to gather my star,' she said,
'From the heavens vast and blue.'

The king cried, 'Oh, what madness!
What a fancy strange and wild!
I told you no one must touch the sky.

'I meant no harm,' she answered;
'I went, I don't know why
Across the waves, in the blowing wind,
And I cut the star from the sky.'

Said her father, 'You must be punished.
Go back to the sky once more,
For what you stole from the shining heights
To its place you must restore.'

The princess grew pale and mournful
For her lovely flower of light;
His smile it was sweet and bright.

'In my country's fields up yonder
I gave her that rose,' said he.
'My flowers belong to the little girls
Who think and who dream of me.'

The king donned glittering garments,
And there by the shore he made
Four hundred elephants tall and grave
March past in a grand parade.

And the princess is fair to look on,
With her breatpin, the happy girl;
For it shines with the star, with a poet's verse,
With a feather, a flower and a pearl!

Margarita, the sea lies fair;
The breezes clear
Waft orange blossoms' fragrance—
Your breath, my dear!

Ere long you will be far distant,
But keep, little girl, I pray,
A kindly thought of the friend who tried
To tell you a tale one day

a being sentences to be a measure of a universe
is a marginal artist always on the edge
of a 'neath-beyond-abyss

In some force of nature
He reaches for her
Time and time again.
And time after time
She soothes his fevered brow, 
Calms and strokes the fury in him.
A marriage of sea and shore
Embracing only one another; 
And yearning for nothing more
They thrash and crash about.
The going has always been rough but
They cling to their life in one another; 
Knowing separately each would die there.
But together, their dance continues
Painting a mesmorizing beauty; 
Timeless and enduring 
Through sunshine as well as storm. 

We met
under a shower
of bird-notes.
Fifty years passed,
love's moment
in a world in
servitude to time.
She was young;
I kissed with my eyes
closed and opened
them on her wrinkles.
`Come,' said death,
choosing her as his
partner for
the last dance, And she,
who in life
had done everything
with a bird's grace,
opened her bill now
for the shedding
of one sigh no
heavier than a feather. 

A marriage of two
is for love that is true

A marriage of two
is always something new

A marriage of two
happens sometimes out of the blue

A marriage of two
is worth it when its due

A marriage of two
is a marriage of trust
Many can find themselves lost
It can be an expensive cost

They are only very few
who have a clue
of when love accrues

A marriage of two
is about love making
It is not about
money raking

A marriage of two
can be bad
A marriage of two
can be sad
You should only be glad if
A marriage of two
is for love that is true

Remember me
On bended knee
And lonely, too, 
In an autumn park
Confessing love
In a marriage plea.

Both of us
With melancholy souls
Made promises
We meant to keep.

From youth
Down through
Eternal and classical ages
You were meant
To remain my only dream.

Kissing as adoring grandchildren
Played like angelic spirits
At our feet, 
Knowing we overcame the odds
That break asunder weaker emotional bonds, 
But now, it will never be, 
And I lost more of myself
Than I kept
When we parted ways
With no intentions
Of ever meeting again. 

THERE was a marriage-table where One sate, 
Haply, unnoticed, till they craved His aid: 
Thenceforward does it seem that He has made 
All virtuous marriage-tables consecrate: 
And so, at this, where without pomp or state 
We sit, and only say, or mute, are fain 
I think that He who 'in the midst' doth wait 
Oft-times, would not abjure our prayerful cheer, 
But, as at Cana, list with gracious ear 
To us, beseeching, that the Love divine 
May ever at their household table sit, 
Make all His servants who encompass it, 
And change life's bitterest waters into wine. 

Fowl (hen)  and dog entering into Brahmin’s house is bad! 
A married wife who is disobedient to the husband is too bad! 
Wearing a sari (dress)  which is not folded and thick is also bad! 
Likewise, a king who is not protecting his country is very bad

Five months after being mauled by 
his illusionist, Bernard J. Ebber reported 
the scheme he’d devised. "I can gaze 
out my window and see people who look like stars: they build 
a great part of my remote personality and make 
life bearable on Mars for example – the last resort of 
our cosmopolitan lifestyle. Successful applicants, 
they play a key role, utilising the latest 
scenes, mismanaging the lost, solo." 
    A few grey hairs sprouted
casually through a tattoo as he spoke 
and beamed at them from billboards 
over the weeks that followed. How words 
beat against the pane was his subject – and how, 
when sidling up to the bar, he’d hitch his briefs, 
screen his soliloquies and pass the legal 
tender where they’d kicked him. But 
the show he put on, though true, was 
convincing. People marvelled 
at the way he insisted on flickering 
on and off he’d go, developing black 
hole technology, keeping in touch 
with old friends. 

A mask is something we all wear

to hide the frightened child inside.

We fear one day the mask will tear, 

and take away our place to hide.

"What then, " a childish voice will say, 

from deep inside the adult frame.

The mask hides pain of dues to pay, 

so useful when concealing shame.

There's greed and pity, yes and love, 

Grief felt for friends that die, despair, 

some thoughts we felt unworthy of, 

a mask is something we all wear.




 
July his earth where I packed
My flesh and bones from dust
And dashed a weaker me a rib
It is possible
It is plausible
At least so said the great book

wish to see true face
smile and talk of theirs untrue
diplomatic frauds

wand, and, with eerie, sharp, imperious ejaculations, addressing the
bespelled auditors, who neither see nor hear her nor suspect her

Summer or Winter or Spring or Fall,--
Which do you like the best of all?


LITTLE JASPER

When I'm dressed warm as warm can be,
And with boots, to go
Through the deepest snow,
Winter-time is the time for me!



Summer or Winter or Spring or Fall,--
Which do you like the best of all?


LITTLE MILDRED

I like blossoms, and birds that sing;
The grass and the dew,
And the sunshine, too,--
So, best of all I like the Spring.



Summer or Winter or Spring or Fall,--
Which do you like the best of all?


LITTLE MANDEVILLE

O little friends, I most rejoice
When I hear the drums
As the Circus comes,--
So Summer-time's my special choice.



Summer or Winter or Spring or Fall,--
Which do you like the best of all?


LITTLE EDITH

Apples of ruby, and pears of gold,
And grapes of blue
That the bee stings through.--
Fall--it is all that my heart can hold!



Soh! my lovelings and pretty dears,
You've _each_ a favorite, it appears,--
Summer and Winter and Spring and Fall.--
A massacre is not a massacre..
By Ghassan Hage/ professor of anthropology and social theory at the University of Melbourne.

I don’t write poems but, in any case, poems are not poems.

Long ago, I was made to understand that Palestine was not Palestine; 
I was also informed that Palestinians were not Palestinians; 
They also explained to me that ethnic cleansing was not ethnic cleansing.
And when naive old me saw freedom fighters they patiently showed me that they were not freedom fighters, and that resistance was not resistance.
And when, stupidly, I noticed arrogance, oppression and humiliation they benevolently enlightened me so I can see that arrogance was not arrogance, oppression was not oppression, and humiliation was not humiliation.

I saw misery, racism, inhumanity and a concentration camp.
But they told me that they were experts in misery, racism, inhumanity and concentration camps and I have to take their word for it: this was not misery, racism, inhumanity and a concentration camp.
Over the years they’ve taught me so many things: invasion was not invasion, occupation was not occupation, colonialism was not colonialism and apartheid was not apartheid.

They opened my simple mind to even more complex truths that my poor brain could not on its own compute like: "having nuclear weapons" was not "having nuclear weapons, " "not having weapons of mass destruction" was "having weapons of mass destruction."

And, democracy (in the Gaza Strip)   was not democracy.
Having second class citizens (in Israel)   was democracy.
So you’ll excuse me if I am not surprised to learn today that there were more things that I thought were evident that are not: peace activists are not peace activists, piracy is not piracy, the massacre of unarmed people is not the massacre of unarmed people.

I have such a limited brain and my ignorance is unlimited.
And they’re so fucking intelligent. Really.

I'd rather be Master than mister
mister's a meaningless word
It's simply a title you're given
To mark you as one of the herd; 
A Master controls his own destiny
He's always ahead of the game
A mister is slave to conformity
A Master is proud of his name.

(Written Dec If love were what the rose is, 
And I were like the leaf, 
Our lives would grow together 
In sad or singing weather, 
Blown fields or flowerful closes, 
Green pasture or gray grief; 
If love were what the rose is, 
And I were like the leaf. 

If I were what the words are, 
And love were like the tune, 
With double sound and single 
Delight our lips would mingle, 
With kisses glad as birds are 
That get sweet rain at noon; 
If I were what the words are, 
And love were like the tune. 

If you were life, my darling, 
And I your love were death, 
We'd shine and snow together 
Ere March made sweet the weather 
With daffodil and starling 
And hours of fruitful breath; 
If you were life, my darling, 
And I your love were death. 

If you were thrall to sorrow, 
And I were page to joy, 
We'd play for lives and seasons 
With loving looks and treasons 
And tears of night and morrow 
And laughs of maid and boy; 
If you were thrall to sorrow, 
And I were page to joy. 

If you were April's lady, 
And I were lord in May, 
We'd throw with leaves for hours 
And draw for days with flowers, 
Till day like night were shady 
And night were bright like day; 
If you were April's lady, 
And I were lord in May. 

And I were king of pain, 
We'd hunt down love together, 
Pluck out his flying-feather, 
And teach his feet a measure, 
And find his mouth a rein; 
And I were king of pain. 

As I walked home
with you tonight
Just like my heart
The moon was bright.

The stars like ours
were twinkling eyes
A match made in heaven, 
Oh sweet surprise.   :)She had a heart made of pure evil, black in appearance
Beautiful she was, known to be a woman of perseverance
Hung on revenge for being born into this world
A life bent on the thought of making every man pay

Most women drove toward lesbianism, a sin she saw too great
Her hate was manifested deeper than simply changing her plate
She defiled her own body with an infected man
The smile on her face revealed to Satan she'd accomplish her plan

A seductress who tainted once high esteemed men
Contaminated politicians in the public's eye lyin to them
Caught in the webs of a womanly arachnid 
Each stuck on their own separate strand from the disease they contracted

She's a Black Widow literally with multiple men under her belt
Killed without ever finding the killer but the pain was still felt
In the weakest moments of my life I fell into her trap
Allured by her distorted beauty, but I kept going back

She took on a fondness with me, she knew of my mind state 
How naïve I was and so young, a distinguished woman with a blind mate
How perfect we'd be together never stressin or fightin
Voices reached only a certain height, then we'd put it in writin

Love between two completely different beings no way it could fail
A match made in heaven that set the fires in hell
We bore children together and from each of our seeds
Generally generated a generation with this deadly disease

I knew what she and I shared but at this point it didn't matter
We used our hands to shield each other's ears from the pessimist's chatter
Seein as we came out of their mouths, we remained in their thoughts
The men discovered for hypocrisy by those whose silence they bought

As we grew older in age, so did our kids
They loved their mommy and daddy and followed the things that we did
It was amazing to see the newfound ways to expand
Our poison was in the air and all that took a breath wore our brand

And when the water evaporated, it did away with the stench
The same rank that made the clouds and drinking water that filled up a trench
People kissed and rejoiced for the lives that they lived
And we're the gifts to them that'll eternally give

The genetic make up for the generations millenniums after ours
Will still have our DNA inside them, trapped like fireflies in a jar


WEARY already, weary miles to-night
I walked for bed: and so, to get some ease,
I dogged the flying moon with similes.
And like a wisp she doubled on my sight
In ponds; and caught in tree-tops like a kite;
And in a globe of film all liquorish
Swam full-faced like a silly silver fish;—
Last like a bubble shot the welkin's height
Where my road turned, and got behind me, and sent
My wizened shadow craning round at me,
And jeered, "So, step the measure,—one two three!"
And if I faced on her, looked innocent.
But just at parting, halfway down a dell,
She kissed me for good-night. So you'll not tell. 

This is now--this was erst,
Proposition the first--and Problem the first.

I.
On a given finite Line
Which must no way incline;
To describe an equi--
--lateral Tri--
--A, N, G, L, E.
Now let A. B.
Be the given line
Which must no way incline;
The great Mathematician
Makes this Requisition,
That we describe an Equi--
--lateral Tri--
--angle on it:
Aid us, Reason--aid us, Wit!

II.
From the centre A. at the distance A. B.
Describe the circle B. C. D.
At the distance B. A. from B. the centre
The round A. C. E. to describe boldly venture.
(Third Postulate see.)
And from the point C.
In which the circles make a pother
Cutting and slashing one another,
Bid the straight lines a journeying go,
C. A., C. B. those lines will show.
To the points, which by A. B. are reckon'd,
And postulate the second
For Authority ye know.
A. B. C.
Triumphant shall be
An Equilateral Triangle,
Not Peter Pindar carp, not Zoilus can wrangle.

III.
Because the point A. is the centre
Of the circular B. C. D.
And because the point B. is the centre
Of the circular A. C. E.
A. C. to A. B. and B. C. to B. A.
Harmoniously equal for ever must stay;
Then C. A. and B. C.
Both extend the kind hand
To the basis, A. B.
Unambitiously join'd in Equality's Band.
But to the same powers, when two powers are equal,
My mind forbodes the sequel;
My mind does some celestial impulse teach,
And equalises each to each.
Thus C. A. with B. C. strikes the same sure alliance,
That C. A. and B. C. had with A. B. before;
And in mutual affiance,
None attempting to soar
Above another,
The unanimous three
C. A. and B. C. and A. B.
All are equal, each to his brother,
Preserving the balance of power so true:
Ah! the like would the proud Autocratorix do!
At taxes impending not Britain would tremble,
Nor Prussia struggle her fear to dissemble;
Nor the Mah'met-sprung Wight,
The great Mussulman
Would stain his Divan
With Urine the soft-flowing daughter of Fright.

IV.
But rein your stallion in, too daring Nine!
Should Empires bloat the scientific line?
Or with dishevell'd hair all madly do ye run
For transport that your task is done?
For done it is--the cause is tried!
And Proposition, gentle Maid,
Who soothly ask'd stern Demonstration's aid,
Has prov'd her right, and A. B. C.
Of Angles three
Is shown to be of equal side;
And now our weary steed to rest in fine,
'Tis rais'd upon A. B. the straight, the given line. 

I now realise the value of time.
In less than a quarter, our distances have been multiplied.
Our communication has been divided.

In the moments to come, I hope to add more special memories, 
And subtract the obstacles of our relationship.

May the intensity of our love be inversely proportional to every wave that falls in the Niagara. 

May our Love for each other expand into the universe, and
May it be then integrated with the Higher Source
Until time reaches infinity, and beyond. 

Death inevitable and unavoidable
Life fragile and transient
Reincarnate what returns
Dead meat and bones left over
Wise words and poetry
Like dead sea scrolls
Alive as long as living holds. 

Time in a bottle; 
sands of time
running out of time.
IF there is 
a time to be born
and a time to die, 
is there enough time
and for what? 
Is time on my side; 
is it friend
or enemy? 
And why is it getting faster
while I am getting slower, 
and
what is that
infernal ticking

It matters little what you gather, 
On life's pathway, day by day; 
It's the seeds you sow or scatter
That will flourish, on your way.

If you sow with love and kindness
Daily, in the deeds you do; 
Compassion is not known for blindness, 
Good things will return to you.

Take your greed and hate and envy, 
Park them on life's pathway gate.
Down the road I'm sure you will see
All the good things that await.

Fulfill your life with work you love, 
Take a little time for play; 
Seek some comfort from above, 
Live your life, just day by day.

If your life becomes unnerving, 
Seemingly in disarray, 
Lighten up your load by serving.
Far, far better is that way. 

Though meadow-ways as I did tread,
The corn grew in great lustihead,
And hey! the beeches burgeoned.
It is the month, the jolly month,
It is the jolly month of May.

And wenches for the marriage-day,
And boys to teach love's comely play.
It is the month, the jolly month,
It is the jolly month of May.

As I went down by lane and lea,
The daisies reddened so, pardie!
'Blushets!' I said, 'I well do see,
The thing ye think of in this month,
Heigho! this jolly month of May.'

As down I went by rye and oats,
The blossoms smelt of kisses; throats
Of birds turned kisses into notes;
The kiss it is a growing flower,
I trow, this jolly month of May.

Seeing the blossom of this bliss
By gathering doth grow, certes!
Thy brow-garland pushed all aslant
Tells - but I tell not, wanton May

The sun shines fair on Tweedside, the river flowing bright,
Your heart is full of pleasure, your eyes are full of light,
Your cheeks are like the morning, your pearls are like the dew,
Or morning and her dew-drops are like your pearls and you.

Because you are a princess, a princess of the land,
You will not turn your lightsome eyes a moment where I stand,
A poor unnoticed poet, a-making of his rhymes;
But I have found a mistress, more fair a thousand times.

`Tis May, the elfish maiden, the daughter of the Spring,
Upon whose birthday morning the birds delight to sing.
They would not sing one note for you, if you should so command,
Although you are a princess, a princess of the land. 

Deprived of root, and branch and rind,
Yet flowers I bear of every kind:
And such is my prolific power,
They bloom in less than half an hour;
Yet standers-by may plainly see
They get no nourishment from me.
My head with giddiness goes round,
And yet I firmly stand my ground:
All over naked I am seen,
No couple-beggar in the land
E'er joined such numbers hand in hand.
I joined them fairly with a ring;
Nor can our parson blame the thing.
And though no marriage words are spoke,
They part not till the ring is broke;
Yet hypocrite fanatics cry,
I'm but an idol raised on high;
And once a weaver in our town,
I lay a prisoner twenty years,
And then the jovial cavaliers
To their old post restored all three - 
I mean the church, the king, and me. 

Though frankincense the deities require,
We must not give all to the hallow'd fire.
Such be our gifts, and such be our expense,
As for ourselves to leave some frankince


A very meaning of sympathy.
As the others look the other way.
Hand to mouth, child to child.
As the rich man plays with his toys.
the children down the road have none.
Empty in being
empty in matter.
As the spirit of compassion runs away
they look into another day.
Old man Johnson did say, 'The children are our future, '
As they enter into their destiny. 

Sounds
When they follow you like dogs
In the forest of silence, 
Itch-afflicted, skeletal loneliness
When it litters
Offspring of dreams
In shallow ponds of evenings; 
The crows perched
On branches of the sun
Then fly away. 

Intruders brought in
by the Administrator
a stick in his hand

they get out of hand
of the Administrator
a bomb in the streets


I'm just a mediocre man
     Of no high-brow pretence;
A comfortable life I plan
     With care and commonsense.
I do the things most people do,
     I echo what they say;
And through my morning paper view
     The problems of the day.

No doubt you think I'm colourless,
     Profoundly commonplace;
And yet I fancy, more or less,
     I represent the race.
My name may stand for everyone,
     At least for nine in ten,
For all in all the world is run
     By mediocre men.

Of course you'll maybe not agree
     That you are average,
And unlike ordinary me
     You strut your little stage,
Well, you may even own a Bank,
     And mighty mergers plan,
But Brother, doff your tile and thank
     The Mediocre Man. 

You are a Tulip seen to-day,
But, Dearest, of so short a stay,
That where you grew, scarce man can say.

You are a lovely July-flower;
Yet one rude wind, or ruffling shower,
Will force you hence, and in an hour.

You are a sparkling Rose i'th' bud,
Yet lost, ere that chaste flesh and blood
Can show where you or grew or stood.

You are a full-spread fair-set Vine,
And can with tendrils love entwine;
Yet dried, ere you distil your wine.

You are like Balm, enclosed well
In amber, or some crystal shell;
Yet lost ere you transfuse your smell.

You are a dainty Violet;
Yet wither'd, ere you can be set
Within the virgins coronet.

But die you must, fair maid, ere long,
As he, the maker of this song. 

FOR one throb of the artery,
While on that old grey stone I Sat
Under the old wind-broken tree,
I knew that One is animate,
Mankind inanimate fantasy'. 

I sat beside the glowing grate, fresh heaped
With Newport coal, and as the flame grew bright
--The many-coloured flame--and played and leaped,
I thought of rainbows and the northern light,
Moore's Lalla Rookh, the Treasury Report,
And other brilliant matters of the sort.

And last I thought of that fair isle which sent
The mineral fuel; on a summer day
I saw it once, with heat and travel spent,
And scratched by dwarf-oaks in the hollow way;
Now dragged through sand, now jolted over stone--
A rugged road through rugged Tiverton.

And hotter grew the air, and hollower grew
The deep-worn path, and horror-struck, I thought,
Where will this dreary passage lead me to?
This long dull road, so narrow, deep, and hot?
I looked to see it dive in earth outright;
I looked--but saw a far more welcome sight.

Like a soft mist upon the evening shore,
At once a lovely isle before me lay,
Smooth and with tender verdure covered o'er,
As if just risen from its calm inland bay;
Sloped each way gently to the grassy edge,
And the small waves that dallied with the sedge.

The barley was just reaped--its heavy sheaves
Lay on the stubble field--the tall maize stood
Dark in its summer growth, and shook its leaves--
And bright the sunlight played on the young wood--
For fifty years ago, the old men say,
The Briton hewed their ancient groves away.

I saw where fountains freshened the green land,
And where the pleasant road, from door to door,
With rows of cherry-trees on either hand,
Went wandering all that fertile region o'er--
Rogue's Island once--but when the rogues were dead,
Rhode Island was the name it took instead.

Beautiful island! then it only seemed
A lovely stranger--it has grown a friend.
I gazed on its smooth slopes, but never dreamed
How soon that bright magnificent isle would send
The treasures of its womb across the sea,
To warm a poet's room and boil his tea.

Dark anthracite! that reddenest on my hearth,
Thou in those island mines didst slumber long;
But now thou art come forth to move the earth,
And put to shame the men that mean thee wrong.
Thou shalt be coals of fire to those that hate thee,
And warm the shins of all that underrate thee.

Yea, they did wrong thee foully--they who mocked
Thy honest face, and said thou wouldst not burn;
Of hewing thee to chimney-pieces talked,
And grew profane--and swore, in bitter scorn,
That men might to thy inner caves retire,
And there, unsinged, abide the day of fire.

Yet is thy greatness nigh. I pause to state,
That I too have seen greatness--even I--
Shook hands with Adams--stared at La Fayette,
When, barehead, in the hot noon of July,
He would not let the umbrella be held o'er him,
For which three cheers burst from the mob before him.

And I have seen--not many months ago--
An eastern Governor in chapeau bras
And military coat, a glorious show!
Ride forth to visit the reviews, and ah!
How oft he smiled and bowed to Jonathan!
How many hands were shook and votes were won!

'Twas a great Governor--thou too shalt be
Great in thy turn--and wide shall spread thy fame,
And swiftly; farthest Maine shall hear of thee,
And cold New Brunswick gladden at thy name,
And, faintly through its sleets, the weeping isle
That sends the Boston folks their cod shall smile.

For thou shalt forge vast railways, and shalt heat
The hissing rivers into steam, and drive
Huge masses from thy mines, on iron feet,
Walking their steady way, as if alive,
Northward, till everlasting ice besets thee,
And south as far as the grim Spaniard lets thee.

Thou shalt make mighty engines swim the sea,
Like its own monsters--boats that for a guinea
Will take a man to Havre--and shalt be
The moving soul of many a spinning-jenny,
And ply thy shuttles, till a bard can wear
As good a suit of broadcloth as the mayor.

Then we will laugh at winter when we hear
The grim old churl about our dwellings rave:
Thou, from that 'ruler of the inverted year,'
Shalt pluck the knotty sceptre Cowper gave,
And pull him from his sledge, and drag him in,
And melt the icicles from off his chin.- O'er uplands fresh swift sped my sleigh-
A light snow fell; along the way
Stood firs and birches slender.
The former pondered deep, alone,
The latter laughed, their white boughs shone;-
All brings a picture tender.

So light and free is now the air;
Of all its burdens stripped it bare
The snow with playful sally.
I glimpse behind its veil so thin
A landscape gay, and high within
A snow-peak o'er the valley.

But from the border white and brown,
Where'er I look, there's peeping down
A face- but whose, whose is it?
I bore my gaze 'neath cap and brim
And see the snowflakes swarm and swim;-
Will some one here me visit?

A star fell on my glove- right here-
And here again- its unlike peer;-
They will with riddles pose me.
And smiles that in the air abound
From eyes so good- I look around-
'T is memory besnows me.

The stars spin fine their filigree,
Can hidden spirits in it be?
There haunts me something awing-
You finer birch, you snow unstained,
You purer air,-a soul you've gained?
Who is it here now drawing

His features dear in nature's face,
In all this fascinating grace,
In falling stars that cheat me,-
In these white gleams that finely glance,
In all this silent rhythmic dance?-
Hans Brecke!-comes to meet me. 

On a sheer peak of joy we meet;
Below us hums the abyss;
Death either way allures our feet
If we take one step amiss.

One moment let us drink the blue
Transcendent air together—
Then down where the same old work’s to do
In the same dull daily weather.

We may not wait . . . yet look below!
How part? On this keen ridge
But one may pass. They call you—go!
My life shall be your bridg. 

In a dream I meet
my dead friend. He has,
I know, gone long and far,
and yet he is the same
for the dead are changeless.
They grow no older.
It is I who have changed,
grown strange to what I was.
Yet I, the changed one,
ask: "How you been?"
He grins and looks at me.
"I been eating peaches
off some mighty fine trees

"AS evening shaped I found me on a moor
        Which sight could scarce sustain:
     The black lean land, of featureless contour,
        Was like a tract in pain.

     "This scene, like my own life," I said, "is one
        Where many glooms abide;
     Toned by its fortune to a deadly dun--
        Lightless on every side.

     I glanced aloft and halted, pleasure-caught
        To see the contrast there:
     The ray-lit clouds gleamed glory; and I thought,
        "There's solace everywhere!"

     Then bitter self-reproaches as I stood
        I dealt me silently
     As one perverse--misrepresenting Good
        In graceless mutiny.

     Against the horizon's dim-descerned wheel
        A form rose, strange of mould:
     That he was hideous, hopeless, I could feel
        Rather than could behold.

     "'Tis a dead spot, where even the light lies spent
        To darkness!" croaked the Thing.
     "Not if you look aloft!" said I, intent
        On my new reasoning.

     "Yea--but await awhile!" he cried. "Ho-ho!--
        Look now aloft and see!"
     I looked. There, too, sat night: Heaven's radiant show
        Had gone. Then chuckled he. 

For some days I have been hearing them
Though, I do not understand the meaning
It goes straight to my heart, through the ears
The tone, the voice and the chord all melancholy

My heart understands the pain of the voice
While my mind listens to the tunes 
The trees and the mountain keep still
While the river makes the noise

Could it be the loss of love or the life? 
The pain I hear is the cry of a fear
And the wounds have cracked by tears
Such a song does settle inside

The birds are listening and the wind is rustling
Silent is the sky, dry leaves gets settled
The voice goes high as the song is nearing the end
With low pitch the melancholy song shy


Thy melody and my lyrics
will make a song
a melodious song
the song of enthusiasm
the song of peace
the song of fraternity

If my lyrics is a flower
thy melody is thee fragrance

If my lyrics is a ray
thy melody is thee light

If my lyrics is cloud
thy melody is thee lightning

my lyrics is a cascade
thy melody is thee sound

my lyrics and thee melody
is the consistency of profound nature
having multi seasons
to nourish all creature
to embellish the earth
whispering the gale
to blow like spring

my lyrics is nectar
thee melody is sweetness

my lyrics and thee melody
will make a song of heaven. 

He was small for a Marine, 
The dying boy there in the bed.
Three times he'd fought off cancer
but now, inside his head, 
a serious infection
would claim his life instead.

Cody Green was only twelve.
All his life he'd loved the Corps.
They made him a navigator, 
The insignia he wore.
An honorary soldier
A marine in time of war.

The crises was upon him.
He would not win this fight
A fellow member of the Corps
Stood honor guard all night

There would be a flag draped coffin
for this member of the Corps.

READ AT THE MEETING HELD AT MUSIC HALL,
FEBRUARY   IN MEMORY OF DR. SAMUEL G. HOWE


I.

Thy soldier's fight is won!
Master, whose lowly path he trod,
Thy servant's work is done!

No voice is heard from Sinai's steep
Our wandering feet to guide;
From Horeb's rock no waters leap;
No Jordan's waves divide;

No prophet cleaves our western sky
On wheels of whirling fire;
No shepherds hear the song on high
Of heaven's angelic choir.

Yet here as to the patriarch's tent
He comes on heaven's high errand sent,
In earth's poor raiment drest.

We see no halo round his brow
Till love its own recalls,
And, like a leaf that quits the bough,
The mortal vesture falls.

In autumn's chill declining day,
Ere winter's killing frost,
The message came; so passed away
The friend our earth has lost.

Still, Father, in thy love we trust;
Forgive us if we mourn
The saddening hour that laid in dust
His robe of flesh outworn.


II.

How long the wreck-strewn journey seems
To reach the far-off past
That woke his youth from peaceful dreams
With Freedom's trumpet-blast.

Along her classic hillsides rung
The Paynim's battle-cry,
And like a red-cross knight he sprung
For her to live or die.

No trustier service claimed the wreath
For Sparta's bravest son;
No truer soldier sleeps beneath
The mound of Marathon;

Yet not for him the warrior's grave
In front of angry foes;
To lift, to shield, to help, to save,
The holier task he chose.

He touched the eyelids of the blind,
And lo! the veil withdrawn,
As o'er the midnight of the mind
He led the light of dawn.

He asked not whence the fountains roll
No traveller's foot has found,
But mapped the desert of the soul
Untracked by sight or sound.

What prayers have reached the sapphire throne,
By silent fingers spelt,
For him who first through depths unknown
His doubtful pathway felt,

Who sought the slumbering sense that lay
Close shut with bolt and bar,
And showed awakening thought the ray
Of reason's morning star.

Where'er he moved, his shadowy form
The sightless orbs would seek,
And smiles of welcome light and warm
The lips that could not speak.

No labored line, no sculptor's art,
Such hallowed memory needs;
His tablet is the human heart,
His record loving deeds.


III.

The rest that earth denied is thine,--
Ah, is it rest? we ask,
Or, traced by knowledge more divine,
Some larger, nobler task?

Had but those boundless fields of blue
One darkened sphere like this;
But what has heaven for thee to do
In realms of perfect bliss?

No cloud to lift, no mind to clear,
No rugged path to smooth,
No struggling soul to help and cheer,
No mortal grief to soothe!

Enough; is there a world of love,
No more we ask to know;
The hand will guide thy ways above
That shaped thy task below. 

I took a shot, 
Or maybe two; 
Something to take away this thought.

Now I've got to wait it out, 
'Cause I'm too dizzy to walk about.
Unfortunately, it didn't help, 
My misery has turned to agony.

In darkness I sit, unable to cry; 
A curse bestowed by this life of mine.
When finally the tears do spill, 
They're blacker than night and hotter than h*ll.

Pain is making me numb, you see.
All because of a memory. 

Four ducks on a pond,
A grass-bank beyond, 
A blue sky of spring, 
White clouds on the wing; 
What a little thing 
To remember for years- 
To remember with tears

She had an other-worldly air,
So like a flower she grew,
As if her thoughts and feelings were
The only life she knew.
She moved in other ways apart,
As in a secret place,
And the emotion of her heart
Seemed breathing in her face.
It was as if a faery power
Had charmed her with its mood,
And graced her with the dreamy dower
Of earthly angelhood.
And when Death touched her starry brow,
It seemed as if it were
The dream she was became somehow
Another dream of her. 

Somewhile before the dawn I rose, and stept
 Softly along the dim way to your room,
 And found you sleeping in the quiet gloom,
And holiness about you as you slept.
I knelt there; till your waking fingers crept
 About my head, and held it.  I had rest
 Unhoped this side of Heaven, beneath your breast.
I knelt a long time, still; nor even wept.

It was great wrong you did me; and for gain
Of that poor moment's kindliness, and ease,
And sleepy mother-comfort!
                            Child, you know
How easily love leaps out to dreams like these,
Who has seen them true.  And love that's wakened so
Takes all too long to lay asleep again. 

I had no past
I had no future
I was always now
rushing to its silent end
sea sheltered salt scented
infatuated murmur
dying in a wave
grain spelled I simply melted
within a sea blue grave
oblivion


Father the word itself makes me happy
My dear father is no more here
Went in aboard years back alone
Leaving his family for world's mercy
Somehow managed to swim across the river
Somehow got a livelihood in world
My father encouraged me to learn
And try always to read in better ways
Act upon the conscience, he taught me
And at last breathed his last, in perfect calm
His soul may be rested in peace in heavens
The journey of life here I continues
Father, the privileged position of human being
No one dare to question the position
The symbol of love, and motivation
Father, who gave the nice word to fatherhood. 

When June comes dancing o'er the death of May, 
With scarlet roses tinting her green breast, 
And mating thrushes ushering in her day, 
And Earth on tiptoe for her golden guest, 

I always see the evening when we met-- 
The first of June baptized in tender rain-- 
And walked home through the wide streets, gleaming wet, 
Arms locked, our warm flesh pulsing with love's pain. 

I always see the cheerful little room, 
And in the corner, fresh and white, the bed, 
Sweet scented with a delicate perfume, 
Wherein for one night only we were wed; 

Where in the starlit stillness we lay mute, 
And heard the whispering showers all night long, 
And your brown burning body was a lute 
Whereon my passion played his fevered song. 

When June comes dancing o'er the death of May, 
With scarlet roses staining her fair feet, 
My soul takes leave of me to sing all day 
A love so fugitive and so complete. 

THE moments passed as at a play;
I had the wisdom love brings forth;
I had my share of mother-wit,
And yet for all that I could say,
And though I had her praise for it,
A cloud blown from the cut-throat North
Suddenly hid Love's moon away.
Believing every word I said,
I praised her body and her mind
Till pride had made her eyes grow bright,
And pleasure made her cheeks grow red,
And vanity her footfall light,
Yet we, for all that praise, could find
Nothing but darkness overhead.
We sat as silent as a stone,
We knew, though she'd not said a word,
That even the best of love must die,
And had been savagely undone
Were it not that Love upon the cry
Of a most ridiculous little bird
Tore from the clouds his marvellous moon.
ALTHOUGH crowds gathered once if she but showed her face,
And even old men's eyes grew dim, this hand alone,
Like some last courtier at a gypsy camping-place
Babbling of fallen majesty, records what's gone.
These lineaments, a heart that laughter has made sweet,
These, these remain, but I record what-s gone.  A crowd
Will gather, and not know it walks the very street
Whereon a thing once walked that seemed a burning cloud


A Memory Returned


His body maybe in winter
his spirits still in spring
climbing up the neighbor's tree
pinching apples for himself to eat.
Carefree running down the 
shore, building castles like 
he had done so many times before.
Carelessly when in his youth
he even swam still in his boots.
He looked for adventure in every way
they always brighten up his day
from one adventure to another
nothing could stop this mischief maker.

His gentle smile then slips away
back into his winter time again. 

Everyday I look at you, 
What I see has changed over the years, 
But what I see is you not me. 
I haven't changed, 
That simply can't be, 
I must still be the young person, 
Who stood before you, 
Oh so long, long ago, 
Where or where did all of that time go! 

Look, let me turn on the light, 
There, you can see me all right? 

Come over here, I would like to see, 
Maybe it is not me after all. 
Surely, I don't live in the past, 
Let's just get out of here fast. 

Now, I never go by another mirror, 
Life is just far too short, 
I cannot stand what I see 
And I don't want to fail either you or me. 

You see life is short, 
And we are just a mere reflection, 
Not of what we are, 
But what we want to be. 

last night where the soul's sorrow was a mate, 

  last night where she found  one start, 

an  end of a falling tear, or perhaps a newborn of a pain.. 

last night where a start left a trace of rain in her  cloudy eyes.  

calling he who knows how to dive in oceans of her  hidden emotions, who invade the soul. . 

 who could find where are the holes of a traveling ship, 
who could  be a captain for her trip,  

. her sleep which used to escape in a waiting shape, 

while  waiting for  little hope.  

. . 

for a healer to 

eradicate the 

killer of the souls.. 

to knot that broken rope. 

  the seeker seek  arts of reading soaring hearts, 

 an artist in  listening, singing, reading others' arts   

  before tasting that pleasure of a sailor's  arrival.. 

before  the arrival knocks her doors.  

she found him on his shores and again ready to depart.  

Brightly dawns our wedding day;
Joyous hour, we give thee greeting!
Whither, whither art thou fleeting?
Fickle moment, prithee stay!
What though mortal joys be hollow?
Pleasures come, if sorrows follow.
Though the tocsin sound, ere long,
Ding dong!  Ding dong!
Yet until the shadows fall
Over one and over all,
Sing a merry madrigal -
Fal la!

Let us dry the ready tear;
Though the hours are surely creeping,
Little need for woeful weeping
Till the sad sundown is near.
All must sip the cup of sorrow,
I to-day and thou to-morrow:
This the close of every song -
Ding dong!  Ding dong!
What though solemn shadows fall,
Sooner, later, over all?
Sing a merry madrigal -
Fal la

sprinkling dance like a pouring snow
fluttering flute decorate a flurry show
tribal trance soothe a shy fellow
sol sol la do mi re fa la si do

clapping chorus awake 
love verses we always take
chanting inside pleasure dome
O what an amazing adventure to home! 

O du bist mein mond! 
gelebter traum, der sich lohnt
das beruehrt mich
ewig bin ich

O du bist mein sonne! 
O liebe wonne! 
das beruehrt mich

O bunte reihe! 
O wunderbare ruhe! 
das beruehrt mich
ewig bin ich

O bunte blaetter! 
O fruehlingsgewaesser! 
das beruehrt mich

jiggling rhymes flush bluish sky
rounding gala blush firefly
sacred spell resounds

mellowing cello sing
our hearts are flowing
catchy tunes mesmerize
O flamboyant hypnotize! 

in the chamber 
of a cosy widow, where old ornaments 
dusted to death by the feathers of ostrich, 
sit on polished shelves; 
where a soldier in khaki, glares at me 
from behind glass. 

She comes out of the bathroom, 
and turns his photo.  

to 'about turn' and face 
the lily patterned wall. 

To have a Way with Words, 
Then you must talk a simple talk, 
Laced in with Fantasy, you walk, 
Not cross the line of the absurd.

Explain your feelings, have the touch, 
Of vivid words that say so much! 
Communication, vital too, 
Sincerity, It must be You, 
The message fits the messenger, 
That never says, 'World, I don't care'O, master poet 
Write something 
On your slate and show
To the world 
An epic stamped on your foot
A trail of your footprints
The pages of your history
And the museum of the world.

Give the world a cloak 
Against colour Or creed
Give the world a song
A sonorous song to heal
Hate and war
Your slate is beckoning on 
The avenging truce
And the truth of the singing poet
Is calling the ears of the world
Give us o, muse
A lasting poem
To give posterity
A new beginning. 

You have the grit and the guts, I know; 
You are ready to answer blow for blow 
You are virile, combative, stubborn, hard, 
But your honor ends with your own back-yard; 
Each man intent on his private goal, 
You have no feeling for the whole; 
What singly none would tolerate 
You let unpunished hit the state, 
Unmindful that each man must share 
The stain he lets his country wear, 
And (what no traveller ignores) 
That her good name is often yours. 


You are proud in the pride that feels its might; 
From your imaginary height 
Men of another race or hue 
Are men of a lesser breed to you: 
The neighbor at your southern gate 
You treat with the scorn that has bred his hate. 
To lend a spice to your disrespect 
You call him the "greaser". But reflect! 
The greaser has spat on you more than once; 
He has handed you multiple affronts; 
He has robbed you, banished you, burned and killed; 
He has gone untrounced for the blood he spilled; 
He has jeering used for his bootblack's rag 
The stars and stripes of the gringo's flag; 
And you, in the depths of your easy-chair -- 
What did you do, what did you care? 
Did you find the season too cold and damp 
To change the counter for the camp? 
Were you frightened by fevers in Mexico? 
I can't imagine, but this I know -- 
You are impassioned vastly more 
By the news of the daily baseball score 
Than to hear that a dozen countrymen 
Have perished somewhere in Darien, 
That greasers have taken their innocent lives 
And robbed their holdings and raped their wives. 


Not by rough tongues and ready fists 
Can you hope to jilt in the modern lists. 
The armies of a littler folk 
Shall pass you under the victor's yoke, 
Sobeit a nation that trains her sons 
To ride their horses and point their guns -- 
Sobeit a people that comprehends 
The limit where private pleasure ends 
And where their public dues begin, 
A people made strong by discipline 
Who are willing to give -- what you've no mind to -- 
And understand -- what you are blind to -- 
The things that the individual 
Must sacrifice for the good of all. 


You have a leader who knows -- the man 
Most fit to be called American, 
A prophet that once in generations 
Is given to point to erring nations 
Brighter ideals toward which to press 
And lead them out of the wilderness. 
Will you turn your back on him once again? 
Will you give the tiller once more to men 
Who have made your country the laughing-stock 
For the older peoples to scorn and mock, 
Who would make you servile, despised, and weak, 
A country that turns the other cheek, 
Who care not how bravely your flag may float, 
Who answer an insult with a note, 
Whose way is the easy way in all, 
And, seeing that polished arms appal 
Their marrow of milk-fed pacifist, 
Would tell you menace does not exist? 
Are these, in the world's great parliament, 
The men you would choose to represent 
Your honor, your manhood, and your pride, 
And the virtues your fathers dignified? 
Oh, bury them deeper than the sea 
In universal obloquy; 
Forget the ground where they lie, or write 
For epitaph: "Too proud to fight
 



I have been too long from my country's shores 
To reckon what state of mind is yours, 
But as for myself I know right well 
I would go through fire and shot and shell 
And face new perils and make my bed 
In new privations, if ROOSEVELT led; 
But I have given my heart and hand 
To serve, in serving another land, 
Ideals kept bright that with you are dim; 
Here men can thrill to their country's hymn, 
For the passion that wells in the Marseillaise 
Is the same that fires the French these days, 
And, when the flag that they love goes by, 
With swelling bosom and moistened eye 
They can look, for they know that it floats there still 
By the might of their hands and the strength of their will, 
And through perils countless and trials unknown 
Its honor each man has made his own. 
They wanted the war no more than you, 
But they saw how the certain menace grew, 
And they gave two years of their youth or three 
The more to insure their liberty 
When the wrath of rifles and pennoned spears 
Should roll like a flood on their wrecked frontiers. 
They wanted the war no more than you, 
But when the dreadful summons blew 
And the time to settle the quarrel came 
They sprang to their guns, each man was game; 
And mark if they fight not to the last 
For their hearths, their altars, and their past: 
Yea, fight till their veins have been bled dry 
For love of the country that WILL not die. 


O friends, in your fortunate present ease 
(Yet faced by the self-same facts as these), 
If you would see how a race can soar 
That has no love, but no fear, of war, 
How each can turn from his private role 
That all may act as a perfect whole, 
How men can live up to the place they claim 
And a nation, jealous of its good name, 
Be true to its proud inheritance, 
Oh, look over here and learn from FRANCE

You are a lethal disease 
And if you are defeated it isn't done by ease. 
No one could  find a cure against you. 
All the world hate you, yes they do! ! 

You deprive a son from his mother. 
You deprive a daughter from her father. 
You cause an intense pain to your patients.
But some people conquer you by their patience.

I hope you stop breaking hearts 
and leave this planet and depart 
We won't give up and rise the white flag. 
We will prevent your silly brag.

I know you were created by our great Creator 

RIP who died from cancer or any other disease. 

protect us from this disease.. 

Huddled up in the cloister of her hair
beyond red lips her teeth - white rosary
It's all she needs to be a nun in privacy.

Huddled up in the veil of her hair
beyond red lips her teeth - white seeds
It's all she needs to sow longings. 

A metaphor, the ultimate actor.
Let’s mix it into a Whisky blend.
To rhyme or not to rhyme, 
That is the question.
Let’s go for no.
That metaphor –
A fusion of words and meanings.
Compound image.
Subtle synthesis of correlations coalesced.
Marriage of minds.
Beyond comparison.

The poet, weaver of words, 
Composing symphonies
Of spoken sounds.
Mixing metaphors: 
Chemical brews
Of nectar, 
For all to savour
In the theatre
Of the written page. 

you are my sunshine
that made my dusk life bright
but burnt and blind meif you look up at the sky's dark shore
and see the flash of a meteor, 
and instead of fading, it seems more bright
you might soon be dead from a meteorite

I love to sit alone, and dream,
And dream, and dream;
In fancy's boat to softly glide
Along some stream
Where fairy palaces of gold
And crystal bright
Stand all along the glistening shore:
A wondrous sight.

My craft is built of ivory,
With silver oars,
The sails are spun of golden threads,
And priceless stores
Of precious gems adorn its prow,
And 'round its mast
An hundred silken cords are set
To hold it fast.

My galley-slaves are sprightly elves
Who, as they row,
And as their shining oars they swing
Them to and fro,
Keep time to music wafted on
The scented air,
Made by the mermaids as they comb
Their golden hair.

And I the while lie idly back,
And dream, and dream,
And let them row me where they will
Adown the stream. 

He's sitting front and center
As we toast him here today; 
'Tis sad he'll ne'er reenter, 
His youth, once bright and gay.

Despite his promising career, 
His darling wife and kids; 
We hope the spectors lurking near
Won't send him into skids.

You see, he's turning big  
Oh! The trauma of it all.
His spring and summer came and went
And up ahead looms fall.

Now, at life's epicenter, 
Bereaved with loss of fun; 
To see what's waiting down the road, 
Just grab life's ball and run. 

It's a silent night and half a truth. 

A MIDSUMMER NOON IN THE AUSTRALIAN FOREST 

Not a bird disturbs the air! 
There is quiet everywhere; 
Over plains and over woods 
What a mighty stillness broods. 

Even the grasshoppers keep 
[All the birds and insects keep] 
Where the coolest shadows sleep; 
Even the busy ants are found 
Resting in their pebbled mound; 
Even the locust clingeth now 
In silence to the barky bough: 
And over hills and over plains 
Quiet, vast and slumbrous, reigns. 

Only there's a drowsy humming 
From yon warm lagoon slow coming: 
'Tis the dragon-hornet - see! 
All bedaubed resplendently 
With yellow on a tawny ground - 
Each rich spot nor square nor round, 
But rudely heart-shaped, as it were 
The blurred and hasty impress there, 
Of vermeil-crusted seal 
Dusted o'er with golden meal: 
Only there's a droning where 
Yon bright beetle gleams the air - 
Gleams it in its droning flight 
[Tracks it in its gleaming flight] 
With a slanting track of light, 
Till rising in the sunshine higher, 
[Rising in the sunshine higher,] 
Its shards flame out like gems on fire. 
[Till its shards flame out like fire.] 

Every other thing is still, 
Save the ever wakeful rill, 
Whose cool murmur only throws 
A cooler comfort round Repose; 
Or some ripple in the sea 
Of leafy boughs, where, lazily, 
Tired Summer, in her forest bower 
Turning with the noontide hour, 
Heaves a slumbrous breath, ere she 
Once more slumbers peacefully. 

'tis easeful here to lie 
Hidden from Noon's scorching eye, 
In this grassy cool recess 
Musing thus of Quietness.

Half Child—Half Heroine—
An Orleans in the Eye
That puts its manner by
For humbler Company
When none are near
Even a Tear—
Its frequent Visitor—

Were not so shy
Of Goer by—
And Hands—so slight—
They would elate a Sprite
With Merriment—

A Voice that Alters—Low
And on the Ear can go
Like Let of Snow—
Or shift supreme—
As tone of Realm
On Subjects Diadem—

Too small—to fear—
Too distant—to endear—
And so Men Compromise
And just—revere—She winged into my life as a migrant bird
Her beauty held my breath
Cupid was all over me 
But I faltered, was she an illusion? 

Her poetic bust moved my heart
As if the earth spilled out all its beauty
Her blue eyes were a deep sea
With waves of gems and jewels

Mirage of gems I chanced upon
I dived into the glitter of the sea
But returned empty handed
I searched her as someone 
Who glints in eternity? 

Is love on my brow? 
Again I will lead a vagabond life
No pity for missing you, my dear
Perhaps I'll win this love in my next birth

Alas! I will keep the pebbles in my heart
Be happy with that hope
I will treasure the pebbles as a token of love
Till my last breath, till we meet

O who will walk a mile with me
Along life's merry way?
A comrade blithe and full of glee,
Who dares to laugh out loud and free,
And let his frolic fancy play,
Like a happy child, through the flowers gay
That fill the field and fringe the way
Where he walks a mile with me.

And who will walk a mile with me
Along life's weary way?
A friend whose heart has eyes to see
The stars shine out o'er the darkening lea,
And the quiet rest at the end o' the day,--
A friend who knows, and dares to say,
The brave, sweet words that cheer the way
Where he walks a mile with me.

With such a comrade, such a friend,
I fain would walk till journeys end,
Through summer sunshine, winter rain,
And then?--Farewell, we shall meet again

THO' to Antiquity the Praise we yield 
Of pleasing Arts; and Fable's earli'st Field 
Own to be fruitful Greece; yet not so clean 
Those Ears were reap'd, but still there's some to glean; 
And from the Lands of vast Invention come 
Daily new Authors, with Discov'ries home. 

This curious Piece, which I shall now impart, 
Fell from Malherbe, a Master in his Art, 
To Racan, fill'd with like poetick Fire, 
Both tuneful Servants of Apollo's Choir: 
Rivals and Heirs to the Horatian Lyre: 
Who meeting him, one Day, free and alone, 
(For still their Thoughts were to each other known) 
Thus ask'd his Aid–Some useful Counsel give, 
Thou who, by living long, hast learnt to live; 
Whose Observation nothing can escape; 
Tell me, how I my course of Life shall shape: 
To something I wou'd fix ere't be too late. 
You know my Birth, my Talents, my Estate: 
Shall I with these content, all Search resign, 
And to the Country my Desires confine? 
Or in the Court, or Camp, advancement gain? 
The World's a mixture of Delight and Pain: 
Tho' rough it seems, there's Pleasure in the Wars, 
And Hymen's Joys are not without their Cares. 
I need not ask, to what my Genius tends, 
But wou'd content the World, the Court, my Friends. 


Please all the World (in haste) Malherbe replies? 
How vain th' Attempt will prove in him, that tries, 
Learn from a Fable, I have somewhere found, 
Before I answer all that you propound. 


A Miller and his Son (the Father old, 
The Boy about some fifteen Years had told) 
Designed their Ass to sell, and for the Fair, 
Some distance off, accordingly prepare. 
But lest she in the walk should lose her Flesh, 
And not appear, for Sale, so full and fresh, 
Her Feet together ty'd; between them two 
They heav'd her up; and on the Rusticks go: 
Till those, who met them bearing thus the Ass, 
Cry'd, Are these Fools about to act a Farce? 
Surely the Beast (howe'er it seem to be) 
Is not the greatest Ass of all the Three. 
The Miller in their Mirth his Folly finds, 
And down he sets her, and again unbinds; 
And tho' her grumbling shew'd, she lik'd much more 
The lazy way, she travell'd in before, 
He minds her not; but up the Boy he sets 
Upon her Back, and on the Crupper gets. 
Thus on they jog, when of Three Men that pass'd, 
The eldest thinking Age to be disgrac'd, 
Call'd to the Youth, ho! you, young Man for shame! 
Come down, lest Passengers your Manners blame, 
And say, it ill becomes your tender Years 
To ride before a Grandsire with grey Hairs. 
Truly, the Gentlemen are in the right, 
The Miller cries, and makes the Boy alight; 
Then forward slides himself into his place, 
And with a Mind content renews his pace: 
But much he had not gain'd upon his way, 
Before a Troop of Damsels, neat and gay, 
(Partial to Youth) to one another cry'd, 
See, how with walking by that Dotard's side, 
The Boy is tir'd; whilst with a Prelate's state 
He rides alone, and dangling in the Seat, 
Hangs like a Calf thrown up, across the Beast. 
The Miller, thinking to have spoiled that Jest, 
Reply'd, he was too Old for Veal to pass, 
But after more on him, and on his Ass, 
He stands convinc'd, and takes his Son again 
To ride at ease himself, still next the Mane. 
Yet ere he'd thirty Paces borne the Lad, 
The next they met, cry'd--Are these Fellows mad! 
Have they no Pity thus t'o'erload the Jade! 
Sure, at the Fair, they for her Skin may trade. 
See, how's she spent, and sinks beneath their strokes! 
The Miller, whom this most of all provokes, 
Swears by his Cap, he shews his want of Brains, 
Who thus to please the World, bestows his Pains. 
Howe'er we'll try, if this way't may be done; 
And off he comes, and fetches down his Son. 
Behind they walk, and now the Creature drive, 
But cou'd no better in their Purpose thrive; 
Nor scape a Fellow's Censure, whom they meet, 
That cries, to spare the Ass they break their Feet; 
And whilst unladen at her ease she goes, 
Trudge in the Dirt, and batter out their Shooes; 
As if to burthen her they were afraid, 
And Men for Beasts, not Beasts for Men were made. 

The Proverb right, the Cart before the Horse. 
The Miller, finding things grow worse and worse, 
Cries out, I am an Ass, it is agreed, 
And so are all, who wou'd in this succeed. 
Hereafter, tho' Reproof or Praise I find, 
I'll neither heed, but follow my own Mind, 
Take my own Counsel, how my Beast to sell. 
This he resolv'd, and did it, and did well. 


For you, Sir, Follow Love, the Court, the War; 
Obtain the Crosier, or the City's Furr; 
Live single all your Days, or take a Wife; 
Trust me, a Censure waits each state of Life. 

without knowing
who i am
without knowing
my role here
unlike my body
my mind fears
unlike my body
which feels at home
with the air around
with all forces befriended
my body feels stable
and at home
my mind
not knowing
it is the source of all
everything is it's making
without knowing
it is the pivot of all
my mind fears

body-
a natural animal
mind -
a human in the making
to find the soulmind game
seems to have
become life itself

what do i do? 
to corner him
what is his weakness? 
to which will he surrender

smilingly and diplomatically
we play this wormy game
not realizing
we are all GREAT HUMANS

Though not violent
though there is no blood shed
this is even worse.  

very soon
we will just have a human form


We look for meaning in many things, 
Hope for something that life might bring.

But poetry's just a bunch of words, 
And love is just a feeling.

Everyday we wake up, a world within a world, 
Hoping we'll find more meaning in a verb.

But words are just imaginings, 
And feelings are just a symphony of thoughts.

We drink, laugh, have a good time, or at least try, 
But in the end two words matter; Good bye.

And imaginings are just the product of a mind, 
And thoughts are just a whim gone wild.

Existence, a facade we do our best to forget, 
But all it ever means is that we live with regret.

And a mind is just a piece of meat.
And a whim is something we'll never get. 

I have wished a bird would fly away,
And not sing by my house all day;

Have clapped my hands at him from the door
When it seemed as if I could bear no more.

The fault must partly have been in me.
The bird was not to blame for his key.

And of course there must be something wrong
In wanting to silence any song. 

I am a shell. From me you shall not hear 
The splendid tramplings of insistent drums, 
The orbed gold of the viol's voice that comes, 
Heavy with radiance, languorous and clear. 
Yet, if you hold me close against the ear, 
A dim, far whisper rises clamorously, 
The thunderous beat and passion of the sea, 
The slow surge of the tides that drown the mere. 

Others with subtle hands may pluck the strings, 
Making even Love in music audible, 
And earth one glory. I am but a shell 
That moves, not of itself, and moving sings; 
Leaving a fragrance, faint as wine new-shed, 
A tremulous murmur from great days long dead. 

Across the dimly lighted room 
The violin drew wefts of sound, 
Airily they wove and wound 
And glimmered gold against the gloom.

I watched the music turn to light, 
But at the pausing of the bow, 
The web was broken and the glow 
Was drowned within the wave of night. 

She plucked a blossom fair to see;
Upon my coat I let her pin it;
And thus we stood beneath the tree
A minute.

She turned her smiling face to me;
I saw a roguish sweetness in it;
I kissed her once;—it took, maybe,
A minute.

The time was paltry, you’ll agree;
It took but little to begin it;
But since my heart has not been free
A minute. 

At six o'clock we were waiting for coffee, 
waiting for coffee and the charitable crumb 
that was going to be served from a certain balcony 
--like kings of old, or like a miracle. 
It was still dark. One foot of the sun 
steadied itself on a long ripple in the river. 

The first ferry of the day had just crossed the river. 
It was so cold we hoped that the coffee 
would be very hot, seeing that the sun 
was not going to warm us; and that the crumb 
would be a loaf each, buttered, by a miracle. 
At seven a man stepped out on the balcony. 

He stood for a minute alone on the balcony 
looking over our heads toward the river. 
A servant handed him the makings of a miracle, 
consisting of one lone cup of coffee 
and one roll, which he proceeded to crumb, 
his head, so to speak, in the clouds--along with the sun. 

Was the man crazy? What under the sun 
was he trying to do, up there on his balcony! 
Each man received one rather hard crumb, 
which some flicked scornfully into the river, 
and, in a cup, one drop of the coffee. 
Some of us stood around, waiting for the miracle. 

I can tell what I saw next; it was not a miracle. 
A beautiful villa stood in the sun 
and from its doors came the smell of hot coffee. 
In front, a baroque white plaster balcony 
added by birds, who nest along the river, 
--I saw it with one eye close to the crumb-- 

and galleries and marble chambers. My crumb 
my mansion, made for me by a miracle, 
through ages, by insects, birds, and the river 
working the stone. Every day, in the sun, 
at breakfast time I sit on my balcony 
with my feet up, and drink gallons of coffee. 

We licked up the crumb and swallowed the coffee. 
A window across the river caught the sun 
as if the miracle were working, on the wrong balcony. 

Were I thy bride,
Then the whole world beside
Were not too wide
To hold my wealth of love -
Were I thy bride!
Upon thy breast
My loving head would rest,
As on her nest
The tender turtle-dove -
Were I thy bride!

This heart of mine
Would be one heart with thine,
And in that shrine
Our happiness would dwell -
Were I thy bride!
And all day long
Our lives should be a song:
No grief, no wrong
Should make my heart rebel -
Were I thy bride!

The silvery flute,
The melancholy lute,
Were night-owl's hoot
To my low-whispered coo -
Were I thy bride!
The skylark's trill
Were but discordance shrill
To the soft thrill
Of wooing as I'd woo -
Were I thy bride!

The rose's sigh
Were as a carrion's cry
To lullaby
Such as I'd sing to thee -
Were I thy bride!
A feather's press
Were leaden heaviness
To my caress.
But then, unhappily,
I'm not thy bride

A Few And A Far
Desires Born And Die
In Solitude
And
With A Sighyou cannot swing on a hoolahoop
a broken neck whispered to a morale


Bounds at last and freedom cut
with choices done and wishes made
as if a million up-aboves are looking on, 
pushing me down, their fire saved, 
giving me the subtlety of charm and bond -
not the time to cast away 
a second, third, fourth, and fifth chance
at truly finding love at a second, third, 
fourth, and fifth sight.
But whom? 
The endless now are possibilities in scope; 
so confused in my choice of words, 
words of choice that could be worse -
strike out third and I'll rejoice

There they tried to fill a gap
A missing link between two roads
Those prevented the people to pass by
The missing link an obstacle they found
They decided to try for a solution
Someone's imagination for a suspension bridge
The others opted for a permanent one
At the end the decision for a permanent one
There they built a strong bridge
A good relation of neighbor hood came
The people were happy enough to proceed
The life itself felt them easy to lead. 

I have got a new story to write, 
A very interesting book of life, 
Every page of story will lift you up high, 
Compassion and conviction are his light.

He is a missionary man with kindred heart, 
And his dream is to connect with people lives, 
Regardless of whom you are and what you have, 
He is determined, because he believes.

He has been to long hours of road-trip, , , 
And the only thing he has is a baggage of hope, , , 
A mission where his heart leads him to a path of light, , , 
To build a home, where faith and love are shared.

He does not find reason to help others, 
Not afraid to fail because he has strength, 
The secret is happiness that springs in his heart, 
And kindness to rise by lifting others.. 

Never again. 
Never again do I want our souls to meet 
Never again do I want any interaction between us
Never again do I want us to be within the presence of each other
Never again do I want a memory of you
Never again do I want a thought of you
Never again do I want you to seek me
Never again do I want to seek you
Never again do I want to speak about you
Never again do I want to be present in your speech
Never again do I want your hand in mine
Never again do I want your heart beating in mine
Never again do I want your existence to coincide with mine
Never again. 

Always and forever, do I want us to remain strangers. . 

unto eternity
For you deserve no less, than complete separation
Oh how if I were to seek complete control
I would then start a complete new life, in which even traces of you would be an impossibility

Before we part unto eternity then, 
There remains one message I wish to pass on to you when, 
We bid farewell as mere men; 
Thanks for all the pain you ****ing *****ON thrones from China to Peru
All sorts of kings have sat
That men and women of all sorts
proclaimed both good and great;
And what's the odds if such as these
For reason of the State
Should keep their lovers waiting,
Keep their lovers waiting?
Some boast of beggar-kings and kings
Of rascals black and white
That rule because a strong right arm
Puts all men in a fright,
And drunk or sober live at ease
Where none gainsay their right,
And keep their lovers waiting,
Keep their lovers waiting.
The Muse is mute when public men
Applaud a modern throne:
Those cheers that can be bought or sold,
That office fools have run,
That waxen seal, that signature.
For things like these what decent man
Would keep his lover waiting,
Keep his lover waiting

On this moisty Under Milkwood morning
I walked buoyantly, 
briskly
through late summer bush.

Recent rain
had settled the dry
and grateful leaves
sighed, 
new-washed.

On the uphill side, 
the aged eucalypts
stood sombre
and wallaby grey -
untouched by last year's furnace.

On the downhill side, 
charcoal
hollowed ghosts
genuflected, 
leafless and barren, 
to their god, the sun.

While bold young saplings
black and supple thin, 
sprouted epicormic
new green
as if to say
I am
I am.

A chorus of air-born squeaky toys
broke the silence
and 
in the distance, 
dawn danced. 

Here is why Hillary has trouble attracting Millennials! 
This is the age group who rebels most from parental authority.
Specially Mom's! 
Seeing a mom and a grand ma running for president- 
Their reaction- Oh! No! Not Mom Again

Just a moment.
Yes, a moment in time, 
A moment in your day, 
A moment in your life.

To act, create
to grieve, to cry
to smile, to laugh.
to love, to hate.

Do not grasp, 
do not seize, 
do not hold, 
do not attach.

Its past, it’s gone 
it’s not alive 
its dead, it’s done.
So leave it now.


Bob Blackwell
February ome; rest here love.
Share with me a fleeting glimpse
of that silken splendor
as you linger for just a moment.
The flowers are willing to wait. 

The clouds had made a crimson crown
Above the mountains high.
The stormy sun was going down
In a stormy sky.

Why did you let your eyes so rest on me,
And hold your breath between?
In all the ages this can never be
As if it had not been.>When you wake up at O'clock Am, and take a look from your window 
You see an amazing sight, a beautiful light makes the sky glows

You feel a power comes when you inhale the breeze of the dancing flowers 
You hear the sound of the singing birds even if they are on a high tower.

you hear the angels whispering in your ears.
You begin to cry from touching the sky happiness.
Then you find a cute child wiping your tears.
you see a light of hope, with beuatiful colours, and cute faces.   

The sun hiding behind the rainbow
The sky snowing violently like a blow

A moment just when I wake and feel it, 
I wish I could back in time again to feel it. 

A Time to live, 
a time to die, 
life is like a vapor
so short and swift.

A blink of an eye
and it is over
a moment in time
you were ten years old.

A moment in time, you
were living so carefree
a moment in time
now your worn out.

From childhood
to adulthood, 
only a blink
of an eye.

A moment in time
thinking it would
last for all eternity, just a
vapor before your eyes.

A moment in time
as you look
at your life
of chances you had.

A moment in time
is now ending
as you lay on your
death bed and, 

you wonder where
life vanished to
as you close
your eyes in death. 

It was regrettably a moment
A moment of fun
Right under the sun
As I try to run
Captivated by fear
The harm is already done
I wonder which gender will be born
Where was that elastic
Known by its other name as condom? 

Sporadic thoughts storm my brain cells
I better prepare a futuristic story to tell
Will it be a boy or girl? 

An unwanted birth
On my cranky old bed set
Where bodies have mixed up
And churned up in anticipated sweat
I regret, I fret
I regret, I fret
Realising the damage
I rage, low on wage and engage
In remorseful thoughts
My thirst has been quenched and trenched

Was it worth it? Behold No! 
Did I need it? Behold Yes! 
The left overs are the fruit of my labour
The consequences are my only neighbour
At this time I need a saviour
How can I bring a child up all alone? 
What direction have the warm winds blown? 
In a moment of fun
I lost but he won
Now he is on the run


Truly speaking
believe it or not
but it is true

on h March, 
i had a dream
at about a. 

m.

i was gazing at the sky
i was seeing
two Angels folding their hand
came down from sky
landed on earth and stood 
before me.

i was surprised and
thought, it was a shape
or like me, to be confirmed
i touched one angel
with my fore finger

they both smiled and
flew away to the sky
crossing the clouds
they became vanished

i was gazing and thinking
was it a dream or true
a moment of Paradise. 

While lying in a summer field 
The sunlight warms my skin, 
Bright clouds play hide and seek around
Their hidden shapes within; 

Somewhere a bee is buzzing 'round, 
A meadow lark sings sweet -
The breeze blows distant tinkling
Of a wind chime down the street; 

Soft on a bed of daisies
I breathe their herbal essence
As they brush across my face; 

I slowly sip pink lemonade
Its tartness  quells my thirst, 
My mind is writing poetry -
With words precisely versed; 

So grand to be a country girl, 
I'm mother nature's child -
Within this splendid moment
So deliciously beguiled.


 ask for a moment's indulgence to sit by thy side. The works 
that I have in hand I will finish afterwards. 

Away from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite, 
and my work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil. 

Today the summer has come at my window with its sighs and murmurs; and 
the bees are plying their minstrelsy at the court of the flowering grove. 

Now it is time to sit quite, face to face with thee, and to sing 
dedication of life in this silent and overflowing leisure. 

A monarch on his death-bed lay -
Did censors waft perfume,
And soft lamps pour their silvery ray,
Thro' his proud chamber's gloom?
He lay upon a greensward bed,
Beneath a dark'ning sky -
A lone tree waving o'er his head,
A swift stream rolling by. 

Had he then fall'n as warriors fall,
Where spear strikes fire with spear?
Was there a banner for his pall,
A buckler for his bier?
Not so;"nor cloven shields nor helms
Had strewn the bloody sod,
Where he, the helpless lord of realms,

Were there not friends with words of cheer, 
And princely vassals nigh?
And priests, the crucifix to rear
Before the glazing eye?
A peasant girl that royal head
Upon her bosom laid,
And, shrinking not for woman's dread, 
The face of death survey'd. 

Alone she sat: -" from hill and wood
Red sank the mournful sun;
Fast gush'd the fount of noble blood, -
Treason its worst had done!
With her long hair she vainly press'
The wounds, to staunch their tide -
Unknown, on that meek humble breast, 
Imperial Albert died

A monk sips morning tea,
it's quiet,
    the chrysanthemum's flowering.
 



Being an atheist does not harm any one 
Even you dear non-believer; 
Only your insistence that
Every one must follow your belief

He is already an Emperor of the world
And though has democratic spirit
Is an Individual practicing Natural justice
And implements it without fear or favor

If we care He is experienced
when logic and reasoning set
And faith in Divinity sets in

Your insistence about
On your faith; you are not aware of it

On the other hand 
You criticize us for our
Faith in HIM﻿

The question is not

The reality is 
We are Divine


Sitting in the cold night, Watching the moonlight waiting for the change of the monster to shift its form, Burning and aching as the form begins to shape. As it stands in the open with eyes red as the sun, It howls to the moon and cries in the night.

Heat of the skin and fur drenched in blood, And rain, Quickly it moves to a person unaware, Making its move on the next prey it finds. A lonely man stands in the road eyes black as stone, Rain bounces of his dark rain coat. He is a easy target but is not alone.

He sees me and he begins to make a stand as my muscles begin to clench to let out a large roar, I feel the heat of my breath and make a move.

He moves so fast my eyes do not follow as I began to choke and throb as a bullet comes from the mans revolver. A extreme pain knocks me down cold. He was never alone as he has a gun faster than the wolf.

This vision comes from my own mind and I lay in my bed feeling the wolfs pain. My eyes turn red and claws extend I howl to the moon and cry to the night. Running down the road I see a man and will make my attempt to feed as he is alone, I will fight all my pain away when I take hold of this mans throat, But is he alone? I will not know. 

I didn't think much 
could happen
in so little time

Two of my cousins 
tried to commit 
suicide

One other cousin 
ran away for a 
day

Another ran away 
for two

My aunt 

My mother

My grandmother 

Have gone to the hospital 
thinking they were having 
heart attacks

My other aunt 
lost her job

My last aunt found out
that her husband was 
cheating one her

Yes her van broke 
down

One of my cousins 
that tied to commit 
suicide was her 
daughter

Family business 
was so sold

I lost my job

Mom left her 
codependant 
husband

Then she went back


Im now failing all 
my classes

I attempted suicide 
once

Mom walked in 
didn't even 
notice

She see the noose 
hanging behind me

Whatever was left 
inside of me died

I now know so much 
can happen in 
so little time


A monument for the Soldiers!
And what will ye build it of?
Can ye build it of marble, or brass, or bronze,
Outlasting the Soldiers' love?
Can ye glorify it with legends
As grand as their blood hath writ
From the inmost shrine of this land of thine
To the outermost verge of it?

And the answer came: We would build it
Out of our hopes made sure,
And out of our purest prayers and tears,
And out of our faith secure:
We would build it out of the great white truths
Their death hath sanctified,
And the sculptured forms of the men in arms,
And their faces ere they died.

And what heroic figures
Can the sculptor carve in stone?
Can the marble breast be made to bleed,
And the marble lips to moan?
Can the marble brow be fevered?
And the marble eyes be graved
To look their last, as the flag floats past,
On the country they have saved?

And the answer came: The figures
Shall all be fair and brave,
And, as befitting, as pure and white
As the stars above their grave!
The marble lips, and breast and brow
Whereon the laurel lies,
Bequeath us right to guard the flight
Of the old flag in the skies!

A monument for the Soldiers!
Built of a people's love,
And blazoned and decked and panoplied
With the hearts ye build it oft
And see that ye build it stately,
In pillar and niche and gate,
And high in pose as the souls of those
It would commemorate

A blight, a gloom, I know not what, has crept upon my gladness-- 
Some vague, remote ancestral touch of sorrow, or of madness; 
A fear that is not fear, a pain that has not pain's insistence; 
A sense of longing, or of loss, in some foregone exsistence; 
A subtle hurt that never pen has writ nor tongue has spoken-- 
Such hurt perchance as Nature feels wen a blossomed bough is broken. 

I go to the ridge in the forest
I haunted in days gone by,
But thou, O Memory, pourest
No magical dropp in mine eye,
Nor the gleam of the secret restorest
That hath faded from earth and sky:
A Presence autumnal and sober
Invests every rock and tree,
And the aureole of October
Lights the maples, but darkens me.

Pine in the distance,
Patient through sun or rain,
Meeting with graceful persistence,
With yielding but rooted resistance,
The northwind's wrench and strain,
No memory of past existence
Brings thee pain;
Right for the zenith heading,
Friendly with heat or cold,
Thine arms to the influence spreading
Of the heavens, just from of old,
Thou only aspirest the more,
Unregretful the old leaves shedding
That fringed thee with music before,
And deeper thy roots embedding
In the grace and the beauty of yore;
Thou sigh'st not, 'Alas, I am older,
The green of last summer is sear!'
But loftier, hopefuller, bolder,
Winnest broader horizons each year.

To me 'tis not cheer thou art singing:
There's a sound of the sea,
O mournful tree,
In thy boughs forever clinging,
And the far-off roar
Of waves on the shore
A shattered vessel flinging.

As thou musest still of the ocean
On which thou must float at last,
And seem'st to foreknow
The shipwreck's woe
And the sailor wrenched from the broken mast,
Do I, in this vague emotion,
This sadness that will not pass,
Though the air throb with wings,
And the field laughs and sings,
Do I forebode, alas!
The ship-building longer and wearier,
The voyage's struggle and strife,
And then the darker and drearier
Wreck of a broken life

After a long time 
I have taken my diary 
To compose some verses
By sitting on the couch 
In my balcony at full moon night.

My  thoughts seem to be paralysed
And my poetic mind like a physician
Tries to cure them in stead of writing verses.
The moon is walking but staring at me
And the romantic night is laughing at me silently.

It seems to be  impossible
To compose the lovely verses
In the romantic light.
The happy conversation between us
Will not go on tonight. 
My dreams are silent 
Not to play with the moonlight. 

FANCY, who leads the pastimes of the glad,
Full oft is pleased a wayward dart to throw;
Sending sad shadows after things not sad,
Peopling the harmless fields with signs of woe:
Beneath her sway, a simple forest cry
Becomes an echo of man's misery.
Blithe ravens croak of death; and when the owl
Tries his two voices for a favourite strain--
'Tu-whit--Tu-whoo!' the unsuspecting fowl
Forebodes mishap or seems but to complain; 
Fancy, intent to harass and annoy,
Can thus pervert the evidence of joy.

Through border wilds where naked Indians stray,
Myriads of notes attest her subtle skill;
A feathered task-master cries, 'WORK AWAY!'
And, in thy iteration, 'WHIP POOR WILL!'
Is heard the spirit of a toil-worn slave,
Lashed out of life, not quiet in the grave.

What wonder? at her bidding, ancient lays
Steeped in dire grief the voice of Philomel; 
And that fleet messenger of summer days,
The Swallow, twittered subject to like spell;
But ne'er could Fancy bend the buoyant Lark
To melancholy service--hark! O hark!

The daisy sleeps upon the dewy lawn,
Not lifting yet the head that evening bowed;
But 'He' is risen, a later star of dawn,
Glittering and twinkling near yon rosy cloud;
Bright gem instinct with music, vocal spark;
The happiest bird that sprang out of the Ark! 

Hail, blest above all kinds!--Supremely skilled
Restless with fixed to balance, high with low,
Thou leav'st the halcyon free her hopes to build
On such forbearance as the deep may show;
Perpetual flight, unchecked by earthly ties,
Leav'st to the wandering bird of paradise.

Faithful, though swift as lightning, the meek dove;
Yet more hath Nature reconciled in thee;
So constant with thy downward eye of love,
Yet, in aerial singleness, so free; 
So humble, yet so ready to rejoice
In power of wing and never-wearied voice.

To the last point of vision, and beyond,
Mount, daring warbler!--that love-prompted strain,
('Twixt thee and thine a never-failing bond)
Thrills not the less the bosom of the plain:
Yet might'st thou seem, proud privilege! to sing
All independent of the leafy spring.

How would it please old Ocean to partake,
With sailors longing for a breeze in vain, 
The harmony thy notes most gladly make
Where earth resembles most his own domain!
Urania's self might welcome with pleased ear
These matins mounting towards her native sphere.

Chanter by heaven attracted, whom no bars
To day-light known deter from that pursuit,
'Tis well that some sage instinct, when the stars
Come forth at evening, keeps Thee still and mute;
For not an eyelid could to sleep incline
Wert thou among them, singing as they shine

Made it to Cafe Trieste, nice walk 
through a downtown where everyone seemed to be 
'preparing a face for work', till I got here to North Beach-

only place in the world where Italy borders China. 
Had to run over to China to buy a pen, 
the storekeepers in Italy weren't up yet.

So I've been here an hour and a half, 
pleasant atmosphere, not too crowded, really a nice, 
Italian, or Italian/beatnik, feeling. Civility.

A guy came up to me, first asked if I need 
any problems solved, I said I couldn't think of any, 
then he asked if I might support the arts, 
and showed me several booklets of his poems. 

Rather than reply with, 'BUT I'M GOING TO WRITE 
A POEM MYSELF IN A MOMENT! ', 
I just asked his prices, and bought the $book 
rather than a $one. Turned out to be 
'duets', poems he wrote quickly with friends or passersby, 
not satisfying to read, so far. 

I asked him if he'd autograph the book. 
He brought it back to me a little later with his name 
and 'Solve any problem, $an hour! ' 'Genius idea, $'

'Hey, wait, I wanted an autograph, not an ad! '

But he seemed so crestfallen, about to fall over like a stout 
tower of Pisa. I patted him on the back. 
'It's ok, don't worry, you did autograph it, it's fine.'

That's what I like about this place. 

Two black and white choristers
visit us each morning, 
tuxedoed chests puffed, 
heads tilted to one side.

We broadcast mince
which they attack greedily, 
sharp beaks clicking, 
black feet scurrying.

When breakfast is over, 
they pose, side by side, 
(like Domingo and Pavarotti) 
stretch their black and white necks
and chortle magnificently. 

They sit at the table
with their crumbs and unwashed cups -
a companionable ease between them.

He is reading the paper, 
struggling sometimes to turn the pages
'Bloody broadsheet! '

She is watching him -
the shape of his head, 
the unconscious grace of his hands.

Occasionally he interrupts

She smiles, remembering
their passion of just an hour before. 

Another day, another sunrise
Kneeling at your feet
Saying my morning prayer
Leaving everything at your cross

I live under your power
Cover me with your precious blood
Surround me with your millions of angels

I need not fear
You promise to be with me
Wherever  i go

Your love has taught me to be strong
Your presence, my comfort
I pray, in your name.. 

Amen


I was given some hurry-up by some women on a power walk, 
having to sprint ahead of them to save face; gliding easily
down Golf Road that bisects the Titirangi Course I thought, 
'I never made much progress in that pedestrian game- too slow.
'All The Road Running', by Mark Knopfler was on my mind
when a man stopped his car to ask the way to the clubhouse; 
it was a pleasant pause on the run and so was the greeting
by an elderly man in a suit  walking, he said, 'to do shopping'.
Further on another man was intently watching a demolition site.
I noticed his suntan: 'He was probably a builder in another life'.
After that it was all uphill, passing a new retirement village, 
which I wanted to keep out of: I never slowed down to a walk.
I strode along a flat easy street to  the front door latch, 
breathless, but pleased when I glanced  at the stop watch.

    -  Revised November, 

I started first thing on a desktop computer, 
scanning the long list of emails there. 

Some I read and replied to; others I deleted, 
mostly advertisements that looked like intruders.

I gained in confidence to read, 'your message has been sent', 

Others in the cafe were playing video games, 
which seemed childish to me, even inane; 

although, in a way, it helped me write this sonnet, 
their noisy babble punctuating what was in it.

I went on typing and reading the internet, 
before relaxing with pop music on You-Tube.

I was happy with my tally of varied activities, 
but how could they be happy with more of the same? 

   -October, 

a mosquite buzzes
every time flowers
of honeysuckle fall


I know a most uncommon man
Who now must stand alone.
The way he chose to walk life's span, 
Our group would not condone.

Or plant a Judas kiss.
He did not crave a jewelled purse, 
But strove for inner bliss.

We never shook his hold on peace, 
With lures of worldly worth.
He measured man for dignities, 
Not by material girth.

His plan devoting time for thought, 
Denied our banal play; 
A broader, deeper life he sought, 
Along his thirsting way.

He was not anchored to his perch, 
By bonds of social stare.
He felt that one should ever search, 
Or sink in aimless care.

A non-conforming dreamer, he
Did shun our social code; 
With what we call absurdity, 
He walked the lonely road.

Now, as we struggle in our rut, 
I must say this to you-
If that man really was a nut, 
I'll take a peck, or two. 

Not to know the time
but to set it right
never been in the cycle before
still a game of chronology
helps to flourish the flight
always titillating without 
any inference of the period
referring the space
out of nowhere and
beginning to play in the circle
numbers have no meaning
even the arms deviate the direction
hereditary angst fills the moment
to postpone the end
and start a fresh lesson
in ticking and moving forward
not forcing backwards
beyond the limits of
one more dimension


In a palanquin of  illusions 
The winds passed me by
Dragging the veil of your fragrance
Singing songs unheard
My lady your mate announced your return

Like the undying wick of an eternal flame
Forever you dance
Who do those jeweled eyes search? 
O lady of my dreams.

In this silent moonlight shower
Cutting your oars deep in the silver river
Where do you sail? 
Away from the word or
My lady is it towards me? 

Adorning the crown of dews
Is it the beauty celebrating, 
The return of her favorite daughter! ! 

With an open heart, a silent prayer.
In these eyes blinded by you
My goddess, I seek to be your priest
With a nothing but a promise, of the moth
To a lit candleA Moth the hue of this
Haunts Candles in Brazil.
Nature's Experience would make
Our Reddest Second pale.

Nature is fond, I sometimes think,
Of Trinkets, as a Girl. 

How can a mother forget her child, 
the child who is conceived nine months in the womb
the child that is cradled at daytime, 
night time until dawn? 
How can a mother forget her child? 

How can a mother forget her child
the child who after the flow of months
has learned to stand and run? 
How can a mother forget her child, 
the child whose mouth imitates her mother`s tongue, 
the child who after a year or two can say, 
'Mama, I love you'? 

How can a mother forget her child, 
the child who is so dear in her own heart and mind, 
the child that reveals the mystery of creation, 
the beauty of growth and human interaction.
the infinity of our own universe
within its finite linear time

Screeching tires
Halting onlookers
Camaraderie
Is dubious
What’s beneath
Limbs were strewn apart
Flesh of a mother and a toddler

Government officials
Broke down to their knees
The beggar they’re chasing
Was gone in a split seconds
Surreal
Now they have deceased
A tragic ending
Was it a life’s lesson? 
Who could bear? 
To look at the scene
Paradigm? 
I swear
It’s not supposed to be seen

A toddler
In tact
In his mother’s cuddle
Albeit mother’s strewn
All over
A bundle


At  taking a stroll with my mother
On a cool summer night after dinner, 
Ma, one question always nags my mind
What is it she softly asked, my child? 

How can one spend a life time with one man? 
Doesn’t it get boring after a short span? 
As we sat on the bench, she looked at me
Yes, it needs commitment we don’t foresee.

In the first flush of love when you are getting acquainted
You love everything as you are smitten and infatuated.
But slowly it begins to sink that nobody is perfect
We have feet of clay, disillusioned you come to accept.

But as you come to know each other better, 
And are growing up and raising a family together.
You are overcome with love, respect and acceptance
And enjoy each other’s company even in silence.

Her words resound, although she is no more, 
As I wait for my man to come through the door.
I owe her my life and celebrate each and everyday
 To this day, she soothes and shows me the way. 

The nine months of unbearable displeasure, 
Are all of a sudden worth it when you see this treasure.
The feeling of holding her in your arms at last, 
The joyous emotion will never dare to pass.

You get to watch her grow, just as you did.
You would give your eternal soul for her, your life you would bid.
Trials and tribulations come with the joys of puberty.
A wider respect for your parent’s patience with you, soon to be.

You want to hug her and spank her, whenever she dares sass.
Quick witted, smart, and more than sometimes stubborn as an ass.
But she comes to you when she needs to cry on a shoulder, 
You want her to stay with you and never get any older.

Sometimes you lose your mind over the protesting, angsty screams.
Still the love in your heart makes it burst at the seams.
But soon enough she is out of the house and into school.
Sometimes you feel like your experiencing life’s crueler rule.

You have come to be disheveled when you go through life without her.
You don’t know what to do. But you are still her mother.
Remembering back on the old days, when life was a real mess, 
You will always love her, nonetheless.

This is the feeling of maternal love, 
Towards your precious gift, sent from up above. 

Theirs times that you’re not around.
Theirs times it seems like you don’t care. 
Theirs times I don’t see or speak to you.
Theirs times I question you.
Theirs times I don’t even care.
Theirs times I even wish I didn’t know you.
But what would I be without you? 
Would I be different or would I be the same? 
Have you changed my life? 
Or did I change it on my own? 
Was I different before? 
How come you want nothing to do with me? 
You leave me in the dust whenever you have the chance.
Doesn’t seem like you care.
If you do care you have a funny way of showing it.
We use to be like best friends.
I grew up and you kicked me off to the side.
Or did I kick you off? 
So many questions.
Not enough answers.
Not enough time to even ask all the questions.
My mind feels like it’s going to explode.
Not enough time in the day to even express my feelings.
Not enough time to share my thoughts.
It never seems to be the right time.
When is the right time? 
Is it today or tomorrow? 
When will you be there again for me? 
You went away so quick I didn’t have a chance to say goodbye.
I guess drinking really got a hold of you.
Some have the will power and others don’t know how to say no.
How could you let drinking get to you? 
When you have three kids.
Now two don’t even live with you.
Granted one of them is married.
But the other is still a young child.
Looks at you with disgrace.
You don’t even seem to notice.
While your family is breaking apart you just care about your glass filling up.
How do you live like that? 
I know you’re not happy, so what’s bothering you? 
You’ve been through a lot granted.
BUT SO HAVE I! ! 
Look what you’re doing to me.
What you think it doesn’t bother me? 
It does but I guess that’s what blindness will do to you.
When will you notice me? 
IM RIGHT HERE! ! 
Pick up the phone and call me sometimes.
Why do I always have to be the bigger person? 
I’m supposed to be the kid.
When was I able to be a kid? 
When will it be my time? 
I’m always there for everyone else.
How come you can’t be there for me? 
Your always trying to mess up what I accomplish.
Putting negative thoughts into my head constantly.
Do you want to see me fail? 
Well I'm going to tell you right now IM NOT GOING TO FAIL! ! 
How come you hate me so much? 
What did I do to you? 
I was always the one that listened to how bad your day was? 
I was the one who listened all the time
Who else was their for you? 
Dad was always at work.
Sam was never home.
I was I was their.
But you don’t think about that now do you.
Since I left you don’t seem to need me anymore.
Now you have toked my friend to live with you.
But threaten her she will have to leave when she make’s a mistake.
How true are you? 
You shad your tears about how much you miss me.
But do you really miss me? 
Telling people lies after lies.
Why do you do what you do? 
How come you act like that? 
Can’t you go back to being yourself? 
You’ve changed and I don’t like it.
To be honest not a lot of people like it.
But I guess whatever you want to do you will do.
But this is my time now.
Now you know how I feel.
So don’t ask me again. 

Is she not lovely!  Oh! when, long ago,
My own dead mother gazed upon my face,
As I stood blushing near in bridal snow,
I had not half her beauty and her grace.

Yet that fond mother praised, the world caressed,
And ONE adored me -- how shall HE who soon
Shall wear my gentle flower upon his breast,
Prize to its utmost worth the priceless boon?

Shall he not gird her, guard her, make her rich,
(Not as the world is rich, in outward show,)
With all the love and watchful kindness which
A wise and tender manhood may bestow?

Oh! I shall part from her with many tears,
My earthly treasure, pure and undefiled!
And not without a weight of anxious fears
For the new future of my darling child.

And yet -- for well I know that virgin heart --
No wifely duty will she leave undone;
Nor will her love neglect that woman's art
Which courts and keeps a love already won.

In no light girlish levity she goes
Unto the altar where they wait her now,
But with a thoughtful, prayerful heart that knows
The solemn purport of a marriage vow.

And she will keep, with all her soul's deep truth,
The lightest pledge which binds her love and life;
And she will be -- no less in age than youth
My noble child will be -- a noble wife.

And he, her lover! husband! what of him?
Yes, he will shield, I think, my bud from blight!
Yet griefs will come -- enough! my eyes are dim
With tears I must not shed -- at least, to-night.

Bless thee, my daughter! --  Oh! she is so fair! --
Heaven bend above thee with its starriest skies!
And make thee truly all thou dost appear
Unto a lover's and thy mother's eyes

You are my first thought of the day 
When eye lids open
I see you behind those lids
And send a prayer for your welfare.

Distances are crossed 
The day becomes blissful
When offsprings appear
In dream for added joy.


INSPIRED POEM AFTER READING POET CATRINA HEARTS
CAUSE AND EFFECT]

where did the beauty go
oh mother
in thy face
to the poet in me
it was a solace

what is this wrath you show
oh mother
in your face
to the tiny man in me
it was a scare 

mother nature
inspires
surprises.. 

and
scars me too

IS IT A MOTHER'S CHIDEAs I slept one night I saw this dream
Which further increased my vexation

I dreamt I was going somewhere on the way
Dark it was and impossible to find the way

Trembling all over with fear I was
Difficult to take even a step with fear was

With some courage as I forward moved
I saw some boys as lined in nice array

Dressed in emerald-like raiment they were
Carrying lighted lamps in their hands they were

They were going quietly behind each other
No one knew where they were to go

Involved in this thought was I
When in this troupe my son saw I

He was walking at the back, and was not walking fast
The lamp he had in his hand was not lighted

Recognizing him I said 'O My dear! 
Where have you come leaving me there? 

Restless due to separation I am
Weeping every day for ever I am

You did not care even a little for me
What loyalty you showed, you left me'! 

As the child saw the distress in me
He replied thus, turning around to me

'The separation from me makes you cry
Not least little good does this to me'

He remained quiet for a while after talking
Showing me the lamp then he started talking

'Do you understand what happened to this? 
Your tears have extinguished this'

I once created you with pure intentions, 

I then formed you with pristine motions.

 

With my very own flesh, &

With cells that were still so fresh, 

 

I incubated your growth, as

I nurtured what our fate wrote.

 

You soon left the infinite sea, 

Just to become born by me.

 

Laboring through the intense pain

Had brought me an immensely gratifying gain, 

 

Just as your very first sight

Had instantly strengthened my own inner might.

 

A part of me, yet

Apart from me.

 

You came into existence

As a symbol of persistence.

 

An angel from above, &

A personification of infinite love, 

 

You were more than I intended, 

You were more than I created.

 

Amazed, awestruck, and appreciative, 

I speechlessly admired nature's initiative.

 

In gratitude I still gaze at my life's greatest gift, as

In wonder I now realize the imminent transformational shift. 

Though I only had you for a month, that time though short, 
will remain in my heart, and mind for a lifetime. 
You were so young, sweet, adorable. 
You smiled, even up until the end. 
I held you in my arms as you took your last breath, 
tears rolling down my cheeks, and falling upon your tiny little body. 
If only I could have done more than just holding you, and stroking your cheek, 
and telling you we would meet again someday far into the future. 
Mortality, what a cruel gift which can be taken away in the blink of an eye. 

I had my heart truly broken today
By a man I call, "My Son."
I knew when I talked with him
He wasn’t poking fun. 

I asked him, "Why haven’t you called? " 
Or answered my emails? "
His answer was so hurtful 
Driving in deep the nails. 

"I was busy doing something else 
Didn’t have anytime for you. 
And as far as those emails you send me
I blocked them now from my view."

He drove those hurtful words in deep
Deep into my open loving mother’s heart. 
Did he know what damage he was inflicting? 
I think he knew it from the start. 

But why would he feel this need, " I wondered? "
What was buried in his heart not shared? 
Did I do something to hurt or anger him? 
Or is it that he really doesn’t care? 

And ask that He heal what is for me unseen. 
To sooth my sons hurt and sin of pride
And take away evils mean. 

And pierc'd my darling's heart;
And with him all the joys are fled
Life can to me impart.


By cruel hands the sapling drops,
In dust dishonour'd laid;
So fell the pride of all my hopes,
My age's future shade.


The mother-linnet in the brake
Bewails her ravish'd young;
So I, for my lost darling's sake,
Lament the live-day long.


Death, oft I've feared thy fatal blow.
Now, fond, I bare my breast;
O, do thou kindly lay me low
With him I love, at rest

A Mother's Love

Nowhere will i find a love like a mother's love
Who did her best,  to look her best
Whose love abounds, unconditional, endless
Outshines her beauty, because she is full of bounty
To the greatest joy of her life.. 

her children

She would not  trade for anything,  for any treasure
They are the best things that ever happened to her
If only she could give all her life
Be born again and again
She will choose to be a mother 
To the  children she loves and adores.

The palm of her hands
Brings a touching offering of a smile
Making her children feel special
And being there when they need  her

In sickness and in pain, 
in the midst of the storm
She creates  a song 
That echoes sweetly of peace and joy in their hearts
bringing a lullaby
rocking them into a deep slumber

How sweet it is to have a mother
Who paints a meaning and a goal in our lives
The sunshine is even more bright
With her by our side.. 

what can we ask for more


You are my child, 
given to me by some miracle
that I cannot comprehend
I was worthy of.
You've come and blessed my life.

You are my world.
Whatever I've known as my own
now shared willingly
and freely with you.
You've come and opened my heart.

You are my hope, 
in a world that's so unforgiving; 
in your eyes I see promise
of better things yet to come.
You've come and filled me with joy.

You are my happiness
personified, yet lit even brighter
and with unimaginable beauty
You've come and saved my soul.

You are my love, unconditional
whether it is given or received
and have given me complete 
and utter trust in your life.
You've come and given me ambition.

For all these things
You have given me, 
I have become a better soul
For this I do promise you
my love forever, 
and ever to become more like you. 

A Mother’s love is stronger
Then anything I know
Her true love and affection
Will forever show

No matter how old
You may grow to be
A Mother’s love
You will always see

You may do wrong
And makes mistakes
But her love for you
She’ll never forsake

Whenever you need
A helping hand
There’s no one stronger
Who’ll help you stand

She took you from birth
To an adult
All through those years
Love was all you've ever felt

Father’s are there 
But not all of the time
A Mother you'll learn
You can always find


A child passed away 
Mother inconsolable, sometimes taking in lap
Sometimes taking in arms
Moving left, right checking again and again
If he is breathing, is he sleeping? 
People around soothe, this is life and we are mortals, 
One will follow other and no one knows who will go first.
If you allow us we can put this pain to rest by returning the soul, 
He knew that they will fall in trap; mother will not allow them to escape.
Angel to mother, O bearer of pain, 
 we are here to relieve you by offering alternate plan, 
Just let us know one of your wish but remember other than this "Child’s life"
She said "No" I won’t compromise either give back my child 
Or else Leave me in pain till I am alive.
Angle said, O painful Mother, courage you please gather 
Ask for the one we can oblige but not this one..
She said, you know how much I loved this child and cared, 
I never allowed even air to touch my child without being fair.
She said OK then grant me a wish other than this, 
Allow me to stay with my child in the grave, 
 I shall not let any ant, termite or insect to touch the body
In darkness I shall preserve his body for ever. 

A seed has been planted in my heart by you.
It grows and grows, and continues to flourish.
It makes my soul feel like a garden.

A garden unlike any other.
A garden where flowers smell fresh and sweet.
A garden where grass is greener than the greenest leaf.

How long can you tend this garden my child? 
How long can you be mine? 
Shall I wait ‘til you grow up? 
Or should I draw a line? 

A line from now to prepare myself, 
For pain that’s coming up? 
When you grow up and show me then, 
That you can hold your cup? 

That you can read to yourself, 
That you can write your name? 
That you can ride your bicycle, 
Make up your own game? 

That you won’t need to tend this garden, 
For very long? 
That you will grow a garden of your own, 
That has its own song? 

But maybe, and here’s my wish, 
Perhaps I may be wrong, 
Maybe you will not forget, 
The magic of our song? 

It will be a strength to you, 
In times of trouble dear, 
And you’ll always value me, 
And know I am so near.

Know my prayers are with you, 
For now and ever, true, 
And I’ll take comfort in the fact, 
I did right by you.

There is a garden that awaits me, 
For this work I do, 
One that sets me free from pain.

Of loving you so much, 
And giving you what I can, 
Giving you my gentle touch.

So fear not, this love is pure, 
Dear son, in this you can be sure, 
I love you, don’t forget it. 

Written Mother’s day What thoughts that day-went through your mind? 
Sweet gentle lady; born one of a kind, 

 

What thoughts that day-went through your mind? 
Nurturer, teacher; devotedly humble; 

 

Unmercifully beaten, and heinously whipped, 
In His own blood, on the stone way He slipped; 
What thoughts that day-went through your mind? 
Man’s inhumanity to man; so cruel and so blind.

 

A sun-darkened day; a global earthquake, 
Hearts all atremble; from graves dead awake, 
What thoughts that day-Went through your mind? 

What motherly thoughts- Went through your mind

I remember, still remember
Though she's lately gone ahead; 
They still linger, always linger
Precious words my momma said.

Oft, she spoke of patience, virtue, 
Peace and joy gained by giving; 
She felt love, compassion, kindness
Paved the pathways of our living.

Her words were inspiration
When beset with storms and strife
And her poise and deep contentment, 
Became the guideline for my life.

She led me through the darkest 
To pursue a better day
And if those paths became too rough, 
She would simply kneel and pray.

I'll remember, long remember
Till I take my final bed; 
Words of beauty, words of wisdom, 
Words my dear, sweet momma said.

            heir invisible bond never ends
Life cord that ties child to mother
Love connects, as she attends
Unselfish tender care
Child grows maturing
The bond is there
Character
Growing
Strength. 

Living child or pictured cherub
Ne'er o'ermatched its baby grace;
And the mother, moving nearer,
Looked it calmly in the face;
Then with slight and quiet gesture,
And with lips that scarcely smiled,
Said—'A Portrait of my daughter
When she was a child.'

Easy thought was hers to fathom,
Nothing hard her glance to read,
For it seemed to say, 'No praises
For this little child I need:
If you see, I see far better,
And I will not feign to care
For a stranger's prompt assurance
That the face is fair.'

Softly clasped and half extended,
She her dimpled hands doth lay:
So they doubtless placed them, saying—
'Little one, you must not play.'
And while yet his work was growing,
This the painter's hand hath shown,
That the little heart was making
Pictures of its own.

Is it warm in that green valley,
Vale of childhood, where you dwell?
Is it calm in that green valley,
Round whose bournes such great hills
swell?
Are there giants in the valley—
Giants leaving footprints yet?
Are there angels in the valley?
Tell me—I forget.

Answer, answer, for the lilies,
Little one, o'ertop you much.
And the mealy gold within them
You can scarcely reach to touch;
O how far their aspect differs,
Looking up and looking down!
You look up in that green valley—
Valley of renown.

Are there voices in the valley,
Lying near the heavenly gate?
When it opens, do the harp-strings,
Touched within, reverberate?
When, like shooting-stars, the angels
To your couch at nightfall go,
Are their swift wings heard to rustle?
Tell me I for you know.

Yes, you know; and you are silent,
Not a word shall asking win;
Little mouth more sweet than rosebud.
Fast it locks the secret in.
Not a glimpse upon your present
You unfold to glad my view;
Ah, what secrets of your future
I could tell to you!

Sunny present! thus I read it,
By remembrance of my past:—
Its to-day and its to-morrow
Are as lifetimes vague and vast;
And each face in that green valley
Takes for you an aspect mild,
And each voice grows soft in saying—
'Kiss me, little child!'

As a boon the kiss is granted:
Baby mouth, your touch is sweet,
Takes the love without the trouble
From those lips that with it meet;
Gives the love, O pure! O tender!
Of the valley where it grows,
But the baby heart receiveth
MORE THAN IT BESTOWS.

Comes the future to the present—
'Ah!' she saith, 'too blithe of mood;
Why that smile which seems to whisper—
Sown for you in happier years,
I must tend it in my shadow,
Water it with tears.

'Ah, sweet present!   I must lead thee
By a daylight more subdued;
There must teach thee low to whisper—
Peace, thou future! clouds are coming,
Stooping from the mountain crest,
But that sunshine floods the valley;
Let her—let her rest.

Comes the future to the present—
'Child,' she saith, 'and wilt thou rest?
How long, child, before thy footsteps
Fret to reach yon cloudy crest?
Ah, the valley!—angels guard it,
But the heights are brave to see;
Looking down were long contentment:
Come up, child, to me.'

So she speaks, but do not heed her,
Little maid with wondrous eyes,
Not afraid, but clear and tender,
Blue, and filled with prophecies;
Thou for whom life's veil unlifted
Hangs, whom warmest valleys fold,
Lift the veil, the charm dissolveth—
Climb, but heights are cold.

There are buds that fold within them,
Closed and covered from our sight,
Many a richly-tinted petal,
Never looked on by the light:
Fain to see their shrouded faces,
Sun and dew are long at strife,
Till at length the sweet buds open—
Such a bud is life.

When the ruse of thine own being
Shall reveal its central fold,
Thou shalt look within and marvel,
Fearing what thine eyes behold;
What it shows and what it teaches
Are not things wherewith to part;
Thorny rose! that always costeth
Beatings at the heart.

Look in fear, for there is dimness,
Ills unshapen float anigh.
Look in awe: for this same nature
Look in love, for He doth love it,
And its tale is best of lore:
Still humanity grows dearer,
Being learned the more.

Learn, but not the less bethink thee
How that all can mingle tears;
But his joy can none discover, 
Save to them that are his peers;
And that they whose lips do utter
Language such as bards have sung—
Lo! their speech shall be to many
As an unknown tongue.

Learn, that if to thee the meaning
Of all other eyes be shown,
Fewer eyes can ever front thee
That are skilled to read thine own;
And that if thy love's deep current
Many another's far outflows,
Then thy heart must take for ever
LESS THAN IT BESTOWS. 

you. .! 
issue ofmine
borne with love, 
birthed with care; 
i look at you now
the naughty gleam in your eye, 
as your worrisome ministrations
wreck havoc with all order.

i look and marvel
at the miracle of your evolution..
from gurgles to mumbles
and thence to comprehensions; 
the actions with anger
tempered by the pouts 
which dissolve my resolution to be firm.

you, little bundle of joy and woe
all atwitter in a fit of
infantile anger..
i look at you, bewildered
marvelling, as a mother


inspired by my year half old daughter who has the strange power to drive me to tears and then be smiling thru them as she licks my face like a little loving poodle

May the roads you travel be trouble free, 
clear of pitfalls, obstacles, and debris.
May love fuel your engines, and your tank never run dry, 
so remember to show it often; or at least always try.
May kindness and compassion be the lubricant for any friction that comes along, 
let forgiveness and understanding help to keep your love strong.
May you hold on tight, as you round each corner, and pave new roads together, 
your love will steer you straight and true, through any kind of weather.
May you be mindful of the speed of life and the need for shifting gears, 
knowing when to take things slow, as you enjoy the coming years.
For time will take its toll on your soft and youthful skin, 
but always remember, beneath that leather, there’s a gentleness within.
May your love endure beyond the setting sun, as your future unfolds ahead, 
So say "I Love You" each time you saddle up, and each time you go to bed.
May happiness and prosperity always find you, wherever you choose to ride. 

A mountain was saying this to a squirrel
'Commit suicide if you have self-respect

You are insignificant, still so arrogant, how strange! 
You are neither wise, nor intelligent! not even shrewd! 

It is strange when the insignificant pose as important! 
When the stupid ones like you pose as intelligent! 

You are no match in comparison with my splendor
Even the earth is low compared with my splendor

The grandeur of mine does not fall to your lot
The poor animal cannot equal the great mountain! '

On hearing this the squirrel said, 'Hold your tongue! 
These are immature thoughts, expel them from your heart! 

I do not care if I am not large like you! 
You are not a pretty little thing like me


He has created you large in the world
And He has taught me climbing large trees

You are unable to walk a single step
Only large size! What other greatness have you? 

If you are large show me some of the skills I have
Show me how you break this beetle nut as I can

Nothing is useless in this world


Flashlights landmarks
Sunlight yellow
Snow white feet frozen
In purity of the dead silence

A bird will perch
From the pines
Nothing else will happen

A mountain climbing echo
Wing-like beats dug in the sky
Closing down
Blue cloud breath broken
Ends the day in a flake
So easy to die and melt

A bird will perch
From the pines
Nothing else will happen



OUR blue sierras shone serene, sublime,
When ghostly shapes came crowding up the air,
Shadowing the landscape with some vast despair;
And all was changed as in weird pantomime,
Transfigured into vague, fantastic form
By that tremendous carnival of storm.
Pilgrim processions of bowed trees that climb
To sacred summits, in the clashing hail
Shuddered like flagellants beneath the flail.
Most gracious hills, in that tempestuous time,
Went wild as angered bulls, with bellowing cry
And goring horns that strove to charge the sky.
Masses of rock, long gnawed by stealthy rime,
With sudden roar that made our bravest blanch,
Came volleying down in fatal avalanche.
All nature seemed convulsed in some fierce crime,
And then a rainbow, and behold! the sun
Went comforting the harebells one by one;
And all was still save for the vesper chime
From far, faint belfry bathed in creamy light,
And the soft footfalls of the coming night. 


ERE Beowulf's song
Was heard from the ships,
Ere Roland had set
The horn to his lips:

In Ogham strokes
A name was writ:
That name his name
Lives in yet.

The strokes on the edge
Of the stone might count
The acres he has
On this bare mount;

But he remembers
The pillar-stone,
And knows that he is
Of the seed of Eoin. 

The the earth  may be round
Or flat the trodden ground
Yet a life we live
Stumbling around
Edges and ridges
Of ravines and cliffs
A nice balancing act! 

We come across 
Ups and downs
Highs and lows
Ascents and descents
Pebbles and rocks 
Valleys and waterfalls
Peaks and summits
Inhospitable zeniths
Brooks and springs
That leaps and sprints
Cirques and crags
That daunt and brags
With vegetation and habitations
Existing and coexisting
While mountain ranges imposing
Greets us  all around

WHAT was the use of not leaving it there where it would hang what was the use if there was no chance of ever seeing it come there and show that it was handsome and right in the way it showed it. The lesson is to learn that it does show it, that it shows it and that nothing, that there is nothing, that there is no more to do about it and just so much more is there plenty of reason for making an exchange.

A Murmur in the Trees—to note—
Not loud enough—for Wind—
A Star—not far enough to seek—
Nor near enough—to find—

A long—long Yellow—on the Lawn—
A Hubbub—as of feet—
Not audible—as Ours—to Us—
But dapperer—More Sweet—

A Hurrying Home of little Men
To Houses unperceived—
All this—and more—if I should tell—
Would never be believed—

Of Robins in the Trundle bed
How many I espy
Whose Nightgowns could not hide the Wings—
Although I heard them try—

But then I promised ne'er to tell—
How could I break My Word?
So go your Way—and I'll go Mine—
No fear you'll miss the Road. 

She is more than a mist drifting across, 
More than something to seek sideways, aslant, 
In the corner of an eye. But why, then, does
She so easily vanish? Why does a glance
Direct lose her,  substance and shape? Why must
She, even stretched in pleasure, relaxed or taut, 
Merry with  the moment, (no, she is real, no dove
Fluttering from dreamtime, nothing planted
In the border of the vision-garden of 
My mind)   –why must she still evade? Does she taunt
Me with this fine ungraspability, frost
Me out when I am in? Does she refuse to grant
This last thing- to be there in more than body, 
More than spirit, more than ecstasy, heart
Or soul? He eyes gracious, affable, say not, 
Her happy satisfaction hides no dark
Counting, shuns any  need, to hold, to clasp, 
Even in affection. – even to know. Lost
In her oneness, without knowing, dancing
Her wholeness, she would not understand. Love? 
Yes. But what, as the moon slips graceful, slanting, 
Into clouds, does it mean for her? Something above
Or beneath my seeing. I wonder. Can this be enough

If death comes twice
Now it will do no harm
You lay there covered 
In a crib you can not change
It makes no difference that we who
Refuse to speak still tarry here
Waiting for the wind to blow.

You spoke to me last night
When I saw you writhing in your crimson blood
Massacred on our behalf
Still they speak as if they want you dead again
And I do not know
What gain death will cuddle
Struggling a shroud with the corpse

each moment in life
a music tik tack..

What and how
Can  I define
And give a meaning
When I look
To the soft sunshine
That illuminates
My inner and outer world
How can I  give a name 
when music is made
When sweet breeze
Caresses   the green branch
Or when
Flowers dance
In the rhythm
And  the birds chirp

In which note 
This music is  played
When in silence
It  is heard
From thousand miles apart.
In which name
I shall call the cloud
That wanders into the desert
Drizzles  for a traveller wearied.

What name shall I call the drizzle
That frees the music 
Held captive in the dungeon
And give a chance to play again
In  the freedom
Where sunshine, 
moon beam
Birds and butterflies
Even  the tiniest life dance. 

I blew air and the pipe piped
A tune full of   joy and delight, 
I blew the pipe for sometime on
The tune soon turned into a song. 

Had I left the pipe alone
It would never have gifted me a song, 
So let’s make good the opportunities of life
O my sweetie, come be my wife

What was he doing, the great god Pan,
     Down in the reeds by the river?
Spreading ruin and scattering ban,
Splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat,
And breaking the golden lilies afloat
     With the dragon-fly on the river.

He tore out a reed, the great god Pan,
     From the deep cool bed of the river:
The limpid water turbidly ran,
And the broken lilies a-dying lay,
And the dragon-fly had fled away,
     Ere he brought it out of the river.

High on the shore sat the great god Pan
     While turbidly flowed the river;
And hacked and hewed as a great god can,
With his hard bleak steel at the patient reed,
Till there was not a sign of the leaf indeed
     To prove it fresh from the river.

He cut it short, did the great god Pan,
     (How tall it stood in the river!)
Then drew the pith, like the heart of a man,
Steadily from the outside ring,
And notched the poor dry empty thing
     In holes, as he sat by the river.

'This is the way,' laughed the great god Pan
     (Laughed while he sat by the river),
'The only way, since gods began
To make sweet music, they could succeed.'
Then, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed,
     He blew in power by the river.

Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan!
     Piercing sweet by the river!
Blinding sweet, O great god Pan!
The sun on the hill forgot to die,
And the lilies revived, and the dragon-fly
     Came back to dream on the river.

Yet half a beast is the great god Pan,
     To laugh as he sits by the river,
Making a poet out of a man:
The true gods sigh for the cost and pain, --
For the reed which grows nevermore again
     As a reed with the reeds in the river. 

Between the visits to the shock ward
The doctors used to let you play
On the old upright Baldwin
Donated by a former patient
Who is said to be quite stable now. 

And all day long you played Chopin,
Badly and hauntingly, when you weren't
Screaming on the porch that looked
Like an enormous birdcage. Or sat
In your room and stared out at the sky.

You never looked at me at all.
I used to walk down to where the bus stopped
Over the hill where the eucalyptus trees
Moved in the fog, and stared down
At the lights coming on, in the white rooms.

And always, when I came back to my sister's
I used to get out the records you made
The year before all your terrible trouble,
The records the critics praised and nobody bought
That are almost worn out now.

Now, sometimes I wake in the night
And hear the sound of dead leaves
against the shutters. And then a distant
Music starts, a music out of an abyss,
And it is dawn before I sleep again. 

Thoughts come
rising 
without warning
traveling 
through rich scented earth
and wet grass 
inhaled, slowly 
way down to my feet
and out through
my deeply embedded toes 
that throw off
shimmers of dew 
that glisten on trees 
and alight the horizon


Come Dancing, I lose myself in those dancing heroines, 
Vin Diesel in the movie XXX stole the show encouraging 
the individual to make a difference, Wizards of Waverley 
Place had Alex experience romance in a magical journal

I have many brilliant stories also, never featuring me, there
is a myriad heroines - based on the stories I loved when I 
was a kid, books I like get assimilated into it - every noble 
thought integrated in a kaleidoscope that encompasses 
more than this universe, after this great Sunday night 

I am convinced whatever sacrifice or endurance tomorrow 
requires, I am safe in an inner bauble of wonderful dreams, 
need not send my own self anywhere as an infinite number 
of heroines can go all over the world to do the magnificent 
things suggested by myths, parables and legendsa crow, charcoal black, fierce eyes, blue 
saturn ring in neck, beak dense black 
sharp, arrived mysterious from nowhere 
sat on a tree branch bearing mangoes 
that protruded to front court yard of the 
house, and began to peck it furious! .

inside the house, parents, uncle, aunt and 
children sat around grandma, anxiety writ 
on face, for she lay speechless for days. 

a shattering sound brought all of them to
court yard, saw branch lay fallen, quickly 
did the crow fly away leaving the tree! . 

when returned home, on surprise wailing of 
mother, they found to great shock, grandma 
had flown away with the mysterious crow! . 
 
A mysterious naked man has been reported
on Cranston Avenue. The police are performing
the usual ceremonies with coloured lights and sirens.
Almost everyone is outdoors and strangers are conversing
  excitedly
as they do during disasters when their involvement is
  peripheral.
'What did he look like? ' the lieutenant is asking.
'I don't know, ' says the witness. 'He was naked.'
There is talk of dogs-this is no ordinary case
of indecent exposure, the man has been seen
a dozen times since the milkman spotted him and now
the sky is turning purple and voices
carry a long way and the children
have gone a little crazy as they often do at dusk
and cars are arriving
from other sections of the city.
And the mysterious naked man
is kneeling behind a garbage can or lying on his belly
in somebody's garden
or maybe even hiding in the branches of a tree, 
where the wind from the harbour
whips at his naked body, 
and by now he's probably done
whatever it was he wanted to do
and wishes he could go to sleep
or die
or take to the air like Superman. 

Sprightly and very much alive
For someone seventy-five
Wearing her trade mark sunglasses
To hide any trace of wrinkles
Are these accessories 
Armour to preserve
Her ever youthful image? 
Every gesture 
Is carefully choreographed
To leave behind an aura of mystery
No one knows her history
Some think she may have been 
A fashion designer or a 
Classical dancer of yesteryear
Which she neither confirms nor denies 
All this conjecture perhaps
Stems from her own wild imaginings
She drops little hints while talking
Leaving people to conclude
That after an illustrious past
She has settled down 
In the vicinity to a more 
Peaceful and relaxed existence
Yet no one dares question her
Fearing her sarcasm
With haiku-like concision
While fielding difficult questions
From curious neighbours
So she will continue to be an enigma
Until someone uncovers
Her true story –if there is one


Mysterious growth in my lines
Deep words drafting over and over
Had an impression of poetry
Have a will to do it.

Chapters carve a chapter
By order replacing new
My thoughts over love
Most profound pages
Imprinted  voyages and wave

I never knew that I will
Become one day
A poet of love in love
A poet of society for society.

Still am not a recognized one
Not as my best Eliot
But have faith in almighty
That, a day will come when
I and my mysterious lines
Will strike the heart of one and all. 

I lived my days apart, 
By the glory in my heart 
Covered and crowned and shod. 

And I must seek Him there, 
Where death outnumbers life, 
And fury smites the air. 

I walk the secret way 
With anger in my brain.
O music through my clay, 
When will you sound again

The picture speaks to me, 
Without spelling a hymn, 
Drilling my heart to be calm, 
Spreading my wings to imagine, 
Planting my feet on this platform, 
Subliming the spirit to be the crystal foam, 
Questioning the wayward wind on the roam, 
Arresting the nectar of the livings not to seek fun, 
This picture speaks to me, 
Without splitting the fossilized lips, 
Without blinking of the crescent eyes, 
Without shaking the neck of the stork, 
This picture gossips thousands of stories, 
Yet to be told, as I have stored the love in it, 
The picture speaks to me in soft words, 
I am in trance and don’t need any more swords. 

A FLOATING, a floating  
Across the sleeping sea,  
All night I heard a singing bird  
Upon the topmast tree.  
 
"Oh, came you from the isles of Greece 
Or from the banks of Seine;  
Or off some tree in forests free,  
Which fringe the western main?"  
 
"I came not off the old world  
Nor yet from off the new—
Which sing the whole night through."  
 
"Oh, sing and wake the dawning—  
Oh, whistle for the wind;  
The night is long, the current strong,
My boat it lags behind."  
 
"The current sweeps the old world,  
The current sweeps the new;  
The wind will blow, the dawn will glow,  
Ere thou hast sail’d them through."And satan said: 
‘Let there be a lie! ’
And there was a lie.
It hid in the stones
Sliding from above.

And satan said: 
‘Let there be hypocrisy! ’
And there was hypocrisy.
It hid in the words
Waiting to speak up.
It covered itself with cobwebs
Spiders to feed.
It hid itself from itself.

And satan said: 
‘Let there be poison! ’
And there was poison.
The devils waving their swords
Spilled it from a stormy breath.
It layered on the earth
To run with its currents.
It hid within the blood.

And satan said: 
‘Let there be hatred! ’
And there was hatred.
It spilled all around
Like blood that cannot clot.
It walked in tigers’ paws
And hid itself in the end
Under the cold mossy north.

And satan said: 
‘Let there be a human! ’
And there was a human.
He hid in the hypocrisy and lie
The poison of hatred fed him like milk.
A pirate wrapped in his sails.
And there was a human
In beasts he hid.

And satan said: 
‘Let him think I am not! ’
But it was not the way he said.
There was a lie in the beginning of his word.

Written in reconstructed in 

he built for her a duplicate of earth,
everything the same, down to the meadow,
but with a bed added.

Everything the same, including sunlight,
because it would be hard on a young girl
to go so quickly from bright light to utter darkness

Gradually, he thought, he'd introduce the night,
first as the shadows of fluttering leaves.
Then moon, then stars. Then no moon, no stars.
Let Persephone get used to it slowly.
In the end, he thought, she'd find it comforting.

A replica of earth
except there was love here.
Doesn't everyone want love?

He waited many years,
building a world, watching
Persephone in the meadow.
Persephone, a smeller, a taster.
If you have one appetite, he thought,
you have them all.

Doesn't everyone want to feel in the night
the beloved body, compass, polestar,
to hear the quiet breathing that says
I am alive, that means also
you are alive, because you hear me,
you are here with me. And when one turns,
the other turns—

That's what he felt, the lord of darkness,
looking at the world he had
constructed for Persephone. It never crossed his mind
that there'd be no more smelling here,
certainly no more eating.

Guilt? Terror? The fear of love?
These things he couldn't imagine;
no lover ever imagines them.

He dreams, he wonders what to call this place.
First he thinks: The New Hell. Then: The Garden.
In the end, he decides to name it
Persephone's Girlhood.

A soft light rising above the level meadow,
behind the bed. He takes her in his arms.
He wants to say I love you, nothing can hurt you

but he thinks
this is a lie, so he says in the end
you're dead, nothing can hurt you
which seems to him
a more promising beginning, more true. 

Shakespeare once wrote what is in a name, 
Was he I wonder thinking of everlasting fame? 
A man of words, beautiful to the ear, 
His, an eloquence for all to hear.
Even of commoners and bawdy scenes.
A man blessed with the gift and might of the pen, 
His stories are filled with deeds of daring men.
Tales of love, Intrigue and yes death.
Leave us gasping or holding our breath.
He wrote of the beauty of a single rose.
That smelled so sweet when held to the nose.
He wrote about the rich and the poor, 
None of his works was ever a bore.
So now I ask what is in a name, 
Certainly for Shakespeare it brought great fame. 

I am a rose and don't like my pose, 
Pictures of mine gross and cross, 
I want to change into another to admin: 
Single petal or multi petal jasmine, 
Mostly white in color, fit to be the cloud, 
Float in the sky during happy hours, 
Cry like a baby with unfulfilled desire, 
So I don't want to be the jasmine.
How is the orchid in the deep jungle? 
What a life with only one offspring, 
Must wait for that for many months, 
Though lots of color with exotic fragrance, 
Orchid is also not my choice to hide and disguise.
Sticky sunflower may wait for her Knight the Sun, 
Soaking Lotus may sob and smile floating for fun, 
Birds of paradise and flame of forest, 
Not fragrant hibiscus of various shades, 
Lilies are beautiful but have soft stems, 
All these are not my choice to hide and disguise, 
When in different shroud, would I bloom differently? 
When in different stage, would I be too wise? 
What cloak do I wear, my in born ignorance, 
And the acquired intelligence emerge, 
As the rainbow after the slight drizzle, 
should I choose a Name for me as a puzzle.


'A soldier of the Union mustered out,'
Is the inscription on an unknown grave
At Newport News, beside the salt-sea wave,
Nameless and dateless; sentinel or scout
Shot down in skirmish, or disastrous rout
Of battle, when the loud artillery drave
Its iron wedges through the ranks of brave
And doomed battalions, storming the redoubt.
Thou unknown hero sleeping by the sea
In thy forgotten grave! with secret shame
I feel my pulses beat, my forehead burn,
When I remember thou hast given for me
All that thou hadst, thy life, thy very name,
And I can give thee nothing in return. 

There are mixed trees
Almonds, mangoes and 
The flambouyant trees
Giving this arena its cool mien
But inside was a howl of cheers 
And regrets of arsenal, man u, chelsea
Fans crammed watching a match.

The food is good
Fragrance of African cuisines
Eba, amala, foo- foo, bitterleaf soup, ohaa, 
Cowleg, cowtail, nkwobi, esi iwu etc

Somewhere under the mango tree
There is a broken down peugeot car
That has seen rain and shine
Night and day
Moss grown with dilapidated uphostery
Here was a one man restaurant
And only the mad man ate here
From the crumbs sanity had left. 

When a nominee asserts
That he or she is not a politician
That's a big fat lie
That's their way of putting
The fat cat to sleep
You can use the synonyms
Of "crooked" as a prefix
In front of his or her name: 
Deceptive, corrupt, distorted, sneaky
Slimy, strange, oily, dishonest, shady
Dodgy, phony, bossy, twisted, freaky
Greedy and silly just like crooked chump.


A narrow fellow in the grass
Occasionally rides;
You may have met him,--did you not,
His notice sudden is.

The grass divides as with a comb,
A spotted shaft is seen;
And then it closes at your feet
And opens further on.

He likes a boggy acre,
A floor too cool for corn.
Yet when a child, and barefoot,
I more than once, at morn,

Have passed, I thought, a whip-lash
Unbraiding in the sun,--
When, stooping to secure it,
It wrinkled, and was gone.

Several of nature's people
I know, and they know me;
I feel for them a transport
Of cordiality;

But never met this fellow,
Attended or alone,
Without a tighter breathing,
And zero at the bone. 

A narrow girdle of rough stones and crags, 
A rude and natural causeway, interposed 
Between the water and a winding slope 
Of copse and thicket, leaves the eastern shore 
Of Grasmere safe in its own privacy: 
And there myself and two beloved Friends, 
One calm September morning, ere the mist 
Had altogether yielded to the sun, 
Sauntered on this retired and difficult way. 
----Ill suits the road with one in haste; but we 
Played with our time; and, as we strolled along, 
It was our occupation to observe 
Such objects as the waves had tossed ashore-- 
Feather, or leaf, or weed, or withered bough, 
Each on the other heaped, along the line 
Of the dry wreck. And, in our vacant mood, 
Not seldom did we stop to watch some tuft 
Of dandelion seed or thistle's beard, 
That skimmed the surface of the dead calm lake, 
Suddenly halting now--a lifeless stand! 
And starting off again with freak as sudden; 
In all its sportive wanderings, all the while, 
Making report of an invisible breeze 
That was its wings, its chariot, and its horse, 
Its playmate, rather say, its moving soul. 
--And often, trifling with a privilege 
Alike indulged to all, we paused, one now, 
And now the other, to point out, perchance 
To pluck, some flower or water-weed, too fair 
Either to be divided from the place 
On which it grew, or to be left alone 
To its own beauty. Many such there are, 
Fair ferns and flowers, and chiefly that tall fern, 
Plant lovelier, in its own retired abode 
On Grasmere's beach, than Naiad by the side 
Of Grecian brook, or Lady of the Mere, 
Sole-sitting by the shores of old romance. 
--So fared we that bright morning: from the fields 
Meanwhile, a noise was heard, the busy mirth 
Of reapers, men and women, boys and girls. 
Delighted much to listen to those sounds, 
And feeding thus our fancies, we advanced 
Along the indented shore; when suddenly, 
Through a thin veil of glittering haze was seen 
Before us, on a point of jutting land, 
The tall and upright figure of a Man 
Attired in peasant's garb, who stood alone, 
Angling beside the margin of the lake. 
'Improvident and reckless,' we exclaimed, 
'The Man must be, who thus can lose a day 
Of the mid harvest, when the labourer's hire 
Is ample, and some little might be stored 
Wherewith to cheer him in the winter time.' 
Thus talking of that Peasant, we approached 
Close to the spot where with his rod and line 
He stood alone; whereat he turned his head 
To greet us--and we saw a Mam worn down 
By sickness, gaunt and lean, with sunken cheeks 
And wasted limbs, his legs so long and lean 
That for my single self I looked at them, 
Forgetful of the body they sustained.-- 
Too weak to labour in the harvest field, 
The Man was using his best skill to gain 
A pittance from the dead unfeeling lake 
That knew not of his wants. I will not say 
What thoughts immediately were ours, nor how 
The happy idleness of that sweet morn, 
With all its lovely images, was changed 
To serious musing and to self-reproach. 
Nor did we fail to see within ourselves 
What need there is to be reserved in speech, 
And temper all our thoughts with charity. 
--Therefore, unwilling to forget that day, 
My Friend, Myself, and She who then received 
The same admonishment, have called the place 
By a memorial name, uncouth indeed 
As e'er by mariner was given to bay 
Or foreland, on a new-discovered coast; 

Powerful words, 
Truthful words, 
Honest words, 
Brave words; 
This is exactly what the Doctor orders, 
For a nation, who’s trying to fight the horrors
Of blatant racism, 
Unfairness, injustice, 
Nepotism and sexism.
A man of Peace, 
Without controversies, 
Is not a genuine activist.
The truth is being tolled; there is no reason to apologize, 
The sickness, the maladies, 
Which America has been suffering
For over five centuries, 
Need to be healed as you’re reading
My honest feelings.
This is painful, this is long overdue.
My brave People are tired of fighting
The ills and the stigmas of our societies.
This is hurtful, this is way overdue.
"Another One" is unafraid to tell the Truth, 
"This One" is dissecting the false myth, 
The prisons are populated by innumerable innocents, 
The Police and their cronies randomly humiliate
Our parents, siblings and cousins.
We have every reason to be mad and irate.
A more just and fair system needs to be in place now.
The Brother is using strong medicine right now: 
 Powerful words, 
Truthful words, 
Honest words, 
Brave words, 
To save America, 
The beautiful diva, 
Who stands for: "Justice, Freedom, 
Liberty and Happiness for All."
We should denounce Uncle Tom
And his monkeys. Brothers, who walk tall
Like you and our President, 
Are rare and almost nonexistent.
The Truth will always set free: 
The men of Justice, the men of integrity, 
The men of Peace, the men of honesty; 
The Brothers and Sisters who will tirelessly
Fight racism, the twin-brother of slavery. 

As history is made in the American elections
The world watches with disbelief and fascination.
Some one asked me, is it good for our nation? 
Rejoice, people are overcoming racial discrimination.

This is not the time to ask such parochial questions, 
It is about rising above caste, colour distinctions.
come on guys, why can’t you see it’s a giant leap of hope
And faith, so please join in the jubilation and don’t mope.

one man, despite lack of experience dared to dream, 
and the people who put faith in him, cry and beam.
An Afro American has defeated a seasoned white, 
I salute the democracy and the people for their foresight.

 Hey, will the name WHITE HOUSE under go change? 
So the new occupant doesn’t feel awkward and strange-Under the scorching sun
Under the chilly rain
Or the sleepless nights I see myself
Wearing a torment my country
Has sewn for me; 
I have traversed the length
And breath of my country, 
My hope clasped in my heart steams
And rises like vapour in the sun, 
The wit and wisdom my college 
Professors expounded resound 
An empty cymbal, 
Now mute and all topsy turvy I am.

I have borrowed the legs  of 
Knowledge to prowl on this land
The sand I am supposed to write
My history on
Grates the soles of my shoes; 
I am sitting under a Parkia tree
It is no longer a sweet song
Perhaps my reward is wrapped and kept
In a distance I am yet to attain
I am tired 
I do not know if my country or
I am to blame for my long unfruitful
 journey.

I am not alone
I can hear the drowsy song of birds
And far in the afternoon, lizards
Nod on the trunk of trees
To the song the birds sing 
Without melody, 
I am not afraid of them
I see tinkers barefooted with sheets
Of metals on their heads
I am not bothered, 
I am thinking of the college fairy
Tales about fresh graduates and
The present fact of the absent jobs.

I have left the earthen road
That which rose dust as we traversed
And painted our ankles earth red
This end which I do not know where 
It leads to and may not be tarred
I will leave it
To the asphaltic thoroughfare
Here where Ferraris and bugatis 
Wheeze pass
Where traffic blink their red, yellow
And green lights courting the porch 
Cars to zoom or take a breath
I am here under the scorching sun
Hungry, looking at my country Hungrier than I am
Those sun beaten lizards, 
Those birds which sing with a void
In their stomachs
Those roving tinkers
That humble applicant that I am
If my country could see us
We will all miss
Into its hollow stomach. 

WHAT woman hugs her infant there?
Another star has shot an ear.

What made the drapery glisten so?
Not a man but Delacroix.

What made the ceiling waterproof?
Landor's tarpaulin on the roof

What brushes fly and moth aside?
Irving and his plume of pride.

What hurries out the knaye and dolt?
Talma and his thunderbolt.

Why is the woman terror-struck?
Can there be mercy in that look?The Babe was laid in the Manger
Between the gentle kine --
All safe from cold and danger --
"But it was not so with mine,
(With mine! With mine!)
"Is it well with the child, is it well?"
The waiting mother prayed.
"For I know not how he fell,
And I know not where he is laid



A Star stood forth in Heaven;
The Watchers ran to see
The Sign of the Promise given --
"But there comes no sign to me.
(To me! To me!)
"My child died in the dark.
Is it well with the child, is it well?
There was none to tend him or mark,
And I know not how he fell



The Cross was raised on high;
The Mother grieved beside --
"But the Mother saw Him die
And took Him when He died.
(He died! He died!)
"Seemly and undefiled
His burial-place was made --
Is it well, is it well with the child?
For I know not where he is laid



On the dawning of Easter Day
Comes Mary Magdalene;
But the Stone was rolled away,
And the Body was not within --
(Within! Within!)
"Ah, who will answer my word?
The broken mother prayed.
And I know not where He is laid


. . . . .


"The Star stands forth in Heaven.
The watchers watch in vain
For Sign of the Promise given
Of peace on Earth again --
(Again! Again!)
"But I know for Whom he fell" --
The steadfast mother smiled,
"Is it well with the child -- is it well?
It is well -- it is well with the child!"i love the river between the banks
beshrew a drinker who doesn't give thanks

i love the breeze hitting  my face

i love the culver flying free
holding a branch of an olive tree

i love the sun of a shiny day
throwing on my flower a pure, yellow ray

i love the penguin standing on the ice
i love the cat chasing the the mice

i love the nature. 

it's beautiful and great

comA nearness to Tremendousness—
An Agony procures—
Affliction ranges Boundlessness—
Vicinity to Laws

Contentment's quiet Suburb—
Affliction cannot stay
In Acres—Its Location
Is Illocality—A comet came with a large metal core
Racing ‘cross the heavens toward the sun it tore
It started to shed its frozen surface
Of gasses, vapors, and minerals it bore

A collection of time from deep out in space
Now littered its trail with cosmic waste
But as its course closed in too near
It parted the flux of the Heliosphere

Leaped an enormous flare 
That swiped the hare
A giant shock wave
From the forces that be

Gravity, centrifugal, and a nuclear blast
Sent the fuel supplier again on the chase
Back out to the heavens on a new pace
Flinging it further out into space
On a much longer run which might be its last

Because she knows our daughter will probably forget Dad
. . 

unless she needs some money for gas
The card was hand made with a picture on the front
Of my wife and me sharing a huge hug at my office desk
She was sitting on my lap with her arms around my neck
Her luscious lips puckered to deliver a package of Love
A Kodak moment to be sure.  

but only one of many more
When I opened the card there before my tired eyes
Was a picture of my beautiful daughter at the tender age of ten
(seems like only yesterday she was twenty)    
And me sitting cross legged on the floor next to my precious
We were both loading up our tackle boxes
Mr. Wiffle fishing lures spread out all over the place
Her little laugh I can still recall.
Laughing and so happy to be going fishing were we
Picking out the various colors of lures we would need
To catch that moment in time. . 

only to be released all too soon
To suit any Dad who loves their child the way that I love mine
The hand written note inside the card
Told me of my wife's endless love for me
And what a great father and a wonderful husband I have been
All these many years
Because when you've been married as long as we have
There are no grounds for divorce.   

only Homicide


When a copper eyeballed me 
outside ‘Boots’ in Croydon 
at am, he 
was actually doing me a favour, 
‘cos it meant I was not down in Devon 
when his lordship’s place 
was being turned over; 
between the hours of m 
and m on that very day- 

but later that morning, when I saw 
that bloke getting something out of your eye 
in the doorway of W. 

H. 

Smiths, 
when you were supposed 
to be staying in washing your hair- 

I felt a need for further investigation. 

For instance, I open my doors
Give you reasons for why
Why I need you
No measure for stances
No measure for reasons
I be in your stances
Working with circumstances.

I halt  in dark, with
Pursuing the darkness of your light
You are a need as the space
The space between you and me.

I get cold in summer
In the absence of you for
Which I need you
I ask you for your living
The living in my living
Compare nothing, for instance
The birth of you
And death of mine. 

Possessed by a demon a negress
Wants to taste a girl-child saddened by new fruits
Unlawful ones too under the ragged dress,
This glutton’s ready to try a trick or two:

To her belly she mates two fortunate tits 
And, so high no hand will know how to seize her,
Thrusts the dark shock of her booted legs
Just like a tongue unskilled in pleasure.

Facing the timorous nakedness of the gazelle
That trembles, on her back like an elephant gone wild,
Waiting upside down she keenly admires herself,
Laughing with her bared teeth at the child:

And, between her legs where the victim’s couched,
Raising the black flesh underneath the mane,
Advances the palate of that alien mouth
Pale, rosy as a shell from the Spanish Main. 

She walks like me
She talks like me
She dresses like me
Apparently

But what a to do
For the lady who
Thinks we're two
Unfortunately

She lives by me
She smiles like me
She laughs like me
Apparently

I said, Why not try
To both saying 'Hi'
But she's quite shy
Unfortunately

So on we go
But at least I know
Why she says hello
Occasionally


O heighth! o Depthe! upon my bended knees
Who dare Expound these Wondrous Mysteries:
That this rare plant is cropt before mine Eyes
(Meer Shadow) left to write her Elegies.
Pray what brave Artist here can Understand
What one intends that takes a pen in hand?
Twas t'other day a place I visited
Where stands a palme, one limb where of is dead.
A bow'r which many years Thousands have shaded
By whome one Church was built: and Willard aided
Seeking the plat of Immortality
I saw no place secure but some must die
Treading that way their Ancient fathers did
Whose faces are, but Vertues can't be hid.
I saw this pretty Lamb, but t'other day,
With a small flock of Doves, Just in my Way.
What New made Creature's this so bright 'thought I
Ah! pitty tis such prettiness should die.
With rare alliances on Every side
Had old physitians liv'd She ne're had died.
Must then the Rulers of this Worlds Affairs
By Providence be brought to us in tears.
Such mournfull Sights are more becoming mee.
Pleasant Rebecka, heres to thee a Tear
Hugg my sweet Mary if you chance to see her
Had you giv'n warning ere you pleasd to Die,
You might have had a neater Elegy.[What the Man of Faith said]


The dew, the rain and moonlight 
All prove our Father's mind. 
The dew, the rain and moonlight 
Descend to bless mankind. 

Come, let us see that all men 
Have land to catch the rain, 
Have grass to snare the spheres of dew, 
And fields spread for the grain. 

Yea, we would give to each poor man 
Ripe wheat and poppies red, — 
A peaceful place at evening 
With the stars just overhead: 

A net to snare the moonlight, 
A sod spread to the sun, 
A place of toil by daytime, 
Of dreams when toil is done. 

I hold on to your promises
No matter what
In spite of, even though
I will still smile
Yes, to the whole world

I am always in awe of YOU
Just let me reach you
Stand tall, facing the sunrise
No matter what, in spite of


we experience a transformation in our beings as humans
and a new consciousness emerges 
that leads to a rare experience
in the depth of our being, 
which was not known before.

there came a new dawn
the bright light burned 
melting frozen hearts.

Come New Dawn. 
break forth a bright new day.
Oh sun come.  
part the long dark hair of night.

The time has come. 
The need for a new justice
Freedom from all these 
demi gods of money.

Sun burn away. 
Melt these gods 
and their ice palaces
Leave nothing behind




The dawn of a new age.
Coming of The Son of man.
a mystifying twilight at
December's door.
Put the alarm on snore.
Horses abound
not even a sound.
A silence
A stillness comes roaming
into the night.
The moon, a loon
a rustling into the woods.
A sign enters the sky.
as the birds begin to fly.
As the children begin 
to cry.
{continued }A New Day

Dawning of a new day-
Melting midnight fears away
Sleeping slumber eyes awake
Waking wishes to partake

Nightmare chills are gone
With the warm waking sun
Hoping the day joy partake
As these sleepy eyes awake

Awake till the dawn appears
Sunshine has its magic to share
Gone are the fears for tomorrow
Melting wishes have to borrow

February  still tongue keeps a wise head. 
A talkative fool tries to turn heads. 
A sailor thinks himself a rocket scientist.
everyone deceives me, everyone does their best, 
that's why I had been lost in a great mist, 
that pushed me away from east to west.
Now, I'm on the summit of a mountain, 
ready for getting rid of my lifelong pain.
for Him, and thank Him for guiding to the right way, 
that could save me from a deadly lightning ray, 
and guide me to a new life, that's really made my day. 
Where there is no pain, no hatress, no fake, no lie, 
no one can hurt me again, till the day I die.

The used Idioms and Idiomatic expressions! 
A still tongue keeps a wise head = Wise people don't talk much. 
Tries to tern heads = Tries to be noticed by everyone all the time.
Rocket scientist = The most intelligent person.
Lifelong = Eternal
Made my day = Made me happy

A new lust
seeded yester night
during sleep
by hands unseen
in the fertile soil
lying within deep
all afresh
as I woke up
saplings of love
mushroomed in my breasts
softly I caressed
the lovely little things
dreams have come true
yes, poppy plants they are
intoxicating me
with luxuriant vapour


Love is a rebellious raven
That nobody can tame
Nothing helps, neither threat nor prayer
One man talks well to someone else dreams

    Love! Love! Love! Love! 
    Love is a gypsy's child
    It has never, ever, known a law
    Love me not, then I love you

All around you, swift, so swift
It comes, it goes, and then returns
The bird you thought you had caught
Suddenly beat its wings and flew away 

    You think you hold it fast, it flees
    You think you're free, it holds you fast
    Love stays away, you wait and wait
    When least expected, there it is! 

Over the far horizon on the ocean
And then the wooden boat appears
And then the flying seagulls are white
It enters into the port, it rumbles its salute

    And I wait a long time, sweetheart
    And leaving from the crowded nuance
     I stay upon the edge of the morning shore
     I will call velvet firefly from the distance

One good day, we will see
Arising a strand of orange smoke
I without answering, stay hidden
A little to tease this mysterious love

    You are the splendor of my life
    For you I have fought
    For you I have challenge

To place a royal garland on your hair
To raise you a throne next to the sun
I want to give you back your beautiful sky
The sweet breezes of your sparkle garden

    Sweet name, you who made my sensitive heart
    Throb for the first time, you must always remind me
    Hold back your fears, O bittersweet Love! 
    I with secure faith wait for you, O the pleasures of love! 

And to you, my sweet love! 
To return crowned with laurels
If only my dream might come true
O Exotic garland of light and flowers! 

   And my last breath
   Will be yours, my beloved
   My desire will fly to you
   On the wings of the angels

nothing to live for.
a time bomb ready to explode inside me.
my nerves shot.
dignity set free.

deadly tears drops dripping off my face.
head pounding, heart rushing, life burning, fading away

tired of this feeling.
insides trembleing with hate
dripping with dears that tell a story as they pour down my face.

let down.
put down.
shut down.
if at once healing im re-breaking, shattering, falling apart.
seperating from the world & into a darker place.
this twisted world makes life sickening.
ready for a change.
ready for a life.

waitning for the day when nobody dies, complete happiness, peace.
psh, who am i kidding that'll never come true.
but maybe one day someone will be willing to take this risk.
colliding into my own disregaurds
running into my own unreached dreams&goals.

a failure.
a waste.
a useless thing.
and yet im still sucked into the darkness.
when will it spit me back out? 

Upon the grave of the old 
A new flower blooms.
Sadly it never knew the 
Loving nurturing hands of a Gardner.

The Gardner sleeping in the grave 
Left the plant alone.
Yet it blooms to add its beauty to the old grave.

The rising sun gave it warmth, 
The rain nourished the plant, 
And the protective wind kept it in her watch.

Fighting against all odds of life
With her nature given might
The  tiny flower blooms 
Upon the grave of the old.

Now it wishes to be plucked 
To be part of a bouquet.
Let someone make it part of a lovely arrangement.
Or is it his fate to wither alone? 
To be perished upon the grave of the old! 

h she tripped over Ocknell plain,
And down by Bradley Water;
And the fairest maid on the forest side
Was Jane, the keeper's daughter.

She went and went through the broad gray lawns
As down the red sun sank,
And chill as the scent of a new-made grave
The mist smelt cold and dank.

'A token, a token!' that fair maid cried,
'A token that bodes me sorrow;
For they that smell the grave by night
Will see the corpse to-morrow.

'My own true love in Burley Walk
Does hunt to-night, I fear;
And if he meet my father stern,
His game may cost him dear.

'Ah, here's a curse on hare and grouse,
A curse on hart and hind;
And a health to the squire in all England,
Leaves never a head behind.'

Her true love shot a mighty hart
Among the standing rye,
When on him leapt that keeper old
From the fern where he did lie.

The forest laws were sharp and stern,
The forest blood was keen;
They lashed together for life and death
Beneath the hollies green.

The metal good and the walnut wood
Did soon in flinders flee;
They tost the orts to south and north,
And grappled knee to knee.

They wrestled up, they wrestled down,
They wrestled still and sore;
Beneath their feet the myrtle sweet
Was stamped to mud and gore.

Ah, cold pale moon, thou cruel pale moon,
That starest with never a frown
On all the grim and the ghastly things
That are wrought in thorpe and town:

And yet, cold pale moon, thou cruel pale moon,
That night hadst never the grace
To see one another's face.

They wrestled up, they wrestled down,
They wrestled sore and still,
The fiend who blinds the eyes of men
That night he had his will.

Like stags full spent, among the bent
They dropped a while to rest;
When the young man drove his saying knife
Deep in the old man's breast.

The old man drove his gunstock down
Upon the young man's head;
And side by side, by the water brown,
Those yeomen twain lay dead.

They dug three graves in Lyndhurst yard;
They dug them side by side;
Two yeomen lie there, and a maiden fair
A widow and never a bride.


In the New Forest,  

Shot in a night of impeccable injustice.
Overflowed with torment and forgiveness.
Placed directed towards my head and waiting.
Pushing through the morbid crowd.
Bright and radiant and shining through, 
To talk and save me and open up new doors.
Oh what new things I can learn and love, through this, 
This new friendship. 

Pulling a new friend into 
your life is a form of balance.
Its a ripple in the system
that is so beautiful. 
a new spirit.  a new energy.
Both are souls combined. 
When two people compliment 
each other, it is a valuable commodity. 
to the flow of the world. A chain 
of events that bring a happiness 
to more than just the new friends. 

i meet a new friend today
he lives far away
he gives me helpful hints
like maybe writing about tents
i cant give you his name
cause that would be breaking the rules of the game
hes helped me alot
and i appriated dearly
he is my inspiration
thank you for all your help


THERE’S a fresh track down the paddock
Through the lightwoods to the creek,
And I notice Billy Craddock
And Maloney do not speak,
And The Snag is slyly bitter
When he’s criticising Bill,
And there’s quite a foreign glitter
On the fellows at the mill.

Sid M‘Mahon’s turned out a dandy
With a masher coat and tie,
And the engine-driver, Sandy,
Curls his whiskers on the sly:
All the boys wear paper collars
And their tombstone shirts of nights,
So it’s ten to one in dollars
There’s a new girl up at White’s.

She’s a charmer from the river,
But she steeps the lads in gloom,
With her blue eyes all a-quiver
And her hair like wattle-bloom;
Though she’s pretty and beguiling,
And so lit up, like, with fun
That the flowers turn to her smiling,
Just as if she was the sun.

But I wish she’d leave the valley,
For the camp is dull to me,
Now the mill hands never rally
For the regulation spree,
And there’s not another joker
Gives a tinker’s curse for nap.,
Or will take a hand at poker
Or at euchre with a chap!

Tom won’t stir us with his fiddle
By the boilers as he did
While Bob stepped it in the middle,
And we passed the billy-lid.
Ah! we had some gay old nights there,
But the boys now don’t agree,
And they hang about at White’s there,
When they’ve togged up after tea.

With the gloves we have no battle;
Now they sneak away and moon
Round with White, discussing cattle
All the Sunday afternoon.
There’s a want of old uprightness,
Too, has come upon the push,
And a sort of cold politeness
That’s not called for in the bush.

They’re all off, too, in that quarter;
Kate goes sev’ral times a week
Seeing Andy Kelly’s daughter,
Jimmy’s sister, up the creek;
And this difference seems a pity,
Since their chances are so slim—
While they are running after Kitty,
She is running after Jim. 

NEW words will be discovered
To describe the horror, 
Pain and strife

NEW cousins of Calamity, 
Catastrophe, Disaster and Death

NEW laws will be made
To counter the loss of life

A NEW currency of tears
AN economy of fears

OLD nature's patterns will be the NEW
Curse of mankind

OLD prayers will be sung on highways, 
Byways, in anyway the storms provide

ALL will need insurance
Against natural homicide, 
Genocide, Infanticide! 

Natural causes, or a Natural Curse

Congratulations! 


You have now invited in another guest. 
Look after it well.

Insofar, make it be your best. 
That to all you will have this to tell. 


 

It is your new baby. 
It is your new life. 

Just like how you’re a beautiful lady, and 
Just like how you’re a beautiful wife, 


 
I’m sure that this too,  
Will beckon you with boundless beauty. 

Let nothing else fit its shoe, and 
Let it fill you with utmost creativity. 


 

In its presence do get immersed, and
In its presence, be sure to mentally prosper.

Your practise has now been well rehearsed, and 
Its about time you donate your past to a foster. 



 

Again, I’d like to congratulate you, 
As we celebrate a brand new year just for you. 

Seeing we never found gay fairyland
(Though still we crouched by bluebells moon by moon)
And missed the tide of Lethe; yet are soon
For that new bridge that leaves old Styx half-spanned;
Nor ever unto Mecca caravanned;
Nor bugled Asgard, skilled in magic rune;
Nor yearned for far Nirvana, the sweet swoon,
And from high Paradise are cursed and banned;

-Let's die home, ferry across the Channel! Thus
Shall we live gods there. Death shall be no sev'rance.
Weary cathedrals light new shrines for us.
To us, rough knees of boys shall ache with rev'rence.
Are not girls' breasts a clear, strong Acropole?
-There our oun mothers' tears shall heal us whole. 

Once upon a time, three years ago, 
He was a nerd, sleeping with books, 
Dancing with ideas to write the thesis, 
Pumping in the lab to talk with his specimens, 
Dreaming of changing the world in a second, 
Once he graduated in the gown and the scroll
Thinking of his stingy parents as old timers, 
Assuming the society very backward and stone aged, 

Windows of the world seemed to be locked, 
Always felt the heat in the fuming acidic mind, 
Readymade food was desirous and delicious.
I saw him, carrying his young son on the chest, 
Still wearing the age old university trousers, 
Bought using the money sent by the parents, 
It was the eye hospital, where two years old has no task, 
When the eye sight of the son is an issue, 
I observed the true father erupts from the nerd.

Hugging the son tightly; precious than his degree, 
The words are softened; even the voice is ironed, 
The uniformity in the waves of behavior; wrapping, 
His young son with the smooth cotton candy of hands, 
made him to wear branded pants, shirts, shoes and cap, 
The son was crying in pain, while the father sheds the tears, 
Using the kindest words to console his young son, 
When the nurse tried to put the drops, the father's face was sad, 
We haven't lost our culture of being humane and responsible, 
That young father has proved that we are on the right track. 

Sing a song of men's pyjamas,
Half-past-six has got a pair,
And he's wearing them this evening,
And he's looking such a dear.

Sing a song of frocks with pockets
I have got one, it is so's
I can use my `nitial hankies
Every time I blow my nose. 

A tall, slight, English gentleman,
With an eyeglass to his eye;
He mostly says "Good-Bai" to you,
When he means to say "Good-bye";
He shakes hands like a ladies’ man,
For all the world to see—
But they know, in Corners of the World.
No ladies’ man is he. 
A tall, slight English gentleman,
Who hates to soil his hands;
He takes his mother’s drawing-room
To the most outlandish lands;
And when, through Hells we dream not of,
His battery prevails,
He cleans the grime of gunpowder
And blue blood from his nails. 

He’s what our blokes in Egypt call
"A decent kinder cove."
And if the Pyramids should fall?
He’d merely say "Bai Jove!"
And if the stones should block his path
For a twelve-month, or a day,
He’d call on Sergeant Whatsisname
To clear those things away! 

A quiet English gentleman,
Who dots the Empire’s rim,
Where sweating sons of ebony
Would go to Hell for him.
And if he chances to get "winged,"
Or smashed up rather worse,
He’s quite apologetic to
The doctor and the nurse. 

A silent English gentleman—
Though sometimes he says "Haw."
But if a baboon in its cage
Appealed to British Law
And Justice, to be understood,
He’d listen all polite,
And do his very best to set
The monkey grievance right. 

A thoroughbred whose ancestry
Goes back to ages dim;
Yet no one on his wide estates
Need fear to speak to him.
Although he never showed a sign
Of aught save sympathy,
He was the only gentleman
That shamed the cad in me. 

One page will turn
In calendar
And a new life will begin
With the new leaf
A new chapter will unleash
A new story will begin
Of days
Each day will bring 
New experience 
New challenge
Fate will write its own story
And we shall try to 
Fight our ways 
Let this tug of war begin
Let this new fight start
We shall wait till end 
To see the result at last. 

A new light
you can see it
and you think
wow
it's so bright
almost there
the healing begins
a new journey
continues
and a new you
is born(It is supposed that Shadow-of-a-Leaf uses the word 'clear' in a
more ancient sense of 'beautiful.')


As along a dark pine-bough, in slender white mystery
The moon lay to listen, above the thick fern,
In a deep dreaming wood that is older than history
I heard a lad sing, and I stilled me to learn;
So rarely he lilted his long-forgot litany,--
_Fall, April; fall, April, in dew on our dearth!
Bring balm, and bring poppy, bring deep sleepy dittany
For Marian, our clear May, so long laid in earth._

Then I drew back the branches. I saw him that chanted it.
I saw his fool's bauble. I knew his old grief.
I knew that old greenwood and the shadow that haunted it,--
My fool, my lost jester, my _Shadow-of-a-Leaf_!
And 'why,' I said, 'why, all this while, have you left me so
Luckless in melody, lonely in mirth?'
'Oh, why,' he sang, 'why has this world then bereft me so
Soon of my Marian, so long laid in earth?

'In the years that are gone,' he said, 'love was more fortunate.
Grief was our minstrel of things that endure.
Now, ashes and dust and this world grow importunate.
Time has no sorrow that time cannot cure.
Once, we could lose, and the loss was worth cherishing.
Now, we may win, but, O, where is the worth?
Memory and true love,' he whispered, 'are perishing,
With Marian, our clear May, so long laid in earth.'

'Ah, no!' I said, 'no! Since we grieve for our grief again,
Touch the old strings! Let us try the old stave!
And memory may wake, like my _Shadow-of-a-Leaf_ again,
Singing of hope, in the dark, by a grave.'
So we sang it together--that long-forgot litany:--
_Fall, April; fall, April; bring new grief to birth.
Bring wild herb of grace, and bring deep healing dittany,
For Marian, our clear May, so long laid in earth._A drive by bullet 
Gently grazes your head
You go into a sudden death spiral
Your soul leaves 
Your body reluctantly
The next thing you know 
The cell phone is ringing
And the Pope has just
Canonized your Mother
So you are not the bastard after all-

On a shining waves
Gently floating on 
Its charming risings

     Under a thick dome of The Avatar
     Where white roses entwined together
     One hand reaches where spring sleeps
     My kiss dissolve silence that makes you mine! 

I gave my song to the moon, to the sun
Always with true faith in hour of holy
Even you, O Princess, watch the stars 
That tremble with love and with hope

     Ah, the marriage hymn plays! 
     The ceremony for us draws near! 
     Happiness! Give me your right hand! 
     The sacred torches, shining brilliantly all around! 

The sweet sound, hugs me, heavenly voice! 
Oh, joy that one feels and does not speak of! 
Oh, wondrous day! At last, I am yours, you are mine

     From peaceful heaven a smile
     The life to us will be gorgeous
     Every pleasure is more grateful
     To me, with you, more thankful

I never did harm to a living soul! 
Nobody shall sleep! 
I lived for my art! 
I lived for love! 

    On the river bank 
    Covered with flowers 
    Smiling in the morning
    Let us descend together! 

Pave with swift victory
The steps of Liberty,
Whom Britons own to be

II.
See, she comes throned on high,
On swift Eternity!
Millions on millions wait,
Firm, rapid, and elate,
On her majestic state!

III.
She is Thine own pure soul
Moulding the mighty whole,--
She is Thine own deep love
Rained down from Heaven above,--
Wherever she rest or move,

IV.
‘Wilder her enemies
In their own dark disguise,--
All earthly things that dare
Her sacred name to bear,
Strip them, as kings are, bare;

V.
Be her eternal throne
Built in our hearts alone--
Let the oppressor hold
Canopied seats of gold;
She sits enthroned of old

VI.
Lips touched by seraphim
Breathe out the choral hymn
Sweet as if angels sang,
Loud as that trumpet’s clang 
Wakening the world’s dead gang,--

Care killed a cat, and I have cares at home,
Which vex me nightly and disturb my bed.
The things I love have all grown wearisome;
The things that loved me are estranged or dead.
I have a house most fair, but tenanted
With shadows only, gardens of tall trees,
Fenced in and made secure from every dread
But this one terror, my soul's lack of ease.
I have much wealth of pleasure, horse and hound,
Woods broad for sport, and fields that are my own,
With neighbours of good cheer to greet me round,
And servants tried by whom my will is done.
Here all things live at peace in this dear place,
All but my pride, which goes companionless. 

Finding a new poet
is like finding a new wildflower
out in the woods. You don't see

its name in the flower books, and
nobody you tell believes
in its odd color or the way

its leaves grow in splayed rows
down the whole length of the page. In fact
the very page smells of spilled

red wine and the mustiness of the sea
on a foggy day - the odor of truth
and of lying.

And the words are so familiar,
so strangely new, words
you almost wrote yourself, if only

in your dreams there had been a pencil
or a pen or even a paintbrush,
if only there had been a flower. 

Die Tugend des Herrschers 
ist wie der Wind
die Tugend des Volkes 
wie das Gras

Then I relish a simply yearning
Which escapes from your eyes
And which is able to look into
Your most mystical beauties

Thus scent of desire is all around us
And it makes us happy, makes us happy! 
And you who know, who remember and yearn? 
I know so well that you eagerly do want to express it

Unter der Kraft
des Windes
beugt sich
das Gras

To music of trumpets and horns
Of bombards, of cannons
Which, at every boom
Will make bullets whistle 

A lot of honor, in place of dance
A march through the mud and thorn
Archer on your back, sword at your side
Your neck straight, your eyes sharpened

Strebt der Herrscher
aufrichtig nach Gutem
wird auch das Volk
gut sein

A talkative Narcissus and a shy Adonis of love
You won't go any more, O amorous lullaby! 
Fluttering around inside night and day
Disturbing a sleep of inner circles

Over mountains, through valleys
With snow, sea, heat-stroke
Among lovers, by Bacchus! 
My hero, go to victory! 

to quarrel, become violent, and make a scene.
The lover is even worse than a drunkard.
I will tell you what love is: to enter a mine of gold.
And what is that gold?
The lover is a king above all kings,
unafraid of death, not at all interested in a golden crown.
The dervish has a pearl concealed under his patched cloak.
Why should he go begging door to door?
Last night that moon came along,
drunk, dropping clothes in the street.
"Get up," I told my heart, "Give the soul a glass of wine.
The moment has come to join the nightingale in the garden,
to taste sugar with the soul-parrot

"
I have fallen, with my heart shattered -
where else but on your path? And I
broke your bowl, drunk, my idol, so drunk,
don't let me be harmed, take my hand.
A new rule a new law has been born:
break all the glasses and fall toward the glassblower. 

lately many symbols seem to melt, wilt and decline
is it something in our food, 
something in the air that dulls, a hovering cloud, 
energy from the past, loss of faith, forsaken hope

and a dozen other reasons
is it love and empathy shed
a ballooon deflated
have apathy and satire taken over the libido

emotions ruled by logic
blinded the eyes of memory
other forces have replaced symbols
telling us what and how to do

in ball parks and stadiums packed
festivals, mass gatherings thrive, jive
sing and dance a new tune
symbols of the past put to rest

new ones appear like mushrooms in the rain


Broken we fall, 
Broken and we bleed, 
Broken hearted we always leave, 
I’m not sorry for all the pain, 
I’m just sorry you didn’t stay.
I’m not sorry for all the hurt, 
I’m just sorry for all we didn’t say.
I don’t want love anymore, 
I don’t like the tears, 
They burn and sting.
Once I was free and my heart was a bright red, 
Now my finger tips are painted with all the blood you caused me to shed.
I call this depression my new home.
Where hope lingers light, 
And light doesn’t linger at all, 
Because broken we will always be, 
Black hearts, 
A new breeed.
Souls lost to all the horror of the pain, 
Our bodies forever in shock.
And we will die in this shame, we trusted.
We trusted a little too much.
We let our wants take over, only felt lust.
I’m not sorry one bit, not at all.
I’m just numb all the way through I feel nothing at all.
Our breed is a small one with no purpose but, more of us will come.
We are the broken hearted society. 

I have been singing a new song
lately, 
humming low
sweet notes, 
that reverberate in my thighs, 
and spiral into my throat
Bursting into tunes, 
in your frequency.

I am singing a psalm for you, 
chords of joy, 
sounding like ur name
humming low sweet notes, 
that hit that high 
that operatic pitch
and stay there long after 
you say 
goodnite. 

SONS of Shannon, Tamar, Trent,
Men of the Lothians, Men of Kent,
Essex, Wessex, shore and shire,
Mates of the net, the mine, the fire,
Lads of the wheel and desk and loom,
Noble and trader, squire and groom,
Come where the bugles of England play,
'Over the hills and far away!'

Southern Cross and Polar Star --
Here are the Britons bred afar;
Serry, O serry them, fierce and keen,
Shoulder to shoulder down the track,
Where, to the unretreating Jack,
The victor bugles of England play,
'Over the hills and far away!'

What if the best of our wages be
An empty sleeve, a stiff-set knee,
A crutch for the rest of life -- who cares,
So long as the One Flag floats and dares?
So long as the One Race dares and grows?
Let but the bugles of England play,
'Over the hills and far away!


'I have wiped the slate clean, 
No more reminders from the past.
Memories of what I have been, 
Have vanished at long last.
I look forward to my future new, 
Where all is territory strange.
Soon I will be among the few, 
That plans their life at long range.
I see my life laid out at my feet, 
New friends shall rally at my call.
They will be the first I will greet, 
At this my welcoming ball.
Soon all memories will depart, 
Of a past left well behind.
I will get off to a new start, 
With the best of mankind. 

Let's try once again
To make a great thing out of what we began
Ashes to ashes and all fights abandoned
Never again will I take you for granted

I'll cherish your sweet smile
And be grateful for you while
Until you come back forever

After months this is poem But a Million memories get this time refunded
I pray you will hear the call of my heart
So we can together
Write a new chapter
And have a new start


It is a damp day and 
I am stuck here inside.  
.  

forced to dream. 

It is time for me to muster courage, 
for tomorrow I must recreate my mystique in a new way.
I have a chance to start again. 
My surroundings will be fresh and my positive actions I will make ample.

For their family to abstain from intoxicating drink alway;
Because they knew it would lead them astray

But he is not so cruel I think;
To lay a stumbling block in his children's way,
And then punish them for going astray. 

To make strong drink their souls to damn;
His love is more boundless than mere man's by far,
And to say not it would be an unequal par. 

A man that truly loves his family wont allow them to drink,
Besides he knows it will destroy their intellect,
And cause them to hold their parents in disrespect. 

Strong drink makes the people commit all sorts of evil,
And must have been made by the Devil
For to make them quarrel, murder, steal, and fight,
And prevent them from doing what is right. 

The Devil delights in leading the people astray,
So that he may fill his kingdom with them without delay;
It is the greatest pleasure he can really find,
To be the enemy of all mankind. 

The Devil delights in breeding family strife,
Especially betwixt man and wife;
And if the husband comes home drunk at night,
He laughs and crys, ha! ha! what a beautiful sight. 

And if the husband asks his supper when lie comes in,
The poor wife must instantly find it for him;
And if she cannot find it, he will curse and frown,
And very likely knock his loving wife down. 

Then the children will scream aloud,
And the Devil no doubt will feel very proud,
If he can get the children to leave their own fireside,
And to tell their drunken father, they won't with him reside. 

Strong drink will cause the gambler to rob and kill his brother,
Aye! also his father and his mother,
All for the sake of getting money to gamble,
Likewise to drink, cheat, and wrangle. 

And when the burglar wants to do his work very handy,
He plies himself with a glass of Whisky, Rum, or Brandy,
To give himself courage to rob and kill,
And innocent people's blood to spill. 

Whereas if he couldn't get Whisky, Rum, or Brandy,
He wouldn't do his work so handy;
Therefore, in that respect let strong drink be abolished in time,
And that will cause a great decrease in crime. 

Therefore, for this sufficient reason remove it from society,
For seldom burglary is committed in a state of sobriety;
And I earnestly entreat ye all to join with heart and hand,
And to help to chase away the Demon drink from bonnie Scotland. 

I beseech ye all to kneel down and pray,
Then this world would be a heaven, whereas it is a hell,
And the people would have more peace in it to dwell. 

why must i be the one

deadly is painful
painful is love
love is you
you are the thing that keeps me alive. 

I've had enough
I've come undone
now every little thing's become
a trouble to attend to

I'm tired of waiting for the right time
tired of waiting
for the time to come

I'm going to fly away
and find a  new way
it's just a new way

So many years have
come and gone
and still I feel
we don't belong

I'm getting ready

I'm going to fly away
and find a new way~

It's just a new way.


  The faery land to meet,	
Now find content within its girth	
  And wonder nigh my feet.	
 
To-day a nearer love I choose	        
  And seek no distant sphere;	
For aureoled by faery dews	
  The dear brown breasts appear.	
 
With rainbow radiance come and go	
  The airy breaths of day;	        
And eve is all a pearly glow	
  With moonlit winds a-play.	
 
The lips of twilight burn my brow,	
  The arms of night caress:	
Glimmer her white eyes drooping now	        
  With grave old tenderness.	
 
I close mine eyes from dream to be	
  The diamond-rayed again,	
As in the ancient hours ere we	
  Forgot ourselves to men.	        
 
And all I thought of heaven before	
  I find in earth below:	
A sunlight in the hidden core	
  To dim the noonday glow.	
 
And with the earth my heart is glad,	        
  I move as one of old;	
With mists of silver I am clad	
  And bright with burning gold. 

ALONG the grass sweet airs are blown
Our way this day in Spring.
Of all the songs that we have known
Now which one shall we sing?
Not that, my love, ah no!—
Not this, my love? why, so!—
Yet both were ours, but hours will come and go.
The grove is all a pale frail mist,
The new year sucks the sun.
Of all the kisses that we kissed
Now which shall be the one?
Not that my love, ah no!—
Not this, my love?—heigh-ho
For all the sweets that all the winds can blow!
The branches cross above our eyes,
The skies are in a net:
And what's the thing beneath the skies
We two would most forget?
Not birth, my love, no, no,—
Not death, my love, no, no,—
The love once ours, but ours long hours ago. 

Returning Janus now prepares,
For Bec, a new supply of cares,
Sent in a bag to Dr. Swift,
Who thus displays the new-year's gift.
First, this large parcel brings you tidings
Of our good Dean's eternal chidings;
Of Nelly's pertness, Robin's leasings,
And Sheridan's perpetual teazings.
This box is cramm'd on every side
With Stella's magisterial pride.
Behold a cage with sparrows fill'd,
First to be fondled, then be kill'd.
Now to this hamper I invite you,
With six imagined cares to fright you.
Here in this bundle Janus sends
Concerns by thousands for your friends.
And here's a pair of leathern pokes,
To hold your cares for other folks.
Here from this barrel you may broach
A peck of troubles for a coach.
This ball of wax your ears will darken,
Still to be curious, never hearken.
Lest you the town may have less trouble in
Bring all your Quilca's cares to Dublin,
For which he sends this empty sack;
And so take all upon your back. 

No news of navies burnt at seas;
No noise of late spawn'd tittyries;
No closet plot or open vent,
That frights men with a Parliament:
No new device or late-found trick,
To read by th' stars the kingdom's sick;
No gin to catch the State, or wring
The free-born nostril of the King,
We send to you; but here a jolly
Verse crown'd with ivy and with holly;
That tells of winter's tales and mirth
That milk-maids make about the hearth;
That toss'd up, after Fox-i'-th'-hole;
Of Blind-man-buff, and of the care
That young men have to shoe the Mare;
Of twelf-tide cakes, of pease and beans,
Wherewith ye make those merry scenes,
And cry out, 'Hey for our town green!'--
Of ash-heaps, in the which ye use
Husbands and wives by streaks to chuse;
Of crackling laurel, which fore-sounds
A plenteous harvest to your grounds;
Of these, and such like things, for shift,
We send instead of New-year's gift.
--Read then, and when your faces shine
With buxom meat and cap'ring wine,
Remember us in cups full crown'd,
And let our city-health go round,
Quite through the young maids and the men,
To the ninth number, if not ten;
Until the fired chestnuts leap
For joy to see the fruits ye reap,
From the plump chalice and the cup
That tempts till it be tossed up.--
Then as ye sit about your embers,
Call not to mind those fled Decembers;
But think on these, that are t' appear,
As daughters to the instant year;
Sit crown'd with rose-buds, and carouse,
Till LIBER PATER twirls the house
About your ears, and lay upon
The year, your cares, that's fled and gone:
And let the russet swains the plough
And harrow hang up resting now;
And to the bag-pipe all address,
Till sleep takes place of weariness.
Frolic the full twelve holy-days. 

Send the stars light, but send not love to me.
Shelley.

I

Out of the dawning heavens that hear
Young wings and feet of the new year
Move through their twilight, and shed round
Soft showers of sound,
Soothing the season with sweet rain,
If greeting come to make me fain,
What is it I can send again?

I know not if the year shall send
Tidings to usward as a friend,
And salutation, and such things
Bear on his wings
As the soul turns and thirsts unto
With hungering eyes and lips that sue
For that sweet food which makes all new.

I know not if his light shall be
Darkness, or else light verily:
I know but that it will not part
Heart's faith from heart,
Truth from the trust in truth, nor hope
From sight of days unscaled that ope
Beyond one poor year's horoscope.

That faith in love which love's self gives,
O master of my spirit, lives,
Having in presence unremoved
Thine head beloved,
The shadow of thee, the semitone
Of thy voice heard at heart and known,
The light of thee not set nor flown.

Seas, lands, and hours, can these divide
Love from love's service, side from side,
Though no sound pass nor breath be heard
Of one good word?
To send back words of trust to thee
Were to send wings to love, when he
With his own strong wings covers me.

Who shall teach singing to the spheres,
Or motion to the flight of years?
Let soul with soul keep hand in hand
And understand,
As in one same abiding-place
We keep one watch for one same face
To rise in some short sacred space.

And all space midway is but nought
To keep true heart from faithful thought,
As under twilight stars we wait
By Time's shut gate
Till the slow soundless hinges turn,
And through the depth of years that yearn
The face of the Republic burn. 

I was plagued by the thought
of the evils of my drinking 
so I decided that I ought
to give up on my THINKING

Welcome! thrice welcome! to the year 
For it is the year I intend to leave Dundee,
Owing to the treatment I receive,
Which does my heart sadly grieve.
Every morning when I go out
The ignorant rabble they do shout
'There goes Mad Mc


Gonagall'
In derisive shouts as loud as they can bawl,
And lifts stones and snowballs, throws them at me;
And such actions are shameful to be heard in the city of Dundee.
That from the Magistrates I can get no redress.
Therefore I have made up my mind in the year of To leave the ancient City of Dundee,
Because the citizens and me cannot agree.
The reason why? -- because they disrespect me,
Which makes me feel rather discontent.
Therefore to leave them I am bent;
And I will make my arrangements without delay,
And leave Dundee some early day. 

Time is ticking and we are counting
Another day will dawn and old will go
A calendar will change with new picture
A picture with new hopes and beginning
 
Time to ponder on gone days
What we lost and what we gained
Did it give any new dimensions? 
Or just another year that came and went

The wise will be those who look beyond the dates
For them their goals are more important than celebrate
They shall pump on new determination
When others will be busy with parties and celebrations

Years will come and years will go
Time will record the history of work
Another feather added to the experience cap
Look at the rising sun, which says has come.(With the usual.)
I

In winter I get up at night,
And dress by an electric light.
In summer, autumn, ay, and spring,
I have to do the self-same thing.

I have to go to bed and hear
Pianos pounding in my ear,
And hear the janitor cavort
With garbage cans within the court.

And does it not seem hard to you
That I should have these things to do?
Is it not hard for us Manhat-
Tan children in a stuffy flat?

II

It is very nice to think
The world is full of food and drink;
But, oh, my father says to me
They cost all of his salaree.

III

When I am grown to man's estate
I shall be very proud and great;
E'en now I have no reverence,
'Cause I read comic supplements.

IV

New York is so full of a number of kids
I'm sure pretty soon we shall be invalids.

V

A child should always say what's true,
And speak when he is spoken to;
And then, when manhood's age he strikes,
He may be boorish as he likes. 

Close your eyes and gently walk
Down dreamy Memory Lane.
Now stoop to pick and smell the flowers.
Choose just short stays - or stay for hours! 
You're happy once again.
      You're YOU.

Feel release right through your frame.
Your heart begins to breathe.
With stress gone, grasp this slower pace, 
Relax - you're in a different place
And never want to leave.
      You're a new YOU.

Examine what you feel right now.
What words spring to your mind? 
Lightness?  Freedom? Relief and Bliss? 
Remember these so you'll not miss
The rescue you will find.
  You're a relaxed, new YOU.

Envision your new rescued heart
Which nothing can invade.
This place to go when things are hard
Will transform you, when once you start
To value what you've made.
  You're a relaxed and happy new YOU.

A newspaper is a collection of half-injustices 
Which, bawled by boys from mile to mile, 
Spreads its curious opinion 
To a million merciful and sneering men, 
While families cuddle the joys of the fireside 
When spurred by tale of dire lone agony. 

A newspaper is a court 
Where every one is kindly and unfairly tried 
By a squalor of honest men. 

A newspaper is a market 
Where wisdom sells its freedom 
And melons are crowned by the crowd. 

A newspaper is a game 
Where his error scores the player victory 
While another's skill wins death.

A newspaper is a symbol; 
It is feckless life's chronicle, 
A collection of loud tales 
Concentrating eternal stupidities, 
That in remote ages lived unhaltered, 
Roaming through a fenceless world. 

Heavy with haze that merges and melts free
    Into the measureless depth on either hand,
    The full day rests upon the luminous land
  In one long noon of golden reverie.
  Now hath the harvest come and gone with glee.
    The shaven fields stretch smooth and clean away,
    Purple and green, and yellow, and soft gray,
  Chequered with orchards. Farther still I see
  Towns and dim villages, whose roof-tops fill
   The distant mist, yet scarcely catch the view.
 Thorold set sultry on its plateau'd hill,
     And far to westward, where yon pointed towers
   Rise faint and ruddy from the vaporous blue,
     Saint Catharines, city of the host of flowers. 

He was commanded by the natural law
And took his baggage that was invisible
Put it to the back of the body
And walked along and alone in pavements
He was old and pale in his face
The big bundle having such a weight
He now becomes slowly as a hunchback
Unable to walk without a support
And looks in the ways for a strong stick
Which he used as a walking stick for support
Then slowly walked, walked to the end
The end somewhere he apprehended
The life he spent in the world and sins
The bundle carried the end results
Nothing he could carry in the journey
A small bundle helped him in the ways
The drops of water and some fresh dates
In the intervals he took a relax in shades
Under the trees that planted by nobles
The tree told him do you remember me
Once you tried to disturb my existence
And cut my branches one by one
Not for any profit or compulsions
But for your own entertainment and test sharpness
The newly bought up knife for domestic purpose
Still I gives you shade and coolness
I know you are going from me ever
May a new experience of life may bless you
There we can do nice things to the world. 

If you have some place
Some place you could well spare
Make a niche for me in your heart
To warm me within your space
I will never, never depart.

I will be more than a name and face
If you could grant me this grace
To live in this honoured place
I would be part of your present
Not a part of your past
If only time would linger on
And make this dream last and last.

A silly poem it seems
But then, so are many dreams. 

Last night she walked into my world, 
her touch so soft, so sure, 
last night she reached across the mile, 
and whispered such sweet a word, 

Last night she braved the unknown, 
and danced with me a stranger, 
Last night she took my hand, 
showing me no danger.

Last night she touched me deep, 
my spirit  has been set free, 
last night she was miles away, 
yet I felt her here with me. 

Alone with one lamp 
I bite into the red pearl of a nectarine.
It’s been a year of lay-offs, impulsive 
travels, and birth 
of a daughter. I work 
here all night in the garage 
full of books, all night 
with one lamp, with spiders 
and moths, their sudden 
unacknowledged deaths, 
their births that are always hidden.
I work alongside of broken ironing boards, 
boxes full of forgotten stuff, and a mirror
with three sides of the frame gone—
and how the remaining 
part is connected
I do not know. The garage
is connected to the garden. I sense
the avocadoes ripening and the ring lines
growing inside the tree. A few of the late 
leaves have started turning alongside of
the ripened fruit, outside of 
my peculiar ripening, in here, 
among the faded backs of the folding chairs, 
and my notebooks with wire spirals coming undone. 
I sit in here facing the medley of interiors I prefer, 
unthreading myself along the way. 

Twenty years ago I stayed with you, 
guests at this two-storied hotel.
We had separate rooms on the ground floor.
Over drinks, the bartender said to me: 
'You are a good couple', confidentially.
For you had good looks and charm.
We went out that night to the dance, 
where I drank beer, while you sipped wine, 
as I talked to old school friends.
Later, you faded from my life, like youth
and all I have this night is memories. 

Tonight I am staying in the same hotel, 
in a warm room up on the first floor, 
with an occasional view of the mountain, 
its summit symmetrical above the clouds.
The room has a writing table, a double bed; 
two black reading lamps by the white sheets.
It is an oasis of peace and calm for me.
Tonight there is no dance to attend, 
no beer or champagne to drink either, 
as I saw through alcohol eventually.
I am here for just one night, you see; 
time to think of you as I descend
to reception, then out into the cold again.
I pat the car and say, 'let's go friend'. 

     -Waitara,June, 

Dripping drops of diamond dews
Ice-cold beads encompassing numerous hues
Swirling down the peacock-green leaves
And get disappeared on the bed of sheaves.

Dew drenched path bear fine imprints
Of scurrilous insects in their nocturnal stints
Cool are the Moon, the trees, and the huts in the dark
Coolest of all is the place where I work.

The cool breeze brings the weirdest of tales
As an eerie silence reigns over undulating vales
Hoots of an owl or the ruffling of feathers
Down into the spine they send the shivers.

Sliding down to the west, on the slate
Of an opaque sky the panoply of teeming stars
Will hide and rest on the lap of the earth
Followed with its cohorts by the exuberant Mars; 


In the roof-tops, foliages and stacks of hays
The witches move hunting for preys
The priest with candles and a silver platter
Mutter prayers sprinkling the Holy-water.


Warming itself by the cindering fire
The cat dozes off with half closed eyes
It gives a shake to its languid tail
To get rid of the bothering flies; 

For the white beam, it won’t be late
To spread across the sky through Heaven’s gate.
For afar a mellifluous tune can be heard
Perhaps to its beloved is calling a bird.

Clouds of colours flit across the firms
As the birds dive for supple worms.
At the sign of night’s surreptitious descend
Village girls gather at the river band.A Night—there lay the Days between—
The Day that was Before—
And Day that was Behind—were one—
And now—'twas Night—was here—

Slow—Night—that must be watched away—
As Grains upon a shore—
Too imperceptible to note—
Till it be night—no more—Evening casts early shadows in December.
As dusk falls heart is filled with longing, 
I have an appointment, I suddenly remember-
Quickly I put on my coat and stockings.

Stepping out gingerly in the still and chilly night
To meet my celestial kin, for an animated conversation-
Soon, my face is bathed with full Moon’s silver light
 And the sky, colour of grey pearl fills me with exaltation-

A light breeze comes carrying a heady fragrance, 
I spot Raat ki Raani with its pale green flowers, 
Presiding with its crowning glory, emitting its essence
Intoxicated, I slowdown my pace and linger for an hour-

Smiling to myself, of my own volition I return home, 
Wistfully selecting logs to put in the fireplace, 
Extend my arms to warm my hands, now numb with cold
Stealthily, you come and hold me in a warm embrace




The sky is overcast 
With a continuous cloud of texture close, 
Heavy and wan, all whitened by the Moon, 
Which through that veil is indistinctly seen, 
A dull, contracted circle, yielding light 
So feebly spread, that not a shadow falls, 
Chequering the ground--from rock, plant, tree, or tower. 
At length a pleasant instantaneous gleam 
Startles the pensive traveller while he treads 
His lonesome path, with unobserving eye 
Bent earthwards; he looks up--the clouds are split 
Asunder,--and above his head he sees 
The clear Moon, and the glory of the heavens. 
There, in a black-blue vault she sails along, 
Followed by multitudes of stars, that, small 
And sharp, and bright, along the dark abyss 
Drive as she drives: how fast they wheel away, 
Yet vanish not!--the wind is in the tree, 
But they are silent;--still they roll along 
Immeasurably distant; and the vault, 
Built round by those white clouds, enormous clouds, 
Still deepens its unfathomable depth. 
At length the Vision closes; and the mind, 
Not undisturbed by the delight it feels, 
Which slowly settles into peaceful calm, 
Is left to muse upon the solemn scene. 

By the blue taper's trembling light,
No more I waste the wakeful night,
Intent with endless view to pore
The schoolmen and the sages o'er:
Their books from wisdom widely stray,
Or point at best the longest way.
I'll seek a readier path, and go
Where wisdom's surely taught below.

How deep yon azure dyes the sky!
Where orbs of gold unnumber'd lie,
While through their ranks in silver pride
The nether crescent seems to glide!
The slumb'ring breeze forgets to breathe,
The lake is smooth and clear beneath,
Where once again the spangled show
Descends to meet our eyes below.
The grounds which on the right aspire,
In dimness from the view retire:
The left presents a place of graves,
Whose wall the silent water laves.
That steeple guides thy doubtful sight
Among the livid gleams of night.
There pass with melancholy state,
By all the solemn heaps of fate,
And think, as softly-sad you tread
Above the venerable dead,
"Time was, like thee they life possest,
And time shall be, that thou shalt rest


Those graves, with bending osier bound,
That nameless heave the crumpled ground,
Quick to the glancing thought disclose,
Where toil and poverty repose.

The flat smooth stones that bear a name,
The chisel's slender help to fame,
(Which ere our set of friends decay
Their frequent steps may wear away,)
A middle race of mortals own,
Men, half ambitious, all unknown.

The marble tombs that rise on high,
Whose dead in vaulted arches lie,
Whose pillars swell with sculptur'd stones,
Arms, angels, epitaphs, and bones,
These (all the poor remains of state)
Adorn the rich, or praise the great;
Who, while on earth in fame they live,
Are senseless of the fame they give.

Ha! while I gaze, pale Cynthia fades,
The bursting earth unveils the shades!
All slow, and wan, and wrapp'd with shrouds
They rise in visionary crowds,
And all with sober accent cry,
"Think, mortal, what it is to die


Now from yon black and fun'ral yew,
That bathes the charnel-house with dew,
Methinks I hear a voice begin;
(Ye ravens, cease your croaking din;
Ye tolling clocks, no time resound
O'er the long lake and midnight ground)
It sends a peal of hollow groans,
Thus speaking from among the bones.

"When men my scythe and darts supply,
How great a king of fears am I!
They view me like the last of things:
They make, and then they dread, my stings.
Fools! if you less provok'd your fears,
No more my spectre form appears.
Death's but a path that must be trod,
A port of calms, a state of ease
From the rough rage of swelling seas.

"Why then thy flowing sable stoles,
Deep pendant cypress, mourning poles,
Loose scarfs to fall athwart thy weeds,
Long palls, drawn hearses, cover'd steeds,
And plumes of black, that, as they tread,
Nod o'er the scutcheons of the dead?

"Nor can the parted body know,
Nor wants the soul, these forms of woe.
As men who long in prison dwell,
With lamps that glimmer round the cell,
Whene'er their suff'ring years are run,
Spring forth to greet the glitt'ring sun:
Such joy though far transcending sense,
Have pious souls at parting hence.
On earth, and in the body plac'd,
A few, and evil years they waste;
But when their chains are cast aside,
See the glad scene unfolding wide,
Clap the glad wing, and tow'r away,
And mingle with the blaze of day

"After dancing on the nightly lips
Dreams melt in
The unrealized passion of the night
 
After choking the night's lungs
Nightmares break into
Dripping sweat on the night's skin
 
Where do colourful dreams
And nightmares equally
Hide in this gorging night? 
 
Dismembered by the ravenous night
The vacuous body lumbers 
In the vacant corridors of the day
 
May rsshe makes music

in his bed 

while drops of light

illumine skin.  

fingers burning beautifully




(



)Nights like this are
Lonesome and Long
Wish you were here
To sing me a song.

A song of love, 
A song of pain, 
The winter sunshine
And the summer rain.

Some smiles to cherish, 
Some tears to weep, 
Memories together
For us to keep.

A gentle lullaby. 
Drifting us to sleep. 

leave me to my silence
and I will leave you to your laugh
leave me to my darkness
and I will leave you to your past
or let the silence take you
and let me share your smile
while the darkness is around us
if only for awhile. 

Lo! where the Moon along the sky
Sails with her happy destiny;
Oft is she hid from mortal eye
Or dimly seen,
But when the clouds asunder fly
How bright her mien!

Far different we--a froward race,
Thousands though rich in Fortune's grace
With cherished sullenness of pace
Their way pursue, 
Ingrates who wear a smileless face
The whole year through.

If kindred humours e'er would make
My spirit droop for drooping's sake,
From Fancy following in thy wake,
Bright ship of heaven!
A counter impulse let me take
And be forgiven. 

It had been an effort -
the getting there.
A long way too
and the weather was foul.

As for the parking? 
Superlatively expensive -
like the glass of Shiraz
(gulped hastily to beat the bell) .

But when the house lights dimmed
and the band lifted their instruments, 
and brass and woodwinds 
burst forth with bright voices, 
my heart danced.

'Chasing Sheep is Best Left to Shepherds'
(I know every bar)   
had accompanied my Alice and her White Rabbit
on their looking glass journey
ten years ago.

'An Eye for Optical Theory'
was there in the flesh, 
rhythm upon rhythm
punching the air.
Frenetic, 
compulsive, 
effervescent.

The master himself
spoke not a word, 
but sat black-coated, 
driving his piano -
like Schumacher behind the wheel.

When the night was over, 
I floated home
clutching my new CD
with its autograph in black texta. 

Bleed the seeds words broken dust
Read the lines a fading destiny
Left foot cleft right foot for thee
Untrodden tread a trace sky cast

And sing and sing like heaven above
And burn and burn like hell down below
Move hands shake air forever in love
With rains and winds storms and snow

Believe in creeds cut in stones of blue
Light sped particles fading too fast
Turn into a sign of a human hue
Tainting the virgin dresses of light

The truth borne naked will naked die
So sing on thorns of the bleeding sky


Eyes close but do not block out sight, 
I cannot sleep but toss and turn.
Not knowing  where or why
my insecurity will bite.

Tormented so by restless thought, 
I walk the tunnels full of doors
heart pounding in my chest.
I am distraught.

I fear not demons of the night
tongue of fire, tail a spike.
But ropes of expectation
bind me tight.

Breath escapes but quickly caught, 
smothered  by  a gentle kiss
Another nightmare ends
with comfort sought. 

So that what you had thought of to spend
would be given to another instead. 

For what will I take to my Father's home? 
It is not of what you bought me I own.
what good would these gifts do me then? 

that is my prayer and all that I need.
Take your time and money and give to another

passionate lovers; 
have not quite turned the cusp to manhood
—with great heads of hair
and piercing brown, blue
and gray eyes.

I turn them each away—saying, 
"not tonight "
and they leave
with curses
under
their breath. 

He was so proud to walk
Along with his father to the school
To join the class in happiness
A great happy event of life it was.

With great joy he studied well
With wonderful days of play as well
Never complained to the class teacher
The classmates were such noble hearts

With great expectation he continued
His studies in such spirit of well being
Never hesitated to do the home works
Ever ready to answer the questions.

Everywhere he was attracted in performances
Quiz competitions, talent searches, excelled
Reading of poems and creating his own
In such beautiful simple words he made
Ever he was a hero in classes to others.

Leadership talented, teachers exclaimed
Poetic talent classmates praised
Writing skills exemplary literary forum noted
All were praised the qualities of the student.

Future is someone's guess, facts are different
Circumstances prevented him higher studies
Somehow managed with private study for success
A triumphant human being now, living in dignity
And tries hard to find means for poor children.
For opportunity of little ones through education. 

Of all the noble jobs in the world
I think the teaching comes first
The teacher is respected everywhere
When they teaches in dedication
And through their products they known.
The great reward for the teacher
The real success of his disciples
The intellectuals they became
When the teacher prides himself
Different streams they teaches
Different jobs the students reaches
In occasions success ladder they climbs
And somewhere in way of life he meets
His beloved teacher and shows his respect
A teacher a great asset of society always
More he studies most always he gives.
The noble life of a teacher ever valuable. 

In such a Night, when every louder Wind
Is to its distant Cavern safe confin'd;
And only gentle Zephyr fans his Wings, {
And lonely Philomel, still waking, sings; {
Or from some Tree, fam'd for the Owl's delight,
She, hollowing clear, directs the Wand'rer right:
In such a Night, when passing Clouds give place,
Or thinly vail the Heav'ns mysterious Face;
When in some River, overhung with Green,
The waving Moon and trembling Leaves are seen;
When freshen'd Grass now bears it self upright,
And makes cool Banks to pleasing Rest invite,
Whence springs the Woodbind, and the Bramble–Rose,
And where the sleepy Cowslip shelter'd grows;
Whilst now a paler Hue the Foxglove takes,
Yet checquers still with Red the dusky brakes:
When scattered Glow-worms, but in Twilight fine,
Shew trivial Beauties watch their Hour to shine; 
Whilst Salisb'ry stands the Test of every Light, { 
In perfect Charms, and perfect Virtue bright:
When Odours, which declin'd repelling Day,
Thro' temp'rate Air uninterrupted stray;
When darken'd Groves their softest Shadows wear,
And falling Waters we distinctly hear;
When thro' the Gloom more venerable shows
Some ancient Fabrick, awful in Repose,
While Sunburnt Hills their swarthy Looks conceal,
And swelling Haycocks thicken up the Vale:
When the loos'd Horse now, as his Pasture leads,
Comes slowly grazing thro' th' adjoining Meads, 
Whose stealing Pace and lengthen'd Shade we fear,
Till torn up Forage in his Teeth we hear:
When nibbling Sheep at large pursue their Food,
And unmolested Kine rechew the Cud;
When Curlews cry beneath the Village-walls,
And to her straggling Brood the Partridge calls;
Their shortliv'd Jubilee the Creatures keep,
Which but endures, whilst Tyrant-Man do's sleep; 
When a sedate Content the Spirit feels,
And no fierce Light disturbs, whilst it reveals; 
But silent Musings urge the Mind to seek
Something, too high for Syllables to speak;
Till the free Soul, to a compos'dness charm'd,
Finding the Elements of Rage disarm'd,
O'er all below a solemn Quiet grown,
Joys in th' inferiour World and thinks it like her Own:
In such a Night let Me abroad remain,
Till Morning breaks, and All's confus'd again;
Our Cares, our Toils, our Clamours are renew'd, 
Or Pleasures, seldom reach'd, again pursu'd.

'Tis the year's midnight, and it is the day's,
     Lucy's, who scarce seven hours herself unmasks;
         The sun is spent, and now his flasks
         Send forth light squibs, no constant rays;
             The world's whole sap is sunk;
     The general balm th' hydroptic earth hath drunk,
     Whither, as to the bed's feet, life is shrunk,
     Dead and interr'd; yet all these seem to laugh,
     Compar'd with me, who am their epitaph.

   Study me then, you who shall lovers be
   At the next world, that is, at the next spring;
       For I am every dead thing,
       In whom Love wrought new alchemy.
           For his art did express
   A quintessence even from nothingness,
   From dull privations, and lean emptiness;
   He ruin'd me, and I am re-begot
   Of absence, darkness, death: things which are not.

   All others, from all things, draw all that's good,
   Life, soul, form, spirit, whence they being have;
       I, by Love's limbec, am the grave
       Of all that's nothing. Oft a flood
           Have we two wept, and so
   Drown'd the whole world, us two; oft did we grow
   To be two chaoses, when we did show
   Care to aught else; and often absences
   Withdrew our souls, and made us carcasses.

   But I am by her death (which word wrongs her)
   Of the first nothing the elixir grown;
       Were I a man, that I were one
       I needs must know; I should prefer,
           If I were any beast,
   Some ends, some means; yea plants, yea stones detest,
   And love; all, all some properties invest;
   If I an ordinary nothing were,
   As shadow, a light and body must be here.

   But I am none; nor will my sun renew.
   You lovers, for whose sake the lesser sun
       At this time to the Goat is run
       To fetch new lust, and give it you,
           Enjoy your summer all;
   Since she enjoys her long night's festival,
   Let me prepare towards her, and let me call
   This hour her vigil, and her eve, since this
   Both the year's, and the day's deep midnight is. 

A noiseless, patient spider,	 
I mark’d, where, on a little promontory, it stood, isolated;	 
Mark’d how, to explore the vacant, vast surrounding,	 
It launch’d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself;	 
Ever unreeling them—ever tirelessly speeding them.	         
 
And you, O my Soul, where you stand,	 
Surrounded, surrounded, in measureless oceans of space,	 
Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing,—seeking the spheres, to connect them;	 
Till the bridge you will need, be form’d—till the ductile anchor hold;	 
Till the gossamer thread you fling, catch somewhere, O my Soul.

All poets write in insanity
Impervious, to the entire
You, 
The king of your own poetic empire
as thoughts get formation
each different, in poetic efficiency

I, 
An adulterated soul
You, 
With the rein, control
And you make me lurk in your words
Like those lonely, pale birds
Your quill, into that paper, bleeds
And she says in her musical voice: Proceed"
and you portray my misplaced soul  
in the veiled privacy of twilight
in your new-born mind of sight, deep insight

You, 
in a steep valley side of paradise
idly extracting the elixir of the unexplainable
and redressed, arise
Exotically, master the unattainable
in expectant poetry; 
churned out of sleep in disharmony
I stand still, hopeless
sleep  a sleep, but dreamless
betwixt you and your sword
that swings in its own accord
that pierce into my soul, 
and carve out a hole

Eccentric, you
Carried away by the river of your soul
Into a fathomless abyss of fantasy
And you swim with the demons in that void
And rule king and decree
If they live or die
you’re never clear, you’re never explainable


Your hair creeps down your knees, and you don’t care
With no sense of time, you sit in your chair
Engrossed in your void of abstruse sight
That chasm of immortal delight
Why? You, like a fearful knight
Are you some angel in the air of a sprite? 
Your body dies, but you live in tranquility
Was what you ate in heaven, the fruit of eternity? 

Intrusions in delusions
Allusions of illusions 
infinite, widespread
uncorrupted, unsaid

The spark of life, mystifying, 
Elegant, reflecting elegance
You, 
You laughed about a jejune mind; me
You jeered about sterile soul; me

You laughed, and I cried
You lived and I dreaded
It’s my turn to laugh
Remember, 
My face will reflect, back to you
Back to you
Just as yours did, 
From those magazine covers 
that reflected back like paintings on polished mirrors

Never! Never! Never! 
Never would I let you to out master me
Understand
I too have a voice
A voice
You transform me into you
Through your words
The gravity of your pen holds all down
But I will still be me.
Can I? 

o' clock, December I wrote this poem at midnight, without any lights on! 

A little fish runs on a wheel
A little worm hops in a hole

A little hat has lost its sole
A little petal has no peel
A little mouse sings in a bowl

A little dog dances a reel
A little frog jumps on a mole
A little fish runs on a wheel 

A little boat rings out a peal
A little bell loses its keel
A little mouse sings in a bowl

A little rock slips on a seal
A little perch walks on a pole
A little fish runs on a wheel

A little card shakes on a deal
A little sigh fancies a meal
A little mouse sings in a bowl
A little fish runs on a wheel


There are songs for the morning and songs for the night, 
For sunrise and sunset, the stars and the moon; 
But who will give praise to the fulness of light, 
And sing us a song of the glory of noon? 
Oh, the high noon, the clear noon, 
The noon with golden crest; 
When the blue sky burns, and the great sun turns 
With his face to the way of the west! 

How swiftly he rose in the dawn of his strength; 
How slowly he crept as the morning wore by; 
Ah, steep was the climbing that led him at length 
To the height of his throne in the wide summer sky. 
Oh, the long toil, the slow toil, 
The toil that may not rest, 
Till the sun looks down from his journey's crown, 
To the wonderful way of the west! 

Then a quietness falls over meadow and hill, 
The wings of the wind in the forest are furled, 
The river runs softly, the birds are all still, 
The workers are resting all over the world. 
Oh, the good hour, the kind hour, 
The hour that calms the breast! 
Little inn half-way on the road of the day, 
Where it follows the turn to the west! 

There's a plentiful feast in the maple-tree shade, 
The lilt of a song to an old-fashioned tune, 
The talk of a friend, or the kiss of a maid, 
To sweeten the cup that we drink to the noon. 
Oh, the deep noon, the full noon, 
Of all the day the best! 
When the blue sky burns, and the great sun turns 
To his home by the way of the west. 

THE dinner-bell, the dinner-bell
Is ringing loud and clear;
Through hill and plain, through street and lane,
It echoes far and near;
From curtained hall and whitewashed stall,
Wherever men can hide,
Like bursting waves from ocean caves,
They float upon the tide.

I smell the smell of roasted meat!
I hear the hissing fry
The beggars know where they can go,
But where, oh where shall I?
At twelve o'clock men took my hand,
At two they only stare,
And eye me with a fearful look,
As if I were a bear!

The poet lays his laurels down,
And hastens to his greens;
The happy tailor quits his goose,
To riot on his beans;
The weary cobbler snaps his thread,
The printer leaves his pi;
His very devil hath a home,
But what, oh what have I?

Methinks I hear an angel voice,
That softly seems to say
'Pale stranger, all may yet be well,
Then wipe thy tears away;
Erect thy head, and cock thy hat,
And follow me afar,
And thou shalt have a jolly meal,
And charge it at the bar.'

I hear the voice! I go! I go!
Prepare your meat and wine!
They little heed their future need
Who pay not when they dine.
Give me to-day the rosy bowl,
Give me one golden dream,--
To-morrow kick away the stool,
And dangle from the beam

FROM THE GERMAN OF UHLAND.

There sits a lovely maiden,
The ocean murmuring nigh;
She throws the hook, and watches;
The fishes pass it by.

A ring, with a red jewel,
Is sparkling on her hand;
Upon the hook she binds it,
And flings it from the land.

Uprises from the water
A hand like ivory fair.
What gleams upon its finger?
The golden ring is there.

Uprises from the bottom
A young and handsome knight;
In golden scales he rises,
That glitter in the light.

The maid is pale with terror--
'Nay, Knight of Ocean, nay,
It was not thee I wanted;
Let go the ring, I pray.'

'Ah, maiden, not to fishes
The bait of gold is thrown;
The ring shall never leave me,
And thou must be my own.

'Once the nation's chief was honored by the company of one,
Who to lift a fallen people had a work of worth begun,
Lofty things had he accomplished for a race so long despised,
In a land where naught but color by the whites are ever prized.

Booker Washington, the teacher, with the president has dined,
Southern whites it gave convulsions, for to such they're not inclined,
'Tis the color, not achievements, that their fancies recognize,
Whites alone receive their plaudits, Negro worth they will not prize.

Roosevelt was censured sorely, half the country writhed and hissed,
Just because he shared his dinner with a Negro—there's the gist—
'Twas the manhood not the color that the president admired,
Souls of worth demand attention, only such his mind desired.

'Down with Washington the 'nigger' and with Roosevelt, because
He has made of him an equal—how offensive to our laws,
Worthy deeds are not for black men' is the constant cry they raise,
'All advancement of such people brings proportionate dispraise.'

Hark! the press begins to clamor, to the South it says 'beware!
Lest equality with 'niggers' in the end we'll have to share;
Anti-nigger is our platform, how to crush a 'nigger' man,
Officers must be elected as resulting from this plan.'

Washington is far above him—-any man who fails to see,
Good when found upon a Negro, from a lack of charity,
See the Southern degradation! view the monster once again,
How it measures deeds of merit by the color of the skin.

Roosevelt was very careful on the choosing of a guest,
Here is what he did for Tillman, in his zeal to have the best, 
Cancelled out his invitation and his company refused,
Dined the best of peoples only—other classes he excused.

Down with prejudice and envy! should be wafted to the breeze,
For the Southern slaves of fashion need a prompt and sure release,
In the teachings of the Master while the path of earth He trod,

Dear Suicide – to me come –
Expect you I do soon –
Dance we will – beneath Freedom's moon! 
And Independence – of her we'll keep some! 
Hurry now – my lifelong lover – 
On Sunset bridge I stand –
For you I wait – to sweep me up – 
Away from Conformity's land! 
Fading skies to our blue eyes –
Will themselves display –
With you I'll dance and play! 
Yours truly – Eccentric


Near the dry river's water-mark we found
Your brother Minnegan,
Flopped like a fish against the muddy ground.
Beany, the kid whose yellow hair turns green,
Told me to find you, even if the rain,
And tell you he was drowned.

I hid behind the chassis on the bank,
The wreck of someone's Ford:
I was afraid to come and wake you drunk:
You told me once the waking up was hard,
The daylight beating at you like a board.
Blood in my stomach sank.

Beside, you told him never to go out
Along the river-side
Drinking and singing, clattering about.
You might have thrown a rock at me and cried
I was to blame, I let him fall in the road
And pitch down on his side.

Well, I'll get hell enough when I get home
For coming up this far,
Leaving the note, and running as I came.
I'll go and tell my father where you are.
You'd better go find Minnegan before
Policemen hear and come.

Beany went home, and I got sick and ran,
You old son of a bitch.
You better hurry down to Minnegan;
He's drunk or dying now, I don't know which,
Rolled in the roots and garbage like a fish,
The poor old man. 

In the spiritual darkness
Of a sun long set

Two ships passing
Incredibly yet
To Internet's amazement
A 'connection' met

In the spiritual darkness
Of a sun




But you left me alone on this earth
Left me to wait for your rebirth
But this never came
It won’t be the same

For Danni, I keep memories of you
You’re still my bestie, girl it is true
I still have our friendship necklace
You, no-one can replace

For Mitch, I can’t believe you’re gone
Now by myself I watch the break of dawn
I miss you so much, that I want to die
Because now every night I sit alone and cry

For Julia, you are forever in my heart
And though you are gone, we will never be apart
Oh my sweet little angel, I love you so
Your my best girl, and I'll let everyone know

For Cameron, my baby boy, I love you
I wish you were still here baby I need you
I listen to our song, and let out a tear
Then take a walk, out on your favourite pier

I love all my friends of past
Guys, our friendship will last
I will see you in heaven soon I swear! 
But until then, so long and take care

I love you all

P my baby boy, Cameron (March - December This morning, you stopped by the house.
You left your flip-flops and your sneakers 
In the basement, where I once saw a mouse.

You open the floor for all types of rumors, 
Please come back to pick up your belongings.
You also left a few indictable items, a few things.

Rush back, pronto, upon receipt of this note, 
Before my wife, who customarily finds a fault
In everything that I do, returns home this evening.

Save me the trouble, come to pick up everything.
Ring the bell five times; I will be in the bedroom.
Be careful, not get tripped by the black broom. 

The world of differently able ones
The humans, their handicaps
The hardships, their life moments
The learning disabilities, deficiencies
Feel the human mind with sad memories
Here the novelist created a human being
A human being with a peculiar character
Hunch back of notredam the great novel
The characters, the Esmeralda
The final moments, and final rest
The world of novels make it superior
The Hunch Back of notredam readers can't forget. 

She looked not unlike the anti-heroine
of her own novels
or was it the other way around? 
mousey but together, 
neatly dressed 
in an understated way
like her Paris dressmaker mother
who'd fled Vienna

Though in fact she was a brilliant bluestocking lecturer
and trenchant critic
who'd embarked, on the side, 
on novel writing

However the British
don't like people who do two things well
and the critics - mostly men -
panned her rotten
while the women reserved judgment.

She had a standard plot -
mousey, together spinster
meets possible, quiet Him
who might be The One
but who turns out too morally wet
for Her.

But her increasing sublety with variations to this
and increasing literary skills
won her praise from feminist critics
and even a minor prize.

I had expressed envious admiration for her trenchant criticism
to a colleague; one day
the unsolicited word came: 
she had expressed interest in meeting me. 

A shared life of letters -
the Sunday papers read in bed -
with her reviews in them -
the flow of sparkling wit -

a shared life of letters -
the plot of all her books the same..
the failed romance, 
the material to hand. 
the literary world's knowing gossip..

I flunked it

Subsequently, 
on Friday afternoons, 
I sat opposite her on the bus
from Piccadilly 
to her small but dress-maker- neat flat
just off King's Road, Chelsea
bought with the prize-money, I guess
and the increased royalties
(the men still scoffing at her standard plot, 
the women admiring her subtlety in describing
the bruised but knowing human heart. )     

I knew her face, from in the press; 
she didn't know mine.
I sat opposite her on the bus
- neatly dressed, together -
contemplating
in bittersweet incongruity
the novel I never lived
and she never wrote
differently


There!  See the line of lights,
A chain of stars down either side the street --
Why can't you lift the chain and give it to me,
A necklace for my throat?  I'd twist it round
And you could play with it.  You smile at me
As though I were a little dreamy child
Behind whose eyes the fairies live. . . .  And see,
The people on the street look up at us
Our royal carriage is a motor bus,
We watch our subjects with a haughty joy. . . .
How still you are!  Have you been hard at work
And are you tired to-night?  It is so long
Since I have seen you -- four whole days, I think.
My heart is crowded full of foolish thoughts
Like early flowers in an April meadow,
And I must give them to you, all of them,
Before they fade.  The people I have met,
The play I saw, the trivial, shifting things
That loom too big or shrink too little, shadows
That hurry, gesturing along a wall,
Haunting or gay -- and yet they all grow real
And take their proper size here in my heart
When you have seen them. . . .  There's the Plaza now,
A lake of light!  To-night it almost seems
That all the lights are gathered in your eyes,
Drawn somehow toward you.  See the open park
Lying below us with a million lamps
Scattered in wise disorder like the stars.
On constellations floating under Him
Tangled in clouds. . . .  Come, then, and let us walk
Since we have reached the park.  It is our garden,
All black and blossomless this winter night,
But we bring April with us, you and I;
We set the whole world on the trail of spring.
I think that every path we ever took
Has marked our footprints in mysterious fire,
Delicate gold that only fairies see.
When they wake up at dawn in hollow tree-trunks
And come out on the drowsy park, they look
Along the empty paths and say, "Oh, here
They went, and here, and here, and here!  Come, see,
Here is their bench, take hands and let us dance
About it in a windy ring and make
A circle round it only they can cross
When they come back again!" . . .  Look at the lake --
Do you remember how we watched the swans
That night in late October while they slept?
Swans must have stately dreams, I think.  But now
The lake bears only thin reflected lights
That shake a little.  How I long to take
One from the cold black water -- new-made gold
To give you in your hand!  And see, and see,
There is a star, deep in the lake, a star!
Oh, dimmer than a pearl -- if you stoop down
Your hand could almost reach it up to me. . . .

There was a new frail yellow moon to-night --
I wish you could have had it for a cup
With stars like dew to fill it to the brim. . . .

How cold it is!  Even the lights are cold;
They have put shawls of fog around them, see!
What if the air should grow so dimly white
That we would lose our way along the paths
Made new by walls of moving mist receding
The more we follow. . . .  What a silver night!
That was our bench the time you said to me
The long new poem -- but how different now,
How eerie with the curtain of the fog
Making it strange to all the friendly trees!
There is no wind, and yet great curving scrolls
Carve themselves, ever changing, in the mist.
Walk on a little, let me stand here watching
To see you, too, grown strange to me and far. . . .
I used to wonder how the park would be
If one night we could have it all alone --
No lovers with close arm-encircled waists
To whisper and break in upon our dreams.
And now we have it!  Every wish comes true!
We are alone now in a fleecy world;
Even the stars have gone.  We two alone!




A Mother's breast: 
Safe refuge from her childish fears, 
From childish troubles, childish tears, 
Mists that enshroud her dawning years! 
see how in sleep she seems to sing 
A voiceless psalm--an offering 
Raised, to the glory of her King 
In Love: for Love is Rest. 


A Darling's kiss: 
Dearest of all the signs that fleet 
From lips that lovingly repeat 
Again, again, the message sweet! 
Full to the brim with girlish glee, 
A child, a very child is she, 
Whose dream of heaven is still to be 
At Home: for Home is Bliss. 

It's the curiousest thing in creation,
Whenever I hear that old song,
'Do They Miss Me at Home?' I'm so bothered,
My life seems as short as it's long!--
Far ever'thing 'pears like adzackly
It 'peared, in the years past and gone,--
When I started out sparkin', at twenty,
And had my first neckercher on!

Though I'm wrinkelder, older and grayer
Right now than my parents was then,
You strike up that song, 'Do They Miss Me?'
And I'm jest a youngster again!--
I'm a-standin' back there in the furries
A-wishin' far evening to come,
And a-whisperin' over and over
Them words, 'Do They Miss Me at Home?'

You see, Marthy Ellen she sung it
The first time I heerd it; and so,
As she was my very first sweetheart,
It reminds of her, don't you know,--
How her face ust to look, in the twilight,
As I tuck her to spellin'; and she
Kep' a-hummin' that song 'tel I ast her,
Pine-blank, ef she ever missed me!

I can shet my eyes now, as you sing it,
And hear her low answerin' words,
And then the glad chirp of the crickets
As clear as the twitter of birds;
And the dust in the road is like velvet,
And the ragweed, and fennel, and grass
Is as sweet as the scent of the lilies
Of Eden of old, as we pass.

'Do They Miss Me at Home?' Sing it lower--
And softer--and sweet as the breeze
That powdered our path with the snowy
White bloom of the old locus'-trees!
Let the whippoorwills he'p you to sing it,
And the echoes 'way over the hill,
'Tel the moon boolges out, in a chorus
Of stars, and our voices is still.

But, oh! 'They's a chord in the music
That's missed when _her_ voice is away!'
Though I listen from midnight 'tel morning,
And dawn, 'tel the dusk of the day;
And I grope through the dark, lookin' up'ards
And on through the heavenly dome,
With my longin' soul singin' and sobbin'
The words, 'Do They Miss Me at Home.


'The fire proclaims 
While laying the dead in pyre
I am swallowing you not my own
The destiny and duty entrusted me
To take back you in me for ever
Surely you are engaged to be reborn
Unless you are entitled for salvation
The fire the ultimate power
Ever ready to swallow anything, everything
In Indian traditional customs on death
Fire have a place to act with. 

Here, the day breaks
and the night ends-
A field of golden sunlight
lies ahead
and beyond that
an ocean full of rays
All that glitters, is here; 
trails, like the streaks of light
the velvety green of the parks
that was gifted to the Earth
by some distant shiny star
Milky clouds are
like a looking glass
in which, the images of unseen wafts
twinkle with a strange vivacity
Even if it rains here, it is like
as if the pearls full of light
are descending from above
as if the flowers, fruits, leaves
the trunk of trees and their branches
all have bathed in the crystal clear water
The boisterous streams descending from
the green hills
look like the falls full of glare
All the birds here
happen to be the cranes
even the ravens
are masquerading like them
(How insane! They haven't grasped
the reality of this place yet) 
The moment, the dark shroud of the bodies
lands here, it gets transformed 
into a white cloak
The eyes impulsively start seeing
the awe hidden in the dreams
and the naked glare of the truth
Here, there is no perception of divinities 
Here, dwell the human beings-! ! ! 
 
Had labored long to find
That seemed completely blind.

He saw man's temples rise and fall, 
He saw nature's wrath prevail; 
He saw the mighty dominate
The humble, meek and frail.

He studied faith's theologies
And watched their wars unfold; 
His two eyed friends excuses were-
'These things have been foretold'.

Still, on he searched the mysteries
Of life's final afterglow; 
Till, void of hope, he realized
Some things we cannot know.

Today, they closed his one good eye, 
As nature planned, he died; 
Could he with two good eyes have seen, 
What is on the other siplease dropp that ppleonastic p! 

Suppose your spelling, dropp by dropp
ran PCs short, all crashing, *lo*, 
and *oets had to write their *oetry
without the strength to hold  their *! 

It could reduce dear England's language
and cause considerable *oetic anguish
(and by 'England's language', AJS, 
I do not mean.  well, you can guess. )  

Would Doctor Nerd-like surgery
help remove that extrusive *? 
'twould be a cut to *lease any Aryan
but all things considered, humanitarian. 

As old men (meta*horically)  
suffer so unsociably, 
from all too frequent need to wee, 
restrain your  *C's  excess  *! 

Overuse could be averse
to *oets' *oems, or verse - or worse; 
and *arekh's generous realm of dreams
would be reduced by reams and reams. 

*oemhunter's world-wide error
could set the *undits cold with terror -
like *ublic toilets when overused, 
*lease to mind your *'s and queues! 

so *oemhunter, I dropp this *lea: 
*lease take care just where you *

I make a pact with you, Walt Whitman - 
I have detested you long enough.
I come to you as a grown child
Who has had a pig-headed father;
I am old enough now to make friends.
It was you that broke the new wood,
Now is a time for carving.
We have one sap and one root - 
Let there be commerce between us. 

How shall the burial rite be read? 
The solemn song be sung? 
The requiem for the loveliest dead,
That ever died so young? 

II.

Her friends are gazing on her,
And on her gaudy bier,
And weep! - oh! to dishonor
Dead beauty with a tear! 

III.

They loved her for her wealth -
And they hated her for her pride -
But she grew in feeble health,
And they love her - that she died.

IV.

They tell me (while they speak
Of her 'costly broider'd pall') 
That my voice is growing weak -
That I should not sing at all -

V.

Or that my tone should be
Tun'd to such solemn song
So mournfully - so mournfully,
That the dead may feel no wrong.

VI.

But she is gone above,
With young Hope at her side,
And I am drunk with love
Of the dead, who is my bride. -

VII.

Of the dead - dead who lies
All perfum'd there,
With the death upon her eyes,
And the life upon her hair.

VIII.

Thus on the coffin loud and long
I strike - the murmur sent
Through the grey chambers to my song,
Shall be the accompaniment.

IX.

Thou died'st in thy life's June -
But thou did'st not die too fair:
Thou did'st not die too soon,
Nor with too calm an air.

X.

From more than fiends on earth,
Thy life and love are riven,
To join the untainted mirth
Of more than thrones in heaven -

XII.

Therefore, to thee this night
I will no requiem raise,
But waft thee on thy flight,
With a Paean of old days. 

Written for "The Pageant of Parliament," Like Princes crowned they bore them--
When the New World lay before them
In headlong fact and thought. 
Fate and their foemen proved them
Above all meed of praise,
And Gloriana loved them,
And Shakespeare wrote them plays!
. . . . . . .
Now Valour, Youth, and Life's delight break forth
In flames of wondrous deed, and thought sublime---
Lightly to mould new worlds or lightly loose
Words that shall shake and shape all after-time!

Giants with giants, wits with wits engage,
And England-England-England takes the breath
Of morning, body and soul, till the great Age
Fulfills in one great chord:--Elizabeth

Noiseless break of nerves
You find many life curves
Little you speak but
Never you speak it.

Try is what you try
To feel free as tree
Tree of forest and street
Free at one lonely at another.

Expressing it is never done
Till the date I swear never
Everything happens patiently
Indeed happens noiseless.

Blood and breath, life and death
Hi and hello, bye and good bye
Gets one and becomes two
Me and myself


I look at him. 
I look at him everyday. 
Never did he look at me, 
Never did he look my way, 
He looked over me, 
Above me, 
Next to me, 
Never in my eyes. 
All I wondered was what could I do, 
What have I done to you. 

I was there everyday, 
Why, 
Oh, 
Why won't he look. 
It seemed funny to me, 
The good old boy looked at many other girls, 
Oh, lord, why not me? 

I'm nice looking, 
At least that is what I thought, 
Maybe, it isn't my fault. 
I'll try one more time, 
I know what will work, 
Oh, I would just die, 
For just a look! 

This morning I figured it would be different, 
I will get him to look, 
I know what will do the trick, 
I will open my eyes when I shave, 
Maybe this way, 
My reflection will have its way. 

You packed two suitcases
And you left without uttering a word.
This is worse than plunging a sword
Deep in my aorta. You left the premises, 
For no apparent reasons. 'On what basis? '
I ask myself: ' Why behave like a beast? '

I have been at the windows, 
For innumerable hours.
I am like a sick puppy, 
A homeless cat lost a sea.
I am perturbed and confused.
I am incarcerated and abused.

I am searching everywhere, 
And praying that a gush of fresh air
Will enter your brain, so you'll return home, 
Where you are happy, under the foam
Of our Jacuzzi, with your sweetheart.

Please comeback to retrieve that painful dart.

The hours of the night have been long.
I long to see you again. The song
Is oddly morbid. The stress is horrendous.
I am lost in the desert of my own consciousness, 
Without venturing outside, or moving a limb.
I am honestly scared like a lonely lamb


If I became crippeled or maimed
Would I have your love or just your pity? 
Would you cherish and take care of me? 
Or  would you put me in a nursing home? 

And go on with your life, as if I never existed
I would never want your,  pity only your love
If I should ever become that way, just let me die
Your love so cruel, hardly ever a touch

In my time of need, when I love you so much
You turn away from me, as if a polite stranger
But it must be love, because I feel no danger
You don't beat me or abuse me, so it's got to be love

There is no tenderness or any understanding
Just day to day living as two polite strangers
I love you I do, my heart beats only for you
Is our love just so hopeless or is there a chance

That we can find our way back to each other again
Sleeping in the same bed so lonely and cold
If loneliness could kill I'd already be dead
Am I not worthy of your love as i once was? 

You break my heart over and over again
You can't even see the pain I endure
The pain of the awful silence when we are together
Can't talk to you all alone with my pain

You say if you didn't love me, I wouldn't be here
But if I left I wouldn't be missed or looked for
My heart is dying inside, and you can't even see
So once more I love for nothing in return

Why do I try so hard to make you love me? 
So i'll not leave, live without love just companionship
I'll pretend everythings ok, and love won't matter anymore
You didn't even know when I died inside

Going through the motions of acting alive
I feel such great pain over so much from the past
You can't see the many scars I carry inside
You weren't there, their buried deep in my mind

I don't blame you if you don't want to love me
I wouldn't want to love me either

Life is a painful reminder
Where I went on my own
To start my journey
But met disappointments along the way
For time eluded me
And I had to sacrifice myself 
My vision and beauty of the happiness that existed.

There I continued to make changes
And took small baby steps
To deal with tricky situations
And played bigger roles
To listen to my whispers of the heart
And fill the hollowness of my soul
And recollect the overwhelming scatters of my life. 

To get back the control 
Of every aspect of life
So I could set myself free to move on
And get away far very far
Where I don't have to give up
Or hear the painful reminder
Or the forgotten whisper.   

She was ripped
She was raped

She was throttled with dog chain
She cried in pain

She was sexually abused
But nobody rescued

She landed in coma
After this horrible trauma

She was neither dead nor alive
A normal life she was deprived

And the assaulter, where is he? 
Oh!  he served few years in prison and then walked free

That was yrs ago my dear
Today after yrs, we still live in fear

How much have we grown in terms of maturity
In terms of respect for women and their security

Nothing has changed
We still find men who are hungry and strange

Our girls bled then
Our girls still bleed

The cunning men even today force their claws
& We happily abide and follow our fantastic Indian laws

I saw a pair of swans 
Streak across the azure sky, 
A story of love and beauty
Being scripted in the heavens high. 

The birds flew away gracefully
Beyond my thirsty eyes reach,         
I thought I read a compendium of love
From this unexpected treat.

Some little while ago, I had a mood
When what we know as 'Nature' seemed to me
So sympathetic, ample, sweet, and good
That I preferred it to Society.

Not for a season, be it understood,
But altogether and perpetually.
As far as feeling went, I thought I could
Be quit of men, live independently.

For men and minds, heart-humours and heart's-tease
Disturbed without exciting: whereas woods,
The seasonal changes, and the chanting seas
Were both soul-rousing and sense-lulling. Moods,

Such moods prolonged, became a mania.
I found the stark stretch of a bleak-blown moor
Least barren of all places. Mere extranca
Seemed populace and town: things to ignore.

But if the sovereign sun I might behold
With condescension coming down benign,
And blessing all the field and air with gold,
Then the contentment of the world was mine.

In secret deserts where the night was nude
And each excited star grew ardent-eyed,
I tasted more than this life's plenitude,
And far as farthest stars perceive, I spied.

Once, when the whiteness of the spectral moon
Had terrorized the creatures of the wold,
When that long staring of the glazed-eyed
Had stupefied the land and made it cold,

I fell seduced into a madness; for,
Forgetting in that night the life of days,
I said I had no need of fellows more,
I madly hated men and all their ways.

I hated, feeling hated; I supposed
That others did not need me any more.
The book of human knowledge I then closed;
Passion, art, science? Trifles to ignore.

But in my error, men ignored not me,
And did not let me in my moonbeams bask.
And I took antidotes; though what they be
Unless yourself be poisoned, do not ask.

For I am overdosed. The City now
Holds all my passion; these my soul most feels:
Crowds surging; racket of traffic; market row;
Bridges, sonorous under rapid wheels;

Pacific lamentations of a bell;
The smoking of the old men at their doors;
All attitudes of children; the farewell
And casting-off of ships for far-off shores. 

A single fir-tree, lonely,
on a northern mountain height,
sleeps in a white blanket,
draped in snow and ice.
 
His dreams are of a palm-tree,
who, far in eastern lands,
weeps, all alone and silent,
among the burning sands. 

Resolved my gratitude to show,
Thrice reverend Dean, for all I owe,
Too long I have my thanks delay'd;
Your favours left too long unpaid;
But now, in all our sex's name,
My artless Muse shall sing your fame.
Indulgent you to female kind,
To all their weaker sides are blind:
Nine more such champions as the Dean
Would soon restore our ancient reign;
How well to win the ladies' hearts,
You celebrate their wit and parts!
How have I felt my spirits raised,
By you so oft, so highly praised!
Transform'd by your convincing tongue
To witty, beautiful, and young,
I hope to quit that awkward shame,
Affected by each vulgar dame,
To modesty a weak pretence;
And soon grow pert on men of sense;
To show my face with scornful air;
Let others match it if they dare.
Impatient to be out of debt,
O, may I never once forget
The bard who humbly deigns to chuse
Me for the subject of his Muse!
Behind my back, before my nose,
He sounds my praise in verse and prose.
My heart with emulation burns,
To make you suitable returns;
My gratitude the world shall know;
And see, the printer's boy below;
Ye hawkers all, your voices lift;
'A Panegyric on Dean Swift!'
And then, to mend the matter still,
'By Lady Anne of Market-Hill!'
I thus begin: My grateful Muse
Salutes the Dean in different views;
Dean, butler, usher, jester, tutor;
Robert and Darby's coadjutor;
And, as you in commission sit,
To rule the dairy next to Kit;
In each capacity I mean
To sing your praise. And first as Dean:
Envy must own, you understand your
Precedence, and support your grandeur:
Nor of your rank will bate an ace,
Except to give Dean Daniel place.
In you such dignity appears,
So suited to your state and years!
With ladies what a strict decorum!
With what devotion you adore 'em!
Treat me with so much complaisance,
As fits a princess in romance!
By your example and assistance,
The fellows learn to know their distance.
Sir Arthur, since you set the pattern,
No longer calls me snipe and slattern,
Proceed we to your preaching next!
How nice you split the hardest text!
How your superior learning shines
Above our neighbouring dull divines!
At Beggar's Opera not so full pit
Is seen as when you mount our pulpit.
Consider now your conversation:
Regardful of your age and station,
You ne'er were known by passion stirr'd
To give the least offensive word:
But still, whene'er you silence break,
Watch every syllable you speak:
Your style so clear, and so concise,
We never ask to hear you twice.
But then a parson so genteel,
So nicely clad from head to heel;
So fine a gown, a band so clean,
As well become St. Patrick's Dean,
Such reverential awe express,
That cowboys know you by your dress!
Then, if our neighbouring friends come here
How proud are we when you appear,
With such address and graceful port,
As clearly shows you bred at court!
Now raise your spirits, Mr. Dean,
I lead you to a nobler scene.
When to the vault you walk in state,
In quality of butler's mate;
You next to Dennis bear the sway:
To you we often trust the key:
Nor can he judge with all his art
So well, what bottle holds a quart:
What pints may best for bottles pass
Just to give every man his glass:
When proper to produce the best;
And what may serve a common guest.
With Dennis you did ne'er combine,
Not you, to steal your master's wine,
Except a bottle now and then,
To welcome brother serving-men;
But that is with a good design,
To drink Sir Arthur's health and mine,
Your master's honour to maintain:
And get the like returns again.
Your usher's post must next be handled:
How blest am I by such a man led!
Under whose wise and careful guardship
I now despise fatigue and hardship,
Familiar grown to dirt and wet,
Though draggled round, I scorn to fret:
From you my chamber damsels learn
My broken hose to patch and darn.
Now as a jester I accost you;
Which never yet one friend has lost you.
You judge so nicely to a hair,
How far to go, and when to spare;
By long experience grown so wise,
Of every taste to know the size;
There's none so ignorant or weak
To take offence at what you speak.
Whene'er you joke, 'tis all a case
Whether with Dermot, or his grace;
With Teague O'Murphy, or an earl;
A duchess, or a kitchen girl.
With such dexterity you fit
Their several talents with your wit,
That Moll the chambermaid can smoke,
And Gahagan take every joke.
I now become your humble suitor
To let me praise you as my tutor.
Poor I, a savage bred and born,
By you instructed every morn,
Already have improved so well,
That I have almost learnt to spell:
The neighbours who come here to dine,
Admire to hear me speak so fine.
How enviously the ladies look,
When they surprise me at my book!
And sure as they're alive at night,
As soon as gone will show their spight:
Good lord! what can my lady mean,
Conversing with that rusty Dean!
She's grown so nice, and so penurious,
With Socrates and Epicurius!
How could she sit the livelong day,
Yet never ask us once to play?
But I admire your patience most;
That when I'm duller than a post,
Nor can the plainest word pronounce,
You neither fume, nor fret, nor flounce;
Are so indulgent, and so mild,
As if I were a darling child.
So gentle is your whole proceeding,
That I could spend my life in reading.
You merit new employments daily:
Our thatcher, ditcher, gardener, baily.
And to a genius so extensive
No work is grievous or offensive:
Whether your fruitful fancy lies
To make for pigs convenient styes;
Or ponder long with anxious thought
To banish rats that haunt our vault:
Nor have you grumbled, reverend Dean,
To keep our poultry sweet and clean;
To sweep the mansion-house they dwell in,
And cure the rank unsavoury smelling.
Now enter as the dairy handmaid:
Such charming butter never man made.
Let others with fanatic face
Talk of their milk for babes of grace;
From tubs their snuffling nonsense utter;
Thy milk shall make us tubs of butter.
The bishop with his foot may burn it,
But with his hand the Dean can churn it.
How are the servants overjoy'd
To see thy deanship thus employ'd!
Instead of poring on a book,
Providing butter for the cook!
Three morning hours you toss and shake
The bottle till your fingers ache;
Hard is the toil, nor small the art,
The butter from the whey to part:
Behold a frothy substance rise;
Be cautious or your bottle flies.
The butter comes, our fears are ceased;
And out you squeeze an ounce at least.
Your reverence thus, with like success,
(Nor is your skill or labour less,)
When bent upon some smart lampoon,
Will toss and turn your brain till noon;
Which in its jumblings round the skull,
Dilates and makes the vessel full:
While nothing comes but froth at first,
You think your giddy head will burst;
But squeezing out four lines in rhyme,
Are largely paid for all your time.
But you have raised your generous mind
To works of more exalted kind.
Palladio was not half so skill'd in
The grandeur or the art of building.
Two temples of magnific size
Attract the curious traveller's eyes,
That might be envied by the Greeks;
Raised up by you in twenty weeks:
Here gentle goddess Cloacine
Receives all offerings at her shrine.
In separate cells, the he's and she's,
Here pay their vows on bended knees:
For 'tis profane when sexes mingle,
And every nymph must enter single;
And when she feels an inward motion,
Come fill'd with reverence and devotion.
The bashful maid, to hide her blush,
Shall creep no more behind a bush;
Here unobserved she boldly goes,
As who should say, to pluck a rose,
Ye, who frequent this hallow'd scene,
Be not ungrateful to the Dean;
But duly, ere you leave your station,
Offer to him a pure libation,
Or of his own or Smedley's lay,
Or billet-doux, or lock of hay:
And, O! may all who hither come,
Return with unpolluted thumb!
Yet, when your lofty domes I praise
I sigh to think of ancient days.
Permit me then to raise my style,
And sweetly moralize a-while.
Thee, bounteous goddess Cloacine,
To temples why do we confine?
Forbid in open air to breathe,
Why are thine altars fix'd beneath?
When Saturn ruled the skies alone,
(That golden age to gold unknown,)
This earthly globe, to thee assign'd,
Received the gifts of all mankind.
Ten thousand altars smoking round,
Were built to thee with offerings crown'd;
And here thy daily votaries placed
Their sacrifice with zeal and haste:
The margin of a purling stream
Sent up to thee a grateful steam;
Though sometimes thou wert pleased to wink,
If Naiads swept them from the brink:
Or where appointing lovers rove,
The shelter of a shady grove;
Or offer'd in some flowery vale,
Were wafted by a gentle gale,
There many a flower abstersive grew,
Thy favourite flowers of yellow hue;
The crocus and the daffodil,
The cowslip soft, and sweet jonquil.
But when at last usurping Jove
Old Saturn from his empire drove,
Then gluttony, with greasy paws
Her napkin pinn'd up to her jaws,
With watery chops, and wagging chin,
Braced like a drum her oily skin;
Wedged in a spacious elbow-chair,
And on her plate a treble share,
As if she ne'er could have enough,
Taught harmless man to cram and stuff.
She sent her priests in wooden shoes
From haughty Gaul to make ragouts;
Instead of wholesome bread and cheese,
To dress their soups and fricassees;
And, for our home-bred British cheer,
Botargo, catsup, and caviare.
This bloated harpy, sprung from hell,
Confined thee, goddess, to a cell:
Sprung from her womb that impious line,
Contemners of thy rites divine.
First, lolling Sloth, in woollen cap,
Taking her after-dinner nap:
Pale Dropsy, with a sallow face,
Her belly burst, and slow her pace:
And lordly Gout, wrapt up in fur,
And wheezing Asthma, loth to stir:
Voluptuous Ease, the child of wealth,
Infecting thus our hearts by stealth.
None seek thee now in open air,
To thee no verdant altars rear;
But, in their cells and vaults obscene,
Present a sacrifice unclean;
From whence unsavoury vapours rose,
Offensive to thy nicer nose.
Ah! who, in our degenerate days,
As nature prompts, his offering pays?
Here nature never difference made
Between the sceptre and the spade.
Ye great ones, why will ye disdain
To pay your tribute on the plain?
Why will you place in lazy pride
Your altars near your couches' side:
When from the homeliest earthen ware
Are sent up offerings more sincere,
Than where the haughty duchess locks
Her silver vase in cedar box?
Yet some devotion still remains
Among our harmless northern swains,
Whose offerings, placed in golden ranks,
Adorn our crystal rivers' banks;
Nor seldom grace the flowery downs,
With spiral tops and copple crowns;
Or gilding in a sunny morn
The humble branches of a thorn.
So poets sing, with golden bough
The Trojan hero paid his vow.
Hither, by luckless error led,
The crude consistence oft I tread;
Here when my shoes are out of case,
Unweeting gild the tarnish'd lace;
Here, by the sacred bramble tinged,
My petticoat is doubly fringed.
Be witness for me, nymph divine,
I never robb'd thee with design;
Nor will the zealous Hannah pout
To wash thy injured offering out.
But stop, ambitious Muse, in time,
Nor dwell on subjects too sublime.
In vain on lofty heels I tread,
Aspiring to exalt my head;
With hoop expanded wide and light,
In vain I 'tempt too high a flight.
Me Phoebus in a midnight dream 
Accosting, said, 'Go shake your cream 
Be humbly-minded, know your post;
Sweeten your tea, and watch your toast.
Thee best befits a lowly style;
Teach Dennis how to stir the guile;
With Peggy Dixon thoughtful sit,
Contriving for the pot and spit.
Take down thy proudly swelling sails,
And rub thy teeth and pare thy nails;
At nicely carving show thy wit;
But ne'er presume to eat a bit:
Turn every way thy watchful eye,
And every guest be sure to ply:
Let never at your board be known
An empty plate, except your own.
Be these thy arts; nor higher aim
Than what befits a rural dame.
'But Cloacina, goddess bright,
Sleek——claims her as his right;
And Smedley, flower of all divines,
Shall sing the Dean in Smedley's lines.

'Till I shall come again, let this suffice,
I send my salt, my sacrifice
To thee, thy lady, younglings, and as far
As to thy Genius and thy Lar;
To the worn threshold, porch, hall, parlour, kitchen,
The fat-fed smoking temple, which in
The wholesome savour of thy mighty chines,
Invites to supper him who dines:
Where laden spits, warp'd with large ribs of beef,
Not represent, but give relief
To the lank stranger and the sour swain,
Where both may feed and come again;
For no black-bearded Vigil from thy door
Beats with a button'd-staff the poor;
But from thy warm love-hatching gates, each may
Take friendly morsels, and there stay
To sun his thin-clad members, if he likes;
For thou no porter keep'st who strikes.
No comer to thy roof his guest-rite wants;
Or, staying there, is scourged with taunts
Of some rough groom, who, yirk'd with corns, says, 'Sir,
'You've dipp'd too long i' th' vinegar;
'And with our broth and bread and bits, Sir friend,
'You've fared well; pray make an end;
'Two days you've larded here; a third, ye know,
'Makes guests and fish smell strong; pray go
'You to some other chimney, and there take
'Essay of other giblets; make
'Merry at another's hearth; you're here
'Welcome as thunder to our beer;
'Manners knows distance, and a man unrude
'Would soon recoil, and not intrude
'His stomach to a second meal.'--No, no,
Thy house, well fed and taught, can show
No such crabb'd vizard:  Thou hast learnt thy train
With heart and hand to entertain;
And by the arms-full, with a breast unhid,
As the old race of mankind did,
When either's heart, and either's hand did strive
To be the nearer relative;
Thou dost redeem those times:  and what was lost
Of ancient honesty, may boast
It keeps a growth in thee, and so will run
A course in thy fame's pledge, thy son.
Thus, like a Roman Tribune, thou thy gate
Early sets ope to feast, and late;
Keeping no currish waiter to affright,
With blasting eye, the appetite,
Which fain would waste upon thy cates, but that
The trencher creature marketh what
Best and more suppling piece he cuts, and by
Some private pinch tells dangers nigh,
A hand too desp'rate, or a knife that bites
Skin-deep into the pork, or lights
Upon some part of kid, as if mistook,
When checked by the butler's look.
No, no, thy bread, thy wine, thy jocund beer
Is not reserved for Trebius here,
But all who at thy table seated are,
Find equal freedom, equal fare;
And thou, like to that hospitable god,
Jove, joy'st when guests make their abode
To eat thy bullocks thighs, thy veals, thy fat
Wethers, and never grudged at.
The pheasant, partridge, gotwit, reeve, ruff, rail,
The cock, the curlew, and the quail,
These, and thy choicest viands, do extend
Their tastes unto the lower end
Of thy glad table; not a dish more known
To thee, than unto any one:
But as thy meat, so thy immortal wine
Makes the smirk face of each to shine,
And spring fresh rose-buds, while the salt, the wit,
Flows from the wine, and graces it;
While Reverence, waiting at the bashful board,
Honours my lady and my lord.
No scurril jest, no open scene is laid
Here, for to make the face afraid;
But temp'rate mirth dealt forth, and so discreet-
Ly, that it makes the meat more sweet,
And adds perfumes unto the wine, which thou
Dost rather pour forth, than allow
By cruse and measure; thus devoting wine,
As the Canary isles were thine;
But with that wisdom and that method, as
No one that's there his guilty glass
Drinks of distemper, or has cause to cry
Repentance to his liberty.
No, thou know'st orders, ethics, and hast read
All oeconomics, know'st to lead
A house-dance neatly, and canst truly show
How far a figure ought to go,
Forward or backward, side-ward, and what pace
Can give, and what retract a grace;
What gesture, courtship, comeliness agrees,
With those thy primitive decrees,
To give subsistence to thy house, and proof
What Genii support thy roof,
Goodness and greatness, not the oaken piles;
For these, and marbles have their whiles
To last, but not their ever; virtue's hand
It is which builds 'gainst fate to stand.
Such is thy house, whose firm foundations trust
Is more in thee than in her dust,
Or depth; these last may yield, and yearly shrink,
When what is strongly built, no chink
Or yawning rupture can the same devour,
But fix'd it stands, by her own power
And well-laid bottom, on the iron and rock,
Which tries, and counter-stands the shock
And ram of time, and by vexation grows
The stronger.  Virtue dies when foes
Are wanting to her exercise, but, great
And large she spreads by dust and sweat.
Safe stand thy walls, and thee, and so both will,
Since neither's height was raised by th'ill
Of others; since no stud, no stone, no piece
Was rear'd up by the poor-man's fleece;
No widow's tenement was rack'd to gild
Or fret thy cieling, or to build
A sweating-closet, to anoint the silk-
Soft skin, or bath[e] in asses' milk;
No orphan's pittance, left him, served to set
The pillars up of lasting jet,
For which their cries might beat against thine ears,
Or in the damp jet read their tears.
No plank from hallow'd altar does appeal
To yond' Star-chamber, or does seal
A curse to thee, or thine; but all things even
Make for thy peace, and pace to heaven.
--Go on directly so, as just men may
A thousand times more swear, than say
This is that princely Pemberton, who can
And when wise poets shall search out to see
Good men, they find them all in thee. 

A Pang is more conspicuous in Spring
In contrast with the things that sing
Not Birds entirely -  but Minds - 
Minute Effulgencies and Winds - 
When what they sung for is undone
Who cares about a Blue Bird's Tune - 
Why, Resurrection had to wait
Till they had moved a Stone -I love order, 
Writing my future plans, 
On a piece of paper map.

How much time, 
Does my strenght need to spend, 
To accomplish those dreams.

A paper plan, 
A matter of balance. 

A paper soul
An empty hole
Left out in the pouring rain
Now soaked
These bitter feelings of regret
These painful feelings of neglect

And still I’m crawling
Through the shades
Of empty corridors of memories
Reminiscing all the times

No tears to cry
No face to hide
A mask of pride for my disguise
And a robe of luck
To fit into the crowd

With sense of guilt
And a sinful sight
A lonely soul out in the rain
Another victim of the flood
Another failed romance


BETWEEN the sandhills and the sea 
A narrow strip of silver sand, 
Whereon a little maid doth stand, 
Who picks up shells continually 
Between the sandhills and the sea. 

Far as her wondering eyes can reach 
A Vastness, heaving grey in grey 
To the frayed edges where the day 
Furls his red standard on the breach, 
Between the skyline and the beach. 

The waters of the flowing tide 
Cast up the seapink shells and weed; 
She toys with shells, and doth not heed 
The ocean, which on every side 
Is closing round her vast and wide. 

It creeps her way as if in play, 
Pink shells at her pink feet to cast; 
But now the wild waves hold her fast, 
And bear her off and melt away 
A Vastness heaving gray in gray. 

The church bells were ringing, the devil sat singing
On the stump of a rotting old tree;
'Oh faith it grows cold, and the creeds they grow old,
And the world is nigh ready for me.'

The bells went on ringing, a spirit came singing,
And smiled as he crumbled the tree;
'Yon wood does but perish new seedlings to cherish,
And the world is too live yet for thee.'


Eversley,  

I am standing upon the seashore.
A ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze
and starts for the blue ocean.

She is an object of beauty and strength,
and I stand and watch until at last she hangs
like a speck of white cloud
just where the sea and sky come down to mingle with each other.
Then someone at my side says,
' There she goes! '

Gone where? 

Gone from my sight.  that is all.

She is just as large in mast and hull and spar
as she was when she left my side
and just as able to bear her load of living freight
to the place of destination.

Her diminished size is in me, not in her.

And just at the moment
when someone at my side says,
' There she goes! '
there are other eyes watching her coming. 
and other voices ready to take up the glad shout. 

' Here she comes! '
And that is dying. 

A proud young Osprey stands on the top rung 
of the tall satellite tower; perched and guarding 
his family’s nest. Spring has brought his migrational return 
just as it had done with his father and his father’s father 
before him. A strong southwest wind carries his screeching; 
five crows in a distant tree take heed of his nervous nature.
While directly below the Osprey’s post in the parking lot, 
a clot of new grass breaks through a crack in the asphalt
and a rodent eats its last meal

All life and death is just a process of trial and error


But careful dive along bow bends, 
Trivial anticlimactic stances 
Breed carking differences

World cascades in future 
The young grows up in age
Doesn’t have to wait too long
Dichotomy picked up with a tong

Eccentric eclectic wits 
Insinuate egotistical thoughts 
Myopia bothers any swap
Slipup in a surly wrap

Angst-ridden fronts
Denigrate each other
Words, attitude, feeling, love 
Transcend the paradigm.

So surreal an avant garde

The deluge will carry us all-
Towards many paradigm shift


Is this a life, to break thy sleep,
To rise as soon as day doth peep?
To tire thy patient ox or ass
By noon, and let thy good days pass,
Not knowing this, that Jove decrees
Some mirth, t' adulce man's miseries?
--No; 'tis a life to have thine oil
Without extortion from thy soil;
Thy faithful fields to yield thee grain,
Although with some, yet little pain;
To have thy mind, and nuptial bed,
With fears and cares uncumbered
A pleasing wife, that by thy side
Lies softly panting like a bride;
--This is to live, and to endear
Those minutes Time has lent us here.
Then, while fates suffer, live thou free,
As is that air that circles thee;
And crown thy temples too; and let
Thy servant, not thy own self, sweat,
To strut thy barns with sheaves of wheat.
--Time steals away like to a stream,
And we glide hence away with them:
No sound recalls the hours once fled,
Or roses, being withered;
Nor us, my friend, when we are lost,
Like to a dew, or melted frost.
--Then live we mirthful while we should,
And turn the iron age to gold;
Let's feast and frolic, sing and play,
And thus less last, than live our day.
Whose life with care is overcast,
That man's not said to live, but last;
Nor is't a life, seven years to tell,
But for to live that half seven well;
And that we'll do, as men who know,
Some few sands spent, we hence must go,
Both to be blended in the urn,
From whence there's never a return. 

Sometimes I think 'at Parents does
Things ist about as bad as _us_--

Wite 'fore our vurry eyes, at that!
Fer one time Pa he scold' my Ma
'Cause he can't find his hat;
An' she ist _cried_, she did! An' I
Says, 'Ef you scold my Ma
Ever again an' make her cry,
Wy, you sha'n't _be_ my Pa!'
An' nen he laugh' an' find his hat
Ist wite where Ma she said it's at

Thou happy, happy elf!
(But stop,—first let me kiss away that tear—)
Thou tiny image of myself!
(My love, he's poking peas into his ear!)
Thou merry, laughing sprite!
With spirits feather-light,
Untouched by sorrow, and unsoiled by sin;
(Good Heavens! the child is swallowing a pin!)

Thou little tricksy Puck!
With antic toys so funnily bestuck,
Light as the singing bird that wings the air;
(The door! the door! he'll tumble down the stair!)
Thou darling of thy sire!
(Why, Jane, he'll set his pinafore afire!)
Thou imp of mirth and joy!
In love's dear chain, so strong and bright a link,
Thou idol of thy parents; (Drat the boy!
There goes my ink!)

Thou cherub—but of earth;
Fit playfellow for Fays, by moonlight pale,
In harmless sport and myrth,
(That dog will bite him if he pulls its tail!)
Thou human hummingbee, extracting honey
From every blossom in the world that blows,
Singing in youth's elysium ever sunny,
(Another tumble!—that's his precious nose!)

Thy father's pride and hope!
(He'll break the mirror with that skipping-rope!)
With pure heart newly stamped from Nature's mint;
(Where did he learn that squint!)
Thou young domestic dove!
(He'll have that jug off with another shove!)
Dear nursling of the Hymeneal nest!
(Are those torn clothes his best?)
Little epitome of man!
(He'll climb upon the table, that's his plan!)
Touched with the beauteous tints of dawning life
(He's got a knife!)

Thou enviable being!
No storms, no clouds, in thy blue sky foreseeing,
Play on, play on,
My elfin John!
Toss the light ball—bestride the stick—
(I knew so many cakes would make him sick!)
With fancies, buoyant as the thistle-down,
Prompting the face grotesque, and antic brisk,
With many a lamb-like frisk,
(He's got the scissors, snipping at your gown!)

Thou pretty opening rose!
(Go to your mother, child, and wipe your nose!)
Balmy and breathing music like the South,
(He really brings my heart into my mouth!)
Fresh as the morn, and brilliant as its star,
(I wish that window had an iron bar!)
Bold as the hawk, yet gentle as the dove;
(I'll tell you what, my love,
I cannot write unless he's sent above!)Lazy-bones, lazy-bones, wake up and peep;
The Cat's in the cupboard, your Mother's asleep.
There you sit snoring, forgetting her ills:
Who is to give her her Bolus and Pills?
Twenty-five Angels must come into Town,
All for to help you to make your new gown-
Dainty aerial Spinsters & Singers:
Aren't you asham'd to employ such white fingers?
Delicate Hands, unaccustom'd to reels,
To set 'em a washing at poor body's wheels?
Why they came down is to me all a riddle,
And left hallelujah broke off in the middle.
Jove's Court & the Presence Angelical cut,
To eke out the work of a lazy young slut.
Angel-duck, angel-duck, winged & silly,
Pouring a watering pot over a lily,
Gardener gratuitous, careless of pelf,
Leave her to water her Lily herself,
Or to neglect it to death, if she chuse it;
Remember, the loss is her own if she lose it. 

When first, Philander, first I came
Where Avon rolls his winding stream,
The nymphs, how brisk, the swains, how gay,
The parsons round her praises sung!
The steeples with her praises rung!-
I thought no sight that e'er was seen
Could match the sight of Barel's Green!

But now, since old Eugenio died-
The chief of poets, and the pride-
Now, meaner bards in vain aspire
To raise their voice, to tune their lyre!
Their lovely season now is o'er;
Thy notes, Florelio, please no more!
Nor more Asteria's smiles are seen-
Adieu!-the sweets of Barel's Green

Life is real, life is earnest, 
And the shell is not its pen –
"Egg thou art, and egg remainest"
Was not spoken of the hen.

Art is long and Time is fleeting, 
Be our bills then sharpened well, 
And not like muffled drums be beating
On the inside of the shell.

In the world’s broad field of battle, 
In the great barnyard of life, 
Be not like those lazy cattle! 
Be a rooster in the strife! 

Lives of roosters all remind us, 
We can make our lives sublime, 
And when roasted, leave behind us, 
Hen tracks on the sands of time.

Hen tracks that perhaps another
Chicken drooping in the rain, 
Some forlorn and henpecked brother, 
When he sees, shall crow again. 

They said 'Too late, too late, the work is done;
Great Homer sang of glory and strong men
And that fair Greek whose fault all these long
years
Wins no forgetfulness nor ever can;
For yet cold eyes upon her frailty bend,
For yet the world waits in the victor's tent
Daily, and sees an old man honourable,
His white head bowed, surprise to passionate tears
Awestruck Achilles; sighing, 'I have endured,
The like whereof no soul hath yet endured,
To kiss the hand of him that slew my son.''

They said: 'We, rich by him, are rich by more;
One Aeschylus found watchfires on a hill
That lit Old Night's three daughters to their work;
When the forlorn Fate leaned to their red light
And sat a-spinning, to her feet he came
And marked her till she span off all her thread.

'O, it is late, good sooth, to cry for more:
The work once done, well done,' they said, 'forbear!
A Tuscan afterward discovered steps
Over the line of life in its mid-way;
He climbed the wall of Heaven, beheld his love
Safe at her singing, and he left his foes
In a vale of shadow weltering, unassoiled
Immortal sufferers henceforth in both worlds.

'Who may inherit next or who shall match
The Swan of Avon and go float with him
Down the long river of life aneath a sun
Not veiled, and high at noon?—the river of life
That as it ran reflected all its lapse
And rippling on the plumage of his breast?

'Thou hast them, heed them, for thy poets now,
Albeit of tongue full sweet and majesty
Like even to theirs, are fallen on evil days,
Are wronged by thee of life, wronged of the world.
Look back they must and show thee thy fair past,
Or, choosing thy to-day, they may but chant
As they behold.

         'The mother-glowworm broods
Upon her young, fast-folded in the egg
And long before they come to life they shine—
The mother-age broods on her shining thought
That liveth, but whose life is hid. He comes
Her poet son, and lo you, he can see
The shining, and he takes it to his breast
And fashions for it wings that it may fly
And show its sweet light in the dusky world.

'Mother, O Mother of our dusk to-day,
What hast thou lived for bards to sing of thee?
Lapsed water cannot flow above its source;
'The kid must browse,'' they said, ''where she is tied.''

Son of to-day, rise up, and answer them.
What! wilt thou let thy mother sit ashamed
And crownless?—Set the crown on her fair head:
She waited for thy birth, she cries to thee
'Thou art the man.' He that hath ears to hear,
To him the mother cries 'Thou art the man.'

She murmurs, for thy mother's voice is low—
'Methought the men of war were even as gods
The old men of the ages. Now mine eyes
Retrieve the truth from ruined city walls
That buried it; from carved and curious homes
Full of rich garments and all goodly spoil,
Where having burned, battered, and wasted them,
They flung it. Give us, give us better gods
Than these that drink with blood upon their hands,
For I repent me that I worshipped them.
O that there might be yet a going up!
O to forget—and to begin again!'

Is not thy mother's rede at one with theirs
Who cry 'The work is done'? What though to thee,
Thee only, should the utterance shape itself
'O to forget, and to begin again,'
Only of thee be heard as that keen cry
Rending its way from some distracted heart
That yields it and so breaks? Yet list the cry
Begin for her again, and learn to sing;
But first, in all thy learning learn to be.
Is life a field? then plough it up—re-sow
With worthier seed—Is life a ship? O heed
The southing of thy stars—Is life a breath?
Breathe deeper, draw life up from hour to hour,
Aye, from the deepest deep in thy deep soul.

And fill the abysm with drifts of shining air
That slowly, slowly curdle into worlds.
A little space is measured out to us
Of His long leisure; breathe and grow therein,
For life, alas! is short, and 'When we die
It is not for a little while.'

They said,
'The work is done,' and is it therefore done?
Speak rather to thy mother thus: 'All-fair,
Lady of ages, beautiful To-day
And sorrowful To-day, thy children set
The crown of sorrow on their heads, their loss
Is like to be the loss of all: we hear
Lamenting, as of some that mourn in vain
Loss of high leadership, but where is he
That shall be great enough to lead thee now?
Where is thy Poet? thou hast wanted him.
Where? Thou hast wakened as a child in the night
And found thyself alone. The stars have set,
There is great darkness, and the dark is void
Of music. Who shall set thy life afresh
And sing thee thy new songs? Whom wilt thou love
And lean on to break silence worthily—
Discern the beauty in thy goings—feel
The glory of thy yearning,—thy self-scorn
Matter to dim oblivion with a smile—
Own thy great want, that knew not its great name?
O who shall make to thee mighty amends
For thy lost childhood, joining two in one,
Thyself and Him? Behold Him, He is near:

'A King sang once
Are one. It is thy Poet whom thy hands
Grope for, not knowing. Life is not enough,
Nor love, nor learning,—Death is not enough
Even to them, happy, who forecast new life;
But give us now and satisfy us now,
Give us now, now, to be at one with Him.'

Would I had words—I have not words for her,
Only for thee; and thus I tell them out:
For every man the world is made afresh;
Who call upon Him night, and morn, and night
'Where is the kingdom? Give it us to-day.
Make Thine abode with us, great Wayfarer,
And let our souls sink deeper into Thee'—
There are who send but yearnings forth, in quest
They know not why, of good they know not what.

The unknown life, and strange its stirring is.
The babe knows nought of life, yet clothed in it
And yearning only for its mother's breast
Feeds thus the unheeded thing—and as for thee,
That life thou hast is hidden from thine eyes,
And when it yearns, thou, knowing not for what,
Wouldst fain appease it with one grand, deep joy,
One draught of passionate peace—but wilt thou know
The other name of joy, the better name
Of peace? It is thy Father's name. Thy life

 But 'No,' thou sayest,
'My heart is all in ruins with pain, my feet
Tread a dry desert where there is no way
Nor water. I look back, and deep through time
The old words come but faintly up the track
Trod by the sons of men. The man He sent,
The Prince of life, methinks I could have loved
If I had looked once in His deep man's eyes.
But long ago He died, and long ago
Is gone.'

        He is not dead, He cannot go.
Men's faith at first was like a mastering stream,
Like Jordan 'the descender' leaping down
Pure from his snow; and warmed of tropic heat
Hiding himself in verdure: then at last
In a Dead Sea absorbed, as faith of doubt.
But yet the snow lies thick on Hermon's breast
And daily at his source the stream is born.
Go up—go mark the whiteness of the snow—Thy
Though faith waste fruitless down a desert old.

What need to look behind thee and to sigh?
To draw men after, following up and on;
And thy heart fails because thy feet are slow;
Thou think'st of Him as one that will not wait,
A Father and not wait!—He waited long
For us, and yet perchance He thinks not long
And will not count the time. There are no dates
In His fine leisure.

        Speak then as a son:
'Father, I come to satisfy Thy love
With mine, for I had held Thee as remote,
The background of the stars—Time's yesterday—
Illimitable Absence. Now my heart
Communes, methinks, with somewhat teaching me
It is and yet shall hide. And I have part
In all, for in Thine image I was made,
To Thee my spirit yearns, as Thou to mine.
If aught be stamped of Thy Divine on me,

To fear Thee, though Thy love in visible form
Bled 'neath a thorny crown—but since indeed,
For kindred's sake and likeness, Thou dost thirst
To draw men nigh, and make them one with Thee,
My soul shall answer 'Thou art what I want:

Then straightway flashes up athwart the words:
'And if I be a son I am very far
From my great Father's house; I am not clean.
I have not always willed it should be so,
And the gold of life is rusted with my tears.'

It is enough. He never said to men,
'Seek ye My face in vain.' And have they sought—
Beautiful children, well-beloved sons,
Opening wide eyes to ache among the moons
All night, and sighing because star multitudes
Fainted away as to a glittering haze,
And sparkled here and there like silver wings,
Confounding them with nameless, numberless,
Unbearable, fine flocks? It is not well
For them, for thee. Hast thou gone forth so far
To the unimaginable steeps on high
Cry, cry to Him: 'I cannot search Thee out,
But Thou and I must meet. O come, come down,
Come.' And that cry shall have the mastery.
Ay, He shall come in truth to visit thee,
And thou shalt mourn to Him, 'Unclean, unclean,'
But never more 'I will to have it so.'
From henceforth thou shalt learn that there is love
To long for, pureness to desire, a mount
Of consecration it were good to scale.

Look you, it is to-day as at the first.
When Adam first was 'ware his new-made eyes
And opened them, behold the light! And breath
Whereof they had made his soul. Then he looked forth
And was a part of light; also he saw
Beautiful life, and it could move. But Eve—Eve
was the child of midnight and of sleep.
It may be in the dark she heard him breathe
Nor life but as a voice that left his lips,
A warmth that clasped her; but the stars were out,
And she with wide child-eyes gazed up at them.

Haply she thought that always it was night;
Haply he, whispering to her in that reach
Of beauteous darkness, gave her unworn heart
A rumour of the dawn, and wakened it
To a trembling, and a wonder, and a want
Kin to his own; and as he longed to gaze
On his new fate, the gracious mystery
His wife, she may have longed, and felt not why,
After the light that never she had known.

So doth each age walk in the light beheld,
Nor think on light, if it be light or no;
Then comes the night to it, and in the night
Eve.

Eve. And she is not seen for darkness' sake;
Yet, when she makes her gracious presence felt,
The age perceives how dark it is, and fain,
Fain would have daylight, fain would see her well,
A beauty half revealed, a helpmeet sent
To draw the soul away from valley clods;
Made from itself, yet now a better self—
Soul in the soulless, arrow tipped with fire
Let down into a careless breast; a pang
Sweeter than healing that cries out with it
For light all light, and is beheld at length—
The morning dawns.

 Were not we born to light?
Ay, and we saw the men and women as saints
Walk in a garden. All our thoughts were fair;
Our simple hearts, as dovecotes full of doves,
Made home and nest for them. They fluttered forth.
And flocks of them flew white about the world.
And dreams were like to ships that floated us
Far out on silent floods, apart from earth,
From life—so far that we could see their lights
In heaven—and hear the everlasting tide,
All dappled with that fair reflected gold,
Wash up against the city wall, and sob
At the dark bows of vessels that drew on
Heavily freighted with departed souls
To whom did spirits sing; but on that song
Might none, albeit the meaning was right plain,
Impose the harsh captivity of words.

Afterward waking, sweet was early air,
Full excellent was morning: whether deep
The snow lay keenly white, and shrouds of hail
Blurred the grey breaker on a long foreshore,
And swarming plover ran, and wild white mews
And sea-pies printed with a thousand feet
The fallen whiteness, making shrill the storm;
Or whether, soothed of sunshine, throbbed and hummed
The mill atween its bowering maple trees,
And churned the leaping beck that reared, and urged
A diamond-dripping wheel.

 The happy find
Equality of beauty everywhere
To feed on. All of shade and sheen is theirs,
All the strange fashions and the fair wise ways
Of lives beneath man's own. He breathes delight
Whose soul is fresh, whose feet are wet with dew
And the melted mist of morning, when at watch
Sunk deep in fern he marks the stealthy roe,
Silent as sleep or shadow, cross the glade,
Or dart athwart his view as August stars
Shoot and are out—while gracefully pace on
The wild-eyed harts to their traditional tree
To clear the velvet from their budded horns.
It is enough to hear, it is enough
To see; the pale wide barley-field they love,
And its weird beauty, and the pale wide moon
That lowering seems to lurk between the sheaves.
So in the rustic hamlet at high noon
The white owl sailing drowsed and deaf with sleep
To hide her head in turrets browned of moss
That is the rust of time. Ay so the pinks
And mountain grass marked on a sharp sea-cliff
While far below the northern diver feeds;
She having ended settling while she sits,
As vessels water-logged that sink at sea
And quietly into the deep go down.

It is enough to wake, it is enough
But on a day death on the doorstep sits
Waiting, or like a veil褠woman walks
Dogging his footsteps, or athwart his path
The splendid passion-flower love unfolds
Buds full of sorrow, not ordained to know
Appeasement through the answer of a sigh,
The kiss of pity with denial given,
The crown and blossom of accomplishment.
Or haply comes the snake with subtlety,
And tempts him with an apple to know all.

So,—Shut the gate; the story tells itself
Over and over; Eden must be lost
If after it be won. He stands at fault,
Not knowing at all how this should be—he feels
The great bare barrenness o' the outside world.
He thinks on Time and what it has to say;
Sitting afar. And as the moon draws on
To cover the day-king in his eclipse,
And thin the last fine sickle of light, till all
Be gone, so fares it with his darkened soul.

The dark, but not Orion sparkling there
With his best stars; the dark, but not yet Eve.
And now the wellsprings of sweet natural joy
Lie, as the Genie sealed of Solomon,
Fast prisoned in his heart; he hath not learned
The spell whereby to loose and set them forth,
And all the glad delights that boyhood loved
Smell at Oblivion's poppy, and lie still.

Ah! they must sleep—'The mill can grind no more
With water that hath passed.' Let it run on.
For he hath caught a whisper in the night;
This old inheritance in darkness given,
The world, is widened, warmed, it is alive,
Comes to his beating heart and bids it wake,
Opens the door to youth, and bids it forth,
Exultant for expansion and release,
And bent to satisfy the mighty wish,
Comfort and satisfy the mighty wish,
Life of his life, the soul's immortal child
That is to him as Eve.

        He cannot win,
Nor earn, nor see, nor hear, nor comprehend,
With all the watch, tender, impetuous,
That wastes him, this, whereof no less he feels
Infinite things; but yet the night is full
Of air-beats and of heart-beats for her sake.
Eve the aspirer, give her what she wants,
Or wherefore was he born?

        O he was born
To wish—then turn away:—to wish again
And half forget his wish for earthlier joy;
He draws the net to land that brings red gold;
His dreams among the meshes tangled lie,
And learning hath him at her feet;—and love,
The sea-born creature fresh from her sea foam,
Touches the ruddiest veins in his young heart,
Makes it to sob in him and sigh in him,
Restless, repelled, dying, alive and keen,
Fainting away for the remorseless ALL
Gone by, gone up, or sweetly gone before,
But never in his arms. Then pity comes,
Knocks at his breast, it may be, and comes in,
Makes a wide wound that haply will not heal,
But bleeds for poverty, and crime, and pain,
Till for the dear kin's sake he grandly dares
Or wastes him, with a wise improvidence;
But who can stir the weighty world; or who
Can drink a sea of tears?

 O love, and life,
O world, and can it be that this is all?
Leave him to tread expectance underfoot;
Let him alone to tame down his great hope
Before it breaks his heart: 'Give me my share
That I foresaw, my place, my draught of life.
This that I bear, what is it?—me no less
It binds, I cannot disenslave my soul.'

There is but halting for the wearied foot.
The better way is hidden; faith hath failed—
One stronger far than reason mastered her.
It is not reason makes faith hard, but life.
The husks of his dead creed, downtrod and dry,
Are powerless now as some dishonoured spell,
Some aged Pythia in her priestly clothes,
Some widow'd witch divining by the dead.
Or if he keep one shrine undesecrate
And go to it from time to time with tears,
Is wrapped about His head, He lies embalmed
With myrrh and spices in His sepulchre,
That trust it the One Life, the all that lives.

O mother Eve, who wert beguiled of old,
Thy blood is in thy children, thou art yet
Their fate and copy; with thy milk they drew
The immortal want of morning; but thy day
Dawned and was over, and thy children know
Contentment never, nor continuance long.
For even thus it is with them: the day
Waxeth, to wane anon, and a long night
Leaves the dark heart unsatisfied with stars.

A soul in want and restless and bereft
To whom all life hath lied, shall it too lie?
Thou hast been pleased to make me thus and thus.
I do submit me to Thy sovereign will
That I full oft should hunger and not have,
And vainly yearn after the perfect good,
Gladness and peace'?

        No, rather dare think thus:
'Ere chaos first had being, earth, or time,
My Likeness was apparent in high heaven,
Divine and manlike, and his dwelling place
Was the bosom of the Father. By His hands
Were the worlds made and filled with diverse growths
And ordered lives. Then afterward they said,
Taking strange counsel, as if he who worked
Hitherto should not henceforth work alone,
And it became a thought before the event.
There they foresaw my face, foreheard my speech,

'And I was in a garden, and I fell
Would not be robbed of me for ever—Love
For my sake passed into humanity,
And there for my first Father won me home.
How should I rest then? I have NOT gone home;
I feed on husks, and they given grudgingly,
What shall I do?'

        Ay, I will dare think thus:
'I cannot rest because He doth not rest
My soul is conscious of His wondrous wish,
And my heart's hunger doth but answer His
Whose thought has met with mine.

        'I have not all;
He moves me thus to take of Him what lacks.
To add Himself to life and so for aye
Make it enough.'
         A thought by night, a wish
After the morning, and behold it dawns
Pathetic in a still solemnity,
And mighty words are said for him once more,
'Let there be light.' Great heaven and earth have heard,

Where holy ground begins, unhallowed ends,
Is marked by no distinguishable line;
The turf unites, the pathways intertwine;
And, wheresoe'er the stealing footstep tends,
Garden, and that domain where kindred, friends,
And neighbours rest together, here confound
Their several features, mingled like the sound
Of many waters, or as evening blends
With shady night. Soft airs, from shrub and flower,
Waft fragrant greetings to each silent grave; 
And while those lofty poplars gently wave
Their tops, between them comes and goes a sky
Bright as the glimpses of eternity,
To saints accorded in their mortal hour. 

I have a music to play
I have a song to sing
I have a smile to give
I have a life to live
 
A part of this
grand orchaestration iam
a part of this
lovely poetry iam
 
A part of it we all are
each and every one of us
what 'SIGNIFICANCE' is your part
kills it all 
a 'PART' is a part. . and 
that is all. 

Away into the distance, 
in the mountains and the hills
lives a part of me
that scales the heights of dreams
reaching for the stars of Fortune
a part that gathers lilies by the lake
saunters down the sodden lane
past the wooden cottage
zigzagging through the rain- -
eye-kissing the slopes, steeply
rising from the earth's volcanic profusion 
while calm descends from above
and envelops one like a fog.

 

Slow in growth but rather rare
Year on year it’s never altered 
Candle shaped and coloured grey, 
What a boring plant it is! 
Always measuring just two inches
Never mind my loving care
Watering, feeding, heat in winter, 
Nothing ever makes it budge.
Other cacti burgeon, flourish
Trichocaulon stays the same—
Or it did, until today! 

Scarcely could I credit it
First to see a little offset
Candle shaped and coloured grey
Then, by Jove, there was a flower
Quite two millimetres wide.
Quick! Indoors and get the camera, 
Tell the neighbours, phone the press
Trichocaulon cactiforme
Has produced a miracle.
Never now shall I complain, 
All my work was not in vain
Nor will you hear me any more
Calling Trichocaulon boring.
 
* pronounced  ‘cac-ti-for-may’. 

The year is on the wing, my love, 
With tearful days and nights; 
The clouds are on the wing above 
With gathering swallow-flights. 

The year is on the wing, my sweet, 
And in the ghostly race, 
With patter of unnumbered feet, 
The dead leaves fly apace. 

The year is on the wing, and shakes 
The last rose from its tree; 
And I, whose heart in parting breaks, 
Must bid adieu to thee. 

What delightful hosts are they -- 
   Life and Love! 
Lingeringly I turn away, 
   This late hour, yet glad enough 
They have not withheld from me 
   Their high hospitality. 
So, with face lit with delight 
   And all gratitude, I stay 
   Yet to press their hands and say, 
"Thanks. -- So fine a time! Good night

"TO J. L. MOTLEY

YES, we knew we must lose him,--though friendship may claim
To blend her green leaves with the laurels of fame;
Though fondly, at parting, we call him our own,
'T is the whisper of love when the bugle has blown.

As the rider that rests with the spur on his heel,
As the guardsman that sleeps in his corselet of steel,
As the archer that stands with his shaft on the string,
He stoops from his toil to the garland we bring.

What pictures yet slumber unborn in his loom,
Till their warriors shall breathe and their beauties shall bloom,
While the tapestry lengthens the life-glowing dyes
That caught from our sunsets the stain of their skies!

In the alcoves of death, in the charnels of timid,
Where flit the gaunt spectres of passion and crime,
There are triumphs untold, there are martyrs unsung,
There are heroes yet silent to speak with his tongue!

Let us hear the proud story which time has bequeathed!
From lips that are warm with the freedom they breathed!
Let him summon its tyrants, and tell us their doom,
Though he sweep the black past like Van Tromp with his broom!

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The dream flashes by, for the west-winds awake
On pampas, on prairie, o'er mountain and lake,
To bathe the swift bark, like a sea-girdled shrine,
With incense they stole from the rose and the pine.

So fill a bright cup with the sunlight that gushed
When the dead summer's jewels were trampled and crushed:
THE TRUE KNIGHT OF LEARNING,--the world holds him dear,--

When will ye think of me, my friends?
When will ye think of me?
When the last red light, the farewell of day,
From the rock and the river is passing away,
When the air with a deep'ning hush is fraught,
And the heart grows burden'd with tender thought
Then let it be! 

When will ye think of me, kind friends?
When will ye think of me?
When the rose of the rich midsummer time
Is fill'd with the hues of its glorious prime;
When ye gather its bloom, as in bright hours fled,
From the walks where my footsteps no more may tread;
Then let it be! 

When will ye think of me, sweet friends?
When will ye think of me?
When the sudden tears o'erflow your eye
At the sound of some olden melody;
When ye hear the voice of a mountain stream,
When ye feel the charm of a poet's dream;
Then let it be! 

Thus let my memory be with you, friends!
Thus ever think of me!
Kindly and gently, but as of one
For whom 'tis well to be fled and gone;
As of a bird from a chain unbound,
As of a wanderer whose home is found;
So let it be. 

Pensive they sit, and roll their languid eyes,
Nibble their toast, and cool their tea with sighs,
Or else forget the purpose of the night,
Forget their tea -- forget their appetite.
See with cross'd arms they sit -- ah! happy crew,
The fire is going out and no one rings
For coals, and therefore no coals Betty brings.
A fly is in the milk-pot -- must he die
By a humane society?
No, no; there Mr. Werter takes his spoon,
Inserts it, dips the handle, and lo! soon
The little straggler, sav'd from perils dark,
Across the teaboard draws a long wet mark.
Arise! take snuffers by the handle,
There's a large cauliflower in each candle.
A winding-sheet, ah me! I must away
To No.  just beyond the circus gay.
'Alas, my friend! your coat sits very well;
Where may your tailor live?' 'I may not tell.
O pardon me -- I'm absent now and then.
Where might my tailor live? I say again
I cannot tell, let me no more be teaz'd --
He lives in Wapping, might live where he pleas'd.

'How many do you need to have a party? 
For it doesn’t require a crowd.
While the party of one may torment you
In your personal retirement


imprisoned cloud.

Friends moved away-
Layoffs-death-the familiar vanishes now from sight. 
While you set alone with your thoughts
Day-in 


day out-through out the darkness of night.

It is now time to look around
Like the Psalmist-and take inventory of your life.
Such as Paul and Silas imprisoned
As they spent
 Their then felt abandoned life. 

Our Redeemers’ constant presence is with us
He will carry you through all of your lonely days.
"And surely I am with you always, to the very end of your age."
(Math. 

See settled Reason on the judgement-seat;
Around her crowd Distrust, and Doubt, and Fear,
And thoughtful Foresight, and tormenting Care;
Far from the throne the trembling Pleasures stand,
Chain'd up or exiled by her stern command.
Till happy chance reverts the cruel scene;
And apish Folly, with her wild resort
Of wit and jest, disturbs the solemn court.

See the fantastic Minstrelsy advance
To breathe the song and animate the dance.
Bless'd the usurper! happy the surprise!
Her mimic postures catch our eager eyes;
Her jingling bells affect our captive ear,
And in the sights we see and sounds we hear,
Against our judgement she our sense employs,
The laws of troubled reason she drestroys,
And in their place rejoices to indite
Wild schemes of mirth and plans of loose delight. 

Mournfully to and fro, to and fro the trees are waving;  
What did you say, my dear?
The rain-bruised leaves are suddenly shaken, as a child
Asleep still shakes in the clutch of a sob—  
Yes, my love, I hear.
 
One lonely bell, one only, the storm-tossed afternoon is braving,
Why not let it ring?
The roses lean down when they hear it, the tender, mild
Flowers of the bleeding-heart fall to the throb—  
It is such a little thing!
 
A wet bird walks on the lawn, call to the boy to come and look,
Yes, it is over now.
Call to him out of the silence, call him to see  
The starling shaking its head as it walks in the grass—
Ah, who knows how?
 
He cannot see it, I can never show it him, how it shook—
Don’t disturb him, darling.
—Its head as it walked: I can never call him to me,  
Never, he is not, whatever shall come to pass.  
No, look at the wet starling.

tells me
this lovely scene
that nothing will be same
On Last Looking into His 'Hesperides'

I often see flowers from a passing car
That are gone before I can tell what they are.

I want to get out of the train and go back
To see what they were beside the track.

I name all the flowers I am sure they weren't;
Not fireweed loving where woods have burnt- 

Not bluebells gracing a tunnel mouth- 
Not lupine living on sand and drouth.

Was something brushed across my mind
That no one on earth will ever find?

Heaven gives it glimpses only to those
Not in position to look too close. 

Met a man who interested me
He wrote great poetry you see
Said we'd meet and share some time
Maybe even have our bodies rhyme

Strangers meet from not so far apart
Maybe even a friendship here
Similar likes and time to share
We explore without a care

Nite nite my passionate man
Dream dream the dream of peace
Wake wake and know I care
Wait wait Ill soon be there

Lay in my lap and enjoy our time
My hands run through your hair
Relaxed and deep in thought
A kiss to ease away the doubt

To chat about our common likes
To cuddle and chat some more
To explore our desires
To cuddle while we sleep

That's what we made our own
When we met.

Written December nmanageable as history: these
Followers of Tammuz to the land
That offered no return, where dust
Grew thick on every bolt and door. And so the world
Chilled, and the women wept, tore at their hair.
Yet, in the skies, a goddess governed Sirius, the Dog,
Who shines alike on mothers, lesbians, and whores.

What are we governed by? Dido and Carrie
Chapman Catt arrange themselves as statues near
The playground and the Tivoli. While warming up the beans,
Miss Sanders broods on the Rhamnusian, the whole earth worshipping
Her godhead. Later, vegetables in Athens.
Chaste in the dungeon, swooning with voluptuousness,

Their bowels almost drove Swift mad. "Sad stem,
Sweet evil, stretching out a lion's jaws," wrote Marbode.
Now we cling together in our caves. That not impossible she
That rots and wrinkles in the sun, the shadow
Of all men, man's counterpart, sweet rois
Of vertew and of gentilness.  The brothel and the crib endure.
Past reason hunted. How we die! Their pain, their blood, are ours. 

Just as the sun was setting
Back of the Western hills
Grandfather stood by the window
Eating the last of his pills.

And Grandmother, by the cupboard,
Knitting, heard him say:
'I ought to have went to the village
To fetch some more pills today.'

Then Grandmother snuffled a teardrop
And said. 'It is jest like I suz
T’ th’ parson—Grandfather’s liver
Ain’t what it used to was:

'It’s gittin’ torpid and dormant,
It don’t function like of old,
And even them pills he swallers
Don’t seem no more t’ catch hold;

'They used to grab it and shake it
And joggle it up and down
And turn dear Grandfather yaller
Except when they turned him brown;

'I remember when we was married
His liver was lively and gay,
A kickin’ an’ rippin’ an’ givin’
Dear Ezry new pains ev’ry day;

'It used to turn clear over backwards
An’ palpitate wuss’n a pump
An’ give him the janders and yallers
An’ bounce around thumpty-thump;

'But now it is torpid and dormant
And painless and quiet and cold;
Ah, me! all’s so peaceful an’ quiet
Since Grandfather’s liver ’s grown old!

Then Grandmother wiped a new teardrop
And sighed: 'It is just like I suz
T’ th’ parson: Grandfather’s liver
Ain’t what it used to was.

'Ye shepherds so cheerful and gay,
     Whose flocks never carelessly roam; 
   Should Corydon's happen to stray,
     Oh! call the poor wanderers home. 
   Allow me to muse and to sigh,
     Nor talk of the change that ye find;
   None once was so watchful as I;
     I have left my dear Phillis behind.
   Now I know what it is, to have strove
    With the torture of doubt and desire;
  What it is to admire and to love,
    And to leave her we love and admire, 
  Ah, lead forth my flock in the morn,
    And the damps of each evening repel; 
  Alas! I am faint and forlorn:
    -I have bade my dear Phillis farewell.

  Since Phillis vouchsaf'd me a look,
    I never once dreamed of my vine;
  May I lose both my pipe and my crook,
    If I knew of a kid that was mine!
  I priz'd every hour that went by,
    Beyond all that had pleas'd me before;
  But now they are past, and I sigh;
    And I grieve that I priz'd them no more.

  But why do I languish in vain;
    Why wander thus pensively here?
  Oh! why did I come from the plain,
    Where I fed on the smiles of my dear?
  They tell me, my favourite maid,
    The pride of that valley, is flown;
  Alas! where with her I have stray'd,
    I could wander with pleasure, alone.

  When forc'd the fair nymph to forgo,
    What anguish I felt at my heart!
  Yet I thought-but it might not be so-
    'Twas with pain that she saw me depart.
  She gaz'd, as I slowly withdrew:
    My path I could hardly discern;
  So sweetly she bade me adieu,
    I thought that she bade me return.

  The pilgrim that journeys all day
    To visit some far distant shrine,
  If he bear but a relique away,
    Is happy, nor heard to repine.
  Thus widely remov'd from the fair,
    Where my vows, my devotion, I owe,
  Soft hope is the relique I bear,
    And my solace wherever I go. 




Ye shepherds so chearful and gay, 
Whose flocks never carelessly roam; 
Should Corydon's happen to stray, 
Oh! call the poor wanderers home. 
Allow me to muse and to sigh, 
Nor talk of the change that ye find; 
None once was so watchful as I; 
-- I have left my dear Phyllis behind. 
Now I know what it is, to have strove 
With the torture of doubt and desire;

What it is, to admire and to love, 
And to leave her we love and admire. 
Ah lead forth my flock in the morn, 
And the damps of each ev'ning repel; 
Alas! I am faint and forlorn: 
-- I have bade my dear Phyllis farewel. 
Since Phyllis vouchsaf'd me a look, 
I never once dreamt of my vine; 
May I lose both my pipe and my crook, 
If I knew of a kid that was mine.


I priz'd every hour that went by, 
Beyond all that had pleas'd me before; 
But now they are past, and I sigh; 
And I grieve that I priz'd them no more. 
But why do I languish in vain; 
Why wander thus pensively here? 
Oh! why did I come from the plain, 
Where I fed on the smiles of my dear? 
They tell me, my favourite maid, 
The pride of that valley, is flown;

Alas! where with her I have stray'd, 
I could wander with pleasure, alone. 
When forc'd the fair nymph to forego, 
What anguish I felt at my heart! 
Yet I thought -- but it might not be so -- 
'Twas with pain that she saw me depart. 
She gaz'd, as I slowly withdrew; 
My path I could hardly discern; 
So sweetly she bade me adieu, 
I thought that she bade me return.


The pilgrim that journeys all day 
To visit some far-distant shrine, 
If he bear but a relique away, 
Is happy, nor heard to repine. 
Thus widely remov'd from the fair, 
Where my vows, my devotion, I owe, 
Soft hope is the relique I bear, 
And my solace wherever I go. 

My banks they are furnish'd with bees, 
Whose murmur invites one to sleep; 
My grottos are shaded with trees, 
And my hills are white-over with sheep. 
I seldom have met with a loss, 
Such health do my fountains bestow; 
My fountains all border'd with moss, 
Where the hare-bells and violets grow. 
Not a pine in my grove is there seen, 
But with tendrils of woodbine is bound:

Not a beech's more beautiful green, 
But a sweet-briar entwines it around. 
Not my fields, in the prime of the year, 
More charms than my cattle unfold; 
Not a brook that is limpid and clear, 
But it glitters with fishes of gold. 
One would think she might like to retire 
To the bow'r I have labour'd to rear; 
Not a shrub that I heard her admire, 
But I hasted and planted it there.

O how sudden the jessamine strove 
With the lilac to render it gay! 
Already it calls for my love, 
To prune the wild branches away. 
From the plains, from the woodlands and groves, 
What strains of wild melody flow! 
How the nightingales warble their loves 
From thickets of roses that blow! 
And when her bright form shall appear, 
Each bird shall harmoniously join

In a concert so soft and so clear, 
As -- she may not be fond to resign. 
I have found out a gift for my fair; 
I have found where the wood-pigeons breed: 
But let me that plunder forbear, 
She will say 'twas a barbarous deed. 
For he ne'er could be true, she aver'd, 
Who could rob a poor bird of its young: 
And I lov'd her the more, when I heard 
Such tenderness fall from her tongue.

I have heard her with sweetness unfold 
How that pity was due to -- a dove: 
That it ever attended the bold; 
And she call'd it the sister of love. 
But her words such a pleasure convey, 
So much I her accents adore, 
Let her speak, and whatever she say, 
Methinks I should love her the more. 
Can a bosom so gentle remain 
Unmov'd, when her Corydon sighs!

Will a nymph that is fond of the plain, 
These plains and this valley despise? 
Dear regions of silence and shade! 
Soft scenes of contentment and ease! 
Where I could have pleasingly stray'd, 
If aught, in her absence, could please. 
But where does my Phyllida stray? 
And where are her grots and her bow'rs? 
Are the groves and the valleys as gay, 
And the shepherds as gentle as ours?

The groves may perhaps be as fair, 
And the face of the valleys as fine; 
The swains may in manners compare, 
But their love is not equal to mine. 

Why will you my passion reprove? 
Why term it a folly to grieve? 
Ere I shew you the charms of my love, 
She is fairer than you can believe. 
With her mien she enamours the brave; 
With her wit she engages the free; 
With her modesty pleases the grave; 
She is ev'ry way pleasing to me. 

O you that have been of her train, 
Come and join in my amorous lays;

I could lay down my life for the swain, 
That will sing but a song in her praise. 
When he sings, may the nymphs of the town 
Come trooping, and listen the while; 
Nay on him let not Phyllida frown; 
-- But I cannot allow her to smile. 
For when Paridel tries in the dance 
Any favour with Phyllis to find, 
O how, with one trivial glance, 
Might she ruin the peace of my mind!

In ringlets he dresses his hair, 
And his crook is be-studded around; 
And his pipe -- oh may Phyllis beware 
Of a magic there is in the sound. 
'Tis his with mock passion to glow; 
'Tis his in smooth tales to unfold, 
How her face is as bright as the snow, 
And her bosom, be sure, is as cold? 
How the nightingales labour the strain, 
With the notes of his charmer to vie;

How they vary their accents in vain, 
Repine at her triumphs, and die.'' 
To the grove or the garden he strays, 
And pillages every sweet; 
Then, suiting the wreath to his lays 
He throws it at Phyllis's feet. 
O Phyllis, he whispers, more fair, 
More sweet than the jessamine's flow'r! 
What are pinks, in a morn, to compare? 
What is eglantine, after a show'r?

Then the lily no longer is white; 
Then the rose is depriv'd of its bloom; 
Then the violets die with despight, 
And the wood-bines give up their perfume.'' 
Thus glide the soft numbers along, 
And he fancies no shepherd his peer; 
-- Yet I never should envy the song, 
Were not Phyllis to lend it an ear. 
Let his crook be with hyacinths bound, 
So Phyllis the trophy despise:

Let his forehead with laurels be crown'd, 
So they shine not in Phyllis's eyes. 
The language that flows from the heart 
Is a stranger to Paridel's tongue; 
-- Yet may she beware of his art, 
Or sure I must envy the song. 

Ye shepherds give ear to my lay, 
And take no more heed of my sheep: 
They have nothing to do but to stray; 
I have nothing to do but to weep. 
Yet do not my folly reprove; 
She was fair -- and my passion begun; 
She smil'd -- and I could not but love; 
She is faithless -- and I am undone. 
Perhaps I was void of all thought: 
Perhaps it was plain to foresee, 
That a nymph so compleat would be sought 
By a swain more engaging than me. 
Ah! love ev'ry hope can inspire; 
It banishes wisdom the while; 
And the lip of the nymph we admire 
Seems for ever adorn'd with a smile. 
She is faithless, and I am undone; 
Ye that witness the woes I endure; 
Let reason instruct you to shun 
What it cannot instruct you to cure. 
Beware how you loiter in vain 
Amid nymphs of an higher degree: 
It is not for me to explain 
How fair, and how fickle they be. 
Alas! from the day that we met, 
What hope of an end to my woes? 
When I cannot endure to forget 
The glance that undid my repose. 
Yet time may diminish the pain: 
The flow'r, and the shrub, and the tree,

Which I rear'd for her pleasure in vain, 
In time may have comfort for me. 
The sweets of a dew-sprinkled rose, 
The sound of a murmuring stream, 
The peace which from solitude flows, 
Henceforth shall be Corydon's theme. 
High transports are shewn to the sight, 
But we are not to find them our own; 
Fate never bestow'd such delight, 
As I with my Phyllis had known. 
O ye woods, spread your branches apace; 
To your deepest recesses I fly; 
I would hide with the beasts of the chace; 
I would vanish from every eye. 
Yet my reed shall resound thro' the grove 
With the same sad complaint it begun; 
How she smil'd, and I could not but love; 
Was faithless, and I am undone

Thir. 
Say, tell me true, what is the doleful cause 
That Corydon is not the man he was? 
Your cheerful presence used to lighten cares, 
And from the plains to banish gloomy fears. 
Whene'er unto the circling swains you sung 
Our ravish'd souls upon the music hung; 
The gazing, listening flocks forgot their meat, 
While vocal grottos did your lays repeat: 
And in your downcast and desponding looks 
Appears some fatal and impending woe; 
I fear to ask, and yet desire to know. 

Cor.
The doleful news, how shall I, Thirsis, tell! 
In blooming youth the hapless Damon fell: 
He's dead, he's dead, and with him all my joy; 
The mournful thought does all gay forms destroy: 
This is the cause of my unusual grief, 
Which sullenly admits of no relief. 

Thir.
Begone all mirth! begone all sports and play, 
To a deluge of grief and tears give way. 
Damon the just, the generous, and the young, 
Must Damon's worth and merit be unsung? 
No, Corydon, the wondrous youth you knew 
How as in years so he in virtue grew; 
Embalm his fame in never dying verse, 
As a just tribute to his doleful hearse. 

Cor.
Assist me, mighty grief, my breast inspire 
With generous heats and with thy wildest fire, 
While in a solemn and a mournful strain 
Of Damon gone for ever I complain. 
Ye muses, weep; your mirth and songs forbear, 
And for him sigh and shed a friendly tear; 
He was your favourite, and by your aid 
In charming verse his witty thoughts array'd; 
He had of knowledge, learning, wit, a store, 
To it denied he still press'd after more. 
He was a pious and a virtuous soul, 
And still press'd forward to the heavenly goal; 
He was a faithful, true, and constant friend, 
Faithful, and true, and constant to the end. 
Ye flowers, hang down and droop your heads, 
No more around your grateful odours spread; 
Ye leafy trees, your blooming honours shed, 
Damon for ever from your shade is fled; 
Fled to the mansions of eternal light, 
Where endless wonders strike his happy sight. 
Ye birds, be mute, as through the trees you fly, 
Mute as the grave wherein my friend does lie. 
Ye winds, breathe sighs as through the air you rove, 
And in sad pomp the trembling branches move. 
Ye gliding brooks, O weep your channels dry, 
My flowing tears them fully shall supply; 
You in soft murmurs may your grief express, 
And yours, you swains, in mournful songs compress. 
I to some dark and gloomy shade will fly, 
Dark as the grave wherein my friend does lie; 
And for his death to lonely rocks complain 
In mournful accents and a dying strain, 
While pining echo answers me again. 

DAVID.
What means yon apparition in the sky, 
Thirsis, that dazzles every shepherd's eye? 
I slumbering was when from yon glorious cloud 
Came gliding music heavenly, sweet, and loud, 
With sacred raptures which my bosom fires, 
And with celestial joy my soul inspires; 
It soothes the native horrors of the night, 
And gladdens nature more than dawning light. 

THIRSIS.
But hold, see hither through the yielding air 
An angel comes: for mighty news prepare. 

ANGEL GABRIEL.
Rejoice, ye swains, anticipate the morn 
With songs of praise; for lo! a Saviour's born. 
With joyful haste to Bethlehem repair, 
And you will find the almighty infant there; 
Wrapp'd in a swaddling band you'll find your king, 
And in a manger laid, to him your praises bring. 

CHORUS OF ANGELS.
Immortal glory be; 
Let peace be in the humble cells 
Of Adam's progeny. 

DAVID.
No more the year shall wintry horrors bring; 
Fix'd in the indulgence of eternal spring, 
Immortal green shall clothe the hills and vales, 
And odorous sweets shall load the balmy gales; 
The silver brooks shall in soft murmurs tell 
The joy that shall their oozy channels swell. 
Feed on, my flocks, and crop the tender grass, 
Let blooming joy appear on every face; 
For lo! this blessed, this propitious morn, 
The Saviour of lost mankind is born. 

THIRSIS.
Thou fairest morn that ever sprang from night, 
Or deck'd the opening skies with rosy light, 
Well mayst thou shine with a distinguish'd ray, 
Since here Emmanuel condescends to stay. 
Our fears, our guilt, our darkness to dispel, 
And save us from the horrid jaws of hell. 
Who from his throne descended, matchless love! 
To guide poor mortals to bless'd seats above: 
But come without delay, let us be gone, 
Shepherd, let's go, and humbly kiss the Son. 

DERMOT, SHEELAH

A Nymph and swain, Sheelah and Dermot hight;
Who wont to weed the court of Gosford knight;
While each with stubbed knife removed the roots,
That raised between the stones their daily shoots;
As at their work they sate in counterview,
With mutual beauty smit, their passion grew.
Sing, heavenly Muse, in sweetly flowing strain,
The soft endearments of the nymph and swain.


DERMOT


My love to Sheelah is more firmly fixt,
Than strongest weeds that grow those stones betwixt;
My spud these nettles from the stones can part;
No knife so keen to weed thee from my heart.


SHEELAH


My love for gentle Dermot faster grows,
Than yon tall dock that rises to thy nose.
Cut down the dock, 'twill sprout again; but, O!
Love rooted out, again will never grow.


DERMOT


No more that brier thy tender leg shall rake:
(I spare the thistles for Sir Arthur's sake)
Sharp are the stones; take thou this rushy mat;
The hardest bum will bruise with sitting squat.


SHEELAH


Thy breeches, torn behind, stand gaping wide;
This petticoat shall save thy dear backside;
Nor need I blush; although you feel it wet,
Dermot, I vow, 'tis nothing else but sweat.


DERMOT


At an old stubborn root I chanced to tug,
When the Dean threw me this tobacco-plug;
A longer ha'p'orth never did I see;
This, dearest Sheelah, thou shall share with me.


SHEELAH


In at the pantry door, this morn I slipt,
And from the shelf a charming crust I whipt:
Dennis was out, and I got hither safe;
And thou, my dear, shall have the bigger half.


DERMOT


When you saw Tady at long bullets play,
You sate and loused him all a sunshine day:
How could you, Sheelah, listen to his tales,
Or crack such lice as his between your nails?


SHEELAH


When you with Oonah stood behind a ditch,
I peep'd, and saw you kiss the dirty bitch;
Dermot, how could you touch these nasty sluts?
I almost wish'd this spud were in your guts.


DERMOT


If Oonah once I kiss'd, forbear to chide;
Her aunt's my gossip by my father's side:
But, if I ever touch her lips again,
May I be doom'd for life to weed in rain!


SHEELAH


Dermot, I swear, though Tady's locks could hold
Ten thousand lice, and every louse was gold;
Him on my lap you never more shall see;
Or may I lose my weeding knife—and thee!


DERMOT


O, could I earn for thee, my lovely lass,
A pair of brogues to bear thee dry to mass!
But see, where Norah with the sowins comes—
Then let us rise, and rest our weary bums.[Silvia] Pretty Nymph! within this Shade, 
Whilst the Flocks to rest are laid,
Whilst the World dissolves in Heat,
Take this cool, and flow'ry Seat: 
And with pleasing Talk awhile
Let us two the Time beguile; 
Tho' thou here no Shepherd see, 
To encline his humble Knee, 
Or with melancholy Lays 
Sing thy dangerous Beauty's Praise. 


[Dorinda] Nymph! with thee I here wou'd stay, 
But have heard, that on this Day, 
Near those Beeches, scarce in view, 
All the Swains some Mirth pursue: 
To whose meeting now I haste. 
Solitude do's Life but waste. 

[Silvia] Prithee, but a Moment stay. 


[Dorinda] No! my Chaplet wou'd decay; 
Ev'ry drooping Flow'r wou'd mourn, 
And wrong the Face, they shou'd adorn. 


[Silvia] I can tell thee, tho' so Fair, 
And dress'd with all that rural Care, 
Most of the admiring Swains 
Will be absent from the Plains. 
Gay Sylvander in the Dance 
Meeting with a shrew'd Mischance, 
To his Cabin's now confin'd 
By Mopsus, who the Strain did bind: 
Damon through the Woods do's stray, 
Where his Kids have lost their way: 
Young Narcissus iv'ry Brow 
Rac'd by a malicious Bough, 
Keeps the girlish Boy from sight, 
Till Time shall do his Beauty right. 

[Dorinda] Where's Alexis? 


[Silvia]      –He, alas! 
Lies extended on the Grass; 
Tears his Garland, raves, despairs, 
Mirth and Harmony forswears; 
Since he was this Morning shown, 
That Delia must not be his Own. 


[Dorinda] Foolish Swain! such Love to place. 


[Silvia] On any but Dorinda's Face. 


[Dorinda] Hasty Nymph! I said not so. 


[Silvia] No–but I thy Meaning know. 
Ev'ry Shepherd thou wou'd'st have 
Not thy Lover, but thy Slave; 
To encrease thy captive Train, 
Never to be lov'd again. 
But, since all are now away, 
Prithee, but a Moment stay. 


[Dorinda] No; the Strangers, from the Vale, 
Sure will not this Meeting fail; 
Graceful one, the other Fair. 
He too, with the pensive Air, 
Told me, ere he came this way 
He was wont to look more Gay. 


[Silvia] See! how Pride thy Heart inclines 
To think, for Thee that Shepherd pines; 
When those Words, that reach'd thy Ear, 
Chloe was design'd to hear; 
Chloe, who did near thee stand, 
And his more speaking Looks command. 


[Dorinda] Now thy Envy makes me smile. 
That indeed were worth his while: 
Chloe next thyself decay'd, 
And no more a courted Maid. 

[Silvia] Next myself! Young Nymph, forbear. 
Still the Swains allow me Fair, 
Tho' not what I was that Day, 
When Colon bore the Prize away; 
When– 

[Dorinda] –Oh, hold! that Tale will last, 
Till all the Evening Sports are past; 
Till no Streak of Light is seen, 
Nor Footstep prints the flow'ry Green. 
What thou wert, I need not know, 
What I am, must haste to show. 
Only this I now discern 
From the things, thou'd'st have me learn, 
That Woman-kind's peculiar Joys 
From past, or present Beauties rise. 

While in heroic numbers some relate 
The amazing turns of wise eternal fate; 
Exploits of heroes in the dusty field, 
That to their name immortal honour yield; 
Grant me, ye powers, by the limpid spring 
The harmless of the plain to sing, 
A wreath of flowers cull'd from the 
Is all the my humble muse demands. 
Now blithsome shepherds, by the early dawn, 
Their new shorn flocks drive to the dewy lawn; 
While, in a bleating language, each salutes 
The welcome morning and their fellow brutes: 
Then all prepared for the rural feast, 
And in their finest Sunday habits drest; 
The crystal brook supplied the mirror's place, 
They bathed and viewed their cleanly face, 
And nymphs resorted to the fields 
Pomp the country yields. 
The place appointed was a spacious vale, 
Fann'd always by a cooling western gale, 
Which in soft breezes through the meadows stray, 
And steals the ripened fragrancies away; 
Here every shepherd might his flocks survey, 
Securely roam and take his harmless play; 
And here were flowers each shepherdess to grace, 
On her fair bosom courting but a place. 
How in this vale, beneath a grateful shade, 
By twining boughs of spreading made, 
On seats of homely turf themselves they place, 
And cheerfully enjoyed the rural feast, 
Consisting of the produce of the fields, 
And all the luxury the country yields. 
No maddening liquors spoil'd their harmless mirth, 
But an untainted spring their thirst allayed, 
Which in meadows through the valley strayed. 
Thrice happy swains who spend your golden days 
In pastime; and when night displays 
Her sable shade, to peaceful huts retire; 
Can any man a sweeter bliss desire? 
In ancient times so pass'd the smiling hour, 
When our first parents lived in Eden's bower, 
E'er care and trouble were pronounced, 
Or sin had blasted the creation. 

The morn dispensed a dubious light,
A sudden mist had stolen from sight
Each pleasing vale and hill;
When Damon left his humble bowers,
To guard his flocks, to fence his flowers,
Or check his wandering rill.

Though school'd from Fortune's paths to fly,
The swain beneath each lowering sky
Would oft his fate bemoan,
That he, in sylvan shades forlorn,
Must waste his cheerless even and morn,
Nor praised, nor loved, nor known.

No friend to Fame's obstreperous noise,
Yet to the whispers of her voice,
Soft murmuring, not a foe:
The pleasures he through choice declined,
When gloomy fogs depress'd his mind,
It grieved him to forego.

Grieved him to lurk the lakes beside,
Where coots in rushy dingles hide,
And moorcocks shun the day;
While caitiff bitterns, undismay'd,
Remark the swain's familiar shade,
And scorn to quit their prey.

But see the radiant sun once more,
The brightening face of heaven restore,
And raise the doubtful dawn;
And, more to gild his rural sphere,
At once the brightest train appear
That ever trod the lawn.

Amazement chill'd the shepherd's frame,
To think Bridgewater's honour'd name
Should grace his rustic cell;
That she, on all whose motions wait
Distinction, titles, rank, and state,
Should rove where shepherds dwell.

But true it is, the generous mind,
By candour sway'd, by taste refined,
Will nought but vice disdain;
Nor will the breast where fancy glows,
Deem every flower a weed that blows
Amid the desert plain.

Beseems it such, with honour crown'd,
To deal its lucid beams around,
Nor equal meed receive;
At most such garlands from the field,
As cowslips, pinks, and pansies, yield,
And rural hands can weave.

Yet strive, ye shepherds! strive to find,
And weave the fairest of the kind,
The prime of all the spring;
If haply thus you lovely fair
May, round her temples, deign to wear
The trivial wreaths you bring.

O how the peaceful halcyons play'd,
Where'er the conscious lake betray'd
Athena's placid mien!
How did the sprightlier linnets throng,
Where Paphia's charms required the song,
'Mid hazel copses green!

Lo, Dartmouth on those banks reclined,
While busy Fancy calls to mind
The glories of his line!
Methinks my cottage rears its head,
The ruin'd walls of yonder shed,
As through enchantment, shine.

But who the nymph that guides their way?
Could ever nymph descend to stray
From Hagley's famed retreat?
Else, by the blooming features fair,
The faultless make, the matchless air,
'Twere Cynthia's form complete.

So would some tuberose delight,
That struck the pilgrim's wondering sight
'Mid lonely deserts drear;
All as at eve, the sovereign flower
Dispenses round its balmy power,
And crowns the fragrant year.

Ah! now no more, the shepherd cried,
Must I Ambition's charms deride,
Her subtle force disown;
No more of Fauns or Fairies dream,
While Fancy, near each crystal stream,
Shall paint these forms alone.

By low-brow'd rock or pathless mead,
I deem'd that splendour ne'er should lead
My dazzled eyes astray;
But who, alas! will dare contend,
If beauty add, or merit blend,
Its more illustrious ray?

Nor is it long, O plaintive swain!
Since Guernsey saw, without disdain,
Where, hid in woodlands green,
The partner of his early days,
And once the rival of his praise,
Had stolen through life unseen.

Scarce faded is the vernal flower,
Since Stamford left his honour'd bower
To smile familiar here:
O form'd by Nature to disclose,
How fair that courtesy which flows
From social warmth sincere!

Nor yet have many moons decay'd,
Since Pollio sought this lonely shade,
Admired this rural maze:
The noblest breast that Virtue fires,
The Graces love, the Muse inspires,
Might pant for Pollio's praise.

Say, Thomson here was known to rest;
For him you vernal seat I drest,
Ah, never to return!
In place of wit and melting strains,
And social mirth, it now remains
To weep beside his urn.

Come then, my Lelius! come once more,
And fringe the melancholy shore
With roses and with bays,
While I each wayward Fate accuse,
That envied his impartial Muse,
To sing your early praise.

While Philo, to whose favour'd sight
Antiquity, with full delight,
Her inmost wealth displays;
Beneath yon ruin's moulder'd wall
Shall muse, and with his friends recall
The pomp of ancient days.

Here, too, shall Conway's name appear;
He praised the stream so lovely clear,
That shone the reeds among;
Yet clearness could it not disclose,
To match the rhetoric that flows
From Conway's polish'd tongue.

Even Pitt, whose fervent periods roll
Resistless through the kindling soul
Of senates, councils, kings-
Though form'd for courts, vouchsafed to rove,
Inglorious, through the shepherd's grove,
And ope his bashful springs.

But what can courts discover more
Than these rude haunts have seen before,
Each fount and shady tree?
Have not these trees and fountains seen
The pride of courts, the winning mien
Of peerless Aylesbury?

And Grenville, she whose radiant eyes
Have mark'd by slow gradation rise
The princely piles of Stowe;
Yet praised these unembellish'd woods,
And smiled to see the babbling floods
Through self-worn mazes flow.

Say, Dartmouth, who your banks admired,
Again beneath your caves retired,
Shall grace the pensive shade;
With all the bloom, with all the truth,
With all the sprightliness of youth,
By cool reflection sway'd?

Brave, yet humane, shall Smith appear;
Ye sailors! though his name be dear,
Think him not yours alone:
Grant him in other spheres to charm;
The shepherds' breasts though mild are warm,
And ours are all his own.

O Lyttleton! my honour'd guest,
Could I describe thy generous breast,
Thy firm yet polish'd mind;
How public love adorns thy name,
How Fortune, too, conspires with Fame;
The song should please mankind. 

MONTANO, SILVIO, AND MIRTILLO, SHEPHERDS

MON.  Bad are the times.  SIL.  And worse than they are we.
MON.  Troth, bad are both; worse fruit, and ill the tree:
The feast of shepherds fail.  SIL.  None crowns the cup
Of wassail now, or sets the quintel up:
And he, who used to lead the country-round,
Youthful Mirtillo, here he comes, grief-drown'd.
AMBO.  Let's cheer him up.  SIL. Behold him weeping-ripe.
MIRT. Ah, Amarillis!  farewell mirth and pipe;
Since thou art gone, no more I mean to play
To these smooth lawns, my mirthful roundelay.
Dear Amarillis!  MON.  Hark!  SIL.  Mark!  MIRT.  This
earth grew sweet
Where, Amarillis, thou didst set thy feet.
AMBO  Poor pitied youth!  MIRT.  And here the breath
of kine
And sheep grew more sweet by that breath of thine.
This dock of wool, and this rich lock of hair,
This ball of cowslips, these she gave me here.
SIL.  Words sweet as love itself.  MON.  Hark!--
MIRT.  This way she came, and this way too she went;
How each thing smells divinely redolent!
Like to a field of beans, when newly blown,
Or like a meadow being lately mown.
MON.  A sweet sad passion----
MIRT.  In dewy mornings, when she came this way,
Sweet bents would bow, to give my Love the day;
And when at night she folded had her sheep,
Daisies would shut, and closing, sigh and weep.
Besides (Ai me!) since she went hence to dwell,
The Voice's Daughter ne'er spake syllable.
But she is gone.  SIL.  Mirtillo, tell us whither?
MIRT.  Where she and I shall never meet together.
MON.  Fore-fend it, Pan!  and Pales, do thou please
To give an end.   MIRT.  To what?  SIL.  Such griefs
as these.
MIRT.  Never, O never!  Still I may endure
The wound I suffer, never find a cure.
MON.  Love, for thy sake, will bring her to these hills
And dales again.  MIRT.  No, I will languish still;
And all the while my part shall be to weep;
And with my sighs call home my bleating sheep;
And in the rind of every comely tree
I'll carve thy name, and in that name kiss thee.
MON.  Set with the sun, thy woes!  SIL.  The day
grows old;
And time it is our full-fed flocks to fold.
CHOR.  The shades grow great; but greater grows
our sorrow:--
But let's go steep
Our eyes in sleep;
And meet to weep
To-morrow. 

The summer sun hover
In the midday hour
Over my head; 
Blazing hot and red.
I made a retreat
From the midsummer heat
Under a shady tree
With birds singing sweet.
Seeing buildings soar
In multitudinous horde; 
I wish for  more trees
To be within my reach.
I rested on a cot
With a book I had brought
Leaves murmured sweet
In a most splendid dream

There's a patch of old snow in a corner
That I should have guessed
Was a blow-away paper the rain
Had brought to rest.

It is speckled with grime as if
Small print overspread it,
The news of a day I've forgotten --
If I ever read it. 

One can’t live in isolation-
In a state of meditation, 
Natural culmination, 
Oneness with creation. 

A path, running through a field,
ended near a stream.
Over the other bank
they shaped a road
that led to a village.
Someone sent a message
over the stream.
The stream howled
as
it heard the tales of the village
and 
the city. 

I see its ahead of me, 
It is also behind me.
I have seen it now.
Yet long before you  were there
Was it my blindness
Or my failure to notice.

Dear path are you sad? 
Have you awaited my footprints
If so  then why do you riddle it with stones an thorns
Your sides are clothed, grass green and blossomed
Still you choose to be nude

You bear  the child of your last conqueror
Are they your scars
Or do you cherish them as souvenirs
My feet hurt less and less as I walk
Is it your lovely caressing? 

Once I was new to you
Am I know yours to cradle? 
My feet’s gashes, on you leave a red trail
Does this blood we share make us family
I have conquered the path I walked
Does it make you my master
Am I waking towards my goal
Or am I choosing the way you lead me

Maybe I am the searcher
But my dear I am also the search
Yet I myself am also the query
Maybe I am just yours
Maybe I am you

If you look carefully in this world of any person 
.. 

who is involving himself in virtuous activities, 
he will be appreciated and get a name and fame; 

Even when he leaves life from this earthly world
.. 

And reaches the world of after life, ie heaven, 
It will be a pleasant one there also for him! 

Hence, a person who does virtuous activities everyday 
.. 

gets the pleasure of the benefits of both this earthly 
world life and the future heavenly life, a double benefit! 

This is comparable to a path that leads to a route 
.. 

that divides like a crotch where a person goes through 
the main path and attends a marriage in one division of the crotch, 
.. 

retracts and attends another marriage in another division

It's funny when a feller wants to do his little bit,
And wants to wear a uniform and lug a soldier's kit,
And ain't afraid of submarines nor mines that fill the sea,
They will not let him go along to fight for liberty
They make him stay at home and be his mother's darling pet,
But you can bet there'll come a time when they will want me yet.

I want to lick the Kaiser good, and do the job up right.
I know the way to use a gun and I can dig a trench
And I would like to go and help the English and the French.
But no, they say, you cannot march away to stirring drums;
Be mother's angel boy at home; stay there and twirl your thumbs.

I've read about the daring boys that fight up in the sky;
It seems to me that that must be a splendid way to die.
I'd like to drive an aeroplane and prove my courage grim
And get above a German there and drop a bomb on him,
But they won't let me go along to help the latest drive;
They say my mother needs me here because I'm only five


To serve my country day by day
At any humble post I may;
To honor and respect her flag,
To live the traits of which I brag;
To be American in deed
As well as in my printed creed.

To stand for truth and honest toil,
To till my little patch of soil,
And keep in mind the debt I owe
To them who died that I might know
My country, prosperous and free,
And passed this heritage to me.

I always must in trouble's hour
Be guided by the men in power;
No act of mine that men may scan
Must shame the name American.

To do my best and play my part,
American in mind and heart;
To serve the flag and bravely stand
To guard the glory of my land;
To be American in deed:

I'd like to be the sort of man 
the flag could boast about;
I'd like to be the sort of man 
it cannot live without;
I'd like to be the type of man
That really is American:
The head-erect and shoulders-square,
Clean-minded fellow, just and fair,
That all men picture when they see
The glorious banner of the free.

I'd like to be the sort of man 
the flag now typifies,
The kind of man we really want 
the flag to symbolize;
The loyal brother to a trust,
The big, unselfish soul and just,
The friend of every man oppressed,
The strong support of all that's best,
The sturdy chap the banner's meant,
Where'er it flies, to represent.

I'd like to be the sort of man 
the flag's supposed to mean,
The man that all in fancy see 
wherever it is seen,
The chap that's ready for a fight
Whenever there's a wrong to right,
The friend in every time of need,
The doer of the daring deed,
The clean and generous handed man
That is a real American. 

TWO boats with nets lying off the sea-beach, quite still,
   Ten fishermen waiting--they discover a thick school of mossbonkers--
         they drop the join'd seine-ends in the water,
   The boats separate and row off, each on its rounding course to the
         beach, enclosing the mossbonkers,
   The net is drawn in by a windlass by those who stop ashore,
   Some of the fishermen lounge in their boats, others stand ankle-deep
         in the water, pois'd on strong legs,
   The boats partly drawn up, the water slapping against them,
   Strew'd on the sand in heaps and windrows, well out from the water,
         the green-back'd spotted mossbonkers.

'I've never seen such a thing, '
The reluctant diner was heard to mutter
When first offered a sandwich
Of pickles and peanut butter.

'Trying new foods, ' she thought, 
'Isn't usually my style, '
But her first cautious bite
Was followed by a big smile.

'Eating PBP's is a treat.
Talking about them will be fun, '  
Said the new PBP fan
As she asked for another one

there's a peace kept gently cupped in my hands
a tiny, living, breathing peace
a solitary, intrinsic peace
kept alive by my heartbeat and my hope

a piece of an as-of-yet untold tomorrow
a piece of sunshine and unfulfilled justice
that every man, woman, and child
holds cradled in their hands

a piece of a worldly, blood-weary peace


When I wake up from my bed in the morning
My saturate eyes open slowly and welcomes the morning sun
Then I feel warm and comfortable at peace of mind
The morning smell of the earth reminds me my childhood
The wetness of flora brings me cool breeze.
I was born in this universe with peaceful nature around me
Then, I always felt that I was a star on my own brightness.
Learned, the love and kindness brings me a peace of mind
Learned, the help for helpless brings me a peace of mind
Learned, the life of peace brings me a peace of mind
When my saturate eyes close slowly and welcomes the silent night 
to have another peaceful day. 

They found you
at the shelter - 
skin and bone.  
A beautiful Vizla, 
pedigree pure
and aching
for love.

They called you Max.

Always a follower 
(Nicholas took all the bones)      
your rubbery mouth
would crumple
as you lay -
all legs and love -
on the couch.

When Nicholas died
you were lost. 
Then Sam arrived
and gave you permission
to follow
again.

They removed
the tumour a few years ago
(a third of your body weight)      
and the very next day
you were down at the park, 
burnished coat gleaming, 
bursting with life.

Today they took you
to the vet
for the last time.
You were seventeen years old. 

Goodnight my sweet darling Kira of light
and let's end this night before my long
trip snuggling and kissing in loving peace, 
come slide into bed right next 
to your loyal and ever loving man.
and in spirit let's go to bed
and share some sweet kisses with the most peaceful of snuggles.
I love you dear Kira and want you forever right by me.

A peaceful goodnight to you my sweet Angel dove
and as we lay down let's just cozy up, 
we'll just softly talk while I stroke your hair
and lovingly rub your back while we drift, 
I'll give you sweet kisses throughout
while I give you all of my caring and loving warmth.
I love you sweet Kira my only one
and I want a peaceful goodnight of sleep
I love you my darling and you're everything
I'll ever truly want and need.

Goodnight my peaceful Angel of light
and I'll see you in our sweet dreams tonight, 
just lying together snuggling and talking
like the way that we used too which is one thing
I am so dearly and painfully missing, 
a dream where you aren't upset hurt
or angry at your sorrowful and faithful Michael.
A place like in real life where I will
and can just hold you so closely drying your tears
and say in person I am so very sorry
and heal our hearts with the kisses we're needing.
It will happen my darling I truly promise
but tonight in our dreams I'll just hold you
right next to me telling you that
everything is going to be fine and okay, 
I'm going to hold you so you'll know that 
you're Michael is always right here and with you.

A peaceful goodnight to you my dear beautiful Kira
and let's go to bed and you can help me
forget the stresses of tomorrows travel for a little while, 
come for a peaceful snuggle because I just want
to spend time with my sweet Angel Kira
and tell you that you are a treasured diamond.
and remember your Michael will never leave you
because in every way I truly love you.
Goodnight Kira my sweet dove you are a treasure
and I cherish you darling because you are amazing. 

They will obliterate past words of love
In actual fact, they'll destroy every line.
Love is over, there's no affection
As age and wisdom combine! 
The truth is suddenly dawning. 
They need the affair no more.
All they seek is 'a peaceful life'
With loved ones from days of yore.
They will burn all the old love letters
Although this seems so very unkind; 
But they must ignore fancy words of love
And quickly obliterate every line. 

Grateful i am and appreciate too
however deep i lie in the burden of the ocean. 

with every change
of tide i do not change my want, rather i choose
to stay fixed in my dream and calm in my head and 
heart, waiting in my shell for the storm to blow up
and my right desire to become true to the best
in me-  pearl by ways hidden from my senses. 

An oyster first forms a pearl 
from the irritation of a single grain of sand.
It's never placed by mistake inside you see

Like so many things in man's own life
those irritants that we sometimes feel.
No different than the oysters grain of sand
but to us, much more irritating to deal.

in-order that we all might learn.
To form the pearls we need to form
to place in the crowns, of which we've earned. 

Iago Prytherch his name, though, be it allowed,
Just an ordinary man of the bald Welsh hills,
Who pens a few sheep in a gap of cloud.
Docking mangels, chipping the green skin
From the yellow bones with a half-witted grin
Of satisfaction, or churning the crude earth
To a stiff sea of clods that glint in the wind—
So are his days spent, his spittled mirth
Rarer than the sun that cracks the cheeks
Of the gaunt sky perhaps once in a week.
And then at night see him fixed in his chair
Motionless, except when he leans to gob in the fire.
There is something frightening in the vacancy of his mind.
His clothes, sour with years of sweat
And animal contact, shock the refined,
But affected, sense with their stark naturalness.
Yet this is your prototype, who, season by season
Against siege of rain and the wind's attrition,
Preserves his stock, an impregnable fortress
Not to be stormed, even in death's confusion.
Remember him, then, for he, too, is a winner of wars,
Enduring like a tree under the curious stars.




A pebble in the street corner
lay washed by the sun.
The builder
piled a stone upon stone.
The pebble was lost
in the gravel.
Long back
'For the road'
The builder ground it.
The pebble was dust. 

Dust always blowing about the town,
Except when sea-fog laid it down,
And I was one of the children told
Some of the blowing dust was gold.

All the dust the wind blew high
Appeared like god in the sunset sky,
But I was one of the children told
Some of the dust was really gold.

Such was life in the Golden Gate:
Gold dusted all we drank and ate,
And I was one of the children told,
'We all must eat our peck of gold.

'What thou thinkest, belongs to all; what thou feelest, is thine only.

For Reverend Theodore Richardson

If Mary came would Mary   
Forgive, as Mothers may,   
And sad and second Saviour   
Furnish us today?

She would not shake her head and leave   
This military air,
But ratify a modern hay,
And put her Baby there.

Mary would not punish men—
If Mary came again. 

Who low dejected at thy footstool lies. 
Let not the clamour of my heinous sin 
Drown my requests, which strive to enter in 
At those bright gates, which alwaies open stand 
To such as beg remission at thy hand. 
Too well I know, if thou in rigour deal 
I can nor pardon ask, nor yet appeal: 
To my hoarse voice, heaven will no audience grant, 
But deaf as brass, and hard as adamant 
Beat back my words; therefore I bring to thee 
A gracious Advocate to plead for me. 
What though my leprous soul no Jordan can 
Recure, nor flouds of the lav'd Ocean 
Make clean? yet from my Saviours bleeding side 
Two large and medicinable rivers glide. 
And new Bethesdaes flow from ev'ry wound. 
If I this precious Lather may obtain, 
I shall not then despair for any stain; 
I need no Gileads balm, nor oyl, nor shall 
I for the purifying Hyssop call: 
My spots will vanish in His purple flood, 
And Crimson there turn white, though washt with blood. 
How I address my humble suit to Thee; 
O give that suit admittance to thy ears 
Which floats to thee not in my words but tears: 
And let my sinful soul this mercy crave 
Before I fall into the silent grave. 

I’m not good at reading silence.
Sometimes what’s not said
says way more than what is. 

I almost don’t want to know.
I’m afraid it’ll be hurtful, 
but it’s something I need to hear. 

How about a penny 
for your thoughts? 

Would five or six cents
spare me lies? 

Do two nickels 
sweeten the pot, 
or perhaps three dimes
for two or three honest thoughts? 

Okay, just one then.
I’ll even up it to a dollar
for one clear, loving thought, 
that’s all I want
- it’s all I need, 
but it has to be the truth.

I would never tell you this, 
but you could have me 
and everything I own
if, just for once, 
you told me the truth. 

Abraham, you are about to undergo a "tail lift", 
You replaced the Indian penny in  
And for your centennial, your tail
is going to have a contemporary design, 
The almost worthless penny adds up to
Useless dollars soon all replaced debit/credit cards
Copper is at a premium, so what it cost to strike your image, 
Isn't worth the cost.
Oh Abraham, Jefferson, Roosevelt, Washington, Kennedy, 
And soon to be Jefferson, 
There is no numerical number placed, 
To designate
What fraction thereof a dollar the coin may be.

Any day could be a perfect day

Oh! the perfect ethnic cleanser, 
You've no ethics, 
Remained as an agent of eternity, 
And an excellent janitor of population, 
You've no colour, cast or creed
Without any shape or smell you come, 
But with a ritual, 
That to take me with you
Without respect for my permission.

He was a perfect gent, 
Who having thus been lent, 
This, Oh such precious key, 
With which to view a property, 
Which he hoped she might like to buy. 
She'd deemed him a lovely guy.

He was a perfect gent, 
Who seemed to be intent, 
On making so sure that she, 
Felt absolutely free, 
To look around the place, 
And, perhaps, consider it her base.

He was a perfect gent, 
Who seemed to be content, 
To follow just behind
Her, whilst she was thus inclined, 
To take her time to survey, 
Each room along the way.

He was a perfect gent, 
Who smiled at her and sent, 
A shiver, down her spine, 
Which to her was quite divine, 
Leaving her with a special kind, 
Of fascination, in her mind.

He was a perfect gent, 
Who hoped that she'd consent, 
To become his future wife, 
And to travel so, through life, 
Hoping too, that this property, 
Would hold the vital key.

He was a perfect gent, 
Who in the time they spent
Together, in this prime location, 
Made her feel such wild elation, 
That, standing entranced by his side, 
She consented to become his bride.

She comes in — walking with heavy steps.  

She walks in with naturally curly hair hiding her face — hiding her eyes.
There she sits — First row, third seat on the right, Like always. 
She sets her black 'the Beatles' backpack down on the floor. 
Choked on silence.  

Suffocating with her own words.  

Smothered by her own thoughts. Time is stretching.  

Something is killing her inside! Deep inside — it's killing her! ! She now takes a few breaths before taking her breakfast and iphone out of her backpack — Big chunks of oranges and apples for breakfast in a Tupperware.  

She checks her phone & goes through the photos posted on Instagram just to find a way out — hoping to find something that would keep her mind off. .  Shitty Things keeping her mind busy! —those damn thoughts are disconnecting her from her surroundings! 
She opens the Tupperware and picks a piece of apple and slowly puts it in her mouth — Mouth tastes of sick stomach twisting inside, she seems to have difficulty swallowing.  

But I don't know what to do or what to say. . 

I promise, 
You are the only one for me, 
And though it pains my heart, 
To love you, 
Know this, 
There is no other pain, 
I would rather feel.(The man who wants the perfect wife should marry a
'stock-size.' She comes cheaper.-_London Chronicle_.)

Ah, Myrtilla, woe and dear me!
  Lackadaydee and alas!
What is this, I greatly fear me,
          That has come to pass?

Craving, as I do, perfection,
  Loathing anything like flaws,
I must raise a slight objection
          To your building laws.

You are five one-and-a-quarter,
  And your girth is thirty-three-
Myrtie, you're a little shorter
          Than you ought to be.

It is far from my intentions
  Your proportions to describe,
Briefly, Myrtie, your dimensions
          Do not seem to jibe.

Farewell, Myrt, for Ethelisa
  Seems to be my certain fate,
Stupid? Silly? Sure, but she's a
          Perfect thirty-eight. 

What is perfection? 
You mean precision
Accuracy in action
Or planning in anticipation

Nobody is perfect
Good ideas to inject
Never say no or reject
Observe minutely the object

It may look different
It may not look apparent
There may be under current
Danger is always inherent

Master the art
Have good beginning or start
Dress up well and look smart
Integrate, neat well and be part

Come up with new innovation
Try come out of suffocation
Breathe fresh air with good intake
Recover the lost ground and retake

Earn the name and feel no shame
There is always prestige with good name
Nothing will go wrong or slide away
You may fine it in right way

Try to address it in well manner
You need no platform or good banner
Good manner and perfection will do it all
You will receive tumultuous welcome and call

Try to perfect with near perfection
You need not but may speak your action
it has nothing to do with lengthy speech
You may have all the chance on top to reach


I asked the mountain
You are very strong
you will exist till the end of creation

The mountain replied numbly 
No, Nay, not so
the water can flow me and
convert me to a plain land
then my existence will vanish

I asked the rock
no one can melt you
the rock also replied numbly
No, Nay not so
the water can melt me
and I will be no more

I asked the trees
the water will destroy you
the tree replied
No, Nay not so
it shall irrigate me and
give me life

I asked each and every creatures
all replied
water is more soft, more rich
and more strong
it can destroy and  give life too
it can quench thirst of all
and give life to all

I asked the Water
You are soft and mild
You are rich and strong too

The water replied
No, Nay not so
I may be dried at any time

It is poetry, 
a perpetual stream of sacred consciousness 
flowing ever and ever
beyond the stars and planets and
even beyond plenty of universe

The Poetry can save me and

I am person non-grata for the activities carried on
Not by state for illegal activities but for good work done
But by my own people for delivering good
As I was coming in their way and solidly stood? 

It is birth right to stand for real freedom
Not by thoughts but for action with wisdom
There is no use of sending people to face bullets
The war has to be won over by only ballets

I have nothing to loose but nothing gain too
It has been know fact and very true
Many forewarned me of dire consequences
I was still prepared for any bad sequences

Many futile attempts were made on me physically
I was not at all against them basically
There was wide ranging difference in approach
I was not at all preferred to them as coach

There are deliberate clashes in defined areas
There complete unawareness for repeated pleas
It has been taken as weakness and cowardice act
We can only use only possible means to react

No one should seriously take on struggle
They are for peaceful agitation and unarmed people
What do we do to strengthen their peaceful cause? 
Can’t they think positive and maintain relative pause? 

How many may be prepared to shed their lives? 
Who will honestly make attempt or seriously strive? 
This is not for one man to think or decide
The perceptional difference is very wide

Let us build a healthy union
Make all the attempts for good lien
Let us build it together as one force
No ill feelings, bitterness or remorse


There is no one who has collected toll charges 
-after allowing somebody to trespass the pathway; 

Likewise, no one could collect the charges for the
.  

travel in a boat after it reaches the destination! 

Similarly, a person who could not learn 
-as and when he is young and youthful, 

Can you say he can learn during old age
-and become knowledgeable and efficient

A person who does not skip moral values 
-in all the time shall attain the following 

characteristic eight elegant attributes, namely
- the birth of high quality trait, 

long life, wealth, glistening beauty, 
-rightful land, supremacy for his words, 

education, health without any 
-inflicting disease respectively

A person who doesn’t earn sufficient wealth 
-in due time when he is physically young and fit 
that keeps the mind clean and satisfactory, 

He is at par with a blind shepherd selecting the long 
-dark pathless forest into which he plans to make 
the herd to graze for food; thereby he can’t return! 

Hence, as a matter of fact  that person does not deserve; 
-he will not desire to undertake any virtuous activities; 
He is the person hated by the assembly of men around! 

He provides himself a place for all venomous character; 
-He is such a person with nature of mean mentality; 
And he is not liked and respected by anybody

Set the personal goal and try to scale new heights
Never get burdened with more worries and weights
Nothing can discourage you from achieving it
You may always think positive and remain fit

You must think of doing always good
It must serve you as nourishing food
Everything must move and go in planned way
You must stick to pint and hold the sway

It is highly improper on our part to neglect
We should be careful to choose or select
Even people’s representative must be chosen to elect
This must be made known as simple fact

You may go down in history as coward
There won’t be any prize or reward
You should think of future and go ahead
You must provide leadership and lead

There is nothing impossible in this world
Try to live with warm relation and not cold
Have complete harmony with neighbors
Don’t bear ill will or encourage to harbor

There can’t be escape from our responsibility
We have developed skill and have the capability
It needs for sight and clear vision
Only timely action needed with decision

What are we trying to achieve for? 
Is it only personal interest in store? 
Do we seek and fight only for gain? 
Is there no other way to reduce the pain? 

How many may be reaching to the safety? 
It may take for them whole life to reach fifty
There won’t be left any more charm
There might have been taken some recourse for harm
 
It has to be step forward with clear aim
No tall promises and unnecessary claims
Clear the way of all hurdles and offer the blow
It may then be the way open for us to grow


Nothing can be easily achieved
Hardship can only be believed
No one may come to your rescue
You must get everything whichever is due

Lay the seize open and open the new avenue
Earn enough from it as reward and revenue
It has to generate enough to sustain the growth
Success and fame may come to you as both

Every individual may form strong chain
There efforts may never go in vain
Momentarily there will be set back and pain
It must be understood clearly as fact very plain

Don’t leave the scene before you get on stage
You must be prepared for struggle to wage
Try to cut it as hard as possible for relief
Strengthen the move with strong belief


In the old movies, 
The women wore
Skirts and dresses.

Marilyn Monroe, 
In "River of No Return", 
Had on tight blue jeans.

Mom wore dresses.
(Did women have legs, 
Or were they
Like mermaids under there? 
And why did they leave
a toilet full of blood, sometimes?) 
In the mid ‘
She got some tight pants, 
With green, vertical lines
And some kind of flower pattern.

She had legs, and an ass.
(toosie, she'd taught us to call it, 
A word that sounds like a cushion.) 
I felt embarrassed when she wore them.

Then she got a denim skirt.
"It looks like blue jeans! "
Said my brother Fred.
It did, with stitched, white 
Pockets on the rear.

I felt I’d die, that eyes, 
My own included, 
Would rivet on Mother’s ass.

Blue jeans were for boys.
(Our mythologies, they say, 
Determine how we dress—
In this case, how our parents
Dressed us, after the War, 
In cities and in suburbs, 
Little cowboys everywhere, 
Kicking soccer balls
And sliding slides, 
Who’d never plowed a field
Or herded cows.
I fantasized of boys, back then, 
For blue jeans x-rayed bodies
With their pockets 
And their rivets
And their stitches.
"This is beyond
Naked, " I’d say to myself, 
Wondering "Why isn’t it
Against the law? "
Of course, I never asked aloud.) 

And then, in junior high, 
One shapely girl
started wearing 
Tight blue jeans.
She found the secret first.
(Maybe she’d seen
"River of No Return".) 

Today, half the women
Who walk into the coffee shop
Are clad in that blue intrigue.

After years of contemplation, 
My mind still cannot penetrate
The intrigue and the mystery

Or dethrone the mythology
Of those streamlined bodies

That help to bring my world alive, 
though clothed
In its illusions. 

Life, they say, if full of wonder; 
Mine is full of storm and thunder.

Life, they say, is a tuneful song; 
Shrieks discordant mine do throng.

Life, they say, with honey drips; 
Mine, my tears is made to sip.

Life, they say, in nectar wades; 
Sunk in poison mine is laid.

Life, they say, is heavenly bliss; 
Mine is mobbed by snakes that hiss.

Life, they say, is paeans' surge; 
Mine is but a woeful dirge. 

To spring belongs the violet, and the blown 
Spice of the roses let the summer own. 
Grant me this favor, Muse--all else withhold-- 
That I may not write verse when I am old.

And yet I pray you, Muse, delay the time! 
Be not too ready to deny me rhyme; 
And when the hour strikes, as it must, dear Muse, 
I beg you very gently break the news. 

I pray to be the tool which to your hand
Long use has shaped and moulded till it be
Apt for your need, and, unconsideringly,
You take it for its service. I demand
To be forgotten in the woven strand
Which grows the multi-coloured tapestry
Of your bright life, and through its tissues lie
A hidden, strong, sustaining, grey-toned band.
I wish to dwell around your daylight dreams,
The railing to the stairway of the clouds,
To guard your steps securely up, where streams
A faery moonshine washing pale the crowds
Of pointed stars. Remember not whereby
You mount, protected, to the far-flung sky.(Karl Popper ( .

Indeed it was you, Karl, who left Vienna
not a moment too soon, as it turned out, 
and also, on occasions, science in Dunedin.
You must have wondered at the Southern Alps.
Did your mind soar  across the Dinaric Alps
to Plato's Greece? You did a demolition job
on 'The Republic' of the closed society.

You drew a line in the sand convincingly, 
between science and pseudo-science, astrology.
and I find that your third world of knowledge
extends mind and matter to their products.
But tell me, did you find in the Deep South
an open society, or too many of its enemies? 

    -May, 

heroes are not easy to come by
heroic acts are a different story.
heroism a flag bestowed unfurled
live in the annals of moral sacrifice.

spilled his guts saving lives of others
courage to suffer and still carry on, 
most heroically did so in silence
oh hero hero who do not cry out

his or her deeds carried by waves, 
of ethics moral and agreed upon, 
live on by consensus annd canon
of each era, we salute you one and all

Oh dear me! is a Nazi soldier a hero
who gave his life for his comrades
of a diseased inhuman ideology
a hero too? 

are not women who suffer daily
selflessly help their children grow up
not heroes of heroic heroism
suffer the yoke and burden of a warped society

are not the accidents of genetic mishaps heroes, 
heroes of statistics and those of accidents, 
and those of injustice heroes, 
of paying the price of survival for other regarding

Oh my kind listeners come tell me one and all
is this philosophy not far fetched and lopsided
and there is no such concept called hero, 
take your medals put them under your pillows

take the stories and legends, myths and magic
are the fancy of the narrator pleasant to listen
and muse of sacrifice and other regarding
acts so noble and fascinating of wonder and admire

still there are some that are more heroic if only by
comparison indelible in our memory for ages to come


Don’t ever complain –
	‘They use me’
Let them use.
What are you born for, else? 

If a time comes, 
They plan to throw or throw! 
Take your position
Now, it’s your theater.

Show is on - you are a performer
Since beginning.
It’s up to you, how much you reach
From that stage, to the audience.

The more you make sound
You will be read
The more you are silent
The show is on and you can read.

The telephone is melting
The wife's been on all day; 
I need to get a call made
But don't know how to say.

How can I gently hint at
My need, without offence? 
I see the eyes, that steely stare, 
The pressure is immense.

I could go to the call-box
But out, it's pouring down, 
And anyway, why should I? 
Oh come on Mrs Brown! 

Still open lies the phone-book
Which she don't really need, 
She knows the numbers off by heart
And whacks them in at speed.

By now I feel a victim
I glance, and she's on still; 
I'd only be five minutes, 
And, Hey, I pay the bill! 

But even so she natters on
As if next week will do, 
So I make for the kitchen
To have yet another brew.

Then just as I am leaving, 
My eyes a 'bulge and red, 
It's then she hands it over, and guess what? 
The battery's dead. 

I'm just pixels, yeah, I know.
I'm nothing but, a photo.
I'm just a picture, from head to toe.
I'm just pixels, let me go.

I'm just pixels, I'm just fake.
I'm just a picture, a mistake.
I'm just a photo, I'm not real.
I'm nothing but a good ideal. 

I'm a loser, I'm not fun. 
I'm not smart, I'm just dumb.
I'm in front of a green screen.
I'm pixel perfect, from a dream.

I'm not real, imaginary.
I'm as real as the tooth fairy.
I'm just pixels, from head to toe.
I'm nothing but, 
A photo. 

A PHOTO OF AN OLD GRAVE (Courtesy of Danny Reynolds) 

This was once 
a very grand grave, 
Very, very, old, 
but still standing. 

Surrounded 
by carved stone fencing, 
headed off 
by an ornate Gothic cross. 

But now unattended 
for scores of years, 
there is a new mourner. 

Inside the rectangle, 
a tree has sprouted, 
and been allowed to grow. 

The main stem, erupting 
from where the head would lay. 
The roots drawing 
from the nutrients below. 

When I look at this scene, 
I feel pity and joy in equal parts, 
as I sense both neglect 
.  

and resurrection. 

So.
Do graveyards need a license 
for their poet-magnets?

Wise men I hold those rakes of old 
Who, as we read in antique story, 
When lyres were struck and wine was poured, 
Set the white Death's Head on the board- 
Memento mori. 

Love well! love truly! and love fast! 
True love evades the dilatory. 
Life's bloom flares like a meteor past; 
A joy so dazzling cannot last 
Memento mori. 

Stop not to pluck the leaves of bay 
That greenly deck the path of glory, 
The wreath will wither if you stay, 
So pass along your earnest way 
Memento mori. 

Hear but not heed, though wild and shrill, 
The cries of faction transitory; 
Cleave to your good, eschew your ill, 
A Hundred Years and all is still 
Memento mori. 

When Old Age comes with muffled drums, 
That beat to sleep our tired life's story, 
On thoughts of dying, (Rest is good!) 
Like old snakes coiled i' the sun, we brood- 
Memento mori. 

Sometime I wish I had a piano
In a long list of wishes may be another addition
Or if my pen was a piano key
On lazy afternoons of summer
When touched softly
Its music would break the silence of this room
The languid humming of air conditioner
Would mellow in its sweet sound
The colors esoteric in nature
Ascending through air reaching to empyrean
Would shower upon me in sweet paean
I do laugh at the idea though
The trill coming out of the keys
Would probably be as smudged and muddled
As the writing coming out of this pen
Backed only with a dull desire or inclination to write
When would I realize that the pen or the piano key
Both are substitute for my inability
To sit quiet and enjoy the stillness. 

I sat down for a picnic
and wondered
what I could spread on my bread
and soon an idea came by; 
and so with my left hand
I shooed away the fly
and with my right
spread evenly the butter


A picture on the wall
A captured moment of yesterday
A stolen moment of a person's life
Click and a life is stilled
Click and a life is immortal

Those were the days
When you said you were happy
Filled to the brim with love
Those captured moments of yesterday

Click and your sparkling smile was captured
Click and a stolen moment of your love
Forever held in time
Never to be forgotten
Now just a picture on the wall(You supply the pictures!)  

I get to meditate
in a chair! 
Or against the wall
with my legs
stretched out! 
(Or even in bed!)  

I get to see
maybe half
of what I'm looking at! 
(This changes everything!)  

I get to dance
like the tipsy old men
I adored
when I was an infant! 
(They never dropped me!)  

I get to spend time with myself 
whenever I want! 
I get to ride a bicycle
with tall
handlebars! 
(My posture improves!)  

I get to give up
learning to sail! 
I get to know
I will never speak
German! 

I get to snuggle all
morning
with  my snuggler
of choice:
counting the hours
by how many times
we get up
to pee! 

I get to spend time with myself
whenever I want! 
I get to eat chocolate
with my salad.
Or even as a first course! 
I get to forget! 
I get to paint
with colors
I mix myself! 
Colors
I've never seen
before.

I get to sleep
with my dog
& pray never to outlive
my cat! 
I get to play
music
without reading
a note! 

I get to spend time with myself
whenever I want! 
I get to sleep
in a
hammock
under the same
stars
wherever I am! 
I get to spend time with myself
whenever I want! 

I get to laugh
at all the things
I don't know
& cannot
find! 

I get to greet
people I don't remember
as if I know them
very well.
After all, how different
can they be? 

I get to grow
my entire
garden
in a few
pots! 
I get to spend time with myself
whenever I want! 

I get to see
& feel
the suffering
of the whole
world
& to take
a nap
when I feel
like it
anyway! 

I get to spend time with myself
whenever I want! 

I get to feel
more love
than I ever thought
existed! 
Everything appears to be made
of the stuff! 

I feel this
especially for You!  Though I may not remember
exactly which You
you are! 
How cool is this! 
Still, I get to spend time with myself
whenever I want! 
And that is just a taste
as the old people used to say
down in Georgia
when I was a child
of what you get
for getting old.

Reminding us, as they witnessed our curiosity about them, that no matter the losses, there's something fabulous going on at every stage of Life, something to let go of, maybe, but for darn sure, something to get

A Piece of Chalk

Why is there no talk
About a piece of chalk? 
There is always a lot of chit and chat
About money, war, and stuff like that.
A piece of chalk is important too.
Don't act like this idea is new to you! 
A piece of chalk is not simple, 
Unlike the stock market or your pimple.
You can't understand a piece of chalk, 
Or why cows can't downstairs walk.
This tiny piece of chalk is so complex, 
Like long division and a tyrannosaurus rex.
But, this does not seem to matter to the earth.
You only care about your precious death and birth.
Chalk has importance of its very own-
More important than a virus or a home equity loan.
The next time you see a piece of chalk, 
Notice its value and start to talk. 

a piece of flesh 
in the body
if it becomes good
the whole body becomes good
if it gets spoilt
the whole body gets spoilt
that is the heart


I walk through snowy avenue
nobody there, just a glance of you
darling, when you realize what I am
to your life and to your freedom

I stop under corner lamps
they twinkle like Summer stars
darling, when you really miss me
into your love, I beg a chance's key

I stare at shadowy branches
they sway like ballerina's dances
darling, where you put your hope
suddenly I can't pull destiny's rope

I smile to eerie ravens
nothing else matters
darling, where you bury bravery
surprisingly I can't erase memory

to you I just a piece of ice
I melt in front of river's eyes
to you I just a piece of ice
I thaw under mountain's flames

to you, I just a piece of ice
I plunge inside sea breeze
to you, I just a piece of ice
I drown into dawn skies

On the dinning table
Not for the sake of a meal
Though the aroma of dinner
Lingers on the table 
And the reeks oozing from my breath
I am looking at my diaries.

Suddenly a piece of paper
Flew away under the table
A paper I would have dismissed casually
With my own handwriting
Showing its cursive scripts
What If  it was not useful to me? 
It would absolutely have 
Been useful to those who
Wrap wraps of hem
And make the youth stray their way
Or make a paper watch for liittle Nathan
To clad his naked wrist 
If they saw it before me.

I am joyous
I saw it before them
With my own handwriting
Bearing  'the great hills'a poem
Penned to the delight of most. 

No one can own a color; no one can own a cloud.
No one on Earth could ever, I'm glad it's not allowed! 
No person owns a person, though some may think they do.
No person owns the ocean; I know this to be true! 
I cannot own a sparrow, I cannot own a tree.
Even in my own backyard they don't belong to me! 
No one can own the starlight; no one can own the sun.
No person owns a river, it simply can't be done! 
No one can own a desert, the planets or their moons.
We’re all just One Race: Human, same words with many tunes! 
No one may claim ownership to TEAR or SMILE or SIGH! 
Or take away your DREAMS so.  

The Lives and Times of John Keats,
    Percy Bysshe Shelley, and

  Byron and Shelley and Keats
  Were a trio of Lyrical treats.
The forehead of Shelley was cluttered with curls,
And Keats never was a descendant of earls,
And Byron walked out with a number of girls,
But it didn't impair the poetical feats
  Of Byron and Shelley,
  Of Byron and Shelley,
Of Byron and Shelley and Keats. 

I'm standing between your stone pillars
With pain killers all over my chest.

I'm thinking of warmth
As my body runs cold
Inside my old-feeling bones.

As my wrists are torn
Each to his own
To support the helping hand.

On private land
Do my grieviances grow.

Sweet bitterness of the cold
That flows inside will unveil
In more detail how

And right now
A man is weak at a woman's touch.

Such women be friends
'Till silent end
of secret's keep

And now I know
Before I sleep 
That I possess

A friend indeed.
He is she when his touch 
Is gentle yet effective

Irrespective of his masculine nature.
He is mine and yours
with a little wine

Then everyone's
Under the sun 

And the son
Of Ireshire can see

Something that no one
Yet can say
From june 'till next  may.

He is no fool
No father neither is he
not even to me. 

Wait, now I see
A pillar of salt
A pillar of pain.

I'm willing to die
Or cry or try

Anything so that 
Our friendship will remain. 

Three hundred and twenty years in the making.
Lovers have met 
Battles been fought, won and lost
And the afternoon heat
Has been endured here.
The King of the castle triumphed-
And was duly deposed here
Armies seen off
Defenders overwhelmed.
An enemy base
A home sanctuary.
Hitching post
Rendezvous, spaceship and monkey bars
Oh, and cuckoos have been heard here.
Countless hands, feet and tired posteriors have left their mark.
And it has left a mark in my heart, here.
The old tree trunk in the park. 

When a dream is born in you
With a sudden clamorous pain,
When you know the dream is true
And lovely, with no flaw nor stain,
O then, be careful, or with sudden clutch
You'll hurt the delicate thing you prize so much.

Dreams are like a bird that mocks,
Flirting the feathers of his tail.
When you seize at the salt-box,
Over the hedge you'll see him sail.
Old birds are neither caught with salt nor chaff:
They watch you from the apple bough and laugh.

Poet, never chase the dream.
Laugh yourself, and turn away.
Mask your hunger; let it seem
Small matter if he come or stay;
But when he nestles in your hand at last,
Close up your fingers tight and hold him fast. 

In religion we have doubters and these doubters stand their ground
looking wise and all confused because they are.
Let's remember Father Moses as he stood there, on the mound
gave his sermon and the echo carried far.
Come my children said the prophet and embrace your brothers too
let no odour turn your nostrils from your love, 
take commands not from your kind but from above.
Shun your hatred, help the poor and take the lame across the road
see the smile as it descends upon a face, 
hold your journey, smell those flowers, say hello to the small toad
be the leader and demand that we keep pace. 

Yo ho, me hearties
A pirate be I.

I swabbin' the deck
for a cappin' who lie.

Yo ho, me hearties
Ye scurvey dogs, ho! 

Ye walkin' the plank
For no'r'else t' go! 

I sit and I rot in the galley all day
cookin' up stews of mice and of hay

Yo ho, me hearties
Fine strumpets, play I.

For no loved up lass
be forgettin' my cry.

Yo ho, me hearties
Hear yon' bell ring two

I hang from the gallows
for not else to do

This pirate captain, years ago 

Decided, when his work got slow

He'ed turn to writing, poetic style

And soon amassed a major pile.

He made us think and made us smile; 

I think he was writing, all the while, uh huh. 

They amputated
Your thighs off my hips.
As far as I'm concerned 
They are all surgeons. All of them.

They dismantled us
Each from the other.
As far as I'm concerned
They are all engineers. All of them.

A pity. We were such a good
And loving invention.
An aeroplane made from a man and wife.
Wings and everything.
We hovered a little above the earth.

We even flew a little. 

I'm making a pizza the size of the sun,
a pizza that's sure to weigh more than a ton,
a pizza too massive to pick up and toss,
a pizza resplendent with oceans of sauce.

I'm topping my pizza with mountains of cheese,
with acres of peppers, pimentos, and peas,
with mushrooms, tomatoes, and sausage galore,
with every last olive they had at the store.

My pizza is sure to be one of a kind,
my pizza will leave other pizzas behind,
my pizza will be a delectable treat,
that all who love pizza are welcome to eat.

The oven is hot, I believe it will take
a year and a half for my pizza to bake.
I can hardly wait til my pizza is done,
my wonderful pizza the size of the sun. 

Finally you got to settle somewhere
Yu have no place to go anywhere
One can think of resting there
It is wonderful place with no fears

Whatever may be your deeds? 
Whatever may be your greed? 
You may have no worry to feed
You are taken away and freed

People wish heaven for you
I don’t know how far it is true? 
Why do we pray for peace in heaven? 
He has done nothing at all good even

We touch the feet and seek the blessings
There is something moral like missing
We were all the time at loggerheads
He used to be dreaded and we were afraid 

It is not satisfaction at al for his departure
We don’t heave a sigh of relief for future
He could do worst all in his tenure
We feared so much and were unsure

We still lay a wreath
That is last respect to death
You may be buried deep in the ground
The final peace is lastly found

It is burial ground
Complete peace and absolutely no sound
No one goes there for any round
Occasional offerings and flowers to be found

No one may wish to come here
Still it has to somewhere near
The journey may soon be taken
Even if your belief is shaken

It has to be borne in mind
You got to and will have to find
The journey may end soon
You will be brought here in night or noon

Wish all a happy good bye
You have now nothing left to buy
You may not see them in times to come
You place is fixed with rousing welcome


There's  a  place  beside  a  river  
That  you  might  know  as  well.
On  the  banks  we  call  contentment
Near  the  place  where  lovers  dwell.

It's  not  so  far  from  Heaven.
Though  it's  not  quite  that,  you  see.
There  must  be  a  place  for  lonely  
And  their  dreams  that  used  to  be.

It's  a  place  to  leave  our  sorrow.
And  a  place  to  not  regret.
A  place  that  gives  us  pleasure
In  our  sadness  even  yet.

Though  our  memories  often  linger
And  our  dreams  may  come  and  go, 
The  place  beside  the  river
Is  a  place  that  we  should  know.

So,  if  by  chance,  you  see  me  there  
In  a  memory  or  a  dream.
You'll  know  I've  found  contentment
In  the  water  of  the  stream. 

place called "home" is to feel homely, 
May be she is with all her elegance, 
Everything for sure and no pretence, 

Gently spoken words I hear, 
Sounds like music in my ear, 
Shivering cold run in spine, 
As if showing drunken state caused by wine, 

Mild walk around give melancholy voice, 
She is with me not becasuse of her choice, 
Always standing by and rendering advice, 
Suggesting the ways with utmost care to improvise, 

Bowing head with all weight on my solder and lean, 
Air to suggest fragrance and house almost neat and clean
"Life is so suggestive and perfect" does that mean? 
It seems half battle is over with clear perfect win, 

Home loses significance if she is not there? 
Without her no refuge and to go nowhere, 
Ideal place i shome to step in with peace of mind, 
Smiling at door to receive with gesture kind

All care is taken of with ease and no tension, 
Home in perfect condition and look as Manson, 
No clash of views even with slight reason, 
All days alike whether season or no season, 

With arrival of spring, flowers boom, 
All happiness in home and I always zoom, 
housing of toys all in single room, 
joy and only joy with trace of gloom, 

"Home" is an end of universe, 
Does not come as surprise and need to rehearse, 
It is place where even HE may prefer to stay, 
Heaven here, hell here, we need only to create the way


Some one reminded me of a place called hell
Lonely place where every one is doing well
All let loose strange stories around
No basis whatsoever or any images are found

No one may argue in favor of a hell
Generally all may not favor it at all
In their opinion they all did well to be in heaven
Though they have no faint idea even

They have done nothing to find place in this place
They did all whatever they could do to malign the race
At final time they decided to donate some tip of wealth
They knew it well at end of the game with deterioration in health

Some one may go even further to advocate
In the memory of parents some good steps they will indicate
Raising of temple or some orphanage in their name
At least this will save them for some shame

They have all praise for departed soul
The soul had lived noble life with no mistakes or foul
The end was imminent but this was only pause

The heaven has many exits and inlets
Only innocent and nobles are let
Rest all sent to very nice place called hell
There they will spend their life very well

So if some one is referring heaven we should take it for hell
All horrified stories are known to all but now no need to tell
Human ears are not used to hear unpleasant remarks
Though they praise dear ones with full marks

How the hell can be different from atmosphere? 
Why the people get afraid with so much fear? 
When it is known that only nice people with have entry? 
Rest all will be waiting in sun without shed of the tree

Well it is generally accepted that there is another world
Where there is no foe or friend or hot and cold
Everything is same and no difficulty at all
Still untruth may block it like wall

I fearlessly taught and advocated about good or bad
There is nothing to be felt as pain, agony or remain sad
The end may be peaceful and all set to depart
There may be found two gates painted with art

It will remind us of our past
The life might have been over very fast
It was now turn to pack up and say good bye
Even though we had lived happily with very good try


I was the proverbial busy bee
Up in the attic down on my knee

Brush the piano feed the hare.
Tend the home with loving care.

To the market now, hitch a ride.
Water the hollyhocks on the side.

The fence an lawn were my pride.
So the kids an my hubby's stride.

Walked at a clip an over the hill.
How fast it was I wonder still.

Surely sets to our east and west, 
At HOME here, a guess at best.

My glasses I broke on that sill, 
get em fixed, don't have the will.

No ones been to see me for days
My sis when called, said she prays

See my hands, he'd tenderly hold, 
gave me a solitaire, ringed in gold.

Wrinkled dry, parched with times.
Knobby; shakin, searching dimes.

Could you please do my bed? 
Could you nurse have me fed.

O' someone please do my shirts
Do someone, please draw the curts

We wet eyed rock an wait our turns
As nature cavorts an the candle burns

(April With tearful eyes I said my goodbyes  
To Aunt and Uncle, many years ago.
Their home was Jackson Tennessee
Where Pearl River waters floweth free.
Elvis~ a friendly potentate
Was their 'Rock-a-Billy' man so great, 
Now, in mid August of each year
The constellation of Jackson churches
Pay homage to that name so dear. 

There's a place I travel more these days
It's called, Memory Lane.
Visiting all the times, of memories stored
and reliving them over in my mind again.

It doesn't take much to trigger one up
they just seem to come at will.
Of places times and old forgotten faces
but my memory, remembers them clearly still.

The times my Mother hugged me
or the times she swatted my backside.
Of memories some painfull, but yet
they're those gaps of lifes, in-between filling lines.

They take you to some far off vision 
of what you thought was forgot.
But believe me when I tell you friend
they are just unraveling memories knots.

They'll hit you when least expected
like a wave rushing up to shore.
And then hang on, your in for the ride of your life! 
Because here comes one memory more! 

I never had these when I was young
because I think I was just making them.
I now love to go drive down memory lane
and then, drive back up again

How can I have a place within you? 
 I honestly care about your tender ways 
   Thinking your protection every moment 
    Loving every details of your life 

Understand whatever your past 
 Forgetting what lies around and behind you 
  I don’t mind what others ‘r saying 
   Just give me a little room upon you 

Waiting cannot last any longer 
 Because I will die early longing with you 
  Shortness of life is everlasting to me 
   If I had space in the kingdom of your heart
 
Where will I stay in the rest of my days? 
 To whom will I give my everlasting commitment? 
  If your heart is open only for a dot-sized 
   Will let me pass through a Place within 
    and open widely to flow like a stream of Love inside you

beautiful place in your heart is where I long to stay
Where the streets are quiet and I wouldn't stray faraway
Deep down inside your heart is where I long to hide
Faraway from my fears that kill me slowly from inside
Through the scenic boulevards in your heart, we'll walk
Listening to the lovely serenade of birds, as we talk

A dark place shaded in silhouettes of the loveliest night
Where I would feel warm and not die with extreme fright
A dark sky twinkling with so many innumerable, bright stars
That are blindingly shiny and unfolding memories like scars
Is where I desire against all odds, in your heart to dwell

A romantic place in your heart is where I truly desire
To live therein, like the flames would always in a fire
And make fine scenery of lovemaking like none would
Taking you higher, farer above the skies and the cloud
To a place where the angels would sing us sweet ballads
Eventually at the heavens where we are no longer ourselves


A grand building was built 
so that people could come to worship.
The cup of blood was forged out of gold
so that people would not mind drinking
it in the early hours of the morning.
A melodic song was written 
so that a band could be placed
in the back of the church
to make sure that everyone was entertained.
Donuts were bought for after mass
so that this church could be a socializing community.
All of this money spent sickens me.
All of the Catholics condone this behavior.
I have even heard them say how beautiful the church is.
This is why I can not be amongst you anymore.
I choose to worship alone in a place that is pure, 
my heart. 

I have no where to go
I have strong desire it to forgo
I did grave mistake to miss the chances
You can sight many instances

You can term it as misfortune
It has taken me out of tune
I am unable to synchronize with the new change
The time is running out with the age

I have decided to go away for the good
I was completely running out of food
It is tragic that I failed on all the fronts
I wish not indulge in bad things and confront

I shall return to the nest
My next attempt will be very best
It may not be all together different
But the change will be definitely apparent

I have written commitment towards you
The phase was bad and it was to be passed through
I have failed to carry it honestly
But had made as good attempt earnestly

I ill strong will power to last it long
I may be right or wrong
It is still burning desire
I shall come out of the fire

I shall come back to rule the scene
It may be great success previously not seen
I know it is difficult to come out of it
I have still will power and feel very fit

The individual has to be careful in planning
It may be unfavorable in the beginning
It is undaunting task to make it favorable and shine
It may look different and fine 

Leave it not to fate
You may find the result very late
Try love and not to hate
Put your views assertively and clearly state

There is no warning rattle at the door   
nor heavy feet to stomp the foyer boards.   
Safe in the dark prison, I know that   
light slides over
the fingered work of a toothless   
woman in Pakistan.
Happy prints of
an invisible time are illumined.   
My mouth agape
rejects the solid air and
lungs hold. The invader takes   
direction and
seeps through the plaster walls.   
It is at my chamber, entering   
the keyhole, pushing
through the padding of the door.   
I cannot scream. A bone
of fear clogs my throat.
It is upon me. It is
sunrise, with Hope
its arrogant rider.
My mind, formerly quiescent
in its snug encasement, is strained
to look upon their rapturous visages,   
to let them enter even into me.   
I am forced
outside myself to
mount the light and ride joined with Hope.

Through all the bright hours   
I cling to expectation, until   
darkness comes to reclaim me
as its own. Hope fades, day is gone   
into its irredeemable place
and I am thrown back into the familiar   
bonds of disconsolation.
Gloom crawls around
lapping lasciviously
between my toes, at my ankles,   
and it sucks the strands of my   
hair. It forgives my heady   
fling with Hope. I am
joined again into its
greedy arms. 

No idle gold -- since this fine sun, my friend, 
Is no mean miser, but doth freely spend.

No prescious stones -- since these green mornings show, 
Without a charge, their pearls where'er I go.

No lifeless books -- since birds with their sweet tongues 
Will read aloud to me their happier songs.

No painted scenes -- since clouds can change their skies 
A hundred times a day to please my eyes.

No headstrong wine -- since, when I drink, the spring 
Into my eager ears will softly sing.

No surplus clothes -- since every simple beast 
Can teach me to be happy with the least. 

It is good to plan in advance 
You have full time to think at once
You can make last minute change
It won’t be difficult to alter or manage

Many school of thoughts lay emphasis on present 
Person should not worry unnecessarily and be physically absent 
No moment should be wasted on unsecured tomorrow
Only hard efforts to be put up thrust to be allowed

You have full freedom to think and surge ahead
You are your own master to plan and lead
You are able to judge the action and read
The fate is uncertain and hangs on bare thread

We were given beautiful world to lead and live
They got us freedom to express and really believe
The danger lying ahead and to counter its menace
They stood high in our eyes with glorious face

They never wanted wanton killings and genocide 
The fact was well before them to decide
It was to be a safe heaven for next generation
Nothing was left out to be worked out in desperation

What are we witnessing today? 
No peaceful existence or open way
All sorts of terror attacks and reprisals
Denial for involvement soon with quick dismissals
 
Is this the world our forefathers had wanted? 
Did they want that whole population to be shifted? 
Did they want that the innocents to be executed? 
Vanish from the face of earth with voice silently muted 

why are we not allowed to raise the banner of freedom? 
What language do they understand for the price of wisdom? 
We have never come across the orgy of violence 
we are sitting on volcano and fearing hence

Today we witness the people disappear in matter of seconds
They have become trigger happy and negatively respond 
Do you think  the citizens are meant for killer’s bullet? 
Is there no place for peace to prevail with the help of ballets? 

No heart can be won over by use of force
Love and affection is the only way of course
it may bring  prosperity and brotherhood all over
why do we take shelter under the dark cover? 




If extermination is the only option then we must opt
The tough stand to be taken and adopted
There is still chance for second thought
The street should not be raged with fight

Is there any scope for total peace? 
Whom do we think can make life at ease? 
Why still we look on with so much apathy? 
Why do the intelligentsias not show the solidarity and sympathy

You have to have a plan each morning
to get yourself out of bed! 
Because if your life hasn't purpose
then your lying in your bed as dead! 

If only to get up to see the sun begin to rise
up over the rise beyond.
To bring you joy and happiness
for each day to get along.

Just turn it to a page! 
It is lifes anti aging miracle drug
it will keep you healthy and happy at any age! 

So plan a life of purpose
don't lie there and fade away! 
Your only given one chance at it
so live each minute
in a much more purpose filled way!A Planted Life—diversified
With Gold and Silver Pain
To prove the presence of the Ore
In Particles—'tis when

A Value struggle—it exist—
A Power—will proclaim
Although Annihilation pile
Whole Chaoses on Him—Someone mentioned your name yesterday
and I was silent

You loved goodness, you were goodness, 
and I think goodness must have
loved you; and we, 
we loved you for your goodness

You loved truth, spoke truth, 
and surely the truth
loved you for loving it; and how
we loved to hear you
speaking truth

You loved beauty in
so many ways that beauty
blessed you: in movement, 
in actions, in thought, in words and yes
the beauty of goodness and
the beauty of truth shone from you –
how could we not love you
beyond you? 

How often in this poem to you
the word  love appears
as it did
in you


Oh gay and shining June time!
Oh meadow brave and bright, 
Abloom with little children, 
All tossing in the light! 
They dance and circle singing— 
Oh, what a joy to see! 
They twinkle in the sunshine, 
They shout in company.

Beyond are pointed houses
Patterned against the blue, 
With bushes flower-embroidered, 
And trees all trim and true. 
Around are rows of people 
Watching the dainty show, 
Guarding the fairy kingdom 
Where blossom babies blow. 

Their merry little footsteps
Race with the tricksy air, 
That puffs their filmy dresses
And frees their shining hair. 
All pink and white and golden
Under the round gold sun, 
Winging the wind with laughter,
They ring and wreathe and run.

Oh, sweet and soft the world is,
Ever so glad and gay, 
All garlanded with children 
Who sing and prank and play ! 
You posy girls wide-petalled,
And boys all round and red,
Dance in the sun forever
Till time goes off to bed

At the end of the week
I feel so weak
I go through weeks
Just to add up my weak moments
I had some inner peace
But, it was just a piece of me
Their thoughts flooded me
There was no point
They’re staring at me
Waiting to see me 
But, I fall into the sea and swim away
The sun beats on me
The son of my mother- he hates me
But, at the end of the week
This is what I see
A sea full of weak people
And they’re all just looking for some type of peace


Writers of baseball, attention!
  When you're again on the job-
When, in your rage for invention,
  You with the language play hob-
Most of your dope we will pardon,
  Though of the moth ball it smack;
But-cut out the 'sinister garden,'
  Chop the 'initial sack.'

Rake poor old Roget's 'Thesaurus'
  For phrases fantastic and queer;
And though on occasions you bore us,
  We will refrain from a sneer.
We will endeavour to harden
  Ourselves to the rest of your clack,
If you'll cut out the 'sinister garden'
  And chop the 'initial sack.'

Singers of words that are scrambled,
  Say, if you will, that he 'died,'
Write, if you must, that he 'ambled'-
  We shall be last to deride.
But us to the Forest of Arden,
  Along with the misanthrope Jaques,
If you cling to the 'sinister garden'
  And stick to 'initial sack.'

Speak of the 'sphere's aberration,'
  Mention the 'leathery globe,'
Say he got 'free transportation'-
  Though that try the patience of Job.
But if you're wise you'll discard en-
  Cumbrances such as we thwack-
Especially 'sinister garden'
  And the 'initial sack. 

Why need we newer arms invent,
     Poor peoples to destroy?
With what we have let's be content
     And perfect their employ.
With weapons that may millions kill,
     Why should we seek for more,
A brighter spate of blood to spill,
     A deeper sea of gore?
 
The lurid blaze of atom light
     Vast continents will blind,
And steep in centuries of night
     Despairing humankind.
So let's be glad for gun and blade,
     To fight with honest stuff:
Are tank, block-buster, hand-grenade
     And napalm not enough?

Oh to go back a thousand years
     When arrows winged their way,
When foemen fell upon the spears
     And swords were swung to slay!
Behold! Belching in Heaven black
     Mushrooms obscene!
               When wars were clean




Sleep,   please drift across the sky, come with the cloudy evening, come softly, weep 
With the sweet dew, seep into my poor grinding brain, counting these silly sheep 
Hopelessly, finding flocks rioting, rampaging endlessly across deep 
Drynesses.  Or come swiftly, Leap over deserts, rush me before I know, reap  
The harvest of my consciousness,   muffle and blanket the constant bleep, bleep 
Of awareness even if you keep me yours for hours, for a day, for a week,  
Even if you come uncomforting, blowing, drizzling, raining, snowing, sleeting, 
Hailing me across dim  dark borderlands. Or stroke and seduce me, touch me, feel  
My tenderness with your fumbling fingers, steep me in soporific sleaze 
Roll me in warm sheets, in strange fragrances, oils, do with me desperate things, deeds  
Unspeakably, gaudily outrageous, as long as they exhaust all greed, 
All desires, all seeking.  As long as they meet and breed a host of feathered dreams, 
As long as they take the feverish membranes of my mind and sleekly lead 
Me slumbrous and heavy lidded, to your side; comfort me, tease and seize me 
Fondle, clasp, squeeze me freely, easily - oh Hypnos come and answer my need

A Plea to the New Year (An Experimental Sonnet)    

Welcome, New Year 'Nineteen Ninety Four'.
At midnight, closed although may be our door, 
Have you not your magic master-key, 
From world's womb to timely set you free? 

A babe yourself, our father you will be; 
Our matters for a year you'll oversee.
Our life's boat, as Captain you will guide; 
Empowered you'll be to turn the very tide! 

Our future when you draft and duly write, 
Can't you make it just a shade more bright? 
As Fortune's favourites let us be enrolled; 
Her gracious gifts, awhile let us hold.

With Health as bread and Wealth as water pure, 
A happy life for us, pray ensure. 

Everything is laughing singing, 
All the pretty flowers are sprung.
See the campus in your fun, 
With your knowledge in the blank sun.
You and I may sport and play, 
For it is a pleasant Day.

Bring the hoop and bring the ball, 
Come with happy faces all.
Let us make a merry ring, 
Talk and laugh and dance and sing.
Quickly, quickly come away, 
For it is a pleasant Day. 

A person who is said to be eating pleasant food 
is the one who eats without killing any life for food, 
but the one who eats only vegetarian food! 
 
A person who is said to be a hated personality 
Is the one who lives with loss of cheers in his face really, 
but the one who behaves with others snappishly!   
 
A person who is said to be lonely without companion 
Is the one who has not done anything good to anyone, 
but the one who was idle, without helping tendency! 
 
A person who is said to be a pleasing gentleman 
Is the one who is not hated by any body whomsoever, 
But the one who is a well disciplined person, liked for ever

Try it, you may like it.

Last night I sold my motorhome, 
Today, the tear drops flowed; 
Tomorrow's urge will surely be, 
To get on down the road.

No longer can I sit up high
In that roomy Captain's chair; 
No longer meet the friendly folk
In campgrounds, here and there.

It was mountains, towns and seashores, 
Where we often went to look
And we toured the famous places, 
Written in our history book.

Through many years and many rigs
My travels have been vast.
The time has come to hang it up, 
Sad, how those years have passed.

If you get caught by wanderlust, 
Or pressured by life's load; 
Just buy, or rent a motor coach
And get on down the road.



Now to put down somethin that has a little rhythm
And unconventional meaning, gotta be skepticism 
Rationalize with ‘em, hate ‘em instead, ‘cause in the end
I’m a little bit different, get used to‘t, it’s a trend
We got freedom for guns, freedom for lies, corporate predator
Predicate the end or the reason that you arrested her for
Do we have freedom of speech, freedom to be, free to decide
What we are when what it is they make us hide inside? 
And I don’t care what you say ‘cause I’ll say what I want
That I find beauty and love in my own ghosts that haunt
As I see naked lust dreams and hear the sounds of when she’s done
I don’t blame you, we all do crazy things when we think we’re in love
Who you love, boys, girls, it’s not up to them to choose
I might not be down with it, but hell I’m not in your shoes
I’d never stop you ‘cause I’d hope you’d be just as accepting
Of myself, I’ve got neuron-transmitters rearranging
They give me highs, give me lows, know it’s hard to explain
Why I’m always in pain, why I cry, I have no shame
I’m an emotional mess, hurricane, and when emotions run dry
Why I feel the need to cut, just to feel on the outside
But I’ve got the support, great friends, they wrap their arms 
Around me, so now I don’t feel the need to harm
Myself, guess what I’m sayin, guess what this all means
Is please open your arms, your heart, one love, peace.

This goes out to everyone who has ever been hurt or made fun of, and just a simple hope that everyone who reads this will extend their hands to accept people and to never judgea pocket full of emotions
and a myriad of notions
racing up and down the psyche
drowned in a pool of nerves, 

revived, excited one another, multiplied
accident prone, swerved from one notion 
to another, probed and urged
sommersaulting, jumping all about

came to rest in a nest of
ganglions, neurons and axels
conjuring a host of phobias
and fears, loves and tears, 

colored the scene with red hot
lust, purple apoplexy, green
jealousy, blue moods and 
black clouds, amidst skies of fun

stoic stoic do not frown
brown is too drab to lighten up
release your nervous system
that has withered and dried up

ascetic ascetic, smile and laugh
leave the prissy sisterhood
join the ranks of emotions and notions
free and easy with moments of queasy

preacher preacher let the better
instincts be the teacher, following
the red brick road of empathy
and sympathy, for the princesses' toad

soldier soldier let love conquer all
lay down your hate and bury hostility, 
and all the evil and foul emotions 

politician politician speak to the peoples
free and candid, stop playing upon their emotions
stirring up with false promises, 
resign all your false and evil designs

garbage collector garbage collector, 
gather all the evil and false emotions, 
incinerate and burn, bury the ashes deep, 
careful they too are contagious


A pocketful of sympathy
Is really rather wonderful
To stop a scratch from stinging
Or a bruise from black and bluing

A pocketful of sympathy
Can stop a heart from hurting
Or catch a tear that's falling
Like a raindropp down a cheek

A pocketful of sympathy
Costs absolutely nothing
It's the cheapest kind of plaster
That you'll ever ever find

And a pocketful of sympathy
Is like Lindsay's Magic Pudding
'Cos the more of it you give away
The more you leave behind


As I wondered what I should write
And floundered in my own confusion
I thought – why not write about poems
That set me thinking what poems are
A poem could be anything, we know
At best it is distilled thoughts put into rhyme
Or a moment caught in time
A window glimpse into the world
An engrossing passion’s ardent curl
A snap shot of scenes from Nature- wild
Or a slice of life, birth or death 
 
Sometimes it could be a yearning  
Or an image long hung on a pole 
A thought turned inside out
Or the emptying of a mind about to spill
It could be the liberation of a fancy
For long held in thralldom
A gnawing pain, long suppressed
Or a secret, never divulged
 
As I pondered over the subjects’ enormity
And a poem’s vast scope, 
I asked myself- ‘Why hesitate? ’
Soon I felt a stir inside, 
My thoughts broke loose
And a terrible block lifted off my head
My silence became audible
I embroidered these thoughts
Into the pattern of a poem

Here it is before you, have a look at it
Will it annoy you or will you enjoy

This is not a poem about passion
this is not a poem about love
this is not a poem about death
Neither hatred, nor lust
Neither emotion, nor religion
Niether you, nor me
But regardless of topic
of meaning
of purpose
or of desire
this is a poem. 

Tell me, if I caught you one day
and kissed the sole of your foot, 
wouldn't you limp a little then, 
afraid to crush my kiss?


A poem, to me: 
A statement, speech, a view.
Onomatopoeic metaphor
About me and you.
Plotted and planned, 
Or just a thing I do.
From instress to inscape, 
Hopkins-like, 
So very, very true.
A riotous myriad of colours, 
Scented roses, 
Touches new.
In verses and stanzas, 
Pocket pictures you see; 
Iambic rhythms and pulses, 
Traditional verses, 
Or free.
Time for tea.




We all may have read some good poetry
That comes in various forms, sizes, shapes and symmetry –
But then a poem need not necessary be like geometry
Where it has to adhere to certain rigid regularities.

The soul of a poem is seasoned in man’s routine experiences 
Which he tries to fathom and give a wordily appearance - 
So is it not like a painting drawn with the brush of thought
With colours that life has placed in his lot?  

A poem may also be compared to a lovely flower 
Blooming splendidly besides a cool and soothing bower,               
Or in the dark night sky a flickering star
Shining over the dark adversities with which it wages a war.

A poem is also to a poet his very own island
Churned out in the ocean by his intellect and emotion, 
It is   an instrument on which a poet composes his songs
When his soul is besieged by situations that upon him throng. 

Do I belong? I question myself
One more time anxiously, while
Waiting for permission to script
A preface to passionate musing


My maiden flight into the 
untitled world of desire
Lands softly on the
Flowerbed of compassion.

Nobody knows how long 
I am going to stay here
And now at the level crossing 
Of the dream road.

Like a few drops of dew 
Frozen in wait for 
The perennial touch of dawn
That is yet to dissolve the
Substantial shadow of doubts.

Ah! You didn't know? Asks the time
As i stood visibly confused 
About the fading life-line
Caught in the cycle of rebirth
Preparing for its return journey. 

A poem 
Not concerning them
Yet they feel part
As an inseparable art 

A poem to express hidden sentiment
Life's movement with no comments
Surrendering to the helplessness side
Nothing to complain about or to decide

Nice contentment with soul
No complaint about rise and fall 
To function in normal parameter 
Not to say word as trend setter 

It has magical side of untold misery
Keep it to self and cry out on adversary
Giving vent to all that has affected
On melodious form without being reacted 

Poetical thoughts with expression
Builds dramatic relation
A bond totally non existent
But very much apparent 

Life flows in poem style
Sadness, happiness and in joyous mood meanwhile 
Some may express it poetic way
Others may enjoy its contents and have the sway

Either you cry out or retain
But pain is after all pain 
It may reflect on face and come out through vocal cord
It is not to be kept within but in a style to put forward


I try to write one poem each day, 
I never know what I will say.
Be it love for natures blossoms, 
Perhaps, a tale about some possums.
Will it touch a chord in your heart? 
Encourage you to make a new start! 
It may be sad it may be funny
But I will not sell it not for money.
I might write about the Zoo, 
Or even something not quite true.
Fantasy is with me a big plus, 
No big deal to make a fuss.
Then my writing it will have been worthwhile.
It could be a poem that is quite sad.
Would that be so really bad? 
Yes I try to write a poem every day, 
Hoping it will help you on your way. 

Why don't the records go blank
the instant the singer dies?
Oh, I know there are explanations
but they don't convince me
I'm still surprised
When I hear the dead singing
As for orchestra's
I expect the Instruments
To fall silent one by one
as the musicians succumb 
to cancer and heart disease
so that toward the end
I turn on a disc
labelled Gotterdammerung
and all that comes out
is the sound of one sick old man
scraping a shaky bow
across an out-of-tune fiddle. 

My grandma was A beautiful person
And I love her very much
She told me stories of this and that and such
We would sit and talk for hours on end
She was my best friend
we went to the fair
She brought me new clothes to wear
On A pony I did ride
I laugh till I almost died
We had so much fun
Till the day was done
My grandma is gone to A place in the sky
Here i`m left to wonder why
My grandma was the best grandma in the world
I loved her so much I am never going to forget her
She will be in my heart forever.  .caution: 
be warned at the outset
this poem is about nothing; 
that is, 
it is 
about ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling
about bing-bong-bing-bong-bing; 
just terribly about nothing


about nothing this poem is; 
that is, there is No Thing
no matter or anti-matter
in this verse that only grows 
better and better 
into zilch and zero
and so is most logically therefore
about nothing; 
that is, 
it is 
about ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling
about bing-bong-bing-bong-bing; 
just terribly about nothing
 


and of course 
the apologists and admirers
may seek some profundity
even in this Dada absurdity
but I must leave you
you ding-dongs  
giving the kiss of life to dead earthworms 
and so I leave you to
your eternal confound-ity




and the critics from the left
might pounce 
and might utter
with much solemnity: 
but aren’t all your poems
about nothing? 


well, you zombies, 
then  this is certainly not the first
of my no-things
and neither have you seen the last; 
thank you very much



and the critics from the  right
might pounce
and might jeer
with indecent profanity: 
but isn’t all poetry  
about sweet nothings? 


and my most prosaic answer is: 
well, then you, liverless louts, 
countless in life are rewarded for nothings
and you vote in leaders for nothing; 
countless nations are run on nothing
and great businesses earn money on nothing; 
why then, you one-eyed wimps, 
and you weakling hypocrites
why then do you jeer at
poet-innocents who are content
to openly propagate nothing? 




a reminder

this poem is about nothing; 
that is, 
it is 
about ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling
about bing-bong-bing-bong-bing; 
just terribly about nothing




unnecessary repetition

for maximum irritation: 
this poem is about nothing; 
that is, 
it is 
about ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling
about bing-bong-bing-bong-bing; 
just shockingly about nothing




conclusion

still this nothing-poem aspires
to the pages 
of the Complete Works of Poet Nothing


I want to write a poem about 'nothing' 
(not an easy thing to do) . 
I want to describe the emptiness 
that I've found since I lost you. 
The crashing waves of ecstasy 
will me missing from my verse. 
There will no expletive adjectives 
or headless-chicken curse. 
The glorification of life's scenery 
will be omitted from this page. 
I will not mention the 'seven wonders' 
or some ancient, historic age. 

I will simpy be negative 
and just scribble what comes out. 
Leave you hopelessly pondering.  

what this poem is all about


There is nothing, 
Like being a FRI
.
There is nothing, 
Like being a WELL WISHER.
There is nothing, 
Like being a GUIDE.
There is nothing, 
Like being a MENTOR.
There is nothing, 
Like being a PILLAR of STRENGTH.
There is nothing, 
Like being an INSPIRATION.
There is nothing, 
Like being a MOTIVATION.
There is nothing, 
Like being a ROLE MODEL.
There is nothing, 
Like being FAMOUS.
There is nothing, 
Like being a TEACHER.
- Uresh Rai
happy teacher's day to all my
teachers
and a big thanx to all my students for
making me a better person. U never
know your contribution towards 'the making of a 'good' teacher'Our foot prints
On the dark damp sands 
Of last evening
Rushed upon my heart
Once again. 

It rained this morning too

Somehow the monsoon rain
Didn't erase the footprints

In stead it bathed them afresh.

ANGEL of Death! extend thy silent reign! 
Stretch thy dark sceptre oer this new domain
No sable car along the winding road
Has borne to earth its unresisting load;
No sudden mound has risen yet to show
Where the pale slumberer folds his arms below;
No marble gleams to bid his memory live
In the brief lines that hurrying Time can give;
Yet, O Destroyer! from thy shrouded throne
Look on our gift; this realm is all thine own!

Fair is the scene; its sweetness oft beguiled
From their dim paths the children of the wild;
The dark-haired maiden loved its grassy dells,
The feathered warrior claimed its wooded swells,
Still on its slopes the ploughmans ridges show
The pointed flints that left his fatal bow,
Chipped with rough art and slow barbarian toil, 
Last of his wrecks that strews the alien soil! 
Here spread the fields that heaped their ripened store
Till the brown arms of Labor held no more;
The scythes broad meadow with its dusky blush;
The sickles harvest with its velvet flush;
The green-haired maize, her silken tresses laid,
In soft luxuriance, on her harsh brocade;
The gourd that swells beneath her tossing plume;
The coarser wheat that rolls in lakes of bloom, 
Its coral stems and milk-white flowers alive
With the wide murmurs of the scattered hive;
Here glowed the apple with the pencilled streak
Of morning painted on its southern cheek;
The pears long necklace strung with golden drops,
Arched, like the banian, oer its pillared props;
Here crept the growths that paid the laborers care
With the cheap luxuries wealth consents to spare;
Here sprang the healing herbs which could not save
The hand that reared them from the neighboring grave.

Yet all its varied charms, forever free
From task and tribute, Labor yields to thee
No more, when April sheds her fitful rain,
The sowers hand shall cast its flying grain;
No more, when Autumn strews the flaming leaves,
The reapers band shall gird its yellow sheaves;
For thee alike the circling seasons flow
Till the first blossoms heave the latest snow. 
In the stiff clod below the whirling drifts,
In the loose soil the springing herbage lifts,
In the hot dust beneath the parching weeds,
Lifes withering flower shall drop its shrivelled seeds;
Its germ entranced in thy unbreathing sleep
Till what thou sowest mightier angels reap!

Spirit of Beauty! let thy graces blend
With loveliest Nature all that Art can lend. 
Come from the bowers where Summers life-blood flows
Through the red lips of Junes half-open rose,
Dressed in bright hues, the loving sunshines dower;
For tranquil Nature owns no mourning flower. 
Come from the forest where the beechs screen
Bars the fierce moonbeam with its flakes of green;
Stay the rude axe that bares the shadowy plains,
Stanch the deep wound That dries the maples veins. 
Come with the stream whose silver-braided rills
Fling their unclasping bracelets from the hills,
Till in one gleam, beneath the forests wings,
Melts the white glitter of a hundred springs. 
Come from the steeps where look majestic forth
From their twin thrones the Giants of the North
On the huge shapes, that, crouching at their knees,
Stretch their broad shoulders, rough with shaggy trees. 
Through the wide waste of ether, not in vain,
Their softened gaze shall reach our distant plain;
There, while the mourner turns his aching eyes
On the blue mounds that print the bluer skies,
Nature shall whisper that the fading view
Of mightiest grief may wear a heavenly hue. 
Cherub of Wisdom! let thy marble page
Leave its sad lesson, new to every age;
Teach us to live, not grudging every breath
To the chill winds that waft us on to death,
But ruling calmly every pulse it warms,
And tempering gently every word it forms. 
Seraph of Love! in heavens adoring zone,
Nearest of all around the central throne,
While with soft hands the pillowed turf we spread
That soon shall hold us in its dreamless bed,
With the low whisper, Who shall first be laid
In the dark chambers yet unbroken shade? 
Let thy sweet radiance shine rekindled here,
And all we cherish grow more truly dear. 
Here in the gates of Deaths oerhanging vault,
Oh, teach us kindness for our brothers fault
Lay all our wrongs beneath this peaceful sod,

FATHER of all! in Deaths relentless claim
We read thy mercy by its sterner name;
In the bright flower that decks the solemn bier,
We see thy glory in its narrowed sphere;
In the deep lessons that affliction draws,
We trace the curves of thy encircling laws;
In the long sigh that sets our spirits free,
We own the love that calls us back to Thee!

Through the hushed street, along the silent plain,
The spectral future leads its mourning train,
Dark with the shadows of uncounted bands,
Where mans white lips and womans wringing hands
Track the still burden, rolling slow before,
That love and kindness can protect no more;
The smiling babe that, called to mortal strife,
Shuts its meek eyes and drops its little life;
The drooping child who prays in vain to live,
And pleads for help its parent cannot give;
The pride of beauty stricken in its flower;
The strength of manhood broken in an hour;
Age in its weakness, bowed by toil and care,
Traced in sad lines beneath its silvered hair.

The sun shall set, and heavens resplendent spheres
Gild the smooth turf unhallowed yet by tears,
But ah! how soon the evening stars will shed
Their sleepless light around the slumbering dead!

Take them, O Father, in immortal trust! 
Ashes to ashes, dust to kindred dust,
Till the last angel rolls the stone away,
And a new morning brings eternal day

The movement of your life
Was stuck in its death corner.
'I love you', your eyes whispered.
You gave me your last thought
And all your future seconds.

I saw that the eternity had a suffering face.
Now, I look in the mirror, 
And I cannot remember
It has been the eternity's face, 
Or it has been mine
After we stopped  
Any communication.

I am still in your death corner
And in the memory of you.
I still keep all your thoughts
Not to despair, 
Those thoughts becoming suddenly so static
In your absence.

This love
Is digging deep dips

To kill me very slowly.

I kiss your memory.

I still feel our entwining
As I feel an extension of a missing arm.

 
Now, I have only poetry
Instead of any touch, 



Woman, 
Demean not your body
Given to you
For a divine purpose! 
 
Woman, 
You're not mere body, though! 
 
A soul's passage
To an earthly sojourn
Is no spitoon! 
 
The hips 
That hold life secure
The breasts
That nourish growth
The body
That bears the world
Can never be a play-field
For the undeserving
For those who look upon it
As a booty to loot! 
 
It's not for measly men
Who price it at their whim! 
 
Woman, 
Ridden with pain
Your body is a celebration too
Woman, 
Your body is a unique creation
To house creation

What indeed is your patrimony
My sweet child, Aniqa! 
A few 'ghazal' compositions, a handful of
poems
Which are but treasures
Of broken hearts, given for safekeeping
To your dad? 

These are tales
Of days bygone
Lived before your time
Narratives written in blood
Prophecies of better seasons to come! 

Somewhere, if at all
You suffer under the tyranny
Of moments sad and forlorn
Must read these poems, my child
For, I'm sure
They will reveal
My philosophy of sorrow and happiness

A moment, indeed
My sweet child, Aniqa
And your eyes
Will bloom forth in roses of tears
Your lips 
Will soften with dreamlike smiles. 

I
The bartender
Has eyes the color of ripe apricots
Easy to please as a cash register he
Enjoys art and good jokes.
Squish
Goes the painting
Squirt
Goes the poem
He
We
Laugh.

II
It is not easy to remember that other people died
          besides Dylan Thomas and Charlie Parker
Died looking for beauty in the world of the
          bartender
This person, that person, this person, that person
          died looking for beauty
Even the bartender died

III   
Dante blew his nose
And his nose came off in his hand
Rimbaud broke his throat
Trying to cough
Dada is not funny
It is a serious assault
On art
Because art
Can be enjoyed by the bartender.

The bartender is not the United States
Or the intellectual
Or the bartender
He is every bastard that does not cry
When he reads this poem. 

The love of a mother is beyond compare
One who dearly loves and is always there
From scraped knees
To falls from trees
A mother cares for all
From "I told you so"
To "That’s a no-no! "
A mother answers the call
Mothers cook, mothers clean, some even work a job
Even with all their strength, a mother still knows how to sob
Mothers should be honored for all they have done
Every day of the year, not just one
There is nothing better than a mother’s love
A mother’s love endures forever
Its unbreakable bonds no on can sever
No matter how much I have grown
My mother’s love is always shown
She has become a mentor and a guide
Within her always I am able to confide
No better payment for her I can find
Then to love her with heart, and with mind
To the one who bore me; I share my emotion
To the one who raised me; Absolute devotion
To this woman I express my joy
You will always be my "mommy" and I your "baby boy"Today you add one more year
One more candle upon the cake
Another year came and gone

But my Love please do look upon this number
As age slowing creeping
For Forty Four is just like..

A fine wine aging for the taste
A violin sweeter with the sound
A strong oak that withstands the storm

For the age that is achieved
Only makes you more valuable
Not only in my heart

But in my life
I Love you no matter what
Or how many years

Today you turn The age we can`t
Turn or spin around

The candles on the cake
Are there for you to
Blow out and make A wish

The tasting of the wine
While sitting on A blanket
Looking up at the stars.

The mighty oak, strong and tall
Reminds me of you
And the strength in our Love

Geoff just A little poem to say

G. for the 
help she gave me on this poem.  

Happy Birthday Geoff
On June  . 

With exact wings 
Your words sailed back 
into your throat. Could 
not fly forward. 
Your mouth face 
startled by this autumn 
Thunder went south again. 
I had forgotten the salute 
of death, how it waits Militarily 
on the outskirts of our skin. 
I had forgotten how death 
howls inside our veins. 
O father, how much like a child 
again I felt as I ran down doctors 
painted on porcelain corridors. 
O My father, as I breathed 
inhaled for us both, 
I began to sing a song 
you sang when I was little 
without a poet's name, 
Afraid of all the shadows 
cremating my bones,

     Remember the nite, 
     The nite you said 
     I love you 
     remember. 


I remembered your voice swollen 
in a ritual of words on 
d Street and St. Nicholas Place. 
Now I, daughter of applause, 
hands waterlogged with memory, 
asked for nothing more 
as I circled your hospital room, 
sequined with our breaths 
in an hour-glass of sound. 

I was born in Mississippi; 
I walked barefooted thru the mud.
Born black in Mississippi, 
Walked barefooted thru the mud.
But, when I reached the age of twelve
I left that place for good.
My daddy chopped cotton
And he drank his liquor straight.
Said my daddy chopped cotton
And he drank his liquor straight.
When I left that Sunday morning
He was leaning on the barnyard gate.
Left my mama standing
With the sun shining in her eyes.
Left her standing in the yard
With the sun shining in her eyes.
And I headed North
As straight as the Wild Goose Flies, 
I been to Detroit & Chicago
Been to New York city too.
I been to Detroit & Chicago
Been to New York city too.
Said I done strolled all those funky avenues
I'm still the same old black boy with the same old blues.
Going back to Mississippi
This time to stay for good
Going back to Mississippi
This time to stay for good-
Gonna be free in Mississippi
Or dead in the Mississippi mud. 

Who is that man who calls you ' a nobody'? 
Oh, he's nobody.

Who is that man who says 'You're really somebody'? 
Watch him carefully.

Who is that man who calls you 'everybody'? 
He is a poet. Listen to him. 

When everything was fine
And the notion of sin had vanished
And the earth was ready
In universal peace
To consume and rejoice
Without creeds and utopias,

I, for unknown reasons,
Surrounded by the books
Of prophets and theologians,
Of philosophers, poets,
Searched for an answer,
Scowling, grimacing,
Waking up at night, muttering at dawn.

What oppressed me so much
Was a bit shameful.
Talking of it aloud
Would show neither tact nor prudence.
It might even seem an outrage
Against the health of mankind.

Alas, my memory
Does not want to leave me
And in it, live beings
Each with its own pain,
Each with its own dying,
Its own trepidation.

Why then innocence
On paradisal beaches,
An impeccable sky
Over the church of hygiene?
Is it because that
Was long ago?

To a saintly man
--So goes an Arab tale--
"Had I revealed to people
How great a sinner you are,
They could not praise you


"And I," answered the pious one,
"Had I unveiled to them
How merciful you are,
They would not care for you


To whom should I turn
With that affair so dark
Of pain and also guilt
In the structure of the world,
If either here below
Or over there on high
No power can abolish
The cause and the effect?

Don't think, don't remember
The death on the cross,
Though everyday He dies,
The only one, all-loving,
Who without any need
Consented and allowed
To exist all that is,
Including nails of torture.

Totally enigmatic.
Impossibly intricate.
Better to stop speech here.
This language is not for people.
Blessed be jubilation.
Vintages and harvests.
Even if not everyone
Is granted serenity. 

I HOLD a letter in my hand,-
A flattering letter, more's the pity,-
By some contriving junto planned,
And signed per order of Committee.
It touches every tenderest spot,-
My patriotic predilections,
My well-known -something- don't ask what,-
My poor old songs, my kind affections.

They make a feast on Thursday next,
And hope to make the feasters merry;
They own they're something more perplexed
For poets than for port and sherry.
They want the men of (word torn out);
Our friends will come with anxious faces,
(To see our blankets off, no doubt,
And trot us out and show our paces.)

They hint that papers by the score
Are rather musty kind of rations,
They don't exactly mean a bore,
But only trying to the patience;
That such as you know who I mean
Distinguished for their what d'ye call 'em
Should bring the dews of Hippocrene
To sprinkle on the faces solemn.

The same old story: that's the chaff
To catch the birds that sing the ditties;
Upon my soul, it makes me laugh
To read these letters from Committees!
They're all so loving and so fair,
All for your sake such kind compunction;
'T would save your carriage half its wear
To touch its wheels with such an unction!

Why, who am I, to lift me here
And beg such learned folk to listen,
To ask a smile, or coax a tear
Beneath these stoic lids to glisten?
As well might some arterial thread
Ask the whole frame to feel it gushing,
While throbbing fierce from heel to head
As well some hair-like nerve might strain
To set its special streamlet going,
While through the myriad-channelled brain
The burning flood of thought was flowing;
Or trembling fibre strive to keep
The springing haunches gathered shorter,
While the scourged racer, leap on leap,
Was stretching through the last hot quarter!

Ah me! you take the bud that came
Self-sown in your poor garden's borders,
And hand it to the stately dame
That florists breed for, all she orders.
She thanks you, it was kindly meant
(A pale affair, not worth the keeping,)
Good morning; and your bud is sent
To join the tea-leaves used for sweeping.

Not always so, kind hearts and true,
For such I know are round me beating;
Is not the bud I offer you,
Fresh gathered for the hour of meeting,
Pale though its outer leaves may be,
Rose-red in all its inner petals?
Where the warm life we cannot see
The life of love that gave it settles.

We meet from regions far away,
Like rills from distant mountains streaming;
The sun is on Francisco's bay,
O'er Chesapeake the lighthouse gleaming;
While summer girds the still bayou
In chains of bloom, her bridal token,
Monadnock sees the sky grow blue,
His crystal bracelet yet unbroken.

Yet Nature bears the selfsame heart
Beneath her russet-mantled bosom
As where, with burning lips apart,
She breathes and white magnolias blossom;
The selfsame founts her chalice fill
With showery sunlight running over,
On fiery plain and frozen hill,
On myrtle-beds and fields of clover.

I give you Home! its crossing lines
United in one golden suture,
And showing every day that shines
The present growing to the future,
A flag that bears a hundred stars
In one bright ring, with love for centre,
Fenced round with white and crimson bars
No prowling treason dares to enter!

O brothers, home may be a word
To make affection's living treasure,
The wave an angel might have stirred,
A stagnant pool of selfish pleasure;
HOME! It is where the day-star springs
And where the evening sun reposes,
Where'er the eagle spreads his wings,
From northern pines to southern roses

Will you find that which you seek
Within the ruins of fire grown weak? 
Ashes blown from hearth to heart
Choke life's breath, deaden its art.
 
Unburied in night, dreams do seek
One whose desire will not grow weak.
Enduring love envelops the heart, 
While trust and faith rekindle life's art.


(What can I say 
to erase the wilt 
I cause within 
your heart 
that beats 
for mine 
and only wants 
to be freed 
not entangled 
in this snarly vine 
What can I say 
to take it all away? 

Except,  I love you


I write a poem for you today, 
to get a place in your heart for ever
A poem that could tell you my love for you
for you to understand my deep thoughts for you 
A poem to love and a poem to understand its soul
A poem to enjoy and a poem to understand its happiness 
A poem to think and a poem to understand its way of life
A poem to learn and a poem to understand its content
A poem to sing and a poem to understand its melody 
A poem to cry and a poem to understand its sorrow
There are poems I have written but this is specially for you
The poem could tell you how important you are for me
There are words comes out freely from my mind to write poem
but there are no words to find my love for you
Those words can not missed as I miss your love today
Let me have all those words put in to my heart and
say I love to write a love poem for you 




Counting the days to eternal abyss

Fragile, a vein ruptures
Agile, a mood bursts

Your scent is across the ocean
I smell the stinky you, in notion

Desire so beautiful, like a poppy
Blossoms, sugar coated with honey

I got no means to come to you
If I can walk the ocean blue

I don’t have to write this poem
Just bury ourselves in a dorm

For a start, before luxury unleashes
We bravely, overcome love patches


PS: I was listening to Andy Williams' song 'Love Story' (where do I begin)        whilst writing this lovely poem

Stretch sea
Stretch away sea and land
We are following thee
Thy lead is dangerous
And glorius
Stretch thyself and us
And make us live
To mount the ladder of horizons
Until we step upon the radiant plateau. 

She really wishes
that she could play the drums
but alas
all she does
is clean out the empty lint trap
in a geisha costume. 

As I lay in my bed, unable to sleep
I composed a good poem I wanted to keep; 
It kept going round and around in my head
(I should have been bothered to write it all down) 
But decided, by rote, to remember instead.

Once honed, I repeated, lest I should forget
It felt so secure in my mind there, and yet
Time and again I have made this mistake
I should have got up, or at least stayed awake.

In spite of persisting I was not receiving
No matter my anger, there was no retrieving
And so, after all, I now know to my cost
This delicate whisper, 
This poem, is lost. 

A POEM MOOD 

The thin clear ordinary mind
Is not for Poetry-

One needs a Deep Doubleness within- 
A certain kind of Ironic Longing- 
A calling out for Meaning 
That knows it cannot ever Define itself completely-

A Poem Mood 
Is a different kind of Being.
 
One can sometimes make it come-
One can sometimes respond to it, 
And make the Poem with it.
But is not so simple
And not so easy.
 
I have the Mind and Mood of a Poem now- 
But how many would – be poetic lines have I written 
Including these perhaps
Without it

A POEM MUST BE WRITTEN

A poem must be written
To prove that I am
Now as I write it 
I know that I can-A POEM NEEDS A BEAUTY OF ITS OWN

The Beauty of the World
We see with our eyes
Is too great to be written, 

A Poem needs a Beauty of its own. 

A POEM NEEDS SILENCE TO HEAR ITSELF BE HEARD 

A poem needs silence to hear itself be heard 
Background clutter destroys the holy word.
Let the music play elsewhere, 
Let the talkers aloud outside, 
A poem needs silence
To hear itself inside. 

We are not lovers 
because of the love 
we make 
but the love 
we have
We are not friends 
because of the laughs 
we spend 
but the tears 
we save


I don't want to be near you 
for the thoughts we share 
but the words we never have 
to speak
I will never miss you 
because of what we do 
but what we are 
together


A POEM OF FRUSTRATION, RAGE, BITTERNESS, RESENTMENT, DISAPPOINTMENT, ENVY, SADNESS, SICKNESS, DEPRESSION, FEAR 

A poem of frustration, rage, bitterness, resentment, disappointment, envy, sadness, sickness, despair, depression, fear- 
All feelings of down and darkness and shame and lust and emptiness 
A poem of ugliness inside and anger which has no goodness in it 
A poem to blame myself and the world 
A poem of guilt and loneliness and nothingness and sadness again and again 
A poem no one ever needs to feel 
A bad poem on bad things
Ugly ugly ugly 
As if even the earth were made in the image of darkness and death 
Such a sad bad poem and such inner anger and sickness and sadness 
What can it all mean? 
When I am a person of such good intention
Who wants the best for us all? 
What can it all mean 
I don’t know. 
I am just a little complaining discontent not yet at the end of my road perhaps. 

I throw my gun in the back of my truck
With it I hope to kill a point buck
While in the woods, BANG! I see the deer fall
I take him home, freeze the meat, and mount his horns on my wall

I grab my pole and tackle box and head to the lake
At this time in the morning, I feel barely awake
There is no school today, I’m glad there is no class
A mighty tug on my line, I hook a large mouth bass

There is nothing like hunting; waiting for the kill
Cutting and cleaning the meat my freezer I’ll soon fill
Deer steaks and deer jerky have such a great taste
And with his head on my wall nothing goes to waste

I like fishing, fishing is fun
Fishing underneath the rising sun
I like catching the fish and putting them in a net
Fish is a great dish when the table is set

My truck is unstoppable; it can’t beat
I slam the door and strap myself in the seat
I start the engine and press the gas to the floor
My truck takes off and my engine lets out a roar

I wouldn’t be able to hunt or fish if it wasn’t for my truck
With it I carry poles, guns, and my fallen buck
I pull my boat with my truck in four-wheel-drive
At my destination I always arrive


A POEM OF JOY IN OLD AGE 

A Poem of Joy in Old Age 
Is a small poem 
Of a single quiet perception.

The morning light 
The smile of a small  step-grandchild 
A happy turn of phrase. 

A flickering joy 
The mouthful of a morsel 
A walk to see trees and sky. 

A child no longer young 
Leaning over with a hug 
Before yet another good-bye. 

A poem of pain is a different kind of poem
Than the poem I would write
But what if this becomes all I have? 

What if Pain makes Poetry meaningless? 
What if Poetry becomes only the vain self- exaltation 
Which gives no help and comfort 
To the one one loves? 

What if Pain makes Poetry meaningless

That which allows one
To stay put amidst chaos
That's peace
 
That which makes one stand
And walk straight in pain
That's strength! 
 
Where there's peace
There lies strength

THE POEM OF THE SEA IS FOR ME TODAY IN TEL AVIV CHOL HAMOED PESACH The poem of the sea is for me today 
In Tel Aviv Chol Ha- Moed Pesach The poem of longing and beauty 
It is the poem of light 
Of distance 
It is the poem of waves unceasing 
And colors dreaming their changes faster than they can be named-

The poem of the sea is for me
On this day
A poem of return and happiness
A poem of being with my family-

It is too a poem of remembrance-
How thirty- five years ago just beginning 
I came to the same sea alone
And wondered how 
If I would ever have a family of my own -

Then young in love
And later losing love
And then returning alone 
And now again here
With a daughter her husband and my granddaughter

The poem of the sea is for me 
On this day

 Of longing and beauty of light of distance
And happiness. 

Unexpected thunders 
Rolling and flowing as 
Sweetest music

Cloud after cloud
Hurry to give back all 
That's absorbed

I watch 
From the cool darkness
Enveloping me

I stand in awe 
The raindrops sliding 
Down me 

I close my eyes
In ecstasy at a lightning 
Blinding me

The earth and I 
Together sing a song 
Of joy

I with utmost care
Place this tear 
On the funeral pyre
Don't look down
Upon a tear shed
Don't you see
Its heart still throbbing? 
Its eyes beyond your grasp? 
The tear still pulsating
And its breath filling the lungs? 
It has many tales to recount
Connecting you to me
And us to him, her and them
Come, pay you respects
Before the pyre is lit
Before another tear is shed
And placed on the pyre. 

The birds on the trees
Where did they go? 
They stayed undaunted
All through the dry spell
But at the sight of rain
Where did they huddle? 

I drew my car aside
Listening to the rain
Rattle on the window pane
There sped by a youth
On his two wheeler
His fists and teeth, clenched

The road wore a deserted look
Just like all those trees
With not a bird in sight
An occasional car
Made some watery-sound
Breaking my revelry

Stray animals-
Donkey, dog
Cow and buffalo
Stood in meditation
Offering themselves
To the rain

In my fancy
I crawled like an infant
Towards the rattling sound
With my tongue
Ready to lick
A dropp or two

Trees are never felled . . . in summer . . . Not when the fruit . . .   
is yet to be borne . . . Never before the promise . . . is fulfilled . . .   
Not when their cooling shade . . . has yet to comfort . . . 

Yet there are those . . . unheeding of nature . . . indifferent to   
ecology . . . ignorant of need . . . who . . . with ax and sharpened   
saw . . . would . . . in boots . . . step forth damaging . . . 

Not the tree . . . for it falls . . . But those who would . . . in 
summer's heat . . . or winter's cold . . . contemplate . . . the   
beauty . . . 

When an emotion
Can no longer remain
Within the boundaries
It takes the form 
Of hugs, tears, smile
Laughter and er words

Shallow is this 
Human communication
Fragile and fluid
Even a casual response
To its myriad forms
Can at times deal 
A decisive blow

The more one understands this
The more does one dwell in silence

A POEM ON THE LAST DAY OF THE YEAR

All the words are gone now-
I am left alone
With the quiet- 
The quiet is good now-
and I am not tired-

What will be next year-
I cannot know.
All my life is 
But I cannot know. 

What beauty displays light
in a day as it conveys
its glimmer of spring
in the hearts and souls' depth, 
like the dawn emiting
its sparks on the petals
of the ruby roses? 
A day when hearts run warm
to impart love to beam
mirth to liven the world. 

Somehow, these days
Whenever it rains 
On parched earth
It no longer sends
A tickling perfume

I smell burning fire! 

Somehow, these days
Whenever I look up at the moon
On a moon-lit night
It no longer sets
My passion high

I see forest-fire spreading across it! 

Somehow, these days
Whenever I walk by the sea
On cool mornings
It doesn't uplift 
My spirit to negotiate the day

I somehow smell of rotten fish! 

Somehow, these days 
Whenever I think of love
Teasing me and tantalizing me
I see it as a single dominant emotion
That balances or subdues
Other emotions that manifest
In either love or fear
The yin and yang
Of the world we inhabit


(Aug Through leafy woodland we wandered
when we were young one day, 
among the purple columbine
which was pictured in wild array.

Walking past pink and white roses, 
soft breezes caressing us there, 
the scent of sweet lavender lingered
across the afternoon air.

We sat in the shade of the maple
enjoying a country cream-tea.
Oh these were the days of innocence
when we knew not our own destiny. 

Shall the great soul of Newton quit this earth, 
To mingle with his stars; and every muse,
Astonish'd into silence, shun the weight
Of honours due to his illustrious name?
But what can man?--Even now the sons of light,
In strains high-warbled to seraphic lyre,
Hail his arrival on the coast of bliss.
Yet am not I deterr'd, though high the theme,
And sung to harps of angels, for with you,
Ethereal flames! ambitious, I aspire
In Nature's general symphony to join. 

And what new wonders can ye show your guest!
Who, while on this dim spot, where mortals toil
Clouded in dust, from motion's simple laws,
Could trace the secret hand of Providence,
Wide-working through this universal frame. 

Have ye not listen'd while he bound the suns
And planets to their spheres! th' unequal task
Of humankind till then. Oft had they roll'd
O'er erring man the year, and oft disgrac'd
The pride of schools, before their course was known
Full in its causes and effects to him,
All-piercing sage! who sat not down and dream'd
Romantic schemes, defended by the din
Of specious words, and tyranny of names;
But, bidding his amazing mind attend,
And with heroic patience years on years
Deep-searching, saw at last the system dawn,
And shine, of all his race, on him alone. 

What were his raptures then! how pure! how strong!
And what the triumphs of old Greece and Rome,
By his diminish'd, but the pride of boys
In some small fray victorious! when instead
Of shatter'd parcels of this earth usurp'd
By violence unmanly, and sore deeds
Of cruelty and blood, Nature herself
Stood all subdu'd by him, and open laid
Her every latent glory to his view. 

All intellectual eye, our solar-round
First gazing through, he by the blended power
Of gravitation and projection saw
The whole in silent harmony revolve.
From unassisted vision hid, the moons
To cheer remoter planets numerous pour'd,
By him in all their mingled tracts were seen.
Whether she wanes into a scanty orb,
Or, waxing broad, with her pale shadowy light,
In a soft deluge overflows the sky.
Her every motion clear-discerning, he
Adjusted to the mutual main, and taught
Why now the mighty mass of water swells
Resistless, heaving on the broken rocks,
And the full river turning; till again
The tide revertive, unattracted, leaves
A yellow waste of idle sands behind. 

Then breaking hence, he took his ardent flight
Through the blue infinite; and every star,
Which the clear concave of a winter's night
Pours on the eye, or astronomic tube,
Far-stretching, snatches from the dark abyss,
Or such as farther in successive skies
To fancy shine alone, at his approach
Blaz'd into suns, the living centre each
Of an harmonious system: all combin'd,
And rul'd unerring by that single power,
Which draws the stone projected to the ground. 

O unprofuse magnificence divine!
O wisdom truly perfect! thus to call
From a few causes such a scheme of things,
Effects so various, beautiful, and great,
An universe complete! and O belov'd
Of Heaven! whose well-purg'd penetrative eye,
The mystic veil transpiercing, inly scann'd
The rising, moving, wide-establish'd frame. 

He, first of men, with awful wing pursu'd
The comet through the long elliptic curve,
As round innumerous worlds he wound his way,
Till, to the forehead of our evening sky
Return'd, the blazing wonder glares anew,
And o'er the trembling nations shakes dismay. 

The heavens are all his own, from the wild rule
Of whirling vortices and circling spheres
To their first great simplicity restor'd.
The schools astonish'd stood; but found it vain
To keep at odds with demonstration strong,
And, unawaken'd, dream beneath the blaze
Of truth. At once their pleasing visions fled,
With the gay shadows of the morning mix'd,
When Newton rose, our philosophic sun!
Th' aerial flow of sound was known to him,
From whence it first in wavy circles breaks,
Till the touch'd organ takes the message in.
Nor could the darting beam of speed immense
Escape his swift pursuit and measuring eye.
Ev'n Light itself, which every thing displays,
Shone undiscover'd, till his brighter mind
Untwisted all the shining robe of day;
And, from the whitening undistinguish'd blaze,
Collecting every ray into his kind,
To the charm'd eye educ'd the gorgeous train
Of parent colours. First the flaming red
Sprung vivid forth; the tawny orange next;
And next delicious yellow; by whose side
Fell the kind beams of all-refreshing green.
Then the pure blue, that swells autumnal skies
Ethereal played; and then, of sadder hue,
Emerg'd the deepen'd indigo, as when
The heavy-skirted evening droops with frost;
While the last gleamings of refracted light
Died in the fainting violet away.
These, when the clouds distil the rosy shower,
Shine out distinct adown the wat'ry bow;
While o'er our heads the dewy vision bends
Delightful, melting on the fields beneath.
Myriads of mingling dyes from these result,
And myriads still remain--infinite source
Of beauty, ever flushing, ever new. 

Did ever poet image aught so fair,
Dreaming in whisp'ring groves by the hoarse brook?
Or prophet, to whose rapture heaven descends?
Ev'n now the setting sun and shifting clouds,
Seen, Greenwich, from thy lovely heights, declare
How just, how beauteous the refractive law. 

The noiseless tide of time, all bearing down
To vast eternity's unbounded sea,
Where the green islands of the happy shine,
He stemm'd alone; and, to the source (involv'd
Deep in primeval gloom) ascending, rais'd
His lights at equal distances, to guide
Historian wilder'd on his darksome way. 

But who can number up his labours? who
His high discoveries sing? When but a few
Of the deep-studying race can stretch their minds
To what he knew--in fancy's lighter thought
How shall the muse then grasp the mighty theme? 

What wonder thence that his devotion swell'd
Responsive to his knowledge? For could he,
Whose piercing mental eye diffusive saw
The finish'd university of things
In all its order, magnitude, and parts,
Forbear incessant to adore that Power
Who fills, sustains, and actuates the whole? 

Say, ye who best can tell, ye happy few,
Who saw him in the softest lights of life,
All unwithheld, indulging to his friends
The vast unborrow'd treasures of his mind,
oh, speak the wondrous man! how mild, how calr
How greatly humble, how divinely good,
How firm establish'd on eternal truth;
Fervent in doing well, with every nerve
Still pressing on, forgetful of the past,
And panting for perfection; far above
Those little cares and visionary joys
That so perplex the fond impassion'd heart
Of ever-cheated, ever-trusting man.
This, Conduitt, from thy rural hours we hope;
As through the pleasing shade where nature pours
Her every sweet in studious ease you walk,
The social passions smiling at thy heart
That glows with all the recollected sage. 

And you, ye hopeless gloomy-minded tribe,
You who, unconscious of those nobler flights
That reach impatient at immortal life,
Against the prime endearing privilege
Of being dare contend,--say, can a soul
Of such extensive, deep, tremendous powers,
Enlarging still, be but a finer breath
Of spirits dancing through their tubes awhile,
And then for ever lost in vacant air? 

But hark! methinks I hear a warning voice,
Solemn as when some awful change is come,
Sound through the world--" 'Tis done!--the measure's full;
And I resign my charge

"--Ye mouldering stones
That build the towering pyramid, the proud
Triumphal arch, the monument effac'd
By ruthless ruin, and whate'er supports
The worship'd name of hoar antiquity--
Down to the dust! What grandeur can ye boast
While Newton lifts his column to the skies,
Beyond the waste of time. Let no weak drop
Be shed for him. The virgin in her bloom
Cut off, the joyous youth, and darling child--
These are the tombs that claim the tender tear
And elegiac song. But Newton calls
For other notes of gratulation high,
That now he wanders through those endless worlds
He here so well descried, and wondering talks,
And hymns their Author with his glad compeers. 

O Britain's boast! whether with angels thou
Sittest in dread discourse, or fellow-blest,
Who joy to see the honour of their kind;
Or whether, mounted on cherubic wing,
Thy swift career is with the whirling orbs,
Comparing things with things, in rapture lost,
And grateful adoration for that light
So plenteous ray'd into thy mind below
From Light Himself; oh, look with pity down
On humankind, a frail erroneous race!
Exalt the spirit of a downward world!
O'er thy dejected country chief preside,
And be her Genius call'd! her studies raise,
Correct her manners, and inspire her youth;
For, though deprav'd and sunk, she brought thee forth,
And glories in thy name! she points thee out
To all her sons, and bids them eye thy star:
While, in expectance of the second life,
When time shall be no more, thy sacred dust
Sleeps with her kings, and dignifies the scene. 

That morning when the sun
Was in hurry to show his fury
I settled down on the sofa
My weary brow dripping
The humid weather outside
I had the bin emptied before me
And a crumpled piece of paper
Caught my blinking vision

"The tree reveals of the root-rot
Only when the leaves begin to fade
And the branches stand ready to fall
But still there come a bird or two
For a brief rest-

I give the roots all that I can to nourish
Unaware and unguarded-"

My eyes declined to go further
My sweat
My tears
Felt alike on my cheek-

The empty bin gawked

PHI BETA KAPPA, JUNE  THE Caliph ordered up his cook,
And, scowling with a fearful look
That meant,--We stand no gammon,--
'To-morrow, just at two,' he said,
'Hassan, our cook, will lose his head,
Or serve us up a salmon.'

'Great sire,' the trembling chef replied,
Sun, Moon, and Stars, and so on
(Look in Eothen,-there you'll find
A list of titles. Never mind;
I have n't time to go on

'Great sire,' and so forth, thus he spoke,
'Your Highness must intend a joke;
It doesn't stand to reason
For one to order salmon brought,
Unless that fish is sometimes caught,
And also is in season.

'Our luck of late is shocking bad,
In fact, the latest catch we had
(We kept the matter shady),
But, hauling in our nets,--alack!
We found no salmon, but a sack
That held your honored Lady!'

'My poor Zuleika, you are dead,
I once took interest in you.'
We cut the lines and let her go.'

'It is n't hard one's hook to bait,
And, squatting down, to watch and wait,
To see the cork go under;
At last suppose you've got your bite,
You twitch away with all your might,--
You've hooked an eel, by thunder!'

The Caliph patted Hassan's head
'Slave, thou hast spoken well,' he said,
'And won thy master's favor.
Yes; since what happened t' other morn
The salmon of the Golden Horn
Might have a doubtful flavor.

'That last remark about the eel
Has also justice that we feel
Quite to our satisfaction.
To-morrow we dispense with fish,
And, for the present, if you wish,
You'll keep your bulbous fraction.'

'Thanks! thanks!' the grateful chef replied,
His nutrient feature showing wide
The gleam of arches dental:
'To cut my head off wouldn't pay,
I find it useful every day,
As well as ornamental.'

. . . . . . . . . . . . .

Brothers, I hope you will not fail
To see the moral of my tale
And kindly to receive it.
You know your anniversary pie
Must have its crust, though hard and dry,
And some prefer to leave it.

How oft before these youths were born
I've fished in Fancy's Golden Horn
For what the Muse might send me!
How gayly then I cast the line,
When all the morning sky was mine,
And Hope her flies would lend me!

And now I hear our despot's call,
And come, like Hassan, to the hall,--
If there's a slave, I am one,--
My bait no longer flies, but worms!
An eel, and not a salmon

A poem comes abruptly – A poem
  Sneaks into the room and hides behind the chair
Or the couch, or the curtain
  And then pounces through the air
   Into the Mind
   Chokes and licks the Heart
   At the strangest of times
    It seduces me-and I will try, sometimes
  To resist-but then I usually comply
 – I know what it wants 
   It's more of a strong FEELING
 Attached to a general Idea, or to a few
    Musical words –
 Either way-it won't leave you be until
You write it – until it gets what it came for

 - -{}{}___{}{}___{}{}- -

     Each letter; Each word; Each sentence
   Crawls from my head, down my neck
  Into my arm, and then into my hand and fingers
  -The ink glides smooth across the paper-
   -the keys click and plick-
    Each word has a special grace
    (Hand written poems and typed poems are very different) 
 
A poem doesn't care if you're at work 
– 'I can't write you.', I try to say-
'SNEAK into the bathroom with a pen and a napkin then-'
                   It tells me-
   It commands me-
     'Not now-my wrist hurts from writing all day! '
     'Suck it UP.' The poem replies.
   'But, but-ughhh-okay, you're right.  You win.'  I say.
 
- -And even though I sometimes choose the wrong words, 
even though it may read wrong, 
 or seems unsteady. 
   it can be fixed- -
 
it can grow-
 like a pet
 like a child
 like a tree
  Into something Otherworldly
 
This poem is happy it has been written.
 
(Voice of the poem)  – 'And now that you have finished my bidding, I will let you get back to your daily tasks.'
(Me)  – 'My thanks to you, Great One, is simply your concluding line.'
 
–  pm, October h,– Books-a-Million -It drifted past my window
As I gazed into the night
It sparkled as a diamond -
'Twas a poem taking flight

It fluttered in the darkness
And I saw it floating by
With wings of brightest silver
How it moved across the sky

I thought upon the message
That this poem might impart
Of love, of hope, of freedom –
Words to hold within my heart

Such poems are eternal
That shall move the soul to love -
A gentle voice so tender
That falls from heaven aboveif one takes a pose
and crafts verse
then what results is
naïve posturing; 
but if one lets the words
choose
and is oneself 
choiceless
then it may end 
in a poem 
that happens


Under a sky
That never touched 
The earth

In that virtual space
Where none others
Ever breathed

There I hear
The unique raaga
My breath sings

Between the breaths
Lurks an exclusive dream
That I dream of you, for you

This evening
The dream morphed
Into a bird

The colorful wings
Took to flight
To paint the sky


We played and played
Hours days months years
You went your way
And I went my way

Then began a game 
Of hide and seek

Tired I pushed the door
There you're hiding. 

Tired I dropped to the floor
There you're under the cot

Did you go your way? 
Did I go my way? 

We still play and play
Hours days months years
You didn't really go anywhere
Nor did I go my way! 


(May I dwell
In the absence
You left behind

That absence occupies me

I dabble
In the silence
You fill me with

That's my silent connect

This heart
Still sings
The moonlight sonata of yore

That silent score sustains me

My breath
Still draws in
The perfume dabbed on this skin

That silently nurtures hope in me

Every night
I bury  tear for you
In my heart

That quenches my heart's thirst


This haunts my sleep
It burns out smiles, assuaging nothing as it does so.
Feeding my depression and fanning the flames of my heartache.
Can't you tell me that everything will be alright? 
That I have made stupid mistakes
But that you will love me anyways

Will be healed of my hurt.
I'm still waiting your answer
Until then I hear nothing
No empty words looking like lies
I see nothing
Not the reflection of my dark eyes in yours
I feel nothing
No sinful caress of the skin
Nothing but the beating in my heart
and the throbbing of my head
Everything, next to kills me

Everything says you've moved on
And that you don't want me.
Tell me is this true? 
You know I didn't lie
When I said I would die for you
and I would never want to hurt you.
You are my one true love
and the light in my soul
So please, darling please
Please  come back, 
. 
Please

I wrote this 
To fit the small space 
Of a last page
Enough room
For infinite dreams
Of wet tongues, closed eyes
Of passionate fountains and endless skies
Of the smell of your sweater
And the perfume behind your ear
Of your fingers in my hair
And the lasting glow of the setting sun


I was snooping around my mates lap, 
And his name was Jack, 
What was found there, 
Can only be described, 
As two big biscuits and a shortcake.
The smell to each was distinct to its own, 
And can never be replicated.
O Jack why did you leave me, 
I thought forever we would be, 
I only wanted a biscuit after dribbling on your knee. 

That Providence which had so long the care
Now in its self (the Glass where all appears)
Had seen the period of his golden Years:
And thenceforth onely did attend to trace,
What death might least so sair a Life deface.
The People, which what most they fear esteem,
Death when more horrid so more noble deem;
And blame the last Act, like Spectators vain,
Unless the Prince whom they applaud be slain.
Nor Fate indeed can well refuse that right
To those that liv'd in War, to dye in Fight.
But long his Valour none had left that could
Indanger him, or Clemency that would.
And he whom Nature all for Peace had made,
But angry Heaven unto War had sway'd,
And so less useful where he most desir'd,
For what he least affected was admir'd,
Deserved yet an End whose ev'ry part
Should speak the wondrous softness of his Heart.
To Love and Grief the fatal Writ was sign'd;
(Those nobler weaknesses of humane Mind,
From which those Powers that issu'd the Decree,
Although immortal, found they were not free.)
That they, to whom his Breast still open lyes,
In gentle Passions should his Death disguise:
And leave succeeding Ages cause to mourn,
As long as Grief shall weep, or Love shall burn.
Streight does a slow and languishing Disease
Eliza, Natures and his darling, seize.
Her when an infant, taken with her Charms,
He oft would flourish in his mighty Arms;
And, lest their force the tender burthen wrong,
Slacken the vigour of his Muscles strong;
Then to the Mothers brest her softly move,
Which while she drain'd of Milk she fill'd with Love:
But as with riper Years her Virtue grew,
And ev'ry minute adds a Lustre new;
When with meridian height her Beauty shin'd,
And thorough that sparkled her fairer Mind;
When She with Smiles serene and Words discreet
His hidden Soul at ev'ry turn could meet;
Then might y' ha' daily his Affection spy'd,
Doubling that knot which Destiny had ty'd:
While they by sence, not knowing, comprehend
How on each other both their Fates depend.
With her each day the pleasing Hours he shares,
And at her Aspect calms her growing Cares;
Or with a Grandsire's joy her Children sees
Hanging about her neck or at his knees.
Hold fast dear Infants, hold them both or none;
This will not stay when once the other's gone.
A silent fire now wasts those Limbs of Wax,
And him with his tortur'd Image racks.
So the Flowr with'ring which the Garden crown'd,
The sad Root pines in secret under ground.
Each Groan he doubled and each Sigh he sigh'd,
Repeated over to the restless Night.
No trembling String compos'd to numbers new,
Answers the touch in Notes more sad more true.
She lest He grieve hides what She can her pains,
And He to lessen hers his Sorrow feigns:
Yet both perceiv'd, yet both conceal'd their Skills,
And so diminishing increast their ills:
That whether by each others grief they fell,
Or on their own redoubled, none can tell.
And now Eliza's purple Locks were shorn,
Where she so long her Fathers fate had worn:
And frequent lightning to her Soul that flyes,
Devides the Air, and opens all the Skyes:
And now his Life, suspended by her breath,
Ran out impetuously to hasting Death.
Like polish'd Mirrours, so his steely Brest
Had ev'ry figure of her woes exprest;
And with the damp of her last Gasps obscur'd,
Had drawn such staines as were not to be cur'd.
Fate could not either reach with single stroke,
But the dear Image fled the Mirrour broke.
Who now shall tell us more of mournful Swans,
Of Halcyons kind, or bleeding Pelicans?
No downy breast did ere so gently beat,
Or fan with airy plumes so soft an heat.
For he no duty by his height excus'd,
Nor though a Prince to be a Man refus'd:
But rather then in his Eliza's pain
Not love, not grieve, would neither live nor reign.
And in himself so oft immortal try'd,
Yet in compassion of another dy'd.
So have I seen a Vine, whose lasting Age
Of many a Winter hath surviv'd the rage.
Under whose shady tent Men ev'ry year
At its rich bloods expence their Sorrows chear,
If some dear branch where it extends its life
Chance to be prun'd by an untimely knife,
The Parent-Tree unto the Grief succeeds,
And through the Wound its vital humour bleeds;
Trickling in watry drops, whose flowing shape
Weeps that it falls ere fix'd into a Grape.
So the dry Stock, no more that spreading Vine,
Frustrates the Autumn and the hopes of Wine.
A secret Cause does sure those Signs ordain
Fore boding Princes falls, and seldom vain.
Whether some Kinder Pow'rs, that wish us well,
What they above cannot prevent, foretell;
Or the great World do by consent presage,
As hollow Seas with future Tempests rage:
Or rather Heav'n, which us so long fore sees,
Their fun'rals celebrate while it decrees.
But never yet was any humane Fate
By nature solemniz'd with so much state.
He unconcern'd the dreadful passage crost;
But oh what pangs that Death did Nature cost!
First the great Thunder was shot off, and sent
The Signal from the starry Battlement.
The Winds receive it, and its force out-do,
As practising how they could thunder too:
Out of the Binders Hand the Sheaves they tore,
And thrash'd the Harvest in the airy floore;
Or of huge Trees, whose growth with his did rise,
The deep foundations open'd to the Skyes.
Then heavy Showres the winged Tempests dead,
And pour the Deluge ore the Chaos head.
The Race of warlike Horses at his Tomb
Offer themselves in many an Hecatomb;
With pensive head towards the ground they fall,
And helpless languish at the tainted Stall.
Numbers of Men decrease with pains unknown,
And hasten not to see his Death their own.
Such Tortures all the Elements unfix'd,
Troubled to part where so exactly mix'd.
And as through Air his wasting Spirits flow'd,
The Universe labour'd beneath their load.
Nature it seem'd with him would Nature vye;
He with Eliza, It with him would dye.
He without noise still travell'd to his End,
As silent Suns to meet the Night descend.
The Stars that for him fought had only pow'r
Left to determine now his fatal Hour,
Which, since they might not hinder, yet they cast
To chuse it worthy of his Glories past.
No part of time but bore his mark away
But this, of all the most auspicious found,
Twice had in open field him Victor crown'd
When up the armed Mountains of Dunbar
He march'd, and through deep Severn ending war.
What day should him eternize but the same
That had before immortaliz'd his Name?
That so who ere would at his Death have joy'd,
In their own Griefs might find themselves imploy'd;
But those that sadly his departure griev'd,
Yet joy'd remembring what he once atcheiv'd.
And the last minute his victorious Ghost
Gave chase to Ligny on the Belgick Coast.
Here ended all his mortal toyles: He lay'd
And slept in Peace under the Lawrel Shade.
Have such high honours from above been shown:
For whom the Elements we Mourners see,
And Heav'n it self would the great Herald be;
Which with more Care set forth his Obsequies
Then those of Moses hid from humane Eyes;
As jealous only here lest all be less,
That we could to his Memory express.
Then let us to our course of Mourning keep:
Where Heaven leads, 'tis Piety to weep.
Stand back ye Seas, and shrunk beneath the vail
Of your Abysse, with cover'd Head bewail
Your Monarch: We demand not your supplies
To compass in our Isle; our Tears suffice;
Since him away the dismal Tempest rent,
Who once more joyn'd us to the Continent;
Who planted England on the Flandrick shoar,
And stretch'd our frontire to the Indian Ore;
Whose greater Truths obscure the Fables old,
Whether of British Saints or Worthy's told;
And in a valour less'ning Arthur's deeds,
For Holyness the Confessor exceeds.
He first put Armes into Religions hand,
And tim'rous Conscience unto Courage man'd:
The Souldier taught that inward Mail to wear,
Those Strokes he said will pierce through all below
Where those that strike from Heaven fetch their Blow.



Astonish'd armyes did their flight prepare:
And Cityes strong were stormed by his prayer.
Of that for ever Prestons field shall tell
The Story, and impregnable Clonmell.
And where the sandy mountain Fenwick scald
The Sea between yet henee his pray'r prevail'd.
What man was ever so in Heav'n obey'd
Since the commanded Sun ore Gibeon stayd.
In all his warrs needs must he triumph, when
Hence though in battle none so brave or fierce
Yet him the adverse steel could never pierce:
Pitty it seem'd to hurt him more that felt
Each wound himself which he to others delt,
Danger it self refusing to offend
So loose an enemy so fast a freind.
Friendship that sacred versue long das claime
The first foundation of his house and name.
But within one its narrow limitts fall
His tendernesse extended unto all:
And that deep soule through every chanell flows
Where kindly nature loves it self to lose.
More strong affections never reason serv'd
Yet still affected most what best deservd.
If he Eliza lov'd to that degree
(Though who more worstly to be lov'd then she)
If so indulgent to his own, how deare
To him the children of the Highest were?
For her he once did natures tribute pay:
For these his life adventur'd every day.
And it would be found could we his thoughts have
Their griefs struck deepest if Eliza's last.
What prudence more then humane did he need
To keep so deare, so diff'ring mindes agreed?
The worser sort as conscious of their ill,
Lye weak and easy to the rulers will:
But to the good (too many or too few).
All law is uselesse all reward is due.
Oh ill advis'd if not for love for shame.
Spare yet your own if you neglect his fame.
Least others dare to think your reale a maske
And you to govern only Heavens taske.
Valour, Religion, Friendship, Prudence dy'd
At once with him and all that's good beside:
And rue deaths refuse natures dreg's confin'd
To loathsome life Alas are left behinde:
Where we (so once we us'd) shall now no more
To fetch day presse about his chamber door;
From which he issu'd with that awfull state
It seem'd Mars broke through Janus double gate:
Yet alwayes temper'd with an Aire so mild
No Aprill suns that ere so gently smil'd:
No more shall heare that powerfull language charm.
Whose force oft spar'd the labour of his arm:
No more shall follow where he spent the dayes
In warres in counsell, or in pray'r, and praise,
Whose meanest acts he would himself advance
As ungirt David to the Arks did dance.
All All is gone of ours or his delight
In horses fierce wild deer or armour bright.
Francisca faire can nothing now but weep
Nor with soft notes shall sing his cares asleep.
I saw him dead, a leaden slumber lyes
And mortall sleep over those wakefull eys:
Those gentle Rayes under the lidds were fled
Which through his lookes that piercing sweetnesse she
That port which so Majestique was and strong,
Loose and depriv'd of vigour stretch'd along:
All wither'd, all discolour'd, pale and wan,
How much another thing, no more thatman?
Oh humane glory vaine, Oh death, Oh wings,
Oh worthlesse worth. Oh transitory things.
Yet dwelt that greatnesse in his shape decay'd
That still though dead greater than death he lay'd.
And in his alter'd face you something faigne
That threatens death he yet will live againe.
Not much unlike the saired Oake which shoots
To heav'n its branches and through earth its roots:
Whose spacious boughs are hung with Trophees row
And honour'd wreaths have oft the Victour crown
When angry Jove darts lightning through the Aire
At mortalls sins, nor his own plant will spare
(It groanes and bruses all below that stood
So many yeares the shelter of the wood)
The tree ere while foreshorten'd to our view
When foln shews taller yet then as it grew.
So shall his praise to after times increase
When truth shall be allow'd and faction cease.
And his own shadow with him fall. The Eye
Detracts from objects then it selfe more high:
But when death takes them from that envy'd seate
Seing how little we confesse how greate.
Thee many ages hence in martiall verse
Shall th' English souldier ere he charge rehearse:
Singing of thee influme themselves to fight
As long as rivers to the seas shall runne.
As long as Cynthia shall relieve the sunne,
While staggs shall fly unto the forests thick,
While sheep delight the grassy downs to pick,
As long as future time succeeds the past,
Always thy honour, praise and name shall last.
Thou in a pitch how farre, beyond the sphere
Of humane glory towr'st, and raigning there
Despoyld of mortall robes, in seas of cliyse
Plunging dost bathe, and tread the bright Abysse:
There thy greate soule yet once a world das see
Spacious enough and pure enough for thee.
How soon thou Moses hast and Josua found
And David for the Sword, and harpe renown'd?
How streight canst to each happy Mansion goe?
(Farr Better known above then here below)
And in those joyes dost spend the endlesse day
Which in expressing we our selves betray.
For we since thou art gone with heavy doome
Wander like ghosts about thy loved tombe:
And lost in tears have neither sight nor minde
To guide us upward through this Region blinde
Since thou art gone who best that way could'st fearn
Onely our sighs perhaps may thither reach.
And Richard yet where his great Parent led
Beats on the rugged track: He vertue dead
Revives, and by his milder beams assures;
And yet how much of them his griefe obscures?
He as his rather long was kept from sight
In private to be view'd by better light:
But open'd once, what splendour dos he throw
How he becomes that seat, how strongly streins
How gently winds at once the ruling Reins?
Heav'n to this choise prepar'd a Diadem
Richer then any Eastern silk or gemme:
A pearly rainbow; where the Sun inchas'd
His brows like an Imperiall Jewell grac'd.
We find already what those Omens mean.
Earth nere more glad, nor Heaven more serene:
Cease now our griefs, Calme peace succeeds a war
Rainbows to storms, Richard to Oliver.
Tempt not his clemency to try his pow'r
He threats no Deluge, yet fore tells a showre. 

If a poem could cost a dime
I will spend my ink and spend my time
Making the perfect rhyme

More than a million people may read it
Even if I have to sell it on credit
I will be the businesswoman with wit
Sit down! Think about it! 

A penny for the perfect sentence
A penny for a poem glaring with essence
A penny for writing about the present and past tense
A penny for describing a situation that is intense
A penny if I write truthfully without pretence
As I turn away from crime
Making the perfect rhyme

If a poem could cost a pound
I will turn my life around
As I compose the perfect poetic sound
That rhymes against any background

My words will be sublime
Not just the perfect rhyme
They will be read both at teatime and during bedtime
My sentences will mature in their prime with time
As I turn away from crime
Making the perfect rhyme

What can I say to you, darling,
When you ask me for help?
I do not even know the future
Or even what poetry
We are going to write.
Commit suicide. Go mad. Better people
Than either of us have tried it.
I loved you once but
I do not know the future.
I only know that I love strength in my friends
And greatness
And hate the way their bodies crack when they die
And are eaten by images.
The fun’s over. The picnic’s over.
Go mad. Commit suicide. There will be nothing left
After you die or go mad,
But the calmness of poetry. 

O Faithless World, & thy more faithless part, a Woman's heart!
The true Shop of variety, where sits nothing but fits
And feavers of desire, and pangs of love, which toyes remove. 
Why, was she born to please, or I to trust, words writ in dust?
Suffering her Eyes to govern my despair, my pain for air; 
And fruit of time rewarded with untruth, the food of youth.
Untrue she was : yet, I believ'd her eyes (instructed spies)
Till I was taught, that Love was but a School to breed a fool. 
Or sought she more by triumphs of denial, to make a trial
How far her smiles commanded my weakness? yield and confess,
Excuse no more thy folly; but for Cure, blush and endure
As well thy shame, as passions that were vain: and think, 'tis gain
To know, that Love lodg'd in a Womans brest, Is but a guest. 

There's a place i know  and love
A place called a poet's home
Pens and minds meet
Time, tears and gold were set.

People of all walks of life
Young and old, rich and poor like me
Spent thousands of words
To reach out, to express
The deepest thoughts
To be understood, as to be loved
To be comforted and be healed

We shared each others dreams
Our frustrations, our pains
Our joy, our expectation, our success
This is our venue to tell the whole world
That we are in love, frustrated and lonely

A Poem Hunter away, and this should be
Words of wisdom, touching and loving flow of words
Inspiring and lifting, we ought to be

Count me in, to make your day
I will always be here for you, whatever will be
To hug, to care and keep your blues away. 

Neither poems are lost treasure
nor they are means of pleasure
they are meant to be enjoyed by others
We need not go into it and bother

they are never lost from mind
They appear in many forms and we do find
there is place and existence
it has no past but real presence

Why do the thoughts emerge? 
Why do they compel and urge? 
Some happy moments to bear the shape? 
Though with some bitter moments of shame? 

It has equal bearing and importance
They invade sudden and at once
We got to give them place and honor
They may represent reality with horror

It may not be appreciated or liked by all
It may not be able to bring down the wall
But it will definitely pierce through the mind
Where it will generate the feelings very kind

It is simple projection coming out from clear conscience
It is reflective mood of the presence
It might  have witnessed many pulses of high magnitude
It may  speak nicely of the individual's attitude

Can any one take notes on piece of paper and write? 
Can that draw any attention when  you call some one  or invite? 
It may be commented as good or nice
But no one may commit or assure with   promise

Many may be writing with great skill and deep feeling
It may not be finding favor or end with reeling
It is not  the simple tact of conveying the message
It is not usual to come with the passing of the age

The poems are reflection of the natural mood
It acts like nourishment and serves as food
It is phenomenal development of the mind
It is generally  accepted for its rich kind

It is  nice medium to feel and convey
It responds to pure feelings and obey
It is not just putting of the simple views
This fact is realized by only few

The poems must find and be read in real context
It must have unique thinking with powerful text
It has writer's mind with powerful couplet
It should not meet cruel fate

The poems are read with zeal
 It is not fictitious but real
It may serve as tonic or meal
It can assuage your feelings or heal

It is reflective mood of the poet
He can compose all but can't keep quiet
The poems may serve as eternal ground
We may like it more with intense bond


He — or was it she? 
was a child who said little
but walked, endlessly, just looking

or stood still for minutes, hours, 
and became what they looked at

was from a large family
but still people said, you’re an only child aren’t you

was it seems very happy in themself
but no-one asked, so never said

kept themself to themself, which annoyed
other children, who bullied them

and then were even more annoyed
when they didn’t play the victim

failed examinations and yet
was always wrapt up in a book

occasionally did things like cutting themselves
and was told off but never questioned usefully

wrote poems secretly but was unconcerned
whether people read them or not

was good to be with as long as you
didn’t expect anything of them

was secretly loved by some
who never liked to say so

because what they loved somehow
didn’t have a name

years later, some of them read the poems
and knew what they had loved


Ignorance
Should flow in my head
As I’ve known nothing
Still
How can I? 
Play such tricky games
With my otherwise
Naïve pen
Materialized mind
And crystallized heart

Please don’t think of me 
An oracle
I’m just
An ignorant

Your pen spitting black ink like phlegm
Alphabets dancing like an amateur
Words concealing the true story
Metaphors so embarrassed like a bad comedian
Expression so artificial like of a cloned sheep
And
Then you call yourself
A Poet

Wow- Kamran! 
You have done a great job
Such a big lie
I speak to myself
Like a chocolaty truth
Whenever I produce
A good-looking poem


He has desired to go
Through untrod fields, 
Finding dull treasures others leave
And picks the greatest yields.

Some worthwhile gems he stores
For future times
Others he gently picks and cleans
Then writes them in as rhymes. 

Attentive eyes, fantastic heed,
Assessing minds, he does not need,
Nor urgent writs to sup or dine,
Nor pledges in the roseate wine.

For loud acclaim he does not care
By the august or rich or fair,
Nor for smart pilgrims from afar,
Curious on where his hauntings are.

But soon or later, when you hear
That he has doffed this wrinkled gear,
Some evening, at the first star-ray,
Come to his graveside, pause and say:

'Whatever his message his to tell
Two thoughtful women loved him well.'
Stand and say that amid the dim:
It will be praise enough for him. 

I believe i am a poet, hence i get up with an aim
to achieve my dream as i am well known across the globe.
The fact is if i wasn't a poet i would have been a criminal like my ancestors,
who lied for me to succeed like the other poets across the globe.

I am composing from experience,
because they thought i was insane in the brain.
Hence, i kept on believing in myself with the help from them when they paid for me to succeed.
The fact is i cannot start something,
which i cannot finish like them.



I saw the poet write
Brilliantly bright, 
A sublime poetry
With intricate artistry.

The poem was written
With a heart maybe love smitten, 
Not on a piece of paper
But upon the pages of nature.

I watched fascinated
Spellbound and enchanted
Quite wonder-struck
By his wonderful subtle work.

When the poet's work was done
All hearts would surely be won
For a lovely ‘rose' was spun
Under the cheerful sun. 

How can you describe a Poet? 
Within this poem I'll try, 
To define the un definable, 
Though this meaning may be shy. 

A keen observer of everything, 
Expresser of emotions untold, 
Author of a future not born yet, 
Seller of what can never be sold. 

A painter with colors of written prose, 
Sculptor of all of our dreams, 
Scriber of this worlds history, 
Photographer of most vivid scenes. 

The true believer in fantasy, 
The seeker of the unknown, 
The writer of a diary 
For the whole world to be shown. 

I think the creator of this world a poet, 
The smells, the tastes, the sights and sounds, 
Yes.. the Creator is certainly one of us, 
Don't believe me? .  .   

Look Around

There used to be inspiring words from poet
Kings used them on battle field when nothing was quiet
When it was to be do and die situation and could not wait
A poet can change complete scene with even fate

"Pen is mightier than sword" and impression permanent
No one can dare to face the truth and simple comment
Many autocrats and dictators have failed to face onslaught
They underestimated the power and were simply caught

Revolution is not brought in a day or two or all of sudden
It takes place only when all limits are crossed and roads lay open
When there is no other way than to die unnatural death
The course is automatically chosen irrespective of faith

When rivers are in spate they bring about complete destruction
They wait for none to guide and receive no instructions
It is momentum in their flow that clears the way
Aggressive posture with destruction and then coolly stay

Why poets of modern age are considered pawn in their game? 
Have they bartered away their interest `and share the blame
Are they not capable of leading anymore bloodless revolutions? 
Is it meek surrender on their part for without any resolutions? 

Are we not in streets for begging paltry sum in reward? 
Does the spirit and power is washed away in words? 
Is it not strange o beg for articles to be read on request? 
May be it is present day scene to go for any solution or quest

"I will read only when you read mine" curt reply is received
"I shall surely read yours" with this inner soul is deceived
Why at all there should be some unhealthy practice? 
Have we ever take note of it or any notice? 

I can assertively stand firm and say" I have bartered the soul"
I see nothing wrong in present age as I don’t smell foul
You have no means to survive and time has come crawl
There should be no reason why one should not make withdrawal

You are shot sure to rot if don’t change to circumstances
Renowned poets have died from poverty for instances
If some one has succeeded then it has remained only in text
It is really human plight and tragedy that is waited for next

Nature and sky has remained same for ever
So is the whether and rain with thunder forever
They come and go as usual in right hour
We don’t realize it and turn into sour


A poet everywhere and around
In nature, on mountain and in sound
Conveying the melody in beautiful words
As if spoken from mouth of lords
 
What if one gets no name
It is praiseworthy and no shame
Not all can be judged by the crowd
Still one feels internally very proud
 
It is divine pulse that is beating
All expectations and inspirations meeting
A peace with affection when openly meeting
A status he has quite naturally befitting
 
There is reward from almighty
No one must lament or feel pity
There is blessing for holding sanctity
This is what required as fine quality


Give me a poet for a lover
whose words stroke me like velvet hands.
Word-tender caresses more reaching
than the caress of a mere mortal man.

A poet's light touch is so gentle.
Word-fingers probe deep every time, 
arousing me, haunting me, wetting me, 
seducing me, body and mind.

give me a poet for a lover.
Lust and fire burn in his heart.
A silver-tongued devil whose words make me ache
to be on my knees in the dark.

Word-foreplay making me want him, 
only mind-loved, I want to be free 
to feel just one time, my poet inside, 
where only mind-lust up to now has loved me..    A poet!--He hath put his heart to school,
   Nor dares to move unpropped upon the staff
   Which art hath lodged within his hand--must laugh
   By precept only, and shed tears by rule.
   Thy Art be Nature; the live current quaff,
   And let the groveller sip his stagnant pool,
   In fear that else, when Critics grave and cool
   Have killed him, Scorn should write his epitaph.
   How does the Meadow-flower its bloom unfold?
  Because the lovely little flower is free
  Down to its root, and, in that freedom, bold;
  And so the grandeur of the Forest-tree
  Comes not by casting in a formal mould,
  But from its own divine vitality. 

Who am I to criticize others, 
I'm a poet in my own time, 
my own place and my own world.
I just write what I see feel, 
            and hear.

I don't follow the path
of other poets, but that's
ok, let them write what
they must write in their
          own way.

All poetry is beautiful, 
some takes longer to
          understand.

We're all in this together
we write the poetry that
          fulfills our needs.


(I don't remember, when this poet in me was born
What I remember is his softening of heart, 
Growing on the head and hunger to write.

With so much pain around
This world has suffocated 
The thoughts that freely lingered.

These flying thoughts roaming in the freedom of the air
returned from the painful journey
 by being severely hurt with pains floating around.

The poet in me has seen the nature's beauty
With admiration and jubilation
And wandered from dawn to dusk
It travelled on the flight of the air 
By flapping the wings of happiness
Spreading the message of peace
And collected the blessing of the Almighty
Spread all across the path to the wisdom

Today, Alas, In polluted air with hatred floating around
the despair wings struggle to flap
and find its way to pureness of wisdom
It travels on a never ending painful path

It sees the sea of suffering heads 
Hung before the shameless devils
Sucking the blood from innocent veins 
Fulfilling their thirst of greed
And enjoying the cry around.

The poet in me is crawling
In its knee, wounded and broken
Truly is shaken by the war and the cry
Of hapless souls carrying the rotten body 

They walk to meet my writing desires 
And narrate their painful story
Which my mind imagines not 
Nor my skills approve to jot down

I let my silent body, to take over 
The whirling mind with bubbling thoughts
And embrace them under its armpit
And sing a lullaby to make them sleep forever. 

St. Peter met her at heaven’s huge gate, 
asking who was she and why had she come.
"Why should I let such as ‘you’ enter in?  
I’m busy and there’s such a long line."

She held her head proudly and vouched for herself, 
told him her heart was honest and true, 
then went on to list her other good traits
and sat down for a breather when through.

He stood there just staring, a frown on his face, 
then proclaimed, "Access denied! "
Access denied?  Stunned, she started to cry
(for the option to heaven is wry) . 

She poured out a story of woe to the man.
"I’m just a poor poet, St. Peter, sir.
I did my very best all of my life
hurt no one did I.  maybe once, " she lied.

All of a sudden the gates opened wide.
There was St. Peter moving aside. 
"Dear poet, please come right on in."A young poet died
Reason unknown, doctors bemused 
Biologically, nothing was wrong
Heart was functioning properly
Lungs had no infections
Last lipid profile was d*mn good
Other laboratory results were within range
No head or body injury
No heart attack trails, 
then what could be the cause of this sudden death? 
The mystery was buzzing around the medical world
to write something in autopsy report as cause of death.
 
 
And then emerged another poet with some unusual complaints
And all doctors shifted their prime focus on him
May be they can relate something or may get some clue 
The complaints he had was acute shortage of ideas
Lack of creative imaginations, 
Evasive dreams and to top all, painless thoughts  
Feeling suffocative even with maximum oxygen around
Feeling lifeless even with normal heartbeats
Unable to converse even with brain functioning properly
Blood circulation customary, digestive system churning food.
 
The Autopsy report completed with findings: 

"Sudden attack of  imagenaria forced soul to vacate body causing nonfunctioning of biological body"If you give in to a rich man, he may give you a mansion, 
delicious foods, nice clothes and physical pleasure; 
he may give you a heart as dead as a withered river; 
he may love you too and make you the owner of a vast land.

Tell me, o virgin, can a mere land be the price of your body? 
Those who are the slaves of body are not able to recognize
the secret mines of mystery lying into the folds of your body.
Only the goldsmiths know the value of gold.

None but a poet knows what a jewel your beauty is.
Be my beloved, o girl, you will gain the life of a nymph.
For your one wink, I will give you the heart of all flowers 
and compose the new verses of kiss on your lips.

If you offer me your heart, o virgin, don't get afraid, 
all on a sudden, I will write an immortal epic for you. 

So many years walking in this lifetime
Seeing the vile truth about my existence
For ages I stayed pure in my soul but yet-
Sheer sin and evil is my fate and my soul design 
So I cover my fragile self into an illusion, 
A master of disguises of fallen dreams
The illusionist of clouded forbidden love
As I put up illusions into people minds
Charming everyone but blinding them horribly 
Seeing me truly is impossible, too complex 
Nightmares follow through these gifts of a poet
As even writing ninety five counting this one
Will be ninety six poems I created from the soul
But still something is trapped inside my chest-
Clawing, pounding and crushing everything inside

Something to be let out and need to be told
The guilt, the secrets and the ugly truths I have
As each slowly but surely will come out eventually
As my lover digs deeper in each conversion for direct answers 
And encounters the alter ego, the inner demon of a fallen angel
As I damn her trust as it is overpowering and nonresistant
All I can do now is block her with disguises but she see through them
Like fighting the venom of a king cobra inside your bloodstream and veins 
I fight with these emotions to show no weakness, confusion and depression
The unspeakable truth from the forbidden soul I have blacken and crumble  
From the corrupted mind that surrounded by the ashes of lost time and space

I have fought so many nightmares of my lover's absence and betrayal 
I have lasted years with this miserable life sucking parasitic called truth
So why suffer the wrath of a woman's scorn and the broken heart aftermath
But yet what heart I'm becoming HEARTLESS! ! ! Such cruelty in this world
Turning bitter and cold, been too misunderstood for too long and need to be freed
Every piece of my heart is picked up and dissected like a experiment inside laboratories 
Seeing what makes me tick and breakdown not only physically but also emotionally 
From down beneath me seeks only salvation and a little sense of direction in the world
So call it what you want to call it-A confession, a reminder or a breakthrough
But these are my thoughts and emotions I fight and struggle everyday of the week
For my bright inspired readers who follows the lies instead the truth in their lives
If you have something boiling in your gut or something eating inside you mentally 
Let everything go, the fears, the worries and the pain and just-tell your confessions


The dark wings of night enfolded the city upon which Nature had spread a pure white garment of snow; and men deserted the streets for their houses in search of warmth, while the north wind probed in contemplation of laying waste the gardens. There in the suburb stood an old hut heavily laden with snow and on the verge of falling. In a dark recess of that hovel was a poor bed in which a dying youth was lying, staring at the dim light of his oil lamp, made to flicker by the entering winds. He a man in the spring of life who foresaw fully that the peaceful hour of freeing himself from the clutches of life was fast nearing. He was awaiting Death's visit gratefully, and upon his pale face appeared the dawn of hope; and on his lops a sorrowful smile; and in his eyes forgiveness. 


He was breathing his last and had no one at his bedside save the oil lamp, his only companion, and some parchments upon which he had inscribed his heart's feeling. As he salvaged the remnants of his withering strength he lifted his hands heavenward; he moved his eyes hopelessly, as if wanting to penetrate the ceiling in order to see the stars from behind the veil clouds. 

And he said, "Come, oh beautiful Death; my soul is longing for you. Come close to me and unfasten the irons life, for I am weary of dragging them. Come, oh sweet Death, and deliver me from my neighbors who looked upon me as a stranger because I interpret to them the language of the angels. Hurry, oh peaceful Death, and carry me from these multitudes who left me in the dark corner of oblivion because I do not bleed the weak as they do. Come, oh gentle Death, and enfold me under your white wings, for my fellowmen are not in want of me. Embrace me, oh Death, full of love and mercy; let your lips touch my lips which never tasted a mother's kiss, not touched a sister's cheeks, not caresses a sweetheart's fingertips. Come and take me, by beloved Death
 


Then, at the bedside of the dying poet appeared an angel who possessed a supernatural and divine beauty, holding in her hand a wreath of lilies. She embraced him and closed his eyes so he could see no more, except with the eye of his spirit. She impressed a deep and long and gently withdrawn kiss that left and eternal smile of fulfillment upon his lips. Then the hovel became empty and nothing was lest save parchments and papers which the poet had strewn with bitter futility. 

Hundreds of years later, when the people of the city arose from the diseases slumber of ignorance and saw the dawn of knowledge, they erected a monument in the most beautiful garden of the city and celebrated a feast every year in honor of that poet, whose writings had freed them. Oh, how cruel is man's ignorance

If I can write
a poem or two in a day, 
say something that seems
worth saying, then I feel
I'm earning the space
I take up on the earth, 

though in point of fact, 
for all I know, my life
is going to hell


Whatever the poet's eyes see, 
And his mind imagines, 
And his pen elaborates, 
Or whatever is written, 
In his unseen note book, 
Are all true and beautiful? 

The poet knows deep in his heart, 
The colorful lotus that dances afloat, 
Has her root anchored in the dirty mud.
Only above water she blossoms from the bud.

'Beauty is truth, truth beauty', 
Poets glorify beauty with truth.
knowing or not, the root of beauty, 
May lie buried in ugliness, in sooth.


Dhaka
July Of public conflicts trained and bred? 
--First learn to love one living man; 
'Then' may'st thou think upon the dead. 

A Lawyer art thou?--draw not nigh! 
Go, carry to some fitter place 
The keenness of that practised eye, 
The hardness of that sallow face. 

Art thou a Man of purple cheer? 
A rosy Man, right plump to see? 
Approach; yet, Doctor, not too near, 
This grave no cushion is for thee. 

Or art thou one of gallant pride, 
A Soldier and no man of chaff? 
Welcome!--but lay thy sword aside, 
And lean upon a peasant's staff. 

Physician art thou? one, all eyes, 
Philosopher! a fingering slave, 
One that would peep and botanise 
Upon his mother's grave? 

Wrapt closely in thy sensual fleece, 
O turn aside,--and take, I pray, 
That he below may rest in peace, 
Thy ever-dwindling soul, away! 

A Moralist perchance appears; 
Led, Heaven knows how! to this poor sod: 
And he has neither eyes nor ears; 

One to whose smooth-rubbed soul can cling 
Nor form, nor feeling, great or small; 
A reasoning, self-sufficing thing, 
An intellectual All-in-all! 

Shut close the door; press down the latch; 
Sleep in thy intellectual crust; 
Nor lose ten tickings of thy watch 
Near this unprofitable dust. 

But who is He, with modest looks, 
And clad in homely russet brown? 
He murmurs near the running brooks 
A music sweeter than their own. 

He is retired as noontide dew, 
Or fountain in a noon-day grove; 
And you must love him, ere to you 
He will seem worthy of your love. 

The outward shows of sky and earth, 
Of hill and valley, he has viewed; 
And impulses of deeper birth 
Have come to him in solitude. 

In common things that round us lie 
Some random truths he can impart,-- 
The harvest of a quiet eye 
That broods and sleeps on his own heart. 

But he is weak; both Man and Boy, 
Hath been an idler in the land; 
Contented if he might enjoy 
The things which others understand. 

--Come hither in thy hour of strength; 
Come, weak as is a breaking wave! 
Here stretch thy body at full length; 
Or build thy house upon this grave. 

To fly like eagles without wings 
on ideas and imaginations 
To craft creative work like weaver bird 
To make his poem roar like lions 
 
To paint a poem like Picasso’s work 
To compose a poem like Mozart’s tunes 
To construct a poem like Oscar Niemeyer’s architect work 
To invent a verse of poem like Albert Einstein’s inventions 
 
To see his poem shining like moon 
To see his poems often making rainbow's colour 
To see his poem enticing like waterfall 
To see his poem standing like Mount Everest. 

He had a poet’s heart
When he melted with pain at the sight of a wounded bird
Like an ice cube melting in summer’s heat
The helpless eyes of grieving bird’s mate
Turned his heart’s cries into verses of poetry
This famous story is an inspiration
For poets around the world

On rainy days a poet’s imagination streams and floats
Like a little paper boat in gushing rainwater
It giggles and laughs with little children
Playing in rainwater
It captures the adventures of a raindrop
Falling in puddles of city streets
Floating through winding alleys
And walkways to settle in creek bed

A poet’s eyes notice the forehead of young women 
Working in rice paddies
And sees the sweat shimmer like dew drops
To offers cool relief to their sun burnt faces
The flame of life burning in their soul
Registers in his song  

In winter his voice slips and slides on the frozen lake
And dances with the moon light beams

Spring brings a blossoming to his heart
Like a bee he goes from flower to flower
Seeking the meaning of life in their tender love
His songs are carried away on the wings of humming bird
He renders his life for the sake of love
Like a moth falling on the burning candle wick

Limitless are the imaginations of a poet’s heart
And vivid are sketches unveiling the mystery of this world

This poet’s heart hidden in all
Goes unnoticed unexplored
Shrouded in vague thoughts
Like running water under ice 
When we relish and rejoice
In life around us 
And learn to recreate it in our words
The veil is lifted

If I could catch the flicker of a thought
Dancing in my head
That would touch the heart
Mine as well as yours
And is as inspiring and revealing of my world
As the golden rays of dawn
Longing to pen it on paper
I too knock on poet’s world. 

We poet's need, his or her outlet! 
Where we can write down the words that clutter up our minds.
It is a curse to have such a talent 
placing ones feelings, of words sometimes in rhyme. 

Not just anyone, can master this feat 
I'm not saying that, I really have. 
But I have been pluged into this poet's outlet 
the same as you, and for that I'm really glad. 

I read some of your poems, then maybe you read some of mine? 
Whatever the case might be, everyone different
and most of which are really fine. 

I haven't a knack, for non-rhyming poems
It really isn't, this Poet's, poetic style. 
But for those that do, I kindly read them through
and with wonderment puzzled, scratch my head and smile.

I think this currents, ' two twenty? '
Because, I go about writing, real fast! 
But I always wonder, maybe you do too? 
Thinking, 'How long is this streak of poetry, going to last? '

Whatever length of time we're all given 
'Bravo! ', I say to you! 
Now are we going to get a bill? 
Pluging into these outlets used? 
'Oh my! ', I'll have to end it here! '
Because I think, I'VE JUST BLOWN, MY POET'S OUTLET FUSE!  'All is lost forever 
The light has faded from the brink of the horizon
The season of dreams has ended once and for all 
There will be no more festivals in my life
I can never rewind my days but should I not love again
Fate has sealed all odds forever, 
No drama will be replete with more emotion 
Is the poetry about lost love over now
Will I never be loved in life
Does love cease when fulfilled 
Can a poet revel in the aptness of only his verse 
At least my  love was genuine
M poem is a  page in the open book of life 
Accept these lines as a homage, my love 
I cannot reach you through any other medium 
Let my unfulfilled love remain, as the wine of my memories, 
Look into the eyes of this bard O world
It burns with the fire of hope
Brood in the span of a years 
She still will be a distant dream, 
Gone are those days when she used to reply
There is no more tear or laughter in life
Shed this burden of love O heart
And bind yourself to a divine tryst
But do you feel that I will be dazed, under the spell you cast till death, 
My morning  is now fresh as a dewdropp 
Which glistens with the vision of many a sleepless hour 
Making life a festival in an orb of dreams 
This fête is fleeting as the dropp breaks 
To shrink and  vanish from the world of life, 
Until a new rainbow emerges in a second orb 
My sleepless hours will keep gathering memories
For such dreams I see in my morning hour. 

A poet's soul never sleeps
For sleep would be the death of creativity
That which fuels innovation and love making
Painting murals on whitewashed walls
It flourishes in the darkened alleyways
Black cats purring at the sound of unwritten words
And in the meadows where tulips provoke the purest of emotions


Let my words be th' words others have not used; 
let my words have the footsteps of their own, 
in the measure-and-rhyme-form well pen-fused
by hand: images through words of ink shown.
 
Let my words have th' splendour of the new morn
sighted by kindled eyes, or the fragrance
fresh the nose takes in and out; never worn
shall be th' light they give as experience.
 
Out of the pen, shall my words continue
to flow with originality's sound
energy, their beats e'er novel to glue
the hearts to heaven, where the stars astound.
 
When at last they have gold's worth, I rejoice
with heart content they are of a marked voice. 

Part One


The power of charity sows deep in my heart, and I reap and gather the wheat in bundles and give them to the hungry. 

My soul gives life to the grapevine and I press its bunches and give the juice to the thirsty. 

Heaven fills my lamp with oil and I place it at my window to direct the stranger through the dark. 

I do all these things because I live in them; and if destiny should tie my hands and prevent me from so doing, then death would be my only desire. For I am a poet, and if I cannot give, I shall refuse to receive. 


Human kinds cling to earthly things, but I seek ever to embrace the torch of love so it will purify me by its fire and sear inhumanity from my heart. 

Substantial things deaden a man without suffering; love awakens him with enlivening pains. 

Humans are divided into different clans and tribes, and belong to countries and towns. But I find myself a stranger to all communities and belong to no settlement. The universe is my country and the human family is my tribe. 

Men are weak, and it is sad that they divide amongst themselves. The world is narrow and it is unwise to cleave it into kingdoms, empires, and provinces. 

Human kinds unite themselves one to destroy the temples of the soul, and they join hands to build edifices for earthly bodies. I stand alone listening to the voice of hope in my deep self saying, "As love enlivens a man's heart with pain, so ignorance teaches him the way of knowledge

" Pain and ignorance lead to great joy and knowledge because the Supreme Being has created nothing vain under the sun. 



Part Two


I have a yearning for my beautiful country, and I love its people because of their misery. But if my people rose, stimulated by plunder and motivated by what they call "patriotic spirit" to murder, and invaded my neighbor's country, then upon the committing of any human atrocity I would hate my people and my country. 

I sing the praise of my birthplace and long to see the home of my children; but if the people in that home refused to shelter and feed the needy wayfarer, I would convert my praise into anger and my longing to forgetfulness. My inner voice would say, "The house that does not comfort the need is worthy of naught by destruction
 



Humanity is the spirit of the Supreme Being on earth, and that humanity is standing amidst ruins, hiding its nakedness behind tattered rags, shedding tears upon hollow cheeks, and calling for its children with pitiful voice. But the children are busy singing their clan's anthem; they are busy sharpening the swords and cannot hear the cry of their mothers. 

Humanity appeals to its people but they listen not. Were one to listen, and console a mother by wiping her tears, other would say, "He is weak, affected by sentiment
 


 


Jerusalem could not kill The Nazarene, nor Athens Socrates; they are living yet and shall live eternally. Ridicule cannot triumph over the followers of Deity. They live and grow forever. 



Part Three


Thou art my brother because you are a human, and we both are sons of one Holy Spirit; we are equal and made of the same earth. 

You are here as my companion along the path of life, and my aid in understanding the meaning of hidden Truth. You are a human, and, that fact sufficing, I love you as a brother. You may speak of me as you choose, for Tomorrow shall take you away and will use your talk as evidence for his judgment, and you shall receive justice. 

You may deprive me of whatever I possess, for my greed instigated the amassing of wealth and you are entitled to my lot if it will satisfy you. 

You may do unto me whatever you wish, but you shall not be able to touch my Truth. 

You may shed my blood and burn my body, but you cannot kill or hurt my spirit. 

You may tie my hands with chains and my feet with shackles, and put me in the dark prison, but who shall not enslave my thinking, for it is free, like the breeze in the spacious sky. 

You are my brother and I love you. I love you worshipping in your church, kneeling in your temple, and praying in your mosque. You and I and all are children of one religion, for the varied paths of religion are but the fingers of the loving hand of the Supreme Being, extended to all, offering completeness of spirit to all, anxious to receive all. 

I love you for your Truth, derived from your knowledge; that Truth which I cannot see because of my ignorance. But I respect it as a divine thing, for it is the deed of the spirit. Your Truth shall meet my Truth in the coming world and blend together like the fragrance of flowers and becoming one whole and eternal Truth, perpetuating and living in the eternity of Love and Beauty. 

I love you because you are weak before the strong oppressor, and poor before the greedy rich. For these reasons I shed tears and comfort you; and from behind my tears I see you embraced in the arms of Justice, smiling and forgiving your persecutors. You are my brother and I love you. 



Part Four


You are my brother, but why are you quarreling with me? Why do you invade my country and try to subjugate me for the sake of pleasing those who are seeking glory and authority? 

Why do you leave your wife and children and follow Death to the distant land for the sake of those who buy glory with your blood, and high honor with your mother's tears? 

Is it an honor for a man to kill his brother man? If you deem it an honor, let it be an act of worship, and erect a temple to Cain who slew his brother Abel. 

Is self-preservation the first law of Nature? Why, then, does Greed urge you to self-sacrifice in order only to achieve his aim in hurting your brothers? Beware, my brother, of the leader who says, "Love of existence obliges us to deprive the people of their rights!" I say unto you but this: protecting others' rights is the noblest and most beautiful human act; if my existence requires that I kill others, then death is more honorable to me, and if I cannot find someone to kill me for the protection of my honor, I will not hesitate to take my life by my own hands for the sake of Eternity before Eternity comes. 

Selfishness, my brother, is the cause of blind superiority, and superiority creates clanship, and clanship creates authority which leads to discord and subjugation. 

The soul believes in the power of knowledge and justice over dark ignorance; it denies the authority that supplies the swords to defend and strengthen ignorance and oppression - that authority which destroyed Babylon and shook the foundation of Jerusalem and left Rome in ruins. It is that which made people call criminals great mean; made writers respect their names; made historians relate the stories of their inhumanity in manner of praise. 

The only authority I obey is the knowledge of guarding and acquiescing in the Natural Law of Justice. 

What justice does authority display when it kills the killer? When it imprisons the robber? When it descends on a neighborhood country and slays its people? What does justice think of the authority under which a killer punishes the one who kills, and a thief sentences the one who steals? 

You are my brother, and I love you; and Love is justice with its full intensity and dignity. If justice did not support my love for you, regardless of your tribe and community, I would be a deceiver concealing the ugliness of selfishness behind the outer garment of pure love. 



Conclusion


My soul is my friend who consoles me in misery and distress of life. He who does not befriend his soul is an enemy of humanity, and he who does not find human guidance within himself will perish desperately. Life emerges from within, and derives not from environs. 

I came to say a word and I shall say it now. But if death prevents its uttering, it will be said tomorrow, for tomorrow never leaves a secret in the book of eternity.


If they close my ears I will enjoy the touch of the breeze mixed with the incebse of love and the fragrance of beauty.

If they place me in a vacuum, I will live together with my soul, the child of love and beauty.

I came here to be for all and with all, and what I do today in my solitude will be echoed by tomorrow to the people.

What I say now with one heart will be said tomorrow by many hearts


You have taken our love and turned it into coins of silver.
You sell the love poems you wrote for me,
And with the price of them you buy many cups of wine.
I beg that you remain dumb,
That you write no more poems.
For the wine does us both an injury,
And the words of your heart
Have become the common speech of the Emperor's concubines. 

A poet wrote his WILL saying: 

When I die take me through
garden as I wish to accumulate
scent of nature, smile of flowers
buzzing of bees, wind passing leaves.

Take me from river bank
I will capture the sound of water
fish jumping up and down
waves of happiness.

Take me from street where
orphans are playing in mud
beggars are struggling to smudge
hopes are crawling in pains.

Take me from from big market
With full of skyscrapers where
light is struggling to make way
trust and faith is being trade (ed) 

Finally lay me in my grave yard
sprinkle it with drops of thoughts
of unsung songs, unsaid words
unfulfilled hopes and dreams
till last heart dwells on earth. 

Have Gentlemen perhaps forgotten this?- 
We write the histories.

Do Gentlemen who snigger at the poets,
Who speak the word professor with guffaws- 
Do Gentlemen expect their fame to flourish
When we, not they, distribute the applause?

Or do they trust their hope of long remembrance
To those they name with such respectful care- 
To those who write the tittle in the papers,
To those who tell the tattle on the air?

Do Gentlemen expect the generation
That counts the losers out when tolls the bell
To take some gossip-caster's estimation,
Some junior voice of fame with fish to sell?

Do Gentlement believe time's hard-boiled jury,
Judging the sober truth, will trust again
The words some copperhead who owned a paper
Ordered one Friday from the hired men?

Have Gentlemen forgotten Mr. Linoln?

A poet wrote that story, not a newspaper,
Not the New Yorker of the nameless name
Who spat with hatred like some others later
And left, as they, in his hate his shame.

History's not written in the kind of ink
The richest man of most ambitious mind
Who hates a president enough to print
A daily paper can afford or find.

Gentlemen have power now and know it,
But even the great and most famous kings
Feared and with reason to offend the poets
Who songs are marble
				 and who marble sings. 

A poet I claim not to be, 
For words are never there. 
In all the years I've tried to write, 
I have no words to share. 

I sit and think but nothing comes, 
No inspiration here. 
I want to write of anything, 
But still no words I fear. 

I read the works of other poets, 
I wish I were like them. 
How do they write such beautiful lines, 
A poet, I'm not him. 

I try to write from the heart, 
From deep within my soul. 
I try to write of the love I have, 
But cannot reach my goal. 

But why I ask, why can't I write, 
Of love so pure and true. 
Why can't I write about her eyes, 
A mix of green and blue. 

I want to write about her smile, 
It brightens up my day. 
I try to think of anything, 
But words I cannot say. 

I wish I knew how to write, 
A poem with such bliss. 
I wish I knew how to describe, 
Her soft but tender kiss. 

I cannot even begin to write, 
How she holds me tight. 
How her arms around me, 
Makes everything just right. 

A poet does not have to think, 
The words flow right out. 
When I sit and try to write, 
I want to scream and shout. 

I mean come on, how hard can it be, 
To write about her hair.
Such long beautiful natural blonde, 
That flows in the air. 

I try to write about her laugh, 
The words will not fly. 
Time passes and finally, 
I say it's soft and high. 

It's been an hour and a half, 
I'm here on verse twelve. 
I had to go to Rhymezone, 
To find out the rhyme is shelve. 

A poet does not do that, 
Go online to find a rhyme. 
A poet has it in his head, 
And can write at any time.

But a poet I am not, 
For I cannot write of love. 
How the girl I am with, 
Is an angel from up above. 

How I love her with all my heart, 
And want to spend my life with her. 
How her love for me is more, 
Than I can ever be for sure. 

As I draw near the end, 
My mind is not so numb. 
I realize I've just written of love, 
A poet I have become. 

Tiny bit of humanity, 
Blessed with your mother’s face, 
And cursed with your father’s mind. 

I say cursed with your father’s mind, 
Because you can lie so long and so quietly on your back, 
Playing with the dimpled big toe of your left foot, 
And looking away, 
Through the ceiling of the room, and beyond. 
Can it be that already you are thinking of being a poet? 

Why don’t you kick and howl, 
And make the neighbors talk about 
"That damned baby next door," 
And make up your mind forthwith 
To grow up and be a banker 
Or a politician or some other sort of go-getter 
Or—?—whatever you decide upon, 
Rid yourself of these incipient thoughts 
About being a poet. 

For poets no longer are makers of songs, 
Chanters of the gold and purple harvest, 
Sayers of the glories of earth and sky, 
Of the sweet pain of love 
And the keen joy of living; 
No longer dreamers of the essential dreams, 
And interpreters of the eternal truth, 
Through the eternal beauty. 
Poets these days are unfortunate fellows. 
Baffled in trying to say old things in a new way 
Or new things in an old language, 
They talk abracadabra 
In an unknown tongue, 
Each one fashioning for himself 
A wordy world of shadow problems, 
And as a self-imagined Atlas, 
Struggling under it with puny legs and arms, 
Groaning out incoherent complaints at his load. 

My son, this is no time nor place for a poet; 
Grow up and join the big, busy crowd 
That scrambles for what it thinks it wants 
Out of this old world which is—as it is— 
And, probably, always will be. 

Take the advice of a father who knows: 
You cannot begin too young 
Not to be a poet. 

I BRING you with reverent hands
The books of my numberless dreams,
White woman that passion has worn
As the tide wears the dove-grey sands,
And with heart more old than the horn
That is brimmed from the pale fire of time:
White woman with numberless dreams,
I bring you my passionate rhyme. 

I want to be a great poet
Make you think and ask questions
Seek the answer to know it
Beautiful poems I want to write

Deep in your heart I want to touch
Bring what I see into your site
Can I get you to laugh and cry

I want to write with conviction
To be able tell stories of rhyme
That makes me have to consider
How to write every line

With words new things I will try
Invoke an emotion inside
So you have an experience
Lay it all out on the line

To all the poets of the world
The masters of this very gift
I want to learn  to write from you

So Edger Allen Poe will teach
Shakespeare will educate too
Wordology I will seek
Till I am a master that's new


How I yearn to write in free verse, 
Free from rhythm, cadence and
Free to roam about ethereally
In some never-never land.

The muse of Erato is upon me. 

I
have an urge to write with
vagueness and abstraction, to cloak
my meanings in surrealism and mystery.
Perhaps I could of write of passion, joy, 
sadness, despair, longings, angers, 
envies and doubts. I could write of
depressions and elations, using
platitudes and beautitudes. 

I must write
of sad yesterdays and hope-filled
tomorrows and tell of my misty dreams
and future schemes.. 

Ah! Yes, these would
be great topics, free from the shackles of
rhyme. 

My success depends on your ability
to interpret what I have written. Could I 
yet become the Picasso of poetry? 
Do I dismiss the beauty of Shakespeare's sonnets? 
Do I discard the delicate inner-woven rhythms
of Poe? Was Frost on the wrong road in his
'The Road Not Taken'? I would doubt that.

But when I take my pen in hand
To write new poetry, 
It still comes out in rhythmic form.

And oft published essay, drawing much
praise and much criticism"Hi, how do the poetic thoughts emerge in mind"? 
I was unable to react and reply to the question of its kind
I had to struggle hard for the answer to find 
I just kept cool and struggled in mind

I pleaded her for putting good thoughts across
You must have enough of trust in cross
It is not brilliance of an individual
You get it with blessings very casual

it got to be translated into words immediately
It may have no use if done very lately
Its real impact and feelings may go away
You may not have any means to recollect or find the way

It can be great moment of joy for self and family
It has not been forced on you heavily
The family and friends definitely strengthen the line
You exceedingly perform well and feel very fine

There is no dearth of good thoughts all over
It has good backing and natural cover
To translate and add color to it is not that difficult
Such quality is inherent and inbuilt

You can nicely compose if you determine one day
You may certainly find the resolve and clear way
There is every possibility of surging ahead
You may one day excel and definitely lead

You should have natural instinct to pick up leads
Try to put in fine composition with interwoven words
It may result in fine creation of poetry
you may have then full satisfaction with remarkable entry

You can try to translate feelings into action
It must have fine combination with good reaction
It may give then good sense of satisfaction
This is poetry skill and very good indication


It is poetic world
Flow of nice words
No creation of upheaval
Words to look nice and real

It is for peace
Life to be at ease
New energy to release
All hostilities to cease

No storm to come and lash
No breach in shore and wash
It may be with message of danger
To come out of it without any anger

The world may be facing disasters
You may knell down before masters
Your feet may crumble
You got to be very humble

It is platform to spread message
Find the place in heart with good passage
The world to live in fantasy
No use of asking for any clemency

Better world with enough humor
Not to pierce through shield or armor
Rule the heart that needs solace
Will it be there in any palace

Dear Anna, -- Between friend and friend,
Prose answers every common end;
Serves, in a plain and homely way,
To express the occurrence of the day;
Our health, the weather, and the news,
What walks we take, what books we choose,
And all the floating thoughts we find
Upon the surface of the mind.
But when a poet takes the pen,
Far more alive than other men,
He feels a gentle tingling come
Down to his finger and his thumb,
Derived from nature's noblest part,
The centre of a glowing heart:
And this is what the world, who knows
No flights above the pitch of prose,
His more sublime vagaries slighting,
Denominates an itch for writing.
No wonder I, who scribble rhyme
To catch the triflers of the time,
And tell them truths divine and clear,
Which, couched in prose, they will not hear;
Who laboured hard to allure and draw
The loiterers I never saw,
Should feel that itching and that tingling
With all my purpose intermingling,
To your intrinsic merit true,
When called to address myself to you.
Mysterious are His ways, whose power
Brings forth that unexpected hour,
When minds, that never met before,
Shall meet, unite, and part no more;
It is the allotment of the skies,
The hand of the Supremely Wise,
That guides and governs our affections,
And plans and orders our connections:
Directs us in our distant road,
And marks the bounds of our abode.
Thus we were settled when you found us,
Peasants and children all around us,
Not dreaming of so dear a friend,
Deep in the abyss of Silver-End.
Thus Martha, even against her will,
Perched on the top of yonder hill;
And you, though you must needs prefer
The fairer scenes of sweet Sancerre,
Are come from distant Loire, to choose
A cottage on the banks of Ouse.
This page of Providence quite new,
And now just opening to our view,
Employs our present thoughts and pains
To guess, and spell, what it contains:
But day by day, and year by year,
Will make the dark enigma clear;
And furnish us, perhaps, at last,
Like other scenes already past,
With proof, that we, and our affairs,
The purport of his deep decrees,
Sheds every hour a clearer light
In aid of our defective sight;
And spreads, at length, before the soul
A beautiful and perfect whole,
Which busy man's inventive brain
Toils to anticipate, in vain.
Say, Anna, had you never grown
The beauties of a rose full blown,
Could you, though luminous your eye,
By looking on the bud descry,
Or guess, with a prophetic power,
The future splendour of the flower?
Just so, the Omnipotent, who turns 
The system of a world's concerns,
From mere minutiae can educe
Events of most important use,
And bid a dawning sky display
The blaze of a meridian day.
The works of man tend, one and all,
As needs they must, from great to small;
And vanity absorbs at length
The monuments of human strength.
But who can tell how vast the plan
Which this day's incident began?
Too small, perhaps, the slight occasion
For our dim-sighted observation;
It passed unnoticed, as the bird
That cleaves the yielding air unheard,
And yet may prove, when understood,
A harbinger of endless good.
Not that I deem, or mean to call
Friendship a blessing cheap or small;
But merely to remark, that ours,
Like some of nature's sweetest flowers,
Rose from a seed of tiny size,
That seemed to promise no such prize;
A transient visit intervening,
And made almost without a meaning,
(Hardly the effect of inclination),
Produced a friendship, then begun,
That has cemented us in one;
And placed it in our power to prove,
By long fidelity and love,
That Solomon has wisely spoken,--
'A threefold cord is not soon broken.

'My trembling muse your honour does address,
That it's a bold attempt most humbly I confess;
If you'll encourage her young fagging flight,
She'll upwards soar and mount Parnassus' height.
If little things with great may be compared
In Rome it so with the divine Virgil fared;
The tuneful bard Augustus did inspire,
Made his great genius flash poetic fire;
But if upon my flight your honour frowns,
The muse folds up her wings, and dying - justice owns. 

I read to the entire plebe class,
in two batches. Twice the hall filled
with bodies dressed alike, each toting
a copy of my book. What would my
shrink say, if I had one, about
such a dream, if it were a dream?

Question and answer time.
"Sir," a cadet yelled from the balcony,
and gave his name and rank, and then,
closing his parentheses, yelled
"Sir" again. "Why do your poems give
me a headache when I try

to understand them?" he asked. "Do
you want that?" I have a gift for
gentle jokes to defuse tension,
but this was not the time to use it.
"I try to write as well as I can
what it feels like to be human,"

I started, picking my way care-
fully, for he and I were, after
all, pained by the same dumb longings.
"I try to say what I don't know
how to say, but of course I can't
get much of it down at all


By now I was sweating bullets.
unless the truth is, if there is
a truth

" Silence hung in the hall
like a heavy fabric. My own
head ached. "Sir," he yelled. "Thank you. Sir




My love for you is a boundless ocean 
But the world can only see drops of it, 

My feelings about you flow incessantly 
But the world can only know notions, 

My thoughts about you are pure like nectar 
But the world can only taste drops, 

My hope is like the constant sea 
But the world can know only a separate shore, 

My dreams are all vastly coloured 
But the world can only see seven colours, 

My mind is flooded with memories about you 

But the world can read only a few lines, 

My days have become eternal with your brief presence 
Though the world will call it seconds. 

As you flick through my pages
and surrender to my thoughtful and playful words
Remember I am just another actress 
on this very frightful dark stage

As a poet
Its all about display
Its all about the audience
The booing or thunderous clapping
can be substituted 
by bestowing me with genuine ratings

Your random comments
will be appreciated
any time, any place, any moment
as I am on a mission
To write a million words
spice up my wordly performance
with some occasional romance

I am on a mission to write
about the people, politicians and musicians
To write about the prostitutes
That roam the redlight district each single minute

I am on a mission to write about me and you
to write about the world 
and everything thats brand new or true

Now and then 
I may have the writers block
Its easy to laugh
Its easy to mock
But you inspire my imagination
You are all my inspiration
as you flick through my pages

co. 

you've entrusted me with this gift
and though my life may not be perfect 
i promise to use it
you've giving me the ability to write
and for that i ask you guide my endeavors
I've seen many try and succeed
so i will try 
may my lyrics influence the mind of the younger generation
and may i be immortalized not in flesh
but in mind and heart
not only in the heart of my family 
but the heart of many long after am gone
of a generation as i lay emotion 
far from anything that i can show
into writing.
so your guidance is all i ask


Thou's welcome, wean; mishanter fa' me, 
If thoughts o' thee, or yet thy mammie, 
Shall ever daunton me or awe me, 
My sweet wee lady, 
Or if I blush when thou shalt ca' me 
Tyta or daddie. 
 
Tho' now they ca' me fornicator, 
An' tease my name in countra clatter, 
The mair they talk, I'm kend the better, 
E'en let them clash; 
An auld wife's tongue's a feckless matter 
To gie ane fash. 
 
Welcome! my bonie, sweet, wee dochter, 
Tho' ye come here a wee unsought for, 
And tho' your comin' I hae fought for, 
Baith kirk and queir; 
Yet, by my faith, ye're no unwrought for, 
That I shall swear! 
 
Sweet fruit o' monie a merry dint, 
My funny toil is no a' tint, 
Tho' thou cam to the warl' asklent, 
Which fools may scoff at; 
In my last plack thy part's be in't 
The better ha'f o't. 
 
Tho' I should be the waur bestead, 
Thou's be as braw and bienly clad, 
And thy young years as nicely bred 
Wi' education, 
As onie brat o' wedlock's bed, 
In a' thy station. 
 
Wee image o' my bonie Betty, 
As fatherly I kiss and daut thee, 
As dear and near my heart I set thee 
Wi' as gude will 
As a' the priests had seen me get thee 
That's out o' hell. 
 
Thy mither's person, grace, an' merit, 
An' thy poor, worthless daddy's spirit, 
Without his failins, 
'Twill please me mair to see thee heir it, 
Than stockit mailens. 
 
For if thou be what I wad hae thee, 
And tak the counsel I shall gie thee, 
I'll never rue my trouble wi' thee - 
The cost nor shame o't, 
But be a loving father to thee, 
And brag the name o't. 

An affable desire rising from deeps of my heart
To search for a point where you and I can meet
A segue from rift to harmony
A soft touch, a moment of peace
A place to rest for restless mind 
When bitter redundant passions turn sangfroid
I look around to see sky and earth meeting at horizon
The sanguine dusk embracing the night and day
The river rushing to meet the ocean
All my life I have been searching for something like wise
Never knowing the abscess of sorrow 
Needs to be dissolved first to seek joy
The nub of life- the point of nirvana
But I need you to hold my hand to walk with me
Let's walk together in a world 
Where mysteries of life still unfold
All those years I have tried to touch you in vain
I will take two steps for your one
But you have to move from your point of isolation. 

Riding on wings of imagination I fly-
Fly to catch the colors of rainbow, 
To float with deep blue clouds, 
To become one with a peck of seagulls.
The soft breeze caress me
A flying eagle takes me under his wings as to
Shield me from menacing rays of burning sun
That is when I look down to see you
Calling me, cautioning me against the perils of
Unrestricted flights of mind.
Walking between the thin line of dreams and reality
I know you to be my lifeline.
The world beneath me is hard and cold, 
Its cruel drudgery hampers my spirit.
Even in your loving embrace I flutter
Like a butterfly caught in a spider web.
Again and again I break loose to fly
To catch my dreams-
That bottomless pit of circular motion
Which has no walls to support me.
Merging with its speed I still see you as my lifeline
But wish for a point of no return. 

One way to be in good attitude
is with sincere, heartfelt gratitude
It's like, your heart sweet smile
beamed by your soul as your profile




I was angry with my friend:
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did grow.

And I watered it in fears,
Night and morning with my tears; 
And I sunned it with smiles,
And with soft deceitful wiles.

And it grew both day and night,
Till it bore an apple bright.
And my foe beheld it shine.
And he knew that it was mine,

And into my garden stole
When the night had veiled the pole; 
In the morning glad I see
My foe outstretched beneath the tree. 

If each breathe is a frozen sleep
If each exhale is a pleasure deep
And if blurs sail over the ocean
And my eyes; the only vision
I see between the lines, in
Hues of blue and azure; 
And that side I am allured, 
Is dreamt, then I, in my field, 
Alone, with tears of hope. 

All the huskies are eaten. There is no space 
left in the diary, And the beads of quick 
words scatter over his spouse's sepia-shaded face 
adding the date in question like a mole to her lovely cheek. 
Next, the snapshot of his sister. He doesn't spare his kin: 
what's been reached is the highest possible latitude! 
And, like the silk stocking of a burlesque half-nude 

Thou are the world’s moderator! 
Politics last refuge of rouges 
Says the world; I join not those folks! 

Bless me prove me different kind
A new breed of different mind
To serve one and all truthfully
Sans bias and prejudice frankly! 

Let me serve the poor and needy
With all my mind, soul and body
Chance Thee gave to love all, serve all
And make my society quite tall! 

Bless me to be straight and honest 
Make me live noble and modest
Ever ready to help and serve
Never a prey to power and lust! 

That Omnipresent corruption
Never be my expectation
‘Let me end it’ be my passion

Have we polluted ourselves completely? 
Is there any dramatic change very lately? 
Is there still any thing left to think seriously? 
There is serious matter danger looms large obviously

There is all-round poor rating and dismal show
We are at low ebb and no willingness to grow
There is systematic genocide and currently flow
In our actions, thoughts and in mind it blows

No field is left untouched
Greenery has disappeared and forests are torched
New and unknown fields are searched
Everything has come to our possession and encroached

We have developed the tendency to grab
We go cautiously and advance step by step
We take enough care to see that there are no lapses
It must remain there unnoticed and not reported as cases

It is tremendous job undertaken by us
We don’t express regret or make any fuss
We are preparing for works holocaust and disaster
There is no fear from any one and act as great master

There is pollution in mind where all dangerous ideas emanate
It not only encourages such move but cleverly generate
It has nothing to do with human race at any rate
It is deliberate move to annihilate entire race on particular date

We have embarked upon a gigantic project with masterly stroke
It may take years to come to the light and people woke up
It is dangerous ploy to play with precious lives
People may condemn it later as they firmly believe

Nature and human race has lived for centuries together
Nothing has changed in sense and remained intact together
No one can think of playing with fire in their own house
It may certainly endanger survival and people may certainly grouse

The toxic waste in natural flow of river can drive to destruction
This is done purely without any sensible thinking and deliberate instructions
The entire population living on the banks may face their lives at stake
The industries may be enjoying the fruits and cutting the cakes


Everybody is concerned of material gain and it has remained main thrust
They have no regard for human lives and lot the complete trust
We have polluted our minds at dangerous level
We have only one aim and that is to gain and excel

It is strange thing that has developed in our mind
It s implication may come to be known whenever we find
Nature may not remain mere spectator and prove very kind
It may have its own role to teach and warn the blinds


Bees build around red liver, 
Ants build around black bone. 
It has begun: the tearing, the trampling on silks, 
It has begun: the breaking of glass, wood, copper, nickel, silver, foam 
Of gypsum, iron sheets, violin strings, trumpets, leaves, balls, crystals. 
Poof! Phosphorescent fire from yellow walls 
Engulfs animal and human hair. 


Bees build around the honeycomb of lungs, 
Ants build around white bone. 
Torn is paper, rubber, linen, leather, flax, 
Fiber, fabrics, cellulose, snakeskin, wire. 
The roof and the wall collapse in flame and heat seizes the foundations. 
Now there is only the earth, sandy, trodden down, 
With one leafless tree. 


Slowly, boring a tunnel, a guardian mole makes his way, 
With a small red lamp fastened to his forehead. 
He touches buried bodies, counts them, pushes on, 
He distinguishes human ashes by their luminous vapor, 
The ashes of each man by a different part of the spectrum. 
Bees build around a red trace. 
Ants build around the place left by my body. 


I am afraid, so afraid of the guardian mole. 
He has swollen eyelids, like a Patriarch 
Who has sat much in the light of candles 
Reading the great book of the species. 


What will I tell him, I, a Jew of the New Testament, 
My broken body will deliver me to his sight 
And he will count me among the helpers of death: 
The uncircumcised.(Why don't you ever write any child poetry?
  -A MOTHER.)

My right-hand neighbour hath a child,
  A pretty child of five or six,
Not more than other children wild,
  Nor fuller than the rest of tricks-
At five he rises, shine or rain,
And noisily plays 'fire' or 'train.'

Likewise a girl, _aetatis_ eight,
  He hath. Each morning, as a rule,
Proudly my neighbour will relate
  How bright Mathilda is at school.
My ardour, less than half of mild,
Bids me to comment, 'Wondrous child!'

All through the vernal afternoon
  My other neighbour's children skate
A wild Bacchantic rigadoon
  On rollers; nor does it abate
Till dark; and then his babies cry
What time I fain would versify.

Did I but set myself to sing
  A children's song, I'd stand revealed
A bard that did the infant thing
  As well as Riley or 'Gene Field.
I could write famous Children Stuff,
If they'd keep quiet long enough.‘NO, you can’t count me in, boys; I’m off it—
I’m jack of them practical jokes;
They give neither pleasure nor profit,
And the fellers that plays them are mokes.
I’ve got sense, though I once was a duffer,
And I fooled up my share, I allow,
But since conscience has made me to suffer—
She’s pegging away at me now.

You notice I’ve aged rather early,
And the wrinkles are deep on my face?
That’s sorrer—I’m sixty-nine, barely.
Jes’ camp, and I’ll tell you my case.
It was here on The Springs, we had hit it,
And we working the lead on this spot—
And we were, to my shame I admit it,
A rather unprincipled lot.

‘We were drunk all the day on the Sundays—
No wickeder habit exists;
And our exercise mostly on Mondays
Was feats of endurance with fists.
See, the wash wasn’t what we’d call wealthy—
Ten pennyweight stuff, thereabout—
And we took matters easy and healthy;
Now we’d rush for the same, I’ve no doubt.

‘Well, one morning, from over the border
Two Mongols moved inter the camp,
Which we voted a thing out of order—
The climate for Chows was too damp.
But it happened a couple of troopers
Arrived on The Springs that same week,
So the Chinks, in their opium stupors,
Didn’t wander down inter the creek,

‘Or get drowned in the dam at The Crescent,
As we reckoned might happen somehow;
But they settled down, easy and pleasant,
And there wasn’t the smell of a row.
Howsomever, we weren’t long twigging
The Chows were an ignerent pair,
And knew nothin’ at all about digging
And that was our chance to get square.

‘It was ’cording to Bastow’s directions,
Though I volunteered for the game,
To ensnare their Mongolian affections,
And lay them right on to a claim
Round the bend where we’d bottomed a duffer—
Myself and Pat Foley—right there,
Where the sinking is deep and is tougher
Than the hobs of Gehenna, I swear.

‘That shaft was a regular clinker,
Which it riles me to think of to-day.
Quite a fortnight it took us to sink her,
And then we came through on the clay,
Not the ghost of a handful of gravel.
Well, we dropped it without any fuss,
On the hill pegged the best we could snavel,
And the devil could prospect, for us.

‘But the Pagans were not a bit wiser,
And I counted it pretty fair game
To appear as their friend and adviser,
And induce them to take up that claim,
By a-cracking the lay and position
So’s to get them to sink on the clay,
Till they struck a hot shop in Perdition
Or tapped water in Europe some day.

‘But the heathens were mighty suspicious,
Wouldn’t have it I cared for their sakes—
Here, I state that all Chinkies are vicious
And I hate them like fever and snakes.
Then I tried a new system of dealing,
And offered advice at a fee,
And they caught on like winking. Fine feeling
Is wasted on any Chinee.

‘So they pegged out our cast-off, the duffer.
Their rights they had made out exact,
And Ah Kit, who was boss, wouldn’t suffer
Any little neglect of the Act:
And I put in their pegs to a fraction,
As grave as a brick on a hob,
Rigged up things to their full satisfaction,
And charged them five quid for the job.

Well, the heathens soon set their picks going,
And they seemed rather fond of the graft,
Though the boys had had trouble in stowing
A heap of dead things in the shaft,
And we chuckled and thought we had got ’em:
I knew I could tickle the pair
To keep sinking on inter the bottom
For gravel that never was there.

‘Next night a most harrowing rumour
Went round, and the camp was half daft:
It was said that a nugget—a boomer—
Had been found by the Chows in our shaft.
‘Point of fact, that the Pagans had struck it,
Had knocked down a sample of wash
That looked good for a pound to the bucket,
And our joke had gone hopelessly squash.

‘It was c’rect, boys, by all that is holy!
We’d struck a false bottom, no doubt,
And the fortune of self and of Foley
Was scooped by Ah Kit and Ah Gout.
We resolved that these Chinese were sapping
The wealth of the land, and agreed
On a project for catching them napping
When the troopers rode on to the lead.

Yes, we scrambled for claims all around ’em,
And we made the foam fly for a week,
But the Chows had the gilt edge. Confound ’em,
They’d lobbed right on top of the streak!
No, your joke, boys, I reckon is risky,
And somewhat ridic’lus, I think,
But I’m with you for friendship and whisky
If one of you orders the drink.’A poor—torn heart—a tattered heart—
That sat it down to rest—
Nor noticed that the Ebbing Day
Flowed silver to the West—
Nor noticed Night did soft descend—
Nor Constellation burn—
Intent upon the vision
Of latitudes unknown.

The angels—happening that way
This dusty heart espied—
Tenderly took it up from toil
There—sandals for the Barefoot—
There—gathered from the gales—
Do the blue havens by the hand
Lead the wandering Sails. 

Throughout past movements 
of my blunted feather pen, 
my mind has been 
controlled by frustration. 
Pages of depleted reams, litter 
the cold stone floor 
of this uninspiring shed. 

Those pins of medals, 
never make holes 
in my sweat soaked vest. 
No accolades are ever 
thrown my way


as I tried to see life 
as a knotted ball of string, 
make some sense 
of it’s untidiness 
and unravel 
some great victory 
in my naive soul. 

Now, my face 
as long 
as a vets glove, 
leaves me reading words 
that simply return 
to scratch and bite, 
not fitting, 
not rhyming, 


not right. 

MY eyelids red and heavy arc
With bending o'er the smold'ring peat.
I know the Aeneid now by heart,
My Virgil read in cold and heat,
In loneliness and hunger smart.
And I know Homer, too, I ween,
As Munster poets know Ossian.

And I must walk this road that winds
Twixt bog and bog, while east there lies
A city with its men and books;
With treasures open to the wise,
Heart-words from equals, comrade-looks;
Down here they have but tale and song,
They talk Repeal the whole night long.

'You teach Greek verbs and Latin nouns,'
The dreamer of Young Ireland said,
'You do not hear the muffled call,
The sword being forged, the far-off tread
Of hosts to meet as Gael and Gall
What good to us your wisdom-store,
Your Latin verse, your Grecian lore?'
And what to me is Gael or Gall?
Less than the Latin or the Greek
I teach these by the dim rush-light
In smoky cabins night and week.
But what avail my teaching slight?
Years hence, in rustic speech, a phrase,
As in wild earth a Grecian vase

There stood a Poplar, tall and straight; 
The fair, round Moon, uprisen late, 
Made the long shadow on the grass 
A ghostly bridge ’twixt heaven and me. 
But May, with slumbrous nights, must pass;
And blustering winds will strip the tree. 
And I’ve no magic to express 
The moment of that loveliness; 
So from these words you’ll never guess 
The stars and lilies I could see. 

Because my love is quick to come and go-
A little here, and then a little there-
What use are any words of mine to swear
My heart is stubborn, and my spirit slow
Of weathering the drip and drive of woe?
What is my oath, when you have but to bare
My little, easy loves; and I can dare
Only to shrug, and answer, "They are so"?

You do not know how heavy a heart it is
That hangs about my neck- a clumsy stone
Cut with a birth, a death, a bridal-day.
Each time I love, I find it still my own,
Who take it, now to that lad, now to this,
Seeking to give the wretched thing away. 

The little world span round and round, 
Singing along her sunny ways,
And all the glory she unwound
She gave to him for joy and praise.

And he, whom lavish morning met
With new-blown flowers and minstrelsy,
Looked on the gift through eyelids wet 
For sorrow of satiety. 

And he, whom noon put to the proof,
With trumpet-call and weapon blessed, 
Fought the brave fight with soul aloof 
Harkening for some remote behest.

Not homeward could the winged feet fare, 
The lyric laughter choked a sigh—
A wanderer from he knew not where, 
Dreamer of dreams, he knew not why. 

Thoughtful in youth, but not austere in age;
Calm, but not cold, and cheerful though a sage;
Too true to flatter and too kind to sneer,
And only just when seemingly severe;
So gently blending courtesy and art
That wisdoms lips seemed borrowing friendships heart.

Taught by the sorrows that his age had known
In others trials to forget his own,
As hour by hour his lengthened day declined,
A sweeter radiance lingered oer his mind. 
Cold were the lips that spoke his early praise,
And hushed the voices of his morning days,
Yet the same accents dwelt on every tongue,
And love renewing kept him ever young. 

Hair-braided chestnut,
coiled like a lyncher's rope,
Eyes-fagots,
Lips-old scars, or the first red blisters,
Breath-the last sweet scent of cane,
And her slim body, white as the ash
of black flesh after flame. 

Your hair and chin are like the hair
And chin Burne-Jones's ladies wear;
You were unfashionably fair
In '
And sad you were when girls are gay,
You read a book about Le vrai
Merite de l'homme, alone in May.
What CAN it be,
Le vrai merite de l'homme? Not gold,
Not titles that are bought and sold,
Not wit that flashes and is cold,
But Virtue merely!
Instructed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau
(And Jean-Jacques, surely, ought to know),
You bade the crowd of foplings go,
You glanced severely,
Dreaming beneath the spreading shade
Of 'that vast hat the Graces made;'
So Rouget sang--while yet he played
With courtly rhyme,
And hymned great Doisi's red perruque,
And Nice's eyes, and Zulme's look,
And dead canaries, ere he shook
The sultry time
With strains like thunder. Loud and low
Methinks I hear the murmur grow,
The tramp of men that come and go
With fire and sword.
They war against the quick and dead,
Their flying feet are dashed with red,
As theirs the vintaging that tread
O head unfashionably fair,
What end was thine, for all thy care?
We only see thee dreaming there:
We cannot see
The breaking of thy vision, when
The Rights of Man were lords of men,
When virtue won her own again
In ' 

Are you not weary of ardent ways, 
    Lure of the fallen seraphim? 
    Tell no more of enchanted days. 

    Your eyes have set man's heart ablaze 
    And you have had your will of him. 
    Are you not weary of ardent ways?

    Above the flame the smoke of praise
    Goes up from ocean rim to rim. 
    Tell no more of enchanted days.

    Our broken cries and mournful lays 
    Rise in one eucharistic hymn. 
    Are you not weary of ardent ways?

    While sacrificing hands upraise
    The chalice flowing to the brim,
    Tell no more of enchanted days. 

    And still you hold our longing gaze
    With languorous look and lavish limb!
    Are you not weary of ardent ways?
    Tell no more of enchanted days. 

In the silence of dark night
She shines like a star
Her smile like a moonbeam afar
With her charm to everyone's delight

L ovely lady
I ntelligent, having
S uperior and adoring
A esthetically pleasing pesonality

With such mona lisa like smile
From this charming woman splendidly gleams
Friendliness be carried in pillow of dreams
Beguiles one soul for worthwhile


(For Lisa Quevedo RN,  a friend)Children picking up our bones 
Will never know that these were once 
As quick as foxes on the hill; 

And that in autumn, when the grapes 
Made sharp air sharper by their smell 
These had a being, breathing frost; 

And least will guess that with our bones 
We left much more, left what still is 
The look of things, left what we felt 

At what we saw. The spring clouds blow 
Above the shuttered mansion house, 
Beyond our gate and the windy sky 

Cries out a literate despair. 
We knew for long the mansion's look 
And what we said of it became 

A part of what it is
Children, 
Still weaving budded aureoles, 
Will speak our speech and never know, 

Will say of the mansion that it seems 
As if he that lived there left behind 
A spirit storming in blank walls, 

A dirty house in a gutted world, 
A tatter of shadows peaked to white, 
Smeared with the gold of the opulent sun. 

You make it in your mess-tin by the brazier's rosy gleam;
    You watch it cloud, then settle amber clear;
You lift it with your bay'nit, and you sniff the fragrant steam;
    The very breath of it is ripe with cheer.
You're awful cold and dirty, and a-cursin' of your lot;
    You scoff the blushin' 'alf of it, so rich and rippin' 'ot;
It bucks you up like anythink, just seems to touch the spot:

Since I came out to fight in France, which ain't the other day,
    I think I've drunk enough to float a barge;
All kinds of fancy foreign dope, from caffy and doo lay,
    To rum they serves you out before a charge.
In back rooms of estaminays I've gurgled pints of cham;
    I've swilled down mugs of cider till I've felt a bloomin' dam;
But 'struth! they all ain't in it with the vintage of Assam:

I think them lazy lumps o' gods wot kips on asphodel
    Swigs nectar that's a flavour of Oolong;
I only wish them sons o' guns a-grillin' down in 'ell
    Could 'ave their daily ration of Suchong.
Hurrah! I'm off to battle, which is 'ell and 'eaven too;
    And if I don't give some poor bloke a sexton's job to do,
To-night, by Fritz's campfire, won't I 'ave a gorgeous brew
    (For fightin' mustn't interfere with Tea).
To-night we'll all be tellin' of the Boches that we slew,
    As we drink the giddy victory in Tea. 

Amidst the wearying deserts of frustration
May lie the sporadic oasis of joy, 
Life is a mix up of things
My friend, isn’t not a strange alloy? 

Dwelling upon it a little further
Tell me friend, is this not true -
Often it is the pungent ingredients
That adds flavor to the life’s frothy brew.

So let me embrace my present disappointments 
Those that now appear to me as pests
For at a future date, who knows? 
Perhaps they might be my cherished guests

Your perfume lingers on my clothes, 
like the image of your small determined face.

You watched me hug him – your husband of sixty odd years; 
His thin body craving the closeness; 
His eyes twinkling at the remembrance of woman's flesh; 
His hand squeezing mine with relish still.

'You know I can't give him that'
you say without bitterness
'I never could.'

Dear Jeanie, 
you visit him every day
and chat brightly
to his far-away eyes.
A pity his illness scares you so.
Your love was always of such a practical kind


When I am dying, let me know
That I loved the blowing snow
Although it stung like whips;
That I loved all lovely things
And I tried to take their stings
With gay unembittered lips;
That I loved with all my strength,
To my soul's full depth and length,
Careless if my heart must break,
That I sang as children sing
Fitting tunes to everything,
Loving life for its own sake. 

Why art thou so far from helping me, 
And from the words of my roaring? 
But thou hearest not; 
And in the night season, and am not silent.
But I am a worm, and no man; 
A reproach of men, 
And despised of the people.
All they that see me laugh me to scorn: 
They shoot out the lip, 
They shake the head, saying, 
Be not far from me: for trouble is near; 
For there is none to help.
Many bulls have compassed me: 
Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
They gaped upon me with their mouth, 
As a ravening and a roaring Lion
I am poured out like water, 
And all my bones are out of joint: 
My heart is like wax; 
It is melted in the midst of my bowels.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd; 
And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; 
And thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
Let me not  be ashamed, 
Let me not mine enemies triumph over me.
Teach me thy paths.
Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: 
On thee do I wait all the day.
Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; 
For I am desolate and afflicted.
The troubles of my heart are enlarged: 
O bring thou me out of my distresses.
Look upon my affliction and my pain; 
And forgive all my sins. 

My invocations are sincere and true,
They form my ablutions and prayers due.

One glance of guide such joy and warmth can
grant,
On marge of stream can bloom the tulip plant.

One has no comrade on Love's journey long
Save fervent zeal, and passion great and
strong.

You are my dwelling place and nesting
bough.

Your Love in my breast burns like Doomsday
morn,

pine,
You are the only quest and aim of mine.

Without You town appears devoid of life,
When present, same town appears astir with
strife.

For wine of gnosis I request and ask,
To get some dregs I break the cup and glass.

The mystics' gourds and commons' pitchers
wait
For liquor of your Grace and Bounty great.

Against Your godhead I have a genuine
plaint,
For You the Spaceless, while for me restraint.

Both verse and wisdom indicate the way
Which longing face to face can not convey.


*
The mystic's soul is like the morning breeze:
It freshens and renews life's inner meaning; 
An illumined soul can be a shepherd's, who
command.

Bless me
With heavenly bliss
I am your child
Wandering in wild
Guide me
Caress me
With you loving kiss
O my Father
I am clayey
Having no shape and form
It's my plea
Mould me
In the best possible form
With best of qualities
That can transform
A beast into man
And a man into human
that I live to love you ï½
every day of my life
and love myself too
just the way you do
for I am
a reincarnation of you

Your conscience in me
and images of you
in lifeï½s struggles
make an enigma
of me, resembling you

Youï½ve been with me
from time immortal. 
growing up with you, 
Iï½ve realized
how indomitable, 
reckless and divine
is the power within you! 

for seeking this
humble abode in meï½Who  am I really, I don't know
no matter how fancifully the world
attributes my being
to Adam's skin or the chimpanzee's kin.
the one I desire, He alone knows
for He has made me in his infinite wisdom
for all eyes His sign
and is sharing my eyes. 

Thy blessing we don't see
Give us happiness
For sharing with others
Impart some greatness
For helping weaker
Considering all as brothers
Give us some power
That we can help other
Become the leg for those
Who can't walk 
Become the voice and raise
Raise voice for those
Who can't talk
So that we can hold
Trembling hand of old
Shower on us, we plea
Thy blessings we don't see
I stumble as I fare along Earth's way; keep me from falling. 

Mine eyes are open but they cannot see for gloom of night: 
I can no more than lift my heart to thee for inward light. 

The wild and fiery passion of my youth consumes my soul; 
In agony I turn to thee for truth and self-control. 

For Passion and all the pleasures it can give will die the death; 
But this of me eternally must live, thy borrowed breath. 

'Mid the discordant noises of the day I hear thee calling; 
I stumble as I fare along Earth's way; keep me from falling. 

For if thou leave us on our own
We shall wander like a cow in the green field
This world is a labyrinth and a maze
And without Your guidance 
We may drift away 
From the right and chosen path for success
You hold the keys while
We search for the doors
You are Merciful
We are subservient 
You are our Master and
We are your servants
You know what and how to give
We don't know what and how to ask
You are bountiful 
We remain tightfisted
You invite us for success and rewards
We look for material gains and hoardings
You are the conqueror
We are the straggler 
Leave us not for this hard test
Help us to obey, follow and succeed

In this life and hereafter.. 

Aameen. 

Show me what's wrong from right
Keep me on Islam, for therein is my delight
Therein is my power and pride


Again!

Come, give, yield all your strength to me!
From far a low word breathes on the breaking brain
Its cruel calm, submission's misery,
Gentling her awe as to a soul predestined.
Cease, silent love! My doom! 

Blind me with your dark nearness, O have mercy, beloved enemy of my will!
I dare not withstand the cold touch that I dread.
Draw from me still
My slow life! Bend deeper on me, threatening head,
Proud by my downfall, remembering, pitying
Him who is, him who was! 

Again!
Together, folded by the night, they lay on earth. I hear
From far her low word breathe on my breaking brain.

Come! I yield. Bend deeper upon me! I am here.
Subduer, do not leave me! Only joy, only anguish,
Take me, save me, soothe me, O spare me


Give me the gift of laughter
for each day
laughter with hope
to greet the coming of each dawn
and faith that never dies

give me the gift of laughter
instead of sighs


How long I should just go away? 
How long just sit and nothing do? 
Sometimes I have to sleep and stay-
What should I do to find myself? 
What should I change but never lose? 
What should be my or lay on shelf? 
Is right the way today I chose? 
Please, give me chance to see the star
That will be shine in sleepy sky.
Please, give me love, the place you are
And stile of life that will be fine.
Please, send me trust and clever mind, 
The Angel who will safe my life.
And I believe the man I find
Who died one day due to the 'knife"-
I will love him because of light, 
I know his soul is quite dark.
He cries alone at darkly night
And every day feels like a shark.
I can to cover lonely heart.
He will love me and that`s enough
To find together our part-
Please help me write a useful thing, 
Please make my mind so helpful, free
And I`ll be happy then, I think-Often the western wind has sung to me,
There have been voices in the streams and meres,
And I heard not. Oh ! open Thou mine ears.

The reeds have whispered low as I passed by,
' Be strong, O friend, be strong, put off vain fears,
And I heard not. Oh ! open Thou mine ears.

There have been many stars to guide my feet,
Often the delicate moon, hearing my sighs,
Has rent the clouds and shown a silver street;
And I saw not. Oh ! open Thou mine eyes.

Angels have beckoned me unceasingly,
And walked with me ; and from the sombre skies
And I saw not. Oh ! open Thou mine eyes. 

A mother's love and tender care:
And Thou wilt hear, while for my own
Mother most dear I make this birthday prayer.

Protect her life, I pray,
Who gave the gift of life to me; 
And may she know, from day to day,
The deepening glow of Life that comes from Thee.

As once upon her breast
Fearless and well content I lay,
So let her heart, on Thee at rest,
Feel fears depart and troubles fade away.

Her every wish fulfill; 
And even if Thou must refuse
In anything, let Thy wise will
A comfort bring such as kind mothers use.

Ah, hold her by the hand,
As once her hand held mine; 
And though she may not understand
Life's winding way, lead her in peace divine.

I cannot pay my debt
For all the love that she has given; 
Her due reward,- bless her in earth and heaven. 


I praise and thank you
for the gift of life and love
the gift of wisdom and discernment
the gift of prayer

I praise and thank you
for the gift of friendship

In a very special way, 
i surrender to the throne of your grace
the concerns of my PH  friends
who shared their time and talents
to this humble servant of yours

the problems they have encountered in their daily lives
Complete physical healing, financial healing
Emotional, spiritual and healing of relationships

In their missions to establish your kingdom
Cover them with your most precious blood

I praise and thank you for in faith

Amen


STROPHE IV

Though Zeus plan all things right,
Yet is his heart's desire full hard to trace;
Nathless in every place
Brightly it gleameth, e'en in darkest night,
Fraught with black fate to man's speech-gifted race.

ANTISTROPHE IV

Steadfast, ne'er thrown in fight,
The deed in brow of Zeus to ripeness brought;
For wrapt in shadowy night,
Tangled, unscanned by mortal sight,
Extend the pathways of his secret thought.

STROPHE V

From towering hopes mortals he hurleth prone
To utter doom; but for their fall
No force arrayeth he; for all
That gods devise is without effort wrought.
A mindful Spirit aloft on holy throne
By inborn energy achieves his thought.

ANTISTROPHE V

But let him mortal insolence behold:--
How with proud contumacy rife,
Wantons the stem in lusty life
My marriage craving;--frenzy over-bold,
Spur ever-pricking, goads them on to fate,
By ruin taught their folly all too late.

STROPHE VI

Thus I complain, in piteous strain,
Grief-laden, tear-evoking, shrill;
Ah woe is me! woe! woe!
Dirge-like it sounds; mine own death-trill
I pour, yet breathing vital air.
Hear, hill-crowned Apia, hear my prayer!
Full well, O land,
My voice barbaric thou canst understand;
While oft with rendings I assail
My byssine vesture and Sidonian veil.

ANTISTROPHE VI

My nuptial right in Heaven's pure sight
Pollution were, death-laden, rude;
Ah woe is me! woe! woe!
Alas for sorrow's murky brood!
Where will this billow hurl me? Where?
Hear, hill-crowned Apia, hear my prayer;
Full well, O land,
My voice barbaric thou canst understand,
While oft with rendings I assail
My byssine vesture and Sidonian veil.

STROPHE VII

The oar indeed and home with sails
Flax-tissued, swelled with favoring gales,
Staunch to the wave, from spear-storm free,
Have to this shore escorted me,
Nor so far blame I destiny.
But may the all-seeing Father send
In fitting time propitious end;
So our dread Mother's mighty brood,
The lordly couch may 'scape, ah me,
Unwedded, unsubdued!

ANTISTROPHE VII

Meeting my will with will divine,
Daughter of Zeus, who here dost hold
Steadfast thy sacred shrine,--
Me, Artemis unstained, behold,
Do thou, who sovereign might dost wield,
Virgin thyself, a virgin shield;

So our dread Mother's mighty brood
The lordly couch may 'scape, ah me,
Unwedded, unsubdued

As children of the universe
Our destination earth, 
We ride upon the solar winds
Until the hour of birth
When scattered, weary travlers
Who've journeyed from afar
Begin their incarnation
On this cold and dying star; 

What used to be so beautiful, 
So vibrant green and blue
An oasis for the many
Has been wasted by the few, 
What purpose in this torture
Of the motherhood of man? 
What evil child will desecrate
His home because he can? 

We've overstayed our welcome
It's time for us to leave
And after our destruction
Will no man be left to grieve? 
Sweet children of the universe
With hearts so pure and free
Release this star from bondage
With love's celestial key! 

Return these souls to heaven
Wrap this earth in slumber deep, 
Awaken us with dreaming, 
Let your love inside  us creep
Then as buds upon the branches
Of Life's tree on some spring morn'
We shall blossom into beauty
And this earth shall be reborn. 

In green pastures let him lay
To still waters guide his way
Restoreth his soul, I pray

Lead him in the paths of right
Through the valley give him light
When he's afraid ease his fright
With Thy rod and staff lend might 

Prepare a table of spoil
Annointest his head with oil
Give to him a cup that's royal
Let goodness follow his toil

And Thy mercy cease never
May he dwell in Thy house forever

Heavenly Father, 

I call on you right now in a special way
It is through your power that i was created
Every breath I take, every morning i wake
And every moment of every hour
I live under your power

Father, i ask you now
To touch me with that same power
For if you created me from nothing
You can certainly recreate me

Fill me with the healing power of your spirit
Cast out anything that should not be in me
Mend what is broken
Root out any unproductive cells

Open any blocked arteries or veins
And rebuild any damaged areas
Remove all inflammation
And cleanse any infection

Let the warmth of your healing love
Pass through my body
To make new any unhealthy areas
So that my body will function
The way you created it to function

And father, restore me to full health
In mind and body
So that i may serve you
The rest of my life
Amen

A prayer shared to me by a nun.



ONCE more the storm is howling, and half hid
Under this cradle-hood and coverlid
My child sleeps on.  There is no obstacle
But Gregory's wood and one bare hill
Whereby the haystack- and roof-levelling wind.
Bred on the Atlantic, can be stayed;
And for an hour I have walked and prayed
Because of the great gloom that is in my mind.
I have walked and prayed for this young child an hour
And heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower,
And-under the arches of the bridge, and scream
In the elms above the flooded stream;
Imagining in excited reverie
That the future years had come,
Dancing to a frenzied drum,
Out of the murderous innocence of the sea.
May she be granted beauty and yet not
Beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught,
Or hers before a looking-glass, for such,
Being made beautiful overmuch,
Consider beauty a sufficient end,
Lose natural kindness and maybe
The heart-revealing intimacy
That chooses right, and never find a friend.
Helen being chosen found life flat and dull
And later had much trouble from a fool,
Being fatherless could have her way
Yet chose a bandy-legged smith for man.
It's certain that fine women eat
A crazy salad with their meat
Whereby the Horn of plenty is undone.
In courtesy I'd have her chiefly learned;
Hearts are not had as a gift but hearts are earned
By those that are not entirely beautiful;
Yet many, that have played the fool
For beauty's very self, has charm made wisc.
And many a poor man that has roved,
Loved and thought himself beloved,
From a glad kindness cannot take his eyes.
May she become a flourishing hidden tree
That all her thoughts may like the linnet be,
And have no business but dispensing round
Their magnanimities of sound,
Nor but in merriment begin a chase,
Nor but in merriment a quarrel.
O may she live like some green laurel
Rooted in one dear perpetual place.
My mind, because the minds that I have loved,
The sort of beauty that I have approved,
Prosper but little, has dried up of late,
Yet knows that to be choked with hate
May well be of all evil chances chief.
If there's no hatred in a mind
Assault and battery of the wind
Can never tear the linnet from the leaf.
An intellectual hatred is the worst,
So let her think opinions are accursed.
Have I not seen the loveliest woman born
Out of the mouth of plenty's horn,
Because of her opinionated mind
Barter that horn and every good
By quiet natures understood
For an old bellows full of angry wind?
Considering that, all hatred driven hence,
The soul recovers radical innocence
And learns at last that it is self-delighting,
Self-appeasing, self-affrighting,
And that its own sweet will is Heaven's will;
She can, though every face should scowl
And every windy quarter howl
Or every bellows burst, be happy Still.
And may her bridegroom bring her to a house
Where all's accustomed, ceremonious;
For arrogance and hatred are the wares
Peddled in the thoroughfares.
How but in custom and in ceremony
Are innocence and beauty born?
Ceremony's a name for the rich horn,
And custom for the spreading laurel tree. 

BID a strong ghost stand at the head
That my Michael may sleep sound,
Nor cry, nor turn in the bed
Till his morning meal come round;
And may departing twilight keep
All dread afar till morning's back.
That his mother may not lack
Her fill of sleep.
Bid the ghost have sword in fist:
Some there are, for I avow
Such devilish things exist,
Who have planned his murder, for they know
Of some most haughty deed or thought
That waits upon his future days,
And would through hatred of the bays
Bring that to nought.
Though You can fashion everything
From nothing every day, and teach
The morning stats to sing,
You have lacked articulate speech
To tell Your simplest want, and known,
Wailing upon a woman's knee,
All of that worst ignominy
Of flesh and bone;
And when through all the town there ran
The servants of Your enemy,
A woman and a man,
Unless the Holy Writings lie,
Hurried through the smooth and rough
And through the fertile and waste,
protecting, till the danger past,
With human love. 

In the mind alone;
He that sings a lasting song
Thinks in a marrow-bone;
From all that makes a wise old man
That can be praised of all;
O what am I that I should not seem
For the song's sake a fool?
I pray -- for word is out
And prayer comes round again --
That I may seem, though I die old,
A foolish, passionate man. 

A Prayer for Thanksgiving,For the feast you set before us.
The harvest has been fruitful, 
And you preserved us to enjoy it.

The year has been a challenge
for our oldest and our dearest, 
but baby Julia’s lately come
with her toothless smiles to cheer us.


Our wives and daughters have prepared
a great Thanks Giving feast.
The places set, the wines been poured.
I’ll gain five pounds at least
We give thanks that we’re together.
Far too often we are not.
With the children off in college
And work keeping us apart.


Inspire us with charity
Towards those who need help living
-Remind us of the best of us
one missing from this table
Who earned Your thanks by giving
all that she was able. 

You are our the Supreme, the Unique Artist
In the womb you breathe soul
We are alive, 
There we are formed how you form
Fed what you feed, guided how you guide; 

In the earth you show us the right path
But most of us take the wrong path
That origins chaos, crimes, guilts, sins
Makes us chaotic, criminal, guilty, sinners; 

Empower the flowers to teach us manners
To color us with fresh and pure hue
As we are pale with dirt, dust and in due, 

Empower the flowing rivers to teach us
How to flow a stream from the soul
As we are stagnant rivers about to die
With immeasurable crimes, guilts, sins 
We are so unmannered, shameless
That we harm our own face
We are too stupid to hasitate cheating self existence
We are too ignorant to understand own fault; 

Much of our technology, knowledge harming us
We are poorly failed
We need proper knowledge to save us
We are in disputes, in ruins, in loss
We are not judges
We are convicted, needed to be judged
Most of us are strayed needed to be on right path.



Muzahidul Reza
From the dreadful battlefield
To the common ways of men, 
Make them to forget the dread
Fields of dying and the dead! 


By the sights that they have seen: 
Guard their dreams from shell and sword; 
Lead them by the pastures green, 
That they wander all night long
In the fields where they were young. 


Grant no charnel horrors slip
'Twixt them and their child's soft face. 
Breast to breast and lip to lip, 
Let the lovers meet, embrace! 
Be they innocent of all
Memories that affright, appal. 


Let their ears love music still, 
And their eyes rejoice to see
Glory on the sea and hill, 
Beauty in the flower and tree. 
Drop a veil that none may raise 
Over dreadful nights and days. 


sacrifice for you what then

if life is so cheap

This much, O heaven—if I should brood or rave,   
 Pity me not; but let the world be fed,   
 Yea, in my madness if I strike me dead,   
Heed you the grass that grows upon my grave.   
 
If I dare snarl between this sun and sod, 
 Whimper and clamour, give me grace to own,   
 In sun and rain and fruit in season shown,   
 
 If I must travail in a night of wrath,   
Nor any curse of mine cut down a flower.   
 
Men say the sun was darkened: yet I had   
 Thought it beat brightly, even on—Calvary:   
 And He that hung upon the Torturing Tree     
Heard all the crickets singing, and was glad. 

Oh, give us pleasure in the flowers to-day; 
And give us not to think so far away 
As the uncertain harvest; keep us here 
All simply in the springing of the year. 

Oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white,
Like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night; 
And make us happy in the happy bees, 
The swarm dilating round the perfect trees. 

And make us happy in the darting bird 
That suddenly above the bees is heard,
The meteor that thrusts in with needle bill, 
And off a blossom in mid air stands still. 

For this is love and nothing else is love, 
To sanctify to what far ends He will,
But which it only needs that we fulfil. 

O THOU unknown, Almighty Cause
Of all my hope and fear!
In whose dread presence, ere an hour,
Perhaps I must appear!


If I have wander'd in those paths
Of life I ought to shun,
As something, loudly, in my breast,
Remonstrates I have done;


Thou know'st that Thou hast formed me
With passions wild and strong;
And list'ning to their witching voice
Has often led me wrong.


Where human weakness has come short,
Or frailty stept aside,
Do Thou, All-Good-for such Thou art—
In shades of darkness hide.


Where with intention I have err'd,
No other plea I have,
But, Thou art good; and Goodness still
Delighteth to forgive. 

A lover prayed to Eros in this wise:- 

Since my love loves not me, Eros! I pray 
That thou wilt take this torturing love away. 
But since she is so fair, still let mine eyes 
Unloving, joy in her, her beauty prize; 
Still let her clear voice ring as pure and gay 
To my calm heart as mating birds in May. 
The words went up the blue Thessalian skies. 

But ere they reached the high god's golden seat, 
The lover to retract his prayer was fain: 

Nay, let me keep the bitter with the sweet, 
Better than placid bliss is love's dear pain. 
My love I'll hold and cherish though it prove 
More blighting than the frowning brows of Jove. 

The war will change many things in art and life, and among them, it is to be hoped, many of our own ideas as to what is, and what is not, "intellectual
 


Thou, whose deep ways are in the sea, 
Whose footsteps are not known, 
To-night a world that turned from Thee 
Is waiting -- at Thy Throne. 

The towering Babels that we raised 
Where scoffing sophists brawl, 
The little Antichrists we praised -- 
The night is on them all. 

The fool hath said . . . The fool hath said . .. 
And we, who deemed him wise, 
We who believed that Thou wast dead, 
How should we seek Thine eyes? 

How should we seek to Thee for power 
Who scorned Thee yesterday? 
How should we kneel, in this dread hour? 

Grant us the single heart, once more, 
That mocks no sacred thing, 
The Sword of Truth our fathers wore 

Let darkness unto darkness tell 
Our deep unspoken prayer, 
For, while our souls in darkness dwell, 
We know that Thou art there. 

And on my heirs, if all remain unspoiled,
No table or chair or stool not simple enough
For shepherd lads in Galilee; and grant
That I myself for portions of the year
May handle nothing and set eyes on nothing
But what the great and passionate have used
Throughout so many varying centuries
We take it for the norm; yet should I dream
Sinbad the sailor's brought a painted chest,
Or image, from beyond the Loadstone Mountain,
That dream is a norm; and should some limb of the Devil
Destroy the view by cutting down an ash
That shades the road, or setting up a cottage
Planned in a government office, shorten his life,
Manacle his soul upon the Red Sea bottom. 

Are these your presences, my clan from Heaven? 
Are these your hands upon my wounded soul? 
Mine own, mine own, blood of my blood be with me, 
Fly by my path till you have made me whole

I come to You on bended knee, 
Giving praise, honor and glory, 
And whatever else pleases Thee.

Thank You, Heavenly Father for another day, 
It’s not about the kind of weather outside, 

Greetings also from fellow saints who trust and believe, 
Through faith & patience Your promises we will receive, 
Cheerfully spreading the Gospel with a consecrated kiss, 
Exodus  by blessings sickness is taken from our midst. 

It’s only fitting that I start the day, 
With an acknowledgment of spirit and grace, 
For surely salvation has come my way, 
Putting smile after smile on my face.

Making easier the sometimes stormy daily grind, 
Because it is stated throughout the Bible many times, 
Psalm  &   my time & desire are in Your hands, 
With sincere faith, belief and trust in the Son of Man, 

Your divine will is what I seek my Father, 
When my plans are not blessed by You, why bother? 
Woe be unto to me I would ask and receive, 
Something I could get and not really need.

Gifts of a certain nature that I know all so well, 
Tools to be used by Satan for a one way ticket to hell, 
A prize that is not a prize for what it really should be, 
My goal is to have the door open to Heaven gaining eternal life.

Well, my Heavenly Creator it’s time for my day to begin, 

O THOU Great Being! what Thou art,
Surpasses me to know;
Yet sure I am, that known to Thee
Are all Thy works below.


Thy creature here before Thee stands,
All wretched and distrest;
Yet sure those ills that wring my soul
Obey Thy high behest.


Sure, Thou, Almighty, canst not act
From cruelty or wrath!
O, free my weary eyes from tears,
Or close them fast in death!


But, if I must afflicted be,
To suit some wise design,
Then man my soul with firm resolves,
To bear and not repine!A precious—mouldering pleasure—'tis—
To meet an Antique Book—
In just the Dress his Century wore—
A privilege—I think—

His venerable Hand to take—
And warming in our own—
A passage back—or two—to make—
To Times when he—was young—

His quaint opinions—to inspect—

~ October I have emptied my heart into these pages
My pen has bled words in red
You can look straight into me 
I have painted me as I am 
Honest and truthful

I don't want to be a sham
Here have I laid bare my life
Fraught with aches, dotted with smiles
My longings and my heart aches
My expectations, my disappointments
My triumphs, my defeats
My search through every nook n' cranny for success
My plunge into the nadir of despair on defeat
My moments of escalating joy
My dark hours of crippling distress
Everything I wanted to be
Everything I failed to be
Please have a peek into it
Read this candid chronicle of my life
And tell me if my soul is black or white


Pretty is as pretty does, 
her mama used to tell her.
But what a pretty face did most
was to get her into trouble.

They looked at her with smiles all fangs; 
she only noticed the sky.
She never looked upon the men
who wished to taste her thigh.

One fine day she walked the streets, 
tho' not in the professional sense. 
A man approached with soft, warm eyes
to bestow a soulful glance.

.  

She thought he was a keeper, 
and he certainly seemed deeper
than all the creeps - oh jeepers! -
hard on course to grab and 'sleep' her. 

Yes, pretty is as pretty does
her wise mama used to say; 
but she wishes she'd been plainer
if it meant her man weren't gay! 



(I.

That fawn-skin-dappled hair of hers,
      And the blue eye
      Dear and dewy,
And that infantine fresh air of hers! 

	II.

To think men cannot take you, Sweet,
      And enfold you,
      Ay, and hold you,
And so keep you what they make you, Sweet! 

	III

You like us for a glance, you know- -
      For a word's sake
      Or a sword's sake,
All's the same, whate'er the chance, you know.

	IV.

And in turn we make you ours, we say- -
      You and youth too,
      Eyes and mouth too,
All the face composed of flowers, we say.

	V.

All's our own, to make the most of, Sweet- -
      Sing and say for,
      Watch and pray for,
Keep a secret or go boast of, Sweet! 

	VI.

But for loving, why, you would not, Sweet,
      Though we prayed you,
      Paid you, brayed you
in a mortar- -for you could not, Sweet! 

	VII.

So, we leave the sweet face fondly there:
      Be its beauty
      Its sole duty! 
Let all hope of grace beyond, lie there! 

	VIII.

And while the face lies quiet there,
      Who shall wonder
      That I ponder
A conclusion? I will try it there.

	IX.

As,- -why must one, for the love foregone,
      Scout mere liking? 
      Thunder-striking
Earth,- -the heaven, we looked above for, gone! 

	X.

Why, with beauty, needs there money be,
      Love with liking? 
      Crush the fly-king
In his gauze, because no honey-bee? 

	XI.

May not liking be so simple-sweet,
      If love grew there
      'Twould undo there
All that breaks the cheek to dimples sweet? 

	XII.

Is the creature too imperfect,
      Would you mend it
      And so end it? 
Since not all addition perfects aye! 

	XIII.

Or is it of its kind, perhaps,
      Just perfection- -
      Whence, rejection
Of a grace not to its mind, perhaps? 

	XIV.

Shall we burn up, tread that face at once
      Into tinder,
      And so hinder
Sparks from kindling all the place at once? 

	XV.

Or else kiss away one's soul on her? 
      Your love-fancies! 
      - -A sick man sees
Truer, when his hot eyes roll on her! 

	XVI.

Thus the craftsman thinks to grace the rose,- -
      Plucks a mould-flower
      For his gold flower,
Uses fine things that efface the rose:

	XVII.

Rosy rubies make its cup more rose,
      Precious metals
      Ape the petals,- -
Last, some old king locks it up, morose! 

	XVIII.

Then how grace a rose? I know a way! 
      Leave it, rather. 
      Must you gather? 
Smell, kiss, wear it- -at last, throw away

C telephones to D, who has a hand
On E’s knee, F coughs, G turns up the sod
For H’s grave, I do not understand
But J is bringing one clay pigeon down
While K brings down a nightstick on L’s head,
And M takes mustard, N drives to town,
O goes to bed with P, and Q drops dead, 
R lies to S, but happens to be heard
By T, who tells U not to fire V
For having to give W the word
That X is now deceiving Y with Z,
     Who happens, just now to remember A
      Peeling an apple somewhere far away. 

Romania is in mourning.
A princess of Romanian folk died
A few hours ago.
There will be many  trees on this land 
Without the  forest 
And  other cords of the guitars, 
And some kind of vibration, maybe  more pleasant, 
But  there will never be  another  Tatiana 
Impeccable Stepa, ineluctable  Stepa, irresistible Stepa.
Because she could  let her love 
Trickle into our  souls, 
Until all her songs  on the altar  of praise were  laid, 
Until today, when our  eyes  are glittered 
From the reflection of our  tears. 
Her extraordinary talent melted our hearts. 

And step by step, 
Ab initio  Stepa, ab ovo Stepa

She  sang  all her  songs to us, 
But she was the most  beautiful sound 
We have ever heard.
And she could make us  squeal with delight.
The more beautiful  we became just after hearing her songs.
And  if we learned to exist as part of Earth
When  only love could  keep us together, 
It was because
She lived to teach us how to live.

Pro tempore and  in esse
Tatiana Stepa died. 

Each star a rung, 
night comes down the spiral
staircase of the evening.
The breeze passes by so very close
as if someone just happened to speak of love.
In the courtyard, 
the trees are absorbed refugees
embroidering maps of return on the sky.
On the roof, 
the moon - lovingly, generously -
is turning the stars
into a dust of sheen.
From every corner, dark-green shadows, 
in ripples, come towards me.
At any moment they may break over me, 
like the waves of pain each time I remember
this separation from my lover.

This thought keeps consoling me: 
though tyrants may command that lamps be smashed
in rooms where lovers are destined to meet, 
they cannot snuff out the moon, so today, 
nor tomorrow, no tyranny will succeed, 
no poison of torture make me bitter, 
if just one evening in prison
can be so strangely sweet, 
if just one moment anywhere on this earth.A Prison gets to be a friend—
Between its Ponderous face
And Ours—a Kinsmanship express—
And in its narrow Eyes—

We come to look with gratitude
For the appointed Beam
It deal us—stated as our food—
And hungered for—the same—

We learn to know the Planks—
That answer to Our feet—
So miserable a sound—at first—
Nor ever now—so sweet—

As plashing in the Pools—
When Memory was a Boy—
But a Demurer Circuit—
A Geometric Joy—

The Posture of the Key
That interrupt the Day
To Our Endeavor—Not so real
The Check of Liberty—

As this Phantasm Steel—
Whose features—Day and Night—
Are present to us—as Our Own—
And as escapeless—quite—

The narrow Round—the Stint—
The slow exchange of Hope—
For something passiver—Content
Too steep for lookinp up—

The Liberty we knew
Avoided—like a Dream—
Too wide for any Night but Heaven—
If That—indeed—redeem—My tears stream down from my soul
When I become like a bird in the cage
Now, this steel cage is my place to live
Entombed within four walls of the prison
this is the man made hell for criminals
Now, I regret what I have done with  my life
Life in prison can not be explained
Everything to do with sinister punishment and retribution.
No one should not come here. 
So stay out there without commit any type of crime
Now, I am far from my home town
and no one here or there to listen my story either
When I think about my family, my heart is breaking into two 
I made my wife and children to suffer in their life
Who will feed my family and take care of them
I should have thought of all before I came here
So, has my peers and a judge and myself 
everyday sitting here wasting my life away. 

A Prisoner’s word
Life in jail sucks
I have hit bottom rock
If only I had known
How difficult it would be 
To cope in one of the toughest prison
I would have hesitated
And thought again

Thrown in Jail
Rejected bail
Sniffed out by the law as guilty
Had I known
I would have done things quite differently

Now a society system recorded failure
For an outstanding outrageous behaviour
Hustling for cigarettes
And bursting for drugs
An atlas of cells
With polluted smells

Two more years to pay
And I keep wondering
How did I end up this way? 
Words were perilously playing in my brain
When I held up that bank
Before then I was hardworking and frank
Until from my job I got sacked
With my football team I got axed
From my lover a jilt letter was faxed

I became depressed
Not very strong
But I was totally wrong
This is not where I belong
Unfortunately I am all holed up.

Sometimes I dream of a jail break
Minutes later I awake
And ponder on all that money I could have raked
That wealth I would have truly cherished
However my freedom I truly relish
Knowing I will be free one day
Brings me a glimmer of hope
This shimmers regularly down my thoughtful slope
Oh this prison sucks

This ploughman dead in battle slept out of doors
Many a frozen night, and merrily
Answered staid drinkers, good bedmen, and all bores:
"At Mrs Greenland's Hawthorn Bush," said he,
"I slept

" None knew which bush. Above the town,
Beyond `The Drover', a hundred spot the down
In Wiltshire. And where now at last he sleeps
More sound in France -that, too, he secret keeps. 

OVER the western sea, hither from Niphon come,
   Courteous, the swart-cheek'd two-sworded envoys,
   Leaning back in their open barouches, bare-headed, impassive,
   Ride to-day through Manhattan.

   Libertad!
   I do not know whether others behold what I behold,
   In the procession, along with the nobles of Asia, the errand-
         bearers,
   Bringing up the rear, hovering above, around, or in the ranks
         marching;
   But I will sing you a song of what I behold, Libertad.


   When million-footed Manhattan, unpent, descends to her pavements;  When the thunder-cracking guns arouse me with the proud roar I love;
   When the round-mouth'd guns, out of the smoke and smell I love, spit
         their salutes;
   When the fire-flashing guns have fully alerted me--when heaven-clouds
         canopy my city with a delicate thin haze;
   When, gorgeous, the countless straight stems, the forests at the
         wharves, thicken with colors;
   When every ship, richly drest, carries her flag at the peak;
   When pennants trail, and street-festoons hang from the windows;
   When Broadway is entirely given up to foot-passengers and foot-
         standers--when the mass is densest;
   When the façades of the houses are alive with people--when eyes gaze,
         riveted, tens of thousands at a time;
   When the guests from the islands advance--when the pageant moves
         forward, visible;
   When the summons is made--when the answer that waited thousands of
         years, answers;                                              I too, arising, answering, descend to the pavements, merge with the
         crowd, and gaze with them.


   Superb-faced Manhattan!
   Comrade Americanos!--to us, then, at last, the Orient comes.

   To us, my city,
   Where our tall-topt marble and iron beauties range on opposite
         sides--to walk in the space between,
   To-day our Antipodes comes.

   The Originatress comes,
   The nest of languages, the bequeather of poems, the race of eld,
   Florid with blood, pensive, rapt with musings, hot with passion,
   Sultry with perfume, with ample and flowing garments, With sunburnt visage, with intense soul and glittering eyes,
   The race of Brahma comes!


   See, my cantabile! these, and more, are flashing to us from the
         procession;
   As it moves, changing, a kaleidoscope divine it moves, changing,
         before us.

   For not the envoys, nor the tann'd Japanee from his island only;
   Lithe and silent, the Hindoo appears--the Asiatic continent itself
         appears--the Past, the dead,
   The murky night morning of wonder and fable, inscrutable,
   The envelop'd mysteries, the old and unknown hive-bees,
   The North--the sweltering South--eastern Assyria--the Hebrews--the
         Ancient of Ancients,
   Vast desolated cities--the gliding Present--all of these, and more,
         are in the pageant-procession.                               Geography, the world, is in it;
   The Great Sea, the brood of islands, Polynesia, the coast beyond;
   The coast you, henceforth, are facing--you Libertad! from your
         Western golden shores
   The countries there, with their populations--the millions en-masse,
         are curiously here;
   The swarming market places--the temples, with idols ranged along the
         sides, or at the end--bonze, brahmin, and lama;
   The mandarin, farmer, merchant, mechanic, and fisherman;
   The singing-girl and the dancing-girl--the ecstatic person--the
         secluded Emperors,
   Confucius himself--the great poets and heroes--the warriors, the
         castes, all,
   Trooping up, crowding from all directions--from the Altay mountains,
   From Thibet--from the four winding and far-flowing rivers of
         China,                                                       From the Southern peninsulas, and the demi-continental islands--from
         Malaysia;
   These, and whatever belongs to them, palpable, show forth to me, and
         are seiz'd by me,
   And I am seiz'd by them, and friendlily held by them,
   Till, as here, them all I chant, Libertad! for themselves and for
         you.


   For I too, raising my voice, join the ranks of this pageant;
   I am the chanter--I chant aloud over the pageant;
   I chant the world on my Western Sea;
   I chant, copious, the islands beyond, thick as stars in the sky;
   I chant the new empire, grander than any before--As in a vision it
         comes to me;
   I chant America, the Mistress--I chant a greater supremacy;        I chant, projected, a thousand blooming cities yet, in time, on those
         groups of sea-islands;
   I chant my sail-ships and steam-ships threading the archipelagoes;
   I chant my stars and stripes fluttering in the wind;
   I chant commerce opening, the sleep of ages having done its work--
         races, reborn, refresh'd;
   Lives, works, resumed--The object I know not--but the old, the
         Asiatic, renew'd, as it must be,
   Commencing from this day, surrounded by the world.


   And you, Libertad of the world!
   You shall sit in the middle, well-pois'd, thousands of years;
   As to-day, from one side, the nobles of Asia come to you;
         eldest son to you.                                           The sign is reversing, the orb is enclosed,
   The ring is circled, the journey is done;
   The box-lid is but perceptibly open'd--nevertheless the perfume pours
         copiously out of the whole box.


   Young Libertad!
   With the venerable Asia, the all-mother,
   Be considerate with her, now and ever, hot Libertad--for you are all;
   Bend your proud neck to the long-off mother, now sending messages
         over the archipelagoes to you;
   Bend your proud neck low for once, young Libertad.


   Were the children straying westward so long? so wide the tramping?
   Were the precedent dim ages debouching westward from Paradise so
         long?                                                        Were the centuries steadily footing it that way, all the while
         unknown, for you, for reasons?

   They are justified--they are accomplish'd--they shall now be turn'd
         the other way also, to travel toward you thence;
   They shall now also march obediently eastward, for your sake,
         Libertad. 

Let none resemble another; let each resemble the highest!
      How can that happen?  let each be all complete in itself. 

An inextensible heavy chain
Lies on a smooth horizontal plane,
An impulsive force is applied at A,
Required the initial motion of K.

Let ds be the infinitesimal link,
Of which for the present we’ve only to think;
Let T be the tension, and T + d


T
The same for the end that is nearest to B.
Let a be put, by a common convention,
For the angle at M ’twixt OX and the tension;
Let Vt and Vn be ds’s velocities,
Of which Vt along and Vn across it is;
Then Vn/Vt the tangent will equal,
Of the angle of starting worked out in the sequel.

In working the problem the first thing of course is
To equate the impressed and effectual forces.
K is tugged by two tensions, whose difference d


T
Must equal the element's mass into Vt.
Vn must be due to the force perpendicular
To ds’s direction, which shows the particular
Advantage of using da to serve at your
Pleasure to estimate ds’s curvature.
For Vn into mass of a unit of chain
Must equal the curvature into the strain.

Thus managing cause and effect to discriminate,
The student must fruitlessly try to eliminate,
And painfully learn, that in order to do it, he
Must find the Equation of Continuity.
The reason is this, that the tough little element,
Which the force of impulsion to beat to a jelly meant,
Was endowed with a property incomprehensible,
And was "given," in the language of Shop, "inexten-sible

"
It therefore with such pertinacity odd defied
The force which the length of the chain should have modified,
That its stubborn example may possibly yet recall
These overgrown rhymes to their prosody metrical.
The condition is got by resolving again,
According to axes assumed in the plane.
If then you reduce to the tangent and normal,
You will find the equation more neat tho’ less formal.
The condition thus found after these preparations,
When duly combined with the former equations,
Will give you another, in which differentials
(When the chain forms a circle), become in essentials
No harder than those that we easily solve
In the time a T totum would take to revolve.

Now joyfully leaving ds to itself, a-
Ttend to the values of T and of a.
The chain undergoes a distorting convulsion,
Produced first at A by the force of impulsion.
In magnitude R, in direction tangential,
Equating this R to the form exponential,
Obtained for the tension when a is zero,
It will measure the tug, such a tug as the "hero
Plume-waving" experienced, tied to the chariot.
But when dragged by the heels his grim head could not carry aught,
So give a its due at the end of the chain,
And the tension ought there to be zero again.
From these two conditions we get three equations,
Which serve to determine the proper relations
Between the first impulse and each coefficient
In the form for the tension, and this is sufficient
To work out the problem, and then, if you choose,
You may turn it and twist it the Dons to amuse. 

A process in the weather of the heart
Turns damp to dry; the golden shot
Storms in the freezing tomb.
A weather in the quarter of the veins
Turns night to day; blood in their suns
Lights up the living worm.

A process in the eye forwarns
The bones of blindness; and the womb
Drives in a death as life leaks out.

A darkness in the weather of the eye
Is half its light; the fathomed sea
Breaks on unangled land.
The seed that makes a forest of the loin
Forks half its fruit; and half drops down,
Slow in a sleeping wind.

A weather in the flesh and bone
Is damp and dry; the quick and dead
Move like two ghosts before the eye.

A process in the weather of the world
Turns ghost to ghost; each mothered child
Sits in their double shade.
A process blows the moon into the sun,
Pulls down the shabby curtains of the skin;
And the heart gives up its dead. 

The brown enormous odor he lived by
was too close, with its breathing and thick hair,
for him to judge. The floor was rotten; the sty
was plastered halfway up with glass-smooth dung.
Light-lashed, self-righteous, above moving snouts,
the pigs' eyes followed him, a cheerful stare--
even to the sow that always ate her young--
till, sickening, he leaned to scratch her head.
But sometimes mornings after drinking bouts
(he hid the pints behind the two-by-fours),
the sunrise glazed the barnyard mud with red
the burning puddles seemed to reassure.
And then he thought he almost might endure
his exile yet another year or more.

But evenings the first star came to warn.
The farmer whom he worked for came at dark
to shut the cows and horses in the barn
beneath their overhanging clouds of hay,
with pitchforks, faint forked lightnings, catching light,
safe and companionable as in the Ark.
The pigs stuck out their little feet and snored.
The lantern--like the sun, going away--
laid on the mud a pacing aureole.
Carrying a bucket along a slimy board,
he felt the bats' uncertain staggering flight,
his shuddering insights, beyond his control,
touching him. But it took him a long time
finally to make up his mind to go home. 

 And you forgot me, other loves to learn; 
Now through a wilderness of thorn and rue 

 And in forgetting does not ask to know 
Why I once left His arms for yours, at last 

While to the clarion blown by Marlowe's breath
Tall Tragedy tramped by in hues of death,
And Shakespeare yet was tuning string by string,
With English hawthorn crowned, in that glad spring
When bright clouds melted in a sky serene,
Romance moved lightly to the pipe of Greene.
As fresh as buds half-open, pure as dew,
Two damsels came in forefront of her crew,
One native to the hedgerows and the meads,
The keeper's lass, in simple country weeds,
Her firm white arms, as delicate as silk,
Below her smock-sleeve shining wet with milk;
No marvel the young noble learnt to woo
A maid so merry and frank and homely true.
The other with sad mien, though yet a bride,
Clad in man's raiment softly stole aside
And grieved that he who should have been her stay
Would privily have done her life away,
For still his crime with bloodshot eyeballs grim
And dripping fangs turned back and hunted him.
Cast off, contemned and hated, stabbed, discrowned,
Still in her heart wide realm for him she found,
When earth and love and joy seemed to his hand,
Gripped madly, a waning measure of slipping sand.
Though lust and murder made of him a slave,
Her love set free, her purity forgave.
Humbled and hopeless, all his sins confessed,
By miracle his contrite soul was blessed,
And heavy tolling of those haunted days
Was turned to golden peals of joyous praise.
Ah, but this woeful lady, lily-pale,
Is no mere vision drifting through a tale;
Betrays the rebel heart of Robert Greene. 

I have promised myself to keep my face
Towards the light, even if faint and pale
For it gives me, even if brief, a respite
From despair, grief—human plight-

Even when darkness and night descends
And I slowly crawl into my cold bed, 
I try to think of now extinct fire flies
Alive and glowing in my mind’s eye-

Oh, pain give up, I refuse to succumb
Or hug you tight to my heaving bosom
Or wear you like a shroud or veil
I’ll rise like the Sun, for sure without fail-Yours am I my lassie fair 
            Yours, my lovely dearie O; 
Every heartbeat I declare; 
            Every rovin’ fancy, O. 
Wind may blaw; sna’ may fa’; 
            Stars may fade an’ dee: 
My love for you outshines them a’, 
             If you’ll marry me. 

Chorus: 
Darling will you marry me 
         Will you say 'I do'? 
Darling will you marry me 
         You know I LOVE YOU. 

Night descends tae kiss the morn; 
      The Robin is wi’ song; 
Moments fade but I adorn 
        You a’ this Winter long. 
O lover’s tears; lover’s sighs 
      The ocean’s ebb an’ flow: 
Sun fa’s for the moon tae rise, 
        An’ roon the seasons go. 

Whatever troubles life unfolds 
       Whatever people say 
As constant as the Northern star 
        I’ll be your night and day: 
The Winter brings it’s biting cold; 
        The North Wind brings her storms 
I will bring a ring o’ gold 
          When summer winds come warm. 

The water’s rinnin saft an’ sweet; 
       Leaves are turnin’ gold; 
We’ll say our vows, hand in hand 
        With a Bible that we hold. 
And so it was, by Silver Luce; 
        Sae fair as fae a dream; 
Lo, oor marraige, was in truth 
        A Promise o’er a Stream

A PROMISE to California,
   Also to the great Pastoral Plains, and for Oregon:
   Sojourning east a while longer, soon I travel toward you, to remain,
         to teach robust American love;
   For I know very well that I and robust love belong among you, inland,
         and along the Western Sea;
   For These States tend inland, and toward the Western Sea--and I will
         also. 

to come everyday in the morning
and disburse all the rays 
to all the creatures
and go back to his home
by every dusk

The sun is performing his job
all along
he never cares for rain and thunder
every day he comes and 
complete his job
performing his job
million years passed
but he never asked

There's a girl I know 
that brings a smile to my heart 
reflecting a life that is 
a beautiful work of art 
Her captivating smile 
brightens my day 
making my inner-pain 
flutter far away 
The feeling that she leaves 
makes my heart believe 
that her love 
need not be achieved 
Yet, its given with 
an act of simplicity 
with no attachments 
or wanted publicity 
The friendship 
that she does bestow 
makes me comfortable 
like I'm now her bro 
If she only knew 
the impact she gives 
on each and every life 
that will forever live 
She transforms 
each broken heart 
making it feel special 
like its set apart 
The mere smile 
of this unique girl 
can brighten 
even the darkest of worlds 
When she walks into a room 
spirits begin to lift 
setting each and every 
mind adrift 
She makes people feel inclined 
to do something greater 
pushing them to strive for it now 
instead of later 
The feeling she does spread 
lifts every head 
and each pain and worry 
are now dead 
But left in its place 
is a new set pace 
to push onwards 
and finish the race 
Little does this girl know 
what she has done 
and the pride that she gives 
For she is 
and will always be 
something much greater 
then she will ever see


HIGH deeds, O Germans, are to come from you!
Thus in your books the record shall be found,
'A watchword was pronounced, a potent sound--
ARMINIUS!--all the people quaked like dew
Stirred by the breeze; they rose, a Nation, true,
True to herself--the mighty Germany,
She of the Danube and the Northern Sea,
She rose, and off at once the yoke she threw.
All power was given her in the dreadful trance;
Those new-born Kings she withered like a flame.' 
--Woe to them all! but heaviest woe and shame
To that Bavarian who could first advance
His banner in accursed league with France,
First open traitor to the German name!


'Tis the witching hour of night,
Orbed is the moon and bright,
And the stars they glisten, glisten,
Seeming with bright eyes to listen --
For what listen they?
For a song and for a charm,
See they glisten in alarm,
And the moon is waxing warm
To hear what I shall say.
Moon! keep wide thy golden ears --
Hearken, stars! and hearken, spheres! --
Hearken, thou eternal sky!
I sing an infant's lullaby,
A pretty lullaby.
Listen, listen, listen, listen, 
Glisten, glisten, glisten, glisten,
And hear my lullaby!
Though the rushes that will make
Its cradle still are in the lake -- 
Though the linen that will be
Its swathe, is on the cotton tree --
Though the woollen that will keep
It warm, is on the silly sheep --
Listen, starlight, listen, listen,
Glisten, glisten, glisten, glisten,
And hear my lullaby!
Child, I see thee! Child, I've found thee
Midst of the quiet all around thee!
And thy mother sweet is nigh thee!
But a Poet evermore!
See, see, the lyre, the lyre,
In a flame of fire,
Upon the little cradle's top
Flaring, flaring, flaring,
Past the eyesight's bearing,
Awake it from its sleep,
And see if it can keep
Its eyes upon the blaze --
Amaze, amaze!
It stares, it stares, it stares,
It dares what no one dares!
It lifts its little hand into the flame
Unharm'd, and on the strings
Paddles a little tune, and sings,
With dumb endeavour sweetly --
Bard art thou completely!
Little child
O' th' western wild,
Bard art thou completely!
Sweetly with dumb endeavour,
A Poet now or never,
Little child
O' th' western wild,
A Poet now or never

If you fancy that your people came of better stock than mine, 
If you hint of higher breeding by a word or by a sign, 
If you're proud because of fortune or the clever things you do -- 
Then I'll play no second fiddle:  I'm a prouder man than you! 
 
If you think that your profession has the more gentility, 
And that you are condescending to be seen along with me; 
If you notice that I'm shabby while your clothes are spruce and new -- 
You have only got to hint it:  I'm a prouder man than you! 
 
If you have a swell companion when you see me on the street, 
And you think that I'm too common for your toney friend to meet, 
So that I, in passing closely, fail to come within your view -- 
Then be blind to me for ever:  I'm a prouder man than you! 
 
If your character be blameless, if your outward past be clean, 
While 'tis known my antecedents are not what they should have been, 
Do not risk contamination, save your name whate'er you do -- 
`Birds o' feather fly together':  I'm a prouder bird than you! 
 
Keep your patronage for others!  Gold and station cannot hide 
Friendship that can laugh at fortune, friendship that can conquer pride! 
Offer this as to an equal -- let me see that you are true, 
And my wall of pride is shattered:  I am not so proud as you

The group was delightful.
We read poetry to each other

Over months, the dinner talks 
pushed up against the reading time.
Some of it was highly personal 
and the discussions stretched out
and the poetry time suffered 
even as the emotion intensified.

Finally, only a few poems were read
as a formality before the invasive species
of personal triumphs and tragedies
took their place on the throne. 
Our meetings became therapy sessions.

One time, someone mentioned 
a spectacular investment they had made.
Everyone was full of wonder
like amateur astronomers.
The next dinner there was more 
investment talk, especially real estate.

Finally, there was not much time 
for any serious therapy and our dinners
took on the intensity of bank heist planning.

One evening, someone showed up 
with what they said was an Italian proverb: 
"All things start out as poetry and end up as real estate."
We all laughed knowingly, 
and someone began to recite a poem
until they were shouted down. 

A FRI
 stands at the door; 
In either tight-closed hand 
Hiding rich gifts, three hundred and three score: 
Waiting to strew them daily o'er the land 
Even as seed the sower.It cannot be made fruitful till it die. 

O good New Year, we clasp 
This warm shut hand of thine, 
Loosing forever, with half sigh, half gasp, 
That which from ours falls like dead fingers' twine: 
Ay, whether fierce its grasp 
Has been, or gentle, having been, we know 
That it was blessed: let the Old Year go. 

O New Year, teach us faith! 
The road of life is hard: 
When our feet bleed and scourging winds us scathe, 
Point thou to Him whose visage was more marred 
Than any man's: who saith 
'Make straight paths for your feet'--and to the opprest-- 
'Come ye to Me, and I will give you rest.' 

Yet hang some lamp-like hope 
Above this unknown way, 
Kind year, to give our spirits freer scope 
And our hands strength to work while it is day. 
But if that way must slope 
Tombward, O bring before our fading eyes 
The lamp of life, the Hope that never dies. 

Comfort our souls with love,-- 
Love of all human kind; 
Love special, close--in which like sheltered dove 
Each weary heart its own safe nest may find; 
And love that turns above 
Adoringly; contented to resign 
All loves, if need be, for the Love Divine. 

Friend, come thou like a friend, 
And whether bright thy face, 
Or dim with clouds we cannot comprehend,-- 
We'll hold out patient hands, each in his place, 
And trust thee to the end. 
Knowing thou leadest onwards to those spheres 
Where there are neither days nor months nor years. 

Tell me not, in doctored numbers, 
Life is but a name for work! 
For the labour that encumbers 
Me I wish that I could shirk.

Life is phony! Life is rotten! 
And the wealthy have no soul; 
Why should you be picking cotton, 
Why should I be mining coal?

Not employment and not sorrow 
Is my destined end or way; 
But to act that each tomorrow 
Finds me idler than today.

Work is long, and plutes are lunching; 
Money is the thing I crave; 
But my heart continues punching 
Funeral time-clocks to the grave.

In the world's uneven battle, 
In the swindle known as life, 
Be not like the stockyard's cattle-- 
Stick your partner with the knife!

Trust no boss, however pleasant! 
Capital is but a curse! 
Strike,--strike in the living present! 
Fill, oh fill the bulging purse.!

Lives of strikers all remind us 
We can make our lives a crime, 
And, departing, leave behind us 
Bills for double overtime.

Charges that, perhaps another, 
Working for a stingy ten 
Bucks a day, some mining brother 
Seeing, shall walk out again.

Let us, then, be up and striking, 
Discontent with all of it; 
Still undoing, still disliking, 
Learn to labour--and to quit. 

Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
Life is but an empty dream! 
For the soul is dead that slumbers,
And things are not what they seem.

Life is real! Life is earnest! 
And the grave is not its goal; 
Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
Was not spoken of the soul.

Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,
Is our destined end or way; 
But to act, that each to-morrow
Find us farther than to-day.

Art is long, and Time is fleeting,
And our hearts, though stout and brave,
Still, like muffled drums, are beating
Funeral marches to the grave.

In the world’s broad field of battle,
In the bivouac of Life,
Be not like dumb, driven cattle! 
Be a hero in the strife! 

Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant! 
Let the dead Past bury its dead! 
Act,— act in the living Present! 

Lives of great men all remind us
We can make our lives sublime,
And, departing, leave behind us
Footprints on the sands of time; 

Footprints, that perhaps another,
Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
Seeing, shall take heart again.

Let us, then, be up and doing,
With a heart for any fate; 
Still achieving, still pursuing,
Learn to labor and to wait.

Inhumane lisper talented.
Hell! I am a superintendent
Inane, up hell's terminated
Headier, small, unpenitent.

Shut inane, an ill tempered
Leaden lush, I'm a pertinent
Humane perils in talented
Ill-natured, shape eminent

Inhumane let and reptiles
Help! I'm a sunnier talented
Inhumane talented perils
Neat hills, I am unrepented


Humane and silent reptile
Handle in sleepier mutant
Underneath ailments pile
An idle, supereminent halt

I'm a lethal, unrepented sin
Up ill mannered ‘n' hesitate
Lamented pleasure in thin
idle snarl-up, heat eminent

Serene handle, up militant
Up eminent idea enthralls
I am the nude sin repellant
Lupine time Neanderthals.


Inane semen, putrid, lethal
Humane, planted, resilient, 
Puerile hand, sentimental
Mushier and penile talent

Pluralist heed, an eminent
I 'm a stunner, idle elephant
Inane sell, I am the prudent
Serene handle, up militant

A pulse in the eternal mind
Help uninterested animal! 
Insane elephant, true, mild
Unite simple Neanderthal.


In neat prudish elemental
Annihilated supreme lent
Pinhead, rule sentimental
Dishearten lupine lament

Near human, idle, pestilent
Lepers headline in mutant
Ill hate and supereminent
Remained insult elephant

The poem is the anagram of the title


I'm sitting in a field now, 

Attached to a vine.

Everything's going well.

It's working out just fine.

 

I'm big, fat, and orange.

Before winter I will die, 

But I'll leave behind lots of seeds

When I become a pumpkin pie. 

A cluster of pent-up energy, 
Chugging guitar riffs, 
Hardcore pounding drums, 
Deep basslines, and
Rough vocals suffocates me.

A volatile atmosphere compels
Me to headbang to the rhythm, 
As if the music has possessed
My very soul.

All of my rationale is clouded
By a barbaric instinct to groove
In a violent manner.

I am a willing slave, 
A free captive, 
Forfeiting my spirit
To the animalistic majesty
Of the music. 

As the snowdropp sea of glistening white
Envelopes and amazes me, I, standing
Here in a woodland clearing think of mighty
Love.  This waving scene of purity hangs
It's every head of gleam shyly downward
In a modest pose, but lift each face and
Look at love so pure it takes us forward
In accepting states of grace that random
Created. They glow with light, and scented
Subtly, are as fresh as dawn. Just above
This ocean of delight hangs, relentless, 
January sky which now threatens rain.
Pure love is snowdropp white and gives itself.
I must away but I will come again
To find a presence here which can be felt. 

A memory lingers on familiar lanes
An ache awakens on old pathways
A hue unique in the buds
A flower aloof in a vase
A melody in foliage drenched
A vine entwined around a column
A dawn lights up from its source
An eventide suspends time and space
A captive moon in the pane
A night so deep and intense
A desolate spirit, holes in its being
A hand on a dagger rests
An assault on the earth made
A mantle green on barren field
A garland of arms, touch of rose
A banyan of centuries decayed
A purgatory of foggy dreams
An era of waking sleep
It's a legend of a life time
Despair and grief in joy abides! 




be most gracious, thy thorn
prick'd my heart, in throe
whilst in praise, I arose.

Purpled, weathered I may be
but your beauty shines in thee
restless, I claim my prize
for a heart seized, unrealised. 

Oh! My purest heart a rose
be most gracious, thy thorn
prick'd my heart, in throe
whilst in praise, I arose.

Purpled, weathered I may be
but your beauty shines in thee
restless, I claim my prize
for a heart seized, unrealised. 

Oh, my Prince, how the young women are drawn
to you! They flirt with all their charms
and wiles to attract your attention. Each one
wants to be in the center of your gaze, blotting
out all the others. But, alas, you are dazzled
by them all.  You hold court in the Great Hall, 
with singers and musicians gilding the hours.
Dancers bring the harmony of the heavens to earth.
And all of the young women - dancers, singers, servers, 
nurses - all of them sigh and yearn to be one with you.
Their faces are flushed with such expectant beauty.

But you can't choose one and dismiss all the others. 
You summon me, and confess with a pleased smile: 
'Is this not like Spring, the season of flowers? 
 Who would pick just one flower? '
Prince, don't you see, your love for all of them
is cruelty to each of them? Let one receive 
your favor. Release the others to other loves. 

You are far away from me
In a distance, alive
Where I can't reach and search of you.
The face of you, I don't know-
The path too in which you pass through
And the smile and your eyes.
Only I know this much, 
That is your name, only I know, 
And it's I concealed here in my words.
You can make a thousand names from these words.
And if you  recite some names
Perhaps I'll say 'YES' or 'NO'.  
Where are you 'oh my Love.
My soul is burning inside me.
And only If your name has ignited this much feelings in my heart.
I'll be becoming an ember when you meet me.  
If you find me one day before I become into ashes
I'll say. . 

what? 
You'll hate me if I say 'I MISSED YOU'.
Hey, are you smiling ''Oh my Love''. 

Married years
Fred and Daisy still
are very different people. 

All day long they hide 
their differences to make 
their marriage last

but every night after supper 
they let them out silently.  
Fred in his recliner works 

a crossword puzzle while 
Daisy in the dining room  
works a jigsaw puzzle

but neither Fred nor Daisy 
speaks a word until one has
finished and howls so loud 

nervous neighbors knock
to ask if something's wrong.  
Are you folks okay, they ask.

Fred says it's those coyotes
howling in the woods again.
He says Daisy feeds them. 

a quark's quest to quell
quasi quixotic qualms
in a quantum quandry
quietly quickens
the quintessential quagmire
of life at its quaintest. 

A QUARTER OF AN INCH AT A TIME

She moved near me in college, to the house across from mine. 
I knew at once this special girl was something rare and fine. 
We slowly started strolling down a path of love sublime: 
A quarter of an inch at a time
A quarter of an inch at a time

Through kids, careers, through fights and fears, we formed a wedded pair, 
That knew each other deeply as we learned to give and share, 
Ever stronger, growing closer, like two trees entwine: 
A quarter of an inch at a time 
A quarter of an inch at a time

Then came a bandit in the night, to rob me of my bride, 
To slowly steal away her brain and personhood inside, 
To make her serve a lengthy sentence, punishing no crime: 
A quarter of an inch at a time
A quarter of an inch at a time

I watch a shade be slowly drawn to darken out her will. 
I see her memory erode, from mountain down to hill.
I hear my singer drift off key, my poet stray off rhyme: 
A quarter of an inch at a time
A quarter of an inch at a time

This dearest soul I've ever met, so caring, sweet and kind, 
So lovely on the outside with as lovely heart and mind, 
Now works to hold the fabric of her self as it unwinds: 
A quarter of an inch at a time
A quarter of an inch at a time

As man and wife we've walked through life, down all its winding roads, 
Up craggy peak, ‘cross desert bleak, we've borne each other's loads.
There's just this final mountain now, together we will climb: 
A quarter of an inch at a time
A quarter of an inch at a time


A quatrain fills a little space,
  Although it's pretty small,
And oftentimes, as in this case,
  It has no point at all. 

On the back lawn of a home 
for the mentally unstable, 
she sits threading daisies.  

a chain of events 
had led her to this. 

Soon she would wear 
her white garland, 
and ask Matron.  

if indeed she looked 

we are lovers 
Of words
shaping nature
into our names

With wings 
to soar 
the sky's
farthest corner; 
descend the deepest sea, 
perceive the beauty 
of darkness

And the night sky 
may light up
and burn our wings

But we've tried. 
unidled and unbored

we have witnessed
the true color 
of the rainbow


A voice said, Look me in the stars
And tell me truly, men of earth,
If all the soul-and-body scars
Were not too much to pay for birth. 

I.

SOUL, spirit, genius--which thou art--that whence 
I know not, rose upon this mortal frame 
Like the sun o'er the mountains, all aflame, 
Seen large through mists of childish innocence, 
And year by year with me uptravelling thence, 
As hour by hour the day-star, madest aspire 
My nature, interpenetrate with fire 
It felt but understood not--strong, intense, 
Wisdom with folly mixed, and gold with clay;-- 
Soul, thou hast journeyed with me all this way. 
Oft hidden and o'erclouded, oft arrayed 
In scorching splendors that my earth-life burned, 
Yet ever unto thee my true life turned, 
For, dim, or clear, 't was thou my daylight made. 

II.

And sometimes seeming no more part of me-- 
This me, worms' heritage--than that sun can be 
Part of the earth he has with warmth imbued,-- 
Whence camest thou? whither goest thou? I, subdued 
With awe of mine own being--thus sit still, 
Dumb, on the summit of this lonely hill, 
Whose dry November-grasses dew-bestrewed 
Mirror a million suns--That sun, so bright, 
Passes, as thou must pass, Soul, into night: 
Art thou afraid, who solitary hast trod 
A path I know not, from a source to a bourne, 
Both which I know not? fear'st thou to return 

Whene’er I feed the barnyard folk
My gentle soul is vexed;
My sensibilities are torn
And I am sore perplexed.

The rooster so politely stands
While waiting for his food,
But when I feed him, what a change!
He then is rough and rude.

He crowds his gentle wives aside
Or pecks them on the head;
Sometimes I think it would be best
If he were never fed.

And so I often stand for hours
Deciding which is right—
To impolitely have enough,
Or starve and be polite. 

What is it men in women do require?
The lineaments of Gratified Desire.
What is it women do in men require?
The lineaments of Gratified Desire. 

Dylann Roof defended himself
in the sentencing phase of his trial
after he was convicted of killing 

nine people during a Bible study, 
the nine people who welcomed him 
after he walked into their church.

Had I been the judge I would have 
asked Mr. Roof to approach the bench
for a private consultation and I'd have 

said the court knows you're sane
because you were certified to stand trial
and you have said insanity is not 

the reason you killed these people.
You said it had to be done and you did it. 
Mr. Roof, are you possessed

An obese young woman, dressed
as the thin girl she wants to be

leaves me wondering
about the fit
of my own
identity. 

Coming home to myself
a state of being.
A father & daughter never known
each other
As the days of happenings transfer.
A secret of the past.

But he who calla the shots of
life & death.
 
Not a mystery to be
seeing in heart.

Pt.later. 

Is that the time? 
Has it passed by
so suddenly
without reason or with rhyme? 
Has hair transformed
from black to white, 
and life flown by
like day in flight? 

for conflict and for death? 
Forgive the constant murders, 
the constant theft of breath? 

Whose rights are wrongs
and wrongs are rights, 
turning night to day, 
then day to night? 

When the desolate eyes 
of war are shut, 
and the injured earth
appears as dust, 
will mixed opinion still remain
and fight for all the others gain? 



Life shall testify
Whether one’s death
Shall be a mere
Dust or a speck.
And death shall testify
Whether one’s breath
Was wholly spent
Upon  this earth.
When life can justify
One’s death
And death can justify
One’s breath
Only then can we say
To have travelled 
Across the shores 
Of the earth

When evil strikes 
In fire and flood
Or untimely death by dread disease

The ancient Greeks
Long before us
On this very same question reflected.
Wise Epicurus put it thus: 

Such evil to prevent, 
He cannot be omnipotent."

"And if He’s able but not willing
Such evil to prevent, 
He is malevolent."

All evil to prevent, 
Why in the world should pain and death
Some pray to atone for those bad things they’ve messed with
Praying with reverence and piety

My feelings and thoughts, as I introspect
Prompt me to question, with no disrespect
All religionists for their point of view

butter wouldn't melt. 

Eyes, soft grey blue and perfectly set
Lashes to die for
and such a clever mimic
He taped the Karate Kid
and played it so many times
he could recite every line by heart
He was only eight, too.

then one morning

I knew it had gone 
- the fifty dollar note 
It was definitely in my purse last night
I remember checking
and I knew who'd taken it

What to do. 

Confront and condemn? 
(and guarantee more lies)   
Confront with understanding? 
(he's a good little actor)   
Pretend I haven't noticed? 
(and let him get away with it)   
No way! 

that night after story

Sweetheart, I've been thinking. 
What? 
Well, some kids bring money to school, don't they? 
Dunno. 
To buy lunches and stuff.
no answer
I guess sometimes you wish you had some? 
Maybe. 
To buy stuff yourself, I mean. 
S'pose so. 
Would this help? 
I handed him ten dollars
he blushed
Thanks mum

When I checked my purse
next morning
the fifty dollar note
was back

Is it worth bringing a child into the world, mother? 
Terror has taken over our lives, lamented my daughter-
Her question haunted me, and I pondered a while.
Life is so precious, yet so ephemeral and fragile.

Are you going to just watch and give in to despair? 
Or face with hope, courage, grit and prayer.
All is not lost, though we still  in darkness grope, 
Didn’t you see the euphoria over the coronation of hope? 

As history is rewritten in the U. 

S elections, 
The world watches with disbelief and fascination.
People of all faiths have joined the celebrations
So dear, don’t fret and take part in the jubilations.

World is willing to look beyond narrow concerns, 
Lessons from history are slowly being learned.
One’s who had been for long marginalised, 
Will not endure disdain, is finally realised.

You can’t deny, road is paved with trials and strife-
The truth in all honesty my dear, that’s called life-
Let’s start with ourselves and be the change we want, 
And not just ruminate and wait for a magic wand.

To heal ourselves and all those out there, 
Charity begins at home but does not end there.
So don’t deny yourself joys of motherhood, 
Give her time, love, and values from early childhood.

Despite colour and creed, seeds of the same pod.
Give her roots, wings and dare to have her own dreams, 
See how she blossoms like a lotus with self esteem-

Destiny of man is in the hands of coming generations.
We can live in harmony with love and compassion.
Inner light is slowly and surely beginning to shine, 
People are not watching with apathy from side lines.

Discouraged of man, ' wrote Tagore. let's not forget.
what can I add to it to convince you, my dear daughter, 
Perhaps you have a point; my little girl needs a sibling, mother. 

November falls mildly this year, and smiles
On afternoon strolls, beckoning boldly
Through grey clouding skies, as mile upon mile
Surrounds us, in stylish profusion, yet bringing
More mellowed finery cocooned under
Ageing, untidy greens. Fashioned now in
Patches of yellowy gorse, which blunders
Pushily through hedgerows of sun-weary
Browns, with praiseworthy splashes of brighter
Than buttercup flowers, they lighten dreary
Old blackberry bushes, now ready for striking
Their own winter pose. Buzzard flies low, scans
Lacy trees, ready naked for Autumn's planned
Passionless sleep. It seems lust for growing
Must be on hold. Miniscule diamonds float
Mistily down, quickly wetting the ground, 
So, taking our cue, we leave without sound. 

The beauty of gray
I never noticed until
the other day I saw

this mockingbird, 
a quiet beauty in gray, 
on the bare limb

of a dogwood tree, 
peer down through snow
and scold below 

a Maine Coon cat, 
a jungle of fur in gray, 
sitting and staring at 

a feast that will never be, 
the two of them a watercolor
in the quiet beauty of gray. 

Face turning pale, her breath failed with a start.
Being half-loved had dissembled her heart.

Quietly subdued, yet inwardly weeping
Over news, that  'tho discreetly taken, 
Was shockingly hard..  Scars she'd been keeping
Warily disguised, she yet quite shaken, 
Disclosed to her soul. Alone now, wholey  
Inept at accepting this mind-blowing
Note. 

She would miss him so much,  this going 
She knew would leave holes that she couldn't show.

Admitting her treasure could always erode, 
And future dreams be dissolved, now events
Uncover routine as unseemly. Exploding
With disbelief, grieving, she later repents.
Knowing her life as already ordered
By sometimes tortured assent, she borders
Now on disquieting alarm, this scheming
To please the unpleaseable leaches her.

Drop by wearying  drop, her heart leaning
Towards dulling acceptance, now subsides
Into half-life again. Hopes once believed
Are left hanging by threads spread so finely.
She hardly now measures a truth from a lie.
Knowing well how to disguise, she just sighs.

Perpetually restless, 
The eyes cannot see
Or appreciate any
Beauty, properly.

So with the mind's pace.
The eye of the soul needs
To rise up in tranquility, 
To look past ruffles and lace.

Into beauty's soul, 
Taste its nectar
And inhale its fragrance, 
Then be caressed by
A rainbow of calm. 

I wish he had never come out
from behind the stove, that spider 
I stepped on at a. 

m.

He was a big one 
bothering no one.
He didn't see my foot 

that hour of the morning.
Reminds me of Mrs. Grimm, 
the widow next door.

She took her garbage out
at midnight Sunday.
They found her cold

in the driveway at dawn, 
a bullet in her forehead.
Her children swear 

she had no enemies.
Survivors of the spider  
say the same 

about their early riser.
Everyone knows that ours
is a quiet neighborhood. 

I search a quiet place, 
For reverent solitude, 
One where I can fix, 
My strained attitude.

I’m not in the mood, 
To think or speak, 
I feel kind of tired, 
I feel kind of weak.

My brain won’t absorb, 
The things you have to say, 
I need a quiet place, 
So I can find my way.

Back to this place, 
Where I can hear your tune, 
I’ll take a short detour, 
But I’ll be back soon. 

When music is far enough away
the eyelid does not often move

and objects are still as lavender
without breath or distant rejoinder.

The cloud is then so subtly dragged
away by the silver flying machine

that the thought of it alone echoes
unbelievably; the sound of the motor falls

like a coin toward the ocean's floor
and the eye does not flicker

as it does when in the loud sun a coin
rises and nicks the near air. Now,

slowly, the heart breathes to music
while the coins lie in wet yellow sand. 

Water comes with the dawn
Finding my dryness yearning
Welcome clouds gather
Blanketing the cruel sun.
Better than night, this soft gloom
Tempers edges, soothes pain.

Under its pall the word forlorn
Loses its fierce burning
Under its grey, the weather 
Of the soul resolves in a dun
Nothingness, a quiet wide room, 
A misty, dull and peaceful lane
To rest in till love comes again. 

The difficulty to think at the end of day, 
When the shapeless shadow covers the sun 
And nothing is left except light on your fur— 


There was the cat slopping its milk all day, 
Fat cat, red tongue, green mind, white milk 
And August the most peaceful month. 

To be, in the grass, in the peacefullest time, 
Without that monument of cat, 
The cat forgotten in the moon; 

And to feel that the light is a rabbit-light, 
In which everything is meant for you 
And nothing need be explained; 

Then there is nothing to think of. It comes of itself; 
And east rushes west and west rushes down, 
No matter. The grass is full 

And full of yourself. The trees around are for you, 
The whole of the wideness of night is for you, 
A self that touches all edges, 

You become a self that fills the four corners of night. 
The red cat hides away in the fur-light 
And there you are humped high, humped up, 

You are humped higher and higher, black as stone— 
You sit with your head like a carving in space 
And the little green cat is a bug in the grass. 

A  worthy poem is a race vehicle 
eminent grace glistening.
Like samurai 'n damascean sword
shining, tears  the centuries 
while lovers of excellence
stare it through the eons running
beautous and illoustrious, 
beaming at this majestic parade, 
enjoy it and  enchanted applaud. 

The two religions differ
in a number of ways 
There's a radical difference
especially in their martyrs.

A young man at an airport 
blows himself up and believes 
he'll land in paradise
surrounded by virgins.

An old priest saying Mass
in a country church has 
his throat slit and believes 
Allelulia! 

The two religions differ
in a number of ways 
There's a radical difference
especially in their martyrs. 

Awake, arise, the hour is come, 
For rows and revolutions; 
There's no receipt like pike and drum 
For crazy constitutions. 
Close, close the shop! Break, break the loom, 
Desert your hearths and furrows, 
And throng in arms to seal the doom 
Of England's rotten boroughs. 

We'll stretch that tort'ring Castlereagh 
On his own Dublin rack, sir; 
We'll drown the King in Eau de vie, 
The Laureate in his sack, sir, 
Old Eldon and his sordid hag 
In molten gold we'll smother, 
And stifle in his own green bag 
The Doctor and his brother. 

In chains we'll hang in fair Guildhall 
The City's famed recorder, 
And next on proud St Stephen's fall, 
Though Wynne should squeak to order. 
In vain our tyrants then shall try 
To 'scape our martial law, sir; 
In vain the trembling Speaker cry 
That "Strangers must withdraw," sir. 

Copley to hang offends no text; 
A rat is not a man, sir: 
With schedules, and with tax bills next 
We'll bury pious Van, sir. 
The slaves who loved the income Tax, 
We'll crush by scores, like mites, sir, 
And him, the wretch who freed the blacks, 
And more enslaved the whites, sir. 

The peer shall dangle from his gate, 
The bishop from his steeple, 
Till all recanting, own, the State 
Means nothing but the People. 
We'll fix the church's revenues 
On Apostolic basis, 
One coat, one scrip, one pair of shoes 
Shall pay their strange grimaces. 

We'll strap the bar's deluding train 
In their own darling halter, 
And with his big church bible brain 
The parson at the altar. 
Hail glorious hour, when fair Reform 
Shall bless our longing nation, 
And Hunt receive commands to form 
A new administration. 

Carlisle shall sit enthroned, where sat 
Our Cranmer and our Secker; 
And Watson show his snow-white hat 
In England's rich Exchequer. 
The breast of Thistlewood shall wear 
Our Wellesley's star and sash, man: 
And many a mausoleum fair 
Shall rise to honest Cashman. 

Then, then beneath the nine-tailed cat 
Shall they who used it writhe, sir; 
And curates lean, and rectors fat, 
Shall dig the ground they tithe, sir. 
Down with your Bayleys, and your Bests, 
Your Giffords, and your Gurneys: 
We'll clear the island of the pests, 
Which mortals name attorneys. 

Down with your sheriffs, and your mayors, 
Your registrars, and proctors, 
We'll live without the lawyer's cares, 
And die without the doctor's. 
No discontented fair shall pout 
To see her spouse so stupid; 
We'll tread the torch of Hymen out, 
And live content with Cupid. 

Then, when the high-born and the great 
Are humbled to our level, 
On all the wealth of Church and State, 
Like aldermen, we'll revel. 
We'll live when hushed the battle's din, 
In smoking and in cards, sir, 
In drinking unexcised gin, 
And wooing fair Poissardes, sir. 

it was on the d floor on Coronado Street
I used to get drunk
and throw the radio through the window
while it was playing, and, of course,
it would break the glass in the window
and the radio would sit there on the roof
still playing
and I'd tell my woman,
"Ah, what a marvelous radio!"
the next morning I'd take the window
off the hinges
and carry it down the street
to the glass man
who would put in another pane.
I kept throwing that radio through the window
each time I got drunk
and it would sit there on the roof
still playing-
a magic radio
a radio with guts,
and each morning I'd take the window 
back to the glass man.
I don't remember how it ended exactly
though I do remember
we finally moved out.
there was a woman downstairs who worked in
the garden in her bathing suit,
she really dug with that trowel
and she put her behind up in the air
and I used to sit in the window
and watch the sun shine all over that thing
while the music played. 

I came into this world
there wasn't a celebration, 
there was no cradle to swing
i was just damned to starvation.

Never did i go to school, 
never could i play a game.
Was only destined to bear
the enduring pain.

Half a pant covered me
be it the searing summers, 
or i be shivering in the 
cold winter's rain.

Grew up on the streets
became a rag picker.
That tag stuck to me 
more like a bad sticker.

I went to work each day
embedded in anguish.
from their cars they 
resented me 
like cheap rubbish.

Once there was a crime
the police thought was mine.
I was beaten up with disdain, 
I was literally being slain, 
yet not a single eye
looked away in shame.

I kept crying, and pleaded 
sir please, it's not me, it's not me
but no one was willing to see.

When he was caught
they just left me to be, 
the rag picker i that
always shall be.

I cleared for them 
their garbage but
no one patted me
and not a soul cried.
Not a soul came to me 
asking me why? 

Afterall, 
I was just a rag picker
born to die.
Clearing all their garbage 
there would lie.


Putting out summer’s sultry heat
The sky had its face washed clean
And wiped the grime off Earth’s soiled feet

The dawn is quietly breaking
Night lights still glimmer here and there
The blue firmament remains cloudless
And cool is the mild blowing air

The sleeping town is slowly waking up
And at this transitional point
I look out into the street
To see a sight that shall never disappoint

Along the road moves one, ragged and withered
His discolored white hair left unkempt
With hunch back and drooping shoulders
The marks Time has left of the hard years spent

Though age has drained his life sap away
He has a firm resolve never to beg
His frail body supported on a stick
Serves as a veritable third leg

With his staff, he perseveringly stirs
Every heap of abandoned rubbish
Indiscriminately piled on either side of the road
Hunting for trinkets lying hidden in the trash

A rag picker with a sack on his back
Picking up today’s treasure
From yesterday’s discarded trash
Things, for him ‘priceless’ beyond measure

With complaints none
He faces life and its trials
Never losing the glitter in his eyes
Though a loner in life’s dark isles

I ask myself, why every day
I routinely look for this man who limps along
And I get a quick answer
‘He helps you turn your sobs into a song’I am your sunlit colour desire
woven with split clouds droplets
of which you have no hope. 

I'm
your illusive quest receding
at your approach
of which you have no clue. 

She's not the end of my rainbow
she's its beginning-
I am blinded by her colors-

her red, crimson, blood-red lips
which promise fire and burn
into me with the furious fury of red river flows
she gives in her passion eddies.

Her cheeks glow with that same tint
and floating high her aureola gleams
above violet eyes which stream
out and into deep my soul-
where our Rainbow Yellow lives.

Joy is surely the color yellow; 
we are joined-participled, 
framed by her tresses of similar hue.

Her orange is mellow light
and plunges down her dappled nape
to her nipples making them
orange-erect and wanting.

Her body blood at center now
is violet and indigo; 
blood flow now beneath her skin 
glows with these; 
two hues blending to announce 
the purple promises she makes
with her body-scape 
arched high 
rainbow-shaped
making our colors blend; 
and now the semi-circle is reversed
to allow me into her deeper hues.

Outside the trees display green; 
inside our rainbows sing
announcing
yet another new beginning.

I catch me then a rainbow each day, 
marvel at it
lying in my bed
translucent. 

A Love Song about Our Inner Needs and Lack of understanding in relationships - written years ago but updated
 
The sun set golden o’er the sea 
The stars begin to fill the sky 
Across the sand you walk with me 
I see the moonlight in your eye
Silvery waves dance too and fro
We watched moon-tide, ebb and flow

chorus 
From the hearts of fire to the coldest star 
What kind of love do you hide? 
From the broken people at the broken bar 
What kind of love? – a rainbow inside!

We are only ever what we feel 
Let defenses fall and fears go
We have to trust to make love real 
We’re only living when in love 
Will you be my hand in glove? 

There’s a fire dancing on the river 
A spirit sings and calls your name 
Here and now, the soul’s forever 
In your eyes I see it’s flame 
O hold me darling till night goes by 
Hold me sweet DARLING let me cry. 

The sun sinks golden o’er the sea 
The stars begin to sparkle bright 
Across the sand you walk with me 
That wave enchanted summer night 
What pleasures in your eyes did glow
Like tide and moon in ebb and flow

From hearts of fire to the coldest star 
What kind of love do you hide? 
From the broken people at the broken bar

Beauty of heart is truth I know

You are the Heaven in my eyes
As silver waves dance too and fro
In the moon-tide we ebb and flow

chorus 
From the hearts of fire to the coldest star 
What kind of love do you hide? 
From the broken people at the broken bar 
What kind of love? – a rainbow inside!

We are only what we feel 
Honesty and trust will reveal 
We’re only living when in love 
Will you be my hand in glove? 

There’s a fire dancing on the river 
Here and now, the soul’s forever 
A spirit sings and calls your name 
In your eyes I see it’s flame 
O hold me darling till night goes by 
Hold me sweet DARLING let me cry. 

Romance
to Bloom
let me wait
and watch out 
When the Spring Rains; 

it is 
now in the sky
lustly curved
with stunning colours
just a minute
it whispers
a new tune of lies
and glues to heart
pining to see
the invisible sight

The embers
of Romance
lightens up
when the moist hearts
warmly rain
looks of Spring
full of perfumed wings
to suckle the nectar
to open up
the pot of potion
mesmerizing ocean
bodies vanish
leaving imprints 
we see the lovers
kissing empty airs
seeing life images
like Rainbows 
still printed
in transparent airs


To-day it is raining without any break
as if flood has come in sky
so overthrowing all water
breaking its dam

A rainy day is a day
of full relax and enjoyment
with deliciousness of self cooked dishes
and a cup of coffee or tea

The young couple may be enjoying
the thundering cloud
palpitation of heart must be increasing 
intending to quench thirst of life
so, the cloud is getting dark
to view the wanton look of couple

Children are enjoying the rainy day
as they are free from study
making paper boat to sail down the lane 

Baby child is also trying 
to catch the rain drop
spreading his little palm out of window

The old couple is also sitting in the courtyard
remembering those days when they enjoyed 
the rainy day under one umbrella
half they drenched, half they embraced

A rainy is the day
of full rest and enjoyment

Begone! all anxieties of life and
let me enjoy the rainy day of my life.(Parvati at her lattice)
O Love! were you a basil-wreath to twine 
among my tresses,
A jewelled clasp of shining gold to bind around my sleeve,
O Love! were you the keora's soul that haunts 
my silken raiment,
A bright, vermilion tassel in the girdles that I weave;

O Love! were you the scented fan 
that lies upon my pillow,
A sandal lute, or silver lamp that burns before my shrine,
Why should I fear the jealous dawn 
that spreads with cruel laughter,
Sad veils of separation between your face and mine?

Haste, O wild-bee hours, to the gardens of the sun set!
Fly, wild-parrot day, to the orchards of the west!
Come, O tender night, with your sweet, 
consoling darkness,
And bring me my Beloved to the shelter of my breast!

(Amar Singh in the saddle)
O Love! were you the hooded hawk upon my hand 
that flutters,
Its collar-band of gleaming bells atinkle as I ride,
O Love! were you a turban-spray or 
floating heron-feather,
The radiant, swift, unconquered sword 
that swingeth at my side;

O Love! were you a shield against the 
arrows of my foemen,
An amulet of jade against the perils of the way,
How should the drum-beats of the dawn 
divide me from your bosom,
Or the union of the midnight be ended with the day?

Haste, O wild-deer hours, to the meadows of the sunset!
Fly, wild stallion day, to the pastures of the west!
Come, O tranquil night, with your soft, 
consenting darkness,
And bear me to the fragrance of my Beloved's breast

I turn away the diamonds in her blood
To try to guess the texture I really wish I could
It takes a lot in order for me to get the feelin'
To see how a liquid can be the cause of all the killin'
I try to break down the root of the concrete door 
But not even the rusty banner on the side tore
I try to make my way as I’m dartin' off to class
But the teacher can’t let me in if I don’t have a pass
I’m wastin' time tryna get my eyes to see right past the light
It’s hard when a bloody diamond shines brighter in the night
Or maybe I’m encompassed by the pleasure of the view 
I’m still tryna make it though in minutes I only have few.
Maybe I should skip but that'll result in a detention 
But knowing me I won't serve it being the cause of suspension
Then I'll be stuck at home livin in my room
Hopefully I can get away without facing doom
I think I need to sprint in order to be fine
The first bell rang and for some reason a sign
I try to yell the teachers name but no one is replyin'
So now I'm contemplatin' on if I should get to lyin'
The second bell rang only a second from the first
And I think I already have an excuse planned out and rehearsed
The third bell is on the edge and I'm making my entrance
I know I'm just gonna get ridiculed for my poor attendance
But wait I'm in and only by the skin of my  teeth
But I still got off scott free so I get to gasp and yell sheesh
                           * Creator - Me, Maxiro Xeniyah
                                
                                ! 
Like a psycho
Like Michael
it's aight though
We'll fight y'know
til the knight go
and the fright blow
So get out of sight yo
When we'll rise you might know

He's truthless 
cause he ruthless
and useless
like a woodchuck toothless
In a noose pit
Until he lose it
Then he groove it
Cause he like to, move it move it

That's a tint shade lemur
Like a renegade femur
I guess I'm just a trick skate dreamer

Inspired by Lupe Fiasco's Blackout song recommend you listen to it.

It was a lovely day, 
The hawthorn hedge 
Was coming into bloom 
And on the lawn 
Just freshly mown 
Something slowly moved. 

It was a rat 
So old its fur was caked 
With dirt, its skin 
Was scaled with scabs 
And on its back 
Like something 

Pornographic or obscene 
A tumour glistened. 
It was the most 
Disgusting thing 
I’d ever seen. 
It stumbled 

As it made its way 
Across the grass. 
It did not seem 
To match the day, 
The singing birds 
Now busy with their broods, 

The butterflies 
That fluttered in the sun. 
This rat had had its day. 
I tried to put myself 
Into its head. 
It could not see 

Or hear the birds, 
It could not smell 
And was in desperate pain. 
The poor thing 
Was trembling, 
And lost. 

Have pity on this tortured soul, 
It could be you or me. 

While drawing a circle, 
A ray of sun that slips on your sad face
Is not only a ray, it is the light.
Moreover, my feelings
slipping in your soul
Until your heart
Begins to vibrate
Mean all, 

alone  and none to 
Take Care of me  here 
In the awesome site of poem.
A masque, bullies me behind
The guise of a monster.
Unnerved I decide not to
Tread on this way.
I feel asleep, 
Going deep, 
Into the bed
Of My dream.
Suddenly, A ray reaches
Then two, three, four. 
Numbers of rays, 
Reach on my sleepy eyes.
Amazed I find my friends
H are standing near
Holding lamps of hope.
I awake and follow them, 
Their poems, comments, write.
I follow their light! ! 

As I start to feel lonely again, 
I reach for an old friend.
A friend of shiny steel, 
With a razors edge.
I start to feel alive again, 
As I press the blade to my skin.
I can see the beautifully cut skin
As the blood rolls down my arm.
The numbness has started to cease, 
But the hurt and despair is always there.
It reminds me of the perfect life, 
But I know I will never see it.
The pain from the cuts quickly dies.
I can’t stand not feeling, 
So again I take my old friend.
I draw a line for every thought 
That’s running through my mind.
For everyone that’s hurt me
And everyone that’s abandoned me.
I look down and realize
I am sitting in a pool of red.
I start to feel dizzy.
The room starts spinning, 
Faster and faster it goes.
As I fall to the floor 
I can feel the life draining from my weak body.
The thoughts cease as I raise my head.
The only thing left is someone finding me dead. 

I wish I could be that, 
I hoped that someone could show me the way.
But I'm better of dead.
Or at least gone far and far away.

I don't want to be sad, 
I don't want to feel this way, 
But this pain hurts so bad.
I have no reason to stay.

I'm sorry for all the agony.
I regret the day I was born.
I have to live this life relentlessly, 
For my final shape to take form. 

The old poet
with his face full of lines,
with iambs jumping in his hair like fleas,
with all the revisions of his body
unsaying him,
walks to the podium.

He is about to tell us
how he came to this. 

A lyre slants against the chair
you sit in. 
Silent and alert, 
as ever it waits for the poet's touch
to shimmer the strings
into sharp sounds.

You sit still, 
revolving poems in your memory, 
sifting them
to find the ones we
can grapple with, take fully
within our minds.

Late in the evening, 
we discover the mind's neighbor, 
the shy soul, so often hidden, 
suddenly appears, having
already written these poems, 
so ancient and abiding

is the measure of your words.
And we realize
as cold October air
bites our homeward faces, 
that your soul has been laughing
us into joy for almost nine decades. 

I need a real home whereby i will be appreciated for my personal attributes. 
I am composing a poem, because my right to information, health, 
respect, dignity & freedom of expression has been violated. 
The fact is i am writing from experience, because this have 
been happening from when i was young.  
Hence, it's hard for me to feel at home. 
So, i don't worry, because i am a poet. 

A real man.  

believes in his aim, objective & vision.
A real man is not afraid to sacrifice his time for the one & only.
A real man knows how to treat a lady.
A real man is not afraid to admit his weak-points.
A real man knows that everything has it's own place & time.

A real man knows how to make her partner happy!
A real man knows that he must be faithful to his partner.
A real man is not afraid to apologize to his partner.
A real man is not afraid to take his responsibility. / 
A real man is not afraid to relax after hard work.
A real man is not afraid to express his feelings.



The patriots are generally seen
In loving country
Loving nation
Thinking bigger of both
Laboring harder for both 
Materializing the dreams
More than
They love own home
Own things, own region
Own family, own man
They are remembered
By their nation generally; 

But a real patriot is rare seen
Whose birth is for the nations
To love, to lead the way to love
To save, to lead the way to save
Even in life danger
He thinks of other, 
Not only for here
But for hereafter, 
Some people may misunderstand
With patience them he tries guide, 

He not only thinks of the country
And the nations
A multi virtues tree
But takes urgent care of it
Up to catch fruits
For all to enjoy the labored fruits
He is remembered
By all the nations especially.



Muzahidul Reza
then tomorrow if your feelings change
I can then be transformed into Satan.

If I am steady most and not either 
then clearly then Reality for me is the same
and your feelings about me must be in disconnect
and not rooted in who I really am.

If Mind changes its stripes
and truth today can become tomorrow false
how then is Mind rooted in Reality, which we agree
undergoes no change.

If spirit too can vacillate from exaltation to low depression
what is then steady most in our universe? 

If all of the elements in our periodic table are in constant flux
losing and gaining electrons
and existing one minute but not the next
what then is the nature of any Unchanging Reality? 

Clearly then all is in flux and who I am today may not be
who I will be tomorrow.
Good news this and bad news too, because how can I predict
the who I will be and if I will like Who Now better than Who Tomorrow? 

Some question then if all things change, then what then is doing the changing; they point to Consciousness. If things change who is tracking steady-state all that changes and recording it? The self? Is Self and Consciousness that steady state beneath all things changing? Or do they too change from time to time? 

Puzzling this.

So when one is told 'Get in touch with Reality' what the hell could that possibly mean-yours, mine today, mine tomorrow, yours now, or yours which will will surely change tomorrow too

See the sun shining and the hillsides so green
The meadows reflecting the faint morning light
The lilies they blossom in nature's wide screen
While the air feels fresh after a clear pristine night

I love the dew drops on my bare feet
Anticipating the summer heat
But I have to leave this sweet landscape behind
The blue sky has taken my peace of mind

This beauty was all I have known for years
Since I left you, steadfast, but torn and in tears
You gave me the freedom to follow my heart
I missed you every second we were apart

I told you I had a promise to keep
A lifetime ago and a love so deep
So I went to live his last days with him
Because he's forever carved in my being

I made a vow to come back to you
If you ever only still wanted me to
One last loving look back to the greenfields afar
Don't wipe off the tear as I walk to my car

Memories of past years come to my mind
Distant dreams of a life left behind
Piercing through my heart like cut glass
I smile through my tears and I step on the gas

The road takes me down to my favourite place
Where I told you good-bye in a dolorous haze
I park my car and walk down the crowded street
Anxious to see you I'm stumbling on my feet

Now I am standing on our holy ground
Waiting in the city lights for you to come around
The sun is the same, shining in my face so gently and warm
I blink and I smile as I wake up in your arms


When silence speaks
A thousand tongues, 
My words can speak
But one.

And though my heart can
sense Eternity, 
Beating in tandem
with yours-
Why do my eyes seek
And probe
And question? 

The Language of Love
Perhaps, is one
I need to understand; 
Still

And Still shall I be
I know, when I
Permeate and flow
As water-
As Life.
When I meet you
Where you have always been.

In me. 

A Reason And A Purpose

Our life's journey here on earth
has a reason and a purpose
We have our ups and downs
and we have to deal life
In a gracious manner and more fulfilling
counting our blessings from day to day

Focusing on the pains and sufferings
will only miss the beauty and richness life can offer
there must be a reason why
Just look at the brighter side
Allow your heart to leap with joy
And with gratitude to the One Above

In His time, everything will be for the best
He will take care of the rest.
be happy and contented



Lips of tenderness
Moist blue cirrus clouds
A virtuous woman
Never makes one sad
A voice of substance
Penetrates the core.

The woman I hold 
Closest to my soul
Her sweetness matches
the angel from up high
Her beauty within
Outshines yellow roses
Only found in paradise.

Having her in my life
Fills me with gladness
Knowing the flame of love
Burns within her heart
Bring tears to my eyes.

Regardless of how much there’s trouble? 
Are you a devil-may-care
Or just a debonair? 
 
You’ll find hard
To hide your relief
But things are improving
Emotionally and materially
 
Until you’ve completely converted
A nice chance into a success
Please, be wise to disguise this
This season brings a reason to relax


On his death-bed poor Lubin lies: 
His spouse is in despair: 
With frequent sobs, and mutual cries, 
They both express their care. 

A different cause, says Parson Sly, 
The same effect may give: 
Poor Lubin fears that he may die; 
His wife, that he may live. 

I.

A bird delicious to the taste,
On which an army once did feast,
   Sent by an hand unseen;
A creature of the horned race,
Which Britain's royal standards grace;
   A gem of vivid green;

II.

A town of gaiety and sport,
Where beaux and beauteous nymphs resort,
   And gallantry doth reign;
A Dardan hero fam'd of old
For youth and beauty, as we're told,
   And by a monarch slain;

III.

A peer of popular applause,
Who doth our violated laws,
   And grievances proclaim.
Th' initials show a vanquish'd town,
That adds fresh glory and renown
   To old Britannia's fame. 

The Scottish hinds, too poor to house
In frosty nights their starving cows,
While not a blade of grass or hay
Appears from Michaelmas to May,
Must let their cattle range in vain
For food along the barren plain:
Meagre and lank with fasting grown,
And nothing left but skin and bone;
Exposed to want, and wind, and weather,
They just keep life and soul together,
Till summer showers and evening's dew
Again the verdant glebe renew;
And, as the vegetables rise,
The famish'd cow her want supplies;
Without an ounce of last year's flesh;
Whate'er she gains is young and fresh;
Grows plump and round, and full of mettle,
As rising from Medea's kettle.
With youth and beauty to enchant
Europa's counterfeit gallant.
Why, Stella, should you knit your brow,
If I compare you to a cow?
'Tis just the case; for you have fasted
So long, till all your flesh is wasted;
And must against the warmer days
Be sent to Quilca down to graze;
Where mirth, and exercise, and air,
Will soon your appetite repair:
The nutriment will from within,
Round all your body, plump your skin;
Will agitate the lazy flood,
And fill your veins with sprightly blood.
Nor flesh nor blood will be the same
Nor aught of Stella but the name:
For what was ever understood,
By human kind, but flesh and blood?
And if your flesh and blood be new,
You'll be no more the former you;
But for a blooming nymph will pass,
Just fifteen, coming summer's grass,
Your jetty locks with garlands crown'd:
While all the squires for nine miles round,
Attended by a brace of curs,
With jockey boots and silver spurs,
No less than justices o' quorum,
Their cow-boys bearing cloaks before 'em,
Shall leave deciding broken pates,
To kiss your steps at Quilca gates.
But, lest you should my skill disgrace,
Come back before you're out of case;
For if to Michaelmas you stay,
The new-born flesh will melt away;
The 'squires in scorn will fly the house
For better game, and look for grouse;
But here, before the frost can mar it,
We'll make it firm with beef and claret. 

While I do not know nor hope to ever find out what it feels like having to have taken another's life, I wish to thank you and all your fellow comrades for my children and their children. You placed your life on the line so that my children could grow up free, without oppression. That my grandchildren might never know the great fear one faces when they flee for their very lives. I owe you a debt that's impossible to repay. When I see my future dreams able to experience joy instead of hardship, I think of people like you. People who, without reguard for their own pleasure put it all on the line for those who they may never see nor hear from, just for a purpose, a principle, that all people everywhere might someday be free.


I'v been 
skinned alive
de-boned
filleted
skilleted
dev oured
digested 
shat out 
and forgottena recurrent theme 
in my life
is how my job
causes such strife

it's not what i want
but it's pretty good
but I'd rather be playing
out in the woods

I'd rather be farming
or sailing the seas
than feeling this air-
conditioned breeze

exploring a cave
or diving a wreck
it'd be worth it
to risk my neck

but is it wiser
that instead I am here
with computer and chair? 
or is it just fear? 

the older you get
the less you can do
I'd like people I've met
to not say 'who? '

Now it is noon
a chance to bike ride
or kayak or jog
but inside I still hide.

Gotta look like I'm working
gotta put in the time
but my soul has snuck off
and left me here to rhyme. 

Your lips are like a southern lily red, 
Wet with the soft rain-kisses of the night, 
In which the brown bee buries deep its head, 
When still the dawn's a silver sea of light. 

Your lips betray the secret of your soul, 
The dark delicious essence that is you, 
A mystery of life, the flaming goal 
I seek through mazy pathways strange and new. 

Your lips are the red symbol of a dream, 
What visions of warm lilies they impart, 
That line the green bank of a fair blue stream, 
With butterflies and bees close to each heart! 

Brown bees that murmur sounds of music rare, 
That softly fall upon the langourous breeze, 
Wafting them gently on the quiet air 
Among untended avenues of trees. 

O were I hovering, a bee, to probe 
Deep down within your scented heart, fair flower, 
Enfolded by your soft vermilion robe, 
Amorous of sweets, for but one perfect hour

A dark grey, a very dark grey, a quite dark grey is monstrous ordinarily, it is so monstrous because there is no red in it. If red is in everything it is not necessary. Is that not an argument for any use of it and even so is there any place that is better, is there any place that has so much stretched out. 

No red kettles and bells
this December outside
the stores at the mall

in our suburbs this year. 
They irritate shoppers, 
the business article says.

So folks will keep their bills 
as usual but now they can't 
get rid of their change. 

You're in this dream of cotton plants.
You raise a hoe, swing, and the first weeds
Fall with a sigh. You take another step,
Chop, and the sigh comes again,
Until you yourself are breathing that way
With each step, a sigh that will follow you into town.

That's hours later. The sun is a red blister
Coming up in your palm. Your back is strong,
Young, not yet the broken chair
In an abandoned school of dry spiders. 
Dust settles on your forehead, dirt
Smiles under each fingernail.
You chop, step, and by the end of the first row,
You can buy one splendid fish for wife
And three sons. Another row, another fish,
Until you have enough and move on to milk,
Bread, meat. Ten hours and the cupboards creak.
You can rest in the back yard under a tree.
Your hands twitch on your lap,
Not unlike the fish on a pier or the bottom
Of a boat. You drink iced tea. The minutes jerk
Like flies. 

			It's dusk, now night,
And the lights in your home are on.
That costs money, yellow light
In the kitchen. That's thirty steps,
You say to your hands,
Now shaped into binoculars.
You could raise them to your eyes:
You were a fool in school, now look at you.
You're a giant among cotton plants.
Now you see your oldest boy, also running.
Papa, he says, it's time to come in.
You pull him into your lap
And ask, What's forty times nine?
He knows as well as you, and you smile.
The wind makes peace with the trees,
The stars strike themselves in the dark.
You get up and walk with the sigh of cotton plants.
You go to sleep with a red sun on your palm,
The sore light you see when you first stir in bed. 

O my Luve's like a red, red rose
That's newly sprung in June; 
O my Luve's like the melodie
That's sweetly play'd in tune.

As fair art thou, my bonnie lass,
So deep in luve am I:
And I will luve thee still, my dear,
Till a' the seas gang dry:

Till a' the seas gang dry, my dear,
And the rocks melt wi' the sun:
I will luve thee still, my dear,
While the sands o' life shall run.

And fare thee well, my only Luve
And fare thee well, a while! 
And I will come again, my Luve,
Tho' it were ten thousand mile. 

Rest and look at this goddamned wheelbarrow. Whatever
It is. Dogs and crocodiles, sunlamps. Not
For their significance.
For their significant. For being human
The signs escape you. You, who aren't very bright
Are a signal for them. Not,
I mean, the dogs and crocodiles, sunlamps. Not
Their significance. 

At one time I was blind 
Blinded by the person in the mirror
The person in the mirror
Was someone I didn't like
A person that was full of anger
Anger which know one could stop
A person who was dishonest 
A person who lied to themselves
A person who lied, cheated and stole
This person scared me
Yet the reflection I seen
Was me
How could this be me? 
I didn't like this person I was looking at
That person couldn't of been me
Yet it was time to face the facts
This was me
This is who I'am
Now I know I had to change
If I didn't like this person
Then who would like this person

Seasons bloom and seasons wither; dark or bright, they cannot last.
Must we try with floods of bitter teas to vivify the past?
Vainly chase the brown and broken blossoms blown along the blast?

Shall we scorn the flowers around us - red, or blue, or white as snow -
Flowers giving loads of fragrance unto all the winds that blow
Must we hide our eyes and falter: 'O, the days of long ago!'

Never stop to look behind you, if the blaze of glory there
Blinds you to the splendour stretching round about and everywhere.
True, the past was pleasant, Lawson, but the present is as fair.

I, too, love the days when heroes, seeking treasure, seaward sped;
Days of Drake, when English sailors followed where their leaders led;
Days when Marlowe trod the glowing clouds, that thundered to his tread.

Even then, though, there were cowards, traitors, swindler, 'business men,'
Plot and murder, slave and master, secret sneer, and wounding pen;
And the poets thought the present vile and barren even then.

And their comrades were no better than some modern mates we meet -
Even though they don't go wearing tights and feathers in the street;
And the girls are dear as ever, and their kisses just as sweet.

Sing the present; dropp the drivel of the 'days evanished,' please!
Though you pray until your pants are burst or baggy at the knees,
You can't bid the sun go backward - no, not even ten degrees. 

I look at the sky
Wonder how tall it could be
I put my hands on my heart
Wonder how many beats left to live
Day passed to night
But eyes tired to see and sleep

If i could be the air people use to breathe
From them, I want to know what secrets lies beneath
From them, I want to learn how i can cope to live
But all are for them not me
So i cant find what i want to be

Then I look myself on water reflection
Sober to know the real one is me
No matter who i used to be
I do own true me
Our life is living beyond infinity
Because value of self entity is eternity

I look at the sky
Now i see chances are through bravery
As long this heart beats still
I own me to be me


Never until the mankind making
Bird beast and flower
Fathering and all humbling darkness
Tells with silence the last light breaking
And the still hour
Is come of the sea tumbling in harness

And I must enter again the round
Zion of the water bead
And the synagogue of the ear of corn
Shall I let pray the shadow of a sound
Or sow my salt seed
In the least valley of sackcloth to mourn

The majesty and burning of the child's death.
I shall not murder
The mankind of her going with a grave truth
Nor blaspheme down the stations of the breath
With any further
Elegy of innocence and youth.

Deep with the first dead lies London's daughter,
Robed in the long friends,
The grains beyond age, the dark veins of her mother,
Secret by the unmourning water
Of the riding Thames.
After the first death, there is no other. 

You 'never loved me,' Ada. These slow words 
Dropped softly from your gentle woman-tongue 
Out of your true and kindly woman-heart, 
Fell, piercing into mine like very swords 
The sharper for their kindness. Yet no wrong 
Lies to your charge, nor cruelty, nor art,-- 
Ev'n when you spoke, I saw the tender tear-drop start. 

You 'never loved me.' No, you never knew, 
You, with youth's morning fresh upon your soul, 
What 't is to love: slow, drop by drop, to pour 
Our life's whole essence, perfumed through and through 
With all the best we have or can control 
For the libation--cast it down before 
Your feet--then lift the goblet, dry for evermore. 

I shall not die as foolish lovers do: 
A man's heart beats beneath thid breast of mine, 
The breast where--Curse on that fiend-whispering 
'It might have been!'--Ada, I will be true 
Unto myself--the self that so loved thine: 
May all life's pain, like these few tears that spring 
For me, glance off as rain-drops from my white dove's wing! 

May you live long, some good man's bosom flower, 
And gather chldren round your matron knees: 
So, when all this is past, and you and I 
Remember each our youth-days as an hour 
Of joy--or anguish, one, serene, at ease, 
May come to meet the other's steadfast eye, 
Thinking, 'He loved me well!' clasp hands, and so pass by. 

Love flew in my window
I thought 'whatever for? ! '
in the past it just brought woe
so I showed it to the door

Then in through my window
crawled a thing called Fear
saying 'if you won't chance Love
then I will live right here'We've moved
my wife and I from home 
to the last place

we'll ever live and she 
wants to know why 
I'm sitting around

not helping to unpack.
So I tell her the problem
which is her problem too

but she keeps unpacking.
I'm not at home, I tell her, 
but I'm not here either.

Not to worry, I say.
I'll let both of us in 
when we arrive. 

HERE in lovely New England
When summer is come, a sea-turn
Flutters a page of remembrance
In the volume of long ago.
Soft is the wind over Grand Pre
Stirring the heads of the grasses,
Sweet is the breath of the orchards
White with their apple-blow.
There at their infinite business
Of measuring time forever,
Murmuring songs of the sea,
The great tides come and go.
Over the dikes and the uplands
Wander the great cloud shadows,
Strange as the passing of sorrow,
Beautiful, solemn, and slow.
For, spreading her old enchantment
Of tender ineffable wonder,
Summer is there in the Northland!
How should my heart not know

A bunch of dried heather
Now faded.
Long dead, 
Still sits in a vase on
A table.
And
My bed
Faces it, surely I
Must obey 
Reason
And throw it, with mem'ries
Away, then
Move on. 

Oh yes, 
that reminds me, 
I wanted to ask you
to drink some wine
laced with love
and cyanide. 

YES, thou art gone ! and never more
     Thy sunny smile shall gladden me ;
   But I may pass the old church door,
     And pace the floor that covers thee.

   May stand upon the cold, damp stone,
     And think that, frozen, lies below
   The lightest heart that I have known,
     The kindest I shall ever know.

   Yet, though I cannot see thee more,
   'Tis still a comfort to have seen ;
 And though thy transient life is o'er,
   'Tis sweet to think that thou hast been ;

 To think a soul so near divine, 
   Within a form so angel fair,
 United to a heart like thine,
   Has gladdened once our humble sphere. 

WE, that did nothing study but the way
To love each other, with which thoughts the day
Rose with delight to us and with them set,
Must learn the hateful art, how to forget.
We, that did nothing wish that Heaven could give
Beyond ourselves, nor did desire to live
Beyond that wish, all these now cancel must,
As if not writ in faith, but words and dust.
Yet witness those clear vows which lovers make,
Witness the chaste desires that never brake
Into unruly heats; witness that breast
Which in thy bosom anchor'd his whole rest--
'Tis no default in us: I dare acquite
Thy maiden faith, thy purpose fair and white
As thy pure self. Cross planets did envy
Us to each other, and Heaven did untie
Faster than vows could bind. Oh, that the stars,
When lovers meet, should stand opposed in wars!

Since then some higher Destinies command,
Let us not strive, nor labour to withstand
What is past help. The longest date of grief
Can never yield a hope of our relief:
Fold back our arms; take home our fruitless loves,
That must new fortunes try, like turtle-doves
Dislodged from their haunts. We must in tears
Unwind a love knit up in many years.
In this last kiss I here surrender thee
Back to thyself.--So, thou again art free:
Thou in another, sad as that, resend
The truest heart that lover e'er did lend.
Now turn from each: so fare our sever'd hearts
As the divorced soul from her body parts. 

Wars in peacetime don't behave like wars.
So loving they are.
Kissed on both cheeks, silk-lined ambassadors
Pose and confer.

Unbuckle your envy, drop it there by the door.
We will settle,
We will settle without blows or bullets
The unequal score.

In nature, havenots have to be many
And havelots few.
Making money out of making money
Helps us help you.

This from the party of good intent. From the other,
Hunger's stare,
Drowned crops, charred hopes, fear, stupor, prayer.
And literature. 

As a man from nowhere
I speak on behalf of myself
I wish to see the truth
The truth in all ways
I don't say, what I say
Is the only truth of man
It is just a request
A request to return
Return from this brutal development.

A land is waiting for us
The land which we can establish
Imagine, the love and birds
The freshness and we-feeling
Think of the greens and water
Where all wish to say something
Something of lord and everything of them.

As a person like you
I feel to express all this
Which few may think
But am sure others will blink
What I wish may be too foolish
But in fact no one is wise. 

Please watch after me
as a caring mother would her child
even after I have long passed on.
Set calla lilies on my grave, 
and dust off my gravestone
as I lie below gruesome and lone.

Should I live long and seem ancient
with moles and wrinkles, aches and pains
And become wholly apathetic - 
Just kiss me on the forehead again and again, 
and work your hands to massage my troubling cricks.
But never, never pity me should I fall sick.

For now while I am young 
with little discretion and knowledge, 
while I am still a dreamer. 
Do not be sorrowed when I fail, 
nor when I do wrong, be bitter.
I ask that you guide me in every endeavor.
Not because it's easy, but 'cause you love me, ever


Ponder my words, if so that any be
Known guilty here of incivility;
Let what is graceless, discomposed, and rude,
With sweetness, smoothness, softness be endued:
Teach it to blush, to curtsey, lisp, and show
Demure, but yet full of temptation, too.
Numbers ne'er tickle, or but lightly plea{e,
Unless they have some wanton carriages:--
This if ye do, each piece will here be good
And graceful made by your neat sisterhood. 

For you i spoilt my career, 
even you consider me as inferior, 
what sort of evidence will make you realise, 
that for you i can do any sacrifise.
as on sunday you gave me a smiley look, 
to do anything for you, i make my head shook.
but i think that you were revolving me around, 
and brought up a keen sense of deceaving sound.
why are you doing so? 
i just can't make myself it know.
but to pierce and burn the heart of your lover is not humanity.
just one week back, both of us loved each other towards eternity.
now i fails to find a bit of love in you towards infinity.
is something happened wrong with you? 
or you are doing wrong with me.
it had been a long time of our kiss, 
but now if i talks about it, you considers as tease.
why are you behaving with me like an arrogant? 
please make a pause on it as it is not pleasant.
stock of patience is no more remained in me, 
reply me your intension and i am ready to pay a fee.
just return my love back to me by being wise, 
or, strictly you will be responsible for my demise. 

Neobule, being tired,
Far too tired to laugh or weep,
From the hours, rosy and gray,
Hid her golden face away.
Neobule, fain of sleep,
Slept at last as she desired!

Neobule! is it well,
That you haunt the hollow lands,
Where the poor, dead people stray,
Ghostly, pitiful and gray,
Plucking, with their spectral hands,
Scentless blooms of asphodel?

Neobule, tired to death
Of the flowers that I threw
On her flower-like, fair feet,
Sighed for blossoms not so sweet,
Lunar roses pale and blue,
Lilies of the world beneath.

Neobule! ah, too tired
Of the dreams and days above!
Where the poor, dead people stray,
Ghostly, pitiful and gray,
Out of life and out of love,
Sleeps the sleep which she desired. 

I shall 'go gentle into that good night'
I have no wish to 'rage, rage' rave and fight
But rather I would welcome
'The dying of the light'

For being wise I know that 'dark is right'
And old age yet shall seek for its delight
To behold 'the sun in flight'
And the fading of the light


My body received rest but my mind was left to wonder
From reality and reason does it continuously falter
The dreams I have dreamt are now long forgotten
They have withered, disappeared, and turned rotten
Vague glimpses of them have left me in a state of confusion
What has been real? What has been delusion? 
My head becomes hot, sharp spines within are nailed
My body is sound, but my mind has failed
These types of mornings I always dread
What occurrences could have caused this chaos in my head? 
I cannot ask more questions, they make the pain worse
I can only record my experience within this simple verse
Morning is bad, but the day gets better
But what about tomorrow? Or the day after? 
Will the morning go well and the day end in distress? 
What must I do to avoid this? What must I confess? 
One day my conscious I hope to clear
If not, there is no end and limit to my fear


I, trusting that the truly sweet
Would still be sweetly found the true,
Sang, darkling, taught by heavenly heat,
Songs which were wiser than I knew.
To the unintelligible dream
That melted like a gliding star,
I said: ‘We part to meet, fair Gleam!
You are eternal, for you are.’
To Love's strange riddle, fiery writ
In flesh and spirit of all create,
‘Mocker,’ I said, ‘of mortal wit,
Me you shall not mock. I can wait.’A retrospect
- - - - - - - - - 
Fair may look the spring
Fair may look the sun
Fair may look the moon
But far away from once
We dwelt in realm of dreams
No more sunny days
That dawned for us then
Sometimes you smile
Sometimes you sing
Sometimes you quip
Dropping slender, gray words
Like alms given to a beggar 
Heart that is now open to new ties
May look sweet and fair
But doubt I
That can hold ever
The passion of love
As reserved before
And more painful it is
When you come not any more
Yet on way up 
And on way down
When we come across	
You throw smiles
And drop in thin words
While I stretch out my hands
To embrace you
Forever as my friend 

I

Oh, when I was a tiny boy, 
My days and nights were full of joy, 
My mates were blithe and kind!— 
No wonder that I sometimes sigh, 
And dash the tear-drop from my eye, 
To cast a look behind!


II

A hoop was an eternal round 
Of pleasure. In those days I found 
A top a joyous thing;— 
But now those past delights I drop, 
My head, alas! is all my top, 
And careful thoughts the string!


III

My marbles—once my bag was stored,— 
Now I must play with Elgin's lord, 
With Theseus for a taw! 
My playful horse has slipt his string, 
Forgotten all his capering, 
And harness'd to the law!


IV

My kite—how fast and far it flew! 
Whilst I, a sort of Franklin, drew 
My pleasure from the sky! 
'Twas paper'd o'er with studious themes, 
The tasks I wrote—my present dreams 
Will never soar so high!


V

My joys are wingless all and dead; 
My dumps are made of more than lead;— 
My flights soon find a fall; 
My fears prevail, my fancies droop, 
Joy never cometh with a hoop, 
And seldom with a call!


VI

My football's laid upon the shelf; 
I am a shuttlecock myself 
The world knocks to and fro;— 
My archery is all unlearn'd, 
And grief against myself has turn'd 
My arrows and my bow!


VII

No more in noontide sun I bask; 
My authorship's an endless task, 
My head's ne'er out of school: 
My heart is pain'd with scorn and slight, 
I have too many foes to fight, 
And friends grown strangely cool!


VIII

The very chum that shared my cake 
Holds out so cold a hand to shake, 
It makes me shrink and sigh:— 
On this I will not dwell and hang,— 
The changeling would not feel a pang 
Though these should meet his eye! 


IX

No skies so blue or so serene 
As then;—no leaves look half so green 
As clothed the playground tree! 
All things I loved are altered so, 
Nor does it ease my heart to know 
That change resides in me! 


X

Oh for the garb that marked the boy, 
The trousers made of corduroy, 
Well ink'd with black and red; 
The crownless hat, ne'er deem'd an ill— 
It only let the sunshine still 
Repose upon my head!


XI

Oh for the riband round the neck! 
The careless dogs-ears apt to deck 
My book and collar both! 
How can this formal man be styled 
Merely an Alexandrine child, 
A boy of larger growth?


XII

Oh for that small, small beer anew! 
And (heaven's own type) that mild sky-blue 
That wash'd my sweet meals down; 
The master even!—and that small Turk 
That fagg'd me!—worse is now my work— 
A fag for all the town! 


XIII

Oh for the lessons learned by heart! 
Ay, though the very birch's smart 
Should mark those hours again; 
I'd 'kiss the rod,' and be resign'd 
Beneath the stroke, and even find 
Some sugar in the cane!


XIV

The Arabian Nights rehearsed in bed! 
The Fairy Tales in school-time read, 
By stealth, 'twixt verb and noun! 
The angel form that always walk'd 
In all my dreams, and look'd and talk'd 
Exactly like Miss Brown! 


XV

The prize of merit, won for home— 
Merit had prizes then! 
But now I write for days and days, 
For fame—a deal of empty praise, 
Without the silver pen!


XVI

Then 'home, sweet home!' the crowded coach— 
The joyous shout—the loud approach— 
The winding horns like rams'! 
The meeting sweet that made me thrill, 
The sweetmeats, almost sweeter still, 
No 'satis' to the 'jams'!—


XVII

When that I was a tiny boy 
My days and nights were full of joy, 
My mates were blithe and kind! 
No wonder that I sometimes sigh, 
And dash the tear-drop from my eye, 
To cast a look behind

A reverei happend last night. 

JOHN: 
what poetry is or what it should or should not be. 

MOUSAI: 
Glad to see John, at least someone remembered the heavenly Muses.
Poetry is
a symphony in the solemn temples, 
or a painting- of Angilo and Vinci-that's felt.
it is emotions sweetly express in meters.
inspires souls and culture.
and John
it veils in beauty, 
begins in delight and ends in wisdom.
john: 
But what about the new(contemporary)  one, 
as many of My DEARS love it, adorn it? 
Mousai: 
Ah! its nothing but volleys of non sense, a chaos in FORM.
that
sparks annoyance among heavenly muses.
this is no art but 
a swings of
slangs 
in a tortured and fractured tone.
and defies norms 
as deaf to  Beethoven's songs.
And their rhymes, Ah
adorn with words, hard to wade.
that defies all 
poetic worth and trade: 
full of scorns. 
John: 
but we have some 'great minds' 
who creates some fabulous rhymes
Mousai: 
Never mention them please. 
their ART is abhorrence to the mind, 
with flippant rhymes, 
And how daringly they fashioned it as a
contemporary NORMS.
And deems themselves as sages.
John: 
 u mean
' Writing poetry is discovering
the conflict with ourselves'
an echo, a rhythm, make nature to dance as well.
Mousai: 
yes, and yours.  

ah! 
nothing but a 'gore' hosting scuzz.
And buzz of bees; 
snarky and fusty. 

A

First Letter.
First vowel too.

I am an A.
You are an A.
We are As.
And then there's 'An'.

No A means nothing.
A is all.
Well, at least the Beginning.
Never forget.

The day hath scarcely passed that saw thy birth,
Yet thy white wings are plumed to all their scope,
And hour by hour thine eyes have gathered light,
  And grown so large and bright,
That my whole future life unfolds what seems,
  Beneath their gentle beams,
A path that leads athwart some guiltless earth,
To which a star is dropping from the night!

           Not many moons ago,
But when these leafless beds were all aglow
With summer's dearest treasures, I
Was reading in this lonely garden-nook;
A July noon was cloudless in the sky,
And soon I put my shallow studies by;
Then, sick at heart, and angered by the book,
Which, in good sooth, was but the long-drawn sigh
Of some one who had quarreled with his kind,
Vexed at the very proofs which I had sought,
And all annoyed while all alert to find
A plausible likeness of my own dark thought,
I cast me down beneath yon oak's wide boughs,
And, shielding with both hands my throbbing brows,
Watched lazily the shadows of my brain.
The feeble tide of peevishness went down,
And left a flat dull waste of dreary pain,
Which seemed to clog the blood in every vein;
The world, of course, put on its darkest frown --
In all its realms I saw no mortal crown
Which did not wound or crush some restless head;
And hope, and will, and motive, all were dead.
So, passive as a stone, I felt too low
To claim a kindred with the humblest flower;
Even that would bare its bosom to a shower,
While I henceforth would take no pains to live,
Nor place myself where I might feel or give
A single impulse whence a wish could grow.
There was a tulip scarce a gossamer's throw
Beyond that platanus.  A little child,
Most dear to me, looked through the fence and smiled
A hint that I should pluck it for her sake.
Ah, me! I trust I was not well awake --
           The voice was very sweet,
Yet a faint languor kept me in my seat.
I saw a pouted lip, a toss, and heard
Some low expostulating tones, but stirred
Not even a leaf's length, till the pretty fay,
Wondering, and half abashed at the wild feat,
Climbed the low pales, and laughed my gloom away.
And here again, but led by other powers,
A morning and a golden afternoon,
These happy stars, and yonder setting moon,
Have seen me speed, unreckoned and untasked,
           A round of precious hours.
Oh! here, where in that summer noon I basked,
And strove, with logic frailer than the flowers,
To justify a life of sensuous rest,
A question dear as home or heaven was asked,
And without language answered.  I was blest!
Blest with those nameless boons too sweet to trust
Unto the telltale confidence of song.
Love to his own glad self is sometimes coy,
And even thus much doth seem to do him wrong;
While in the fears which chasten mortal joy,
Is one that shuts the lips, lest speech too free,
With the cold touch of hard reality,
Should turn its priceless jewels into dust.
Since that long kiss which closed the morning's talk,
I have not strayed beyond this garden walk.
As yet a vague delight is all I know,
A sense of joy so wild 't is almost pain,
And like a trouble drives me to and fro,
And will not pause to count its own sweet gain.
I am so happy! that is all my thought.
To-morrow I will turn it round and round,
And seek to know its limits and its ground.
To-morrow I will task my heart to learn
The duties which shall spring from such a seed,
And where it must be sown, and how be wrought.
But oh! this reckless bliss is bliss indeed!
And for one day I choose to seal the urn
Wherein is shrined Love's missal and his creed.
Meantime I give my fancy all it craves;
Like him who found the West when first he caught
The light that glittered from the world he sought,
And furled his sails till Dawn should show the land;
While in glad dreams he saw the ambient waves
Go rippling brightly up a golden strand.

Hath there not been a softer breath at play
In the long woodland aisles than often sweeps
At this rough season through their solemn deeps --
A gentle Ariel sent by gentle May,
           Who knew it was the morn
           On which a hope was born,
To greet the flower e'er it was fully blown,
And nurse it as some lily of her own?
And wherefore, save to grace a happy day,
Did the whole West at blushing sunset glow
With clouds that, floating up in bridal snow,
Passed with the festal eve, rose-crowned, away?
And now, if I may trust my straining sight,
The heavens appear with added stars to-night,
And deeper depths, and more celestial height,
Than hath been reached except in dreams or death.
Hush, sweetest South!  I love thy delicate breath;
But hush! methought I felt an angel's kiss!
Oh! all that lives is happy in my bliss.
That lonely fir, which always seems
As though it locked dark secrets in itself,
           Hideth a gentle elf,
Whose wand shall send me soon a frolic troop
Of rainbow visions, and of moonlit dreams.
Can joy be weary, that my eyelids droop?
To-night I shall not seek my curtained nest,
           But even here find rest.
Who whispered then?  And what are they that peep
Betwixt the foliage in the tree-top there?
Come, Fairy Shadows! for the morn is near,
When to your sombre pine ye all must creep;
Come, ye wild pilots of the darkness, ere
My spirit sinks into the gulf of Sleep;
Even now it circles round and round the deep --
           Appear!  Appear

I look on the specious electrical light 
Blatant, mechanical, crawling and white, 
Wickedly red or malignantly green 
Showing, while millions of souls hurry on, 
The virtues of collars, from sunset till dawn, 
By dart or by tumble of whirl within whirl, 
Starting new fads for the shame-weary girl, 
By maggotry motions in sickening line 
Proclaiming a hat or a soup or a wine, 
While there far above the steep cliffs of the street

The stars sing a message elusive and sweet. 
Now man cannot rest in his pleasure and toil 
His clumsy contraptions of coil upon coil 
Till the thing he invents, in its use and its range, 
Leads on to the marvelous CHANGE BEYOND CHANGE 
Some day this old Broadway shall climb to the skies, 
As a ribbon of cloud on a soul-wind shall rise. 
And we shall be lifted, rejoicing by night, 
Till we join with the planets who choir their delight. 
The signs in the street and the signs in the skies 
Shall make me a Zodiac, guiding and wise, 
And Broadway make one with that marvelous stair 
That is climbed by the rainbow-clad spirits of prayer. 

A rhyme of good Death's inn! 
   My love came to that door; 
And she had need of many things, 
   The way had been so sore. 

My love she lifted up her head, 
   "And is there room?" said she; 
"There was no room in Bethlehem's inn 
 


But said the keeper of the inn, 
   "His name is on the door
 

My love then straightway entered there: 
   She hath come back no more. 

Listen now this time
Shortly to my rhyme
That herewith starts
About certain kind hearts
In those stricken parts
That lie behind Calais,
Old crones and aged men
And young children.
About the Picardais,
Who earned my thousand thanks,
Dwellers by the banks
Of mournful Somme
Until War ends)--
These, then, are my friends:
Madame Averlant Lune,
From the town of Bethune;
Good Professeur la Brune
From that town also.
He played the piccolo,
And left his locks to grow.
Dear Madame Hojdes,
Sempstress of Saint Fe.
With Jules and Susette
And Antoinette.
Her children, my sweethearts,
For whom I made darts
Of paper to throw
In their mimic show,
'La guerre aux tranchees.'
That was a pretty play.

There was old Jacques Caron,
Of the hamlet Mailleton.
He let me look
At his household book,
'Comment vivre cent ans.'
What cares I took
To obey this wise book,
I, who feared each hour
Lest Death's cruel power
On the poppied plain
Might make cares vain!

By Noeus-les-mines
Lived old Adelphine,
Withered and clean,
She nodded and smiled,
And used me like a child.
How that old trot beguiled
My leisure with her chatter,
Gave me a china platter
Painted with Cherubim
And mottoes on the rim.
But when instead of thanks
I gave her francs
How her pride was hurt!
She counted francs as dirt,
She called the Kaiser bitch,
She spat on the floor,
Cursing this Prussian war,
That she had known before
Forty years past and more.

There was also 'Tomi,'
With looks sweet and free,
Who called me cher ami.
This orphan's age was nine,
His folk were in their graves,
Else they were slaves
Behind the German line
To terror and rapine--
O, little friends of mine
How kind and brave you were,
You smoothed away care
When life was hard to bear.
And you, old women and men,
Who gave me billets then,
How patient and great-hearted!
Strangers though we started,
Yet friends we ever parted.
This homage to my friends. 

Yes, dear Enchantress, wandering far and long,
In realms unperfumed by the breath of song,
Where flowers ill-flavored shed their sweets around,
And bitterest roots invade the ungenial ground,
Whose gems are crystals from the Epsom mine,
Whose vineyards flow with antimonial wine,
Whose gates admit no mirthful feature in,
Save one gaunt mocker, the Sardonic grin,
Whose pangs are real, not the woes of rhyme
That blue-eyed misses warble out of time; 
Truant, not recreant to thy sacred claim,
Older by reckoning, but in heart the same,
Freed for a moment from the chains of toil,
I tread once more thy consecrated soil;
Here at thy feet my old allegiance own,
Thy subject still, and loyal to thy throne!

My dazzled glance explores the crowded hall;
Alas, how vain to hope the smiles of all! 
I know my audience. All the gay and young
Love the light antics of a playful tongue;
And these, remembering some expansive line
My lips let loose among the nuts and wine,
Are all impatience till the opening pun
Proclaims the witty shamfight is begun. 
Two fifths at least, if not the total half,
Have come infuriate for an earthquake laugh;
I know full well what alderman has tied
His red bandanna tight about his side;
I see the mother, who, aware that boys
Perform their laughter with superfluous noise,
Beside her kerchief brought an extra one
To stop the explosions of her bursting son;
I know a tailor, once a friend of mine,
Expects great doings in the button line, 
For mirths concussions rip the outward case,
And plant the stitches in a tenderer place. 
I know my audience, these shall have their due;
A smile awaits them ere my song is through!

I know myself. Not servile for applause,
My Muse permits no deprecating clause;
Modest or vain, she will not be denied
One bold confession due to honest pride;
And well she knows the drooping veil of song
Shall save her boldness from the cavillers wrong. 
Her sweeter voice the Heavenly Maid imparts
To tell the secrets of our aching hearts
For this, a suppliant, captive, prostrate, bound,
She kneels imploring at the feet of sound;
For this, convulsed in thoughts maternal pains,
She loads her arms with rhymes resounding chains;
Faint though the music of her fetters be,
It lends one charm, her lips are ever free!

Think not I come, in manhoods fiery noon,
To steal his laurels from the stage buffoon;
His sword of lath the harlequin may wield;
Behold the star upon my lifted shield
Though the just critic pass my humble name,
And sweeter lips have drained the cup of fame,
While my gay stanza pleased the banquets lords,
The soul within was tuned to deeper chords! 
Say, shall my arms, in other conflicts taught
To swing aloft the ponderous mace of thought,
Lift, in obedience to a school-girls law,
Mirths tinsel wand or laughters tickling straw? 
Say, shall I wound with satires rankling spear
The pure, warm hearts that bid me welcome here? 
No! while I wander through the land of dreams,
To strive with great and play with trifling themes,
Let some kind meaning fill the varied line. 
You have your judgment; will you trust to mine?



Between two breaths what crowded mysteries lie, 
The first short gasp, the last and long-drawn sigh! 
Like phantoms painted on the magic slide,
Forth from the darkness of the past we glide,
As living shadows for a moment seen
In airy pageant on the eternal screen,
Traced by a ray from one unchanging flame,
Then seek the dust and stillness whence we came.

But whence and why, our trembling souls inquire,
Caught these dim visions their awakening fire? 
Oh, who forgets when first the piercing thought
Through childhoods musings found its way unsought? 
I am; I live. The mystery and the fear
When the dread question, what has brought me here? 
Burst through lifes twilight, as before the sun
Roll the deep thunders of the morning gun!

Are angel faces, silent and serene,
Bent on the conflicts of this little scene,
Whose dream-like efforts, whose unreal strife,
Are but the preludes to a larger life?

Or does lifes summer see the end of all,
These leaves of being mouldering as they fall,
As the old poet vaguely used to deem,
As WESLEY questioned in his youthful dream? 
Oh, could such mockery reach our souls indeed,
Give back the Pharaohs or the Athenians creed;
Better than this a Heaven of mans device, 
The Indians sports, the Moslems paradise!

Or is our beings only end and aim
To add new glories to our Makers name,
As the poor insect, shrivelling in the blaze,
Lends a faint sparkle to its streaming rays? 
Does earth send upward to the Eternals ear
The mingled discords of her jarring sphere
To swell his anthem, while creation rings
With notes of anguish from its shattered strings? 
Is it for this the immortal Artist means
These conscious, throbbing, agonized machines?

Dark is the soul whose sullen creed can bind
In chains like these the all-embracing Mind;
No! two-faced bigot, thou dost ill reprove
The sensual, selfish, yet benignant Jove,
And praise a tyrant throned in lonely pride,
Who loves himself, and cares for naught beside;
Who gave thee, summoned from primeval night,
A thousand laws, and not a single right, 
A heart to feel, and quivering nerves to thrill,
The sense of wrong, the death-defying will;
Who girt thy senses with this goodly frame,
Its earthly glories and its orbs of flame,
Not for thyself, unworthy of a thought,
Poor helpless victim of a life unsought,
But all for him, unchanging and supreme,
The heartless centre of thy frozen scheme.

Trust not the teacher with his lying scroll,
Who tears the charter of thy shuddering soul;
All living dust in all its varied forms,
Asks not the tribute of a world like this
To fill the measure of his perfect bliss. 
Though winged with life through all its radiant shores,
Creation flowed with unexhausted stores
Cherub and seraph had not yet enjoyed;
For this he called thee from the quickening void! 
Nor this alone; a larger gift was thine,
A mightier purpose swelled his vast design
Thought, conscience, will,  to make them all thine own,
He rent a pillar from the eternal throne!

Made in his image, thou must nobly dare
The thorny crown of sovereignty to share. 
With eye uplifted, it is thine to view,
From thine own centre, Heavens oerarching blue;
So round thy heart a beaming circle lies
No fiend can blot, no hypocrite disguise;
From all its orbs one cheering voice is heard,
Full to thine ear it bears the Fathers word,
Now, as in Eden where his first-born trod
Think not too meanly of thy low estate;
Thou hast a choice; to choose is to create! 
Remember whose the sacred lips that tell,
Angels approve thee when thy choice is well;
Remember, One, a judge of righteous men,
Swore to spare Sodom if she held but ten! 
Use well the freedom which thy Master gave,
(Thinkst thou that Heaven can tolerate a slave?)
And He who made thee to be just and true
Will bless thee, love thee, ay, respect thee too!

Nature has placed thee on a changeful tide,
To breast its waves, but not without a guide;
Yet, as the needle will forget its aim,
Jarred by the fury of the electric flame,
As the true current it will falsely feel,
Warped from its axis by a freight of steel;
So will thy conscience lose its balanced truth
If passions lightning fall upon thy youth,
So the pure effluence quit its sacred hold
Girt round too deeply with magnetic gold. 
Go to yon tower, where busy science plies
Her vast antennae, feeling through the skies
That little vernier on whose slender lines
The midnight taper trembles as it shines,
A silent index, tracks the planets march
In all their wanderings through the ethereal arch;
Tells through the mist where dazzled Mercury burns,
And marks the spot where Uranus returns. 
So, till by wrong or negligence effaced,
The living index which thy Maker traced
Repeats the line each starry Virtue draws
Through the wide circuit of creations laws;
Still tracks unchanged the everlasting ray
Where the dark shadows of temptation stray,
But, once defaced, forgets the orbs of light,
And leaves thee wandering oer the expanse of night.

œWhat is thy creed? a hundred lips inquire;
Nor ask they idly, for uncounted lies
Float upward on the smoke of sacrifice;
When mans first incense rose above the plain,
Of earths two altars one was built by Cain! 
Uncursed by doubt, our earliest creed we take;
We love the precepts for the teachers sake;
The simple lessons which the nursery taught
Fell soft and stainless on the buds of thought,
And the full blossom owes its fairest hue
To those sweet tear-drops of affections dew. 
Too oft the light that led our earlier hours
Fades with the perfume of our cradle flowers;
The clear, cold question chills to frozen doubt;
Tired of beliefs, we dread to live without
Oh then, if Reason waver at thy side,
Let humbler Memory be thy gentle guide;
Go to thy birthplace, and, if faith was there,
Repeat thy fathers creed, thy mothers prayer!

Faith loves to lean on Times destroying arm,
And age, like distance, lends a double charm;
In dim cathedrals, dark with vaulted gloom,
What holy awe invests the saintly tomb! 
There pride will bow, and anxious care expand,
And creeping avarice come with open hand;
The gay can weep, the impious can adore,
From morns first glimmerings on the chancel floor
Till dying sunset sheds his crimson stains
Through the faint halos of the irised panes. 
Yet there are graves, whose rudely-shapen sod
Bears the fresh footprints where the sexton trod;
Graves where the verdure has not dared to shoot,
Where the chance wild-flower has not fixed its root,
Whose slumbering tenants, dead without a name,
The eternal record shall at length proclaim
Pure as the holiest in the long array
Of hooded, mitred, or tiaraed clay!

Come, seek the air; some pictures we may gain
Whose passing shadows shall not be in vain;
Not from the scenes that crowd the strangers soil,
Not from our own amidst the stir of toil,
But when the Sabbath brings its kind release,
And Care lies slumbering on the lap of Peace.

The air is hushed, the street is holy ground;
Hark! The sweet bells renew their welcome sound
As one by one awakes each silent tongue,
It tells the turret whence its voice is flung. 
The Chapel, last of sublunary things
That stirs our echoes with the name of Kings,
Whose bell, just glistening from the font and forge,
Rolled its proud requiem for the second George,
Solemn and swelling, as of old it rang,
Flings to the wind its deep, sonorous clang;
The simpler pile, that, mindful of the hour
When Howes artillery shook its half-built tower,
Wears on its bosom, as a bride might do,
The iron breastpin which the œRebels threw,
Wakes the sharp echoes with the quivering thrill
Of keen vibrations, tremulous and shrill;
Aloft, suspended in the mornings fire,
Crash the vast cymbals from the Southern spire;
The Giant, standing by the elm-clad green,
His white lance lifted oer the silent scene,
Whirling in air his brazen goblet round,
Swings from its brim the swollen floods of sound;
While, sad with memories of the olden time,
Throbs from his tower the Northern Minstrels chime, 
Faint, single tones, that spell their ancient song,
But tears still follow as they breathe along.

Child of the soil, whom fortune sends to range
Where man and nature, faith and customs change,
Borne in thy memory, each familiar tone
Mourns on the winds that sigh in every zone. 
When Ceylon sweeps thee with her perfumed breeze
Through the warm billows of the Indian seas;
When ship and shadow blended both in one 
Flames oer thy mast the equatorial sun,
From sparkling midnight to refulgent noon
Thy canvas swelling with the still monsoon;
When through thy shrouds the wild tornado sings,
And thy poor sea-bird folds her tattered wings, 
Oft will delusion oer thy senses steal,
And airy echoes ring the Sabbath peal
Then, dim with grateful tears, in long array
Rise the fair town, the island-studded bay,
Home, with its smiling board, its cheering fire,
The half-choked welcome of the expecting sire,
The mothers kiss, and, still if aught remain,
Our whispering hearts shall aid the silent strain. 
Ah, let the dreamer oer the taffrail lean
To muse unheeded, and to weep unseen;
Fear not the tropics dews, the evenings chills,
His heart lies warm among his triple hills!

Turned from her path by this deceitful gleam,
My wayward fancy half forgets her theme. 
See through the streets that slumbered in repose
The living current of devotion flows,
Its varied forms in one harmonious band
Age leading childhood by its dimpled hand;
Want, in the robe whose faded edges fall
To tell of rags beneath the tartan shawl;
And wealth, in silks that, fluttering to appear,
Lift the deep borders of the proud cashmere. 
See, but glance briefly, sorrow-worn and pale,
Those sunken cheeks beneath the widows veil;
Alone she wanders where with him she trod,
While other doublets deviate here and there,
What secret handcuff binds that pretty pair? 
Compactest couple! pressing side to side, 
Ah, the white bonnet that reveals the bride! 
By the white neckcloth, with its straitened tie,
The sober hat, the Sabbath-speaking eye,
Severe and smileless, he that runs may read
The stern disciple of Genevas creed
Decent and slow, behold his solemn march;
Silent he enters through yon crowded arch. 
A livelier bearing of the outward man,
The light-hued gloves, the undevout rattan,
Now smartly raised or half profanely twirled, 
A bright, fresh twinkle from the week-day world, 
Tell their plain story; yes, thine eyes behold
Down the chill street that curves in gloomiest shade
What marks betray yon solitary maid? 
The cheeks red rose that speaks of balmier air,
The Celtic hue that shades her braided hair,
The gilded missal in her kerchief tied, 
Poor Nora, exile from Killarneys side! 
Sister in toil, though blanched by colder skies,
That left their azure in her downcast eyes,
See pallid Margaret, Labors patient child,
Scarce weaned from home, the nursling of the wild,
Where white Katahdin oer the horizon shines,
And broad Penobscot dashes through the pines. 
Still, as she hastes, her careful fingers hold
The unfailing hymn-book in its cambric fold. 
Six days at drudgerys heavy wheel she stands,
The seventh sweet morning folds her weary hands. 
Yes, child of suffering, thou mayst well be sure
He who ordained the Sabbath loves the poor!

This weekly picture faithful Memory draws,
Nor claims the noisy tribute of applause;
Faint is the glow such barren hopes can lend,
And frail the line that asks no loftier end. 
Trust me, kind listener, I will yet beguile
Thy saddened features of the promised smile. 
This magic mantle thou must well divide,
It has its sable and its ermine side;
Yet, ere the lining of the robe appears,
Take thou in silence what I give in tears.

Dear listening soul, this transitory scene
Of murmuring stillness, busily serene, 
This solemn pause, the breathing-space of man,
The halt of toils exhausted caravan, 
Comes sweet with music to thy wearied ear;
Rise with its anthems to a holier sphere!

Deal meekly, gently, with the hopes that guide
The lowliest brother straying from thy side
If right, they bid thee tremble for thine own;

What though the champions of thy faith esteem
The sprinkled fountain or baptismal stream;
Shall jealous passions in unseemly strife
Cross their dark weapons oer the waves of life?

Let my free soul, expanding as it can,
Leave to his scheme the thoughtful Puritan;
But Calvins dogma shall my lips deride? 
In that stern faith my angel Mary died;
Or ask if mercys milder creed can save,
Sweet sister, risen from thy new-made grave?

True, the harsh founders of thy church reviled
That ancient faith, the trust of Erins child;
Must thou be raking in the crumbled past
For racks and fagots in her teeth to cast? 
See from the ashes of Helvetias pile
The whitened skull of old Servetus smile! 
Round her young heart thy œRomish Upas threw
Its firm, deep fibres, strengthening as she grew;
Thy sneering voice may call them œPopish tricks,
Her Latin prayers, her dangling crucifix,
But De Profundis blessed her fathers grave,
That œidol cross her dying mother gave! 
What if some angel looks with equal eyes
On her and thee, the simple and the wise,
Writes each dark fault against thy brighter creed,
And drops a tear with every foolish bead! 
Grieve, as thou must, oer historys reeking page;
Blush for the wrongs that stain thy happier age;
Strive with the wanderer from the better path,
Bearing thy message meekly, not in wrath;
Weep for the frail that err, the weak that fall,
Have thine own faith, but hope and pray for all!

Faith; Conscience; Love. A meaner task remains,
And humbler thoughts must creep in lowlier strains. 
Shalt thou be honest? Ask the worldly schools,
And all will tell thee knaves are busier fools;
Prudent? Industrious? Let not modern pens
Instruct œPoor Richards fellow-citizens.

Be firm! One constant element in luck
Is genuine solid old Teutonic pluck. 
See yon tall shaft; it felt the earthquakes thrill,
Clung to its base, and greets the sunrise still.

Stick to your aim: the mongrels hold will slip,
But only crowbars loose the bulldogs grip;
Small as he looks, the jaw that never yields
Drags down the bellowing monarch of the fields!

Yet in opinions look not always back, 
Your wake is nothing, mind the coming track;
Leave what youve done for what you have to do;
Dont be œconsistent, but be simply true.

Dont catch the fidgets; you have found your place
Just in the focus of a nervous race,
Fretful to change and rabid to discuss,
Full of excitements, always in a fuss. 
Think of the patriarchs; then compare as men
These lean-cheeked maniacs of the tongue and pen! 
Run, if you like, but try to keep your breath;
Work like a man, but dont be worked to death;
And with new notions, let me change the rule, 
Dont strike the iron till it s slightly cool.

Choose well your set; our feeble nature seeks
The aid of clubs, the countenance of cliques;
And with this object settle first of all
Your weight of metal and your size of ball. 
Track not the steps of such as hold you cheap,
Too mean to prize, though good enough to keep;
The œreal, genuine, no-mistake Tom Thumbs
Are little people fed on great mens crumbs. 
Yet keep no followers of that hateful brood
That basely mingles with its wholesome food
The tumid reptile, which, the poet said,
Doth wear a precious jewel in his head.

If the wild filly, œProgress, thou wouldst ride,
Have young companions ever at thy side;
But wouldst thou stride the stanch old mare, œSuccess,
Go with thine elders, though they please thee less. 
Shun such as lounge through afternoons and eves,
And on thy dial write, œBeware of thieves!
Felon of minutes, never taught to feel
The worth of treasures which thy fingers steal,
Pick my left pocket of its silver dime,
But spare the right, it holds my golden time!

Does praise delight thee? Choose some ultra side, 
A sure old recipe, and often tried;
Be its apostle, congressman, or bard,
Spokesman or jokesman, only drive it hard;
But know the forfeit which thy choice abides,
For on two wheels the poor reformer rides, 
One black with epithets the anti throws,
One white with flattery painted by the pros.

Though books on MANNERS are not out of print,
An honest tongue may drop a harmless hint. 
Stop not, unthinking, every friend you meet,
To spin your wordy fabric in the street;
While you are emptying your colloquial pack,
The fiend Lumbago jumps upon his back. 
Nor cloud his features with the unwelcome tale
Of how he looks, if haply thin and pale;
Health is a subject for his child, his wife,
And the rude office that insures his life. 
Look in his face, to meet thy neighbors soul,
Not on his garments, to detect a hole;
œHow to observe is what thy pages show,
Pride of thy sex, Miss Harriet Martineau! 
Oh, what a precious book the one would be
That taught observers what they re not to see!

I tell in verse t were better done in prose 
One curious trick that everybody knows;
Once form this habit, and its very strange
How long it sticks, how hard it is to change. 
Two friendly people, both disposed to smile,
Who meet, like others, every little while,
Instead of passing with a pleasant bow,
And œHow d ye do? or œHow s your uncle now?

Impelled by feelings in their nature kind,
But slightly weak and somewhat undefined,
Rush at each other, make a sudden stand,
Begin to talk, expatiate, and expand;
Each looks quite radiant, seems extremely struck,
Their meeting so was such a piece of luck;
Each thinks the other thinks he s greatly pleased
To screw the vice in which they both are squeezed;
So there they talk, in dust, or mud, or snow,
Both bored to death, and both afraid to go! 
Your hat once lifted, do not hang your fire,
Nor, like slow Ajax, fighting still, retire;
When your old castor on your crown you clap,
Go off; youve mounted your percussion cap.

Some words on language may be well applied,
And take them kindly, though they touch your pride. 
Words lead to things; a scale is more precise, 
Coarse speech, bad grammar, swearing, drinking, vice. 
Our cold Northeasters icy fetter clips
The native freedom of the Saxon lips;
See the brown peasant of the plastic South,
How all his passions play about his mouth! 
With us, the feature that transmits the soul,
A frozen, passive, palsied breathing-hole. 
The crampy shackles of the ploughboys walk
Tie the small muscles when he strives to talk;
Not all the pumice of the polished town
Can smooth this roughness of the barnyard down;
Rich, honored, titled, he betrays his race
By this one mark, hes awkward in the face; 
Natures rude impress, long before he knew
The sunny street that holds the sifted few. 
It cant be helped, though, if were taken young,
We gain some freedom of the lips and tongue;
But school and college often try in vain
To break the padlock of our boyhoods chain
One stubborn word will prove this axiom true, 
No quondam rustic can enunciate view.

A few brief stanzas may be well employed
To speak of errors we can all avoid. 
Learning condemns beyond the reach of hope
The careless lips that speak of soap for soap;
Her edict exiles from her fair abode
The clownish voice that utters road for road
Less stern to him who calls his coat a coat,
And steers his boat, believing it a boat,
She pardoned one, our classic citys boast,
Who said at Cambridge most instead of most,
But knit her brows and stamped her angry foot
To hear a Teacher call a root a root.

Once more: speak clearly, if you speak at all;
Carve every word before you let it fall;
Dont, like a lecturer or dramatic star,
Try over-hard to roll the British R;
Do put your accents in the proper spot;
Dont, let me beg you, dont say œHow? for œWhat?
And when you stick on conversations burs,
Dont strew your pathway with those dreadful urs.

From little matters let us pass to less,
And lightly touch the mysteries of dress;
The outward forms the inner man reveal, 
We guess the pulp before we cut the peel.

I leave the broadcloth, coats and all the rest, 
The dangerous waistcoat, called by cockneys œvest,
The things named œpants in certain documents,
A word not made for gentlemen, but œgents;
One single precept might the whole condense
Be sure your tailor is a man of sense;
But add a little care, a decent pride,
And always err upon the sober side.

Three pairs of boots one pair of feet demands,
If polished daily by the owners hands;
If the dark menials visit save from this,
Have twice the number, for he ll sometimes miss. 
One pair for critics of the nicer sex,
Close in the insteps clinging circumflex,
Long, narrow, light; the Gallic boot of love,
A kind of cross between a boot and glove. 
Compact, but easy, strong, substantial, square,
Let native art compile the medium pair. 
The third remains, and let your tasteful skill
Here show some relics of affection still;
Let no stiff cowhide, reeking from the tan,
No rough caoutchoue, no deformed brogan,
Disgrace the tapering outline of your feet,
Though yellow torrents gurgle through the street.

Wear seemly gloves; not black, nor yet too light,
And least of all the pair that once was white;
Let the dead party where you told your loves
Bury in peace its dead bouquets and gloves;
Shave like the goat, if so your fancy bids,
But be a parent, dont neglect your kids.

Have a good hat; the secret of your looks
Lives with the beaver in Canadian brooks;
Virtue may flourish in an old cravat,
But man and nature scorn the shocking hat. 
Does beauty slight you from her gay abodes? 
Like bright Apollo, you must take to Rhoades, 
Mount the new castor, ice itself will melt;
Boots, gloves, may fail; the hat is always felt.

Be shy of breastpins; plain, well-ironed white,
With small pearl buttons, two of them in sight, 
Is always genuine, while your gems may pass,
Though real diamonds, for ignoble glass. 
But spurn those paltry Cisatlantic lies
That round his breast the shabby rustic ties;
Breathe not the name profaned to hallow things
The indignant laundress blushes when she brings!

Our freeborn race, averse to every check,
Has tossed the yoke of Europe from its neck;
From the green prairie to the sea-girt town,
The whole wide nation turns its collars down. 
The stately neck is manhoods manliest part;
It takes the life-blood freshest from the heart. 
With short, curled ringlets close around it spread,
How light and strong it lifts the Grecian head! 
Thine, fair Erechtheus of Minervas wall;
Or thine, young athlete of the Louvres hall,
Smooth as the pillar flashing in the sun
That filled the arena where thy wreaths were won,
Firm as the band that clasps the antlered spoil
Strained in the winding anacondas coil
I spare the contrast; it were only kind
To be a little, nay, intensely blind. 
Choose for yourself: I know it cuts your ear;
I know the points will sometimes interfere;
I know that often, like the filial John,
Whom sleep surprised with half his drapery on,
You show your features to the astonished town
With one side standing and the other down; 
But, O, my friend! my favorite fellow-man! 
If Nature made you on her modern plan,
Sooner than wander with your windpipe bare, 
The fruit of Eden ripening in the air, 
With that lean head-stalk, that protruding chin,
Wear standing collars, were they made of tin! 
And have a neckcloth by the throat of Jove! 
Cut from the funnel of a rusty stove!

The long-drawn lesson narrows to its close,
Chill, slender, slow, the dwindled current flows;
Tired of the ripples on its feeble springs,
Once more the Muse unfolds her upward wings.

Land of my birth, with this unhallowed tongue,
Thy hopes, thy dangers, I perchance had sung;
But who shall sing, in brutal disregard
Of all the essentials of the œnative bard? 
Lake, sea, shore, prairie, forest, mountain, fall,
His eye omnivorous must devour them all;
The tallest summits and the broadest tides
His foot must compass with its giant strides,
Where Ocean thunders, where Missouri rolls,
And tread at once the tropics and the poles;
His food all forms of earth, fire, water, air,
His home all space, his birthplace everywhere.

Some grave compatriot, having seen perhaps
The pictured page that goes in Worcesters Maps,
And, read in earnest what was said in jest,
œWho drives fat oxen please to add the rest, 
Sprung the odd notion that the poets dreams
Grow in the ratio of his hills and streams;
And hence insisted that the aforesaid œbard,
Pink of the future, fancys pattern-card,
The babe of nature in the œgiant West,
Must be of course her biggest and her best.

Oh! when at length the expected bard shall come,
Land of our pride, to strike thine echoes dumb,
(And many a voice exclaims in prose and rhyme,
Its getting late, and hes behind his time,)
When all thy mountains clap their hands in joy,
And all thy cataracts thunder, œThat s the boy, 
Say if with him the reign of song shall end,
And Heaven declare its final dividend!

Becalm, dear brother! whose impassioned strain
Comes from an alley watered by a drain;
The little Mincio, dribbling to the Po,
Beats all the epics of the Hoang Ho;
If loved in earnest by the tuneful maid,
Dont mind their nonsense, never be afraid!

The nurse of poets feeds her winged brood
By common firesides, on familiar food;
In a low hamlet, by a narrow stream,
Where bovine rustics used to doze and dream,
She filled young Williams fiery fancy full,
While old John Shakespeare talked of beeves and wool!

No Alpine needle, with its climbing spire,
Brings down for mortals the Promethean fire,
If careless nature have forgot to frame
An altar worthy of the sacred flame. 
Unblest by any save the goatherds lines,
Mont Blanc rose soaring through his œsea of pines;
In vain the rivers from their ice-caves flash;
No hymn salutes them but the Ranz des Vaches,
Till lazy Coleridge, by the mornings light,
Gazed for a moment on the fields of white,
And lo! the glaciers found at length a tongue,
Mont Blanc was vocal, and Chamouni sung!

Children of wealth or want, to each is given
One spot of green, and all the blue of heaven! 
Enough if these their outward shows impart;
The rest is thine, the scenery of the heart.

If passions hectic in thy stanzas glow,
Thy hearts best life-blood ebbing as they flow;
If with thy verse thy strength and bloom distil,
Drained by the pulses of the fevered thrill;
If sounds sweet effluence polarize thy brain,
And thoughts turn crystals in thy fluid strain, 
Nor rolling ocean, nor the prairies bloom,
Nor streaming cliffs, nor rayless caverns gloom,
Needst thou, young poet, to inform thy line;
Thy own broad signet stamps thy song divine! 
Let others gaze where silvery streams are rolled,
And chase the rainbow for its cup of gold;
To thee all landscapes wear a heavenly dye,
Changed in the glance of thy prismatic eye;
Nature evoked thee in sublimer throes,
For thee her inmost Arethusa flows,"­
The mighty mothers living depths are stirred,"­
Thou art the starred Osiris of the herd!

A few brief lines; they touch on solemn chords,
And hearts may leap to hear their honest words;
Yet, ere the jarring bugle-blast is blown,
The softer lyre shall breathe its soothing tone.

New England! proudly may thy children claim
Their honored birthright by its humblest name
Cold are thy skies, but, ever fresh and clear,
No rank malaria stains thine atmosphere;
No fungous weeds invade thy scanty soil,
Scarred by the ploughshares of unslumbering toil. 
Long may the doctrines by thy sages taught,
Raised from the quarries where their sires have wrought,
Be like the granite of thy rock-ribbed land,"­
As slow to rear, as obdurate to stand;
And as the ice that leaves thy crystal mine
Chills the fierce alcohol in the Creoles wine,
So may the doctrines of thy sober school
Keep the hot theories of thy neighbors cool!

If ever, trampling on her ancient path,
Cankered by treachery or inflamed by wrath,
With smooth œResolves or with discordant cries,
The mad Briareus of disunion rise,
Chiefs of New England! by your sires renown,
Dash the red torches of the rebel down! 
Flood his black hearthstone till its flames expire,
Though your old Sachem fanned his council-fire!

But if at last, her fading cycle run,
The tongue must forfeit what the arm has won,
Then rise, wild Ocean! roll thy surging shock
Full on old Plymouths desecrated rock! 
Scale the proud shaft degenerate hands have hewn,
Where bleeding Valor stained the flowers of June! 
Sweep in one tide her spires and turrets down,
And howl her dirge above Monadnocks crown!

List not the tale; the Pilgrims hallowed shore,
Though strewn with weeds, is granite at the core;
Oh, rather trust that He who made her free
Will keep her true as long as faith shall be! 
Farewell! yet lingering through the destined hour,
Leave, sweet Enchantress, one memorial flower!

An Angel, floating oer the waste of snow
That clad our Western desert, long ago,
(The same fair spirit who, unseen by day,
Shone as a star along the Mayflowers way,)"
Sent, the first herald of the Heavenly plan,
To choose on earth a resting-place for man,"­
Tired with his flight along the unvaried field,
Turned to soar upwards, when his glance revealed
A calm, bright bay enclosed in rocky bounds,
And at its entrance stood three sister mounds.

The Angel spake: œThis threefold hill shall be
The home of Arts, the nurse of Liberty! 
One stately summit from its shaft shall pour
Its deep-red blaze along the darkened shore;
Emblem of thoughts that, kindling far and wide,
In dangers night shall be a nations guide. 
One swelling crest the citadel shall crown,
Its slanted bastions black with battles frown,
And bid the sons that tread its scowling heights
Bare their strong arms for man and all his rights! 
One silent steep along the northern wave
Shall hold the patriarchs and the heros grave;
When fades the torch, when oer the peaceful scene
The embattled fortress smiles in living green,
The cross of Faith, the anchor staff of Hope,
Shall stand eternal on its grassy slope;
There through all time shall faithful Memory tell,
Here Virtue toiled, and Patriot Valor fell;
Thy free, proud fathers slumber at thy side;
Live as they lived, or perish as they died!Legs I have got, yet seldom do I walk;
I backbite many, yet I never talk:
In secret places most I seek to hide me,
For he who feeds me never can abide me. 

I'm wealthy and poor,
I'm empty and full,
I'm humble and proud,
I'm witty and dull.
I'm foul and yet fair:
I'm old, and yet young;
I lie with Moll Kerr,
And toast Mrs. Long. 

I am just two and two, I am warm, I am cold,
And the parent of numbers that cannot be told.
I am lawful, unlawful -- a duty, a fault,
I am often sold dear, good for nothing when bought;
An extraordinary boon, and a matter of course,
The poor have it, the rich need it and if you eat it you'll die. 



Nodding a polite face
On a chilly December evening
It warms you up
Close to your glossy-dull surface
Of your skin, it cuddles up
Through your fingertips
It laces to make a nest in your heart
And claims younger lungs at last
It rings around your face and nose
And seduces you to its addiction close
Its prey your delicate mind becomes 
As after your oxygen it runs
It's the black child of a white father
A wingless bird flying
Even to clouds further
Closer to it you come, you shed tears
Spending for a moment with it
Makes you feel cool and collected
As in ignorant bliss you are left suspended
But the longer the company 
The greater is the chance
To be withered at its hand
Now tell me what it is, my dear friend


This riddle I give to you
Upon it your eyes may view

THAT which eludes this verse and any verse,
   Unheard by sharpest ear, unform'd in clearest eye or cunningest mind,
   Nor lore nor fame, nor happiness nor wealth,
   And yet the pulse of every heart and life throughout the world
         incessantly,
   Which you and I and all pursuing ever ever miss,
   Open but still a secret, the real of the real, an illusion,
   Costless, vouchsafed to each, yet never man the owner,
   Which poets vainly seek to put in rhyme, historians in prose,
   Which sculptor never chisel'd yet, nor painter painted,
   Which vocalist never sung, nor orator nor actor ever utter'd,      Invoking here and now I challenge for my song.

   Indifferently, 'mid public, private haunts, in solitude,
   Behind the mountain and the wood,
   Companion of the city's busiest streets, through the assemblage,
   It and its radiations constantly glide.

   In looks of fair unconscious babes,
   Or strangely in the coffin'd dead,
   Or show of breaking dawn or stars by night,
   As some dissolving delicate film of dreams,
   Hiding yet lingering.                                              Two little breaths of words comprising it.
   Two words, yet all from first to last comprised in it.

   How ardently for it!
   How many ships have sail'd and sunk for it!
   How many travelers started from their homes and ne'er return'd!
   How much of genius boldly staked and lost for it!
   What countless stores of beauty, love, ventur'd for it!
   How all superbest deeds since Time began are traceable to it--and
         shall be to the end!
   How all heroic martyrdoms to it!
   How, justified by it, the horrors, evils, battles of the earth!    How the bright fascinating lambent flames of it, in every age and
         land, have drawn men's eyes,
   Rich as a sunset on the Norway coast, the sky, the islands, and the
         cliffs,
   Or midnight's silent glowing northern lights unreachable.

   The soul for it, and all the visible universe for it,
   And heaven at last for it. 

The true nature of urban life
Full of love and strife
At one place you can feel the both
Saying the truth, taking an oath
Travelling in the bus
You will feel the joy and fuss
Life full of hustle and bustle 
In the bus, you do get tussle
When you get a seat
You sit and smile
You feel the treat
Life looks simple
And surely worthwhile
When you don't get a seat
You feel the heat
Bus gets overloaded
And often crowded
Making your journey miserable
Running fast to keep pace
Use the AC bus advisable
And feel the openness of space
Urban life is not easy
Everyone is a bit busy
With friends, children and wife
The true nature of urban life
A ride on Bus in Delhi
Demonstrated it clearly

eighty words woke up, listened to each other, 
smiled, joined hands, 
danced in a ring

and as they danced around and round
the space inside the circle
became magic
the earth flowed
into a brightness in the air
which in its space
became sound

the words dancing
left a ring in the grass
in the sound of a poem

then returned home
to where words rest
in stillness and in silence
until called upon
to waken fresh


She found his ring 
the other day
where she had put it 
safe, away.

Like a key 
its lock undone
the ring brought memories 
one by one.

‘With this ring’
the preacher read, 
promises given, 
vows were said.

The time was short 
to the ‘death do us’ part
and now his home 
was in her heart.

A single tear fell 
from her eye.
It always did that, 
made her cry.

She kissed the ring, 
tucked it back away
and locked up the memories.  
No more today. 

Julia, I bring 
To thee this Ring. 
Made for thy finger fit; 
To shew by this, 
That our love is 
(Or sho'd be) like to it. 

Close though it be, 
The joynt is free: 
So when Love's yoke is on, 
It must not gall, 
Or fret at all 
With hard oppression. 

But it must play 
Still either way; 
And be, too, such a yoke, 
As not too wide, 
To over-slide; 
Or be so strait to choak. 

So we, who beare, 
The beame, must reare 
Our selves to such a height: 
As that the stay 
Of either may 
Create the burden light. 

And as this round 
Is no where found 
To flaw, or else to sever: 
So let our love 
As endless prove; 
And pure as Gold for ever.{INSPIRED TO WRITE IN THIS FORM AFTER READING

                -July, 

If you don't know the kind of person I am
and I don't know the kind of person you are
a pattern that others made may prevail in the world
and following the wrong god home we may miss our star.

For there is many a small betrayal in the mind,
a shrug that lets the fragile sequence break
sending with shouts the horrible errors of childhood
storming out to play through the broken dyke.

And as elephants parade holding each elephant's tail,
but if one wanders the circus won't find the park,
I call it cruel and maybe the root of all cruelty
to know what occurs but not recognize the fact.

And so I appeal to a voice, to something shadowy,
a remote important region in all who talk:
though we could fool each other, we should consider--
lest the parade of our mutual life get lost in the dark.

For it is important that awake people be awake,
or a breaking line may discourage them back to sleep;
the signals we give--yes or no, or maybe--
should be clear: the darkness around us is deep. 

In Madurai,
city of temples and poets,
who sang of cities and temples,
every summer
a river dries to a trickle
in the sand,
baring the sand ribs,
straw and women's hair
clogging the watergates
at the rusty bars
under the bridges with patches
of repair all over them
the wet stones glistening like sleepy
crocodiles, the dry ones
shaven water-buffaloes lounging in the sun
The poets only sang of the floods.

He was there for a day
when they had the floods.
People everywhere talked
of the inches rising,
of the precise number of cobbled steps
run over by the water, rising
on the bathing places,
and the way it carried off three village houses,
one pregnant woman
and a couple of cows
named Gopi and Brinda as usual.

The new poets still quoted
the old poets, but no one spoke
in verse
of the pregnant woman
drowned, with perhaps twins in her,
kicking at blank walls
even before birth.

He said:
the river has water enough
to be poetic
about only once a year
and then
it carries away
in the first half-hour
three village houses,
a couple of cows
named Gopi and Brinda
and one pregnant woman
expecting identical twins
with no moles on their bodies,
with different coloured diapers
to tell them apart. 

Where does the river flow
if not to you? 

How deep its depths
if these
are not yours? 

How broad is the river bank? 

Broad enough
for the tug-boats
to push my heart along.

If there are fish in the river, 
they sing your name
open-mouthed, 
fish-style, 
making tiny bubbles float
up, up to the river surface
where they pop
spread
announcing to the Firmament
that Love lives just below 
the deep river flows.

Yes, you and  I
are the river; 
we flow, 
run deep
down to that
ocean-mix
in which
our souls
swirl.

Mix me then
in depths deep.

Mix you then
amid this ocean sweep
and all else, 
for me
becomes meaningless
so great
is our Soul Mixed
Ocean Bliss. 

A little island in the river
There is, round which the breezes quiver
Like sweet birds that would stay
A moment on their way,
So green it is with leaves and grass,
And chequered by the clouds that pass
Far over in the blue above:
As sweet with flowers as life with love,
And breathing of a mood
That, like a wild bird in the city's din,
Though far from all its kith and kin,
Sustains its solitude. 

A river of the will, 
Plays in my mind.
I call her to come out, 
But she stays behind.
She flows and says-
O, let me do the thing, 
Which I desire; 
I'm now a spring.
Just telling this, 
She jumps from myself, 
Riding on a cloud, 
She flies like an elf.
With a pensive mood, 
I sit by the window, 
It starts raining outside, 
My room gathers shadow.
I think, where's my will? 
She isn't in the sky-
A whisper comes in my ear, 
I can't believe my eye
The drops of rain fall there, 
Wetting my hot face, 
Tell me-'Dear we are here, 
Giving you cool brace.'
Then go back to the river, 
To be again the cloud, 
To flash with the thunder, 
To roar  aloud

Clouds

In November
They just turn into grief
And pour upon you.
And the road to your nest
And to your heart
Is washed away.

Clouds

They hide everything vile on earth.
Dare not open their hearts
Lest the stain of blood will show.
No one is innocent until proved guilty.

In Lakhimpur, Nellai*
Anywhere
The road in the middle of nowhere
Starts nowhere, ends nowhere.
It is just washed away.
Just washed away.



*Thirunelveli


Take heart
Forget past
See, how days are flowering poetry
Dreams fruitioning reality
The blankness filled
A bridge is built
You are lifted
To this unearthly abode
Where you exist
with your
Soul and friendly souls
There is bliss
Darkness never
visit there
life is 
An ever enchanting Music. 

Here we picked wild strawberries, 
though in my memory we're neither here 
nor missing. Or I'd scuff out 
by myself at dusk, proud 
to be lonely. Now everything's 
in bloom along the road at once: 
tansy mustard, sow thistle, 
fescue, burdock, soapwort, 
the mailbox-high day lilies, 
splurges of chicory with thin, 
ragged, sky-blue flowers. 
Or they're one blue the sky 
can be, and always, not 
varium et mutabile semper, 
restless forever. In memory, 
though memory eats its banks 
like any river, you can carry 
by constant revision 
some loved thing: a stalk of mullein 
shaped like a what's-the-word-for 
a tower of terraced bells, that's it, 
a carillon! A carillon ringing 
its mute changes of pollen into a past 
we must be about to enter, 
the road's so stained by the yellow 
light (same yellow as the tiny 
mullein flowers) we shared 
when we were imminent. 

Right below a grey, cloudy sky, 
A pleasant, soothing breeze
Waltzed throuh a quiet neighborhood, 
Caressing everything that came its way, 
Gently with its soft, loving fingers.
A stray dog slept blissfully on a bed of sand.
A tough, hardy bougainvillea plant twined itself, 
Greedily, hungrily, around the torso of a bare, horny tree; 
While its bright red flowers looked on, embarassed, their faces flushed, innocent eyes turned upwards, 
At a grey, cloudy sky


Want to you is strange, passion you know not yet
unlike man, you enjoy your life
and the best it offers- a cocoon of melodious note, 
kept afresh by the order which keeps the falling rock
abreast. 

you sing and sing even for no reason
but simply because you are feeling
and feel really happy. 

on land the haunt of profit
and fame and  where people in worldly careers
wander and lose the road, mood created by your songs
which turns the natural hours into melody, 
few people are aware and fewer relish your song
in its purity for the difference is not in your voice
but in the listeners'heart. 

A wee bit'o fun, this one wuz'! 
Hope y'u enjoy it too.  



R



I never gather moss
Tho'some call me dross
I'm taken by surprise
by so many who drive 
Past my roughshod land
Made of concreted sand
N', in a blink of an eye
Or a rumble from the sky
I can quickly take roll
As if I'm aiming to bowl
'N with no warning sign
I'll strike like a lion
'N with no sense of care
I'll pounce like a bear
as you bristle in prayer
So, do you know who I am
My ancestors made gems
Over hundreds of years
Pressed tightly, I hear
Into diamonds as bright
As a comet in the nite
Give up? I bet you do
So, I'll simply tell you
I am the Rock on the top
Of a mountain of others
I'll be the first to drop
On past all my brothers
I'm the one who decides
the very next rockslide
So all cars be on alert
I gave you fair warning
If you see falling dirt
A rockslide be dawning
With me leading the way
Go ahead, make my day! 




RTHE sun-browned girl, whose limbs recline
When noon her languid hand has laid
Hot on the green flakes of the pine,
Beneath its narrow disk of shade;

As, through the flickering noontide glare,
She gazes on the rainbow chain
Of arches, lifting once in air
The rivers of the Roman's plain;--

Say, does her wandering eye recall
The mountain-current's icy wave,--
Or for the dead one tear let fall,
Whose founts are broken by their grave?

From stone to stone the ivy weaves
Her braided tracery's winding veil,
And lacing stalks and tangled leaves
Nod heavy in the drowsy gale.

And lightly floats the pendent vine,
That swings beneath her slender bow,
Arch answering arch,--whose rounded line
Seems mirrored in the wreath below.

How patient Nature smiles at Fame!
The weeds, that strewed the victor's way,
Feed on his dust to shroud his name,
Green where his proudest towers decay.

See, through that channel, empty now,
The scanty rain its tribute pours,--
Which cooled the lip and laved the brow
Of conquerors from a hundred shores.

Thus bending o'er the nation's bier,
Whose wants the captive earth supplied,
The dew of Memory's passing tear
Falls on the arches of her pride!(In a Museum) 
How an image of paint and wood 
Leaped to her life with a love's control, 
Struck the chords of her motherhood, 
Passionate little mother-soul! 
Fair to her sight were the stolid eyes, 
Dear to her toil the robes empearled. 
She crooned it the ancient lullabies, 
She gathered it close from the outer world. 
They watched together, as Nero's pyres 
Fed the haze of a hundred fires. 

Me in her fresh young arms she bore. 
See, I am small, 
Only a doll. 
But I keep her kiss forevermore. 

Long and lonely the toy has lain. 
One by one into time's abyss 
Years have dropped as the drops of rain. 
Yet the cycles have left us this! 
O red-lipped mother, O mother sweet, 
Today a sister has heard you call, 
I saw her weep o'er the crumbling doll. 
She knew, she knew! You had lived and smiled! 
You had loved your dream, little Roman child! 

Me in her fresh young arms she bore. 
See, I am small, 
Only a doll. 
But I keep her kiss forevermore. 

I.
In the cave which wild weeds cover
Wait for thine aethereal lover;
For the pallid moon is waning,
O'er the spiral cypress hanging
And the moon no cloud is staining.

II.
It was once a Roman’s chamber,
Where he kept his darkest revels,
And the wild weeds twine and clamber;
It was then a chasm for devils. 

An English youth to Canada came,
A labourer, John Roe by name;
His little wealth had made him bold-
Twenty sovereigns in gold,
He was industrious and wise,
And e'en small sums did not despise ;
He added to his wealth each year,
For independence he loved dear.
He knew a labourer he would be
Forever, in the old country ;
His forefathers had tilled the ground
And never one had saved a pound ;
On beds of down they did not lie,
And frugally their goods did buy,
Their one luxury around the door 
A few choice flowers their garden bore ;
But never hoped to own the soil, 
But serve as hinds to sweat and toil. 
To work and toil, for him had charm, 
He hoped, some day, to own a farm ;
So he hired with Rueben Tripp, 
The wealthiest man in the township.
Tripp's only child, his daughter Jane, 
He sought her love, and not in vain ; 
As Jacob served for Rachel, dear,
So John he served, year after year-
Till, rich enough to buy bush farm 
For to chop down with his strong arm.

The truest nobleman of all, 
He lives not in ancestral hall,
But sheltereth family from harm
By logs rolled up with his strong arms
In this young glorious land, so free, 
Where each may rear his own roof tree ;
And the chief glory of old days, 
Broad fire place, where big logs did blaze-
As much as two strong men could handle-
They served alike for heat and candle. 
He his young oxen did adorn 
With fine gay ribbons on each horn, 
And to his home with joy and pride
he did bring sweet, blooming bride
Such happiness is seldom seen,
She helped him in the fields to reap,
And span the wool from off their sheep,
And from the yarn she wove the cloth,
All they required, they had for both, 
And she was a good tailoress-
Did make his coat and her own dress.
The golden butter that she made
Was of the very finest grade ;
Each grace and virtue she possess'd-
Where 'ere she was that spot was blessed.
And, though they did not have stove then-
Neither did they own an oven-
She filled large pot with well knead dough
And baked fine bread 'mong embers glow.

He each winter the forest trees
Did quickly hew them down with ease ;
For, he to work had a desire
And the skill did soon acquire ;
But, 'round great giants hewed a ring,
Then storms would soon them prostrate bring
For many a time the furious breeze.
Would quick o'erthrow the girdled trees,
And sometimes they would kill the cows .
When they did feed on grass or brouse.
But after reckoning damage all,
A benefit was each windfall ;-
Though good fortune now he sees
Might have been got from walnut trees.
But trees were foes, in his hurry,
All were slain, both oak and cherry,
And to this day he doth incline
To mourn o'er slaughter of the pine,
And reflects how he did o'erwhelm
Many a maple, beach and elm,
And each summer day did toil,
With his steers, drawing logs in pile.
These giants of the forest dead,
Fire did reduce to an ash bed,
And soon potatoes, wheat and corn,
They did the rugged stumps adorn.
And Jane did help him with the hoe,
And well she did keep up her row-
No organs then they had to play,
But she could work and sing all day.
In spring he did live maples tap,
To draw from them the luscious sap ;
He gathered it in big log trough,
Then boiled it down and sugared off
Enough the household for to cheer,
With all its sweets, for the whole year.
And no such thing those times were seen, 
As the swift raising stump machine,
And where main road was low and damp 
With logs he built a road through swamp. 
But a smooth ride could not enjoy
While it was naught but corduroy-
Each year added earth and gravel, 
Now smoothly o'er they can travel ;
For, it doth make an excellent road
For John and Jane to go abroad,
And it is now a great highway

Where hundreds travel every day.
There were no roads in early days,
But bridal path, their guide the blaze,
And mills and marts so far away
They never could return same day.
Log school house served as church for all
Of various creeds, and for Town Hall.
These scenes to youth do now seem strange,
So wondrous quick hath been the change.
O'er paths where oxen only trod,
Cars quickly speed o'er the railroad,
And every way, both up and down,
There has sprung up a thriving town.
No more he fights with Forest trees,
But both enjoy their wealth and ease.
Long since the old folks both are gone,
And left the whole to Jane and John.
The log house, too, hath passed away
With all its chincks filled in with clay,
And in its place fine house of stone,
With lawn where choice shrubs are grown, 
With sons and daughters they are blest-
The young men say they'll move north-west.
This gives their mother some alarm,
She wants them still on the home farm,
But father will not have them tarry-
They can plow so quick on prairie-
And they find coal makes a good fire
And build their fences of barbed wire ;
They would not be forever gone,
As they could talk by telephone,I'd like to write a romantic comedy
in four acts like Will Shakespeare did
Tragedy's not for me, you can see
by the bells and cap I wear
Clad like a court jester I can
dance and caper
with love as my chief motive

I adore outdoor action
the forest of Arden
populated by the likes
of Rosalind and Celia
Phebe and Audrey
daughters and country wenches

I could idealize a heroine
who usually masks herself
as a man, a swain, one
who deceives and is
deceived in turn

I would subject love to great
difficulty before consummation
in the darkest forests of night
'Amor vincit omnia! '

I would not render poetic justice
any oaf of a writer does that
My outcomes would be logical
& necessary - 
how the characters act based
on their principles

I would balance characters
good guys over here
villains over there
reconciliation would be easy
in my romantic comedies

All's well that ends well
would be the keynote
struck in all its glory
by spooning lovers
Never mind love's labor
lost in a midsummer night's
dream even though all in all
it may be much ado about
nothing
but that's as I like it

Our college rhymes,--how light they seem,
Like little ghosts of love's young dream
That led our boyish hearts away
From lectures and from books, to stray
By flowery mead and flowing stream!

There's nothing here, in form or theme,
Of thought sublime or art supreme:
We would not have the critic weigh
Our college rhymes.

Yet if, perchance, a slender beam
Of feeling's glow or fancy's gleam
Still lingers in the lines we lay
At Alma Mater's feet today,
The touch of Nature may redeem
Our college rhymes. 

I.  
Youre two eyn will sle me sodenly
I may the beaute of them not sustene,
So wendeth it thorowout my herte kene.

 
And but your words will helen hastely
My hertis wound, while that it is grene,
Youre two eyn will sle me sodenly.


Upon my trouth I sey yow feithfully,
That ye ben of my liffe and deth the quene;
For with my deth the trouth shal be sene.
Youre two eyn will sle me sodenly
I may the beaute of them not sustene,
So wendeth it thorowout my herte kene.

II. 
So hath youre beauty fro your herte chased
Pitee, that me n'availeth not to pleyn:
For daunger halt your mercy in his cheyne.

 
Giltless my deth thus have ye purchased;
I sey yow soth, me nedeth not to fayn:
So hath your beaute fro your herte chased.

 
Alas, that nature hath in yow compassed
So grete beaute, that no man may atteyn
To mercy, though he sterve for the peyn.
Youre two eyn will sle me sodenly
I may the beaute of them not sustene,
So wendeth it thorowout my herte kene.

III.  
Syn I fro love escaped am so fat,
I nere thinke to ben in his prison lene;
Syn I am fre, I counte hym not a bene.

 
He may answere and sey this and that, 
I do no fors, I speak ryght as I mene;
Syn I fro love escaped am so fat.


Love hath my name i-strike out of his sclat, 
And he is strike out of my bokes clene:
For ever mo 'ther' is non other mene,
Syn I fro love escaped am so fat. 

Honoring the Prophet

You have occupied a space
in the western mind
for the heavy unfolding of
thirteen hundred years.
I wish I could describe
that space as a room
of such design and building
that it does honor to its
resident, that is replete
with the good will of his life, 
that reflects the sacrifice
and the triumphs of his age.

But alas a believer who has
and carries within his heart
the truth of the Prophet's being
will grieve at the contents 
of that room: it is a space
of fears, doubts, ignorance, 
even outright hatred. I would
refurnish this room in our minds
closer to the heart's truth.
It should be a room of radiance: 
the greatest man displaying the greatest worship. 




The voice that would reach you, Hunter, must speak
in Biblical tones, or in the poetry of Walt Whitman.
You are primitive and modern, simple and complex;
you are one part George Washington and one part Nimrod.
You are the United States,
future invader of our naive America
with its Indian blood, an America

You are strong, proud model of your race;
you are cultured and able; you oppose Tolstoy.
You are an Alexander-Nebuchadnezzar,
breaking horses and murdering tigers.
(You are a Professor of Energy,
as current lunatics say).

You think that life is a fire,
that progress is an irruption,
that the future is wherever
your bullet strikes.
No.

The United States is grand and powerful.
Whenever it trembles, a profound shudder
runs down the enormous backbone of the Andes.
If it shouts, the sound is like the roar of a lion.
And Hugo said to Grant: 'The stars are yours.'
(The dawning sun of the Argentine barely shines;
the star of Chile is rising..) A wealthy country,
joining the cult of Mammon to the cult of Hercules;
while Liberty, lighting the path
to easy conquest, raises her torch in New York.

But our own America, which has had poets
since the ancient times of Nezahualcoyolt;
which preserved the footprint of great Bacchus,
and learned the Panic alphabet once,
and consulted the stars; which also knew Atlantic
(whose name comes ringing down to us in Plato)
and has lived, since the earliest moments of its life,
in light, in fire, in fragrance, and in love--
the America of Moctezuma and Atahualpa,
the aromatic America of Columbus,
Catholic America, Spanish America,
the America where noble Cuauthemoc said:
'I am not in a bed of roses'--our America,
trembling with hurricanes, trembling with Love:
O men with Saxon eyes and barbarous souls,
our America lives. And dreams. And loves.
And it is the daughter of the Sun. Be careful.
Long live Spanish America!
A thousand cubs of the Spanish lion are roaming free.
the deadly Rifleman and the dreadful Hunter
before you can clutch us in your iron claws.

And though you have everything, you are lacking one thing:

Severed from self
It is just
A selfless existence
Of this body
Made up of mere clay

Nomadic thoughts
Your mind loves to create
Untrodden paths
Your feet tend to walk
Unknown words
Your tongue slips to pronounce
Speak with care
You are not allowed
To say
What has not been told to you
Yet

My Love should be fearless
Then
Why all the time I have worries
Of my poor self
My pocket is crying for
The chocolates
My daughter loves to eat
My wife is building a new home
On the graveyard of my old dreams
My shoes have grown a little older too
Like the sadness in my mother’s eyes
I can replace my middle-aged lusterless shoes
With the young ones having a pristine shine
But what should I do
To rejuvenate the marks of happiness
In my mother’s lifeless eyes
And
In my life’s soulless existence

This life is nothing
But a wakeful dream
I was predisposed to live
Then
Why am I rebellious
To my default operating system
I keep on customizing
My intrinsic programming
With an artificial intelligence
Errors and bloopers
And what I get in the end
Is nothing but
A rootless existence


Nov  rose has 
       bloomed so far, 
I get smell, 
       can't see her.

A rose has 
       bloomed so high, 
Nose gets smell, 
       can't see Eye.

Daylight comes, 
       daylight goes; 
Sleepless I 
       love the rose. 

My belief in never worn goodness
seasons my life round service.
from me the bee brews honey and the snake
draws venom, the thorn water, the nightingale
her song and the green-fly her meal. 

as forecast
of season change I scatter
red petal carpet for the gardener, generating
in him an anxiety free mind, embalming all around, even
his pruning shears. 

the artist paints the ripening 
maiden in blossom bath towel and the tomb holds on its chest, 
the fairest funeral flower.


. 

Roses in profusion
bloomed along  our garden wall.
They were both red and yellow-
tea hybrids, I recall.
There were thorns too, 
as I well knew, 
standing guard among the blooms.

A careless creature soon would learn
to give the rose wide berth
An agony of thorns awaits
the careless of the earth.
Yet thorns permit the bees to come
and pollen to transpose.
and, if careful, they'll admit
my own  scent seeking nose


I think thorns serve their purpose well
else roses would be trampled
The thorns are roses' guardians
and not inconsequential.
Without a thorn, the rose, forlorn, 
is destined for the ashes. 

A ROSE-BUD by my early walk,
Adown a corn-enclosed bawk,
Sae gently bent its thorny stalk,
All on a dewy morning.
Ere twice the shades o' dawn are fled,
In a' its crimson glory spread,
And drooping rich the dewy head,
It scents the early morning.


Within the bush her covert nest
A little linnet fondly prest;
The dew sat chilly on her breast,
Sae early in the morning.
She soon shall see her tender brood,
The pride, the pleasure o' the wood,
Amang the fresh green leaves bedew'd,
Awake the early morning.


So thou, dear bird, young Jeany fair,
On trembling string or vocal air,
Shall sweetly pay the tender care
That tents thy early morning.
So thou, sweet Rose-bud, young and gay,
Shalt beauteous blaze upon the day,
And bless the parent's evening ray
That watch'd thy early morning. 

Rose sheds its petals
Its fragrance is no more
The stump stands alone

 rose for my heart to rise with wings
To the heavens deep, where pleasure rings

With bliss as clouds—high silver beings.
The rose's romantic fragrance sings, 

Dear as the tune the nightingale brings.
To my heart's delight, its singing swings.

How my heart to nirvana, it flings.
To the rose, with rapture my heart clings.

In my heart, liveliness outright springs, 
Like the mountain, whose cheerful height slings

To the sky, where the star of day tings.
To my heart, how fay-like the feelings. 

Today I picked a rose for you, 
It seemed the perfect thing to do.
To me the petals represent. 
Unfolding years and time well-spent.
An emblem of our lives in bloom, 
An ever-changing sweet perfume.
Each day to me is just as sweet, 
Here with you on this quiet street.
That old bush has gotten so tall, 
It's half way up the garden wall.
Wasn't too big when it was sown, 
Hard to believe how much it's grown! 
Joseph's Coat: What a colorful name, 
Orange and Yellow with Crimson flame.
A truth so strong, a dream so pure. 
In spite of thorns hope will endure! 
Poetic? Yes, but I suppose, 
That's what I like about a rose. 
A symbol of what's rare and true, 
Today I picked a rose for you. 

A rose has thorns as well as honey, 
I'll not have her for love or money; 
An iris grows so straight and fine, 
That she shall be no friend of mine; 
Snowdrops like the snow would chill me; 
Nightshade would caress and kill me; 
Crocus like a spear would fright me; 
Dragon's-mouth might bark or bite me; 
Convolvulus but blooms to die; 
A wind-flower suggests a sigh; 
Love-lies-bleeding makes me sad; 
And poppy-juice would drive me mad: - 
But give me holly, bold and jolly, 
Honest, prickly, shining holly; 
Pluck me holly leaf and berry 
For the day when I make merry. 

I'm a disgrace to the life
I lived as a girl—
she would be ashamed
to have me in the world.

But there's no turning back; 
it's time to pay the price
for selfish pride
and evil vice.

Or pack up my things
and leave this great earth—
would you put in place
a rose in birth.

Cause thorns I've got
it's the petals I lack; 
beauty should unfold: 
this is no unknown fact.

With this request I must be going—
please all take care, 
boys and girls
handsome and fair. 

A rose is a rose every day, every night
You too are the same, except different in my sight

You are like a rose, such a beautiful creation
But a rose in disguise, meant to blume for every nation

So show your beauty, for I know what you are
You are a rose in disguise, and very, very wise

A rose is a rose is a rose. .. 

I knew a rose without a thorn, 	

		The rarest bloom that grows

	She blossomed, briefly, beautifully, 

	Right there beneath my nose.



	I fear that I will never see		

	 Another bloom as fair, 

		Except in memory, ever green, 

	Her fragrance lingers there


Whenever and however I have to be, 
Not what I feel or can and cannot see, 
Only bringing glory to The Holy Trinity.

Even if there’s pain and suffering in that place, 
I’ll make it through for sufficient is His grace, 
No matter how many trials & tribulations I’ll have to face, 
On the cross at Cavalry my Savior set the pace.


A reason why many answers to prayers are never received? 
There’s no longer a need for the insecurity of our former life.

We now have that right through the creation of our new birth, 
Certainly it does not mean we will always get everything right, 
d Corinthians   that’s why we walk by faith & not by sight.

You are not paranoid because in poetry we seek perfection, 
Always aim to seek His love and endless perfection, 
Otherwise we will only experience defeat and rejection.

However, if you go to Him with a whisper instead of a shout, 
Check in the dictionary for the meanings of "Roundabout", 
Now, ever heard the saying "Who let the dogs out"? 

Computers have a tools button for checking spelling and grammar, 
So later on you won’t feel like beating your head with a hammer, 
You are not digging a ditch just to rearrange a pile of dirt, 
Before posting anything you write, have another check your work.

If someone you never knew gave their life for your redemption & sins, 
Only for the hope of always being together in the Kingdom, Amen, 
Do you say "I’ll praise & give thanks soon as I see you when"? 

The same as He’s already done for you and me, 
Stop being filled with innuendo, excuses and unwarranted prose, 

Arthur  didn't  see  it, 
His  back  was  to  the  sky.
They  looked  to  the  Heavens, 
Expecting  then  to  die.

Arthur  heard  the  shuffle, 
Looked  up  and  turned  around.
By  the  time  he  saw  it, 
The  spaceship  hit  the  ground.

Gigantic  can't  describe
The  ship's  great  size  and  scope.
Crashing  there  before  them, 
They  surely  had  no  hope.

Force  applied  at  impact
Was  equal  to  a  quake.
This  was  it, they  figured.
They  ducked  down  in  its  wake.

Suddenly,  they  saw  them  
Just  flashing  through  the  sky.
Four  and  twenty  dragons.
Oh  boy,  how  they  could  fly! 

Then  they  felt  a  grasping.
How  dragon  claws  can  bend! 
Following  soon  after, 
They  felt  the  forceful  wind.

They  were  their  salvation, 
And  carried  them  away
From  the  flames  and  wreckage
The  spaceship  brought  that  day.

Merlin  and  King  Arthur, 
Two  knights  and  twenty  more  
Gathered  round  a  table
A  tale  not  told  before.

This  one  of  the  dragons  
Heeding  ole  Merlin's  call.
Saving  them  from  spaceships
Whenever  they  might  fall.

Yes,  a  tale  remembered.
One  told  for  many  years.
One  often  forgotten  
But  true,  it  now  appears.

You  might  have  a  question, 
The  modern  ones  like  you.
What  becomes  of  spaceships
That  fall  out  of  the  blue? 

Not  as  complicated, 
Though  some  might  think  it  so.
Eating  little  bodies  
Are  dragon  things,  you  know.

As  for  all  the  hardware.
They  flew  all  that  away.
The  dragons  dropped  it  all  
Into  Loch  Ness,  they  say.

But  if  you  still  may  doubt  
The  tale  that  I  have  told, 
Go  and  see  the  marker  
That  Arthur  made  so  bold.

Marking  where  the  dragons
Plucked  Arthur  up  that  day.
Where  they  grabbed  ole  Merlin
And  flew  him  quick  away.

Now  you  know  the  story, 
One  unknown  answered  here.
Stonehenge  is  the  marker  
That  Arthur  made  that  year. 

A Route of Evanescence
With a revolving Wheel--
A Resonance of Emerald--
A Rush of Cochineal--
And every Blossom on the Bush
Adjusts its tumbled Head--
The mail from Tunis, probably,
An easy Morning's Ride--They were a Roving Band of Lovers
kissing hands
smiling and winking.

They bowed to old ladies on the streets
over-tipped waiters
gave young girls flowers
for no reason.

They never cried; 
stood on tip-toe
and invited people
to see Infinity; 
did dances in the streets
and little plays in the subways; 

carried around little cookie trays
made music with harmonicas.

They were a Little Band of Roving Lovers
who made strangers
the Stars
of little Street Plays
asking
'Madam who would you like to be
a star? an astronaut, a great leader? 
and then they would produce the prop
and act the play
where instantly
the dream would be
and street stranger
would miraculously
become the Dream They Had Dreamed.
while others looked on.

Singers
bad, good or worse
had the audience to join in 
and all songs sound good when sung in crowds.

For True Love's Wish
they produced a Satin Heart
which they passed round the crowd
where each person gave the heart
a tiny touch; 

assuring that True Love would come 
in time to its recipient.

They were a roving Band of Lovers
Loose on the City Streets.
They were both Real
and Fantasy.

Hoops

Blue and pink sashes,
Criss-cross shoes,
Minna and Stella run out into the garden
To play at hoop.

Up and down the garden-paths they race,
In the yellow sunshine,
Each with a big round hoop
White as a stripped willow-wand.

Round and round turn the hoops,
Their diamond whiteness cleaving the yellow sunshine.
The gravel crunches and squeaks beneath them,
And a large pebble springs them into the air
To go whirling for a foot or two
Before they touch the earth again
In a series of little jumps.

Spring, Hoops!
Spit out a shower of blue and white brightness.
The little criss-cross shoes twinkle behind you,
The pink and blue sashes flutter like flags,
The hoop-sticks are ready to beat you.
Turn, turn, Hoops! In the yellow sunshine.
Turn your stripped willow whiteness
Along the smooth paths.

Stella sings:
'Round and round, rolls my hoop,
Scarcely touching the ground,
With a swoop,
And a bound,
Round and round.
With a bumpety, crunching, scattering sound,
Down the garden it flies;
In our eyes
The sun lies.
See it spin
Out and in;
Through the paths it goes whirling,
About the beds curling.
Sway now to the loop,
Faster, faster, my hoop.
Round you come,
Up you come,
Quick and straight as before.
Run, run, my hoop, run,
Away from the sun.'

And the great hoop bounds along the path,
Leaping into the wind-bright air.

Minna sings:
'Turn, hoop,
Burn hoop,
Twist and twine
Hoop of mine.
Flash along,
Leap along,
Right at the sun.
Run, hoop, run.
Faster and faster,
Whirl, twirl.
Wheel like fire,
And spin like glass;
Fire's no whiter
Glass is no brighter.
Dance,
Prance,
Over and over,
About and about,
With the top of you under,
And the bottom at top,
But never a stop.
Turn about, hoop, to the tap of my stick,
I follow behind you
To touch and remind you.
Burn and glitter, so white and quick,
Round and round, to the tap of a stick.'

The hoop flies along between the flower-beds,
Swaying the flowers with the wind of its passing.

Beside the foxglove-border roll the hoops,
And the little pink and white bells shake and jingle
Up and down their tall spires;
They roll under the snow-ball bush,
And the ground behind them is strewn with white petals;
They swirl round a corner,
And jar a bee out of a Canterbury bell;
They cast their shadows for an instant
Over a bed of pansies,
Catch against the spurs of a columbine,
Jostle the quietness from a cluster of monk's-hood.
Pat! Pat! behind them come the little criss-cross shoes,
And the blue and pink sashes stream out in flappings of colour.

Stella sings:
'Hoop, hoop,
Roll along,
Faster bowl along,
Hoop.
Slow, to the turning,
Now go! - Go!
Quick!
Here's the stick.
Rat-a-tap-tap it,
Pat it, flap it.
Fly like a bird or a yellow-backed bee,
See how soon you can reach that tree.
Here is a path that is perfectly straight.
Roll along, hoop, or we shall be late.'

Minna sings:
'Trip about, slip about, whip about
Hoop.
Wheel like a top at its quickest spin,
Then, dear hoop, we shall surely win.
First to the greenhouse and then to the wall
Circle and circle,
And let the wind push you,
Poke you,
Brush you,
And not let you fall.
Whirring you round like a wreath of mist.
Hoopety hoop,
Twist,
Twist.'

Tap! Tap! go the hoop-sticks,
And the hoops bowl along under a grape arbour.
For an instant their willow whiteness is green,
Pale white-green.
Then they are out in the sunshine,
Leaving the half-formed grape clusters
A-tremble under their big leaves.

'I will beat you, Minna,' cries Stella,
Hitting her hoop smartly with her stick.
'Stella, Stella, we are winning,' calls Minna,
As her hoop curves round a bed of clove-pinks.
A humming-bird whizzes past Stella's ear,
And two or three yellow-and-black butterflies
Flutter, startled, out of a pillar rose.
Round and round race the little girls
After their great white hoops.

Suddenly Minna stops.
Her hoop wavers an instant,
But she catches it up on her stick.
'Listen, Stella!'
Both the little girls are listening;
And the scents of the garden rise up quietly about them.
'It's the chaise! It's Father!
Perhaps he's brought us a book from Boston.'
Twinkle, twinkle, the little criss-cross shoes
Up the garden path.
Blue - pink - an instant, against the syringa hedge.
But the hoops, white as stripped willow-wands,
Lie in the grass,
And the grasshoppers jump back and forth
Over them.

Battledore and Shuttlecock

The shuttlecock soars upward
In a parabola of whiteness,
Turns,
And sinks to a perfect arc.
Plat! the battledore strikes it,
And it rises again,
Without haste,
Winged and curving,
Tracing its white flight
Against the clipped hemlock-trees.
Plat!
Up again,
Orange and sparkling with sun,
Rounding under the blue sky,
Dropping,
Fading to grey-green
In the shadow of the coned hemlocks.
'Ninety-one.' 'Ninety-two.' 'Ninety-three.'
The arms of the little girls
Come up - and up -
Precisely,
Like mechanical toys.
The battledores beat at nothing,
And toss the dazzle of snow
Off their parchment drums.
'Ninety-four.' Plat!
'Ninety-five.' Plat!
Back and forth
Goes the shuttlecock,
Icicle-white,
Leaping at the sharp-edged clouds,
Overturning,
Falling,
Down,
A nd down,
Tinctured with pink
From the upthrusting shine
Of Oriental poppies.

The little girls sway to the counting rhythm;
Left foot,
Right foot.
Plat! Plat!
Yellow heat twines round the handles of the battledores,
The parchment cracks with dryness;
But the shuttlecock
Swings slowly into the ice-blue sky,
Heaving up on the warm air
Like a foam-bubble on a wave,
With feathers slanted and sustaining.
Higher,
Until the earth turns beneath it;
Poised and swinging,
With all the garden flowing beneath it,
Scarlet, and blue, and purple, and white -
Blurred colour reflections in rippled water -
Changing - streaming -
For the moment that Stella takes to lift her arm.
Then the shuttlecock relinquishes,
Bows,
Descends;
And the sharp blue spears of the air
Thrust it to earth.

Again it mounts,
Stepping up on the rising scents of flowers,
Buoyed up and under by the shining heat.
Above the foxgloves,
Above the guelder-roses,
Above the greenhouse glitter,
Till the shafts of cooler air
Meet it,
Deflect it,
Reject it,
Then down,
Down,
Past the greenhouse,
Past the guelder-rose bush,
Past the foxgloves.

'Ninety-nine,' Stella's battledore springs to the impact.
Plunk! Like the snap of a taut string.
'Oh! Minna!'
The shuttlecock drops zigzagedly,
Out of orbit,
Hits the path,
And rolls over quite still.
Dead white feathers,
With a weight at the end.

Garden Games

The tall clock is striking twelve;
And the little girls stop in the hall to watch it,
And the big ships rocking in a half-circle
Above the dial.
Twelve o'clock!
Down the side steps
Go the little girls,
Under their big round straw hats.
Minna's has a pink ribbon,
Stella's a blue,
That is the way they know which is which.
Twelve o'clock!
An hour yet before dinner.
Mother is busy in the still-room,
And Hannah is making gingerbread.

Slowly, with lagging steps,
They follow the garden-path,
Crushing a leaf of box for its acrid smell,
Discussing what they shall do,
And doing nothing.

'Stella, see that grasshopper
Climbing up the bank!
What a jump!
Almost as long as my arm.'
Run, children, run.
For the grasshopper is leaping away,
In half-circle curves,
Shuttlecock curves,
Over the grasses.
Hand in hand, the little girls call to him:
'Grandfather, grandfather gray,
Give me molasses, or I'll throw you away.'

The grasshopper leaps into the sunlight,
Golden-green,
And is gone.

'Let's catch a bee.'
Round whirl the little girls,
And up the garden.
Two heads are thrust among the Canterbury bells,
Listening,
And fingers clasp and unclasp behind backs
In a strain of silence.

White bells,
Blue bells,
Hollow and reflexed.
Deep tunnels of blue and white dimness,
Cool wine-tunnels for bees.
There is a floundering and buzzing over Minna's head.

'Bend it down, Stella. Quick! Quick!'
The wide mouth of a blossom
Is pressed together in Minna's fingers.
The stem flies up, jiggling its flower-bells,
And Minna holds the dark blue cup in her hand,
With the bee
Imprisoned in it.
Whirr! Buzz! Bump!
Bump! Whiz! Bang!
BANG!!
The blue flower tears across like paper,
And a gold-black bee darts away in the sunshine.

'If we could fly, we could catch him.'
The sunshine is hot on Stella's upturned face,
As she stares after the bee.
'We'll follow him in a dove chariot.
Come on, Stella.'
Run, children,
Along the red gravel paths,
For a bee is hard to catch,
Even with a chariot of doves.

Tall, still, and cowled,
Stand the monk's-hoods;
Taller than the heads of the little girls.
A blossom for Minna.
A blossom for Stella.
Off comes the cowl,
And there is a purple-painted chariot;
Off comes the forward petal,
And there are two little green doves,
With green traces tying them to the chariot.
'Now we will get in, and fly right up to the clouds.
Fly, Doves, up in the sky,
With Minna and me,
After the bee.'

Up one path,
Down another,
Run the little girls,
Holding their dove chariots in front of them;
But the bee is hidden in the trumpet of a honeysuckle,
With his wings folded along his back.

The dove chariots are thrown away,
And the little girls wander slowly through the garden,
Sucking the salvia tips,
And squeezing the snapdragons
To make them gape.
'I'm so hot,
Let's pick a pansy
And see the little man in his bath,
And play we're he.'
A royal bath-tub,
Hung with purple stuffs and yellow.
The great purple-yellow wings
Rise up behind the little red and green man;
The purple-yellow wings fan him,
He dabbles his feet in cool green.
Off with the green sheath,
And there are two spindly legs.
'Heigho!' sighs Minna.
'Heigho!' sighs Stella.
There is not a flutter of wind,
And the sun is directly overhead.

Along the edge of the garden
Walk the little girls.
Their hats, round and yellow like cheeses,
Are dangling by the ribbons.
The grass is a tumult of buttercups and daisies;
Buttercups and daisies streaming away
Up the hill.
The garden is purple, and pink, and orange, and scarlet;
The garden is hot with colours.
But the meadow is only yellow, and white, and green,
Cool, and long, and quiet.
The little girls pick buttercups
And hold them under each other's chins.
'You're as gold as Grandfather's snuff-box.
You're going to be very rich, Minna.'
'Oh-o-o! Then I'll ask my husband to give me a pair of garnet earrings
Just like Aunt Nancy's.
I wonder if he will.
I know. We'll tell fortunes.
That's what we'll do.'
Plump down in the meadow grass,
Stella and Minna,
With their round yellow hats,
Like cheeses,
Beside them.
Drop,
Drop,
Daisy petals.
'One I love,
Two I love,
Three I love I say . . .'
The ground is peppered with daisy petals,
And the little girls nibble the golden centres,
And play it is cake.

A bell rings.
Dinner-time;
And after dinner there are lessons. 

I, a princess, king-descended, decked with jewels, gilded, drest,
Would rather be a peasant with her baby at her breast,
For all I shine so like the sun, and am purple like the west.

Two and two my guards behind, two and two before,
Two and two on either hand, they guard me evermore;
Me, poor dove, that must not coo—eagle that must not soar.

All my fountains cast up perfumes, all my gardens grow
Scented woods and foreign spices, with all flowers in blow
That are costly, out of season as the seasons go.

All my walls are lost in mirrors, whereupon I trace 
Self to right hand, self to left hand, self in every place,
Self-same solitary figure, self-same seeking face.

Then I have an ivory chair high to sit upon,
Almost like my father's chair, which is an ivory throne;
There I sit uplift and upright, there I sit alone.

Alone by day, alone by night, alone days without end;
My father and my mother give me treasures, search and spend—
O my father! O my mother! have you ne'er a friend?

As I am a lofty princess, so my father is
A lofty king, accomplished in all kingly subtilties, 
Holding in his strong right hand world-kingdoms' balances.

He has quarrelled with his neighbours, he has scourged his foes;
Vassal counts and princes follow where his pennon goes,
Long-descended valiant lords whom the vulture knows,

On whose track the vulture swoops, when they ride in state
To break the strength of armies and topple down the great:
Each of these my courteous servant, none of these my mate.

My father counting up his strength sets down with equal pen
So many head of cattle, head of horses, head of men;
These for slaughter, these for breeding, with the how and when. 

Some to work on roads, canals; some to man his ships;
Some to smart in mines beneath sharp overseers' whips;
Some to trap fur-beasts in lands where utmost winter nips.

Once it came into my heart, and whelmed me like a flood,
That these too are men and women, human flesh and blood;
Men with hearts and men with souls, though trodden down like mud.

Our feasting was not glad that night, our music was not gay:
On my mother's graceful head I marked a thread of grey,
My father frowning at the fare seemed every dish to weigh.

I sat beside them sole princess in my exalted place, 
My ladies and my gentlemen stood by me on the dais:
A mirror showed me I look old and haggard in the face;

It showed me that my ladies all are fair to gaze upon,
Plump, plenteous-haired, to every one love's secret lore is known,
They laugh by day, they sleep by night; ah me, what is a throne?

The singing men and women sang that night as usual,
The dancers danced in pairs and sets, but music had a fall,
A melancholy windy fall as at a funeral.

Amid the toss of torches to my chamber back we swept;
My ladies loosed my golden chain; meantime I could have wept 
To think of some in galling chains whether they waked or slept.

I took my bath of scented milk, delicately waited on,
They burned sweet things for my delight, cedar and cinnamon,
They lit my shaded silver lamp, and left me there alone.

A day went by, a week went by. One day I heard it said:
'Men are clamouring, women, children, clamouring to be fed;
Men like famished dogs are howling in the streets for bread.'

So two whispered by my door, not thinking I could hear,
Vulgar naked truth, ungarnished for a royal ear;
Fit for cooping in the background, not to stalk so near. 

But I strained my utmost sense to catch this truth, and mark:
'There are families out grazing like cattle in the park.'
'A pair of peasants must be saved even if we build an ark.'

A merry jest, a merry laugh, each strolled upon his way;
One was my page, a lad I reared and bore with day by day;
One was my youngest maid as sweet and white as cream in May.

Other footsteps followed softly with a weightier tramp;
Voices said: 'Picked soldiers have been summoned from the camp
To quell these base-born ruffians who make free to howl and stamp.'

'Howl and stamp?' one answered: 'They made free to hurl a stone 
At the minister's state coach, well aimed and stoutly thrown.'
'There's work then for the soldiers, for this rank crop must be mown.'

'One I saw, a poor old fool with ashes on his head,
Whimpering because a girl had snatched his crust of bread:
Then he dropped; when some one raised him, it turned out he was dead.'

'After us the deluge,' was retorted with a laugh:
'If bread's the staff of life, they must walk without a staff.'
'While I've a loaf they're welcome to my blessing and the chaff.'

These passed. The king: stand up. Said my father with a smile:
'Daughter mine, your mother comes to sit with you awhile, 
She's sad to-day, and who but you her sadness can beguile?'

He too left me. Shall I touch my harp now while I wait,—
(I hear them doubling guard below before our palace gate—)
Or shall I work the last gold stitch into my veil of state;

Or shall my woman stand and read some unimpassioned scene,
There's music of a lulling sort in words that pause between;

Again I caught my father's voice in sharp word of command:
'Charge!' a clash of steel: 'Charge again, the rebels stand.
Smite and spare not, hand to hand; smite and spare not, hand to hand.'

There swelled a tumult at the gate, high voices waxing higher; 
A flash of red reflected light lit the cathedral spire;
I heard a cry for faggots, then I heard a yell for fire.

'Sit and roast there with your meat, sit and bake there with your bread,
You who sat to see us starve,' one shrieking woman said:
'Sit on your throne and roast with your crown upon your head.'

Nay, this thing will I do, while my mother tarrieth,
I will take my fine spun gold, but not to sew therewith,
I will take my gold and gems, and rainbow fan and wreath;

With a ransom in my lap, a king's ransom in my hand, 
I will go down to this people, will stand face to face, will stand

They shall take all to buy them bread, take all I have to give;
I, if I perish, perish; they to-day shall eat and live;
I, if I perish, perish; that's the goal I half conceive:

Once to speak before the world, rend bare my heart and show
The lesson I have learned which is death, is life, to know.

a new rule
on agriculture

'only a qualified person
should advocate on fertilizers to be used in
any cultivation'

a handed down
knowledge or lesson
on cultivation is an illegal one

the toiler
would know his land better
his experience with it.  

nay to his litter
he needs to throw it into the gutter


When the pods went pop on the broom, green broom, 
And apples began to be golden-skinn'd, 
We harbour'd a stag in the Priory coomb, 
And we feather'd his trail up-wind, up-wind, 
We feather'd his trail up-wind- 
A stag of warrant, a stag, a stag, 
A runnable stag, a kingly crop, 
Brow, bay and tray and three on top, 
A stag, a runnable stag.

Then the huntsman's horn rang yap, yap yap, 
And 'Forwards' we heard the harbourer shout; 
But 'twas only a brocket that broke a gap 
In the beechen underwood, driven out, 
From the underwood antler'd out 
By warrant and might of the stag, the stag, 
The runnable stag, whose lordly mind 
Was bent on sleep though beam'd and tined 
He stood, a runnable stag

So we tufted the covert till afternoon 
With Tinkerman's Pup and Bell- of-the-North; 
And hunters were sulky and hounds out of tune 
Before we tufted the right stag forth, 
Before we tufted him forth, 
The stag of warrant, the wily stag, 
The runnable stag with his kingly crop, 
Brow, bay and tray and three on top, 
The royal and runnable stag.

It was Bell-of-the-North and Tinkerman's Pup 
That stuck to the scent till the copse was drawn. 
'Tally ho! tally ho!' and the hunt was up, 
The tufters whipp'd and the pack laid on, 
The resolute pack laid on, 
And the stag of warrant away at last, 
The runnable stag, the same, the same, 
His hoofs on fire, his horns like flame, 
A stag, a runnable stag.

'Let your gelding be: if you check or chide 
He stumbles at once and you're out of the hunt 
For three hundred gentlemen, able to ride, 
On hunters accustom'd to bear the brunt, 
Accustom'd to bear the brunt, 
Are after the runnable stag, the stag, 
The runnable stag with his kingly crop, 
Brow, bay and tray and three on top, 
The right, the runnable stag.

By perilous paths in coomb and dell, 
The heather, the rocks, and the river-bed, 
The pace grew hot, for the scent lay well, 
And a runnable stag goes right ahead, 
The quarry went right ahead-- 
Ahead, ahead, and fast and far; 
His antler'd crest, his cloven hoof, 
Brow, bay and tray and three aloof, 
The stag, the runnable stag.

For a matter of twenty miles and more, 
By the densest hedge and the highest wall, 
Through herds of bullocks lie baffled the lore 
Of harbourer, huntsman, hounds and all, 
Of harbourer, hounds and all 
The stag of warrant, the wily stag, 
For twenty miles, and five and five, 
He ran, and he never was caught alive, 
This stag, this runnable stag.

When he turn'd at bay in the leafy gloom, 
In the emerald gloom where the brook ran deep 
He heard in the distance the rollers boom, 
And he saw In a vision of peaceful sleep 
In a wonderful vision of sleep, 
A stag of warrant, a stag, a stag, 
A runnable stag in a jewell'd bed, 
Under the sheltering ocean dead, 
A stag, a runnable stag.

So a fateful hope lit up his eye, 
And he open'd his nostrils wide again, 
And he toss'd his branching antlers high 
As he headed the hunt down the Charlock glen, 
As he raced down the echoing glen 
For five miles more, the stag, the stag, 
For twenty miles, and five and five, 
Not to be caught now, dead or alive, 
The stag, the runnable stag.

Three hundred gentleman, able to ride, 
Three hundred horses as gallant and free, 
Beheld him escape on the evening tide, 
Far out till he sank in the Severn Sea, 
Till he sank in the depths of the sea 
The stag, the buoyant stag, the stag 
That slept at last in a jewell'd bed 
Under the sheltering ocean spread, 
The stag, the runnable stag. 

To him, who, many a night upon the main,
At mid-watch, from the bounding vessel's side,
Shivering, has listened to the rocking tide,
Oh, how delightful smile thy views again,
Fair Land! the sheltered hut, and far-seen mill
That safe sails round and round; the tripping rill
That o'er the gray sand glitters; the clear sky,
Beneath whose blue vault shines the village tower,
That high elms, swaying in the wind, embower;
And hedge-rows, where the small birds' melody
Solace the lithe and loitering peasant lad!
O Stranger! is thy pausing fancy sad
At thought of many evils which do press
On wide humanity!--Look up; address
Be thankful, though some heavy thoughts have part,
That, sheltered from the human storms' career,
Thou meetest innocence and quiet here. 

A sacred path 

An elusive captive; 
Subtle and fine, 
Designed, modelled 
And crafted, 
 With precision, 
Souls strive 
To ride on her, 
But fail and fall 
Many a time, 
Like an aggrieved soul, 
On bumpy, jumpy 
Road we journey, 
The destination 
Looks very long, 
And spirit not strong, 
Souls fear to tread 
The path, she hath trod, 
She is a jewel, wear it 
You will shine like gold, 
Neither can be chained, 
Nor on her any ill inflicted, 
She kisses not mortal ground, 
Only in Heaven she is found, 
Some call her a beauty, 
And some a truth, 
Both look alike, 
As the two is one. 
And souls not being virtuous, 
All-powerful and 
Sacred path of Truth, 
They demolish and shun. 
And if souls cling to her, 

You're sad because you're sad.
It's psychic. It's the age. It's chemical.
Go see a shrink or take a pill,
or hug your sadness like an eyeless doll
you need to sleep.

Well, all children are sad
but some get over it.
Count your blessings. Better than that,
buy a hat. Buy a coat or pet.
Take up dancing to forget.

Forget what? 
Your sadness, your shadow,
whatever it was that was done to you
the day of the lawn party
when you came inside flushed with the sun,
your mouth sulky with sugar,
in your new dress with the ribbon
and the ice-cream smear,
and said to yourself in the bathroom,
I am not the favorite child.

My darling, when it comes
right down to it
and the light fails and the fog rolls in
and you're trapped in your overturned body
under a blanket or burning car,

and the red flame is seeping out of you
and igniting the tarmac beside your head
or else the floor, or else the pillow,
none of us is; 
or else we all are. 

Her spouse is a little bit physically unfit
So she wanted my body - 
I wanted her heart because I was not so smart
Then couple of years later she found a partner
And lost interest in me

Now I need her body
As the earth needs the sky
As the hungry ones need the food

But she has found a partner
Now she doesn’t need me anymore

His chances of holding her
Were the same as going to the moon.
There's no happy ending to the story
When a porcupine loves a balloon. 

Roses are red 

and violets are blue

You broke me

But I'm still in love with you


I am only a minor 'unknown'
in my little corner of the world.
Such a simple man am I
the lowest lost sheep of the herd.

But yet.  I paint and write
and when my 'pearls' unfurl
I could be a lord and master
owner of the mighty world.

Yet no-one even knows my name.
I was born an only child. 
brought up by a darling Aunt
in the Emerald Isles.

So now, I paint and I write, 
some of my art beguiles.
But my work lies hidden in the loft
in scattered heaps and piles.

Often I have heard it said
'the meek shall inherit the earth'
I am a meek and lowly man
short in height and small of girth.

One day, when I have died
maybe my name will ring a bell
and it will shineth over-night
but the future I cannot foretell.

A golden wish my heart will make
that my daydreams all come true.
I'll go to the wishing well tomorrow.
Yes ~ that's exactly what I'm going to do. 

The river flowed through meadows green
I saw the wild rose, pink and serene.
There came a voice from beyond the blue, 
An angel from heaven said - it was you.

Resting beneath the rays of the sun, 
I gazed at the sky to talk with my one.
The breezes blew sweet whispers to me
Across the mountain and waves of the sea.

The hymn you sang was 'O Love Divine'
I heard your dear voice and you heard mine.
But as the sun went down in the evening sky
There was no sound.  

just your last goodbye. 

You waste the attention of your eyes, 
the glittering labour of your hands, 
and knead the dough enough for dozens of loaves 
of which you'll taste not a morsel; 
you are free to slave for others-- 
you are free to make the rich richer. 

The moment you're born 
they plant around you 
mills that grind lies 
lies to last you a lifetime. 
You keep thinking in your great freedom 
a finger on your temple 
free to have a free conscience. 

Your head bent as if half-cut from the nape, 
your arms long, hanging, 
your saunter about in your great freedom: 
you're free 
with the freedom of being unemployed. 

You love your country 
as the nearest, most precious thing to you. 
But one day, for example, 
they may endorse it over to America, 
and you, too, with your great freedom-- 
you have the freedom to become an air-base. 

You may proclaim that one must live 
not as a tool, a number or a link 
but as a human being-- 
then at once they handcuff your wrists. 
You are free to be arrested, imprisoned 
and even hanged. 

There's neither an iron, wooden 
nor a tulle curtain 
in your life; 
there's no need to choose freedom: 
you are free. 
But this kind of freedom 
is a sad affair under the stars. 

 


My mother was crying in a leap on the floor
My father had a knife as he stood by the door
As I walk slowly from upstairs
Its as if they don't even care
My mother watched father very closely as it seems
Then I close my eyes as my mother screams
I open them after it went quiet, with my father staring
I looked to mom then back at him glaring
My mom was dead! DEAD! ACTUALLY DEAD! 
I looked beyond my father to see a bed
As I looked back at my dad my face went red
On the bed layed a girl I'd never seen before
'You're next, ' he said as he kicked the girl out the door
I started running as fast as I could
But I tripped and fell and I should
Have remembered to get back up but I didn't
My father came to me and I couldn't
Breathe and he tied up my hands and legs
I scream and thrash as I try to beg
My way out of my fathers touch
He's grossing me out a bit too much
He laid me down on a bed that was meant to nap
I tried to fight back but in the end he would just slap
Me until I stopped moving
My legs stopped doing
What my mind told them to
When he said, 'I love you'
I never knew he meant like this
My breathing stops, my heart accelerates as you kiss
All the way down to my neck
The whole time I'm thinking 'What the heck? '
I'm scared, fragile, little and your own daughter! 
But that just brought you laughter
When finally I can't take anymore
I hear a loud bang as the door
Flies open and my father is off me
I cry a silent plea

When I was youthful
I was thoughtfully agile
To be perfectly truthful
I'm now thoughtfully fragile

How did it happen? 
Nimble thoughts don't flow-down
Has my brain just been nappin
And causing thought-slow-down? 

My age won't defeat me
With thoughts gone astray
I won't let this beat me
I've too much to say
 
Though my thought flow's diminished
Don't give up on me yet
My brainwork's not finished
On that you can bet


The rolling tan hills
slope away gently
tracing a certain soft patina
in the dusty night; 
framed by 
black, straight
long stemmed flowers
languid against
my back-dropp window; 
they look like night time sun-risings, 

against a curved topography
which seems to move up
and down slowly
in the invisible summer breeze; 

framed
are two dark pools
which glitter in subdued light.

There are dimpled mounds too
rounded, curving away.

Further down
the whole view
indents, like a woman's body
and curves back out again
forming what I think of  as 
two safe harbors
on either side.

Peninsula structures
are next
framing
a mystery center
which is barely visible
but I can see heat eddies
make the air wavy 
as they rise.

All of this forms
a wondrous curved archipelago.

All of this is your body, 
the body I love, 
and you, 
who
when
our geography's meet, 
make the world new
again
each night.

We each
are explorers
who
need a lifetime
to see
where Geography
and Sweet Love
meet. 

A saint about to fall,
The stained flats of heaven hit and razed
To the kissed kite hems of his shawl,
On the last street wave praised
The unwinding, song by rock,
Of the woven wall
Of his father's house in the sands,
The vanishing of the musical ship-work and the chucked bells,
The wound-down cough of the blood-counting clock
Behind a face of hands,
On the angelic etna of the last whirring featherlands,
Wind-heeled foot in the hole of a fireball,
Hymned his shrivelling flock,
On the last rick's tip by spilled wine-wells
Sang heaven hungry and the quick
The mazes of his praise and envious tongue were worked in flames and shells.

Glory cracked like a flea.
The sun-leaved holy candlewoods
Drivelled down to one singeing tree
With a stub of black buds,
The sweet, fish-gilled boats bringing blood
Lurched through a scuttled sea
With a hold of leeches and straws,
Heaven fell with his fall and one crocked bell beat the left air.
O wake in me in my house in the mud
Of the crotch of the squawking shores,
Flicked from the carbolic city puzzle in a bed of sores
The scudding base of the familiar sky,
The lofty roots of the clouds.
From an odd room in a split house stare,
Milk in your mouth, at the sour floods
That bury the sweet street slowly, see
The skull of the earth is barbed with a war of burning brains and hair.

Strike in the time-bomb town,
Raise the live rafters of the eardrum,
Throw your fear a parcel of stone
Through the dark asylum,
Lapped among herods wail
As their blade marches in
That the eyes are already murdered,
The stocked heart is forced, and agony has another mouth to feed.
O wake to see, after a noble fall,
The old mud hatch again, the horrid
Woe drip from the dishrag hands and the pressed sponge of the forehead,
The breath draw back like a bolt through white oil
And a stranger enter like iron.
Cry joy that hits witchlike midwife second
Bullies into rough seas you so gentle
And makes with a flick of the thumb and sun
A thundering bullring of your silent and girl-circled island. 

A sake barrel,
Born without hands, makes merry —
Cherry blossom time. 

What does it mean to move or to shake? 
Not to become stagnant, do not hesitate, 
Take the ordinary, spice it, make it great, 

Matthew   "You are the salt of the earth, 
but if salt has lost its taste" what is it worth? 
"To be thrown out and trampled underneath, "
Not by just anything but under, "peoples feet."

"Have salt in yourselves, at peace with one another, "
Mark   Colossians   to answer your brother, 
Leviticus   salt shall be put on all of your grain, 

Used properly in winter salt can melt the thickest ice, 
Just the right amount on food makes is twice as nice, 
Kings   "went to the spring, threw salt and said, 

Good Hope Church: Mary, Lilly, Una, Jeanette & Jo, 
Monday-Friday, are present to let summer kids know, 
It’s a waste of time spending vacation at home board, 
And bid her trump spread thy Majestick name; 
Which sport themselves upon the dancing floods, 
May bow as to their Neptune, when they feel 
The awful pressure of thy potent keel. 
Great wonder of the time! whose form unites, 
In one aspect two warring opposites, 
Delight and horrour; and in them portends 
Diff'ring events both to thy foes and friends: 
To these thy radiant brow, Peaces bright Shrine, 
Doth like that golden Constellation shine, 
Which guides the Sea man with auspicious beams, 
Safe and unshipwrackt through the troubled streams. 
But, as a blazing Meteor, to those 
It doth ostents of blood and death disclose. 
For thy rich Decks lighten like Heavens fires, 
To usher forth the thunder of thy Tires. 
O never may cross wind, or swelling wave 
Conspire to make the treach'rous sands thy grave: 
Nor envious rocks in their white foamy laugh 
Rejoyce to wear thy losses Epitaph. 
But may the smoothest, most successful gales 
Distend thy sheet, and wing thy flying sailes: 
That all designes which must on thee embark, 
May be securely plac't as in the Ark. 
May'st thou, where ere thy streamers shall display, 
Enforce the bold disputers to obey: 
That they whose pens are sharper then their swords, 
May yield in fact what they deny'd in words. 
Thus when th' amazed world our Seas shall see 
Thou may'st returning from the conquer'd Main, 
With thine own Triumphs be crown'd Soveraign. 

I could take you, reader, to a quiet place
Where sea meets sand, in secret beachy cove, 
And, sleeping there, a-sprawl in open spaces
Lie a hundred seals or more in silent drove.

The cliff-top watcher can but hardly count
Their numbers, random sleepy bulks below
Are motionless, until white pups, mounting
Mother's slippery back expose stained yellow
Underside and squeal with tiny lungs, crying
Out for milk. All this seen from distant top
Of perhaps two hundred feet.  Flappers high
Some now are fighting, raise huge heads, then flop
Again to take more rest. This rare show, truly
Free and unexpected, leaves me gasping 
In delight. What more exciting scene, blue
Sky ceiling, and sudden sky-lark asking
With a song, for early spring. The icing's
On my cake with this Sanctuary sighting. 

amidst
this intense forest
where no human
treads upon
so much of incense
who inhales
the perspiration
of these
sandalwood trees
even if human does not
it' stands tall
when human knows
he bereft to benefit
poor tree
it has no arms to resist
even after death
it's life lingers
in it's smell


If you make a revolution, make it for fun,
don't make it in ghastly seriousness,
don't do it in deadly earnest,
do it for fun.

Don't do it because you hate people,
do it just to spit in their eye.

Don't do it for the money,
do it and be damned to the money.

Don't do it for equality,
do it because we've got too much equality
and it would be fun to upset the apple-cart
and see which way the apples would go a-rolling.

Don't do it for the working classes.
Do it so that we can all of us be little aristocracies on our own
and kick our heels like jolly escaped asses.

Don't do it, anyhow, for international Labour.
Labour is the one thing a man has had too much of.
Let's abolish labour, let's have done with labouring!
Work can be fun, and men can enjoy it; then it's not labour.
Let's have it so! Let's make a revolution for fun

At times a lull creeps over liveliness
And morose barreness engulfs my mind.
A no-thought blanket erodes all finesse
Or elegance in careful phrasing, binds
This poet, and chokes every bit of stylish
Verse. Then it is the weary mind takes on
It's own control, rolls out reams by the mile
Of wasted time in empty worded pun
Or rhyme, on piles of paper due for bin
This state I find I'm in with h down.
Feeling cloyed with surfeit verses within
Short space has me sated. No muse now around.

H. friends - - thank you for your support
and kind comments on my work. I will be taking
a short break from posting, but hope to be back

"His Grace! impossible! what, dead!
Of old age too, and in his bed!
And could that mighty warrior fall,
And so inglorious, after all?
Well, since he's gone, no matter how,
The last loud trump must wake him now;
And, trust me, as the noise grows stronger,
He'd wish to sleep a little longer.
And could he be indeed so old
As by the newspapers we're told?
Threescore, I think, is pretty high;
'Twas time in conscience he should die!
This world he cumber'd long enough;
He burnt his candle to the snuff;
And that's the reason, some folks think,
He left behind so great a stink.
Behold his funeral appears,
Nor widows' sighs, nor orphans' tears,
Wont at such times each heart to pierce,
Attend the progress of his hearse.
But what of that? his friends may say,
He had those honours in his day.
True to his profit and his pride,
He made them weep before he died

Come hither, all ye empty things!
Ye bubbles rais'd by breath of kings!
Who float upon the tide of state;
Come hither, and behold your fate!
From all his ill-got honours flung,
Turn'd to that dirt from whence he sprung"A merry burgomaster
In a burgh upon the Rhine
Said, 'Our burghers all are
Far too fond of drinking wine.'
So the merry burgomaster,
When the burgomasters met,
Bade them look into the matter
Ere the thing went farther yet.

And the merry burgomasters
Did decide the only way
To alleviate the evil
Without worry or delay
Would be just to call a meeting
Of the burghers, great and small,
And then open every wine cask
And proceed to drink it all.

'For,' they said, 'when we have swallowed
Every drop that’s in the land,
There can be no more of drinking,
It is plain to understand.'
So they called a monster meeting,
And the burghers, small and great,
Drank and drank until they were too
Tipsy to perambulate.

But there still was wine in plenty,
So, in sooth, the only way
Was to call another meeting;
So they called it for next day.
Thus from day to day the burghers
Met and swallowed seas of wine,
And they vowed the reformation
Was a mission quite divine.

And today the worthy burghers
In that burgh upon the Rhine
Still continue their great mission,
And still swallow seas of wine.
And they vow they will not falter
In their great reforming task
Till the last drop has been emptied
From the very last wine cask. 

Only once in life will I have such memories
Friends with days & trips to fairytales
Scattered as they are now in this prison, the world
Far from memories which linger in this poet’s heart
We made love out of fun & played the role of brothers

As days flew bonds strengthened 
For my brothers were all good at heart
I played the dumb role of a jester
While it gave me time to be a viewer
Now when I sit on my rocking chair
They all are moving ahead in life
Busy with the hustle & bustle
Of earning bread in style

The same music we heard then 
Fragment of the same sky we saw then
Fragrance of the same rose, jasmine& lily
They all are brothers & sisters 
To those phantoms of yesterday
Let me love you O world in return
Curse fate when you are tormented 
Fruits of the gamble of time & fate 
Are for you O world 
Do you not see the joy hidden
Only once in life will that happen
Though reflections in between Thursday & Friday
Become infinite through those mirrors
Call it reflection when read today
Excursion was before my tomorrow then. 

The sun sets and darkness envelopes the world
In the wrath of its deadly sin.
Only the stars shine bright in the vast universe
But yet this blackness sucks me into a world
Of plight where there will never be any delight.

When I am alone at night, 
The darkness closes around me tight.
There is one savior that keeps me company.
Music brings the light.

When a storm approaches and rain comes down.
The lightening streaks through the sky
Tearing my eyes and making me cry.
Music is the rainbow.

When my brokenheart dulls my senses, 
And my river of tears runs vast
I feel the pain searing through me
Music can only drive it to the past.

When my heart swells, and overwhelming joy brings happiness, 
I start to sing and dance because a savior brought this day, 
Music will always lead the way

Tools with the comely names,
Mattock and scythe and spade,
Couth and bitter as flames,
Clean, and bowed in the blade,--
A man and his tools make a man and his trade.

Breadth of the English shires,
Hummock and kame and mead,
Tang of the reeking byres,
Land of the English breed,--
A man and his land make a man and his creed.

Leisurely flocks and herds,
Cool-eyed cattle that come
Mildly to wonted words,
Swine that in orchards roam,--
A man and his beasts make a man and his home.

Children sturdy and flaxen
Shouting in brotherly strife,
Like the land they are Saxon,
Sons of a man and his wife,--
For a man and his loves make a man and his life. 

Sweet and melodious as Homeric rhymes, 
But had a life of tragedy prime.
Faraway from vanity 
She was as sacred as Trinity.

In a harsh countryside
from a barbaric tribe; 
She was like a wild rose
Deprived from her repose.

Such woes and sorrow I had never seen. 
Upon my plaintive query 
At once her face got scary.

'Since got conscious
Immersed into this life noxious
Never had a second of sweet willing, 
Always been threatened of honor-killing.'

'Neither joy nor certitude, I had
but been blessed often with fortune bad'.
In sobs and sigh-many a time
She had versed her past in melancholy rhymes.

Alone and distant as a polar star, 
Helpless was I to wage a war, 
And her wild wide scary eyes, 
Made my dreams full of cries. 

Housewives as the nights, 
Came through, 
The ceiling swung, 
And then it grew

Have you ever seen the rain, 
Shine blue? 
In the Ring Of Fire, 
Just for you? 

Have you felt that chill, 
With dew? 
The yellow moon above 
sweep through? 

Have you sighed that fateful, 
 Word of doom, 
Fallen into that tunnel, 
yes it looms.

A whisper blares across, 
The room, 
The stars come to my eyes, but
I sail through.

A laughing ace of hearts says, 
YOU, 
Then dances round and round, 
And withdrew.

Have you ever seen brick walls 
Of blue, 
Stand tall and strong but 
I pass through.

Is the hammer big, or is it 
The room? 
This pounding in my head, 
I knew.

The door rushes away, from my field 
Of view, 
Then comes running back, what can, 
I do? 

I sit up suddenly, is it, 
Through? 
The relief that dreams don’t ususally 
come, true. 

Cool shades and dews are round my way,
And silence of the early day;
Mid the dark rocks that watch his bed,
Glitters the mighty Hudson spread,
Unrippled, save by drops that fall
From shrubs that fringe his mountain wall;
And o'er the clear still water swells
The music of the Sabbath bells.

All, save this little nook of land
Circled with trees, on which I stand;
All, save that line of hills which lie
Suspended in the mimic sky--
Seems a blue void, above, below,
Through which the white clouds come and go,
And from the green world's farthest steep
I gaze into the airy deep.

Loveliest of lovely things are they,
On earth, that soonest pass away.
The rose that lives its little hour
Is prized beyond the sculptured flower.
Even love, long tried and cherished long,
Becomes more tender and more strong,
At thought of that insatiate grave
From which its yearnings cannot save.

River! in this still hour thou hast
Too much of heaven on earth to last;
Nor long may thy still waters lie,
An image of the glorious sky.
Thy fate and mine are not repose,
And ere another evening close,
Thou to thy tides shalt turn again,
And I to seek the crowd of men. 

Kind to animals
For abandoned her heart beats
My noble friend Claire


Edward

Hist, William! hist! what means that air so gay?
Thy looks, thy dress, bespeak some holiday:
Thy hat is brushed; thy hands, with wondrous pains,
Are cleansed from garden mould and inky stains;
Thy glossy shoes confess the lacquey's care;
And recent from the comb shines thy sleek hair.
What god, what saint, this prodigy has wrought?
Declare the cause, and ease my labouring thought?

William

Mamma prevails, and I am sent for home.

Harry

Thrice happy whom such welcome tidings greet!
Thrice happy who reviews his native seat!
For him the matron spreads her candied hoard,
And early strawberries crown the smiling board;
For him crushed gooseberries with rich cream combine,
And bending boughs their fragrant fruit resign:
Custards and sillabubs his taste invite;
Sports fill the day, and feasts prolong the night.
Think not I envy, I admire thy fate:
Yet, ah! what different tasks thy comrades wait!
Some in the grammar's thorny maze to toil,
Some with rude strokes the snowy paper soil,
Some o'er barbaric climes in maps to roam,
Far from their mother-tongue, and dear loved home.
Harsh names, of uncouth sound, their memories load,
And oft their shoulders feel the' unpleasant goad.

Edward

Doubt not our turn will come some future time.
Now, William, hear us twain contend in rime;
For yet thy horses have not eat their hay,
And unconsumed as yet the' allotted hour of play.

William

Then spout alternate, I consent to hear,—
Let no false rime offend my critic ear;—
But say, what prizes shall the victor hold?
I guess your pockets are not lined with gold!

Harry

A ship these hands have built, in every part
Carved, rigged, and painted, with the nicest art;
The ridgy sides are black with pitchy store,
From stem to stern 't is twice ten inches o'er.
The lofty mast, a straight smooth hazel framed,
The tackling silk, the Charming Sally named;
And,—but take heed lest thou divulge the tale,—
The lappet of my shirt supplied the sail;
An azure ribband for a pendant flies:—
Now, if thy verse excell, be this the prize.

Edward

For me at home the careful housewives make,
With plums and almonds rich, an ample cake.
Smooth is the top, a plain of shining ice,
The West its sweetness gives, the East its spice:
From soft Ionian isles, well known to fame,
Ulysses' once, the luscious currant came.
The green transparent citron Spain bestows,
And from her golden groves the orange glows.
So vast the heaving mass, it scarce has room
Within the oven's dark capacious womb;
'Twill be consigned to the next carrier's care,
I cannot yield it all,—be half thy share.

Harry

Well does the gift thy liquorish palate suit;
I know who robbed the orchard of its fruit.
When all were wrapt in sleep, one early morn,
While yet the dewdrop trembled on the thorn,
I marked when o'er the quickset hedge you leapt,
And, sly, beneath the gooseberry bushes crept;
Then shook the trees; a shower of apples fell,—
And where the hoard you kept I know full well;
The mellow gooseberries did themselves produce,
For through thy pocket oozed the viscous juice.

Edward

I scorn a telltale, or I could declare
How, leave unasked, you sought the neighbouring fair;
Then home by moonlight spurred your jaded steed,
And scarce returned before the hour of bed.
Think how thy trembling heart had felt affright,
Had not our master supped abroad that night.

Harry

On the smooth whitewashed ceiling near thy bed,
Mixed with thine own, is Anna's cypher read;
From wreaths of dusky smoke the letters flow;—
Whose hand the waving candle held, I know.
Fines and jobations shall thy soul appall,
Whene'er our mistress spies the sullied wall.

Edward

Unconned her lesson once, in idle mood,
Trembling before the master, Anna stood;
I marked what prompter near her took his place,
And, whispering, saved the virgin from disgrace:
Much is the youth belied, and much the maid,
Or more than words the whisper soft conveyed.

Harry

Think not I blush to own so bright a flame,
Even boys for her assume the lover's name;—
As far as alleys beyond taws we prize,
Or venison pasty ranks above school pies;
As much as peaches beyond apples please,
Or Parmesan excells a Suffolk cheese;
Or Palgrave donkeys lag behind a steed,—
So far do Anna's charms all other charms exceed.

Edward

Tell, if thou canst, where is that creature bred,
Whose wide-stretched mouth is larger than its head:
Guess, and my great Apollo thou shalt be,
And cake and ship shall both remain with thee.

Harry

Explain thou first, what portent late was seen,
With strides impetuous, posting o'er the green;
Three heads, like Cerberus, the monster bore,
And one was sidelong fixed, and two before;
Eight legs, depending from his ample sides,
Each well-built flank unequally divides;
For five on this, on that side three are found,
Four swiftly move, and four not touch the ground.
Long time the moving prodigy I viewed,
By gazing men, and barking dogs pursued.

William

Cease! cease your carols, both! for lo the bell,
With jarring notes, has rung out Pleasure's knell.
Your startled comrades, ere the game be done,
Quit their unfinished sports, and trembling run.
Haste to your forms before the master call!
With thoughtful step he paces o'er the hall,
Does with stern looks each playful loiterer greet,
Counts with his eye, and marks each vacant seat;
Intense the buzzing murmur grows around,
Loud through the dome the usher's strokes resound.
Sneak off, and to your places slily steal,
Before the prowess of his arm you feel. 

Mobilized into other parks farther along- buying 
Her flowers and sending them to places
She no longer works anymore: 
Streetless cars losing their clothing and pornographies
Never making a sound anymore in castanets of
Australian pines- 
Ripples in shells and areolas- the tiniest sea otters
Laughing on her chest, 
Mermaids whose mascara never seems to stop running, 
And little boys flying away from school: 
Flying up into clouds to see airplanes populated entirely 
By stewardesses, 
And giants who look into their windows and seeing them
Like foxes and sword fish in zoetropes, 
Turning around with their arms raised
And laughing
Exulting in the showers of the sun, their noses bleeding 
From the altitude, 
And kissing like magnets on refrigerators, and always mothers
To be
Conceptualizing their children across the mowed grass
As the busses turn around like chartreuse butterflies 
So far down beneath them, and in front of
A school their souls will never attend.A science—so the Savants say,
"Comparative Anatomy"—
By which a single bone—
Is made a secret to unfold
Of some rare tenant of the mold,
Else perished in the stone—

So to the eye prospective led,
This meekest flower of the mead
Upon a winter's day,
Stands representative in gold
Of Rose and Lily, manifold,
And countless Butterfly

It is a popular belief that Upanishads are texts of theology and religion. But Upanishads are also texts of science. How? Please go through this article.


     Upanishads together with Vedanta and advaita philosophy can be viewed and understood from modern psychological and scientific points of view also. Such a view reveals the psychological and scientific content of the Upanishadic awareness. This view can be applied beneficially to the fields of mind-machine modeling, physiological psychology and natural language comprehension branch of artificial intelligence.

     Upanishads propose the existence of Atman in individuals and Upanishads are source books of Atma Jnana. Atma Jnana consists of the theory of the origin, structure, function, cessation and control of mind in the four conscious states or phases of mind in which it works and ceases to work. Atma Jnana also provides us with the details of the source of psychic or mental energy whose changes and transformations enable us to know, perceive, reason, intuit, understand/experience and be aware of all these processes.

a)     PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC MEANINGS OF CHIEF UPANISHADIC MAHAVAKYAS 

                    Aham Brahma Asmi             I AM BRHMAN                  I AM SELF
 	The real identity of ‘I’ is Unoccupied Awareness. The state of  SELF.
	‘I’ is not a body, person, thought or not a sense.  ‘I’ is pure consciousness.
	‘I’ is the impersonal Seer which is the source of mental energy and guide of    and 	witness to transformation of mental energy as mental functions but unaffected by 	them and transcending both mental functions   and their cessation.

                        Tat Tvam Asi    THAT IS YOU      YOU ARE THE SELF
Self and Pure Consciousnesses are same in nature, content, structure, form (function)     and presence. At a given moment either self-consciousness or pure consciousness will be present. Self-consciousness is super imposition over pure consciousness. Pure consciousness is continuous, self-consciousness is transient and transitory.
 
          Ayam Atma Brahma   THIS ATMAN IS BRAHMAN  ATMAN= BRAHMAN=SELF  
Atman is Brahman – Unoccupied Awareness –- Energy Presence without transformation.

          Prajnanam Brahma   PRAJNANAM IS BRAHMAN       PRAJNANAM IS SELF
Brahman– as Atman –– Energy Presence – is Mental Time- Space and   Continuous Awareness.
Prajnanam is Unoccupied (by cognitions, thoughts, cognition-related and created experiences, senses or their retrieval)     Awareness in Pure Consciousness.
 
      Raso vy Saha   AWARENESS OF MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE/EXPERIENCED  MEANING  IS BRAHMA ALL SOUNDS &SENSES ORIGINATE & MERGE IN SELF 
Experience of Essence of the meanings of all vakyas (sentences)     - All Cognition-related experiences in the awareness of the Atman- Meaningful Experience. Silence. Peace. Bliss.  Experienced  meaning. Purport.

      Anando Brahma   BLISS IS BRAHMAN       STATE OF SELF IS STATE OF BLISS
Unoccupied Awareness is bliss.

    Sarvam Khalu Idam Brahma   ALL IDAM IS BRAHMAN  ALL KNOWN/ PERCEIVED / EXPERIENCED/UNDERSTOOD WORLD IS PART AND PARCEL OF AND CONTAINED IN SELF; IS A SUPERIMPOSITION ON THE REAL I STATE
Idam, (prapancham or jagat)     (all the world - the collection of cognitions sensed by sense organs through the medium of manas)     – is composed in, made up of, sustained by, rests in and ceases to be because of and part and parcel of psychic energy pulse generator – Atman.   
 
b)     WHAT IS ‘I’? 

The real identity of ‘I’ according to Upanishads: 

The term ‘I’, denotes human consciousness. Human consciousness is awareness of human mind. 

‘I’ is not a term denoting any of an individual, individual’s body, self-consciousness, the social status, age, gender, nationality etc., 

‘I’ is the unoccupied awareness or pure consciousness in the individual in the Jagrat Sushupti (wakeful sleep)     consciousness state when peace, bliss, silence and oneness or non-duality is experienced.

‘I’ is not a person, a thought, a sense, an experience or an understanding. ‘I’ is a consciousness which transcends all these and is a non-transforming seer and witness to all these and is revealed and experienced as peace or bliss or silence in wakeful sleep conscious state- the mind-transcending phase when all mental activities in the form of thoughts and senses etc, -cease to be. And one has to refer to this natural mental state when one refers to ‘I’.

‘I’ is unceasing, undivided continuous blissful conscious awareness.

‘I’ or Atman is consciousness present always (in all phases of mind)     and is super-imposed but untouched by mental functions during wakeful (Jagrat)     and dream (Swapna)     conscious states and becomes sense/mood or thought or expression. 

 Self-consciousness arises in these two states and then ‘I’ is identified with individual’s body, sense and thoughts about I, me, mine, mental capabilities, gender, social status, age etc, and masks pure consciousness. 

 In deep sleep (Sushupti)     conscious state (like zero in number system without value but is essential and significant)     there is no awareness of the body, the within or without of the body.  No ‘I’ expression, thought, feeling or sense or experience relating to individual exists in this mental phase.

‘I’ or Atman is an eternal consciousness transcending the three conscious states – wakeful, dream and deep sleep- and observes all the mental activities or cessation of such activities taking place in these three mental phases.  ‘I’ is also present during these phases as continuous consciousness/awareness to happenings within and without of the body.

Upanishadic awareness uses the terms Atman, Brahman, Sat (Being) , Chit (Pure Consciousness) , Ananda (Bliss) , Prajnanam (mental time-space – Unoccupied Awareness) , Santhi (Peace) , Maunam (Silence/Quietude/Mental Solitude)     synonymously 

      Atman is Brahmapadartha. Padartha is defined as an entity devoid of name and form. Atman and Brahman are one and the same. The presence of Atman provides us with mental energy (chit sakti)     and mental time-space (prajnaanam) .. 

Atman is the source of psychic energy or chit sakti. Because of chit sakti only we are able to be aware of our body, mind and its functions.
 
     From Atman, chit sakti issues out and gets reflected in Medha as maya.
 Thus maya is reflected chit sakti and is virtual (mithya) , in the same sense of presence of virtual image in the mirror which is there but is not real. Virtual also means it is sourced from something else and its being is dependent on its source and phase of existence is transitory compared to its source. Maya is also known as chidaabhaasa or pranavam.

Maya, the mental energy providing current of awareness, pervades whole body. It bifurcates and transforms into divya and swara. Divya is the jnaana sakti. It gets divided as four antahkaranas (inner mental tools)    - manas, buddhi, chittam and ahamkaaram. Swara, the praana sakti divides itself into pancha praanas- praana, apaana, vyaana, udaana and samaana.

     Manas is the inner mental tool that connects us to the outside world through sense organs and cognition of objects takes place. Manas also stores these cognitions as inner mental world (prapancham or idam)     and retrieves from it when necessary the cognitions as jagat in the form of thoughts or feelings (bhavas) .

     These cognitions when taking place create perceptions and simultaneously cause corresponding experiences to us. These are called vasanas (remembrances) . Vasanas, which include also the meanings or senses of words and sentences we learn, are sensed, stored and retrieved by the inner mental tool chittam.

     The inner mental tool buddhi gives the ability for intellectual operations and discrimination. 

The inner mental tool ahamkaram gives us self-consciousness. Self-consciousness is a bunch of thoughts and feelings in the individual about oneself as I, me and mine, like the features of body, gender, job, social status, nationality, loves, hatreds, mental qualities and traits etc., when ‘I’ is identified with the individual’s body and mind.

     Praana sakti activates action organs which act and react according to the perception created when knowing an object (vishaya)     takes place. Thus Atmajnaana expounded by the Upanishds provides the software of mental functions.

     Our learning of various languages, knowledge, subjects, disciplines and skills and actions and interactions using mind are thus chit energy transformations in mental time space known as unoccupied awareness (prajnaanam)     provided by Atman.

     Our mental functions are a combined operation of Atman, maya, antahkaranaas, panchpraanas, jnaanendriyaas (sense organs- eye, ear, nose, tongue and skin)     and karmendriyaas (action organs-speech, movements relating to hands, legs, bowels and reproductive organ) .




      Maya is a series of reflected and virtual chit energy pulses, which flow throughout the body enabling us to be conscious-beings. Thus chit sakti first transforms as maya and then maya transforms as as jnaana sakti and praana sakti creating antahkaranas (inner mental tools)     and pancha praanas respectively activating sense organs and action organs and hence causes various conscious states and phases of mind.     
 
      Further, Atman – the Sat-Chit-Ananda- as Sat gives humans the ability to relate themselves to the body, their self (egoistic mind) , aches/pains/sensations within (to have self-consciousness)     and without of their body, as Chit gives the ability to know, to perceive, to think and as Ananda to experience, to understand, to create and remove moods, to know the meanings of utterances and experiences and as Sat-Chit-Ananda gives humans the ability to be aware of all these. 

     If humans are involved in these mental functions with an egoistic mind, they are self-conscious (jivatma/egoistic state of mind / individual)     and if they witness these transcending as a seer or witness (saakshi)     uninvolved and unaffected, they are pure consciousness (paramatma / egoless/ego-transcending /Divine) .

     When studied with an open mind and further contemplation like this, it becomes clear that Upanishads are actually Texts of Science on Human Mind. The Atmajnana (Knowledge of Self)     as revealed in the Upanishads is an integrated psychology in mental energy-presence and -transformation terms.

Thou indeed in Thy compassion
Blessed me with scientific knowledge
The world looks with admiration! 

Let my work bring the society
Greater peace for ever and plenty
Health and happiness sure for all
Make the people quite fair and tall! 

Bless me with mind and brain active
And make my service positive
For generations to be born
My work to remain great and green! 

Let my success come with efforts
Efforts never done by others
To give all solace and comforts
Keep in high spirits and feathers

DARK Lily without blame,  
 Not upon us the shame,  
Whose sires were to the Auld Alliance true;  
 They, by the Maiden’s side,  
 Victorious fought and died;
One stood by thee that fiery torment through,  
 Till the White Dove from thy pure lips had passed,  
And thou wert with thine own St. Catherine at the last.  
 
 Once only didst thou see,  
 In artist’s imagery,
Thine own face painted, and that precious thing  
 Was in an Archer’s hand  
 From the leal Northern land. 

A Scotchman whose name was Isbister
Had a maiden giraffe he called 'sister'
When she said 'Oh, be mine,
Be my sweet Valentine!'
He just shinned up her long neck and kissed her

"Will you go to war just for a scrap of paper?" -- Question 
of the German Chancellor to the British Ambassador, 
August   


A mocking question! Britain's answer came
Swift as the light and searching as the flame. 

"Yes, for a scrap of paper we will fight

"A scrap of paper where a name is set
Is strong as duty's pledge and honor's debt. 

"A scrap of paper holds for man and wife 
The sacrament of love, the bond of life. 

"A scrap of paper may be Holy Writ

"A scrap of paper binds us both to stand
Defenders of a neutral neighbor land. 

To keep our name upon that paper white

"I need to find time- 
a scrap of time 
unnoticed 
by the demands of everyday life 
that chews up every morsel of time it can find. 

I want to meditate on these stray birds of thought- 
I want to know that my life 
was more than washing dishes 
and waiting for the phone to ring 
bearing news of joy or sorrow. 

The lover of child Marjory
Had one white hour of life brim full; 
Now the old nurse, the rocking sea, 
Hath him to lull.
The daughter of child Marjory
Hath in her veins, to beat and run, 
The glad indomitable sea, 
The strong white sun. 

There are certain things - as, a spider, a ghost,
The income-tax, gout, an umbrella for three -
That I hate, but the thing that I hate the most
Is a thing they call the Sea. 

Pour some salt water over the floor -
Ugly I'm sure you'll allow it to be:
Suppose it extended a mile or more,
THAT'S very like the Sea. 

Beat a dog till it howls outright -
Cruel, but all very well for a spree:
Suppose that he did so day and night,
THAT would be like the Sea. 

I had a vision of nursery-maids;
Tens of thousands passed by me -
All leading children with wooden spades,
And this was by the Sea. 

Who invented those spades of wood?
Who was it cut them out of the tree?
None, I think, but an idiot could -
Or one that loved the Sea. 

It is pleasant and dreamy, no doubt, to float
With 'thoughts as boundless, and souls as free':
But, suppose you are very unwell in the boat,
How do you like the Sea? 

There is an insect that people avoid
(Whence is derived the verb 'to flee').
Where have you been by it most annoyed?
In lodgings by the Sea. 

If you like your coffee with sand for dregs,
A decided hint of salt in your tea,
And a fishy taste in the very eggs -
By all means choose the Sea. 

And if, with these dainties to drink and eat,
You prefer not a vestige of grass or tree,
And a chronic state of wet in your feet,
Then - I recommend the Sea. 

For I have friends who dwell by the coast -
Pleasant friends they are to me!
It is when I am with them I wonder most
That anyone likes the Sea. 

They take me a walk: though tired and stiff,
To climb the heights I madly agree;
And, after a tumble or so from the cliff,
They kindly suggest the Sea. 

I try the rocks, and I think it cool
That they laugh with such an excess of glee,
As I heavily slip into every pool
That skirts the cold cold Sea. 

Be happy prettiest bird caged for your beauty, 
keep dreaming of clouds but sing
without having to answer to anything
for you have a song which you learnt
while you were still in the egg. 

that's your freedom! 
I may have no master and the entire space
is no more than the shape around me
and I leave no trail of my whereabouts
but I tear preys instead of singing
and I've a hawk above me. 

no matter how high
I can soar, hunger brings me to the cage
called food.

By Sidney and Clifford Lanier.

O wish that's vainer than the plash
 Of these wave-whimsies on the shore:
"Give us a pearl to fill the gash --

O wish that's stronger than the stroke
 Of yelling wave and snapping levin;
 All white, to Thee and her in Heaven!"

O wish that's swifter than the race
 Of wave and wind in sea and sky;
Let's take the grave-cloth from her face
 And fall in the grave, and kiss, and die!

Look!  High above a glittering calm
 Of sea and sky and kingly sun,
She shines and smiles, and waves a palm --
 And now we wish -- Thy will be done

We walked beside the sea,
After a day which perished silently
Of its own glory---like the Princess weird
Who, combating the Genius, scorched and seared,
Uttered with burning breath, 'Ho! victory!'
And sank adown, an heap of ashes pale;
     So runs the Arab tale.

     The sky above us showed
An universal and unmoving cloud,
On which, the cliffs permitted us to see
Only the outline of their majesty,
As master-minds, when gazed at by the crowd!
And, shining with a gloom, the water grey
     Swang in its moon-taught way.

     Nor moon nor stars were out.
They did not dare to tread so soon about,
Though trembling, in the footsteps of the sun.
The light was neither night's nor day's, but one
Which, life-like, had a beauty in its doubt;
And Silence's impassioned breathings round
     Seemed wandering into sound.

     O solemn-beating heart
Of nature! I have knowledge that thou art
Bound unto man's by cords he cannot sever---
And, what time they are slackened by him ever,
So to attest his own supernal part,
Still runneth thy vibration fast and strong,
     The slackened cord along.

     For though we never spoke
Of the grey water anal the shaded rock,---
Dark wave and stone, unconsciously, were fused
Into the plaintive speaking that we used,
Of absent friends and memories unforsook;
And, had we seen each other's face, we had
     Seen haply, each was sad. 

Old Albion sat on a crag of late, 
And sung out—'Ahoy! ahoy!
Long life to the captain, good luck to the mate,
And this to my sailor boy!
Come over, come home,
Through the salt sea foam,
My sailor, my sailor boy.

'Here's a crown to be given away, I ween,
    A crown for my sailor's head,
And the love of the noble dead,
And the fear and fame
Of the island's name
Where my boy was born and bred.

'Content thee, content thee, let it alone,
Thou marked for a choice so rare;
Though treaties be treaties, never a throne
Was proffered for cause as fair.
Yet come to me home,
Through the salt sea foam,
For the Greek must ask elsewhere.

' 'T is pity, my sailor, but who can tell?
Many lands they look to me;
One of these might be wanting a Prince as well,
But that's as hereafter may be.
She raised her white head
And laughed; and she said
'That's as hereafter may be.

'A Threnody for Robert Louis Stevenson


COLD, the dull cold! What ails the sun,
And takes the heart out of the day?
What makes the morning look so mean,
The Common so forlorn and gray?

The wintry city's granite heart
Beats on in iron mockery,
And like the roaming mountain rains,
I hear the thresh of feet go by.

It is the lonely human surf
Surging through alleys chill with grime,
The muttering churning ceaseless floe
Adrift out of the North of time.

Fades, it all fades! I only see
The poster with its reds and blues
Bidding the heart stand still to take
Its desolating stab of news.

That intimate and magic name:
' Dead in Samoa.' . . . Cry your cries,
O city of the golden dome,
Under the gray Atlantic skies!

But I have wander-biddings now.
Far down the latitudes of sun,
An island mountain of the sea,
Piercing the green and rosy zone,

Goes up into the wondrous day.
And there the brown-limbed island men
Are bearing up for burial,
Within the sun's departing ken,

The master of the roving kind.
And there where time will set no mark
For his irrevocable rest,
Under the spacious melting dark,

With all the nomad tented stars
About him, they have laid him down
Above the crumbling of the sea,
Beyond the turmoil of renown.

O all you hearts about the world
In whom the truant gipsy blood,
Under the frost of this pale time,
Sleeps like the daring sap and flood

That dream of April and reprieve!
You whom the haunted vision drives,
Incredulous of home and ease,
Perfection's lovers all your lives!

You whom the wander-spirit loves
To lead by some forgotten clue
For ever vanishing beyond
Horizon brinks for ever new;

The road, unmarked, ordained, whereby
Your brothers of the field and air
Before you, faithful, blind, and glad,
Emerged from chaos pair by pair;

The road whereby you too must come,
In the unvexed and fabled years
Into the country of your dream,
With all your knowledge in arrears!

You who can never quite forget
Your glimpse of Beauty as she passed,
The well-head where her knee was pressed,
The dew wherein her foot was cast;

O you who bid the paint and clay
Be glorious when you are dead,
And fit the plangent words in rhyme
Where the dark secret lurks unsaid;

You brethren of the light-heart guild,
The mystic fellowcraft of joy,
Who tarry for the news of truth,
And listen for some vast ahoy

Blown in from sea, who crowd the wharves
With eager eyes that wait the ship
Whose foreign tongue may fill the world
With wondrous tales from lip to lip;

Our restless loved adventurer,
On secret orders come to him,
Has slipped his cable, cleared the reef,
And melted on the white sea-rim.

O granite hills, go down in blue!
And like green clouds in opal calms,
You anchored islands of the main,
Float up your loom of feathery palms!

For deep within your dales, where lies
A valiant earthling stark and dumb,
This savage undiscerning heart
Is with the silent chiefs who come

To mourn their kin and bear him gifts,—
Who kiss his hand, and take their place,
This last night he receives his friends,
The journey-wonder on his face.

He 'was not born for age.' Ah no,
For everlasting youth is his!
Part of the lyric of the earth
With spring and leaf and blade he is.

'Twill nevermore be April now
But there will lurk a thought of him
At the street corners, gay with flowers
From rainy valleys purple-dim.

O chiefs, you do not mourn alone!
In that stern North where mystery broods,
Our mother grief has many sons
Bred in those iron solitudes.

It does not help them, to have laid
Their coil of lightning under seas;
They are as impotent as you
To mend the loosened wrists and knees.

And yet how many a harvest night,
When the great luminous meteors flare
Along the trenches of the dusk,
The men who dwell beneath the Bear,

Seeing those vagrants of the sky
Float through the deep beyond their hark,
Like Arabs through the wastes of air,—
A flash, a dream, from dark to dark,—

Must feel the solemn large surmise:
By a dim, vast and perilous way
We sweep through undetermined time,
Illumining this quench of clay,

A moment staunched, then forth again.
Ah, not alone you climb the steep
To set your loving burden down
Against the mighty knees of sleep.

With you we hold the sombre faith
Where creeds are sown like rain at sea;
And leave the loveliest child of earth
To slumber where he longed to be.

His fathers lit the dangerous coast
To steer the daring merchant home;
His courage lights the darkling port
Where every sea-worn sail must come.

And since he was the type of all
That strain in us which still must fare,
The fleeting migrant of a day,
Heart-high, outbound for otherwhere,

Now therefore, where the passing ships
Hang on the edges of the noon,
And Northern liners trail their smoke
Across the rising yellow moon,

Bound for his home, with shuddering screw
That beats its strength out into speed,
Until the pacing watch descries
On the sea-line a scarlet seed

Smoulder and kindle and set fire
To the dark selvedge of the night,
The deep blue tapestry of stars,
Then sheet the dome in pearly light,

There in perpetual tides of day,
Where men may praise him and deplore,
The place of his lone grave shall be
A seamark set for evermore,

High on a peak adrift with mist,
And round whose bases, far beneath
The snow-white wheeling tropic birds,
The emerald dragon breaks his teeth. 

The stars are sailing their ship
in the galaxy of open universal route
up above the sky
with a twinkling search light
from one corner to another
throughout night
have they forgotten their path
or some dearest is missing
and they peep below the sky
when the entire lives  is sleeping 
in the lap of mother earth
in a sweet dream
of fine tomorrow
but their search is not finished
the caretaker of earth has now come
with a blazing face
burning all the devil’s mount
all the stars have switched off
their search light
and vanished
waiting for setting down the sun. 

At the highways of woes
a traveller viewed the wind blows, 
as he climb up a fearful trail
on top of a mountain or a hill.
He searched unbearable things
that he wouldn't want to know.
He longed for something unknown
that he wouldn't like to see.
He's cleaving for something unusual
that he wouldn't want to feel.
Now, all the things provided
as he searched on the unprovided! 
What is it then that you see
in your naked eyes as it slips away? 
What is it then that you feel
in your naked skin as it wards away? 
Ah, the only way to a true friend
is the heart with gladness, 
willingness to share what is it
treasured deep in his own senses! In your arms, 
    i am silent earth, 
    inundated by spring rain.

 An avalanche of words
     stifle the throat, 
     your kisses, fresh daisies.

 Butterflies, beating blessed wings
    loudly announce your coming.

 A monsoon of emotions, 
    unannounced, 
    flood my channels

 Your season of now, 
     flew past on the wings of a dragonfly, 
     an eternity of pleasure, 
     persists
     beyond my recollections. 

The bougainvillea branches drooping with flowers, 
Red, mustard, ivory and fushia - riot of colours. 
While the poplars and the gulmohar stand bare, 
What a study in contrast right here 
Just  a glance away from my courtyard, 
Elated and joyous, I said out aloud.

The old leaves have  oh, so gently fallen, 
 Graciously to make room for the new.
The trees are showing signs of life, 
With tender shoots peeping out.

 I muse, What will life be without colours? 
As spring takes over from where autumn left.
A tiny bird is busy building a nest, 
On my clothesline, for the life it carries inside.

It comes at dawn every few minutes, 
With a twig or a dry leaf in its beak, 
I watch with fascination and utter awe, 
As  it flits about and with dexterity, weaves. 

It is the season of change, birth and renewal, 
I too give old thoughts and grudges a quite burial.
As I go about my day I just hum and sing, 
And it fills me with a lightness of being.

I don a multi hued dress to celebrate the season
Spring is in the air, and the mood is truly infectious.

Today is the fifth day of Spring- Basant Panchmi festival








Mamta Agarwal


Finally, it’s time to go, 
All day I’ve pushed peddles with my feet, 
I’ll hurry to the bus stop, 
Being sure to get a good seat.

There, a chance to rest, 
Home, I’m on my way, 
Only to get up tomorrow, 
And put in another day.

Photos, questions and fingerprints, 
Did I commit a crime? 
I distinctly remembered when I boarded, 
Dropping in my dime.

Why give up my seat? 
After working hard all day, 
I thought the fare was the same for all, 
Is there more I have to pay? 

Don’t they know how hard I’ve worked? 
To get this seat I had to rush, 
Now you’re going to tell me, 
Move to the back of the bus.

Wait, I pay my taxes, 
Even go to church and pray, 
They do not have the right, 
To treat Rosa Parks this way.

I never wanted to start a movement, 
Just have a seat on the bus, 
Being treated fairly as an American, 
Why is everyone making such a fuss? 

My name is known throughout the world, 
In history books here and there, 
It really didn’t have to be me you know, 
Just anyone who paid their fare.

And over years later, 
An Icon is my name, 
I’d gladly do it all again, 
Circumstances being the same.

Heaven is my final journey, 
Can’t wait till I get there, 
Knowing I’m going to enjoy the ride, 
I’ve already paid my fare. 

Updated Poem: 

In the lifetime of a wise man
The tree of knowledge stands in wait
Meaningful facts he'll accumulate
More than we could contemplate.

Although in seriousness
With age comes weariness, 
Fretfulness, forgetfulness, 
A kind of dementia hits the
Intelligentsia. 
The power of the brain may wane
Fade and die as years go by.
Knowledge wasted here on earth.
But does knowledge 
Have a second birth
The other side of the
Heavenly Gate

I need a second chance with you as 
We have not spoke in weeks
So tell me this why won’t we talk my love
We hasn’t give our love a second chance 
To grow and stretch out for our hearts 
To explore our love hidden potential
However, our love ends on the second week of 
Our chance of love and I regret the day 
That I let you go but your friend caught my eye 
However, it felt so strong but so wrong 
I still have feelings for you but 
I tried to drown them with her love
Like a broken dam, that floods the cities 
However, it was not as tasteful, caring, or sweet as yours was 
As your glare in your eyes has hypnotized me
I wanted you from the minute your eyes met mines
I look at you like a masterpiece with the smile of Mona Lisa
I can’t let our vibe become faded from our past carried 
Those terrible lies and falsehoods that we suffer from
I would give the world up for you, as I know you are worth fighting for 
Please tell me baby that you still love me 
As in my arms is where you belong as no more hiding the truth from you
This time I am going to give us a better chance at love’s judgment  
Got rid of everything that I know was hurting us both
I love you like the air I breathe in a quiet clean forest, 
The music that hear plays my heart's fulfilled melodies, 
In addition, the way my heart craves for you but never stops
Until your love is handed to me as well as your kiss
As your lips tastes like strawberry kiwis, cherries and peaches
Now you see that even my senses want a second chance with you
So give us a second chance and let us show the world that
A second chance is worth the trust and time for anyone
Who wish to be forgiven or for a new-beginning


When the trains come into strange cities
The citizens come out to meet the strangers.
                                        I love you, Jack, he said
                                        I love you, Jack, he said
                                        At another station.
When passengers come in from strange cities
The citizens come out to help the strangers.
                                        I love you too, I said
                                        I love you too, I said
                                        From another station.
The citizens are kind to passing strangers
And nourish them and kiss their lips in kindness.
                                        I walk the unbelieving streets
                                        I walk the unbelieving streets
                                        In a strange city.
At night in cold new beds the welcomed strangers
Achieve in memory the city's promise.
                                        I wake in love with you
                                        I wake in love with you
                                        At last year's station.
Then say goodbye to citizens and city
Admit this much—that they were kind to strangers.
                                        I leave my love with you
                                        I leave my love with you
                                        In this strange city. 

Within me lies a secret
Who is there to let it loose
Do we want to know this secret
Or should it be forever bound.

Will opening the door reveal
What has been hiding for all time
Or is this just the key
Is there something deeper.

Will we be opening a Pandora’s box
Will it be a detriment to all
Or is it progress we will be unfolding
Something stronger than all time.

Billowing out of my mind are thoughts and feelings
Are they at all important or are they just a dream
Am I trying to make something
From something that is not.

Maybe I should just let it be.   

Like an otter come out and into her own: 
Outside of classes, and outside 
The impenetrable bosque: 
She is now selling fruit to speaking
Dragons: 
While the traffic shuffles unhesitatingly over her
Shoulder: 
She is an angel that doesn’t even realize.
And her eyes are darker and more perfect than the
Known seas, 
And the creatures who live in them, delighting in the
Caesuras, have known my heart, 
Even if they do not care: and when she drives home
For the day, 
She puts me in an unmarked grave- headless, without
Flowers, or smelling of the 
Blown gas of industrial lawnmowers-
And I go home too, and get on my knees and
Pray for this muse, this soul: a secret color
Named Alma. 

Between life and death 
There's another path
Some of us choose to live there 
Away from life there's another place for broken hearts 
 A secret place that helps tired souls to find the peace within their selves 
Thoughts and regrets all meet there 
The place where I open the gate to meet the present with  past 
 The secret place its the loneliness to meet ourselves 
Away from lovers aches 
But with the memories no way to disregard to escape free  
 The secret place there I open my hidden aches 
Away from blamers glance 
My bloody wounds  there take a bit rest


Pink is just a shade of Blue
with Purple in between
And Yellow is a shade of Pink, 
and, the color that is Green, 
I think, is a shade of Yellow too-
And Green, so colorful and clean, 
is just a secret shade of Blue -
so if you asked me if Pink
was also Green
I'd tell you, Yes, it's True.

(March h,A Secret told—
Ceases to be a Secret—then—
A Secret—kept—
That—can appal but One—

Better of it—continual be afraid—
Than it—
And Whom you told it to—beside—I rarely go by bus but when I do
For safety’s sake I choose a seat well back.
Today the bus was crowded like a zoo, 
My seat companion wore a plastic mac, 
He looked quite foreign, dark, and rather nervous.
To break the ice I said "It’s very warm", 
Began to rant and wildly wave his arm.
I looked around but no-one seemed to notice, 
And I am jammed against the window, blocked, 
So can’t get past this madman now at prayer
To calm him down I asked "Why are you here? "
"Suicide bomber", he whispered in my ear.
					ee how a Seed, which Autumn flung down, 
And through the Winter neglected lay, 
Uncoils two little green leaves and two brown, 
With tiny root taking hold on the clay 
As, lifting and strengthening day by day, 
It pushes red branchless, sprouts new leaves, 
And cell after cell the Power in it weaves 
Out of the storehouse of soil and clime, 
To fashion a Tree in due course of time; 
Tree with rough bark and boughs' expansion, 
Where the Crow can build his mansion, 
Or a Man, in some new May, 
Lie under whispering leaves and say, 
"Are the ills of one's life so very bad 
When a Green Tree makes me deliciously glad?" 
As I do now. But where shall I be 
When this little Seed is a tall green Tree

in the inner world of a human being.
It is like a seed hidden
in the secret ground of being.
The spirit unfolds itself
in the inner core
transforming the being
into a new godly existence.

(f or  some of my friends whom  I lost sadly  today) .

  
  . . .  .


for  those whom  are SO holy in my mind, 


 I steal from my thoughts few thoughts, 
 
for whom  called warriors  and poets

 those who  create 

from the end start, from the failure success.. 

whom they have  so odd stories, filled by  

 pain and  long ways  of  trials, 

their aching souls witnessed many  traps. 

they never stop despite  the stabs


their success is the  journey.  the taste 

of that rest after 

walking the long hectic ways.. 

the rest of  the 

bleeding  feet.. 

the taste of 

 admireres   whom with  them so long 
   differ. 



the  demolishing which  build in them

a tower. 

the pure feeling which born from a

suffer, 

the deep vision, the wisdom which heal and recover


Warriors and poets.. do talk while 

they walk.. 

they do not sit or rest, 

 chairs are created for the guests but not for the 

hosts..



.. that day  found my self standing again and alone, 

that moment only i felt again free.. 

so 

happy i was 

soaring and realized that i'm a seed of a 

warrior.. 

perhaps i'm a seed of  a poet

I walked my long way again once again to 

start again,  at the end i sang for the 

freedom.  

my freedom from that 

chair.. it was a few 

moments after my success 

which can be considered as a failure by 

others 

that day
one girl said to me.. 

you are a fish and  have been  thrown to sea 

but that sea rejected me when  discovered that i'm not a fish but  another sea 

what a beauty, what a greatness when you belong to you, when no one own you, when your soul stay always soaring when your soul stay free 

free.. 

free.. 

free


The sound of music, 
Hey! that’s ringing in my ears! 
Tune into the tune.


Blow your own trumpet, 
Lick those lips and give it all, 
Lets blast on the brass.



          Two Haikus


The tides coming in, 
Washing the sand on the beach.
Grains and grains and grains.


Hurry, hurricane.
Forces beyond our control.
Tropical cyclone.


you ;
'Tis strange that she should thus confess it, though 't be true. 

The cars roar through the window
Upsetting the solitude of nothing to do
So we read and rattle the newspaper
That’s not from yesterday and not tomorrow’s.
And maybe we write —
A little poetry if we can, and wait. 

Love asks sacrifice
It is not a mom sis house
Your ego renouncea loud and clear thought
on these shelves which hold worlds words
and unfolds meaning


No man should stand before the moon 
To make sweet song thereon, 
With dandified importance, 
His sense of humor gone.

Nay, let us don the motley cap, 
The jester's chastened mien, 
If we would woo that looking-glass 
And see what should be seen.

O mirror on fair Heaven's wall, 
We find there what we bring. 
So, let us smile in honest part 
And deck our souls and sing.

Yea, by the chastened jest alone 
Will ghosts and terrors pass, 
And fays, or suchlike friendly things, 
Throw kisses through the glass. 

Lips sumptuous you have in a way quiet, 
Excites me to consume them with a kiss
To give my heart a sensational riot
Of penchant wild, draws me into its abyss.
Within is stroked like the wind keen on trees, 
Like the summer at its brightest in June; 
Your tongue, rich like creamy soup made from peas, 
My tongue rubs like fingers petting a prune.
Through the kiss is pleasure marked as crystal, 
Our hearts grasping each other without bar.
Their heat flares as the bang of a pistol, 
Flare rhythmic like erotic guitar.
Savouring you is tense felt so brooded, 
Touch of the kiss is never concluded. 

Lay down your head my little one
Close up your sleep-hung eyes; 
Give up the day, and all that's gone, 
Relinquish earthly ties; 
Let calm reside within your breast
Forget the day's long fight; 
And join with other dreamers
As they slip into the night.

Then I shall be a sentinel
For you, so much adored; 
To care for and protect you
Until you be restored; 
For you are all, and everything
To me, and come the morn'
We'll take the day presented us
All fresh and newly born.A sepal, petal, and a thorn
Upon a common summer's morn—
A flask of Dew—A Bee or two—
A Breeze—a caper in the trees—
And I'm a Rose

I watch Inesilla
Thy window beneath,
Deep slumbers the villa
In night's dusky sheath.

Enamoured I linger,
Close mantled, for thee--
With sword and with guitar,
O look once on me!

Art sleeping? Wilt wake thee
Guitar tones so light?
The argus-eyed greybeard
My swift sword shall smite.

The ladder of ropes
Throw me fearlessly now!
Dost falter? Hast thou, Sweet,
Been false to thy vow?

I watch Inesilla
Thy window beneath,
Deep slumbers the villa
In night's dusky sheath

I.

That was I, you heard last night,
  When there rose no moon at all,
Nor, to pierce the strained and tight
  Tent of heaven, a planet small:
Life was dead and so was light.

	II.

Not a twinkle from the fly,
  Not a glimmer from the worm;
When the crickets stopped their cry,
  When the owls forbore a term,
You heard music; that was I.

	III.

Earth turned in her sleep with pain,
  Sultrily suspired for proof:
In at heaven and out again,
  Lightning!---where it broke the roof,
Bloodlike, some few drops of rain.

	IV.

What they could my words expressed,
  O my love, my all, my one!
Singing helped the verses best,
  And when singing's best was done,
To my lute I left the rest.

	V.

So wore night; the East was gray,
  White the broad-faced hemlock-flowers:
There would be another day;
  Ere its first of heavy hours
Found me, I had passed away.

	VI.

What became of all the hopes,
  Words and song and lute as well?
Say, this struck you---When life gropes
  Feebly for the path where fell
Light last on the evening slopes,

	VII.

One friend in that path shall be,
  To secure my step from wrong;
One to count night day for me,
  Patient through the watches long,
Serving most with none to see.''

	VIII.

Never say---as something bodes---
  So, the worst has yet a worse!
When life halts 'neath double loads,
  Better the taskmaster's curse
Than such music on the roads!

	IX.

When no moon succeeds the sun,
  Nor can pierce the midnight's tent
Any star, the smallest one,
  While some drops, where lightning rent,
Show the final storm begun---

	X.

When the fire-fly hides its spot,
  When the garden-voices fail
In the darkness thick and hot,---
  Shall another voice avail,
That shape be where these are not?

	XI.

Has some plague a longer lease,
  Proffering its help uncouth?
Can't one even die in peace?
  As one shuts one's eyes on youth,
Is that face the last one sees?''

	XII.

Oh how dark your villa was,
  Windows fast and obdurate!
How the garden grudged me grass
  Where I stood---the iron gate
Ground its teeth to let me pass!


'Hey, you whippersnapper, 
I've got my eyes on you! 
If there's homework to be done, 
That is what you will do.

Don't expect to be persnickety, 
Plan on being a model child.
I might seem lenient now, 
But I'm not always this mild.

You won't be lollygagging
Or gallivanting, either.
I'll give you two tough choices.
Your choice can never be neither.'

Uncle Jim was in the Army
For about three hundred years.
He won't take any guff, 
Doesn't tolerate any tears.

It's going to be a long night, 
Probably not much fun.
Uncle Jim's my babysitter.
He's a real life curmudgeon

His face was like a snake's -- wrinkled and loose
And withered--I didn't make you know how glad I was
To have you come and camp here on our land.
I promised myself to get down some day
And see the way you lived, but I don't know!
With a houseful of hungry men to feed
I guess you'd find. . It seems to me
I can't express my feelings any more
Than I can raise my voice or want to lift
My hand (oh, I can lift it when I have to).
Did ever you feel so? I hope you never.
It's got so I don't even know for sure
Whether I am glad, sorry, or anything.
There's nothing but a voice-like left inside
That seems to tell me how I ought to feel,
And would feel if I wasn't all gone wrong.
You take the lake. I look and look at it.
I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water.
I stand and make myself repeat out loud
The advantages it has, so long and narrow,
Like a deep piece of some old running river
Cut short off at both ends. It lies five miles
Straight away through the mountain notch
From the sink window where I wash the plates,
And all our storms come up toward the house,
Drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter.
It took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit
To step outdoors and take the water dazzle
A sunny morning, or take the rising wind
About my face and body and through my wrapper,
When a storm threatened from the Dragon's Den,
And a cold chill shivered across the lake.
I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water,
Our Willoughby! How did you hear of it?
I expect, though, everyone's heard of it.
In a book about ferns? Listen to that!
You let things more like feathers regulate
Your going and coming. And you like it here?
I can see how you might. But I don't know!
It would be different if more people came,
For then there would be business. As it is,
The cottages Len built, sometimes we rent them,
Sometimes we don't. We've a good piece of shore
That ought to be worth something, and may yet.
But I don't count on it as much as Len.
He looks on the bright side of everything,
Including me. He thinks I'll be all right
With doctoring. But it's not medicine--
Lowe is the only doctor's dared to say so--
It's rest I want--there, I have said it out--
From cooking meals for hungry hired men
And washing dishes after them--from doing
Things over and over that just won't stay done.
By good rights I ought not to have so much
Put on me, but there seems no other way.
Len says one steady pull more ought to do it.
He says the best way out is always through.
And I agree to that, or in so far
As that I can see no way out but through--
Leastways for me--and then they'll be convinced.
It's not that Len don't want the best for me.
It was his plan our moving over in
Beside the lake from where that day I showed you
We used to live--ten miles from anywhere.
We didn't change without some sacrifice,
But Len went at it to make up the loss.
His work's a man's, of course, from sun to sun,
But he works when he works as hard as I do--
Though there's small profit in comparisons.
(Women and men will make them all the same.)
But work ain't all. Len undertakes too much.
He's into everything in town. This year
It's highways, and he's got too many men
Around him to look after that make waste.
They take advantage of him shamefully,
And proud, too, of themselves for doing so.
We have four here to board, great good-for-nothings,
Sprawling about the kitchen with their talk
While I fry their bacon. Much they care!
No more put out in what they do or say
Than if I wasn't in the room at all.
Coming and going all the time, they are:
I don't learn what their names are, let alone
Their characters, or whether they are safe
To have inside the house with doors unlocked.
I'm not afraid of them, though, if they're not
Afraid of me. There's two can play at that.
I have my fancies: it runs in the family.
My father's brother wasn't right. They kept him
Locked up for years back there at the old farm.
I've been away once--yes, I've been away.
The State Asylum. I was prejudiced;
I wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there;
You know the old idea--the only asylum
Was the poorhouse, and those who could afford,
Rather than send their folks to such a place,
Kept them at home; and it does seem more human.
But it's not so: the place is the asylum.
There they have every means proper to do with,
And you aren't darkening other people's lives--
Worse than no good to them, and they no good
To you in your condition; you can't know
Affection or the want of it in that state.
I've heard too much of the old-fashioned way.
My father's brother, he went mad quite young.
Some thought he had been bitten by a dog,
Because his violence took on the form
Of carrying his pillow in his teeth;
But it's more likely he was crossed in love,
Or so the story goes. It was some girl.
Anyway all he talked about was love.
They soon saw he would do someone a mischief
If he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended
In father's building him a sort of cage,
Or room within a room, of hickory poles,
Like stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,--
A narrow passage all the way around.
Anything they put in for furniture
He'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on.
So they made the place comfortable with straw,
Like a beast's stall, to ease their consciences.
Of course they had to feed him without dishes.
They tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded
With his clothes on his arm--all of his clothes.
Cruel--it sounds. I 'spose they did the best
They knew. And just when he was at the height,
Father and mother married, and mother came,
A bride, to help take care of such a creature,
And accommodate her young life to his.
That was what marrying father meant to her.
She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful
By his shouts in the night. He'd shout and shout
Until the strength was shouted out of him,
And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.
He'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,
And let them go and make them twang until
His hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow.
And then he'd crow as if he thought that child's play--
The only fun he had. I've heard them say, though,
They found a way to put a stop to it.
He was before my time--I never saw him;
But the pen stayed exactly as it was
There in the upper chamber in the ell,
A sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.
I often think of the smooth hickory bars.
It got so I would say--you know, half fooling--
"It's time I took my turn upstairs in jail"--
Just as you will till it becomes a habit.
No wonder I was glad to get away.
Mind you, I waited till Len said the word.
I didn't want the blame if things went wrong.
I was glad though, no end, when we moved out,
And I looked to be happy, and I was,
As I said, for a while--but I don't know!
Somehow the change wore out like a prescription.
And there's more to it than just window-views
And living by a lake. I'm past such help--
Unless Len took the notion, which he won't,
And I won't ask him--it's not sure enough.
I 'spose I've got to go the road I'm going:
Other folks have to, and why shouldn't I?
I almost think if I could do like you,
Drop everything and live out on the ground--
But it might be, come night, I shouldn't like it,
Or a long rain. I should soon get enough,
And be glad of a good roof overhead.
I've lain awake thinking of you, I'll warrant,
More than you have yourself, some of these nights.
The wonder was the tents weren't snatched away
From over you as you lay in your beds.
I haven't courage for a risk like that.
Bless you, of course, you're keeping me from work,
But the thing of it is, I need to be kept.
There's work enough to do--there's always that;
But behind's behind. The worst that you can do
Is set me back a little more behind.
I sha'n't catch up in this world, anyway.
I'd rather you'd not go unless you must. 

Three things make earth unquiet
And four she cannot brook
The godly Agur counted them
And put them in a book --
Those Four Tremendous Curses
With which mankind is cursed;
But a Servant when He Reigneth
Old Agur entered first.
An Handmaid that is Mistress
We need not call upon.
A Fool when he is full of Meat
Will fall asleep anon.
An Odious Woman Married
May bear a babe and mend;
But a Servant when He Reigneth
Is Confusion to the end.

His feet are swift to tumult,
His hands are slow to toil,
His ears are deaf to reason,
His lips are loud in broil.
He knows no use for power
Except to show his might.
He gives no heed to judgment
Unless it prove him right.

Because he served a master
Before his Kingship came,
And hid in all disaster
Behind his master's name,
So, when his Folly opens
The unnecessary hells,
A Servant when He Reigneth
Throws the blame on some one else.

His vows are lightly spoken,
His faith is hard to bind,
His trust is easy boken,
He fears his fellow-kind.
The nearest mob will move him
To break the pledge he gave --
Oh, a Servant when he Reigneth
Is more than ever slave!A Shade upon the mind there passes
As when on Noon
A Cloud the mighty Sun encloses
Remembering

That some there be too numb to notice
Why give if Thou must take away
The Loved

I said unto myself, if I were dead,
What would befall these children? What would be
Their fate, who now are looking up to me
For help and furtherance? Their lives, I said,
Would be a volume wherein I have read
But the first chapters, and no longer see
To read the rest of their dear history,
So full of beauty and so full of dread.
Be comforted; the world is very old,
And generations pass, as they have passed,
A troop of shadows moving with the sun;
Thousands of times has the old tale been told;
The world belongs to those who come the last,
They will find hope and strength as we have done. 

I am a shadow
that born by the ray
though few that heed

I live in the darkness
even when the ray is lying
I still be there, still faithful

watching for your steps
keeping each your hopes
until you find
the next ray that come

earthzcity, wonder if details matter, 
it happened so long ago, 
is it really important? 
do i really need to know, 
who and why? 
you a shadow from the past, 
but you haunt my mind, 
just knowing part of what you did, 
makes me wonder why i trusted you, 
i begged not to see you, 
but my begging wasn't strong enough, 
not without a reason why, 
so i continue to be abused, 
i was scared of you, 
is that the reason you remain, 
being a shadow in my thoughts? 
i blocked you out, 
just like the pain, 
no longer have a face, 
but yet you remain a mystery, 
in my past, 
i'm starting to think, 
it should be where you stay, 
no need to open a can of worms, 
that don't need to be open, 
for me to understand the whole story. 

Close on the edge of a midsummer dawn
In troubled dreams I went from land to land,
Each seven-colored like the rainbow's arc,
Regions where never fancy's foot had trod
Till then; yet all the strangeness seemed not strange,
At which I wondered, reasoning in my dream
With twofold sense, well knowing that I slept.
At last I came to this our cloud-hung earth,
And somewhere by the seashore was a grave,
A woman's grave, new-made, and heaped with flowers;
And near it stood an ancient holy man
That fain would comfort me, who sorrowed not
For this unknown dead woman at my feet.
But I, because his sacred office held
My reverence, listened; and 'twas thus he spake:--
'When next thou comest thou shalt find her still
In all the rare perfection that she was.
Thou shalt have gentle greeting of thy love!
Her eyelids will have turned to violets,
Her bosom to white lilies, and her breath
To roses. What is lovely never dies,
But passes into other loveliness,
Star-dust, or sea-foam, flower, or winged air.
If this befalls our poor unworthy flesh,
Think thee what destiny awaits the soul!
What glorious vesture it shall wear at last!'
While yet he spoke, seashore and grave and priest
Vanished, and faintly from a neighboring spire
Fell five slow solemn strokes upon my ear.
Then I awoke with a keen pain at heart,
A sense of swift unutterable loss,
And through the darkness reached my hand to touch
Her cheek, soft-pillowed on one restful palm--
To be quite sure

A shady friend for torrid days
Is easier to find
Than one of higher temperature
For frigid hour of mind.

The vane a little to the east
Scares muslin souls away;
If broadcloth breasts are firmer
Than those of organdy,

Who is to blame? The weaver?
Ah! the bewildering thread!
The tapestries of paradise!
So notelessly are made

More callous than a dig
More back-breaking than a slam

Amber as a tale, more amber than landlord
Everlasting as an auto-da-fe, more everlasting than raft
Travelled as an air, more travelled than breeze
Dateless as a wing, more dateless than cup

After they have received us at dawn, knowing, striving, like im-petuous shafts.
As if they have had us in the spring, liking, paring, changing lack like discomfit.
While they have had us sometimes, growing, carrying, like an im-mense bee.
Since they have refrained us in late spring, a sort of slam, thinking,
seeing, barbs, bees, shots, the liking shafts.
Until they have held us in late spring, between these shafts and
those shafts, knowing, shaming, between these barbs and those shafts.

As if they have had us in autumn, holding, meeting, like docile barbs.
Until they have fed us in autumn, lapping, complaining, dry as a spot.
Until in early spring they have run us, saying, declining, like a hand.
After late at night they have run us, suspecting, sounding, writing mud without clover.

How they babbled us,
those bold enterprises!
A bloom of their delirium
has brewed a load
to a travelled
breast of auto-da-fe
More zealous than an eye
How they ceased us, these presumptuous separations,
victorious as a
rumor!
The warmth borrowing our nerve, our standing
face


What you are to me no one on earth 
No one has loved they way I love 
When I rose for the act to play 
Your glowing face in the crowd 
Down I move in the gown of Romeo 
The Juliet is here in the crowd 
A live act as I hold you in arms 
What acts what poems what costume 
The play is over as it is in real 
Begun with end and the waltz 
Many a tangos on the floor of life 
Look I to thee with my arm extended 
One last dance before you leave


I made the ultimate sacrifice.

I left with no where to go.

All I have left are diluted dreams and material acquisitions.

My belongings represent a closed chapter of my life.

Shards of my love lay scattered around our world.

Half truths shattered my belief.

Our crops failed to flourish on barren land.

I was left to bleed new life into our land.

I must dig deep to carry on. 

Our old coat lost, unto new arms I go. 
The Cross—my seal at baptism—spread below 
Does, by that form, into an Anchor grow. 
Crosses grow Anchors ; bear, as thou shouldest do 
Thy Cross, and that Cross grows an Anchor too. 
But He that makes our Crosses Anchors thus, 
Yet may I, with this, my first serpents hold ; 
The serpent may, as wise, my pattern be ; 
My poison, as he feeds on dust, that's me. 
And, as he rounds the earth to murder sure, 
My death he is, but on the Cross, my cure. 
Crucify nature then, and then implore 
All grace from Him, crucified there before ; 
Then all is Cross, and that Cross Anchor grown ; 
This seal's a catechism, not a seal alone. 
Under that little seal great gifts I send, 
Works, and prayers, pawns, and fruits of a friend. 
And may that saint which rides in our great seal, 
To you who bear his name,* great bounties deal

Balance all in all
a snail's pace

A need for love
but found in all the wrong places.
Place, a romance in Manhattan.{pt.lter}Just shut up already about herbal remedies, I told her.
This was on Valentines Day, hours before Sally fed 
my dog some herbal medication
and he brewed butt coffee 
and lost it all over my house after she left.
When I came home greeted by brown valentines
on my shoes, rug, and - omigod - headphones, 
I had to walk around outside to calm down 
before I picked up the phone.
I expected her to claim it was good 
for the dog to clean out his system.
But she surprised me, apologized and 
came over, did a pretty good clean-up, 
I did have to throw out the shoes 
and there was no way I was going to 
use those headphones again.
So she did okay.
I broke up with her anyway.
Find an herbal remedy for that, bitch! 
No, I didn’t say that, 
but we did break up the following year
on Valentines Day. 

Man is making you
bigger and bigger
man in turn is becoming
smaller and smaller

If i have to be made
bigger and bigger
the simple logic is
man is also growing bigger

You are man's physical growth
i meant his mental growth
today
i could glide down the highway at m/hr
to enter a factory which is pitch dark
without power
i could reach office soon and be ablle to do nothin
tomorrow.
the highway itself could become barren
fearing a missile from foreign
is missile also your counterpart
designed for mass killing? 

see
IAM JUST INFRASTRUCTURE
iam the same everywhere
if iam at road
i would remain so forever
i never grow on my own
regarding.  man's mental growth
i don't know
you seem to be asking the right questions
to the wrong person
{infrastructure leaves}

see
even the 'dumb' infrastucture knows
i was asking the right questions
WHO IS THE RIGHT PERSONYou that on Stars do look,
Arrest not there your sight,
Though Natures fairest Book,
And signed with propitious light;
Our Blessing now is more Divine,
Then Planets that at Noon did shine.

To thee alone be praise,
From whom our Joy descends,
Thou Chearer of our Days,
Of Causes first, and last of Ends;
To thee this May we sing, by whom
Our Roses from the Lilies bloom.

Upon this Royal Flower,
Sprung from the chastest Bed, 
Thy glorious sweetness shower,
And first let Myrtles Crown his Head;
Then Palms and Lawrels wreath'd between;
But let the Cypress late be seen.

And so succeeding men,
When they the fulness see
Of this our Joy, shall then
In consort joyn as well as we, 
To celebrate his Praise above,
That spreads our Land with fruits of Love. 

Started with meetings and greetings
Talked a lot in few sublime seatings
When I asked her name
She told very soon
My name is moon
I asked what do you want and why
She told me with a shy, sky
My dream is to fly so high
When I asked when you will meet next
She remained silent and later text
During the dawn of Doomsday
I thought and pondered all day
She had told with eyes filled of tear
I asked from what you fear my dear
She expressed the consequences of love
I thought she must have experienced love
Wanted to know who hurt her feeling
The last question shattered my dreaming
I enquired her whom do you hate
She responded without any late
It's you and only you
Go out of my life and view
The love story ended in few days 
I am penning it in a mood of craze

{Poem written during stay Patna, Bihar in the December of OH Edgar my friend, 
 my morose brother
Thine rhyme doth touch the heart like no other
with your quick and wily pen; 
What hurts were you trying to mend  
Loneliness was your domain
A broken hearted lover
Forever pining in vain

Isolation, lose and pain
And joys so high
With them you can reach the sky

On this one thought I shall ponder evermore
"What fate befell the lovely Lenore? "
Edgar, Dear Edgar
A life of turmoil spilled across countless pages
Your sorrows, a gift to the ages


Seen the cut surrounded by dry blood. Must have irritated it through the crashing all around me. Wipe it dry, clean, but where’s the fun in that. Avoid exacerbation yet still suffer in excess.

Why not make the pain, the sorrow poor out, hopefully there won’t be anything left inside. Gripping tightly, stab the wound over my heart back open; rip back quickly to greater irritate the skin.

And watch the blood poor forth, slowly; and watch as it runs off the skin into the cracks and crevices of joints and muscle, fold of skin, like a stream lips over a bed of rocks on the shallow ground. But wish it was more like a waterfall, crashing, deafening sounds if you get close enough.  

Now sit back, feel the pain overcoming; not a pain from the wound, but a pain from inside. As all muscles tense, the body becomes rigid. Somewhere inside, stomach churns, as it sweetly burns throughout, as the heart let blood free out of veins and arteries. It becomes warm, yet hurts like a sore from overwork. 

And blink once, twice, not sure what’s happening now. All light in the visible spectrum of the eye disappearing as the contrast greatens: all darks become darker, all lights become lighter. And until these all blur, it’s not black, but it is surely the absence of all color.

Fear I may have made a mistake. And hearing too. The sounds so crisp before grow higher and higher to their piercing frequency of which my ears cannot comprehend. Now lost, just a muffled drone; even my own voice has lost volume.

Yet I knew the answer all along and avoid it, just let this of what I could not have foreseen overcome me in my grief. This isn’t what I wanted, not what anyone wanted. 

PLEASE DON’T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES. DO NOT KILL YOURSELF. EVEN WHEN I AM GONE, I’LL KNOW I MADE THE WRONG CHOICE. 

I never really knew what it meant to live
I thought I had a chance
I thought I stood a chance
Against the world
But everything was really spinning
Out of control in vertigo and there were no more better 
Things to come
So I went up to my bedroom
Arsenal in hand
Of all the happy things I needed
Before I was going to die
I took a pen, and some paper, knives, a gun, some pills and I was going to succeed with my plan

Every night, I’d take that pen
And write a letter to each of my "friends"
Telling them that I was to go
In my heart
It burned out
It burned out
Onto each page
"Don’t look for me
I’m going I’m gone, I can’t carry on
I just want things to end my way."

Playing Russian roulette with myself
Listening to 
While holding a In my hand with a smile
And bleeding while the knives
Jabbed out of my arm
Taking pills so suicidal
And I did not
Take note or see
Or read the label
On the bottle that said "Warning
Do not take more three
In a twenty-four hour period"

That fateful night, it felt the same
Nothing I did could kill the pain
So I took that gun in hand
And my brains
They burst out
They burst out
Of my head
I wasn’t meant 
For anything more than this simple score
Cruel world:  and I got none

Don’t look for me
I’m going I’m gone, I can’t carry on
I just wanted things to end my way


They looked

to me like

autumn leaves

struggling to

hang on


Till it

dawned on me

they were

robbins

rehearsing 

spring's song



yet long in sweet prose; 
barely peering above unkempt weeds
beauty becomes its silent words, speaking 
to humanities most basic needs; 
summers simple sensation rising
up and above winters silence
our souls for to enliven; 
though many shall not pause here to see
I do deeply appreciate this

I was searching for a friend 
And found none so good enough..
To understand my heart 
To lend a shoulder to lean


Day heaves darkness out of sight.
The remaining trees on this ordinary
street seem scattered, haphazard.
Disease has claimed so many of them.
They are so much older than us, 
truly survivors, probably much stronger.
They wait in their stolid silence.
The bloom will come later, 
but this later needs no help from us: 
it blossoms by itself, 
in due time. And then the city
will live again in its summer glory.

Our street is quiet in the morning.
A gray cat sleeps on our front steps
until I shoo him away. Barely visible, 
birds linger in the branches hanging over
our deck. Inside it is quiet as well.
The house is big, big enough
for a family, but there are only two
of us living here now. It once held a family
of five, but that is another story. 
We have been busy in the way of
new homeowners everywhere. Next box 

We painted the walls in every room, 
carpeted the floors, put bright prints
of paintings by Monet in the living room, 
furnished it with glittering things. And
everyday I remind myself I don't believe
in ghosts. But he shadows me. Just past sixty, 
he lumbered across the floors we've covered, 
looked out the kitchen windows we've scrubbed
spotless, woke up to the same light streaming
into the kitchen. And I remind myself
I don't believe.  A suicide leaves no trace, he
has erased himself. And we have so much more to do.

Golden Eagle. .[Eagles: Hunting and Caring for young]

A Golden Eagle stands tall upon its perch, 
with keen eyes, for its next victim to search.
Suddenly it spreads wings, is off with a lurch, 
sweeping low o'er groves of aspen and birch.

A jackrabbit stirs near a clump of brush.
Silently toward it the eagle does rush.
The rabbit's life-ending cry breaks the hush.
Too late! The eagle, its backbones does crush.

With rabbit in tow it flies to its nest
where its chick gobbles warm handouts with zest.
With its mate the parent shares all the rest, 
preparing themselves for the next hunting quest.

                 Souls

I wonder if monkeys have souls.
Their DNA and ours are almost identical—by percent! 
Some say ninety-eight! 
Deoxyribonucleic acid is neither charade nor pretense
Do monkeys wonder if we have souls? 

And if monkeys do have souls, what about
Ranger—my wonderful childhood canine brother? 
‘Cause he seemed often more human than people
And displayed more brains than many.

Dogs enjoy a heavenly patron—Saint Roch
A Frenchman
Who died in 
Wouldn't he lead all the good dogs in? 

If my soul does enter heaven-
As unlikely a premise as that might be-
If Ranger didn't come bounding to greet me. 
It wouldn't be truly heaven, you see.

And if monkeys and dogs have souls
What about cats? —Does Ace have a soul? 
I'd like to think so—but I really don't know.
‘Cause one doesn't know where to stop.

Cats also enjoy a patron—Saint Gertrude de Nivelle
A Belgian who died in 
Cats would thus seem to have a free pass in.
And that would indeed be swell.

But cats being somewhat devilish, 
I wouldn't so much expect to see
Ace's presence there.
He was a bad boy anyway
But perhaps St. Gertrude wouldn't care.

Elephants and horses, possibly
Giraffes, hippos; maybe- who knows? 
Cobras, rats, and crocodiles; probably not. 
(There is no patron saint of rats!)                     

I find these metaphysical questions
So fascinating! 
I wonder if humans have souls!

           Please No More

And so he wrote it on the message board, 
I saw it there upon the message board, 
I ventured to ask the owner of the store, 
'Who wrote this message of ‘No More? ''
'A man came by here, a drifter, a bum
down in his luck, desperate, and glum.'
'Why keep it there? ' I dare then to ask, 
'I cannot bare to do this simple task, 
By all means do it yourself if you wish, 
Some motions of the hand swish, swish, swish, 
And the words will at last all disappear, 
But first this much I feel you must hear, 
Before that desperate man left my store, 
I asked him what he meant by ‘No more, '
His reply was neither fast nor too slow, 
It was forthright, sincere, and full of woe, 
I ask for others not just myself.
Please no more famine; please no more drought, 
It's not just me I am thinking about.
Please no more tornadoes, quakes, and flood, 
We are all just made of flesh and blood.
Please no more murder, rape, or abuse.
We all have some purpose and some use.
And after the owner said this to me, 
the board's eraser he handed to me.
Some motions of the hand swish, swish, swish
But how can I erase that man's one wish? 
So I handed the eraser back, 
I thanked the owner for his great tact.
I said my goodbye and left that store, 
I came home and looked at my front door, 
Took a paper, a pen and wrote it down, 
the very same words I read back in town, 
And as I took tape and stuck the paper on, 
I knew that I wasn't the only one
who took a paper and wrote it down.
It couldn't just be me and this one town.



 Boy And A Frog (Kids Stuff)                  

The great, green gob
was opened wide
and a wriggling worm
was fed inside.

The boy said, 'Mum, 
the frog he comes
and sees me every day, 
but a grass snake lurks
and slyly works
his slithers by the way'.

Then the snake, like lightning, 
makes a strike.
The boy he quickly starts
and jaws around
the great, green gob
are gently eased apart.

Now frog and snake
their freedom take
from the boy
with a pounding heart.

  Love and Tears


A breath of a breeze

Tousles my hair

As moss laden trees

Soften sun's glare



Jasmine vines twined

'Round the old wooden post

And upward they climbed

To heaven almost



Heavy with fragrance

As sweet as your heart

I stood in the garden

Till day did depart


The scent caused a sigh

And broken heart fears

The flower's a sign

Of lost Love and Tears

     Beautiful Stranger




You are no fool to me
Because everything you do is so perfect
A mirror is just an illusion
Let us break it along with the rules! 
Boys like you are debonair
So raw and so real
You wear your heart on your sleeve
But at the same time
You carry the weight of the world on your shoulders
I enjoy making love to my art
I often wonder what it would be like to leave everything behind
And start a whole new life with a beautiful stranger
My emotions are divinely connected to yours
Therefore the gods shall surrender
And your tears and my tears
Shall make a flowing river.

We are both strange
Yes we are
And I do not care what the world may think! 
I am beautiful
And you are beautiful
We are beautiful strangers.

            Sitting Quietly

When I feel love is no longer inside me
I walk with empty thoughts to a hill top tree.
Whilst I sit there peacefully, and wait for the breeze to whisper, 
I try to write something profound on a scrap of paper.
The early morning mist that once hid the land and trees, 
slowly dissipate and recedes.
With a rising sun, it's not long before I get a clearer view.
Everything in life has a meaning, mine would always be one with you.

             Heaven's Delight

Insects drawn by an outside light
I hear sounds of cicadas and animals at night.
I feel the warmth of a gentle evening breeze, 
Glass of wine in hand, that is making me merry indeed
I see a myriad of stars above shining bright
with no moon, it makes for an awesome sight.
Can people honestly believe we're alone in the universe, 
when there's an abundance of life here on earth? 
With an almost infinite number of stars and galaxies, 
discovering alien life elsewhere, how sensational would that be? 
Such a probability may exist using a link of the mind, 
so I go search the universe for our nearest alien kind.
Travelling faster than light and at the speed of thought
it's not long before I find what I'm looking for.
From a distance, I see white clouds, land and deep blue seas
there's even has a moon like ours - how extraordinary! 
But as I descend through its atmosphere and weather, 
I see myself resting on a patio - I'm glad my soul and me are together!

[War] Boy In An Envelope. .. [War (Vietnam 'conflict') : a parent's loss; condolences; VERY LONG, but worth the time]




The long envelope was addressed to Mr. Robert K. Hess.
One corner was torn away. .. 

and it lacked a return address.
I'd just received it that day, with a batch of others; 
it was a light mail-day; some days the volume smothers.

I opened up the envelope, what was left of it, and read.
'Dear Mr. Hess, 
Sorry this comes so late. I know your son is dead.'

I caught my breath. I'd received a similar letter years ago, 
but this one contained a photo also, which caused my tears to flow.

The photo, black and white, showed a father with his son.
Each was dressed in camouflage, and each carried. .. 

a deer gun.
On the back was a name and address, the same as envelope.
And written in pencil it said 'Me and Dad, hunting antelope.'

Memories of my son now swept rapidly over me.
There were about ten pages, handwritten, staring at me now.
I could not make myself read it yet. My head did slowly bow.

The next day I took it up again, with very mixed feelings indeed.
But my mind and soul both seemed to feel, the letter I might need.

'My name is Hank' the letter said. 'I knew your son in NAM.
This photo of you and your son, for years has helped keep me calm.'

I stared at the photo for a while. Did my son look like that long ago? 
I scanned the letter and found no return address. The letter, I was about to throw.
But I couldn't do it! I had to read it someday. Again I set it aside.
Ten years I've been without a son, but, for him, I'm still filled with pride.

It took a week before I read some more. I had plenty more to do.
I thought reading the long letter might help, the parent-child bond, renew.

'I've enclosed Tom's dog tags. He gave them to me before he died.
I should have turned them in but I didn't, and for two days, at night, I cried.
Tom was my buddy for six months; we shared more than you want to know.
It wasn't ALL bad in The NAM. Once we saw a live comedy show.
He was a bit of a crazy kid, who at crazy times would sing a song.
He spoke highly of you, though he said you didn't always get along.'

The letter went on and on. I was tempted several times to quit.
Sometimes, due to some torn off page corners, I missed a little bit.
Yes, there'd been corners torn off of pages, and of the envelope too.
Dog tags were missing; through the open envelope corner I suppose they flew.

Hank spoke of a visit to Saigon, and of the oppressive heat, 
of villagers who'd had legs blown off, and meals they had to eat.
He did NOT mention drugs, nor the girls I imagine they'd sampled, 
nor TOO much of fighting, nor of anything or anybody they may have trampled.

He mentioned seeing a cobra one day and he mentioned the sounds at night.
He said much of their time there was boring. Beer came by helicopter flight.
There were church services held in 'the field'. They burned much of their shit.
The few times they had enemy contact, each soldier tried. .. 

to not 'get hit'.

'Part of the year has terrible rains. They call them a 'wet' monsoon.
One of the few things like in the States, was the stars at night and the moon.
Some of us (just a few)              wrote regularly to folks back home.
Some were concerned more with leech removal and having a good lice comb.

'I spent a second tour in The NAM after your son died. Was I nuts? 
Partly, your son's death was why I stayed. I wanted to kick some V. 

C. butts.
I got my chance in my seventeenth month there. I got two gooks, but they got ME.
I lost an arm and one eye, but my medical care is free.

'I've also had flashbacks of being hit, or those I killed, and of your son.
If I could rule the world now. .. 

I'd get rid of every bomb, mortar, and gun.
One good thing, I guess, came out of that mess. I met my dear wife Susie.
She took care of me in Walter Reed. I've got a son, Tom; he is a doozy.

'I've debated telling you how your son died. Now I guess I will.
It was not drugs or suicide. .. 

as happened to some. It happened on a hill.
I've heard Tom's listed as 'Missing In Action', but I tell you he did die.
But I don't know if I can say his death was needed. No, I will not lie.

'We were ordered to take a hill overlooking a 'strategic valley'.
We were warned not to commit any 'atrocities' like was done by Lt. Calley.
Maybe we did, and maybe we didn't. It was not clear who the enemy was.
When we were ordered to take the hill, we did as a 'good soldier' does.

'We were told there were NVA and VC and maybe Chinese on the hill.
We were told to advance cautiously, but to proceed at will.
We kept in touch with the home base until our radio operator was shot.
The radio was 'killed' too, so we were a bit 'in the dark'; ours was a sorry lot.

'Our platoon started with forty men, most as young as Tom and me.
By the time we'd gotten off the hill, I think we were down to twenty-three.
Halfway up Tom got hit in the chest, I think from machine gun fire, 
but he could have been hit by a sniper bullet; treetop snipers could get much higher.

'I was ten feet away and I went and cradled his head.
He gave me his tags, which I'm sending to you, but in a few minutes he was dead.'

By now I was choking, and my tears were soaking the page; I stopped.
I wondered if my son died with a buddy, with his head up-propped.
The next day, after a sleepless night, I returned anxiously to the letter.
I thought a day's rest would prepare me for letter's end, but I did not do much better.

'I know, sir, some war movies show soldiers carrying their dead away, 
but, I hope you'll believe me, on THAT hill THAT day, there was.   

NO damn way.
You wouldn't have gotten your son's body back; I'd probably have lost mine.
I hope you'll forgive me, sir. I hope, with my decision, you'll be fine.'

Once again I hesitated, with page in hand, but I could not stop reading now.
I grabbed more tissues and drank some water, and to the end I did plow.

'Our forces took the hill at last. .. 

after it was mostly destroyed.
To accomplish this, however, it was carpet bombed and napalm was employed.
I don't really know if they looked for Tom. The hill was 'held'.   

for a few months.
That's the way things went sometimes.   

for us U. 

S. Army grunts.

'I haven't given you my return address; it was hard enough, as is.
to write to you at long last, and give you what, for Tom, once were his.
I know he cherished the photo; I took it from him when he died.
The dog tags have been a comfort for me many nights when I have cried.
But I'm on a new med now, from the VA doctor, to calm my nerves at night.
They seem to be working and I thought you should have what was Tom's. It's right! 

'I hope this envelope reaches you safely. I hope you haven't moved.
I hope you believe my story, and, that Tom had a NAM buddy, this proved.
With my sincere condolences on the loss of your son.
Sincerely, Hank

p. 

s. I'll remember him each time my boy's little hand, on mine, does yank.'





My eyes were red and tired by now, but all my tears had dried.
I'm sorry I failed to find a return address. My boss will know I tried.
My name is not Mr. Hess. My son's name was Ron, not Tom.
Ron died, I'm told, in ' when his patrol was hit by 
. 

an errant bomb.

I work in a Post Office Dead Letter Office where we get our share of mail.
I know many, hearing of my job, will think 'Post Office? ', and then think 'snail'.
Each day I look at mail pieces marked 'undeliverable, return to sender'.
Hank's envelope came here to be opened, as no return address he did tender.

Sometimes we have good luck and the mail finds its way back home.
Today we'll send, to the waste bin, this heartbreaking, belated ‘tome'.

[My name is Rose Cranston. Ron was when he died. I miss him.]

             Eternal Thirst


This thirst for love is my heart's torment, 
How can I calm these raging fears
When the fire of love's thirst burns like the sun, 
And the blaze is stoked by my tears? 

My eternal thirst. . will it be quenched? 
My heart's parched, lying in the dust, 
It longs to leap into glistening waves, 
It pleads for the tide's rapturous thrust

Eternal thirst lurks in the darkness, 
Seeking shadows in empty streets, 
And finding its way to my room each night, 
It softly cries on satin sheets

Eternal thirst, my heart knows you well, 
You long for a kiss wet with dew, 
But one warm embrace would still make you smile, 
Your demands are so small and few

When will my thirst be satiated? 
I choke on the dust of despair, 
And a sigh of weariness leaves my lips
As I fall to my knees in prayer

Eternal thirst, the sun's almost set, 
You're waning, like a smoldering fire, 
Soon, on winter's wind you'll drift away, 
Leaving not a trace of desire

My thirst for love. .. jaded memories
That ride on the wings of despair, 
A song of poets, a dream of fools, 
Peace!
when longing breathes its last air

            In Vain

With no cover ups, let me be frank
At times my mind goes utterly blank
When I sit down to write a poem
From topic to topic, my mind does roam
But nothing comes to spark off a rhyme
Often I feel the words do not chime
Today as I sat down to write something
I ended up conjuring nothing

No thoughts came to stir up my brain
And no topic I found save my strain
But I wasn't ready to willfully give up
And waited impatient for my mind to clear up
I thought I shall settle with ‘Compassion'
But alas, it was charged with no passion

The urge to write had grown into a fad
And I felt I was growing altogether mad
Plagued by a fiery fancy to express
And a tormenting desire unable to suppress
With a mental state somewhat fierce
I climbed up and down the stairs

I stood upside down and raked my head
So that a little poem, into it would be fed
Feeling dizzy, I stood suddenly upright
But on my head hung a heavy weight
I poured some water over my head
But knew my fever hadn't fled
Madly pacing across the room
I tripped and fell down on a broom
Rising, I screamed with all my might
Making the household ring in fright
‘What the hell is it? ' I did shout
And wriggled in pain as from gout
In mad frenzy, I ran round the house
No one knew the reason for my fuss
Soon it dawned on me that I needed some rest
For I was far more than stressed
So I sat down and closed my eyes
Thinking, attempting to squeeze out a poem is unwise

I don't know how long I sat in meditation
On waking up I got a fresh direction
From the grip of an entangling rigour
I restored my sanity and vigour

The sun had gone out of sight
And the moon was beautiful and bright
It was already growing late
And I put off my futile fight

       Feeding The Fire

Why is there no one here for me, 
No companion for my heart? 
I'm tired of pretending, wearing this mask, 
Too long have I played the part

How can a heart feel so displaced, 
Not knowing where it should be; 
Even a bird, lost in its flight
Finds comfort in a welcoming tree

The sun and stars have been tended to, 
Their courses have all been charted; 
But yet I wander, lost in a fog, 
Hope for guidance long departed

The decay of happiness is choking me, 
I'm drowning in my own tears; 
Still, I wait for The Light to come
And guide me through happier spheres

But my pilgrimage is almost over, 
For my hunger and thirst - no relief! 
So I'm burning my robe and my sandals, 
Feeding the fire with all my Beliefs!

                  Sugar Man

My teeth that used to bite have long lost the fight.
My hair that once was gray has now become white.
My eyesight is cloudy yet my liver spots shine bright.
I can barely walk two blocks before my knees give out.

The only things older than me are the bills in my pocket.
One sultry look from you baby and I'm off like a rocket.
Just please keep the machines hooked up to the socket, 
And maybe I'll teach you how to play the stock market.

I'll treat you like the princess your father always said you were.
I'll lavish you with expensive jewels, car, clothes, and fur.
I'll take you to fancy dinner parties from here all the way to Japan.
You'll never have to cook, clean, or work for this sugar man!

             Last Trip

I was a full day dead and quite content
My last word and testament has been sent
I lay in my coffin as they passed me by
They walked past in silence, never asking Why? 

My heart was light in my quiet repose
In the air was the fragrance of white rose
Tears glistened on cheeks in candle light
But they all knew that my rest was right

Long years were past and everything done
I've spent many days under the sun
I wanted to go, no reason to stay
I just needed time to find the way

Children and grand children and great ones too
Family left behind totaled quite a few
Friends from my youth have already left
Those still here are have a younger zest

My soul is at rest like a cool summer day
The last heat of life has gone away
Passion's twilight has come to rest
Like a mountain spring washing my breast

It is time to go with no regret
I leave behind not a single debt
It's been a full day since my last breath
Now for my last trip to the land of death

They carry my coffin to my earthly home
And sprinkle on my lid rich dark loam
No child in slumber could be more content
Quite content that my life was well spent

         Like A Coin


Like a coin I roll down the path of mortal life
Wrapped around me my eternity
A silent Witness enjoying the partnership
Yet in Its grace letting me feel like
I am the one and only one enjoying the thrill
Unaware of my head or tail
Ignorant of mysterious beginning
Final destination- a blinded corner
Still I claim the path's ownership.

   Life Agrees To Be Your Valentine For A Period Of Time


There is an element of pleasure
In all the workings of life
Be it of joy or suffering to our eyes
It exists independently universally
Irrelevant to our feelings and emotions
Uninfluenced by our experiences
Jovial are the words of grief and happiness
Whose understanding comes to rest
Upon equality in dealing with duality
And believes in simple pleasure of living
Our joy and sufferings are wrappings
Marked upon life's golden box
Sometime dazzling as dawn azure
Or dark as night sans moon and stars
Intense is the touch of these wrappings
Upon our hearts and mind hiding creation's
Secret purpose beyond our understanding
Ambrosia of life drips in movement of time
Death rejuvenates it like hourglass
Reversing it self to start all over
Life agrees to be your valentine
For a period of short time
Enjoy her partnership in these
Moments so blessedly thine.

   PH: Farm: For Now, The Chimney Stands

In the ashes of a home
Remains a stone fireplace
That still stands against the sky
Decaying at its own pace
Earth, water, and wind
Now its only adversaries, 
Unless you add time to the mix.

It marks the place
Where once humans lived, 
Like a cross without arms, 
A fragment of a tombstone
Is the best it can muster, 
The once cheerful warmth of its heart.
Indistinguishable from ambient air.

At one time a barn was here too! 
But signaling its weariness
By leaning too hard toward the future
As if to brace itself for the final onslaught, 
It won its own release, 
Rough hewn planks stripped away, 
Finding temporary lives elsewhere.
 
Stone walls that once
Sheltered whole towns
From marauding hordes
Have their own plans
For reincarnation, 
Migrating, as it were, 
To patios and garden pools.

All is change my love, 
Everything we hold dear
Vanishes and then reappears, 
Briefly, in other bedrooms, 
Like warmth from a fireplace-
Only the stars in lover's eyes
Remain the same, until they change.

?  SEE YOU IN MARCH?   

BRI   :)    :)    :)Life drops descending
Hunger and death reversing
All life rejoicing


Loveliest of trees, the cherry now
Is hung with bloom along the bough,
And stands about the woodland ride
Wearing white for Eastertide. 

Now, of my threescore years and ten,
Twenty will not come again,
And take from seventy springs a score,
It only leaves me fifty more. 

And since to look at things in bloom
Fifty springs are little room,
About the woodlands I will go
To see the cherry hung with snow. 

The postman comes when I am still in bed.
"Postman, what do you have for me today?"
I say to him. (But really I'm in bed.)
Then he says - what shall I have him say?

"This letter says that you are president
Of - this word here; it's a republic

"
Tell them I can't answer right away.
"It's your duty

" No, I'd rather just be sick.

Then he tells me there are letters saying everything
That I can think of that I want for them to say.
I say, "Well, thank you very much. Good-bye

"
He is ashamed, and turns and walks away.

If I can think of it, it isn't what I want.
I want . . . I want a ship from some near star
To land in the yard, and beings to come out
And think to me: "So this is where you are!

Come

" Except that they won't do,
I thought of them. . . . And yet somewhere there must be
Something that's different from everything.
All that I've never thought of - think of me

Physician of my sin-sick soul,
To thee I bring my case;
My raging malady control,
And heal me by thy grace. 

Pity the anguish I endure,
See how I mourn and pine;
For never can I hope a cure
From any hand but thine. 

I would disclose my whole complaint,
But where shall I begin?
No words of mine can fully paint
That worst distemper, sin. 

It lies not in a single part,
But through my frame is spread;
A burning fever in my heart,
A palsy in my head. 

It makes me deaf, and dumb, and blind,
And impotent and lame;
And overclouds, and fills my mind,
With folly, fear, and shame. 

A thousand evil thoughts intrude
Tumultuous in my breast;
Which indispose me for my food,
And rob me of my rest. 

And set my spirit free;
Say, canst thou let a sinner die,
Who longs to live to thee

A Sickness of this World it most occasions
When Best Men die.
A Wishfulness their far Condition
To occupy.

A Chief indifference, as Foreign
A World must be
Themselves forsake -  contented,
For Deity. 

Evening sunshine never
Solace to my window bears,
Morning sunshine elsewhere fares;-
Here are shadows ever.

Sunshine freely falling,
Wilt thou not my chamber find?
Here some rays would reach a mind,
'Mid the dark appalling.

Morning sunshine's gladness,
Oh, thou art my childhood bright;
While 
thou
playest pure and white,

I
would weep in sadness.

Evening sunshine's whiling,
Oh, thou art the wise man's rest;-
Farther on! Then from the west
Greet my window smiling!

Morning sunshine's singing,
Oh, thou art the fantasy
That the sun-glad world lifts free,
Past my powers' winging.

Evening sunshine's quiet,
Thou art more than wisdom's rest,
Calm my soul's wild riot

On the beloved’s broken embrace
The chilly wind spread her warmth
The cold night swept the lonely streets
The frigid moon shimmered away
The dark shivered and shuddered
Even cursed the sleepy sun
I remember on such a night
The plunging skies wrote our name
In silver on the dark skies
Chattering clouds they hushed
To listen to the sighs
That spilled out deep from my chest and
Were left Strewn around my naked skin
Like leaves in autumn, shells on the sand, 
With fingertips you picked them tenderly
Your lips lingering where they lay spent
Sometimes they sounded like music, 
Sometimes just a whisper, they quiver, 
Then hungry, now sated, fervent sighs
You pick them up with your fingers gently
Brush them with your breath slowly
Feel them with your eyes shut
Press them in the pages of your heart
To be shut and opened years later
To remind us of this cold November night


A SIGHT in camp in the day-break grey and dim,
   As from my tent I emerge so early, sleepless,
   As slow I walk in the cool fresh air, the path near by the hospital
         tent,
   Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought out there, untended
         lying,
   Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woollen blanket,
   Grey and heavy blanket, folding, covering all.

   Curious, I halt, and silent stand;
   Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest, the first,
         just lift the blanket:
   Who are you, elderly man so gaunt and grim, with well-grey'd hair,
         and flesh all sunken about the eyes?
   Who are you, my dear comrade?                                      Then to the second I step--And who are you, my child and darling?
   Who are you, sweet boy, with cheeks yet blooming?

   Then to the third--a face nor child, nor old, very calm, as of
         beautiful yellow-white ivory;
   Young man, I think I know you--I think this face of yours is the face
   Dead and divine, and brother of all, and here again he lies. 

I MARK the months in liveries dank and dry,
       The day-tides many-shaped and hued;
       I see the nightfall shades subtrude,
     And hear the monotonous hours clang negligently by.

     I view the evening bonfires of the sun
       On hills where morning rains have hissed;
       The eyeless countenance of the mist
     Pallidly rising when the summer droughts are done.

     I have seen the lightning-blade, the leaping star,
       The caldrons of the sea in storm,
       Have felt the earthquake's lifting arm,
     And trodden where abysmal fires and snowcones are.

     I learn to prophesy the hid eclipse,
       The coming of eccentric orbs;
       To mete the dust the sky absorbs,
     To weigh the sun, and fix the hour each planet dips.

     I witness fellow earth-men surge and strive;
       Assemblies meet, and throb, and part;
       Death's soothing finger, sorrow's smart;
     --All the vast various moils that mean a world alive.

     But that I fain would wot of shuns my sense--
       Those sights of which old prophets tell,
       Those signs the general word so well,
     Vouchsafed to their unheed, denied my watchings tense.

     In graveyard green, behind his monument
       To glimpse a phantom parent, friend,
       Wearing his smile, and "Not the end!"
     Outbreathing softly: that were blest enlightenment;

     Or, if a dead Love's lips, whom dreams reveal
       When midnight imps of King Decay
       Delve sly to solve me back to clay,
     Should leave some print to prove her spirit-kisses real;

     Or, when Earth's Frail lie bleeding of her Strong,
       If some Recorder, as in Writ,
       Near to the weary scene should flit
     And drop one plume as pledge that Heaven inscrolls the wrong.

     --There are who, rapt to heights of tranced trust,
       These tokens claim to feel and see,
       Read radiant hints of times to be--
     Of heart to heart returning after dust to dust.

     Such scope is granted not my powers indign. 
       I have lain in dead men's beds, have walked
       The tombs of those with whom I'd talked,
     Called many a gone and goodly one to shape a sign,

     And panted for response. But none replies;
       No warnings loom, nor whisperings
       To open out my limitings,
     And Nescience mutely muses: When a man falls he lies.

every small way every wonderful way
you made the moon kiss me to sleep.

What a beautiful lover you are-I feel am tied with chains
I suffer everyday, my body pains, 
Am tired of doing the hospital rounds
Undergoing various tests or scan ultrasound, 
My days starts and ends with ache
When visitors flock, I give a smile fake, 
Gone are my happy and trouble free days
Now anxiously through the window pane I gaze, 
I want to walk, I want to run
I wish I could have had some more fun, 
Though my earlier days were not stress free
I was healthy and happy being a busy bee, 
My life now seem worthless 
I neither live nor die and lay here restless, 
Give me one more chance to enjoy life to the core, 
Once let the storm inside my heart calm
You can then happily wrap me around your arm.

forming an arrow
cutting across the wind
it was a demonstration
the shape keeps changing
the planes keep changing positions
it is a planned execution
there was an instruction
there was a team leader
a gathered audience to applause
there was a lot of sound in this sight

one is quite natural
the other is done to show potential. 

Silver coins beside the origin
The eyes of pearls in margin
Wearisome looks over me
Originated a margin we.

Petals of pink on brightness
The sweetness in darkness
Wholesome wave of her explosion
Stopped at once after our inclusion.

Image of pointed silence
A breath's pointed violence
Never the easy of air in me
Washing helpless changes in me.

Unarmed war of her
Beyond the scraps of our love
I am empty in this world
Splitting empty in emptiness. 

Sometimes we look but cannot see 
the beauty there before us. 
Sometimes we let go of something 
we should have hung onto. 
This happens all the time 
concerning matters of the heart.

Sometimes our head rules our heart 
and something wonderful is lost. 
In the years that follow, 
we live with our regret 
of not following our heart 
instead of following our head.

We reflect in our memories 
making up what might have been, 
when it is too late for us 
to turn back the clock. 
Always wondering what would have happened
if we had followed our heart.

We cannot foresee the future 
and our destiny is always shrouded
 within a silken cloth. 
We can only go where 
our future plans to lead us, 
and our destiny is written.

Our what ifs and wonderings 
are just fragments of our dreams. 
Reality is where we live 
and our time is mapped out 
in a future shrouded 
within a silken cloth.

i made a wish and it came true! ! ! 

Come hither, 
Come hither my love 
When the infant sun shines 
And promises a sunny weather. 
Come hither. Come hither.  

Come hither, 
Come hither my love 
When the moon beams 
In the company of multitude  
And she promises a beam-soaked weather. 
Come hither. Come hither.  

Come hither, 
Come hither my love 
When the spring sets in 
With a fragrant fanfare 
And sensuous is the weather, 
Come hither. Come hither.  

Come hither, 
Come hither my love 
When the clouds run errands 
For their master and 
When lightening is the harbinger 
And lively is the weather, 
Come hither. Come hither.  

Come hither, 
Come hither my love 
When autumn makes me lonely 
In the soul of my creative pang 
Be my soul-mate all-weather, 
And come hither. Come hither.  

Said Hamlet to Ophelia,
I'll draw a sketch of thee,
What kind of pencil shall I use? 
 or not 

They flew on a moonbeam 
and danced on the stars 
the giraffe looked at the kangaroo 
and said how do you do. 
Old Mother Hubbard got into the act 
when she went to the cupboard and found it bare. 
"Sorry guys there is no food in there." 
Tom Thumb jumped up, said I’ll play mum, 
and with that pulled out a plum. 
They sat round the table 
the giraffe, the kangaroo, 
and the giraffe asked what you eating roo? 
Caterpillar stew because wise guy 
I hate to see butter fly. 
Pinocchio stuck is nose in 
like he likes to do 
when suddenly it grew and grew. 
A passing elephant looked in, 
"Hey Pinocchio can you play a tune on that like I can do? " Therefore, the nonsense band was born. 
They played all night causing a bit of a storm, 
the candles for miles all went plop, 
and I’m glad to say this is nearly your lot. 
All those who read this I hope get a smile 
or at least a kick in the pants. 
Because watch behind you there is an angry mule. 
You’ve been framed 
That’s the name of the game. 
Now there is just one last thing to say 
I’m removing the vote counter before I go away 
because I know that some jolly prankster 
will read this silly thing 
and only leave me a one. 
Now that’s all folks 
as the loony toons might say 
just enjoy yourself for the rest of the day. 

& September ear Thomas, didst thou never pop
Thy head into a tin-man's shop?
There, Thomas, didst thou never see
('Tis but by way of simile)
A squirrel spend his little rage
In jumping round a rolling cage?
The cage, as either side turn'd up,
Striking a ring of bells a-top?--

Mov'd in the orb, pleas'd with the chimes,
The foolish creature thinks he climbs:
But here or there, turn wood or wire,
He never gets two inches higher.

So fares it with those merry blades,
That frisk it under Pindus' shades.
In noble songs, and lofty odes,
They tread on stars, and talk with gods;
Still dancing in an airy round,
Still pleas'd with their own verses' sound;
Brought back, how fast soe'er they go,
Always aspiring, always low. 

What village but has sometimes seen
The clumsy shape, the frightful mien,
Tremendous claws, and shagged hair
Of that grim brute yclept a bear?
He from his dam the learn'd agree,
Received the curious form you see;
Who with her plastic tongue alone,
Produced a visage-like her own-
And thus they hint, in mystic fashion,
The powerful force of education.
Perhaps yon crowd of swains is viewing,
Even now, the strange exploits of Bruin,
Who plays his antics, roars aloud,
The wonder of a gaping crowd!
So have I known an awkward lad,
Whose birth has made a parish glad,
Forbid, for fear of sense, to roam,
And taught by kind mamma at home,
Who gives him many a well-tried rule,
With ways and means-to play the fool.
In sense the same, in stature higher,
He shines, ere long, a rural squire,
Pours forth unwitty jokes, and swears,
And bawls, and drinks, but chiefly stares:
His tenants of superior sense
Carouse, and laugh, at his expense,
And deem the pastime I'm relating
To be as pleasant as bear-baiting. 

What did we say to each other
that now we are as the deer
who walk in single file
with heads high
with ears forward
with eyes watchful
with hooves always placed on firm ground
in whose limbs there is latent flight(love is like)   
Love is like a painting
filled with all colours and shades
love is like a bleeding heart
cut with many sharp blades
love is like a never ending story
that always begins with a kiss
love is like a space everlasting
that fills bitterness with bliss
love is like the circle of eternity
always there to take for free

(love is)   
Love is an open clear pool
where no hate can dare swim
love is a captured sunset
where the warmth never grows dim
love is desire held in the eye
that spreads quickly to the heart
love is a black starry night sky
a metaphor of glorious art
love is a deep dark hole of mystery
always there to take freea father might be 
just like a drop 
of water to an ocean
(ocean of responsibilities)  
but one of the sources
to continue a family life
like the water with minerals


can stop a million tears. 
A little hug 
can give so much joy. 
A letter now and then to someone 
can save so many wasted years. 
We should hold every moment precious 
and help as many as we can 
with a simple act of kindness 
every now and then. 
The world would be a better place 
if we all cared a little more. 
Imagine how many smiling faces 
would greet us at the door 
if we extended that helping hand 
with a simple act of kindness 
that could spread across many lands.

March  simple, cheerful, active life on earth,
A cup I’d not exchange for monarch’s chalice,
In noble forebears’ tracks a path since birth,
With equal dignity in hut and palace,
With eye as when created heav’nward turned,
All beauty here and grandness keenly knowing,
Familiar though with those things deeply yearned,
Stilled only by eternity’s bright glowing.

I wished for all my line just such a life,
And zealously I planned for its fruition,
And when my soul grew tired from toil and strife,
Then from truth’s spirit I great comfort gained,
And felt joy hover o’er each garden border,
When dust is placed in its creator’s hand
And all is waited for in nature’s order:

Just fresh, green buds that sprout in early spring,
And in the summer heat the flowers’ profusion;
And when the plants mature and long to bring
Their harvest fruit to autumn’s full conclusion!
The human span assigned is short or long,
It is for common weal, its yield is growing;
The day that started well will end as strong,
And just as sweet will be its afterglowing. 

Tell me, if a dream exceeds reality, 
When it's what I want for me, 
If so, should I hold on? 
Or should I let it go? 
My life and all I see
Means nothing, nothing to me
If so, why am I still here? 
If so, what do I fear

oh how sweet are the words from your lips
the words full of hope and promises
oh how sweet to hear those whispers 
whispers with jokes and naughty phrase. 

am i still the apple of your eyes? 
the princess of your life? 
am i still the goddess of love? 
the only woman who owns your heart? ..

lord, bless me coz i love this man
teach me to create words of love
help me to reach his lonely heart
bring these words to fill his empty life. 

who are you to blame me
who are they to condemn 
who am i to refuse
the love of this powerful man. 

clouds may cover the  sun
darkness may fill our day
thorns may spread at night
night of heroic play. 

A simple kiss 
can lead to many things, 
a heart filled with love 
and a golden ring.

A simple kiss 
is how it starts, 
who knows where 
that simple kiss will end.

It can lead to happiness 
the greatest we’ve ever known, 
or it can lead to pain 
and a broken heart.

April y intention is to appreciate all the goodness of my life, 
Either, small or big thing i gave thank to the almighty one, 
What makes me blessed and grateful creature, 
Because i always ask him to safeguard my heart from worldliness, 
So my soul can capture the simplicity and beauty of life he gave.

Some would laugh and piss me off, still i am fine, 
Some would question the way i see and live my life, 
A nod and a simple smile without wearing a mask, 

I choose to be happy everyday, 
Though some difficulties may seem to understand, 
From Him, i gained wisdom and inner peace.

Would be enough to enjoy life he brings, 
What else shall i ask for, 
HIS pure love for me is enough to live. 

A simple man with simple ideas, 
that’s what he, thinks of himself, 
but others look differently at him. 
They say that he has a heart way off the charts, 
for all the things that he does. 
For the words of comfort that he says, 
and the support he brings to all he meets. 
He cannot see it though; 
to him it is just something 
he has always done naturally. 
To him there is nothing special, 
in all that he does. 
Being kind is no special trait; 
everyone can do it. 
Loving everything and everyone that comes his way, 
a lot of people out there can do that too. 
So why do people choose him? 
He is only human after all, 
no more thoughtful than most. 
Some even think him as an angel, 
he smiles at that, and wishes 
that he had a guardian angel of his own, 
to give him advice when 
he trying to ease someone else’s pain. 
However, he is a simple man, 
who walks through life, 
only doing simple things. 
The only time you will see him frown, 
is when he wants to help someone, 
and finds that he cannot. 
It s then he feels he is failing them, 
because of something he could not do. 
Therefore, if you ever meet this simple man, 
cheer him up a little bit. 
Personally I would like to be like him 
and all that he does possess, 
but my head is buried in the sand, 
too much of the time, 
to do all the things he does. 

It sees the goodness of life though we live is a chaos world, 
Get rid of the clutter and control what to be put in our mind, 

Define what do our hearts desire and motivate more is enough, 
A little earthly possession in life, never be satisfied with much, 
Contentment comes by appreciating for what HE gave for us, 
Strive to be simpler, because life is not made up of many things. 

Now  on  the  shore  I  stand  by  thee
As  we  stare  lonely  out  to  sea.
We  know  ourselves,  or  say  we  do, 
Though  time  has  said  we  never  knew.
We  cannot  speak  and  say  so  much, 
We  dare  not  cry,  yet  long  to  touch.
And  though  we  stare,  we  cannot  see.
Time  and  memories  block  the  sea.
We  hold  ourselves,  it's  not  the  same.
The  wind  is  colder  since  we  came.
We  turn  our  heads  as  though  to  speak, 
But  pride  is  strong  and  words  are  weak.
Now  we  strain  for  a  simple  plea; 
'No  matter  what,  I  still  love  thee.

'my shield can't resist the coming storm
tears will fall down anytime
oh dear.  

dont close your eyes
don't leave me alone in the night. 

keep me under your wings
as you always do to me
build a roof  to protect me
i am hopeless.. 

hopeless as can be. 

i am more than a great
if you are here by my side
i am more than excellent
if i saw you in my eyes. 

you are my one more chance
my last chance to live
please don't ever ever go away
keep me under your  wings 
please. .. stay with me.  

the life of my soul is you
and the breath that i take. 

as we walk the aisle of joy
cross the bridges of emptiness..

you are the man of my dreams
the man who always love me
you are the truth from heaven
wakes the  sleeping 'me'..

don't ever close your eyes
while staring at the sky
might you'll miss the moonshine
as witness for our love tonight. 

i love you, i love you so much
no one can take your place in my heart
have you seen the falling star? 
it's an omen from heaven, sign of a good start. 

feel my heart.  

i am  yours
feel my lips.  

it's all yours
feel the warmth of my love
it will never  break your heart.. 

Just told you not to drop it, 
o the merchant of Madrid! 
My heart is made of glass, 
it's fragile, care it did need.
Look, thousand scars it does have, 
how could I repair? 
It has broken in many parts, 
its pain who can share! 
Tattered and scattered  
it has lost its pure charm, 
still it can beat and pump, 
without doing any harm.
A simple task, I wanna give, 
if anyone can do.
Pick up the pieces and 
join them, if your heart is true

oh.  

masters of the sky
i am a goddess who waits
a lady who speaks
ambassadress of friendship. 

oh.  

lady of love
bless me the innocence
the truth to be heard
by those hopeless hearts. 

oh.  

princess of the ocean
this is my first poem
bless me from this poetry
to be as lovely as pearls. 

oh.  

king of the jungle
give me your sweet smile
guard my words 
and  check my errors. 

oh.. 

prince of the universe
love me as you love them
let your tongue be the swords against enemy
and your wisdom be the food of my soul. 

oh.  

poets of this kingdom
spare me  your comments
leave it  with all your lov
With my spirit humbled by knowledge of Compassion, Suffering, and Eternity, and with the kindness of Buddha radiating through beginingless time, I offer a sincere wish for all beings, past, present, and future.  

  This wish does not discriminate any single being, from the greatest teacher, to the lowliest lifeform or the most criminal soul, in past, present, or future lives, which are eternally connected.  I speak this wish in pure honesty, from the deepest Essence of my being, the Essence I have shared with all beings in infinite lives together.  May all beings be blessed with infinite lives to be born, make attachments, suffer, and eventually die. 

  I offer unconditional love and empathy to all beings as much as I can in this life, even to those only imaginary in this world called Earth.  I pray for forgiveness for my shortcomings in this life, and for the serenity in this life to always make each day as joyful as I can make it for myself and for all beings.
 

  May each private life find eventual peace and refuge in knowing that Nirvana is attainable, even in Samsara, and is equally obtainable to all beings, those enlightened and those in the darkest reaches of Hell, at all moments within Timelessness, the ever-still Source of all that Is.  I peacefully request the conscious and unconscious assistance from all beings in this Present Moment, and offer all beings the forgiveness that they themselves wish to give to themselves and to others.  

  May all beings find the Truth and share it graciously with each other, even amidst the eternal pains of Samsara.  The desire to pass subjective judgement on beings I gladfully surrender, with the sincerest human hopes of the eventual eradication of all that is still impure within my spirit. 

That which he did not feel, he would not sing; 
What most he felt, religion it was to hide 
In a dumb darkling grotto, where the spring 
Of tremulous tears, arising unespied, 
Became a holy well that durst not glide 
Into the day with moil or murmuring; 
Whereto, as if to some unlawful thing, 
He sto]e, musing or praying at its side. 

But in the sun he sang with cheerful heart, 
Of coloured season and the whirling sphere, 
Warm household habitude and human mirth, 
The whole faith-blooded mystery of earth; 
And I, who had his secret, still could hear 
The grotto's whisper low through every part. 

Well, it is raining, and the raindrops make
Furtive areolas in the puddles of muddy bellies, 
And their mists are like nebulous shrouds, 
And unfertilized thoughts of maidens dreaming of
Weddings and fine bachelors in their highest high towers-
And I am warm, as down in the valley the safe cabins
Huddle against their pines like satisfied lovers, 
And I read my book once more the way a captain checks
Over his ship preparing for embarkation, 
For I will be published mutely and celebrate with my dogs
In the consolatory monsoons of this lush season; 
For it is what I can hope for, and my smiling mother’s eyes, 
And the way the doors lay sometimes half open letting
In the glows; but I cannot love her anymore, when my
Words grow tangled about my mind like weeds and skeins
Of my dead aunt’s yarn the kittens have playfully disemboweled, 
For on the swings so far away she is moving in her arcs
As the policemen patrol her, and the apex where her legs grow
Up together and into the seat of a tall ladder placed below
Her window where the work is finished and she leans outwards, 
Her eyes so maple and October, and she sighs never thinking
How the rain touches me, as if the kisses from cold little children, 
Never once desiring her match-head, and the humming bloom
Of a single kiss. .Is all that pins the Soul
That stands for Deity, to Mine,
Upon my side the Veil—

Once witnessed of the Gauze—
Its name is put away
As far from mine, as if no plight
Had printed yesterday,

In tender—solemn Alphabet,
My eyes just turned to see,
When it was smuggled by my sight
Into Eternity—

More Hands—to hold—These are but Two—
One more new-mailed Nerve
Just granted, for the Peril's sake—
Some striding—Giant—Love—

They slink before the Clay,
That not for all their Heaven can boast
Will let its Keepsake—go


I own two bicycles because I still pine for you
Alma, 
Even while you make love this evening, even while you
Turn out all of the hope in your lighthouse, 
So you cannot see my beauty drowning, 
While during the day your eyes seem like brown
Maelstroms swirling with your breath, 
Devouring the young heroes far more beautiful than me; 
And still you accept my dreams and my bouquets, 
While now all of the flowers are getting smaller as I too
Shrink, 
Soon I will be so diminished as to be in danger of drowning
In a single tear drop, 
Which is all that I wish from you. 

if I have one single wish
i’ll go back to the moment we kissed
where in your arms, I laid and rest
thousand times you made your promises. 

if I have one single wish
i’ll go back to the moment
when you first visit our dwelling
and ask my hand from them. 

if I have one single wish
i’ll go back to the days
when I cried over your naughty words
and sealed my lips with kisses. 

if only i could have  one wish
i'll ask  for  one of these three wishes
it wasn't me who let you go
hope these wishes are your wishes too.. 

There is nothing worse than a woman's scorn, 
'Vengeances is mine sayith the LORD! '
Does anger and vengeance not blind sinners from the truth? 
Who am I to dare take the LORD'S sword for his work? 
A sinner! 

There is a fine line between the LORD'S work and a false profit
Does the prophecy not blind a non-believer from the truth? 
Who am I to lay claim to the truth? 
A sinner! 

There is no proof for non-believers to denounce the LORD! 
Does the prophecy not hold the truth of sinner's belief? 
Who am I to dare have the faith of the truth? 
A sinner

An acrobat in the high numbers: 
Rainbows that taper and billow in 
The towers of trees.
The land swelters, the maidens sweating, 
The paladins that we all once knew
Are taking a knee: 

Mexicans, boys and girls, 
Playing beneath the overpasses- 
Terrapins digging holes in the sandy armpits
Of the lees.

I see you now, beckoning as a mirage: 
Lingering, a siren for truancy, 
But good boys and girls go from and return
To school: 

They are looking socially beautiful, 
But ignore them. See them as a mirage, 
Pass the traffic going busily and in both ways: 

Come to the greenest side of the canal, 
To where the cats can talk, 
And childhoods linger in the ill-begotten pornographies.

A land where your mothers are still beautiful
And housewives are in chains.
Float above the mountains- 

Here is Ovid's metamorphosis-  turn into a bird.
Migrate above the color changing parapets- 
Calmly hallucinatory, 
And in the midnights which douse crepuscule
Linger, 

Observe the broken virgins, 
The pietas mass produced in infinite number
In their cradles of industry.
They have all turned into something
Expectantly: 

But, aside the green cages, 
The lions are yawning, 
And boys as old as Peter Pan are
Touching down from their infinite slumbers.

This place is rich with football players, 
And the creatures whom have made themselves
Are at a standstill.
The entire scene is a still life awaiting the joy

Of an erstwhile holiday. 

Tonight my muse lies in sleep with him
Like a mermaid who has come ashore smelling the rose
That will become her grave: 
There is her bed between the dunes, and her eyes 
Have already bled all of their tears: 
And now what is she doing, held over like a prostitute 
Underneath the biggest neon cross underneath the 
Biggest all night supermarket 
While the convenient stores are getting robbed: 
There she is with her nightgown slipped over her 
Brown shoulders in the middle of the orange groves
So far away from where she belongs.
But she was so far away anyways- but I linger there
Still listening at the bus stops, the lions lamenting 
A siren who has forgotten all of her favorite songs.

'BREATHE DEEP MY SCENTED SONG
CAST YOUR FATE TO THE VOICE BEHIND THE WIND
LOOK INTO MY EYES AND SEE
A TASTE OF WHAT YOU THOUGHT
COULD NEVER BE' 

Venom she laces in her song
And rubs it upon her breasts.
It rolls across the opium sea, 
With desire worth any death.

A song of all abandonment, 
Intoxicates his very soul.
Seduction has euphoric eyes, 
Yet pays a heavy toll

Why has the sky turned red? 
My kingdom sold, for passionate tears.
Just what was the name of my wife? 
Where does life go from here

The image is stacking in your head
Your sister’s lifeless body cold and dead
Tears streaming down your cheeks
The smell of her body reeks
She swings gently from side to side 
She has just committed suicide

And you were there to watch it all
Your sister’s body begins to fall
As the rope begins to break 
Your life you plan to take

You shake her body and tell her to wake up
You let out a scream
Loud and abrupt
Your body starts to tremble
You’re going to irrupt 
You scream and run from the room
You hope in your heart
You will join her soon


To my friend


The little hedgerow birds,
That peck along the road, regard him not.
He travels on, and in his face, his step,
His gait, is one expression; every limb,
His look and bending figure, all bespeak
A man who does not move with pain, but moves
With thought. -He is insensibly subdued
To settled quiet: he is one by whom
All effort seems forgotten; one to whom
Long patience hath such mild composure given
That patience now doth seem a thing of which
He hath no need. He is by nature led
To peace so perfect, that the young behold
With envy what the Old Man hardly feels. 

A sky is to watch for what? 
Beneath few bright stars
Or melting dew drops 
Or birds that rise up or blooms 
That grace the meadows? 
Under this thatched roof
Of my closed heart
Now I watch you close-

I watch two shiny stars
Try to snatch the mist 
That make those petals wet
Catch those heaving birdies 
And in you else what not? 
And what if I dare but 
Not to make a poem
Out of these, dear

Tiny bird, titanic sky. 

what a gift
to your petty wings, 
the immensity they give to the sphere.
with nothing beneath
save man and his petty things, airborne
cloud-like how you transcend
passion gale! mine so mind stuck I
could hardly fly out of me. 

A slant of sun on dull brown walls, 
A forgotten sky of bashful blue. 

A song of collisions and cries, 
Rumbling wheels, hoof-beats, bells, 
Welcomes, farewells, love-calls, final moans, 
Voices of joy, idiocy, warning, despair, 
The unknown appeals of brutes, 
The chanting of flowers, 
The screams of cut trees, 
The senseless babble of hens and wise men -- 
A cluttered incoherency that says at the stars: 

A slash of Blue—
A sweep of Gray—
Some scarlet patches on the way,
Compose an Evening Sky—
A little purple—slipped between—
Some Ruby Trousers hurried on—
A Wave of Gold—
A Bank of Day—
This just makes out the Morning Sky. 

A man of free thought
is always free
free from all polarities
disdains all calamities
that brings a disgraceful life.

A free man always withdraws
all bondages of life.

A free man is He
who desires for a delightful life.

But a slave is He
who  wants to enslave universal life. 

April, and the last of the plum blossoms 
scatters on the black grass 
before dawn. The sycamore, the lime, 
the struck pine inhale 
the first pale hints of sky. 
                                     An iron day, 
I think, yet it will come 
dazzling, the light 
rise from the belly of leaves and pour 
burning from the cups 
of poppies. 
                        The mockingbird squawks 
from his perch, fidgets, 
and settles back. The snail, awake 
for good, trembles from his shell 
and sets sail for China. My hand dances 
in the memory of a million vanished stars. 

A man has every place to lay his head. 

A slender bender all the way
The crew got right
Into the mood
Fire dancers at door
What more do you need
To get a venue 
Sweating under the collar

Just before the dark moon, 
A slender sliver of light -
Like a piece of onion skin -
Rises into the sky near sunrise.
The next lunar  phase, 
Like a gaping empty mouth 
Of a Black Hole, 
Swallows that crumb and starts over, 
Adding layer upon layer of meaning each night
Until a globose onion gleaming
Inside its translucent sheath
Hangs like a Japanese lantern
Shining through its parchment, 
Voluminous as the Book of Life -
My deeds, both good and bad, 
Are scribed on every page.
Does the ink bleed through 
So that today's transgressions
Leak into tomorrow
Staining it with lesser motives, 
Obliterating the light within? 
As a dark growth of black mold
pollutes the purer inner skin of childhood, 
I begin to peel this moon
And tears flow freely
As I cut out the spoiled patches of sin -
The offensive slime that feeds on the sweetness -
And soon I have cut all but a thin crust, 
That slender sliver 
just before the new moon. 

Why have such scores of lovely, gifted girls
Married impossible men?
Simple self-sacrifice may be ruled out,
And missionary endeavour, nine times out of ten.

Repeat 'impossible men': not merely rustic,
Foul-tempered or depraved
(Dramatic foils chosen to show the world
How well women behave, and always have behaved).

Impossible men: idle, illiterate,
Self-pitying, dirty, sly,
For whose appearance even in City parks
Excuses must be made to casual passers-by.

Fallen, in fact, so low?
Or do I always over-value woman
At the expense of man?
Do I?
It might be so. 

Oh, do you hear the argument, far up above the skies?
The voice of old Saint Peter, in expostulation rise?
Growing shrill, and ever shriller, at the thing that’s being done;
More in sorrow than in anger, like our old Jack Robertson.
Old Saint Peter’s had his troubles—heaps of troubles, great and small,
Since he kept the gates of Heaven—but this last one covers all!
It is not a crowing rooster—that’s a sight and sound he’s useter,
Simulated by some impish spirit that he knows full well;
It is simply Drake, of Devon, who is breaking out of Heaven,
With a crew of pirate brethren, to come down once more to Hell! 
Oh, do you hear the distant sound, that seems to come and go,
As thunder does in summer time, when faraway and low?
Or the "croon" beneath the church bells, when they’re pealing from the tower—
And the church bells are the battle-call in this dark, anxious hour.
Do you feel the distant throbbing; Do you feel it go and come;
Like a war hymn on horizons, or a centuries-mellowed drum!
Hear it sobbing, hear it throbbing, like some not unhappy sobbing—
By the peaceful Devon landscape and the fair Devonian home!
By the land those spirits meet in—and it’s Drake’s Drum, spirit-beaten,
By perhaps the Rose of Torridge—and it’s calling Drake to come? 

Oh, do you feel a cooling hand upon your fevered brow?
That dulls your ears to Hell’s Own Din—or that worse Silence, now?
In the starlight in the Channel, while Destruction lurks below,
Or that Nether-Hell, the Stoke-hole, where you cannot see or know?
Do you feel a soothing presence, keeping sanity in one
Going mad, in Satan’s Nightmare, where the gun-crew works the gun?
It is Raleigh!—Admiral-Poet, who had dreams though few may know it—
Who had dreams of England’s greatness, otherwise than by the sea.
Sorrowful but all-forgiving, bringing courage to the living—
Raleigh’s Spirit, not from London, but his Vanished Colony. 

Oh, do you feel a stony calm that you had never known?
With comrades in the firing-line, or "Sentry Go" alone.
When it’s Hellfire all around you, and it’s freezing slush below,
Or you pace in rain and darkness, with Old Death, and "Sentry Go"—
Feel a cold determination that makes all but Now a blank;
That’s half foreign to your nature, and half foreign to your rank?
It is Wellington, where French is, who has broken Heaven’s trenches,
With his purple-blooded captains (who used purple language then)
Come to strengthen with his spirit all the coolness you inherit—
He who took the scum of Europe, and who trained them to be Men. 

A Sloop of Amber slips away
Upon an Ether Sea,
And wrecks in Peace a Purple Tar,
The Son of Ecstasy -It's a slow day, 
a ‘nothing much to do’ day, 
a laid back, andante sort of day.

No clock to watch, 
no phone to ring, 
no people 
around
worrying.

So I sit on my chair, 
place my fingers on the keys
and watch
words
appear, 
(as if by magic)   
on this linen white
snow bright screen.

Where do they come from
I wonder? 
These words
that pop
like rabbits 
from a hat, 
like notes
from a bird, 
like bubbles 
from a pipe? 

These fancies
that start in my head
slip into my fingers
and reveal themselves
like strangers 
before my eyes? 

And does it really matter anyway -
On this slow, lazy Sunday

We used words to fill the distance between us
more words than the miles that separated us
words that sealed my fate

Each morning, a new beginning
Each night, a rebirth
of emotions
once laid dormant
resting in an uneasy peace.

Daily, 
I felt you take form and materialise
into my love

Now, in your absence, I hold your letters close
as proof of your existence
still yearning for words, any words 
words to explain
just what I did to make you turn around
and take your love away

You seem to reject the notion that there is no me without you
even though obituaries are being written
that say otherwise

I can no longer speak, 
my emotions have been sequestered into silence
So I turn inward to memory of you 
and the words you left behind, 

It is so deafeningly quiet now
Even I can hear the sound of my own heart breaking


The shiny red fire truck
Was late getting to the fire.
A siren isn't much help
When you have a flat tire. 

She could hear the piano
playing as slow
as his seductive fingers.
The lingering sound
of'Smoke Gets In
Your Eyes'
wafted out of
an open window
into the heady fragrance
of roses and the light
of bright stars
above the dark horizon -
prompting a feline
to stalk the shadows
of her thoughts
as she lit a cigarette, 
gently
closed her eyes, 
floating in her memories.



A slumber did my spirit seal
I had no human fears:
She seemed a thing that could not feel
The touch of earthly years. 

No motion has she now, no force;
She neither hears nor sees;
Rolled round in earth's diurnal course,
With rocks, and stones, and trees. 

Most small guys, with fervent vigor
Avoid fights with those much bigger
Preferring not to fight at all
When looking up at six feet tall

It seems to make good sense to me
Their avoiding giants is the key
To survival and the guaranteeing
Of longer lives and their well-being

The bullies rarely show remorse
For utilizing brutal force
Against those small and power-less
But bullying is true cowardice

The moral here applies to nations
The need to dominate is an aberration
Those who bully-bomb a country small
Are not in truth tall at allthere's the sea
there's the sky
the moon and the wind too
a picture perfect setting
for you and i
but 
you aren't you
i'm not i

inheritors of the promordial fire
we're just the carriers of the 
principle that governs nature
to probe and penetrate
the mysterious and mystic 
depths and spaces
teasing man for eons
to undo all the knots
to unravel our existence
at each penetration
at each probing
to reach that fleeting moment
of non-existence 
severed from the body connect
detached from the earth-bounds

the elements will never cease
the fire will keep burning
but
you'll not be you
and i'll not be i

unrs
I can see the sky, 
As I lay in the meadow, 
And wish I could fly.


The smell of the sea, 
The sound of the crashing waves, 
The beauty of thee.


There are times I weep, 
Weep because I care too much, 
About my true love.


There is nothing wrong, 
With trying to stand your ground, 
To help those in need.


Old streets, ancient history, 
Grey factory town
Weeping lonely rain, 
A small girl
Moves from the city
And her cat is left behind.

The birth of melancholy eyes
And a poetic soul
Begin in delicate tenderness. 

She draws a circle around her man
With a strict warning
Never think of crossing this circle
Stand there till I come
She went shopping for so long.
Poor chap stood stand still for a long.

Lovely maid came singing in, 
Ringing in twists and turns.
On seeing him
She looked at him in a mockery style.
After standing prolonged
His eyes too flung at her captivating style.

He lost his balance and fell down.
The circle was seen nowhere.
He made a new circle
Then he stood perfectly still like a statue.

You know very well, 
To all those who are already engaged.
A lesson to be learnt by the bachelors, 
What a wife can do? 

Ignoring his innocent looks.
Wife sniffed her man encircling him.
And saw the circle position changed.
Many utensils flung on him.
A door was shut with a
Big Bang on him.

She never left her man alone.
Now for shopping, 
He was fully loaded, 
With all the stuffs, 
She had seen in sales.
Poor chap was carrying
All the way home.
As a double punishment
His credit card was swiped
To the maximum in one swap! 

Don't ever fool your wife
This small pinch of love could be your big punch
Her eyes, ears, nose, teeth, heart always encircles her dear husband.
Her all senses works in full swing when it comes to her dear husband.
Though quite possessive she may be, 
But she loves you dear, to her heart.
Don't ever fool your wife
For she is sure to give you A Small Pinch With Love! 

Enjoy the beauty of love with your pretty and possessive wife! 



Stains on the casements, 
dustmotes, spiderless webs. 
No chairs, and a man waking up, 
or he's falling asleep 

Many first novels begin 
with the hero waking up, 
which saves their authors 
from writing well about sleep. 

His life is the only novel 
about him. Mornings 
he walks past the park: 
Tai Ch'i students practicing 

like slow lorises. 
A room on the second floor. 
He'd dreamed of a ground floor 
room, an insistent cat 

at the door, its mouth pink 
with wrath he couldn't salve 
and grew to hate. All afternoon 
he's a cloud that can't rain. 

There's no ordinary life 
in a resort town, he thinks, 
though he's wrong: it laces 
through the silt of tourists 

like worm life. At dusk 
the light rises in his room. 
A beautiful day, all laziness 
and surface, true without 

translation. Wherever I go 
I'm at home, he thinks, 
smug and scared both, 
fierce as a secret, 

ooo feet above sea level. 
The dark on its way down 
has passed him, so he seems 
to be rising, after the risen 

light, as if he were to keep watch 
while the dark sleeps, 
as if he and it were each 
other's future and children. 

Old Sol hires young Abdul, 
a refugee, to cut his grass and weed.
Saul tells his neighbor Old Paddy

young Abdul does a good job
and has a wife and three kids
and needs money for his family.

Sol says Abdul was an engineer 
in Syria before the war but now
he has to improve his English

to find work as an engineer.
Till then he still has a family to feed. 
Old Paddy understands and hires Abdul 

to cut his grass and weed.
A month later Paddy tells Sol  
they have to worry about Abdul: 

His English is getting better.
Paddy's says Abdul might find work.  
If he does, who will shovel their snow

A SMILE FOR A SMILE
a poem for a poem.  

and
that seems fair in this forum
 
What a variety of people we have here
nine to a ninety of age would be there
what a variety of poets we have here
some would paint lovely pictures
some would bring lovely music
some could paint and play music together
all of it only with words in order
some are naughty
some are just heart broken
a lot  write on god
yet to see an 'atheist' poet here
what a variety of poets we have here
 
Is there a rat race here? 
I admit that i visit the 'promote your poems' now and then
I do it to see how much iam read
I certainly want to be read
I do request a lot of poets to read me
I do respond to their requests too.  

that's it
a rat race here is a shame
who can overtake whom in 'creativity'
each one's individuality is what matters
to me creativity would sustain humanity
 
I used to be writing in tamil
i used to read it to my wife and daughters
i owe it to my wife.. 

she is my first fan
my daughters gave up tamil and took up french
when i started writing in english.  

they left the country itself
I think it is a boon to be read by so many
i think it is a boon to read so many
I thank every body for their  support and guidance
A SMILE FOR A SMILE - A TRIBUTE TO ALLBreaking to pieces me a play thing
That, you ask me to keep smiling! 
Glue applied? Smiling I would remain
If that would make you happy again! 

Smile only? I would rather laugh heartly 
For no pain now I have; 
What I lost to you has been not mine, 
My heart only; now you gain also my pain! 





Standing alone in the sand, bored, 

you begin to count to yourself

the grains pushing 'tween your ten toes; 

a young girl trim and pretty walks by, 

your smile gives away your embarrassment, 

she smiles on back and glances, 

but continues to walk on by; 

her smile was one of attraction, 

her glance one last shot at talking; 

and then it suddenly hits you

like a seagulls gift from the sky; 

how in hell would she know 

I was counting sand grain thru my toes.

And they say if you want to meet girls

go by yourself to a beach and act bored; 

and I say to myself, I'll no longer deign

future trips to the beach by my lonesome; 

next week I'll be back at the grocery store! 

 



Pay off gratitude with a hug and a smile
Let other know that their kindness pile
That they showed earlier to you
Means a lot and is surely true
For love is kindness 'n kindess is love
And all human beings really deserve
Few words of sympathy and care
And few moments with others to share
So when you're shown any of this
Then accept it as god's loving bliss
And pay off gratitude with a smile
That is shown to you in trouble's pile.

covering the picture window and
my mother, always smiling, wanting us all
to be happy, told me, 'be happy Henry!'
and she was right: it's better to be happy if you
can
but my father continued to beat her and me several times a week while
raging inside his foot-two frame because he couldn't
understand what was attacking him from within. 

my mother, poor fish,
wanting to be happy, beaten two or three times a
week, telling me to be happy: 'Henry, smile!
why don't you ever smile?' 

and then she would smile, to show me how, and it was the
saddest smile I ever saw 

one day the goldfish died, all five of them,
they floated on the water, on their sides, their
eyes still open,
and when my father got home he threw them to the cat
there on the kitchen floor and we watched as my mother
smiled


From where I sat, 
It felt real
For a while

From where I stood, 
It felt pure
Your smile

From where I thought.
It felt good 
Your grin

From where I felt, 
It was joy
Deep within

But as your smile held hidden agenda
Mine got sent back marked 'Return to sender'A bouquet of flowers
An expensive gift
A lavish dinner
Was there really a need for all this? 
 

I appreciate every efforts of yours, but
Will it break your heart if I say, 
That even a Smile
Would have made my day? 
 

A smile that says 'I love you' and 'I care'.
A genuine smile to melt me
A smile to take me to the stars
A smile to make me all yours.

 
For love has no measure, it’s a poison of pleasure.
For love is not what money can buy, 
It's an emotion, an emotion that makes you laugh and cry.
And I say this again, that I appreciate every effort of yours; 
 

But don't go breaking your heart, when I say
That even a smile would have made my day.
For you don't need to bother much, with you I will forever stay
Because you've already taken my heart away.

 
Your Smile has made My Day! 
 

(! April,Wear a friendly smile of joy
And learn with it to enjoy

The sunshine that's present here
And fill things with joy and care

And learn to make in your way
Each life's moment a smiley day

So when you're done and through
It leaves behind fond memories for you.



When we look at the world with a smiling face
Then surely it clears all from our pace
Any dust or any glimpse of pain
And shine just like sunshine after rain

For we are not completely dressed up till
We put on smile with our will
On our faces in the hour of need
To show we can smile to clear the weed

That is spread out all over in the way
And stop us from saying  what we want to say
Specially when we see any glimpse of pain
And wish to see sunshine just after rain

So the best way to handle any problem in our pace
Is to smile and smile with a smiling face
And then trouble will clear up like weed
But for that smiling face is what we need. 

Like the silent burn of my lit cigarette, 
Growing ever so bright, fueled by its own death, 
She was there waiting for whom, I know not
Like the fumes of my lit cigarette, 
Fading away into emptiness, her gaze
Wanderd, aimless, for whome I know not.

With each breath of ecstasy, 
My eyes rolled in.
With each passing minute of agony
Her tears rolled out.

The women I speak of, I know not
Her feelings, I know not, 
Her reasons I know not.

Like a shallow bureaucrat, I watched
Like a taciturn spectator, I watched
With the cigarette trodden underfoot, i
Walked into the empty compartment.

Looked out of the stained window, I did
The wooden benches on the vacant platform felt warm.
Warmer than that cold morning.
Warmer than my callous heart. 

Smoke, withdrawal, smoke, withdrawal, cough
Smoke, withdrawal, smoke, withdrawal, cough
Buy cigarettes, smoke, withdrawal, smoke, withdrawal, cough
Smoke, smoke, withdrawal, smoke, withdrawal, buy cigarettes, cough
Smoke, withdrawal, smoke, contract emphysema, cough
Buy cigarettes, smoke, withdrawal, breathing laboured, smoke
Withdrawal, smoke, withdrawal, smoke, withdrawal, cough
Die

 - I promise to quit smoking soon
I'm down to a pack and a half. 
And when I do, I pledge to me and you
I will never, I'm never ever going back! 

I know that it is an addiction
and very expensive
and it really stinks! 

But the feel I get 
from each smoke with coffee
Is all I sometimes can feel or think. 

I want to be healthy one day
not be out of breath while walking up a flight of stairs. 
And not always hear you complain to me
but I know it's because you really care.

This is my smokers pledge to you
And I'm going to sign it when I'm through.
But not until I've had this cigarette
will I be sending a copy of this, 'Smoker's Pledge' off to you

i had a snapped heart
a snap in which i was snapped
gave me a hard hit


Monte Cristo No.Whiteout. Snow.  Glowing smokers swirl
Smouldering in their own whirlpool, 
Hissing crystals heap them high.
These scholars do not stir.
Their brown gleaming texts
Wise leaves, libraries of treasured
Moments,  furnish them with  banished pleasures.
Their defiance rises mildly to the sky
Knowing golden eyes shine 
Slow and hot in their gentle  icy grip.

 
One sees the lonely snowman.  Finds
A burning twig to stick between his lips..
The snowman smiles. 

My brother died upon a tongue

But now I with my legions come

Pelting down like frosty rain

with drifts up to your window pane.

 

Your women to the market race

As if food won’t be seen again

And you make your Home Depot run

As if some salt will stop my friends

 

We clog your walks and bury cars

And all your transportation snarl

With Blizzard force my winds do blow

blinding those who walk below.

 

No force of Sanitation will

 chase us hence from whence we spill

Nor shall your shovels pitiful

Make much dent in what we will.

 

 

Your plans all ruined- Quel Domage! 

Stay inside for all I care

Venture out to shovel me

And freeze your butt off if you dare.. 

A snowy morning--
by myself,
    chewing on dried salmon.

Society has

From the beaten path. 

Let the warmth of spring enter
Into your life my dear
Peel away the darkness of winter
And look in with smile and cheer

For spring is a season of rebirth
When we take soft sigh of peace
And get ready to enjoy colors

To cease the troubles and darkness
And swap it all with joy
The joy of love and care
That's there for all to enjoy

Where we can dream and see
Our dreams taking shape right
And spreading happiness around
By bringing the gift of life bright

Where flowers bloom and spread
Its fragrance all around
That spins the world with joy
In life's merry go round

And when spring rain comes
It washes away and drain
And let us sigh and relief
The tears of ache and pain.

Welcome Spring A soft susurrus in the night,
  A song whose singer is unseen-
'Twere poetry itself to write
  'A soft susurrus in the night!'
I know, as those mosquitos bite,
  That I forgot to fix that screen,
'A soft susurrus in the night!'
  A song whose singer is unseen. 

He is that fallen lance that lies as hurled,
That lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust,
But still lies pointed as it plowed the dust.
If we who sight along it round the world,
See nothing worthy to have been its mark,
It is because like men we look too near,
Forgetting that as fitted to the sphere,
Our missiles always make too short an arc.
They fall, they rip the grass, they intersect
The curve of earth, and striking, break their own; 
They make us cringe for metal-point on stone.
But this we know, the obstacle that checked
And tripped the body, shot the spirit on
Further than target ever showed or shone. 

His last breath went long
he was singing a song
And one after another
He faced a number of bullets
Across the border
He was brave, he had guts
He died on border
After a fierce fight
During that night
He was a brave son of mother
A true son of mother India
He died for India


Are there currently trials and tribulations in your life? 
Where as you’re going through a real hard time right? 
Chaos is still there smack dab in the middle of the fight.

Separate yourself from doubt and weakness of the rest, 
Numbers   the spirit of Caleb allowed him to possess. 

It’s too cold today, I much rather stay where it’s warm inside, 
Or maybe I’ll flee to another country for a few years and hide, 
What army in the world would ever be able to succeed? 
If soldiers only decided to serve when they felt the need. 

Armies could never win without dedication and pride, 
With a cloud blocking the sun they would run and hide, 
Everyone who’s about to go into battle will honestly admit, 
Being leery of the person behind them who's known to quit. 

We are disciplined for battle not in sunshine but rain. 
Every war is most deadly in the darkness of the ally.

Training is exceedingly, abundantly, above and beyond the norm, 
Not wearing warm-ups, sneakers or cosmetics, they wear uniforms, 
Neither will these recruits whine, frown, get angry, cry or complain, 

Being a ruler in heaven by all will not be realized, 
As with the animal kingdom only the strong survive, 
Everyone isn’t capable of being in charge of other lives. 

Leaders in eternity will not be by lottery or random pick, 
Even redirect your finances causing the outlook to look bleak,

For attacks against our youth, training can be found where? 
The motto of the Boy Scouts of America is, "Be Prepared, "
Train to be meticulous, proficient through repetition be bold, 
Suit of armor, powerful, mighty, pulling down of strongholds.

Being a general in the army which one would you prefer to command?

Is the private in basic training who shows initiative the t to promote? 
Or the out of shape sluggard always with an excuse, cracking jokes?    

"I will never fail you or forsake you" Joshua  proclaims,

No matter how tumultuous the rain that is pounding your life, 
I knew That Pontius Pilate had found a man guilty
of claiming to be a prophet and 'King of the Jews'.
I noticed how biased the Jews were at the trial: 
their elders wanted him crucified at any price.
Under pressure from the chief priests and elders, 
Our Governor, Pontius Pilate, passed the death sentence, 
which was crucifixion, for some criminals back then.
I remember this man carrying a heavy cross to Golgotha, 
which was on a hill outside the walls of Jerusalem.
To me, this man looked weak from the scourging, 
and I did notice that he fell three times to the ground, 
One of his followers, Simon, helped him carry the cross.
The man had other followers too, women who wept for him.
As a soldier, I helped nail him to the cross, 
on which he would suffer a long, lingering death, 
between two thieves, one a good thief, the other not.
We had it all set up by nine o'clock Friday morning.
'I wonder how long they will last before they die'.
At midday, though, the sun went out from the sky, 
leaving us all in the dark until three in the afternoon.
after commending his spirit to his father.

Well, I never had any religious belief before that day
but when the sun returned, and the earth shook so much
that rocks split open, and the temple curtain torn asunder, 
I was heard to say: 

 
I Live far away from my home in the military barracks
Where I have given one bed room cabin to live myself.
I live there alone myself in my cabin and 
my loneliness is kills me most of the times
It's keeps my heart beat with thoughts and tears.
Since, I have locked up myself in the barracks due to my work
I miss my home known as sweet home with love and loved ones
I miss our family get together with dine and dances.
I miss to watch our dearest kids make fun and run around the house
I miss carols and candles aglow in the night
I miss to see stockings are hanged on the mantle 
And its counts the value of love thrown in to our family
But I miss all those beautiful memories begin here alone in my barracks
But, we are the soldiers who take care of our nation round the clock
and our kids are awaiting for you"

 



This night is dark, 
yours, my day grows colder, still.
O' god the little spark you lent to me, my courage
by your grace it ebbs from me'.
Today this day is long, my soul belongs to thee.
Here when I am naught but weak.
You made me stronger still.
Stilled when I, again until it dies.

He answered heard

Patience, I am coming near.
Do you hear the marching of their feet? 
So many trapped in thought, will you grow meek? 
Inside out the great divide none but I, may hide.
The many secrets of thine brilliant eyes.
Bright light the stars you feel my warmth upon your face, 
as I come near you stilled, don't cry.
Don't fear the face of whom he is, then said, I am.

Your Whisper Still

This little spark I am your gem by grace was lent to me.
Freely given back by me, to you.
You give again to some one else in need, 
'perhaps to they, some other child.
I can hear the great black horse it's hooves sound near'! 
yours is the face, I lived to fear to be, I see, the coming of the lord.
A world in need and now again I sleep once more until. 

when you look into a soldiers eyes
you see the images locked deep inside
the torture and hate he has seen
the deaths of friends that have been
the hard decisions he has made
the killing blast of one grenade
the countless men he has killed
the dangerous missions he has fulfilled
the horrific gore
the madness of war
the deaths of the innocent, their piercing scream
now you too wont be able to dream
that steely eyed soldier was just a boy
untill war took all his joy.
so when you meet a soldier with distant eyes
think of what he has seen and why he wears that disguise. 

So many scars, 
 
attitude is not to be messed with, 
 
strength of a soldier, 
 
and people stay out the way, 
 
my ambitions as a man, 
 
walking to the field to die, 
 
nefarious they call me, 
 
reincarnation flows through me, 
 
broke but will never choke, 
 
rise above the thoughts surrounding me, 
 
when the time comes to die embrace it, 
 
fear shows weakness and hardships create enemies, 
 
fighting for all eternity, 
 
the war may end but the man will live it everyday, 
 
I won't die even when they carry me, 
 
holding onto a false hope as the blood is being spilled from me, 
 
horrid screams follow me, 
 
chaos covers me, 
 
fury and fire is normal to see, 
 
explosions is music to me, 
 
fate is apart of me. 

Great Indian Republic Sixty
Sure going fast and hefty! 
On this day - a solemn day
Services displayed might and strength
To all in the world - breadth and length! 
To the pride of many and the pain of a few
First Lady unfurled the majestic hue! 
Kazak Prez. witnessed all anew! 
On Rajpath stood the Nation's pride
Ten widows and a mother proud! 

PM sees and thanks all from his ICU
Olympic veterans fret and fume! 
Martyrs known and unknown revered.

In all the States the tricolor unfurled
Speeches made, parades held
Awards presented, copters soared! 

For the white colared, perfect holiday enjoyed.
Forgetting the flag, children enjoyed the day
In the scorching sun, cricket they play(ed) ! 

Vigilant warriors watched the borders
Terrible terrorists planned their next! 

In the biting cold and shivers
Sweepers swept the roads
Scavengers cleaned the drains
Milkmen brought the sachets
Vegetable vendors sold their stocks! 
Building workers carried concrete on heads
Half clad ladies brought bricks and sand
Labourers dug the pits to earn their daily bread! 

R-Day came and the R-Day has gone
Security beefed here and there, everywhere
Keeping vigil over the land and air! 
I-Day will come and the I-Day will go
Like water I came and like wind I go! 

When, how and who to find lasting remedies
For the evils of terrorism and akins of Satyam! 

 

A solemn thing—it was—I said—
A woman—white—to be—
Her blameless mystery—

A hallowed thing—to drop a life
Into the purple well—
Too plummetless—that it return—
Eternity—until—
I pondered how the bliss would look—
And would it feel as big—
When I could take it in my hand—
As hovering—seen—through fog—

And then—the size of this "small" life—
The Sages—call it small—
Swelled—like Horizons—in my vest—
And I sneered—softly—"small"!A Solemn thing within the Soul
To feel itself get ripe—
And golden hang—while farther up—
The Maker's Ladders stop—
And in the Orchard far below—
You hear a Being—drop—

A Wonderful—to feel the Sun
Still toiling at the Cheek
You thought was finished—
Cool of eye, and critical of Work—
He shifts the stem—a little—
To give your Core—a look—

But solemnest—to know
Your chance in Harvest moves
A little nearer—Every Sun
The Single—to some lives. 

Now as Heaven is my Lot, they're the Pests of the Nation!
Wherever they can come
With clankum and blankum
'Tis all Botheration, & Hell & Damnation,
With fun, jeering
Conjuring
Sky-staring,
Loungerin g,
And still to the tune of Transmogrification--
Those muttering
Spluttering
Ventriloquogusty
P oets
With no Hats
Or Hats that are rusty.
They're my Torment and Curse
And harass me worse
And bait me and bay me, far sorer I vow
Than the Screech of the Owl
Or the witch-wolf's long howl,
Or sheep-killing Butcher-dog's inward Bow wow
For me they all spite--an unfortunate Wight.
And the very first moment that I came to Light
A Rascal call'd Voss the more to his scandal,
Turn'd me into a sickle with never a handle.
A Night or two after a worse Rogue there came,
The head of the Gang, one Wordsworth by name--
`Ho! What's in the wind?' 'Tis the voice of a Wizzard!
I saw him look at me most terribly blue !
He was hunting for witch-rhymes from great A to Izzard,
And soon as he'd found them made no more ado
But chang'd me at once to a little Canoe.
From this strange Enchantment uncharm'd by degrees
I began to take courage & hop'd for some Ease,
When one Coleridge, a Raff of the self-same Banditti
Past by--& intending no doubt to be witty,
Because I'd th' ill-fortune his taste to displease,
     He turn'd up his nose,
     And in pitiful Prose
Made me into the half of a small Cheshire Cheese.
Well, a night or two past--it was wind, rain & hail--
And I ventur'd abroad in a thick Cloak & veil--
But the very first Evening he saw me again
The last mentioned Ruffian popp'd out of his Den--
I was resting a moment on the bare edge of Naddle
I fancy the sight of me turn'd his Brains addle--
     For what was I now?
     A complete Barley-mow
And when I climb'd higher he made a long leg,
And chang'd me at once to an Ostrich's Egg--
But now Heaven be praised in contempt of the Loon,
I am I myself I, the jolly full Moon.
     Yet my heart is still fluttering--
     For I heard the Rogue muttering--
He was hulking and skulking at the skirt of a Wood
When lightly & brightly on tip-toe I stood
On the long level Line of a motionless Cloud
And ho! what a Skittle-ground! quoth he aloud
And wish'd from his heart nine Nine-pins to see
In brightness & size just proportion'd to me.
So I fear'd from my soul,
That he'd make me a Bowl,
     But in spite of his spite
     This was more than his might
And still Heaven be prais'd! in contempt of the Loon
I am I myself I, the jolly full Moon. 

A lone flower peaks
Out over the city
From a tenement roof.
She is speechless
In her small pot
In the immense void
Of cold concrete and steel.
A solitary poet
Brought her there
To gaze upon
As he scribbles
Mad, translucent verse
Disconnected from sterile reality, 
Preserving ancient poetic breath
And breeze of idyllic
Romantic past. 

A gift expression of love
To one who deserves: 
A solitary red rose
In a slender glass vase
Sitting on the dining table, 
Next to a tall lit candle
Commanding presence
Engulfing fragrance 
Perfume the entire room
The night perfectly groomed
Stirring sea of love, swelling to prove
Staging a night of celebration of love: 
A solitary rose! 

Firm, opened petals, passion-red 
Like a blushing youth embarrassed
Gorgeous and full, inviting
Beauty at its best, displaying
As if it's making a statement
A solitary rose! 

Unspoken eye messages
Lovers send in their fixed gazes
Welling up deep love longings
To brim and overflow into love's
Full expression, culminating
Lovers' first-night's celebration
A solitary rose

Thirty brave men—some a "Seal"—
Were all professionals in their field.
Then on one somber-August day, 
Suddenly, they went away.
A nation’s heart must heal.A something in a summer's Day
As slow her flambeaux burn away
Which solemnizes me.

A something in a summer's noon—
A depth—an Azure—a perfume—
Transcending ecstasy.

And still within a summer's night
A something so transporting bright
I clap my hands to see—

Then veil my too inspecting face
Lets such a subtle—shimmering grace
Flutter too far for me—

The wizard fingers never rest—
The purple brook within the breast
Still chafes it narrow bed—

Still rears the East her amber Flag—
Guides still the sun along the Crag
His Caravan of Red—

So looking on—the night—the morn
Conclude the wonder gay—
And I meet, coming thro' the dews
Another summer's Day

I place the peonies on the windowsill -
a perfect present for the new mum, 
flushed and furry-eyed on the unmade bed.

A bonneted bundle lies in the crook of her arm.
He is small and neatly wrapped
as if he had been sent by post.

The new dad gazes at his little boy.
He looks younger than his twenty nine years
and still slightly drunk from the exhaustion of support.

Young Dylan Brendan sleeps contentedly, 
his tiny hands curl and uncurl his dreams, 
his mouth makes high pitched kitten sounds.

I find myself humming ‘The Water is Wide’
and nestling into my new name –
Grandmother. 

I wish I had a barrel of rum
and sugar three hundred pound.
I’d put it in the College bell
and stir it ‘round and ‘round.
Let ev’ry honest fellow
drink his glass of hearty cheer,
For I’m a student of old Dartmouth
and a son of a gun for beer.

I’m a son of a, son of a, son of a, 
son of a gun for beer.
I’m a son of a, son of a, son of a, 
son of a gun for beer,
Like ev’ry honest fellow I like my whiskey clear.
For I’m a student of Old Dartmouth
and a son of a gun for beer.

And if I had a daughter, sir, 
I’d dress her up in green;
I’d put her on the campus 

And if I had a son, sir, 
I’ll tell you what he’d do
He’d yell, ‘To Hell with Harvard!’ 
like his Daddy used to do.

(Chorus)COME, I will make the continent indissoluble;
   I will make the most splendid race the sun ever yet shone upon;
   I will make divine magnetic lands,
             With the love of comrades,
             With the life-long love of comrades.


   I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of
         America, and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over
         the prairies;
   I will make inseparable cities, with their arms about each other's
         necks;
           By the love of comrades,
             By the manly love of comrades.


   For you these, from me, O Democracy, to serve you, ma femme!       For you! for you, I am trilling these songs,
           In the love of comrades,
             In the high-towering love of comrades. 

Sweet dreams, form a shade
 O'er my lovely infant's head!
 Sweet dreams of pleasant streams
 By happy, silent, moony beams!
 
 Sweet Sleep, with soft down
 Weave thy brows an infant crown
 Sweet Sleep, angel mild,
 Hover o'er my happy child!
 
 Sweet smiles, in the night
 Hover over my delight!
 Sweet smiles, mother's smile,
 All the livelong night beguile.
 
 Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,
 Chase not slumber from thine eyes!
 Sweet moan, sweeter smile,
 All the dovelike moans beguile.
 
 Sleep, sleep, happy child!
 All creation slept and smiled.
 Sleep, sleep, happy sleep,
 While o'er thee doth mother weep.
 
 Sweet babe, in thy face
 Holy image I can trace;
 Sweet babe, once like thee
 Thy Maker lay, and wept for me:
 
 Wept for me, for thee, for all,
 When He was an infant small.
 Thou His image ever see,
 Heavenly face that smiles on thee!
 
 Smiles on thee, on me, on all,
 Who became an infant small;
 Infant smiles are his own smiles;
 Heaven and earth to peace beguiles. 

I wish you were here, dear,
I wish you were here. 
I wish you sat on the sofa 
and I sat near. 
The handkerchief could be yours, 
the tear could be mine, chin-bound. 
Though it could be, of course, 
the other way around.

I wish you were here, dear, 
I wish you were here. 
I wish we were in my car 
and you'd shift the gear. 
We'd find ourselves elsewhere, 
on an unknown shore. 
Or else we'd repair 
to where we've been before.

I wish you were here, dear, 
I wish you were here. 
I wish I knew no astronomy 
when stars appear, 
when the moon skims the water 
that sighs and shifts in its slumber.
I wish it were still a quarter 
to dial your number.

I wish you were here, dear, 
in this hemisphere, 
as I sit on the porch 
sipping a beer. 
It's evening, the sun is setting; 
boys shout and gulls are crying. 
What's the point of forgetting 
if it's followed by dying

Sitting at His table one day,
Hated humanity was at stake;
Well, the first picked Bonaparte;
The other drew, and for his part,
'Twas Mastai that he did take.

Impoverished abbey, thin as a sprite!
Petty prince, small and filled with spite,
Truly a thoughtless brat!
Oh what a worthless pot!
So the devil won them both at that.

You will not know what to do
With them'; the devil laughed; 'Good sir-
That's where you're wrong,' the devil said,
And of the one a pope he made,
And of the other an emperor. 

Steal from the meadows, rob the tall green hills,
Ravish my orchard's blossoms, let me bind
A crown of orchard flowers and daffodils,
Because my love is fair and white and kind.

To-day the thrush has trilled her daintiest phrases,
Flowers with their incense have made drunk the air,
Because my love is kind and white and fair.

To-day the sun has kissed the rose-tree's daughter,
And sad Narcissus, Spring's pale acolyte,
Hangs down his head and smiles into the water,
Because my love is kind and fair and white. 

I THOUGHT no more was needed
Youth to polong
Than dumb-bell and foil
To keep the body young.

O who could have foretold
That thc heart grows old?

Though I have many words,
What woman's satisfied,
I am no longer faint
Because at her side?

O who could have foretold
That the heart grows old?

I have not lost desire
But the heart that I had;
I th


Ought 'twould burn my body
Laid on the death-bed,

For who could have foretold
That the heart grows old

The Shape alone let others prize,
The Features of the Fair;
I look for Spirit in her Eyes,
And Meaning in her Air.
A Damask Cheek, an Iv'ry Arm,
Shall ne'er my Wishes win,
Give me an animated Form,
That speaks a Mind within.
A Face where awful Honour shines,
Where Sense and Sweetness move,
And Angel Innocence refines,
The Tenderness of Love.

These are the Soul of Beauty's frame,
Without whose vital Aid,
Unfinish'd all her Features seem,
And all her Roses dead.
But ah! where both their Charms unite,
How perfect is the View,
With ev'ry Image of Delight,
With Graces ever new.
Of Pow'r to charm the greatest Woe,
The wildest Rage controul,
Diffusing Mildness o'er the Brow,
And Rapture thro' the Soul.
Their Pow'r but faintly to express,
All Language must despair,
But go behold 
Arpasia's
Face,
And read it perfect there. 

Life is all the simple things
That we do and say.
And the much bigger things
That come into play.  

Life is joy and sorrow
As we go along.
The smile and the tear.
The happy and sad song.

Life is the young child
And the aged one.
Life is all the days.
And when the days are done.

Life is the great mountains.
And the sandy shores.
And life is the wildflowers
That one so adores.

Life is the ole owl—
As wise as it could be.
For life is everything
That pertains to you and me. 

I.
There was a naughty boy,
A naughty boy was he,
He would not stop at home,
He could not quiet be-
He took
In his knapsack
A book
Full of vowels
And a shirt
With some towels,
A slight cap
For night cap,
A hair brush,
Comb ditto,
New stockings
For old ones
Would split O!
This knapsack
Tight at's back
He rivetted close
And followed his nose
To the north,
To the north,
And follow'd his nose
To the north.

II.
There was a naughty boy
And a naughty boy was he,
For nothing would he do
But scribble poetry-
He took
An ink stand
In his hand
And a pen
Big as ten
In the other,
And away
In a pother
He ran
To the mountains
And fountains
And ghostes
And postes
And witches
And ditches
And wrote
In his coat
When the weather
Was cool,
Fear of gout,
And without
When the weather
Was warm-
Och the charm
When we choose
To follow one's nose
To the north,
To the north,
To follow one's nose
To the north!

III.
There was a naughty boy
And a naughty boy was he,
He kept little fishes
In washing tubs three
In spite
Of the might
Of the maid
Nor afraid
Of his Granny-good-
He often would
Hurly burly
Get up early
And go
By hook or crook
To the brook
And bring home
Miller's thumb,
Tittlebat
Not over fat,
Minnows small
As the stall
Of a glove,
Not above
The size
Of a nice
Little baby's
Little fingers-
O he made
'Twas his trade
Of fish a pretty kettle
A kettle-
A kettle
Of fish a pretty kettle
A kettle!

IV.
There was a naughty boy,
And a naughty boy was he,
He ran away to Scotland
The people for to see-
There he found
That the ground
Was as hard,
That a yard
Was as long,
That a song
Was as merry,
That a cherry
Was as red,
That lead
Was as weighty,
That fourscore
Was as eighty,
That a door
Was as wooden
As in England-
So he stood in his shoes
And he wonder'd,
He wonder'd,
He stood in his
Shoes and he wonder'd. 

When the body's tired, 
And the soul is weary, 
And sleep calls one's name, 
Night is a beautiful thing.

Like a blanket, it covers
To bring sweet rest; 
‘Tis rejuvenation 
At its best.

Night nurtures and restores
That lost during the day—
Uniquely, it was designed
To work that way. 

Two men came out of Shannon's, having known
The faces of each other for so long
As they had listened there to an old song,
Sung thinly in a wastrel monotone
By some unhappy night-bird, who had flown
Too many times and with a wing too strong
To save himself; and so done heavy wrong
To more frail elements than his alone.

Slowly away they went, leaving behind
More light than was before them. Neither met
The other's eyes again or said a word.
Each to his loneliness or to his kind,
Went his own way, and with his own regret,
Not knowing what the other may have heard. 

Wind of the dead men's feet,
Blow down the empty street
Of this old city by the sea
With news for me!
Blow me beyond the grime
And pestilence of time!
I am too sick at heart to war
With failure any more.
Thy chill is in my bones;
The moonlight on the stones
Is pale, and palpable, and cold;
I am as one grown old.

I call from room to room
Through the deserted gloom;
The echoes are all words I know,
Lost in some long ago.

I prowl from door to door,
And find no comrade more.
The wolfish fear that children feel
Is snuffing at my heel.

I hear the hollow sound
Of a great ship coming round,
The thunder of tackle and the tread
Of sailors overhead.

That stormy-blown hulloo
Has orders for me, too.
I see thee, hand at mouth, and hark,
My captain of the dark.

O wind of the great East,
By whom we are released
From this strange dusty port to sail
Beyond our fellows' hail,

Under the stars that keep
The entry of the deep,
Thy somber voice brings up the sea's
Forgotten melodies;

And I have no more need
Of bread, or wine, or creed,
Bound for the colonies of time
Beyond the farthest prime.

Wind of the dead men's feet,
Blow through the empty street;
The last adventurer am I,
Then, world, goodby

I read a lovely poem 
Just on the other day
The words touched my heart
For what the poem did say.

Such little poem I take with me
Wherever I might go
And read it, e’er I have the chance
Because I like it so.

The verses, rhyme and imagery 
Deeply speak to me
With a thoughtful message 
That I can clearly see.

What a lovely poem.
What a lovely little poem.
What a lovely little poem
That speaks to me. 

How grand the human race would be
     If every man would wear a kilt,
A flirt of Tartan finery,
     Instead of trousers, custom built!
Nay, do not think I speak to joke:
     (You know I'm not that kind of man),
I am convinced that all men folk.
     Should wear the costume of a Clan.
 
Imagine how it's braw and clean
     As in the wind it flutters free;
And so conducive to hygiene
     In its sublime simplicity.
No fool fly-buttons to adjust,--
     Wi' shanks and maybe buttocks bare;
Oh chiels, just take my word on trust,
     A bonny kilt's the only wear.

'Twill save a lot of siller too,
     (And here a canny Scotsman speaks),
For one good kilt will wear you through
     A half-a-dozen pairs of breeks.
And how it's healthy in the breeze!
     And how it swings with saucy tilt!
How lassies love athletic knees
     Below the waggle of a kilt!

True, I just wear one in my mind,
     Since sent to school by Celtic aunts,
When girls would flip it up behind,
     Until I begged for lowland pants.
But now none dare do that to me,
     And so I sing with lyric lilt,--
How happier the world would be
     If every male would wear a kilt

Labor Day was founded
In the 
To be celebrated
By working men and ladies.
It grew to become
A national holiday.
A phenomenal hit
In every way.
Street parades and festivals
Celebrated such time, 
Topped by Labor Sunday
To rein-in the chimes.    
As the years have passed, 
It’s a bit toned down, 
But is yet a hit
In every state and town. 

Stay yet, my friends, a moment stay— 
     Stay till the good old year, 
So long companion of our way, 
     Shakes hands, and leaves us here. 
          Oh stay, oh stay, 
One little hour, and then away.

The year, whose hopes were high and strong, 
     Has now no hopes to wake; 
Yet one hour more of jest and song 
     For his familiar sake. 
          Oh stay, oh stay, 
One mirthful hour, and then away.  

The kindly year, his liberal hands 
     Have lavished all his store. 
And shall we turn from where he stands, 
     Because he gives no more? 
          Oh stay, oh stay, 
One grateful hour, and then away.  

Days brightly came and calmly went, 
     While yet he was our guest; 
How cheerfully the week was spent! 
     How sweet the seventh day's rest! 
          Oh stay, oh stay, 
One golden hour, and then away.  

Dear friends were with us, some who sleep 
     Beneath the coffin-lid: 
What pleasant memories we keep 
     Of all they said and did! 
          Oh stay, oh stay, 
One tender hour, and then away.  

Even while we sing, he smiles his last, 
     And leaves our sphere behind. 
The good old year is with the past; 
     Oh be the new as kind! 
          Oh stay, oh stay, 
One parting strain, and then away. 

Let peace and harmony, 
Like a dove, 
Light every heart
With the fire of love.

Let all peoples of the earth
(Everyone of every kind)   
Lift their voices up for peace
With like-kindred minds.

Let everything that is akin 
To darkness be disarmed, 
And the aura of light shine
With its perfect charm.>It is now ten years later.
And emotions are yet raw.
Folks can never forget
What they heard and saw.

Indelible images, 
Of the worst kind, 
Forever a nightmare—
Etched in the mind.

Innocent souls—
Gone in a flash.
Lives and buildings, 
Reduced to ash.

Hearts yet pining
For the evil done
On September eleven, 
Two thousand one. 

WHAT song is best for the soldiers? 
Take no heed of the words, nor choose yon the style of the story;
Let it burst out from the heart like a spring from the womb of a mountain,
Natural, clear, resistless, leaping its way to the levels;
Whether of love or hate or war or the pathos and pain of affliction;
Whether of manly pluck in the perilous hour, or that which is higher,
And highest of all, the slowly bleeding sacrifice,
The giving of life and its joys for the sake of men and freedom;—
Any song for the soldier that will harmonize with the life-throbs;
For he has laved in the mystical sea by which men are one;
His pulse has thrilled into blinding tune with the vaster anthems
And the song of the earth-planet bursts on the silent spheres.
Shot through like the cloud of Etna with flames of heroic devotion, 
And shaded with quivering lines from the mourning of women and children!

Here is a song for the soldiers—a song of the Cheyenne Indians, 
Of men with soldierly hearts who walked with Death as a comrade. 
Hush! Let the present fade; let the distance die; let the last year stand: 
We are far to the West, in Montana, on the desolate plains of Montana; 
We ride with the cavalry troopers on the bloody trail of the Cheyennes,
Forty braves of the tribe who have leaped from the reservation
Down on the mining camps in their desecrated valleys, 
Down to their fathers' graves and the hunting-ground of their people.

Chilled with the doom of Death they gaze on the white men's changes: 
Ruthless the brutal force that has crushed their homes and their manhood, 
And ruthless the hearts of the Cheyenne braves as they swoop on the camps of the miners! 
Back to the hills they dash, with reeking trophies around them:
But swift on their trail the cavalry ride, and their trumpets 
Break on the ears of the braves with a threat of oncoming vengeance.

At last they are bayed and barred—corraled in a straightwalled valley,—
The Indians back to the cliffs with the shattered rocks as a breastwork,
The soldiers in lined stockades across the mouth of the valley.
Hungrily hiss the bullets, not wasted in random firing, 
But every shot for a mark,—thrice their number of soldiers 
Raking the Cheyenne rocks with a pitiless rain of missiles, 
One to three in the firing, but every Cheyenne bullet 
Tumbled a reckless trooper behind his fence in the stockade.

Three, ay, five to one, if you count their dead and their wounded: 
Damn them! why don't they yield for the sake of their lives and their wounded?'

But never a sign but flame and the hiss of the leaden defiance
Comes from the Cheyenne braves, though their firing slackens in vigor
To grow in fatal precision—grim as the cliff above them
They fight their fight, and the valley is lined with death from their rifles.
Cried the captain, ''Men, we must charge!' and he grieves for his boys and their foemen;
'But show them a sign of quarter;' and he swings them a flag to tell them
That his side is willing to parley: the Indians riddle the ensign,
And the captain groans in his heart as he gives the order for charging.
Terrible getting ready of men who prepare for a death-fight:—
Scabbards are thrown aside and belts unstrapped for the striking,
Ominous outward signs of the deadlier inner preparing
When the soul flings danger aside and the human heart its mercy.

Out from the fatal earthworks, their eyes like fire in a 
With naked blades the troopers, and nerves wire-strung for the onset, 
When suddenly, up from the rocks, a sign at last from the Cheyennes!

Two tall braves on the rocks—'Re-form!' brays the cavalry trumpet, 
And grimly the soldiers return, reluctantly leaving the conflict. 
Still on the rocks two forms of bronze, as if prepared for the stormers, 
Then down to the field, and behold, they dash toward the wondering troopers! 
The soldiers stare at the charge, but no man laughs at the foemen,
Instead of a sneer a tremor at many a mouth in sorrow. 
On they come to their death, and, standing at fifty paces, 
They fire in the face of the squadron, and dash with their knives to the death-grip! 
Fifty rifles give flame, and the breasts of the heroes are shattered; 
But falling, they plunge toward the fight, and their knives sink deep in the meadow!

'On to the rocks!' and the soldiers have done with their feelings of mercy— 
But never a foe to meet them nor a shot from the deadly barrier. 
First on the rocks the captain, with a cheer that died as he gave it,—
A cheer that was half a groan and a cry of admiration. 
Awed stood the troopers who followed, and lowered their swords with their leader, 
Homage of brave to the brave, saluting with souls and weapons; 
There at their feet lay the foemen—every man dead on his rifle— 
The two who had charged the troops were the last alive of the Cheyennes

FROM harmony, from heavenly harmony, 
  This universal frame began: 
  When nature underneath a heap 
  Of jarring atoms lay, 
  And could not heave her head, 
The tuneful voice was heard from high, 
  'Arise, ye more than dead!' 
Then cold, and hot, and moist, and dry, 
  In order to their stations leap, 
  And Music's power obey. 
From harmony, from heavenly harmony, 
  This universal frame began: 
  From harmony to harmony 
Through all the compass of the notes it ran, 
The diapason closing full in Man. 

What passion cannot Music raise and quell? 
  When Jubal struck the chorded shell, 
  His listening brethren stood around, 
  And, wondering, on their faces fell 
  To worship that celestial sound: 
  Within the hollow of that shell, 
  That spoke so sweetly, and so well. 
What passion cannot Music raise and quell? 

  The trumpet's loud clangour 
  Excites us to arms, 
  With shrill notes of anger, 
  And mortal alarms. 
  The double double double beat 
  Of the thundering drum 
  Cries Hark! the foes come; 
  Charge, charge, 'tis too late to retreat! 

  The soft complaining flute, 
  In dying notes, discovers 
  The woes of hopeless lovers, 
Whose dirge is whisper'd by the warbling lute. 

  Sharp violins proclaim 
  Their jealous pangs and desperation, 
  Fury, frantic indignation, 
  Depth of pains, and height of passion, 
  For the fair, disdainful dame. 

  But O, what art can teach, 
  What human voice can reach, 
  The sacred organ's praise? 
  Notes inspiring holy love, 
  Notes that wing their heavenly ways 
  To mend the choirs above. 

  Orpheus could lead the savage race; 
  And trees unrooted left their place, 
  Sequacious of the lyre; 
But bright Cecilia rais'd the wonder higher: 
When to her organ vocal breath was given, 
  An angel heard, and straight appear'd 
  Mistaking Earth for Heaven. 

GRAND CHORUS. 

As from the power of sacred lays 
  The spheres began to move, 
And sung the great Creator's praise 
  To all the Blest above; 
So when the last and dreadful hour 
This crumbling pageant shall devour, 
The trumpet shall be heard on high, 
The dead shall live, the living die, 
And Music shall untune the sky

THE Year of the Sorrows went out with great wind: 
And He shall call His flock home where no storms be
Into a sheltered haven out of sound of the sea. 

There shall be bright sands there and a milken hill, 
They shall lie in the sun there and drink their fill, 
They shall have dew and shade there and grass to the knee, 
Safe in a sheltered haven out of sound of the sea. 

He shall bind their wounds up and their tears shall cease: 
They shall have sweetest pillows and a bed of ease. 
Come up, come up and hither, O little flock, saith He, 
Ye shall have sheltered havens out of sound of the sea.

The first day of New Year strewed the sea with dead. 
Lift up, lift up, O broken heart and hanging head! 
They shall have sheltered havens out of sound of the sea. 

Ignorance is just a state of mind, 
Another one of my numerous crimes.
And as I hear the void call out my name, 
I know there’s nothing I can say.
Loneliness is just a friend of mine, 
Another way for me to pass the time.
Another day, another way to play, 
And there is nothing I can say.
Emptiness is just a state of mind, 
Another chance for me to unwind.
And as I see the sky turn to grey, 
I know there’s nothing I can say.
Passed what is wrong I find what’s right, 
The kind of thing that fools the kind.
And in this place what come what may, 
I find there’s nothing I can say.
Ignorance is just a state of mind, 
Another one of my numerous crimes.
As life goes on I learn what part I play, 
Yet still there’s nothing I can say. 

UP, laggards of Freedom! — our free flag is cast
To the blaze of the sun and the wings of the blast;
Will ye turn from a struggle so bravely begun,
From a foe that is breaking, a field that's half won?
Let him join that foe's service, accursed and abhorred!
Let him do his base will, as the slave only can, —
Let him put on the bloodhound, and put off the Man!
Let him go where the cold blood that creeps in his veins
Shall stiffen the slave-whip, and rust on his chains;
Where the black slave shall laugh in his bonds, to behold
The White Slave beside him, self-lettered and sold!
But ye, who still boast of hearts beating and warm,
Rise, from lake shore and ocean's, like waves in a storm,
Come, throng round our banner in Liberty's name,
Like winds from your mountains, like prairies aflame!
Our foe, hidden long in his ambush of night,
Now, forced from his covert, stands black in the light.
Smite him down to the earth, that is cursed where he trod!
For deeper than thunder of summer's loud shower,
Shall we falter before what we're prayed for so long,
When the Wrong is so weak, and the Right is so strong?
Come forth all together! come old and come young,
Freedom's vote in each hand, and her song on each tongue;
Truth naked is stronger than Falsehood in mail;
The Wrong cannot prosper, the Right cannot fail!
Like leaves of the summer once numbered the foe,
But the hoar-frost is falling, the northern winds blow;
Like leaves of November erelong shall they fall,
All for Jenny and Nancy.'
Balow lalow or Hey derry down,
Or else what might you fancy?

Is there any song sweet enough
For Nancy and for Jenny?
Said Simple Simon to the pieman,
'Indeed I know not any.'

'I've counted the miles to Babylon,
I've flown the earth like a bird,
I've ridden cock-horse to Banbury Cross,
But no such song have I heard.'

'Some speak of Alexander,
And some of Hercules,
But where are there any like Nancy and Jenny,
Where are there any like these.


'When I am thinking
alone in my room
I get this feeling
you're thinking it too

and maybe I am wrong
to think this in my head
when my heart
sings this song for you

Some thing inside me
tells me I have met
a friend beside me
but only time can tell

and maybe I am wrong
to think this in my head
when my heart
sings a song for you

Loosing myself 
in the clutter of attraction
Playing is fun
it's a matter of reaction

but maybe I'm wrong
to think this in my head
when my heart sings this song for you
when my heart sings this song for you
my heart sings this song for you.



To ease the sickness of the soul, 
Let Phoebis every string explore, 
And Bacchus fill the sprightly bowl:
Let them their friendly aid employ
To make my Cloe's absense light,
And seek for pleasure to destroy
The sorrows of this live-long night.

But she to-morrow will return:
Venus, be thou to-morrow great;
Thy myrtles strow, thy odours burn,
And meet thy favourite nymph in state,
Kind goddess, to no other powers
Let us to-morrow's blessings own,
Thy darling Loves shall guide the hours, 
And all the day be thine alone. 

When he saw her in heels
he said she’s the one so
he said his "I do, " never to 
climb a different mountain.

That night he began  
at her ankles, climbed 
seams in her stockings, 
moved over her hips

and circled her waist, 
strolled up her spine and 
stood on her shoulders, 
took a deep breath and

rappelled to the smile 
he saw on her breasts. 
Many years later his life 
is a song in her valley. 

Clouds gather, treetops toss and sway;
But pour us wine, an old one!
That we may turn this dreary day
To golden; yes, to golden!

What if the storm outside destroy
Nature must sweep the old away 
To bring on a new season. 

What if some aching dread we feel?
Lift glasses, all, and ring them!
True hearts, we know, will never quail
Whatever fortune brings them!

Clouds gather, treetops toss and sway;
But pour us wine, an old one!
That we may turn this dreary day
To golden, yes, to golden!

Autumn has come, but never fear,
Wait but a little while yet,
Spring will be here, the skies will clear, 
And fields stand deep in violets.

The heavenly blue of fresh new days
Oh, friend, you must employ them
Before they pass away. Be brave!
Enjoy them; oh, enjoy them

I’ve stayed in the front yard all my life.
I want a peek at the back
Where it’s rough and untended and hungry weed grows.   
A girl gets sick of a rose.

I want to go in the back yard now   
And maybe down the alley,
To where the charity children play.   
I want a good time today.

They do some wonderful things.
They have some wonderful fun.
My mother sneers, but I say it’s fine
How they don’t have to go in at quarter to nine.   
My mother, she tells me that Johnnie Mae   
Will grow up to be a bad woman.
That George’ll be taken to Jail soon or late
(On account of last winter he sold our back gate).

But I say it’s fine. Honest, I do.
And I’d like to be a bad woman, too,
And wear the brave stockings of night-black lace   
And strut down the streets with paint on my face. 

Where has the sun gone, hiding? 
The brightness, receding
Where shall I go, it searching? 
The ocean kept asking-

Where have the birds gone, chiming? 
Their music, vanishing
Where shall I find them singing? 
The sky remained quizzing-

Where have the blooms gone, fading? 
Their fragrance, lingering
Where shall I go, them hunting? 
The earth kept requesting-

Why can’t wait until morning? 
The wind murmured smiling: 
'Nature comes, all retrieving
You all pay thanksgiving'!

October 

The white broom flatt'ring her flowers in calm June weather,
 'O most sweet wear;
Forty-eight weeks of my life do none desire me,
 Four am I fair,'

 Quoth the brown bee
 'In thy white wear
 Four thou art fair.
 A mystery
 Of honeyed snow
 In scented air
 The bee lines flow
 Straight unto thee.
 Great boon and bliss
 All pure I wis,
 And sweet to grow
 Ay, so to give
 That many live.
 Now as for me,
 I,' quoth the bee,
 'Have not to give,
 Through long hours sunny
 Gathering I live:
 Aye debonair
 Sailing sweet air
 After my fare,
 Bee-bread and honey.
 In thy deep coombe,
 O thou white broom,
 Where no leaves shake,
 Brake,
 Bent nor clover,
 I a glad rover,
 Thy calms partake,
 While winds of might
 From height to height
 Go bodily over.
 Till slanteth light,
 And up the rise
 Thy shadow lies,
 A shadow of white,
 A beauty-lender
 Pathetic, tender.

 Short is thy day?
 Answer with 'Nay,'
 Longer the hours
 That wear thy flowers
 Than all dull, cold
 Years manifold
 That gift withhold.
 A long liver,
 O honey-giver,
 Thou by all showing
 Art made, bestowing,
 I envy not
 Thy greater lot,
 Nor thy white wear.
 But, as for me,
 I,' quoth the bee,
 'Never am fair.'

II.

The nightingale lorn of his note in darkness brooding
 Deeply and long,
'Two sweet months spake the heart to the heart. Alas! all's over,
 O lost my song.'

 One in the tree,
 'Hush now! Let be:
 The song at ending
 Left my long tending
 Over als򮍊 Let be, let us go
 Across the wan sea.

 The little ones care not,
 And I fare not
 Amiss with thee.

 Thou hast sung all,
 This hast thou had.
 Love, be not sad;
 It shall befall
 Assuredly,
 When the bush buddeth
 And the bank studdeth—
 Where grass is sweet
 And damps do fleet,
 Her delicate beds
 With daisy heads
 That the Stars Seven
 Leaned down from heaven
 Shall sparkling mark
 In the warm dark
 Thy most dear strain
 Which ringeth aye true—
 Piercing vale, croft
 Lifted aloft
 Dropt even as dew
 With a sweet quest
 To her on the nest
 When damps we love
 Fall from above.

 'Art thou asleep?
 Answer me, answer me,
 Night is so deep
 Thy right fair form
 I cannot see;
 Answer me, answer me,
 Are the eggs warm?
 Is't well with thee?'

 Ay, this shall be
 Assuredly.
 Ay, thou full fain
 In the soft rain
 Shalt sing again.'


III.

A fair wife making her moan, despised, forsaken,
  Her good days o'er;
  Seven—no more.'

 Then Echo woke—and spoke
  'No more—no more,'
 And a wave broke
  On the sad shore
 When Echo said
  'No more,'

 Nought else made reply,
 Nor land, nor loch, nor sky
 Did any comfort try,
 But the wave spread
 Echo's faint tone
 Alone,
 All down the desolate shore,
 'No more—no more.

'In vain you tell your parting lover
You wish fair winds may waft him over
Alas! what winds can happy prove
That bear me far from what I love?
Alas! what dangers on the main
Can equal those that I sustain
From slighted vows and cold disdain?

Be gentle, and in pity choose
To wish the wildest tempests loose,
That thrown again upon the coast
Where first my shipwreck'd heart was lost,
I may once more repeat my pain,
Once more in dying notes complain
Of slighted vows and cold disdain. 

BENEATH thy skies, November!
Thy skies of cloud and rain,
Around our blazing camp-fires
We close our ranks again.
Then sound again the bugles,
Call the muster-roll anew;
If months have well-nigh won the field,
What may not four years do?
Takes once more her ancient place;
Again the Pilgrim's banner
Leads the vanguard of the race.
Then sound again the bugles, etc.
Along the lordly Hudson,
A shout of triumph breaks;
The Empire State is speaking,
From the ocean to the lakes.
Then sound again the bugles, etc.
The Northern hills are blazing,
The Northern skies are bright;
And the fair young West is turning
Her forehead to the light!
Then sound again the bugles,. etc.
Push every outpost nearer,
Press hard the hostile towers!
Another Balaklava,
And the Malakoff is ours!
Then sound again the bugles,
Call the muster-roll anew;
If months have well-nigh won the field,
What may not four years do

A slip of the moon hangs over the capital; 
Ten thousand washing-mallets are pounding; 
And the autumn wind is blowing my heart 
For ever and ever toward the Jade Pass. . 
Oh, when will the Tartar troops be conquered, 
And my husband come back from the long campaign

My hair had hardly covered my forehead. 
I was picking flowers, paying by my door, 
When you, my lover, on a bamboo horse, 
Came trotting in circles and throwing green plums. 
We lived near together on a lane in Ch'ang-kan, 
Both of us young and happy-hearted. 

.  

At fourteen I became your wife, 
So bashful that I dared not smile, 
And I lowered my head toward a dark corner 
And would not turn to your thousand calls; 
But at fifteen I straightened my brows and laughed, 
Learning that no dust could ever seal our love, 
That even unto death I would await you by my post 
And would never lose heart in the tower of silent watching. 

.  

Then when I was sixteen, you left on a long journey 
Through the Gorges of Ch'u-t'ang, of rock and whirling water. 
And then came the Fifth-month, more than I could bear, 
And I tried to hear the monkeys in your lofty far-off sky. 
Your footprints by our door, where I had watched you go, 
Were hidden, every one of them, under green moss, 
Hidden under moss too deep to sweep away. 
And the first autumn wind added fallen leaves. 
And now, in the Eighth-month, yellowing butterflies 
Hover, two by two, in our west-garden grasses 
And, because of all this, my heart is breaking 
And I fear for my bright cheeks, lest they fade. 

.  

Oh, at last, when you return through the three Pa districts, 
Send me a message home ahead! 
And I will come and meet you and will never mind the distance, 
All the way to Chang-feng Sha

"Sleep, weary ones, while ye may --
         Sleep, oh, sleep!"
                              Eugene Field.



Thro' May time blossoms, with whisper low,
The soft wind sang to the dead below:
 "Think not with regret on the Springtime's song
 And the task ye left while your hands were strong.
 The song would have ceased when the Spring was past,
 And the task that was joyous be weary at last


To the winter sky when the nights were long
The tree-tops tossed with a ceaseless song:
 "Do ye think with regret on the sunny days
 And the path ye left, with its untrod ways?
 The sun might sink in a storm cloud's frown
 And the path grow rough when the night came down


In the grey twilight of the autumn eves,
It sighed as it sang through the dying leaves:
 "Ye think with regret that the world was bright,
 That your path was short and your task was light;
 The path, though short, was perhaps the best
 And the toil was sweet, that it led to rest

"The line breaks and the guns go under, 
The lords and the lackeys ride the plain; 
I draw deep breaths of the dawn and thunder, 
And the whole of my heart grows young again. 
For our chiefs said 'Done,' and I did not deem it; 
Our seers said 'Peace,' and it was not peace; 
Earth will grow worse till men redeem it, 
And wars more evil, ere all wars cease. 
But the old flags reel and the old drums rattle, 
As once in my life they throbbed and reeled; 
I have found my youth in the lost battle, 
I have found my heart on the battlefield. 
   For we that fight till the world is free, 
   We are not easy in victory: 
   We have known each other too long, my brother, 
   And fought each other, the world and we. 

And I dream of the days when work was scrappy, 
And rare in our pockets the mark of the mint, 
When we were angry and poor and happy, 
And proud of seeing our names in print. 
For so they conquered and so we scattered, 
When the Devil road and his dogs smelt gold, 
And the peace of a harmless folk was shattered; 
When I was twenty and odd years old. 
When the mongrel men that the market classes 
Had slimy hands upon England's rod, 
And sword in hand upon Afric's passes 
   For the men no lords can buy or sell, 
   They sit not easy when all goes well, 
   They have said to each other what naught can smother, 
   They have seen each other, our souls and hell. 

It is all as of old, the empty clangour, 
The Nothing scrawled on a five-foot page, 
The huckster who, mocking holy anger, 
Painfully paints his face with rage. 
And the faith of the poor is faint and partial, 
And the pride of the rich is all for sale, 
And the chosen heralds of England's Marshal 
Are the sandwich-men of the Daily Mail, 
And the niggards that dare not give are glutted, 
And the feeble that dare not fail are strong, 
So while the City of Toil is gutted, 
I sit in the saddle and sing my song. 
   For we that fight till the world is free, 
   We have no comfort in victory; 
   We have read each other as Cain his brother, 
   We know each other, these slaves and we. 

The memory of you emerges from the night around me.
The river mingles its stubborn lament with the sea.

Deserted like the wharves at dawn.
It is the hour of departure, oh deserted one! 

Cold flower heads are raining over my heart.
Oh pit of debris, fierce cave of the shipwrecked.

In you the wars and the flights accumulated.
From you the wings of the song birds rose.

You swallowed everything, like distance.
Like the sea, like time. In you everything sank! 

It was the happy hour of assault and the kiss.
The hour of the spell that blazed like a lighthouse.

Pilot's dread, fury of blind driver,
turbulent drunkenness of love, in you everything sank! 

In the childhood of mist my soul, winged and wounded.
Lost discoverer, in you everything sank! 

You girdled sorrow, you clung to desire,
sadness stunned you, in you everything sank! 

I made the wall of shadow draw back,
beyond desire and act, I walked on.

Oh flesh, my own flesh, woman whom I loved and lost,
I summon you in the moist hour, I raise my song to you.

Like a jar you housed infinite tenderness.
and the infinite oblivion shattered you like a jar.

There was the black solitude of the islands,
and there, woman of love, your arms took me in.

There was thirst and hunger, and you were the fruit.
There were grief and ruins, and you were the miracle.

Ah woman, I do not know how you could contain me
in the earth of your soul, in the cross of your arms! 

How terrible and brief my desire was to you! 
How difficult and drunken, how tensed and avid.

Cemetery of kisses, there is still fire in your tombs,
still the fruited boughs burn, pecked at by birds.

Oh the bitten mouth, oh the kissed limbs,
oh the hungering teeth, oh the entwined bodies.

Oh the mad coupling of hope and force
in which we merged and despaired.

And the tenderness, light as water and as flour.
And the word scarcely begun on the lips.

This was my destiny and in it was my voyage of my longing,
and in it my longing fell, in you everything sank! 

Oh pit of debris, everything fell into you,
what sorrow did you not express, in what sorrow are you not drowned! 

From billow to billow you still called and sang.
Standing like a sailor in the prow of a vessel.

You still flowered in songs, you still brike the currents.
Oh pit of debris, open and bitter well.

Pale blind diver, luckless slinger,
lost discoverer, in you everything sank! 

It is the hour of departure, the hard cold hour
which the night fastens to all the timetables.

The rustling belt of the sea girdles the shore.
Cold stars heave up, black birds migrate.

Deserted like the wharves at dawn.
Only tremulous shadow twists in my hands.

Oh farther than everything. Oh farther than everything.

It is the hour of departure. Oh abandoned one

The night rain sing the song
To benumb my soul all along.
Grief breaks heart's fence
Over the hills of silence
The song of despair! 
Floats everywhere in air 
The song of despair
Floats everywhere; 
Till the depth of heart's creek
To cascade tears through the cheek.
One's heart becomes stone-dead
When their most loved left its stead.
Eyes then lost fore'er its shine, 
Nothing will follow there but a shadow; 
The only crony I've to say as mine
To walk with me in this despair-meadow.
Once in a medow of love I walked
With my lover and we stalked
Holding her hand in my wrist, 
Holding my hand around her waist.
We woven the wings of dreams
And built castles on streams
Life was an ever opened book
Where the moments of love we took, 
To draw the most beautiful pictures on its pages
As our hearts were one as a land with no rages
Everytime the hands of destiny write its word
The golden pages of life was engulfed by rust
That made the glitter of love blurred, 
Eyes scatter the seeds of despair in dust
No one knows what's destiny, 
Until they feel what's despair

Swimming on the surface of the soft, silky sea; 
Surfacing upon each wave that breaks free; 
Running with the floodtide as the moon is full; 
Brightly it shimmers silver upon our school. 

Chorus: 
Running with white horses, running with the sea; 
Diving and jumping - my mate swims next to me; 

We pass by Portlogan on our way to Clyde; 
View the rugged coast thru flotsam on the tide; 
Past the Craig and Arran, to the south of Skye 
And gaze the Coulan mountains as we swim by. 

On-course for the Dornoch Firth come summer’s sun, 
Our journey round your green land is now begun; 
Cutting thru satin-blue; diving down and deep; 
Up we race in Freedom’s smiling pleasure leap. 

You can see us from the cliffs, jumping the blue; 
We’re guests, alive in paradise, just like you. 
Must you turn our joy into a salt-sea tear? 
So many dolphins die by man’s hand each year. 

A song of Enchantment I sang me there,
In a green-green wood, by waters fair,
Just as the words came up to me
I sang it under the wild wood tree. 

Widdershins turned I, singing it low,
Watching the wild birds come and go;
No cloud in the deep dark blue to be seen
Under the thick-thatched branches green. 

Twilight came: silence came:
The planet of Evening's silver flame;
By darkening paths I wandered through
Thickets trembling with drops of dew. 

But the music is lost and the words are gone
Of the song I sang as I sat alone,
Ages and ages have fallen on me -
On the wood and the pool and the elder tree. 

Once, at night, in the manor wood
   My Love and I long silent stood,
   Amazed that any heavens could
Decree to part us, bitterly repining.
   My Love, in aimless love and grief,
   Reached forth and drew aside a leaf
   That just above us played the thief
And stole our starlight that for us was shining.

   A star that had remarked her pain
   Shone straightway down that leafy lane,
   And wrought his image, mirror-plain,
Within a tear that on her lash hung gleaming.
   "Thus Time," I cried, "is but a tear
   Some one hath wept 'twixt hope and fear,
   Yet in his little lucent sphere
Our star of stars, Eternity, is beaming

"Blow the sail, boatman, in this unruly wind. Removing the sweat 
of destiny, grip the oar in the blister-stricken hand.
With successive strokes of faith, go forward cutting the angry waves
and keep muttering the name of the kinsman of your existence.

Boatman, keep singing your soul-crushing song in his name.
In his name, raise an uncontrollable uproar of wailing. Watch the river resonate under the green wind, resonate the banks and waves. 
In this wind, boatman, blow your sail of faith.

In his name, the night blooms into dawn shedding down all darkness.
In his name, the moon splits into two pieces of watermelon.
In his name, the river turns into the desired spring of honey.
Keep singing in his name, boatman, the song of faith.

If you cherish the coast of fortune having cut the angry waves, 
with the oar in hand, o boatman, start singing ‘Rasul! Rasul*! '


*Mohammad(Sm) 
[Translation of Bangla poem 'Biswaser Bhatiali' taken from the poet's first book 'Pronoyer Prothom Pap' ( ]I would not like to live to be very old,
To be stripped cold and bare
Of all my leafage that was green and gold
In the delicious air.

I would not choose to live to be left alone,
The children gone away,
And the true love that I have leant upon
No more my staff and stay.

I would not live to stretch my shrivelled hands
To an old fire died low,
Minding me of the long-lost happy lands
And children long ago.

Let me be gone while I am leafy yet
And while my birds still sing,
Lest leafless, birdless, my dull heart forget
That ever it had Spring. 

The new year has dawned in
With a new ray of hope, 
With newer resolutions 
And more hurdles to cope.

Only the year has changed
But the nature remains the same, 
Comes day after night
Hide n seek is still the game.

With the changing year
Our perceptions too need to change, 
We need to instill fear 
In those whose deeds are strange.

Lets not Divide and Rule
A peaceful harmonious song lets together hum, 
Let's lead and live a serene life
In this year and many more years to come.'


I take this opportunity in Wishing all my PH readers a Very Happy Healthy and Prosperous New Year ahead. Have a fantabulous year! ! 

I am, I am
So close a man
Why you keep me far
Why you close your door
I have been ever and ever
Your, what you may think, dear! 

Touch me
Without any key
I will instantly open
How you want me, when
Likings and dislikings all are
Quite have been but just your, 

Look at me
I am  ready
Please, take me in
You know I am alone
In this wide wide universe
An unseen dot is my existence, 

I am so small
My brain is so dull
Can not understand you
Gracefully form me just now
Breaking my all that in and out
Keeping no a single point in doubt.

And at cross roads bewildered I stand
I tell myself
This shall pass

When my mind is full of fear
And I find no single soul to share
I tell myself
This too shall pass

When darkness invades my abode
And there is not even a ray of light inside
I tell myself
This too shall pass

When my burdens weigh heavier than I can bear
And when no one around seems to care
I tell myself
This too shall pass

When storm clouds gather in the sky
And my tensions rise high
I tell myself
This too shall pass

When the road ahead stretches strenuous
And the distance makes me nervous
I tell myself
This too shall pass

When those I love and trust let me down
And look upon me with scorn and frown	
I tell myself
This too shall pass 

When misfortunes flow in torrent
And am caught in the eddying current
I tell myself
This too shall pass

When the cycle of seasons keep changing
Life, from sorrows to joy will surely be shifting
Let us wait for the pendulum to have its full swing
And let our hopes heavenward steadily wing! 

Love will again fill the air
Doves of peace will coo in pair
The wintry chill will lose its frosty bite
Spring will come on wings like a sprite


‘‘Nevertheless, the hilltop hour
Would not be half so wonderful
Were there no dark valleys to traverse"
Helen Keller's words resonate in my ears


From the top of the mountains
We breathed the pure air
Enjoying the stunning, awe-inspiring views, 
That stretched around there.
Coming down to the green valley
We got involved in the breeze around, 
And walked by the little brook
Singing together melodious sounds.
The sweet scent of flowers and bushes
Accompanied us all the way long
Allowing for a quiet reflection, 
In stillness and love, 
Away from the throng.

(May O to make the most jubilant song!
Full of music-full of manhood, womanhood, infancy!
Full of common employments-full of grain and trees.

O for the voices of animals-O for the swiftness and balance of fishes!
O for the dropping of raindrops in a song!
O for the sunshine and motion of waves in a song!

O the joy of my spirit-it is uncaged-it darts like lightning!
It is not enough to have this globe or a certain time,
I will have thousands of globes and all time.

O the engineer's joys! to go with a locomotive!
To hear the hiss of steam, the merry shriek, the steam-whistle, the
laughing locomotive!
To push with resistless way and speed off in the distance.

O the gleesome saunter over fields and hillsides!
The leaves and flowers of the commonest weeds, the moist fresh
stillness of the woods,
The exquisite smell of the earth at daybreak, and all through the
forenoon.

O the horseman's and horsewoman's joys!
The saddle, the gallop, the pressure upon the seat, the cool
gurgling by the ears and hair.

O the fireman's joys!
I hear the alarm at dead of night,
I hear bells, shouts! I pass the crowd, I run!
The sight of the flames maddens me with pleasure.

O the joy of the strong-brawn'd fighter, towering in the arena in
perfect condition, conscious of power, thirsting to meet his
opponent.

O the joy of that vast elemental sympathy which only the human
soul is capable of generating and emitting in steady and
limitless floods.

O the mother's joys!
The watching, the endurance, the precious love, the anguish, the
patiently yielded life.

O the of increase, growth, recuperation,
The joy of soothing and pacifying, the joy of concord and harmony.

O to go back to the place where I was born,
To hear the birds sing once more,
To ramble about the house and barn and over the fields once more,
And through the orchard and along the old lanes once more.

O to have been brought up on bays, lagoons, creeks, or along the coast,
To continue and be employ'd there all my life,
The briny and damp smell, the shore, the salt weeds exposed at low water,
The work of fishermen, the work of the eel-fisher and clam-fisher;
I come with my clam-rake and spade, I come with my eel-spear,
Is the tide out? I Join the group of clam-diggers on the flats,
I laugh and work with them, I joke at my work like a mettlesome
young man;

In winter I take my eel-basket and eel-spear and travel out on foot
on the ice-I have a small axe to cut holes in the ice,
Behold me well-clothed going gayly or returning in the afternoon,
my brood of tough boys accompanying me,
My brood of grown and part-grown boys, who love to be with no
one else so well as they love to be with me,
By day to work with me, and by night to sleep with me.

Another time in warm weather out in a boat, to lift the lobster-pots
where they are sunk with heavy stones, (I know the buoys,)
O the sweetness of the Fifth-month morning upon the water as I row
just before sunrise toward the buoys,
I pull the wicker pots up slantingly, the dark green lobsters are
desperate with their claws as I take them out, I insert
wooden pegs in the ‘oints of their pincers,

I go to all the places one after another, and then row back to the
shore,
There in a huge kettle of boiling water the lobsters shall be boil'd
till their color becomes scarlet.

Another time mackerel-taking,
Voracious, mad for the hook, near the surface, they seem to fill the
water for miles;
Another time fishing for rock-fish in Chesapeake bay, I one of the
brown-faced crew;
Another time trailing for blue-fish off Paumanok, I stand with
braced body,
My left foot is on the gunwale, my right arm throws far out the
coils of slender rope,
In sight around me the quick veering and darting of fifty skiffs, my
companions.

O boating on the rivers,
The voyage down the St. Lawrence, the superb scenery, the steamers,
The ships sailing, the Thousand Islands, the occasional timber-raft
and the raftsmen with long-reaching sweep-oars,
The little huts on the rafts, and the stream of smoke when they cook
supper at evening.

(O something pernicious and dread!
Something far away from a puny and pious life!
Something unproved! something in a trance!
Something escaped from the anchorage and driving free.)

O to work in mines, or forging iron,
Foundry casting, the foundry itself, the rude high roof, the ample
and shadow'd space,
The furnace, the hot liquid pour'd out and running.

O to resume the joys of the soldier!
To feel the presence of a brave commanding officer-to feel his
sympathy!
To behold his calmness-to be warm'd in the rays of his smile!
To go to battle-to hear the bugles play and the drums beat!
To hear the crash of artillery-to see the glittering of the bayonets
and musket-barrels in the sun!

To see men fall and die and not complain!
To taste the savage taste of blood-to be so devilish!
To gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy.

O the whaleman's joys! O I cruise my old cruise again!
I feel the ship's motion under me, I feel the Atlantic breezes
fanning me,
I hear the cry again sent down from the mast-head, There- she
blows!
Again I spring up the rigging to look with the rest- we descend,
wild with excitement,
I leap in the lower'd boat, we row toward our prey where he lies,
We approach stealthy and silent, I see the mountainous mass,
lethargic, basking,
I see the harpooneer standing up, I see the weapon dart from his
vigorous arm;
O swift again far out in the ocean the wounded whale, settling,
running to windward, tows me,
Again I see him rise to breathe, we row close again,
I see a lance driven through his side, press'd deep, turn'd in the
wound,
Again we back off, I see him settle again, the life is leaving him
fast,
As he rises he spouts blood, I see him swim in circles narrower and
narrower, swiftly cutting the water-I see him die,
He gives one convulsive leap in the centre of the circle, and then
falls flat and still in the bloody foam.

O the old manhood of me, my noblest joy of all!
My children and grand-children, my white hair and beard,
My largeness, calmness, majesty, out of the long stretch of my life.

O ripen'd joy of womanhood! O happiness at last!

I am more than eighty years of age, I am the most venerable mother,
How clear is my mind-how all people draw nigh to me!
What attractions are these beyond any before? what bloom more
than the bloom of youth?
What beauty is this that descends upon me and rises out of me?

O the orator's joys!
To inflate the chest, to roll the thunder of the voice out from the
ribs and throat,
To make the people rage, weep, hate, desire, with yourself,
To lead America-to quell America with a great tongue.

O the joy of my soul leaning pois'd on itself, receiving identity
through materials and loving them, observing characters
and absorbing them,
My soul vibrated back to me from them, from sight, hearing, touch,
reason, articulation, comparison, memory, and the like,
The real life of my senses and flesh transcending my senses and
flesh,
My body done with materials, my sight done with my material eyes,
Proved to me this day beyond cavil that it is not my material eyes
which finally see,
Nor my material body which finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts,
embraces, procreates.

O the farmer's joys!
Ohioan's, Illinoisian's, Wisconsinese', Kanadian's, Iowan's,
Kansian's, Missourian's, Oregonese' joys!
To rise at peep of day and pass forth nimbly to work,
To plough land in the fall for winter-sown crops,
To plough land in the spring for maize,
To train orchards, to graft the trees, to gather apples in the fall.

O to bathe in the swimming-bath, or in a good place along shore,
To splash the water! to walk ankle-deep, or race naked along the
shore.

O to realize space!
The plenteousness of all, that there are no bounds,
To emerge and be of the sky, of the sun and moon and flying
clouds, as one with them.

O the joy a manly self-hood!
To be servile to none, to defer to none, not to any tyrant known or
unknown,

To walk with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic,
To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye,
To speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a broad chest,
To confront with your personality all the other personalities of the
earth.

Know'st thou the excellent joys of youth?
Joys of the dear companions and of the merry word and laughing
face?
Joy of the glad light-beaming day, joy of the wide-breath'd games?
Joy of sweet music, joy of the lighted ball-room and the dancers?
Joy of the plenteous dinner, strong carouse and drinking?

Yet O my soul supreme!
Know'st thou the joys of pensive thought?
Joys of the free and lonesome heart, the tender, gloomy heart?
Joys of the solitary walk, the spirit bow'd yet proud, the suffering
and the struggle?
The agonistic throes, the ecstasies, joys of the solemn musings day
or night?
Joys of the thought of Death, the great spheres Time and Space?
Prophetic joys of better, loftier love's ideals, the divine wife,
the sweet, eternal, perfect comrade?
Joys all thine own undying one, joys worthy thee O soul.

O while I live to be the ruler of life, not a slave,
To meet life as a powerful conqueror,
No fumes, no ennui, no more complaints or scornful criticisms,
To these proud laws of the air, the water and the ground, proving
my interior soul impregnable,
And nothing exterior shall ever take command of me.

For not life's joys alone I sing, repeating-the joy of death!
The beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few moments,
for reasons,
Myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burn'd, or render'd
to powder, or buried,
My real body doubtless left to me for other spheres,
My voided body nothing more to me, returning to the purifications,
further offices, eternal uses of the earth.

O to attract by more than attraction!
How it is I know not-yet behold! the something which obeys none
of the rest,
It is offensive, never defensive-yet how magnetic it draws.

O to struggle against great odds, to meet enemies undaunted!
To be entirely alone with them, to find how much one can stand!
To look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, face to face!
To mount the scaffold, to advance to the muzzles of guns with
perfect nonchalance!

O to sail to sea in a ship!
To leave this steady unendurable land,
To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets, the sidewalks and the
houses,
To leave you O you solid motionless land, and entering a ship,
To sail and sail and sail!

O to have life henceforth a poem of new joys!
To dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, float on!
To be a sailor of the world bound for all ports,
A ship itself, (see indeed these sails I spread to the sun and air,)
A swift and swelling ship full of rich words, full of joys. 

Hey, rose, just born
Twin to a thorn;
Was't so with you, O Love and Scorn?

Sweet eyes that smiled,
Now wet and wild:
O Eye and Tear- mother and child.

Well: Love and Pain
Be kinfolks twain;
Yet would, Oh would I could Love again. 

Come, take our boy, and we will go
Before our cabin door;
The winds shall bring us, as they blow,
The murmurs of the shore;
And we will kiss his young blue eyes, 
And I will sing him, as he lies,
Songs that were made of yore:
I'll sing, in his delighted ear,
The island lays thou lov'st to hear.

And thou, while stammering I repeat,
Thy country's tongue shalt teach;
'Tis not so soft, but far more sweet,
Than my own native speech:
For thou no other tongue didst know,
When, scarcely twenty moons ago, 
Upon Tahete's beach,
Thou cam'st to woo me to be thine,
With many a speaking look and sign.

I knew thy meaning--thou didst praise
My eyes, my locks of jet;
Ah! well for me they won thy gaze,--
But thine were fairer yet!

I'm glad to see my infant wear
Thy soft blue eyes and sunny hair,
And when my sight is met
By his white brow and blooming cheek,
I feel a joy I cannot speak.

Come talk of Europe's maids with me,
Whose necks and cheeks, they tell,
Outshine the beauty of the sea,
White foam and crimson shell.
I'll shape like theirs my simple dress,
And bind like them each jetty tress.
A sight to please thee well:
And for my dusky brow will braid
A bonnet like an English maid.

Come, for the soft low sunlight calls,
We lose the pleasant hours;
'Tis lovelier than these cottage walls,--
That seat among the flowers.
And I will learn of thee a prayer,
To Him, who gave a home so fair,
A lot so blessed as ours--
This sweet lone isle amid the sea. 

What will you give to a barefoot lass,
Morning with breath like wine?
Wade, bare feet! In my wide morass
Starry marigolds shine.
Alms, sweet Noon, for a barefoot lass,
With her laughing looks aglow!
Run, bare feet! In my fragrant grass
Golden buttercups blow.

Gift, a gift for a barefoot lass,
O twilight hour of dreams!
Rest, bare feet, by my lake of glass,
Where the mirrored sunset gleams.

Homeward the weary merchants pass,
With the gold bedimmed by care.
Little they wise that the barefoot lass
Is the only millionaire. 

As the dim twilight shrouds
The mountain's purple crest,
And Summer's white and folded clouds
Are glowing in the west,
Loud shouts come up the rocky dell,
And voices hail the evening-bell.

Faint is the goatherd's song,
And sighing comes the breeze;
The silent river sweeps along
Amid its bending trees -
And the full moon shines faintly there,
And music fills the evening air.

Beneath the waving firs
The tinkling cymbals sound;
And as the wind the foliage stirs,
I see the dancers bound
Where the green branches, arched above,
Bend over this fair scene of love.

And he is there, that sought
My young heart long ago!
But he has left me - though I thought
He ne'er could leave me so.
Ah! lover's vows - how frail are they!
And his - were made but yesterday.

Why comes he not? I call
In tears upon him yet;
'Twere better ne'er to love at all,
Than love, and then forget!
Why comes he not? Alas! I should
Reclaim him still, if weeping could.

But see - he leaves the glade,
And beckons me away:
He comes to seek his mountain maid!
I cannot chide his stay.
Glad sounds along the valley swell,
And voices hail the evening-bell. 

Sherwood in the twilight, is Robin Hood awake?
Grey and ghostly shadows are gliding through the brake,
Shadows of the dappled deer, dreaming of the morn,
Dreaming of a shadowy man that winds a shadowy horn.

Robin Hood is here again: all his merry thieves
Hear a ghostly bugle-note shivering through the leaves,
Calling as he used to call, faint and far away,
In Sherwood, in Sherwood, about the break of day.

Merry, merry England has kissed the lips of June:
All the wings of fairyland were here beneath the moon,
Like a flight of rose-leaves fluttering in a mist
Of opal and ruby and pearl and amethyst.

Merry, merry England is waking as of old,
With eyes of blither hazel and hair of brighter gold:
For Robin Hood is here again beneath the bursting spray
In Sherwood, in Sherwood, about the break of day.

Love is in the greenwood building him a house
Of wild rose and hawthorn and honeysuckle boughs:
Love is in the greenwood, dawn is in the skies,
And Marian is waiting with a glory in her eyes.

Hark! The dazzled laverock climbs the golden steep!
Marian is waiting: is Robin Hood asleep?
Round the fairy grass-rings frolic elf and fay,
In Sherwood, in Sherwood, about the break of day.

Oberon, Oberon, rake away the gold,
Rake away the red leaves, roll away the mould,
Rake away the gold leaves, roll away the red,
And wake Will Scarlett from his leafy forest bed.

Friar Tuck and Little John are riding down together
With quarter-staff and drinking-can and grey goose-feather.
The dead are coming back again, the years are rolled away
In Sherwood, in Sherwood, about the break of day.

Softly over Sherwood the south wind blows.
All the heart of England his in every rose
Hears across the greenwood the sunny whisper leap,
Sherwood in the red dawn, is Robin Hood asleep?

Hark, the voice of England wakes him as of old
And, shattering the silence with a cry of brighter gold
Bugles in the greenwood echo from the steep,
Sherwood in the red dawn, is Robin Hood asleep?

Where the deer are gliding down the shadowy glen
All across the glades of fern he calls his merry men--
Doublets of the Lincoln green glancing through the May
In Sherwood, in Sherwood, about the break of day--

Calls them and they answer: from aisles of oak and ash
Rings the Follow! Follow! and the boughs begin to crash,
The ferns begin to flutter and the flowers begin to fly,
And through the crimson dawning the robber band goes by.

Robin! Robin! Robin! All his merry thieves
Answer as the bugle-note shivers through the leaves,
Calling as he used to call, faint and far away,
In Sherwood, in Sherwood, about the break of day. 

Would some little joy to-day 
Visit us, heart! 
Could it but a moment stay, 
Then depart, 
With the flutter of its wings 
Stirring sense of brighter things. 

Like a butterfly astray 
In a dark room; 
Telling:--Outside there is day, 
Sweet flowers bloom, 
Birds are singing, trees are green 
Runnels ripple silver sheen. 

Heart! we now have been so long 
Sad without change, 
Shut in deep from shine and song 
Nor can range; 
It would do us good to know 
That the world is not all woe. 

Would some little joy to-day 
Visit us, heart! 
Could it but a moment stay, 
Then depart, 
With the luster of its wings 
Lighting dreams of happy things, 
O sad my heart

Brave Thackeray has trolled of days when he was twenty-one,
And bounded up five flights of stairs, a gallant garreteer;
And yet again in mellow vein when youth was gaily run,
Has dipped his nose in Gascon wine, and told of Forty Year.
But if I worthy were to sing a richer, rarer time,
I'd tune my pipes before the fire and merrily I'd strive
To praise that age when prose again has given way to rhyme,
The Indian Summer days of life when I'll be Sixty-five;

For then my work will all be done, my voyaging be past,
And I'll have earned the right to rest where folding hills are green;
So in some glassy anchorage I'll make my cable fast, --
Oh, let the seas show all their teeth, I'll sit and smile serene.
The storm may bellow round the roof, I'll bide beside the fire,
And many a scene of sail and trail within the flame I'll see;
For I'll have worn away the spur of passion and desire. . . .
Oh yes, when I am Sixty-five, what peace will come to me.

I'll take my breakfast in my bed, I'll rise at half-past ten,
When all the world is nicely groomed and full of golden song;
I'll smoke a bit and joke a bit, and read the news, and then
I'll potter round my peach-trees till I hear the luncheon gong.
And after that I think I'll doze an hour, well, maybe two,
And then I'll show some kindred soul how well my roses thrive;
I'll do the things I never yet have found the time to do. . . .
Oh, won't I be the busy man when I am Sixty-five.

I'll revel in my library; I'll read De Morgan's books;
I'll grow so garrulous I fear you'll write me down a bore;
I'll watch the ways of ants and bees in quiet sunny nooks,
I'll understand Creation as I never did before.
When gossips round the tea-cups talk I'll listen to it all;
On smiling days some kindly friend will take me for a drive:
I'll own a shaggy collie dog that dashes to my call:
I'll celebrate my second youth when I am Sixty-five.

Ah, though I've twenty years to go, I see myself quite plain,
A wrinkling, twinkling, rosy-cheeked, benevolent old chap;
I think I'll wear a tartan shawl and lean upon a cane.
I hope that I'll have silver hair beneath a velvet cap.
I see my little grandchildren a-romping round my knee;
So gay the scene, I almost wish 'twould hasten to arrive.
Let others sing of Youth and Spring, still will it seem to me
The golden time's the olden time, some time round Sixty-five. 

I write and remove thy name, 
In this way I punish my heart, 
Thy love was nothing but a game, 
And I was defeated by thy ways smart. 

I am still alive leading a life of curse, 
My vivacity departs, my light is fading, 
No one is here to find me a nurse, 
And yet my peace thy memory is invading, 

O soul, o life, be ready for something worst, 
Something thy would never have seen, 
My death will soon quench thy thirst, 
Thou may get what I mean. 

She heard the sound of pigeons overhead
Looking up she saw them whirling and gyrating
Forming newly emerging patterns in the sky
They soared on and on
Until they became fading black dots in the blue

Such sights would have sent her to raptures
Sometime back.   
But now when she sees them
She can only think of the years speeding by
And the chances missed 
And her whole life- a fading black dot! 

She is infected with a virus of melancholy
Pain consumes her without flame
She walks with lacerations in her soul
Forever she wages a battle inside
To drive out the demons of dejection
But she feels as if a sharp knife 
Is cutting right through her heart
And she winces at every chop
Though she tries hard to cover her bruises
They bleed red and make themselves known

Pain has sucked her out
In a leaking vessel, she collects her tears
To water the parched terrain
Of her drought stricken domain
Light has sorely betrayed her 
And now she lives in perpetual darkness
Fighting with black shadows
Day in and day out

The Spring comes slowly up this way,
Slowly, slowly,
Under a snood of hodden grey.

The black and white for her array,
Slowly, slowly,
The Spring comes slowly up this way.

Where is her green that was so gay?
Slowly, slowly,
The Spring comes slowly up this way.

Unto a world too sick for May,
Slowly, slowly,
The Spring comes slowly up this way.

Where are the lads that used to play?
Slowly, slowly,
The Spring comes slowly up this way.

She has no heart for holiday,
Slowly, slowly,
The Spring comes slowly up this way.

The trees are out in Heaven they say.
Slowly, slowly,
The Spring comes slowly up our way. 

Ho! we were strong, we were swift, we were brave.
Youth was a challenge, and Life was a fight.
All that was best in us gladly we gave,
Sprang from the rally, and leapt for the height.
Smiling is Love in a foam of Spring flowers:
Harden our hearts to him -- on let us press!
Oh, what a triumph and pride shall be ours!
See where it beacons, the star of success!

Cares seem to crowd on us -- so much to do;
New fields to conquer, and time's on the wing.
Grey hairs are showing, a wrinkle or two;
Somehow our footstep is losing its spring.
Pleasure's forsaken us, Love ceased to smile;
Youth has been funeralled; Age travels fast.
Sometimes we wonder: is it worth while?
There! we have gained to the summit at last.

Aye, we have triumphed! Now must we haste,
Revel in victory . . . why! what is wrong?
Life's choicest vintage is flat to the taste --
Are we too late? Have we laboured too long?
Wealth, power, fame we hold . . . ah! but the truth:
Would we not give this vain glory of ours
For one mad, glad year of glorious youth,
Life in the Springtide, and Love in the flowers. 

Deeming that I were better dead,
"How shall I kill myself?" I said.
Thus mooning by the river Seine
I sought extinction without pain,
When on a bridge I saw a flash
Of lingerie and heard a splash . . .
So as I am a swimmer stout
I plunged and pulled the poor wretch out. 

The female that I saved? Ah yes,
To yield the Morgue of one corpse the less,
Apart from all heroic action,
Gave me a moral satisfaction.
was she an old and withered hag,
Too tired of life to long to lag?
Ah no, she was so young and fair
I fell in love with her right there. 

And when she took me to her attic
Her gratitude was most emphatic.
A sweet and simple girl she proved,
Distraught because the man she loved
In battle his life-blood had shed . . .
So I, too, told her of my dead,
The girl who in a garret grey
Had coughed and coughed her life away. 

Thus as we sought our griefs to smother,
With kisses we consoled each other . . .
And there's the ending of my story;
It wasn't grim, it wasn't gory.
For comforted were hearts forlorn,
And from black sorrow joy was born:
So may our dead dears be forgiving,
And bless the rapture of the living. 

I
Rest me with Chinese colours,
For I think the glass is evil.

II
The wind moves above the wheat-
With a silver crashing,
A thin war of metal.

I have known the golden disc,
I have seen it melting above me.
I have known the stone-bright place,
The hall of clear colours.

III
O glass subtly evil, O confusion of colours !
O light bound and bent in, soul of the captive,
Why am I warned? Why am I sent away?
Why is your glitter full of curious mistrust?
O glass subtle and cunning, O powdery gold!
O filaments of amber, two-faced iridescence

Sail fast, sail fast,
    Ark of my hopes, Ark of my dreams;
    Sweep lordly o'er the drowned Past,
    Fly glittering through the sun's strange beams;
        Sail fast, sail fast.
Breaths of new buds from off some drying lea
With news about the Future scent the sea:
My brain is beating like the heart of Haste:
I'll loose me a bird upon this Present waste;
        Go, trembling song,
    And stay not long; oh, stay not long:
    Thou'rt only a gray and sober dove,
    But thine eye is faith and thy wing is love. 

The princess has her lovers, 
A score of knights has she, 
And each can sing a madrigal, 
And praise her gracefully.

But Love that is so bitter 
Hath put within her heart 
A longing for the scornful knight 
Who silent stands apart.

And tho' the others praise and plead, 
She maketh no reply, 
Yet for a single word from him, 
I ween that she would die. 

O I will walk with you, my lad, whichever way you fare, 
You'll have me, too, the side o' you, with heart as light as air; 
No care for where the road you take's a-leadin' anywhere,-- 
It can but be a joyful ja'nt whilst you journey there. 
The road you take's the path o' love, an' that's the bridth o' two-- 
An' I will walk with you, my lad -- O I will walk with you.

Ho! I will walk with you, my lad, 
Be weather black or blue 
Or roadsides frost or dew, my lad -- 
O I will walk with you.

Aye, glad, my lad, I'll walk with you, whatever winds may blow, 
Or summer blossoms stay our steps, or blinding drifts of snow; 
The way thay you set face an' foot 's the way that I will go, 
An' brave I'll be, abreast o' ye, the Saints and Angels know! 
With loyal hand in loyal hand, an' one heart made o' two, 
Through summer's gold, or winter's cold, It's I will walk with you.

Sure, I will walk with you, my lad, 
A love ordains me to,-- 
To Heaven's door, an' through, my lad. 
O I will walk with you. 

No, Bill, I'm not a-spooning out no patriotic tosh
    (The cove be'ind the sandbags ain't a death-or-glory cuss).
And though I strafes 'em good and 'ard I doesn't 'ate the Boche,
    I guess they're mostly decent, just the same as most of us.
I guess they loves their 'omes and kids as much as you or me;
    And just the same as you or me they'd rather shake than fight;
And if we'd 'appened to be born at Berlin-on-the-Spree,
    We'd be out there with 'Ans and Fritz, dead sure that we was right.

A-standin' up to the sandbags
    It's funny the thoughts wot come;
Starin' into the darkness,
    'Earin' the bullets 'um;
(Zing! Zip! Ping! Rip!
    'ark 'ow the bullets 'um!)
A-leanin' against the sandbags
    Wiv me rifle under me ear,
Oh, I've 'ad more thoughts on a sentry-go
    Than I used to 'ave in a year.

I wonder, Bill, if 'Ans and Fritz is wonderin' like me
    Wot's at the bottom of it all? Wot all the slaughter's for?
'E thinks 'e's right (of course 'e ain't) but this we both agree,
    If them as made it 'ad to fight, there wouldn't be no war.
If them as lies in feather beds while we kips in the mud;
    If them as makes their fortoons while we fights for 'em like 'ell;
If them as slings their pot of ink just 'ad to sling their blood:
    By Crust! I'm thinkin' there 'ud be another tale to tell.

Shiverin' up to the sandbags,
    With a hicicle 'stead of a spine,
Don't it seem funny the things you think
    'Ere in the firin' line:
(Whee! Whut! Ziz! Zut!
Hunkerin' down when a star-shell
    Cracks in a sputter of light,
You can jaw to yer soul by the sandbags
    Most any old time o' night.

They talks o' England's glory and a-'oldin' of our trade,
    Of Empire and 'igh destiny until we're fair flim-flammed;
But if it's for the likes o' that that bloody war is made,
    Then wot I say is: Empire and 'igh destiny be damned!
There's only one good cause, Bill, for poor blokes like us to fight:
    That's self-defence, for 'earth and 'ome, and them that bears our name;
And that's wot I'm a-doin' by the sandbags 'ere to-night. . . .
    But Fritz out there will tell you 'e's a-doin' of the same.

Starin' over the sandbags,
    Sick of the 'ole damn thing;
Firin' to keep meself awake,
    'Earin' the bullets sing.
(Hiss! Twang! Tsing! Pang!
    Saucy the bullets sing.)
Dreamin' 'ere by the sandbags
    Of a day when war will cease,
When 'Ans and Fritz and Bill and me
    Will clink our mugs in fraternity,
And the Brotherhood of Labour will be
    The Brotherhood of Peace. 

Here within the half-light 'tween the night and day
Upon the sands I lie, with thoughts that idly stirr'd
Seem, as in a dream, with life and death to play,
As o'er the sea there flits a pale white bird.
In my heart I hear it, the murmur of the sea,
Ah! and memories of other lives are stirr'd,
As somewise there came a mystic voice to me
As o'er the sea there flits a pale white bird.
Who but knows that in me is a ghost that hears
A voice it heard of old in the primeval word —
A memory so dim, it like a dream appears
As o'er the sea there flits a pale white bird

A song of the setting sun!
The sky in the west is red,
And the day is all but done;
While yonder up overhead,
All too soon,
There rises so cold the cynic moon.

A Song of a Winter day!
The wind of the north doth blow,
From a sky that's chill and gray,
On fields where no crops now grow,
Fields long shorn
Of bearded barley and golden corn.

A song of a faded flower!
'Twas plucked in the tender bud,
And fair and fresh for an hour,
In a Lady's hair it stood,
Now, ah! now,
Faded it lies in the dust and low. 

The soul is as a little bird
That perches briefly
Upon the branches of life.

It chirps and sings, 
And flutters its wings—
And is, oh, so happy.

Then suddenly, 
It flies away.Now, this is the cup the White Men drink
When they go to right a wrong,
And that is the cup of the old world's hate- 
Cruel and strained and strong.
We have drunk that cup- and a bitter, bitter cup- 
And tossed the dregs away.
But well for the world when the White Men drink
To the dawn of the White Man's day!


Now, this is the road that the White Men tread
When they go to clean a land- 
Iron underfoot and levin overhead
And the deep on either hand.
We have trod that road- and a wet and windy road- 
Our chosen star for guide.
Oh, well for the world when the White Men tread
Their highway side by side!


Now, this is the faith that the White Men hold- 
When they build their homes afar- 
'Freedom for ourselves and freedom for our sons
And, failing freedom, War.'
We have proved our faith- bear witness to our faith,
Dear souls of freemen slain!
Oh, well for the world when the White Men join
To prove their faith again

I rose at six O'clock
To wait and see a Test Match, but rain began to fall.
	  I tried to hasten back; 
	  Out for a ‘duck', alack! 
I waited for a bally bus that never came at all.


        I waited in a queue
        From nine O'clock to two, 
To pay my college fees before the penal end of term; 
	But when it was my turn, 
     	I was obliged to learn
That waiting is no pastime for the bloke who isn't firm. 
 
	Thus life will slip away
        In waiting every day, 
And waiting has no ecstasies for me at any rate.
	Still, some may be consoled
	On being gently told, 

"It isn't the foe that we fear;
    It isn't the bullets that whine;
It isn't the business career
    Of a shell, or the bust of a mine;
It isn't the snipers who seek
    To nip our young hopes in the bud:
No, it isn't the guns,
And it isn't the Huns --
    It's the MUD,
                    MUD,
                              MUD.

It isn't the melee we mind.
That often is rather good fun.
    It isn't the shrapnel we find
Obtrusive when rained by the ton;
    It isn't the bounce of the bombs
That gives us a positive pain:
    It's the strafing we get
When the weather is wet --
    It's the RAIN,
                      RAIN,
                            RAIN.

It isn't because we lack grit
    We shrink from the horrors of war.
We don't mind the battle a bit;
    In fact that is what we are for;
It isn't the rum-jars and things
    Make us wish we were back in the fold:
It's the fingers that freeze
In the boreal breeze --
    It's the COLD,
                    COLD,
                            COLD.

Oh, the rain, the mud, and the cold,
    The cold, the mud, and the rain;
With weather at zero it's hard for a hero
    From language that's rude to refrain.
With porridgy muck to the knees,
    With sky that's a-pouring a flood,
Sure the worst of our foes
Are the pains and the woes
    Of the RAIN,
                THE COLD,
                        AND THE MUD. 

On the day the world ends
A bee circles a clover,
A fisherman mends a glimmering net.
Happy porpoises jump in the sea,
By the rainspout young sparrows are playing
And the snake is gold-skinned as it should always be.

On the day the world ends
Women walk through the fields under their umbrellas,
A drunkard grows sleepy at the edge of a lawn,
Vegetable peddlers shout in the street
And a yellow-sailed boat comes nearer the island,
The voice of a violin lasts in the air
And leads into a starry night.

And those who expected lightning and thunder
Are disappointed.
And those who expected signs and archangels' trumps
Do not believe it is happening now.
As long as the sun and the moon are above,
As long as the bumblebee visits a rose,
As long as rosy infants are born
No one believes it is happening now.

Only a white-haired old man, who would be a prophet
Yet is not a prophet, for he's much too busy,
Repeats while he binds his tomatoes:
No other end of the world will there be,
No other end of the world will there be. 

On the green margin of the brook, 
Despairing Phyllida reclined,
Whilst every sigh, and every look,
Declared the anguish of her mind.

Am I less lovely then? (she cries,
And in the waves her form surveyed);
Oh yes, I see my languid eyes,
My faded cheek, my colour fled:
These eyes no more like lightning pierced,
These cheeks grew pale, when Damon first
His Phyllida betrayed.

The rose he in his bosom wore,
How oft upon my breast was seen!
And when I kissed the drooping flower,
Behold, he cried, it blooms again!
The wreaths that bound my braided hair,
Himself next day was proud to wear
At church, or on the green.

While thus sad Phyllida lamented,
Chance brought unlucky Thyrsis on;
Unwillingly the nymph consented,
But Damon first the cheat begun.
She wiped the fallen tears away,
Then sighed and blushed, as who would say
Ah! Thyrsis, I am won. 

The sparkling eye, the mantling cheek,
The polished front, the snowy neck,
How seldom we behold in one!
Glossy locks, and brow serene,
Venus' smiles, Diana's mien,
All meet in you, and you alone.

Beauty, like other powers, maintains
Her empire, and by union reigns;
Each single feature faintly warms:
But where at once we view displayed
Unblemished grace, the perfect maid
Our eyes, our ears, our heart alarms.

So when on earth the god of day
Obliquely sheds his tempered ray,
Through convex orbs the beams transmit,
The beams that gently warmed before,
Collected, gently warm no more,
But glow with more prevailing heat.(Chorus to start)  

Take Me back on the Wings of Glory 
Carry me far across the sea; 
Lay me down in the land I love so 
Where my spirit is forever free 

VO my love, my sweetest darling 
I guess you know what I must tell; 
In the raging heat of battle 
There, my dear, is where I fell. 

VWeep not ye for me in sorrow 
Heaven's peace is home above 
The heart's pain it is eternal 
Tears are just the pearls of love 

Chorus 

vPride and honour shall now guide you 
Tell our kids their Dad was brave 
The ways of war stole them from me 
My love lives beyond the grave 

chorus.. 

instrumental 

vBy sea and land, my lass, my darling 
I'll wait for you till the end of days 
No desert sands, nor guns of fury 
Could ever halt the green berets! ! ! ! 

Oh would I were the roses, that lie against her hands,
The heavy burning roses she touches as she stands!
Dear hands that hold the roses, where mine would love to be,
Oh leave, oh leave the roses, and hold the hands of me!
She draws the heart from out them, she draws away their breath,—
Oh would that I might perish and find so sweet a death

a song
to whom does it belong
once it is born, , , and stays alive for so long

the poet has done his bit
he has put his heart and soul
to give the song a soul

the musician has done his bit
he has put his work and mind
to give the song a form

the singer has done his bit
he has put his voice to emote
to give the song a life

whose song is it now.  

to whom does it belong

the song has become a bird
it goes around the world
it is by itself.. 

a persona

it goes on to live for long

[the indian film songs.. 

at least a few go on to live for long
i tried to say how itis made and how it stays]Why do we resort to all these harsh words? 
Brothers, are we not called to be salt?  Light? 
To love the unlovable, dead in blight? 
Why is truly loving the lost absurd? 
Is this why our message now goes unheard? 
Don’t we see we aren’t doing this quite right? 
When the message we spread is out of spite-
The pathology of Earth goes uncured

Someday I think we all will be ashamed
When we find the believer’s real disease
Wasn’t recanting their faith in His name
Rather that they shunned the sickest of these
Concerned about being seen with the lame
To give them the Key that would set them free



we’ll miss that trusting paw, those gentle ways, 
as snuggling close to us content he sat. 
Where now that little eager furry face, 
those twitching whiskers, beady eyes? Such grace! 
Poor Jack, you should have lived as long again 
had you but had your rightful span of days. 
You’ve left us now for where there is no pain, 
which should console, but yet I must complain 
to lose so soon this loving pet and friend. 
The world may scoff and show its harsh disdain, 
forget that we all share the self same end. 
So Jack, we’ll say a very fond goodbye, 
rememb’ring that at last we all must die. 

I've only one mouth in my face.
Don't you have many in your body? 
One at the top and the other at bottom
And the rest of all are in your belly.
When my mouth kisses your mouths
You starts to sound
And if my fingers are in good rhythm
You start to sing too.
Because you are my long fife, 
And I'm the fifer, rife in strife with my wife
O, she is not now in my fief.
Tonight our notes can connect together
In a fine tone to intone a tune.
A sonnet of fervour for my wife. 

When the grind of life is wearing me down
And my heart is breaking to see your face
It helps to know that where my heart is found
You will always be found in that same place

Each day passes with hope for that great day
When no 'good byes' will ever leave our lips
And together we will enter this fray
And from this fountain of life we will sip

Yet, until that day, I sit and I wait
Longing to have your tiny hand in mine
Sometimes I think of life's humor of fate
How your far away.   Always on my mind

I miss you so much when you're not here
Yet, when you're gone my heart grows so fond
How much fonder it is when you are near
And, so I wait for that sacred bond

How special will this be if we hold on
When you'll always be near.  And never gone



Stupidity and savagery, 
A move against humanity
And all that is reality.

All that's left is gravity, 
Maybe some profanity, 
All my life a cavity, 
A trip down the imaginary, 

All of this perplexity
Brought on by society, 
Nought to do but quietly
Reclude into sobriety.

And maybe someday there will be
A clearer path for me to see. 

A mirage of you beckons me and I thirst
to drink deep from your cup and to share
the pool of paradise with you my love and feel
cool waters caress our burning desire and wash
over us in ecstasy as the vision of love becomes
so clear, flooding this land so barren without you
As the river of love sweeps me away, I am flowing
Into the ocean of your love upon a tide of high

Drift with me onto distant golden shores
Into warmth of the softest sand under our toes
Lay with me in shade of palms in the island sun
Until it sets and we become one and into slumber
we will fall under the smiling moon that has shared
Our nights of longing for this perfect starlit dream


A Sonnet-Plea to the New Year (An Experimental Sonnet)     

Welcome, New Year 'Nineteen Ninety Four'.
At midnight, closed although may be our door, 
Have you not your magic master-key, 
From world's womb to timely set you free? 

A babe yourself, our father you will be; 
Our matters for a year you'll oversee.
Our life's boat, as Captain you will guide; 
Empowered you'll be to turn the very tide! 

Our future when you draft and duly write, 
Can't you make it just a shade more bright? 
As Fortune's favourites let us be enrolled; 
Her gracious gifts, awhile let us hold.

With Health as bread and Wealth as water pure, 
A happy life for us, pray ensure. 

Time, on your fins aeonian over space
holding, loosing, taking back events passed
through your units-each marching on a face
of twelve.
	 Souls who do bond to you are classed
as your gems.
	         Souls, so you do admit seen
in the ken of memory, for their best
to meet up with touchstones ever has been
there.
           In light, rock-souls who survived your test, 
have stepped on failures (the herculean stairs
of lessons)  to fortunes portioned with flowers
gilded in the sun who out his beam bares.
Energy limitlessly in you towers
for your units in labelling age due
on all in the cosmos as 'old and new'. 

Pen to me a lovely write.
Oh, tell me of your favor! 
Whisper words onto a page
Of how my lips you'd savor. 

Tickle Fate and chance my glance; 
I do hope I will see-
Phrases bled to make me weak: 
A sonnet writ for me. 

Once upon a Sunday
In the daffodil-days of spring
I heard a Blackbird crying, 
'Twas a sorry sorry thing.

'Oh dear' said I, advancing 
And finding half-built nest, 
And then all of a sudden
The bird flew off - to west.

His little home bedraggled
By thoughtless little boys; 
The Blackbird? far away now, 
No more the crying noise.

How was it that the children
Wanted not to hear it sing? 
But in it's absence, desecrate. 
It's a sorry sorry thing. 

Let the snake wait under
his weed
and the writing
be of words, slow and quick, sharp
to strike, quiet to wait,
sleepless.
-- through metaphor to reconcile
the people and the stones.
Compose. (No ideas
but in things) Invent!
Saxifrage is my flower that splits
the rocks. 

As my dad came towards the cradle
to see me
ignoring my mom in total
she could see life and love in his eye
anger and alcohol has shown up
'red' in those all these days.  

for her to see

seeing me.. 

touching my tender hands
feeling my face and hair
this rough man missed 'softness'
for the first time in his life
he stood there happy and confused
this intoxication was new to him

he could not stop coming to see me
he did come every day
he did start talking to my mom
it was about me.. 

only about me
he learned to carry me from my mom
a thrilled dad he became

on the day of discharge
as he carried me through the corridor. 
all people who knew him stood exclaimed


A lonely mom
where has dad gone
as this thought ran through me
a tear dropp woke me
a fascinated loving mom's eye
she found her 'him' in me

the old neighbor lady.. 

who
serves him food as a duty said
'your son looks lovely.. 

so much like you
your eyes nose and hair too
why don't you go see him'
'let's see' was all the reply from that rough man

a broken home that was
for the last six months
sharing the same roof those two.. 

dad and mom
not a word shared between the two
one to the other they just provided
yet.  

yet.. 

they never shared

'your eyes nose and hair too'
what the old lady said about me
did bring him to me. . 

a smile on the face
is actually the souls
a souls expression


A tiny speck in the vast cosmic framework 
Is the only known habitation to all creation
Graciously bequeathed to generation after generation

Poets sang paeans celebrating her charm
All creatures thrived knowing no harm
The songsters sang melodies from every tree
The beasts freely roamed the forests in glee

Earth that once shone in all her pristine glory 
Has now become a dreary, desert territory
All her wealth is looted by man's endless greed
To stop this ravage, she does silently plead

We prey on her as on a corpse by a ravenous vulture
Hoarding wealth by all means has become our culture 
We rape, we pillage and ooze out her blood
Suck her life sap to the point of casting her dead

Earth is now turned into a vast garbage can
Rising pollution dimming her original glean
To man and beast, it turns into a living hell
In all attentive ears falls her resounding knell

All creatures, move slowly to their doom
With rising carbon, soot and yellow fume
Many species face imminent extinction
And life moves fast to a critical junction

Know, only through Earth's hearty grace
Survival n' sustenance is possible for human race
‘Save Mother Earth'! ‘Don't leave her a grave yard'! 
This is the soulful plea from a grieving bard. 

Thanks is a word that is small to say
But carries a whole world of meanings in a way
For it describes all your loving acts
And your gift of care and that's a fact

For the small act of kindness like this
Really comes down as a source of bliss
And tell us that now we must gather
All this in one place all together

Because as long as there are people who care
Who lend to others their sympathetic ear
To listen and then give perfect advice
Are surely called both nice and wise

For its just that in a little time
They teach us to sing life's harsh rhyme
And tell us that now we must pray

To help us out in this trouble's hour
And grant us the courage and the power
To underastand that this is the world of test
Where we must face all problems with zest. 

Let your life
Fainly dance
On the edge of joy
So, It can leave behind
A treasure of happy memories
Which can be
A source of
Contentment
Delight
And Love
Forever
And ever. 


Consider your loss
A source of gain
Consider life's toss
A source of fain
And then you will
Know how you can
Easily kill
The sorrow's plan
And can see
How on earth
You can be
Of any worth.

Hark to the Sourdough story, told at sixty below,
When the pipes are lit and we smoke and spit
Into the campfire glow.
Rugged are we and hoary, and statin' a general rule,
A genooine Sourdough story
Ain't no yarn for the Sunday School.

A Sourdough came to stake his claim in Heav'n one morning early.
Saint Peter cried: "Who waits outside them gates so bright and pearly?"
"I'm recent dead," the Sourdough said, "and crave to visit Hades,
Where haply pine some pals o' mine, includin' certain ladies

"
Said Peter: "Go, you old Sourdough, from life so crooly riven;
And if ye fail to find their trail, we'll have a snoop round Heaven


He waved, and lo! that old Sourdough dropped down to Hell's red spaces;
But though 'twas hot he couldn't spot them old familiar faces.
The bedrock burned, and so he turned, and climbed with footsteps fleeter,
The stairway straight to Heaven's gate, and there, of course, was Peter.
"I cannot see my mates," sez he, "among those damned forever.
I have a hunch some of the bunch in Heaven I'll discover

"
Said Peter: "True; and this I'll do (since Sourdoughs are my failing)
You see them guys in Paradise, lined up against the railing -
As bald as coots, in birthday suits, with beards below the middle . . .
Well, I'll allow you in right now, if you can solve a riddle:
Among that gang of stiffs who hang and dodder round the portals,
Is one whose name is know to Fame - it's Adam, first of mortals.
For quiet's sake he makes a break from Eve, which is his Madame. . . .
Well, there's the gate - To crash it straight, just spy the guy that's Adam


The old Sourdough went down the row of greybeards ruminatin'
With optics dim they peered at him, and pressed agin the gratin'.
In every face he sought some trace of our ancestral father;
But though he stared, he soon despaired the faintest clue to gather.
Then suddenly he whooped with glee: "Ha! Ha! an inspiration

"
And to and fro along the row he ran with animation.
To Peter, bold he cried: "Behold, all told there are eleven.
Suppose I fix on Number Six - say Boy! How's that for Heaven?"

"By gosh! you win," said Pete. "Step in. But tell me how you chose him.
They're like as pins; all might be twins. There's nothing to disclose him

"
The Sourdough said: "'Twas hard; my head was seething with commotion.
I felt a dunce; then all at once I had a gorgeous notion.
I stooped and peered beneath each beard that drooped like fleece of mutton.
My search was crowned. . . . That bird I found - ain't got no belly button

"A South Wind—has a pathos
Of individual Voice—
As One detect on Landings
An Emigrant's address.

A Hint of Ports and Peoples—
And much not understood—
The fairer—for the farness—
And for the foreignhood. 

Whenever I mention you, 
the doctor always asks
what do I see, 

now that you're gone,  
when I think of you.  
I say I see thighs, 

tanned and gleaming, 
kissed by the proper 
Bonwit skirt, rising

through the terminal 
toward me and above 
your thighs 

that smile, 
a Southern girl's, 
uncoiling. 

The tired old farm buildings
Were slumping into the ground
Like exhausted children, 
Fighting to stay upright, 
But too old, too tired
To try much longer.

Possibly, the only thing
Holding them vertically 
Was the amount of vines
Sprouting out the tops 
Of the tilting roofs.

Doors gaped wide, 
Hinges hanging away, 
Most of their screws missing, 
Holding bits and pieces
Of the stout planks 
Which used to make doors.

A heavy metal winch
Swung from the upper 
Door of the barn, 
Creaking and whining
With age.

Where once it had been
The lifter of heavy loads, 
It now hangs limply
On a frayed rope, 
Empty and useless.

The stalls stand bare as well, 
Rotting, sour hay on floors
Which used to be cleaned  daily.
Rusted milk cans tilt
Against walls that can barely
Hold them upright.

A saddle still hangs
By the vacant doorway.
Where it had once shone proudly
With bright polish and clean brass, 
And smelled of horse, 
It now drops bits of dried-out leather, 
Like a moulting bird, 
Onto the unused floor.

Cans of paint, bits of brass, 
Rusty wire, old hoes and rakes
Lay in a jumble on shelves
Falling off the walls.

The homeplace, the house, 
Shows the same state of neglect, 
Doors ajar, windows sagging, 
Tiles tilting and sliding off the roof.

The porch dips and sags, 
Dragging the ground
Like the old preacher's wife, 
Wearing her finest clothes, 
With her slip hanging down, 
Tattered and dirty, 
And very worn at the edges.

The house beside the road, 
Where people lived
And children played, 
Is empty now, 
And falling down.

The echos of happy feet
Are heard, 
Tapping to the sound
Of Poppy's fiddle, 
But the house beside the road
Is empty, and forlorn.

When a gentle voice 
Is heard in the house, 
It is only a singing breeze, 
Sifting itself through
The cracks in the roof
Of the house I used to call
Home.

January ritten In Madison Caweln's 'Lyrics and Idyls.'

Herein are blown from out the South
Songs blithe as those of Pan's pursed mouth--
As sweet in voice as, in perfume,
The night-breath of magnolia-bloom.

Such sumptuous languor lures the sense--
Such luxury of indolence--
The eyes blur as a nymph's might blur,
With water-lilies watching her.

You waken, thrilling at the trill
Of some wild bird that seems to spill
The silence full of winey drips
Of song that Fancy sips and sips.

Betimes, in brambled lanes wherethrough
The chipmunk stripes himself from view,
You pause to lop a creamy spray
Of elder-blossoms by the way.

Or where the morning dew is yet
Gray on the topmost rail, you set
A sudden palm and, vaulting, meet
Your vaulting shadow in the wheat.

On lordly swards, of suave incline,
Entessellate with shade and shine,
You shall misdoubt your lowly birth,
Clad on as one of princely worth:

The falcon on your wrist shall ride--
Your milk-white Arab side by side
With one of raven-black.--You fain
Would kiss the hand that holds the rein.

Nay, nay, Romancer! Poet! Seer!
Sing us back home--from there to here;
Grant your high grace and wit, but we
Most honor your simplicity.--

Herein are blown from out the South
Songs blithe as those of Pan's pursed mouth--
As sweet in voice as, in perfume,
The night-breath of magnolia-bloom. 

Outside, the night was gathering strength
How swift our lightning Sputnik, 
Out running the speed of sound and light 
Shot into space with a violent jerk

At a distance were luminous spheres
Suspended like glowing lanterns
Comets and meteors in hyper space
Seemed more like diffused patterns

An asteroid came whizzing towards us.
I closed my eyes in dreadful shock, 
Fearing a terrible head on collision.

I looked at my friend seated beside
Obviously not here, lost in thought! 
Looking down, I saw Mother Earth
A luminous ball, not bigger than a sapphire dot

Oh! How quickly we landed on Mars
It is so different from what I had learnt
Neither a barren belt of sterile terrain
Nor a rugged stretch of craters burnt

But a heavenly place so cool and serene
Full of scintillating scenes and ravishing sights
We, the emissaries from a far away land
Were warmly received by a team of alien sprites

The weight of the world suddenly lifted from us
We bounced up and down almost floating in the air
Found ourselves in a gorgeous garden
With springing fountains and blossoms fair

Trees were laden with dazzling gems
Lagoons and lakes of liquid silver
Vast expanse of tawny vistas
Plains waving with luxuriant verdure

What fun-! Hmm-over there, 
A herd of animals so strange and rare
Nothing like those seen on planet Earth
Grazing on red grass in a canyon of great width

Our restless eyes scanning all around
We were eager to explore every bit of ground
Accelerating our pace in rising delight
We moved forward with enthusiastic gait

Sudden was the sound I heard behind
Puzzled and confused I looked around
And saw my mother standing near 
With a cane in raised hand on my rear

Like a stern militant
In a tone so blatant
She yelled out in an unforgiving tone
Her voice sounding a raspy moan

"You lazy swine-don’t you know this is exam time? 
Again, you can no more play a dumb mime-"
Rough and curt was her angry tirade
Making my afternoon reverie suddenly fade

I saw my open book sneering at me
And my uncovered syllabus, a vast sea

Born of grey froth and
Brought forth
Baptized in the sea
Prodigal son

Of the sea
With a glass of wine and the
Brine of blue-black mussels

Heeding the poet's cry
Through hidden nights
Dirges that echo through
Narrow cobble stoned streets and patina stained lamps

Dusty La Mancha beckons
Her mountains bursting through
Impossibly blue skies
Picasso blue

Toledo steel and lace
Smell of sheep and cheese
Citadels that stand against time

Flamenco smolders in
Andalucia; it burns
The guitar is a gypsy siren that
Calls us to founder on the
Rocky shoals of our soul

She dances on fire
Castanets are crickets in the dark
The floor is engulfed in flame and passion
My sweat cannot quench it

From  Pyrenees-perched Euskadi
Hidden from our view
To an ancient sea swimming with ship wrecked ghosts
She is there revealed
In desire
In never ending centuries

We are two and
We are one
Destined to meet
But never touchone fine spring morning
sitting in my chair
newspaper in hand
basking the sun
in front of my eyes 
a scene thus run: 

a sparrow perched
on nearby neem tree
sailed to my verandah
and sat on the sill, 
in front a  looking glass
a while she sat still
a little thoughtful
a little perplexed
finally she was 
bitterly vexed.

her own image in the glass
she couldn’t tolerate
to beat it with her bill 
at the glass she knocked, 
so madly she did drill
as if  ‘the other’ 
she would kill.
in doing this
she broke her beak
all over the beak
the blood did spill, 
ignorantly her own
she couldn’t bear
mercilessly her own
with her own beak tear.

frequently she visits, 
she now understands, 
she comes with her company
but I never saw the repeat, 
she and her company 
seem to have known
the harmony in Nature
to places they have flown.

WE ‘the roof and crown of things’
spill blood of our brothers
some times on in US and fly
again in Jaipur and 
Bombay high.

How long will go on this bloody trail? 
When will the harmony in man prevail

A sparrow sitting 
at the bar of my door, 
is finding solace on shade, 
from the deadly heat she abhors.

Singing melodies for whom? , i enquired
for her husband or for children, 
or is this she actually enjoys
without caring for service or reward.

She flapped her wings to reach
branches of a nearby tree, 
to continue her chirp.
A playful aura her voice creates
on the ear which reverberates. 

A shadow detached itself from
a tall tree, and winged passed me
in a zig-zag flight.  
I recall reading Leonardo bought
a sparrow in a Florentine market, 
cupped gently, briefly, panting and
stretching, in his painter's hands.

Then, he released it into the same 
zig-zag flight I had witnessed earlier.
I also remember, in a darker April, 
an opposite story when I was eleven.
A friend and I were shooting arrows
into strawmen on the Seminary grounds.
He aimed his bow at a robin, standing nearby.

'Don't shoot! ' I cried, but he did, 
and it was hit.  The arrow hung loosely 
in the bird's breast, and he tore it roughly out.
I was left with the bird, panting and
stretching toward a different end.
I used a rock to release the robin.
On the way home, lugging our bows

and arrows, he laughed. . 

Ever since the time 
in the maternity ward
when Marion Dixon, 
thinking you were her baby, 
exclaimed, "That’s the most 
gorgeous baby in the world! "
I’ve known you were a 
very special daughter. 

Every once in a while
The beholder casts
A special wish
And a flower is created

For every day that comes. 
This flower glows lovelier

With every breath it takes
Earth seems a little brighter

For with every sunrise
A heart becomes happier

With every breath it takes 
The air seems sweeter

For every time my eyes see
This flower blossom
It's a miracle and privilege
To be in its presense

Every time I touch this flower
I appreciate living

For I 'm grateful for being alive
When you are my special flower.


a special gift

and give love

Her name is Melvina Germain, 
a sister of the faith. 
It would seem she needs 
some help to strengthen her mind. 
She told me she feels 
her mind is weak

She needs your inner strength

She needs your blessing

She has given others the strength to carry on

Now it is she, 
who needs to find the help. 
Dear lord grant her 
that inner peace and the strength of mind 
she so desperately needs.

(November You are my creator
My mentor, my teacher, 
You are the guiding force of my life
Who always help me in times of strife.

I know you are and will always be
by my side, 
And these words I shall always abide.

I saw the world with your eyes
With your help was able to differentiate the good and the bad; 
Whenever I went wrong, you corrected me and yelled at me
The privilege which every mom has on her lad.

Yes friends, she is none other than my Mom
A wonderful creation of Almighty, 
She is the replacement of this holy deity.

Mom, you are the epitome of my existence
The reason for my subsistence, 
Howsoever I describe you, I know my words will always fall short
As a mom-child relationship is of that special sort

A poem for a Special Someone
Which in mind I always had, 
This person who was also once his Mamma's lad
Has dutifully moulded himself to be a great Dad.

As the saying goes, Dad is a son's first hero
And a daughters first love, 
Who goes out of the way to meet their demands
Without asking who why what how! 

He silently plays his role
Hence his greatness is hardly known, 
As Mom usually gets all the credit
Coz in major household chores she usually deems fit.

Dad, you have shown what Family really means (Father And Mother I Love You) 
You have nurtured our needs, 
I cannot forget your loving and caring nature
Which you have selflessly showered, come any weather! 

Words can never thank you enough
For all of your love and tears, 
That have shaped me into who I am today
Over these many years. .. 

Chorus from The Libation Bearers

A spectral vision clear
Thrills every hair with fear,
In haunted sleep,
Breathing of dire distress,
From innermost recess
Its watch doth keep,
Breaking with cry of fright
The still deep hush of night:
Sharp cry was heard that hour,
And they to whom 'twas given
To read decrees of Heaven,
In dream o'ertrue,
By solemn pledges bound,
Declared that underground
The dead were wrathful found
'Gainst those that slew. 

After the red leaf and the gold have gone,
Brought down by the wind, then by hammering rain
Bruised and discolored, when October's flame
Goes blue to guttering in the cusp, this land
Sinks deeper into silence, darker into shade.
There is a knowledge in the look of things,
The old hills hunch before the north wind blows.

Now I can see certain simplicities
In the darkening rust and tarnish of the time,
And say over the certain simplicities,
The running water and the standing stone,
The yellow haze of the willow and the black
Smoke of the elm, the silver, silent light
Where suddenly, readying toward nightfall,
The sumac's candelabrum darkly flames.
And I speak to you now with the land's voice,
It is the cold, wild land that says to you
A knowledge glimmers in the sleep of things:
The old hills hunch before the north wind blows. 

Within the flower there lies a seed,
Within the seed there springs a tree,
Within the tree there spreads a wood.

In the wood there burns a fire,
And in the fire there melts a stone,
Within the stone a ring of iron.

Within the ring there lies an O,
Within the O there looks an eye,
In the eye there swims a sea,

And in the sea reflected sky,
And in the sky there shines the sun,
Within the sun a bird of gold.

Within the bird there beats a heart,
And from the heart there flows a song,
And in the song there sings a word.

In the word there speaks a world,
A world of joy, a world of grief,
From joy and grief there springs my love.

Oh love, my love, there springs a world,
And on the world there shines a sun,
And in the sun there burns a fire,

Within the fire consumes my heart,
And in my heart there beats a bird,
And in the bird there wakes an eye,

Within the eye, earth, sea and sky,
Earth, sky and sea within an O
Lie like the seed within the flower. 

One day a spider said to a fly
'Though you pass this way daily

My hut has never been honored by you
By making a chance visit inside by you

Though depriving strangers of a visit does not matter
Evading the near and dear ones does not look good

My house will be honored by a visit by you
A ladder is before you if you decide to step in

Hearing this the fly said to the spider,
'Sire, you should entice some simpleton thus

This fly would never be pulled into your net
Whoever climbed your net could never step down'

The spider said, 'How strange, you consider me a cheat
I have never seen a simpleton like you in the world

I only wanted to entertain you
I had no personal gain in view

You have come flying from some unknown distant place
Resting for a while in my house would not harm you

Many things in this house are worth your seeing
Though apparently a humble hut you are seeing

Dainty drapes are hanging from the doors
And I have decorated the walls with mirrors

Beddings are available for guests' comforts
Not to everyone's lot do fall these comforts'.

The fly said, 'All this may very well be
But do not expect me to enter your house

Once asleep in them getting up again is impossible'


The spider spoke to itself on hearing this talk
'How to trap it? This wretched fellow is clever

Many desires are fulfilled with flattery in the world
All in the world are enslaved with flattery'

Thinking this the spider spoke to the fly thus! 

Everyone loves your beautiful face
Even if someone sees you for the first time

Your eyes look like clusters of glittering diamonds

This beauty, this dress, this elegance, this neatness! 
And all this is very much enhanced by singing in flight'.

The fly was touched by this flattery
And spoke, 'I do not fear you any more

I hate the habit of declining requests
Disappointing somebody is bad indeed'

Saying this it flew from its place
When it got close the spider snapped it

The spider had been starving for many days
The fly provided a good leisurely meal


It's outpatient surgery
and she's running late
trying to catch a spider

in the kitchen sink.
Wants to carry it outside 
before her boyfriend wakes 

and crushes it.
Then she has a long drive 
to the clinic and hopes

this will be her last visit.
Her boyfriend lied 
about having 

that procedure.
She found out the hard way, 
shouldn't have let him back in. 

A Spider sewed at Night
Without a Light
Upon an Arc of White.

If Ruff it was of Dame
Or Shroud of Gnome
Himself himself inform.

Of Immortality
His Strategy
Was Physiognomy. 

A centre and an expansion 
a life centred expanding 
the force of the centre whirls
a life without limit but it says
a centred life what gods the centre
does not tell but a centre
and from there a spiral
which has a beginning but no end
the life shaping the death the death
shaping the life it seems this life 
that life could not be told 
need not be told
every life drawn here
drawn because it could not be spoken
even in a lilting Irish voice
speaking a spiral sentence for
Irish sentences are like spirals
the centre expands without limit

the life was lived in the circle of the year
that comes round again sowing harvest
yet never back to the same place
as the mind the vision the experience expands whirls out
like a wild dance celebrating birth marriage death
yet passes the familiar place each season
and love love for the world
expands into a holy love
spiralling without limit yet never forgetting the centre
like a child on a gate swinging
knowing it’s safe because of the hinge
it knows but does not know
for others made the hinge

and now we read the spiral on a gravestone
tracing back from infinity to the source
everything that has an outward
everything that has an inward
and so there is no need for words
the spiral like a poem about life
read it forwards read it backwards
read it with thanks see it as grace
the thick green grass curls over it
the lichen yellow orange green
placed like a lizard
blesses this the most eloquent
gravestone in all the world
in a green field the clouds white
the sky blue this is the centre
of the spiral here now and 
there is no ending to the spiral
the gravestone says
but a starting yes


A spirit passed before me: I beheld
The face of immortality unveiled-- 
Deep sleep came down on every eye save mine--
And there it stood,--all formless--but divine:
Along my bones the creeping flesh did quake;
And as my damp hair stiffened, thus it spake:

Than He who deems even Seraphs insecure?
Creatures of clay--vain dwellers in the dust!
The moth survives you, and are ye more just?
Things of a day! you wither ere the night,
Heedless and blind to Wisdom's wasted light!'

'This is to be a mortal,
And seek the things beyond mortality!' ~ Manfred.


Thy voice prevails - dear friend, my gentle friend!
This long-shut heart for thee shall be unsealed,
And though thy soft eye mournfully will bend
Over the troubled stream, yet once revealed 
Shall its freed waters flow; then rocks must close
For evermore, above their dark repose.

Come while the gorgeous mysteries of the sky 
Fused in the crimson sea of sunset lie;
Come to the woods, where all strange wandering sound
Is mingled into harmony profound;
Where the leaves thrill with spirit, while the wind
Fills with a viewless being, unconfined,
The trembling reeds and fountains - our own dwell,
With its green dimness and AEolian breath, 
Shall suit the unveiling of dark records well -
Hear me in tenderness and silent faith!

Thou knewest me not in life's fresh vernal morn -
I would thou hadst! - for then my heart on thine
Had poured a worthier love; now, all o'erworn
By its deep thirst for something too divine,
It hath but fitful music to bestow,
Echoes of harp-strings broken long ago.

Yet even in youth companionless I stood,
As a lone forest-bird 'midst ocean's foam; 
For me the silver cords of brotherhood 
Were early loosed; the voice from my home
Passed one by one, and melody and mirth
Left me a dreamer by a silent hearth.

But, with the fulness of a heart that burned
For the deep sympathies of mind, I turned
From that unanswering spot, and fondly sought
In all wild scenes with thrilling murmurs fraught,
In every still small voice and sound of power,
And flute-note of the wind through cave and bower
A perilous delight! - for then first woke
My life's lone passion, the mysterious quest
Of secret knowledge; and each tone that broke
From the wood-arches or the fountain's breast,
Making my quick soul vibrate as a lyre,
But ministered to that strange inborn fire.

'Midst the bright silence of the mountain dells,
In noontide hours or golden summer-eves,
My thoughts have burst forth as a gale that swells
Into a rushing blast, and from the leaves
Shakes out response. O thou rich world unseen!
Thou curtained realm of spirits! - thus my cry
Hath troubled air and silence - dost thou lie
Spread all around, yet by some filmy screen
Shut from us ever? The resounding woods,
Do their depths teem with marvels? - and the floods,
And the pure fountains, leading secret veins
Of quenchless melody through rock and hill,
Have they bright dwellers? - are their lone domains
Peopled with beauty, which may never still

Our
weary thirst of soul? Cold, weak and cold,
Is earth's vain language, piercing not one fold
Of our deep being! Oh, for gifts more high!
For a seer's glance to rend mortality! 
For a charmed rod, to call from each dark shrine 
The oracles divine!

I woke from those high fantasies, to know
My kindred with the earth - I woke to love:
O gentle friend! to love in doubt and woe,
Shutting the heart the worshipped name above,
Is to love deeply - and 
my
spirit's dower
Was a sad gift, a melancholy power
Of so adoring - with a buried care,
And with the o'erflowing of a voiceless prayer,
And with a deepening dream that day by day, 
In the still shadow of the lonely sway,
Folded me closer, till the world held nought
Save the 
one
being to my centred thought.
There was no music but his voice to hear; 
No joy but such as with 
his
step drew near:
Light was but where he looked - life where he moved:
Silently, fervently, thus, thus I loved.
Oh! but such love is fearful! - and I knew
Its gathering doom: the soul's prophetic sight
Even then unfolded in my breast, and threw
O'er all things round a full, strong, vivid light,
Too sorrowfully clear! - an under-tone
Was given to Nature's harp, for me alone
Whispering of grief. Of grief? - be strong, awake! 
Hath not thy love been victory, O my soul?
Hath not its conflict won a voice to shake
Death's fastness? - a magic to control 
Worlds far removed? - from o'er the grave to thee
Love hath made answer; and 
thy
tale should be
Sung like a lay of triumph! Now return,
And take thy treasure from its bosomed urn,
And lift it once to light!

In fear, in pain,
I said I loved - but yet a heavenly strain
Of sweetness floated down the tearful stream,
A joy flashed through the trouble of my dream!
I knew myself beloved! - we breathed no vow,
No mingling visions might our fate allow,
As unto happy hearts; but still and deep,
Like a rich jewel gleaming in a grave,
Like golden sand in some dark river's wave,
So did my soul that costly knowledge keep
So jealousy! - a thing o'er which to shed,
When stars alone beheld the drooping head,
Lone tears! yet ofttimes burdened with the excess
Of our strange nature's quivering happiness.

But, oh! sweet friend! we dream not of love's might
Till death has robed with soft and solemn light
The image we enshrine! - Before 
that
hour,
We have but glimpses of the o'ermastering power
Within us laid! - 
then
doth the spirit-flame
With sword-like lightning rend its mortal frame; 
The wings of that which pants to follow fast
Shake their clay-bars, as with a prisoned blast-
The sea is in our souls!

He died, - 
he
died
On whom my lone devotedness was cast!
I might not keep one vigil by his side, 

I
, whose wrung heart watched with him to the last!
I might not once his fainting head sustain,
Nor bathe his parched lips in the hour of pain,
Nor say to him 'Farewell!' He passed away -
Oh! had 
my
love been there, its conquering sway
Had won him back from death! - but thus removed,
Borne o'er the abyss no sounding-line hath proved,
Joined with the unknown, the viewless - he became
Unto my thoughts another, yet the same -
Changed - hallowed - glorified! - and his low grave
Seemed a bright mournful altar - mine, all mine: -
Brother and friend soon left me 
that
sole shrine,
The birthright of the faithful! - 
their
world's wave
Soon swept them from its brink. Oh! deem thou not
That on the sad and consecrated spot
My soul grew weak! I tell thee that a power
There kindled heart and lip - a fiery shower
My words were made - a might was given to prayer,
And a strong grasp to passionate despair,
And a dread triumph! Knowest thou what I sought?
For what high boon my struggling spirit wrought?
- Communion with the dead! - I sent a cry
Through the veiled empires of eternity,
A voice to cleave them! By the mournful truth,
By the lost promise of my blighted youth,
By the strong chain a mighty love can bind
On the beloved, the spell of mind o'er mind; 
By words, which in themselves are magic high,
Armed and inspired, and winged with agony;
By tears, which comfort not, but burn, and seem
To bear the heart's blood in their passion-stream;
I summoned, I adjured - with quickened sense,
With the keen vigil of a life intense,
I watched, an answer from the winds to wring,
I listened, if perchance the stream might bring
Token from worlds afar: I taught 
one
sound
Unto a thousand echoes - one profound
Imploring accent to the tomb, the sky - 
One prayer to-night - 'Awake, appear, reply!'
Hast thou been told that from the viewless bourne,
The dark way never hath allowed return?
That all, which tears can move, with life is fled -
That earthly love is powerless on the dead?
Believe it not! - there is a large lone star
Now burning o'er yon western hill afar,
And under its clear light there lies a spot
Which well might utter forth - Believe it not!

I sat beneath that planet - I had wept 
My woe to stillness, every night-wind slept;
A hush was on the hills; the very streams
Went by like clouds, or noiseless founts in dreams
And the dark tree o'ershadowing me that hour, 
Stood motionless, even as the grey church-tower
Whereon I gazed unconsciously: - there came 
A low sound, like the tremor of a flame, 
Or like the light quick shiver of a wing,
Flitting through twilight woods, across the air;
And I looked up! Oh! for strong words to bring
Conviction o'er thy thought! Before me there,
He, the departed, stood! Ay, face to face,
So near, and yet how far! His form his mien,
Gave to remembrance back each burning trace
Within: - Yet something awfully serene, 
Pure, sculpture-like, on the pale brow, that wore
Of the once beating heart no token more;
And stillness on the lip - and o'er the hair
A gleam, that trembled through the breathless air;
And an unfathomed calm, that seemed to lie
In the gave sweetness of the illumined eye;
Told of the gulfs between our being set,
And, as that unsheathed spirit-glance I met,
Made my soul faint: - with 
fear?
Oh! 
not
with fear
With the sick feeling that in 
his
far sphere

My
love could be as nothing! But he spoke -
How shall I tell thee of the startling thrill
In that low voice, whose breezy tones could fill
My bosom's infinite? O friend! I woke

Then
first to heavenly life! Soft, solemn, clear
Breathed the mysterious accents on mine ear,
Yet strangely seem'd as if the while they rose
From depths of distance, o'er the wide repose
Of slumbering waters wafted, or the dells
Of mountains, hollow with sweet echo-cells; 
But, as they murmured on, the mortal chill
Passed from me, like a mist before the morn,
And, to that glorious intercourse upborne
By slow degrees, a calm, divinely still,
Possessed my frame: I sought that lighted eye -
From its intense and searching purity
I drank in 
soul!
- I questioned of the dead -
Of the hushed, starry shores their footsteps tread,
And I was answered. If remembrance there, 
With dreamy whispers fill the immortal air;
If thought, here piled from many a jewel-heap,
Be treasure in that pensive land to keep;
If love, o'ersweeping change, and blight, and blast,
Find 
there
the music of his home at last;
I asked, and I was answered. Full and high
Was that communion with eternity,
Too rich for aught so fleeting! Like a knell
Swept o'er my sense its closing words, 'Farewell,
On earth we meet no more!' And all was gone -
The pale bright settled brow - the thrilling tone,
The still and shining eye! and never more
May twilight gloom or midnight hush restore
That radiant guest! One full-fraught hour of heaven
To earthly passion's wild implorings given, 
Was made my own - the ethereal fire hath shivered
The fragile censer in whose mould it quivered,
Brightly, consumingly! What now is left?
A faded world, of glory's hues bereft -
A void, a chain! I dwell 'midst throngs, apart,
In the cold silence of the stranger's heart;
A fixed, immortal shadow stands between
My spirit and life's fast-receding scene; 
A gift hath severed me from human ties,
A power is gone from all earth's melodies,
Which never may return: their chords are broken,
The music of another land hath spoken -
No after-sound is sweet! This weary thirst!
And I have heard celestial fountains burst! -
What 
here
shall quench it?

Dost thou not rejoice,
When the spring sends forth an awakening voice
Through the young woods? Thou dost! And in that birth
Of early leaves, and flowers, and songs of mirth,
Thousands, like thee, find gladness! Couldst thou know
How every breeze then summons 
me
to go!
How all the light of love and beauty shed 
By those rich hours, but wooes me to the dead!
The 
only
beautiful that change no more -
The only loved! - the dwellings on the shore
Of spring fulfilled! The dead! - 
whom
call we so?
They that breathe purer air, that feel, that know
Things wrapt from us! Away! - within me pent,
That which is barred from its own element 
Still droops or struggles! But the day 
will
come -
Over the deep the free bird finds its home, 
And the stream lingers 'midst the rocks, yet greets
The sea at last; and the winged flower-seed meets
A soil to rest in: shall not 
I
, too, be,
My spirit-love! upborne to dwell with thee?
Yes! by the power whose conquering anguish stirred
The tomb, whose cry beyond the stars was heard,
Whose agony of triumph won thee back
Through the dim pass no mortal step may track, 
Yet shall we meet! - that glimpse of joy divine
Proved thee for ever and for ever mine

A spirit sped 
Through spaces of night; 
And as he sped, he called, 
He went through valleys 
Of black death-slime, 
Ever calling, 
Their echoes 
From crevice and cavern 
Mocked him: 
Fleetly into the plains of space 
He went, ever calling, 
Eventually, then, he screamed, 
Mad in denial, 
A swift hand, 
A sword from the sky, 
Smote him, 
And he was dead. 

Many lovely stories have been told
So passionately, rich they are like gold.
Strong feelings, lively emotions have been preserved
So intensely, true they are so vivid! 
Daily melodies have added a sweet flavour
Conveying divine messages from our Saviour.
A spiritual journey had its start, 
And it will never stop or fall apart.
She is pursuing her dream warmly
Enlightened by the ONE who attentively
Guides her, feeding her soul and mind
To be able to reach there those so kind! 

(h July To-day the plant by Williams set
Its summer bloom discloses;
The wilding sweethrier of his prayers
Is crowned with cultured roses.

Once more the Island State repeats
The lesson that he taught her,
And binds his pearl of charity
Upon her brown-locked daughter.

Is 't fancy that he watches still
His Providence plantations?
That still the careful Founder takes
A part on these occasions.

Methinks I see that reverend form,
Which all of us so well know
He rises up to speak; he jogs
The presidential elbow.

'Good friends,' he says, 'you reap a field
I sowed in self-denial,
For toleration had its griefs
And charity its trial.

'Great grace, as saith Sir Thomas More,
To him must needs be given
Who heareth heresy and leaves
The heretic to Heaven!

'I hear again the snuffled tones,
I see in dreary vision
Dyspeptic dreamers, spiritual bores,
And prophets with a mission.

'Each zealot thrust before my eyes
All creeds were shouted in my ears
As with the tongues of Babel.

'Scourged at one cart-tail, each denied
The hope of every other;
Each martyr shook his branded fist
At the conscience of his brother!

'How cleft the dreary drone of man.
The shriller pipe of woman,
As Gorton led his saints elect,
Who held all things in common!

'Their gay robes trailed in ditch and swamp,
And torn by thorn and thicket,
The dancing-girls of Merry Mount
Came dragging to my wicket.

'Shrill Anabaptists, shorn of ears;
Gray witch-wives, hobbling slowly;
And Antinomians, free of law,
Whose very sins were holy.

'Hoarse ranters, crazed Fifth Monarchists,
Of stripes and bondage braggarts,
Pale Churchmen, with singed rubrics snatched
From Puritanic fagots.

'And last, not least, the Quakers came,
With tongues still sore from burning,
The Bay State's dust from off their feet
Before my threshold spurning;

Faith's odds and ends together;
Well might I shrink from guests with lungs
Tough as their breeches leather

'If, when the hangman at their heels
Came, rope in hand to catch them,
I took the hunted outcasts in,
I never sent to fetch them.

'I fed, but spared them not a whit;
I gave to all who walked in,
Not clams and succotash alone,
But stronger meat of doctrine.

'I proved the prophets false, I pricked
The bubble of perfection,
And clapped upon their inner light
The snuffers of election.

'And looking backward on my times,
This credit I am taking;
I kept each sectary's dish apart,
No spiritual chowder making.

'Where now the blending signs of sect
Would puzzle their assorter,
The dry-shod Quaker kept the land,
The Baptist held the water.

'A common coat now serves for both,
The hat's no more a fixture;
And which was wet and which was dry,
Who knows in such a mixture?

'Well! He who fashioned Peter's dream
To bless them all is able;
And bird and beast and creeping thing
Make clean upon His table!

'I walked by my own light; but when
The ways of faith divided,
Was I to force unwilling feet
To tread the path that I did?

'I touched the garment-hem of truth,
Yet saw not all its splendor;
I knew enough of doubt to feel
For every conscience tender.

His Eden-trees were planted;
Because they chose amiss, should I
Deny the gift He granted?

'So, with a common sense of need,
Our common weakness feeling,
And His all-gracious dealing!

'I kept His plan whose rain and sun
To tare and wheat are given;
And if the ways to hell were free,
I left then free to heaven!'

Take heart with us, O man of old,
Soul-freedom's brave confessor,
Let sect and creed be lesser.

The jarring discords of thy day
In ours one hymn are swelling;
The wandering feet, the severed paths,
All seek our Father's dwelling.

And slowly learns the world the truth
That makes us all thy debtor,--
That holy life is more than rite,
And spirit more than letter;

That they who differ pole-wide serve
Perchance the common Master,
And other sheep He hath than they
Who graze one narrow pasture!

For truth's worst foe is he who claims
And deems, beyond his sentry-beat,
The crystal walls in danger!

Who sets for heresy his traps
Of verbal quirk and quibble,
With Satan's borrowed dibble.

To-day our hearts like organ keys
One Master's touch are feeling;
The branches of a common Vine
Have only leaves of healing.

Co-workers, yet from varied fields,
We share this restful nooning;
The Quaker with the Baptist here
Believes in close communing.

Forgive, dear saint, the playful tone,
Too light for thy deserving;
Thanks for thy generous faith in man,

Still echo in the hearts of men
The words that thou hast spoken;
No forge of hell can weld again
The fetters thou hast broken.

The pilgrim needs a pass no more
From Roman or Genevan;
Thought-free, no ghostly tollman keeps
Henceforth the road to Heaven

Close your eyes, my love, let me make you blind;  
     They have taught you to see  
Only a mean arithmetic on the face of things,  
A cunning algebra in the faces of men,  
Completing his circles, and working cleverly.  
 
I’ll kiss you over the eyes till I kiss you blind;  
     If I can—if any one could.  
Then perhaps in the dark you’ll have got what you want to find.
You’ve discovered so many bits, with your clever eyes,
     And I’m a kaleidoscope  
That you shake and shake, and yet it won’t come to your mind.
     Do you fear I shall swindle you?  
Do you think if you take me as I am, that that will abate you
Somehow?—so sad, so intrinsic, so spiritual, yet so cautious, you
Must have me all in your will and your consciousness—  
     I hate you. 

Sun beams
Reflect through
Cotton wool like remnants
Of departing clouds
In linear patterns.

Tiny pearls
Juggle the light rays
And diverge
An arc
In seven hues.

Scent of silt
And sodden dust
Rides the gust
Of mushroomy cool breeze
And disperse the serenity.

Jiving grasshoppers
Camouflaged in green
Mingle furtively
On dance floor 
Of moistened grass.

Naked trees 
Gravitate by wetness
Ensue the wistfulness 
Of olden days
When standing beneath them
After a rainfall
We would jolt their trunk
And enjoy the splash. 

Playing on the flute, gently holding the instrument
Eyes half closed, in a trance or a kind of enchantment.
Oblivious to the presence of all loved ones around
Perhaps in conversation with someone lost, not found.

A precious soul mate, who without giving reason, forsake, 
Could one turn so cruel, pay no heed to the heart break.
Love is meant to nourish and nurture and bring rapture
Here sat my cousin, with a soul in torment, fractured.

It’s in the genes, or an imbalance of hormones, 
To be split in two, pronounced the neuro surgeon.
Knowledge has limitations- why does the spirit
Hover between moments of coherence, I wonder as I sit.

No one heard any sound of a cry, as tears had dried.
But is it humanly possible to forever hide behind a lie.
At times it seems there is a smile and a light on the face.
Giving a glimpse of what once was- illusion, no trace.

Mother’s eyes flicker with hope as she watches her son, 
Awaits evil spirits departure and hug her with recognition.
 A life of promise, gone waste.  today at sixty, ravage of time
in and out of asylums, before spring manifest.  

autumn arrive. 

Splitter splatter, splitter splatter
The rain tumbles, the rain scatters
Such a day for rubber boots
Such a day for a poncho suit
What a moment to kiss my fella
Under this polka dot umbrella
The muddy puddles, we straddle
Should have brought a wooden paddle
The rain's no more a pitter patter
The rain is now a splitter splatter
Splitter splatter, splitter splatter
The rain tumbles, the rain scatters


Some things can't be fixed
any other way says Bill
in his bedroom

on the third floor
hoping to get some sleep
after working the third shift.

He adjusts the scope on 
his hunting rifle, makes certain
the silencer's on right  

glares out the window at 
a bull terrier barking all day, 
a dog that has never worked

a day in its life, Bill says.
In another minute the terrier  
will never have to either


In years defaced and lost, 
   Two sat here, transport-tossed, 
   Lit by a living love 
The wilted world knew nothing of: 
   Scared momently 
   By gaingivings, 
   Then hoping things 
   That could not be. 

   Of love and us no trace 
   Abides upon the place; 
   The sun and shadows wheel, 
Season and season sereward steal; 
   Foul days and fair 
   Here, too, prevail, 
   And gust and gale 
   As everywhere. 

   But lonely shepherd souls 
   Who bask amid these knolls 
   May catch a faery sound 
On sleepy noontides from the ground: 
   "O not again 
   Till Earth outwears 
   Shall love like theirs 
   Suffuse this glen!"His red eyes on stone shaped face
A look which nobody dares to take
The deep and intense voice that comes
Nobody wishes to hear from him

Very few are aware about his heart
That tickles behind like a gentle creek
I have seen the spring from the stone
The rock though hard, but shines within


Dark sod pierced by flames of flowers, 
Dead wood freshly quickening, 
Bright skies dusked with sudden showers, 
Lit by rainbows on the wing. 

Cuckoo calls and young lambs' bleating, 
Nimble airs which coyly bring 
Little gusts of tender greeting 
From shy nooks where violets cling. 

Half-fledged buds and birds and vernal 
Fields of grass dew-glistening; 
Evanescent life's eternal 
Resurrection, bridal Spring

She sang a song of May for me,
Wherein once more I heard
The mirth of my glad infancy--
The orchard's earliest bird--
The joyous breeze among the trees
New-clad in leaf and bloom,
And there the happy honey-bees
In dewy gleam and gloom.

So purely, sweetly on the sense
Of heart and spirit fell
Her song of Spring, its influence--
Still irresistible,--
Commands me here--with eyes ablur--
To mate her bright refrain.
Though I but shed a rhyme for her
As dim as Autumn rain. 

When the winter blooms into springtime, bright
And the birds are sweetly singing their tune
We consider Your benevolent might
And pray that the light doesn’t fade too soon

Yet, when the nightfall does fall from above
Your stars prolong the beauty of the sun
Shining on to remind us of Your love
And remind us Your work is never done

It is in these days of mild weather
That we find a relief from the harsh cold
One and all we all gather together
And fond memories and stories are told

At the end of winter you bless us so
Blessing, indeed, your creatures here below

oh where is this from

'let me flower''
'let me bear fruit and seed too'
'let me show my greenary to this world too'
a wild or a chosen seed's cry to the world

the chosen may be
nourished and cherished
the wild would even
crack through a concrete

this survival.  

is it
a fate or a fight
oh god let my roots grow deeper
let me sprout and not wither

Pistols up and back to back! 
Going to deliver, what here lacks! 

Haven’t done your birds and bees? 
Knee deep then in roiling seas.

Sat is up, about with the bait.
And you won’t have a sec to wait! 

I am more into serious moron stuff.
But here too, not leaving in a huff.

It’s a pleasure to be, with you folks.
Here every day with newer croaks!

April,Buraidah-KSAI had a machine on my arm 
and every half hour 
it put the squeeze on me. 
The Doctor wanted 
a twenty-four hour monitor 
but the fuel in my body 
for me. 
This machine had a mind 
of its own, 
if it didn’t like 
the first reading it got, 
it squeezed a bit harder 
until it got a better result 
just to show me 
that at it disapproved, 
the problem was 
there was nothing I could do, 
but just put up with it 
putting the squeeze 
on poor old me. 

Oh! Montmorency Vere de Vere,
To think that one I held so dear
Should use a base deceiver’s art
To trifle with my loving heart.

A brand new ten-cent valentine
With lace and hearts and verses fine,
I sent to show my love for thee
And in return you send to me
The one I sent to you last year,
Oh! Montmorency Vere de Vere. 

THEY are slaves who fear to speak	
For the fallen and the weak;	
They are slaves who will not choose	
Hatred, scoffing, and abuse,	
Rather than in silence shrink	        
From the truth they needs must think;	
They are slaves who dare not be	
In the right with two or three. 

Beauty was that
Far vanished flame,
Call it a star
Wanting better name.

And gaze and gaze
Vaguely until
Nothing is left
Save a grey ghost-hill.

Here wait I
On the world's rim
Stretching out hands
To Seraphim. 

My eyes are sleep-laden,
I return home taking with me songs of fallen crops!
Everything held secret is gone, — how long a dream lasts?
The sunset returned with its rose hue, —it does not resemble one!
Two stars conversed all night long,
Our face remains on earth all night long!

                          The night has progressed well,
Yet, I hardly felt it all these years!
Those who I never saw in daylight, — they all came in gloaming’s time;
The ones I never saw in the dust of the road – in smoke – among the crowd —
In my dream, I heard splash of water in the container, — the sound of bangles!
Under the night sky, I discovered them – aided by starlight!

                         My eyes were all awake
I witnessed many colored-cloud-cover skies in the twilight and before the sunrise!
Alone, I returned to the rustic crop field so many days!
I tiptoed in a shady day by myself only like a flouncing butterfly
For so many a time!  —In many inauspicious time, covering the meandering path
My trance ended, — the playhouse of my imagination came tumbling down.
 
                        Both my eyes are sleep-laden
I return home taking with me songs of fallen crops!
Everything held secret is gone, —how long a dream lasts?
The sunset returned with its rose hue, — it does not resemble one!
Two stars conversed all night long.


H. Jaffor Ullah]A birthday poem for my wife

A star fell from heaven
Into my arms last night
As we walked arm in arm
Under a cloudy moonlight
Now heavens missing an angel
Because I’m holding her tight

You came into my life
Like the first ray of the sun
And I knew right away 
That you were the one
There were no need for words
Just a small simple smile

My heart fluttered
With coming of the dawn
Because like the stars
I hoped you wouldn’t be gone
I wanted you there at my side
As each day fades to into night

I wanted you here 
As my lover and wife
Your not going back
I won’t let you go
I love you too much
To ever let you go


For Lincoln Mac


Veagh

Never tell me that not one star of all
That slip from heaven at night and softly fall
Has been picked up with stones to build a wall.

Some laborer found one faded and stone-cold,
And saving that its weight suggested gold
And tugged it from his first too certain hold,

He noticed nothing in it to remark.
He was not used to handling stars thrown dark
And lifeless from an interrupted arc.

He did not recognize in that smooth coal
The one thing palpable besides the soul
To penetrate the air in which we roll.

He did not see how like a flying thing
It brooded ant eggs, and bad one large wing,
One not so large for flying in a ring,

And a long Bird of Paradise's tail
(Though these when not in use to fly and trail
It drew back in its body like a snail):

Nor know that be might move it from the spot—
The harm was done: from having been star-shot
The very nature of the soil was hot

And burning to yield flowers instead of grain,
Flowers fanned and not put out by all the rain
Poured on them by his prayers prayed in vain.

He moved it roughly with an iron bar,
He loaded an old stoneboat with the star
And not, as you might think, a flying car,

Such as even poets would admit perforce
More practical than Pegasus the horse
If it could put a star back in its course.

He dragged it through the plowed ground at a pace
But faintly reminiscent of the race
Of jostling rock in interstellar space.

It went for building stone, and I, as though
Commanded in a dream, forever go
To right the wrong that this should have been so.

Yet ask where else it could have gone as well,
I do not know—I cannot stop to tell:
He might have left it lying where it fell.

From following walls I never lift my eye,
Except at night to places in the sky
Where showers of charted meteors let fly.

Some may know what they seek in school and church,
And why they seek it there; for what I search
I must go measuring stone walls, perch on perch;

Sure that though not a star of death and birth,
So not to be compared, perhaps, in worth
To such resorts of life as Mars and Earth—

Though not, I say, a star of death and sin,
It yet has poles, and only needs a spin
To show its worldly nature and begin

To chafe and shuffle in my calloused palm
And run off in strange tangents with my arm,
As fish do with the line in first alarm.

Such as it is, it promises the prize
Of the one world complete in any size
That I am like to compass, fool or wise. 

A starlet was I in a city of idiots.
A community of wolves on a roll.

They were predators on the make.
The maidens all in their fancy.

Maybe one was the prince, but the fact holds true.
These prowlers were relentless.

Women of kindness put their necks out.
The cave men schemed for a conquest.

This was the scene of a club that had low lights.
A drunk environment with plenty of prey.

I was in reverse. I was the mad panther.
In my world I could extinguish even the best of them.

to the mirrors it complain me. 
 
tonight i decided to be. 
tonight I return me to me 
let us contemplate our night 
be the mirrors,    spend a heartfelt night with me 
 
waiting no more 
for the  hopes, for closed doors 
to the  mirrors the waiting complain me
 
tonight a little heart will take 
that  is the time to give me 
 
the waiting apologize to me

Speak out my dear
Why hath thou in a state of depression? 
Speak out my dear
I stand here waiting for thy confession

Depression is not a sign of weakness
Neither an indication of madness

I stand here not to judge you
Simply to take heed to what is true

Depression is not a crime
It only calls for love through time

Depression is a silent voice
Rooted deep inside to stop a crying noise

Speak out my dear
Why hath thou in a state of depression? 
Speak out my dear
I stand here waiting for thy confession

What have you lost along the way? 
Retrace your steps, I say

Who have you lost? 
Take heart, everything in life must rust

What is it you want? 
Grant me a permit in your hunt
But first of all let me be blunt
Condemn yourself not for your mistakes
That is what it takes for you to be awake

Life is meant to be messy and greasy
The road is not meant to be easy

Speak out my dear
Why hath thou in a state of depression? 
Speak out my dear
I stand here as a friend
My compassionate heart is yours to lend
Merely to give you inspiration
And redeem you of your depression

Thus, speak out my dear! 
Why hath thou in a state of depression?

I lived among great houses,
Riches drove out rank,
Base drove out the better blood,
And mind and body shrank.
No Oscar ruled the table,
But I'd a troop of friends
That knowing better talk had gone
Talked of odds and ends.
Some knew what ailed the world
But never said a thing,
So I have picked a better trade
And night and morning sing:
Tall dames go walking in grass-green Avalon.

That slept upon the Sack?
Commanding officer that tore
The khaki from his back?
Or am I de Valera,
Or the King of Greece,
Or the man that made the motors?
Ach, call me what you please!
Here's a Montenegrin lute,
And its old sole string
Makes me sweet music
And I delight to sing:
Tall dames go walking in grass-green Avalon.

With boys and girls about him.
With any sort of clothes,
With a hat out of fashion,
With Old patched shoes,
With a ragged bandit cloak,
With an eye like a hawk,
With a stiff straight back,
With a strutting turkey walk.
With a bag full of pennies,
With a monkey on a chain,
With a great cock's feather,
With an old foul tune.
Tall dames go walking in grass-green Avalon. 

I was a goddess ere the marble found me. 
Wind, wind, delay not! 
Waft my spirit where the laurel crowned me! 
Will the wind stay not?

Then tarry, tarry, listen, little swallow! 
An old glory feeds me 
I lay upon the bosom of Apollo! 
Not a bird heeds me.

For here the days are alien. Oh, to waken 
Mine, mine, with calling! 
But on my shoulders bare, like hopes forsaken, 
The dead leaves are falling.

The sky is gray and full of unshed weeping 
As dim down the garden 
I wait and watch the early autumn sweeping. 
The stalks fade and harden.

The souls of all the flowers afar have rallied. 
The trees, gaunt, appalling, 
Attest the gloom, and on my shoulders pallid 
The dead leaves are falling. 

It's my lunch hour, so I go
for a walk among the hum-colored
cabs. First, down the sidewalk
where laborers feed their dirty
glistening torsos sandwiches
and Coca-Cola, with yellow helmets
on. They protect them from falling
bricks, I guess. Then onto the
avenue where skirts are flipping
above heels and blow up over
grates. The sun is hot, but the
cabs stir up the air. I look
at bargains in wristwatches. There
are cats playing in sawdust.

On
to Times Square, where the sign
blows smoke over my head, and higher
the waterfall pours lightly. A
Negro stands in a doorway with a
toothpick, languorously agitating
A blonde chorus girl clicks: he
smiles and rubs his chin. Everything
suddenly honks: it is of
a Thursday.

Neon in daylight is a
great pleasure, as Edwin Denby would
write, as are light bulbs in daylight.
I stop for a cheeseburger at JULIET'S
CORNER. Giulietta Maina, wife of
Federico Fellini, e bell' attrice.
And chocolate malted. A lady in
foxes on such a day puts her poodle
in a cab.

There are several Puerto
Ricans on the avenue today, which
makes it beautiful and warm. First
Bunny died, then John Latouche,
then Jackson Pollock. But is the
earth as full of life was full, of them?
And one has eaten and one walks,
past the magazines with nudes
and the posters for BULLFIGHT and
the Manhatten Storage Warehouse,
which they'll soon tear down. I
used to think they had the Armory
Show there.

A glass of papaya juice
and back to work. My heart is in my
pocket, it is Poems by Pierre Reverdy. 

Time goes by unceasingly while the months and years continue to grow uncontrollably, laughter turns into tears, anger turns into fears stopping us from pursuing our dreams clouding our optimism leading us to sheltering ourselves from the opportunities the world has to bring, hiding the gifts we carry to share with ourselves and others who need to see it.

We wallow in our own desolation created from a thought within our own minds, making us our own enemy. This world is sick but at the same time you can find it ravishing if you look past the detrimental parts that cause pain and loathing.

The things we can't control leave us in a stalemate stirring up a feeling of vanquish, it is unpleasant but it's not defeat accept what is beyond our grasp and proceed to follow what you feel is important no one can take that away from you.

The faults we endure in this life make room for improvement and gradually make us stronger and the mind sharper. 

I will never settle for less I know what I am worth, I will not lose sleep over the thought of someone's negative opinion as I put my foot down to become a better person as this world continues to worsen. I am no better then you and you are not any better then me, we both suffer and we both grow. 

She enjoys it, 
the pain of her youth.
She would be nothing without it, 
having nothing to fill.

An eternal copulation, 
constant ecstasy.
Where is the fun in that? 
All she wants is fun.

Her mind can be fucked, but it produces no offspring.
Cancelled notions of humanity.
She dyes her hair, 
and wears a plastered smile.
Denying her pain, 
Denying her love.

Her thoughts recur 
as if she were imprisoned.
Time, the imaginary passing, 
reveals to her a still life.

She exhausts herself, 
with these indefatigable thoughts.
Looking, looking, 
for something more
than the nothing she was left with.

But, my love, it was transient. That's all it was.
And you have everything.
You have life. What more can one ask for? 
This is your turn. And no one owes you anything.
Especially not Earth. She was here first. 

Whence did all that fury come?
From empty tomb or Virgin womb?
Saint Joseph thought the world would melt
But liked the way his finger smelt.A still—Volcano—Life—
That flickered in the night—
When it was dark enough to do
Without erasing sight—

A quiet—Earthquake Style—
Too subtle to suspect
By natures this side Naples—
The North cannot detect

The Solemn—Torrid—Symbol—
The lips that never lie—
Whose hissing Corals part—and shut—
And Cities—ooze away—A stone I died and rose again a plant;
A plant I died and rose an animal;
I died an animal and was born a man.
Why should I fear? What have I lost by death

Here death, killing, violence, hunger
round the clock play the doom's game; 
Snatching, hijacking, injustice, inconvenience
grow the grass of sorrow in the field of life.

stands the sandy sad shoal vast, stretched and lonely; 
Still life does not bow down to sorrow
but stands erect like the rocks.

Here drought, flood, tidal surge 
come like giants in greed of life
and then inflicts raids and riots
on life like Azrael*.

Yet what a stony hero this country is- that does not 
get cracked into parts in drought of sorrow! 



* the angel of death
[Translation of Bangla poem 'Pathor Bir' taken from the poet's first book 'Pronoyer Prothom Pap' ( ]A lonely boy, far venturing from home 
Out on the half-wild herd’s faint tracks I roam; 
Mid rock-browned mountains, which with stony frown 
Glare into haggard chasms deep adown; 
A rude and craggy world, the prospect lies 
Bounded in circuit by the bending skies. 
Now at some clear pool scooped out by the shocks 
Of rain-floods plunging from the upper rocks 
Whose liquid disc in its undimpled rest 
Glows like a mighty gem brooching the mountain’s breast, 
I drink and must, or mark the wide-spread herd, 
Or list the thinking of the dingle-bird; 
And now towards some wild-hanging shade I stray, 
To shun the bright oppression of the day; 
For round each crag, and o’er each bosky swell, 
The fierce refracted heat flares visible, 
Lambently restless, like the dazzling hem 
Of some else viewless veil held trembling over them. 
Why congregate the swallows in the air, 
And northward then in rapid flight repair? 
With sudden swelling din, remote yet harsh, 
Why roar the bull-frogs in the tea-tree marsh? 
Why cease the locusts to throng up in flight 
And clap their gay wings in the fervent light? 
Why climb they, bodingly demure, instead 
The tallest spear-grass to the bending head? 
Instinctively, along the sultry sky, 
I turn a listless, yet inquiring, eye; 
And mark that now with a slow gradual pace 
A solemn trance creams northward o’er its face; 
Yon clouds that late were labouring past the sun, 
Reached by its sure arrest, one after one, 
Come to a heavy halt; the airs that played 
About the rugged mountains all are laid: 
While drawing nearer far-off heights appear, 
As in a dream’s wild prospect, strangely near! 
Till into wood resolves their robe of blue, 
And the grey crags rise bluffly on the view. 
Such are the signs and tokens that presage 
A summer hurricane’s forthcoming rage. 

At length the south sends out her cloudy heaps 
And up the glens at noontide dimness creeps; 
The birds, late warbling in the hanging green 
Off steep-set brakes, seek now some safer screen; 
The herd, in doubt, no longer wanders wide, 
But fast ingathering throngs yon mountain’s side, 
Whose echoes, surging to its tramp, might seem 
The muttered troubles of some Titan’s dream. 

Fast the dim legions of the muttering storm 
Throng denser, or protruding columns form; 
While splashing forward from their cloudy lair, 
Convolving flames, like scouting dragons, glare: 
Low thunders follow, labouring up the sky; 
And as fore-running blasts go blaring by, 
At once the forest, with a mighty stir, 
Bows, as in homage to the thunderer! 

Hark! From the dingoes blood-polluted dens 
In the gloom-hidden chasms of the glens, 
Long fitful howls wail up; and in the blast 
Strange hissing whispers seem to huddle past; 
As if the dread stir had aroused from sleep 
Weird spirits, cloistered in yon cavy steep 
(On which, in the grim past, some Cain’s offence 
Hath haply outraged heaven!) Who rising thence 
Wrapped in the boding vapours, laughed again 
To wanton in the wild-willed hurricane. 
See in the storm’s front, sailing dark and dread, 
A wide-winged eagle like a black flag spread! 
The clouds aloft flash doom! Short stops his flight! 
He seems to shrivel in the blasting light! 
The air is shattered with a crashing sound, 
And he falls stonelike, lifeless, to the ground. 

Now, like a shadow at great nature’s heart, 
The turmoil grows. Now wonder, with a start, 
Marks where right overhead the storm careers, 
Girt with black horrors and wide-flaming fears! 
Arriving thunders, mustering on his path, 
Swell more and more the roarings of his wrath, 
As out in widening circles they extend, 
And then—at once—in utter silence end. 

Portentous silence! Time keeps breathing past, 
Yet it continues! May this marvel last? 
This wild weird silence in the midst of gloom 
So manifestly big with coming doom? 
Tingles the boding ear; and up the glens 
Instinctive dread comes howling from the wild-dogs dens. 

Terrific vision! Heaven’s great ceiling splits, 
And a vast globe of writhing fire emits, 
Which pouring down in one continuous stream, 
Spans the black concave like a burning beam, 
A moment;—then from end to end it shakes 
With a quick motion—and in thunder breaks! 
Peal rolled on peal! While heralding the sound, 
As each concussion thrills the solid ground, 
Fierce glares coil, snake-like, round the rocky wens 
Of the red hills, or hiss into the glens, 
Or thick through heaven like flaming falchions swarm, 
Cleaving the teeming cisterns of the storm, 
From which rain-torrents, searching every gash, 
Split by the blast come sheeting with a dash. 

On yon grey peak, from rock-encrusted roots, 
The mighty patriarch of the wood upshoots, 
In whose proud-spreading top’s imperial height, 
The mountain-eagle loveth most to light: 
Now dimly seen through the tempestuous air, 
His form seems harrowed by a mad despair, 
As with his ponderous arms uplifted high, 
He wrestles with the storm and threshes at the sky! 
A swift bolt hurtles through the lurid air, 
Another thundering crash! The peak is bare! 
Huge hurrying fragments all around are cast, 
The wild-winged, mad-limbed monsters of the blast. 

The darkness thickens! With despairing cry 
From shattering boughs the rain-drenched parrtos fly; 
Loose rocks roll rumbling from the mountains round, 
And half the forest strews the smoking ground; 
To the bared crags the blasts now wilder moan, 
And the caves labour with a ghostlier groan. 
Wide raging torrents down the gorges flow 
Swift bearing with them to the vale below 
Those sylvan wrecks that littered late the path 
Of the loud hurricane s all-trampling wrath. 

The storm is past. Yet booming on afar 
Is heard the rattling of the thunder-car, 
And that low muffled moaning, as of grief, 
Which follows with a wood-sigh wide and brief. 
The clouds break up; the sun s forth-bursting rays 
Clothe the wet landscape with a dazzling blaze; 
The birds begin to sing a lively strain, 
And merry echoes ring it o’er again; 
The clustered herd is spreading out to graze, 
Though lessening torrents still a hundred ways 
Flash downward, and from many a rock ledge 
A mantling gush comes quick and shining o er the edge. 

’Tis evening; and the torrent’s furious flow 
Runs gentlier now into the lake below, 
O’er all the freshened scene no sound is heard, 
Save the short twitter of some busied bird, 
Or a faint rustle made amongst the trees 
By wasting fragments of a broken breeze. 
Along the wild and wreck-strewed paths I wind, 
Watching earth’s happiness with quiet mind, 
And see a beauty all unmarked till now 
Flushing each flowery nook and sunny brow; 
Wished peace returning like a bird of calm, 
Brings to the wounded world its blessed healing balm. 

               On nerveless, tuneless lines how sadly 
               Ringing rhymes may wasted be, 
               While blank verse oft is mere prose madly 
               Striving to be poetry: 
               While prose that’s craggy as a mountain 
               May Apollo’s sun-robe don, 
               Or hold the well-spring of a fountain 
               Bright as that in Helicon. 

Everyday we seek shelter 
from an approaching storm. 
Whether it comes naturally 
or is a homemade one. 
A storm is a storm 
and its turbulence is always felt. 
Where it be rain, snow, flood, 
hurricane or tornado, 
or someone playing mind games 
to try to hurt us in someway. 
A storm is a storm.


January ike an arid desert of Sahara, 
My lungs of soul 
were suffocating, 
For whiffs of love, 
For moist caresses of 
grace woven gloves. 

I cried to heaven 
hanging dispassionately 
atop the worlds seven, 
in a Sisyphean search of 
peace tinged love, 
And suddenly gracious heaven opened up 
and swept me out off my feet, 
for a ride smooth and tough. 

Lo! I am in arms of storm 
nay, in a hearth of that love built dorm. 
It’s roller coaster rides of emotions 
ferries me in blissful circular motions. 

It’s wetness of love caresses my heart, 
It’s coolness of care soothes my parts. 
My nerves are tormented, 
My heart is comforted. 

Aureate bliss has enveloped me, 
Rosette love has possessed me, 
Nay! It has even infiltrated me. 
My soul is at complete mercy of it. 
This ride can break me 
or make me as it please. 

But who cares 
AS I AM IN EYE OF STORM. 





See, where on high the moving masses, piled
By the wind, break in groups grotesque and wild,
Present strange shapes to view;
Oft flares a pallid flash from out their shrouds,
As though some air-born giant 'mid the clouds
Sudden his falchion drew. 

Sad is the man who is asked for a story
and can't come up with one.

His five-year-old son waits in his lap.
Not the same story, Baba. A new one.
The man rubs his chin, scratches his ear.

In a room full of books in a world
of stories, he can recall
not one, and soon, he thinks, the boy
will give up on his father.

Already the man lives far ahead, he sees
the day this boy will go. Don't go!
Hear the alligator story! The angel story once more!
You love the spider story. You laugh at the spider.
Let me tell it!

But the boy is packing his shirts,
he is looking for his keys. Are you a god,
the man screams, that I sit mute before you?
Am I a god that I should never disappoint?

But the boy is here. Please, Baba, a story?
It is an emotional rather than logical equation,
an earthly rather than heavenly one,
which posits that a boy's supplications
and a father's love add up to silence. 

He loved her and he was untrue— 
Untrue he was, let loved her still; 
For out of nether darkness drew 
The winds that lashed his wandering will. 

She lived in joy all unaware, 
In pain and joy his children bore, 
While hidden spectres of despair 
Drove him to love her more and more. 

And when she knew the truth at last, 
Suddenly she grew still and strange. 
Her rag of haggard youth was cast 
Upon the evil winds of change. 

She heard, and could not understand; 
She paled, and could not bloom again. 
So bland death took her by the hand, 
Looked in her eyes and made all plain, 

Yes, wise death taught her all, and so, 
Smiling once more, she kissed and passed. 
And he, caught in life's overthrow, 
Faced love and death alone at last.

At last, made strong by love and death, 
He gave her truth for truth, and knew 
Now she had won his perfect faith. 
Dying, she doomed him to be true. 

Everyone loves a story. Let's begin with a house.
We can fill it with careful rooms and fill the rooms
with things—tables, chairs, cupboards, drawers
closed to hide tiny beds where children once slept
or big drawers that yawn open to reveal
precisely folded garments washed half to death,
unsoiled, stale, and waiting to be worn out.
There must be a kitchen, and the kitchen
must have a stove, perhaps a big iron one
with a fat black pipe that vanishes into the ceiling
to reach the sky and exhale its smells and collusions.
This was the center of whatever family life
was here, this and the sink gone yellow
around the drain where the water, dirty or pure, 
ran off with no explanation, somehow like the point
of this, the story we promised and may yet deliver.
Make no mistake, a family was here. You see
the path worn into the linoleum where the wood,
gray and certainly pine, shows through.
Father stood there in the middle of his life
to call to the heavens he imagined above the roof
must surely be listening. When no one answered
you can see where his heel came down again
and again, even though he'd been taught
never to demand. Not that life was especially cruel;
they had well water they pumped at first,
a stove that gave heat, a mother who stood
at the sink at all hours and gazed longingly
to where the woods once held the voices
of small bears—themselves a family—and the songs
of birds long fled once the deep woods surrendered
one tree at a time after the workmen arrived
with jugs of hot coffee. The worn spot on the sill
is where Mother rested her head when no one saw,
those two stained ridges were handholds
she relied on; they never let her down.
Where is she now? You think you have a right
to know everything? The children tiny enough
to inhabit cupboards, large enough to have rooms
of their own and to abandon them, the father
with his right hand raised against the sky?
If those questions are too personal, then tell us,
where are the woods? They had to have been
because the continent was clothed in trees.
We all read that in school and knew it to be true.
Yet all we see are houses, rows and rows
of houses as far as sight, and where sight vanishes
into nothing, into the new world no one has seen,
there has to be more than dust, wind-borne particles
of burning earth, the earth we lost, and nothing else. 

Until tonight they were separate specialties, 
different stories, the best of their own worst. 
Riding my warm cabin home, I remember Betsy's 
laughter; she laughed as you did, Rose, at the first 
story. Someday, I promised her, I'll be someone 
going somewhere and we plotted it in the humdrum 
school for proper girls. The next April the plane 
bucked me like a horse, my elevators turned 
and fear blew down my throat, that last profane 
gauge of a stomach coming up. And then returned 
to land, as unlovely as any seasick sailor, 
sincerely eighteen; my first story, my funny failure. 
Maybe Rose, there is always another story, 
better unsaid, grim or flat or predatory. 
Half a mile down the lights of the in-between cities 
turn up their eyes at me. And I remember Betsy's 
story, the April night of the civilian air crash 
and her sudden name misspelled in the evening paper, 
the interior of shock and the paper gone in the trash 
ten years now. She used the return ticket I gave her. 
This was the rude kill of her; two planes cracking 
in mid-air over Washington, like blind birds. 
And the picking up afterwards, the morticians tracking 
bodies in the Potomac and piecing them like boards 
to make a leg or a face. There is only her miniature 
photograph left, too long now for fear to remember. 
Special tonight because I made her into a story 
that I grew to know and savor. 
A reason to worry, 
Rose, when you fix an old death like that, 
and outliving the impact, to find you've pretended. 
We bank over Boston. I am safe. I put on my hat. 
I am almost someone going home. The story has ended. 

As writers we should see 
a story in everything, 
whether it be a dying twig, 
or the birdies singing, 
the bit of paper 
carried along by the wind 
or and old tyre discarded. 
Everything has a story 
of why, when and where, 
and through our imaginations 
we should recognise it there.

May urs was a story
Of passion
Of secret
Of love

Ours was a story
Of having to let go of something
When how we felt about each other
Just wasn't enough

Ours was a story
Doomed from the beginning
And torn apart
By the clutches of fate

Ours is a story
That will remain precious to me
Something I'll never truly hate

Ours is a story
That can never be lived again
Or told by another
Ours
My dear
Was a story like no other

shraddha.  . . 

Niloiya said to Noah, 'What aileth thee,
My master, unto whom is my desire,
The father of my sons?' He answered her,
'Mother of many children, I have heard
The Voice again.' 'Ah, me!' she saith, 'ah, me!
What spake it?' and with that Niloiya sighed.

This when the Master-builder heard, his heart
Was sad in him, the while he sat at home
And rested after toil. The steady rap
O' the shipwright's hammer sounding up the vale
Did seem to mock him; but her distaff down
Niloiya laid, and to the doorplace went,
Parted the purple covering seemly hung
Before it, and let in the crimson light
Of the descending sun. Then looked he forth,—
Looked, and beheld the hollow where the ark
Was a-preparing; where the dew distilled
All night from leaves of old lign aloe-trees,
Upon the gliding river; where the palm,
The almug, and the gophir shot their heads
Into the crimson brede that dyed the world:
And lo! he marked—unwieldy, dark, and huge—The
ship, his glory and his grief,—too vast
For that still river's floating,—building far
From mightier streams, amid the pastoral dells
Of shepherd kings.

          Niloiya spake again:
'What said the Voice, thou well-beloved man?'
He, laboring with his thought that troubled him,
'A little handful of unlovely dust
He fashioned to a lordly grace, and when
He laughed upon its beauty, it waxed warm,
And with His breath awoke a living soul.

'Shall not the Fashioner command His work?
And who am I, that, if He whisper, 'Rise,
Go forth upon Mine errand,' should reply,
Have me excused.''

         She answered him, 'Tell on.'
And he continuing, reasoned with his soul:
'What though I,—like some goodly lama sunk
In meadow grass, eating her way at ease,
Unseen of them that pass, and asking not
A wider prospect than of yellow-flowers
That nod above her head,—should lay me down,
And willingly forget this high behest,
There should be yet no tarrying. Furthermore,
Though I went forth to cry against the doom,
Earth crieth louder, and she draws it down:
It hangeth balanced over us; she crieth,
And it shall fall. O! as for me, my life
Is bitter, looking onward, for I know
That in the fulness of the time shall dawn
That day: my preaching shall not bring forth fruit,
Though for its sake I leave thee. I shall float
Upon the abhorr餠sea, that mankind hate,
With thee and thine.'
For, sir, though men be evil, yet the deep
They dread, and at the last will surely turn
To Him, and He long-suffering will forgive.
And chide the waters back to their abyss,
To cover the pits where doleful creatures feed.
Sir, I am much afraid: I would not hear
Of riding on the waters: look you, sir,
Better it were to die with you by hand
Of them that hate us, than to live, ah me!
Rolling among the furrows of the unquiet,
Unconsecrate, unfriendly, dreadful sea.'

He saith again: 'I pray thee, woman, peace,
For thou wilt enter, when that day appears,
The fateful ship.'

            'My lord,' quoth she, 'I will.
But O, good sir, be sure of this, be sure
The Master calleth; for the time is long
That thou hast warned the world: thou art but here
Three days; the song of welcoming but now
Is ended. I behold thee, I am glad;
And wilt thou go again? Husband, I say,
Be sure who 't is that calleth; O, be sure,
Be sure. My mother's ghost came up last night,
Whilst I thy beard, held in my hands did kiss,
Leaning anear thee, wakeful through my love,
And watchful of thee till the moon went down.

'She never loved me since I went with thee
To sacrifice among the hills: she smelt
The holy smoke, and could no more divine
Till the new moon. I saw her ghost come up;
It had a snake with a red comb of fire
Twisted about its waist,—the doggish head
Lolled on its shoulder, and so leered at me.
'This woman might be wiser,' quoth the ghost;
'Shall there be husbands for her found below,
When she comes down to us? O, fool! O, fool!
She must not let her man go forth, to leave
Her desolate, and reap the whole world's scorn,
A harvest for himself.' With that they passed.'

He said, 'My crystal dropp of perfectness,
I pity thee; it was an evil ghost:
Thou wilt not heed the counsel?' 'I will not,'
Quoth she; 'I am loyal to the Highest. Him
I hold by even as thou, and deem Him best.
Sir, am I fairer than when last we met?'

As I do think thou art.' 'And think you, sir,'
Niloiya saith, 'that I have reached the prime?'
He answering, 'Nay, not yet.' 'I would 't were so,'
She plaineth, 'for the daughters mock at me:
Her locks forbear to grow, they say, so sore
She pineth for the master. Look you, sir,
They reach but to the knee. But thou art come,
And all goes merrier. Eat, my lord, of all
My supper that I set, and afterward
Tell me, I pray thee, somewhat of thy way;
Else shall I be despised as Adam was,
Who compassed not the learning of his sons,
But, grave and silent, oft would lower his head
And ponder, following of great Isha's feet,
When she would walk with her fair brow upraised,
Scorning the children that she bare to him.'

'Ay,' quoth the Master; 'but they did amiss
When they despised their father: knowest thou that?'

'Sure he was foolisher,' Niloiya saith,
'Than any that came after. Furthermore,
He had not heart nor courage for to rule:
He let the mastery fall from his slack hand.
Had not our glorious mother still borne up
His weakness, chid with him, and sat apart,
And listened, when the fit came over him
To talk on his lost garden, he had sunk
Into the slave of slaves.'

             'Nay, thou must think
And looked in hope among the tribes for one
To be his fellow, ere great Isha, once
Waking, he found at his left side, and knew
The deep delight of speech.' So Noah, and thus
Added, 'And therefore was his loss the more;
For though the creatures he had singled out
His favorites, dared for him the fiery sword
And followed after him,—shall bleat of lamb
Or in the afternoon, his faithful dog,
Fawning upon him, make his heart forget
At such a time, and such a time, to have heard
What he shall hear no more?

                 'O, as for him,
It was for this that he full oft would stop,
And, lost in thought, stand and revolve that deed,
Sad muttering, Woman! we reproach thee not;
Though thou didst eat mine immortality;
Earth, be not sorry; I was free to choose.
Wonder not, therefore, if he walked forlorn.
Was not the helpmeet given to raise him up
From his contentment with the lower things?
Was she not somewhat that he could not rule
Beyond the action, that he could not have
By the mere holding, and that still aspired
And drew him after her? So, when deceived
She fell by great desire to rise, he fell
By loss of upward drawing, when she took
An evil tongue to be her counsellor:
'Death is not as the death of lower things,
Rather a glorious change, begrudged of Heaven,
A change to being as gods,'—he from her hand,
Upon reflection, took of death that hour,
And ate it (not the death that she had dared):
He ate it knowing. Then divisions came.
She, like a spirit strayed who lost the way,
Too venturesome, among the farther stars,
And hardly cares, because it hardly hopes
To find the path to heaven; in bitter wise
Did bear to him degenerate seed, and he,
Once having felt her upward drawing, longed,
And yet aspired, and yearned to be restored,
Albeit she drew no more.'

              'Sir, ye speak well,'
Niloiya saith, 'but yet the mother sits
Higher than Adam. He did understand
Discourse of birds and all four-footed things,
But she had knowledge of the many tribes
Of angels and their tongues; their playful ways
And greetings when they met. Was she not wise?
They say she knew much that she never told,
And had a voice that called to her as thou.'

'Nay,' quoth the Master-shipwright, 'who am I
That I should answer? As for me, poor man,
Here is my trouble: 'if there be a Voice,'
At first I cried, 'let me behold the mouth
That uttereth it,' Thereon it held its peace.
But afterward, I, journeying up the hills,
Did hear it hollower than an echo fallen
Across some clear abyss; and I did stop,
And ask of all my company, 'What cheer?
If there be spirits abroad that call to us,
Sirs, hold your peace and hear,' So they gave heed,
And one man said, 'It is the small ground-doves
That peck upon the stony hillocks': one,
'It is the mammoth in yon cedar swamp
That cheweth in his dream': and one, 'My lord,
It is the ghost of him that yesternight
We slew, because he grudged to yield his wife
To thy great father, when he peaceably
Did send to take her,' Then I answered, 'Pass,'
And they went on; and I did lay mine ear
Close to the earth; but there came up therefrom
No sound, nor any speech; I waited long.
And in the saying, 'I will mount my beast
And on,' I was as one that in a trance
Beholdeth what is coming, and I saw
Great waters and a ship; and somewhat spake,
'Lo, this shall be; let him that heareth it,
And seeth it, go forth to warn his kind,
For I will drown the world,''

               Niloiya saith,
'Sir, was that all that ye went forth upon?'
The master, he replieth, 'Ay, at first,
That same was all; but many days went by,
While I did reason with my heart and hope
For more, and struggle to remain, and think.
'Let me be certain'; and so think again,
'The counsel is but dark; would I had more!
When I have more to guide me, I will go,'
And afterward, when reasoned on too much,
It seemed remoter, then I only said,
'O, would I had the same again'; and still
I had it not.

        'Then at the last I cried,
'If the unseen be silent, I will speak
And certify my meaning to myself.
Say that He spoke, then He will make that good
Which He hath spoken. Therefore it were best
To go, and do His bidding. All the earth
Shall hear the judgment so, and none may cry
We knew not Thou wert angry. O! we are lost,
Only for lack of being warned.'

                ''But say
That He spoke not, and merely it befell
That I being weary had a dream. Why, so
He could not suffer damage; when the time
Was past, and that I threatened had not come,
Men would cry out on me, haply me kill,
For troubling their content. They would not swear,
But rather, 'Let him die; he lied to us;
Knowest if Thou didst speak or no. I leave
The matter here. If Thou wilt speak again,
I go in gladness; if Thou wilt not speak,
Nay, if Thou never didst, I not the less
Shall go, because I have believed, what time
I seemed to hear Thee, and the going stands
With memory of believing,' Then I washed,
And did array me in the sacred gown,
And take a lamb.'

          'Ay, sir,' Niloiya sighed,
'I following, and I knew not anything
Till, the young lamb asleep in thy two arms,
We, moving up among the silent hills,
Paused in a grove to rest; and many slaves
Came near to make obeisance, and to bring
Wood for the sacrifice, and turf and fire.
Then in their hearing thou didst say to me,
'Behold, I know thy good fidelity,
And theirs that are about us; they would guard
The mountain passes, if it were my will
Awhile to leave thee'; and the pygmies laughed
For joy, that thou wouldst trust inferior things;
And put their heads down, as their manner is,
To touch our feet. They laughed, but sore I wept;
Sir, I could weep now; ye did ill to go
If that was all your bidding; I had thought

Then said the son of Lamech, 'Afterward,
When I had left thee, He whom I had served
Met with me in the visions of the night,
To comfort me for that I had withdrawn
From thy dear company. He sware to me
That no man should molest thee, no, nor touch
The bordering of mine outmost field. I say,
When I obeyed, He made His matters plain.
With whom could I have left thee, but with them,
Born in thy mother's house, and bound thy slaves?'

She said, 'I love not pygmies; they are naught.'
And he, 'Who made them pygmies?' Then she pushed
Her veiling hair back from her round, soft eyes,
And answered, wondering, 'Sir, my mothers did,
Ye know it.' And he drew her near to sit
Beside him on the settle, answering, 'Ay.'
And they went on to talk as writ below,
If any one shall read:

           'Thy mother did,
And they that went before her. Thinkest thou
That they did well?'

            'They had been overcome;
And when the angered conquerors drave them out,
Behoved them find some other way to rule,—
They did but use their wits. Hath not man aye
Been cunning in dominion, among beasts
To breed for size or swiftness, or for sake
Of the white wool he loveth, at his choice?
What harm if coveting a race of men
That could but serve, they sought among their thralls,
Such as were low of stature, men and maids;
Ay, and of feeble will and quiet mind?
Did they not spend much gear to gather out
Such as I tell of, and for matching them
One with another for a thousand years?
What harm, then, if there came of it a race,
Inferior in their wits, and in their size,
And well content to serve?'

         ''What harm?' thou sayest.
My wife doth ask, 'What harm? ''

             'Your pardon, sir.
I do remember that there came one day,
When first He invented life (right old they were,
And plain, and venerable): and they said,
She sat, 'Ye do not well, you wives of men,
To match your wit against the Maker's will,
And for your benefit to lower the stamp
Of His fair image, which He set at first
Upon man's goodly frame; ye do not well
To treat his likeness even as ye treat
The bird and beast that perish.''

                  'Said they aught
To appease the ancients, or to speak them fair?'

 'How know I? 'T was a slave that told it me.
My mother was full old when I was born,
And that was in her youth. What think you, sir?
Did not the giants likewise ill?'

                  'To that
I have no answer ready. If a man,
When each one is against his fellow, rule,
Or unmolested dwell, or unreproved,
Because, for size and strength, he standeth first,
He will thereof be glad; and if he say,
'I will to wife choose me a stately maid,
And leave a goodly offspring'; 'sooth, I think,
He sinneth not; for good to him and his
He would be strong and great. Thy people's fault
Was, that for ill to others, they did plot
To make them weak and small.'

                'But yet they steal
Or take in war the strongest maids, and such
As are of highest stature; ay, and oft
They fight among themselves for that same cause.
And they are proud against the King of heaven:
They hope in course of ages they shall come
To be as strong as He.'

             The Master said,
'I will not hear thee talk thereof; my heart
Is sick for all this wicked world. Fair wife,
I am right weary. Call thy slaves to thee,
And bid that they prepare the sleeping place.
O would that I might rest! I fain would rest,
And, no more wandering, tell a thankless world
My never-heeded tale!'
          With that she called.
The moon was up, and some few stars were out,
While heavy at the heart he walked abroad
To meditate before his sleep. And yet
Niloiya pondered, 'Shall my master go?
And will my master go? What 'vaileth it,
That he doth spend himself, over the waste
A wandering, till he reach outlandish folk,
That mock his warning? O, what 'vaileth it,
That he doth lavish wealth to build yon ark,
Whereat the daughters, when they eat with me,
Laugh? O my heart! I would the Voice were stilled.
Is not he happy? Who, of all the earth,
Obeyed like to me? Have not I learned
From his dear mouth to utter seemly words,
And lay the powers my mother gave me by?
Have I made offerings to the dragon? Nay,
And I am faithful, when he leaveth me
Lonely betwixt the peak餠mountain tops
In this long valley, where no stranger foot
Can come without my will. He shall not go.
Not yet, not yet! But three days—only three—
Beside me, and a muttering on the third,
'I have heard the Voice again.' Be dull, O dull,
Mind and remembrance! Mother, ye did ill;
'T is hard unlawful knowledge not to use.
Why, O dark mother! opened ye the way?'
Yet when he entered, and did lay aside
His costly robe of sacrifice, the robe
Wherein he had been offering, ere the sun
Went down; forgetful of her mother's craft,
She lovely and submiss did mourn to him:
'Thou wilt not go,—I pray thee, do not go,
Till thou hast seen thy children.' And he said,
'I will not. I have cried, and have prevailed:
To-morrow it is given me by the Voice
Upon a four days' journey to proceed,
And follow down the river, till its waves
Are swallowed in the sand, where no flesh dwells.

''There,' quoth the Unrevealed, 'we shall meet,
And I will counsel thee; and thou shalt turn
And rest thee with the mother, and with them
She bare.' Now, therefore, when the morn appears,
Thou fairest among women, call thy slaves,
And bid them yoke the steers, and spread thy car
With robes, the choicest work of cunning hands;
Array thee in thy rich apparel, deck
Thy locks with gold; and while the hollow vale
I thread beside yon river, go thou forth
Atween the mountains to my father's house,
And let thy slaves make all obeisance due,
And take and lay an offering at his feet.
Then light, and cry to him, 'Great king, the son
Of old Methuselah, thy son hath sent
To fetch the growing maids, his children, home.''

'Sir,' quoth the woman, 'I will do this thing,
So thou keep faith with me, and yet return.
But will the Voice, think you, forbear to chide,
Nor that Unseen, who calleth, buffet thee,
And drive thee on?'
         He saith, 'It will keep faith.
Fear not. I have prevailed, for I besought,
And lovingly it answered. I shall rest,
And dwell with thee till after my three sons
Come from the chase.' She said, 'I let them forth
In fear, for they are young. Their slaves are few.
The giant elephants be cunning folk;
They lie in ambush, and will draw men on
To follow,—then will turn and tread them down.'
'Thy father's house unwisely planned,' said he,
'To drive them down upon the growing corn
Of them that were their foes; for now, behold,
They suffer while the unwieldy beasts delay
Retirement to their lands, and, meanwhile, pound
The damp, deep meadows, to a pulpy mash;
Or wallowing in the waters foul them; nay,
Tread down the banks, and let them forth to flood
Their cities; or, assailed and falling, shake
The walls, and taint the wind, ere thirty men,
Over the hairy terror piling stones
Or earth, prevail to cover it.'
                 She said,
'Husband, I have been sorry, thinking oft
I would my sons were home; but now so well
Methinks it is with me, that I am fain
To wish they might delay, for thou wilt dwell
With me till after they return, and thou
Hast set thine eyes upon them. Then,—ah, me!
I must sit joyless in my place; bereft,
As trees that suddenly have dropped their leaves,
And dark as nights that have no moon.'
                    She spake:
The hope o' the world did hearken, but reply
Made none. He left his hand on her fair locks
As she lay sobbing; and the quietness
Of night began to comfort her, the fall
Of far-off waters, and the wing餠wind
That went among the trees. The patient hand,
Moreover, that was steady, wrought with her,
Until she said, 'What wilt thou? Nay, I know.
I therefore answer what thou utterest not.
Thou lovest me well, and not for thine own will
Consentest to depart. What more? Ay, this:
I do avow that He which calleth thee,
Hath right to call; and I do swear, the Voice
Shall have no let of me, to do Its will.

'It started out as a repressed passion
All it took was some hotel action
That day there was much to be done
The day I didn't know of things to come
I was falling
Falling deep in love

He was soon the one I thought most of
I wanted two to become one
With him I always had so much fun
I truly loved him more I think
That I can type with paper and ink

Until the day that everything
All my fantasies faded away
I found out that the one I wanted as a lover
Only wanted to love another


The treacherous sands had caught our boat, 
And held it with a strong embrace 
And death at our imprisoned crew 
Was sternly looking face to face. 

With anxious hearts, but failing strength, 
We strove to push the boat from shore; 
But all in vain, for there we lay 
With bated breath and useless oar. 

Around us in a fearful storm 
The fiery hail fell thick and fast; 
And we engirded by the sand, 
Could not return the dreadful blast. 

When one arose upon whose brow 
The ardent sun had left his trace, 
A noble purpose strong and high 
Uplighting all his dusky face. 

Perchance within that fateful hour 
The wrongs of ages thronged apace; 
But with it came the glorious hope 
Of swift deliverance to his race. 

Of galling chains asunder rent, 
Of severed hearts again made one, 
Of freedom crowning all the land 
Through battles gained and victories won. 

'Some one,' our hero firmly said, 
'Must die to get us out of this;' 
Then leaped upon the strand and bared 
His bosom to the bullets' hiss. 

'But ye are soldiers, and can fight, 
May win in battles yet unfought; 
I have no offering but my life, 
And if they kill me it is nought.' 

With steady hands he grasped the boat, 
And boldly pushed it from the shore; 
Then fell by rebel bullets pierced, 
His life work grandly, nobly o'er. 

Our boat was rescued from the sands 
And launched in safety on the tide; 
But he our comrade good and grand, 
In our defence had bravely died. 

Laying on the green leaf, left and abandoned
Be a caterpillar, never easy as u thought
Hated, oppressed are common, love is rarely brought
With friends, everywhere is like home, strong without bone
Chase away negative shadow out of sacred zone

You hope to fly, discover new world heaven
Hopes given by grasshopper always make you strong

Don't u realize me, a worm look like you? 
Stop dreaming, we useless, nothing we can do'
But for caterpillar, everything possible to do

Smiled, caterpillar replied 'I'll prove to u'

Wrapped in chrysalis, carrying seed of ambition
Confidence is a key, frustration is motivation
Follow intuition, hunt for pride redemption  
Just leave out your depression.

Essential thing, find yourself, not just dreaming

Thousand miles traveled, your wound now healed
Thousands flowers to meet, million pollens to breed
No more taste bitter leaves, now got free honey as a gift
Life destiny can be changed to what u wants it to be, 
But you have to believe what you can be and what you want to be

Thanks to hater for hate instead of love
Because hate is hidden behind the love
In life composed of varies friends or foe
Respect them for perfectly play their roles

Walk past West h street
There you will see the heartbreak
Of New York.
The six thousand bag ladies
We see and all too soon forget.

This truly black mark on a rich city
Had its setting when asylums and homes, 
Were opened and the patients became
Street people, a lot of them sedated by medication they never took and never refilled.
Flooding Manhattan to Brooklyn.

Unwashed, stinking with the rotten clothes, 
They wear permanently, 
Diseased both physically and mentally, leg sores crippling them
Begging for help they so desperately need.

They are scared away from shelters due to the violence and assault
And the way they are treated, like vermin.
That is so common.
A city that sweeps them away from the tourist areas
Just before large conventions - so they do not ' bother ' anybody.

I'm tired of flogging a dead horse
The problem gets no better
And the frightening thing is, 
It could happen to all and sundry.

She was weeping when we met
Outside a party store
Where the lonely purchase their wine; 
Her boyfriend had left her behind
All sad and lost after a fight, 
Most likely, about inconsequential things.

I picked her up, half out of human kindness, 
Half to be beside a female body
Despite how red and unhappy her face.
She was a beautiful girl in a simple way, 
She wore a plain flowery dress
With some charming appeal I can’t explain.

She tried to express in broken sentences
Why she and her boyfriend were upset; 
I mostly heard tears and my boyfriend this, 
My boyfriend that, 
I tried to act like it was as completely earth shattering
As she thought it was.

She gave me directions to where she lived, 
I drove diligently toward that destination 
Without any attempts to prolong the drive
While I planned out my own strategy of a pass.

When I finally arrived at her place, 
Her face was still red but the tears had dried.
She said, "Thanks, mister, you’re a nice guy."
She got a little closer to me and touched my hand.
I thought she might kiss me, I thought I might kiss her, 
But she scooted on out and made for her house.
I wasn’t expecting any action that night, 
I can’t claim disappointment.

But I wish I knew if I should pray 
For her and her boyfriend to work things out. 

An innocent boy leaving the lap of mother
opened his fearful eyes in the war-trodden world 
and asked in a depressed voice, 'Where have I come? '
I told him the name of the earth.

The boy looked at the corners of the earth
and with wonder and pain, seeing the towns and paths
full of corpses and heart-rending bloods
further asked, 
'Will you tell me how man lives in this hell? '

I said to him, 'Oh, it's a shame! 
Where is man in this hell?

The one
who is supposed to 
give me justice has 
amazingly declared her heart 
as a court, 
she herself as a judge to hear, 
her brain as a lawyer to plea, 
herself witnesses to prove, 
even then 
her decisions are also based on 
the rules and regulations 
mentioned in the black book of law, 
she constructed herself 
as per her own willingness too. 



Claimed 
Answers for the world's ills 
A way to peace
Each different in behavior
Saint Frances
Mussolini
Churchill 
Hitler
Their idealism often reborn
in others. 
Upon their forehead 
I viewed a sign for peace
A strange peace. 
Appearing, 
In the creases of
the Europeans forehead
but
based on commercial smiles.



  Bodies yet lose the weight, 
  reaching a strange  state 
  when you find your soulmate, and one thought
  two minds celebrate.

'The bitterness of life! '

I am done with all this
No more pain & sorrow
Just walk away, say goodbye
Please don't come back tomorrow


Like a toddler taking maiden steps
The narrow stream moves through the woods
Tripping and falling over pebbles and boulders
Chiming its silver anklets

Forcing itself in irrepressible flow
It thrusts and shoves its way down
Through thickets and a line of ferns
And the tangle of creepers and thorny brambles

Drowning the whisper of bamboo leaves
Its sweet murmur falls in my ears
As an eternal living melody
The cosmic song heard over eons

As the water sluices down the rocks
It becomes a frothing braided torrent
Producing a harsh grating roar
Like the crescendo of a tribal symphony

There it forms into a small pool
With its waves gently rippling
Where birds merrily coming to take a dip
And sunning their feathers, fly back refreshed

Sometimes travelling unseen
It suddenly emerges into the open
Cutting its way through cracks and fissures
Never willing to surrender before hurdles

With a bearing immaculate in grace
It sends out waves of pure delight
What joy it is to watch the dilly dally
Of this sedate pilgrim moving to its destination


Here, where the thoroughfares meet at an angle
Of ninety degrees (this angle is right),
You may hear the loafers that jest and wrangle
Through the sun-lit day and the lamp-lit night;
Though day be dreary and night be wet,
You will find a ceaseless concourse met;
Their laughter resounds and their Fife tongues jangle,
And now and again their Fife fists fight.

Often here the voice of the crier
Heralds a sale in the City Hall,
And slowly but surely drawing nigher
Is heard the baker's bugle call.
The baker halts where the two ways meet,
And the blast, though loud, is far from sweet
That with breath of bellows and heart of fire
He blows, till the echoes leap from the wall.

And on Saturday night just after eleven,
When the taverns have closed a moment ago,
The vocal efforts of six or seven
Make the corner a place of woe.
For the time is fitful, the notes are queer,
And it sounds to him who dwelleth near
Like the wailing for cats in a feline heaven
By orphan cats who are left below.

Wherefore, O Bejant, Son of the Morning,
Fresh as a daisy dipt in the dew,
Hearken to me and receive my warning:
Though rents be heavy, and bunks be few
And most of them troubled with rat or mouse,
Never take rooms in a corner house;
Or sackcloth and ashes and sad self-scorning
Shall be for a portion unto you. 

Detroit is a mess, eighteen billion in debt
But you can't stop a loser from a double down bet.
The transit she has runs deep in the red
Half her acreage is vacant and her tax base has fled.
So now they plan a streetcar, the M-light rail
They boldly go forward with a plan doomed to fail.
Detroit's busted budget is out of control
Their schools are the worst, Half the town's on the dole.
But if we build a streetcar then all will be well? 
More cash down the rat hole! Don't ask and don't tell.
Three billion dollars it's projected to cost-
half for the rail line and half for the Boss. 

She stood on the corner
Of Life and Pain
Trying hard to ignore
The driving rain

Her life was a shambles
Her life was a wreck
She subconsciously rubbed
The gold chain on her neck

She wore red stilettos
She wore a short dress
How in hell had she fallen
Into this sad mess

She was trying her best
To do what was right
She had two kids at home
On the wretched wet night

Her angels, her babies
Her pride and her joy
No father in sight
For her girl and her boy

She left them with sitters
She left them alone
They knew how to find her
By only cell phone

She had bills to pay
And mouths to feed
Her life on the street
Was not due to greed

She hated herself
Hated what she was doing
Wrestled her conscience
And kept right on going

As she strolled back and forth
On the corner that night
She began to think
She was losing the fight

Not many cars out
For a Friday night
But soon a blue Camry
Pulled into sight

The window rolled down
Her head started to throb.
'How much, Love. 
For a little Blow Job? '

To be continued. 

By Dee Daffodil  June rills and where flowers abound
Humming birds to buzz around.
Busy the crawlys on the ground
And creepies too on their round

Wicker basket hung on a tree
Around it whirs a bumble bee
Draw your neck an a beauty see
Forget-me-nots, a splendor wee

Skulk in shadows, bunch of goons
Iron-wrought an old festoons
Atop those ones, a couple croons
Parting lovers in their swoons

Here a cascade of fuchsias bloom
By the side of the keepers room
In gentle breeze dandelions loom
Lend to the air their fluffy plume

On the cobbles little girls frisk
By their side a historic obelisk
Along that path a Victorian disc
The one in Bermudas on his brisk

Splendor of flowing fountains gush
Call of the cuckoo breaks the hush
Wafting warble of a shiny thrush
Ah the couple, her cheeks are blush

Eldery lady with her stash of tome
Elfin eared, naughty little gnome
Smattering of people out of home
Dash of people with pooches roam

Silvery water in beaten streams
Mosses cling to their stony seams
A car reflects and sometime gleams
Ah! an the couple, in their dreams

(May It is late afternoon
this first day of winter -
electric cold and amber warm.
Long shadows dapple 
and the light twinkles.

It is your morning, 
your first of summer morning, 
your birthday morning - 
dear Tara Mc


Hale.

Your compassion and tenderness
have lifted my spirit
time and time again.

Your pain and tears
have touched me
beyond words.

Your poems
reveal your life -
with honesty and charm.

Your comments
seduce without flattery
and inspire me to write.

Your hundreds of messages
are always 'interesting'
and often make my day.

The last year's soap opera
has challenged you -
demanded monumental courage

and patience from you, 
but now you've turned the corner
and sweet love beckons. 

Dear Tara, 
poet princess, 
spiritual child, 

There is a depth
Unexplored and mysterious
In your blue eyes
Where in I often
Dive to feel the warmth of
Love after many tries

There is a silence
Untainted and unrivaled
In your young soul
Where to I return
To see dreams of love
Taking long stroll

And it occurred to me that no
Better or more reliable friend 
Could one ever find! 

Yesterday is a faded memory
For each day is brand new
And I know today is no exception
My Father has new things for me to do

Thank you Father for another day
And teach me now what role 
For you this day I shall play

Plant my feet in the area of need as 
You and I take our daily stroll
In your garden of love 

But first cleanse me of my sins
And wash me as white as the 
Wings of a snow white dove

Prepare my heart and my mind too
For all the glorious things you 
Will for me to do

Then when my work this day is done
Arrange my thoughts to focus 
Even more upon your only Son

Let me not close my eyes in sleep
Until I go to you in prayer 
Being right beside me
For you have always been 
Right there
protect yourself day and night.

he proposed I couldn't believe it. 
'Could this happen to me? '
I'm a bride come and see! 
he let me invite my friends. 
They were happy, a bit envious.  
I was in heaven for a whole year. 
In the second, his love began to wear. 
Out with a diminishing might. 
Where did I go wrong? 
Could he be right? 
Why is he complaining?  
Why is he demeaning?  
What could be ailing him? 
Am the one carrying a child not him. 
I am not feeling good.
Is this how pregnancy progressed? 
I am sickly all the time. 
Can't confide in him not right time.
'Is it mine or one of your customers? ' 
Why all these accusations? 
'You do trust me you said you did.
why are you torturing me, my beloved? ' 
I stopped contacting my friends. 
To please to be in his good grace.  
His jealousy got stronger. 
Am scared to be seen with him yonder.  
I reminded myself regularly. 
He changed my life dramatically. 
Made me his wife defying society.
In the meantime, am in deep trouble. 
I can't go on am not able. 
I delivered untimely baby weighing right. 
Why did he rush to come out? 
Leaving two siblings behind. 
They couldn't face the world.
Husband or not I will strive. 
Here I go supported by neighbors.
Looking after baby just like theirs. 
Started getting money washing clothes.
Working hard for seven days. 
Learned about my man.
He's married with children. 
Why did he save me from that dark life? 
What was missing in his wife

A strong woman works out every day, 
Pride in her appearance she portrays, 
But a woman of strength kneels to pray, 

A strong woman claims she isn't afraid of anything, 
Looking forward to challenges each day will bring, 
Women of strength show courage in the midst of fear, 

Strong women won't let anyone get the best of them, 
So skilled in defenses even if they have to pretend, 
Yet a woman of strength gives her best to everyone, 
And even on a cloud filled day still bright as the sun. 

A strong woman relies on the physical attributes making her tough, 
In her search for power and money she will never have enough, 
A woman of strength understands that it's not about material stuff, 
Knowing that before becoming a diamond first she'll be in the rough. 

A strong woman sometimes disguises her feelings shadowed by clouds, 
Unhinged when challenged on her policy becoming boisterous and loud, 
A woman of strength concerns herself not with judgment from others, 
And will not let business interfere with commitments as a wife and mother. 

A strong woman is easily impatient back and forth she will begin to pace, 
Counting on her holier than thou attitude instead of depending on faith, 
And at the Creator's appointed time she'll receive all that is justly due. 

A strong woman makes mistakes and avoids the same for tomorrow, 
The woman of strength realizes life's mistakes no matter how slim, 

A strong woman walks head first with no doubt in her mind, 
No matter what, she'll not make this mistake a second time, 
So when a situation arises again, she's not afraid to answer the call. 

A strong woman wears the look of confidence on her face, 
Always doing whatever it takes to finish, seeking only first place, 
The woman of strength competes with an emotional sense of grace, 
Understanding it's more important to run a Holy Spirit filled race. 

A strong woman has faith that for the journey she'll have enough, 
No matter how uneven the terrain or roads being rocky and rough, 
A woman of strength knows it's in the journey she will become strong, 

A strong woman when uninformed thinks that she is being mistreated, 
In the end her physical attributes fail causing doubt to become seeded, 
A woman of strength will compromise as a little give and take is needed, 
Why? Because a lesson not learned the first time is soon to be repeated. 

Ladies start everyday on your knees with supplication & prayer, 
And should your giant steps seem to be moving only inch by inch, 
The journey is not as A Strong Woman but A Woman Of Strength. 

Realize his-story is not the preverbal or only meaning of the word history, 
Read the poem titled, 'Women Preachers & Pastors In The Ministry? ' 
This male chauvinistic attitude's deceitfully titled, 'The Same Old Song, ' 
No wonder society thinks a woman can't compete & this is totally wrong. 

Difference between farther & further,is distance,is to understand, 
Where Motherhood is instinctive however it has to be learned by man, 
A woman carries a life form up to & maybe more than months long, 
Man can't stand to be with a crying for baby hours and he is strong? 

It is thousands of years later, man still cries, 'first the woman was deceived, '
It always happens that when things go wrong we are quick to pass the blame? 
Sin didn't manifest till Adam ate the fruit as well but he put it on Eve's name.

Every woman is a catalyst for any little girl to become the same, 
So the question is what will be the consequences from her name? 
Strong relays an outward appearance yet under pressure it cracks, 
And only through strength will she be able to withstand the attack.

Girls beware, because the road traveled is both winding and long, 
And for this very reason you will surely have to more than strong, 
This should inform you that an arduous trek is measured in length, 
The main reason it takes intestinal fortitude only found in strength.

Now for an excellent example relaying exactly what we mean, 
The United States Marine Corps, 'Female Engagement Team, '
Women in Afghanistan not in rear support yet on the front line, 
Not so much physically strong as through strength in the mind.

Isn't it amazing disciples from miraculous powers were big and strong, 
Yet two Mary's and Salome the weaker sex faithfully stood by at length, 
Face to face with adversity you will only pass through fire with strength.

Blacks sat in the back of the bus for years although it was wrong, 
Now imagine how many men complied who were big and Strong, 
But, it was a female, Rosa Parks, who would not budge one inch, 
Yet another example of what it means for women to have Strength.

Certain things capture your eye but pursue only those that capture the heart, 
Although an, 'Ancient Indian Proverb' yet Solomon gave the verse its start, 
Likewise, don't seek after frivols material things that only make you Strong, 
For Strength is the seed of eternal roots to remain even after you're gone.

The association of motherhood is something truly unique, 
And only through inner Strength can you reach your peak, 
As the Strongest will tire from repetitions they must repeat, 
Because the latter without proper rest is destined to be weak.

Imagine how tough women have to be not just bearing and raising their child, 
While at the same time many have to control their spouse from running wild, 
A single or married mom with a tight knit family that's united for any length, 
Not so much from a Strong Woman as it is through, 'A Woman Of Strength.'
 
With all the aforementioned qualifications it is a mystery, 
Why many believe women should not preach in the ministry, 
Birth, feed, raise, clothe and impact men with knowledge, 
Of a multitude of wisdom they'll never receive in college.

This poetic tribute is a, 'Shout-Out' to any woman everywhere, 
Seemingly impossible circumstances faced head on the scare, 
By the armor of faith fear of the unknown shall not make a dent, 
They are withstanding not by outward Strong but inner Strength.

I.

Now no more the slanting rays
With the mountain summits dally,
Now no more in crimson blaze
Evening’s fleecy cloudless rally,
Soon shall Night front off the valley
Sweep that bright yet earthly haze,
And the stars most musically
Move in endless rounds of praise.


II.

While the world is growing dim,
And the Sun is slow descending
Past the far horizon’s rim,
Earth's low sky to heaven extending,
Let my feeble earth-notes, blending
With the songs of cherubim,
Through the same expanse ascending,
Thus renew my evening hymn.


III.

Thou that fill’st our waiting eyes
With the food of contemplation,
Setting in thy darkened skies
Signs of infinite creation,
Grant to nightly meditation
What the toilsome day denies—
Teach me in this earthly station
Heavenly Truth to realise.


IV.

Give me wisdom so to use
These brief hours of thoughtful leisure,
That I may no instant lose
In mere meditative pleasure,
But with strictest justice measure
All the ends my life pursues,
Lies to crush and truths to treasure,
Wrong to shun and Right to choose.


V.

Then, when unexpected Sleep,
O’er my long-closed eyelids stealing,
Opens up that lower deep
Where Existence has no feeling,
May sweet Calm, my languor healing,
Lend note strength at dawn to reap
All that Shadows, world-concealing,
For the bold enquirer keep.


VI.

Through the creatures Thou hast made
Show the brightness of Thy glory,
Be eternal Truth displayed
In their substance transitory,
Till green Earth and Ocean hoary,
Massy rock and tender blade
Tell the same unending story—
"We are Truth in Form arrayed



VII.

When to study I retire,
And from books of ancient sages
Glean fresh sparks of buried fire
Lurking in their ample pages—
While the task my mind engages
Let old words new truths inspire-—
Truths that to all after-ages
Prompt the Thoughts that never tire.


VIII.

Yet if, led by shadows fair
I have uttered words of folly,
Let the kind absorbing air
Stifle every sound unholy.
So when Saints with Angels lowly
Join in heaven’s unceasing prayer,
Mine as certainly, though slowly,
May ascend and mingle there.


IX.

Teach me so Thy works to read
That my faith,—new strength accruing,—
May from world to world proceed,
Wisdom's fruitful search pursuing;
Till, thy truth my mind imbuing,
I proclaim the Eternal Creed,
Oft the glorious theme renewing


X.

Give me love aright to trace
Thine to everything created,
Preaching to a ransomed race
By Thy mercy renovated,
Till with all thy fulness sated
I behold thee face to face
And with Ardour unabated
Sing the glories of thy grace. 

Many born with me have no source
To pursue education with resource
Which I am blessed thanks to my parents
Who sacrifice all their money and comforts
To make me well read with quality
So that I may serve them and society! 

Help me concentrate on my goal
In all sincerity with my heart and soul! 
Knowledge is precious wisdom more
That help me locate what is core
In life with the guidance of my Master
Whom I revere as your Messenger

I see light years ahead
My struggles, I see the payoff-
Not in prices of lands of corn fields
Or in stacks of gold and trinkets
Or in cars rolling on s 
Yet, I see the payoff

I see the payoff to the endless calculus
The monstrous homework of these "evil" professors
And the evil exams that ages one quick
An impecunious student and his trademark backpack
Yet daily he returns, to that which torments his mind
Knowledge he seeks, victory will surely be his 

I feel the sweat daily wash down the face
It hides neither the wrinkles nor the strain
Or the endless agony of many sleepless night
Waking up in the morning and saying to self
"It is o'clock and I am behind again"

The sun is up over my window
Not that I see its wonders or its radiance 
Or its beautiful glow over the land at day
But to self I ponder and rightly so
"Why can't the night go any bit longer? "
I hit the snooze and now the danger
Of missing the bus and my morning class

I see light years ahead oh sure I do
Of these marriage we share, oh sure I do -
Through the misty dew and dense fog
And the not so friendly winter laden sky of the mid-west
I see the wind; push the trees from side to side
And the hats that fly "bye bye" with the winds from the south
Yet to school I go and brave the elements

I am with you and you with me
I seek no other for there is no other
The only way that I know to entertain life is with you
Books for breakfast
Library for lunch
Study for dinner
My menu you assigned to me and I accept it as so
This struggle is with a purpose
And that's the call I answer this day
To go on out there and do great things


She stands as pale as Parian statues stand; 
Like Cleopatra when she turned at bay, 
And felt her strength above the Roman sway, 
And felt the aspic writhing in her hand. 
Her face is steadfast toward the shadowy land, 
For dim beyond it looms the light of day; 
Her feet are steadfast; all the arduous way 
That foot-track hath not wavered on the sand. 
She stands there like a beacon thro' the night, 
A pale clear beacon where the storm-drift is; 
She stands alone, a wonder deathly white; 
She stands there patient, nerved with inner might, 
Indomitable in her feebleness, 
Her face and will athirst against the light. 

To be a great musician you must be a man of moods,
You have to be, to understand sonatas and etudes.
To execute pianos and to fiddle with success,
With sympathy and feeling you must fairly effervesce;
It was so with Paganini, Remenzi and Cho-pang,
And so it was with Peterkin Von Gabriel O’Lang.

Monsieur O’Lang had sympathy to such a great degree.
No virtuoso ever lived was quite so great as he;
He was either very happy or very, very sad;
He was always feeling heavenly or oppositely bad;
In fact, so sympathetic that he either must enthuse
Or have the dumps; feel ecstacy or flounder in the blues.

So all agreed that Peterkin Von Gabriel O’Lang
Was the greatest violinist in the virtuoso gang.
The ladies bought his photographs and put them on the shelves
In the place of greatest honor, right beside those of themselves;
They gladly gave ten dollars for a stiff backed parquette chair.
And sat in mouth-wide happiness a-looking at his hair.

I say 'a looking at his hair,' I mean just what I say,
For no one ever had a chance to hear P. O’Lang play;
So subtle was his sympathy, so highly strung was he,
His moods were barometric to the very last degree;
The slightest change of weather would react upon his brain,
And fill his soul with joyousness or murder it with pain.

And when his soul was troubled he had not the heart to play.
But let his head droop sadly down in such a soulful way,
That every one that saw him declared it was worth twice
(And some there were said three times) the large admission price;
And all were quite unanimous and said it would be crude
For such a man to fiddle when he wasn’t in the mood.

But when his soul was filled with joy he tossed his flowing hair
And waved his violin-bow in great circles in the air;
Ecstaticly he flourished it, for so his spirit thrilled,
Thus only could he show the joy with which his heart was filled;
And so he waved it up and down and ’round and out and in,—
But he never, never, NEVER touched it to his violin

You are a study in physics
A magnetic reality
Charged to love me 
against my will

Do I feel you in the night? 
Sleeping softly, reaching out to touch
Your face
Gentle in slumber

Do I feel the force of your gaze? 
As if you sit just inches from my face
Breathing a common breath
Fusing into mine

You transform my universe naturally, 
Loving me beyond the boundary of geography
And you are my reality now
Near or 
even far away

Do I hear your thoughts? 
Aloud, whispered or imagined
I know your words before they take shape
and form
To express our singular version of love 

Do I feel your touch? 
Bursts of energy 
transmitted tenderly through your hands
Electrifying every nerve ending in my 
Welcoming body

You are a study in physics
Transcending space, transferring matter and making love. 

A Study in Scarlett

A wistful sadness in your eyes
Says all you need to say..
Your heart desires privacy
Now that love has gone away.

A legendary beauty-
A star of screen and stage
You’ve always been before us
since a young and tender age.

Mother Nature was most generous-
Most think you live in clover-
Blonde hair, blue eyes,  the perfect skin
And cups that runneth over.

Life can serve up curves besides
The curves you proudly own.
To make you think, like Garbo, 
that you want to be alone.

True, there will be other loves
and other roles to play.
Today you act the stoic
Now that love has gone away


He turned to me with his kind, sleepy gaze 
And fresh face slowly brightening to the grin 
That sets my memory back to summer days, 
With twenty runs to make, and last man in. 
He told me he’d been having a bloody time
In trenches, crouching for the crumps to burst, 
While squeaking rats scampered across the slime 
And the grey palsied weather did its worst. 

But as he stamped and shivered in the rain, 
My stale philosophies had served him well;
Dreaming about his girl had sent his brain 
Blanker than ever—she’d no place in Hell. . 
Wondering ‘why he always talked such tripe’. 

War can break your bones
But women 
Can break your hearts
Would you rather me tell
Of serpents than love
Those sitting opposite you
A new face every few blinks
Of your long lashes
Seem just as fortunate
As the bed that cradles you
Gently like their arms
Were it me 
You’d feel the tremble
Of my heart
Set off by so little
Like your presence 
To others I am wisdom
To you I seem folly
I am never as I expect to be
Because of you
But I would endure it
Being broken-hearted and foolish
Because of love
For you
Greater than any battle
Any campaign
More heart breaking than death
A war
A serpent
In my heat
A subtle blaze
For you


Of late, and from early, 
I learn more and more
of less and less; 
how a little
means a lot, and
a lot means little.
How the sky
born of nature
mingles with eternity, 
not quite here, 
not quite there; 
birds move through
a motionless air
like grace
the trees, burnt orange
stand resolute, 
fired in falls
glorious furnace; 
leaves skate downward and around, 
in and out of the veil
covering a mysterious majesty.

Where was I before
and saw
what I now, 
barely again, begin
to see? 
When did I leave it all? 
And when
have I returned? 
How? - -
Leaving the leaving, now
I see, 
This, all, was always
coming to me, 
and I
to It. 

OTHERS may laugh at my feeble endeavor
To capture life's prizes, and others may sneer;
The whole world may loudly declare I shall never
Be worthy the gunpowder to blow me from here. 
It may be I 'm punk as a parlor reciter,
And when I begin grown-ups take to the woods; 
But that baby of mine! I can always delight her, 
She vows I 'm a wonder, she swears I 'm the goods.

It may be I can't keep a tune for a minute,
It may be my voice wanders far from the key; 
It may be the nightingale, lark and the linnet
As songsters have quite a wide margin on me. 
Caruso and others may take down the money
For singing their ditties to high-brows, but I 
Have one little audience, cheerful and sunny,
Who 'd rather hear me than the music you buy.

She thinks I 'm a corker, a lalapaloosa,
She nightly applauds every stunt that I do; 
She 'd rather hear me than your John Philip Sousa,
To her the old nonsense forever is new. 
That baby of mine thinks I 'm great in whatever
I tackle, the moment we've finished our tea; 
And though others may laugh at my feeble endeavor,
The praise of my little one satisfies me.

And so though the big world goes by me unheeding,
And never a grown-up takes notice of me; 
Though into my work failure others are reading,
I 'm still a success to the babe on my knee. 
When worn out and weary, my long day is ended,
And homeward I turn, I forget my distress; 
For I know that my baby still thinks I am splendid,
To her, anyhow, I 'm a corking success

In the heart of heartless desert
In the society of dark deformed
He came to bring heart
And to remove dark deformed, 

He was able to form
An exploitingless society
With multiraces and tastes
Worldly and spiritual gaining base, 

Successful one he was
Establishing a state without chaos
And the enlightened way to go
For nation after nation to follow.



Muzahidul Reza
Being attracted to beauty, playing hides and seeks, 
Waiting for hours on the road opposite to a bedroom, 
On the first floor just to have a glimpse of a teen aged girl, 
Chasing that girl on a bicycle up to a girls college, 
Where one could not get in and waiting for her, 
Outside the college till the bells announced, 
She’s about to come out and then chasing once again, 
Until she got in the gates of her lovely home! 
Regretted holidays for missing the routine! 

What is it, foolishness or an adventure? 
Is it merely a call of nature? 
It might be foolishness but when responded, 
By the eyes of a sweet and lovely nice girl, 
An element enters in this wild foolishness, 
An element that softens the stones of hearts, 
And the adventure when blended by love, 
What else it is, other than romance, 
What a life is that without a romance! 
A duty imposed for just to reproduce! 

Stealing a moment to meet somewhere outside, 
Be a windy evening of a hot summer noon, 
Or a sunny noon of a cold foggy morning, 
A moonlit night on the bank of a river, 
In the pleasant rains with roses and jasmines, 
To be wet in love and to come back in senses, 
Before t’s too much with the dreams of future, 
Gripping and controlling the call of nature, 
Without all that the life remains incomplete, 
Sweet memories we need in the icy old age! 

Bitter realities of life when kill the adventure, 
Adventure goes in coma but love never dies, 
Understanding each other, accepting each other, 
With the weaknesses exposed after marriage, 
Changes the nature of love completely, 
Compromises are made, sacrifices are made, 
When a wife takes care of his childish husband, 
She behaves like a stern but loving grandmother, 
But the child is not annoyed at all, 
He enjoys a carefree lovely nice life, 
Ignoring a few painful casual strife, 
Three cheers for a beautiful lovely nice wife

From winter freeze
To summer heat
The fire still rages
Am I captured by love? 
Keys to her heart 

Will not open
But open for others! 
Sweet thoughts comes to light
Throughout the night

When dawn comes near
My mind will clear
While reality creeps back


She will not be my flower in bed! 
Since she is a loyal angel
Clouds of hatred cover my heart


Because she will never be mine! 
But her thoughts always float on my mind
Cupid send me the bloody keys to her heart! 


Time flows whiles ashes blows
Through summer heat
To winter frezee
Still the fire burns inside



All rights E. 

Desir Sept ain beats down on the window pane
As the flood gates of Heaven suddenly open
It is pouring out in torrential flow
Like a Reservoir, all at once, broken

It has come down as a welcome respite
To fan away the humid sweltering heat
It falls in drops and flows in rivulets
Washing the dust of summer drought

With a sudden burst from the weight laden clouds
It lashes down in steam and fury
Plummeting to form ripples in puddles
And filling pools and ponds in hurry

In slanting sheets, it almost pounds
Flooding roads and making puddle
Gushing through pipes and rushing down drains
Water floods, causing men to waddle

Rain has its abode in heavens so high
And hides behind clouds of mournful gloom
In silver strings, it spans the Earth 
And cleanses the plants in resplendent gleam

Sudden is the wind, coming to shoo away the clouds
And the sky is once more cerulean blue
As the music stops and the humdrum stills
The water seeps, giving no evident clue.

After an angry couple's furious fight, 
 As the house goes back to an uncanny calm, 
The rain has vanished, leaving little trace
Cooling the Earth and causing no harm


Barefooted boys scud up the street
Or skurry under sheltering sheds;
And schoolgirl faces, pale and sweet,
Gleam from the shawls about their heads.

Doors bang; and mother-voices call
From alien homes; and rusty gates
Are slammed; and high above it all,
The thunder grim reverberates.

And then, abrupt,--the rain! the rain!--
The earth lies gasping; and the eyes
Behind the streaming window-pane
Smile at the trouble of the skies.

The highway smokes; sharp echoes ring;
The cattle bawl and cowbells clank;
And into town comes galloping
The farmer's horse, with streaming flank.

The swallow dips beneath the eaves,
And flirts his plumes and folds his wings;
And under the catawba leaves
The caterpillar curls and clings.

The bumble-bee is pelted down
The wet stem of the hollyhock;
And sullenly, in spattered brown,
The cricket leaps the garden walk.

Within, the baby claps his hands
And crows with rapture strange and vague;
Without, beneath the rosebush stands
A dripping rooster on one leg. 

The blinding light 
Of the brightest ever sun
Suddenly shrouded
By a thick pall of impenetrable darkness.
 
A strange silence engulfs.
 
A sudden chill creeps in; 
The wind begins to blow
Gently-wildly-ferociously, 
Forming a dense screen of dust.
 
The wind gains momentum.
 
It sucks the dry leaves 
Up towards the sky, 
A greedy funnel forms; 
The trees sashay to the rhythm.
 
The wind begins to howl.
 
A roaring thunder roars, 
Alarms the mighty earth, 
Rips it off its grave silence, 
And shoves it into utter chaos.
 
A frightening darkness befalls.
 
Now, I can hear the sky
Shrieking with pain;         
Thunder-bolt and lightening, 
Now it breaks into rain.
 
A heavenly downpour. 
 
The anger subsides; 
Tears begin to flow; 
Nature reconciles.
 
A cool breeze gently blows. 

A curious sun peeps, 
Spreading a bright smile; 
Darkness evaporates.

The landscape dazzles again.

Styles are different but enjoyed by all.
What of children and youths the message of rains, 
Has been read by all with no refrains! 

Children are playing in the river on streets, 
Grandmothers in kitchen for the tasty treats, 
Running wildly and pushing their mates, 
Innocent friendship that is free of hates, 
In the muddy water that is flowing on the ground, 
In water, muddy water, I see all around, 
I see many boats of colorful papers, 
Floating with boats the plastic wrappers, 
A few are playing water ball in the rain, 
Slipping and moaning but standing once again, 
Street dogs running and barking in fun, 
What an exciting romance sudden rains have spun.

Clouds have locked the sun for a day, 
Dropping honey of love on the thirsty clay, 
Sun sends cold winds to disperse the clouds, 
The policemen failed to disperse the crowds, 
Instead it attracted many bold and colorful females, 
One followed by at least ten loving males.

The couples got a chance of loving in the day, 
How helpless in love is excited clay.
Let them love and love and don't disturb, 
The days of youth are few but superb! 
Why don't you listen to the call of romance? 
Why don't you sing, why don't you dance? 
With a message of love the rains have come back, 
A sick and shy is still off track, 
He is dancing on the roof he is wild like the cloud, 
Listen to the song he is singing so loud.

The old man busy in writing a poem, 
Recollecting his memories of the past childhood, 
Smiling on the days of lost youth-hood, 
Imprisoned helplessly in the time's iron cage, 
Still enjoying the sudden rain fall, 
His heart is free not not in a cage at all! 

In a hot blanket this crooning is futile, 
Get up sweetheart with the old style, 
Wear pink and green the lovely contrast, 
Climb on the roof and call back the past, 
Let us join the youths let us sing and dance, 
It's a weather of romance, only romance

IF you've grumbled through the day 
Without driving care away, 
If in spite of all your grouches 
Troubles on you have kept piling; 
If regardless of your kicking 
And your cussing, they're still sticking, 
Why not switch your tactics, mister, 
And try smiling? 

If your frowning will not chase 'em, 
Why not grin a bit, and face 'em? 
If your worries seem to like it 
When your meanness they are riling; 
If your gloomy disposition 
Doesn't better your condition, 
Why not switch your methods, mister, 
And try smiling? 

If your constant whining, swearing, 
Do not better your wayfaring; 
If you find your foes no kinder 
After them you've been reviling; 
If they keep right on assailing, 
Quite regardless of your wailing, 
Why not switch your style of warfare 
And try smiling.


'I'll make you one,' he said, 'and balance it
Perfectly on you.' So I could almost feel
The plumb line of the creased tweed hit my heel,

My shoulders like a spar or arms of a scale
Under the jacket, my whole shape realigned
In ways that suited me down to the ground.

So Although a suit was the last thing that I needed
I weighed his words and wore them and decided 
There and then it was going for a song. 

I quietly walk immense, lonely streets
And think of a sullen girl
Whose eyes were always
Watery and sad, 
Even in the absence of tears.
I recall once having held her hand
In the sunlight amid yellow flowers
And wanting to whisper something to her
That would make her smile
And forget her tragic soul
For a fleeting moment.

Some girls dress in black
And you can’t reach them with romance, 
But you fall in love with them nonetheless; 
The poetry of their melancholy eyes
Slips into your psyche
Like a recurring childhood dream.

She eventually gets lost somewhere
And drifts away, she finds it impossible to linger
With one man and be understood.
You think, perhaps this is best, 
She’s not for you, 
But your life becomes morose, 
Her disconsolate mood has infected you
And you begin to view the world
Through the same saturnine eyes.

In your solitude, you question why
The two of you could not remain
Unhappy together

A languid atmosphere, a lazy breeze,
With labored respiration, moves the wheat
From distant reaches, till the golden seas
Break in crisp whispers at my feet.

My book, neglected of an idle mind,
Hides for a moment from the eyes of men;
Or lightly opened by a critic wind,
Affrightedly reviews itself again.

Off through the haze that dances in the shine
The warm sun showers in the open glade,
The forest lies, a silhouette design
Dimmed through and through with shade.

A dreamy day; and tranquilly I lie
At anchor from all storms of mental strain;
With absent vision, gazing at the sky,
"Like one that hears it rain


The Katydid, so boisterous last night,
Clinging, inverted, in uneasy poise,
Beneath a wheat-blade, has forgotten quite
If "Katy DID or DIDN'T" make a noise.

The twitter, sometimes, of a wayward bird
That checks the song abruptly at the sound,
And mildly, chiding echoes that have stirred,
Sink into silence, all the more profound.

And drowsily I hear the plaintive strain
Of some poor dove . . . Why, I can scarcely keep
My heavy eyelids--there it is again--
"Coo-coo!"--I mustn't--"Coo-coo!"--fall asleep

I 

The dawn laughs out on orient hills 
And dances with the diamond rills; 
The ambrosial wind but faintly stirs 
The silken, beaded gossamers; 
In the wide valleys, lone and fair, 
Lyrics are piped from limpid air, 
And, far above, the pine trees free 
Voice ancient lore of sky and sea. 
Come, let us fill our hearts straightway 
With hope and courage of the day. 


II 

Noon, hiving sweets of sun and flower, 
Has fallen on dreams in wayside bower, 
Where bees hold honeyed fellowship 
With the ripe blossom of her lip; 
All silent are her poppied vales 
And all her long Arcadian dales, 
Where idleness is gathered up 
A magic draught in summer's cup. 
Come, let us give ourselves to dreams 
By lisping margins of her streams. 


III 

Adown the golden sunset way 
The evening comes in wimple gray; 
By burnished shore and silver lake 
Cool winds of ministration wake; 
O'er occidental meadows far 
There shines the light of moon and star, 
And sweet, low-tinkling music rings 
About the lips of haunted springs. 
In quietude of earth and air 
'Tis meet we yield our souls to prayer. 

The sun is set; and in his latest beams
Yon little cloud of ashen gray and gold,
Slowly upon the amber air unrolled,
The falling mantle of the Prophet seems.
From the dim headlands many a light-house gleams,
The street-lamps of the ocean; and behold,
O'erhead the banners of the night unfold;
The day hath passed into the land of dreams.
O summer day beside the joyous sea!
O summer day so wonderful and white,
So full of gladness and so full of pain!
Forever and forever shalt thou be
To some the gravestone of a dead delight,
To some the landmark of a new domain. 

THE wind has swept from the wide atmosphere
          Each vapour that obscured the sunset's ray,
     And pallid Evening twines its beaming hair
In duskier braids around the languid eyes of Day:
     Silence and Twilight, unbeloved of men,
     Creep hand in hand from yon obscurest glen.

     They breathe their spells towards the departing day,
          Encompassing the earth, air, stars, and sea;
     Light, sound, and motion, own the potent sway,
Responding to the charm with its own mystery.
     The winds are still, or the dry church-tower grass
     Knows not their gentle motions as they pass.

     Thou too, aerial pile, whose pinnacles
          Point from one shrine like pyramids of fire,
     Obey'st I in silence their sweet solemn spells,
Clothing in hues of heaven thy dim and distant spire,
     Around whose lessening and invisible height
     Gather among the stars the clouds of night.

     The dead are sleeping in their sepulchres:
          And, mouldering as they sleep, a thrilling sound,
     Half sense half thought, among the darkness stirs,
Breathed from their wormy beds all living things around,
     And, mingling with the still night and mute sky,
     Its awful hush is felt inaudibly.

     Thus solemnized and softened, death is mild
          And terrorless as this serenest night.
     Here could I hope, like some enquiring child
Sporting on graves, that death did hide from human sight
     Sweet secrets, or beside its breathless sleep
     That loveliest dreams perpetual watch did keep.

'TIS past! The sultry tyrant of the south
Has spent his short-liv'd rage; more grateful hours
Move silent on; the skies no more repel 
The dazzled sight, but with mild maiden beams
Of temper'd light, invite the cherish'd eye
To wander o'er their sphere; where hung aloft
DIAN's bright crescent, like a silver bow
New strung in heaven, lifts high its beamy horns

Impatient for the night, and seems to push
Her brother down the sky. Fair VENUS shines
Even in the eye of day; with sweetest beam
Propitious shines, and shakes a trembling flood
Of soften'd radiance from her dewy locks.
The shadows spread apace; while meeken'd Eve
Her cheek yet warm with blushes, slow retires
Thro' the Hesperian gardens of the west,
And shuts the gates of day. 'Tis now the hour
When Contemplation, from her sunless haunts,
The cool damp grotto, or the lonely depth
Of unpierc'd woods, where wrapt in solid shade
She mused away the gaudy hours of noon,
And fed on thoughts unripen'd by the sun,
Moves forward; and with radiant finger points
To yon blue concave swell'd by breath divine,
Where, one by one, the living eyes of heaven
Awake, quick kindling o'er the face of ether

One boundless blaze; ten thousand trembling fires, 
And dancing lustres, where th' unsteady eye 
Restless, and dazzled wanders unconfin'd
O'er all this field of glories: spacious field! 
And worthy of the master: he, whose hand
With hieroglyphics older than the Nile, 
Inscrib'd the mystic tablet; hung on high 
To public gaze, and said, adore, O man!
Of milky light, what soft o'erflowing urn, 
Are all these lamps so fill'd? these friendly lamps,
For ever streaming o'er the azure deep 
To point our path, and light us to our home. 
How soft they slide along their lucid spheres!
And silent as the foot of time, fulfil
Their destin'd courses: Nature's self is hush'd, 
And, but a scatter'd leaf, which rustles thro' 
The thick-wove foliage, not a sound is heard

To break the midnight air; tho' the rais'd ear,
Intensely listening, drinks in every breath.
How deep the silence, yet how loud the praise!
But are they silent all? or is there not
A tongue in every star that talks with man, 
And wooes him to be wise; nor wooes in vain: 
This dead of midnight is the noon of thought, 
And wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars.
At this still hour the self-collected soul
Turns inward, and beholds a stranger there 
Of high descent, and more than mortal rank;
Which must burn on for ages, when the sun, 
(Fair transitory creature of a day!) 
Has clos'd his golden eye, and wrapt in shades 
Forgets his wonted journey thro' the east.

Perhaps my future home, from whence the soul

Revolving periods past, may oft look back 
With recollected tenderness, on all 
The various busy scenes she left below, 
Its deep laid projects and its strange events, 
As on some fond and doating tale that sooth'd 
Her infant hours; O be it lawful now 
To tread the hallow'd circles of your courts, 
And with mute wonder and delighted awe 
Approach your burning confines. Seiz'd in thought 
On fancy's wild and roving wing I sail, 
From the green borders of the peopled earth, 
And the pale moon, her duteous fair attendant; 
From solitary Mars; from the vast orb 
Of Jupiter, whose huge gigantic bulk 
Dances in ether like the lightest leaf; 
To the dim verge, the suburbs of the system, 
Where chearless Saturn 'midst her watry moons 
Girt with a lucid zone, majestic sits

Amongst her weeping handmaids: fearless thence
I launch into the trackless deeps of space, 
Where, burning round, ten thousand suns appear,
Of elder beam; which ask no leave to shine
Of our terrestrial star, nor borrow light 
From the proud regent of our scanty day;
Sons of the morning, first born of creation, 
And only less than him who marks their track, 
And guides their fiery wheels. Here must I stop,
Or is there aught beyond? What hand unseen 
Impels me onward thro' the glowing orbs 
Of inhabitable nature; far remote,
To the dread confines of eternal night, 
To solitudes of vast unpeopled space, 
The desarts of creation, wide and wild;
Where embryo systems and unkindled suns 
Sleep in the womb of chaos; fancy droops,

And thought astonish'd stops her bold career.
But oh thou mighty mind! whose powerful word 
Said, thus let all things be, and thus they were, 
Where shall I seek thy presence? how unblam'd 
Invoke thy dread perfection? 
Have the broad eye-lids of the morn beheld thee?
Or does the beamy shoulder of Orion 
Support thy throne? O look with pity down
On erring guilty man; not in thy names 
Of terrour clad; not with those thunders arm'd
That conscious Sinai felt, when fear appall'd 
The scatter'd tribes; thou hast a gentler voice,
That whispers comfort to the swelling heart,
Abash'd, yet longing to behold her Maker.

But now my soul unus'd tostretch her powers
In flight so daring, drops her weary wing,
And seeks again the known accustom'd spot,

Drest up with sun, and shade, and lawns, and streams, 
A mansion fair and spacious for its guest, 
And full replete with wonders. Let me here 
Content and grateful, wait th' appointed time 
And ripen for the skies: the hour will come 
When all these splendours bursting on my sight 
Shall stand unveil'd, and to my ravished sense
Unlock the glories of the world unknown. 

Several weeks ago I discovered a photograph of my mother
sitting in the sun, her face flushed as with achievement or triumph.
The sun was shining. The dogs
were sleeping at her feet where time was also sleeping,
calm and unmoving as in all photographs.

I wiped the dust from my mother's face.
Indeed, dust covered everything; it seemed to me the persistent
haze of nostalgia that protects all relics of childhood.
In the background, an assortment of park furniture, trees and shrubbery.

The sun moved lower in the sky, the shadows lengthened and darkened.
The more dust I removed, the more these shadows grew.
Summer arrived. The children
leaned over the rose border, their shadows
merging with the shadows of the roses.

A word came into my head, referring
to this shifting and changing, these erasures
that were now obvious—

it appeared, and as quickly vanished.
Was it blindness or darkness, peril, confusion?

Summer arrived, then autumn. The leaves turning,
the children bright spots in a mash of bronze and sienna.


                                                         When I had recovered somewhat from these events,
I replaced the photograph as I had found it
between the pages of an ancient paperback,
many parts of which had been
annotated in the margins, sometimes in words but more often
in spirited questions and exclamations
meaning "I agree" or "I'm unsure, puzzled—"

The ink was faded. Here and there I couldn't tell
what thoughts occurred to the reader
but through the bruise-like blotches I could sense
urgency, as though tears had fallen.

I held the book awhile.
It was Death in Venice (in translation):
I had noted the page in case, as Freud believed,
nothing is an accident.

Thus the little photograph
was buried again, as the past is buried in the future.
In the margin there were two words,
linked by an arrow: "sterility" and, down the page, "oblivion"—

"And it seemed to him the pale and lovely
summoner out there smiled at him and beckoned..



                                                         How quiet the garden is;
no breeze ruffles the Cornelian cherry.
Summer has come.

How quiet it is
now that life has triumphed. The rough

pillars of the sycamores
support the immobile
shelves of the foliage,

the lawn beneath
lush, iridescent—

And in the middle of the sky,
the immodest god.

Things are, he says. They are, they do not change;
response does not change.

How hushed it is, the stage
as well as the audience; it seems
breathing is an intrusion.

He must be very close,
the grass is shadowless.

How quiet it is, how silent,
like an afternoon in Pompeii.


                                                         Beatrice took the children to the park in Cedarhurst.
The sun was shining. Airplanes
passed back and forth overhead, peaceful because the war was over.

It was the world of her imagination:
true and false were of no importance.

Freshly polished and glittering—
that was the world. Dust
had not yet erupted on the surface of things.

The planes passed back and forth, bound
for Rome and Paris—you couldn't get there
unless you flew over the park. Everything
must pass through, nothing can stop—

The children held hands, leaning
to smell the roses.
They were five and seven.

Infinite, infinite—that
was her perception of time.

She sat on a bench, somewhat hidden by oak trees.
Far away, fear approached and departed;
from the train station came the sound it made.

The sky was pink and orange, older because the day was over.

There was no wind. The summer day
cast oak-shaped shadows on the green grass. 

Clouds float by on a summer sky 
I hop scotch over to you
Rainbows arch from ground to gold 
I climb over to you
Thunder grumbles, lightning tumbles 
And I bounce over to you
Sun beams back and catches me 
Smiling over at you


Never was sun so bright before,
No matin of the lark so sweet,
No grass so green beneath my feet,
Nor with such dewdrops jewelled o'er.

I stand with thee outside the door,
The air not yet is close with heat,
And far across the yellowing wheat
The waves are breaking on the shore.

A lovely day! Yet many such,
Each like to each, this month have passed,
And none did so supremely shine.
One thing they lacked: the perfect touch
Of thee--and thou art come at last,
And half this loveliness is thine. 

In the deserted, moon-blanched street,
How lonely rings the echo of my feet!
Those windows, which I gaze at, frown,
Silent and white, unopening down,
Repellent as the world,--but see,
A break between the housetops shows
The moon! and lost behind her, fading dim
Into the dewy dark obscurity
Down at the far horizon's rim,
Doth a whole tract of heaven disclose!

And to my mind the thought
Is on a sudden brought
Of a past night, and a far different scene:
Headlands stood out into the moonlit deep
As clearly as at noon;
The spring-tide's brimming flow
Heaved dazzlingly between;
Houses, with long wide sweep,
Girdled the glistening bay;
Behind, through the soft air,
The blue haze-cradled mountains spread away.
That night was far more fair--
But the same restless pacings to and fro,
And the same vainly throbbing heart was there,
And the same bright, calm moon.

And the calm moonlight seems to say:--
Hast thou then still the old unquiet breast,
Which neither deadens into rest,
Nor ever feels the fiery glow
That whirls the spirit from itself away,
But fluctuates to and fro,
Never by passion quite possessed
And never quite benumbed by the world's sway?--
And I, I know not if to pray
Still to be what I am, or yield, and be
Like all the other men I see.

For most men in a brazen prison live,
Where, in the sun's hot eye,
With heads bent o'er their toil, they languidly
Their lives to some unmeaning taskwork give,
Dreaming of naught beyond their prison wall.
And as, year after year,
Fresh products of their barren labor fall
From their tired hands, and rest
Never yet comes more near,
Gloom settles slowly down over their breast.
And while they try to stem
The waves of mournful thought by which they are prest,
Death in their prison reaches them,
Unfreed, having seen nothing, still unblest.

And the rest, a few,
Escape their prison and depart
On the wide ocean of life anew.
There the freed prisoner, where'er his heart
Listeth will sail;
Nor doth he know how there prevail,
Despotic on that sea.
Trade-winds which cross it from eternity:
Awhile he holds some false way, undebarred
By thwarting signs, and braves
The freshening wind and blackening waves.
And then the tempest strikes him; and between
The lightning bursts is seen
Only a driving wreck,
And the pale master on his spar-strewn deck
With anguished face and flying hair
Grasping the rudder hard,
Still bent to make some port he knows not where,
Still standing for some false, impossible shore.
And sterner comes the roar
Of sea and wind, and through the deepening gloom
Fainter and fainter wreck and helmsman loom,
And he too disappears, and comes no more.

Is there no life, but these alone?
Madman or slave, must man be one?

Plainness and clearness without shadow of stain!
Clearness divine!
Ye heavens, whose pure dark regions have no sign
Of languor, though so calm, and though so great
Are yet untroubled and unpassionate;
Who, though so noble, share in the world's toil,
And, though so tasked, keep free from dust and soil!
I will not say that your mild deeps retain
A tinge, it may be, of their silent pain
Who have longed deeply once, and longed in vain--
But I will rather say that you remain

A world above man's head, to let him see
How boundless might his soul's horizons be,
How vast, yet of what clear transparency!
How it were good to live there, and breathe free;
How fair a lot to fill
Is left to each man still

To kneel before some saintly shrine,
To breathe the health of airs divine,
Or bathe where sacred rivers flow,
The cowled and turbaned pilgrims go.
I too, a palmer, take, as they
With staff and scallop-shell, my way
To feel, from burdening cares and ills,
The strong uplifting of the hills.

The years are many since, at first,
For dreamed-of wonders all athirst,
The shadow of the mountain wall.
Ah! where are they who sailed with me
The beautiful island-studded sea?
And am I he whose keen surprise
Flashed out from such unclouded eyes?

Still, when the sun of summer burns,
My longing for the hills returns;
And northward, leaving at my back
The warm vale of the Merrimac,
I go to meet the winds of morn,
Blown down the hill-gaps, mountain-born,
Breathe scent of pines, and satisfy
The hunger of a lowland eye.

Again I see the day decline
Along a ridged horizon line;
Touching the hill-tops, as a nun
Her beaded rosary, sinks the sun.
One lake lies golden, which shall soon
Be silver in the rising moon;
And one, the crimson of the skies
And mountain purple multiplies.

With the untroubled quiet blends
The distance-softened voice of friends;
The girl's light laugh no discord brings
To the low song the pine-tree sings;
And, not unwelcome, comes the hail
Of boyhood from his nearing sail.
The human presence breaks no spell,
And sunset still is miracle!

Calm as the hour, methinks I feel
A sense of worship o'er me steal;
Not that of satyr-charming Pan,
No cult of Nature shaming man,
Not Beauty's self, but that which lives
And shines through all the veils it weaves,--
Soul of the mountain, lake, and wood,
Their witness to the Eternal Good!

And if, by fond illusion, here
The earth to heaven seems drawing near,
And yon outlying range invites
To other and serener heights,
Scarce hid behind its topmost swell,
The shining Mounts Delectable
A dream may hint of truth no less
Than the sharp light of wakefulness.

As through her vale of incense smoke.
Of old the spell-rapt priestess spoke,
More than her heathen oracle,
May not this trance of sunset tell
That Nature's forms of loveliness
Their heavenly archetypes confess,
Fashioned like Israel's ark alone
From patterns in the Mount made known?

A holier beauty overbroods
These fair and faint similitudes;
Yet not unblest is he who sees
And knows beyond this masquerade
Of shape and color, light and shade,
And dawn and set, and wax and wane,
Eternal verities remain.

O gems of sapphire, granite set!
O hills that charmed horizons fret
I know how fair your morns can break,
In rosy light on isle and lake;
How over wooded slopes can run
The noonday play of cloud and sun,
And evening droop her oriflamme
Of gold and red in still Asquam.

The summer moons may round again,
And careless feet these hills profane;
These sunsets waste on vacant eyes
The lavish splendor of the skies;
Fashion and folly, misplaced here,
Sigh for their natural atmosphere,
And travelled pride the outlook scorn
Of lesser heights than Matterhorn.

But let me dream that hill and sky
Of unseen beauty prophesy;
And in these tinted lakes behold
The trailing of the raiment fold
Of that which, still eluding gaze,
Allures to upward-tending ways,
Whose footprints make, wherever found,
Our common earth a holy ground. 

Over the soughing of the sombre wind
priests chant louder than ever;
the mouth of India opens.

Crocodiles move into deeper waters.

Mornings of heated middens
smoke under the sun.

The good wife
lies in my bed
through the long afternoon;
dreaming still, unexhausted
by the deep roar of funeral pyres.

	

	The quiet August noon has come,
A slumberous silence fills the sky,
The fields are still, the woods are dumb,
In glassy sleep the waters lie.

And mark yon soft white clouds that rest
Above our vale, a moveless throng;
The cattle on the mountain's breast
Enjoy the grateful shadow long.

Oh, how unlike those merry hours
In early June when Earth laughs out,
When the fresh winds make love to flowers,
And woodlands sing and waters shout.

When in the grass sweet voices talk,
And strains of tiny music swell
From every moss-cup of the rock,
From every nameless blossom's bell.

But now a joy too deep for sound,
A peace no other season knows,
Hushes the heavens and wraps the ground,
The blessing of supreme repose.

Away! I will not be, to-day,
The only slave of toil and care.
Away from desk and dust! away!
I'll be as idle as the air.

Beneath the open sky abroad,
Among the plants and breathing things,
I'll share the calm the season brings.

Come, thou, in whose soft eyes I see
The gentle meanings of thy heart,
One day amid the woods with me,
From men and all their cares apart.

And where, upon the meadow's breast,
The shadow of the thicket lies,
The blue wild flowers thou gatherest
Shall glow yet deeper near thine eyes.

Come, and when mid the calm profound,
I turn, those gentle eyes to seek,
They, like the lovely landscape round,
Of innocence and peace shall speak.

Rest here, beneath the unmoving shade,
And on the silent valleys gaze,
Winding and widening, till they fade
In yon soft ring of summer haze.

The village trees their summits rear
Still as its spire, and yonder flock
At rest in those calm fields appear
As chiselled from the lifeless rock.

One tranquil mount the scene o'erlooks--
There the hushed winds their sabbath keep
While a near hum from bees and brooks
Comes faintly like the breath of sleep.

Well may the gazer deem that when,
Worn with the struggle and the strife,
And heart-sick at the wrongs of men,
The good forsakes the scene of life;

Like this deep quiet that, awhile,
Lingers the lovely landscape o'er,
Shall be the peace whose holy smile
Welcomes him to a happier shore. 

To the sagging wharf
few ships could come.
The population numbered
two giants, an idiot, a dwarf,

a gentle storekeeper
asleep behind his counter,
and our kind landlady—
the dwarf was her dressmaker.

The idiot could be beguiled
by picking blackberries,
but then threw them away.
The shrunken seamstress smiled.

By the sea, lying
blue as a mackerel,
our boarding house was streaked
as though it had been crying.

Extraordinary geraniums
crowded the front windows,
the floors glittered with
assorted linoleums.

Every night we listened
for a horned owl.
In the horned lamp flame,
the wallpaper glistened.

The giant with the stammer
was the landlady’s son,
grumbling on the stairs
over an old grammar.

He was morose,
but she was cheerful.
The bedroom was cold,
the feather bed close.

We were awakened in the dark by
the somnambulist brook
nearing the sea,
still dreaming audibly. 

Shall I, lying in a grot,
Die because the day is hot?
Or declare I can't endure
Such a torrid temperature?
Be it hotter than the flames
South Gehenna Junction claims,
  If it be not so to me,
  What care I how hot it be?

Shall I say I love the town
Praised by Robinson and Browne?
Shall I say, 'In summer heat
Old Manhattan can't be beat?'
Be it luring as a bar,
Or my neighbour's motor-car,
  If I think it is pazziz
  What care I how fine it is?

Shall I prate of rural joys
Far from civic smoke and noise?
Shall I, like the others, drool
'But the nights are always cool?'
If I hate to rise at six
Shall I praise the suburbs? Nix!
  If the country's not for me,
  What care I how good it be?

Town or country, cool or hot,
Differs nothing, matters not;
For to quote that Roman cuss,
Why dispute 'de gustibus?'
If to this or that one should
Take a fancy, it is good.
  If these rhymes look good to me,
  What care I how bad they be

AFTER LEE O. HARRIS

The master-hand whose pencils trace
This wondrous landscape of the morn,
Is but the sun, whose glowing face
Reflects the rapture and the grace
Of inspiration Heaven-born.

And yet with vision-dazzled eyes,
I see the lotus-lands of old,
Where odorous breezes fall and rise,
And mountains, peering in the skies,
Stand ankle-deep in lakes of gold.

And, spangled with the shine and shade,
I see the rivers raveled out
In strands of silver, slowly fade
In threads of light along the glade
Where truant roses hide and pout.

The tamarind on gleaming sands
Droops drowsily beneath the heat;
And bowed as though aweary, stands
The stately palm, with lazy hands
That fold their shadows round his feet.

And mistily, as through a veil,
I catch the glances of a sea
Of sapphire, dimpled with a gale
Toward Colch's blowing, where the sail
Of Jason's Argo beckons me.

And gazing on and farther yet,
I see the isles enchanted, bright
With fretted spire and parapet,
And gilded mosque and minaret,
That glitter in the crimson light.

But as I gaze, the city's walls
Are keenly smitten with a gleam
Of pallid splendor, that appalls
The fancy as the ruin falls
In ashen embers of a dream.

Yet over all the waking earth
The tears of night are brushed away,
And eyes are lit with love and mirth,
And benisons of richest worth
Go up to bless the new-born day. 

Live all thy sweet life through, 
Sweet Rose, dew-sprent, 
Drop down thine evening dew 
To gather it anew 
When day is bright: 
I fancy thou wast meant 
Chiefly to give delight. 


Sing in the silent sky, 
Glad soaring bird; 
Sing out thy notes on high 
To sunbeam straying by 
Or passing cloud; 
Heedless if thou art heard 
Sing thy full song aloud. 


Oh that it were with me 
As with the flower; 
Blooming on its own tree 
For butterfly and bee 
Its summer morns: 
That I might bloom mine hour 
A rose in spite of thorns. 


Oh that my work were done 
As birds' that soar 
Rejoicing in the sun: 
That when my time is run 
And daylight too, 
I so might rest once more 
Cool with refreshing dew. 

MEN of the North-land! where's the manly spirit
Of the true-hearted and the unshackled gone?
Sons of old freemen, do we but inherit
Their names alone?
Is the old Pilgrim spirit quenched within us,
Stoops the strong manhood of our souls so low,
That Mammon's lure or Party's wile can win us
To silence now?
Now, when our land to ruin's brink is verging,
Now, when the padlocks for our lips are forging,
Silence is crime!
What! shall we henceforth humbly ask as favors
Rights all our own? In madness shall we barter,
For treacherous peace, the freedom Nature gave us,
Here shall the statesman forge his human fetters,
Here the false jurist human rights deny,
And in the church, their proud and skilled abettors.
Make truth a lie?
Torture the pages of the hallowed Bible,
To sanction crime, and robbery, and blood?
And, in Oppression's hateful service, libel
Shall our New England stand erect no longer,
But stoop in chains upon her downward way,
Thicker to gather on her limbs and stronger
Day after day?
Oh no; methinks from all her wild, green mountains;
From valleys where her slumbering fathers lie;
From her blue rivers and her welling fountains,
And clear, cold sky;
From her rough coast, and isles, which hungry Ocean
Gnaws with his surges; from the fisher's skiff,
With white sail swaying to the billows' motion
Round rock and cliff;
From the free fireside of her unbought farmer;
From her free laborer at his loom and wheel;
From the brown smith-shop, where, beneath the hammer,
Rings the red steel;
Our land, and left us to an evil choice,
Loud as the summer thunderbolt shall waken
A People's voice.
Startling and stern! the Northern winds shall bear it
Over Potomac's to St. Mary's wave;
And buried Freedom shall awake to hear it
Within her grave.
Oh, let that voice go forth! The bondman sighing
By Santee's wave, in Mississippi's cane,
Shall feel the hope, within his bosom dying,
Revive again.
Let it go forth! The millions who are gazing
Sadly upon us from afar shall smile,
Bless us the while.
Oh for your ancient freedom, pure and holy,
For the deliverance of a groaning earth,
For the wronged captive, bleeding, crushed, and lowly,
Let it go forth!
Sons of the best of fathers! will ye falter
With all they left ye perilled and at stake?
Ho! once again on Freedom's holy altar
The fire awake!
Prayer-strengthened for the trial, come together,
Put on the harness for the moral fight,
And, with the blessing of your Heavenly Father,
Maintain the right

On the dewdropp dust heap comes the morning glory
When the sunflower arises with a brand new story, 
An entangled web of petals burst from the cocoon, 
Apart from unconsciousness gone is the full moon. 

Beauty of the flowers stem-tips arrive freight express, 
They bear the gift of life to others eyes by giving rest, 
Through gaps between the curtains of our imperceptibly, 
When colored brushes of love taps at my heart silently.

Soon the sound of newness comes alive to the world, 
Wind quietly blows, one by one the petals are hurled, 
As the joy of sweetness spreads the day winds down, 
Poof! Like magic soon the peace is no longer around.
 
But it’s a cycle only to repeat, as it cannot be stopped, 
Genesis  is, "seedtime and harvest" just for crops? 
"Summer and winter, day and night will never cease, "
"As long as the earth endures" growth will increase.

And fell asleep only with great expectation when I arise, 
Expecting the beauty of the garden before both my eyes, 
That magnificent glory of repetition no longer a surprise, 
Wherefore soon I grew in wisdom and quit asking, why? 

But, do not forget, as it is with any kind of planted seed, 
Love and affection’s great but water is its greatest need, 
Can nothing be more precious to anything that will grow? 
For all without an adequate supply of the elements H.

Last but not least do not consider these complexities odd, 
So, rather than to ponder and study just simply appreciate, 
Remembering the Creating source is the greatest of great.

All you want is a week off
All you get is a Sunday, 
When you need it! 
 
All you want is your whole class to befriend you
All you get is one person, who always listens to you, 
When you need it! 
 
All you want is to be the most interesting person alive
All you get is one lovable idiot, who makes you feel like one, 
When you need it! 
 
All you want is to top your class with flying colours
All you get is that short and sweet one minute lead, 
When you need it! 
 
All you want is everything good in this world all at once
All you get is something better part by part, 
All you have to do is to close your eyes, 
All you have to do is cherish what you get, 
All you have to make is the best out of it, 
Because it is a Sunday, which comes once a week, 
Only, 
When you need it

Today the sun is fine
We will sing in the sunshine
On this beautiful day the world is mine


Young palmer sun, that to these shining sands
 Pourest thy pilgrim's tale, discoursing still
Thy silver passages of sacred lands,
 With news of Sepulchre and Dolorous Hill,

Canst thou be he that, yester-sunset warm,
 Purple with Paynim rage and wrack desire,
Dashed ravening out of a dusty lair of Storm,
 Harried the west, and set the world on fire?

Hast thou perchance repented, Saracen Sun?
 Wilt warm the world with peace and dove-desire?
Or wilt thou, ere this very day be done,
 Blaze Saladin still, with unforgiving fire

I love the evenings, passionless and fair, I love the evens, 
Whether old manor-fronts their ray with golden fulgence leavens, 
In numerous leafage bosomed close; 
Whether the mist in reefs of fire extend its reaches sheer, 
Or a hundred sunbeams splinter in an azure atmosphere 
On cloudy archipelagos. 
 
Oh, gaze ye on the firmament! a hundred clouds in motion, 
Up-piled in the immense sublime beneath the winds' commotion, 
Their unimagined shapes accord: 
Under their waves at intervals flame a pale levin through, 
As if some giant of the air amid the vapors drew 
A sudden elemental sword. 
 
The sun at bay with splendid thrusts still keeps the sullen fold; 
And momently at distance sets, as a cupola of gold, 
The thatched roof of a cot a-glance; 
Or on the blurred horizon joins his battle with the haze; 
Or pools the blooming fields about with inter-isolate blaze, 
Great moveless meres of radiance. 
 
Then mark you how there hangs athwart the firmament's swept track, 
Yonder a mighty crocodile with vast irradiant back, 
A triple row of pointed teeth? 
Under its burnished belly slips a ray of eventide, 
The flickerings of a hundred glowing clouds in tenebrous side 
With scales of golden mail ensheathe. 
 
Then mounts a palace, then the air vibrates--the vision flees. 
Confounded to its base, the fearful cloudy edifice 
Ruins immense in mounded wrack; 
Afar the fragments strew the sky, and each envermeiled cone 
Hangeth, peak downward, overhead, like mountains overthrown 
When the earthquake heaves its hugy back. 
 
These vapors, with their leaden, golden, iron, bronzed glows, 
Where the hurricane, the waterspout, thunder, and hell repose, 
Muttering hoarse dreams of destined harms,-- 
As a warrior that suspendeth from the roof-tree of his keep 
His dreadful and resounding arms! 
 
All vanishes! The Sun, from topmost heaven precipitated, 
Like a globe of iron which is tossed back fiery red 
Into the furnace stirred to fume, 
Shocking the cloudy surges, plashed from its impetuous ire, 
Even to the zenith spattereth in a flecking scud of fire 
The vaporous and inflamed spaume. 
 
O contemplate the heavens! Whenas the vein-drawn day dies pale, 
In every season, every place, gaze through their every veil? 
With love that has not speech for need! 
Beneath their solemn beauty is a mystery infinite: 
If winter hue them like a pall, or if the summer night 
Fantasy them starre brede. 

Broad shadows fall. On all the mountain side
  The scythe-swept fields are silent. Slowly home
  By the long beach the high-piled hay-carts come,
  Splashing the pale salt shallows. Over wide
  Fawn-coloured wastes of mud the slipping tide,
  Round the dun rocks and wattled fisheries,
  Creeps murmuring in. And now by twos and threes, 
  O'er the slow spreading pools with clamorous chide, 
  Belated crows from strip to strip take flight. 
 Soon will the first star shine; yet ere the night 
 Reach onward to the pale-green distances, 
 The sun's last shaft beyond the gray sea-floor 
 Still dreams upon the Kamouraska shore, 
 And the long line of golden villages. 

Already I am no longer looked at with lechery or love.
My daughters and sons have put me away with marbles and dolls,
Are gone from the house.
My husband and lovers are pleasant or somewhat polite
And night is night.

It is a real chill out,
The genuine thing.
I am not deceived, I do not think it is still summer
Because sun stays and birds continue to sing.

It is summer-gone that I see, it is summer-gone.
The sweet flowers indrying and dying down,
The grasses forgetting their blaze and consenting to brown.

It is a real chill out. The fall crisp comes
I am aware there is winter to heed.
There is no warm house
That is fitted with my need.

I am cold in this cold house this house
Whose washed echoes are tremulous down lost halls.
I am a woman, and dusty, standing among new affairs.
I am a woman who hurries through her prayers.

Tin intimations of a quiet core to be my
Desert and my dear relief
Come: there shall be such islanding from grief,
And small communion with the master shore.
Twang they. And I incline this ear to tin,
Consult a dual dilemma. Whether to dry
In humming pallor or to leap and die.

Somebody muffed it?? Somebody wanted to joke. 

When the sun sets over the mansion, west
And the breeze gently blows across the lake
I remember what I once thought was best
Thankful that turn, He didn’t let me take
When the peaceful sounds of nature replace
The busy sounds of students, cars and such
As it reaches down for my heart to touch
When nightfall comes to take away the light
And the stars sing their silent songs above
It humbles me that even in my blight
I am given gifts of mercy and love

And, when the storm clouds come rolling on through
Still I'll remember this sunset’s warm hue



streets under the trees with a headache self-conscious looking at the full moon.

In my hungry fatigue, and shopping for images, I went into the neon fruit
supermarket, dreaming of your enumerations!
What peaches and what penumbras! Whole families shopping at night! Aisles
full of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the tomatoes! --- and you,
Garcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons?
I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among the
meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.
I heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops? What price
bananas? Are you my Angel?
I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, and
followed in my imagination by the store detective.
We strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tasting
artichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier.
Where are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Which way does
your beard point tonight?
(I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel
absurd.)
Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade to
shade, lights out in the houses, we'll both be lonely.
Will we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles in
driveways, home to our silent cottage?
Ah, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, what America did you
have when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking bank and
stood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of Lethe

Every day I swear: 
I won't ever let her enter my heart.
But breaking down my resolve, 
the foolish phone
reaches her number every day.

Lover is he who laments every moment
laying down his heart 
beneath his beloved's feet.

Truly, love makes a man 
a perfect coward 
and a supreme slave. 

They give you a desk with a lid, mother.
They let you keep your book.
My desk is next to the window.
I can see the trees.
But you mustn't look out the window
   at light on the leaves.
You must look at the book.

A nice-smelling, shiny book, mother,
With words in it, and pictures.
I mostly like the pictures,
   some of them animals and birds. 
But you mustn't look at the pictures.
You don't ever read the pictures.
You read the words![the concept of this write stolen from one of
 jakki vasudev's story]


a group of farmers
went to god the creator
asking for a reform in nature

the right thing at the wrong time
that's what you do they say
a drought when we need rain
a pouring rain which does not give us gain
a flood to wash away our grains

give us the power
to handle nature
we do know better
god obliged without an utter

after tilling and sowing
almost like a drip irrigation
the rain was made to fall on
the growth was encouraging

the rain was stopped
when not needed
the field was a lovely green
sparkling in the beautiful sunshine

we will reap the benefits
when we harvest.  

thought the farmers
a mild breeze to take away the heat
uprooted a part of the cultivation

is it a trick god is playing on us
the farmers thought.. 

examined the uprooted
roots were short
grains not too many

god owed an explanation
'see i give a drought for the root to grow
deep inside to find its resources
the growth of the root stabilizes the plant'

MINE WAS A SURVIVAL PLAN
YOU WANTED AN IMMEDIATE GAINMany thousand glittering motes
Crowd forward greedily together
In trembling circles.
Extravagantly carousing away
For a whole hour rapidly vanishing,
They rave, delirious, a shrill whir,
Shivering with joy against death.
While kingdoms, sunk into ruin,
Whose thrones, heavy with gold, instantly scattered
Into night and legend, without leaving a trace,
Have never known so fierce a dancing.






The winds are pleasant, 
And the winter has gone, 
While packing my woolen wares, 
A white sweater brought tears in my eyes, 
I can't wear it any more but every year, 
I take it out and hang it with others, 
Fifty years ago she saw the design, 
And asked a lady how to knit it, 
The lady smiled and said proudly, 
Take it for a day or two, 
Copy the design if you can, 
She brought it watched it, 
And learnt the secret, 
The design was formed, 
Just by knitting from both sides, 
She returned the sweater to the proud lady, 
Brought white wool and knitted the sweater, 
In just two days, and gifted it to me, 
On my twentieth birthday, 
I was lean at that time, 
The proud lady when saw me in the sweater, 
Could not say anything just smiled, 
My sweet mother!  Who says you're dead? 
I still see you in the token of your love. 

Flowers blossom in the sunlight, 
As we all need sunlight to blossom 
too.

Flowers love a good shower of 
cool and refreshing water, 
Like we all need a refreshing
shower too.

Flowers are cheerful when music
plays that beautiful song, 
In the same way that favorite
song cheers us up.

The breeze of the wind gives us
that breath of life, 
Flowers are filled with the
breath of life, 
That the breeze provides.

Delicate flowers lose their petals
in need of nourishment, 
Just like we lose a strand of hair 
that needs to be nourished to grow 
back again.

A good night's sleep help us to feel
refreshed, 
Flowers need a good night's sleep
to feel refreshed and to blossom
beautifully.

A sweet comparison between flowers
and us, 
Knowing how we are very much alike, 
It makes a beautiful story. 

Today I'm not in my usual mood
to face things in life as I would. 
Sad thoughts of loss of our beloved, 
and missing talks of other dearly loved
have inhabited this heart bereaved
as if it all distressed my soul
from the quietness and joy as a whole.
Anyway, this sweet haven I sought
so that hope and peace could be brought.

Waiting for this surprise of mine
What is it, whatever could it be
I am wondering, so excitedly

I almost wish I did not know
Time seems to go so slow
Hearing another car drive by
Could that be the delivery guy


The Bombola faints in the hot Bowral tree, 
Where fierce Mullengudgery's smothering fires 
Far from the breezes of Coolgardie 
Burn ghastly and blue as the day expires; 

And Murriwillumba complaineth in song 
For the garlanded bowers of Woolloomooloo, 
And the Ballarat Fly and the lone Wollongong 
They dream of the gardens of Jamberoo; 

The wallabi sighs for the Murrubidgee, 
For the velvety sod of the Munno Parah, 
Where the waters of healing from Muloowurtie 
Flow dim in the gloaming by Yaranyackah; 

The Koppio sorrows for lost Wolloway, 
And sigheth in secret for Murrurundi, 
The Whangeroo wombat lamenteth the day 
That made him an exile from Jerrilderie; 

The Teawamute Tumut from Wirrega's glade, 
The Nangkita swallow, the Wallaroo swan, 
They long for the peace of the Timaru shade 
And thy balmy soft airs, O sweet Mittagong! 

The Kooringa buffalo pants in the sun, 
The Kondoparinga lies gaping for breath, 
The Kongorong Camaum to the shadow has won, 
But the Goomeroo sinks in the slumber of death; 

In the weltering hell of the Moorooroo plain 
The Yatala Wangary withers and dies, 
And the Worrow Wanilla, demented with pain, 
To the Woolgoolga woodlands despairingly flies; 

Sweet Nangwarry's desolate, Coonamble wails, 
And Tungkillo Kuito in sables is drest, 
For the Whangerei winds fall asleep in the sails 
And the Booleroo life-breeze is dead in the west. 

Mypongo, Kapunda, O slumber no more 
Yankalilla, Parawirra, be warned 
There's death in the air! 
Killanoola, wherefore 
Shall the prayer of Penola be scorned? 

Cootamundra, and Takee, and Wakatipu, 
Toowoomba, Kaikoura are lost 
From Onkaparinga to far Oamaru 
All burn in this hell's holocaust! 

Paramatta and Binnum are gone to their rest 
In the vale of Tapanni Taroom, 
Kawakawa, Deniliquin - all that was best 
In the earth are but graves and a tomb! 

Narrandera mourns, Cameron answers not 
When the roll of the scathless we cry 
Tongariro, Goondiwindi, Woolundunga, the spot 
Is mute and forlorn where ye lie. 

Short space shall be hereafter
Ere April brings the hour
Of weeping and of laughter,
Of sunshine and of shower,
Of groaning and of gladness,
Of singing and of sadness,
Of melody and madness,
Of all sweet things and sour.

Sweet to the blithe bucolic
Who knows nor cribs nor crams,
Who sees the frisky frolic
Of lanky little lambs;
But sour beyond expression
To one in deep depression
Who sees the closing session
And imminent exams.

He cannot hear the singing
Of birds upon the bents,
Nor watch the wildflowers springing,
Nor smell the April scents.
He gathers grief with grinding,
Foul food of sorrow finding
In books of dreary binding
And drearier contents.

One hope alone sustains him,
And no more hopes beside,
One trust alone restrains him
From shocking suicide;
He will not play nor palter
With hemlock or with halter,
He will not fear nor falter,
Whatever chance betide.

He knows examinations
Like all things else have ends,
And then come vast vacations
And visits to his friends,
And youth with pleasure yoking,
And joyfulness and joking,
And smilingness and smoking,
For grief to make amends. 

Long before our time they called her old,
But she'd walk down the same road every day.
Her age became too much to say
In years — and, like a forest's, would be told 

In centuries. She comes to stand at dusk — 
Her spot each time the same — and to foretell.
She is a hollow, wrinkled husk,
Dark as a fire-gutted citadel. 

She has to turn her flock of talking loose
Or it will grow too crowded to relieve.
Flapping and screaming, words are flying all 

Around her. Then, returning home to roost,
They find a perch beneath her eyebrows' eaves,
And in that shadow wait for night to fall. 

Hurrying for ever in their restless flight 
The generations of earth's teeming womb 
Rise into being and lapse into the tomb 
Like transient bubbles sparkling in the light; 
They sink in quick succession out of sight 
Into the thick insuperable gloom 
Our futile lives in flashing by illume-- 
Lightning which mocks the darkness of the night. 

Nay--but consider, though we change and die, 
If men must pass shall Man not still remain? 
As the unnumbered drops of summer rain 
Whose changing particles unchanged on high, 
Fixed, in perpetual motion, yet maintain 
The mystic bow emblazoned on the sky. 

Oh Pisa tower 
through the ages
miraculously standing
a symbol of pride
though condemnation threatens
And perhaps one day
you shall kiss the soil.

Majestic tower
made famous by leaning.
The passage of time
unbalanced you, 
But still you stand
forever stalwart.
Honor of your country.



What a pretty tale you told me
Once upon a time
--Said you found it somewhere (scold me!)
Was it prose or was it rhyme,
Greek or Latin? Greek, you said,
While your shoulder propped my head.

Anyhow there's no forgetting
This much if no more,
That a poet (pray, no petting!)
Yes, a bard, sir, famed of yore, 
Went where suchlike used to go,
Singing for a prize, you know.

Well, he had to sing, nor merely
Sing but play the lyre;
Playing was important clearly
Quite as singing: I desire,
Sir, you keep the fact in mind
For a purpose that's behind.

There stood he, while deep attention
Held the judges round, 
--Judges able, I should mention,
To detect the slightest sound
Sung or played amiss: such ears
Had old judges, it appears!

None the less he sang out boldly,
Played in time and tune,
Till the judges, weighing coldly
Each note's worth, seemed, late or soon,
Sure to smile 'In vain one tries
Picking faults out: take the prize!' 

When, a mischief! Were they seven
Strings the lyre possessed?
Oh, and afterwards eleven,
Thank you! Well, sir,--who had guessed
Such ill luck in store?--it happed
One of those same seven strings snapped.

All was lost, then! No! a cricket
(What 'cicada'? Pooh!)
--Some mad thing that left its thicket
For mere love of music--flew 
With its little heart on fire,
Lighted on the crippled lyre.

So that when (Ah joy!) our singer
For his truant string
Feels with disconcerted finger,
What does cricket else but fling
Fiery heart forth, sound the note
Wanted by the throbbing throat?

Ay and, ever to the ending,
Cricket chirps at need, 
Executes the hand's intending,
Promptly, perfectly,--indeed
Saves the singer from defeat
With her chirrup low and sweet.

Till, at ending, all the judges
Cry with one assent
'Take the prize--a prize who grudges
Such a voice and instrument?
Why, we took your lyre for harp,
So it shrilled us forth F sharp!' 

Did the conqueror spurn the creature
Once its service done?
That's no such uncommon feature
In the case when Music's son
Finds his Lotte's power too spent 
For aiding soul development.

No! This other, on returning
Homeward, prize in hand,
Satisfied his bosom's yearning:
(Sir, I hope you understand!) 
--Said 'Some record there must be
Of this cricket's help to me!'

So, he made himself a statue:
Marble stood, life size;
On the lyre, he pointed at you,
Perched his partner in the prize;
Never more apart you found
Her, he throned, from him, she crowned.

That's the tale: its application?
Somebody I know 
Hopes one day for reputation
Thro' his poetry that's--Oh,
All so learned and so wise
And deserving of a prize!

If he gains one, will some ticket
When his statue's built,
Tell the gazer ''Twas a cricket
Helped my crippled lyre, whose lilt
Sweet and low, when strength usurped
Softness' place i' the scale, she chirped? 

'For as victory was nighest,
While I sang and played,--
With my lyre at lowest, highest,
Right alike,--one string that made
'Love' sound soft was snapt in twain
Never to be heard again,--

'Had not a kind cricket fluttered,
Perched upon the place
Vacant left, and duly uttered
'Love, Love, Love,' whene'er the bass 
Asked the treble to atone
For its somewhat sombre drone.'

But you don't know music! Wherefore
Keep on casting pearls
To a--poet? All I care for
Is--to tell him that a girl's
'Love' comes aptly in when gruff
Grows his singing, (There, enough!)Where Humber pours his rich commercial stream,
There dwelt a wretch, who breathed but to blaspheme.
In subterraneous caves his life he led,
Black as the mine, in which he wrought for bread.
When on a day, emerging from the deep,
A Sabbath-day, (such Sabbaths thousands keep!)
The wages of his weekly toil he bore
To buy a cock -- whose blood might win him more;
As if the noblest of the feathered kind
Were but for battle and for death designed;
As if the consecrated hours were meant
For sport, to minds on cruelty intent.
It changed, (such chances Providence obey,)
He met a fellow-labourer on the way,
Whose heart the same desires had once inflamed,
But now the savage temper was reclaimed.
Persuasion on his lips had taken place;
For all plead well who plead the cause of grace.
Wooed him to hear a sermon, and prevailed.
His faithful bow the mighty preacher drew,
Swift as the lightning-glimpse the arrow flew.
He wept; he trembled; cast his eyes around,
To find a worse than he; but none he found.
He felt his sins, and wondered he should feel.
Grace made the wound, and grace alone could heal.
Now farewell oaths, and blasphemies, and lies!
He quits the sinner's for the martyr's prize.
That holy day was washed with many a tear,
Gilded with hope, yet shaded too by fear.
The next his swarthy brethren of the mine
Learned by his altered speech, the change divine,
Laughed when they should have wept, and swore the day
Was nigh when he would swear as fast as they.
'No,' said the penitent: 'such words shall share
This breath no more; devoted now to prayer.
Oh! if thou seest, (thine eye the future sees,)
That I shall yet again blaspheme, like these,
Now strike me to the ground, on which I kneel,
Ere yet this heart relapses into steel;
Now take me to that heaven I once defied,
Thy presence, thy embrace!' -- He spoke, and died

In Scotland's realm, where trees are few
Nor even shrubs abound;
But where, however bleak the view
Some better things are found;

For husband there and wife may boast
Their union undefiled,
And false ones are as rare almost
As hedge-rows in the wild;

In Scotland's realm forlorn and bare
The history chanced of late,--
This history of a wedded pair,
A chaffinch and his mate,.

The spring drew near, each felt a breast
With genial instinct filled;
They paired, and would have built a nest,
But found not where to build.

The heaths uncovered and the moors
Except with snow and sleet,
Sea-beaten rocks and naked shores
Could yield them no retreat.

Long time a breeding-place they sought,
Till both grew vexed and tired;
At length a ship arriving brought
The good so long desired.

A ship? -- could such a restless thing 
Afford them place of rest?
Or was the merchant charged to bring
The homeless birds a nest?

Hush! -- silent hearers profit most,--
This racer of the sea
Proved kinder to them than the coast,
It served them with a tree.

But such a tree! 'twas shaven deal,
The tree they call a mast,
And had a hollow with a wheel
Through which the tackle passed.

Within that cavity aloft 
Their roofless home they fixed,
Formed with materials neat and soft,
Bents, wool, and feathers mixed.

Four ivory eggs soon pave its floor,
With russet specks bedight;
The vessel weighs, forsakes the shore,
And lessens to the sight.

The mother-bird is gone to sea,
As she had changed her kind;
But goes the male? Far wiser he
Is doubtless left behind.

No;-- soon as from ashore he saw
The winged mansion move,
He flew to reach it, by a law
Of never-failing love.

Then perching at his consort's side,
Was briskly borne along,
The billows and the blast defied,
And cheered her with a song.

The seaman with sincere delight
His feathered shipmates eyes,
Scarce less exulting in the sight 
Than when he tows a prize.



And from a chance so new
Each some approaching good divines,
And may his hope be true!

Hail, honoured land! a desert where 
Not even birds can hide,
Yet parent of this loving pair
Whom nothing could divide.

And ye who, rather than resign
Your matrimonial plan,
Were not afraid to plough the brine
In company with man;

For whose lean country much disdain
We English often show,
Yet from a richer nothing gain
But wantonness and woe;

Be it your fortune, year by year,
The same resource to prove,
And may ye, sometimes landing here,
Instruct us how to love

Few days ago at midnight 
I was lying on my bed 
But I could sleep no longer
As if someone hit my head. 

The moon was shining bright in the sky 
And peeping through my window.
When I looked at the sky 
I saw a nice fairy dancing like a roe. 

I was fascinated by her magical beauty.
She was singing a melody so sweetly.
It was telling her sad love story 
Which touched my heart so badly. 

She was a lovelorn fairy 
Whose heart was filled with holy love.
Listening to her sweet melody
I flew there on my wings like a dove. 

She was so thirsty for sacred love.
She said- somebody broke her holy earth.
So she needed a sweet angel 
Who would caress her tender heart. 

I said 'May I be your sweetheart? 
I will never hurt you my dear.
I will cure your broken heart 
With my love's magical power.'

Then I was made her sweet angel
And she became happy with my affinity.
Now nobody can hurt our hearts 
As we soar in the sky of love and beauty. 

Thought about her children and country
But suddenly some witchy thoughts fell on her
She thought how to be famous or notorious
She applied some powers
Experimented some hours
At last she resolved some supernatural ideas
To get some multi levels benefits
To be of internationally massacrers
Now she is rearing some hounds and apes
With some poisonous knives and pipes
For easy murdering, raping, firing, burning.

I.
She was an aged woman; and the years
Which she had numbered on her toilsome way
Had bowed her natural powers to decay.
She was an aged woman; yet the ray
Which faintly glimmered through her starting tears, 
Pressed into light by silent misery,
Hath soul's imperishable energy.
She was a cripple, and incapable
To add one mite to gold-fed luxury:
And therefore did her spirit dimly feel 
That poverty, the crime of tainting stain,
Would merge her in its depths, never to rise again.

II.
One only son's love had supported her.
She long had struggled with infirmity,
Lingering to human life-scenes; for to die, 
When fate has spared to rend some mental tie,
Would many wish, and surely fewer dare.
But, when the tyrant's bloodhounds forced the child
For his cursed power unhallowed arms to wield--
Bend to another's will--become a thing
More senseless than the sword of battlefield--
Then did she feel keen sorrow's keenest sting;
And many years had passed ere comfort they would bring.

III.
For seven years did this poor woman live
In unparticipated solitude. 
Thou mightst have seen her in the forest rude
Picking the scattered remnants of its wood.
If human, thou mightst then have learned to grieve.
The gleanings of precarious charity
Her scantiness of food did scarce supply. 
The proofs of an unspeaking sorrow dwelt
Within her ghastly hollowness of eye:
Each arrow of the season's change she felt.
Yet still she groans, ere yet her race were run,
One only hope: it was—once more to see her son. 

IV.
It was an eve of June, when every star
Spoke peace from Heaven to those on earth that live.
She rested on the moor. 'Twas such an eve
When first her soul began indeed to grieve:
Then he was here; now he is very far. 
The sweetness of the balmy evening
A sorrow o'er her aged soul did fling,
Yet not devoid of rapture’s mingled tear:
A balm was in the poison of the sting.
This aged sufferer for many a year 
Had never felt such comfort. She suppressed
A sigh--and turning round, clasped William to her breast!

V.
And, though his form was wasted by the woe
Which tyrants on their victims love to wreak,
Though his sunk eyeballs and his faded cheek 
Of slavery's violence and scorn did speak,
Yet did the aged woman's bosom glow.
The vital fire seemed re-illumed within
By this sweet unexpected welcoming.
Oh, consummation of the fondest hope 
That ever soared on Fancy's wildest wing!
Oh, tenderness that foundst so sweet a scope!
Prince who dost pride thee on thy mighty sway,
When THOU canst feel such love, thou shalt be great as they!

VI.
Her son, compelled, the country's foes had fought, 
Had bled in battle; and the stern control
Which ruled his sinews and coerced his soul
Utterly poisoned life's unmingled bowl,
And unsubduable evils on him brought.
He was the shadow of the lusty child 
Who, when the time of summer season smiled,
Did earn for her a meal of honesty,
And with affectionate discourse beguiled
The keen attacks of pain and poverty;
Till Power, as envying her this only joy,
From her maternal bosom tore the unhappy boy.

VII.
And now cold charity's unwelcome dole
Was insufficient to support the pair;
And they would perish rather than would bear
The law's stern slavery, and the insolent stare 
With which law loves to rend the poor man's soul--
The bitter scorn, the spirit-sinking noise
Of heartless mirth which women, men, and boys
Wake in this scene of legal misery.

Oh! tell me a tale of the airly days--
Of the times as they ust to be;
'Piller of Fi-er' and 'Shakespeare's Plays'
Is a' most too deep fer me!
I want plane facts, and I want plane words,
Of the good old-fashioned ways,
When speech run free as the songs of birds
'Way back in the airly days.

Tell me a tale of the timber-lands--
Of the old-time pioneers;
Somepin' a pore man understands
With his feelins's well as ears.
Tell of the old log house,--about
The loft, and the puncheon flore--
The old fi-er-place, with the crane swung out,
And the latch-string thrugh the door.

Tell of the things jest as they was--
They don't need no excuse!--
Don't tech 'em up like the poets does,
Tel theyr all too fine fer use!--
Say they was 'leven in the fambily--
Two beds, and the chist, below,
And the trundle-beds that each helt three,
And the clock and the old bureau.

Then blow the horn at the old back-door
Tel the echoes all halloo,
And the childern gethers home onc't more,
Jest as they ust to do:
Blow fer Pap tel he hears and comes,
With Tomps and Elias, too,
A-marchin' home, with the fife and drums
And the old Red White and Blue!

Blow and blow tel the sound draps low
As the moan of the whipperwill,
And wake up Mother, and Ruth and Jo,
All sleepin' at Bethel Hill:
Blow and call tel the faces all
Shine out in the back-log's blaze,
And the shadders dance on the old hewed wall
As they did in the airly days. 

A WIT, transported with Inditing, 
Unpay'd, unprais'd, yet ever Writing; 
Who, for all Fights and Fav'rite Friends, 
Had Poems at his Fingers Ends; 
For new Events was still providing; 
Yet now desirous to be riding, 
He pack'd-up ev'ry Ode and Ditty 
And in Vacation left the City; 
So rapt with Figures, and Allusions, 
With secret Passions, sweet Confusions; 
With Sentences from Plays well-known, 
And thousand Couplets of his own; 
That ev'n the chalky Road look'd gay, 
And seem'd to him the Milky Way. 
But Fortune, who the Ball is tossing, 
And Poets ever will be crossing, 
Misled the Steed, which ill he guided, 
Where several gloomy Paths divided. 
The steepest in Descent he follow'd, 
Enclos'd by Rocks, which Time had hollow'd; 
Till, he believ'd, alive and booted, 
He'd reach'd the Shades by Homer quoted. 
But all, that he cou'd there discover, 
Was, in a Pit with Thorns grown over, 
Old Mammon digging, straining, sweating, 
As Bags of Gold he thence was getting; 
Who, when reprov'd for such Dejections 
By him, who liv'd on high Reflections, 
Reply'd; Brave Sir, your Time is ended, 
And Poetry no more befriended. 

I hid this Coin, when Charles was swaying; 
When all was Riot, Masking, Playing; 
When witty Beggars were in fashion, 
And Learning had o'er-run the Nation, 
But, since Mankind is so much wiser, 
That none is valued like the Miser, 
I draw it hence, and now these Sums 
In proper Soil grow up to { Plumbs;
Which gather'd once, from that rich Minute 
We rule the World, and all that's in it. 

 But, quoth the Poet,can you raise, 
As well as Plumb-trees, Groves of Bays? 
Where you, which I wou'd chuse much rather, 
May Fruits of Reputation gather? 
Will Men of Quality, and Spirit, 
Regard you for intrinsick Merit? 
And seek you out, before your Betters, 
For Conversation, Wit, and Letters? 

 Fool, quoth the Churl, who knew no Breeding; 
Have these been Times for such Proceeding? 
Instead of Honour'd, and Rewarded, 
Are you not Slighted, or Discarded? 
What have you met with, but Disgraces? 
Your PRIOR cou'd not keep in Places; 
And your VAN-BRUG had found no Quarter, 
But for his dabbling in the Morter. 
ROWE no Advantages cou'd hit on, 
Till Verse he left, to write North-Briton. 
PHILIPS, who's by the Shilling known, 
Ne'er saw a Shilling of his own. 
Meets { PHILOMELA, in the Town 
Her due Proportion of Renown? 
What Pref'rence has ARDELIA seen, 
T'expel, tho' she cou'd write the Spleen? 
Of Coach, or Tables, can you brag, 
Or better Cloaths than Poet RAG? 
Do wealthy Kindred, when they meet you, 
With Kindness, or Distinction, greet you? 

Or have your lately flatter'd Heroes 
Enrich'd you like the Roman Maroes? 

 No–quoth the Man of broken Slumbers: 
Yet we have Patrons for our Numbers; 
There are Mecaenas's among 'em. 

 Quoth Mammon,pray Sir, do not wrong 'em; 
But in your Censures use a Conscience, 
Nor charge Great Men with thriftless Nonsense: 
Since they, as your own Poets sing, 
Now grant no Worth in any thing 
But so much Money as 'twill bring. 
Then, never more from your Endeavours 
Expect Preferment, or less Favours. 
But if you'll 'scape Contempt, or worse, 
Be sure, put Money in your Purse; 
Money! which only can relieve you 
When Fame and Friendship will deceive you. 

Sir, (quoth the Poet humbly bowing, 
And all that he had said allowing) 
Behold me and my airy Fancies 
Subdu'd, like Giants in Romances. 
I here submit to your Discourses; 
Which since Experience too enforces, 
I, in that solitary Pit, 
Your Gold withdrawn, will hide my Wit: 
Till Time, which hastily advances, 
And gives to all new Turns and Chances, 
Again may bring it into use; 
Roscommons may again produce; 
New Augustean Days revive, 
When Wit shall please, and Poets thrive. 
Till when, let those converse in private, 
Who taste what others don't arrive at; 
Yielding that Mammonists surpass us; 
And let the Bank out-swell Parnassus. 

The hands of the clock were reaching high
In an old midtown hotel;
I name no name, but its sordid fame
Is table talk in hell.
I name no name, but hell's own flame
Illumes the lobby garish,
A gilded snare just off Times Square
For the maidens of the parish.

The revolving door swept the grimy floor
Like a crinoline grotesque,
And a lowly bum from an ancient slum
Crept furtively past the desk.
His footsteps sift into the lift
As a knife in the sheath is slipped,
Stealthy and swift into the lift
As a vampire into a crypt.

Old Maxie, the elevator boy,
Was reading an ode by Shelley,
But he dropped the ode as it were a toad
When the gun jammed into his belly.
There came a whisper as soft as mud
In the bed of an old canal:
"Take me up to the suite of Pinball Pete,
The rat who betrayed my gal


The lift doth rise with groans and sighs
Like a duchess for the waltz,
Then in middle shaft, like a duchess daft,
It changes its mind and halts.
The bum bites lip as the landlocked ship
Doth neither fall nor rise,
But Maxie the elevator boy
Regards him with burning eyes.
"First, to explore the thirteenth floor,"
Says Maxie, "would be wise


Quoth the bum, "There is moss on your double cross,
I have been this way before,
I have cased the joint at every point,
And there is no thirteenth floor.
The architect he skipped direct
From twelve unto fourteen,
There is twelve below and fourteen above,
And nothing in between,
For the vermin who dwell in this hotel
Could never abide thirteen


Said Max, "Thirteen, that floor obscene,
Is hidden from human sight;
But once a year it doth appear,
On this Walpurgis Night.
Ere you peril your soul in murderer's role,
Heed those who sinned of yore;
And onto the thirteenth floor,
Where those they slew, a grisly crew,
Reproach them forevermore.

"We are higher than twelve and below fourteen,"
Said Maxie to the bum,
"And the sickening draft that taints the shaft
Is a whiff of kingdom come.
The sickening draft that taints the shaft
Blows through the devil's door!"
And he squashed the latch like a fungus patch,
And revealed the thirteenth floor.

It was cheap cigars like lurid scars
That glowed in the rancid gloom,
The murk was a-boil with fusel oil
And the reek of stale perfume.
And round and round there dragged and wound
A loathsome conga chain,
The square and the hep in slow lock step,
The slayer and the slain.
(For the souls of the victims ascend on high,
But their bodies below remain.)

The clean souls fly to their home in the sky,
But their bodies remain below
To pursue the Cain who each has slain
And harry him to and fro.
When life is extinct each corpse is linked
To its gibbering murderer,
As a chicken is bound with wire around
The neck of a killer cur.

Handcuffed to Hate come Doctor Waite
(He tastes the poison now),
And Ruth and Judd and a head of blood
With horns upon its brow.
Up sashays Nan with her feathery fan
From Floradora bright;
She never hung for Caesar Young
But she's dancing with him tonight.

Here's the bulging hip and the foam-flecked lip
Of the mad dog, Vincent Coll,
And over there that ill-met pair,
Becker and Rosenthal,
Here's Legs and Dutch and a dozen such
Of braggart bullies and brutes,
And each one bends 'neath the weight of friends
Who are wearing concrete suits.

Now the damned make way for the double-damned
Who emerge with shuffling pace
From the nightmare zone of persons unknown,
With neither name nor face.
And poor Dot King to one doth cling,
Joined in a ghastly jig,
While Elwell doth jape at a goblin shape
And tickle it with his wig.

See Rothstein pass like breath on a glass,
The original Black Sox kid;
He riffles the pack, riding piggyback
On the killer whose name he hid.
And smeared like brine on a slavering swine,
Starr Faithful, once so fair,
Drawn from the sea to her debauchee,
With the salt sand in her hair.

And still they come, and from the bum
The icy sweat doth spray;
His white lips scream as in a dream,
If ever I meet with Pinball Pete
I will not seek his gore,
Lest a treadmill grim I must trudge with him
On the hideous thirteenth floor


"For you I rejoice," said Maxie's voice,
"And I bid you go in peace,
But I am late for a dancing date
That nevermore will cease.
So remember, friend, as your way you wend,
That it would have happened to you,
But I turned the heat on Pinball Pete;
You see - I had a daughter, too!"

The bum reached out and he tried to shout,
But the door in his face was slammed,
And silent as stone he rode down alone
From the floor of the double-damned. 

To the heavens they would rise
my yarns, excuses, alibis. 
Such tall tales I could tell
and all constructed very well
I built them grand and I kept them neat
enjoying life in the penthouse suite
so imagine my surprise
when I tripped on one small lie
I bumbled, 
I stumbled 
and over the edge I tumbled
flailing past my fabled glories
I've fallen now - stories! 
hey! 
I think at that, a reader laughed
and gave me a nice updraft! 
I need another, very fast! 
the distance to the truth now halved! 
I sense a smile.. and there - a grin! 
Thank you!  I'm going up again! 
Wonderful lady, kindly sir
never more will I err
your mercy I will long remember
Re-elect me this Novembeeer

A tapestry of energy
encircles me

The glamor of the sun on old tin roofs.
I wonder why the moment seems so lost? 
Long shadows follow summer into time.
The taste of going is the taste of wine.

How intricate to trace rhythmical moves
Into the deepening dusk of old. 

lost loves.
West has become the circle of our suns.
Friend, light itself will see the patterns home.

Salt of tears on lips
Astringent on spirit, 
Heart- bitter sweet-I rest my cheek upon your freckled thigh
and smell the salty softness of your skin.
I hear you grunt, asleep and musty warm
enjoying softness of oblivion.

I take you in my mouth, all dormouse curled
taste each curly lettuce nook and cranny.
I play you sotte voce like a flute -
you rise in a half hearted sort of way.

How sweet it is to let my senses ride, 
to pause, to take my time and feast my eyes.
When morrow comes you’ll rise and shine again -
For now, let me enjoy the tenderness. 

Do dropp by and say hello
I am sitting here, your presence will do

A tea for two sounds great
Before leaving the heat to beat

A tea for two, you want it hot or cold? 



Just kidding.. 

now get a cuppa. 

it is steaming hot
Bye for now, enjoy your day, come back to this same spot ! ! 

Oh! 
my friend

long ago
two small
girls

tea party

Last night
one
did not
attend 

the other

tea

then
refilled
her cup
with

tears.

Lighten-up on the Tea Party 
Might be a bigoted sign 
.. 

Accusing Tea Party 
Of a bigoted mind 

.. 

In taunts presumed 
Toward ethnic folk 
Fried chicken.. 

barbecue 
. . 

Watermelon jokes 

Consider America's heartland 
.  

Nary a Black Man around 
Yet barbecue.. 

watermelon 
Kentucky Fried Chicken abound 
* 
* 
Once pondering the facts 
Seems a prejudiced sign 
.  

Accusing.. 

Tea Party 
Of that bigoted Mind


Teachers are always a venerable sort, 
Happy that I belong to that ‘special’ lot, 
Instilling in young ones - 
newer insights gleaned, 
Enriching their lives - 
with atoms of knowledge pooled, 
Brightening their paths - 
with millions of lanterns lit, 
Rowing them away - 
from the perilous shoals of life, 
And leading them to be anchored
on safer shores! 
A teacher sure stands taller above, 
Every other mortal who serves! ! 

She/he has to play all at once, myriad roles, 
More of a mentor and not just a tutor, 
A physician who heals, a nurse who tends, 
A parent who cares or a pal who shares, 
A patron who supports or a lawyer who argues, 
A scholar who learns and a master who trains.

Numerous are the guise she/he has to don, 
And cleverer the tricks she/he has to play, 
To tackle the wards in her/his all out care, 
And launch them out into a world to fare.

with parables many, 
As Socrates instructed the youth - 
through endless queries, 
As Sullivan led Keller -  
to the new dawn of light, 
As Aesop enlightened the kids - 
with countless tales, 
I strive to be a TEACHER.
An erudite soul with a mission! 
A sculptor who sees an angel, 
veiled within a rock! 
An architect building an edifice, 
to last a life time! 
A warrior uncompromising in war, 
On Ignorance – the most ignoble foe! 

I don’t know where I presently stand, 
Nor do I know how my students rate me, 
Though often floundered or failed to act, 
In the manner I ever so longed to do, 
I would rather be a TEACHER all my life, 
A ‘guru’ out and out, from hilt to heel! 

Though seldom seen in due deference, 
And the integrity often called to question, 
Still with pride, would I wear the mantle, 
Of a ‘Guru’ for all eyes to see

To me you are more than just a teacher.



To my heart you are more than just a lover.



To my mind you are more than just a human.



To my intelligence, you are more than just matter.



To my soul you are more than just an indvidual.



You are inside me.

You are of me.

You are me.



This you will never know, 

& this I will never tell.





What you are to me, 

you will never know.



What I am to you, 

I will never know.





I shall use the secret, 

To unravel this secret.



I shall admire you in secret, 

I shall mentally lust you in secret.





In the arena of nothingness we shall later gather.

In the field of Earth we shall now ponder.



Ponder, what is all the pretence about.

Ponder, why souls cannot reunite as one.





In you, I will defy all morality.

In you, I will accept all sensuality.



That is the time we no longer will appear so separate, 

That is the time I await with gaping breath. 







Teacher, you've taught all, the academics of life.

Teacher, you've yet to be taught, to love with all your life.



Open your heart, & accept this lesson.

Close your mind, & propose no cynical question.



To be a teacher of a student is of great virtue, 

But to be a student of that very student is nothing, 

but a guaranteed trip to eternal wisdom. 


Blessed I am to provide knowledge to those
Who seek the same from me and chose! 

Conscious am I of my role as a teacher
Sure to guide my students as a preacher! 

Help me improve my knowledge full
To do my duty noble with all my skill! 

School is my temple, I am a servant
Make them strong pillars of society
On whom will rest the edifice of nobility
Millions will sing the song of unity
Sure the Mother Earth will prosper to eternity

I would not exchange the sorrows of my heart 
For the joys of the multitude.
And I would not have the tears that sadness makes 
To flow from my every part turn into laughter. 

I would that my life remain a tear and a smile.

A tear to purify my heart and give me understanding
Of life's secrets and hidden things. 
A smile to draw me nigh to the sons of my kind and 
To be a symbol of my glorification of the gods.

A tear to unite me with those of broken heart; 
A smile to be a sign of my joy in existence.

I would rather that I died in yearning and longing than that I live Weary and despairing.

I want the hunger for love and beauty to be in the 
Depths of my spirit,for I have seen those who are 
Satisfied the most wretched of people. 
I have heard the sigh of those in yearning and Longing, and it is sweeter than the sweetest melody.

With evening's coming the flower folds her petals 
And sleeps, embracingher longing. 
At morning's approach she opens her lips to meet 
The sun's kiss.

The life of a flower is longing and fulfilment.
A tear and a smile.

The waters of the sea become vapor and rise and come 
Together and area cloud.

And the cloud floats above the hills and valleys 
Until it meets the gentle breeze, then falls weeping 
To the fields and joins with brooks and rivers to Return to the sea, its home.

The life of clouds is a parting and a meeting. 
A tear and a smile.

And so does the spirit become separated from 
The greater spirit to move in the world of matter 
And pass as a cloud over the mountain of sorrow 
And the plains of joy to meet the breeze of death 
And return whence it came.


Caress, caress, and very close to granny, 
Give a pretty lovely rose to granny, 
Sweet are flowers, sweeter are the buds, 
Fly round her like the tweeting birds, 
She likes butterflies dancing on her face, 
Caress, caress and enjoy pink glace.

Darkness of aging needs twinkles and shines, 
We know your taste and your favorite dines, 
With all the stars Oh Moon! Come tonight, 
Cress, caress, we shall enjoy your sight, 
We shall sing and dance and dine with delight, 
You can make our home so lovely and bright.

Your granny is famous for her lovely dishes, 
Have blessings sweethearts and hearty wishes, 
You have forgotten it so let me remind, 
How painful is old age how cruel and unkind! 
It's birthday of your granny she needs gift of love, 
Run like a tiger or you may fly like a dove, 

But you must come tonight otherwise old clay! 
She will not celebrate her lonely birthday! 

I see the Earth and its happy brood
And everything around in a sunny mood
But in my cage sits a single bird
So lonely without a companion of her own breed

Though the sky and its expanse to her, long denied
In her narrow cage, she was never annoyed
She had a partner to share her joy and woe
With him, all else she was ready to fore go

There they made a haven unknown to pain
Shut the door to wind and rain
Sat together rubbing shoulders and preening feathers
Never did they mind their freedom bound by tethers

Now she feels she has lost her way
With her mate absent to cheer her day
With the break of dawn, once as she rose from sleep
Lay her ‘man’ motionless- a feathered heap

With her beak, she pecked and prodded him
Went on nudging and poking, sitting on the cage’s rim
But Alas! He didn’t stir or move
She tried in vain but finally got the painful clue

Sitting close to him, making a strange sound
She made it known that her man would no more be around
Never expected her life would suddenly take a turn this way
And never ever thought her companion would thus slip away

When his body from the cage was removed
She beat her wings as if in sorrow drowned
Thereafter she didn’t peck at the grains served
And for days opted out to remain starved

I thought her sorrow would soon end
And his separation wouldn’t leave a deep dent
But each day, gloom overcasts the teary eyed widow
And she sits blubbering looking through her window

Her lonesome state leaves me so agitated
I don’t want to see her any more isolated
I shall let her fly into the freedom of the sky
With new companions, let her soar high

When the morning star, 
Sees first sun ray, 
And disappears, 
In grief and distress, 
Gives a parting kiss, 
To the nude lady, 
Who takes her bath, 
Every early morning, 
In the sea of fire, 
And once again, 
Like a virgin in tact, 
Likes a teen-aged beauty, 
Flying high in sky, 
The fine wet grass, 
Licking milky foot, 
Ask birds to rise, 
And sing their song, 
Asks flowers and buds, 
To change night suits, 
And moves to the bank, 
And sits nimble footed, 
Partly on the earth, 
And partly in river, 
A cold, pleasant wind, 
And the swinging trees, 
Having watched this porn, 
Smile and discuss, 
The body of the lady, 
And a naughty blow, 
Pulls the shying buds
In the cover of leaves, 
And kisses their petals, 
The sunflower rises, 
And turns his face, 
Towards the sun, 
For a new warm-up, 
And somewhere far, 
A boy with animals, 
All domestic, 
And romantic, 
With a watching dog, 
Plays the bamboo pipe, 
Fishermen with the nets, 
Start their fishing, 
I find everyone, 
So happy and enjoying, 
The gift of life. 

On the bank but other, 
Other side of river, 
I see someone, 
A girl of sixteen, 
Seventeen or so, 
In a white dressing, 
No smile on her face, 
Undressed long hair, 
Wearing no jewelry, 
Looking motionless, 
Starring in space. 
Somebody told me, 
A widow is she, 
Only after one month, 
After her marriage, 
Her spouse was killed, 
In a deadly war, 
Futile and fruitless. 

This land of ours has a hoary culture
Fell into the hands of a hungry vulture
Lost its glory to be retrieved in future
Registered freedom without much of a rupture! 

Natives were looked down with frown
Treating them as not more than clown
An English was born with name of Brown
adorned the native language with lovely crown! 

Telugu tongue is great and sweet
Lyrics and literature vast and deep
To unearth the meaning tough and steep
BROWN made us learn with peace and ease! 

Learnt the language with love nad passion
Spread its fragrance with vision and mission
Made us look with sense of shame and admiration
Inspired us through his boundless dedication! 

Effective tool of learning is dictionary
Brought out the same with zeal of a missionary
Sure was a treasure to the posterity
One can quote it with a sense of authority! 

Lived his life as a TELUGU SAGE
In all his service in the center stage
Service offered in golden page
Ever green in our hearts is his noble image

A temporary man
can
be a good distraction
when filled with action
of the physical sort, 
a real sporty sport.
Any port in a storm, 
so they say.

But

a permanent man
can
be a true mate, 
her best friend
who's willing to lend
a helping hand
day or night, 
do what's right, 
hold her tight
and just love her, 
and love her, 
and love her. 


forever. 

I am naïve about relationships and kisses, 
About the dreams that weave themselves 
Around a fragile heart, 
And I do not know how to protect
Myself from love.

Emotional before photographs of you, 
I break like pottery to see you smile, 
I crumble like autumn leaves
In a child’s hand
To remember your shimmering brown hair
And the perfection of your neck
That someone else touches.

And I have also lingered lost in thought
About the lighter brown hair of another girl
Who captivated me for a moment, but less excruciatingly: 
I nearly fell in love with your best friend
To merely hear her speak your name; 
No one will ever understand how much
Those lovely vowels and consonants mean to me.

I need to be granted a tender reprieve
From the languishing agony of not seeing you, 
To be set free from the prison of sunless days
Where perfume no longer lingers upon a pillow, 
Where flowers fail to form beautiful bouquets
Because I don’t know the way to bring them to you. 

He sang a tenor’s part-

No more a tenor really

Though aging cords may gamely try

It was disaster- nearly.

 

He lost the lyric line.

Poor fellow –must be blasted

Too much North Fork wine

Or maybe he’s just past it.

 

A singer lost for words

is clearly up against it.

A staircase that’s collapsing

can only be descended.

 

Some forty years or more have past

Since he sang at their Wedding

A rose cheeked boy with strong clear tones

He was, then, worth the hearing.

 

With time his talent vanishes

He cannot compensate

For lyrics he’s forgotten

And notes he cannot make.

 

His hopes to leave on a better note

Then disappeared completely, 

Only a swan- at its last-

can be sure to sing more sweetly.(Being the philosophy of many Soldiers.) 


Sit on the bed; I'm blind, and three parts shell,
Be careful; can't shake hands now; never shall.
Both arms have mutinied against me -- brutes.
My fingers fidget like ten idle brats. 

I tried to peg out soldierly -- no use!
One dies of war like any old disease.
This bandage feels like pennies on my eyes.
I have my medals? --  Discs to make eyes close.
My glorious ribbons? --  Ripped from my own back
In scarlet shreds.  (That's for your poetry book.) 

A short life and a merry one, my brick!
We used to say we'd hate to live dead old, --
Yet now . . . I'd willingly be puffy, bald,
And patriotic.  Buffers catch from boys
At least the jokes hurled at them.  I suppose
Little I'd ever teach a son, but hitting,
Shooting, war, hunting, all the arts of hurting.
Well, that's what I learnt, -- that, and making money.
Your fifty years ahead seem none too many?
To help myself to nothing more than air!
One Spring!  Is one too good to spare, too long?
Spring wind would work its own way to my lung,
And grow me legs as quick as lilac-shoots.
My servant's lamed, but listen how he shouts!
When I'm lugged out, he'll still be good for that.
Here in this mummy-case, you know, I've thought
How well I might have swept his floors for ever,
I'd ask no night off when the bustle's over,
Enjoying so the dirt.  Who's prejudiced
Against a grimed hand when his own's quite dust,
Less live than specks that in the sun-shafts turn,
Less warm than dust that mixes with arms' tan?
I'd love to be a sweep, now, black as Town,
Yes, or a muckman.  Must I be his load? 

O Life, Life, let me breathe, -- a dug-out rat!
Not worse than ours the existences rats lead --
Nosing along at night down some safe vat,
They find a shell-proof home before they rot.
Dead men may envy living mites in cheese,
Or good germs even.  Microbes have their joys,
And subdivide, and never come to death,
Certainly flowers have the easiest time on earth.
"I shall be one with nature, herb, and stone

"
Shelley would tell me.  Shelley would be stunned;
The dullest Tommy hugs that fancy now.
"Pushing up daisies," is their creed, you know.
To grain, then, go my fat, to buds my sap,
For all the usefulness there is in soap.
D'you think the Boche will ever stew man-soup?
Some day, no doubt, if . . .
                              Friend, be very sure
I shall be better off with plants that share
More peaceably the meadow and the shower.
Soft rains will touch me, -- as they could touch once,
And nothing but the sun shall make me ware.
Your guns may crash around me.  I'll not hear;
Or, if I wince, I shall not know I wince.
Don't take my soul's poor comfort for your jest.
Soldiers may grow a soul when turned to fronds,
But here the thing's best left at home with friends. 

My soul's a little grief, grappling your chest,
To climb your throat on sobs; easily chased
On other sighs and wiped by fresher winds. 

Carry my crying spirit till it's weaned
To do without what blood remained these wounds.

'Now who shall say he loves me not.'

He wooed her first in an atmosphere
Of tender and low-breathed sighs;
But the pang of her laugh went cutting clear
To the soul of the enterprise;
'You beg so pert for the kiss you seek
It reminds me, John,' she said,
'Of a poodle pet that jumps to 'speak'
For a crumb or a crust of bread.'

And flashing up, with the blush that flushed
His face like a tableau-light,
Came a bitter threat that his white lips hushed
To a chill, hoarse-voiced 'Good night!'
And again her laugh, like a knell that tolled,
And a wide-eyed mock surprise,--
'Why, John,' she said, 'you have taken cold
In the chill air of your sighs!'

And then he turned, and with teeth tight clenched,
He told her he hated her,--
That his love for her from his heart he wrenched
Like a corpse from a sepulcher.
And then she called him 'a ghoul all red
With the quintessence of crimes'--
'But I know you love me now,' she said,
And kissed him a hundred times. 

I said of laughter: it is vain.
Of mirth I said: what profits it?
Therefore I found a book, and writ
Therein how ease and also pain,
How health and sickness, every one
Is vanity beneath the sun.

Man walks in a vain shadow; he
Disquieteth himself in vain.
The things that were shall be again;
The rivers do not fill the sea, 
But turn back to their secret source;
The winds too turn upon their course.

Our treasures moth and rust corrupt,
Or thieves break through and steal, or they
Make themselves wings and fly away.
One man made merry as he supped,
Nor guessed how when that night grew dim,
His soul would be required of him.

We build our houses on the sand
Comely withoutside and within; 
But when the winds and rains begin
To beat on them, they cannot stand;
They perish, quickly overthrown,
Loose from the very basement stone.

All things are vanity, I said:
Yea vanity of vanities.
The rich man dies; and the poor dies:
The worm feeds sweetly on the dead.
Whate'er thou lackest, keep this trust:
All in the end shall have but dust. 

The one inheritance, which best
And worst alike shall find and share:
The wicked cease from troubling there,
And there the weary are at rest;
There all the wisdom of the wise
Is vanity of vanities.

Man flourishes as a green leaf,
And as a leaf doth pass away;
Or as a shade that cannot stay,
And leaves no track, his course is brief: 
Yet doth man hope and fear and plan
Till he is dead:—oh foolish man!

Our eyes cannot be satisfied
With seeing, nor our ears be filled
With hearing: yet we plant and build
And buy and make our borders wide;
We gather wealth, we gather care,
But know not who shall be our heir.

Why should we hasten to arise
So early, and so late take rest? 
Our labour is not good; our best
Hopes fade; our heart is stayed on lies:
Verily, we sow wind; and we
Shall reap the whirlwind, verily.

He who hath little shall not lack;
He who hath plenty shall decay:
Our fathers went; we pass away;
Our children follow on our track:
So generations fail, and so
They are renewed, and come and go. 

The earth is fattened with our dead;
She swallows more and doth not cease:
Therefore her wine and oil increase
And her sheaves are not numbered;
Therefore her plants are green, and all
Her pleasant trees lusty and tall.

Therefore the maidens cease to sing,
And the young men are very sad;
Therefore the sowing is not glad,
And mournful is the harvesting. 
Of high and low, of great and small,
Vanity is the lot of all.

A King dwelt in Jerusalem;
He was the wisest man on earth;
He had all riches from his birth,
And pleasures till he tired of them;
Then, having tested all things, he
Witnessed that all are vanity. 

There is much I owe
to those I do not love.
The relief in accepting
they are closer to another.
Joy that I am not
the wolf to their sheep.
My peace be with them
for with them I am free,
and this, love can neither give,
nor know how to take.
I don't wait for them
from window to door.
Almost as patient
as a sun dial,
I understand
what love does not understand.
I forgive
what love would never have forgiven.
Between rendezvous and letter
no eternity passes,
only a few days or weeks.
My trips with them always turn out well.
Concerts are heard.
Cathedrals are toured.
Landscapes are distinct.
And when seven rivers and mountains
come between us,
they are rivers and mountains
well known from any map.
It is thanks to them
that I live in three dimensions,
in a non-lyrical and non-rhetorical space,
with a shifting, thus real, horizon.
They don't even know
how much they carry in their empty hands.
'I don't owe them anything',
love would have said
on this open topic. 

From brief delights that rise to me
Out of unfathomable dole,
I thank whatever gods there be
For mine unconquerable soul.
In the strong clutch of Circumstance
It has not winced, nor groaned aloud.
Before the blows of eyeless chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.
I front unfeared the threat of space
And dwindle into dark again.
My work is done, I take my place
Among the years that wait for men.
My life, my broken life must be
One unsuccourable dole.
I thank the gods- they gave to me 
A dauntless and defiant soul. 

Thanksgiving, appropriately hailed, 
Is a tradition that has long prevailed.    
Joining hearts to honor the day,  
Celebrating in a grateful way. 
 
Greeting the old, welcoming the new.  
Embracing kinfolks—not a few.  
Chatting, while putting names to faces. 
And humbly bowing to sweet graces. 
 
Then shooting photos—less we forget, 
And the moments fade, and we regret. 



My lovely companions, like Eve in Eden!
So much my treasure that all other wealth is without them
But dross and poverty.
Do they not adorn and beautify the World,
And gratify my Soul which hateth Solitude?
For which I praise Thy name;
A lover of company, a delighter in equals;
Replenish the inclination which Thyself hath implanted,
And give me eyes
To see the beauty of that life and comfort 
Wherewith those by their actions
Inspire the nations.
Their Markets, Tillage, Courts of Judicature, Marriages, Feasts and Assemblies, Navies Armies, Priests and Sabbaths, Trades and Business, the voice of the Bridegroom, Musical Instruments, the light of Candles, and the grinding of Mills
The riches of the land are all the materials of my felicity in their hands:
They are my Factors, Substitutes, and Stewards;
Second Selves, who by Trade and Business animate my wealth,
Which else would be dead and rust in my hands;
O how wonderful they then appear!
What Stars,
Enflaming Suns,
Enlarging Seas
Of Divine Affection,
Confirming Patterns,
Infusing Influence,
Do I feel in these!
Who are the shining light
Of all the land (to my very soul):
Wings and Streams
Carrying me unto Thee,
The Sea of Goodness from whence they came. 

Wherein to dwell;
A little house, whose humble roof
Is weather proof;
Under the spars of which I lie
Both soft and dry;
Where thou, my chamber for to ward,
Hast set a guard
Of harmless thoughts, to watch and keep
Me, while I sleep.
Low is my porch, as is my fate;
Both void of state;
And yet the threshold of my door
Is worn by th' poor,
Who thither come, and freely get
Good words, or meat.
Like as my parlour, so my hall
And kitchen's small;
A little buttery, and therein
A little bin,
Which keeps my little loaf of bread
Unchipt, unflead;
Some brittle sticks of thorn or briar
Make me a fire,
Close by whose living coal I sit,
And glow like it.
The pulse is thine,
And all those other bits that be
There placed by thee;
The worts, the purslain, and the mess
Of water-cress,
Which of thy kindness thou hast sent;
And my content
Makes those, and my beloved beet,
To be more sweet.
'Tis thou that crown'st my glittering hearth
With guiltless mirth,
And giv'st me wassail bowls to drink,
Spiced to the brink.
That soils my land,
And giv'st me, for my bushel sown,
Twice ten for one;
Thou mak'st my teeming hen to lay
Her egg each day;
Besides, my healthful ewes to bear
Me twins each year;
The while the conduits of my kine
Run cream, for wine:
All these, and better, thou dost send
Me, to this end,--
That I should render, for my part,
A thankful heart;
Which, fired with incense, I resign,
As wholly thine;
--But the acceptance, that must be,

Snow falls
in a most
disturbing way.


It falls from
the lungs of
dead musicians.


It is cruel
when it strikes the earth, 
more hungry than mean.


The snow is a dream.
And, almost, a call to prayer. 

There’s a wind up that licks like a flame,
And the sun is a porthole of hell.
Now evanish prim notions of shame,
And the craving to look rather well –
In pyjamas you’re never a swell,
And you’ve chosen some roomily made.
Oh! for ices these pangs to dispel –
It’s one hundred and nine in the shade!

We have limped in from tennis. That game ! –
I’d as soon with the damned where they dwell
Stoke a furnace and bathe in the same!
There’s no drink human craving to quell,
Not thin chablis nor sweet muscatel.
Never more shall we see, I’m afraid,
The cool shallows, the pale asphodel.
It’s one hundred and nine in the shade.

You recline an invertebrate frame
In the moisture your atoms expel,
‘Gainst the fates very feebly declaim,
All too limp to rise up and rebel.
Action flies and mosquitoes compel.
We make pitiful fight ‘gainst the raid
With a cloying and nauseous smell
In one hundred and nine in the shade.

ENVOY
Here might solids of Hamlet dispel.
Quick the answer to prayer that he prayed.
Human flesh turns to dew ‘neath the spell
Of one hundred and nine in the shade. 

In  all  worthwhile  endeavors, 
No  matter  size  or  scope.
It  shall  either  have  a  life, 
Or  die,  a  thing  called  hope.

It  all  depends  on  caring.
Those  willing  to  take  part.
Hope,  to  be  sustained  at  all; 
Requires  a  beating  heart.

Has  value  each  in  turn.
When  called  upon  to  voice  it, 
Don't  shrink  from  your concern.

Its  in  those special  moments, 
When  life  gives  you  a   choice; 
You'll  either  sit  in  silence, 
Or  stand  and  lend  your  voice.

It's  with  the  inspiration  
Derived  from  what  you  do.
Others  may  participate  
And  make  your  dream  come  true.

If  you  need  inspiration
To  act  on  your  concern, 
Just  take  note  of  your  children, 
And  how  they  come  to  learn.

They  look  to  you  for  guidance, 
To  see  what  they  should  do.
How  to  be  a  citizen.
Concerned,  what  do  they  do? 

It's  now  your  time  for  choosing; 
Don't  sit, and  cry, and  mope.
It  shall  either  have  a  life, 
Or  die,  a  thing  called  hope. 

A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: 
Its lovliness increases; it will never 
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep 
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep 
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing. 
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing 
A flowery band to bind us to the earth, 
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth 
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days, 
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkn'd ways 
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all, 
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall 
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon, 
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon 
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils 
With the green world they live in; and clear rills 
That for themselves a cooling covert make 
'Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest brake, 
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms: 
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms 
We have imagined for the mighty dead; 
An endless fountain of immortal drink, 
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink. 

It is not in the pretty face
Nor is it in your alluring eyes
It is not in your suave gaze
Nor in virtual love spelling lies

It is not in body beautiful
Nor is it in flawless skin tone
It is not in diamonds or gold
Nor is it in costly dresses you own

It is in your fair character
It is in the beauty of your soul
It is in your child-like laughter
It is in your heart of gold

Your beauty is in who you are
Your love which is soulfully real
It is in the candle light in your heart
It is in the hero you make me feel

You are treasure I value most
You are one I cannot live apart

 unshine and roses and poppyseeds, 
Moonlight and starbright and little leaves, 
Music entwined in vacant tapestry, 
Warm touch, kind eyes, all of it for free.

Do not let the years go by
Never looking to the sky, 
The world is beauty and so why
Should we ever turn a blind eye.

Life is all we'll ever know, 
Amidst the rain, the sleet and all the snow, 
But all that water makes things grow, 
And after that we'll have a thing to show. 

The desert is dry
So is the hot blue sky, 
Rain would all renew
Yet, not a cloud is in view.

Desolation rises and falls
Leaving the thirst of discontent, 
As the needs of the heart
So dryly go unmet. 

Point your gun at my head
Play me till I drop dead
The worst of you will get the best of me

You can't get rid of me
Please won't you just love me
You touched my soul, now you can't just leave

Blow out my matches
Before you get burned
You thought but couldn't ditch the flames in my heart

Red roses in full bloom
Blood stains under the colourless moon
Ashes and knives, a thorny delight and bliss running through my veins

Waking up in the night
With you by my side
The peak of my life, a burnished white lie


It looks like forced entry
by a criminal hardened -
Where is the sentry 
who's guardin' my garden? 

He's a retired shepherd  
at the bare earth he gawks -
'Sir, it must've occurred
while I was watching the phlox! '

(and, yes, I do feel sheepish about submitting such a bad pun)It is very nice to think 
The world is full of meat and drink, 
With little children saying grace 

To die alone, with none beside thy bed
To ruffle round with sobs thy last word said
And mark with tears the pulses ebb from thee,--
By thy forsaken Sonship in the red
Drear wine-press,--by the wilderness out-spread,--
And the lone garden where thine agony
Fell bloody from thy brow,--by all of those
Permitted desolations, comfort mine !
No earthly friend being near me, interpose
No deathly angel 'twixt my face aud thine,
But stoop Thyself to gather my life's rose,
And smile away my mortal to Divine ! 'When life as opening buds is sweet, 
And golden hopes the fancy greet,
And Youth prepares his joys to meet,-
Alas! how hard it is to die!
When just is seized some valued prize,
And duties press, and tender ties
Forbid the soul from earth to rise,-
How awful then it is to die!
When, one by one, those ties are torn,
And friend from friend is snatched forlorn,
And man is left alone to mourn,-
Ah then, how easy 'tis to die!
When faith is firm, and conscience clear,
And words of peace the spirit cheer,
And visioned glories half appear,-
'Tis joy, 'tis triumph then to die.
When trembling limbs refuse their weight,
And films, slow gathering, dim the sight,
And clouds obscure the mental light,-
'Tis nature's precious boon to die. 

I think that all higher animals - primates, mammalian and ornithic pets, etc. 'think' to a certain extent.

Why do I think? 
There is no alternative.
I am condemned to think, 
To be obsessed with thinking—
But so is my dog. 

A thought went up my mind to-day
That I have had before,
But did not finish,--some way back,
I could not fix the year,

Nor where it went, nor why it came
The second time to me,
Nor definitely what it was,
Have I the art to say.

But somewhere in my soul, I know
I've met the thing before;
It just reminded me--'t was all--
And came my way no more. 

Thousands of desires, each worth dying for. 
Many of them I have realized.  

yet I yearn for more. 

Why should my killer (lover)  be afraid? No one will hold her responsible
For the blood which will continuously flow through my eyes all my life

We have heard about the dismissal of Adam from Heaven,
With a more humiliation, I am leaving the street on which you live. 

Oh tyrant, your true personality will be known to all
If the curls of my hair slip through my turban! 

But if someone wants to write her a letter, they can ask me,
Every morning I leave my house with my pen on my ear. 

In that age, I turned to drinking (alcohol) 
And then the time came when my entire world was occupied by alcohol

From whom I expected justice/praise for my weakness
Turned out to be more injured with the same cruel sword

When in love, there is little difference between life and death
We live by looking at the infidel who we are willing to die for

Put some pressure on your heart to remove that cruel arrow,
For if the arrow comes out, so will your heart.  

and your life.

For god's sake, don't lift the cover off any secrets you tyrant
The infidel might turn out to be my lover! 

The preacher and the bar's entrance are way apart
Yet I saw him entering the bar as I was leaving! 

Thousands of desires, each worth dying for. 
>Many of them I have realized.  

yet I yearn for more


A thousand Martyrs I have made, 
     All sacrific'd to my desire; 
A thousand Beauties have betray'd, 
     That languish in resistless Fire. 
The untam'd Heart to hand I brought, 
And fixt the wild and wandring Thought. 

I never vow'd nor sigh'd in vain 
     But both, thô false, were well receiv'd. 
The Fair are pleas'd to give us pain, 
     And what they wish is soon believ'd. 
And thô I talked of Wounds and Smart, 
Loves Pleasures only toucht my Heart. 

Alone the Glory and the Spoil 
     I always Laughing bore away; 
The Triumphs, without Pain or Toil, 
     Without the Hell, the Heav'n of Joy. 
And while I thus at random rove 
Despise the Fools that whine for Love. 

There's nothing you can sell me now
nothing you can tell me how: 
I've been drunk in old Mex, near death in southwest Tex; 
slept in the desert many nights through
right along side scorpions, mountain lions, 
javelinas too.
I've seen Mississippi where it burns
and Arizona, where I nearly did; 
I've ate rattlesnake, caribou and gator, 
stood alone in a mournful wind 
at the grave of Billy the Kid.
I've crossed Beartooth Pass in August
in knee deep snow, 
been lost in degree desert heat
with no water, and no idea of which way to go.
I've panned for silver, dug for gold, 
I was at the big cattle drive
when Montana turned years old; 
I've been chased by a boulder
down Bronco canyon on the run, 
flirted with a cow moose
protecting her young; 
Hung for dear life from a year old Bristlecone pine
on a narrow southwestern ridge, 
crossed a fifteen-hundred foot canyon
on an ancient rickety-rope bridge; 
I've stood amazed on a red-rock cliff
seeing the planet a hundred miles out, 
and the Colorado river so small, down below, 
that old muddy water was the earth's beautiful blood flow; 
I've come face to face
with grizzlies, a time or two, 
seen the veil between life and death
open up, for just a quick view; 
more than once thought
I'd pass through that door, 
in one of these wild tales I've had
traveling shore to shore; but
now have come to understand, before I'm here finished, 
I'll have a thousand more. 

yeah yeah, nothing for you to boast about –
‘good ones would be quite enough-
no, make that – who’s got time for more, 
even if they were masterpieces-’

So perhaps, merely a little quiet satisfaction
in a personal kinda way: I guess
retirement years hang heavily for some, 
recalling days of authority, command; 
others find them richer, busier than ever;  or
do just the same jobs as they did so well, except
they don’t get paid for it-

or you can put all your ego in one basket –
try to do the one thing well; after a life
of unfinished jobs and hasty jobs, 
and jobs you dreamed of and yet never did-

or, there’s poetry: if speech is actually the Word
that set the cosmos on its merry way, that
sings the praise of gods or human enterprise, or
draws attention to the sunlight on a wall; 
melts the heart; reveals, relates
the physical and the metaphysical; 
raises the spirits, lights the mind- then, 
poetry’s no bad thing
to sieve, to pour a lifetime into; 

and if, as the statistics state, 
of those poems get a reading, averaging
two people each, around the world and every day –
then perhaps, a little quiet pride, a hope
that something useful has been tried
in these last years on earth-

a small gift to the fleeting soul, 
the ferryman’s so solemn toll
to help it on its way; a fee
to offer; if that were, shall be, 
what’s appropriate.. 

I have lived life a thousand years
at that one moment
when i hid in our arms, 
as i looked in your eyes, 
i saw a million doves
in flight towards peace
and all that had to be said and
realized now unknown
all the memories of yesterday
faded into the oblivious
if i had another moment
only if i had another minute
to be loved like you loved
me yesterday
then i would have lived a
thousand years more
i would have died a 
thousand deaths more.A throe upon the features—
A hurry in the breath—
An ecstasy of parting
Denominated "Death"—

An anguish at the mention
Which when to patience grown,
I've known permission given
To rejoin its own. 

your heart beats shaped  in a sorrowful poem.. 

filled by the heat of a hot ZONE, .. 

the loneliness of a dawn.. 

the words apologize for it's paralysis.. 

while it has a thunder's sighing  feeling tone 

the silence speak in  presence of the beauty kingdom. .. 

A moment the wild swallows like a flight
  Of withered gust-caught leaves, serenely high,
  Toss in the windrack up the muttering sky.
  The leaves hang still. Above the weird twilight,
  The hurrying centres of the storm unite
  And spreading with huge trunk and rolling fringe,
  Each wheeled upon its own tremendous hinge, 
  Tower darkening on. And now from heaven's height,
  With the long roar of elm-trees swept and swayed,
 And pelted waters, on the vanished plain
 Plunges the blast. Behind the wild white flash
 That splits abroad the pealing thunder-crash,
 Over bleared fields and gardens disarrayed,
 Column on column comes the drenching rain. 

She wore a 'terra-cotta' dress,
And we stayed, because of the pelting storm,
Within the hansom's dry recess,
Though the horse had stopped; yea, motionless
We sat on, snug and warm.

Then the downpour ceased, to my sharp sad pain,
And the glass that had screened our forms before
Flew up, and out she sprang to her door:
I should have kissed her if the rain
Had lasted a minute more. 

You cannot be serious.
A dog with no chow.
A cat on its throne.
A forest screaming for its
A tide with no.
A day without a night becoming.
Tomorrow a tide becons for its shore.
A night never.
A week in
As the tide reaches out for its
A shore leave looking for.
Love in all the wrong..
{cont.}There was a tiger in the woods
Who was expert in finding his foods

In chasing holes, he was number one
So he would indulged in all kind of funs

Oft he would go alone for hunt
And killed his preys while making grunts

He used to share spoils with tigresses
And would also play with their tresses

The offal he would bring for his wife
Which she ate without complain or strife

One day she caught him sharing his spoils
And her blood suddenly came to a boil

She attacked in rage and tore his flesh
And tiger's wanton life was in mess 

He is yet to come out of the woods
And the tigress too is in sombre mood.

Even while I dreamed I prayed that what I saw was only fear and no foretelling,
for I saw the last known landscape destroyed for the sake 
of the objective, the soil bludgeoned, the rock blasted.
Those who had wanted to go home would never get there now.

I visited the offices where for the sake of the objective the planners planned
at blank desks set in rows. I visited the loud factories
where the machines were made that would drive ever forward
toward the objective. I saw the forest reduced to stumps and gullies; I saw
the poisoned river, the mountain cast into the valley;
I came to the city that nobody recognized because it looked like every other city.
I saw the passages worn by the unnumbered
footfalls of those whose eyes were fixed upon the objective.

Their passing had obliterated the graves and the monuments
of those who had died in pursuit of the objective
and who had long ago forever been forgotten, according
to the inevitable rule that those who have forgotten forget
that they have forgotten. Men, women, and children now pursued the objective
as if nobody ever had pursued it before.

The races and the sexes now intermingled perfectly in pursuit of the objective.
the once-enslaved, the once-oppressed were now free
to sell themselves to the highest bidder
and to enter the best paying prisons
in pursuit of the objective, which was the destruction of all enemies,
which was the destruction of all obstacles, which was the destruction of all objects,
which was to clear the way to victory, which was to clear the way to promotion, to salvation, to progress,
to the completed sale, to the signature
on the contract, which was to clear the way
to self-realization, to self-creation, from which nobody who ever wanted to go home
would ever get there now, for every remembered place
had been displaced; the signposts had been bent to the ground and covered over.

Every place had been displaced, every love
unloved, every vow unsworn, every word unmeant
to make way for the passage of the crowd
of the individuated, the autonomous, the self-actuated, the homeless
with their many eyes opened toward the objective
which they did not yet perceive in the far distance,
having never known where they were going,
having never known where they came from. 

There will come a time, 
     I feel that it's only destiny, 
     when I will not be able, strong  or  willing, 
     to walk the extra mile, 
     or bear the extra load.

          There will come a time, 
     I know that it's only destiny, 
     when I'll be free to venture in my mind, 
     because that's all that's left to me.

          I will be free of petty problems, 
     I will be free of common toil, 
     - - -  maybe wondering just where I am, 
     and having no control.

          There will come a time, 
     It seems as if it's destiny, 
     when trouble will not seek me out, 
     and engagements will not bind me.

          There will come a time, 
     when the children have to agonize, 
     about what to do with me! 
          I'll be old and cranky.  
     and just sittin' in the home, 
     if you really want to find me, 
     listening to old tunes, 
     drinking me some juice, 
     hating old -age benefits, 
     and just plain hangin' loose! 

          On the other hand  - - - 
     with any luck at all  - - - 
     I will have passed away by then, 
  
   and spent all of my money

A TIME

A time of tribulation great, 
Is coming to this world; 
A time of war and horror, 
To man will be unfurled. 

A time given to make peace, 
As men, man to man; 
A time that mere men forfeited, 
Opting war’s expedient plan. 

A time draws near in Israel, 
Of war with Iran; 
A time now heralds Lucifer, 
His holy war to fan. 

A time we, not too long ago, 
Fought wars to end all wars; 
A time of final war now looms; 
Damnation, sinful cause. 

A time, times and half a time, 
Daniel saw in a vision, 
A Time, three years and a half, 
And Jerusalem’s division. 

A time is here, with us now
Too late to turn around, 
A time that Prophets talked about, 
Forsaking hallowed ground. 

A time, when fallen men look back
Upon their sinful past; 
A time when mankind will recall, 
Babylonians-nuclear blast. 

Touching them, you sense
that beauty within you shall
also someday bloom. 

I am
your elfin fairy
a tiny dancer
with earthen eyes
a child-like
dream girl 
fit and agile 
fluttering
scented
nakedness
all around you

We 
met as 
two sparks 
One heart
igniting in
a connection
no words
can write
no reasoning
make sense of
only love
understands
 
We are
mirrors 
of the other
two passionate
creatives
full of warmth
and sparkling
inner wisdom
a touch of 
innocence 
our souls 
unite 
in love
we belong


The old wooden steps to the front door 
where I was sitting that fall morning 
when you came downstairs, just awake, 
and my joy at sight of you (emerging 
into golden day— 
the dew almost frost) 
pulled me to my feet to tell you 
how much I loved you: 


those wooden steps 
are gone now, decayed 
replaced with granite, 
hard, gray, and handsome. 
The old steps live 
only in me: 
my feet and thighs 
remember them, and my hands 
still feel their splinters. 


Everything else about and around that house 
brings memories of others—of marriage, 
of my son. And the steps do too: I recall 
sitting there with my friend and her little son who died, 
or was it the second one who lives and thrives? 
And sitting there ‘in my life,’ often, alone or with my husband. 
Yet that one instant, 
your cheerful, unafraid, youthful, ‘I love you too,’ 
the quiet broken by no bird, no cricket, gold leaves 
spinning in silence down without 
any breeze to blow them, 
is what twines itself 
in my head and body across those slabs of wood 
that were warm, ancient, and now 
wait somewhere to be burnt. 

Once a noon told me: 
Look, 
There is no horizon; 

I looked at, 
Really there was none.

And what a wonder!  
Immediate after that
I could see the noon pouring out 
As a heavy shower of rain; 

That was for the first time
I've watched a time showering. 

When a friend calls to me from the road 
And slows his horse to a meaning walk, 
I don't stand still and look around 
On all the hills I haven't hoed, 
And shout from where I am, What is it? 
No, not as there is a time to talk. 
I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground, 
Blade-end up and five feet tall, 
And plod: I go up to the stone wall 
For a friendly visit. 

My mind is my beloved, 
My identity and my essence; 
When it is missing
I am perplexed
Am experiencing vacuum within

Friendships and passions no longer are delighting
Humor and sweet chats with dear ones are gone; 
Pains, aches, disappointments in love
Are no more wrenching my heart; 
Heart's sweet rhythm and fast beats too are missing; 

Gay abandon with my sweet hearts
Is no longer desired; 
Their bewitching beauties
No more are angling; 
The rise and set of thought forms
And flow of joys and blissful experiences, 
All have ceased to happen

Now, when my mind has disappeared
Am deaf to sounds
Blind to sights
Insensitive to
Smells, sweet and bitter tastes, 
Amorous and loving touches, 
Cooling and warm hugs; 

Am not able to differentiate between
Full-moon and new moon nights; 
Among loving, indifferent and piercing looks

Perceptions, intuitions, 
Languages, 
Sciences, philosophies, 
Experiences, insight, understanding
Contemplations, remembrances
Gained, stored and recollected

Have vanished in the absence of my mind, 
The facilitator and companion of my life
Now I am, 
Frozen Ganges devoid of flow and current
A lover who lost his sweet heart
A flow of vacuum
Unconscious of Time and its flow


The days, invariably, quickly pass.
Natures care not to amend tiresome hours
Hiding, lurking, sleeping. Casting away
From mortal shores. Trespassing. Always gray.

Unmindful of colorful patterning
Lives, as a rule, require. Preservation
Of the soul in brilliant tapestries needs
Flowering crescendos, not boring weeds.

Denouement, in time-set twilight, seldom
Lights any spark to firework-light the skies.
Days, industriously speeding, passing, 
Of dullness impregnate the years. Massing, 

Becoming monsters we lustily bred
From colorless years. Mortality fed. 

A moment
In which you wish
For time
To stop
To cease
To freeze
To halt
To pause
And To stand still
Is A timeless moment. 
In which you 
Wish to live
All your joy's
And All your life's happiness
Without any fear. 


A timid grace sits trembling in her eye, 
As loath to meet the rudeness of men's sight, 
Yet shedding a delicious lunar light 
That steeps in kind oblivious ecstasy 
The care-crazed mind, like some still melody: 
Speaking most plain the thoughts which do possess 
Her gentle sprite: peace, and meek quietness, 
And innocent loves, and maiden purity: 
A look whereof might heal the cruel smart 
Of changed friends, or fortune's wrongs unkind: 
Might to sweet deeds of mercy move the heart 
Of him who hates his brethren of mankind. 
Turned are those lights from me, who fondly yet 
Past joys, vain loves, and buried hopes regret. 

Two men running for office 
disagree about everything 
but have one thing in common.
They won't release 
their tax returns.

The press is upset but 
the man on the corner
with a tin cup playing Mozart
on his violin doesn't care.
He has a sign that reads  
"Will work for food.'

Instead of asking 
candidates about their taxes
perhaps they should be asked   
how much they give to 
the poor who don't count
like the man on the corner
with a tin cup playing Mozart. 

Without the moon or stars to guide his sight, 
without a glint from shanties down below, 
he rested on the foggy hill that night, 
and begged the heavens for a tiny glow.

Despair turned into dream.  a little boat
with fishermen inside in search of faith, 
a boat which, neither sinking nor afloat, 
now blindly drifted past a drowning wraith.

And he among them, but incapable
of seeing a reflection in the waves, 
which lapped against the stormy parable
like hammers beating iron into staves.

But when he woke at dawn his eyes could see
light walking on the dew toward Galilee. 

Good words are like a string of pearls
That carries joy in all the curles

And bring to others to happiness door
Marked with joy, care, fun and more

So try to say nice things to all
Even if its a tiny word or small

For joy that will be left behind
Will surely spread happiness all kind

So put nice words together my dear
As it also shows how you care

And seek for hidden joy in curles
For good words are like a string of pearls. 

WHEN Princes and Prelates,
And hot-headed zealots,
A' Europe had set in a low, a low,
The poor man lies down,
Nor envies a crown,
And comforts himself as he dow, as he dow,
And comforts himself as he dow.


The black-headed eagle,
As keen as a beagle,
He hunted o'er height and o'er howe,
In the braes o' Gemappe,
He fell in a trap,
E'en let him come out as he dow, dow, dow,
E'en let him come out as he dow.
· · · · · · · But truce with commotions,
And new-fangled notions,
A bumper, I trust you'll allow;
Here's George our good king,
And lang may they ring as they dow, dow, dow,
And lang may they ring as they dow.

Thanks for being my life partner & my best friend. 

A toad can die of light!
   Death is the common right
     Of toads and men,--
   Of earl and midge
   The privilege.
     Why swagger then?
   The gnat's supremacy 
   Is large as thine. 

There's wine in the cup, Vancouver, 
 And there's warmth in my heart for you, 
While I drink to your health, your youth, and your wealth, 
 And the things that you yet will do. 
In a vintage rare and olden, 
 With a flavour fine and keen, 
Fill the glass to the edge, while I stand up to pledge 

Then here's a Ho! Vancouver, in wine of the bonniest hue, 
 With a hand on my hip and the cup at my lip, 
And a love in my life for you. 
 For you are a jolly good fellow, with a great, big heart, I know; 
So I drink this toast 
 

 Vancouver, here's a Ho! 

And here's to the days that are coming, 
 And here's to the days that are gone, 
And here's to your gold and your spirit bold, 
 And your luck that has held its own; 
And here's to your hands so sturdy, 
 And here's to your hearts so true, 
And here's to the speed of the day decreed 
 That brings me again to you. 

Then here's a Ho! Vancouver, in wine of the bonniest hue, 
 With a hand on my hip and the cup at my lip, 
And a love in my life for you. 
 For you are a jolly good fellow, with a great, big heart, I know; 
So I drink this toast 
 

 Vancouver, here's a Ho

See this bowl of purple wine, 
Life-blood of the lusty vine! 
All the warmth of summer suns 
In the vintage liquid runs, 
All the glow of winter nights 
Plays about its jewel lights, 
Thoughts of time when love was young 
Lurk its ruby drops among, 
And its deepest depths are dyed 
With delight of friendship tried. 
Worthy offering, I ween, 
Is the draught I pour to thee,-- 
Comfort of all misery, 
Single friend of the forlorn, 
Haven of all beings born, 
Hope when trouble wakes at night, 
And when naught delights, delight. 
Holy Death, I drink to thee; 
Do not part my friends and me. 
Take this gift, which for a night 
Puts dull leaden care to flight, 
Thou who takest grief away 
For a night and for a day. 

Nothing, this foam, virgin verse
Depicting the chalice alone:
Far off a band of Sirens drown
Many of them head first.

We sail, O my various
Friends, I already at the stern,
You at the lavish prow that churns
The lightning’s and the winters’ flood:

A sweet intoxication urges me
Despite pitching, tossing, fearlessly
To offer this toast while standing

Solitude, reef, and starry veil
To whatever’s worthy of knowing
The white anxiety of our sail. 

To happiness I raise my glass,
    The goal of every human,
  The hope of every clan and class
    And every man and woman.
  The daydreams of the urchin there,
  The sweet theme of the maiden's prayer,
    The strong man's one ambition,
  The sacred prize of mothers sweet,
  The tramp of soldiers on the street
    Have all the selfsame mission.
  Life here is nothing more or less
  Than just a quest for happiness.

  Some seek it on the mountain top,
    And some within a mine;
  The widow in her notion shop
    Expects its sun to shine.
  The tramp that seeks new roads to fare,
  Is one with king and millionaire
    In this that each is groping
  On different roads, in different ways,
  To come to glad, contented days,
    And shares the common hoping.
  The sound of martial fife and drum
  Is born of happiness to come.

  Yet happiness is always here
    Had we the eyes to see it;
  No breast but holds a fund of cheer
    Had man the will to free it.
  'Tis there upon the mountain top,
  Or in the widow's notion shop,
    'Tis found in homes of sorrow;
  'Tis woven in the memories
  Of happier, brighter days than these,
    The gift, not of to-morrow
  But of to-day, and in our tears
  Some touch of happiness appears.

  'Tis not a joy that's born of wealth:
    The poor man may possess it.
  'Tis not alone the prize of health:
    No sickness can repress it.
  'Tis not the end of mortal strife,
  The sunset of the day of life,
    Or but the old should find it;
  The touch divine in all we plan,
    And has the soul behind it.
  And so this toast to happiness,
  The seed of which we all possess. 

The faster you go, the higher you climb
The more resistance you bound to find
You may have the stamina and will to go
But someone official is saying no

The rules exist to protect the weak
The law of the land is all but a trick
To harness your energy and limit your power
The Status Quo is all it’s about

The ignorance feels like a warm fuzzy feeling
It’s all but impossible to break through glass ceiling
Taboos are invented and questions are banned
Forbidden, prohibited is my promised land

The laws of physics are the toughest of all
Just try to fly when you born to crawl
Let’s conquer the animal instincts we share
Salute to the bravest in human endeavor!

September ere's to the men! Since Adam's time 
     They've always been the same;
   Whenever anything goes wrong,
     The woman is to blame.
   From early morn to late at night,
     The men fault-finders are;
   They blame us if they oversleep,
     Or if they miss a car.
   They blame us if, beneath the bed,
    Their collar buttons roll;
  They blame us if the fire is out
    Or if there is no coal.
  They blame us if they cut themselves
    While shaving, and they swear
  That we're to blame if they decide
    To go upon a tear.

  Here's to the men, the perfect men!
    Who never are at fault;
  They blame us if they chance to get
    The pepper for the salt.
  They blame us if their business fails,
    Or back a losing horse;
  And when it rains on holidays
    The fault is ours, of course.
  They blame us when they fall in love,
    And when they married get;
  Likewise they blame us when they're sick,
    And when they fall in debt.
  For everything that crisscross goes
    They say we are to blame;
  But, after all, here's to the men,
    We love them just the same

I.

Oh Galuppi, Baldassaro, this is very sad to find!
I can hardly misconceive you; it would prove me deaf and blind;
But although I take your meaning, 'tis with such a heavy mind!

	II.

Here you come with all your music, and here's all the good it brings.
What, they lived once thus at Venice where the merchants were the kings,
Where Saint Mark's is, where the Doges used to wed the sea with rings?

	III.

Ay, because the sea's the street there; and 'tis arched by
what you call
.  Shylock's bridge with houses on it, where they kept the carnival:
I was never out of England---it's as if I saw it all.

	IV.

Did young people take their pleasure when the sea was warm in May?
Balls and masks begun at midnight, burning ever to mid-day,
When they made up fresh adventures for the morrow, do you say?

	V.

Was a lady such a lady, cheeks so round and lips so red,---
On her neck the small face buoyant, like a bell-flower on its bed,
O'er the breast's superb abundance where a man might base his head?

	VI.

Well, and it was graceful of them---they'd break talk off and afford
---She, to bite her mask's black velvet---he, to finger on his sword,
While you sat and played Toccatas, stately at the clavichord?

	VII.


What? Those lesser thirds so plaintive, sixths diminished, sigh on sigh,
Told them something? Those suspensions, those solutions---Must we die?''
Those commiserating sevenths---Life might last! we can but try!''

	VIII.

Were you happy?''---Yes.''---And are you still as happy?''---Yes. And you?''
---Then, more kisses!''---Did _I_ stop them, when a million seemed so few?''
Hark, the dominant's persistence till it must be answered to!

	IX.

So, an octave struck the answer. Oh, they praised you, I dare say!
Brave Galuppi! that was music! good alike at grave and gay!
I can always leave off talking when I hear a master play!''

	X.

Then they left you for their pleasure: till in due time, one by one,
Some with lives that came to nothing, some with deeds as well undone,
Death stepped tacitly and took them where they never see the sun.

	XI.

But when I sit down to reason, think to take my stand nor swerve,
While I triumph o'er a secret wrung from nature's close reserve,
In you come with your cold music till I creep thro' every nerve.

	XII.

Yes, you, like a ghostly cricket, creaking where a house was burned:
Dust and ashes, dead and done with, Venice spent what Venice earned.
The soul, doubtless, is immortal---where a soul can be discerned.

	XIII.

Yours for instance: you know physics, something of geology,
Mathematics are your pastime; souls shall rise in their degree;
Butterflies may dread extinction,---you'll not die, it cannot be!

	XIV.

As for Venice and her people, merely born to bloom and drop,
Here on earth they bore their fruitage, mirth and folly were the crop:
What of soul was left, I wonder, when the kissing had to stop? 

	XV.

Dust and ashes!'' So you creak it, and I want the heart to scold.
Dear dead women, with such hair, too---what's become of all the gold
Used to hang and brush their bosoms? I feel chilly and grown old.

*  An overture---a touch piece. 

Affection is love, kindness and care
Affection is precious and above all rare
It brightens our very simple day
And show more nice and new ways
And tell that god has sent the gift
To give this world a brighter lift
Because it is what make us glad
And change all things that're bad
So that's why the most novel thing
That keeps on moving in never ending ring
That we can give to each other dear
Is a rare token of affection and care.

And smiles with anxious looks, his earliest friends,
Masking his birth-name, wont to character
His wild-wood fancy and impetuous zeal,)
'Tis true that, passionate for ancient truths,
And honouring with religious love the Great
Of elder times, he hated to excess,
With an unquiet and intolerant scorn,
The hollow Puppets of an hollow Age,
Ever idolatrous, and changing ever
Its worthless Idols ! Learning, Power, and Time,
(Too much of all) thus wasting in vain war
Of fervid colloquy. Sickness, 'tis true,
Whole years of weary days, besieged him close,
Even to the gates and inlets of his life !
But it is true, no less, that strenuous, firm,
And with a natural gladness, he maintained
The citadel unconquered, and in joy
Was strong to follow the delightful Muse.
For not a hidden path, that to the shades
Of the beloved Parnassian forest leads,
Lurked undiscovered by him ; not a rill
There issues from the fount of Hippocrene,
But he had traced it upward to its source,
Through open glade, dark glen, and secret dell,
Knew the gay wild flowers on its banks, and culled
Its med'cinable herbs. Yea, oft alone,
Piercing the long-neglected holy cave,
The haunt obscure of old Philosophy,
He bade with lifted torch its starry walls
Sparkle, as erst they sparkled to the flame
Of odorous lamps tended by Saint and Sage.
O framed for calmer times and nobler hearts !
O studious Poet, eloquent for truth !
Philosopher ! contemning wealth and death,
Yet docile, childlike, full of Life and Love !
Here, rather than on monumental stone,
This record of thy worth thy Friend inscribes,
Thoughtful, with quiet tears upon his cheek.A Tongue—to tell Him I am true!
Its fee—to be of Gold—
Had Nature—in Her monstrous House
A single Ragged Child—

To earn a Mine—would run
That Interdicted Way,
And tell Him—Charge thee speak it plain—
That so far—Truth is True?

And answer What I do—
Beginning with the Day
That Night—begun—
Nay—Midnight—'twas—
Since Midnight—happened—say—

If once more—Pardon—Boy—
The Magnitude thou may
Enlarge my Message—If too vast
Another Lad—help thee—

Thy Pay—in Diamonds—be—
And His—in solid Gold—
Say Rubies—if He hesitate—
My Message—must be told—

Say—last I said—was This—
That when the Hills—come down—
And hold no higher than the Plain—
My Bond—have just begun—

And when the Heavens—disband—
And Deity conclude—
Then—look for me. Be sure you say—
Least Figure—on the Road—Great cities rise and have their fall; the brass
That held their glories moulders in its turn.
Hard granite rots like an uprooted weed,
And ever on the palimpsest of earth
Impatient Time rubs out the word he writ.
But one thing makes the years its pedestal,
Springs from the ashes of its pyre, and claps
A skyward wing above its epitaph—
The will of man willing immortal things.

The ages are but baubles hung upon
The thread of some strong lives—and one slight wrist
May lift a century above the dust;
For Time,
The Sisyphean load of little lives,
Becomes the globe and sceptre of the great.
But who are these that, linking hand in hand,
Transmit across the twilight waste of years
The flying brightness of a kindled hour?
Not always, nor alone, the lives that search
How they may snatch a glory out of heaven
Or add a height to Babel; oftener they
That in the still fulfilment of each day’s
Pacific order hold great deeds in leash,
That in the sober sheath of tranquil tasks
Hide the attempered blade of high emprise,
And leap like lightning to the clap of fate.

So greatly gave he, nurturing ‘gainst the call
Of one rare moment all the daily store
Of joy distilled from the acquitted task,
And that deliberate rashness which bespeaks
The pondered action passed into the blood;
So swift to harden purpose into deed
That, with the wind of ruin in his hair,
Soul sprang full-statured from the broken flesh,
And at one stroke he lived the whole of life,
Poured all in one libation to the truth,
A brimming flood whose drops shall overflow
On deserts of the soul long beaten down
By the brute hoof of habit, till they spring
In manifold upheaval to the sun.

Call here no high artificer to raise
His wordy monument—such lives as these
Make death a dull misnomer and its pomp
An empty vesture. Let resounding lives
Re-echo splendidly through high-piled vaults
And make the grave their spokesman—such as he
Are as the hidden streams that, underground,
Sweeten the pastures for the grazing kine,
Or as spring airs that bring through prison bars
The scent of freedom; or a light that burns
Immutably across the shaken seas,
Forevermore by nameless hands renewed,
Where else were darkness and a glutted shore. 

Short are my legs and weak my speed
but long my insight and  strong my will. 

call led 
i move belly earth borne, body helmeted, away
from all that i hold for a day, holding
only of all earth's gift
most rare-heartease, conscious
that the joy of life lies not in its haste 
and i never let now starves at my doorstep
for i prize that which is and not what will be
or was. 

Do you even know what's happening with my soul? 
It's been twisting, it's been shouting -
I've got the poison in my roots, and in my
Being; it's spreading to every inch, ever quartered section.
When they look at my skin, they say
'She's got the devil in her, leave him alone'.
But I need rest too, where's my reprieve? 
The angels are nearer to me than most would believe.
Every crack and dent of mine fills deeper with sand, 
And I can barely breathe. I don't know how I still stand. 

Wherever I go, 
there I am
but if I'm not there

my wife is, 
her eyes smiling.
It's been that way

for fifty years.
Not much more 
to say except

whenever I go 
some place
and discover

she's not there, 
then I'm not 
there either

even though
neighbors tell her
they saw me there

so I ask them what's
the difference between
flotsam and jetsam.

They have no answer. 
Why in their world 
worry about me. 

Every word of encouragement
Is a blessing my dear
It shows how well
We're loved and taken care

For each stitch that we weave
In the destiny of our lives
Takes us closer
To bitter reality that survive

For troubles will surely come
Not to stay but to pass dear
So we must learn to share
How to show our love and care

And be the pillar of strength
And the candle of faith and hope
That can reflect the light
And teaches to overcome and cope

For a touch of encouragement
Is surely a magic true
That can swap your tears
With smiles and joys new

And can show you a path
To walk and survive
And pass life's test
And learn the secret of your life. 

A touch of hope
Is all
That I want
To
Have the courage
To live up to
And
Wish for tomorrow-

Where life is Now
And I want to allow
Good things to happen
And raise positive vibration

And put a spring in my feet
And take one step after another
And embrace the challenges
To enjoy 
The thrill of Achievement--Give a touch of love
In everything you do
So you can always see
And have a bright view
Of never ending and long
Days of our lives
Where we all go
To take the morning drive
For love really blooms
Like a flower
That can take away
All glooms with its power
And make everything looks
Very fresh and bright
And very pleasing
To our sight
So give a touch of love
In everything you do
So you can always see
And have a bright view. 

When first the crocus thrusts its point of gold 
Up through the still snow-drifted garden mould, 
And folded green things in dim woods unclose 
Their crinkled spears, a sudden tremor goes 
Into my veins and makes me kith and kin 
To every wild-born thing that thrills and blows. 
Sitting beside this crumbling sea-coal fire, 
Here in the city's ceaseless roar and din, 
Far from the brambly paths I used to know, 
Far from the rustling brooks that slip and shine 
Where the Neponset alders take their glow, 
I share the tremulous sense of bud and briar 
And inarticulate ardors of the vine. 

Looking out across the sea to wide horizons new, 
Setting off with many thoughts, in my small boat of blue.
With a strong wind at my back my way is straight and true.

‘Plucky’ is my middle name, I love the wide unknown, 
Each day an altered canvas before my eyes I’m shown, 
Eagerness is in my Soul. I travel on alone.

The crying of the seagulls way up above my head, 
Dolphins playing merrily. Their living space wide-spread.
Their intelligence a marvel, such a thoroughbred.

The tossing of the waves, the brilliance of the sun, 
How peaceful one can feel like a fantasy well spun.
Such relaxation found when the busy day is done.

Conquering the elements gives one a touch of pride, 
Sailing into stormy squalls can give a choppy ride, 
But my sturdy craft and I are both well satisfied. 

There is an old saying in sport

you are as good as your best;

Terror, war, 
People shaking
In their boots.
Folks living in a car, 
Making due
With where hey are.
Tent cities.
Handout lines.
Economy on 
A decline.
Businesses 
Closing up.
States going
Bankrupt. 
The year of
Two thousand nine
Really saw
A rough time.

The economy was one of the toughest ever. 

An old friend lost an old friend the other day. Jim said they were both getting up in years and he just happened to outlast Herman. Jim was black and Herman was white but that had never mattered in a town where some thought it should.

Herman had been mayor of their small town for years. He was not only the mayor. He was Jim's dentist and his good friend. 

Jim was a teacher and taught Herman's children. Jim also worked with Herman on different social projects to make life better for the poor in the community. There were quite a few poor people in town. Some had jobs and others were unemployed. Jim and Herman worked together to make life better for all of them, as much as the donations they collected would allow. 

One night Jim had a chance to test his friendship with Herman. He had been to the hospital visiting Mrs. Carmichael, a widow Jim and Herman had come to know through their efforts to help the poor. Mrs. Carmichael was in the process of dying a slow death and the thought of her impending death bothered Jim a great deal.  They had known each other for years.

Jim came out of the hospital that evening thinking about Mrs. Carmichael, got in his car and remembered he had a book he needed to return to the library.  He drove out of the parking lot but failed to notice a traffic island he knew full well was there. He swerved to miss it and did but when he turned left to go to the library, a policeman drove up behind him, lights flashing. 

Jim pulled over to the side, put both of his hands on the steering wheel and waited. The policeman asked for his license. Jim kept one hand on the steering wheel and put the other in his back pocket. He took out his wallet, opened it and pulled out his license. The cop looked at it and said, 'Mr. Jackson, have you been drinking? '  

Jim said, 'I don't drink

"  The cop shone his flashlight in Jim's face with the high beam directly in his eyes.  

Jim blinked from the light and said, 'Sir, I have spastic optic nerves.  My eyes will jump all over the place.'  

The cop said, 'Get out of the car.'  

Jim said, 'If you think I've been drinking, take me to the station.'

The cop said, 'Walk that line.'  Cars were passing and blowing their horns.  Jim was mortified. He knew the cop had called in his name, and people all over town were hearing it on their scanners. Listening to a police scanner is something some people in towns and big cities do even while watching television.

Jim successfully walked the line, placed his finger on his nose with both index fingers and recited his ABCs.  

About that time another police car drove up. The new cop rolled down the window and hollered to his colleague, 'You had better let him go; he's the mayor's friend.'

Jim was livid.  The policeman looked at Jim and said, 'You know I could arrest you.'

Jim replied, 'If you think I've been drinking, take me to the station! " 

The cop turned and walked off leaving Jim standing there.   

When Jim got home, he phoned his friend Herman, the mayor. He told him what had happened and what the two officers did. He told Herman that he had neither expected nor wanted any special favors and that his cousin Jimmy Joe had been killed some years back by a drunk driver.  

Herman spoke calmly to Jim.

"If you had been drinking and were arrested, Jim, I wouldn't get the police to pull your ticket. You're my friend, but I don't know why they think I would cover for you. I'll get to the bottom of this
 


Jim found out that Herman had a meeting the next day with the police chief and the two officers involved in the incident. Herman let all three know that no matter who broke the law, they were to be treated with courtesy but without favor. And that was especially true if someone was a friend of the mayor.

Jim respected Herman even more for doing what he did. He was a true public servant, Jim said, and there aren't enough of those around now. He said the town has had some good mayors since Herman retired, but even in death that man stands tall as one of a kind. 

Among his books he sits all day
To think and read and write;
He does not smell the new-mown hay,
The roses red and white.

I walk among them all alone,
His silly, stupid wife;
The world seems tasteless, dead and done -
An empty thing is life.

At night his window casts a square
Of light upon the lawn;
I sometimes walk and watch it there
Until the chill of dawn.

I have no brain to understand
The books he loves to read;
I only have a heart and hand
He does not seem to need.

He calls me "Child" - lays on my hair
Thin fingers, cold and mild;
I wish I were a child!

And no one sees and no one knows
(He least would know or see),
That ere Love gathers next year's rose
Death will have gathered me. 

A SOFT-BREASTED bird from the sea 
Fell in love with the light-house flame; 
And it wheeled round the tower on its airiest wing, 
And floated and cried like a lovelorn thing; 
It brooded all day and it fluttered all night, 
But could win no look from the steadfast light. 

For the flame had its heart afar,—
Afar with the ships at sea; 
It was thinking of children and waiting wives, 
And darkness and danger to sailors' lives; 
But the bird had its tender bosom pressed 
On the glass where at last it dashed its breast. 
The light only flickered, the brighter to glow;
But the bird lay dead on the rocks below. 

I have forgotten her face once I loved.
I have forgotten her name once I recited in dream.
I have forgotten her love which made me insane. 
I have forgotten all- meat, fish, sweets and ice-cream.

What is love then when it's lost forever? 
What is life then when it's frost forever

Polly had a heart, 
She really did, 
But listening to those kids
Made her hate herself, 
And everything else, 
Until consumed with rage
She began to abuse herself, 
Cigarette burns mixed with beauty spots, 
Wine stains down her brand new top, 
A knife coated in her crimson blood, 
The cuts on her arm a sick sense of love, 

Danny sold his soul, 
Just for a taste, 
Getting high meant that 
There was less that he had to face, 
But purple haze only lasts for a while, 
And now all that’s left
Is a long faded smile.
He wakes up everyday and is sick, 
The wound on his soul is a scab badly picked, 
He is so numb he can’t even cry, 
His only dream now is to die.

We’re falling apart with nothing but hate, 
As we sit here alone in the darkness and wait, 
So the C. 

D’s on pause 
Cos’ I’m sick of this song, 
I hope that you’ll hear me, 
But I think that I’m wrong, 
Forgive me for this 
But I can’t hold me back, 
My demons I’m afraid
Have emerged from the cracks
Of the mask that I 
Made for myself, 
So I hope that you’re good, 
I’m not quite as well.

The rain falls and the sun departs, 
The cloud shifts to cloak all the hearts
Of those in the city who pass slowly by, 
Their lives and their dreams a horrible lie, 
The wind scatters leaves across the street, 
And life and death move on without missing a beat. 

Why it always happens with me
That whenever I wish to see
A bright sunshine in my room
I'm left with the thoughts in gloom? 
\Why it always happens with me
That whenever I wish to be free
Of the troubles that're grey
I see it crawling in my way? 
\Why it always happens with me
That whenever I wish to see
Something nicer like a morn
My dreams fall apart 'n are torn? 
\Why it always happens with me
That whenever I wish to be free
Of all my fears, doubts and terrors
I end up with some tragic errors? 


There lived a sage in days of yore, 
And he a handsome pigtail wore; 
But wondered much and sorrowed more, 
Because it hung behind him. 

He mused upon this curious case, 
And swore he'd change the pigtail's place, 
And have it hanging at his face, 
Not dangling there behind him. 

Says he, 'The mystery I've found - 
Says he, 'The mystery I've found! 
I'll turn me round,' - he turned him round; 
But still it hung behind him. 

Then round and round, and out and in, 
All day the puzzled sage did spin; 
In vain - it mattered not a pin - 
The pigtail hung behind him. 

And right and left and round about, 
And up and down and in and out 
He turned; but still the pigtail stout 
Hung steadily behind him. 

And though his efforts never slack, 
And though he twist and twirl, and tack, 
Alas! Still faithful to his back, 
The pigtail hangs behind him. 

The rats’ adept in a rat race 
Buy the tickets from a shrink, 
And board a train of mental stress, 
Hurriedly in a wink. 
The ticket checker is death
Keeping tab on passenger’s breath.

They board in a hurry
And munch the fast foods of worry: 
To reach a cemetery of success- 
Which treats all with its
deadly gaze

The train driven by a crazy driver ego
Loves to keep greedy rats on their toes: 
While rushing on a track of woes
It crushes alike, friends and foes.

Some jump on glitzy stations
And befriend fat diabetes and 
Melancholic passions.
Some alight on illnesses' stop
And are destined to 
Slip on life's slopes.

But some wise ones- known as 
Crackpots- luckily win jackpots
They choose to alight at sylvan place
They stay in a mansion of health
Store peace and bliss as a wealth.
They sleep with longevity- 
An ever youthful mate-
And accompany her through 
heavenly gate.




A train went through a burial gate,
A bird broke forth and sang,
And trilled, and quivered, and shook his throat
Till all the churchyard rang;

And then adjusted his little notes,
And bowed and sang again.
Doubtless, he thought it meet of him
To say good-by to men..




my heart with the spirit of the flames
walking in snowy passage
the sky is clear and blue, but
where am I, the roads become misty, 

I listen to the silence, just
the wind whistling, my heart
pulsates, yearns with hope, the
love talking about an open vision 



cloath'd with glorious rays,
And round about hast rob'd thy self with light.
Who like a curtain hast the Heavens display'd,
And in the watry Roofs thy Chambers laid.

Whose chariots are the thickned clouds above,
Who walk'st upon the winged winds below,
At whose command the airy Spirits move,
And fiery meteors their obedience show.
Who on this Base the earth didst firmly found,
And mad'st the deep to circumvest it round.

The waves that rise would drown the highest hill,
But at thy cheek they flie, and when they hear
Thy thundring voice, they post to do thy will,
And bound their furies in their proper sphere:
Where surging floods, and valing ebbs can tell,
That none beyond thy marks must sink or swell.

Who hath dispos'd, but thou, the winding way
Where springs down from the steepy crags do beat,
At which doth foster'd Beasts their thirsts allay,
And the wild Asses come to quench their heat;
Where Birds resort, and in their kind, thy praise
Among the branches chant in warbling laies.

The mounts are watred from thy dwelling place,
The barns and meads are fill'd for man and beast;
Wine glads the heart, and oyl adorns the face,
And bread the staff whereon our strength doth rest;
Nor shrubs alone feel thy suffizing hand,
But even the Cedars that so proudly stand.

So have the Fowls their sundry seats to breed,
The ranging Stork, in stately Beeches dwells;
The climing Goats on hills securely feed,
The mining Conies shroud in rocky Cells:
Nor can the heavenly lights their course forget,
The Moon her turns, or Sun his times to set.

Thou mak'st the Night to over-vail the Day;
The savage Beasts creep from the silent wood,
Then Lions whelps lie roaring for their prey,
And at thy powerful hand demand their food:
Who when at morn they all recouch again,
Then toyling man till eve pursues his pain.

How richly furnish'd is the earth we tread!
Where, in the fair Contents of Nature's Book,
We may the wonders of thy wisdom read:
Nor earth alone, but lo, the sea so wide,
Where great & small, a world of creatures glide.

There go the Ships that furrow out their way;
Yea, thereof Whales enormous sights we see,
Which yet have scope among the rest to play,
And all do wait for their support on thee:
Who hast assign'd each thing his proper food,
And in due season dost dispence thy good.

They gather when thy gifts thou dost divide;
Their stores abound, if thou thy hand enlarge;
Confus'd they are, when thou thy beams dost hide;
In dust resolv'd, if thou their breath discharge.
Again, when thou of life renew'st the seeds,
The withered fields revest their chearful weeds.

Be ever gloried here thy Soveraign Name,
That thou may'st smile on all which thou hast made;
Whose frown alone can shake this earthly frame,
And at whose touch the hills in smoak shall vade.
For me, may (while I breathe) both harp & voice,
In sweet indictment of thy Hymns rejoyce.

Let Sinners fail, let all Profaness cease;
His Praise, (my Soul) His Praise shall be thy Peace..
This is my English translation of a poem by Cristina Campo: 'Devota come un ramo'.

'Prayerful as a branch'



Prayerful as a branch
curved by plenty of snow
cheerful as bonfires
along hills of oblivion, 

on piercing blades
in jumper of white nettles, 
I'll teach you, my soul, 
this step of farewell..

'Devota come un ramo' by Cristina Campo 


Devota come ramo
curvato da molte nevi
allegra come falò
per colline d'oblio, 

su acutissime làmine
in bianca maglia d'ortiche, 
ti insegnerò, mia anima, 
questo passo d'addio..

The Golden Kabin 

No gold coin I have; Don't demand any dower, O my Doe; 
If you take, I can give my dowerless two hands.
I haven't stored any self-selling gold, 
for the cunning frown wounds and hurts me all around everywhere.

If you love me, in return I'll give my kiss
It's my only business, for I haven't learnt how to deceive a lady.
If you give your body, you'll get mine, too. O my Love, 
no capital but body I have, by which I can purchase ornaments for you.

If you get nude, you'll find me simple; 
Even no olive-leaves will remain there, which may envelop my virility; 
If you start tasting, please give me a share of those fruits, too; 
In consciousness and unconsciousness we'll remain ever-known to each other.

Although all my distressed veins and arteries wounded severely, 
I ain't defeated, O Love, poets don't know how to give in.


Supporting my hands, O my venomous snake, ascend on my Pati 
Fold up your hood now, don't compose any black verse within my heart.
Whatever darkness you can pour out by each of your snaps, 
every moment I become bluer than that darkness in fear of your bite.

In which tricks and artifices have you worn the Nilamborsari? 
Flowing in drops, the color of night becomes more black.
I think I can jump into that deep darkness
if you pick up my death spreading out the edge of your sari.

Would you permit me to write down my name without any title and shine, 
with the scratch of slow trembling nails on your chest? If you get shy, 
I'll wipe off the first letter, the blood-alphabet, not Aryan and ancient, 
with my untiring wet kisses.

O Kalabatimine, make the sport of Bangali race wavy, 
the sport which Batsayan did not know and knew no girls of the Aryan.


Turning round the curve of your neck, come near, O my wild duck; 
Uncovering your feathers, give me the ease of your warm body.
I pass my days bowing down to Nature. Today the name of this man, 
skillful in words, will open the door of ecstasy.

The arrow of  Kakka'swords, the command of sylvan soul, 
summons you eighteen times, hear attentively, O my eighteenth.
Untie your closed serpent-like plait with your own fingers then ascend on 
dark-blue bed-sheet and get seated nude with me to quench our two thirsts.

Let's go to an uncultivated valley 
having the sound of two violent waters with us, like that of a hungry river.
Untie all the folds of your body like the soil of a bar; 
May the flesh of Ugolfish be happy in your mud; 

Moistening all the artistry of pleasure with the lake dye of lips, 
let us sink fast, O Love, into the revolving riddle of blood.


If you want to visit my shrine, walk slowly, O my sweet Love.
Catching the torn palm-leaves, let us recite his verse.
We don't know how many drops of tear there are on this torn palm-leaves.

Would you come, O wild lass, being the desire of a poet? 
Then be aware that python is my totem in poverty.
Like a fresh murder, I'll draw the vaccine of cinnabar
and the love of a poor man on your red forehead.

How can I win you, my Love, 
by which Mantra of what clan, can I take you at my home? 
I've my belief in Kapilaonly. Has Love ever taken refuge in religion or
in any Sanghha Remember, only the grass of grave remains after all deaths.

As long as you've the form of copper-colored body, you've value; 
If you lose it ever, nothing exists more; then it is history which bursts alone into laughter


Have the fruits of cotton-plant exploded beside my home? 
Wear the garland of Gunja O girl, the fowler of my heart; 
Where have you kept the earthen bottle of Mahua 
Please carry it here in this moonbeam and let us rinse it down together with pleasure.

Who says that I won't recognize you in the aboriginal dress of a fowler? 
Does a hunter ever mistake to recognize the clan of birds? 
In whatever Mantras Khonas opened to unravel the mystery of Nature, 
remember, that same magic lies within the souls of poets.

I've learnt from the book of Nature from my childhood that
all-piercing root of Green pierces even love; No everlasting
society has ever been built anywhere; The fingers of all artists
of Egypt, Greece and Serasine have failed to do that.

By the strike of Age's plane, all the arts tremble in fear; 
O Girl, the lips of a poet are not more painful than that.


I've no faith in Pisces, Girl; I'm a man of Kauma society
who only create the sound of simple equality in your town.
I've never composed a single verse after the name of any chieftain; 
I'm the poet on whose baldhead always hangs the law of oppressor.

Long long ago my ancestors were slaves of some emperor; 
They used to compose the pound of sentences selling their conscience; 
That scandal, yet now, hisses in the wind of Bengal; 
Alaul the rider of the horse of Rosang, hides his face in shame. 

Isn't it better to be a poor minstrel, who is looking for 
the neighbour living in Arshi nagar 
Braid my hair today making diadem over my head; 
Become my Aktara O Love, I would be your young Lalon

All the mistakes I've made due to the undesired sentiment of devotion, 
Today I'll rectify them all and create the warbling of new words.


Having lost your gold ear-ring are you crying, my Love? 
The boughs of Anajbend down outside in terrible storm; 
Is it possible to get back the Jeorfrom the hands of a thief? 
Perhaps the coquette of the thief has worn that ring now.

All the elegant conscience of this country has been eaten into by worms; 
Selling the brain, the learned society is happy very much; 
How long can the truth be concealed under the lid of civility
when the art of a rebellious poem cries loudly within the soul? 

Don't break your bracelet; yet there are some lath of sandalwood
at my home, by which I'll fill up the holes of your ears.
In the discourse of Dhrupada suddenly I have sung the Kheur 
Pardon me, O virgin, forgive the songs of this upset cuckoo.

The gold cat will drink all the milk of your bowlhow long would you
tolerate, O unsteady girl, pretending that you've noticed nothing at all? 


The age of Monosahas touched me in my profound sleep.
A serpent has entered, O Chaste, into the bridal chamber of iron; 
Will we notice ever a new morning after this very night
and the sun, the emperor of warmth, which rises everyday? 

My whole body, getting blue by the rage of venom, trembles in fear; 
O my Behula lift me up now over your body; Embrace me, O my chaste Love, 
binding me by your two hands; Today the son of Ebb, who always blasphemes
gods and goddesses, will lie down on your immersion.

If my life comes to an end for the fraud venom of age, 
start bewailing with your disheveled hair.
Hearing your cry, the life-bird will return breaking the cage of death.
Viewing the audacity of life, may the life-eater Zambow down its head.

Rending  your dress, start dancing, O Love, beside my death; 
May the chubby coin of you reverse the system of our living.


Through the current of ancestry, O my proud Love, you've got this verdant
splendor in  your body; Remember, those ancestors had once built
the city of Pundra. They all have been the food of soil. But I didn't know
the roots of Banyan trees always drink the blood of a black nation.

My dwelling is also in the country of red-colored soil.
My forefathers were pride of Pattikeracity.
The waves of monstrous bush have devoured all.

In the Past, of whose fear, the Vedic fire of dividing men into classes
dared not advance one inch crossing the Karatoa Have the  foundations 
of their dwellings been eaten into by the worms of hypocrisy? 
The sound of elegant equality frequently goes futile.

The Borgisare looting our paddy, the whole country is being filled with blood and death; 
O my dark-complexioned Love, the danger of crops is here more serious than your beauty.

 
The savage have raised their hands by the Mantra of laborer-equality; 
Behold, O Love, peace has set in the country of Hiensung; 
Let us stick the badge of a hero on the dresses of them 
who carry the invitation of equality for the working class people in Asia.

May the equal distribution of crops be our only religion; 
Start singing the song of extirpation of class, motivated by the Mantra
of utmost relief. Pronounce such a speech of love with courage
so that no class-distinction can ever enter into the folk-religion.

Then if you want to refer to the context of lust, come behind
the concealment of corn-field and uncover the yellow of your youth; 
From the side of crops how much love I can give, 
I'll give you more than that, the cordial affection of coitus.

I've caught your silk-sari with much bashful courage; 
O my sweet-voiced Love, don't delay, acknowledge me your hero.


I've heard from my boyhood, O Girl, Bangladesh is the  lying-in-room for wise men; 
All our past wisdom-trees were born here during the incessant rain; 
See now into that room of knowledge, there hang only some depressed bats.
O my amiable Love, how difficult it has been today to have faith in the Past! 

How would I accept it's the birthplace of Srigyanand Shilbhadrahad inhaled the first air from here? 
If we exclude its part, it loses its everything mentionable; 
only a few sinanthropous cough in our schools.

Within the last exaltation of this stone-age, where would you flee, 
O Girl upset, in which bush would you hide yourself? 
In your body the color of an independent deer remains, too.
When the blades of stones are thrown from behind the curtain, 

the existentialist-giraffes have lengthened their individual necks 
into our art-centre and all our workmanship.


Suddenly hearing the sound of high tide at midnight 
from the village adjacent to the river, a farmer gropes 
for his beloved wife whether she is beside him or not
who opens the door of wealth and corn; 

Likewise, grasp my hand, O Love, at this blind night, full of fear.
If the smell of crops remains in your body, 
the enemy of food may bring the ferocious attack of greed; 
we'll return that panic created by food-greedy Rahu

As a peasant of upland, who eats  his food standing in water, 
establishes his utmost right on the newly risen bar, 
that way I've hoisted the flag of justice over your head; 
The flag of mine, bright colored, is firm both in kindness and right.

Behold, the northeast is trembling in fear by the ear-splitting thunder; 
Swearing by the name of storm, tell me, O Girl, whom are you of? 


Open your two eyes, O my beautiful Love, reddened by the odor of Loban 
the two designed borders of your sari tremble by my breath; 
Had you been the sylvan pigeon bent down to shyness? 
You're trembling as if you were the root of a cane fallen in storm.

Your chignon has been unloosed in wind, O my smiling girl; look at me, 
crossing your Tikli my heart palpitates in fear. All the villagers waiting
for you, having paddy in their auspicious winnowing platters; the Khaiof Binniare spread on the yard; Attar and Aguruon your bed.

Having accepted this lucky Dhan-durbawith reverence, 
loosening your Purdah O my noble Love, put up again your hair into a bun.
Your sisters-in-law of the same age have caught the threshold, coming to you; 
Be simple like them and listen to the first Sabakof your family.

All the women from my mother's side have gathered to welcome you as a bridegroom; 
O Girl, say spontaneously like the waves of a river'Kobul! Kobul! '


For Rain's sake, O Bibi, for sesame-colored paddy's sake, 
For the sake of fish and meat and for the sacred milch animals'; 
For plough, yoke and scythe's sake, for the sake of windy sail, 
Believe, no poet neglects the religion of heart.

If I ever profane my tongue breaking my promise, 
may you turn into the blade of lightning; 
and rending my heart, may your divorce fall down upon my head.
Then, O my Love, give me no piece of fish for my health.

Which way the innocent waves break down
on the body of a water-bird floating in the night's river, 
likewise I'll incessantly pour out all my kisses 
on your body setting you free from the chain of shyness.

If it happens otherwise, O Banu,for the mother tongue's and the love-poetry's sake, may your curse fall down upon my head like a thunderbolt.


 

A travelling man 
is a proud man
he'll fight for his family
he'll fight for his pride

He'll look after his own
like nobody else will
he'll keep them safe
when they need him the most
he'll never turn his back
on his family or pride

Where ever he stays
that's his home
until he moves on 
to pastures new

Sometimes my friend
I wish I could travel
with you


Treasures abound in an attic
if you're patient enough
to wade through
the spiders and dust to find them.

I found a picture of Mama there
in an old camelback trunk
crowded with unknown relatives
in musty photo albums, 
dried rose bouquets, 
and size six shoe boxes
filled with old love letters.

The photo was crackled, 
its corners bent, but there she was.
A bandana tied round her head
almost held the whispy curls
celebrating their freedom
in an ocean breeze, 
pants rolled up mid-calf, 
cuffs barely skimming the water
and she looked so happy.

How I wish I had known her then - 
so young and pretty, 
living carefree in a world 
filled with Daddy, 
before children and cancer. 

And in a treasure from the attic, 
I found the love I had known
that had so shaped me
throughout my life.
How terribly I miss her. 

A friend like a constant star of the day
A friend’s smiles and kindness always stay
A friend’s there in the hour of need
A friend plods you to succeed
A friend’s real and sincere to me
A friend cajoles and pushes my best to be
A friend’s unafraid to redirect my path
A friend speaks what’s just and the truth
A friend I would walk, an extra mile
A friend would share my moments of trial
A friend sees beyond who I am
A friend invites me to be the best I can
A friend listens when I speak
A friend speaks life when I am weak
A friend beacons like a strong light
A friend’s a sign-post, directs paths right
A friend’s a fire-side to keep cold nights warm
A friend’s a mirror, reflecting the thoughts I own 
For His glory and pleasure. 

Who cares for the flowers' gone grandeur? 
Who reads the story of the falling leaves? 
What to steal from one heading to a winter, 
In autumn you invite the beautiful thieves! 

Love not supplemented by something to steal
Is just like a booked shot rarely played 
The thieves will come back during snow fall
May not the winter this year too delayed! 

Beatify me O Nature! This year once again, 
Cover my nude branches by soft white silk, 
Skin though hard fit yet for the osmosis, 
From snow I can suck O Mother, some milk! 

I'm sure your snow will inject new dreams
Green leaves and colorful flowers springs 
Withstanding winds, calling back thieves 
The lost naughtiness by waiving the wings 

 I'm sure colors and aroma of flowers, 
Will bring back the gone butterflies, 
Birds will come and their sweet songs, 
Will pull down the clouds from skies

Pretty was the first tremor of romance
In the wild wind my drunken dance, 
Dreaming with stars in the maiden moonlight, 
Attracting the lovers in the sexy sunlight, 
Delicacy and color and aroma of my petals, 
No fire no heat yet I melted the metals, 
I melted my lovers, the naughty thieves, 
Though lost myself, no regrets no grieves, 
Lost color and aroma and my soft delicacy, 
Did it in your garden with no privacy, 
I'm a beautiful agent of immortal love, 
A teacher for man and lion and dove, 
Beauty is in you that a flower unlocks, 
To see your shocks and the aftershocks, 
For the beloved are clouds and showers, 
And a lovely revival for the lovely flowers, 
Nature knows well what are my needs? 
See kissing of soil by embryos of seeds, 
I rose again from the bosom of earth, 
Now a tree of flowers, my beauty my worth

White dawn. Stillness. 

When the rippling began
         I took it for sea-wind, coming to our valley with rumors
          of salt, of treeless horizons. But the white fog
didn't stir; the leaves of my brothers remained outstretched,
unmoving.
   
       &n bsp;        Yet the rippling drew nearer – and then
my own outermost branches began to tingle, almost as if
fire had been lit below them, too close, and their twig-tips
were drying and curling.
      
       &n bsp;               Yet I was not afraid, only
      &nbsp ;                 
      deeply alert.
I was the first to see him, for I grew
      &nbsp ;              out on the pasture slope, beyond the forest.
He was a man, it seemed: the two
moving stems, the short trunk, the two
arm-branches, flexible, each with five leafless
      
       &n bsp;                      &nbsp ; twigs at their ends,
and the head that's crowned by brown or golden grass,
bearing a face not like the beaked face of a bird,
             &nbsp ;     more like a flower's.
               
       &n bsp;       He carried a burden made of
some cut branch bent while it was green,
strands of a vine tight-stretched across it. From this,
when he touched it, and from his voice
which unlike the wind's voice had no need of our
leaves and branches to complete its sound,
                     &nbsp ;                 
came the ripple.
But it was now no longer a ripple (he had come near and 
stopped in my first shadow) it was a wave that bathed me
       
       &n bsp;    as if rain
      &nbsp ;                 
      rose from below and around me
       
       &n bsp;    instead of falling.
And what I felt was no longer a dry tingling:
               
     I seemed to be singing as he sang, I seemed to know
      &nbsp ;              what the lark knows; all my sap
                
       &n bsp;      was mounting towards the sun that by now
                
       &n bsp;      had risen, the mist was rising, the grass
was drying, yet my roots felt music moisten them
deep under earth.

     &nbsp ;               He came still closer, leaned on my trunk:
                   the bark thrilled like a leaf still-folded.
Music! There was no twig of me not
                
       &n bsp;      trembling with joy and fear.

Then as he sang
it was no longer sounds only that made the music:
he spoke, and as no tree listens I listened, and language
      
       &n bsp;     came into my roots
             &nbsp ;                out of the earth,
                   into my bark
      &nbsp ;                 
      out of the air,
into the pores of my greenest shoots
          gently as dew
and there was no word he sang but I knew its meaning.
He told me of journeys,
           of where sun and moon go while we stand in dark,
         of an earth-journey he dreamed he would take some day
deeper than roots . 
He told of the dreams of man, wars, passions, griefs,
      &n bsp;   and I, a tree, understood words – ah, it seemed
my thick bark would split like a sapling's that
      &nbsp ;                 
      grew too fast in the spring
when a late frost wounds it.

      &n bsp;                      &nbsp ;          Fire he sang,
that trees fear, and I, a tree, rejoiced in its flames.
New buds broke forth from me though it was full summer.
      &n bsp;   As though his lyre (now I knew its name)
         were both frost and fire, its chords flamed
up to the crown of me.
           I was seed again.
                   I was fern in the swamp.
                     &nbsp ;                 
I was coal. 

Beloved! You, the lovebird, chest of my chest; 
Leaving me aside, flew towards horizon-
Lonely me, as barren as a rain-forest. 

A TRIBAL WOMAN TO HER 
                  LOVER

Take me to the village fun-fair my love, 
When the red palash* blossoms bloom, 
And the trees are all aflame once more, 
While the birds chirp their loving tune! 
Buy me a pair of jhumkas** my love, 
Those long earrings I longed for years; 
To see them gently swaying and dangling 
my love, 
From the soft lobes of both my ears! 
And then I shall dance and sing, 
Embracing the season of Spring; 
To the tune of your melodious flute, 
With love eloquent, and not mute! 
And when I walk down the village road
my love, 
My ear-rings will sparkle and sway, 
When those passer-by will stop to stare, -
Making some to even forget their way! 
Those pair of jhumkas my love, 
Shall happiness to my heart bring, 
And you shall be with me my love, -
To be my loving King! 
And I shall sleep in your arms my love, 
Under the full moon’s golden sheen, 
To be with you always my love, -
                                         New Delhi
                                         Jan (*PALASH blossoms heralds the advent of Spring! 
  **  JHUMKAS are ear-rings.)Young and full of life
You left one morning thinking you would
come back
A dreadful accident caused by a housewife
Now your body rests under a brass plaque
Your kindness and humor
Will always be remembered
to ponder
The Angels are blessed to have you as a
member
One day you will meet again
With your loved ones that were left on Earth
Only time will heal the pain
Please guide us and free us from distress
Let Heaven’s Angels bring us peace
For peace and tranquility bring great success
Cease and put an end to the breach of peace


They honored Father Michael Judge
A man who’d given all: 
A friend to the firefighters
He took to heart this call.

He was always there for them—
Day in and day out.
Always, they could call on him, 
And that, without a doubt.

Father Michael Judge, 
Who has laid down his sword
Has embraced the promise; 

He was so much a part of them.
They held him in esteem, 
And threw their arms around him
As one of the team.

New York’s "Michael Judge, "
A spiritual guide was he; 
And a firefighter’s hero
He had come to be.সার্দিনিয়ার গল্প ।। রহমান হেনরী


আমরা এখন ক্যালেন্ডারের ভেতর দিয়ে চলে যেতে পারি: 

ডিসেম্বর তারিখে; মানচিত্রের ভেতর দিয়ে

চলে যেতে পারি: স্টকহোম সেন্ট্রাল রেল স্টেশনে; 

চন্দ্রালোকহীন  কিশকিশে অন্ধকারে কুয়াশামণ্ডিত

সেই এক সন্ধ্যে পৌণে সাতটায়, যেখানে, সার্দিনিয়ার

এই ছোটখাটো মেয়েটি, একাধিক ফেরি ও ট্রেনের

বদৌলতে, তিন দিন তিন রাতের দীর্ঘ ভ্রমণ শেষে

এইমাত্র পা রাখলো, প্ল্যাটফর্মে। তার বয়স  

চোখের রং বাদামি, চুল শাদা, চামড়া গোলাপি; 

জন্ম: সেপ্টেম্বর  

জন্মস্থান: নাওরো, সার্দিনিয়া; 

নাম: গ্রাজিয়া মারিয়া কোজিমা দামিয়ানা দেলেদ্দা।

 

মাত্র দু সপ্তাহ আগে, প্রথমবারের মতো সৃজিত তার

পাসপোর্ট বলছে: এটাই তার একমাত্র বিদেশ ভ্রমণ।

এর আগে, তার শৈশব পুড়ে ছাই হয়ে গেছে; বিয়ে

হয়েছে সম্পূর্ণ অচেনা আগন্তুক এক যুবকের সাথে, 

সমুদ্র পেরিয়ে কোনও এক অজ্ঞাত কারণে, যে কিনা

পৌঁছে গিয়েছিলো সার্দিনিয়ার সেই পাহাড়ি গ্রামাঞ্চলে; 

এই মেয়ে ইতালীয়, কিন্তু তার ভাষা রোমান নয়__ সার্দো; 

জীবনের মতো একটা জীবন পাইয়ে দিতে, যে তার একমাত্র 

শিশুপুত্রের হাতে, স্মৃতিচিহ্ন স্বরূপ একটা ব্রেসলেট ধরিয়ে দিয়ে, 

বাবা-মার কাছে রেখে, সেই কিশোরিবেলায় নিরুদ্দিষ্ট হয়েছিলো

রোমের জনসমুদ্রে; কিন্তু রোমান শেখেনি কোনওদিন। 

 

নরওয়ের সুধী সমাবেশে, 

আর দুদিন পর, সার্দিয়ানার গল্প শোনাবে সে, যাকে

ভদ্রলোকেরা বলে থাকে: নোবেল বক্তৃতা।

ওটা শুনতে শুনতেই, জল-স্থল ও পাহাড়খচিত মানচিত্রের

ভেতর দিয়ে আমরা যেতে চাই: 

 

নাওরো, সার্দিনিয়ায়।

 * A Tribute To Grazia Deledda FROM BANGLADESHOpen up b#! *h and let me in
When the neighbors ask I'm just your friend
I'm not your out of town kin
But once I begin, to begin to befriend
Your loving heart 
Maybe then I could see your emotions in a dream about a lullaby
Please O' dear don't cry
When axes fall from the sky
Straight into your thigh
Grin without a cringe and bare it
Take the pain and share it
You O' dear don't have to be a Valentine
You don't have to be mine
Yet, you do have to die
So I bid you goodbye
In leaving you now
I place this kiss upon your brow
And with your final breath, I take my bow


The magic he created with his magical voice and 
with his exceptional dancing talent 
he still rules the millions heart, 
for people like us who grew with his music 
it is unbelievable to believe his end was tragic. 
 
He died a broken man, 
his life and his death was ridden with controversies 
yet his music healed many a broken hearts and created fantasies, 
The world will remember him for his charities, 
he truly filled our world with musical biopsies. 




The foremost Hungarian poet of the twentieth
century, 
Was born in Budapest in into a Jewish
family.
Both his mother and twin brother died at his
birth! 
But in our Muse blessed poetic sky he has left
behind his indelible mark! 
He always loved Hungary and was a dedicated
Nationalist, 
Later, converted to Catholicism, but remained
fiercely anti-fascist! 
In obtained a Ph


D in Hungarian Literature; 
Got married to Fanni Gyarmati the following year.
His earlier poetical works –‘Pagan Salute’, ‘Song
of Modern Shepherd’ and Translations are held 
very dear! 
Identified as a Jew, sent to the labour camp at
Yugoslavia, as fate had slated, 
And with the approach of the Russian army, - 
those camps got evacuated! 
A forced route march followed through Hungary
towards the German border; 
By that megalomaniac - Hitler’s orders! 
Eventually, too weak to walk, along with of
his mates, 
Was shot by the guards, an inhuman fate! 
And after the war when their mass grave was 
exhumed, 
His wife found in his trench coat pocket a small
pencil scribbled note book! 
It contained  his posthumous collection-‘Sky
Without Clouds’ - Radnoti’s legacy, 
His eternal dedication to the Muse of Poetry!

(MOVED BY THE POETRY OF MIKLOS RADNOTI, I
WANTED ALL TRUE LOVERS OF POETRY TO READ
HIS WORKS!)Greatest gift of nature
To human creature
Mother, mother and mother
She is the first teacher
Teaching you since you were a babbler
She understood you better than the best
Did every little things in your interest
Loving, caressing touch of a mother
During your waking and slumber
Forgetting your every misdeed
Giving you advice when you need
Her true love is unfathomable indeed
Answering all your queries, paying heed
The safest place is the lap of a mother
Your real resort for all weather
Mother is mother no poor or rich
She does whatever is in her reach
For your happiness and growth
Changing your bad habit like old cloth
Teaching you best manners and conduct
To make you best nature's product
This poem is a tribute to mothers
Read, enjoy and spread the message
O my friends, reader and dear brothers


She gives the kid(s)  the important training; 
She does the baby’s cleaning and nursing; 
She tends to children’s bathing and cleaning.

A mother is the crux in kid(s)  growing! 
And children into adults keep turning; 
She does the child’s dressing and nail-paring; 
She sings the songs when child goes off sleeping! 

A mother keeps the home and does cooking; 
About the children all, she keeps thinking; 
Most days, she does the chores and dish-washing; 
She hardly gets some time for own sleeping! 

A mother loves to work and keep slogging! 
Sometimes, in vain for help, she keeps begging; 
Some modern moms take to even blogging; 
A few spend much time at husbands, nagging! 

A mother knows the art of good loving! 
Some are good in punning, joking, rhyming; 
A mother teaches kids at fine writing; 
She spends the night in ‘about all’, dreaming! 

A mother soul is fixed to kid(s)  rearing! 
To problems all, she gives a good hearing; 
Nothing amiss can escape her seeing; 
At times, she gives the kid(s)  a good beating! 

Some mothers can be bold and ev’n daring; 
Some mothers can’t stay without arguing; 
Good mothers believe in giving / sharing! 

A mother is a great human being! 
When someone leaves, she keeps her hand(s)  waving; 
For love sometimes, some mothers keep craving; 
The world somehow keeps most mothers crying! 

That has crossed the mighty Atlantic wave,
For what purpose let me pause and think-
I answer, to warn the people not to taste strong drink. 

And, I'm sure, if they take his advice, they never will rue
The day they joined the Blue Ribbon Army in the year 
And I hope to their colours they will always prove true,
And shout, Hurrah ! for Mr Murphy and the Ribbon of Blue. 

What is strong drink? Let me think-- I answer 'tis a thing
From whence the majority of evils spring,
And causes many a fireside with boisterous talk to ring,
And leaves behind it a deadly sting. 

Some people do say it is good when taken in moderation,
But, when taken to excess, it leads to tribulation,
Also to starvation and loss of reputation,
Likewise your eternal soul's damnation. 

The drunkard, he says he can't give it up,
For I must confess temptation's in the cup;
While he holds the cup in his trembling hand. 

And he exclaims in the agony of his soul --
From this most accurs'd cup!

Strong drink to the body can do no good;
It defiles the blood, likewise the food,
And causes the drunkard with pain to groan,
Because it extracts the marrow from the bone: 

And hastens him on to a premature grave,
Because to the cup he is bound a slave;
For the temptation is hard to thole,
And by it he will lose his immortal soul. 

The more's the pity, I must say,
That so many men and women are by it led astray,
And decoyed from the paths of virtue and led on to vice
By drinking too much alcohol and acting unwise. 

Good people all, of every degree,
I pray, ye all be warned by me:
I advise ye all to pause and think,
And never more to taste strong drink. 

Therefore, be warned, and think in time,
And don't drink any more whisky, rum, or wine. 

But go at once-- make no delay,
And join the Blue Ribbon Army without dismay,
And rally round Mr Murphy, and make a bold stand,
And help to drive the Bane of Society from our land. 

I wish Mr Murphy every success,
Hoping he will make rapid progress;
And to the Blue Ribbon Army may he always prove true,
And adhere to his colours-- the beautiful blue. 

Here lies my dog, motionless in his kennel
unable to wag his tail as he always did.
Yesterday when I saw him, curling helpless on his mat
he still wagged his tail and from him arose
a faint tremolo of love
punctuated by gutturals of pain.
At some bleak hour of the night, 
the last ember of life died down
and his supple body turned stiff and stark.

Now he lies straight and majestic in death
leaving a track record  of love
far difficult to break, 
- a love no vessel can hold
or equated with what we humans feel.

Speechless as I stand, memories churn within.
He came to us - too young to be weaned, 
a glossy black puppy with tawny gleaming eyes.
His short, sturdy limbs, large drooping ears, 
slender waist and elongated frame
well proclaimed his pedigree aloud
So full of mischief, he capered and hopped, 
like a new born calf, always up on his heels.
Sniffing with moist nose, he dug and dug
as if unearthing a treasure trove
buried deep beneath the soil.
With alert vigil, he guarded our home, 
barking at strangers and driving rodents away
He expected nothing in turn but love.
His loyalty as we deem was never servile.
Never was he on chains to be hauled like cattle.
He enjoyed sauntering through the courtyard
giving company as we took our evening rounds.
He gloated rubbing his body over our knee
and sat content as our stroking fingers ran all around
Licking our feet and arms, 
what he conveyed in inarticulate words
could be deciphered thus -
‘I love you, love you true'  

Like the bouncing ball, he often played with
our hearts made to bounce up in love
and our hands fold in benison
for a comrade who departs, 
valiant in life and loyal to the core
hoping to meet him anon
on the far green meadows of bliss, 
still wagging his tail, avowing a bond
too strong to be snapped or splintered. 

When I come to the end of the road
And the sun has set for me
I want no rites in a gloom filled room
Why cry for a soul set free! 

Miss me a little - but not too long
And not with your head bowed low
Remember the love we once shared
Miss me - But let me go! 

For this journey we all must take
And each must go alone
It's all part of the master plan
A step on the road to home

When you are lonely and sick at heart
Go to the friends we know
And bury your sorrows in doing good deeds
Miss me - But let me go

In the first decade of t century, 
I worked under a fine jury.
One of the wisest scholar of the city, 
With patience, compassion and humility.
The time to me was of doubt and fear, 
Him, I found, my life to steer.
I wandered with an unstable mind, 
And found him patient, tolerant and kind.
He struggled for me to cure and heal, 
With a great and great zeal.
He adored me with guidance, 
And I gained in abundance.
A time came and I departed, 
But with heavy hearted.
His efforts today I reap, 
In high esteem, him I keep.
In dreams I see his face, 
Eveready for me to embrace.
I found none, so compassionate, 
My life to rejuvenate.
Men like him are less to be found, 
His company a heavenly bound.
Through this poem I pay my tribute, 
For my master's fatherly attribute.

Rita Benson  'A TRIBUTE TO PRE-SOCRATIC 
              PHILOSOPHERS! 
                    (PART-I)   

              INTRODUCTION

Between and BC, there arose in the 
ancient Greek colony of Ionia, 
Now known as western Turkey, which was then
Asia Minor, -
A group of original thinkers, who tried to seek, -
A rational and natural explanation for all things! 
They strongly felt that all past mythical and super- 
natural explanations, -
Were both misleading and inadequate, and thereby
set in motion, 
A new way of thinking more akin to the scientific
kind; 
Thereby laying the edifice of Western Philosophy, -
As acknowledge now by scholars with hindsight! 
These philosophers had all looked for a single
 quintessential substance, 
From which all things had derived, that original
reality and being; 
And  the Ionian Greeks called  it the ‘arche’! 
They also pondered about problems of change and
identity! 
As we will subsequently see, they also  thought 
about appearance and reality! 
They spoke about tiny unseen indivisible spatial
entities called  atoms! 
They were unaided by scientific instruments and 
laboratories! 
Yet all scholars generally agree and acknowledge, -
They were the great pioneers of modern knowledge! 

THE MILESIAN SCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHERS: -

THALES (C-C)   

THALES was born in the Greek island of Miletus, 
around BC, 
It was washed by the cool waters of the Aegean Sea, -
in our modern day Turkey! 
He is said to have traveled to Egypt and Babylon, **
And armed with their mathematical and astrological 
lore, 
Had accurately predicted a solar eclipse on
of May, in BC! 
He was the first to philosophize the  principle of 
‘arche’; 
And declared that all things were made of ‘water’! 
Water was the ‘arche’ from which all things derived, 
And into which all things will one day subside! 
I for one do fear, with prevailing global warming, 
And with the ice caps melting, -  of being swallowed 
up by the sea! 
Thales is considered to be one of the seven sages of
Greece; 
Credited with the five basic theorems of geometry; 
And is regarded as the father of Western Philosophy! #

ANAXIMANDER (C)     $

Anaximander a pupil of Thales had refuted him,   
Saying that water cannot be the ‘arche’! 
Since ‘water’ cannot give rise to its opposite – ‘Fire’! 
And similarly all four elements; earth, fire, water and
air, - he had rejected entire! 
He spoke of the ‘Aperion’ – the unlimited or the 
boundless as the ‘arche’, -
Which was central to Greek cosmology! 
But he never explained at length, as to what he had 
actually meant! 
Later, Aristotle had expressed that ‘aperion’ was a
sort of primal chaos, 
And perhaps from that chaos that ‘womb of darkness’, -
Had emerged the cosmic egg! 

ANAXIMAMENES(BC)   

The last of the Milesian School of Philosophers, 
and he had said, -
That ‘Air’ was the most basic element and the source
of all existence! 
Its density differed in heat and cold, and  this rhythmic
expansion and contraction, -
Gave rise to several phases of existence in a gradual
process of evolution; 
Which took place in opposite directions, -
Also known as rarefaction and condensation! 
Through rarefaction the ultimate result was fire, 
Whereas condensation led to the formation of stones, 
and the crust of the earth entire! 
Condensation also produced sun and the stars! 
And with such speculations he had pre-empted our
modern day Astronomy by far! 
Aristotle quotes Anaximenes as having said, -
"As our souls, being air, hold us together, so breath
and air embrace the entire universe! "
Such were the profound thoughts of our Milesian
School of Philosophers, –
Those worthy forefathers of  Western Philosophy; 
And in their thoughts lay the seeds of future Science 

CONCLUSION
Thus I end my tribute to the Milesian trio of pioneers, 
Known as the Milesian School of philosophers! 
Let us not try to find faults with those thinkers, 
For they were the first to free themselves -
From the shackles of superstition and mythology! 
Chalking out an independent line of thought, - #
For later philosophers to improve and develop
upon! 
 (To Be Continued!)

                                                Sep FOOT NOTES: -
# = Aristotle and Sir Bertrand Russell regard Thales as the Father
of Philosophy! In Thales we see a transitory figure from the Greek 
world of mythology to the deductive and scientific world of the Mind! 
And this New direction of thought process, given by the Miletian School
of Philosophers, deserves to be applauded! 
** = Summerian (Mesopotamian)    Civilization is regarded as the oldest, 
followed by the Indus Valley, the Minoan(Crete) , and the Egyptian. 

The
last three overlap! Nile Valley (Egyptian)    lasted over two thousand years! 
$ =Carl Segan tells us that Anaximander was the first to carry out an 
experiment by planting a stick on the ground - to determine the length of the year and the seasons! 
Works of these Philosophers have not survived! We know about them 
from Aristotle and other Philosophers and Historians like Herodotus! 


You are all 

that makes America

grate


Movement, beautiful movement
comes out of stillness; 
dancers know this; 

sound, beautiful sound, 
comes out of silence; 
musicians, singers, know this; 

what then, of stillness and silence? 

Be still for a while; 
be silent for a while; 
and you will know
all you need to know

and the question, who am I? 
is answered
in stillness, in silence, 
in the riches of yourself; 
in the treasure of yourself. 

I listened to the ‘final lecture’ by Randy Pausch, 
Like so many others, 

I personally met Eric Griffiths in the Waverly Hotel, Bonnyrigg, Scotland, 
Like so many others, 

I viewed movies that were done by Patrick Swayze, 
Like so many others.

They all died of pancreatic cancer, 
Like so many others.

In Randy Pausch’s lecture he reminded us that we are on borrowed time, 
Eric Griffiths helped John and Paul out with music with words that were put into rhyme, 
Patrick Swayze had his last actor moment on A&E’s The Beast, to fight crime, 
They all lived life to its fullest, 
Like So Many Others.

I happened to come upon my medical issues, 
Like so many others, 
And had addressed what shall become of me now? 
I did not pancreatic cancer but I was in dire straits back in 
The dignity of Randy, Eric, and Patrick, 
Of a life that was well meaning, 
And by their death, a certain type of everlasting.
Like so many others, 

Their lives, -
Had not gone to waste.

hen I knocked at the doors of a beautiful soul, 
When I looked in the depth of a heart through stars, 
Those twinkle like diamonds on the face of a moon, 
I knew she is Venus and I am Mars.

Astonished I was, "Who are you? ", when she asked, 
I am one, who has died many times for you, 
The newly born body with a soul ancient, 
Smiled, exclaimed, my crimes for you! 

She was in the hands of a graceful midwife, 
Me a soul too old in a body of a child, 
The same sacred hands that touched my life, 
First time with love so soft and mild! 

In the shape of a gynecologist you touched, 
Two loving souls with your wings as a dove, 
Magic you fetched for the fates of the wretched.

Savitri Devi I imagine and see you with wings, 
Flying on skies of the lovely fairy lands, 
Many souls separated are wishing your come back, 
They are waiting for you with many garlands! 

(Savitri Devi, was a famous midwife of Gorakhpur, U. 

P., India; both me and my beloved, when came in this world, we found ourselves in the pious hands of Savitri Devi)Singlehandedly, he changed the world
With his giftedness.
And carved his way into our lives
With his geniusness. 

And how should we compare
Such fascinating mind? 
Indeed he was a genius.
He was one of a kind.

Despite his human flaws, 
He made it to the top.
The incredible inventions— 
Ambition couldn't be stopped.

Even in his last days, 
He pushed, and pushed still, 
Until his final work was done.
‘Twas such an incredible will.

And so, thanks to Steve Jobs— 
A great mind of the day—
For his contributions
In a prolific way. 

I thought upon the elderly
And whispered a prayer, 
For their sojourn here.

Such kind and gentle souls  
From generations ago, 
What they are to us, 
They will never know.

A sure and beaten path.
A guide along the way.
The dedicated laborer
Who's now old and gray.

Patriarchs and matriarchs, 
And early pioneers.
The bridge that has brought us 
As we've journeyed here.

Soldiers of great sacrifice, 
Treasured more than art.
We honor, love and cherish them
Deep within our heart. 

A masterpiece you were, 
A rare existence on this earth
A person whom we all admire.

The Missile Man of India
As you are fondly known, 
Your writings, your teachings
Only a positive ray it has shown.

You greatly inspired the young minds
By your profound deeds, 
Risen from a newspaper seller to a scientist
You have proved that hard work never cedes.

With all respect we bow to you
For your dedication, be it politics, writings or social service, 
A gem of a person as you were, 
We need you back Sir.

A TRIBUTE TO - THE  TAJ  MAHAL

On the banks of the Yamuna river lies -
An Emperor’s lamenting heart! 
His passion and love lies forever crystallized, 
In the shape of the radiant Taj! 
A poetry which was shaped in white marble
stones, 
As his suffering heart cried and moaned, 

A marvelous synthesis of Persian, Turkish, 
and Islamic art and texture, 
All blended to create this unique piece Mogul
architecture! 
Its central dome is flanked by four tapering
minarets, 
And within the dome in a jewel-inlaid cenotaph, 
Far removed from our chaotic world of threats! -
never forgets! 

The Taj reveals its subtleties under varying light
and shade, 
Radiantly opulent by day, and with its mellowed, 
fluorescent soft glow at night! 
Its precious stones of rubies, sapphires and 
amethysts, 
Inlaid in cold marble stones whiter than a dove, -
Reflects the burning passion of an Emperor’s
loving heart! 
The universal poet Tagore, had described the Taj, -
‘As a tear dropp on the cheek of time’! 
A tear dropp that still glistens and shines, -
On a silent moonlit night, as you stand and behold
the Taj! 
And in the light of day with its passing hours, 
The Taj stands like a white rose, an undying
flower! 
A tear dropp that has yet defied, the devouring
quick-sands of time! 
A tear dropp that is still wet, a tear dropp 
that has never dried! !

          PAINTINGS OF SUNFLOWERS.
 "One may have a blazing hearth in one’s soul
and yet no one ever come to sit by it. 

Passerby
see only a wisp of smoke from the chimney and
continue on the way." – Vincent Van Gogh(  

A BRIEF BIOGRAPHY
Though during his brief life-span of years he had
remained almost wholly unknown; 
His artistic talents began to exhibit itself during his 
early years, -
To become a colossus amongst post-impressionist
painters in his later years! 
The son of a Dutch clergyman, he had worked in
various capacities, -
In his uncle’s art gallery, in a bookstore, and pursued
theological studies in Amsterdam University! 
Followed by a short stint in Belgium’s coal-mining
district as a lay missionary! 
At the age of years took to painting with financial
help from elder brother Theo, 
Who encouraged and helped him for the next ten years 
or so! 
This was the most creative period of  Vincent’s life, 
Followed by an attack of dementia when he cut his
own ear lobe risking his life! 
On h July  he shot himself, bringing his
great artistic career to a tragic end! 

SERIES OF SUNFLOWER PAINTINGS
Vincent commenced his famous sunflower series
to decorate his house in Arles, France, 
Anticipating his friend Paul Gaugin’s visit in 
advance! 
His first four canvases had paintings of cut sun-
flowers in bunches of twos and fours; 
Painted in Paris during Aug-Sep  which the
world adores! 
But his later Arles series of seven still life canvases 
are better known to us, 
And this series of paintings had made Vincent
internationally famous! 
The most valued of these seven is a vase containing
a bunch of sunflowers, -
Now displayed at the Art Museum in the city of Tokyo; 
A Japanese firm had paid million dollars at an
auction for this masterpiece to show! ! 

Vincent brought his passion for sunflowers from his
homeland in Holland, 
Which became synonymous with him like those water
lilies with his contemporary painter  Monet! 
Vincent painted the various stages of the flower’s bloom, 
From its glowing stage till it wilted and swooned! 
Chrome yellow and yellow ochre made them look fresh, 
And arid brown and somber shades for its wilted stage! 
Thus his paintings covered all angles of spectrum of life
itself, -
In turn reaching a deeper understanding of how all living 
things are tied together and made! 
His explosive energy was displayed through his vibrant 
shades of yellow, 
Using red  for passion, and green for conflict to show! 
Grey shades for life’s inevitable surrender, and blue with
infinity; 
Thus this Dutch impressionist painter harnessed  a
moment of time in eternity! 
                                                    Sep FOOT NOTES: -
Since I do drawing & painting at times, for a long time I was wanting to write this tribute! 
 Dr  Jan Hulsker, a foremost scholar on Van Gogh, had said that 
this Sunflower series of  paintings brought Vincent eternal acclaim & fame! 
During his short life span he made paintings,drawings,lithographs & one etching! 
His Potatoe Eaters, Red Vineyard, Starry Night - are all famous 
Paintings! Paul Gaugin &Claude Monet were his other Impressionist contemporaries.
Impressionism emphasized changing qualities of light & color, visible brush strokes, open composition, - creating an impression of a
 moment of time! Got its name from Claude Monet’s harbour painting - ‘Impressions & Sunrise’! This art form became popular in  and !

An enjoyable experience taht I ever had in life
Was my trip to THANDIANI and its beautiful drive
The roads of that place were very narrow
So we drove very carefully by following the arrow

That place was full of grass taht're green
That's why the spot is a perfect scene
Along with thousands of small flowing streams
That help in summer when weather is extreme

And the trees are huge with miles of shades
That comes in handy and acts as an aid
To all those birds who lie down there
And other small animals who liove somewhere near

that place was calm and had serenity for treasure
That brought me tons of happiness and pleasure
And was open for all those who really adore
And are always ready to see some more

So whenever I don't have anything to do
I close my eyes and reacll all that view
Nature's beauty without paying any fee. 

That morning's trip
Was such a jolly grip
That's taken the swallow
In full glee
To stop near the firm Tree.

So amazing to see it anew
'Twas an inspirational view
Blessed by the sunlight
Sustaining it upright
After the dawn's soft dew.

Birds flutter their wings
With joy when the swallow sings
And foolishly rehearse their flight
Undulating, nigh reaching the sky's height
Until the swallow to the Tree clings. 

My old bicycle was clinking soft
As I pedalled down the plains
Dews were getting crushed under the wheel
Flinging up to trousers some muddy stains

The paths were narrow flanked by
Grasses and wild flowers on both sides
Far away on the left of me I could see
The endless sea and its raging tides

The mystic hills stand on my right
With serpentine paths wounding to the tops
My face seemed wet and hair flowed wild
As breeze flowed over patches of golden crops

Pedalling down a slope I could see
The winged visitors gathered on the trees
Riot of colours stretched to the horizon
With fragrance rising amidst restless bees

Before crossing a runnel I stood
For a while to watch the clouds above
With darkness thickening around them
They were approaching towards the grove

Many a voices were singing a song
Of some tragic tale happened long ago
About a pair of lovers who were found dead
When farmers were in fields to plough and sow

An arrow of sadness pierced through
My heart as the tone rose and fell
I could not find from where it was coming
Though my eyes ran far and wide across the dale

They must be somewhere not far from
Where I stood, sowing seeds bending low
There the cows stopped grazing and looked 
For a while with their paces going slow

Emerging from void a string of birds flew
To their nests, to feed the nestlings and sleep
Corns should be bound in bundles and stacked
Before the darkness would gather deep

Though many a races have born and died
The beauty around is still inspiring and raw
Before I rode back to my cottage for rest
I bowed my head to Him in wonder and awe

In the Commune's closing days, 
Had captured a crowd of rebels 
By the wall of Pere-la-Chaise. 

There were desperate men, wild women, 
And dark-eyed Amazon girls, 
And one little boy, with a peach-down cheek 
And yellow clustering curls. 

The captain seized the little waif, 
And said, "What dost thou here?" 
"Sapristi, Citizen captain! 
I'm a Communist, my dear!" 

"Very well! Then you die with the others!" 
"Very well! That's my affair; 
But first let me take to my mother, 
Who lives by the wine-shop there, 

"My father's watch. You see it; 
A gay old thing, is it not? 
It would please the old lady to have it, 
Then I'll come back here, and be shot
 


"That is the last we shall see of him," 
The grizzled captain grinned, 
As the little man skimmed down the hill, 
Like a swallow down the wind. 

For the joy of killing had lost its zest 
In the glut of those awful days, 
And Death writhed, gorged like a greedy snake, 
From the Arch to Pere-la-Chaise. 

But before the last platoon had fired, 
The child's shrill voice was heard; 
"Houp-là! the old girl made such a row 
I feared I should break my word
 


Against the bullet-pitted wall 
He took his place with the rest, 
A button was lost from his ragged blouse, 
Which showed his soft white breast. 

"Now blaze away, my children! 
With your little one-two-three!" 
The Chassepots tore the stout young heart, 
And saved Society. 

The Sun woke me this morning loud 
and clear, saying "Hey! I've been 
trying to wake you up for fifteen 
minutes. Don't be so rude, you are 
only the second poet I've ever chosen 
to speak to personally

so why
aren't you more attentive? If I could 
burn you through the window I would 
to wake you up. I can't hang around 
here all day


 "Sorry, Sun, I stayed
up late last night talking to Hal


"When I woke up Mayakovsky he was 
a lot more prompt" the Sun said 
petulantly. "Most people are up 
already waiting to see if I'm going 
to put in an appearance


I tried
to apologize "I missed you yesterday

"
"That's better" he said. "I didn't 
know you'd come out

" "You may be 
wondering why I've come so close?" 
"Yes" I said beginning to feel hot 
wondering if maybe he wasn't burning me 
anyway.

 "Frankly I wanted to tell you 
I like your poetry. I see a lot 
on my rounds and you're okay. You may 
not be the greatest thing on earth, but 
you're different. Now, I've heard some 
say you're crazy, they being excessively 
calm themselves to my mind, and other 
crazy poets think that you're a boring 
reactionary. Not me.

 Just keep on 
like I do and pay no attention. You'll 
find that people always will complain 
about the atmosphere, either too hot 
or too cold too bright or too dark, days
too short or too long.

If you don't appear
at all one day they think you're lazy
or dead. Just keep right on, I like it.

And don't worry about your lineage 
poetic or natural. The Sun shines on 
the jungle, you know, on the tundra 
the sea, the ghetto. Wherever you were 
I knew it and saw you moving. I was waiting 
for you to get to work.

 And now that you 
are making your own days, so to speak, 
even if no one reads you but me 
you won't be depressed. Not 
everyone can look up, even at me. It 
hurts their eyes

"
 "Oh Sun, I'm so grateful to you!"

"Thanks and remember I'm watching. It's 
easier for me to speak to you out 
here. I don't have to slide down 
between buildings to get your ear. 
I know you love Manhattan, but 
you ought to look up more often.

And
always embrace things, people earth 
sky stars, as I do, freely and with 
the appropriate sense of space. That 
is your inclination, known in the heavens 
and you should follow it to hell, if 
necessary, which I doubt.

 Maybe we'll 
speak again in Africa, of which I too 
am specially fond. Go back to sleep now 
Frank, and I may leave a tiny poem 
in that brain of yours as my farewell


"Sun, don't go!" I was awake
at last. "No, go I must, they're calling
me

"
 "Who are they?"

 Rising he said "Some
day you'll know. They're calling to you
too

" Darkly he rose, and then I slept.

Except for A broken heart
Nothing left

A TRUE CONFESSION! 

Which you had created in just seven days; 
I am one of your many sinful slaves, 
Confessing to wash my sins away! 
In my young days I never visited your
house of prayers, 
Nor did I keep fast on Sabbath Days! 
A conceited life I had generally led, -
Losing Your thoughts and going astray! 

This world has not remained the same dear
Which You had created in just seven days! 
People only think about their pleasures, 
Material culture has taken its sway! 
Money and sex are like two poles, 
On which this world revolves these days! 
Your erring slaves may yet amend their 
 ways! 

I fear Your angels don’t inform you these
days! 
This world has become very volatile, -
Which you had created in just seven days! 
Terrorism now has spread out its wings, 
And killing has become a recreational
game! 
Humanity has become a forgotten thing, 
And people forget to take Your name! 

Which you had created in only seven days! 
But your slaves still fear you thunderbolts, -
And only in pain and suffering remember 
Your name! 
And this true confession I now make; 
Only then we shall remember to take
Your  name! ’

A true friend is always there for you
A true friend will help you no matter ther problem
A true friend is like a sister, she knows your better, than you know yourself
A true friend is someone who knows when you're sad, ans can cheer you up when you need it most
A true friend is someone that can make you laugh no matter what they say or do
A true friend is someone who believes in you
A true friend will stick by your side
A true friend is someone you can call just if you need a shoulder to lean on
But most of all a true friend will never leave you

(I was nice with him
he was nice with me, 
and the friendship continued, 
until he started ignoring me! 
I know I must have committed something wrong, 
but he never told me what's that something, 
Instead of ignoring if he would have slapped me, 
and said, "You my ugly friend, you did it with me! "
I would have encircled him in my arms and would have replied, 
"I am sorry sweetheart; I don't know how I did it? 
Another slap on my left cheek, it's closer to my heart, 
but only if you are a lovely true friend

"a true friend will be there no mater what
a true friend would be there like a shot
a true friend is honest and true
a true friend will cheer you up when your blue
a true friend knows your every secret
a true friend knows your every regret
a true friend will catch you when you fall
but, my friend would you even move at all~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hold my branch, through time
Rhyme with honest lines
Watch my back, I'll  watch yours
Stand with me in the storms
Strengthen me when I'm down
Understand my flaws
Control your emotions
Trust me, I'll trust you
In the heat of a fight
No one knows who's right
Don't use words to fright
After dark comes light
If you're still in sight
After the deadly storms
I know you are one

~ May too much 

as  the rain 
to the cloud 

and you are so  tuckered out 
that you  can't bear

any more
the weight and  pressure 

your legs are dead 
you feel burned out 

and out of coldness 
you condense and freeze 

though you try hard 
to conceal 

but the wind knows all 
and tells


 different stories 
with hundred photographs 

real and genuine 
 through your  

beautiful and bright eyes
only a true friend knows 

how to read 
and what goes inside your soul.

A friend for every moment of the day
A friend with embracing smile, heart's joy ray
A friend who's there in time of need
A friend who plods you to succeed
A friend who is real and dear to me
A friend who cajoles and pushes my best to be
A friend whom I shudder and tremble to lose
A friend without I am lost! 
A friend I would treasure at any cost
A friend whether up or down I'd care
A friend in time of need I'd be there
A friend whose fire burns bright and strong
A friend warms one out in the cold so long
A friend who cares
A friend who shares
A friend who dares
A friend -who lives for all eternity


I feel the joy surround me, 
My face brightens up full
of happy smiles.

Those dark clouds turn into
white fluffy clouds, 
Surrounded by the beautiful
sunshine.

My world suddenly turns into
one big world of happiness, 
Where all my frowns become
just an old memory.

A calm sensation fills me
deep inside, 
A comforting feeling that
never leaves my side.

It is a place where I can
always feel welcomed at all
times, 
A place where I can be myself.

Whenever you're near me I 
always feel surrounded by
the most happiest thoughts
and joyous feelings.

For all these things are how
you make me feel, 
That is how a true friendship
should always be. 

Give me a kiss to show
me how much you love me, 
A Kiss that will make 
me tingle all over.

A kiss I will never
forget, 
A kiss that I will
always remember
day and night.

I want a kiss that will
never fade away, 
A kiss that will last
forever.

The one kiss I truly 
want in my life, 
Is a kiss from the one
that is meant for me, 
That is the true kiss
I really want. 

Good heaven's above
you ask could it be love
Darn right you are
and from so afar
Tis like manna from heaven
and I do confess
A limited edition
brings me this bliss
Cadbury's still can out do
with coconut & cashews too
A birthday treat from above
Chocolate is my one true love


True love is like 
a treasure, 
You keep it close
to you, 
Forever keeping it
close to your heart.

True love is happiness, 
When you can laugh
together, 
Smiles, tickles and
kisses.

Your first love can 
be your first lesson, 
If things appear to 
not be working out, 
You move on and find
another love that
will make you happy.

Sometimes the second
or third can be just 
the same, 
True love has many
lessons to be learned, 
With each one that 
comes and goes in your
life.

Put those many lessons
to work, 
Then it will give you
better ideas to know
exactly what you are
truly looking for in
a relationship.

Everyone has a true 
love, 
It is always a matter 
of patience and waiting
for that special spark
that bonds two souls
together.

Never despair or feel
discouraged to try 
again, 
You will soon find
that someone to share
all the giggles and
laughter with.

Once you have found that
flame that sparks your 
life, 
Cherish the love you 
have achieved, 
Always keeping yourself
and your true love happy.

Fill your relationship
with plenty of faith, 
Many people may attempt 
to lead you two astray, 
Faith will always be a
strong protection.

Never give up on your
long quest for true 
love, 
In the end you will
always find what you
have always been
searching for, 
A true love that will
make your world shine. 

A mother's love is consistent 
and patient, it will never fade. 
A mother's love is warm and 
compassionate, even in the  
shade. A mother's love will 
always help you through the 
weakest hours. A mother's love 
is always like a bouquet of  
flowers. A mother's love is 
strong and will never steer 
you wrong. A true mother's  
love is beautiful in many ways. 
A true mother's love is sincere 
and it takes a mother's love to 
conquer our fears. A true mother's  
love knows the depth of love. A 
true mother's love is contentment, 
love is absolutely all of the above. 

I know a girl
who jumped out of a window
because she couldn't
have a fix

She broke her back
and her dignity
Lost her kids
and her dealers run away

I know a girl
who told everyone she was rich
so they would lend her a fix

They'll be calling 
for their money today
I bet there's nobody there

She'll be somewhere else
giving someone else 
her despair


Little Ann and her mother were walking one day
Through London's wide city so fair,
And business obliged them to go by the way
That led them through Cavendish Square. 
A beautiful chariot there came,
To take some most elegant ladies abroad, 
Who straightway got into the same. 

The ladies in feathers and jewels were seen,
The chariot was painted all o'er, 
The footmen behind were in silver and green,
The horses were prancing before. 

Little Ann by her mother walk'd silent and sad,
A tear trickled down from her eye, 
Till her mother said, "Ann, I should be very glad
To know what it is makes you cry. " 

"Mamma," said the child, "see that carriage so fair, 
All cover'd with varnish and gold, 
Those ladies are riding so charmingly there
While we have to walk in the cold. 

But surely it cannot be true; 
Or else I am certain, almost, that He would
Give such a fine carriage to you. " 

"Look there, little girl," said her mother, "and see
What stands at that very coach door;
A poor ragged beggar, and listen how she
A halfpenny tries to implore. 

"All pale is her face, and deep sunk is her eye,
And her hands look like skeleton's bones;
She has got a few rags, just about her to tie,
And her naked feet bleed on the stones. " 

'Dear ladies,' she cries, and the tears trickle down, 
'Relieve a poor beggar, I pray;
I've wander'd all hungry about this wide town,
And not ate a morsel to-day. 

'My father and mother are long ago dead,
My brother sails over the sea, 
And I've scarcely a rag, or a morsel of bread,
As plainly, I'm sure, you may see. 

'A fever I caught, which was terrible bad, 
But no nurse or physic had I; 
An old dirty shed was the house that I had,
And only on straw could I lie. 

'And now that I'm better, yet feeble and faint, 
And famish'd, and naked, and cold,
I wander about with my grievous complaint, 
And seldom get aught but a scold. 

'Some will not attend to my pitiful call,
Some think me a vagabond cheat;
And scarcely a creature relieves me, of all
The thousands that traverse the street. 

'Then ladies, dear ladies, your pity bestow:'­
Just then a tall footman came round,
And asking the ladies which way they would go,
The chariot turn'd off with a bound. 

"Ah! see, little girl," then her mother replied,
"How foolish those murmurs have been;
You have but to look on the contrary side,
To learn both your folly and sin. 

"This poor little beggar is hungry and cold,
No mother awaits her return;
And while such an object as this you behold,
Your heart should with gratitude burn. 

"Your house and its comforts, your food and your friends,
Have you any claim to the bounty He sends, 
Who makes you to differ from her? 

"A coach, and a footman, and gaudy attire,
Give little true joy to the breast; 
To be good is the thing you should chiefly desire,

you stand grim
on hopeless victims
you dance grotesque
on helpless corps

the doctrines were learned
change and make you full of hatred
the dogmas were preached
change and make you full of greed

how dare you become destroyer? 
how dare you kill creature? 
how dare you spread fear? 
how dare you pour terror? 

why your eyes can't hear
the scream of those women? 
why your eyes can' see clear
the blood of those children? 

I feel it's not your ears
which def but your hearts
I feel it's not your eyes
which blind but your senses

was Moses teaching you
to attack civilization? 
was Aaron guiding you
to break affection? 

why are all the leaders mute? 
why are all the doors shut? 
wake up and send troop
to defend land of hope

do we need Federico Garcia Lorca now? 
do we need Martin Luther King, Jr now? 
do we need Florence Nightingale now? 
do we need Sultan Saladin now? 

who can punish you
to stop evil in you

go fight for freedom! 
challenge for wisdom! 
stand up for human rights! 


They shot suddenly
Everybody shocked
Ten places ruined
Everywhere weep deeply

They attacked brutally
Everybody screamed
Tourist spots damaged
Everywhere wound totally

So many people died
Why do they always kill? 
Why should they force a will? 
So many children cried

So many visitors feel horrible
Why do they wildly hurt others? 
Why they don’t feel sorry to others? 
So many hearts sense terrible

We perform Tchaikovsky’s Pathetique Symphony for you
We perform Beethoven’s Eroica Symphony for you
We perform Sibelius’ Second Symphony for you

Are there still fighting between
King Rama and King Rahwana? 
Are there still a massive battle
The Pandawa against The Kurawa? 

We together hope for your peaceful days
We together pray for your sincerest moments
We together stand by your side, friends
We together challenge at your side, friends

Please, don’t let their darkest thoughts
Sink your warmest charms, O Mumbai! 
Please, don’t let their blackest desires
Destroy your brightest shines, O Mumbai! 

They can’t bury your gorgeous files
They can’t crack your lovely nuances
They can’t steal your honest fragrances
They can’t cover your wonderful smiles

(with deepest mourning for Mumbai’s victims)A mother, who vast Pleasure finds
In modelling her Childrens Minds;
With whom, in exquisite Delight,
She passes many a Winter Night;
Mingles in ev'ry Play, to find
What Byass Nature gave the Mind;
Resolving thence to take her Aim,
To guide them to the Realms of Fame;
And wisely make those Realms their Way
To Regions of eternal Day;
Each boist'rous Passion to controul,
And early humanize the Soul;
In simple Tales, beside the Fire,
The noblest Notions would inspire:
Her Children, conscious of her Care,
Transported, hung around her Chair.

Whose Names they lisp'd, ere they could spell:
The Mother then, delighted, smiles;
And shews the Story on the Tiles.

At other Times, her Themes would be
The Sages of Antiquity;
Who left immortal Names behind,
By proving Blessings to their Kind.
Again, she takes another Scope,
And tells of Addison, and Pope.

Studious to let her Children know
The various Turns of Things below;--
How Virtue here was oft oppress'd,
To shine more glorious with the Bless'd;
Told Tully's and the Gracchi's Doom,
The Patriots, and the Pride of Rome.
Then bless'd the Drapier's happier Fate,
Who sav'd, and lives to guard the State.

Some Comedies gave great Delight,
And entertain'd them many a Night:
Others could no Admittance find,
Forbid, as Poison to the Mind:
Those Authors Wit and Sense, said she,
But heighten their Impiety.

This happy Mother met, one Day,
The Book of Fables, writ by Gay;
And told her Children, Here's a Treasure,
A Fund of Wisdom, and of Pleasure!
Such Morals, and so finely writ;
Such Decency, good Sense, and Wit!
Well has the Poet found the Art,
To raise the Mind, and mend the Heart.

Her fav'rite Son the Volume seiz'd;
And, as he read, seem'd highly pleas'd;
Made such Reflections ev'ry Page;
The Mother thought above his Age;
Delighted read, but scarce was able
To finish the concluding Fable.

What ails my Child? the Mother cries:
Whose Sorrows now have fill'd your Eyes?
O dear Mamma, can he want Friends,
Who writes for such exalted Ends?
O base, degen'rate human Kind!
Had I a Fortune to my Mind,
Should Gay complain? But now, alas!
Thro' what a World am I to pass?
Where Friendship is an empty Name,
And Merit scarcely paid in Fame?

Resolv'd to lull his Woes to Rest,
She tells him, He should hope the best:
This has been yet Gay's Case, I own;
But now his Merit's amply known.
Content that tender Heart of thine:
He'll be the Care of Caroline.
Who thus instructs the royal Race,
Must have a Pension, or a Place.

And such a Book were writ for me,
I find 'tis so much to your Taste,
That Gay would keep his Coach at least.

My Son, what you suppose, is true:
I see its Excellence in you.
Poets who write to mend the Mind,
A royal Recompence should find.
But I am barr'd by Fortune's Frowns,
From the best Privilege of Crowns;
The glorious, godlike Pow'r to bless,
And raise up Merit in Distress.

But, dear Mamma, I long to know,

What I'd bestow, says she, my Dear?
At least, a thousand Pounds a Year. 

A true wish plays an important part
That comes right in from the heart

And say from us things we mean
To say to others with interest and keen

For true wish can enrich ones life
And brings happiness to all who survive

And be a friend forever in need
And perform for others good deed

And surely that is all very true
Specially when I'm talking about you. 

So you think I'm a true psycho, serial killer, soul stealer? 
'Well no not exactly, I just think you quite perverted and disturbed.'
Really keep honoring me such kind words.
You batting a thousand so far.
'What hell is wrong with you? '
'I don't think that's something you should be proud of.'
Pride is a shameful thing ain't it.
'You mean 'isn't it'? '
So now you are really correcting me.
Congratulation. 
My grammar can be fixed, my personality can not.
No matter how warped the interpretation.
So what is it you want from me? 
'Well nothing, you started this unnerving conversation.'
Good then I can end it right.
You have any objections? 
'Yes you're being mean.'
'I didn't do anything to you.'
I'm sorry but the last time I checked I didn't have to validate feelings expressed to anyone but myself.
Did I miss something in this conversation? 
Was it hiding in some dark corner where I wasn't looking? 
Or was it the words that didn't come out of your mouth.
'You know what I've had enough, I'm no longer going talk to you.'
Well if you allowed me to you wouldn't have had to.
But you were so certain I didn't have the right to be excused. 

while eating thanksgiving dinner
a sense of deja vu stubbornly lasts
fuzzy memories, left-overs frozen in time
of other such re-pasts


A ten year old with chilled water bottles in hand
Runs as cars halt, and traffic signal turns red.
On a hot sultry day, says to the lady, it’s a good brand.
Wipes his nose with his torn shirt sleeve, as it bled.

A kind man gently took him under the shade, 
Uncapped and poured the chilled water on his head.
Drop by dropp fed him with spoon some lemonade.
But for the Good Samaritan, would he be dead? 

In a short while, the boy came round, a lot flushed.
Looked at the elderly man, gratitude writ large on his face.
Son, rest a while, don’t go in Sun to sell water in a rush.

Am the sole bread winner, as my father died in a cyclone.
Who can quarrel with what he ordains and wills-? 
I don’t have the luxury or the time to sit and mourn, 
Live in the past, or sit back and rest, when a wee bit ill.

Stoically stood up, and ran after the screeching cars.
Waving bottles in the air: please buy one for the road.
He should be in school, I thought watching from afar.
He learns all the things on the road- in no time had all sold. 

I was offering you
A glass of water
You asked for
The flower
I was wearing on my hair
A small tube rose
You insisted for
Only that one
I wore
Gladly you tucked it
On your shirt
And went away
Wearing my heart
On your heart
Did you know
I was going with you? 
Over the years
Is the tube rose still there? 
How many times
Has that scene replayed
Through the memory's window? 
Every time 
I see a tube-rose
Or a rose
Or any other flower
I feel overwhelmed
By the fragrance
As it is not you or me
But the love
That filled the small tube rose. 

Many years before
They had made a pact
On a Tuesday in June
That should they
Both be alone
On this particular Tuesday in June
They would meet 
At the same Antique store

As she walked through the doorway
She was pleasantly surprised
To find 
An antique. 
Very much to her liking

Dee Daffodil (HW)  January,lax stems pierce pale blue skies 
a tui in flight alights upon black flax stems 


A long way my dear so
When you're down and feel upset
Then don't ever in life let
The burning candle of hope to die
Or even a tear to dropp from the eye
Just hang in there with a smile
For it surely help to go for a while
And wait 'n hope to see the spring
Which has the power to soon bring
Everything shine with sunshine bright
And put it in their places right
So for that what you have to do in pain
Is to look for a tune of joy and fain.


I touch the thorns
To feel the pricks
I live with dreams
To witness many tricks

All my dreams are
Unreal and insipid
You refuse to come
And they start to bleed


Dusk is thy dawn; when Eve puts on its state
Of gold and purple in the marbled west,
Thou comest forth like some embodied trait,
Or dim conceit, a lily bud confessed;
Or of a rose the visible wish; that, white,
Goes softly messengering through the night,
Whom each expectant flower makes its guest.

All day the primroses have thought of thee,
Their golden heads close-haremed from the heat;
All day the mystic moonflowers silkenly
Veiled snowy faces,-that no bee might greet,
Or butterfly that, weighed with pollen, passed;-
Keeping Sultana charms for thee, at last,
Their lord, who comest to salute each sweet.

Cool-throated flowers that avoid the day's
Too fervid kisses; every bud that drinks
The tipsy dew and to the starlight plays
Nocturnes of fragrance, thy wing'd shadow links
In bonds of secret brotherhood and faith;
O bearer of their order's shibboleth,
Like some pale symbol fluttering o'er these pinks.

What dost them whisper in the balsam's ear
That sets it blushing, or the hollyhock's,-
A syllabled silence that no man may hear,-
As dreamily upon its stem it rocks?
What spell dost bear from listening plant to plant,
Like some white witch, some ghostly ministrant,
Some specter of some perished flower of phlox?

O voyager of that universe which lies
Between the four walls of this garden fair,-
Whose constellations are the fireflies
That wheel their instant courses everywhere,-
Mid faery firmaments wherein one sees
Mimic Booetes and the Pleiades,
Thou steerest like some faery ship of air.

Gnome-wrought of moonbeam-fluff and gossamer,
Silent as scent, perhaps thou chariotest
Mab or King Oberon; or, haply, her
Oh for the herb, the magic euphrasy,
That should unmask thee to mine eyes, ah me!
And all that world at which my soul hath guessed

All day the primroses have thought of thee,
Their golden heads close-haremed from the heat;
All day the mystic moonflowers silkenly
Veiled snowy faces, that no bee might greet
Or butterfly that, weighed with pollen, passed;
Keeping Sultana-charms for thee, at last,
Their lord, who comest to salute each sweet.

Cool-throated flowers that avoid the day's
Too fervid kisses; every bud that drinks
The tipsy dew and to the starlight plays
Nocturns of fragrance, thy wing'd shadow links
In bonds of secret brotherhood and faith;
O bearer of their order's shibboleth,
Like some pale symbol fluttering o'er these pinks.

What dost thou whisper in the balsam's ear
That sets it blushing, or the hollyhock's,
A syllabled silence that no man may hear,
As dreamily upon its stem it rocks?
What spell dost bear from listening plant to plant,
Like some white witch, some ghostly ministrant,
Some spectre of some perished flower of phlox?

O voyager of that universe which lies
Between the four walls of this garden fair,
Whose constellations are the fireflies
That wheel their instant courses everywhere'
'Mid fairy firmaments wherein one sees
Mimic Boötes and the Pleiades,
Thou steerest like some fairy ship-of-air.

Gnome-wrought of moonbeam fluff and gossamer,
Silent as scent, perhaps thou chariotest
Mab or King Oberon; or, haply, her
Oh for the herb, the magic euphrasy,
That should unmask thee to mine eyes, ah me!
And all that world at which my soul hath guessed

When there was still day light lingering
And the wind was upon the leaves
And every leaf trembled at its touch
On his balcony, he lazily sat.

His mind strayed like a vagabond
Through the strange terrains of dreams, 
Never settling anywhere 
Hovering over myriad things

He was on the fringe of another world
Idly watching the shadows chasing the light
And the autumn clouds scurrying past 
In endless quest across the sky

Feeling the breath of passing breeze 
He wasn't sure how long he sat there, 
In his trance, did he hear a grating sound? 
Yes, a rusty window opened somewhere
It was in the house opposite to his 
In dim light, he saw a face behind the veil
A full moon eclipsed by the clouds
In that golden dusk, her face was a water lily
Bloomed in a still lagoon edged by moonlight 
And her glittering eyes
Had the shine of a thousand stars
And in an instant they got locked in his

Taking his violin, he moved his fingers on its strings
From it, flowed a sweet song of love
He saw her rising slowly from where she sat
And coming closer, she parted the curtain
And smiled at him a gentle seductive smile
As if proclaiming aloud- ‘I love you'! 

He fell into a swoon, knew a sweet sensation
Creeping onto him, drowning him inch by inch
They were so close, only eyelids away
And how he wished to be meshed into her! 
A thousand ‘diyas' were lit in the caverns of his heart
Sure it was a ‘diwali' night for him

For long he carried the memory 
Of her passionate glance and lovely smile
Thrown across to him from an open window
On a mild windy night of song, silence and shadows
Again and again it awakened in him
A wistful longing, he hardly could resist
Until it became a picture frozen in time

On that gathering dusk, lit in golden glow
Did he rob her in secret and carry her unawares, 
On the languid wings of his song
Or when she broke open that window, 
Did she break open his heart too
And enter it unbidden

A song of the evening
Wow! ! ! ! ! I behold the scene 
In that city of love
In XTS I devour
All the verses 
poured out 
on scraps of petals 
never say thou
at sunset the gathering
with goblet in hand
waiting at taverns
like a pilgrim forlorn
with tearful eyes
that I have forgotten
thy love filled eyes.

Under that banyan tree-
yes under that banyan tree
the skies so clear
a promise we made
holding hands
thus love we proclaimed
the world did see
Recession or no recession
In  verses we poured
The angels sang with us
The seraphs retired on high
The stars broke out
In ethereal blues 
And myriad hues

How can’st one say
First make the sun
in private shine
And bid the moon 
to wane in crescents divine
So that he may
his beams confine
In answer to thine sublime
That after 
the floodlight of morn azure
And fullfilment of desires
We face not  each other.

Know ye once again
And see my face
Need not be illusions
Make them real
Whirl up thy head
And screw up thy heart
And make this 
A TWILIGHT SONG
A SONG OF THE EVENING
Forever to last.






There was a star that shone so bright—
Gleaming in the darkest night.
It was seen from shore to shore
Until one day, it was no more; 
The star fell from its height. 

A minds sudden collaboration.
Star studded fascination, if I touch it I will know it.
If I know it I will own it.
Be the mighty master.
With the wave of the hands.
Hear the demands and make this happen.
The crowd speaks, the crowd roars.
Chants of the everlasting.
Spirits forever roaming.
All consuming, oh I never want to stop.
Even if the needle drops.
Always so clumsy with the double edge sword.
One day it will be me who gets impaled.
One day it will be me gasping for air.
Today it is but candle stick that stands tall with a mighty dancing flame.
Wild and untamed.
A gallant ruthless ambitious beast.
Who will never be satisfied with a single feast.
Indulge in my little treat.
Blood licking sweet.
It's raining candy canes.
And as they fall I can still imagine the words is that all? 
Never is it enough.
Wicked is the gravy.
Taking a train head on.
Somebody please save me.
When I act like this it is so dangerous.
Nothing to lose.
An overdose in clues.
A little pink note book with all the fairy tales locked away.
In the dungeon, the lair forever to keep.
My very own precious.
Petty, yet alluring to all the wrong demons.
The monster inside screams in glee.
If I could ever be so happy this might be it.
The wounding arrow must have missed.
Because this is both heaven and bliss in one great succulent kiss.
The pleasure is all mine.
A pulsing skin reaching right in.
First contact of an encounter unlike any other kind.
If this is alien, all that is foreign is more then welcome.
This is a invitation with a contract of souls.
Chain me to this beat, chain me to this retreat.
Forgive me if I seem overly excited, I just hope this process gets expedited.
Need my signature, watch me bleed.
This will be the closing chapter in a book never read.
With so many words left unsaid, I don't care the price put on my head.
Worthy deemed the cause.
Elusive the spirit which was never met to be caught.
Nets made out of silver, bear traps made out of gold.
Behold I'm just not sold, not a dollar spent towards this dissociative disease.
Go ahead put a gun against my head and tell me to get on my knees.
You might get a better response if you say please.
Escaping the reality.
I'm smiling as I will in my very last moments of a good life lived.
There were some great experiences.
And those treasure are all mine, no matter the set given amount of time. 



To a Madonna

Votive Offering in the Spanish Style

I want to build for you, Madonna, my mistress, 
An underground altar in the depths of my grief 
And carve out in the darkest corner of my heart, 
Far from worldly desires and mocking looks, 
A niche, all enameled with azure and with gold, 
Where you shall stand, amazed Statue; 
With my polished Verses as a trellis of pure metal 
Studded cunningly with rhymes of crystal, 
I shall make for your head an immense Crown, 
And from my Jealousy, O mortal Madonna, 
I shall know how to cut a cloak in a fashion, 
Barbaric, heavy, and stiff, lined with suspicion, 
Which, like a sentry-box, will enclose your charms; 
Embroidered not with Pearls, but with all of my Tears! 
Your Gown will be my Desire, quivering, 
Undulant, my Desire which rises and which falls, 
Balances on the crests, reposes in the troughs, 
And clothes with a kiss your white and rose body. 
Of my Self-respect I shall make you Slippers 
Of satin which, humbled by your divine feet, 
Will imprison them in a gentle embrace, 
And assume their form like a faithful mold;


If I can't, in spite of all my painstaking art,
Carve a Moon of silver for your Pedestal, 
I shall put the Serpent which is eating my heart 
Under your heels, so that you may trample and mock, 
That monster all swollen with hatred and spittle. 
You will see my Thoughts like Candles in rows 
Starring with their reflections the azure ceiling, 
And watching you always with eyes of fire. 
And since my whole being admires and loves you, 
All will become Storax, Benzoin, Frankincense, Myrrh, 
And ceaselessly toward you, white, snowy pinnacle, 
My turbulent spirit will rise like a vapor.

Finally, to complete your role of Mary,
And to mix love with inhumanity,
Infamous pleasure! of the seven deadly sins,
I, torturer full of remorse, shall make seven
Well sharpened Daggers and, like a callous juggler,
Taking your deepest love for a target,
I shall plant them all in your panting Heart,
In your sobbing Heart, in your bleeding Heart!



To a Madonna 


(Ex Voto in Spanish Style)

I'd build, Madonna, love, for my belief, 
An altar in the dim crypt of my grief, 
And in the darkest comer of my heart, 
From mortal lust and mockery far apart, 
Scoop you a niche, with gold and azure glaze, 
Where you would stand in wonderment and gaze, 
With my pure verses trellised, and all round 
In constellated rhymes of crystal bound: 
And with a huge tiara richly crowned. 
Out of the Jealousy which rules my passion, 
Mortal Madonna, I a cloak would fashion, 
Barbarous, stiff, and heavy with my doubt, 
Whereon as in a fourm you would fill out 
And mould your lair. Of tears, not pearls, would be 
The sparkle of its rich embroidery: 
Your robe would be my lust, with waving flow, 
Poising on tips, in valleys lying low, 
And clothing, in one kiss, coral and snow. 
In my Respect (for satin) you'll be shod 
Which your white feet would humble to the clod, 
While prisoning their flesh with tender hold 
It kept their shape imprinted like a mould. 
If for a footstool to support your shoon, 
For all my art, I could not get the moon, 
I'd throw the serpent, that devours my vitals
Under your trampling heels for his requitals, 
That monstrous worm blown-up with hate and spittle. 
Round you my thoughts like candles should be seen
Reflected on a roof that's painted blue, 
And aiming all their golden eyes at you. 
Since nought is in me that you do not stir, 
All will be incense, benjamin, and myrrh, 
And up to you, white peak, in clouds will soar 
My stormy soul, in rapture, to adore.

In fine, your role of Mary to perfect 
And mingle barbarism with respect — 
Of seven deadly sins, O black delight! 
Remorseful torturer, to show my sleight, 
I'll forge and sharpen seven deadly swords 
And like a callous juggler on the boards, 
Taking it for my target, I would dart 
Them deep into your streaming, sobbing heart.



À une Madone

I'll build for thee, Madonna, mistress mine,
deep in my crypt of woe a secret shrine;
— carve in the blackest corner of my heart,
from worldly lust and mocking eyes apart,
a niche, with gold and blue enamel blent,
to hold thy statue filled with wonderment.
my polished verse, of virgin metal hard
with crystal rhymes artistically starred,
shall raise for thee a towering diadem;
and from my jealousy I'll cut and hem
a mangle, mortal Lady mine, designed
as 'twere a sentry-box, stiff, heavy, lined
with barbs of keen suspicion and with fears,
embroidered, not with pearls, but all my tears!
to make thy robe I'll give thee my desire
that rises, falls and quivers like a fire,
clings to each summit, rests in each abyss, 
and clothes thy rosy body with a kiss.
of my respect I'll make thee buskins fine
of satin, humbled by thy feet divine,
to prison them in soft embraces warm
and like a faithful mould to preserve their form.


then if my art is powerless to cut
thy pedestal, a silver moon, I'll put
beneath thy heel the serpent in my heart
for thee to bruise and mock, because thou art
even that monster spewing hate and gall.
thine altar, like the Virgin's, shall be twined
with flowers, and like tapers all aligned,
my thoughts shall light the niche: from those blue skies,
watching thee always with their fiery eyes;
and since thou holdest all the love within
my heart, as incense, myrrh and benjamin,
in clouds forevermore to thee, its goal, 
o snowy peak, shall rise my stormy soul.


and last, to make thee Mary utterly,
commingling love with savage cruelty,
— black joy! — with all the seven capital sins
I'll forge, remorsefully, seven javelins
knife-sharp, and like a juggler nonchalant, 
taking thy love as target, I shall plant
deep in thy heart convulsed each deadly dart
— thy panting heart, thy sobbing, streaming heart!




I woke up late today with no ideas
I gulp alcohol from morning till late
I fantasize about money and girls all day
I live in town, I was born in town
I need no job I depend on other people
I go to work I go to public bars after 
I haven’t prayed any god for six years

I live for parties I am a teenage girl
I sell my body but I am not a prostitute
I get so drunk and find my little happiness
I adore money from older men and suck it out
I only breathe to torment any successful story
I was raised in the township, I was raised in town
I have heard of this god but I do not care

I see no difference between me and this useless poem.


***The Book Of Youth


Plain be the phrase, yet apt the verse,
More ponderous than nimble;
For since grimed War here laid aside
His painted pomp, 'twould ill befit
Overmuch to ply
The rhyme's barbaric symbol.

Hail to victory without the gaud
Of glory; zeal that needs no fans
Of banners; plain mechanic power
Plied cogently in War now placed -
Where War belongs -
Among the trades and artisans.

Yet this was battle, and intense -
Beyond the strife of fleets heroic;
Deadlier, closer, calm 'mid storm;
No passion; all went on by crank.
Pivot, and screw,
And calculations of caloric.

Needless to dwell; the story's known.
The ringing of those plates on plates
Still ringeth round the world -
The clangor of the blacksmiths' fray.
The anvil-din
Resounds this message from the Fates:

War shall yet be, and to the end;
But war-paint shows the streaks of weather;
War yet shall be, but the warriors
Are now but operatives; War's made
Less grand than Peace,
And a singe runs through lace and feather. 

There is something in the autumn that is native to my blood—
Touch of manner, hint of mood;
And my heart is like a rhyme,
With the yellow and the purple and the crimson keeping time.

The scarlet of the maples can shake me like a cry
Of bugles going by.
And my lonely spirit thrills
To see the frosty asters like a smoke upon the hills.

There is something in October sets the gypsy blood astir;
We must rise and follow her,
When from every hill of flame
She calls and calls each vagabond by name. 

If we must part,
Then let it be like this.
Not heart on heart,
Nor with the useless anguish of a kiss;
But touch mine hand and say:
'Until to-morrow or some other day,
If we must part'.

Words are so weak
When love hath been so strong;
Let silence speak:
'Life is a little while, and love is long;
A time to sow and reap,
And after harvest a long time to sleep,
But words are weak.

'As virtuous men pass mildly away,
     And whisper to their souls, to go,
Whilst some of their sad friends do say,
     'The breath goes now,' and some say, 'No:'

So let us melt, and make no noise,
    No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;
'Twere profanation of our joys
    To tell the laity our love.

Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears;
    Men reckon what it did, and meant;
But trepidation of the spheres,
    Though greater far, is innocent.

Dull sublunary lovers' love
    (Whose soul is sense) cannot admit
Absence, because it doth remove
    Those things which elemented it.

But we by a love so much refin'd,
    That ourselves know not what it is,
Inter-assured of the mind,
    Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.

Our two souls therefore, which are one,
    Though I must go, endure not yet
A breach, but an expansion,
    Like gold to airy thinness beat.

If they be two, they are two so
    As stiff twin compasses are two;
Thy soul, the fix'd foot, makes no show
    To move, but doth, if the' other do.

And though it in the centre sit,
    Yet when the other far doth roam,
It leans, and hearkens after it,
    And grows erect, as that comes home.

Such wilt thou be to me, who must
    Like th' other foot, obliquely run;
Thy firmness makes my circle just,
    And makes me end, where I begun. 

Let me pour forth
     My tears before thy face, whilst I stay here,
     For thy face coins them, and thy stamp they bear,
     And by this mintage they are something worth,
         For thus they be
         Pregnant of thee;
     Fruits of much grief they are, emblems of more,
     When a tear falls, that thou falls which it bore,
     So thou and I are nothing then, when on a diverse shore.

       On a round ball
   A workman that hath copies by, can lay
   An Europe, Afric, and an Asia,
   And quickly make that, which was nothing, all;
       So doth each tear
       Which thee doth wear,
   A globe, yea world, by that impression grow,
   Till thy tears mix'd with mine do overflow
   This world; by waters sent from thee, my heaven dissolved so.

       O more than moon,
   Draw not up seas to drown me in thy sphere,
   Weep me not dead, in thine arms, but forbear
   To teach the sea what it may do too soon;
       Let not the wind
       Example find,
   To do me more harm than it purposeth;
   Since thou and I sigh one another's breath,
   Whoe'er sighs most is cruellest, and hastes the other's death. 

Let me pour forth 
My tears before thy face, whil'st I stay here, 
For thy face coins them, and thy stamp they bear, 
And by this Mintage they are something worth, 
For thus they be 
Pregnant of thee; 
Fruits of much grief they are, emblems of more, 
When a tear falls, that thou falls which it bore, 
So thou and I are nothing then, when on a divers shore. 
On a round ball 
A workman that hath copies by, can lay 
An Europe, Afrique, and an Asia, 
And quickly make that, which was nothing, All, 
So doth each tear, 
Which thee doth wear, 
A globe, yea world by that impression grow, 
Till thy tears mixt with mine do overflow 
This world, by waters sent from thee, my heaven dissolved so. 
O more than Moon, 
Draw not up seas to drown me in thy sphere, 
Weep me not dead, in thine arms, but forbear 
To teach the sea, what it may do too soon; 
Let not the wind 
Example find, 
To do me more harm, than it purposeth; 
Since thou and I sigh one another's breath, 
Who e'r sighs most, is cruellest, and hastes the other's death. 

For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,
    Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda,
  Shall find her own sweet name, that nestling lies
    Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.
  Search narrowly the lines! - they hold a treasure
    Divine- a talisman- an amulet
  That must be worn at heart. Search well the measure-
    The words- the syllables! Do not forget
  The trivialest point, or you may lose your labor
    And yet there is in this no Gordian knot
  Which one might not undo without a sabre,
    If one could merely comprehend the plot.
  Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering
    Eyes scintillating soul, there lie perdus
  Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing
    Of poets, by poets- as the name is a poet's, too,
  Its letters, although naturally lying
    Like the knight Pinto- Mendez Ferdinando-
  Still form a synonym for Truth- Cease trying! 
    You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you can do. 

Let others wonder what fair face
  Upon their path shall shine,
And, fancying half, half hoping, trace
  Some maiden shape of tenderest grace
      To be their Valentine.

Let other hearts with tremor sweet
  One secret wish enshrine
That Fate may lead their happy feet
  Fair Julia in the lane to meet
      To be their Valentine.

But I, far happier, am secure;
  I know the eyes benign,
The face more beautiful and pure
  Than fancy's fairest portraiture
      That mark my Valentine.

More than when first I singled, thee,
  This only prayer is mine,-
That, in the years I yet shall see.
  As, darling, in the past, thou'll be

YOUR cheeks are pinker than the rose,
Your eyes are bluer than the skies;
Than you no fairer blossom grows,
In you all earthly sweetness lies.
Without you life were drear to me,
I dream of you the night long through;
Oh, sweetheart! hear my humble plea:
Please let me hook your waists for you.

Your voice is sweet as song of birds,
Your eyes would shame the stars above;
There is no power in written words
To truly tell you how I love.
When I 'm with you I 'm trouble free,
But absent, desolate and blue,
Darling, I pray you'll hear my plea:
Please let me hook your waists for you. 

Sent to a friend who had complained that I was glad enough to see 
him when he came, but didn't seem to miss him if he stayed away.

And cannot pleasures, while they last,
Be actual unless, when past,
They leave us shuddering and aghast,
With anguish smarting?
And cannot friends be firm and fast,
And yet bear parting?

And must I then, at Friendship's call,
Calmly resign the little all
(Trifling, I grant, it is and small)
I have of gladness,
And lend my being to the thrall
Of gloom and sadness?

And think you that I should be dumb,
And full DOLORUM OMNIUM,
Excepting when YOU choose to come
And share my dinner?
At other times be sour and glum
And daily thinner?

Must he then only live to weep,
Who'd prove his friendship true and deep
By day a lonely shadow creep,
At night-time languish,
Oft raising in his broken sleep
The moan of anguish?

The lover, if for certain days
His fair one be denied his gaze,
Sinks not in grief and wild amaze,
But, wiser wooer,
He spends the time in writing lays,
And posts them to her.

And if the verse flow free and fast,
Till even the poet is aghast,
A touching Valentine at last
The post shall carry,
When thirteen days are gone and past
Of February.

Farewell, dear friend, and when we meet,
In desert waste or crowded street,
Perhaps before this week shall fleet,
Perhaps to-morrow.
I trust to find YOUR heart the seat
Of wasting sorrow. 

The hunter to the husbandman
Pays tribute since our love began,
And to love-loyalty dedicates
The phantom kills he meditates.
Let me embrace, embracing you,
Beauty of other shape and hue,
Odd glinting graces of which none
Shone more than candle to your sun;
Your well-kissed hand was beckoning me
In unfamiliar imagery.
Smile your forgiveness: each bright ghost
Dives in love's glory and is lost
Yielding your comprehensive pride
A homage, even to suicide. 

Go, Cupid, and my sweetheart tell
I love her well.
Yes, though she tramples on my heart
And rends that bleeding thing apart;
And though she rolls a scornful eye
On doting me when I go by;
And though she scouts at everything
As tribute unto her I bring -
Apple, banana, caramel -
Haste, Cupid, to my love and tell,
In spite of all, I love her well!

And further say I have a sled
Cushioned in blue and painted red!
The groceryman has promised I
Can "hitch" whenever he goes by -
Go, tell her that, and, furthermore,
Apprise my sweetheart that a score
Of other little girls implore
The boon of riding on that sled
Painted and hitched, as aforesaid; -
And tell her, Cupid, only she
Shall ride upon that sled with me!
Tell her this all, and further tell
I love her well. 

Forgive me if I ever hurt you, 
if you still see some colors in me.
Feel me my friend on a lovely day, 
if you still feel some odors in me.
If you see some dirt on my dry petals, 
use your coldness and wet your eyes, 
the air joining us is humid enough, 
a few dew drops from blue skies.
My nights are the nights of blue stars, 
my dawns are washed by drops of dew.
I am still twinkling in your shining eyes, 
friends like me are rare and few.
If you see my colors are faded away, 
I suppose your lips are still pink.
I'm sure I'm still sleeping in thoughts, 
and your poetic dreams can still ink.
Love, not something sold and purchased, 
not a pencil image that can be erased, 
it may be a mirage always chased, 
but a beauty for that life is praised

I never knew
I'd know such bliss
How could I know
I'd feel like this

I never knew 
You'd ever care
Until alone
While sitting there

. . 

And
.  .   

Through
.. 
  .  . 

Your

.  
  .. 

Eyes

.  . . 

I knew


MOTLEY I count the only wear
That suits, in this mixed world, the truly wise,
Who boldly smile upon despair
And shake their bells in Grandam Grundy's eyes.
Singers should sing with such a goodly cheer
That the bare listening should make strong like wine,
At this unruly time of year,
The Feast of Valentine.

We do not now parade our "oughts"
Their life lies all indoors; sad thoughts
Must keep the house, while gay thoughts go abroad,
Within we hold the wake for hopes deceased;
But in the public streets, in wind or sun,
Keep open, at the annual feast,
The puppet-booth of fun.

Our powers, perhaps, are small to please,
But even negro-songs and castanettes,
Old jokes and hackneyed repartees
Are more than the parade of vain regrets.
Let Jacques stand Wert(h)ering by the wounded deer -
We shall make merry, honest friends of mine,
At this unruly time of year,
The Feast of Valentine.

I know how, day by weary day,
Hope fades, love fades, a thousand pleasures fade.
I have not trudged in vain that way
On which life's daylight darkens, shade by shade.
And still, with hopes decreasing, griefs increased,
Still, with what wit I have shall I, for one,
Keep open, at the annual feast,
The puppet-booth of fun.

I care not if the wit be poor,
The old worn motley stained with rain and tears,
If but the courage still endure
That filled and strengthened hope in earlier years;
If still, with friends averted, fate severe,
A glad, untainted cheerfulness be mine
To greet the unruly time of year,
The Feast of Valentine.

Priest, I am none of thine, and see
In the perspective of still hopeful youth
That Truth shall triumph over thee -
Truth to one's self - I know no other truth.
I see strange days for thee and thine, O priest,
And how your doctrines, fallen one by one,
Shall furnish at the annual feast
The puppet-booth of fun.

Stand on your putrid ruins - stand,
White neck-clothed bigot, fixedly the same,
Cruel with all things but the hand,
Inquisitor in all things but the name.
We cherish freedom - back with thee and thine
From this unruly time of year,
The Feast of Valentine.

Blood thou mayest spare; but what of tears?
But what of riven households, broken faith -
Bywords that cling through all men's years
And drag them surely down to shame and death?
Stand back, O cruel man, O foe of youth,
And let such men as hearken not thy voice
Press freely up the road to truth,
The King's highway of choice. 

Accept, dear girl, this little token, 
And if between the lines you seek, 
You'll find the love I've often spoken—
The love my dying lips shall speak. 

Our little ones are making merry 
O'er am'rous ditties rhymed in jest, 
But in these words (though awkward—very) 
The genuine article's expressed.

You are as fair and sweet and tender, 
Dear brown-eyed little sweetheart mine, 
As when, a callow youth and slender, 
I asked to be your Valentine.

What though these years of ours be fleeting? 
What though the years of youth be flown? 
I'll mock old Tempus with repeating, 
'I love my love and her alone!' 

And when I fall before his reaping, 
And when my stuttering speech is dumb, 
Think not my love is dead or sleeping, 
But that it waits for you to come. 

So take, dear love, this little token, 
And if there speaks in any line 
The sentiment I'd fain have spoken, 
Say, will you kiss your Valentine

Wish the world could be beautiful
and humans could love as birds do
wish hearts could jump out of bodies
and roam out and come after dating buddies

Wish my spirit could fly to spirits
from gentle stream and fragrant medows
and hug them with tender tears
and touching eloquence.

Wish my world could be of innocent babes
born out of instant loves
just flirting around with fairy tales
and glimmering with glow worm-hearts

Wish man could love woman like the blue lagoon
with all innocence sprayed in the night's room
wish older we become, younger our hearts turn
and let millions of love spurt from purity's lawn.

Wish the hands of love and hearts of throbbing passion
does not fall into the dustbins of money vision
Wish every thought of nobility and beauty
cherish forever with love made of dove's kitty. 

If the story goes true
The great Saint was beheaded
than his life
Miracle he displayed
yet, blind was the emperor and all
So they Martyred him
Sainted him
If they have let the priest free
We would have now forgotten him
That the king beheaded 
Valentine, the Saint and Priest
became synonymous
Hence, on this day of Valentine
let us wish together
Let us never hurt
the hearts that uphold
god above them
hearts that triumph in displaying
to seed faith in the innocents
and suffering ignoramus
Let not the real good hearts
that guide love to bloom 
by marrying loving hearts
suffer, let also those who torture
and shame the yearning ones seeking to unite
be put to flames, to ashes, to ashes. 

Motion eludes my conscience
Sublime realities dawn
Dark  figures in the ocean
Signal a chaotic retreat motion
Breadcrumbs lead to nowhere
Maps look the same from all angles
Hell! This is a love triangle
Bare bodies of deceit
Surround a soul elite
Walking uphill fear is my only partner
Not of a failure below but 
The notion of success above

Freud’s  dream I do not care
For my dreams I no longer share
Yoke yellow sun smoothes my eyes
This dawn but will surely dusk
My night, my love  u will surely come

Rainbows on bubbles look real
But its life so surreal
The virgin silence succumbs
To the fumbling freshmen of  morning sounds
A dead radio humming , a  sleeping engine roars
The First birds have started the day
The perfect man has started to pray
For yet another meaningless day
Only to end it and say
Goodnight, to his women, who aside him lay
The seek of night so gray
While The seekers of day burns hay
In dreams of day they crave
One more night to sleep
One more day to hope
For  yet  another night’s sleep


When I was but a little lad of six and seven and eight,
One joy I knew that has been lost in customs up-to-date,
Then Saturday was baking day and Mother used to make,
The while I stood about and watched, the Sunday pies and cake;
And I was there to have fulfilled a small boy's fondest wish,
The glorious privilege of youth- to scrape the frosting dish!

On Saturdays I never left to wander far away- 
I hovered near the kitchen door on Mother's baking day;
The fragrant smell of cooking seemed to hold me in its grip,
And naught cared I for other sports while there were sweets to sip;
I little cared that all my chums had sought the brook to fish;
I chose to wait that moment glad when I could scrape the dish.

Full many a slice of apple I have lifted from a pie
Before the upper crust went on, escaping Mother's eye;
Full many a time my fingers small in artfulness have strayed
Into some sweet temptation rare which Mother's hands had made;
But eager-eyed and watery-mouthed, I craved the greater boon,
When Mother let me clean the dish and lick the frosting spoon.

The baking days of old are gone, our children cannot know
The glorious joys that childhood owned and loved so long ago.
New customs change the lives of all and in their heartless way
They've robbed us of the glad event once known as baking day.
The stores provide our every need, yet many a time I wish
Our kids could know that bygone thrill and scrape the frosting dish. 

I am tired of this!
Nothing else but loving!
Nothing else but kiss and kiss,
Coo, and turtle-doving!
Can't you change the order some?
Hate me just a little--come!

Lay aside your 'dears,'
'Darlings,' 'kings,' and 'princes!'--
Call me knave, and dry your tears--
Nothing in me winces,--
Call me something low and base--
Something that will suit the case!

Wish I had your eyes
And their drooping lashes!
I would dry their teary lies
Up with lightning-flashes--
Make your sobbing lips unsheathe
All the glitter of your teeth!

Can't you lift one word--
With some pang of laughter--
Louder than the drowsy bird
Crooning 'neath the rafter?
Just one bitter word, to shriek
Madly at me as I speak!

How I hate the fair
Beauty of your forehead!
How I hate your fragrant hair!
How I hate the torrid
Touches of your splendid lips,
And the kiss that drips and drips!

Ah, you pale at last!
And your face is lifted
Like a white sail to the blast,
And your hands are shifted
Into fists: and, towering thus,
You are simply glorious!

Now before me looms
Something more than human;
Something more than beauty blooms
In the wrath of Woman--
Something to bow down before
Reverently and adore. 

Lilies opened into the outer room.
They almost overshadowed the entire place.
It was there in bright recesses the talk
Began, the colors, the aromas filling what
They knew of life with urgent, direct
Fragrance, now where they recall each moment.

A conversation erupted between
A stray image of Monet and his sincere strokes, 
Dark talk and dark weathered ideas. In their
Makeshift vase, it is a question of intentions, 
Who to turn to when beauty's a problem.

Any two words can be an oxymoron. 
The corner, now inhabited by growth, 
Comes at them in a way that's inescapable; 
A duel to the (near)     death of screeds, like
The corner itself produces a miracle. 

Long long I lay in the sands

Sounds of trains in the surf
in subways of the sea
And an even greater undersound
of a vast confusion in the universe
a rumbling and a roaring
as of some enormous creature turning
under sea and earth
a billion sotto voices murmuring
a vast muttering
a swelling stuttering
in ocean's speakers
world's voice-box heard with ear to sand
a shocked echoing
a shocking shouting
of all life's voices lost in night
And the tape of it
someow running backwards now
through the Moog Synthesizer of time
Chaos unscrambled
back to the first
harmonies
And the first light


When  I find  friends like you
who is so far away 
who never saw me, 
who did not know 
whether I am real or virtual, 
I question myself 
whether this is a reality 
or part of dream.' 

'Look at me from a distance 
feel me as a music 
Let me flow through your pen 
and pain as moon beam 
And remember me 
as a part of your poetry 
A part of your dream 
and distant from reality.

'A man comes
A mission starts, 
A man goes
A mission ends, 
The outputs do affect
In life and after death.

I don't know the meaning of Art;
But I learned in my little school primer
To love Eugene Field and Bret Harte.
I hailed Hoosier Ryley with pleasure,
To John Hay I took off my hat;
These fellows were right to my measure,
And I've never gone higher than that.

The Classics! Well, most of them bore me,
The Moderns I don't understand;
But I keep Burns, my kinsman before me,
And Kipling, my friend, is at hand.
They taught me my trade as I know it,
Yet though at their feet I have sat,
For I've never been guilty of that.

A rhyme-rustler, rugged and shameless,
A Bab Balladeer on the loose;
Of saccarine sonnets I'm blameless,
My  model has been - Mother Goose.
And I fancy my grave-digger griping
As he gives my last lodging a pat:
"This guy wrote Mc


Grew;
'Twas the best he could do" . . .
So I'll go to my maker with that. 

A very windy Wednesday afternoon.
All dressed up with a
bitter twist of irony.
A very enchanting romantic
dream lights up
the day.
Day into night, 
not a sight unseen.
Unseen the wisdom rolls
from east to west.
West, a Burmese cat meows 
for its supper.
A very crazy notion
roars by this ocean.
Pt.Later


Spinning a weave upon this thread.
Ha a life all washed up.
Excuse me good sir a table two.
Yes that does mean me and you.
Unless this is that other special occasion where I finally get meet the cook.
Ah ha that is exactly as I thought.
Come here I could kiss you you fool.
Such a dress, such a get up.
A noise maker saying hello, all eyes on me.
Gums flapping in the breeze
Some more hash browns please and whatever you do, do not hold back the cheese.
For if it wants to fight it has every right.
Especially with this kind appetite.
Indeed the pleasure is all mine.
A discussion with an awful oder of turpentine.
Some say breath through your mouth, other a say the nose.
I personally prefer the ears.
For the whistling sound right after just makes me ecstatic.
Ah what are we here for anyways? 
Yes let's get the heart of the matter.
And if we are splitting and frying hearts.
Remember I want onions on mine.
It provides this crunchy taste that erases the thought what I am actually eating.
And just where are you going? 
I just got started.
You can't leave just yet.
Did you know I won bucks in an earlier bet.
Of course not after all you weren't with me in till very recently.
You think you were insulted, imagine how I felt when I realized I kissed a guy for the first time.
But yes go on ahead I'll have a car waiting.
One of us must get out of this alive without wearing a disguise.
And upon this know my dearly departed know where ever you can't escape alter ego.
He emphatically loves you so. 

Once, when I was young and true,
  Someone left me sad-
Broke my brittle heart in two;
  And that is very bad.

Love is for unlucky folk,
  Love is but a curse.
Once there was a heart I broke;
  And that, I think, is worse. 

So, your mind drifts
to the nearest bar while I try and communicate with you? 

Your stomach turns, as I attempt to speak of the day to day, inane requirements of running a household? 

The effort, of being some small person's perfect parent and, somewhere in the midst of it, your preferrable partner.

The endless attending to the task of being somebody's manager, 
mother, 
cleaner, 
personal shopper, 
bill payer, 
counsellor, 
nose wiper, 
gardener, 
petrol pump attendant, 
party organiser, 
laundry maid, 
personal assistant, 
dietician and
  .
I used to be so much more.

My mind drifts too, 
to the time when I was easy on the eye, and easy on your mind.

When we connected, somewhere in the middle; 

to the time when I walked easy, with a gentle rolling of that sense of sexuality that comes with being young.

When I had ten minutes in the day, to savour being me.
Me? 

I'm not sure who that was. She was here once.
Nice enough woman wasn't she? 

Used to laugh a lot, real laid back kinda gal? 
I can't put an exact date on when she disappeared.

I think it was at the point she felt she was abandoned.
She lives her life vicariously now, through the
 manager, 
mother, 
cleaner, 
personal shopper, 
bill payer, 
counsellor, 
nose wiper, 
gardener, 
petrol pump attendant, 
party organiser, 
laundry maid, 
personal assistant, 
dietician
that now reside at her previous address.

She used to be so much more.  .
or so I'm told. 

Taking life and feeding death
a broken path, a fork in the road.
Screaming, beating, defeating, 
not making any sense but still vital to life and death.
Whispering cruel thoughts, stealing breath
voicing once hidden intentions.
Taking life and feeding death.

Gentle heat, steadfast heart
killing death to take a chance on life every fourth.
Fighting, winning and losing, 
not making any sense but still vital to life and death.
Encouraging and coaxing, giving life
pushing back the darkness until its turn to submit.
Taking death and making life.

Whipped around, a vicious cycle
full of life and death, each vital to survival.
Giving up, making a new start, taking a chance on something new 
Still making no sense at all, but perhaps it's not ment to.
Degrading, crushing, Encouraging, freeing
Compromise, age, learning to wait.
Life and death, each vital to survival. 

I stumble forward in a daze
with shackles on my wrists and feet.
The room is cold and very bright
As I approach my final sleep.
I see the gurney waiting there
It bears the aspect of a cross
For me to stretch my arms out wide
Embracing what my sins have cost.
Behind the one way mirrors stand
the next of kin to all my crimes.
They wait there to see justice done.
They count down to the end of time.
I feel the needles subtle pinch
as liquid poison finds a vein.
As Icy coldness creeps towards my heart
the savior to my darkness came


At twenty five  she was the town beauty though that seems a while ago
And fifteen years  later it does seem time is becoming her foe
With a son of five and a daughter of three
She is  not the beauty that she used to be
No longer the  number one beauty of the town
To cover the gray in her raven dark hair she has dyed it brown
She has put on weight some ten kilos or more
Among the town beauties no longer to the fore
Most people look fit and well in their life's  prime
But eventually we all become victims of time
For a while she  was the  young woman the local young men wished to know
But already the years on her beginning to show
And worse for her the unfaithful man she  is married to having his bit on the side
And that feels  quite shattering to her sense of pride. 

His redneck workmates tease him at least that's what he said
They say such rude things to him like we've taken your girl to bed
They've doused his sandwiches in petrol and put salt in his flask of tea
And they've made life in the workplace for him a misery.

He is new to the workforce and to the workplace life still green
And he's just out of high school and he's only turned eighteen
About his older workmates he's too scared to complain
He'd rather keep his mouth shut and suffer the mental pain.

They taunt and persecute him his workmates a thuggish mob
And he won't complain them to his boss for fear he might lose his job
How many more are like him and suffer as he do? 
For the victims of workplace bullying are no longer in the few.

He suffer on in silence and his problems only grow
And he is young and naive and his rights he does not know
His working life off to a bad start he's in at the deep end
And in the place he works at he doesn't have a friend. 

I don’t blame even my fate, 
If anything is to be blamed, 
I blame my uncalled hate.

It’s a victory day, what a painful day! 
We are gathered here to celebrate, 
The day followed by a red hot war, 
We regret in aftermaths, but too late.

Alas! We could avoid this war! 
No smile on the lips but eyes is filled! 
Alas! We could not get rid of the hatred! 
The dream of victory has been fulfilled, 

I am a poor man, disabled in the war, 
I came here like a limping insect, 
You have some money and purchased a crutch, 
Here comes the leader, the hero perfect! 

He is a rich man on a nice wheelchair, 
His eyes are red, did not sleep last night.
His face is pale and at all not fair, 
Still promising our future is bright.

Crops still in the womb but infected
Air and water both are polluted, 
Lost the war even after winning! 
But the old hatred not yet diluted.

Oh greenery! Could you come back! 
The acidic rains radio active in nature, 
Look like tears of Adam and Eve, 
How they regret their sons’ caricature! 

The leaders’ congrats could not understand, 
I could not see the beloved anywhere, 
The maid of victory you are dead or alive? 
She is in a coma, perhaps somewhere

If you judge him do not judge him harshly or why judge him at all
Since the darkest of memories are his to recall
Many of his comrades around him under gunfire did fall
Their names to be seen on War Memorial wall.

Back in the late sixties in distant Vietnam
He fought in an unpopular war as a young man
He received an honourable discharge from the army and a medal for bravery
And he now is an ageing man in poverty.

He never fathered children or never had a wife
And alcohol has become his sole comfort in life
Haunted by his dark war memories life for him an Earthly Hell
Had he not been in Vietnam at all in life he may have done well.

His war medal for bravery he has misplaced or lost
The two years he spent in Vietnam to him has come at a great cost
He looks far older than his sixty three years thin and stooped and gray
War leaves it's mark on it's survivors it does seem that way. 

The narrow path towards Mt Toolbrunup
inclines through fragrant green enclosing wood.
He forged ahead, I kept up best I could.
A tumbled boulder slope leads ever up.

A wall of shale and quartzite borders right
and white mist tendrils slipped across its face.
I turned for one last gaze, as cool embrace
of cloud bathed all things near in pallid light.

The peak was wrapped in solitary peace.
We sat on massive thicket creviced slabs, 
all patched with hard white crinkled lichen scabs, 
in arbitrary mountain clime's caprice.

I lingered when he left for just a while, 
a space to sample isolation's charms.
Then down the slick wet rocks ungainly style, 
discreet descent on rear end, heels and palms.

We missed the view and so we have avowed
to reach that veiled unbounded space again
and maybe if we're fortunate, well then-
once more, we'll sit within a mountain's cloud. 

Hope is not like a caged canary
dreaming of clouds or a starved one
feeding on winds. 

it is never winter
in the land of hope, generated
by will and dream where alone
grows the flower of consolation.
it's man's only friend that even survives
his death as goes certain belief. 

were it
not for hope, the heart would break, so
hard is the ordeal of life but to hope
is to know how to wait. 

Eyes dim and mouths yawn
when darkness starts to coagulate. 

time wills us
to cast aside caste, colour, custom, rank and religion
to fraternise ourselves as souls
in the prime community of dreams
smacking intuitively
our tongues with sleep's juice, 
turning on our sides on and off
till dream relaxes its grip
and there's sleep's thaw. 

We lie in bed under the same sheets, 
At the present time in complete peace, 
Now hidden behind two different faces, 
Dreams in a world of separate places. 

We each owe love but we cannot buy, 
Only through the sensual nature of my, 
Kiss while at times we feel barely alive, 
For deep in a dream you barely survive. 

Realize this realm we are heavy with, 
A rebirth so reality is no longer a myth, 
Trying to save what exists from life itself, 
Poor man’s trash, another man’s wealth. 

Richness abounds this covenant grace, 
And it should reflect not just in one face, 
As we only move forward together when, 
An unselfish duet of our sacrifice begins. 

There’s no peace when a lion and a lamb, 
Seek the same jungle where only one can, 
Rein supreme for there is no equal share, 
Both must agree one is one within a pair. 

The sun and the moon cannot occupy, 
At the same time the center of the sky, 
And so for us just another reason why, 
The truth will never coexist with a lie.

Old diehard saying, birds flock together, 
Yet they have to be of the same feather, 
As we shall only proceed forward in unity, 
But together, not with you ruling over me.

Rain pours, thunder flashes, lightning strikes, 
And there is no time frame either day or night, 
So, while in these uncertain destructive times, 
I leave to seek the stability of heart and mind.

In Infinite wisdom the Almighty did not create, 
An infusion to co-exist between love and hate, 
By this reason alone I pray and will always do, 
Not just in the best for me but likewise for you.

No gazing in the clouds awaiting the clear, 
She will not be his sheep in line for a shear, 
He shares one view that only pride can see, 
True reason there’s no longer A View Of We.

O singer of Persephone!
In the dim meadows desolate
Dost thou remember Sicily?

Still through the ivy flits the bee
Where Amaryllis lies in state;
O Singer of Persephone!

Simaetha calls on Hecate
And hears the wild dogs at the gate;
Dost thou remember Sicily?

Still by the light and laughing sea
Poor Polypheme bemoans his fate;
O Singer of Persephone!

And still in boyish rivalry
Young Daphnis challenges his mate;
Dost thou remember Sicily?

Slim Lacon keeps a goat for thee,
For thee the jocund shepherds wait;
O Singer of Persephone!
Dost thou remember Sicily

SCENE: 'En ce bourdel ou tenons nostre estat.'

It being remembered that there were six of us with Master Villon, when
that expecting presently lo be hanged he writ a ballad whereof ye know:

‘Freres humains qui apres nous vivez.'

Drink ye a skoal for the gallows tree!
Francois and Margot and thee and me,
Drink we the comrades merrily
That said us, 'Till then' for the gallows tree!

Fat Pierre with the hook gauche-main,
Thomas Larron 'Ear-the-less',
Tybalde and that armouress
Who gave this poignard its premier stain
Pinning the Guise that had been fain
To make him a mate of the 'Haulte Noblesse'
And bade her be out with ill address
As a fool that mocketh his drue's disdeign.

Drink we a skoal for the gallows tree!
Francois and Margot and thee and me,
Drink we to Marienne Ydole,
That hell brenn not her o'er cruelly.

Drink we the lusty robbers twain,
Black is the pitch o' their wedding dress,
Lips shrunk back for the wind's caress
As lips shrink back when we feel the strain

Of love that loveth in hell's disdeign,
And sense the teeth through the lips that press
'Gainst our lips for the soul's distress
That striveth to ours across the pain.

Drink we skoal to the gallows tree!
Francois and Margot and thee and me,
For Jehan and Raoul de Vallerie
Whose frames have the night and its winds in fee.

Maturin, Guillaume, Jacques d'Allmain,
Culdou lacking a coat to bless
One lean moiety of his nakedness
That plundered St. Hubert back o' the fane:
Aie! the lean bare tree is widowed again
For Michault le Borgne that would confess
In 'faith and troth' to a traitoress,
'Which of his brothers had he slain?'

But drink we skoal to the gallows tree!
Francois and Margot and thee and me:

And smite always at their faibleness?

Skoal!! to the gallows! and then pray we:
And bring their souls to his 'Haulte Citee'. 

If heaven loved not the wine,
A Wine Star would not be in heaven;
If earth loved not the wine,
The Wine Spring would not be on the earth.
Since heaven and earth love the wine,
Need a tippling mortal be ashamed?
The transparent wine, I hear,
Has the soothing virtue of a sage,
While the turgid is rich, they say,
As the fertile mind of the wise.
Both the sage and the wise were drinkers,
Why seek for peers among gods and goblins?
Three cups open the grand door to bliss;
Take a jugful, the universe is yours.
Such is the rapture of the wine,
That the sober shall never inherit. 

Shadow is his name, 
my dash is my god, 
he is my mother
you know the beauty of a pet and your wife
only when they die, never know vision, but for loss of sight.

Pet dogs are divine beings, 
mating urges they do have
we in houses make them live a saintly life
curse is certainly upon us, but beyond curses let us browse

DAsh dogs are exceptionally loving, they are very very refunding, 
for every act of yours in love, in good will, in easing pain, 
dash shall dash to kiss you, hug you, jump into your lap and rejoice
with you, it is simple, loving, its timing, show of joy and love precious

when all has deserted, dogs never, faithful are dash dogs, too much
so he bit the snake that rattled its tail, little but venomous bitch
artistic carvings, but poisonous fangs, which is more dearer, snake or dog

my love for my pet makes my life of the pet urging more ferent and I pray
poor rattle mother, it's kid, but two things I dont cry on death, snake and
mosquitoes, I by birth, congenitally wanted to kill and kill till assured
the snake, the mosquitoes and yes, the cockroaches, i hate them, anteenae men

yester night, a viper kid, it bit my dash, my dearest mum, it spit and stooled
VEt said death is arriving, my heart sinking, our lives it saved, poor thing
still it urinates a pool of blood, a vision I saw in Marie Shine's picture
it urinates pools of blood, oh god, the poor lovely darling thing, rationed
food was rationed for becoming fatty, now we say eat shadow eat, come on, baby
and it refuses to open its mouth, fish it used to eat a packet, now it hates
the very smell and we go after it saying shadow, oh shadow, come on baby, dear.

Oh for the very first time, i am seeing a pet dog with a viper bite, 
blood pools of urine, red upon red, condensed, black blood in urine sight
oh, a small viper, but it took me to hell's horizons, life was heavenly
with my dash, it cleverly, made me feel divinely, so close, so intimate it evenly
loved all without any envy among us, now we are waiting, for life to be stolen
from heaven's heart or some mother's womb, Oh Shadow Dear, mother, come back, un-snaked. 

Love of mine, 
Run you slow.
Need I time
My self to know. 

No, no! Go from me. I have left her lately.
I will not spoil my sheath with lesser brightness,
For my surrounding air hath a new lightness;
Slight are her arms, yet they have bound me straitly
And left me cloaked as with a gauze of aether;
As with sweet leaves; as with subtle clearness.
Oh, I have picked up magic in her nearness
To sheathe me half in half the things that sheathe her.
No, no! Go from me. I have still the flavour,
Soft as spring wind that's come from birchen bowers.
Green come the shoots, aye April in the branches,
As winter's wound with her sleight hand she staunches,
Hath of the trees a likeness of the savour:
As white their bark, so white this lady's hours. 

Two crowned Kings, and One that stood alone
With no green weight of laurels round his head,
But with sad eyes as one uncomforted,
And wearied with man's never-ceasing moan
For sins no bleating victim can atone,
And sweet long lips with tears and kisses fed.
Girt was he in a garment black and red,
And at his feet I marked a broken stone
Which sent up lilies, dove-like, to his knees.
Now at their sight, my heart being lit with flame,
I cried to Beatrice, 'Who are these? '
And she made answer, knowing well each name,
'AEschylos first, the second Sophokles,
And last (wide stream of tears!)  Euripides.

'I lost the love of heaven above,
I spurned the lust of earth below,
I felt the sweets of fancied love
And hell itself my only foe.

I lost earth's joys but felt the glow
Of heaven's flame abound in me
Till loveliness and I did grow
The bard of immortality.

I loved but woman fell away
I hid me from her faded fame,
I snatched the sun's eternal ray
And wrote till earth was but a name

In every language upon earth,
On every shore, o'er every sea,
I give my name immortal birth
And kept my spirit with the free. 

AS I stood by yon roofless tower,
Where the wa'flower scents the dewy air,
Where the howlet mourns in her ivy bower,
And tells the midnight moon her care.


The winds were laid, the air was still,
The stars they shot alang the sky;
The fox was howling on the hill,
And the distant echoing glens reply.


The stream, adown its hazelly path,
Was rushing by the ruin'd wa's,
Hasting to join the sweeping Nith,
Whase distant roaring swells and fa's.


The cauld blae North was streaming forth
Her lights, wi' hissing, eerie din;
Athwart the lift they start and shift,
Like Fortune's favors, tint as win.


By heedless chance I turn'd mine eyes,
And, by the moonbeam, shook to see
A stern and stalwart ghaist arise,
Attir'd as Minstrels wont to be.


Had I a statue been o' stane,
His daring look had daunted me;
And on his bonnet grav'd was plain,
The sacred posy—"LIBERTIE!"


And frae his harp sic strains did flow,
Might rous'd the slumb'ring Dead to hear;
But oh, it was a tale of woe,
As ever met a Briton's ear!


He sang wi' joy his former day,
He, weeping, wailed his latter times;
But what he said—it was nae play,
I winna venture't in my rhymes. 

A vision of angels surrounds us all.
Into another world.
This world of peace we have found.
Riding into this night, 
A light. The sky brings us there.
That gate, it is there.
As we enter, 
There are visions of angels, love, celestial beings leading guarding this place..
Now back to reality, , 
A vision of unrest.  

When night had come
And the day had fled
When the door was shut
And I crawled to bed, 

You broke upon my thought
As a euphonic melody
You knocked upon my heart 
As a sweet memory

Your voice trailed across to me
Waking me from semi sleep
Driving my languor away
Filling me with sensations deep

I felt the warmth of your tumultous passion
The soft touch of your caressing hands
The musky odour of your fragrant breath
The gentleness of your adoring glance

You opened the window to let in the light
Not leaving me grope in blinding night
You took me to the seas of shore less delight
And hovered over me like a heavenly sprite

You enlivened every atom of my being
Kindled in me the fire of desire
Swept me off my feet by the inundating tide of love
My sleeping passions, you set to fire 

But Alas! With my senses lulled to sleep
Leading me into a state of heavenly calm
Through the window lying ajar
You faded out like an evanescent dream

Deep St. Mary's bell had sounded, 
And the twelve notes gently rounded 
Endless chimneys that surrounded 
My abode in Trinity. 
(Letter G, Old Court, South Attics), 
I shut up my mathematics, 
That confounded hydrostatics -- 
Sink it in the deepest sea!

In the grate the flickering embers 
Served to show how dull November’s 
Fogs had stamped my torpid members, 
Like a plucked and skinny goose. 
And as I prepared for bed, I 
Asked myself with voice unsteady, 
If of all the stuff I read, I 
Ever made the slightest use. 

Late to bed and early rising, 
Ever luxury despising, 
Ever training, never "sizing," 
I have suffered with the rest. 
Yellow cheek and forehead ruddy, 
Memory confused and muddy, 
These are the effects of study 
Of a subject so unblest.

Look beyond, and see the wrangler, 
Now become a College dangler, 
Court some spiritual angler, 
Nibbling at his golden bait. 
Hear him silence restive Reason, 
Her advice is out of season, 
While her lord is plotting treason 
Gainst himself, and Church or State.

See him next with place and pension, 
And the very best intention 
Of upholding that Convention 
Under which his fortunes rose. 
Every scruple is rejected, 
With his cherished schemes connected, 
"Higher Powers may be neglected -- 
His result no further goes


Much he lauds the education 
Which has raised to lofty station, 
Men, whose powers of calculation 
Calculation’s self defied. 
How the learned fool would wonder 
Were he now to see his blunder, 
When he put his reason under 
The control of worldly Pride.

Thus I muttered, very seedy, 
Husky was my throat, and reedy; 
And no wonder, for indeed I 
Now had caught a dreadful cold. 
Thickest fog had settled slowly 
Round the candle, burning lowly, 
Round the fire, where melancholy 
Traced retreating hills of gold.

Still those papers lay before me -- 
Problems made express to bore me, 
When a silent change came o’er me, 
In my hard uneasy chair. 
Fire and fog, and candle faded, 
Spectral forms the room invaded, 
Little creatures, that paraded 
On the problems lying there.

Fathers there, of every college, 
Led the glorious ranks of knowledge, 
Men, whose virtues all acknowledge 
Levied the proctorial fines; 
There the modest Moderators, 
Set apart as arbitrators 
’Twixt contending calculators, 
Scrutinised the trembling lines.

All the costly apparatus, 
That is meant to elevate us 
To the intellectual status 
Necessary for degrees -- 
College tutors -- private coaches -- 
Line the Senate-house approaches. 
If our Alma Mater dote, she’s 
Taken care of well by these.

Much I doubted if the vision 
Were the simple repetition 
Of the statements of Commission, 
Strangely jumbled, oddly placed. 
When an awful form ascended, 
And with cruel words defended 
Those abuses that offended 
My unsanctioned private taste. 

Angular in form and feature, 
Unlike any earthly creature, 
She had properties to meet your 
Eye whatever you might view. 
Hair of pens and skin of paper; 
Breath, not breath but chemic vapour; 
Dress, -- such dress as College Draper 
Fashions with precision due.

Eyes of glass, with optic axes 
Twisting rays of light as flax is 
Twisted, while the Parallax is 
Made to show the real size. 
Primary and secondary 
Focal lines in planes contrary, 
Sum up all that's known to vary 
In those dull, unmeaning eyes.

Such the eyes, through which all Nature 
Seems reduced to meaner stature. 
If you had them you would hate your 
Symbolising sense of sight. 
Seeing planets in their courses 
Thick beset with arrowy "forces," 
While the common eye no more sees 
Than their mild and quiet light.

"Son," she said (what could be queerer 
Than thus tête-à-tête to hear her 
Talk, in tones approaching nearer 
To a saw's than aught beside? 
For the voice the spectre spoke in 
Might be known by many a token 
To proceed from metal, broken 
When acoustic tricks were tried.

Little pleased to hear the Siren 
"Own" me thus with voice of iron, 
I had thoughts of just retiring 
From a mother such a fright). 
"No," she said, "the time is pressing, 
So before I give my blessing, 
I’ll excuse you from confessing 
What you thought of me to-night.

"Powers!" she cried, with hoarse devotion, 
"Give my son the clearest notion 
How to compass sure promotion, 
And take care of Number One. 
Let his college course be pleasant, 
Let him ever, as at present, 
Seem to have read what he hasn't, 
And to do what can’t be done.

Of the Philosophic Spirit 
Richly may my son inherit; 
As for Poetry, inter it 
With the myths of other days. 
Cut the thing entirely, lest yon 
College Don should put the question, 
Why not stick to what you're best on? 
Mathematics always pays


As the Hag was thus proceeding 
To prescribe my course of reading, 
And as I was faintly pleading, 
Hardly knowing what to say, 
Suddenly, my head inclining 
I beheld a light form shining; 
And the withered beldam, whining, 
Saw the same and slunk away.

Then the vision, growing brighter, 
Seemed to make my garret lighter; 
As when noisome fogs of night are 
Scattered by the rising sun. 
Nearer still it grew and nearer, 
Till my straining eyes caught clearer 
Glimpses of a being dearer, 
Dearer still than Number One. 

In that well-remembered Vision 
I was led to the decision 
Still to hold in calm derision 
Pedantry, however draped; 
Since that artificial spectre 
Proved a paltry sub-collector, 
And had nothing to connect her 
With the being whom she aped.

I could never finish telling 
You of her that has her dwelling 
Where those springs of truth are welling, 
Whence all streams of beauty run. 
She has taught me that creation 
Bears the test of calculation, 
But that Man forgets his station 
If he stops when that is done.

Is our algebra the measure 
Of that unexhausted treasure 
That affords the purest pleasure, 
Ever found when it is sought? 
Let us rather, realising 
The conclusions thence arising 
Nature more than symbols prizing, 
Learn to worship as we ought.

Worship? Yes, what worship better 
Than when free'd from every fetter 
That the uninforming letter 
Rivets on the tortured mind, 
Man, with silent admiration 
Sees the glories of Creation, 
And, in holy contemplation, 
Leaves the learned crowd behind




conceivable. 

If all the world only knew
 The greatest thing ever known,
 Its loveliness is nicely shown,
 Love has loveliness of its own.
 If one could only see the unseen
 Diamond that had never been
 Sighted, even with sight so keen,
 The unseen is often forsaken.
 If the heart is made for loving
 Without the contrast of hating,
 The world would rejoice with cheering,
 Happiness is the aim of living.
 If one only knew that someone
 Has a loving and caring heart,
 A heart that suits the heart of one,
 Always true, warm, will not depart. 

I saw a famous fountain, in my dream,
Where shady path-ways to a valley led;
A weeping willow lay upon that stream,
And all around the fountain brink were spread
Wide branching trees, with dark green leaf rich clad,
Forming a doubtful twilight-desolate and sad.


The place was such, that whoso enter'd in,
Disrobed was of every earthly thought,
And straight became as one that knew not sin,
Or to the world's first innocence was brought;
Enseem'd it now, he stood on holy ground,
In sweet and tender melancholy wrapt around.


A most strange calm stole o'er my soothed sprite;
Long time I stood, and longer had I staid,
When, lo! I saw, saw by the sweet moon-light,
Which came in silence o'er that silent shade,
Where, near the fountain, something like despair 
Made, of that weeping willow, garlands for her hair.


And eke with painful fingers she inwove
Many an uncouth stem of savage thorn-
'The willow garland, that was for her love,
And these her bleeding temples would adorn.'
With sighs her heart nigh burst, salt tears fast fell,
As mournfully she bended o'er that sacred well.


To whom when I addrest myself to speak,
She lifted up her eyes, and nothing said;
The delicate red came mantling o'er her cheek,
And, gath'ring up her loose attire, she fled
To the dark covert of that woody shade,
And in her goings seem'd a timid gentle maid.


Revolving in my mind what this should mean,
And why that lovely lady plained so;
Perplex'd in thought at that mysterious scene,
And doubting if 'twere best to stay or go,
I cast mine eyes in wistful gaze around,
When from the shades came slow a small and plaintive sound.


'Psyche am I, who love to dwell
In these brown shades, this woody dell,
Where never busy mortal came,
Till now, to pry upon my shame.


At thy feet what thou dost see
The waters of repentance be,
Which, night and day, I must augment
With tears, like a true penitent,


If haply so my day of grace
Be not yet past; and this lone place,
O'er-shadowy, dark, excludeth hence
All thoughts but grief and penitence.'


'Why dost thou weep, thou gentle maid!
And wherefore in this barren shade
Thy hidden thoughts with sorrow feed?
Can thing so fair repentance need?'


'O! I have done a deed of shame,
And tainted is my virgin fame,
And stain'd the beauteous maiden white,
In which my bridal robes were dight.'


'And who the promised spouse, declare:
And what those bridal garments were.'


'Severe and saintly righteousness
Compos'd the clear white bridal dress;
Bought with his blood the marriage ring.
A wretched sinful creature, I
Deem'd lightly of that sacred tie,
Gave to a treacherous world my heart,
And play'd the foolish wanton's part.


Soon to these murky shades I came,
To hide from the sun's light my shame.
And still I haunt this woody dell,
And bathe me in that healing well,
Whose waters clear have influence
From sin's foul stains the soul to cleanse;
And, night and day, I them augment,
With tears, like a true penitent,
Until, due expiation made,
And fit atonement fully paid,
The lord and bridegroom me present,
Where in sweet strains of high consent,
Shall chaunt the extatic marriage hymn.'


And thenceforth all my dream was fled. 

By a void and soundless river
On the outer edge of space,
Where the body comes not ever,
But the absent dream hath place,
Stands a city, tall and quiet,
And its air is sweet and dim;
Never sound of grief or riot
Makes it mad, or makes it grim.

And the tender skies thereover
Neither sun, nor star, behold--
Only dusk it hath for cover,--
But a glamour soft with gold,
Through a mist of dreamier essence
Than the dew of twilight, smiles
On strange shafts and domes and crescents,
Lifting into eerie piles.

In its courts and hallowed places
Dreams of distant worlds arise,
Shadows of transfigured faces,
Glimpses of immortal eyes,
Echoes of serenest pleasure,
Notes of perfect speech that fall,
Through an air of endless leisure,
Marvellously musical.

And I wander there at even,
Sometimes when my heart is clear,
When a wider round of heaven
And a vaster world are near,
When from many a shadow steeple
Sounds of dreamy bells begin,
And I love the gentle people
That my spirit finds therein.

Men of a diviner making
Than the sons of pride and strife,
Quick with love and pity, breaking
From a knowledge old as life;
Women of a spiritual rareness,
Whom old passion and old woe
Moulded to a slenderer fairness
Than the dearest shapes we know.

In its domed and towered centre
Lies a garden wide and fair,
Open for the soul to enter,
And the watchful townsmen there
Greet the stranger gloomed and fretting
From this world of stormy hands,
With a look that deals forgetting
And a touch that understands.

For they see with power, not borrowed
From a record taught or told,
But they loved and laughed and sorrowed
In a thousand worlds of old;
Now they rest and dream for ever,
And with hearts serene and whole
See the struggle, the old fever,
Clear as on a painted scroll.

Wandering by that grey and solemn
Water, with its ghostly quays--
Vistas of vast arch and column,
Shadowed by unearthly trees--
Biddings of sweet power compel me,
And I go with bated breath,
Listening to the tales they tell me,
Parables of Life and Death.

In a tongue that once was spoken,
Ere the world was cooled by Time,
When the spirit flowed unbroken
Through the flesh, and the Sublime
Made the eyes of men far-seeing,
And their souls as pure as rain,
They declare the ends of being,
And the sacred need of pain.

For they know the sweetest reasons
For the products most malign--
They can tell the paths and seasons
Of the farthest suns that shine.
How the moth-wing's iridescence
By an inward plan was wrought,
And they read me curious lessons
In the secret ways of thought.

When day turns, and over heaven
To the balmy western verge
Sail the victor fleets of even,
And the pilot stars emerge,
Then my city rounds and rises,
Like a vapour formed afar,
And its sudden girth surprises,
And its shadowy gates unbar.

Dreamy crowds are moving yonder
In a faint and phantom blue;
Through the dusk I lean, and wonder
If their winsome shapes are true;
But in veiling indecision
Come my questions back again--
Which is real? The fleeting vision?
Or the fleeting world of men

In consideration to human destiny
The vision of better life is in every one of us
It is our dream to be in that fate brightly
But future we don't hold, yet fate is on us

Although future we can't hold and see
that we can be in that bright life destiny
Individually, to that vision only you can perceive

Singly, you had given life for you are strong to live it
To your future, even Google, Yahoo, Bing has no answer
And that's how we are in this world to live by it
To be in a better life - it is in your will power




Methought I saw the grave where Laura lay,
Within that temple where the vestal flame
Was wont to burn; and, passing by that way,
To see that buried dust of living fame,
Whose tomb fair Love and fairer Virtue kept,
At whose approach the soul of Petrarch wept ;
And from thenceforth those graces were not seen,
Oblivion laid him down on Laura's hearse.
Hereat the hardest stones were seen to bleed,
And groans of buried ghosts the heavens did pierce :
Where Homer's spright did tremble all for grief,
And cursed the access of that celestial thief. 

Gone are the days
when you could walk on water.
When you could walk.

The days are gone.
Only one day remains,
the one you're in.

The memory is no friend.
It can only tell you
what you no longer have:

a left hand you can use,
two feet that walk.
All the brain's gadgets.

Hello, hello.
The one hand that still works
grips, won't let go.

That is not a train.
There is no cricket.
Let's not panic.

Let's talk about axes,
which kinds are good,
the many names of wood.

This is how to build
a house, a boat, a tent.
No use; the toolbox

refuses to reveal its verbs;
the rasp, the plane, the awl,
revert to sullen metal.

Do you recognize anything? I said.
Anything familiar?
Yes, you said. The bed.

Better to watch the stream
that flows across the floor
and is made of sunlight,

the forest made of shadows;
better to watch the fireplace
which is now a beach. 

Royalty perched on the 
bare birch this morning, 
neatly costumed in scarlet 
and shamrock green.

A pair of king parrots
with silvery voices
fluttered so close
I could have touched them.

They took the seed daintily, 
not rudely like the crimsons 
who squabble and squeak 
like cheap bath toys.

Their soft fragile beauty
filled me with awe and
champagne bubbles
danced in my eyes.

The royals won't stay.
They'll be off in a couple of days, 
but while they're around, 
I shall delight in their reign in my garden. 

In the stillness of night Wisdom came and stood
By my bed. She gazed upon me like a tender mother
And wiped away my tears, and said : 'I have heard
The cry of your spirit and I am come to comfort it.
Open your heart to me and I shall fill it with light.
Ask of me and I shall show you the way of truth.'

And I said : 'Who am I, Wisdom, and how came
I to this frightening place? What manner of things
Are these mighty hopes and these many books and
Strange patterns ? What are these thoughts that pass
As doves in flight? And these words composed by
Desire and sung by delight, what are they? What are
These conclusions, grievous and joyous, that embrace 
My spirit and envelop my heart? And those
Eyes which look at me seeing into my depths and
Fleeing from my sorrows ? And those voices mourning 
My days and chanting my littleness, what are they ?

'What is this youth that plays with my desires
And mocks at my longings, forgetful of yesterday's
Deeds, rejoicing in paltry things of the moment,
Scornful of the morrow's coming?

'What is this world that leads me whither I know
Not, standing with me in despising? And this earth
That opens wide its mouth to swallow bodies and
Lets evil things to dwell on its breast? What is this
Creature that is satisfied with the love of fortune,
Whilst beyond its union is the pit? Who seeks Life's
Kiss whilst Death does smite him, and brings the
Pleasure of a minute with a year of repentance, and
Gives himself to slumber the while dreams call him?
What is he who flows with the rivers of folly to the
Sea of darkness? O Wisdom, what manner of things
Are these?'

And she answered, saying :
'You would see, human creature, this world
Through the eyes of a god. And you would seek to
Know the secrets of the hereafter with the thinking
Of men. Yet in truth is this the height of folly.
'Go you to the wild places and you shall find
There the bee above the flowers and behold the eagle
Swooping down on his prey. Go you into your neighbor's 
House and see then the child blinking at the
Firelight and his mother busied at her household
Tasks. Be you like the bee and spend not the days of
Spring looking on the eagle's doing. Be as the child
And rejoice in the firelight and heed not your Mother's affairs. All that you see with your eyes was And is for your sake.

'The many books and the strange patterns and
Beautiful thoughts are the shades of those spirits
That came ere you were come. The words that you
Do weave are a bond between you and your brothers. 
The conclusions, grievous and joyous, are the
Seeds that the past did scatter in the field of the
Spirit to be reaped by the future. That youth who
Plays with your desires is he who will open the door
Of your heart to let enter the light. This earth with
The ever open mouth is the savior of your spirit from
The body's slavery. This world which walks with
You is your heart; and your heart is all that you
Think that world. This creature whom you see as
Ignorant and small is the same who has come from
By way of darkness.'

Then Wisdom put her hand on my burning brow
And said:
'Go then forward and do not tarry, for before


Wwalks Perfection. Go, and have not fear of thorns
On the path, for they deem naught lawful save Corrupted blood.

'Once from a big, big building,
When I was small, small,
The queer folk in the windows
Would smile at me and call.

And in the hard wee gardens
Such pleasant men would hoe:
"Sir, may we touch the little girl's hair!"—
It was so red, you know.

They cut me coloured asters
With shears so sharp and neat,
They brought me grapes and plums and pears
And pretty cakes to eat.

And out of all the windows,
No matter where we went,
The merriest eyes would follow me
And make me compliment.

There were a thousand windows,
All latticed up and down.
And up to all the windows,
When we went back to town,

The queer folk put their faces,
As gentle as could be;
"Come again, little girl!" they called, and I
Called back, "You come see me!"vixen crawls mysteriously
around glassy gardens

to a blurry moon of July

just a shadow of hunger dove

O lonely friend!

why you're still frozen? 

O lonely friend! 
whom you declares
that devoted accent? 
why there's no answers? 

vixen runs strongly
into a cave of tragedy
some might say, that's okay
but a honest heart can't be folly

vixen climbs a hill of irony

earthzcity,'m buried now; I've done with life;
I've done with hate, revenge and strife;
I've done with joy, and hope and love
And all the bustling world above. 
Long have I dwelt forgotten here
In pining woe and dull despair;
This place of solitude and gloom
Must be my dungeon and my tomb.

No hope, no pleasure can I find:
I am grown weary of my mind;
Often in balmy sleep I try
To gain a rest from misery,

And in one hour of calm repose
To find a respite from my woes,
But dreamless sleep is not for me
And I am still in misery.

I dream of liberty, 'tis true,
But then I dream of sorrow too,
Of blood and guilt and horrid woes,
Of tortured friends and happy foes;

I dream about the world, but then
I dream of fiends instead of men;
Each smiling hope so quickly fades
And such a lurid gloom pervades

That world -- that when I wake and see
Those dreary phantoms fade and flee,
Even in my dungeon I can smile,
And taste of joy a little while.

And yet it is not always so;
I dreamt a little while ago
That all was as it used to be:
A fresh free wind passed over me;

It was a pleasant summer's day,
The sun shone forth with cheering ray,
Methought a little lovely child
Looked up into my face and smiled.

My heart was full, I wept for joy,
It was my own, my darling boy;
I clasped him to my breast and he
Kissed me and laughed in childish glee.

Just them I heard in whisper sweet
A well known voice my name repeat.
His father stood before my eyes;
I gazed at him in mute surprise,

I thought he smiled and spoke to me,
But still in silent ecstasy
I gazed at him; I could not speak;
I uttered one long piercing shriek.

Alas! Alas! That cursed scream
Aroused me from my heavenly dream;
I looked around in wild despair,
I called them, but they were not there;
The father and the child are gone,
And I must live and die alone.

Marina Sabia


WHEN fallen man from Paradise was driven, 
Forth to a world of labour, death, and care; 
Still, of his native Eden, bounteous Heaven 
Resolved one brief memorial to spare, 
And gave his offspring an imperfect share 
Of that lost happiness, amid decay; 
Making their first approach to life seem fair, 
And giving, for the Eden past away, 
CHILDHOOD, the weary life's long happy holyday. 
II.

Sacred to heavenly peace, those years remain! 
And when with clouds their dawn is overcast, 
Unnatural seem the sorrow and the pain 
(Which rosy joy flies forth to banish fast, 
Because that season's sadness may not last). 
Light is their grief! a word of fondness cheers 
The unhaunted heart; the shadow glideth past; 
Unknown to them the weight of boding fears, 
And soft as dew on flowers their bright, ungrieving tears. 
III.

See the Stage-Wonder (taught to earn its bread 
By the exertion of an infant skill), 
Forsake the wholesome slumbers of its bed, 
And mime, obedient to the public will. 
Where is the heart so cold that does not thrill 
With a vexatious sympathy, to see 
That child prepare to play its part, and still 
With simulated airs of gaiety 
Rise to the dangerous rope, and bend the supple knee? 
IV.

Painted and spangled, trembling there it stands, 
Glances below for friend or father's face, 
Then lifts its small round arms and feeble hands 
With the taught movements of an artist's grace: 
Leaves its uncertain gilded resting-place-- 
Springs lightly as the elastic cord gives way-- 
And runs along with scarce perceptible pace-- 
Like a bright bird upon a waving spray, 
Fluttering and sinking still, whene'er the branches play. 
V.

Now watch! a joyless and distorted smile 
Its innocent lips assume; (the dancer's leer!) 
Conquering its terror for a little while: 
Then lets the TRUTH OF INFANCY appear, 
And with a stare of numbed and childish fear 
Looks sadly towards the audience come to gaze 
On the unwonted skill which costs so dear, 
While still the applauding crowd, with pleased amaze, 
Ring through its dizzy ears unwelcome shouts of praise. 
VI.

What is it makes us feel relieved to see 
That hapless little dancer reach the ground; 
With its whole spirit's elasticity 
Thrown into one glad, safe, triumphant bound? 
Why are we sad, when, as it gazes round 
At that wide sea of paint, and gauze, and plumes, 
(Once more awake to sense, and sight, and sound,) 
The nature of its age it re-assumes, 
And one spontaneous smile at length its face illumes? 
VII.

Because we feel, for Childhood's years and strength, 
Unnatural and hard the task hath been;-- 
Because our sickened souls revolt at length, 
And ask what infant-innocence may mean, 
Thus toiling through the artificial scene;-- 
Because at that word, CHILDHOOD, start to birth 
All dreams of hope and happiness serene-- 
All thoughts of innocent joy that visit earth-- 
Prayer--slumber--fondness--smiles--and hours of rosy mirth. 
VIII.

And therefore when we hear the shrill faint cries 
Which mark the wanderings of the little sweep; 
Or when, with glittering teeth and sunny eyes, 
The boy-Italian's voice, so soft and deep, 
Asks alms for his poor marmoset asleep; 
They fill our hearts with pitying regret, 
Those little vagrants doomed so soon to weep-- 
As though a term of joy for all was set, 
And that their share of Life's long suffering was not yet. 
IX.

Ever a toiling child doth make us sad: 
'T is an unnatural and mournful sight, 
Because we feel their smiles should be so glad, 
Because we know their eyes should be so bright. 
What is it, then, when, tasked beyond their might, 
They labour all day long for others' gain,-- 
Nay, trespass on the still and pleasant night, 
While uncompleted hours of toil remain? 
Poor little FACTORY SLAVES--for You these lines complain! 
X.

Beyond all sorrow which the wanderer knows, 
Is that these little pent-up wretches feel; 
Where the air thick and close and stagnant grows, 
And the low whirring of the incessant wheel 
Dizzies the head, and makes the senses reel: 
There, shut for ever from the gladdening sky, 
Vice premature and Care's corroding seal 
Stamp on each sallow cheek their hateful die, 
Line the smooth open brow, and sink the saddened eye. 
XI.

For them the fervid summer only brings 
A double curse of stifling withering heat; 
For them no flowers spring up, no wild bird sings, 
No moss-grown walks refresh their weary feet;-- 
No river's murmuring sound;--no wood-walk, sweet 
With many a flower the learned slight and pass;-- 
Nor meadow, with pale cowslips thickly set 
Amid the soft leaves of its tufted grass,-- 
Lure them a childish stock of treasures to amass. 

Page XII.

Have we forgotten our own infancy, 
That joys so simple are to them denied?-- 
Our boyhood's hopes--our wanderings far and free, 
Where yellow gorse-bush left the common wide 
And open to the breeze?--The active pride 
Which made each obstacle a pleasure seem; 
When, rashly glad, all danger we defied, 
Dashed through the brook by twilight's fading gleam, 
Or scorned the tottering plank, and leapt the narrow stream? 
XIII.

In lieu of this,--from short and bitter night, 
Sullen and sad the infant labourer creeps; 
He joys not in the glow of morning's light, 
But with an idle yearning stands and weeps, 
Envying the babe that in its cradle sleeps: 
And ever as he slowly journeys on, 
His listless tongue unbidden silence keeps; 
His fellow-labourers (playmates hath he none) 
Walk by, as sad as he, nor hail the morning sun. 
XIV.

Mark the result. Unnaturally debarred 
All nature's fresh and innocent delights, 
While yet each germing energy strives hard, 
And pristine good with pristine evil fights; 
When every passing dream the heart excites, 
And makes even guarded virtue insecure; 
Untaught, unchecked, they yield as vice invites: 
With all around them cramped, confined, impure, 
Fast spreads the moral plague which nothing new shall cure. 
XV.

Yes, this reproach is added; (infamous 
Not suffering only is their portion, thus 
Compelled to toil their youthful lives away: 
Excessive labour works the SOUL'S decay-- 
Quenches the intellectual light within-- 
Crushes with iron weight the mind's free play-- 
Steals from us LEISURE purer thoughts to win-- 
And leaves us sunk and lost in dull and native sin. 
XVI.

Yet in the British Senate men rise up, 
(The freeborn and the fathers of our land!) 
And while these drink the dregs of Sorrow's cup, 
Deny the sufferings of the pining band. 
With nice-drawn calculations at command, 
They prove--rebut--explain--and reason long; 
Proud of each shallow argument they stand, 
And prostitute their utmost powers of tongue 
Feebly to justify this great and glaring wrong. 
XVII.

So rose, with such a plausible defence 
Of the unalienable RIGHT OF GAIN, 
Those who against Truth's brightest eloquence 
Upheld the cause of torture and of pain: 
And fear of Property's Decrease made vain, 
To lift the curse from SLAVERY'S dark domain, 
And send across the wide Atlantic sea 
The watchword of brave men--the thrilling shout, 'BE FREE!' 
XVIII.

What is to be a slave? Is't not to spend 
A life bowed down beneath a grinding ill?-- 
To labour on to serve another's end,-- 
To give up leisure, health, and strength, and skill-- 
And give up each of these against your will? 
Hark to the angry answer:--'Theirs is not 
A life of slavery; if they labour,--still 
We pay their toil. Free service is their lot; 
And what their labour yields, by us is fairly got.' 
XIX.

Oh, Men! blaspheme not Freedom! Are they free 
Who toil until the body's strength gives way? 
Who may not set a term for Liberty, 
Who have no time for food, or rest, or play, 
But struggle through the long unwelcome day 
Without the leisure to be good or glad? 
Such is their service--call it what you may. 
Poor little creatures, overtasked and sad, 
Your Slavery hath no name,--yet is its Curse as bad! 
XX.

Again an answer. ''T is their parents' choice. 
By some employ the poor man's child must earn 
Its daily bread; and infants have no voice 
In what the allotted task shall be: they learn 
What answers best, or suits the parents' turn.' 
Mournful reply! Do not your hearts inquire 
Who tempts the parents' penury? They yearn 
Toward their offspring with a strong desire, 
But those who starve will sell, even what they most require. 
XXI.

We grant their class must labour--young and old; 
We grant the child the needy parents' tool: 
But still our hearts a better plan behold; 
No bright Utopia of some dreaming fool, 
But rationally just, and good by rule. 
Not against TOIL, but TOIL'S EXCESS we pray, 
(Else were we nursed in Folly's simplest school); 
That so our country's hardy children may 
Learn not to loathe, but bless, the well apportioned day. 
XXII.

One more reply! The last reply--the great 
Answer to all that sense or feeling shows, 
To which all others are subordinate:-- 
'The Masters of the Factories must lose 
By the abridgement of these infant woes. 
Show us the remedy which shall combine 
Our equal gain with their increased repose-- 
Which shall not make our trading class repine, 
But to the proffered boon its strong effects confine.' 
XXIII.

Oh! shall it then be said that TYRANT acts 
Are those which cause our country's looms to thrive? 
That Merchant England's prosperous trade exacts 
This bitter sacrifice, e'er she derive 
That profit due, for which the feeble strive? 
Is her commercial avarice so keen, 
That in her busy multitudinous hive 
Hundreds must die like insects, scarcely seen, 
While the thick-thronged survivors work where they have been? 
XXIV.

Forbid it, Spirit of the glorious Past 
Which gained our Isle the surname of 'The Free,' 
And made our shores a refuge at the last 
To all who would not bend the servile knee, 
The vainly-vanquished sons of Liberty! 
Here ever came the injured, the opprest, 
Compelled from the Oppressor's face to flee-- 
And found a home of shelter and of rest 
In the warm generous heart that beat in England's breast. 
XXV.

Here came the Slave, who straightway burst his chain, 
And knew that none could ever bind him more; 
Here came the melancholy sons of Spain; 
And here, more buoyant Gaul's illustrious poor 
Waited the same bright day that shone before. 
Here rests the Enthusiast Pole! and views afar 
With dreaming hope, from this protecting shore, 
The trembling rays of Liberty's pale star 
Shine forth in vain to light the too-unequal war! 
XXVI.

And shall REPROACH cling darkly to the name 
Which every memory so much endears? 
Shall we, too, tyrannise,--and tardy Fame 
Revoke the glory of our former years, 
And stain Britannia's flag with children's tears? 
So shall the mercy of the English throne 
Become a by-word in the Nation's ears, 
As one who pitying heard the stranger's groan, 
But to these nearer woes was cold and deaf as stone. 
XXVII.

Are there not changes made which grind the Poor? 
Are there not losses every day sustained,-- 
Deep grievances, which make the spirit sore? 
And what the answer, when these have complained? 
'For crying evils there hath been ordained 
The REMEDY OF CHANGE; to obey its call 
Some individual loss must be disdained, 
And pass as unavoidable and small, 
Weighed with the broad result of general good to all.' 
XXVIII.

Oh! such an evil now doth cry aloud! 
And CHANGE should be by generous hearts begun, 
Though slower gain attend the prosperous crowd; 
Lessening the fortunes for their children won. 
Why should it grieve a father, that his son 
Plain competence must moderately bless? 
That he must trade, even as his sire has done, 
Not born to independent idleness, 
Though honestly above all probable distress? 
XXIX.

Rejoice! Thou hast not left enough of gold 
From the lined heavy ledger, to entice 
His drunken hand, irresolutely bold, 
To squander it in haggard haunts of vice:-- 
The hollow rattling of the uncertain dice 
Eats not the portion which thy love bestowed;-- 
Unable to afford that PLEASURE'S price, 
Far off he slumbers in his calm abode, 
And leaves the Idle Rich to follow Ruin's road. 
XXX.

Happy his lot! For him there shall not be 
The cold temptation given by vacant time; 
Leaving his young and uncurbed spirit free 
To wander thro' the feverish paths of crime! 
For him the Sabbath bell's returning chime 
No night of riot clouds the morning's prime: 
Alert and glad, not languid and opprest, 
He wakes, and with calm soul is the Creator blest. 
XXXI.

Ye save for children! Fathers, is there not 
A plaintive magic in the name of child, 
Which makes you feel compassion for their lot 
On whom Prosperity hath never smiled? 
When with your OWN an hour hath been beguiled 
(For whom you hoard the still increasing store), 
Surely, against the face of Pity mild, 
Heart-hardening Custom vainly bars the door, 
For that less favoured race--THE CHILDREN OF THE POOR. 
XXXII.

'The happy homes of England!'--they have been 
A source of triumph, and a theme for song; 
And surely if there be a hope serene 
And beautiful, which may to Earth belong, 
'T is when (shut out the world's associate throng, 
And closed the busy day's fatiguing hum), 
Still waited for with expectation strong, 
Welcomed with joy, and overjoyed to come, 
The good man goes to seek the twilight rest of home. 
XXXIII.

There sits his gentle Wife, who with him knelt 
Still beautiful,--though all that she hath felt 
Hath calmed the glory of her radiant face, 
And given her brow a holier, softer grace. 
Mother of SOULS IMMORTAL, she doth feel 
A glow from Heaven her earthly love replace; 
Prayer to her lip more often now doth steal, 
And meditative hope her serious eyes reveal. 
XXXIV.

Fondly familiar is the look she gives 
As he returns, who forth so lately went,-- 
For they together pass their happy lives; 
And many a tranquil evening have they spent 
Since, blushing, ignorantly innocent, 
She vowed, with downcast eyes and changeful hue, 
To love Him only. Love fulfilled, hath lent 
Its deep repose; and when he meets her view, 
Her soft look only says,--'I trust--and I am true.' 
XXXV.

Scattered like flowers, the rosy children play-- 
Or round her chair a busy crowd they press; 
But, at the FATHER'S coming, start away, 
With playful struggle for his loved caress, 
And jealous of the one he first may bless. 
To each, a welcoming word is fondly said; 
He bends and kisses some; lifts up the less; 
Admires the little cheek, so round and red, 
Or smooths with tender hand the curled and shining head. 
XXXVI.

Oh! let us pause, and gaze upon them now. 
Is there not one--beloved and lovely boy! 
With Mirth's bright seal upon his open brow, 
And sweet fond eyes, brimful of love and joy? 
He, whom no measure of delight can cloy, 
The daring and the darling of the set; 
He who, though pleased with every passing toy, 
Thoughtless and buoyant to excess, could yet 
Never a gentle word or kindly deed forget? 
XXXVII.

And one, more fragile than the rest, for whom-- 
As for the weak bird in a crowded nest-- 
Are needed all the fostering care of home 
And the soft comfort of the brooding breast: 
One, who hath oft the couch of sickness prest! 
On whom the Mother looks, as it goes by, 
With tenderness intense, and fear supprest, 
While the soft patience of her anxious eye 
XXXVIII.

And is there not the elder of the band? 
She with the gentle smile and smooth bright hair, 
Waiting, some paces back,--content to stand 
Till these of Love's caresses have their share; 
Knowing how soon his fond paternal care 
Shall seek his violet in her shady nook,-- 
Patient she stands--demure, and brightly fair-- 
Copying the meekness of her Mother's look, 
And clasping in her hand the favourite story-book. 
XXXIX.

Wake, dreamer!--Choose;--to labour Life away, 
Which of these little precious ones shall go 
(Debarred of summer-light and cheerful play) 
To that receptacle for dreary woe, 
The Factory Mill?--Shall He, in whom the glow 
Of Life shines bright, whose free limbs' vigorous tread 
Warns us how much of beauty that we know 
Would fade, when he became dispirited, 
And pined with sickened heart, and bowed his fainting head? 

XL.

Or shall the little quiet one, whose voice 
So rarely mingles in their sounds of glee, 
Whose life can bid no living thing rejoice, 
But rather is a long anxiety;-- 
Shall he go forth to toil? and keep the free 
Frank boy, whose merry shouts and restless grace 
Would leave all eyes that used his face to see, 
Wistfully gazing towards that vacant space 
Which makes their fireside seem a lone and dreary place? 
XLI.

Or, sparing these, send Her whose simplest words 
Have power to charm,--whose warbled, childish song, 
Fluent and clear and bird-like, strikes the chords 
Of sympathy among the listening throng,-- 
Whose spirits light, and steps that dance along, 
Instinctive modesty and grace restrain: 
The fair young innocent who knows no wrong,-- 
Whose slender wrists scarce hold the silken skein 
Which the glad Mother winds;--shall She endure this pain? 

XLII.

Away! The thought--the thought alone brings tears! 
THEY labour--they, the darlings of our lives! 
The flowers and the sunbeams of our fleeting years; 
From whom alone our happiness derives 
A lasting strength, which every shock survives; 
The green young trees beneath whose arching boughs 
(When failing Energy no longer strives,) 
Our wearied age shall find a cool repose;-- 
THEY toil in torture!--No--the painful picture close. 
XLIII.

Ye shudder,--nor behold the vision more! 
Oh, Fathers! is there then one law for these, 
And one for the pale children of the Poor,-- 
That to their agony your hearts can freeze; 
Deny their pain, their toil, their slow disease; 
And deem with false complaining they encroach 
Upon your time and thought? Is yours the Ease 
Which misery vainly struggles to approach, 
Whirling unthinking by, in Luxury's gilded coach? 
XLIV.

Examine and decide. Watch through his day 
One of these little ones. The sun hath shone 
An hour, and by the ruddy morning's ray, 
The last and least, he saunters on alone. 
See where, still pausing on the threshold stone, 
He stands, as loth to lose the bracing wind; 
With wistful wandering glances backward thrown 
On all the light and glory left behind, 
And sighs to think that HE must darkly be confined! 
XLV.

Enter with him. The stranger who surveys 
The little natives of that dreary place 
(Where squalid suffering meets his shrinking gaze), 
Used to the glory of a young child's face, 
Its changeful light, its coloured sparkling grace, 
(Gleams of Heaven's sunshine on our shadowed earth!) 
Starts at each visage wan, and bold, and base, 
Whose smiles have neither innocence nor mirth,-- 
And comprehends the Sin original from birth. 
XLVI.

There the pale Orphan, whose unequal strength 
Loathes the incessant toil it must pursue, 
Pines for the cool sweet evening's twilight length, 
The sunny play-hour, and the morning's dew: 
Worn with its cheerless life's monotonous hue, 
Bowed down, and faint, and stupefied it stands; 
Each half-seen object reeling in its view-- 
While its hot, trembling, languid little hands 
Mechanically heed the Task-master's commands. 
XLVII.

There, sounds of wailing grief and painful blows 
Offend the ear, and startle it from rest; 
(While the lungs gasp what air the place bestows 
Or misery's joyless vice, the ribald jest, 
Breaks the sick silence: staring at the guest 
Who comes to view their labour, they beguile 
The unwatched moment; whispers half supprest 
And mutterings low, their faded lips defile,-- 
While gleams from face to face a strange and sullen smile. 
XLVIII.

These then are his Companions: he, too young 
To share their base and saddening merriment,His limbs cramped up; his body weakly bent; 
Toiling obedient, till long hours so spent 
Produce Exhaustion's slumber, dull and deep. 
The Watcher's stroke,--bold--sudden--violent,-- 
Urges him from that lethargy of sleep, 
And bids him wake to Life,--to labour and to weep! 
XLIX.

But the day hath its End. Forth then he hies 
With jaded, faltering step, and brow of pain; 
Creeps to that shed,--his HOME,--where happy lies 
The sleeping babe that cannot toil for Gain; 
Where his remorseful Mother tempts in vain 
With the best portion of their frugal fare: 
Too sick to eat--too weary to complain-- 
He turns him idly from the untasted share, 
Slumbering sinks down unfed, and mocks her useless care. 
L.

Weeping she lifts, and lays his heavy head 
(With a woman's grieving tenderness) 
On the hard surface of his narrow bed; 
Bends down to give a sad unfelt caress, 
That, weary as he is, he need not fight 
Against that long-enduring bitterness, 
The VOLUNTARY LABOUR of the Night, 
But sweetly slumber on till day's returning light. 
LI.

Vain hope! Alas! unable to forget 
The anxious task's long, heavy agonies, 
In broken sleep the victim labours yet! 
Waiting the boding stroke that bids him rise, 
He marks in restless fear each hour that flies-- 
Anticipates the unwelcome morning prime-- 
And murmuring feebly, with unwakened eyes, 
'Mother! Oh Mother! is it yet THE TIME?'-- 
Starts at the moon's pale ray--or clock's far distant chime. 
LII.

Such is his day and night! Now then return 
Where your OWN slumber in protected ease; 
They whom no blast may pierce, no sun may burn; 
The lovely, on whose cheeks the wandering breeze 
Hath left the rose's hue. Ah! not like these 
Does the pale infant-labourer ask to be: 
He craves no tempting food--no toys to please-- 
Not Idleness,--but less of agony; 
Not Wealth,--but comfort, rest, CONTENTED POVERTY. 
LIII.

There is, among all men, in every clime, 
A difference instinctive and unschooled: 
By fierceness conquered, or by cunning fooled, 
The World hath had its Rulers and its Ruled:-- 
Yea--uncompelled--men abdicate free choice, 
Fear their own rashness, and, by thinking cooled, 
Follow the counsel of some trusted voice;-- 
A self-elected sway, wherein their souls rejoice. 
LIV.

Thus, for the most part, willing to obey, 
Men rarely set Authority at naught: 
Albeit a weaker or a worse than they 
May hold the rule with such importance fraught: 
And thus the peasant, from his cradle taught 
That some must own, while some must till the land, 
Rebels not--murmurs not--even in his thought. 
Born to his lot, he bows to high command, 
And guides the furrowing plough with a contented hand. 
LV.

But, if the weight which habit renders light 
Is made to gall the Serf who bends below-- 
The dog that watched and fawned, prepares to bite! 
Too rashly strained, the cord snaps from the bow-- 
Too tightly curbed, the steeds their riders throw-- 
And so, (at first contented his fair state 
Of customary servitude to know,) 
Too harshly ruled, the poor man learns to hate 
And curse the oppressive law that bids him serve the Great. 
LVI.

THEN first he asks his gloomy soul the CAUSE 
Of his discomfort; suddenly compares-- 
Reflects--and with an angry Spirit draws 
The envious line between his lot and theirs, 
Questioning the JUSTICE of the unequal shares. 
And from the gathering of this discontent, 
Where there is strength, REVOLT his standard rears; 
Where there is weakness, evermore finds vent 
The sharp annoying cry of sorrowful complaint. 
LVII.

Therefore should Mercy, gentle and serene, 
Sit by the Ruler's side, and share his Throne:-- 
Watch with unerring eye the passing scene, 
And bend her ear to mark the feeblest groan; 
Lest due Authority be overthrown, 
And they that ruled perceive (too late confest!) 
Permitted Power might still have been their own, 
Had they but watched that none should be opprest-- 
No just complaint despised--no WRONG left unredrest. 
LVIII.

Forget who smiled on helpless infancy, 
And blest them with divinely gentle hand.-- 
'Suffer that little children come to me:' 
Such were His words to whom we bow the knee! 
These to our care the Saviour did commend; 
And shall we His bequest treat carelessly, 
Who yet our full protection would extend 
To the lone Orphan child left by an Earthly Friend? 
LIX.

No! rather what the Inspired Law imparts 
To guide our ways, and make our path more sure; 
Blending with Pity (native to our hearts), 
Let us to these, who patiently endure 
Neglect, and penury, and toil, secure 
The innocent hopes that to their age belong: 
So, honouring Him, the Merciful and Pure, 
Who watches when the Oppressor's arm grows strong,-- 
And helpeth them to right--the Weak--who suffer wrong

I

She walks with the wind on the windy height
When the rocks are loud and the waves are white,
And all night long she calls through the night,
'O my children, come home!'
Her bleak gown, torn as a tattered cloud,
Tosses around her like a shroud,
While over the deep her voice rings loud,-
'O my children, come home, come home!
O my children, come home!'

II

Who is she who wanders alone,
When the wind drives sheer and the rain is blown?
Who walks all night and makes her moan,
'O my children, come home!'
Whose face is raised to the blinding gale;
Whose hair blows black and whose eyes are pale,
While over the world goes by her wail,-
'O my children, come home, come home!
O my children, come home!'

III

She walks with the wind in the windy wood;
The dark rain drips from her hair and hood,
And her cry sobs by, like a ghost pursued,
'O my children, come home!'
Where the trees loom gaunt and the rocks stretch drear,
The owl and the fox crouch back with fear,
As wild through the wood her voice they hear,-
'O my children, come home, come home!
O my children, come home!'

IV

Who is she who shudders by
When the boughs blow bare and the dead leaves fly?
Who walks all night with her wailing cry,
'O my children, come home!'
Who, strange of look, and wild of tongue,
With wan feet wounded and hands wild-wrung,
Sweeps on and on with her cry, far-flung,-
'O my children, come home, come home!
O my children, come home!'

V

'Tis the Spirit of Autumn, no man sees,
The mother of Death and of Mysteries,
Who cries on the wind all night to these,
'O my children, come home!'
The Spirit of Autumn, pierced with pain,
Calling her children home again,
Death and Dreams, through ruin and rain,-
'O my children, come home, come home!
O my children, come home!


'The story of my life
Is one of running, 
Flitting from one self to another, 
From one place to another, 
Looking for a little quiet place
To hide my rueful face
Seeking a better chance
That I've conceived in grace.
I need to get away from here, 
Be there and over there.
I've always a reason to get there.
 I keep running, running, 
No single minute of peace
Am I a friend of the wind
Or a twin of Aouita in a race? 
I used to be a rebellious
Against everything that changed
And everything that never changed; 
Against my beloved mother
And against my hated brother
Against the cold weather
And against the closed border
Am I an Atlas lion
Or a volcano man? 
I keep running, running, 
Running and always running. 

As the year end is approaching
let's be more calm and clear, 
Set our goals and follow them
with the advent of the new year.

Let's bury the past 
and not repeat the mistakes, 
Not regret on the past deeds, 
but be our own re-make.

and move forward without fear, 
As not everyone was blessed to 
complete their journey of life this year.

for every new day, 
And guiding us in the right way. 

I might not ever scale the mountain heights
Where all the great men stand in glory now; 
I may not ever gain the world's delights
Or win a wreath of laurel for my brow; 
I may not gain the victories that men
Are fighting for, nor do a thing to boast of; 
I may not get a fortune here, but then,
The little that I have I'll make the most of.

I'll make my little home a palace fine,
My little patch of green a garden fair, 
And I shall know each humble plant and vine
As rich men know their orchid blossoms rare. 
My little home may not be much to see;
Its chimneys may not tower far above; 
But it will be a mansion great to me,
For in its walls I'll keep a hoard of love.

I will not pass my modest pleasures by
To grasp at shadows of more splendid things, 
Disdaining what of joyousness is nigh
Because I am denied the joy of kings. 
But I will laugh and sing my way along,
I'll make the most of what is mine to-day, 
And if I never rise above the throng,
I shall have lived a full life anyway. 

This day that starts true love
I wish to offer my heart and verse
Oath of honesty for two to start-
This day of affection leading to nights of love
I wish to undertake the chance
Oath of love to you my closest friend-
 This day two hearts beat one love
I hope my cry you hear
This day people delight in love
I wish two words to hear
Oath of love; I DO, living in two hearts
This day forever changed by our love
I hope to hold you forever near
Oath of love forever my song-
This day couples gather in an aurora of love
I hope you see my love true and dear
Oath of love that makes us complete-
This day that truth finds our love
I wish to say; I DO, love you
Oath of love to you I have so longed-
This day of bold chance for love
I pray our love’s fire is never ending
Oath of love that makes lover’s smile-
Forever embraced, bridled, and yoked with you in one love
I dream nights of promise that leave us both spent
Of my dearest dear last night;
Make her this day smile on me,
And I'll roses give to thee

O wave of whirlpool! 
take me home
when sun goes down

O wave of isle! 
take me home
when moon shouts aloud

creepy cape waits for an endless terror
frightful wind blows so mellow
why our sights sense horror
when we need a glow? 

hazy harbor welcomes a dark guest
terrible trance brings a wounded chest
who save those screaming mermaids of ocean
when all white vessels suddenly turn up and down? 

O wave of atoll! 
take me in
where hope still alive
